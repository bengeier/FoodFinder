{"text":"5star for a club on the weekend!!  As for the food, looks fancy but really isn't. Very overpriced for the quality and service.  Very clean. Btw washrooms are on the lower floor, from the dining."}
{"text":"Great restaurant! I base my food experience at Aw Shucks to be one of the best. Dinner service is excellent and the food is just the same. I've yet to order a dish that I didn't like. I would like to take this opportunity to mention that they have a great selection of oysters!  If you are in the mood for some live entertainment, they offer that in the casual section of the restaurant. The night we went, the band called ORGANIZED CHAOS were performing and the crowd loved them.   Our server, Julia, was excellent! She was so attentive regardless of the fact that there were so many people in the bar. She always had a smile on her face and was really accommodating.   I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped by for a late lunch on Sunday. The place was pretty much empty. For such a large space, it was a little off-putting. But determined to give it a try, we continued on. Our server was friendly and mostly on top of things. A table of card playing guys seemed to be running him ragged. Good selection of beers, frosty cold. Good start. We each ordered a salad to start. My wife had some sort of pear and mix green salad. She said it was great. I had their version of a caesar salad. Really good. Fried cheese to act as croutons, fried pancetta, a garlic dressing and balsamic drizzle. For entrees my wife had the jerk chicken wrap with fries. She seemed to like it very much. I had the beef wellington. To be honest I was pretty surprised by the quality. Super tender beef, rich flavour and a good sized portion. For a reasonable price no less. Would recommend if you like your beef rare. All in all a good experience for a surprisingly good price. Just wish there were more patrons and a better ambiance."}
{"text":"My stomach was feeling upset after eating the raw oyster, fried oysters and crab cake. Never coming back again!"}
{"text":"I had really high hopes for this place as one of my friends mentioned this is a good bar in Aurora. The ambiance is there, but the service is non-existent.   The night started out pretty great with all my friends ordering a drink and us catching up after not seeing each other for a while. However, we were in the bar area, and the performer was really, really loud. I couldn't hear what my friend was saying across the table, which defeated the purpose of \"catching up\". Toning down the volume would have been great, as the performer was actually a really good singer.   We ordered the lobster fritters which I was excited for. They were basically deep-fried lobster claws on a piece of lettuce with a creamy mayo sauce. The sauce was really overpowering and the claws seemed a little too done and rubbery. For $16 for 4 they may have been worth it - if not for the sauce and the overcooked results.   Also, our server disappeared on us throughout the night when my friends wanted to order a second drink. When we were paying our separate bills at the end of the night, however, I was charged for two drinks, when I had specifically only ordered one that night (was limiting myself) and one water. The waitress (who was already wearing her hoodie over her uniform and ready to leave) got into a pretty heated argument with me where she was really stubborn and it ended with a long, uncomfortable hostile glare before she tore my receipt out of my hand and printed a new one with my one drink and two appetizer charges.   I have never experienced service that rude.   (We later realized she had confused me with my friend who had ordered the same drink at the beginning of the night... but really we aren't even the same ethnicity or look a like. I'm sorry if a table of 8 confuses a waitress of 10+ years....)   If you are in the area or just passing through, go somewhere else. Anywhere else."}
{"text":"Such good seafood! Nice atmosphere (cute bartender )  great drinks and did I mention the food is good?    Oysters were obviously phenomenal. Crab cakes are unreal. Would've liked a different sauce, but still very good. Burger was great too."}
{"text":"Beautiful space but overpriced food for what it is.  Seemed like people were only being served if they sat at the bar. We asked for menus and sat down in the dining area. When we were finally acknowledged after waiting to order, our server seemed very hostile. There was great live music on a Wednesday night but disappointed in the service."}
{"text":"Went for Mothers day. Big mistake. Service sucked, one and a half hours to get food. Menu was horrible, food ok, well below what you would expect. As a bar it may be fine, but if you want good food in a timely fashion with good service find another place. If I go back it will only be for beer and munchies if I have a lot of time on my hands, like an entire afternoon to spend waiting for a beer and a snack."}
{"text":"We just had dinner at Aw Shucks! Outstanding! Great food and service!"}
{"text":"Service...hm... could be better, food could be much better. Not a great place at all"}
{"text":"We went for oysters and were not disappointed. They were a mix of maritime oysters, fresh, clean and cold, beautifully presented with delicious sauces and fresh grated horseradish. Next we had the clam chowder, not hot but with lots of flavour and tender meat. Then the main courses, they were a let down. Everything came on COLD plates that took away any of the heat in the food. Fries were stone cold, the calamari was also cold and tough as shoe leather. Chicken wings were from a small bird. The calamari was replaced with fish tacos that were not too bad. Other than the oysters and chowder, all the other food was mediocre and over priced.  If you go, stick to the oysters."}
{"text":"Needs Improvements  My sister and I decided to visit the new location and we had high expectations but we were disappointed. We visited on Oct. 14/2013 around 2:30pm.  Customer service needs improvement. When we entered the restaurant there was no one there to greet us, my sister peaked around the corner through the dinner room and seen at least five waitress siting down and talking. Are they there to work or socialize? My sister had to yell out hello before we were noticed. When we were approached the waitress said that no one enters through the front door because the parking is at the back, excuses.   The place was so very dirty and I was not expecting that from a new place. There were drink stains on our table and chairs, from my seat I could seem gum under the bar. The stuff should be cleaning not socializing.  My sister and I only ordered two desserts and even that was disappointing. Her chocolate lava cake was brunt on the bottom and the inside was raw."}
{"text":"New HUGE location about 2 minutes south of the old location on Yonge street.   Huge dining area matched only by the large bar area nicknamed (according to a large overhead sign) the Tavern. Bar area has ample floor space, a long bar splitting the room in half and a large stage/riser for live music. This area is well laid out, as when sitting at the bar, you are directly facing the stage.  The bar has all your standards big name beers (Rickards, Coors, Canadian, Strong Bow). Nothing that real grabbed me so I asked to see the cocktail menu and decided on a Manhattan which was pretty good (not the best) but certainly made as it should be. My only piece of constructive criticism would be that, if planning to serve classic cocktails, they use large cubes or cocktail ice as opposed to ice pieces (really waters down the drink).  Ordered oysters once I found that on Mondays and Tuesdays they go for $1.50 a piece. They had 4 kinds available on the day I paid them a visit. This is one of the first times that 1/2 a dozen oysters cost me so little - definitely coming back for these many MANY times!  Also ordered a crab cake and I gotta say I was unsure how to assess it at first because it was so different than I was used to. As opposed to be cooked to a crisp, they pan seat it lightly so it's soft enough to cut with a fork (think a pan seared mashed potato). Served on top of a corn salsa, it's well flavored with a little tiny kick to it. Definitely worth trying!  Aw shucks has also set itself up as THE party destination in Aurora as in addition to their massive dining and bar area, they also have built huge rooftop and tear deck patios to accommodate the crowds that the old location couldn't handle.  Looking forward to many nights in the near future @ Aw Shucks!  Eatcrest Out!"}
{"text":"Aw Shucks new location has a great decor (much bigger than the old place) and has a rooftop lounge that is by far the best in York Region.  Live bands Friday and Saturday nights. Was there last Saturday and it was packed! Fun bar where plenty travel from afar to meet with the elite and mingle under the stars! Worth the drive, but be sure to arrive before 10:30 (large line-ups).  Heard the food is good. Its on the west side of Yonge just south of Wellington. Parking is available on the street, behind the buildings or at the nearby bank (BMO north-west corner of Yonge/Wellington).  Crowds appear to be getting younger, but still a great place for 40 plus too.  Yes, they can use more staff at the bar, they appeared overwhelmed last weekend."}
{"text":"I question how this restaurant manages to sustain its business when half of the menu isn't available. We ordered paella and it was rather a small portioned risotto with four frozen mussels and four pieces of frozen shrimps. Calamari was tougher than a piece of rubber (yup, probably have been frozen for years!) drenched in butter and nothing else.  I'm so thankful that I didn't order anything else. The server was out of her mind, I wish I didn't tip her but she included the tip in the bill (thick skin much? For what?). I would never go back to this restaurant and would be pleasantly surprised if this business existed in the next few years."}
{"text":"Really terrible service.  Waitress didn't clear the table after each course (which drives me nuts lol) when asked for clean cutlery, I was told that they didn't have enough to go around and I would have to use a dessert fork and steak knife for my fish course. ? The place wasn't even busy.   Asked the staff for their recommendation on a wine pairing and they told me \"whatever you like.....white?\"  Halibut was really dry, risotto was over cooked and dry. Don't let the presentation fool you. It's all poorly executed. It's a real shame because the space is so nice. Get a real chef, train the staff and maybe it could be a great place again.    If management reads these reviews - please get real trained waitresses for the downstairs restaurant and keep the untrained in the cocktail bar."}
{"text":"Very disappointed! While the service was fantastic and the oysters were great, this place is wasted potential. They have an attractive cocktail menu that is very poorly executed. Based on the prices, I was expecting a good meal and was very let down. The seafood risotto was an acidic mess and the Atlantic Salmon was bland, boring and thrown on a plate alongside dry, inedible rice. I didn't bother sending it back as I had seen their chef's potential.  Worst part was, before we were done forcing down the food the cool atmosphere was ruined when we were interrupted by the loudest and most obnoxious music imaginable. The volume wouldn't have been as offensive if the bass wasn't turned all the way up, the vibration in our chests making every swallow that much more laborious. This DJ should be working bat-mitzvas. No one should be deafened by The Black Eyed Peas while trying to eat. I was $200 in with a group on their way to join us and forced to leave. It was really that bad.   That being said, I would give the bar tender another shot, the service was great and the oysters are worth coming back for. Should I find out something has been done about the Friday night music nightmare I would try again. (For drinks and oysters only...)"}
{"text":"The service took forever I can understand as the restaurant was busy - but being in a restaurant that serves oysters I couldn't believe that I had to ask for bread! And they don't give you water as well.   The oysters were good but again had to wait more than 20 minutes to get bread to eat with.  And on the menu they do not disclose that their chowder has actually bacon in it. Wouldn't go back nor would recommend."}
{"text":"We met friends for dinner here last night, a Monday evening. They had been here before, but we were new to Aw Shucks.  It was phenomenal. The restaurant is clean and lovely, the service was good, and the food was extraordinary. I had oysters and a pear mesclun salad, my husband had a romaine salad (that seemed to contain an inordinate amount of bacon) and amazing warm calamari, and there was an order of shrimp pasta very much enjoyed. The oysters were sweet and fresh and the accompanying several sauces were marvelous. I have digestive issues and am ordinarily extremely critical of restaurants, but I found Aw Shucks to be superb. I hope to go back often. I would only wish that they would open another venue closer to our home. It's a drive for us, and this winter refuses to end."}
{"text":"Mediocre at best.  Dining/bar area: stage was cool to see although there were no bands playing that night. Decor was modern and inviting. There are 2 patios. Both are good size. Would be a nice place to go and enjoy a drink with some fresh oysters. Unfortunately you can't order a cider because they don't have any on the menu...  - Lobster poutine was decent. Nice amount of lobster. Shoestring fries were different for a poutine. Too much cheese and oil though.    - Fish tacos were lack luster.  More so the fish. The toasted Naan and toppings were great but the fish was lacking seasoning and wasn't crispy enough.    - Fried oysters were the highlight of our meal.  Exciting and tasty with a  great presentation.    - Muscles were dreadful. Tomato broth was bland and the muscles had a smell to them and were puny in size.   All those 4 appetizers and 1 drink (caesar) was $75. Steep price for cheap ingredients."}
{"text":"The food is average and way over priced, same with their drinks. The bar scene can be a hit or miss on any given weekend. The only time that the bar/club is pumping is when they are having events going that given night (college student Christmas party event, New years eve)"}
{"text":"I have been here 3 times so far and get a different atmosphere experience every time haha. I went there late at night for the bar seen and found it a combination of 20 year olds and lonely older women (i wouldn't say cougars, but definitely 40+ and single). Ive also been there for supper twice before the bar scene started and that was nice too. I would highly recommend the Lobster Fettuccine, the mussels, and the oysters. I usually order a selection of various oysters( they usually carry a few from different locations). The different oysters all have a unique flavor and boy are the oysters FRESH! The oysters come with a wide selection of sauces on a platter; but they're so nice and fresh that i just put a bit of Tabasco.   Really friendly staff. We came there on New Years Day for supper, and although there was only one waiter working, he paid attention to us and brought us our food as promptly as possibly.   Would definitely recommend giving this place a try."}
{"text":"I came here for the first time with some girlfriends at the \"new\" location. I never wanted to go to the old one because it looked like a dump from the outside. But it was girls night out & they talked me into it. We arrived around 8:30pm & the \"bouncer\" was friendly,we went inside & were told no tables were available, which I could see they were clearly busy. But I noticed a small area that we 4 gals could fit into in front across from the stage & told the host we would be willing to squish in there. My brains work. I was surprised at how the decor was; casual upscale( nicely done). We ordered drinks which were ok, I had a dozen bay oysters which were shockingly small! Great taste,fresh but barely there. The accompanying sauces were good. We tried the calamari; great taste not overcooked or chewy. The shrimp pasta never would we order again, pasta overcooked & bland sauce. Crab cake was big but lacked flavour. Salmon with quinoa, presentation was nice and edible. I think this place is more a place to come & hang out with friends but don't have great expectations for the food. Not horrible but not great either. At 9:00 pm the live band started to play & all of a sudden a swarm of ladies & gents hit the \"dance floor\". The band that played was actually really good, she sang various tunes from Bob Marley to Maroon5 songs. My friends & I couldn't help but laugh at some of the clientele that came for the night festivities. \"Cougars n bobcats\" not that there's anything wrong with that, we were just taken aback to how obvious they were. Overall, we did enjoy ourselves and would go back. I like music so live band or dj I'm down to party! But I'm ordering regular oysters next time."}
{"text":"Well, I was excited at the prospect of a Seafood Resto/Oyster Bar in Aurora. I can't think of another one anywhere nearby. Unfortunately, Aw Shucks did not fulfill a great opportunity to be an awesome seafood place in an area with no competitors.  The venue itself is great. Very nice and not pretentious. Nice bar, friendly waitress.  We ordered some Lucky Lime Oysters to start. The shucking was pretty bad. I got chips of shell in my mouth, and the flesh of the oyster was butchered.  I ordered the Bouillabaisse for my entree.   Let me pause here for a second. I love Bouillabaisse. I have memories of eating it in Southern France. The amalgamation of different types of fish, cooked together in a tomato-based broth, is something I order as often as I see it on a menu. It's not common because it takes time to prepare and not many people order it at a restaurant. Albeit a peasant-dish, simple and complex at the same time.   When I received the dish, the broth was at the bottom and the fish was stacked up fancily on top. I took a few bites and immediately figured it out. This restaurant uses different types of fish for separate dishes. For example, the salmon is used in the bouillabaisse and in the salmon salad. Therefore, they cook the salmon on its own and then add it to each dish as needed, which means, for the bouillabaisse, that it never really gets cooked with the other fish. My guess is that the broth is prepared separately with the potatoes and onions, and then the other fish is just placed on top of it. Unfortunately, that means there is no broth flavour in my fish, and the fish don't share each other's flavours.   The waitress came by and sensed that we weren't enjoying the meal. I wasn't planning to make a fuss, but she asked for an honest answer. I confirmed with her that the Bouillabaisse is cooked separate rather than together. She eventually called the manager who only had the illusion of caring. I think she was trying to be professional, but ultimately was offended, which was obvious when she discounted 20% off our entrees - which, again is a bit fraudulent because that only equates to about 10% of our total bill. All in all, the discount was 11 bucks. She also flatly disagreed with me that the Bouillabaisse was cooked separately, even though I confirmed with the waitress.  I'm not sure how to conclude here. I suppose if someone from Aw Shucks is reading this, please don't be offended. I think you have a great restaurant and a spectacular opportunity, Just don't be passive, take sincere stock of your mistakes, and don't make business decisions that affect the final dish. Get it right and take these reviews seriously. I hope this is of some help."}
{"text":"Good place when you want to have a bit of fun. Drinks are not that bad either. Music is ok depends on who is playing. People are not rude."}
{"text":"Great venue, terrible service and horrible food. I would never go again. Food was bland and not prepared well."}
{"text":"Found this place while wandering and driving by the area.  I give it 3.5 stars based on their food and service.  Another half star belongs to the beautiful rooftop patio. Totally a four star for now.  We walked in and a friendly hostess came and brought us to the rooftop patio (there is a deck patio too but the rooftop caught our eyes) per our request.   We were so happy at first but got disappointed right away after the waitress apologized and told us that there were no oysters in the restaurant yet.  Especially,  it was an oyster special day.  She was not certain but said that the oysters might arrive before 8pm.  It was almost 6:30pm and we were not sure if we should risk the wait.  We ended up ordered the crab cakes and panko crusted scallops. The crab cakes ($13) made very differently.  They were soft instead of crispy.  I was hesitated at first looking at them (and so totally forgot to take a photo).  However, they were not bad at all and very tasty with lots of fresh crab meat.  The panko crusted scallops ($15) came with three pieces of crusted  scallops and a piece of fried rice cake seasoning with vinegar and carrot ginger sauce.  It is a very creative appetizer.  The scallops were fresh and cooked just right.  I like the sauce.  The fried rice cake was a tiny little bit greasy though.  I ordered a white sangria.  It was just ok.  The oyster truck arrived when we were almost ready to ask for a bill.    I will come back again for the oysters and certainly for the rooftop patio before the warm weather ends."}
{"text":"not bad, nothing amazing, service was bland and stuffy, they need to re-hire the staff, and I would love to recreate the menu! the oysters were superb, and one waiter was enthusiastic if you compared him to the rest. there's potential."}
{"text":"Going for dinner it is a great place, however on the flip side the weekend bar scene is simply put, awful. Slow bartenders, no cocktail waitresses and was in the place an hour without a drink. Too bad for them it won't last too long without changes."}
{"text":"I visited here for my birthday dinner. The oyster selection was great, comparable to any oyster bar in Toronto (I especially liked the champagne/dill sauce). My husband had the creole catfish - the perfect amount of seasoning. I had the surf and turf - my steak and lobster were both prepared to my liking. The specialty coffees were the perfect ending to our meal. I'm only sorry we haven't visited sooner. We will be back in the near future. Our server Eric was attentive and accommodating. All in all a great experience. (Curious to return in the summertime and check out the rooftop patio)"}
{"text":"We are visiting Town called Aurora, and this place was recommended to us by a friend.  I have to say dining area is huge and also bar area too.  We were greeted by our server and she was very nice and friendly. I had WYSE Bay Atlantic Salmon bed of wilted spinach, rice pilaf and Chef's choice of vegetables, and finished with lemon beurre blanc, it was incredibly delicious.  And also soup of the day ( creamy potato with rosemary soup) with the must delicious bread. Restaurant and bathrooms area was very clean.  This is definitely place we will go back to."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant 1 month ago.  I heard it was fun and the food was good.  Came a long way to dine here.  First of all there wasn't anyone in the restaurant and it was 6:30pm.  We ordered muscles and they were served cold.  We asked for bread and they ran out so they served us tortilla wraps with butter.  This was astonishing.  I had a ceasar salad which was tasty.  We spoke to the acting manager about the food thus far and he stared at us and apologized for our experience.  We decided not to stay for dinner based on our horrible experience.  We went to the Keg down the street and not only had a fabulous dinner as always but GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE.  I don't recommend this restaurant to anyone."}
{"text":"Server was  ultra friendly and helpful even though we checked in late for lunch.  Food was of great quality,  not only oysters,  but salad was also fresh,  and seafood was juicy. Nice decor,  spacious and quiet.  Has a stage for live entertainment."}
{"text":"Cause you're hot and you're cold, you're yes and you're no...  If you get good service after 10pm in the dining area, hit me up. I've frequent this bar many times and have been so disappointed with the servers.   I've come during dinner hours and it was pretty good. Good food, good service, the whole shebang. I've also come during bar hours and have had a heck of a time getting service in the dining room. Obviously I understand it's a bar and servers are scarce but if you're still serving food, shouldn't the servers be attentive? I waited nearly 30 minutes for a glass of wine. I had to ask for a server twice and eventually went to a manager on duty.   In the rare case where you do get good service, you must try their oysters. They are amazing and that alone is what keeps me coming back. My recommendation is to dine during dinner hours and drink during drinking hours. Don't mix the two like I attempt to.  Secretly wishing another oyster house opens around Newmarket."}
{"text":"Aw Shucks located in the heart of Aurora. Easy access from Yonge Street.   First time at this wonderful Seafood Bistro........ the food was delicious. I had the Lobster Bisque Soup, followed by the Blackened Red Snapper served with root vegetables.and rice........ delicious!!!! Oh be sure to try the fried oysters.very decadent. Does it sound like I enjoyed my meal? You guessed right.  Our waiter was very informative and full of suggestions. While the food and service were good I was disappointed in the ambiance of the restaurant. Should you decide to stay a little later they have a live band that starts at 10:00 p.m. on Saturday nights. Music is definitely for the young at heart. Would I go back.......... you betcha!!!"}
{"text":"Great and reasonably priced lunch menu. Lots of selection especially if you are not a seafood lover. Dinner is more high end and expensive. Great patios as well."}
{"text":"I have been coming to this place for a few years now and again. The service used to be awesome!  There used to be a great selection of oysters available! What happened? The menu is no where near where it was. The selection of food is limited. You have a choice of just two types of oysters.  So disappointing! It would seem they are going the way of many successful places. Start out well. Get a great reputation then skimp and try to save money on staff and offerings.  I hope you have a better experience than me."}
{"text":"Came back this weekend past, and stayed for dinner and the live music afterwards.   Had a delicious burger, small but tasty, decent price for where we were.   My GF had the crab cakes which were a little too salty for our tasting.   It was a friend's birthday party, and Aw Shucks had \"Phoenix\" playing live music.. WOW.  The female singer was phenomenal.   This place continues to grow on me, as I found the mix of people this night particularly friendly, and a great atmosphere.  Staff, bouncers, bartenders all are very friendly."}
