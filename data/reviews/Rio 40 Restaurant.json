{"text":"I like it.  I was invited there by my English teacher and we met each other in the patio then went inside and started with Capirinia (it was an amazing drink). there was a good environment to talk in English and eating dinner. Although they didn't have fish on that night , we enjoyed of two type of food which I can not remember their name. (Picana and Fijuada we think). By the way! I am writing this article beside my teacher because of my test and review together!"}
{"text":"After spending a summer vacay in Brazil I came home hopelessly nostalgic for all things Brazilian: steak, caipirinhas, beans, farofa, telenovelas, and futbol.  Going to Rio 40 is a great way to get a Brazil fix.  Vintage pics of Rio hang everywhere, while TVs are constantly broadcasting Brazilian soaps and soccer games.  It's not one of those design concept restos, so don't expect any of that either! They are experts in grilling their steak, it's not the best cut-- but how they manage to cook it so tenderly is beyond me.  Prices are not cheap but they really go all out for portions in the Brazilian way: tons of yucca or fries, beans, farofa (powdery stuff that adds texture and taste to beans), and meat.  They make a pretty good caipirinha too, if a little on the sweet side.  One time I went on a Friday and they had live Bossa Nova, which was wonderful.  I highly reccommend!"}
{"text":"Just came back from 8 days in Brasilia and a fantastic World Cup. People and food were fantastic. Fell in love with Brazilian food especially the feijoada. Mandioca was excellent every which way I had it. Pamonha was awesome. The rodizio was outstanding. I've just started searching for authentic Brazilian food here in Toronto and Rio 40 isn't it.  They put french fries with everything!!  Didn't see much of that in Brazil. The feijo was good and the linguica frita c/ mandioca was delicious but rest was mediocre at best and not really worth the price. Staff were nice but service was slow and a little poor.  Food was decent and plentiful but overpriced and poor service for simple fare.  Caipirinha drinks were boring and poorly made.   And no wifi...loved that everywhere I ate in Brazil had wifi."}
{"text":"I have been at Rio a fee times. I have tried a few dishes there all delicious. My favourite the picanha  with ananas ( pineapple) and the mandioca.  Food Prices are very reasonable. Drinks prices are good too. Try the Batida or Caipirinha.  Service is not bad, but it can take a while to get a waiter or waitress attention.  Love the food here."}
{"text":"My dish (the skewer of a few different meats) was very tasty. Not a lot of variety on the menu though (meat, meat or meat). The ambience is a bit cafetetia-ish, but might try the patio next time."}
{"text":"This past august 10th I ordered picanha c/mandioca/salAd  And 2 hrs later  my belly was in pain and on an explosive mode..."}
{"text":"Food is great, service is amazing and genuinely friendly towards adults and our children. We'll definitely be going back. Don't miss the caipirinhas!"}
{"text":"Layout,  High exposed ceilings, 2 level split, divided by a brass railing, metal chairs, wooden table surfaces, silver chandeliers, restaurant is a corner unit has an outdoor patio, windows on one side bring in natural sunlight.   Decor, pale tangerine dark chestnut theme. The Brasil national flag, Christ the Redeemer, and large mural of the city of Rio adore the walls. There's a large LCD TV on the far by the kitchen and projector screen.   The place has all the hallmarks of a neighborhood football gathering spot. :)   I opted for the steak picanha for lunch ($18), on the side it came with collard greens, rice, beans, and fried bananas. It was a very balanced meal, fragrant, very colorful looking plate. The food was perfectly spiced and tasty. Capped it off right with a rich decadent slice of custard pie.  The food at Rio 40 was superb!!  Service was good (considering there was only one person working). I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"- They don't serve authentic brazilian food - They put us to sit in the sun, when we asked to change tables they gave us an angry look and said \"changing seats is not allowed\". After a lot of argument, I said \"Either I sit in one of those tables or I am leaving. If you can eat with 36C sun on your head, thats good for you.\" - The Picanha had a weird taste, probably old. - The Madioca is nothing compared to the one from Brazilian Star - Terrible service - That was the worse service I have ever received in my entire life - Last but not least, the food tastes like crap"}
{"text":"I was dying to go after the renovation because this is my favorite restaurant, so we got a table for 4 and I have to say the place looks amazing, but I'm sad to see that the food is not the same. All our meals were salty, but three of us eat it anyway, we just return one plate that was extremely salty.The picanha medium had half part medium well and half well done. The one that supposed to be medium well wasn't cook that way either. The beans didn't taste the same also. At least the caramel pudding and the rice remain the same. This is the first time something taste different, I was loving the place because was really consistent all the time. My family is wondering if they changed the cook. Hope it was just a bad day for the kitchen or the day off for the cook!"}
{"text":"Very friendly staff Large portions of very delicious food Reasonable price , and on top of that  Great terrace good neighbourhood place ."}
{"text":"Love the food and the service!!  I have been told it is as authentic as it gets..  What would make this place 5 star??? I love seating outside but the plastic table and chairs have to go."}
{"text":"So a friend and I decided to celebrate signing up for capoeira by grabing a bite and having a few caipirinhas at Rio 40 up the street.  It was nice warm evening so we sat out on their streetside patio and quickly realized that all the other tables were speaking protuguese. You know the place is going to be good when it attracts all the expats.  We had a few caipirinhas to kick things off. They make them really well but at $6.50 ea, it's a little pricey. On the other hand, they have $4 pints of Horseshoe draft.  The food is not what most Torontonians would expect from a Brazilian restaurant (it doesn't come to your table on a sword served by a gaucho...). This is more like authentic brazilian cusine.  I had the carne seca com mandico (cassava), which is served in a delicious sauce with fried onions. Deeeeelicious!"}
{"text":"I went to their pizza \"rodizio\" yesterday, which is happening every Thursday of this month. For those who still don't know what a rodizio is, I'm saving you a Google search: you pay an amount and waiters keep bringing you food until you say you're full or you explode, whatever happens first.  I was expecting to eat just pizza, but they had a small pasta and salad buffet that was included in the price of $20/person. The lasagna was awesome - of course I didn't try everything because I was there for the pizza, after all.  The pizza slices are smaller than normal so you can try many different kinds. The \"Portuguese\" (ham, cheese, egg, peas and onions) and the four cheese (mozzarella, parmesan, gorgonzola and catupiry) were the best ones, in my opinion.  Please, go ahead and make your reservation. You won't be sorry."}
{"text":"I don't live in Toronto but have been there twice and visited this restaurant both times. I like it a lot and think it is very very similar to what you get in Brazil. Clean, friendly and easy to find."}
{"text":"I love taking my friends here when we want to get something hearty, but I don't want to go very far.   Their Brazilian steaks are the specialty, and they are fantastic, served in large portions with an equally large portion of sides. They used to have this amazing sausage and deep fried yuca(?) side dish on the menu that I dreamt about every night, but I haven't seen it in a while. I'm hoping they see this review and bring it back, so I can die happy, with blood that flows like molasses through my hardened arteries.   The ambiance is almost fancy, with a family vibe. The place is full nearly every night with families, groups of Brazilian friends in their 20s, and Chinese people (we always find a good deal).  In the summer, they have a giant patio that stretches across the side street."}
{"text":"I have only been once but I really enjoyed my meal.  I forget the name but it was basically steak with shrimp, fried egg, fries and rice. All the carbs!   I will not claim to have any knowledge of brazillian food but it seemed the real deal.   The restaurant was very busy with a number of large groups but service was decent.   Portions are large!"}
{"text":"This place has a beautiful terrace in where you shouldn´t miss a caipirinha.  The attendants were mostly Brazilian from all kind of ages, and by listening to some conversations (oops... yeah sometimes I snoop) between the waitress and some of the customers, I could tell that they were regulars, so I got big expectations about the food.   The waitress was really friendly and nice, (she was born in Mato Grosso if you were wondering...) and her service was optimo!!!  The caipirinhas were spectacular and they came quick.  When I saw the menu it was disappointing that they lack some of the icons of the Brazilian food like the feijoada, and that they tried to reach a bigger audience by mixing Brazilian with Italian food... So my aspirations of tasting some authentic Brazilian food started to vanish.  The order was based on some appetizers to share: calamari, shrimps, and some Brazilian cut that was camouflaged like an appetizer, but when it appeared, it seemed more like a main course that would satisfy a cookie monster...  Why am I putting 3 stars? The 3 appetizers came at the same time but they were COLD... We still ate everything because the flavors were good, but when you ask for meat you want it to be juicy, smoking, tender, and hot, not warm, or environment temperature... You want it HOT.  The calamari was great; crunchy, not oily at all, and you could taste that the oil was healthy and not used over and over.  The shrimps had a great garlicky sauce that we couldn't stop eating with the bread. Unfortunately, they weren't hot either... (face looking at the side).  I'm really picky when it comes to the temperature of the food because I love to eat calmly, and because I think everybody deserves satisfaction when they are paying for a service. But when you know your dish has been sitting down it makes you wonder if it belonged to another table who rejected it, or if it could be spoiled, or if they don't paid attention to the customers satisfaction.   I would give them another chance because I liked the amount of food they give, and because the problem was timing."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place, for food. As for the experience unless you are going during a soccer tournament this place is quite, and a tad on the dull side. The wait staff don't always speak the best English, so if you aren't fluent in Portuguese, make sure they know exactly what you want. As for what I'd recommend the picanha Cassava(picanha acebolada com mandioca, to be exact) is fairly priced for the portions that you get. With this meal there is an option of cheese for $2.00 extra if you are a cheesy person like me, add this it makes the dish way more flavourful! And if you are adventurous opt for the Catupiry cheese it is far superior in flavour to the other option(mozzarella).  If you are in the mood for more, they have a beef stroganoff(stroganoff de Frango this comes served in a mushroom sauce that is bursting with flavour. With a side of rice and French fries. The streets are one way on both sides, so look at the map if you aren't from this area to plan which way you will come if traveling by car."}
{"text":"I had a good dinner here.  The steaks were nicely cooked and sided  with pineapple, salad, rice and beans.   At first I thought it would be too big but I finished them all with a glass of house wine.     The patio was very nice on a sunny day like yesterday.  Hopefully, the waiters were more responsive.   I would recommend Rio 40."}
{"text":"I ate here with friends last weekend. I ordered the special (not sure what it was called, I let my friend who spoke Portuguese help me order). It was a garlic steak (cooked rare as requested) with a side of garlic rice and a really good chicken salad type dish. For desert I had the chocolate mousse. It wasn't a fancy dessert but it was tastey. Overall the food and the service was excellent. My only negative comment would be that it was a bit pricey, but not prohibitively so. I would certainly eat here again in the future."}
{"text":"I'm brazilian, and food like this is hard to come by in Toronto. Let me explain better- Rio 40 graus is not fuzion high-class cuisine, but it is also not your everyday 'rice and beans' food. The diversity of the menu -  from more ' traditional' dishes to  pasta and pizza -  makes complete sense in a Brazilian restaurant.  The quality of the cooking is also really good.   I love the physical space. The service was good but not perfect, but then, we did go in the late afternoon of a weekday."}
{"text":"I've been there couple times. My friends bring me to here, at first I had no idea about the Brazilian food. But now I know, I'm glad to know the Brazilian food and the restaurant!"}
{"text":"Great picanha! It's on the pricey side of things, but the portion sizes are good. Staff is friendly and restaurant is clean. Great background music too! I will go back for sure. Not that often though...me, my wife and two little kids (1 and 3)  have to spend around 60 bucks for lunch with no dessert and no alcohol."}
{"text":"Best Brazilian restaurant in Toronto (excluding the \"rodizio\" type of restaurants). The service is great and they have good options for both those trying to experiment new tastes of the world or the Brazilians that are craving for the foods they left behind."}
{"text":"I had my first Brazilian dish at Rio 40 with some of my friends from Brazil. I found Brazilian dish is really interesting, tasty, unique and very filling. I ordered Pincaha Grelhada con Ananas to avoid having all the carbo on my plate. I like the ambience of the restaurant but the service was pretty slow. Gotta improve the service but over all it is good food but it is a bit pricey."}
{"text":"Being there many times.  Love the food. Patio os great in summer. If you are not Brazilian (like me) or not into Brazilian soccer, better try to avoid games night."}
{"text":"I love steaks and their picanha dish with pineapple and sides definitely did not disappoint! I also tried one of their caipirinha drinks and it was sweet and smooth. Great location as well on historic St Clair Avenue West."}
{"text":"My friend invited a few of us to come and try some amazing food and I was so happy to have made it.  All of it tasty and the service was fast and friendly.  First up: Guranna -a soda the colour of a darker ginger-ale but sweeter (pretty good I might add) Caprihana - man this is beyond delicious, made with cacacha, lime and sugar (yup my new summer drink!) Fried Casava - salted and more dense than a fry but must crispier too - yup its GOOOOD! Acarajé - its like a chicken nugget on steroids but tastes way better!  Next, the entree:  Feijoada, this black bean stew with smoked meat, collard greens rice, seasoned forafa is beyond good. Filling and something one must make peace with that they will be taking leftovers home and enjoying later!  Passion Fruit, pudding thingy - it was fresh, tart, creamy and and sweet.  A great way to end a meal all washed down with another Caprihana!!!  Conclusion:  I will be back and encourage you to go if you have not been there!!!"}
{"text":"A quaint little gem on St.Clair west. Brazilian food served up with delicious drinks.   Dishes are protein focused, and very reasonably priced. Steaks, seafood, you'll find it all here. What i especially like are the drinks - both alcholoic and non. I haven't had fresh passion fruit juice in years, and this might the be first spot outside of China town that I've found serving it.   I'll be back for casual nights with friends."}
{"text":"The Brazilian style pizza at Rio 40 is quite good. We went for the Palmito Com Milho ($13) with mozzarella, corn, hearts, of palm, onion, and oregano because it sounded the most authentic. Out of curiosity we added catupiry cheese -- a mild and super cream Brazilian cheese -- to our pizza for another $2.50. The crust was flavourful and thin though not crispy, there was a ton of cheese and the catupiry was a great addition, and the corn and hearts of palm were unique and tasty.  We also tried the Fried Cassava ($6) which looked exactly like something out of a frozen McCain's bag but were actually excellent. This was my first experience with cassava and it tasted somewhere between french fries and fried plantain.  Definitely try the fresh juice. We tried the guava and the passion fruit, both were amazing."}
{"text":"This place is not nearly as good as the churrascarias in Brazil but when I crave something Brazilian, this is as close as it gets in my area.  My favourite are the croquettes (kibe, coxinha and bolinho de catupiri, which is a type of cheese but not unfortunately, it doesn't taste like the real thing). These come in 6 and are good and filling appetizers.   The best meat are the espetada de picanha and picanha grelhada. The meat is not the tenderest I've had but they are tasty nonetheless.  My least favourite entree is the stroganoff de contrafile.  It tastes closer to a curry than the real thing in Brazil.   They also have a Guarana, which is a pop in Brazil that you can't get anywhere else. All in all, this is a place that I would recommend and will continue to go back. The service is courteous and friendly."}
{"text":"Can't say if it's authentic or not, never been to Brazil yet. But my tastebud is telling me is good! The steak was alittle over cook, the lime caipirinha is delicious. Can't leave out the wonderful staff!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and excellent service.  Shared the brisket for an appetizer between 4 adults; not only was it delicious but plentiful ... even had some left over (which rarely ever happens anywhere when sharing appetizers) .... But glad we left a bit of space in our bellies as the mains were AWESOME, and again plentiful. 2 of the party had two different steak, beef dishes; both raved. And the other person and I had the shrimp stew. If you love seafood, get this dish!! There was an insane amount of shrimp, so much so that we even had some left over to take house.  Alas everyone was too full from dinner to try desserts, but rest assured, we'll be back to try that and more.  My compliments to the chef and our waiter - wonderful dinner out."}
{"text":"With just one waitress working during lunch shift at Rio 40 Restaurant, resulted in unbearable slow services....  I was standing at the entrance waiting to be seated for over 5 minutes.... and then waiting for a while to have my order taken... but after that our food did arrive quickly...  Grilled Pork Loin served with Rice, Beans, Collard Green and Fried Banana ($15) is quite good... just the pork definitely on the dry side and a little bland when compared to the Picanha - Rumpsteak ($18) which is tender and smoking delicious...  And even for lunch, my DC has to order a Pudim - Carmel Pudding ($4.50) as he loves sweet... The pudding is smooth and silky... really enjoyable.  Just a little confused why they have an All You Can Eat Pizza and Pasta Thursdays? I would rather enjoy all your can eat grilled meat in a Brazilian restaurant!"}
{"text":"We ordered \"feijoada\" which come with rice, collard green , sweet orange and farofa. The bake bean pot is very huge portion and very testy. ( 16.5 CAD) . This menu is a special menu which have only on Saturday. Highly recommended. The place atmosphere is nice and cozy. Waiter have a friendly smile and good service . I didn't order any dessert because the main corse already filled my stomach.  I ordered a fresh orange juice which I think it is really good. It is sweet and tasty unlike orange juice in some place which come from topicana. I would rate this place to be one of my favorite brazillian place. Will come back again."}
{"text":"I know and eat great traditional Brazilian food, so I am hard to please, but Rio always delivers ;).  First of all, their feijao has to be some of the best. I love the fact that it's traditional black beans, the only thing that is a downer- the fact that the farofa is almost $3.00, should be free considering it's farofa, who has beans without it?!!!??  My friend and I decided to go to rio yet again last night on a Sunday. We got there for 7:30 and there was only a couple of tables of people which we found odd at first but then we remembered our fellow Brazilians only like to eat dinner close to 8-9pm (which is exactly the truth because by the time we left at 9, there was a full house).  They start you off with some delicious toasted garlic bread- different but delicious and I had something to eat with my left over beans (improvise!)  I decided to switch things up a bit (usually I order the picanha) and went with the peito de frango com molho de cogumelos (grilled chicken breast with mushroom sauce)- served with rice and french fries.  AMAZING. I am not joking when I say it looked as if I licked my plate clean- nothing was left behind.  My friend got the bitoque but with chicken, hers was served with a fried egg (the now chicken with ham on top), fries, rice and salad. She also loved her meal.  Portion size is large, so come on an empty tummy.  Service was good, our waitress was kind and sweet, There was a mix up on the wine for our bill (over charged) but it was an innocent mistake.  Rio never disappoints in my opinion- will obviously return. ;)"}
{"text":"Something different, yay!!!  I've been to Brazil (only Brazilian restos =P), but a few of my friends are Brazilians and they say it's authentic... I take their word for it!!  So my past Brazilian food experience were waiters with skewers of grilled meat.... VERY DELISH, but Rio 40 is different!! It's more authentic (and less gimmicky)!!  Drinks - caipirinha (sugar cane rum) was quite good!!   Food - ordered a pincanha, linguiça, carne seca and iscas de peixe (all traditional Brazilian appies). Everything was very tasty, but rather dry. Large portions!! We were like four people sharing these and still couldnt finish everything...  Location - Bathurst and St-Clair (where I'd like to call the latino square)!!  Venue - pretty accommodating. We had a large group of 20. And it worked out fine!!  Staff - the girl who served us was very friendly and knowledgeable. Adorable!!  Look forward to checking this place out in Summer, on the patio..... Must be fun!!"}
