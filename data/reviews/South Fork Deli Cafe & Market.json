{"text":"Tonight was our first trip here and we will be back for sure!  We had the bacon sandwich and the pulled pork.  Both were excellent and so fresh!  We both had a beer and enjoyed the selection that they had to offer.  Neat little find in Cramerton, seems like it belongs in the South End of Charlotte!"}
{"text":"We left the Charlotte Airport in search of a restaurant for lunch using the Yelp app. South Fork did not disappoint with it's 5 star rating. The employees are friendly and the food is PHENOMENAL! Each of our party ordered different dishes and all were spectacular. We had the braised pork sandwich, parmesan crusted grilled cheeses, the bacon sandwich and the soup of the day. The food is fresh, flavorful and made to order. We loved it so much that we came back four days later on our way back to the airport. If you are in Charlotte this is a must! So thankful to have found this little gem in a charming town. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"In town on business and was looking for a place to eat close to our hotel.  After getting lost due to a closed road, finally had the pleasure to dine here.  Meal was excellent!  Split a meal with colleague, buttermilk fried chicken sandwich and the pulled pork sandwich.  Would have given the 5th star but the buttermilk fried chicken sandwich had a little too much mayo sauce for my preference, next time know to order without or on the side.  Pulled pork sandwich was one of the best I've had. Meat was very tender and flavorful.  Beer selection was amazing and be sure to save room for dessert!

Owner Chris was crazy helpful and so personable. Will definitely go back next time we travel through Charlotte!"}
{"text":"My wife and I were looking for something new a few months back and stubbled across this place ... Wow !!! What a great find !   The people are awesome the food is amazing and if you like beer like I do ... You need to get in the car(start it) put it in gear and bring your thirsty self to the south fork deli cafe! Don't ask questions just do it ... Seriously it's great !!!"}
{"text":"Over two days we had the white bean burger, iron skillet chicken sandwich, chicken and dumplings, house salad, turkey not so rueben sandwich,  a 9.7% imperial stought on tap, and mamas lil yella pilsner. All delicious. I would try everything on their menu having the chance. Dozens of different beers and wine, daily soup specials, and kids eat cheap I noticed. Clean friendly and hip. I wish there was one in Little Rock, they'd do well there... or any other location for that matter."}
{"text":"Exceptional food!!! We have eaten here 4x's in the past month and have great quality each time! The chicken sandwich is Da BOMB, as is the french dip! They have a great beer selection, the setting is nice, & the service is pretty good--only because they are ALWAYS busy! If fewer people or more staff & bigger place--but do not be a hater cuz you have to cool your jets--the food is frickin good!!!!"}
{"text":"ONE WORD.....AWESOME!!!! excellent food, incredible beer. I have now found my favorite place."}
{"text":"A friend recommended to go try South Fork for lunch - it is great! We had the Reuben sandwich and Quiche of the day - both very delicious. And we can't wait to return for more another time. It's a casual relaxed deli / cafe with a good selection of daily soups and a range of sandwiches to suit any palate. Plus there's a good selection of beers available too! Highly recommend"}
{"text":"One year has passed since we found this place and it's still awesome. You won't be disappointed. Love it."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING!  Only open for a few days, but service is great and the staff is very friendly and excited.  I have had the unique opportunity to try many of the dishes already, and cannot say enough about the quality, freshness and taste of the dishes offered.  I will be back as often as I can.  Please support this great local business!"}
{"text":"If my Dad likes a place, you know it has to have good service and not too expensive. We had 6 in our party and everyone was super happy with there sandwiches. The sesame soy kale is an excellent side dish for 2 bucks!  And they didn't charge extra for more sauce.  The seasoning is why the chef hits the mark on all dishes!!  Art is cool too!"}
{"text":"First visit.  My party had a grilled cheeses sandwich and a white bean burger at 4:30 p.m. Portions were large, and they were fresh and delicious!  So hot I could hardly eat at first--and I like that. Two meals, two soft drinks, twenty bucks!

We'll be back though we live in Lincolnton!"}
{"text":"Unprofessional work environment.
The owner Chris prides the restaurant on being a friendly place but only keeps on employees that give the customer a cold front. The food is great and not too pricey but the only reason that's feasible is his high turnover rate. He hires someone worth hiring and then fires them once he finds someone cheaper."}
{"text":"Amazing food. I had a tandoori chicken flatbread sandwich which was perfect. My new favorite meal."}
{"text":"Found this place while looking for Goat Island Disc Golf Course. I got the shaved beef sandwich and it was really good! I love the look and feel of the deli. Reminds me of The Common Market in Charlotte. I was also excited to see that they have quiche and a daily soup. Looking forward to coming back. Can't wait to tell people about this place."}
{"text":"Food was freshly prepared and well presented on the plate for a fair price. Only drawback was time from entering door, to ordering line, to food on table, was plus 40 minutes with only ten people ahead in line, but, a large take out order was going through at same time.
Will go back, just not if having to be on a tight schedule."}
{"text":"What a fantastic find! The goat cheese and fig Blt was amazing! Every thing we got was fantastic.  Great live music."}
{"text":"Amazing! If you ever been to Common Market in Charlotte, this is very similar but much more spacious and not so hipster.

It's a local business supporting local businesses. They have lots of local brews, juice, sodas, and a good selection of wine in the back of the establishment. Just recently they added beers on tap so I'm a very happy girl. 

Bread from Noda and local produce. We're halfway through their menu but it's hard to try something new when you have multiple winners. To name some favorites is the salads, seafood bisque, chicken and dumplings, tomato basil soup, slow braised pulled pork sandwich. Their cast iron buttermilk fried chicken sandwich is huge! I love how they prepare squash, carrots and zucchini. Food is made fresh to order so don't rush them, it's worth it.

Great place to hang out with friends outside the big city. Thank you South Fork for venturing out here. It's a very welcoming addition to gaston county."}
{"text":"Sadly South Fork has officially closed as of 4/30/16. The owner will be opening a new place, Luna Hombre in Belmont soon. South Fork consistently had some of the best food and service around; it will be missed in Cramerton!"}
{"text":"We have only been there a couple of times.  The atmosphere is a little loud and laid back (very cool).  Everything we have ever order there has been great!!!!"}
{"text":"Very sad to hear Southfork has closed.  Was one of my favorite restaurants around, we have enjoyed the atmosphere, staff, service for over a year and a half. Just went there last week and didn't know they were closing. Glad to hear about Luna Hombre in Belmont.  Hope it has similar menu and vibe."}
{"text":"Buttermilk fried chicked sandwich and vegetable spaghetti was outstanding. Prob some of the best chicken ive ever had"}
{"text":"Such a blessing to see in the improving and quaint town of Cramerton! Everyone was helpful and OH MY GOODNESS, the food. Wowwwww. One of the best meals I've ever had. The white bean burger (begin hallelujah chorus). All fresh and well prepared. The bread wasn't stale like most places. My boyfriend had the jalapeño cheddar bacon quiche. All well portioned too--not too heavy and clean. Pray this place continues to blossom without losing the quality. Highly highly recommend."}
{"text":"Stopped in tonight for my first visit. I didn't have high expectations before walking in, just assumed average deli style food. I ordered the ribeye sandwich, and it was without a doubt the best I've ever had. My girlfriend had the white bean veggie burger, and she was speechless. It was her favorite veggie style burger she's ever had, and she has a lot of them! (Vegetarian) 

The environment is nice and laid back, with some good art work and great beer selections. 

Bravo to a deli style restaurant done right."}
{"text":"Delicious!! Everything was super fresh. Our group had a Goat Lettuce Salad, Roasted Chicken - Chicken Salad Melt and a Jalapeño Egg Salad Bacon Sandwich - all three of us were EXTREMELY happy with our selections. Worth the short drive from the interstate. Will definitely go back. Note: portions are HUGE!!"}
{"text":"We went for dinner last night and everyone had a wonderful time with wonderful food. The decor is great and their beer/wine selection cannot be beat. (70+ bottled beers plus drafts). I had the Parmesan crusted grilled cheese with tomato on sourdough with a side of vegetable spaghetti. It was amazing! It was the crispest grilled cheese I have had in my life, and the three cheeses inside were perfectly melted. Our two picky kids loved their meals (one got grilled cheese and one got chicken skewers).  There was a guitarist outside and the music was wonderful, and dog friendly (even a large water bowl outside for doggie customers). For 4 adults and 2 kids (one adult beverage per person and pop for the kids), our meal was just over $55- we felt this was definitely reasonable!"}
{"text":"Great place to eat but don't ask for and extra table spoon of dressing for your salad. It will cost you .80 cent. That's just wrong."}
{"text":"I visited on a Friday evening about 6. We were able to sit right away; we did feel a little confused as we did not know to seat ourselves. 

After ordering, the food came in a reasonable amount of time. I got the slow braised pulled pork sandwich and it was delicious. I feared that it would be doused with barbecue sauce as the menu reads \"with applejack barbecue sauce\" but the sauce was minimal. The pork was juicy, tender, and went well with the brioche bun. As a side I had the baja slaw; I'm not sure what made it \"baja\" but it was still good.

The only notable drawback is that it is loud in there. If I lived in the area, this would probably be one of my regular spots."}
{"text":"Awesome!  The atmosphere and the food make this place really blend together.  It is in small town Cramerton which right at this moment it monopolizes the strip with it's amazing food and craft beer selection.  The deli (as us locals refer to it) has innovative sandwich and food art involved in every dish.  Authentic sides as well as friendly and knowledgeable staff regarding beer selection.  My only gripe is fall beer selection is limited.  I hope next season it is more plentiful!  You cannot get better food, Anywhere!  I am a huge fan of the bacon sandwich and the grilled cheese.  Yes, the grilled cheese is one of the best menu items.  The blend of cheese on sourdough toast with parm crust and tomato bisque is awesome!  Salads are great also.  Plenty of homemade dressing selections.  Dessert is to die for!  So if you are looking for a hippy place with great music, great atmosphere, vegan and vegetarian options, gluten free options (even the beer) then this is YOUR place!"}
{"text":"Thank you Yelp for an excellent recommendation!  My BF works in Gastonia and we have lunch on Friday if I can get out that way. We've run the gambit of Gastonia food (sorry G, it's a lot of chains or just Yuck buffets ).  This place is fantastic, fresh is the word. I had the tandoori chicken wrap with potato salad. Still full and that was 4 hours ago, no seriously I had to come home and take a nap. They have a nice selection of wine, beer and oddly enough Sake. Only had 2 issues and they were minor. Entrance is confusing, no indication that you go up to the counter and order and salt. Good grief, what is the deal with the fear of salting the food? Other than that, top notch and cheap!
Tip: There's a cute little 4 top table in the wine room in back."}
{"text":"This place has only been open since August 2013.
I got the Buttermilk Fried Chicken sandwich and it was AMAZING. They also have a great beer selection. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"This is our favorite spot near Gastonia. Everything is good. Absolutely love the salad dressings and the tomato soup."}
{"text":"Great place to eat, I'm glad I came across it. Service is friendly, establishment is clean and food is superb. Food is on the pricier side for this area and for being a place that you just order at the register but it's fresh and tasty. We got bbq sandwich, potato salad and a cold tasty beer on tab overall very good!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!  

It has wonderful staff, that seem to truly care about this establishment.  Orders are taken courteously and food is delivered promptly.  Everyone is friendly and polite.   The owner is the cook and does an AWESOME job! 

The place has plenty of seating including outside seating.  Chairs are comfy.  Everything is super clean.

Food is DELICIOUS!!!!!  We got hummus plate, salad, and a burger and didn't want to leave.  We are so glad to have this place in Cramerton!!!!!"}
{"text":"My daughter and I had lunch today and we were not disappointed. Great menu and picked up some IPA's while we were there too!"}
{"text":"Thank god, a restaurant where a prissy white girl can sit down for lunch with her stuck up mom and organic, vegetarian sister on this side of the Catawba river.

I likey the hipster & eclectic atmosphere.
In this case, Slow Food = Good Food.

I just wished the delicious brownies were hash :P 
Can't wait to go back :)"}
{"text":"Completely delicious! The chicken dumpling soup was up to par with grandmas recipe. The kale and black eyed pea sides were fresh and perfectly light. I'm so pleasantly surprised with this place! Everything was quality, really tasty and made with love. I also like that they use biodegradable take out boxes. 5 stars plus!!"}
{"text":"Believe the hype!  I have to agree that this place is somewhat reminiscent of an over the top common market.  Although, they have a much stronger focus on food, while still having a pretty solid beer selection.

Buttermilk skillet fried chicken sandwich with a free side of veggie pasta and pesto.  The veggies weren't all separated perfectly, but that is literally my only complaint.  An absolutely great sandwich and side for under $10.

I normally don't brag about my service so much, but feel this just needs to be mentioned.  The young girl behind the counter was straight up running this place.  If she wasn't taking order with a smile she was busing tables.  Then she rewrote the specials board, then started sweeping.  Just straight up on point the whole time, without anybody telling her what to do.  I'd love to say that she had to know I was a yelp elite and was just showing off, but I didn't check in till I was walking out the door."}
{"text":"Only had the tandoori chicken wrap and the baja slaw. Both were absolutely incredible."}
{"text":"Love their desserts! Cute place to have a bite. They are pet friendly on the patio and had fresh water for our collie. A plus!!"}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere of this place. I do wish they had a soda fountain because I'm not really into beer, but I'm sure for beer people and the business's revenue stream, it was a good decision. The menu is crazy awesome and I'm dying to try more things!  I've only sampled 3 so far. The hero, my bf got which he was impressed with. The shaved prime rib with au jus I got was pretty good but the BEST was the buttermilk chicken sandwich. Zomg. It was sooooo good. I got the low country seafood bisque as my side and wished I had ordered a gallon of it. It was incredible. My friend tried the Isle of Greek chicken sandwich and loved it, and that's my plan for next time!"}
{"text":"We've been here probably 5 times.  Each time we have tried something different and each time the food has been amazing.  Mostly, we've tried the sandwich selections.  Think high-end, top quality sandwiches.  Writing this review is making me crave one.  The misses tried a seafood soup and grilled cheese one night and the soup was better than any she crab soup we ever had in Charleston, SC.  For the mister, he really enjoys the muffuletta.  We both enjoyed the spicy chicken wrap that has a fancy name and will rival any Thai summer roll for freshness and taste.  Prices are typical for a deli sandwich plus side.

It's sort of like a fancy Common Market as you can buy beer (local craft beers mostly) and wine by the bottle out of coolers near the back.  Very hip.  

The owner is the chef.  He's very energetic and always greets us with a wave.  He's a cyclist as well so you know he's a good guy."}
{"text":"Best thing to ever happen to Gaston County. Food is excellent, the restaurant is modern, and they have a great beer selection. Great soups!!!"}
{"text":"Wow! Great music & great food & cool vibe at this little hole in the wall! Had the club and it was fantastic def will be back when I venture back this way"}
{"text":"I wish I could add a few stars!! Need a good food fix and South Fork did not disappoint me. Tummy full, tongue enjoyed the flavors, nose the aromas, ears great tunes, skin comfy!! And my Spirit is happy too! 
 Thanks Clif"}
{"text":"I ordered Egg Salad BLT and Vegetable Spaghetti... Food is good, but not great.
Because they use a cup to serve the Vegetable Spaghetti....the top of the vegetable spaghetti has almost no flavor. The bottom part tastes good.

If the bread on the Egg Salad BLT is a little bit thinner, probably it will be easier for eating it. Otherwise, it is too tall to bite into."}
{"text":"Great place to eat & drink! Great selection of beer & wine. The food is reasonable & tasty. Located in the small downtown of Cramerton. It's a gem. Cool decor too!"}
{"text":"In an area where it's hard to avoid chains, South Fork Deli tops my list of recommendations when folks ask for a place to eat. The first 5-6 times I came, I got something different, and was never disappointed. Everything is fresh and prepared when you order it; the wait staff is friendly and ready with a suggestion if you're  indecisive. While you wait, peruse their great beer and wine selection, and don't forget to save room for dessert."}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite go-to spots.  They definitely have the best food around with a casual atmosphere.  I've had the spicy pimento, the chicken salad melt, and the cast iron buttermilk chicken sandwhich...all amazing.  I also love the veggie spaghetti.  Even the ice water is great at this place! :)"}
{"text":"Good beer selection. Had the fig and goat cheese BLT which was to die for. Side salad is really high quality too. They have hummus listed as a side which I would've loved, but it doesn't come with pita or veggies or anything to eat it with, so I'm not sure what the point is. Service was prompt and friendly, and prices are reasonable. The outside patio is great on a nice day. They make a point of NOT providing wifi, so bring a book or a friend."}
{"text":"This hidden gem..I tell I'm glad I found it.. Great food & live music on weekends..what more can u ask for."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants. This is a pleasant addition to the mostly chain restaurants that are in Gaston County. The food is locally sourced and prepared with creativity and attention to detail. Everything is fresh and fabulous. They have a nice beer selection and a wonderful atmosphere. One reviewer called the area \"run down\" but I would not call it that at all. Cramerton is a quaint little mill town that is currently undergoing a lot of revitalization."}
{"text":"Great food and great beers.  Chris does an awesome job on the grill.  Has the tandoori chicken and my wife has the cast iron chicken. Both melted in your mouth.   Absolutely worth trying to find this hole in the wall."}
{"text":"While in town for work, myself and two coworkers had dinner at the South Fork. There were so many yummy looking options on the menu it was a tough decision, but I had the Goat Greens salad with herbed roasted chicken. The salad was huge and very tasty, with a great white balsamic dressing. Also had my favorite local beer, Red Oak, on tap and a large wine selection. Coworkers had a pulled pork sandwich that also looked amazing, and a Tandoori chicken wrap that was reportedly yummy but could have been more substantial. Good place for some healthy but totally satisfying options. Will def be back!"}
{"text":"A little confusing set up and menu for first time visitors but the food is awesome and the girl at the counter was very friendly and helpful :)"}
{"text":"Over 100 5-star ratings and every one of them is deserved! It's a good thing I only work in Gastonia and live in Charlotte, otherwise I'd eat here way more often than my wallet and waistline would appreciate! I have tried the majority of the menu items and I cannot pick a favorite- they are all amazing! 

The menu is diverse but not overwhelming, eclectic and inviting! Typically, when I order from South Fork I am placing several orders for coworkers at the same time (sometimes as many as 12), and the staff handles the orders with ease; we have never had any issues whatsoever with orders or charges. 

I love finding local gems like South Fork and they will continue to receive my (and my coworkers') patronage!"}
{"text":"This little gem is tucked away in Cramerton. Good wine and beer selection, terrific food, and great atmosphere. Try the vegetable spaghetti with any of their amazing sandwiches. Salads are also wonderful. I've never had a bad selection at South Fork."}
{"text":"This is a great place to eat and fellowship with family and friends. Great service, friendly staff. Highly recommended next time you want to catch a bite to eat. Wonderful selection of wines and beer! Eclectic yummy food choices One  of my favorite places."}
{"text":"I agree with Candace, that the BLT-Egg Salad sandwich has killer-sized bread.  I prefer to eat \"bun-less\" options, but I really wanted to try this item, just this once, as it was intended.  Thanks to other Yelper's photos, I knew what I was in for.

The whole sandwich, top-to-bottom, is first-and-foremost, fresh and high quality food!!  The egg salad was perfection.  It was simply perfectly-cooked eggs and a generous quality and quantity mayonnaise.  So it was nice and moist.

It was not nastied-up with chopped pickles or other items to try an distract from a lesser quality mayo, or less fresh preparation.

Toward the later part of eating the sandwich, I opted to open it up, and just eat the egg salad and bacon, to trim a few calories, and spare my filling stomach.  It was at that point that a truly appreciated the jalapeño bacon.  Prior to that, I could not get as much flavor, or heat off it, since the egg salad tones it down (actually buries the flavor).

The chef-owner is quite impressive, with a full restaurant, he was cranking out the food from his grill, with the help of a sous chef, plating, a cashier, a couple of server/bussers.  We had to wait close to 30 minutes for our food, after the order, pay and sit process.  No doubt, you will get fresh and hot food.  If you are really hungry, as I was, and asked to have my side salad ahead of time... too bad.  They serve it all, at once.

A final impression... the meal was so substantial that it lasted me from lunchtime, until a later evening dinner.  That's hearty!

So, long story short (LOL) plan ahead, but it's a quality of food that's worth the wait."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, decor that is similar to Common Market (but much cleaner)!  That is just the start, the food was excellent! The Thai crispy noodle salad, BLT, grilled cheese, and tomatoe soup of the day was awesome!"}
{"text":"Place to be proud of having in the neighborhood. Soup, sandwiches and such. Good variety of healthy options and good local beers - no brainer."}
{"text":"This place is the go-to for my husband and I! Everything is so fresh and locally grown, and the staff is nothing but nice! I've never had anything there that I didn't like. Taco Tuesday's never disappoint!"}
{"text":"Very quaint place with good food, good service and an awesome beer selection. Really like stopping here for a Friday lunch or a Saturday beer. View of the park and river are nice. Try them out."}
{"text":"Great food. Had the hummus sandwich with black eye peas salad.  My wife had white bean veggie burger.  Enjoyed both.  Good portions and food was excellent.  Good selection of beers.  Had two outdoor tables where we sat with our two dogs. The staff was excellent and very attentive."}
{"text":"With an excellent selection of soups and sandwiches, not to mention a wide array of beer (great divide yeti!) which would please the snobbish of beer snobs, this place is a must try! I've been here twice now and just love the atmosphere and cuisine. The owner Chris is a cool guy as well! Very passionate about craft food and beer. The receipts really convey this as well so go check it out!"}
{"text":"My husband and I hit this place for a late Saturday lunch; I had spied the patio on a prior visit to a nearby restaurant and wanted to give it a go.  We were there well after the lunch rush, close to 2pm and the service was slow.  Here you order at the counter and even though there was only one person in line before us to order we waited nearly 10 mins just to place our order.  But, this gave us time to choose our craft beers from the very decent selection in the back cooler--which you can drink there or purchase and take with you.  I had the grilled cheese/tomato bisque combo and my husband had the shaved ribeye.  It took another good 20 mins to get our food which I thought was a lot considering they weren't busy at the time.  My husband loved the ribeye; I thought the grilled cheese was little bland but the soup was excellent.  So overall the food was really good and worth the wait, and we enjoyed the quiet patio seating.  Even though we were a little put off by the wait I feel like it could have just been a fluke, the customer service and friendliness of the staff countered that and we will definitely be back to try it again!"}
{"text":"I found this place via yelp. It has a 5 star rating so even though I don't typically give 5 stars, they did nothing not to earn it.  You will find it filled with friendly locals. I came for taco Tuesday.  Lucky me  and had vegetable spaghetti as my side.  What a relief to have healthy options.  It's an unassuming must stop."}
{"text":"Best in the region.  Everything is fresh and made with quality ingredients.  Great beer and pop selection too."}
{"text":"Came here for a late day lunch and was again pleased tremendously! I tried their bacon sandwich which was served with peppered bacon, fresh mozzarella, apple butter and lettuce and tomato on toasted sourdough. The difference in the flavors from the peppered bacon to the apple butter to the creamy fresh mozzarella all came together perfectly! My side was the sesame soy kale...a favorite of mine! And today I actually tried there soup of the day. It was a tai soup. Made with a base if coconut milk with tons of veggies (carrots, onions, cilantro, garlic, red peppers and much more) and pulled chicken in it! The flavors were great! I'd try it again and recommend it to anyone. My only issue was that the cashier wasn't very friendly at all. And in this small little town is not usual, might have just been a bad day. Ugh....either way this places food speaks wonders!"}
{"text":"Surprisingly awesome little joint in a quiet, Southern, sort of run down area (I don't live 'round these here parts). Very cool ambiance and menu. They've even got a wide selection of great single beers for sale in the cooler. Felt like it should be in Plaza Midwood in Charlotte. 

The lemon poppyseed cake with fresh strawberries has a light, fluffy frosting that even frosting-haters will enjoy. Seriously good. 

Only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 was my underwhelming Isle of Greek chicken. I don't get the flatbread thing because you can't wrap up and secure the bottom with flatbread and all the juices and guts fall out. I don't love when tzatziki sauce gets hot like it did with the chicken in this wrap either. However, fresh ingredients and it was definitely REAL chicken which was nice and flavorful. 

Definitely check it out."}
{"text":"Yes its true...., they are closed.....who closes an amazing place, with amazing reviews, and that did an amazing business!,,,,,, crazzzzzzzy......on the positive, they are opening a restaurant in Belmont, working on it now......sign said, they wanted more time with family...."}
{"text":"Gaston County is really moving on up in the restaurant department. South Fork is one of the reasons why. We have been a few times at this point and have never been disappointed. Their food is delicious. I really like the Parmesan crusted grilled cheese with the tomato basil soup (the soup of the day on Saturdays). My husband said the steak and cheese is probably the best he's ever had. The buttermilk fried chicken sandwich is delicious. 

Even the sides are really good - we've had the vegetable spaghetti (I know, it sounds strange, but trust me on this - try it. It's basically long strips of veggies like zucchini squash and carrots cooked like pasta with olive oil, Parmesan and herbs.) And the guy talked us into trying the kale, which normally we wouldn't get, but it was tasty! 

There's a good beer selection, all of it in the fridge, so you can grab whatever you want to go with your meal or take home. Lots of tables too, good family joint. 

The food here is made by somebody who cares, and I don't say that a lot. They take pride in what they do and it shows. So glad to have this place in my backyard."}
{"text":"I came here explicitly because this place was rated five-stars. FIVE! And any Yelper worth their weight in a single mayorship knows that five stars is dang near impossible. 

So while I was parked in front of another local hot spot, when I saw this place had five red stars staring me in the face, I put my car in reverse and proceeded straight here.

That was an unfortunate mistake. This joint has a great atmosphere and good tunes, but that's about where the positives end. The food was subpar (I had the Goat Cheese Salad with Chicken Salad) and all of the drinks are kept in a refrigerator behind the counter much like how a pirate keeps his treasure. That means if you like anything but water where you have to hand scoop your own ice into a bar glass nestled in a rack beside the water can, you're sorely out of luck. As was I after completing my meal which cost me $16 for some insane reason - $8 salad, $4 chicken salad X 2.

There are a lot of great reviews on this place, so maybe I just wandered far too far from home for lunch today. And in that, I'll leave the five-starers to keep this place afloat, because this is one mayorship I know the weight off. About that of a goose."}
{"text":"I've been a few times and have never been disappointed.  Gormet grilled cheese, tomato soup roast beef sandwich, chicken salad, spaghetti vegetables....all fantastically yummy.  I've never had enough room to have dessert but I'm sure whatever they offer is just as great.  Portion sizes are large!!"}
{"text":"The location is perfect if you want to walk your dog at the park and stop by for a beer and a sandwich. They always have an excellent selection of craft beer, wine, and sake. And the food is cooked to perfection with cast iron skillets; my french dip featured ribeye steak with a horseradish aioli, melted cheese and au jus on a roll from Nova's Bakery. 
They even have live music on the patio weekly."}
{"text":"What's not to like?

My fig, goat cheese, BLT sandwich was wonderful.

My veggie spaghetti side was great.

They stock Zapp's potato chips.....my favorite.

Great selection of draft beers, and an even better selection in the chiller. Lagunitas IPA....yum!

Prompt, friendly service.

Clean. Open. Airy. High ceiling. Restaurant with outdoor seating, and GREAT MUSIC!!!

Good desserts, although a little pricey at nearly $6 per slice of cake. 

They have SEVERAL of my favorite foods on the menu: quiche, muffalettas, pulled pork sandwiches, rib-eye sandwiches, fancy pimento cheese and grilled cheese sandwiches, etc.

I'll be back, soon, and often....."}
{"text":"Wonderful food! Great atmosphere! Had the egg salad jalapeño BLT with vegetable spaghetti. Oh my, so good!"}
{"text":"Absolutely fabulous!! We had the shaved prime rib sandwich, the Greek chicken, the Fig & goat cheese sandwich and the \"special\" of the night-grass fed beef burger. 

Every single sandwich was amazing. 

The prime rib was tender and delicious. It had just the right amount of horseradish. 

The burger was tasty & tender. You could taste the freshness.

The potato salad was delicious! 

LOVE LOVE LOVE this place"}
{"text":"The consistent five star reviews do not lie. Throw this one in the pile.
Outside: cool retro and modern at the same time - love the logo of the goat eating a sandwich - outdoor patio seating to the right.
Inside: to the right = six beers on tap (including one from NODA = Coco Loco Porter and Natty Greene Buckshot Amber). Straight ahead - the counter - order and take a number (just let them know if you want a beer/drink from the cooler). Back and to the left - the wine and beer section - plenty of local favorites, microbrew sodas including Virgil's and Abita root beer and San Pellegrino. Look up and you'll see a four foot wide border made up of six pack holders. Great art work and mix and match tables and chairs.
To eat: Goat Greens ($8) - awesome salad with spicy pecans and fresh goat cheese on greens with white balsamic dressing - savory and refreshing at the same time. Spicy Tandoori Chicken sandwich on flatbread ($8.25) - on the sandwich - julienned veggies, fresh basil and cilantro with pickled onions. Really good - the flat bread is a bit on the thin side and the cilantro and basil fight each other a little bit - one or the other might be better. The side of veggie spaghetti grilled with olive oil and herbs is a really clever, delicious and healthy side. My kids had chicken skewers and grilled cheese ($3 each) and a side salad ($2); they cleaned their plates like Hoovers.
So, we went on a Saturday when the line was long and steady and only two were visible in the open kitchen. Did I mind waiting 20 minutes for my food? When I have a frosty Natty Greene's in my hand, and the food tastes so good, the answer is NO.
Can't wait to go back and try the Shaved Ribeye...."}
{"text":"Yummy! Great food & an awesome selection of beer! Great atmosphere! Only downside is they serve soda by the can; no free refills!!"}
{"text":"We eat out often, at many levels and types of restaurants, including internationally.  We have eaten at the South Fork Deli at least 20 times in the last year,as it is quite near our home.  The food is consistently excellent.  The variety on the menu can't be beat.  The prices are very reasonable.  It has a fun vibe and a nice beer and wine retail area (no corking fees).  The local tap craft beers are always good, with frequent price specials. Service is quite fast and the staff is always personable."}
{"text":"I'm thankful for Yelp because I would have never found this place. This has become my new favorite place for lunch and dinner. The chicken sandwich is Hugh. Cut it in half and share hubby. The coconut chocolate is so moist it falls apart before it reaches your mouth. The place reminds me of a Charlotte NODA style restaurant. Good food and surprisedly low prices. The owner is a chef and it taste and looks like a chef prepare your meal. I will continue to drive 25 minutes to come here."}
{"text":"This place has fantastic food and a great family environment! My family and I enjoy this place and it is one of our favorites around the Belmont Mount Holly area!"}
{"text":"Amazing Fig and Goat cheese BLT. The slow cooked BBQ was good. The zucchini spaghetti looks tempting but its pretty bland, it's missing spice or peppers or something."}
{"text":"Totally worth the drive off the interstate. We had the not so turkey reuben, pimento cheese sandwich, jalapeño bacon grilled cheese and buttermilk chicken sandwich. All were the excellent, and the beer selection was very good as well. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Great fresh food.  The salads are really good.  This food is above average. They are sourcing local fresh ingredients and it shows in the quality and flavor of the dishes.  You must try this restaurant if you like really good food.  I personally feel like this is the best food in gaston county."}
{"text":"Wow this place was delicious.  We flew into Charlotte to go to the Nascar race in Bristol and my fiancé found this place through Yelp.  We were surprised by all the 5 star reviews and wondered if they were actually this good.  Well, they are.  If I could give them more than 5 stars, I would.

I ordered the egg salad with jalapeño bacon sandwich thats served on a grilled focaccia.  I could have eaten another whole sandwich while I was sitting there.  I couldn't stop thinking about it for the rest of the trip.  For my side, I picked the baja coleslaw.  It was also tasty and made me want more when it was gone."}
{"text":"Delicious isle of the Greek sandwich and potato salad. Very nice place to sit and eat."}
{"text":"Yelp you are always right... Thank you for sending me to another wonderful 5 star food meca!  Sure it's out of the way a bit and the stupid one way roads around the place are a pain, but the South Fork is worth the battle.

We got three sandwich plates and everyone of them was super amazing. The portions were just right and the flavors were so fresh. I wish I was a local so I could try them all! But since I'm not I will make sure every time I come to the area this place is going to be at the top of my list. See you soon Sough Fork!"}
{"text":"First time going was yesterday.  We ordered the buttermilk chicken sandwich and my mom had the bacon sandwich. Plus  we had black eye pea salad and potato salad. 
Everything was just delicious. And the people are  very  friendly. 
We will be back"}
{"text":"Great location. This was my first time here. We went with another couple who highly recommended this place. Parking was ok to find. We came at 730 and they were packed. Line was almost out the door and there is one girl at the counter who was shuffling between taking orders as well as taking phone orders. We seriously waited almost 25 minutes just to place our order. 

They have a self serve water station. They have a great selection of drafts as well as plenty of beer to pick from. I got the tandoori chicken wrap. with the new potato salad. Wrap was very good and flavorful. My only complaint is that there wasn't a lot of chicken in it. New potato salad was good. My husband got the shaved ribeye sandwich. I wish I would of gotten that instead! Meat was tender and the au jus with it really enhanced the flavor. He got the veggie spaghetti and really enjoyed it. I tried my friend's verde soup and I was pleasantly surprised at how good it was. It was spicy with all the good veggies in it. 

I would definitely go to this place again!"}
{"text":"Had to try this little gem this morning after reading the consistent 5 star reviews! And boy I wasn't disappointed... Had the recommended buttermilk skillet fried chicken and black eyed pea salad! For sure a do over for Saturday lunches!"}
{"text":"fantastic craft beer selection, as well
as tiny miller high lifes. working with local farms when possible, there isn't a thing on this menu that I don't want to try. good vegetarian options and the dessert counter was full of very homemade layer cakes for your grandma's recipe book. don't pass south fork by!"}
{"text":"The food was here was very good.  Or was a little hipstery but they played Bob Marley so that added to the atmosphere.  I ordered the shaved steak sandwich with the potato salad.  The potato salad want that great but the sandwich was great.  Wife ordered the fried chicken sandwich which I think was the best one they had"}
{"text":"Definitely top notch, in Gastonia for a funeral and yelp led us to a great spot. I had the cast iron buttermilk chicken, I was a little worried as I don't care for buttermilk. However this was an awesome sandwich. Just great!  My wife had the fig and goat cheese blt it was very good but couldn't touch the chicken SW!  Glad we stopped, was hot outside so we sat in, being older we like to talk but music was loud enough, but ok. Was a little wait after order but I felt it takes time to put these SW together!  Was well worth the wait, will be back!!"}
{"text":"Great food! Made a quick trip out and it was just what we needed. Filling and healthy. You can really see the care and thought that has gone into this place. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"First time try monday just before closing. Extremely friendly service answering all our questions even volunteering beer specials. Wife and I both had turkey reubens, she had slaw and I had veggie pasta. Everything was just awesome. Most reubens are a bit wet but not these. Great spicyness with a nice mustard. We will be back. Cool place visually as well."}
{"text":"Worth driving far out of your way to come here.  I've had two excellent sandwiches here on gluten free bread. Plus they have plenty of other options and an extensive amount of beer and wine plus some bottled ciders."}
{"text":"The food here is awesome ! The shaved rib eye sandwich is tasty ! The fried chicken sandwich is divine ! The pork sandwich is epic ! Every sandwich my family has tried here has been epic ! The soups are awesome too. Can't say enough good things about this place !"}
{"text":"Awesome food and more kinds of beer than I want to choose from. We had the \"Goat Greens\" salad, egg salad BLT, black-eyed pea salad, veggie spaghetti, and the quiche of the day. Very nice atmosphere and music."}
{"text":"Great space right in front of the river. It offers tasty craft beers in bottles, cans, and draft. Tons of local brew. I had the buttermilk fried chicken. Made to order, it was crispy and tasty, with a slightly sweet mayonnaise dressing. The warm crispy fried chicken went really well with cool dressing. To top it off, it had a sweet roll bun. Yum-oh. Nice side options- try out the sesame kale! Great sandwich to have with a cold beer (I had the Mother Earth IPA).  They had salad options too, which I will have to try my next time around!"}
{"text":"This place is consistently one of the best casual dining establishments in the Charlotte/Gastonia  area.  We're lucky to have it here in Gaston County.  The whole atmosphere at the restaurant is laid back and inviting and very unique.  The beer selection is great.  The owners of this restaurant are obviously very experienced.  The sandwich selection is simply awesome.  I had the Isle of the Greek Chicken with a side of Black Eye Pea Salad.  AMAZING!  Salads are great too.  It's a gem."}
{"text":"Well - Yelp dod not steer me wrong on this one! We were in the area for 24 hours and we made this our lunch stop. The staff was friendly and the food was great. I had the buttermilk fried chicken sandwich with black eyed peas and Aimee had the egg salad & bacon sandwich with cole slaw. She was still talking about her sandwich on the plane today!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for late lunch based on Yelp reviews. A little off the beaten path but well worth it. Excellent food. Interesting menu, great selection of beers, reasonable prices: all equal a great meal."}
{"text":"This place rocks with great food, nice selection of beer and wines, very eclectic, wonderful specials. Nice relaxed atmosphere inside....for what it is, promises, and does it deserves 5 thumbs up!  Would LOVE TO SEE HIM COME TO MOUNT HOLLY!"}
{"text":"Back again after our first try just a couple days later.  Fantastic service and awesome food with some local brews.  This is exactly the type of food you leave Charlotte to find.  We need more of this type of place.  We had the tandoori and Greek wraps first go round, cast iron fried chicken the second...oh can't wait for the third time."}
{"text":"We stopped on our motorcycle trip based on the Yelp reviews. Awesome little place with great food and neat atmosphere. They had a good selection of salads and sandwiches. Everyone in my party of 4 had something different and we all loved it!  It was very busy but they seemed to keep it moving. The food took a little long but everything seemed to be homemade. They had a great selection of beers. They did not have WIFi. They had a sign that said grab a beer and enjoy your conversation."}
{"text":"I had heard only positive things about this place from friends and family before, so I knew I had to check it out. They couldn't have been more right. I LOVED this place! First, the atmosphere is perfect. This is usually a place I would find in Asheville or NoDa, but somehow it's hiding in Cramerton. It feels like a friendly hipster that you would actually want to hang out with. I didn't order any beer, but it seemed like they had a pretty good selection. I got the bacon sandwich even though I was a little hesitant that it had apple butter on it. Somehow it was AMAZING. The apple butter added just the right amount of sweetness to the salty bacon and I couldn't get enough of it. I had the soy sauce kale on the side, and it was really good too, although I'm a kale fan...so if you don't like kale it won't change your mind. My only (small) gripe would be the kids menu. They didn't have any type of fruit or raw veggies to order so if you have picky kids like me, you might be in trouble. Other than that, I really couldn't get enough of this place and can't wait to go back again."}
{"text":"Delicious chill place!  Egg salad jalapeño BLT was a wonderful blend of flavors.  We enjoyed OMB Mecktoberfest while chowing down.  My husband enjoyed his Buttermilk Fried Chicken Sandwich and would order it again.  We will be back!"}
