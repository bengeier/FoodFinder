{"text":"This place has it all: a huge menu that's perfectly executed, loads of vegetarian/vegan options (yet plenty to keep the meat-eaters happy), local and organic options, and quick service... and all the while they keep the prices appropriately cheap for a diner. 

I've found everything there to be tasty, and the place is always clean. Their Heathen Vegan Shoplifter's Delight sandwich is possibly the best thing I've ever tasted. The only downside is that I'm always too full to try one of their great looking desserts!"}
{"text":"If you have children you do NOT want to go here.

We went to the Blue Plate this afternoon for a late lunch after sledding at Olbrich Park. We were waiting for a booth and were invited to go to the counter so we could be seated immediately. Our four year old son sat down next to a heavy set women eating lunch. She proceeded to remark, \"I don't want to sit next to a squirmy kid\" and the hostess behind the counter look at us like we were bothering her and how dare we bring a four year old to the counter. It was uncomfortable and rather rude.

If you are not a tragic hipster or if you have kids, do not bother going to the Blue Plate Diner. The Daisy Cafe is right down the road is is very kid/family friendly. The food at the Blue Plate is mediocre at best and atmosphere stinks."}
{"text":"I just love Monty's for breakfast. I've taken the parental units there twice, and they agree. The ambiance is great (if a wee bit noisy): a throwback to a classic, 50s-era diner, with the requisite neon lighting, \"lunch counter\", and bar stools. The portions are huge, so this is truly \"brunch\"! So far I've tried the chilaquiles and the breakfast burrito (yes, I like my Mexican/Southwestern fare!). Both were fantastic, especially when paired with a Mimosa. The menu is extensive: from  humble \"bacon & eggs\" selections to omelets and elaborate ethnic creations. 

If weekend brunch is what you have in mind, I'd suggest arriving early--as in, no later than 8:30 a.m. After that, you'll likely have a long wait. (In the meantime, you can ogle the impressive bakery case.) The staff are friendly, and the service is fast. Despite its location in the busy Atwood neighborhood, I've never had issues finding parking at Monty's. The only slightly negative comment I'd make is that the booths, although they can accommodate 6 people as far as width is concerned, are a bit on the tight sight with regard to the distance from seat back to table. I'm a thin person, so I can imagine that this might be uncomfortable for those with a stockier build. 

Monty's is my new go-to breakfast joint. I highly recommend it.

Be sure to check in on Yelp for a free bottomless coffee!"}
{"text":"I came in here with my mother a few weeks ago and the experience was positively wonderful. It was my mother's birthday and the blonde manager gave her a complementary piece of pie. She still mentions \"that sweet girl with the pie\" and the salmon hash (amaaaazing, try it) to this day. Thank you for great food and a great time!"}
{"text":"I love this place.

I have gotten so many things on this menu that I can't even go into it in a limited space.  Everything has been addicting, delicious, and exactly what I needed at the time.  A few must trys: artichoke sandwich, grilled cheese with tomato soup, turkey club, pesto omelette, and GBLT.  Also, their cranberry muffins will completely change your life.  Best muffin I've ever had...and my mom makes a mean batch of blueberry muffins with crumble topping.

Also, I'm not sure why some people are saying the service is not that good...I've NEVER had a bad customer service experience.  All of the servers are extremely nice and will do whatever they can to give you exactly what you need.  They are always so much fun and I'm actually friends with a few of them now because I go so frequently.

Go to Monty's. NOW.  You will NOT be disappointed."}
{"text":"Went here with the family for lunch and was amazed! The food was very flavorful and the staff was so friendly. Also, the coconut cream pie was delicious! Would definitely come back here soon."}
{"text":"This place is so close to my house and I've been meaning to go to it for a long while, however I've never made it inside until a few nights ago.  Usually my husband and I will try to go for brunch but it is always VERY crowded.  The other night my friend and I decided to stop in for coffee and dessert because the chocoletarian had just closed.  We came in at about 7pm on a Sunday and the place was all but desserted (pun intended :).   We had turtle cheesecake and malt pie.  The cheesecake was dense and sweet, I'd give it 4 stars.  The malt pie was bland and tasted nothing of chocolate nor malt, 1 star.  The waiter was sassy and chatty which added to our diner experience.  For a Sunday night coffee and dessert spot Monty's has earned 3 stars."}
{"text":"One of my favorite brunch spots in Madison.  Good vegan and vegetarian options as well.  I'm a meat-eater and have had one or two of their all veggie dishes and been very impressed (I like the tofu scrambler)  Another favorite is whatever the scrambler of the day is.  Good reuben for lunch too."}
{"text":"The food is just good. I appreciate the variety. Consistency of quality and quantity is a problem.  Service is hit or miss. Great option for entertaining with lots of varied food needs and/or kids in tow."}
{"text":"Breakfast places are generally my favorite types of places to dive into in new cities simply because breakfast is my favorite meal of the day.  

I'd never been to Madison before and I must say it's a lovely city.  Of course we were there in late May when the temperature was a balmy 67 with nice breezes throughout.  

Monty's was good, very good, in fact.  So good that we went there 2 days in a row.  We were traveling with some vegetarians and they were able to find tasty eats on the menu as well.  

There was disappointment in their version of eggs benedict which had a mornay-type sauce that really tasted burnt.  Like burnt crap, actually.  Maybe I just don't like mornay sauce but ugh.  

Coffee was good, we tried some of their desserts and enjoyed the diner atmosphere from our cozy booth.  Well done, Madison, well done."}
{"text":"Ate here for my first time today and wow was it delicious! And not to mention fairly priced. They feature everything from all day breakfast to comfort food dinner entrees, creative sandwiches and soups, and more! They have a vegan menu for those interested and a wide variety of desserts. I will be going back!! If you haven't tried it yet, I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here since I was in middle school and it was the cool place to hang out on half-days. 6 orders of waffle fries, anyone?

We went last night for an early dinner and squeezed 7 people into a booth. I got blueberry pancakes (LOVE breakfast all day) and they were okay.  My friend's french toast came with apple butter though, and slathered on top of the pancakes = much better pancakes.  Around the table there were also a few types of burgers, a meatloaf sandwich, a fruit plate, and a whole lot of milkshakes and sundaes. Big let down: they were out  of over half of the mix-ins for the milkshakes/sundaes. You can't have a dirt cup without gummy worms!

Overall, I've always liked it here. Service can be hit or miss. Food is pretty good. Milkshakes are hurt-your-teeth sweet."}
{"text":"The host was top notch. The place was busy and he just directed that madness like Ditka in the 80's. The food was not memorable in the slightest. My girl ordered the Saturday special which was biscuits,sausage gravy, eggs and potatoes for 8.99. I ordered the two egg breakfast with a side of this sausage gravy and not only did I get more food but the cost was 2.65 cheaper. She felt ripped off as it was overpriced and biscuits implies two biscuits not one. Also whatever spice they dump on the potatoes leaves one with a mangled palette. Service was fair though I was out of water for over 10 minutes. Overrated in all aspects in my opinion. Im from Charleston,SC and somebody needs to visit there to learn a few things about making it right. Madison itself is a jewel!"}
{"text":"I had a wonderful experience at Monty's. My server was incredibly kind, attentive, and friendly. He could not have had a more pleasant demeanor. The food was also quite good, and the prices are great. I ordered the breakfast burrito and enjoyed it very much. I would definitely go back to Monty's"}
{"text":"Awesome dougnuts!
Great place to take the grandparents--there is something that everyone will like.
Great coffee.  
Nice new 'local meats' section of the menu."}
{"text":"Monty's is obviously a popular and beloved place, judging by the number of reviews, and rightly so. Hard to beat the combination of an old-school setting and really good food. The only knock against it is the crowds, especially for weekend breakfast. But do make an effort to have breakfast there sometime - the donut French toast is fantastic. They also have great pies and desserts, and they do all the diner standards really well."}
{"text":"My favorite used to be the DONUT FRENCH TOAST...It's no longer on the menu but I'm pretty sure they'll make it if you ask. Otherwise, go for a whopping slice of drumstick pie!"}
{"text":"Yum & cool. Zucchini pancakes! Feeling like you want retro? Monty's is the place.  Madison has the best food, this place is should on your list to try."}
{"text":"The meatloaf in every form is superb. There are three options, meatless, sandwich, and entree, and they are all 'of the gods.' Absolute favorite place."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I came for breakfast and were seated promptly.  It took a while for the waitress to come over with waters, but it was busy and she had tables with food coming out.  Once she did come over, she was extremely nice and asked if we wanted anything to drink.  We got some coffees and ordered a donut to share.  They have 3 types (glazed, sprinkles and cinnamon-sugar) and we got the glazed donut.  It was delicious and well worth it.  For breakfast we ordered the corned beef hash which was pretty good, although I wish the potatoes were a little burnt.  My girlfriend got eggs morney, which she enjoyed.  When the waitress brought our check she also found a coupon for a free donut and coffee which we appreciated greatly.  Altogether, the food was good (and there were plenty of menu items that I wanted to try) and at a great price (nice food to dollar ratio in both quantity and quality).  The servers were friendly and thoughtful and we will be returning again."}
{"text":"What an eclectic menu for a diner!  The ambiance is just what you would expect from a classic 60's diner.  I had a ruben and some fries and it was really good!  Most places use processed corned beef.  Theirs was real sliced beef...very tender and very flavorful.  Probably the best ruben I have ever had.  I had to try the pie too since they tease you with a great display right when you walk in.  The French silk was really rich and chocolaty.  Definately worth the stop if you are in the area or passing through."}
{"text":"Stopped here with family based on the reviews and were not disappointed!
I loved the variety on the menu including breakfast all day. I had the \"meatloaf of the gods\" others had Monty burger, BLT, Mac n cheese and kids had French toast.
All was super tasty and we loved eating outside.
I was only sad I was too full to try the pie."}
{"text":"Two thumbs for a great vegan menu. The vegan hash was really good. The vegan milkshake was delicious and huge. 
Fast and friendly service. Also kid-friendly."}
{"text":"The food was fantastic and the staff was extremely welcoming. The cook even came out and told a few jokes. I will return whenever I pass through Madison"}
{"text":"Food is consistently good. We often go for weekend brunch. I'm from NJ, which has a lot of 24 hour diners. This is one of the only places in Madison that offers breakfast all day, so it's great in my book. Don't come if you mind long lines or kids; do come if you like yeasted doughnuts!"}
{"text":"My wife and I used to come here years ago when we were in school. We came back for a weekend and thought we'd see how it held up. In a word: GREAT! We weren't vegans when we used to come here but are now and I'm happy to say that Monty's has a bunch of vegan dishes. And vegan pies. Holy hell, vegan pies with vegan ice cream. Super good. Will be back whenever we're in town."}
{"text":"The 'Heathen Vegan Shoplifter's Delight' is probably the single best sandwich I have ever had in my life. Make sure to spring for the waffle fries with it. Oh my god! This is what I get pretty much every time I go.

They also have really good vegan pancakes.

The servers I have encountered have always been extremely friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"I like Monty's food--breakfast, lunch, and dinner are all very good--but I just can't help thinking that it's overpriced when I go there.  It seems like it should be diner-priced . . . but almost $9 for a grilled cheese seems a bit steep to me.  Their desserts are to die for, though."}
{"text":"Very cozy and retro, really cool neon lighting fixtures. Really great mac&cheese and quesadillas. They have a lot of vegetarian and vegan dishes. They have a good beer selection with quite a few local beers to choose from. Really delicious pies and the other pastries, ice creams, and milkshakes sound good."}
{"text":"Honestly, I can't see what the fuss is all about with Monty's.  It's certainly a staple of the Madison community, and the food is decent, but I find it overpriced, and the waits too long for the quality of the food.  Classic diner feel gives it a slight bump, but really, I think it's an average place, with average food."}
{"text":"Meatloaf with red wine gravy and amazing mashed potatoes, followed by the best bumbleberry pie ever. Best place for comfort food. Did I mention the pie??"}
{"text":"Everything here is amazing! Casual retro diner setting. The vegan/veggie selection is almost as big as the meat selections. Alcoholic milkshakes are great for sharing. I really like the outdoor seating and I've been there when they had a live band outside. Not a single complaint about Monty's! A favorite of mine."}
{"text":"Though the service was great, the food hot, and the coffee bottomless, I still considered Mickeys to be a disappointing breakfast because I felt their food just lacked flavor. I went for the salmon hash and think there was 1-1.5 ounces of salmon to go along with all the unseasoned potatoes. Just not very much balance or texture differences to standout enough.

Again, the place has a cool retro feel, folks are nice, prices aren't bad-- but I won't be back because the food just doesn't do much for me."}
{"text":"What a good find! Discovered this place after going to Olbrich Botanical Gardens and looking for somewhere close for dinner.  They have a little of everything, and it's all excellent! Not the cheapest, but great value for money, and all staff were very friendly and efficient!"}
{"text":"I love this place! They have amazing cheesecakes, breakfast options and yummy sammies. My favorite thing to eat is the grilled chicken and goat cheese sandwich! The flavors are so fresh and work well. I also love to sneak raspberry cheesecake when I am done ;)"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I had my 11 year-old granddaughter for the weekend.  We found street parking near the diner. We put our name in for a table and had to stand in a very small area at the front of the restaurant (along with many others) to wait.  I know most breakfast places are busy on Sunday mornings, but we waited almost 40 minutes before our name was called. Once we were seated, it took a while before we even had water on our table.  We reviewed the menu, and made our decisions.  This place has a vegetarian menu, but they have all the Veg items on the regular menu, so not sure why they needed a separate menu. We each had a different menu item.  We all agreed the food was good, but nothing outstanding. Our server was slow, but apologetic.  Having more servers would be an option to speed up turnaround. I was told this was a popular place, but I'm not sure what makes it so popular.  If you don't mind waiting, this place is great.  I personally will look for a place with more seating so I don't need to wait as long."}
{"text":"Food was really good!  We were able to eat outside which is a plus when traveling with a dog. 

We had breakfast for dinner. Biscuits were amazing and I highly recommend the Florentine."}
{"text":"Been here a couple times now and its my go to diner for breakfast in Madison.  
The prices are really good, the food taste really good/fresh, and there are lots of classic and original options.
I really like the sweet potato hash and they have a great collection of pies.

It won't blow your mind and there can be a wait sometimes, but a really solid diner."}
{"text":"Traditional homemade diner fare with many vegan and gluten free options. Everything is good here from the coffee to the soup and everything in between. Great waitstaff and counter folks there too."}
{"text":"An old stand-by for me. It's not extraordinary, but it's usually quite good and pretty filling. Usually get very good service, but not always. 

My favorites:
Heathen Vegan (although it seems to depend on who makes it)
Chicken in a Pie  (be sure you are able to take a nap afterward though)
Blue Plate Special Omelet (biscuit quality varies)
Homemade Granola (the best!)

Not as good:
Mac and Cheese, Reuben, Chicken/Bacon/Goat Cheese, Artichoke Sandwich, Sweet Potato Hash.

I love both their regular and their waffle fries. Always seem to be perfectly cooked.

Coffee is usually weak, but at least it's bottomless.

Their blueberry pie was my favorite. I say \"was\" because they apparently took it off their menu. NOOOOOO!!!!!! I've been fed various lines by the waitstaff during different visits -- that it's seasonal, that they only have it certain days, etc. -- but alas, it appears they've removed it permanently. :("}
{"text":"My wife and I have been here twice and have loved it each time!  This is not only a nice place to go if you're craving something vegetarian.  They have great sandwiches and bowls that are enjoyable,  The pies are usually fantastic!  So many choices...I don't think you can go wrong.  For a place that looks like your classic greasy diner, it offers a more home-cooked feel with a veggie vibe.  Definitely worth checking out!"}
{"text":"The food can be good here (not great but good) but the biggest problem for me is the AWFUL service.  Somebody teach these people some customer service.  I swear that the guy who waited on me the last time I was there was high.  The interminable waiting for refills on drinks and the check drove my blood pressure through the roof.

I've determined that the secret to getting good service from anyone here is to be a hot looking college girl...  that seemed to keep the waiter's attention focused on the table next to mine...  Maybe she was one of the more positive posters here."}
{"text":"Such a fun spot!  The service is always wonderful, absolutely wonderful!  I am a bit of a health nut but my father absolutely loves it at Monty's and they are always able to accommodate my silly veggie demands.  Love you, Monty's!  Keep being the nicest guys in town :)"}
{"text":"I came here for the first time for a friend's casual birthday dinner, and I was pleasantly surprised. Their food is tasty, but not too greasy or heavy. There is definitely the typical diner vibe, which I liked. The serving sizes are generous, and the flavors are there."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in Madison. You can never go wrong with an artichoke sand which and some crisscuts (they are worth the extra money)."}
{"text":"Great diner--breakfast, pie, milkshakes?! Always a good experience. I recommend getting the breakfast burrito it is delicious."}
{"text":"Such a fun place to get an interesting plate of great food.  The neighborhood is awesome and you can see it in their customers.  Great selection of pies,  and will take suggestions on what to offer.  Love their raspberry cream pie! May seem hipster but this is the real deal."}
{"text":"Came in for brunch today and had a very nice experience.  I really like their décor, classic diner style.  I got the Meatloaf and oh my goodness it was so AMAZING! The homemade gravy was to die for!  My friend got the Egg Mornay I didn't try it but it looked delicious.  Our server Eric was also amazing! I will definitely be returning soon, for a first time experience I give five stars! 

As a side note as we were walking out every single employee that we passes said, \"Thank you, have a great day.\""}
{"text":"Awesome food, very friendly to vegetarians and omnivores alike.  Service is a bit spotty.  I took my wife and two young kids here while on a short trip to Madison.  Every dish we had (vegetarian hash, chicken breast with salad, mac and cheese for the kids) was superb.

The slice of lemon meringue pie we shared for a dessert was also incredible.

And it's comparatively cheap.

This place would have gotten 5 stars except the service when we went was slower than we would have liked and they somehow gave away our 3 year old's mac and cheese."}
{"text":"Strengths: 
-easy parking
-outdoor patio
-vegetarian-friendly menu
-attentive service and unending coffee refills
-air conditioning
-proximity to bike paths
-lots of comfy booths

Weaknesses: 
-they could only *almost* find the gluten-free menu and weren't sure what was in some of the sauces
-the women's bathroom was about 120 degrees and stuffy
-desert options looked non-existent for the gluten-free crowd, though I didn't look very closely

It was still a fun place to have brunch with a friend, even if I ended up drinking way too much coffee.  I had an omelette and it was fairly standard.  Apparently people say it's overpriced for Madison, though since I live in San Francisco, I'm not really one to say.  

I would have happily given another point if only the staff could have found the gluten-free menu."}
{"text":"My dad and I both had the Heathen Vegan Shoplifters Delight. Basically portobello mushrooms, tempeh, and avocado. Amazing. Great section of vegan and non vegan options. Loved it."}
{"text":"Fabulous, just fabulous. Service is spectacular and food is beyond amazing. The wait was awhile, maybe half an hour or so but totally worth it. The breakfast burrito, salmon hash and potato and zucchini pancakes are delectable."}
{"text":"Since I moved out of the area, I miss a lot about Madison.  One of the things I really miss is Monty's.  I made a point to bring several friends here and their assessment of this diner-gone-upscale was good as well.  The food is diner classics with an updated touch as well as a few things that are probably best described as new American.  The food is excellent, especially the numerous vegan and vegetarian options.  The ambiance is clean and bright; the service good.  The only downsides are that the wait can be long, especially on weekend mornings, and parking is limited."}
{"text":"I like this place because they have so many vegetarian options. I loved the vege BLT with strips of tempeh yummy :) I love the atmosphere of the place as well. I do think their prices are kind of high, but the food hits the spot!"}
{"text":"I have no idea what kind of Michelin 4-star restaurant some of these reviewers are used to, but their poor ratings of this Madison staple are not to be taken seriously. 

Coming from someone who's worked professionally in the food industry for the better part of the past decade, in bars, cafes, diners, organic kitchens, and hotels, this diner-style family eatery will always remain one of my absolute favorite places to go, for any meal of the day. This, more than any other restaurant in Madison, is what I missed when we moved away. 

Let's review:
1. One of the most creative, delicious, varied, and comprehensive vegetarian and vegan menus I've ever seen, especially for a place that specializes in heartwarming diner-style dishes. I'm a dedicated omnivore, and my favorite things to order off the menu were the Heathen Vegan Shoplifter's Delight, and the Zucchini Potato Pancakes (both vegan).
2. The person who complained about the terrible service...I have no idea what she was talking about. In the 4 years I lived in Madison, I ate there on an average of once a month, and my servers were always friendly, responsive, and as prompt as could be expected during varied levels of busy-ness. 
3. The cook regularly comes out to chit-chat and joke with the customers. It's always a treat. :)
4. They work hard to support local farmers, with dedicated local and organic specials featuring produce, meats and dairy from area growers. 
5. Their homemade biscuits are to DIE for.
6. Try the pies. And the cakes. Do it. If you can't eat another bite, take a slice home. I promise, you won't regret it!

I've never had a disappointing meal there. I miss it like a long-lost lover."}
{"text":"Always a solid choice. Well made food, family atmosphere, but the menu really doesn't change."}
{"text":"Another one of my weekend staples. Monty's is the best diner in Madison--mainly because of their great vegetarian selection (they have a whole vegetarian SECTION...a relieving site for hungry vegetarian eyes.) My carnivorous friend are big fans of Monty's as well, so it's not for vegetarians only. I like their overall ambiance and their waitstaff is good if not great. The deserts are a MUST. Their shakes are really something to drool over, and their pies and cakes are delicious as well. Oh, and scrumptious breakfasts!"}
{"text":"Been going to Monty's for years! Recommend asking about the day's \"scramble something or other\" for breakfast! Exceptional diner! Fun!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch about a month ago and was expecting a good meal, but I was mistaken.  My burger was dry and way overcooked and the waffle fries (which I payed extra for) were soggy and greasy.  May give them another chance to redeem themselves."}
{"text":"I ordered the Vegetarian Hash with tofu scramble (vegan). Came with a side of toast and vegan butter. Food was delicious and service was excellent. Very impressed with the number of vegan items on the menu- especially for breakfast/brunch items. I will absolutely be back to try other items."}
{"text":"Monty's is basically a shiny Denny's in the heart of Madison's Atwood neighborhood.  On the plus side, you won't leave the diner with an empty stomach. 

The portions are generous, potatoes seasoned just right and the servers keep your coffee fresh.  It's not worth waiting more than 30 minutes to sit, but smaller parties of 2 to 3 can get in relatively fast.  Decent menu selection and the pies look good by the counter...but saving room for pie is a challenge."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants ever! 
I love the diner atmosphere & I've never ordered something I didn't like. I love how many vegetarian & vegan options there are- including the desserts!! 
The pie is outstanding...half of the time I come to Monty's it's just for pie."}
{"text":"We love this place! The food is great. The biscuits which I love the most is the best! I love the coffee. I come here once a week with my in laws and two sons. This is our spot in Madison for comfort food. It's just family friendly and the prices are great. Who doesn't like a hot cup of coffee and comfort food :) Yummo to this place!"}
{"text":"I've been in Madison for 10 days or so and I've made this observation: Madison residents are spoiled rotten! ROTTEN! There is nothing like Monty's back home in Boston. I dare all you haters visit its counterpart in Boston, the South Street Diner. Have a meal there and report back to me. I will have a hankie ready to wipe away your tears of disappointment. 

At Monty's today, I accidentally dumped sugar all over my french fries. Even though I'm clearly a stupid klutz, they gave me new fries anyway. My chocolate malt was perfect. Once I slurped it all up, I felt a little sad...and then I discovered there was ANOTHER malt waiting for me and I felt like a winner!

And believe it or not, I'm a connoisseur of vegetarian reubens. I've tried them all over the country in CA, RI, MA, CT, NY and Monty's in the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"Funky 50's vibe... Staff was excellent and educated on ingredients and choices. Really the some of the best food I've had in Madison at a veryy reasonable price."}
{"text":"This place has classic American diner written all over it.  I have yet to have even a subpar experience at this place.

\"So, tell me abou the food\" you ask.  I've been to Monty's for breakfast, and lunch and have had a consistently great meal every time.  The breakfast menu offers up your standards.  Heaping portions of eggs and bacon accompany a decent cup of coffee early in the morning.  

Their sandwiches are delicious and massive.  The burgers offer a unique collection of flavorings and are made with beef sourced from Black Earth Farms... a big plus from any foodie in the city.  Definitely break the bank and opt in for the waffle fries... and by break the bank I mean scrounge your pockets for the extra quarter the cost.  They are YUMMMMMY

The only knock I have on this place is the overall vibe.  The staff always goes above and beyond what I would expect, but the whole 50s diner scene never really held a special place in my heart.  Even with saying that, I'll definitely be back many, many times."}
{"text":"Monty's, Monty's......I love you Monty's. I love your grilled chicken salad. I love all your sandwiches. I love the coffee and fountain drinks. I get frustrated when the wait is long....and I'm sorry..the pies are beautiful and the fillings are delicious, but the pie crusts are NOT flaky. You can't have a pie without a flaky crust. It aint fitting! I wish you would open up a Monty's in Fitchburg! I love you Monty's!"}
{"text":"Holy Delicious!!!!!!!!
My omelette and my husband's pancakes were DELICIOUS.  My mom said the same thing about her egg sandwich.  I didn't even see what my stepdad ordered, it disappeared so quickly, so I'm guessing he liked that, too.  
Our server was sweet and quick.  She overheard my husband say it was my birthday and she told me I get a dessert for free!  I got this frickin AMAZING tin roof pie to take home, which I inhaled later that evening.  IT WAS SO GOOD WITH THE LITTLE MARSHMALLOWS OMG.  
Only complaint, and I'm really trying to find something to gripe about here, is that the high chair for my baby could have been cleaner, and some of the other diners...... the senior citizen crowd....... seemed very crabby which was slightly annoying.  
Staff here is great!  Food is the BEST!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Monty's is AMAZING. I've lived in Madison most of my life and only just discovered them. Breakfast all day, and an EXCELLENT staff! Very polite, prompt, and friendly. The breakfast potatoes and biscuits are the best breakfast food I've ever had in Madison!"}
{"text":"Try going there and NOT getting a piece of pie. It's hard.

They know what they are doing, and there is a reason that their pies are the first and last thing you see when you visit."}
{"text":"Have to add my voice to the chorus of MBP lovers.  I somehow missed this place in the many times I've been to Madison until a few years ago.

Great food, lots of vegetarian and vegan options.  They have breakfast all day and quite a few hot veggie sandwiches.   I finished my meal with banana cream pie, but they have vegan fruit pies and ice cream treats."}
{"text":"Food Fight has another faux classic diner, but at least it's a style they know how to do right. The white and blue booths are a treat to the eyes and the wide variety in the menu is a delight to the stomach.

As usual, I focus most on breakfast. They have comparable goodies to the Westside's Hubbard Ave, which does me well. I will have some of my favorite meals no matter which side of town I live on. Like most places, service is rough during the rush hours. Either come real early or real late.

And pies. Get some pies. Any style apple will be great."}
{"text":"I've been going here for years and intend to go for many years into the future. The menu has plenty of vegetarian and vegan options, all well prepared. Staff is always enthusiastic and coffee is abundant. I have omelets a couple times a week -- the Blue Plate with tofu substitue -- and on Saturday either the grilled spinach salad, the vegetarian 'meatloaf' or the goat cheese crepe."}
{"text":"So nice to see so many veg & vegan choices. But really- way way too much turmeric in the tofu scramble! Say it with me: nutritional yeast! Use it! Also great biscuits by the way. :)"}
{"text":"In going with a common theme I have found in these type of diner establishments, I ordered a Fat Elvis Shake with Bacon (of course! also contains peanut butter, bananas, and chocolate) along with a country breakfast, eggs over easy and some gravy for the biscuit.

I wish I got a bit more adventurous with the main dish as it was a simple straight forward affair, just as described, and I'm not a big breakfast guy. But as I was going here for the first time, I wanted to go classic. The shake was good as well.

I can see see why this place is popular, as it has solid home cooking and the classic cozy atmosphere."}
{"text":"Excellent food! I had the chicken in a pie that was amazing! The crust was flaky and light. I also had a strawberry shake. It was all homemade food from local growers. I would highly recommend this place. The prices are a little high but the food and atmosphere was great."}
{"text":"Eh. This place is \"fine\". I'm not terribly impressed with it. I could probably get better breakfast somewhere else. Plus its ALWAYS so so so busy in there. I like that they have a ton of vegetarian options. Which is rare for breakfast places. But meh. Its not amazing food."}
{"text":"Breakfast is their best offering here. Burgers are also good, but I was disappointed in the lack of chicken on my sandwich. We had to wait for a table at 7:30pm. Shows their business is good but I was surprised at the late dinner rush. Other people waiting for a table stole it before the waitress got their tip. Not the restaurant's fault but disappointed in the guests."}
{"text":"Really cool & interesting veggie options, cool atmosphere, nice area, what more could you ask for? They even have a giant selection of pies! Voted best veggie restaurant in madison, but half of the menu or more isnt veggie, so everyone will be happy. Check it out."}
{"text":"In my opinion, almost all restaurants in the Madison area are bland. People may hate me for thinking it, but I don't care. There's no spice, little flavor, and it's gotten to the point where I just don't really go out, because I'm sick of wasting my money on mediocre food.

It got to the point where I thought my tastebuds were dying.

Enter Monty's Blue Plate. I had the meatless loaf sammich, and it was awesome, though it tasted nothing like meatloaf. The waffle fries? delicious. The dipping sauce? Don't even think of stealing a dip. I will bite you.

There was so much I wanted. I will be back, perhaps tomorrow. I will find excuses to wander to the east side, then say \"While I'm here, I might as well hit Monty's\".

All-in-all, Monty's is making my life better. Thank you Monty's."}
{"text":"After seeing old friends at the last Latin Night at The Cardinal (http://www.yelp.com/biz/cardinal-bar-madison#hrid:KfYiEWXAc-SlP_qEiUO6Hw) we agreed to meet here for breakfast on Monday morning.

Well, not all of us made it but good times were had while eating.  This is the closest to a 'real' diner that Madison has that I've been to but they have some truly kick ass pieces of fat French Toast.

I had bacon & eggs, french toast w/ coffe & cream and my daughter had the Blue Plate Omelette w/ home fries and orange juice.

Good place to come with a group of old friends or your kids (if they know how to act right in public...)"}
{"text":"I love this place because besides their really good menu, they are local and use local food. People is friendly and their desserts OMG!!"}
{"text":"Lunch on a Saturday afternoon, with 2 small kids? No problem. Monty's provided chalk outside for use while you waited (15 min was quoted, actual wait time was...well...who pays attention to the clock when you're busy chalking?). 

Kids menus and cups were also provided, and the waiter didn't bat an eye at the mess the kids made. 

The menu is varied - breakfast, entrees, sammiches - but steps outside of the 'normal' fare to throw a few curveballs. My spinach/feta burger tasted fresh and not mass-produced. 

Only downside is that the place is loud - but then, that turns into a positive when you're with a hungry 11month old. :)"}
{"text":"This is my absolute favorite restaurant and anytime I come home for a visit I have to stop by to have some Meatless Loaf of the God's or a Gobbler!

Top it all off with a Cup of Mud or an off the hook slice of pie or cake and you have one amazing meal that can only be found in Mad-town."}
{"text":"A diner with Food Fight style and warm service is my go-to for breakfast all day. Beloved: corned beef hash, TNT BLT, waffle fries. A year and a half of regular visits has revealed the staff to be consistently friendly and efficient, food quality to be consistently high and prices to be reasonable.  Monty's is worth the occasional short wait for a table."}
{"text":"Monty's is one of my fave brunch-or-lunch places, especially on lazy weekends when I want breakfast food at 2pm but do not want big-chain food.  They have a wide array of something for everyone from vegan offerings to biscuits and gravy to slices of cake taller than your head, and it's all tasty.  

It does get really crowded at peak times, and the service can be hit-or-miss to an extreme:  sometimes I've gotten a server who hangs around making hilarious jokes and sometimes I've been in parties that were actually forgotten about after we were seated and then have the orders wrong when we finally did get our food (although the bad service is definitely more rare than the good).  

All-in-all the tasty food and the kitschy atmosphere make it worth the wait."}
{"text":"Amazing local and organic selection, with a greasy diner feel. Reasonably priced, kid friendly, but like all unique places, expect it to be fairly busy. It is worth the wait, especially if you are GF, vegan, or vegetarian. Not into that food? No worries, they have something for the traditional diners."}
{"text":"Breakfast heaven. Grab the French Toast and a side of hash browns."}
{"text":"Food, decent.   Service, eh.

We were on the way back from Chicago and decided to eat in Madison.  I found Monty's online so we checked it out.

The neighborhood couldn't be cuter.  It was noonish on a Sunday, so it was busy.  We waited a short time for our table.  I liked how the person cleaning the table also put the silverware and water down.  It helps turn the tables over quicker and it satisfies those of us waiting.  But don't drink it all right away, you might not get more.

I wanted the egg sandwich, but I also wanted lunch, so I decided on the Roast Chicken, bacon (none for me thanks) and goat cheese sandwich with bean salad.  Dining companion had the Turkey Club with bean salad.

Food arrived pretty quick and my sandwich was excellent!  The bread was toasted perfectly and the chicken was not at all dry and the smear of goat cheese was great.  My dining companion liked his sandwich was well.   The bean salad could double as a chip dip, in fact I have a recipe just like it that I will now be serving as salad.

What wasn't great was the service.  The food got dropped off and she never came back.  She was going to bring me more water, but we had with our glasses empty the WHOLE time we were eating.  We never saw her again.  We took out our credit card so if she did swing by she could take it and we could go.  If it weren't for the service we receive I would consider going back."}
{"text":"I have only been here a few times. Service is pretty good but my big problem is the shakes. First time I got a shake it was really thick and almost worth the 6 bucks. I looked forward to having another some day. Last Friday I went there for another shake and it was really thin. Like chocolate milk! Maybe when teenagers are making milk shakes for minimum wage you get varied results. $6 is way too much for a watery shake. Get it together people."}
{"text":"Monty's used to be one of my favorite places on the near-east side.   I've long loved their Meatloaf of the Gods, fat and calories be damned.  However, our last 5-6 experiences have been exercises in frustration, with such charming features as a $100 overcharge on my debit card for a $23 meal.  (yes, you read that right).  Yes, the server was new, yes they corrected it, but still.

We ate there again last night- I'm a firm believer in the power of the 19th chance-, only to leave with a renewed resolve that there are many better options available."}
{"text":"Stopped here on the way to Madison Art Fair for breakfast as it's been on my radar screen for a while. I guess for me I just don't think it's a 4 star place.

I had the \"Saturday Special\", biscuits and gravy. The biscuit was really quite good, but when you have biscuits and gravy, that should be the star of the show. It was off to the side of the plate kinda pushed off. While the gravy was good, there wasn't even enough to cover the biscuits. There should be enough to mix with the potatoes even. Made for a rather dry dish all in all.

Potatoes.. the flavor was decent, a bit spicy which I like, but really kinda of undercooked. They should have been crispy, but they were soft.. not crispy at all

Good flavors, but poorly executed. Maybe I just hit them on a bad day, but for me, it was three star at best. I may try again next time I'm in town..."}
{"text":"What a cute little place.  Doesn't seem like the smoothest run location.  The food we were served was good and served as requested....they serve breakfast all day, which is really nice.  I thought the food was well priced and the service was efficient."}
{"text":"So, it's not like this place was ever gonna make it outta my e-gutter, cuz there's nothing really redeeming about it. You know, sometimes a craving makes one act desperately... sometimes against one's better knowledge. Nevertheless, I make my way to Monty's one fine day, craving some sort of ice-cream based treat, similar to a beverage, but of a thicker consistency. Nothing special, just some plain old ice cream and say, caramel. It was $6.38?! Okay, so I go into a Vincent Vega state of mind, zoning out while the shake's bein' made thinking to myself \"Did I just order a six-dollars n' 38 cent shake? Sure did. A shake? Milk, ice cream, caramel? Uh-huh. Six-dollars n' 38 cents? Yep. They don't put bourbon in it or anything? Nope. Just checking... smh... Whoa, WHAT?! When it came up, it was in a small, flimsy styro cup, with a sad lil' wafer sticking out the top. Wait... did they just charge me like that much for this??? Ugh! I was so pissed, I told em' keep it, n' got my money back. I can get Culver's or Michael's for like, way better... Even the Chocolate Shoppe, or like, buy your own pint and a gallon of milk, stir in some Smucker's flavoring and have change to spare... I don't even know why people like this place. Dude, seriously..."}
{"text":"great vegetarian fare. my meat-eating friends tell me the meat options are okay, nothing to write home about. but, as a recent transplant from the south, and as a vegetarian, i cannot get enough of their meatless loaf of the gods. and the seitan vegetarian BBQ is fantastic. love it.

so, if you want a good meaty burger or fish or something else that once had a face, you should probably eat somewhere else. if you're a vegetarian, though, this place should make you happy."}
{"text":"Monty's is one of the many mind-boggling Food Fight restaurants that is a Madison favorite despite serving mediocre food. 

I've eaten one good dish here: the TNT BLT (tempeh and tomato). And the chocolate shake is good if you need to consume an extraordinary number of calories on any given day.

The last time I went, I did so because a friend told me the restaurant is attempting to make a switch to more sustainability-conscious, organic food. I ordered chili that was pretty much inedible. On another night, my boyfriend ordered a soup that was, again, inedible. 

I can imagine that people like to come here because the restaurant resembles an old-school diner and has booths, which are fun for kids to sit in. But the food quality is generally average to poor. The brunch I've had is tasteless and limited, and you are not getting fresh eggs unless you order them over easy. 

The only reason I give Monty's two stars is because its pies are great. And once in a while, I can stomach a TNT BLT because someone I'm with persuades me to give Monty's one . . . more . . . try."}
{"text":"I love the food here. I am a vegan and there are many options :) I can drop in any day to eat here :) Keep up the good work guys."}
{"text":"It is absolutely what you want it to be. It embodies the era of diners so well. The food was delicious. I have had the Grilled Cheese and the Mac and Cheese (I added bacon, yum!) both were wonderful. The milkshakes and malts are amazing as well. It can definitely get loud and sometimes there's a wait, but either way it is definitely worth it for this Madison gem."}
{"text":"Guys I did not want to leave this place.
Usually I can decide what to order relatively quickly. As a psecatarian, I don't have a lot of choices and I pretty much know what I like. This place, though. I could have ordered 10 different things and been equally happy I'm sure. I had to close the menu and stop thinking about it or I would have never been able to get out of there. As it was we ended up with way too much delicious food - wish was a shame because I wanted some pie and ice cream so badly when I first got there. 
Really, I'm going to have to come back and plan better. I also want to come for breakfast (our meal tonight was dinner) so I can try their coffee and sit at the counter.
What a friendly place, don't leave Madison without at least once visit here."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere and fantastic food!  And I love their gluten free options.  They made things as we ordered them and the service was prompt and friendly.  This is a really nice \"diner\" with nice decor and a very friendly atmosphere.  The line was very long on Sunday morning but that's the sign of anything good because everyone wanted to eat there.  Nom nom, we'll be back! :)"}
{"text":"Monty's has started to bake their own doughnuts and they are without a doubt the best doughnuts in Madison.  One day they had a cake doughnut with oreo crumbles and icing and it gave me flashbacks to Voodoo Doughnuts in Portland, OR.  If I had a higher metabolism I'd stop and pick up a couple of doughnuts every day before work.  I can't do that but I do enjoy one once or twice a week.  Caveat emptor, these things are addicting. I only hope they broaden the variety of flavors."}
{"text":"Not great but not bad. On the healthful side, I had a Mediterranean platter that was quite tasty. It had hummus, quinoa salad and pita with cucumber salad. I enjoyed the fact that while this is something of an old-fashioned diner, my choices were not restricted to burgers and shakes. Although they do have shakes. Good looking ones at that, made with Sassy Cow ice cream. I opted for blueberry pie and was very disappointed. The blueberries were of the frozen variety and sour. There was nothing to hold them together, so they fell out of the flavorless crust individually. I was glad I asked for it a la mode, because the ice cream was the only thing that saved it. I had been really excited by the variety of pies and cakes at the counter but either they are not homemade or they are made by people who don't like to bake. Either way, I would not order pie here again. But I would come back for breakfast all day or some of the other menu items. Fun ambiance, particularly for kids (I was with one who thoroughly enjoyed his Mickey Mouse pancakes!)...Oh, and they have booze."}
{"text":"I like coming here often, it is easy because you know what they have each time. The dinner entrees are always hearty and the shakes are good :)"}
{"text":"It's always fun to take people to Monty's. The parking lot is a good indicator of how busy the place will be. Be aware, though, that the booths have very little tummy room, especially for those of us who aren't so svelte. If you fall into that category, try to get a table on the left side of the restaurant. Your ego will thank me later. :-)"}
{"text":"WOW! Monty's is now my go to place for catering! They catered an incredible, fresh & tasty lunch for 40 folks Downtown at the State Capital and everything was just as I hoped it would be. Working with Valree was a total pleasure! Great attention to detail and even with last minute changes everything was perfect. All of the sandwiches were fantastic! My fave was the BLT with guacamole! Guests were raving about the slow roasted turkey clubs and the flavor the falafel wraps had. The hummus was amazing along with how it was presented with fresh veggies and olives. The Everyday salad was fresh and had tons of beautiful avocados and tomatoes to enjoy! The large sugar cookies were perfect to finish with and a bonus that they had our company logo on them! I've always loved eating in the diner and I'm so glad that I reached out to have them help me with an off-site event. Valree and her team made the planning easy and really delivered, literally, an incredible lunch!"}
{"text":"Monty's is a great diner-esque restaurant. I couldn't even imagine counting all the times I've been here in all my years in Madison. Hungover, bright eyed and bushy tailed, ready for bed, and otherwise. Want breakfast? Go to Monty's. Lunch? Monty's. Dinner? You guessed it, Monty's. 

The food is consistently good. The cook will often come out to the tables and joke with the customers which is pretty refreshing. If you're looking for weekend breakfast, there may be a line, but at least you can sip coffee while you wait. Good coffee, at that!

Monty's will always hold a special place in my heart. 

Oh! And lots of vegetarian options, also."}
{"text":"I've never been to Monty's Blue Plate Diner and not seen it full of people, so prepare yourself. We waited for about half an hour for a table and then sat down and our waitress was extremely friendly and attentive to our needs.

I had the zucchini and potato pancakes served up with some applesauce and sour cream, a truly great hangover remedy! I would have liked my pancakes to be a crispier because they kind of melded together and the applesauce was overpoweringly sweet.

The real winner for me was the banana cream pie; although it's $5 for a slice, it's a pretty yummy slice and I was glad that the portion wasn't huge. The banana cream wasn't too sweet the crust was flaky, and it capped off a good meal. 

I saw they had some pretty extensive vegan options, so this is a great place to swing by if vegan food is your jam!"}
{"text":"My old supervisor took me and my ex-fiance' here shortly after I started working for her. It was really good diner food, and was very easy on the pocket book. I haven't been back since, but I wouldn't hesitate to stop by if I was in the area and craved diner fare :)"}
{"text":"Zucchini potato pancakes with Apple cranberry compote were Delish. Good coffee. Friendly, attentive staff indoors.chicken in a pie was good as well, but could be better if the crust were more pronounced as a flavor. Mashed potatoes were great and abundant. Rosemary."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful breakfast here but the most wonderful thing was that the manager sang for us... We loved it--- the place brought back all the warm fuzzy feelings that we get for Madison and Wisconsin and we were here with our son and girlfriend and had a great time..."}
{"text":"I recently visited Madison and went to Monty's.  Monty's is honestly such a great diner.  I especially love their chicken pot pie...very filling and so, so good.  The turkey soup is really yummy as well.  And the pies...absolutely amazing!!  

I really like the feel of the restaurant.  It's a great a place to go to and meet up with friends for sure.  Great service as well!  (Leslie is an awesome server:-)

Overall, a great diner all around.  Highly suggest (especially the desserts!)"}
{"text":"Can't do animals, can't do dairy, yet am a food warrior. Indeed, Madison abounds with options for a gal like me, but Monty's marks my favorite eatery in the city. Intentionally old-school in its decor and prices, it's a throwback that appeals to anyone with a frontal cortex. 
My waitress brought me a gratis cup of the home-made veg soup as I was sitting at the end of the counter an she hadn't seen me for a few minutes (aaaaand the tip started to go up).  I had the meatless meatloaf thing also mentioned here, and good LORD the portion size was outta control. The roll was the size of a Yorkshire pudding and the mashed potatoes were actually made of potato, fancy that. The meatless loaf itself was solidly good (shredded root veg with a cheesy binder - wish I had known that prior to ordering, but should've asked) but a bit oily and the cashew gravy was goooood. So many great-looking options for veg-heads like myself, hallelujah a-MEN, and they even have a small wine list and beer. 
I couldn't get through the entire pile of food, despite being a hormonal food warrior that day, yet I craved a sweet and Monty's has soy ice cream. WTF, OTHER DINERS? I nearly wept at this one. I had the mint chip, 2 scoops, which again were more like two grapefruit spilling over the sides of the bowl. That, I could do. 
My total bill came to $8. EIGHT. I added a 50% tip and blew Monty's a kiss as I left; I shall RETURN! Waitress was a sweetie, the staff all seemed to be pretty happy, and the place was approaching fullness when I left. 
My fondness for Monty's justifies the caps."}
{"text":"This diner offers an unexpectedly large number of vegetarian options, including a fantastic \"Sheldon\" sandwich--their veggie analog to the Rueben.  Fresh hot fries would have nudged this rating to five stars."}
{"text":"After searching Yelp for the best diners in Madison we found Montys! Fantastic food and service... if we lived closer we'd definitely be regulars (from CT) 
Thank you for a great meal!!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this restaurant. I went here a couple nights ago on a mommy/daughter date with my 7 year old. I knew it was across from the Barrymore and I was expecting to have to park a bit away. So I was pleasantly surprised to see that it had a parking lot. It was a beautiful night and we chose to sit outside. Our waitress, Jennifer, was great. She brought out a kids menu and crayons for my daughter right away which kept her busy. My daughter and I went to Monty's because they serve breakfast all day and we wanted breakfast for dinner. I got decaf coffee and the eggs mornay. I had never had mornay sauce before and I found it absolutely delicious! Move over hollandaise! Also, it was the best tasting decaf I can ever remember having. Can't wait to go in the morning sometime when I can get the caffeinated coffee.
My daughter got the Mickey Mouse pancake and she loved it. It was a great price and came with juice and I was thankful they put a lid on it! It drives me crazy when I go places and they give little kids adult glasses filled to the brim. It's just an accident waiting to happen. So the lid gets a thumbs up! Also, REAL maple syrup. It's all we use at home and my daughter turns her nose up at imposter syrup so that was also a big plus.
I can't wait to go again. Truly, that neighborhood has to be my favorite area of Madison so I know I'll be back soon.
Almost forgot, a great bakery too! Took home some delicious pie. I loved the Mississippi mud. Chocolate overload! Mmmm!"}
{"text":"Had to come to the Capitol of Cheeseland to take care of a little bizwax with my Mum. Wife-unit assisted her with the affairs at hand, while I researched YELP to find out where we were going to eat. Monty's was close and looked well-reviewed.
Find every 5 star review here about this place and believe them.
Incredible food, great service. I'd give this place 10 stars if I could. 
Go eat here NOW!"}
{"text":"My husband and I love Monty's! It is one of our favorite go-to dinner spots in Madison. The atmosphere is very fun and though it's usually busy we don't usually have to wait too long to eat. Also, as a gluten-free eater they have a good selection of options, specifically because they have gluten free bread that can be used to modify almost any sandwich. The diner atmosphere is really fun, and their milkshakes are delicious!"}
{"text":"Best biscuits and gravy in town. Meatloaf? Meatloaf of the Gods! Haven't tried the meat(less)loaf of the Gods. Bakery? Delicious! Always great service."}
{"text":"Yummmmm is all I can say. Diner breakfast turned up a notch. Arrive early or you'll be waiting for your food."}
{"text":"I love the vegetarian Rueben and stuffed myself with the potato pie, but I haven't been thrilled with my breakfast experiences here.  I had the Scrambled Something or Other on the day that it happened to have asparagus in it.  I never did find any asparagus, but the eggs turned a horrendous shade of gray.  The potatoes were hardly cooked all the way through, but at least the biscuit was good.  I'm convinced the Mornay sauce is sausage gravy - I used to live in France and never had Mornay sauce like the stuff at Monty's!  Still - I give the place props for having so many vegetarian options.  It's fun to go out and have more to choose from than an iceberg lettuce salad or grilled cheese."}
{"text":"ah Sunday brunch back in Madison. I was really excited to try this place but I think I got slightly disappointed. First of all, not enough parking! Probably a total of 16 stalls in the tiny one way parking lot.. so do plan on car pooling here. I circled around the street 2 times before finding a parking space on the side street about 3 blocks away. It might just be Sunday though.. who knows. I do think the building and decor is kinda cool.. felt like a good old diner with a retro kick. so here comes the food part.. I ordered corn beef hash.. food was lukewarm. I usually like my hot food hot.. not like somewhere between hot and cold. It was greasy too. not a fan. I did like the side fruits that came with it..def gave my greasy hash a little break. I think I would come try their dessert next time. The pie and bakery goods look more yummy.. until next time. Oh btw our waiter was really friendly and unobtrusive so if you are the type of person into good table service."}
{"text":"I live down the road from Monty's and it's being in walking distance helps give it a half a star. I also tend to go at off-peak times which I think has helped me have a better experience (mid mornings on the weekends can get very crowded and you'll have a wait). I've tried many things here and have never had anything bad. Some things though were just meh. I really enjoyed their french toast. It was big and fluffy on the inside and cooked just right on the outside. Their omelets and other egg dishes I've tried were pretty standard. The serving sizes are pretty big. I'm not a veg, but I appreciate that they had several options available for those who are. Overall I think it's a fun place to take friends who are visiting from out of town before heading down to the farmer's market early on a Saturday morning."}
{"text":"Yummy, yummy, yummy!  Has always been one of my favorite diners in Mad-town.  Delicious veggie chili, spicy cornbread, malts and desserts, as well as the amazing array of other veggie options.  Just yesterday, I tried the new Spinoccoli Quiche with fruit, which was pretty darn good...coffee is always hot and refills frequent.  Still have yet to try the famous zucchini pancakes, but next time, I must.  I must also remember to save room for dessert!  Look forward to returning sooner than later to try some of the other new lunch options on the menu.  Only downer is the wait/lack of parking on a busy day.  Overall, two thumbs up from me, Monty."}
{"text":"Excellent food.  The biscuits are amazing, the fruit fresh and ripe, and I had the best piece of French silk pie I've ever had at this place.  I've only ordered breakfast, but they do have an expansive menu that includes a nice selection of foods (including vegan).  

The atmosphere is probably what stops me from going there more---it's just not my cup of tea.  The lighting is harsh and the seats can be kinda uncomfortable.  Last time I went, I was freezing!

But don't let that stop you.  There's an amazing bakery display case in the front that is worth a stop alone."}
{"text":"I've eaten at the Blue Plate so many times I can't count, even with my shoes off. Ok, I'll give it a try - I've eaten here about 65 times, give or take. From all of those experiences, I can remember possibly 4 or 5 of them being less than perfectly pleasant. Granted, one must make sure to manage their expectations when walking into Monty's. The wait can be up to a half hour most nights (no reservations accepted), and weekend brunches can find you standing in cue for over an hour, easily. 
With those caveats in mind, one should know this: there is nothing at Monty's that isn't homemade. Everything is fresh and, if not delicious then, supremely passable. 
Soups rotate daily and have never let me down (though I wouldn't dare order fish chowder on a Monday lunch break). Specials are always, well, special. While most dinners are content to pass off a standard entree as a special so long as it's adorned with added bacon or served on a different style of bread, Monty's really goes all out with their daily's. 
Prices are a little high, but not outrageous. As a general rule prepare to pay $1-2 more than you would expect for almost every sandwich or entree. 
Amazing options are the chicken pot pie, meatloaf (seriously), Reuben, Feta-Dill Burger, spicy chicken sandwich, and literally any cold entree salad. 
Everything else is merely good to great. 
Also, I've found that it's a great place to bring kids. Just try to avoid the supremely busy times of the week, it's loud enough in there without little Kailyenne (God, kids names suck these days....amirite??) throwing a tantrum. Although, should young Owlivêr throw a fork at a server, busser, or host, it would be deflected by the force field that is the hardest working and most amazingly kind service staff in the city. 
Seriously, the people here are rock stars. I hear they can even endure the occasional 47 year-old, hyper-entitled, west-side residing, trust funded man child from hell. (Food Fight already gave you people Hubbard Ave. Dinner and Bluephies, please mind the gap and maybe they'll throw a new, soulless, place your way soon enough. It will likely come pre-soaked in hand sanitizer.)"}
{"text":"What a great place for brunch, not to mention filling!

I've only been there once, but had to try it because I kept getting so many recommendations. I had the chicken salad sandwich, not to saucy or creamy, and fresh. It had chopped chicken and salad on a ciabatta roll. it had a great flavor. I also switched out the fries for the house potatoes, which were also very good!

My boyfriend decided to go with breakfast and had the Huevos Rancheros, he loved it and said he would definitely get it again. He's a picky eater so if he says something like that I trust that the food is good. 

I also ordered one of their specialty milk shakes with coffee in it. What an amazing drink!!! 

I would definitely go back over and over again! And I'll wait with no problem because that usually means that the food is worth it..."}
{"text":"I have been hearing about Monty's Blue Plate Diner ever since I moved to Madison because some of my co-workers absolutely LOVE this place.  It took me almost 5 months to get here which is kind of unfortunate, because it is GREAT!

The first thing I was told about Monty's was that it is like an upscale diner that serves vegan and vegetarian food.  This is kind of true, because it is a diner, it is nice inside and not super divey and you can order lots of dishes as vegan, vegetarian, or gluten-free.  However, I would definitely not describe Monty's as a vegan/vegetarian restaurant because half of the items contain eggs or bacon, as any good diner should.

The first time I went I ordered blueberry pancakes, the short stack, and a simple glass or orange juice.  I passed on the free bottomless cup of coffee that you get when you check in because I had already had my coffee for the day.  The pancakes were good, nothing fancy, but solid.  Two was plenty for me as they were a large-ish size.

Second time I ordered the Monty's breakfast sandwich which had bacon, avocado, fried egg, herbed goat cheese, and something leafy I think on cheddar jalepeno bread.  It was served with their American potatoes which remind me of the potatoes I got at Grampas brunch.  The sandwich was tasty, though I was disappointed a little by the bread as it didn't have much jalepeno or cheddar flavor and mostly tasted like toasted white bread.

Third visit I went with the Blue Plate Special Omelet that had bacon, avocado, and cheddar inside with salsa on top served with American potatoes and a biscuit.  I also finally got one of their mimosas that are very popular among Saturday brunch goers.  The omelet was really tasty, only needed a little salt and pepper on top and as always, the potatoes were awesome.  I also had an outstanding biscuit, warm, moist, flaky and crumbly at the same time with a nice crust on top.  Nomnomnom.  

Overall Monty's is an excellent choice with solid diner food, friendly service and fairly reasonable prices.  Perfect for people that have different dietary choices as there is seemingly something for everyone!"}
{"text":"I didn't think the food was anything too above average, but the service was really great. The server helped us understand the menu and made it very clear what was vegan or not. I had the almond French toast which tasted good, but was pretty small and left me wanting more. My partner had the tofu scramble and it wasn't anything I couldn't make at home, but still good. However, they do offer vegan shakes which is so hard to find and that is my favorite thing about Monty's."}
{"text":"Monty's is our absolute GO TO. First of all, the staff are attentive, friendly, and accommodating. The food is well priced and always comes out quickly. Oh, and by the way, it's delicious!! Every time. It never disappoints. We've only been for breakfast but we cannot wait to try their dinner sometime!"}
{"text":"The food is great, but the dining area is unbelievably loud, the indoor seating is cramped and they are incredibly busy. Half the time when I come here, I end up waiting for 20 minutes for a table, giving up, and going across the street to Lao Laan Xang. If you have the time to sit around for half an hour waiting for a table, and don't mind a loud environment, you will at least enjoy some pretty good \"elevated diner food\"."}
{"text":"My local greasy spoon.

I love the milkshakes here.

Breakfast and lunch food has all been good as well. I've never ordered anything to be disappointed.

I tend to go for sandwiches and burgers for lunch, but the chicken chimichurri kabob are out of the world and I have had it at least a half dozen times.

Breakfast wise chilaquiles, any of the omelettes, or the breakfast burrito will treat you right.

Service is good, and the current check in offer of bottomless coffee will get you well caffeinated if you find yourself in need."}
{"text":"Descriptive phrase: quaint, local diner.

Monty's Blue Plate Diner is located in a quiet but neat part of East Madison, not far off Willy Street. It looks like an old gas station (could be), and there was a 25 minute wait for Saturday brunch when we came. There's space to sit outside, or shops nearby to wander to. Inside it's classic diner, through and through. We (4 of us) were seated at a small booth. It was cozy to say the least. 

Katie K. and I split a Chocolate Shake ($6) to start off. It's what you'd expect from the setting, served in a metal tin and absolutely delicious. I as good as chugged mine.

I leaned toward lunch this time around and got the Roast Chicken, Bacon & Goat Cheese sandwich ($9). This dish was just missing a wow-factor (in addition to the Oxford-comma). I love goat cheese, and expected so much with it melted between two pieces of sourdough and chicken, bacon, and tomato. But none of the flavors that should've been present stood out. The salty bacon was lost in the grease of the bread. There may not have been any tomato. The chicken was bland.

I loved the shake, and the sandwich was by no means bad, but there was no warm-feeling deliciousness I expected from a meal in such a diner. I'd return, but get something else."}
{"text":"After posting my 2-star review, I received a message from a manager at Monty's, asking if he could send me some vouchers and if I would be willing to give them another try. I happily did that, and got the vouchers soon after! I have since been back to Monty's twice, once for breakfast and another time for dinner. 

The service has been great both times; prompt and friendly. The food is pretty good, and is definitely a good value. The prices might not be super cheap, but you get a lot of food! I've gotten poached eggs twice since I wrote my more negative review of Monty's, and both times the eggs have been cooked perfectly."}
{"text":"This is my favorite resurant in Madison. I have a two year old son, so friendly fast service is a must and this place delivers everytime. Everything on the menu I've tried is awesome and yummy too. My son gets the mac and cheese and it is so good that I've even ordered it for myself after I tried his. It's not only a family place though, young, old, kids, no kids everyone can enjoy yummy food in a fun relaxed environment. :)"}
{"text":"Everything here was okay. The food was okay, the service was pretty good, and um... the atmosphere was okay?

There's nothing particularly compelling here for me to write about. My food was enjoyable, but nothing to write home about. There seemed to be a lot of vegetarian options, but since I'm not vegetarian in the least, that didn't make much difference to me. Again, the service was pretty good and our server was friendly, but overall nothing too exciting."}
{"text":"There was nothing bad about our recent trip to Montys,   Driving home from skiing decided to off the beaten path, tired of bad chain restaurants.   So glad we did.   Started off with Bloody Mary's while we waited for a table.  We had a group of 10 and it was a little cramped while waiting, but drink in hand-so who cares?!   I ordered the burger and fries,  excellent.   Melted cheddar in top.   Hubby ordered the meat loaf stack- he cleaned his plate.  Several of the others ordered Mac and cheese and milk shakes!   I had no idea they were so large,  you may want to consider sharing a milk shake, seriously enormous.   Friendly service,  excellent food!"}
{"text":"Disregard the sniffy reviews by food snobs; Monty's is great at being what it is, a nouveau diner with an eclectic menu, welcoming to old and young, hipster and square, LGBT and straight,etc. Great breakfast items (French toast,omelettes, scramblers, pancakes) available around the clock, lots of comfort food veg and non-veg dishes (\"meatloaf of the gods\" enchiladas, chili, etc.). Everything is freshly prepared with good ingredients. Not to mention the delicious pies and cakes..coffee is meh but that's par for diners. Prices are reasonable, two can be stuffed for $30. Friendly service by the mostly college student/artsy young person staff. If you're looking for a good solid (but not fancy-shmancy) meal on the E. Side of Madison, can't do better than Monty's."}
{"text":"If you have poached eggs on your menu and do not know how to poach an egg do NOT offer it as an option. I got the breakfast item with spinach, mornay sauce ,and poached eggs, only to receive hard boiled eggs. It completely ruined the dish and my want to ever come back. Not to mention that the food is always mediocre. Not happy and not coming back."}
{"text":"There are so many fabulous reviews about this place, I had to check it out for myself. When I walked in, I really liked the look of the diner. It's bright, colorful, and clean. I wasn't sure if I should seat myself or wait to be seated. In many diners, you simply seat yourself, but that's not always the case. Also, there's usually a sign that says \"Seat Yourself.\" I didn't see any signs, so I waited a couple of seconds hoping one of the staff would tell me. They didn't. They didn't even acknowledge that I'd come in. So, I took a seat at the counter. 

There were two members of the wait staff there. Neither acknowledged me. I waited to find out if someone was going to take my order. One woman eventually got around to it. I ordered the meatloaf dinner. It didn't take long to come and it was flavorful. Luke warm, but flavorful. My waitress never checked to see how I was doing (you know the check I mean, the one that comes a few minutes after you're served). She did stop by when I was nearly finished. I told her I was thinking about dessert. She said she'd give me a few minutes. In the meantime, a man sat next to me at the counter, ordered, received his order and was about to get his dessert before she remembered that I wanted to order dessert also. I ordered the peanut butter malt. Best I've ever had!! 

All-in-all my experience was OK. The diner truly is straight out of the 50's. They have an interesting tea pot collection on shelves in the counter area. The menu choices were varied, and my food would have been really good if it had been served hot. A little more attention on the part of the wait staff and this review would have been five-star. Having experienced Monty's once, the next time I'm in Madison, I'll try another diner."}
{"text":"It is about the most vegetarian-friendly diner I've ever known. Some things on the menu are stellar -- like the tofu wrap and the yummy waffle fries -- and others are so-so. Is suppose that, as far as \"diner\" food goes, it's better than average, but you're not really paying \"diner\" prices... 

The staff always seems sort of out of it and not thrilled to interact with customers. We regularly wait long stretches to get some attention from our server once we are sat. But the faked-up old diner feels groovy and you always leave painfully full."}
{"text":"Monty's has great food - specifically the meat loaf and the mac and cheese. But the desserts are fantastic. The other night my wife and I wanted something sweet after 9 p.m. and stopped by to pick up twk cupcakes and two pieces of tge German chocolate cake. The price was just $14, and those cake slices were enormous! We ate desserts for days. A piece of cake that big (oh, and it's fantastic) would cost you $14 for one slice anywhere else, and that's without the second piece and the cupcakes. Monty's is not to be missed!"}
{"text":"I found my self here for breakfast and it was packed so waiting was going happen if I wanted in. The place is an Art Deco theme from a lost general that you don't see anymore and I liked it.

Waiting must be part of the dining experience because there were tons of out door seating with people waiting to get in. I never even looked at the menu because there is a weekend special of biscuits and gravy.

Service was on the slow side but every seat was in service and the place was busy. I ordered the biscuits and gravy weekend special which came in a timely manner given how busy they were. The plate looked pretty good as you can see in my pictures. While waiting for my food I noticed that they grind the Coffey beans for the fresh Coffey they serve.

The meal was a home made biscuit with fire roasted pepper gravy, two eggs and breakfast potatoes. The eggs were perfect sunny side up. The potatoes were fried and tender but not seasoned so a little salt was needed. I didn't know what to expect of the fire roasted pepper gravy but it worked and it was good. The whole plate was very good and hit the spot.

Over all the breakfast was good and the place is worth the wait for the old school dining experience they offer. I can see why it is so popular with people waiting to get in."}
{"text":"The best! A classic which includes a variety of food options, delicious bakery items, classic décor, and friendly workers. This place has been a favorite since I was a kid!"}
{"text":"Great old school diner with some tasty comfort food."}
{"text":"Delicious food and very low prices. The iced coffee and sweet potato frittata that I ordered were on point. My fiancées breakfast burrito was super tasty too. Expect to wait in line on for weekend brunch - this is a popular spot!"}
{"text":"Whenever I get the chance to stop over in this great city I always try to swing by Monte's. The service is friendly but don't expect to be looked into every 2 minutes. Which personally I prefer. This has a very local feel and the prices are just right.

I had the Blue Plate special with egg whites. It was wonderful. Not greasy. The artichoke sandwhich is also off of the hook! Very good down home food all the way around and extremely reasonably priced. Especially coming from the West Coast.

The other added bonus is Monte's is located in the Willy Street area...the more eclectic part of \"downtown\"."}
{"text":"Having heard only good things, I had pretty high expectations for Monty's but I felt let down by the service and really let down by the food. The meals ordered, chicken in a pie and salmon cakes were both luke-warm and tasted like they had lived under a warming lamp for quite some time. This place it not worth the reputation."}
{"text":"We ate dinner there today and we loved everything about it.  The food was *delicious* (my husband had the broiled cod entree and I had the roasted spinach salad.  His came with seasoned home fries & steamed broccoli and mine included eggplant, quinoa & mozzarella cheese.  The vinaigrette dressing was particularly good, too).  The prices were *very* reasonable, the portions were generous, our server was super-friendly, the manager was very pleasant (I complimented him afterwards), we liked the interior and the restrooms were very clean.  A great experience in every way!"}
{"text":"I have been in Madison for three weeks, and have been looking for a place like this. The food is amazing, and the prices are low. I had an amazing goat cheese ravioli with a creamy pesto sauce evening special. It was probably the best meal I've had in Madison. I am sorely disappointed that I'll be heading home for good on Thursday."}
{"text":"Stopped in this morning for breakfast and pie. They make great corned beef hash and home fries. The meat is hand cut from locally sourced beef, and all the ingredients are fresh and tasty. 
For pie my server Kim surprised me with strawberry rhubarb ala mode. Again fresh and delightful.  
Monty's offers fantastic diner food and a wide range of fruit and cream pies. You can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"Fabulous food and AWESOME atmosphere. Perfect place to take your kids or have a little date. ;) The only thing that is upsetting is that once you fall in love with something on the menu, it always gets taken off. I have had probably 3 or 4 dishes that I have loved over the years that are just no longer available."}
{"text":"Hate the wait, but love the place all the same.  Great, great food and convenient to Olbrich Gardens."}
{"text":"I was very pleasantly surprised about the quality of the vegan food @ Monty's. I got the Almond Milk French Toast and the Sweet Potato Hash for my first Madison vegan experience, figuring this would tell me all I needed to know.

The French Toast is made with Cinnamon bread and is delicious. My only issue with this dish is it's basically an a la carte item--not even a fruit garnish! For the price they could have easily slid on some tempeh to make a complete meal. After licking my plate clean, I moved on to the sweet potato hash (which came with a wonderful tofu scramble) and was pleasantly surprised. It has a spicy kick that I wasn't expecting but loved.

My friend got the Blue Plate Special Omelet and had nothing but positive things to say--so good job Monty :)

The diner itself is very nice and the service was great. 

What would be awesome? Veganize MORE dishes!!"}
{"text":"Adorable gas station turned restaurant.  Popular breakfast spot.  Huge desserts.  Smiley staff.  Boozy malts and shakes.  What more could you want?"}
{"text":"Monty's will never let you down. Unless you're racing the clock to get pie before they close at 9:00pm. Breakfast, lunch or dinner... it's always good. I'm a big fan of all their omelettes, made even better because a biscuit comes on the side. Expect a bit of a wait if you're there for brunch... though certainly worth it if you have the time. 

P.S. Check in on yelp and get free coffee!"}
{"text":"Yeah, it's nice there are a lot of veggie options, but I feel like they are spreading themselves too thin.  No one I went with was really impressed with their food, and the weird thing was that the waitress brought out half the table's food, making a few people wait.  Anyone who's been a waitress knows not to do that.  I do appreciate tempeh, seitan and tofu on menus, but it would be nice if they did it well."}
{"text":"First, the decor and the building itself is super cool. It really gives you that diner feel. The pies and desserts right when you walk in are also a great touch - they look absolutely divine!

We came on a Saturday at about 1:30. We had to wait for about 15 minutes, not too bad considering how small the space is. Service was okay. Our server was friendly but we had to ask about 5 times for silverware until we actually got some. They have a great selection of breakfast items, I honestly didn't pay much attention to anything else on the menu. They are really good about marking what is gluten-free which was super nice. 

I ordered the corned beef hash and it was very good. The hash had great flavor and the eggs were cooked perfectly. The biscuit looked delicious but I of course couldn't eat it (devastating). One of my biggest pet peeves though is when there is food on the plate that isn't meant to be eaten...and they put the fruit on a leaf of iceberg lettuce. Not a deal breaker obviously but something that has always annoyed me. My boyfriend ordered the country breakfast with bacon and scrambled eggs. He said it was really good, especially the potatoes. 

This place is officially on my radar as another great breakfast option!"}
{"text":"Monty's is always great for comfort food. The vegetarian/vegan options are terrific (especially the sandwiches) and the pie is amazing. Sometimes it's a little lacking in consistency, but I'm always happy to go back."}
{"text":"Love this place. Gets crowded around the normal brunch time, so go early or go late. Otherwise, it's probably going to be at least a 30 minute wait.

Huge portions. Love their omelets. Lots of vegetarian options (if that's your thing - not mine). Haven't tried their desserts, but they always look tasty.

Service: Good. I've always had very nice servers. And I'm willing to cut them slack since they're always really busy. Plus they're pretty quick with the coffee refills.
Environment: Old school diner feel - with booths and stools! Doesn't feel cramped even when it gets crowded.

Side notes: I LOVE diners. Also, if you eat the biscuit, you're a fatty."}
{"text":"I am a HUGE fan of the Food Fight Restaurant Group, but wasn't a fan of Monty's Blue Plate Diner. The host was friendly and despite being busy, they sat us quickly. The waiter was nice, but not attentive - our drinks sat empty most of our visit. I ordered Chicken Pot Pie with mashed potatoes. Both of which were really dry. 

The overall cleanliness of the store is also something that needs some attention..."}
{"text":"Yum.

Have been here a few times, and have never left disappointed. It's an easy choice on my \"vegan\" days when I still want something that feels sort of bad for you and diner-y (versus Green Owl, which is fantastic but sometimes feels TOO healthy). All the sandwhiches I've tried have been great, and the pie is SOOO good - especially any one with peanut butter in it. Service can be a little slow and invisible, at times, but the food makes it totally worth it. Looking forward to hitting it up again in the fall."}
{"text":"Been here three times in a month and I just want to keep going back and back and back! 

Had something different every time I've been there and every dish/plate/meal was DELICIOUS! Can get kind of crazy for weekend lunch, but if you have a chance to wait, I highly suggest you do, it will be so so so worth it!!"}
{"text":"I love that this diner offers vegetarian/vegan options. Perfect for me and my omnivore hubby. Our waitress was great, too."}
{"text":"I can only speak to my one experience, but unfortunately it'll probably be my only.  We came in late Saturday morning.  It was busy as expected, we were seated after a bit.  Then it took quite a while to get menus and even longer to get coffee, which was old and cold.  We finally ordered and my egg yolks were hard and the whites were runny.  No seasoning on the eggs, I'm not sure what the sausages were made of, but I hope it wasn't pork.  The potatoes were well seasoned, but cold.  My wife's breakfast was totally dry, unseasoned and cold.  I think it was supposed to be a frittata.  I'm giving two stars instead of one, because I'm sure my experience wasn't typical.  I did see a few other plates go back to the kitchen though."}
{"text":"My wife and i love this place for lunch or dinner. Not so awesome on the breakfast end unfortunately. But there's a great selection for vegans and vegitarians alike. Our favorite is the Heathan Vegan. One of the best sandwiches ever! And that it's served with waffle fries makes it only more appealing. The veggie meatloaf is also fantastic as is the gravy that's served on it. Service can be a bit iffy at times. But the one time it was so terrible for us we ended up complaining we got a $25 \"we're sorry\" coupon. Not bad. Over all though you can't go wrong at Monty's."}
{"text":"Food was delicious. A touch pricey for a \"diner\" but worth it one we were eating. Service was good too, even when my daughter went into meltdown mode because she didn't want to leave."}
{"text":"Amazing! They have a whole vegan menu and so many options to please whoever is in your group!"}
{"text":"Consistent food and service.    Breakfast is the favorite in our family.   Oh,.  maybe its  the pies...."}
{"text":"After this morning BK breakfast fiasco, I still wanted breakfast.  This place is like Campbell's soup good mmmm mmm mmmm. I had country breakfast plate eggs  and bacon cooked perfect. Don't judge but also had blueberry pancakes. My gf had the blue plate omelet( the yummy one with avacados). I can't say enough how great the food and service was. Love great diner's like this."}
{"text":"Monty, thank you for saving my restaurant foody soul last night.
After a disastrous meal at another restaurant, I was crabby, mad, moody and wanting to go home.  Luckily we drove by the shining light of the Monty's sign and pulled in to the parking lot.  
Grabbed a seat at the counter and ordered a piece of pecan pie a la mode for myself and my husband.  Your hostess, waitress, bus staff were all polite, welcoming, and doing their jobs.  They refilled our coffee, checking on our food, did we need anything else?  THANK YOU!
The pie was delicious, the ice cream melted slowly into the pecan crust and became a delicious consoling comfort food. 
My congratulation on being a place that I have visited for over 10 years and still makes the mark of having great staff, great food and ambiance.  That turquoise counter has never felt so good to lean my elbows on as last night."}
{"text":"How have I never written a review for Monty's? 

Very often full of hipsters as well as old ladies having pie and coffee, Monty's is a Madison staple. A long-time fan of their french toast, I recently discovered their zucchini and potato pancakes. While I expected them to be small and dense like latkes, they were really more the size and shape of buttermilk pancakes. So much food! But really good.

While I personally loathe meatloaf as a rule, my sister stands by their meatloaf and meatloaf sandwich as being the best around. 

Always popular with the veggie/vegan crowd for the multitude of imitation food offerings, I stick with the bacon."}
{"text":"Awesome, Awesome, Awesome!

I had stopped here before just for some desert awhile back, this time it was for some good food.  Stopped here right after work, and was extremely hungry. 

Our group of four sat down in a cozy corner booth. A few of us got some seasonal specialty drinks, I tasted each, all were fantastic. I ended up getting the Blue Plate Burger with Fries, so great! Blue Cheese, caramelized onions, lettuce,  and tomato..yum! I was so hungry I ate the whole thing...which is so abnormal for me to finish a whole plate of food..but it was too fantastic to put down. 

After the filling meal, we ended up getting some desert, a few of us got some ice cream, pie, or a shake...I ended up getting the Orange Cream Shake. It really was great. Not too over overpoweringly orangey, or sweet. It was a perfect balance of both. 

The atmosphere here is great, 50's diner feel, this time of year they had Christmas music playing. Staff all fantastic, our host was so sweet, and our waiter was extremely attentive, and personable."}
{"text":"Very busy and the for the floor show, I watched a small child dash back and forth from the dining area into the kitchen area and back again. Multiple times. I didn't like the floor show, so that was the last time I went there."}
{"text":"I walked in here not knowing what to expect. I sat down, and ordered a coffee, and then breakfast. I couldn't choose through all the delicious sounding names so I chose the dish with their name in it, Blue Plate Special Omelet. 

Overall, the breakfast dish was excellent. The Fried potatoes were done just right. The service is top-notch! I didn't wait long to get my large portion of well prepared and affordable food. 

I tried to eat all of it so at the end, I had a stomachache. Too much food in one sitting. I think it's a nice problem to have. Don't you?"}
{"text":"Monty's is a place you can go where the veg selections don't feel like an afterthought.  Order \"The Sheldon\"...  Trust me.  Also, amazing waitstaff and very good coffee"}
{"text":"If I had a friend from overseas come to visit, and he asked me to show him what good American food was like, I know without a doubt this would be the place that I would display to him with great national pride. Actually, I take all my friends who come to visit Madison to Monty's. I once had a friend visiting who was on a very strict diet (gluten free + fasting for lent) with me and she had a good three pages of vegetarian and gluten-free menu to choose from.

This shouldn't scare off those looking for a greasy spoon, however, because you're free to order something at the complete opposite of that spectrum. Bacon grilled cheese, donut french toast, chicken fried steak, alcoholic milkshakes...You name it, they probably have it. My one piece of advice is that you should probably look at the menu ahead of time because it is so expansive that you could spend as much as a half hour just trying to make up your mind.

Be prepared to wait a long time if coming in during the weekend brunch rush. Do not be deterred, it is completely worth every second.

For what it's worth this is probably my #1 favorite restaurant in Madison, if not my favorite restaurant ever."}
{"text":"I love monty's.  I mean really on a deep personal almost sexual level.  I love you monty."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try Monty's Blue Plate Diner ever since I moved to Madison. But every time I've tried to go, there's been a line out the door, so I've gone elsewhere. However, on Mother's Day at two in the afternoon, although there were people sitting outside, we were able to get in without a wait.

Inside is a definite retro diner feel. There's also a display case w/amazing looking pies.

Our waitress escorted us to a table, brought us waters, and took our drink orders. The menu is heavy on the breakfast items. However, my brother and I were both in the mood for lunch. I ordered the Meatloaf Stack and my brother got a burger with a side of fries. He made a comment to the waitress that he wanted the fries really crispy. Crunchy he said.

While waiting for our meal we continued to peruse the menu. Their desserts and dessert drinks look and sound amazing. When I go back, I will be sure and save room for those.

It took awhile for the food to come out and when it did, it was sans fries. But the waitress explained that she had sent the fries back because they were definitely NOT crispy enough. When she did bring them out a few minutes later, they were PERFECT! Crispy, crunchy, really fried. Kudos to the cooks and kudos to our awesome waitress for taking care of us like that. The rest of the food was also quite good. My meatloaf was perfect. I could have used more gravy for the mound of mashed potatoes, the onion rings were thin and crispy. My brother said his burger was excellent.

We left stuffed and pleased. I definitely want to go back. I just need to find a time when the line is not out the door."}
{"text":"Maybe I'm jumping the gun with a 5 star review... oh well, life's short.  I tried this place for the first time the other week when my grandparents were visiting me in Madison.  It was just wonderful!

The decor is adorable, the servers were friendly and prompt, and the food was fabulous.  I went with the Heathen Vegan Sandwich, which is piled high with mushrooms, tempeh, and avocado.  For my side, I chose the bean salad.  Both of these items were delicious.  The sandwich was HUGE.  I could not eat it like a regular sandwich, so I ate it in an open-faced sort of way with a fork.  A little messy, but totally worth it.  The mushrooms and tempeh were perfectly seasoned and tender and the avocado brought it all together with the toasted bread.

I got a bit nervous because at the *very last second* my grandma changed her order to the exact same thing I got (she's not vegan) because she \"trusts me\".  I was pretty nervous, but she ended up loving it!  I was so pleased.  My one complaint might be that my bean salad had a bit too much dressing on it, but my grandma's did not share that problem and it wasn't difficult to just eat it with a fork instead of a spoon.

My grandpa ordered some sort of breakfast platter and was very pleased.  He basically always orders the same thing at diners - two poached eggs, bacon, potatoes, and toast, so if he is impressed I feel that it is a good sign. He said the eggs were cooked perfectly.

They seem extremely accommodating for allergies and preferences as well, which is always a huge plus.

Overall, I was very happy with my first visit to Monty's.   Not only because I loved my vegan options, but because you made my grandparents very happy too and that rocks in my book.  I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Monty's Blue Plate and the Holy Grail of Corned Beef Hash. 

If I were to write nothing else, I think the previous sentence sums up my new found appreciation for the place. 

\"Your mother was a hamster, and your father smelled of elderberries\" will never be uttered to an employee of Monty's. 

The service was great, my coffee cup stayed full the entire meal, and the food was 'da bomb.' 

I'm eyeballing the Chorizo for my next visit, which will be sooner rather than later."}
{"text":"Monty's is one of those places where you start going to as a little kid, and continue going to well past your 70s. I could definitely see myself here years from now shaking my head disapprovingly at the rowdy young'un's over my newspaper (aka some form of electronic tablet at that point).

Monty's serves up some classic breakfast items, including the standard buttermilk pancakes, bottomless coffee (sorry millenniums, no mimosas here) and various omelets.

The servers here are extremely down to earth and friendly, and their chefs cook a mean meatloaf (highly recommended). 

What to get away from the glitz and glamour of most brunch places these days? Come by Monty's for some ultimate comfort food!"}
{"text":"Sometimes I read reviews for an establishment that make me sad for Madison. The reviews on this site for this \"institution\" spring to mind. Like all other Food Fight restaurants, this place is devoid of anything that would make it interesting or enjoyable. The decor looks like it was purchased out of Good Time Fifties Oldies Diner Catalog and the food ranges from passable to embarrassing. 

Skip the soul-less chain and go to any family-owned business in the area instead. Stalzy's comes to mind."}
{"text":"Great diner style/comfort food with a wide variety of vegan and vegetarian options. They had a huge selection of pies and cakes (we had the German chocolate cake & strawberry rhubarb pie) and thought both were amazing, very large portions too!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic affordable diner! My wife and I went here and we're able to enjoy our time. I ordered a breakfast platter, and my wife had the chicken pot pie! Our waiter was nice attentive even though he was clearly busy. Maybe one day I'll come back for their dessert!"}
{"text":"Monty's is easily one of my favorite diners, and for good reasons:
1. Boozy milkshakes.
2. Meatloaf. Holy moist meatloaf with mounds of mashed potatoes and gravy. As a sandwich, comes with tomato and little fried onions.
3. Herbed goat cheese. You can get this on their bistro burger, chicken sandwich, BREAKFAST SANDWICH (this is friggin amazeballs), and probably other things if you ask.
4. Waffle fries
5. Huevos rancheros. I love them here!!
6. Biscuits. I may or may not have brought my own honey from the farmer's market and slooped it on a buttery flaky biscuit.
7. Vegan and veg options that are just as desirable and delicious.
8. Their pie.
9. The service - they are attentive and nice and overall awesome at Monty's!

Other notes: I've never had to wait long for a table. In colder weather, order the hot buttered rum. Love Monty's."}
{"text":"Best food ever. Spicy yam soup great!! Can't wait to come back to try the Other entrees!"}
{"text":"We went for a late dinner around 8ish, so it wasn't crazy busy like most of the other reviews stated. We sat down right away because it was late. First impression, this place is awesome total 50's diner style. Loved the look, the classic long counter with stools, dessert counter to look at all the pie options- it was great. We sat in a booth and began looking at the menu. If you're a vegan, there's a ton of options. I've never seen a Diner with so many classic foods made vegan, so even though I'm not I thought that was something worth noting. They also serve alcohol and have spotted cow on draft. Some of my friends tried the raspberry Moscow mules, reported they were great , and I tried some and I agree. But upon receiving the second drink, it tasted extremely different- less raspberry flavor, more vodka. So their drink consistency is off or it was the end of the night. Another thing was that our waitress was not super attentive, she spent a lot of time in the kitchen talking to the cooks which we could see from the cook window. Maybe because it was the end of the night? But we were looking to get in and get out before they closed and it didn't seem like she was in any hurry. I chose the meatloaf (meatloaf of the gods) for the entree because of reviews. It was very good! I liked it a lot, but huge portion! Couldn't finish it, but that's definitely not a complaint. There was a side of marinara sauce? Maybe a nicer sauce instead of ketchup to serve with the meatloaf ? Tasted like cocktail sauce almost- I put it aside, didn't need it and also didn't like it. The mashed potatoes were good as well. The broccoli florets were huge. After dinner we shared a piece of coconut cream pie, which was amazing! Loved every bite, extremely good. Not sure if it's homemade or catered from somewhere- regardless I'm sure all pie is a safe bet here. My friends shared a peach cobbler milkshake and it did not even taste like peach. It almost tasted like strawberries or cherries. So that was odd, it definitely wasn't as good as the pie. But overall good diner style food, wish I tried the breakfast."}
{"text":"Monty's is where I went on my first date with my future husband. I love Monty's and always will.  The milk shakes and vegetarian fare are outstanding."}
{"text":"Their food is ok.  I would not call it special or extraordinary, but it is not bad.  The service is less than desirable."}
{"text":"solid place, good breakfast food. Shake is usually a bit much/rich, but great to share."}
{"text":"I have a love/not love relationship with Monty's. I used to love them for b-fast when I ate omlets. Now that I'm vegan, it's kinda hard to love them. Many of the items can't be changed, so if you're not a fan of onions or even allergic to them, they can't come out of items because they are pre-made in batches. They are my last ditch place to go to if Lazy Jane's, The Green Owl or any other place is busy or closed."}
{"text":"Going to see a show or concert across the street at the Barrymore? Well, we all have to eat somewhere, why not Monty's? The first time I laid eyes on this joint, it was a few weeks ago after skipping dinner and going to Bo Burnham. I wondered if it was a bar or a restaurant, a week later, I found out that it's kind of both! It's a classic diner that happens to serve alcohol. I ordered and enjoyed the mushroom and swiss, but I came in on a mission. To order a burger. Their menu almost distracted me from my mission by offering breakfast all day. Oh, I shall return to conquer the idea of Breakfast for Dinner another time!

Waffle fries! need I say more on this topic? Well, its Yelp, so yes. Just the right amount of crispy and not too many. I also managed a dessert on my first visit, that portion size of the Oat Fudge Bar was enough for me to have skipped the fries or the burger, it was huge! Sadly there were nuts mixed in (personal preference), but that didn't stop me.

I didn't opt-in for a shake, but I should have. All I've learned about my visit is that I will have to make another trip before my next Barrymore concert!"}
{"text":"I can't wait to go back to this place to have breakfast! My bf ordered the special for the day which was the biscuits and gravy. The biscuits were homemade and oversized. The gravy was also homemade with their homemade sausage and various spices. The gravy wasn't too thick and it was very flavorful, it didn't seem like it came from a box. 
I got the Florentine which was also very delicious. 
The place was very cute and set up like a diner. Oh and Coffee was also good. 
Def a place to go for breakfast!"}
{"text":"Fantastic vegetarian and nonvegetarian food alike, great ice cream, adult beverage selection is to die for. Bloody mary's on a sunday morning? Yes please."}
{"text":"The food is delicious! The seating isn't the best, but they make due. The wait isn't too long, but Sundays are always busy. There are many options for what your \"belly monster\" is screaming for..... I enjoy the liquor options. Staff is awesome.

Only complaint,  lack of parking."}
{"text":"We went here over the summer and I still dream about the biscuit that comes with the breakfasts.

The wait for brunch was long, but the free papers and indoor/outdoor waiting area made it entirely bearable. 

The menu, as others have mentioned, is very very vegetarian friendly. We tried the pesto + mushroom omelet, which was original and delicious, as was the spinach + feta omelet. 

We also tried a recommended milk shake, which was worth the splurge. 

This will be the first place we stop next time we are in Madison.

Our server was friendly and everything we ordered was delicious."}
{"text":"My friend said that whenever vegan or vegetarian friends visit, they want to go to Monty's so I was interested in trying it. We went for dinner. 

I got a peanut curry vegan dish that had a lot of vegetables and peanut sauce over rice. My paleo friend got grilled chicken skewers with grilled veggies and rice, while my other friend got chicken pot pie and a milkshake. 
All of our food was delicious, hearty, and reasonably priced. Obviously some of the food is not exactly what comes to mind as diner food. Due to their wider menu that suits a variety of tastes, I'd say it's a few steps above just 'diner,' nicer than Hubbard or Mickey's but not as fancy as Bassett Street Brunch Club. The dessert bar looked good but I was so full. 

Despite going on a weeknight, it was still buzzing with people. 
The service was great. I look forward to returning."}
{"text":"Really wanted to like it but I won't be back, the restaurant wasn't very clean, and my food was soggy. It was weird"}
{"text":"I have been going here since the 90s and it has been up and down.  Some ok food, some terrible.  Once found fatty masses in my meatloaf.  Recently it has been just ok.  Inexpensive, pretty fast but low quality compared to other places on Willy street and mediocre compared to the many good options in Madison."}
{"text":"I went here with some family from out of town. The food was delicious. I highly recommend the Monty's Cristo sandwich! The shakes and malts are a tad bit pricey for what you get, but the entrees are priced more reasonably."}
{"text":"I am a vegetarian and this is the only place i can get good comfort food!
Me and the bf started with the oreo shake.  We ordered one but they were nice enough to split it for us... and we didn't ask... bonus points there.
I ordered the meatless meatloaf sandwich, which was served open face with mashed potatoes and cashew gravy... It was weird looking but so so so delicious.  Made of carrots and cheese and other goodness the whole plate was fabulous!
BF got the TNT BLT... he was not a fan but I loved that too... just a basic veg blt, with the spicy waffle fries.  I do not like their ranch dressing though...it's like the generic brand.
For dessert we got some of the carrot cake and raspberry cheesecake to go... I will from now on always get dessert, it was the best part!!!
Next time I am trying the FAt Elvis Cake!!!

**update.***
Tried the Fat Elvis Cake... AMAZING!  Banana bread-cake layered with peanut butter frosting topped with chocolate frosting... Will definately get this again!"}
{"text":"Monty's is a classic diner in Madison. It offers lots of options for vegetarians so it draws a big crowd. I went with my girlfriends on Saturday @ 10:30 AM and we waited about 35 minutes to be seated. 

The wait staff was very good and attentive.  We had a toddler with us and the server made sure to place things out of her reach. It was quite considerate. 

The food was just ok in my opinion. I had Eggs Mornay and it was good but not amazing. The poached eggs were overdone so that there was no liquid egg yolk oozing out when I cut into them. It lost the creamy, velvetiness of the dish that I was looking for when I ordered the dish.

My friends said their food was ok too but not the best we've had.

This is not a brunch place you can sit and talk with your friends for an extended time. They have a huge wait list and we were asked politely to leave.

Not a place you can take extra time to catch up. This is a get in eat your food and leave place. 

Not sure I'd go back given there are so many other amazing brunch places in Madison."}
{"text":"This diner aims for a 50s diner aesthetic. I really liked the blue interiors and the bar/booth style seating inside.

The food was okay. I ordered a scrambled, which had tomatoes, onions, and bell peppers mixed in. I appreciated that the breakfast potatoes were not too salty. Coffee was decently strong too.

Overall we had a relatively pleasant experience here and I feel relatively neutral about the place, hence the 3 stars. I've heard the pie and donut game is strong here so I'll definitely be back to try."}
{"text":"I have returned again and again for Monty's eggs mornay. When I first ordered it I thought I was getting a typical eggs benedict for breakfast but then something so much better came out. Eggs mornay is eggs benedict made with a mornay sauce instead of hollondaise sauce. The mornay sauce is creamier and peppery! It is so good. I once met a man who ordered a different breakfast but asked for a side of the mornay sauce to dip his potatoes in...that's my kind of breakfast!

I've had their burgers and meatloaf as well, both are equally good but I keep coming back for the eggs mornay! I've also had their red velvet cupcakes which are pretty great too!"}
{"text":"Classic diner and menu style with modern twist (includes vegetarian/vegan options).  I love going here for breakfast.  The breakfast sandwich (with goat cheese) is divine.  My family always wants to come here when they visit.  Food is always fresh, staff is always on top of things, and it's a cool environment."}
{"text":"Everyone already knows how awesome Monty's Blue Plate Diner is, so I don't have to tell you that. Your carnivore and herbivore friends will love the menu. They source local ingredients, cook \"real\" food and even bring in local products such as YumButter and create extra, super-duper healthy menu items by partnering with Jon Hinds at Monkey Bar Gym.

However, I write this review because I recently ate the most amazing curry dish there. I've been craving it ever since and cannot wait to return. I'm serious, it was a hot, steaming bowl of freshly steamed vegetables with rice and a fantastic curry sauce. I want to eat this every day! Our server even told me that she actually DOES eat this every day and has since they put it on their menu. It was a huge bowl, so I took half of it home with me so I could enjoy a second meal of leftovers. 

Now drop everything and order this curry!

And order a piece of pie or enjoy an iced sugar cookie, too."}
{"text":"I came here for brunch on a saturday. I got the GLBT: Guacamole, lettuce, bacon and tomato. It was delicious! I love that this place serves Sprecher root beer. Seems like that's a standard for Madison, but I love it and I'm thrilled whenever I can order it. Yum! We also got one of their delicious pies to go, and it was killer. So even if you're full after breakfast or lunch, grab one of the desserts to go for later enjoyment. I thought service was good here; we got our food in a decent amount of time. 

Be warned, it can be hard to get to via car, since the street arrangement in that area is totally wacky. However, it's worth the hunt, since you get Monty's at the end. Now that the weather is nice, check out the botanical gardens afterwards, since it's close to this restaurant."}
{"text":"A solid diner specializing in scratch-made breakfasts and sandwiches. The local who brought be here said that Monty's tries to use local meats, veggies, etc. and I applaud that (especially in Wisconsin where all the local stuff is typically top-notch). I tried the Wisconsin salmon breakfast hash that was tasty and I cleaned my plate, but the dish was just a tad dry and needed a little something extra to make it more than the minced and griddled sum of its parts. Breakfast potatoes were solid and didn't provoke the usual request for Cholula/Tabasco. I appreciated the fact that fresh fruit is offered as a side with most breakfasts. Definitely hit the spot. Our server was very attentive and was exceedingly patient with our sleep-deprived indecision before ordering.

After glancing at the dessert case filled with ultra-decadent delights (cupcakes, cakes, etc.) I think I'd be up for returning on a future trip to Madison. A late-night sugar fix might be more in the cards than breakfast next time, though."}
{"text":"Hash was a smash for me. Also Tim the owner sang us a Dylan song. Great biscuits, also liked the potatoes. It is a must try if you are in Mad-town."}
{"text":"Cool!!!  Really enjoyed my meal. I had the Ruben sand which with a side of the corned beef hash. The sandwich was good. The corned beef hash was great. Didn't have room for desert this time but will definitely save room next time."}
{"text":"I've been here for dinner multiple times now, and have yet to be disappointed (not that I expect to!). The staff is very friendly and service is fast. I think I've been in and out in less than an hour when we had a show to catch nearby!

The food is delicious and there are plenty of vegetarian/vegan options to choose from. I've had the mac and cheese at least twice and absolutely love it!

The ambiance here is very home-y and low key - what you'd expect from a family-owned diner. I love it."}
{"text":"We dont live on that side of town any more but when we do go there on a Sunday, we like to stop there for lunch. And few times this summer even with gas price,we drove there for lunch.  You cant leave there without trying one of their pies or cakes. Usually,I wont have room after the regular food so I end up taking home the pie. Never been there without having to wait for 20 minute or so. But it's all worth the wait. I just wish they make the place just a little bigger or do soemthing about the noise level.  I'm a meat eatter but I tried their bean burger there and now that's all I eat there. Besides the dessert."}
{"text":"I really loved this restaurant! Homestyle, diner food with a twist - including lots of options for vegetarians. The service was outstanding, as people beyond my primary server helped ensure that my drink was full and needs addressed.

I had the Ultimate Mac, and it sure was ultimate! The best mac n' cheese I've ever had. The portion size was definitely enough for two to share. I tried not to think about the calories that I was consuming when I downed the entire bowl plus the two pieces of garlic bread that came with it."}
{"text":"Monty's is a retro diner. We originally went there because it was one of the few places open on new years day, but I was pleasantly surprised. They have a lot of classic American breakfast dishes. I had the tempeh hash with scrambled eggs which was quite good. It was flavorful and tasty."}
{"text":"This was 1 of my final 2 breakfasts in the great state of WI as I am leaving for Seattle on Wednesday this week. My mother and I came here on her request to go someplace new before I left town. I had not been here myself so I took her up on the offer. Our food was great! Good service, great coffee, fast food prep from order to plates on the table as well. Had a decent flow of people coming in the whole morning as well which must say something about the place. I highly suggest the sweet potato hash for breakfast and do try a biscuit or 2 as well, great with some honey and coffee! Great prices as well."}
{"text":"Fantastic pie! And food. And the servers were awesome. Now there's needs to be one in Indiana. And Ohio. In general they should just be everywhere."}
{"text":"It's a cute place.  The service was excellent. It was hard to choose from all the great-sounding items on the menu.  For the first ten minutes of my visit, I was really happy with it.  Then the food came.

Ohmigod, it was GROSS!  I ordered fettuchini with goat cheese, expecting a pile of noodles, some alfredo-ish sauce and cheese over the top, and maybe if I was lucky a few pine nuts or tomato bits or herbs.  Nuh-uh.

It was like somebody took a huge glob of cafeteria noodles, rolled them around in a cup of grated cheese, put a stick of butter on top and microwaved the whole mess on high for a minute.  The garlic bread was the kind of roll you'd use to make a sub sandwich dipped in some garlic butter.  My dog has deposited more appealing piles on the back lawn after gorging on leftovers.   Checking out the other tables, I doubt anything else would have been a better choice.

This is what they call comfort food--what Mom would give you to cheer you up after your Little League team lost or something.  I suppose people like this stuff because of the emotional connotations, I don't know.  My actual mom knew how to cook.  She would have called this stuff \"white food.\"  The servings are huge, except for the side salad which could have fit in a teacup.

Many people love this diner.  If you're a mac-and-cheese type person, you may very well love it too."}
{"text":"I always have awesome food here. I am ready to start tryign out awesome coctails"}
{"text":"I haven't been to Monty's in at least 15 years, so it was really nice to visit Madison and return to find it just as great as I remember.  Great atmosphere and excellent service.  Really excellent service. I had the Blackened Salmon Salad, which was great - I love that they have some healthy options.  My kids opted for pancakes, eggs and bacon - all good.  My husband, who usually comments on how expensive a meal outside McDonald's is, actually made a \"hey reasonable price\" sort of comment.  That's sayin' something for the value!"}
{"text":"This place has fantastic food and lots of vegetarian options. I have had many meals here and they are consistently tasty. My go-to sandwich is the TNT BLT. Fabulous. Besides the good food, the building has a fun and clean throwback diner atmosphere. Generally, the staff are very friendly. The only bad thing I can say about this place is I don't like their homemade ranch. It's not for me. Everything else is great."}
{"text":"Part of the Madison based Food Fight Inc (16 restaurants currently?), Monty's was the first, or one of the first.  They are all different, yet are the same in one way.  They are good places to eat.

Monty's is styled after a 50's diner - counter, chrome, lots of \"traditional\" diner foods, and a lot that you never got at a diner.  Service is fast, food is good, prices are reasonable (but not cheap) and wait staff is friendly.  Feels neighborhood friendly, although they bring in people from all over the area.  Plenty of good vegetarian options also.

Food is interesting, with lots of things not found in your typical diner.   Coffee is from Just Coffee (that is a bonus feature people - if you like coffee, this is a great place) and many of the specials are made with organic foods.  Want a burger but don't eat meat?  Swap out the Walnut burger - which, as a meat eater, I can say is good.  Certainly better than their hamburger.  Speaking of which...

What is up with that hamburger?  First off, it comes medium well done - no burger should ever be cooked to that.  Second, it is heavily, and funky seasoned.  As in, if I ordered it, it would go back.  A good burger needs salt and pepper.  They add a bunch of stuff.  However my niece who ordered it liked it, so we kept it.

Deserts are very popular at Monty's, but that was our disappointment.  Cheesecake was rubbery and the carrot cake was dry - stale dry.  Really?  I am almost tempted to go to three stars just for that.

Overall, I have to stick with four stars.  Great coffee, mostly really good, and interesting, food, fast, good service.  Without a doubt I will be back if in the area.  But I will skip desert."}
{"text":"Vegan food options!
Okay so I walked up to this place and was pleasantly suprised - it is a REAL diner! So cool! I ordered on the phone and was just stopping in to grab food. It is a busy place, decent size inside but it seemed full up. My food was ready and although busy the waitress was pleasant. I ordered the Sheldon (their vegan reuban) and strawberry rhubarb pie. Prices are fair! It is in a good location. Many other restuarants, bars and little shops around. I would have loved to have been with a gaggle of girls, dressed in 50s clothes to fully enjoy the diner atmosphere. They have a few different vegan options available. 

The Sheldon was okay, not really a rueben. I would eat it again just not with such high expectations (sorry nothing has yet to come close to Chicago Diners amazing rueben). Bread  was good, the meat was just slices of tofu... and they tasted lemony, then the sourkraut and the sauce was just... veganaise. I havent tried the pie yet but it looks good!

Id try it again. Happy to try new foods and cute places!"}
{"text":"Decent food and mediocre service. We heard the waitress tell her coworkers she doesn't like talking to people. A little unprofessional but the vegan menu is awesome!"}
{"text":"Super Vegan/Vegetarian friendly, and can will accommodate any and all tastes!

The menu is pretty much impossible to choose from, since there are so many delicious items on it. I usually break down and get one of their awesome burgers. I only travel to Madison once every couple years to visit family, and I frequently think back to how yummy their Walnut veggie patties are.
My Grammy always orders a chocolate malt and the waffle fries (which are top-notch). She's 93, and she knows what's up.
This is the place to be."}
{"text":"I'm a regular for their omelettes, which are amazing! As well as their salmon hash, but recently I stopped by for dinner. Their meatloaf of gods was pretty good. It was a tad bit salty for my taste but the gravy was on point."}
{"text":"I'm a sucker for good breakfast, and Monty's does not disappoint. Their menu includes all of the classics: omelettes, pancakes, etc. along with a few unique options. 

I'm somewhat of a traditionalist, so have stuck with the country breakfast and omelettes on my trips here. Each time, the eggs and potatoes have been perfectly cooked. Another thing I love about this place: my coffee cup NEVER goes empty. 

If you're looking for a diner atmosphere with friendly service, I highly suggest stopping here!"}
{"text":"Still 5 stars, but I am disappointed.  Some of my faves are no longer in the menu (Vegetarian pot pie?  Gone?  Wtf!).  Some of my faves have changed (Tnt, for example).  I see what's going on.  They are trying so hard to use local food that the quality has been sacrificed.  Not cool. If I wanted tempeh from some head-barely-above-water Indonesian restaurant, I would drive the 2 miles and go there.  Just use the tempeh you used to use!  Better taste (and probably lower cost too) is the way to go. Don't worry about supporting other local businesses if their products don't deliver."}
{"text":"It's impossible to have a bad meal at Monty's. I've never actually met him... but he is on to something! 

Why do I love it?
1. They have vegan shakes! Yes, vegan... now as a lactose intolerant vegetarian this was music to my ears. I ordered a vegan shake with walnuts and banana's. Oh em gee.... they give you a glass and a half. It's a lot. It could put you in a diabetic coma but who cares. I took it home and it took me 2 days to finish. Yes, it was a cheat day but I wasn't going for a setback.
2. They have/had vegetarian gravy. It was a special item on the menu one day - one of the best biscuits and veggie gravy I have ever had!
3. They have a TON of vegetarian options.... in fact too many. My indecisive excited brain just can't make up my mind. My hubby dare not order the same thing I do - because we have to share. 

We have brought our friends from Chicago here and they loved it as well."}
{"text":"Really love it here, I would come here a lot more often if it were easier to get a table during meal times.

The space is totally retro, very comfortable and has the chill feel of Madison. There isn't really seating for groups larger than about six people, and even then it can be a squeeze.

I've always considered their meals to be very consistent, which is key. My favorite thing is their GBLT and waffle fries. The sandwich has some awesome chipotle sauce that gives it a special kick and the guac is always fresh tasting.

Another highlight: alcoholic milkshakes, hell yeah! 

I like the range of the menu, there are many vegetarian and vegan options, and breakfast is served allllll day!

The staff is always very friendly, service can be a little slow, but it generally isn't an issue because the place is pretty small."}
{"text":"Very yummy.  We brought out of town friends here who have food intolerances and they were very happy to be able to pick from several items on the menu.  Very cute restaurant."}
{"text":"Monty's Blue Plate Diner is one of those funny contradictions-in-terms that is a restaurant which is both good but overrated.  Overall, though, it is far and away my favorite Food Fight place and a fairly reliable spot to get a good meal.

Monty's food is better than hit-or-miss but not quite consistently good.  Most of the things I've eaten there, especially the breakfast foods, have been delicious (and huge), but I've had a couple of very sub-par meals (one was so bad I literally could not eat more than a couple of bites).  The things that I ate and disliked are now off the menu, so that does say something for their ability to identify what's working and what isn't.  What I can say is that the egg-based breakfast-y menu items are almost universally good.  The \"scrambled something-or-other\" never fails to disappoint, nor does the newer Blue Plate Omelet (the one with cheddar, avocado and bacon... good lord!).  And the breakfast burrito is especially good, even without chorizo (which is how I usually order it).  As for the breakfast side items, the potatoes are just okay; the biscuits are great.  Most importantly of all, the coffee is superb (even my mother thinks so and she drinks a hell of a lot more coffee than I do).  Unfortunately, I tend to shy away from the lunch and dinner items so I can't really speak to their quality.  The pies, though, are heaven.  And it's certainly worth noting that the menu pays special attention to including veg*n options.

The atmosphere is pretty awesome.  Outdoor seating is spacious and comfy.  Indoors, the blue-topped tables are fun for making patterns with the wet bottom of your water glass.  Get a booth if you can; the tables are a bit cramped.  The waitstaff are generally friendly and attentive.

The upshot is that if you think you'll enjoy eating at a diner that's 70% greasy spoon and 30% hipster hot spot, and if you like breakfast foods and are a \"good orderer\" (you choose from menus wisely), Monty's is an excellent choice."}
{"text":"Great food! I love the breakfast burrito. Service is excellent. Easy parking. Great vegetarian selection for my veggie friends."}
{"text":"Situated in a cutesy little piece of the Atwood neighborhood, Monty's Blue Plate Diner is a great place for breakfast. A cozy little diner with a muted 60s feel, Monty's offers the usual diner breakfast standbys: pancakes, french toast, omelettes, etc. while also offering more trendy choices such as breakfast burritos, chilaquiles, and huevos rancheros. Check in with Yelp and get a coupon for free bottomless coffee. Their mimosas are top notch too. I highly recommend the huevos rancheros with black beans and chorizo- they are awesome. Get there early if possible because this place is usually hopping."}
{"text":"Iconic Diner and true Madison experience. Great for breakfast or brunch if you can get a seat. The only reason I am dissuaded from going is the wait, which speaks volumes about popularity. The menu choices are wonderful."}
{"text":"We arrived today at 11am and were told that the wait was 10mins. 30 mins later and we were finally seated. It's been 40 mins now and we still don't have any of our food. The table next to us arrived 15 mins after we sat and they are now eating. Unbelievably bad service and only a weak apology aren't going to cut it. This will be the last time I ever eat here."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite diner in Madison.   We've been eating here for years and it always a good meal.   I've enjoyed their spinach, feta and mushroom omelet, Mediterranean platter, meatloaf of the gods, and chicken in a pie (to name a few meals).   All were yummy each time I had them.  The service is always great no matter what time of day.   During the dinner rush and weekends you might have to wait to be seated but it's well worth it.   
My kids enjoy the kids meal options and usually finish all of what they order.   
They have vegetarian, vegan and gluten free options as well.   
And you can't forget about the pies.   So much goodness!  In fact on occasion my friends and I meet up there just for pie. 
Perfect location for friends, family and even a casual date night."}
{"text":"The Food Fight group never disappoints, and Monty's Blue Plate Diner is no exception. We loved the extensive brunch menu here. We did have to wait around 20 minutes, but there's some nice outdoor dining space and so we didn't mind waiting outside in the warm weather. Once we were seating, the waiter was extremely efficient. Our orders were taken right away and we probably didn't wait more than 10 minutes for our food. They have a large variety of brunch choices. The bloody marys come with a side car of beer as well. The booths were cozy and overall felt like old fashion diner. Would definitely visit again!"}
{"text":"Had a great meal with some old friends who adore this place, and I can see why. Imagine a retro diner that serves breakfast all day ... and lots of sandwiches, burgers and other entreees ... and several vegetarian and vegan options ... and has a killer bakery ... and allows kids to play with sidewalk chalk outside. What's not to love? I really wanted to try the TNT BLT or the GBLT (clever), but they ran out of tempeh, so I chose the almond milk french toast, which was divine, and a biscuit. I really wanted a slice of pie, but was worried about drifting into a food coma on the drive back to Chicago. Next time ...."}
{"text":"I don't understand why this place is popular.  The food was bad and the service was bad.  I ordered a burger medium well and got it medium rare.  After sending it back and getting another it was still medium/medium rare but I was too hungry to send it back again and lost all faith in their cooks.  I think they served it on the same plate with the same cold fries as before.  My friend ordered a breakfast dish and it was terrible.  The scrambled eggs were so overcooked they were hard and rubbery, the potatoes were very undercooked, and the biscuit was dry and literally had no flavor.  None.  The service seriously lacked as well.  No one was unfriendly, just incompetent.

We thought the dessert would redeem them but after paying so much for a single slice of cheesecake we couldn't even finish it.  One slice was dried out and the other cheesecake had too much sour cream - it was actually mushy and very sour, almost spoiled tasting.

Bottom line, I found this place to be mediocre at best, and that's being generous. There's tons of better restaurants in the area and in the city.  Never going back, and I think the food has made me ill."}
{"text":"Been here twice. Comfortable spot with great booths for that diner feel. I got the corned beef hash twice because they use hand cut (not canned) corned beef. 

The coffee is great. The jalapeño toast is a nice touch. Also, they have plenty of vegan and vegetarian options if you're into that kinda thing."}
{"text":"I've eaten there dozens of times. Their eggs mornay is the best in town. Kudos to Tim and his excellent staff and the great waitstaff.."}
{"text":"I want to slap 2014 me in the face for only giving this restaurant 3 stars. 

There was a time that I ate here almost weekly, primarily ordering the same couple of things: the chicken pot pie or their breakfast sandwich. 

The chicken pot pie is served with mashed potatoes and a yummy roll, and the pie itself is stuffed with tender cubed chicken, lots of creamy gravy and an assortment of fresh veggies. The breakfast sandwich is uniquely served on spicy grilled jalapeno bread, with goat cheese, applewood smoked bacon, spinach, egg and tomatoes with a side of fried potatoes. It's a messy sandwich, but deliciously so.

Monty's is always the go to spot when I have family in town. It's perfect for the picky eaters, or vegetarians/vegans. Everyone can find something to enjoy here.

Don't even get me started on their desserts."}
{"text":"Great diner with tons of vegetarian and vegan options.   They even have the Trempeleau walnut burger!! My husband got the Elvis shake, which was beautiful and he must have liked because he gobbled it up."}
{"text":"We went here for breakfast on a Sunday. It was very crowded, but we only had to wait 20-30 minutes. I'm not gonna lie, some of the staff seem incompetent, but they are nice in general. I am giving it 3 because:

-Cool, old style, but generic diner interior
-Reasonable prices
-Food was decent
-Crowd was good, chill
-there were a good number of veg options, but not too many for us meat eaters (yum)"}
{"text":"Lots of good vegan and vegetarian options if you're in the mood for diner food. It can get really busy here on the weekends, so it's best to go at off-peak times.

Also, your phone won't get service inside their building."}
{"text":"Monty's is a Madison must go to! It always has a wait, but the staff does an excellent job getting tables flipped quickly. I almost never have to wait the full time they say. I went there today and the food was fantastic. The service was amazing, they kept our drinks full and made sure to get everything we needed. My group got both breakfast and lunch/dinner options. All meals came well prepared and tasted yummy! I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Loved the breakfast options and want to try lunch sometime. Classic diner feel with excellent twists, and amazing vegan-friendly options. I also had an old-fashioned cinnamon sugar donut; almost as good as Greenbush's (so that's saying something). Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Madison for a trip, we came here for lunch. It looks like vintage american dinner. I ordered Roast chicken & goat cheese sandwich (without the bacon), it was really good. I don't remember what my hubby ordered I was busy making love with my sandwich. But I do remember him liking my food more. 

Check in on yelp and you will get a free coffee.
If you need a family friendly good old American diner than look no further. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This is a diner and should be treated as such- the service is hit-or-miss, the atmosphere isn't anything special, and everything on the menu is pretty good. A few tips for enjoying all this place has to offer: 
1. Share a malt or shake with someone- they are delicious and HUGE, so way too much to eat with the well-portioned meals, but half of one is perfect and satisfying.
2. Find something that you like on the menu and stick with it- there are a number of exceptional things on the menu (i.e. the Meatless Meatloaf), but everything else is average.

I'd probably give this 3 stars, but the amount of vegetarian options is fantastic and deserves another star."}
{"text":"I was told this place had great food and killer chocolate malts. I have never been so disappointed in looking at food. I ordered corn beef hash and since I was on a job a block away I figured I'd get the food to go. Literally a 30 second walk to the office. The corn beef hash was more small cut up potato hash with a bit of square pieces of some meat that had no taste. The entire thing was nasty. Let's get to this awesome chocolate malt. I pulled off the paper from the straw after walking out the door only to get a chocolate milk not a chocolate malt. Considering it's 26° outside this couldn't have melted from the door to the street. I really like eating in different cities each week but this was the worst experience I've had in years."}
{"text":"My review would probably be higher, had I not just the other day had one of the worst meals of my life at Monty's Blue Plate diner. My meatloaf sandwich was so salty is almost inedible. At first I thought it was the gravy that had the excessive salt, then I figured it was the meatloaf. After plodding through this sodium-induced nightmare I realized that the whole damn thing was pure salt, like that one episode of the Original Series Star Trek, the one with the salt beast, that's made of pure sodium. 

This place has a varied menu with a good selection of vegan or vegetarian dishes. I would recommend the Palomino or Comet in MIlwaukee, both vegan and vegetarian friendly diners, over this place any day of the week."}
{"text":"Breakfast this AM. Tempeh with potatoes , onions green peppers and eggs was a disappointment!! I think I found two pieces of tempeh which would both fit on my little finger nail. A spec of green pepper, same for onion. Lots of diced potatoes. Good flavor. 

My friend had the zucchini potatoes pancakes which were incredible.

Would return but would no order the Tempeh. Again."}
{"text":"Always enjoy a good meal every time I go here. All day breakfast is great and there are some great healthy options to choose from too. I really like the Tex Mex Omelet personally."}
{"text":"Monty's is awesome.  Their vegetarian comfort food is great and there are lots of choices.  Get the spicy waffle fries with your sandwich; they are not actually spicy, but they're delicious.  I also love the milkshakes!"}
{"text":"Great homemade soups, Such a tasty place. It was crazy busy but once we got seated everything flowed at the right pace. 

Always try the soups!"}
{"text":"Monty's Blue Plate is a local gem.  Expect unique menu items that focus on tasty, healthy, and fresh.  They have things like burgers that you would expect at any diner but they do their own unique spin on standards.  My latest meal was a burger with carmelized onions, herbed goat cheese, and spinach..  Sooo good.  They are also sort of famous for their bean salad - even my two year old goes for that one.

After your meal you have an array of some of the best cakes and pies.  Their carrot cake is the best I have ever had and sometimes we will go there just for that!"}
{"text":"I've eaten at Monty's probably 3 dozen times over the past two years and I've noticed that while the quality of ingredients remains high, the preparation consistency is low.  One of my favorite items is their breakfast potatoes and sometimes they're perfect but often they are either raw or burnt.  Today I ordered a breakfast sandwich and  specified the egg over hard...it was almost raw.

The service is also hit or miss.  Some servers are EXCELLENT, but there's this guy there that is just BAD.  He's stuck up, doesn't refill coffee (i literally had to get up and get our own), and didn't' even bother to give a damn when my wife mentioned that the zucchini pancakes were bad (they were gross).  

I'm done with Monty's.  There's plenty of good breakfast places in Madison to give my money to."}
{"text":"Great food, good service, fun vibe, always busy for weekend brunch. Worth the wait."}
{"text":"Loved going to this place. As a night shift worker, this was the best place for a good breakfast and good drink. Recommend highly!"}
{"text":"East siders love this place. I have always thought it highly average. My wife wanted to go recently. My reaction, \"Meh.\" But I went. She had the veggie hash, which she really liked. So I boosted my otherwise 2-star rating by 1. I had the salmon hash. My reaction? It was cooked. The little cubed potatoes were not the least bit crispy. But they were cooked. The meal was not bad. It was bland. I didn't make a disgust face or anything. The booths are remarkably uncomfortable. The place looks good. The coffee was pretty good. We were served food. We ate. When we finished, we were no longer hungry."}
{"text":"I have been going to Monty's ever since they opened, lately not as much as I could simply because of an increasing budget, but when I get the chance I am there! 

If you are veg or vegan, this place treats you right, Meatless Meatloaf of the Gods, Vegan Shakes Etc...this place does it like Mom & Grandma did, simple yet delish comfort food!! 

Have to mention the amazing staff always watching to make sure your soda or coffee is refilled. I have to stop now, I am getting a bit teary eyed!!"}
{"text":"So good!!! Fun diner atmosphere. Great service! Had the sweet potato hash with two over easy eggs... substituted the Silly Yak jalapeño cheddar bread for the brisket! Everything was fresh -- the sweet potato veggie blend hash was wonderful!! Stop by if you are in Madison!!!"}
{"text":"Monty's is the epitome of decent/average diner food. They do ok corned beef from scratch, ok breakfasts, ok meatloaf, all with nice portions. It's a good place to sit and talk and eat. 

But what really makes Monty's a recommended location is their attention to gluten-free, vegan, and other dietary lifestyles or restrictions. Instead of having to ask, the menu offers many alternatives to regular meat/wheat fare. In this way, their 'ok' everything approach is elevated to specialty diet destination. Finally, a place to go without worry to have a normal diner experience for those (such as a couple of my family members and friends) with food allergies. Highest recommendation if this applies to your experience. Genuine place for 'something for everyone' eating."}
{"text":"great diner with good veggie and vegan options.
overall very nice staff, friendly, prompt
great desserts!"}
{"text":"Still not a good restaurant. Variable quality of food and service, still overpriced. I tried to give it a few more chances, and its still mediocre at best."}
{"text":"Great diner with a very creative menu.  You can certainly get your traditional eggs-and-bacon breakfast, or you can opt for a tofu scramble or zucchini potato pancakes.  What more could you ask for?  I have only eaten here for breakfast, but the desserts are tempting, too."}
{"text":"This place is overall fantastic. There is a hip diner atmosphere, the servers are always very attentive, and there are so many options for food!

There are several vegetarian and vegan options, for both breakfast and lunch/dinner. If you are (or aren't!) a vegetarian, try the Vegetarian Hash or the Meatless Loaf of the Gods. Both are insanely tasty and huge!"}
{"text":"We arrived about 1 on a Saturday.  It was really busy as expected.  20 minute wait, but then we were seated in a nice booth.  Our server was great.  She offered suggestions and didn't seem rushed.

I had biscuits and gravy and two eggs.  Potatoes on the side.  My wife had oatmeal, a muffin and fresh fruit.  The biscuits were particularly good.  The gravy had some green pepper in it.  Not my favorite.  And the potatoes were overseasoned with something like a cajun spice.  Gut buster for me.

Overall, a really good lunch, fine service.  We'll return.

Oh yeah, dessert.  I had a hard time deciding between the strawberry rhubarb pie and the carrot cake.  The server assured me the carrot cake was fresh baked, not a frozen somewhere else dish.  I took it to go.  

Good choice.  Moist, full flavor.  Next time...the pie!"}
{"text":"Came here for a pre-movie dinner with my girlfriend (who is vegan, I am not), and I was delighted by the cool, 50s-esque atmosphere of the building, and their commitment to serving all with their extensive vegan/vegetarian menu. We were able to both eat and be full for just under $20, so the prices were fair. Higher for the vegan items, but that's to be expected. I also enjoyed their commitment to serving local products in their food. The plates might not have been blue and I may not have gotten thousand island with my tofu Reuben, but that's excusable. The service was excellent and friendly. Would come back."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here on the recommendation of an employee of the hotel we stayed at. We were kind of excited, because the person who recommended it seemed pretty cool and knowledgeable. And he may very well be knowledgeable in a lot of things, but I'm not sure food recommendations should be one of them.

My husband does not recall what he had, but I had the \"Scrambled Something or Other\" (I think that's the name?) It was so-so but nothing to write home about. The coffee was pretty \"meh,\" as was the service. Also, our table and the tables around us were kind of messy and... gross.

Not feeling it. Probably wouldn't come back."}
{"text":"Moderately long wait, but what an adorable place! Got and split corned beef hash and the salmon hash and a bloody.. whew! Delish! Very different and yet amazing. Great service too.

Need to come back and get the boozy milkshakes and the cake!

Pro tip: free iced tea refills!"}
{"text":"I always associate this place with the airport in Madison; I always eat here either when I arrive or when I leave. It's a greasy spoon kind of institution, but done really well. As an example, biscuits and gravy is one of those dishes that's good just about anywhere, but Monty's manages to kick it over the top by including marinaded peppers or the like that give it a little extra flavor. All of the dishes are like that: fresh ingredients, nicely spiced and seasoned, etc. The prices are also very reasonable, so you basically get the low prices of a typical diner, but the food is actually really good.

Honestly, the only downside seems to be the wait for seating: I don't think I've ever gotten a table right away, but I can't fault them for being popular."}
{"text":"The food was ok! Prices were reasonable. I got the almond French toast. It was simple, came with a side of fruits. Coffee was really strong and just what I needed for the morning. My boy friend got the steak hash. It was alright for the price, nothing special! Would I come back for breakfast? Nope!"}
{"text":"If your vegetarian or not you will LOVE this place...  I think they put crack in their food its so good! I like everything here, but I take it to go.. I hate being the creep lone diner - no Table for One ... There is on weird waiter I must admit but the food is so good .... I like their hash and their tofu scramble ..."}
{"text":"This place is cool, I went today after a horrible experience at bassett..... I had the scrambler it had pesto feta mushrooms and came with potatoes and a biscuit, oh mylanta do these fuckers know what they're doing. The plate was absolutely stunning I had to fight myself not to order a second. I skipped the dessert case but I definitely took a gander and it looks like they know what they're doing there too. Coffee sucks though."}
{"text":"I always try and get here at least once when I go to Madison.  The food is always good.  I love the tofu scramble.  A great mix of traditional diner food with some great healthy alts."}
{"text":"Going to Monty's can feel like coming home. The place is warm and welcoming, the booths tall and spacious, staff gracious, coffee poured and refilled to your heart's delight... They're not reinventing the wheel with most of the menu but the breakfast dishes hit the spot, especially if they come with a warm, buttery biscuit. The GLBT (guacamole, lettuce, bacon, tomato) sandwich is the BEST. (Caveat: you might need to drink a gallon of water afterwards.) But really, it's a tremendous place. And you can ogle the pies and cakes on your way in or out."}
{"text":"The great thing about this diner is the diversity of the menu. There's tons of options to choose from so it's hard not to find something that you like.

I'm guessing that it was just a fluke, but my biggest complaint was that the diner was cold! It was colder inside than it was outside. My wife and I (the people at the tables around us) had to wear our jackets the whole time. I had to scarf down my food, only couple minutes after arriving at the table it was already getting cold.

I ordered the Wisconsin Salmon Hash and it was pretty good. I was expecting a nice fillet of fish with my hash, but the salmon was pretty skimpy. Small pieces scattered throughout. It came with some pineapple, melon and a biscuit. The fruit was fresh and complimented the hash well. The biscuit wasn't bad but would have been much better if it had been served warm."}
{"text":"5 starts for being one of the few places I have ever been that has full on, decked out vegan breakfasts!  No wimpy smoothies or oatmeal here.  I'm talking tofu scramble and vegan hash.  I'm in love..."}
{"text":"Monty's is a great place to go if you like breakfast. Service is friendly and I didn't wait very long for a despite going on a Sunday morning.
The portion size is generous and coffee + free refills is inexpensive!
I ordered Sweet Potato Hash and enjoyed it!

My classmate recommended this place to me and I recommend it to all of you!"}
{"text":"Great food! I've gone here a few times and have never been dissatisfied. The first time was before a show across the street, it was busy for sure! We were seated promptly and our server was friendly. I ordered a wrap and fries. Pretty great! The second time was more recently and it was a great time. No line, no wait. The server was slow but the food was amazing! I got the veggie meatloaf with mashed potatoes. This was to die for! I've never had something like this and it was flavorful, creamy, and delicious. The food came out in a timely manner, which was great. We sat for awhile until it got busy. The overall experience was good. This dinner feel reminded me of Middleton's famous restaurant. This one is right up there, and I will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Won best greasy spoon in Madison, yet has vegan options and bean salad as an alternative to fries! Yes, a great retro diner, but with modern options. And a dessert case. Awesome!"}
{"text":"I have been going to Monty's for years and I have always had the same thing to say:  the service sucks.

The food is okay, I mean, it's a diner.  There is a wide variety of vegetarian options which is nice.  I also have to mention that I won't be eating here again soon as they have very recently taken my 2 favorite items off the menu; the tuna steak sandwich, and the cajun chicken sandwich.  The cumin chipotle mayonnaise on the tuna sandwich was one of the only reasons I would even still go to Monty's.

The service is always terrible.  you can count on a long wait for your waiter to take your order, for them to bring your drinks, and your food, and the longest wait of all is always for the check.  I have contemplated a dine and dash many times.  I counted the minutes one time, and it was 45 minutes from the time I finished eating to when the check came.  It wasn't because the waitress didn't see me from behind the counter either, she was talking to another server.  Once, I was eating with a friend, and we were waiting for 15 minutes to even have our waiter come to the table, so we just left.   Believe me, the service being slow is never because there isn't enough servers or too many diners.   

The food is decent, but it's not great by any means. It is still pretty okay, although I've had some bad meals.  The meatless meatloaf is only saved by the cashew gravy, and the salmon cakes are awful.  The tuna sandwich was really good, but the size and bun has changed over the years, and recently been replaced by 3 kinds of pastrami sandwiches.   The grilled chicken salad is good, as is the feta dill burger."}
{"text":"I'm doing my due diligence and belatedly reviewing some of the restaurants that have treated me well as a resident of Madison, and Monty's is one of the best. I discovered Monty's when they had a food cart on the Library Mall a couple years ago. Though I sadly haven't seen it there since, that was where I was first introduced to their sublime meatloaf sandwich, their amazing Just Coffee Co-Op coffee (a big plus, for those of you from outside the area, some of the best coffee in town and they're ethically sound to boot), and their donuts. Oh, the donuts.

Soon after repeated good experiences at the cart, I visited their location across town. Monty's has become my standby breakfast and lunch recommendation to anyone who comes into the area, and I've been there with family multiple times. To begin with, there are the donuts. Fluffy, fresh, and perfect for dunking in the awesome coffee. Then there's the biscuits. They come with many of the breakfast dishes and they are mouth-wateringly awesome, particularly with a little butter and honey.

But the main event is even better than the side dishes. Monty's offers some of the most vegan and vegetarian friendly choices in town short of the straight up veggie restaraunts. They use fresh, local ingredients, and that adds up to some of the best eating you can get in the area. While I recommend their breakfast sandwich heartily, my real suggestion for an egg lover at breakfast time is their Eggs Mornay. It's the best Benedict-like dish I think I've had anywhere. Savory sauce that's not too heavy, and, that most important of things - perfectly cooked eggs with slightly runny yolks. Basically anything I've had has been amazing.

If you can't tell already, I'm a bit of an evangelist for Monty's, but I can't help it. It was one of my first great foodie experiences in town, and I keep on coming back for just that reason. Keep in mind that they are well-loved and busy, so I recommend getting their early, particularly on Sundays for breakfast, but I've never waited longer than 20 minutes to sit down. The awesome retro ambiance and neon appliance sculpturing are just added bonuses, as are the super cute waiterati of both genders who've given great, speedy, professional service every time I've gone. Go to Monty's. You'll be a happier person for it."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time. The food was great and filled me up which normally doesn't happen when I eat out. The waitress Peach was really friendly and very attentive to our table. Will definitely make a return trip here for a 2nd round."}
{"text":"Friendly staff and nice selection of vegetarian options.  Food is just okay, not great.  Makes me wonder why everyone likes Food Fight so much."}
{"text":"Shut your mouth!  Meatloaf of the Gods!  There are three types of meat rolled into this meatloaf.  It comes with a red wine gravy, mashed potatoes and veggies.  All of this for $10.  Yup, a complete, well-rounded, mouth watering meal for just $10.  

The broccoli was blanched rather than steam.  So it was not mushy.  

The service is incredible.  The people are friendly and the food comes up fast.  I have nothing but good things to say.  On a date?  With family?  Have a small child?  Check this place out.  

They get desserts from a local bakery.  The carrot cake is ridiculous.  Are you full from your meal?  Take cake or pie to go.  Seriously, you will not regret a snack for later."}
{"text":"Tried this place a second time, as we had out of town guests who wanted breakfast, but it was after 1 PM (late sleepers). Food was a bit better this time, but the service was atrocious. I'd skew my review more towards three stars on this visit. Basically, I still think this place is a bit overrated but it's a decent place for breakfast or lunch- IF you can find a time to get in when it's not too busy."}
{"text":"Adorable decor.  This diner has history and a lot of character.

Excellent, knowledgeable and experienced waitress Jennifer recommended the vegan Indian vegetable curry with rice, and I liked her recommendation.  The coconut-flavored sauce was very tasty and extremely filling.  I wish the dish had less rice and more vegetables."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time and we loved it!! 

My husband and I are vegan and finding places to eat without just ordering a salad and fries is very difficult. For our anniversary, he scouted out some Madison vegan/vegetarian-friendly places and this restaurant's menu compelled me to pick it for our date. Why else we loved Monty's:

-Plenty of parking available (in their own lot) in what I thought may be a crammed downtown area
-Delicious menu of breakfast served all day, sandwiches, and desserts (regular or veg/vegan friendly!!)
-friendly staff
-FAST service--we waited maybe 10 min for our food
(He ordered a sandwich with fries and I ordered banana walnut pancakes) with water refills
-Reasonable prices (a dinner bill at $20?!)
-Cute diner feel 

Even though this place is a bit of a drive for us, we will be back!"}
{"text":"I picked Monty's for dinner because I was on the road with a co-worker and had no idea what his taste in food might be.  I go for healthy and/or veg fare whenever I can, and since Monty's has an extensive vegetarian section on its menu as well as traditional diner dishes, I figured we'd both be happy.  

And we were!  My dish was roasted vegetables with spinach, quinoa, and fresh mozzarella which I liked but found a little oily (too much dressing).  It was also not quite enough food for me, and I don't have a big appetite to begin with.  Co-worker had some sort of turkey dinner that he liked enough that he trusted me to pick the restaurants we ate at for the rest of the week.

Service was ok but there was a bit of a wait for a table.  The wait was worth it, though, and I'd definitely be a regular here if I lived in Madison."}
{"text":"Friday night in Wisconsin and we couldn't resist the fish fry. It didn't disappoint. Fast, flavorful, perfectly crisp and just the right amount of food. I love that they have a local beer selection on tap and in bottles. Service was attentive and friendly. While waiting, we had the opportunity to observe their operations and I was suprised. The man that appeared to be the manager or owner, was helping in any way that he could. I think we watched him take reservations, run water, bus tables, greet guests, seat guests, basically anything to help offer excellent customer service. The highlight was the PIE! Oh my! I had a slice of oreo deliciousness that rocked my world! Light and fluffy with an oreo cruble crust and a huge slice. I savored that one piece three times! Worth every calorie! I can't wait to go back and try others dishes! 

Oh and they also have an extensive vegan menu if that's your thing."}
{"text":"I've never been even remotely let down by Monty's.  Is it busy a lot?  Yes.  Are you probably going to have to wait 30 minutes to sit down?  Yes.  Is the service slow because it's so busy?  Yes.  I've never been under the impression that the service is slow because they're incompetent, but just because they're busy.  Besides that, I've never noticed it being *especially* slow... just kind of slow, which doesn't really bother me.

Let me take a moment here to recommend the Meatloaf Sandwich: Get it served cold.  Just trust me here.  Do not get it hot.  I've had it served both ways: Cold, it is a sandwich so delicious that fireworks go off in your head; Warm, it is an open-faced abomination with gravy and mashed potatoes poured all over it.

Their cheeseburger was surprisingly good (I'd even go so far to say that it's one of the best burgers I've had in Madison).  They had a special entree one evening, \"Cheeseburger Mac & Cheese,\" which was out of this world.  It really tasted like a cheeseburger over noodles!  They serve a great chef salad, have awesome spicy waffle fries, and I would die 100 times over for the buttermilk biscuits they serve with breakfast.  Their expansive dessert case is as tasty as it is impressive looking.

I was beyond sold on this place one time when I ordered a piece of german chocolate cake for dessert.  It wasn't a piece so much as it was a towering slab.  It was so tall, in fact, that it wasn't until I'd eaten enough of it that I noticed that the waiter (who was wearing a mohawk and kilt) had written, \"Das ist Deutsch\" in chocolate on the plate.  

I've had questionable service twice: Once was when I reserved a pie for a dinner I was going to and they did not have it when I got there, but tried to placate me by selling me a larger, more expensive pie.  That was after I approached the counter and saw several staff members stare at me for 20 minutes before I was finally helped.  The other time was when I was there for coffee and dessert with friends, and we paid with a card.  The waiter told us, upon picking up the card, \"You know, if you can, you should really give me my tip in cash.  We don't see it on our paychecks for another 2 weeks otherwise.\"  Um...thanks for the advice on how we should tip you.  How about we don't tip you at all?

But those two experiences aside, nothing has been able to lessen my love of Monty's and all its glory."}
{"text":"I hate to admit this because I fear the stone throwing that will occur, but I'm just not a fan of Monty's food.  Madisonites love this diner and I certainly understand its charm.  Its interior is quaintly decorated with very much a 50s diner feel. There's a pie and cake display case up front.  They're always popular for brunch on the weekends.  Service is friendly and this is a great neighborhood spot. 

BUT, I've yet to have anything from Monty's that I like.  I've been there many many times, for brunch, for lunch, and for dinner, and each time, I've been disappointed in the food.  I really want to like this place, but I seem to be unable to find a dish on the menu that keeps me coming back.  

My most recent visit was with a friend from out of town.  I ordered their pozole which was an item I hadn't seen before on their menu and it sounded intriguing.  But when it came out, I was disappointed.  I found the chunks of pork a bit tough, the dish heavy on the hominy and the dish itself lacking in flavor.  It felt one noted.  It wasn't bad; it just wasn't for me.  I was really hoping that this would be the dish I'd be excited to come back to Monty's for but I came away disappointed. 

I ate less than half of my dish but I decided that the rest wasn't worth a takeout box.  Unfortunately, this is how I often feel about Monty's food."}
{"text":"The curry is amazing as well as the malts, pie and pretty  much everything else on the menu.  We live the atmosphere here too, reminds me of NYC style diners. Blue Plate is always busy, but you'll  always fi d a table. I highly recommend going  here any time of day. Great options and good service."}
{"text":"Tried this place based upon the Yelp reviews. My girlfriend & I had hamburgers. I also had a salad with the best 1000 island dressing I've ever had.  My girlfriend did not want onions and her burger came out with them. They quickly brought her a new one. We finished up with a huge Turtle sundae we shared. Caution: this sundae is not for only one person.

Our service was satisfactory and we arrived before the dinner rush (430pm), so seating was easy. At 6pm, the place had a significant queue, but it was a Saturday night and the Barrymore had an event. 

Overall, the fare, the cost and the atmosphere make this a must try."}
{"text":"Driving back from Wisconsin Dells to Illinois hungover and following a strict vegetarian diet, can be a little tricky. I hadn't been to Madison in a few years, so we decided to try a place in Madison (I also figured that they would be more likely  to have restaurants that cater to my needs). My boyfriend did some yelping, and shortly we were on our way to Monty's. There is a private lot which is always nice when you're in a busy city. We did not sit outside because it was a little chilly but the patio looked pleasant and relaxing with beautiful flowers. When you go inside the ambience is a funky little 50's diner with amazing looking pies. Even though the restaurant was crowded, we were able to get a table fairly quickly. As I opened up the menu, I almost died but before that I even thought of moving to Madison right away! There are so many vegetarian, vegan, gluten free options that it is the majority of the menu, which is so rare to find at a breakfast diner. We both ordered the sweet potato hash and it was to die for! Just what we needed that day! I wish there was another one in Illinois. My only suggestion is to serve the fruit on a separate plate instead of piling it all on one big plate, that makes the food messy and crowded."}
{"text":"We absolutely love this place!!!  We were in Madison Friday night for a show and breakfast is a must at Monty's...excellent service...superior food choices and amazing coffee!!!  Takes you back to the 50's and 60's with the decor!!!"}
{"text":"We've eaten at Monty's a number of times and have always had good food there.   Service has also been good to excellent.   The veggie quesadilla is quite good.   Their prices are a little higher than we would like.
Bathroom and restaurant is very clean. 
When we are in the mood for something vegetarian Monty's is a safe bet.
I wouldn't really say I'm a fan but they do enough right to get 4 stars."}
{"text":"The Sweet Potato Hash breakfast is FAAAABulous!!!! The ambiance is great with the sweet, retro diner feel. I've popped in late mornings, during the week, and have gotten right in, no wait, fast service!! I love the bottomless cup of Joe...it's fair restaurant java, but always hot and always rapidly refilled! This place is hoppin' come the weekend, so plan well and expect a bit of a wait...but it's worth it!!!"}
{"text":"I went to Monty's for brunch on a Saturday morning around 10:45am. Shockingly, there was not a long wait and the service was very quick and helpful. I loved the fun, 60's diner atmosphere, and the food was delicious. My brother had French toast, while I had the classic country breakfast. I highly recommend the biscuits; they are worth the calories! 
Even though it was brunch, we heard the pies were impeccable so we each tried a slice. We tried the chocolate malt and tin roof pies. Both were unbelievable! Do not leave without trying a slice of pie.
I have nothing but good things to say about this diner. I wish I lived in Madison so I could try their lunch and dinner menus (as well as try more pies, of course)!"}
{"text":"My partner and I came with two friends who were from out-of-town. I had heard really good things about Blue Plate, and I wanted to try it out, but I wish we had left when we saw there was a wait.

We ended up waiting for a table for around 45 minutes. While waiting I had to use the restroom--disgusting. There was no soap in the dispenser, water all over the counter and floor, and paper towels crumpled everywhere. I realize this is largely because of the patrons, but you would expect somebody from the staff to pop in every once in a while to make sure everything is neat and in stock. 

When we finally got a table, service was rushed and impersonal. I was a little dismayed that a manager never came over to at least thank us for waiting for so long, but who knows if a manager was even there? It seemed totally chaotic and like nobody was in charge. Lunch was okay, but nothing special. I had an omelette that was pretty good, but the breakfast potatoes that it came with were soggy, and while some of the potatoes were heavily seasoned, others didn't have any seasoning on them whatsoever and tasted horribly bland. I also had to wait several minutes before I could even eat because the server who delivered the plates (not our server, who spent approximately two minutes at our table in total) brought everyone else's meals out first and left mine in the kitchen. 

Will not be back."}
{"text":"A few weeks back my brother and his wife were in town.  They are from the northeast where local diners are the place to go for breakfast. Monty's definitely received thumbs up from both of them.

Their comment, and pet-peeve about breakfast, is they want it fresh made.  Breakfast food is too easy to be mass-produced and set aside for reheating.  Everything we ordered tasted fresh and it was all piping hot.

I ordered the corn-beef hash (from a recommendation from my son who frequents on Sat mornings) with an over medium egg: delicious.  The over medium was runny enough to wet the hash and it all went together so well.  
Our coffees and soda never suffered during the visit. 
Parking was easy (I parked on the street on a Sunday morning)
Wait time was minimal

I will be back!"}
{"text":"1st off, Breakfast all day 24/7. Who doesn't love that!
2nd, The pies selection is fantastic. I found out that they come from the Market Street bakery in Sun Prairie. Hats off to them!!!!! 
Burgers and dinner menu- Great home cooking! fresh well made food that gives mom's at home cooking a run for it's money! 
\"If you are hungry for a great filling meal, just head to Monty's\" is my new Motto. 

Love the huge parking lot! Easy in and out every time (if you can find a spot due to me being not the only other person loving this joint)
Wish they had later hours. They are only open to 10pm, which I'm kind of confused with considering they are directly across from the Barrymore theater. 
But...I still have a solid 5 stars for this new love of my life."}
{"text":"Visited this place on a rainy and relaxing weekend of typical Madison September. We had to wait 30 minutes to get seated so we just went out for a nice walk. When we came back, it was at the peak of lunch time and even though the place was crowded, it had a friendly and home-like atmosphere.

Food - the three of us all skipped breakfast on a Sunday so everyone wanted to get a breakfast dish, I had the blue plate special omelet, which came with bacon, mushroom, cheese, diced onions and green peppers, and even guacamole, accompanied with a biscuit and cooked potatoes. The serving size is great, I had to carry a third of it home. Everything tasted just like they should, with the guacamole/cheese melting in your mouth along with the soft texture of the egg, it was great.

Price - for the price we paid, I felt like this place is better than most other breakfast/lunch options in Madison. Definitely coming back one day to try out the other options (burgers for the most part) since I couldn't help but notice how delicious they looked when people around our table got them.

The only few inconvenient things about this place are: parking, if you come during brunch or lunch hours, don't expect to find a parking right away. They have a pretty small lot and the place tends to get very crowded. Also expect to wait up to half an hour before you can get seated...

They also don't accept American Express, which I find peculiar since most restaurants do."}
{"text":"I like Monty's! Great atmosphere, yummy desserts, and good burgers."}
{"text":"Monty's came onto my radar after reading an article that listed this Madison diner as home to the best milkshake in the state of Wisconsin (and the unofficial cocktail).  It made my Sunday brunch pickings pretty easy.

Some advice for fellow Monty's Brunch amateurs: 
(01) Come before 10:30 AM on a Sunday.  We were getting \"the eye\" by waiting customers by 11 AM.  This is a coveted spot for sure.
(02) Order breakfast \"appetizers\" to start aka a pecan roll and zucchini muffin.  Both tasted like home, which is the way baked goods should always taste.
(03) Include an order of potatoes with your main.  The seasoning makes them the best side.
(04) Don't fret about there not being options for your vegan friends.  There's an entire menu devoted to them.  In fact, four out of the five of us had either the vegan scramble or the zucchini pancakes.  Of the two, I would recommend the scramble.
(05) Decide on the salmon omelette if you want every bite to be a fishy bite.
(06) End your meal with a Fat Elvis milkshake aka the best in the state.  Vanilla ice cream blended with fresh banana, peanut butter, and chocolate sauce is the way to go, brunchy folks.

To sum it up, Monty's is a solid spot for Sunday brunch, and folks must save room for the Fat Elvis milkshake and a baked good or two!"}
{"text":"My meal was just okay. Had the Chilaquiles. Not what I was expecting. My sister loved her biscuit and veggie scramble. our waiter was awesome and attentive. Think I'd go back and try another dish! 3 Madison motorcycle cops were in there eating. If the cops go there, you know the food is good."}
{"text":"One of my favorite breakfast places in Madison.  The salmon hash is a dream.  And Tim bakes the best biscuits in town!"}
{"text":"Looking for a big, hearty breakfast? Then look no further because this place has got exactly what you're looking for (and for a pretty reasonable price). I went here with my friend after a night of *ahem* good old Madison weekend fun, and this was exactly what we needed. I got the eggs mornay, which has this sausage patty and poached eggs with this very nice sauce on top of an English muffin. And if that wasn't enough carbs for you, it comes with a generous helping of fried potatoes. Good stuff.

Also a random note: despite its appearance as an old fashioned diner, I got a very hipster-y vibe from it once I got in."}
{"text":"Monty's Blue Plate Diner is an overall good diner with a little bit of a hipster spin. They have good sandwiches and breakfast items you'd expect to see at a diner like burgers, montecristos, or french toast, but they also do a lot with vegetables to keep thing interesting like their sweet potato hash or the caponata and pesto omelet. They also feature a lot of classic dishes with international inspiration, and they bend over backwards to meet dietary restrictions. They have lots of pie and other desserts available, reminiscent of the late Bluephies (RIP). Throw in a full bar featuring boozy milkshakes, and you have a solid brunch spot if I've ever seen one.

I went with a salmon hash because i was in the mood for something different while still getting my hands one of their biscuits. I found the salmon scramble to have a tame amount of fishy salmon flavor that fits in well with the potatoes since they finely chop the potatoes and salmon into the same size. I was hoping for dill or some other herb, but I didn't notice any.

The biscuit was pretty nice. It's big, warm and pillowy with a relatively neutral flavor. I prefer a crusty, hard, and flaky biscuit, but this was nice and really satisfied my craving for a good biscuit.

Because of the gaudy display of desserts, I couldn't resist getting something sweet. I went with a sprinkle doughnut and a boozy mudslide milkshake. The doughnut was good enough; nothing amazing but not bad. The milkshake was pretty great. It's big and will probably give you a stomach ache from all that ice cream, but it's real good if you like tasting booze in your shake.

Overall, I didn't find Monty's to be a favorite, but I will probably be back for some boozy shakes at brunch."}
{"text":"The visit the bf and I made to Madison remains one of the epic tales of our relationship, maybe because Chicago annoys us so much.  Oh, Madison: the low sales tax.  The inexpensive street parking.  The street parking that becomes free at like 6pm.  The cool, liberal people, the delicious food everywhere.  I have a suspicion I've sighed over all of this in another yelp! review.  But I can't rave over this city enough.

Ah, the food.  A former professor of mine, who got her Ph.D. in Classics at UW, recommended this place for us.  Perfect, because we're a pair of frail little vegetarians who need to maintain a high level of soy (and ice cream and all other goodies) in our diet, and the Blue Plate Diner's menu does a great job of not only having veggie food, but food that was more interesting than 'grilled cheese' or 'house salad,' stuff that vegetarians are usually stuck with.

After getting lost as soon as we dumped our things in our B&B and getting into my car, we called this diner a few times, desperate for directions and food.  The girl who repeatedly answered the phone was very patient and very helpful.  I really appreciated it: driving in the dark in a new city isn't pleasant when you have no idea where you're going and you're starving and you have a hungry boy on your hands.

It's a typical diner, though it was surprisingly empty on a Friday night (though we were relieved to see it packed with hipsters when we drove by two days later), in that it had weird diner lighting and old-timey furniture and decor.  But the food!  I had a tofu scrambler and stole as much of my boyfriend's avocado-and-portobello sandwich as possible.  If I'd had room, I would have topped it off with a milkshake or something decadently diner-y like that.  Next time, next time.  Especially now that I'll know where I'm going the next time I'm in Madison."}
{"text":"I have been coming here since it was still Bob's Blue Plate dinner, which was almost thirty years ago now. The food is always great. 

For mains, they have old and new classics, and a good variety of things for omnivores, vegetarians, and vegans; so it's great if you have a group of people who are all on different diets. For desserts, everything is delicious and amazing. It can be hard, but save room for dessert if you can! It's worth it."}
{"text":"I've been to Monty's at least once for every meal. The omelettes are to die for, huge in quantity unique in ingredients- highly recommend the spinach and feta. The salads are the same thing, definitely large and delicious. Last night I went for dinner and got the meatless loaf, and now I want the recipe for the cashew gravy (if my memory serves me correctly, it was cashew...) to put on EVERYTHING. Amazing shakes and malts complete the perfect comfort/diner food experience."}
{"text":"Diner food for the younger generations. Everything is pretty yum, but I would just stay away from the salads. Salads at diners seem to always be a let down and Monty's is no exception. But seriously good stuff here. Pie and milkshakes mmmm"}
{"text":"We stopped in here for breakfast Saturday morning and were lucky enough to have no wait. Our service was great and the menu is has a lot of great options! I had the sweet potato frittata and it was excellent! TONS of food!! My finance had the salmon hash and I snuck a bite, and that was just as delish. It was a great start to our day."}
{"text":"THANK YOU, LAURA (freshman year resident cool girl) for introducing me to Monty's all those years ago. Back in the day, I went often enough to know the staff by name and to have pretty much sampled the whole menu. The consistency is crazy. For having such a big and varied (vegan, vegetarian and uhh... carnivorous?) menu, everything I have ever tried has been really incredible.

They have options for everyone, sweet and savory breakfasts, filling dinners, boozy shakes and tons of delicious cakes and cupcakes. I usually just go for a sandwich, sometimes the Artichoke sandwich, or Farmer John's. My absolute favorite from back in my vegetarian days is the Meatless Meatloaf of the Gods. I would usually ask them to make it into a sandwich and they would do so, no problem. I've heard incredible things about their regular meatloaf, but I can't stop ordering the meatless version to ever get the real deal. They also have incredible sides. The Three Bean Salad is sooo addictive, the Mashed Potatoes with Cashew Gravy (!!!) is really comforting and their Waffle Fries... I could probably just order a plate of those fries and call it a day. Other must tries include the Brandy Alexander shake, biscuits with jam and honey and the zucchini/potato pancakes. 

The diner itself is always impeccable, very bright and clean. Choose a seat at the bar to get a glimpse into the kitchen or sit at one of the comfortable 6-person booths. The servers here are amongst the best, just really friendly and funny. They all seem like people I'd spend time with IRL, charming and personable. 

I will keep returning to Monty's whenever I have an excuse to visit Madison. At this point, I may not even need an excuse, Monty's is its own excuse.

Also-- check in here to get a free endless cup of jo!"}
{"text":"Monty's Blue Plate Diner is my current breakfast based obsession in Madison. The atmosphere is delightful, food is well curated and prepared, and the prices are very affordable. Easily the most well rounded \"American roots\" style breakfast we've had around town so far.

We ended up at Monty's on a Saturday morning after the farmer's market because we didn't want to wait for a table at any of the downtown options. We walked in and immediately got a seat at the bar. If you're a Yelper make sure you check in to get a free bottomless coffee!

For a main course I ordered the sweet potato hash, which came with assorted fruit, a biscuit, and eggs cooked to your liking (scrambled with copious amounts of cheese please). The was cooked to perfection with just the right about of browning on it. The eggs were not wet or overcooked. The biscuit and fruit, well, you can't really mess that up. They were great too! The coffee was about what I expected from a diner. It wasn't Starbucks (don't you dare have that expectation, you Yelper-McSnooty face), but it got the job done.

Our service wasn't AMAZING, but it was acceptable. The diner was absolutely slammed at the time because it was brunch hour so I'll let it slide. I wasn't left waiting long enough that I was hangry, and my coffee was always topped off. As far as I'm concerned service gets a check-mark in satisfactory from me.

We enjoyed the meal so much that we returned Sunday morning for brunch with an out of town friend. The second meal I had almond milk French toast with cinnamon swirl bread. The toast was perfectly dipped and not soggy with the right level of crunch to it. Unfortunately, I was still quite hungry after this plate. The portion size seemed much smaller than that of the hash the day before.

I am looking forward to my return trips to Monty's for brunch, but we absolutely need to come back to try the pumpkin bourbon cocktail shake! Cheers!"}
{"text":"As far as greasy-spoons go, this place is pretty good. If you're looking for gut-busting amounts of food you should go elsewhere. However, the food is all made on the spot and of decent quality. Fun menu for the whole family and the aesthetic is great.  Verging retro with some Madison flair.

Worth a try but Mickey's, Original Pancake House and Lazy Jane's edge out this place, in my opinion."}
{"text":"This is a great restaurant to go to in a charming neighborhood. Gramma in town? Take her, she loves home cooking! Post Critical Mass carbo load? Wheel on in! Conservative couple on 
the third date and need to fuel up before doing it for the first time? Jackpot! As a bonus: With it's proximity to the storied Barrymore Theater, it is not uncommon to dine amongst musical geniusii. 
Diner-esque feel and fare with lots of visual distractions (you may need them for the inevitable wait) You will more than likely hear screams of ecstasy after someone has the pie. Comfort food for the masses (Yes, you too my veggie sucking pals!) 

Hmmmmmmm. Do you like the idea good-looking salt of the Earth houseboys? Well, whomever does the hiring at Monte's does too. I have not seen one unattractive employee yet. Besides being beautiful, they are efficient in their positions. The waitstaff is friendly and quick, cooks have yet to fail my taste buds, and the bakers make some of the yummiest cakes in the state. 

For maximum food coma-ry, I'd recommend the (fake)meatloaf w/cashew gravy, mashed potatoes, a mimosa chased with a piece of Fat Elvis cake. Remember you are in Wisconsin and you don't have to have any regard for caloric intakes any longer, and eat til you either pass out or essplode,no judgment. In fact the fake meatloaf/cashew gravy is so fabulous, that I have 
sent a mole into the kitchens of Monte's to snag the recipe. Yes, I am that powerful/desperate."}
{"text":"Tried this place out for the Food Fight Foodie Week and it's great diner food and gives you a good family-style feeling when you're there. Portions were super generous and filling! 

With 4, we family styled and tried a good selection:
Biscuits and gravy (standard, no complaints); Grilled Vegetable and Spinach Salad - very good and quite interesting as a hot salad, but I thought the lemon vinaigrette and grilled veggies made the dish quite oily; Meatloaf of the Gods and The Ultimate Mac and Cheese - can't go wrong with either, both yummy! 

Dessert was stellar with French silk pie, Mississippi Mud pie, Fat Elvis Shake, and Silver Dollar Pancakes (switched blueberries for chocolate chips)! If you must get one I recommend the Mississippi pie!

Parking is a little bit of a pain and service was friendly but should be weary to not give out plates so quickly for a 3-course meal and time it out."}
{"text":"We were able to sit outside, on a perfect night. The server was great and very attentive despite having to cover the 6 tables outside. But enough about that, let's get to the food! It was fantastic! I don't normally eat vegetarian dishes but I decided to to try the \"Meatless Meatloaf\". I am so glad it did. It was very flavorful and the sauce had a nice peautnutty taste. The mashed potatoes were rustic style with the skins and very creamy and a very generous serving of broccoli was on the plate as well. My mom had the curry and I tried that and it was super yummy with a nice kick at the end. We were full after our meal so we did not get to try the desserts/malts but everything looked amazing when it came to the other tables. If we lived near by we would be back and I will be suggesting to others that they go here! It is a must do in Madison!"}
{"text":"This place is cheap. Luckily, cheap does not mean crap here. I love the diner feel of this place - it makes me feel like I'm inside a Hopper painting. I had a giant plate of meatloaf, and it was not at all bad. Their sundaes are also enormous, so consider yourself warned. I will be going back for sure and will update this review as I explore more of their menu."}
{"text":"I could have sworn I wrote a review?

anyhoo...

went here on the suggestion of a few vegheads.  they used to have vegan milkshakes & ice cream... sadly, no more :(

dinner was tasty, though-- heathen vegan shoplifter sandwich & cherry pie!!! nothing Earth-shattering, but solid. 

and probably one of your vegan best options in Madison."}
{"text":"Abundant vegan options, even for breakfast!  Food is above average, service was great, prices really low.

The sweet potato hash with tofu scramble was especially good."}
{"text":"One of my Madison favorites.  Always something new to try.  Good staff, offbeat atmosphere, great service and food.  However I will note that not everyone I bring here has enjoyed their food... I think I talked it up too much."}
{"text":"We tried this place out for the first time on a Saturday in March. From the reviews I had read on here, I knew there would be a short wait. I think we waited about 20-30 minutes (which was a little longer than i was expecting). Unfortunately there was no good place to wait either.  We constantly felt we were standing in someone's way. The wait did give us a chance to admire their beautiful looking pies, which we did not have room to try after we had lunch. 
When it was our turn, someone called our names over a microphone and then told us  where to go sit. We found our seats and waited for the waiter. There were 3 menus at the table so we were able to start looking through what they had to offer. The waiter came and took our drink order but never brought us a fourth menu. He also never introduced himself. 
After looking over the entire menu the only thing that really jumped out at me was their milk shakes and ice creams. Nothing else really jumped out at me and made me think \"Oh wow that is really different and sounds really good?\". I think it is a good basic breakfast place to those who are vegetarians or gluten free! But for the rest of us it isn't anything spectacular. I had an omelette which was fine, though the biscuit that came with it was tasty. My friend had asked the waiter for a refill on his water which never came and my coffee never got refilled until we had finished eating after all the dishes and utensils were taken away so i couldn't stir my cream or sugar. 


To sum things up:
This place was just an average diner that didn't have a wow factor to anything.
Would be a good place for those seeking vegetarian/gluten free options and are just wanting  \"normal/ordinary\" breakfast/lunch options.

I would not venture back for a second time."}
{"text":"Its a great place.  Both me and my wife thought it had a great summer feel in the 50s.  What's nice about it is that it has a Madison vegetarian twist.  If we would've been hungrier the pies looked amazing but our bellies had reached their capacity.

Overall quality, its traditional american diner feel w/ a twist of Madison.  Great spot for a sit down lunch on a road trip."}
{"text":"I haven't been to Monty's for a while, but when I am there, I typically have my regular standbys that I enjoy - their burgers, their waffle fries (with a side of ranch, of course), their chocolate shake, and their breakfasts (served ALL day).

However, last night I was all about trying new things. Standbys be damned! So I ordered the Meatloaf Stacker sandwich (open face) with the gravy on the side (I'm not a big gravy fan) with their always fabulous waffle fries and an Oreo shake instead of Chocolate. Here's how it went down:

~ Sandwich: The meatloaf was good - fairly moist with a nice full flavor profile (wise addition of sausage). The mashed potatoes were dry and needed seasoning so I pulled those off and skipped them altogether. The sprinkling of fried onions on top was brilliant both flavor & texture-wise.

~ Waffle fries:  SO GOOD - ALWAYS!!!!!! Enough said.

~ Oreo shake:  It was delicious with lots of real Oreos. And I love that they give you the extra shake in that metal blending cup - so old school, so classy. I only wish they made their shakes just a bot thicker so it didn't get liquidy so quickly. Side note: if I had it to do over again, I would have gotten the chocolate shake instead as it's not quite as sweet at the Oreo, but hindsight.......

I want to end with acknowledging how much I appreciate the great customer service at Monty's.  I've enjoyed our servers each time I've been there. Last night was no different. Peach was our server and she was wonderful - attentive & fun & complimentary (she liked my purple glasses) and she totally lived up to her name.....she was a real peach. ;o)"}
{"text":"Awesome! Awesome! Awesome! The only problem is that they were overfilled and we had to sit outside. We ordered takeout and ate it outside. The guy at the front, kind of served us like we ordered inside. My wife LOVED the meatloaf and the grilled cheese for my children looked outstanding. I had the Cobb Salad and it was good. I would have liked more dressing, but no complaints. I love this place and will return for breakfast in a few weeks, which is better than awesome."}
{"text":"Great cocktails and beers on tap and good diner breakfast options. Meat eggs veg and other options widely available."}
{"text":"Every time I go there it's just so mediocre. I don't know what anyone likes about this place. There's just nothing good about it, other than its food and it will keep you from starving. That's not what I want to pay for."}
{"text":"The service is excellent, the atmosphere a time capsule of a 50s diner & the food is some of the best diner fair I've ever had. 

The Meatloaf is called the \"Meatloaf of the Gods,\" and it truly is. I don't even like Meatloaf and I literally savored each bite of this culinary masterpiece. It is extremely filling because it is made with nutrient rich local meat, savory vegetables & topped with the best gravy I've ever tasted. Yum!  For $10, how can't it be \"As good as it gets?\"

If you like pie, also make sure to get a slice. It is delicious!"}
{"text":"I was disappointed with my experience, but I'm willing to give it another shot.

The main problem was our waiter. We had very slow service. We were seated outside and had to go in to ask for our menus. I ordered coffee and half-and-half, but I didn't get a spoon or something to stir it with, which I thought was odd. I just kind of swished it around... It was weird.

Our waiter failed to tell us the scrambler special and when we asked he told us it was artichoke, tomato and asiago. However, when it arrived the artichokes were not there. It was very disappointing. The breakfast potatoes were also a real let down. I love potatoes and they failed. However, the biscuit was delicious. 

We also ordered pie. Two of our party ordered the Fat Elvis - which does not come in a pie-form - so they were upset. Their other waiter must have made that mistake. I went for the key lime pie which was delicious. The Fat Elvis was replaced with a drumstick (?) which I guess was good, but I don't like peanut butter. 

Another thing is if you sit outside, they will give you plastic silverware. I didn't mind, but others in my party did. Also, they only take Visa and Mastercard. 

Overall, the food was good, but the service was not. Andrew K attempted to show off his humor (\"Elvis has left the building\"), but we found it rather obnoxious because we were sick of waiting. I'll give him some slack because there were a lot of people seated outside, but I feel he could have paid a bit more attention."}
{"text":"To prepare for this amazing meal, I made sure I took 2 Lactaid pills and ordered dairy-delicious, dairy-packed meals. I was well prepared and so so satisfied.

We arrived as a group of 8 on a Sunday morning. Though we had to wait a long time, the wait was pleasant because we were able to sit outside, and the hostess announced tables through a loud speaker. As soon as we sat down, we were immediately greeted and served drinks. Very fast, very reliable service.

I ordered the sweet potato hash with the bloody mary, and I shared my boyfriend's meal of the breakfast burrito and Porter shake. Porter shake: gigantic and amazing. They served the shake in a glass with whatever was leftover (including leftover porter) separately. So there was so much shake and then some to share. My bloody mary was spicy and savory, and delicious, but also a standard tasting bloody mary. Sweet potato hash: amazing. I will be coming back for this plate. Only complaint: I wish they served me the side of potatoes or bacon instead of fruit. Such a heavy meal deserves a heavy side (at least, that's what I believe).

Everyone's order arrived on time and amazingly made. No complaints, and absolute happiness and satisfaction all around. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"What can I say? Tempeh tempeh tempeh, tempeh and eggs, tempeh and French toast, tempeh lettuce and tomato, tempeh is amazeballs. Beyond that this my fav for food fight, been coming here for several decades. I love it.

Here's another one:
Tempeh in the morning,
Tempeh in the evening,
Tempeh at supper time,
When you eat at Monty's
You can have Tempeh anytime!"}
{"text":"Favorite late night pie fix. Anytime of the day breakfast option. For me it's a toss up between the Blue Plate Burger and Chicken in a pie, but lots of vegetarian option if that's what you NEED! Love the wait staff."}
{"text":"We went here because we have several vegetarians in the family, so there is something for everyone as they have very carnivorous meals as well. Be prepared for a long wait, often 30+ minutes.  The good news is they give you coffee while you wait.

Service is exceptionally wonderful: friendly and attentive.  I had the special of the day which was biscuits and gravy with a couple of eggs (see photo below).  The eggs were perfectly cooked, the potatoes were flavorful and the gravy was thick and savory.  The biscuits were just OK, I thought they could have been bigger and flakier.  My food also came out about 5 minutes after everyone else which was a little uncomfortable.

Everyone else thought their meal was excellent, especially the pie we had for brunch dessert!

Great place if you are OK with crowds and a wait."}
{"text":"The \"ultimate mac & cheese\" really is the ultimate. I don't know how to make mac & cheese with caramelized onions in it yet, but I will learn, dammit, because I have seen the LIGHT. The accompanying grilled garlic bread was alright, but a little chewy for my taste - I'm more of a Texas-toast-crusty-garlic-bread kinda girl.

Also, be SURE you get something sweet. It might feel weird to order a donut or a shake with a savory lunch or dinner meal, but you can't leave without it. Just trust."}
{"text":"I had something to celebrate and hadn't been able to eat meat since watching a food documentary a few weeks prior, so Monty's seemed like the appropriate celebratory location.  I ordered their special: teriyaki tofu with peas, coconut, peppers and peanuts, served with a side of fresh pita.  The description was a little clunky--there were other ingredients in the dish description that I've since forgotten--and I got a kick out of listening to the waitress explain it to other patrons.  During a short wait, I sipped a heavenly hot chocolate.  My husband isn't a hot chocolate fan but agreed that it was really, really good.  FYI: they'll make it with soy milk if you ask.  After the food arrived it took me two seconds to realize that the tofu was the best I'd ever tasted.  Tender, flavorful, caramelized on the outside.  The sauce was a little saltier than I prefer, but still quite good.  The pita had good texture and a nice, buttery taste.  My husband enjoyed the traditional-type burger he ordered.  Our only disappointment is that we didn't save room for dessert.

Other observations:
-Going early helped avoid parking lot anxiety--they get Busy here.
-Our red-haired waitress was friendly, intelligent, and overall awesome.  Noting that I had ordered soy milk hot chocolate, she advised that the teriyaki tofu meal is prepared with a small amount of dairy.
-Staff brought water to a puppy who was sitting outside with his humans."}
{"text":"Got a burger, fries, and a shake. Stay away from the burgers. They're springy and dense and remind me of rubber. Tasteless, also. The fries were delicious! The shake was amazing. So if that's all you want, then you're in good shape! They had a nice variety of pies but I was too stuffed to get any."}
{"text":"This place is always excellent.    I've never left unhappy.    Even amongst so many good offerings in Madison, this diner stands out.   Plan your arrival carefully though, as there is often a long wait for tables."}
{"text":"This place has the best atmosphere and freshest food I have ever had!!! Please mark this spot on you \"to do list\" -the staff is super friendly and the food makes us think we are at grandmas house! I got the Zucchini potato pancakes (an awesome breakfast idea) and she got the blue plate omelet -fantastic!!
Be sure to say hello to Sarah ! she rocks! She Has the best personality that we have come across yet!! 
Much love -E&A
WE WILL BE BACK!"}
{"text":"Service was great and I like the atmosphere but I wouldn't say it's anything special (except for the the shakes and meatloaf - fit for the gods for sure!)."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing... 100% real food, and a menu that can fit almost any dietary need! My partner had the meatloaf (with luscious broccoli--- try saying that in the same sentence), superb homemade gravy, and real mashed potatoes with the skins on them... I had the Cobb salad, and if you are a foodie, you know that Cobb salad is a dangerous thing to put on a menu--- it is difficult to execute properly, and this was perfect. We will be back, again, and again, and again... wish we had found this years ago!"}
{"text":"Impressive diner menu! Having a handful of quality Wisconsin beers on hand is always nice. Everything our server suggested was a great dish, especially the avocado BLT & the meatloaf. Although, the grilled cheese was like none I'm ever had. I think it had like 4-5 cheeses."}
{"text":"Blue plate omelette was delish, with avocado, pan fried potatoes and homemade biscuits. We also had the almond milk French toast. To top it off, local coffee, ground fresh with each pot! Must stop again."}
{"text":"Had the corned beef and sweet potato hash which were delicious! The coffee was great as well ;-)"}
{"text":"Monty's is getting two stars, because meh...

I've been here 4-6 times, because people like it so much and I go for social reasons, but every time, meh...

I've tried something new every time, but I have yet to find something that is worth the calories.
It's all fine, but not special at all. 

The best thing I can say is, if you are hungry and you need food, this place has food.

May be I'm ordering the wrong thing, but with 4+ tries under my belt, I think me and Monty are just not a good match.

What I've tried:
WISCONSIN SALMON HASH
BREAKFAST BURRITO
CORNED BEEF HASH
MONTY'S CRISTO- will give that this was decent, but very greasy
MEATLESS LOAF OF THE GODS
+ maybe 1-2 more things that I can't even remember"}
{"text":"best breakfast place in Madison.  I've been many many many times and it's delivered every single time.  Montys breakfast sandwich with the goat cheeseeeee mmmm so good.  And the biscuits and gravy... I could drink that gravy by itself and it would be satisfied.  Bravo."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh. This is the best place in Madison. I'm from out of town and I got excited when my friend told me about it. 

I'm a breakfast gal and they serve breakfast ALL DAY here! I was so happy! 

I got the Saturday Special. Biscuits and Fire-Roasted pepper gravy with two eggs over medium, a side of bacon and potatoes. 

Amazing. Every bite was mouth watering. See pictures. My friends and I split a banana cream pie and it was also sooooo good. Every bite. I wish I got my own slice. Haha. 

I wanted to try everything on the menu. Vegan friendly. Kid friendly. Milk shakes. Breakfast, great music. Outdoor seating. Countertop. What more could you ask for with this diner? 

Service was also EXCELLENT. 

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!  Come in the morning, Donovan is the best server ever.  The pancakes are great.  The corned beef hash is even better.  I've also had the sweet potato hash, donuts, French toast and they were all great."}
{"text":"My server wasn't good.  The coffee wasn't the best.  My fresh toast wasn't even cooked all the way. The eggs that they dipped the bread in to make it French toast was still runny!!!! I couldn't even eat it so I asked for a fruit platter but my waitress wasn't even paying attention to the table so I had to ask someone else who was just a bus boy.  She brought it out and then brought out the dip ten minutes later saying it was the cooks first day..... what ?!"}
{"text":"There's nothing I can add to the reviews here other than to say this is truly a five star diner.  

5 star exterior, 5 star interior, 5 star clean bathrooms
5 star cheery cool and efficient people who work there
5 star artichoke salad with a 5 star \"side\" bean salad that you could take home and have for lunch the next day: it's BIG!

5 star shakes and burgers and other old school diner food in addition to all the 5 star new wave veggie & organic options

Next time I'm in Madison I'd like to try it for breakfast."}
{"text":"good diner food with lot's of tasty vegetarian options and with pie or cheesecake for dessert..."}
{"text":"Best. Place. EVEEER. 
been going there for years and never had a single bad experience. everytime I go there i have higher expectations and they are always met. People here go out of their way to make sure that you like your food, waiters know evrything that goes on a sandwich down to the ingredients of the dressing. Best of all the prices are very reasonable and the atmosphere is so Willy-like. 
do yourself a favor and try the veggie sandwich, your life will never be the same again! I pretend not to like meatloaf but if someone I'm with orders it, I make sure they don't have any leftovers. that's how good this place is..."}
{"text":"The building is amazing and the chow is better. Big portions of made with pride breakfasts. Beware! A slice of carrot cake serves two or more."}
{"text":"I love this place! The atmosphere, the food, and the staff are all great!! I highly suggest trying their breakfast - they serve it all day (: They also have incredible pies and other various bakery items!"}
{"text":"While I still contend that most places in Madison with diner in the title are not, in fact, diners, I will say that Monty's is a delicious retro-themed restaurant. I tend to order the same thing (turkey club) because it's got real meat and I'm a sucker for a good sandwich. My dinner mate got the biscuits and gravy special and it had a definite twist on it that made the gravy reddish with a zip. 

I always want to order dessert when I come in, but am always too full. My last trip was on Pi Day, and while I picked Monty's specifically because I wanted pie, I was disappointed that on my one trip with dessert as a priority they were completely sold out. Better for my health, certainly, but a disappointment nonetheless - why do you have to look so delicious, dessert case?! I guess I'll just have to head back again and maybe start dessert first."}
{"text":"Sweet potato hash is fantastic!  The tofu scramble has a bit of a spicy kick and is a great option for vegans.  In fact, their veg dishes are just plain good. Service is very friendly and their cheesecake is very creamy and delicious."}
{"text":"Wonderful.  I am a vegiterian with meat eating and vegan friends.  They have menus for everyone.  They even have vegan brownies. Everyone loved their meals. Staff is friendly and attentive"}
{"text":"I wanted to really like this place. The esthetic was vary chill and retro. The guy at front of house was plenty friendly, but things went downhill from there. I can understand, just getting out of a lunch rush, that a server might be tired, but ours wasn't super personable at all. Don't get me wrong, she attended to the table, but you could tell her mind was elsewhere. What really went wrong was when I ordered the vegan sweet potato hash. It looked awesome and tasted pretty good, until I tasted ham. I stopped chewing and in napkin was a chunk of ham as well as another chunk hidden further in the hash. I told the serve and showed her the pieces. I told her that I didn't really want anything in replacement because it had spiked some disordered fears for me. She took the plate away but offered no real apology for the mistake. I'm glad that she didn't charge me for my meal... However she still charged me for my coffee.... I know shit happens... But it sucks when your out from Oregon and you can't even get a decent vegetarian meal without having to worry."}
{"text":"I didn't particularly care for the food, but I loved the length of the vegan menu and I can't wait to come back and try the rest of it, even if it is just to be disappointed.

We waited for about a half hour and were seated likely as the last Friday rush made its way out. I had the sweet potato hash. I couldn't taste much besides the sweet potato, and even that was masked by the heavy spices added to the top. I wouldn't order it unless you're really into hash. The apple pie à la mode was solid (as in yummy, but also as in not runny). Prices were good, service was attentive. Remember to check in with Yelp to get a free coffee!"}
{"text":"Came here with the gf after a crappy brewery tour. Great good. Got a mushroom n swiss burger that was very tasty. Love these diner type places. Not sure I'll be back as I live in MKE but if I'm ever in the area and have a craving, I'll be sure to stop back."}
{"text":"Been here many times with the wife and kids. Always great service and food.  My kids especially like the special cookies.  A great place for any meal."}
{"text":"Great breakfast.  Outdoor seating in the summer is very nice. They have good pie too!  Though it's a diner, the food is more than greasy spoon."}
{"text":"A late night dessert run with my pregnant bestie led to a Monty's revelation:
They now serve (organic, classy) Sassy Cow ice cream, have even nicer and more delectable cheesecakes and their brownie sundae puts the Ella's Sparkled Kazoo to shame. 

Post-brownie sundae, bestie's baby to-be kicked. 

I think it was the hot fudge."}
{"text":"I love Monty's. The atmosphere is kitschy and cool, and they have something for everyone (even the vegetarians and picky eaters).

The wait can be a little on the excessive side, so don't hold off until you're hungry. 

I never manage to save room for dessert, but I hear the pies are excellent."}
{"text":"Why people like this place is beyond me. My food was flavorless and was clearly not cooked with care. I got the impression that there are some serious issues in the kitchen."}
{"text":"This is one of my least favorite Food Fight locations-- ok, except for Cooper's, which I really hate-- although I think that might have something to do with the fact that I've never had breakfast here. The breakfasts that I've seen coming out look really tasty. 

+ A very nice space with classic diner fixtures. 
+ Like all FF joints, the management and service is really a notch above. Extremely friendly and accommodating. 
- No appetizers. I guess they want to turn tables?
- A grilled cheese with olive tapenade just didn't work. Too much cheese (something I thought I'd never say!), too much grease, and a flavor combination that missed the mark. 
- Mediocre burger. Nice size. Nice condiments. Bland, overcooked burgers. I've complained about FF's refusal to cook burgers to order before and I received a very reasonable response, but it doesn't change the fact that the burgers come out dry. I should probably stop ordering them.
- To my mind a diner should be open 24/7."}
{"text":"Do you have a place that you think about and you immediately need to go there because it's so good? Your stand-by. A place so good you try to mimic the recipes at home? Monty's Blue Plate Diner is that place for me. Great freshly-made food at very reasonable prices served in a unique former gas station by people who are always in a good mood. That's this place. And everybody will be happy - meat-eaters and vegetarians alike. The selections for vegetarians is just as diverse and large as the non-veg menu. My favorite is the Meatless Loaf of the Gods. Composed of shredded carrots and mushrooms (And I loathe ... no ... hate mushrooms, but not in this recipe surprisingly. Although I do pick out many.) covered in a wonderful cashew gravy with a side of skins-on mashed potatoes and steamed seasonal vegetables. So incredibly good AND so incredibly good for you! That's Monty's Blue Plate Diner - So incredibly good AND so incredibly good for you!"}
{"text":"The best burgers - shakes - meatloaf.  Can't stop in Madison without going to the blue plate Diner"}
{"text":"Love this place for a reasonably priced and delicious brunch!  If you're coming on a weekend, be prepared to wait a little-but don't let that dissuade you, because the food is delicious.  I personally loved the variety of vegetarian options as well as the use of local ingredients in the dishes.  The variety on this menu is also insane-there's everything from the house version of Eggs Benny to Indonesian curry.  I got the Vegetarian Hash with poached eggs, and I added avocado for only $1, a steal for a brunch place.  Loved the spiciness of the hash, which also had pieces of marinated Tempeh-so good!  The eggs were poached perfectly and the homemade biscuit that came on the side was buttery, flaky, and delicious.  Make sure to hit Monty's when you want a delicious, hearty brunch!"}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING!!
I've had the falafel wrap, Monty's Blue Plate Burger with the walnut burger and tempeh bacon and both were fabulous!!!  I had to narrow my options down to my top 6 choices before ordering... I will go back many more times so I can try everything I want to order!!
And oh my gosh the pies!!  Fat Elvis (banana cake, peanut butter frosting filling and chocolate frosting) and Drumstick (Peanut butter silk pie with a fudge layer in the bottom) were both delicious!  
The staff is also very nice, helpful and passionate."}
{"text":"Awesome breakfast!!! Had the \"something or other scramble\" and it was amazing, kinda like an omelette that is scrambled but with more cheese!  Breakfast also comes with a super fluffy, light biscuit and some sliced, browned potatoes. Delicious, absolutely delicious. Plus the waiter took pity on us being so hungover and gave me some aspirin, so he automatically ranks high in my book.
The cupcakes are a must have as well. I tried the Fat Elvis and was amazed; banana cake stuffed full of peanut butter and frosted with plenty of chocolate! Now i see why everyone loves the bakery here."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I love this place. We had a great experience on a nice fall morning. The patio was still open and the service was amazing. Meghan got the Monty's breakfast sandwich and it was unreal. The goat cheese made it. I had the Almond Milk French toast. It was cooked perfectly and came with Amish made maple syrup. Our server Chloe was one of the best servers I've had anywhere. She was funny and very prompt. This is a must stop for anyone. We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Ok, nothing special. Service is great and people are very friendly. I would recommend market street dinner instead."}
{"text":"After \"misunderstanding\" communication, I got a call / message from the manager who DID took care of the issue I had. Better later than never. 
I WILL give it a try and update my review"}
{"text":"50's diner feel with a surprisingly modern menu. Great for a \"late dinner\". Never had a bad meal here."}
{"text":"Well, there are times when you have to take one for \"the team\".   It was one of those twelve hour days when after not eating much, I was ready for some comfort food and a little decompression.  MPBD was a logical choice, and visions of possible options began to seem viable.  After some deliberation, the meatloaf was a logical choice.  The staff seemed somewhat distracted and non-attentive.  I looked at my watch and noticed that there was just fifteen minutes left before closing.  The dish arrived, and after a few bites, I realized that this order had been \"nuked\" for a minute maximum.  I determined this because of the difference in temperature between the meat and the extremity of the vegetable.  After about five minutes waiting for a server, the food was returned for \"re-nuking\".  Sadly, the dish was still in a tepid temperate range, but I was so hungry that it didn't matter.  The moral-if it's the end of the day (meaning their scheduled hours of operation), stay away."}
{"text":"We enjoyed lunch here on a trip to Madison and liked the decor and atmosphere. When I tried to find it again on Yelp and couldn't remember the restaurant name, I searched for Restaurants in Madison WI and added filters \"American\" and \"Good for Lunch\" -  but it didn't appear. Only found it after my daughter remembered the name of restaurant. It's surprising this restaurant, which has lots of good reviews, is so hard to find on Yelp."}
{"text":"Monty's offers many vegetarian options. For example, they offer the Reuben sandwich for meat eaters and the Sheldon for vegetarians. I am consistently disappointed when I visit Monty's. On the last visit, I my fries were cold and my glass was dirty and cracked. A companion ordered a plain cheeseburger and it was loaded with onions. The carrot cake was obviously old--the cake was dried and the frosting was crusty. Another companion got the German chocolate cake which was also dry. It's a cool place, but needs better food."}
{"text":"Such a great variety of food for those who are have allergies or other dietary restrictions. Although we had a bit of a wait, everyone in our group had a substantial number of meals to pick, and enjoyed what they decided to get. Plus, the wait staff keep the coffee coming! Cannot wait to return."}
{"text":"If I could give this place 10 stars I would. I've been coming here since opened and it is consistently the best. Breakfast all day, more than just burgers and fries, deserts, beer selection....I can't rave enough.

The meatloaf of the Gods is to die for and their Just Coffee roast (their own blend) is so amazingly good I have my mom buy it and send it up to me in Minneapolis. It's that good.

Some of the people that work there have been there since I was a kid. Its a neighborhood place where you're bound to run into people you know and I make a point to go there at least twice while I'm home to visit.

Yay Monty's!"}
{"text":"Monty's is one of my favorite go-to restaurants, and not just because it's right in my neighborhood.

They're great for brunch, lunch, dinner, dessert, breakfast for dinner, and those times you just NEED a malt. I almost always sit at the counter, which is first-come-first-served, but even on the weekends, they get a crowd seated pretty fast. Service is usually great, and I think I've only had one not-good server in many, many visits. I also think the prices are really good for the quality and portions.

A few favorites: 
-either weekend special: I love the biscuits and red pepper, sausage gravy, and my husband almost always gets the steak with onion strings and compound butter.
-the meatloaf is super tasty, as are the potatoes and gravy on the side.
-the Florentine is my usual, especially if I don't want something too heavy
-the Sheldon, a veggie Ruben is delicious, even if you eat meat
-I am obsessed with their waffle fries--well worth the upgrade--though their regular fries are also great.
-their coffee is really good"}
{"text":"Still great. Thanks to Yelp and Monty's for the free check-in coffee. Service good despite the full house. Our server forgot a glass of milk, felt terrible amd immediately comped it. GREAT service.  We'll be back."}
{"text":"Great place, I visited there this weekend and the service was blazing fast. I had the goat cheese chicken sandwich and it was excellent!"}
{"text":"Yummy sweet potato hash, yummy eggs. Biscuits are decent! Boyfriend was happy with his meal as well (simple eggs, bacon, potatoes, etc.) Service was quick and friendly."}
{"text":"Love this place! My favorite? Bloody Mary of course! I'd say it's the best Bloody Mary in town. Food is always delicious. Staff is always friendly and helpful. In three years of going to Monty's Blue Plate Diner we never had a negative experience."}
{"text":"We have been looking for a new breakfast go-to spot since Bluephies closed and I think we found it! The food was amazing, as were the drinks, our waiter, and atmosphere! The only downfall was that  the poached eggs in my eggs moray were not runny but they were still phenomenal. The Bloody Mary was the best I have had in a long time! We will certainly be back soon!"}
{"text":"Been here twice for breakfast.  Both times my husband and I have gotten blueberry pancakes and a poached egg dish with mornay sauce.  The pancakes are incredibly fluffy and flavorful.  The original Eggs Mornay was delicious.  The eggs were runny, ham salty, English muffins slightly toasted, and mornay sauce was decadent.  On our 2nd visit I ordered the Mediterranean Sunrise, with which I was disappointed.  The flavor of the olives and capers were a bit overpowering (which is probably just the nature of the dish) but the eggs were overcooked.  Other tasty dishes we or our dining companions had and enjoyed include the Ham and Cheese Omelette (soooo cheesy), Country Breakfast, and Fruit Plate (with fresh fruit... and we know fresh, coming from California).  Service was slow but the food was great.  We can't wait to go there again (I'd vote 4 1/2 stars rather than 4 if I could)"}
{"text":"Customer service....AMAZING. 
I can't stress how great the customer service was. 
I came here with a group of about 7-8 people for breakfast, and for some reason some of the cousins I came with decided to be a bit picky from the beginning, and our server was so good at dealing with it! 
The restaurant is pretty spacious inside, and they also have outdoor seating. We didn't have a wait or anything.
There were a lot of options on the menu, which brings me to another great thing about this place, they had vegan food, that was so tasty! Two of my cousins are vegan, so it was great that we found this place.
For starters we had the donuts, which are freshly made daily, SO GOOD! We had the ones with sprinkles! 
We all tried to get different things so we can try each others food. I tried the banana walnut pancakes, so so great, probably one of my favorite entrees. I also tried the omelette, we substituted bacon for chicken, and it turned out so good. My least favorite was the burrito, I wasn't too crazy about it, but it was still decent! My all around favorite items for this place were the breakfast potatoes and biscuits, wow. I normally don't get potatoes during brunch because I really don't like them that much, but these potatoes are seasoned so well, we all couldn't stop talking about them! Another item we really liked were the biscuits, I had 2 biscuits with butter and jelly, and I am not ashamed! 
If I ever come to Madison again, I'm paying this place a visit. Amazing service and food!"}
{"text":"My friend and I go out for brunch st least once a month, and we used to eat here about as often as I could convince her to make the extra drive. We stopped by recently and I was a little shocked at how the mighty have fallen. There's almost always a wait, which I expected, but what I didn't expect was standing in front of the person at the register, waiting an awkward few minutes to be acknowledged. A table clear, seated quickly, friendly waitstaff, prompt coffee. Except we had to grab her and ask for normal cream as all that was left was flavored coffee mate. Whoops--we missed the fact that there was no silverware to stir the coffee. Had to ask for that too. Well, maybe my old fav breakfast would save it. Alas, no. 

Biscuit rubbery, not flaky, sweet potato hash unbelievably over spiced, fruit side had browning pineapple and turning melon. Ugh. But the scrambled eggs were perfectly done, although I had to add pepper and salt, weird considering the hash. 

For the first time ever, I didn't bother taking leftovers home. I don't think I'll be back anytime soon, not with so many other great neighborhood options."}
{"text":"Everything I have ever tried here is delicious! The cupcakes are to die for!"}
{"text":"Came here on the recommendation of a friend. We showed up roughly around 11am. The place was packed (it's a sunday, after a badger game, I get it). We put our name in with the hostess who stated it would be 20 minutes. 45 minutes later, we were seated. I get it, you can't make people leave...but over estimate the wait time. 20 mintes, I can hang out, I can look at a menu, I can make small talk with strangers. 45 minutes? I can leave and get a cup of coffee in someplace else and then come back for breakfast. 

There was no apology, just a shout and a point to our table. Again, I get it, not a 5 star experience. Our server was prompt, coffee was good and he was generous with refilling our beverages. Menu selection looked good. We ordered and our food came out very quickly, which after waiting so long was nice. I had the Blue Plate Special omlete.  Decent. Nothing over the top, but very good; avacados were a little sparse, but hey, it's November and that shit is expensive.  We also ordered a short stack to share. I went to pour the maple syrup...and immediately my fingers stuck to the handle of the syrup carafe.  Gross. The potatoes that came with the meal seemed very (very) seasoned. I didn't try them. They just looked too salty and underdone. But no harm no foul, I will just know not to order them again.

All in all, I would come here again. Probably not on a weekend though. The bakery items looked delish, so that's a definite possibility."}
{"text":"I'd been here years ago, and it hasn't changed. Diner food, with a healthy twist. 

The building is cool, but we sat outside. Service was great for our large group at a busy time. Baby-friendly, which is always nice. I had a GBLT, a very good BLT with guacamole. Good bun, good bacon, fresh veggies. Sided with a very good coleslaw.

Sweetie had a Cobb salad, which she really liked. We would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Fun authentic 50's dining atmosphere, kid friendly, delicious eggs, brunch options, Mexican options, Greek options, vegan options, great service, mimosas....you could literally take anyone here and they'd be blown away.  If you're looking to make everyone happy (even the fussiest of eaters) while still satisfying your own Non-conventional brunch palate, Monty's blue place will certainly not disappoint.  When I first sought out monty's, I was vegan.  I loved the tongue scramble.  Years later, I am a big egg lover, and the eggs monay, wow.  You can't go wrong.  Also, if you're thinking about ordering the chilaquiles,  DO IT."}
{"text":"Last time I was there we had a table for four people. We ordered: one Reuben, one Sheldon (Reuben's vegetarian cousin) as is, two vegan Sheldons. What can I say, my friends and I like kraut. 

But yeah. The Sheldon can be made vegan, and even without cheese (gasp) it's really delicious. Someone else mentioned that it was dry, but I order this almost every time and am never disappointed. 

The fries are awesome. Good (but expensive) Bloody Marys. They have vegan pie slices and can make VEGAN MILKSHAKES. 

:)"}
{"text":"Good solid diner. Great selection of pies and desserts. Can sometimes be really busy which turns into a long wait for both a table and service. But the food is worth a little patience."}
{"text":"Great local diner, that features lost of creative dishes-like zucchini pancakes.  Awesome bakery and great, home cooking.  While i'm prone to go with breakfast items, the lunch offerings have also always been good.  I don't think you can really go wrong here.  Decor screams old-time diner, maybe even at the expense of feeling a little bit forced.  All the same, this place should be a regular stop for anybody in madison."}
{"text":"I liked the 1950s-diner ambience of this joint. It was crowded and bustling when we went, though we didn't have to wait for a table, unlike people in larger groups. It seems to be a popular weekend brunch spot.

The service was friendly and prompt and our waiter picked up that I was vegan (without me telling him) and helpfully told us that some things (such as the rolls) weren't dairy-free. He substituted toast and English muffins for us.

I found my vegan tofu scramble with potato hash to be decent, but nothing spectacular. My friend thought the same of his \"Sloppy Faux\" sandwich which came with waffle fries. The prices are reasonable at around $7-10 a dish and the portion sizes are good. They do offer at least eight or nine vegan-friendly dishes from scrambles to burgers to meatloaf.

Madison needs a place like this which offers vegan brunch foods so I appreciate Blue Plate is around. The vibe is good and they have parking. But the quality of the food could stand to improve a bit."}
{"text":"Always around a 15-30 min wait to get in on the weekends, but always worth it. Usually great service by the wait staff, food is always prepared well, and prices are reasonable. Salmon hash is delicious. French toast comes in large quantities and is made with thick and fluffy bread. Breakfast burrito could be bigger, but it's tasty."}
{"text":"My impression of Monty's is very conflicting. On one hand, I want to say Monty's is an awesome place with great food. On the other hand I want to say Monty's is overrated. 

Let me explain. 

I love Monty's because of the options. If you are a vegetarian or vegan you aren't confined to the world of salads. There are many delicious and satisfying options. If you don't restrict your diet in any way, there are many great meaty and chalorically rich options for you too. Watching carbs? Get a sandwich in a wrap. Looking for a healthy lean meat option? Choose one of the several good chicken dishes. 

I personally steer towards the lean meat or veggie dishes and have never been disappointed. It's really hard to find a restaurant that caters to my needs as well as my boyfriend's nonrestrictive diet needs. This place does it well and at a pretty decent price. 

Though, I don't personally think Monty's is overrated, I feel that the point needs to be made. Whatever you order will be fresh and pretty tasty. However, say you order The Meatloaf of the Gods, it may not be what you expect if you are the type of person that is looking for traditional 'the-way-mom-made-it' meatloaf slathered with ketchup. If you are looking for an extensive breakfast menu consisting of traditional American breakfast combos (i.e. - a dish that contains ALL of the following: pancakes, eggs, hash browns, 3 kinds of meat and toast), Denny's or Perkin's may be a better option for you. 

They put their own spin on the more traditional dishes and have created an awesome list of in-house specialties. Whether you eat meat or not you MUST try The Meatless Meatloaf of the Gods. It's amazing. Like your beef? Definitely try the Blueplate Burger! Don't like beef so much but still want a burger? Try the Blueplate Burger with a locally made walnut burger. 

No matter who you are, Monty's is worth a try."}
{"text":"Oh my why didn't I review this place, like, a year ago?  

What's not to like about Monty's.  The only bad thing (which is really a great thing) is all menu choices, especially if you're a vegetarian.  It's sort of scaled-up-diner-food-meets-comfort-food, then add a fair share healthy options.  And great prices.  And great service.  Although it's not on Willy St. it still has the same friendly neighborhood atmosphere.  

So I've been to Monty's twice, both times late morning, and was seated and served quickly.  The first visit a friend and I split the spinach and feta omelet which was great and large enough for both of us, and a third friend had the salmon hash.  After our meal Monty himself (well, not sure if it was the Real Monty, so lets say the chef) came out to ask us how our meal was.  The second visit I went with a lunch item and ordered chicken fried steak, also great and the portions were easily enough for two people.  Once again Monty came out and greeted his diners!  Ordered a piece of Fat Elvis cake to go, which is banana cake layered with peanut butter fudge icing and topped with chocolate icing. Yum!"}
{"text":"Monty's Blue Plate Diner in Madison, WI

This place is one of my new favorite Madison spots! I love that immediately when you walk if you are greeted by a wall of desserts! I knew at first sight that this place was for me. I had visited a few times in the past just for the desserts and let me tell you... the dessert is amazing!!!! I have had the caramel walnut dutch apple pie a al mode twice now. I have also had the snickers pie twice and french silk. I just can not stress enough how important it is that the world experience these desserts. They are life changing!

The dessert is good but I don't say that to down play the other food. This last time I ordered the meatloaf stack. I think you can guess that I loved it as well. This place can do no wrong in my book. My meal looked like a tower of delicious beauty! The foundation was a modest slice of bread uplifted by the glorious meatloaf cooked to perfection directly on top of it. The next layer was the mashed potatoes. Now these taters were divine--seasoned and buttery followed by the crispy shoestring onion rings with the most lovely batter providing just the right amount of crunch and texture to the dish. The icing on the cake, wasn't icing at all (obviously) but the most delicious brown gravy I have ever tasted. This dish couldn't get any better. However, I do hope to try a few other items on the menu next time I visit. It shouldn't be long before I do again. 

In terms of the environment, of course the waiter we had was just the most precious little thing. He said he started in October and we were his first guest to tend to outside due to construction forcing the location to close their outside seating. The construction is still going on, but the seating is out for patrons to enjoy a meal or a quick dessert. 

If you want great service, great food, and absolutely great dessert... go as soon as you can to Monty's Blue Plate Diner!"}
{"text":"I can definitely see the appeal of Monty's. This delicious and clean diner serves up some tasty eats with a twist. It didn't take long for my buddy Corey D to share his love and thus I had to experience it for myself.

If you're not carrying a child, you must sample their drink menu. Looks super fantastic. Please have one for me. But beyond the cornucopia of boozy beverages lie various menus that will satisfy just about every craving. Sweet, savory, both...take your pick. 

During my visit, I sample the hash...but due to Corey's insight, I kindly asked if they could make my plate half sweet potato hash and half corned beef hash. Yes they can, and yes they did. The hash was nicely crisped and the corned beef perfectly salty. Portions were sizable without being gigantic, and honestly, I kind of appreciate that. No one needs to start their day with 6 pounds of corned beef hash. Yikes.

The sizes were just fine - I appreciate the substitution of fruit. Gotta add some healthy in your meal! My main gripe is for their biscuits. Mine was uber dry and crumbly. Bummer on the biscuit, but I'm sure I'll manage. 

Next time I make it up to Madison, I'd happily swing back into Monty's for another scrumptious breakfast."}
{"text":"Had the GBLT old soggy bacon,  had to ask for mayo because they put none on the sandwich. It was basically a lot of lettuce and tomato. The waffle fries were overvooked to the point they were too hard to eat.  Wanted to love this place but I was severly disappointed."}
{"text":"Loved this place, from the off-the-beaten path location to the old-school diner atmosphere to the awesome gluten free options to the friendly service and good prices. I had a reuben made gluten-free and was in heaven. SO delicious, with the equally awesome bean salad. Menu is huge - from sandwiches to comfort entrees like meatloaf (vegan too!) to salads and breakfast."}
{"text":"Went here last night after an exhausting day taking care of a newborn. Thankfully my baby slept through our entire dinner despite how loud the place is. The decor is simple but spacious and the service is really good and fast. We were seated immediately (on a Saturday night! ) and were served water by the waitress right away. She was friendly and always nearby her customers. My husband had the Mediterranean omelet  (can't remember what It's called). It had feta cheese,  mushrooms and spinach with potatoes on the side and a biscuit.  It was so good I wanted to steal his plate.  I got the meatless meatloaf.  It was very filling and the gravy was good but the  portion was way too big. By the time we were done we had no room for the amazing looking cheesecake. I guess we will have to come back to try dessert.  Oh and the couple next to us ordered an ice cream Sundae, it was ridiculously huge and looked awesome. Good for sharing!  I definitely recommend this once for simple diner food done well."}
{"text":"Great brunch, good service. 

Dinner is fancier diner food that might be a little overpriced for what it is."}
{"text":"Monday is hard for everyone. 
So if you ever come home from work disoriented (cuz it's Monday), Monty's there for you to take a good care of your Monday night meal. 

My bf and I had fantastic vegan 'breakfast for dinner' spread last night. The hash with tofu scambles + waffle fries. It was good, unexpectedly fabulous. 
The portion size is generous. I took home the left overs and lunching on it as I write this review. Bonus.

Monty's fruits pies are all vegan (i didn't know this). Pies are so-so for my taste, but not bad."}
{"text":"Monty's is rockin! Monty should be very proud what this and Food Fight in general have become. I've been to most Food Fight restaurants, but this is the first review I've dished out for this rockstar group.

Back to Montys.. it's kick ass.. from when you walk into the door up until paying your bill and walking out. Service is on point, food is fast and delicious, prices are fair, and the pie... oh my god the pie. I've given most of their pies a shot, and have never been disappointed. Have had to run a few extra miles but well worth it ;)

If you're EVER around the Atwood area, give Montys a shot. You may have to wait a bit, but trust me on this one.. it's well worth the wait.

Thank you and keep up the great work."}
{"text":"My hubby and I have been on a diner kick lately! About one week ago we visited Monty's for dinner. When I lived on the east side I would go there often for lunch. It has been years since I had the chance to check out what was on the menu. I was not disappointed. I had the mac and cheese and it was wonderful. Fresh and full of comfort food goodness. The service was great and we will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Craving a chocolate malt, I stopped in on a walk around 3 pm on a Friday afternoon. The place was largely empty, and spotless. I haven't been to Monty's in several years, after suffering from 'stomach issues' after dining here back then, I couldn't bring myself to chance it again.

No issues this time, I'm happy to report. I ordered a triple chocolate malt to go. Chocolate (Sassy Cow!) ice cream, chocolate milk and chocolate syrup. Really good, and worth the $7 price tag. Definitely killed the craving, and put a happy spring in my step for the rest of my errand walk around the Atwood area.

The service was fast and friendly, as there were more than enough employees waiting around for the afternoon and evening dinner rush to begin. Maybe next time I'll be brave enough to try the food again :-)"}
{"text":"Awesome spot for breakfast lunch and everything in between! My family and I normally eat at the downtown eateries but came across this gem on Yelp and had to try! 
Of course we couldn't pass up a chocolate malt to start. I enjoyed an omelet while my dad ordered a classic cheeseburger. You can't go wrong with either their extensive breakfast or lunch choices!"}
{"text":"Monty's is amazing. Try to get breakfast at Monty's every time I'm in town. Which over the past 15 years has been a lot. Love the atmosphere, the staff, the cleanliness of the place and most importantly the food!"}
{"text":"My table ordered: and I sampled it all.

- chicken pot pie with mashed potatoes
(fantastic, but a bit heavy on the rosemary)

- BLT with red fried potatoes
(came with Guacamole. Nice surprise and flavor)

- Chicken soup with side salad
(good homemade taste & look)

- Blueberry Pancakes with bacon
(Fluffy, moist, loads of berries, crisp bacon)

- French toast with sausage
(great cinamon sugar, smaller portion, tasty sausage)"}
{"text":"Great service and atmosphere.  The food is good - comfort food for the soul."}
{"text":"Great veggie options. Desserts are a must!"}
{"text":"The reviews on this place are legit, probably one of the best breakfast spots I've tried since using yelp. I was seated almost immediately and the service was very prompt and friendly. Yankee women love a southern accent....

I had the tex mex omelette, sweet potato hash, bacon, and fruit. It was all spot on. You must try the sweet potato hash, it was great and something different.

If I'm ever back in Madison for whatever reason, I will definitely swing by for breakfast."}
{"text":"So delicious. Great stop, on recommendation from a friend. Son had the vegan banana walnut pancakes... he said they were the best he's ever had. Daughter loved the med plate...hummus was delish! 2 had burgers... meat tasty and grilled nicely. We will be back!"}
{"text":"They have a bit of everything...I never get super excited to go to Monty's but it is never disappointing.  Possibly except for the 30-45 minute wait.

This last time, I went in seriously craving me some pie.  I ended up filling up on their mac and cheese.  No room for pie.  All of their pies at the time also just did not sound exactly to be what I wanted either.  I was craving a fruity cherry pie or something and it was just turning to fall so it was either chocolate or fall flavors.  Not their fault, but a curse of my pie needs.

The food is good.  I am not a huge breakfast person so pancakes are not usually my thing but they do have a few options I do eat, like breakfast potatoes and sometimes I even venture out of my comfort zone for the eggs.  I honestly do not think I have tried the same thing twice because they have so many options."}
{"text":"There are definitely hits and misses at Monty's. As a pesco vegetarian, I appreciate a restaurant where I have more than 3-5 options The hits would include the vegetarian meatloaf dinner, carrot curry soup, the salmon ceasar salad, almost all of their baked goods, and almost all of their breakfast items. The misses include the vegetarian reuben (called the Sheldon), it's just too dry.  Ditto on the vegetarian BLT.  The waits at weekend brunch and lunch time are long.  At times, I have experienced legendary slow service so dine with only people you can stand being around for 2 hours or more.  Despite the negative, I enjoy it, and I  take people who are new to Madison here, and they love it too."}
{"text":"Yum! Monty's was absolutely adorable. After eating dinner there I can say with certainty this will become one of my new regulars. Right when I walked in I knew it would be a place I would enjoy. The atmosphere was that of an older, trendy diner and had a quick moving, upbeat, friendly staff making the atmosphere even more enjoyable. My friend got the artichoke sandwich, delicious, and I got the chicken in a pie, right from grandma's kitchen. Afterwards we ordered a red velvet cupcake which was to die for, and all for under $15. We shared great conversation and didn't feel at all rushed, our waitress was great. She made recommendations and shared jokes with us, not seeming to put up a front at all. I will be going back sooner rather than later."}
{"text":"Been several times and always the same. Fun space, menu reads very well and you expect to get a great meal, but food is totally plain and unexciting. All hat, not cattle.  Don't waste the time or money, many better options around town."}
{"text":"Always great! I love breakfast and breakfast is ALWAYS  great here!  Giant pillowy biscuits, fresh organic eggs...had an omelette with spinach, feta cheese, and mushrooms, fried potatoes and coffee, my boyfriend had the meatloaf of the Gods... Oh my... You've got to try this! 
There's usually a little wait for a spot on Saturday but it's well worth it.  
Even walked here by myself once and sat at the cute little diner counter and felt completely comfortable and got just as good service. 
Then there's dessert... For that sweet tooth you give in to on the weekend...great cookies, cheesecakes, and bars- shakes and ice cream.  Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"I had attempted to go to Monty's Blue Plate Diner the last time I was in town, but it was so crowded that I was deterred and ended up at Ella's Deli for possibly the worst omelet of my life.  This time, I was determined to wait it out at Monty's for as long as it took - which ended up being only ten minutes at around 11:30 a.m. on a Sunday.  The wait was well worth every second.  My breakfast companion and I had the meatless meatloaf - a melange of carrots and other vegetables, covered in a cashew and sage gravy - and a caponata omelet, filled with a stew of perfectly-cooked, still-easily-recognizable vegetables and a pesto sauce made from basil grown out back.  Each bite of each dish was a delight.  I took home a slice of Reese's peanut butter cheesecake which I am hoping my son will find to be too rich for him because, uh huh!  That means I get to polish it off.  Can't wait to get back to Madison for another go-round at Monty's!"}
{"text":"Always loved this place, but last time we tried it had a terrible experience.  Wanted to order fish and was told they no longer served it.  About 5 minutes later the same waitress brings out a huge fish plate for the lady next to us.  We are like \" What the HECK\" ????  Needless to say if we are not good enough to eat what anyone else gets, then we are taking our business else where.  The food that we got was not that great this time anyway."}
{"text":"Eh it was okay. Maybe I should have ordered breakfast as that looks like that's what they are known for. But I was there at lunch time and craved a burger so that's what I ordered. It was ok nothing special to brag about. I would probably go there again but for sure going to try the breakfast."}
{"text":"Was staying on UW campus for a wedding so decided to venture a bit off and check out what else Madison had to offer. 

When we got to montys there was quite a crowd so must be serving up some good stuff. Our group of 6 only had to wait about 15 mins so not bad! The menu was really varied and had something for everyone. I ordered the wknd biscuits and gravy special, really tasty. The gravy was on the untraditional side with southwestern flare featuring  red and green peppers in it. My bf got the guac blt with waffle fries and others in the group got a Reuben, the country breakfast, and a burger. Oh and of course some yummy spicy bloody Mary's. 

Service was quick and friendly and were in and out in less than an hour! Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Came here once for dinner, and I was seriously impressed! I eat everything, but I love seeing places that have veggie and vegan/gf options. Monty's is the epitome of a classic comfort food diner, and they've gone so far as to have an amazing selection of vegan and vegetarian dishes on their menu. Comfort food + vegan? Yes, please! 

The service was great when I was there; our waitress was very attentive and the food came quickly.  The prices are a bit steep, but you do get a lot of food. 

I will be back for more delicious classics with interesting veggie/vegan twists! I recommend checking out their non-meat options even if you do eat meat...they're awesome!"}
{"text":"We got there were told it about 45 minutes wait, but there were seats at counter. We had lunch , food was great and service was great."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times. The food is outstanding. 2nd best biscuits this side of the Mason Dixon Line. And a cheese curd in my Bloody Mary? Yes, please and thank you. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Okay, I straight up ordered the \"heathen vegans shoplifter's delight\" because of the name.  

I'm not proud of my devil may care attitude when it comes to ordering food, but reckless abandon at Monty's has proven fruitful.

Delightful meal.  Everything about it matched the hippy dippy quarky way of MadCity life.  Service was a shade slow and it wasn't crowded by any means, but I had good company.  Who cares."}
{"text":"Monty's is one of those places that is WAY over hyped and I think that doesn't help it.

I've been here ONCE. One time. Ever. And I've never gone back. I lived 2 blocks away for three years and I now live on the end of Willy (still relatively close) and still have not gone back. It's been around 4 years since my first visit.

The food was by no means terrible. The service was fine. I was WAY put off by having to eat outside when it was 1,000 degrees out. It's ALWAYS busy. Always. They don't have enough places to sit and I would imagine not nearly enough places to park. The food was mediocre, at best. The service left PLENTY to be desired. We waited FOREVER to be sat, then waited forever to order, then waited forever to get our food.

Then our food wasn't even good and the bill was way too high for the meh experience we had.

I would really like to try it again. On paper, it's everything I love. Greasy spoon. Local. Close to my house. Vegetarian friendly. But the experience I had there was enough to keep me from ever going back, sadly.

Maybe I'll work up the courage to give it another chance at some point."}
{"text":"Big plates of food. Awesome staff. So, so many shake/malt options. 

This is the place I usually come after my flight has landed in Madison. The food isn't aiming to be some crazy, new, cutting edge concoction. It's homey and it's familiar. 

I've been to a lot of diners. Not every diner does it right, but this one does. If you want tasty food, and ample servings of it, at a good place then this is the place to go."}
{"text":"I loved this place! I went at night and got dessert to go - the Elvis cake is unbelievably good! My friend's giant cupcake was also great.

Since we liked the dessert so much we decided to go back and get brunch the next morning, which was also great. My friend loved her eggs with fresh salsa and home fries and the caramelized onion macaroni and cheese I had was a thing of beauty.

I will definitely return!"}
{"text":"This diner is super cute. The home made biscuits alone are worth going to Monty's. I went on a Saturday morning (in December) and there was no wait. I had the caponata & pesto omelette and my friend had a country breakfast. The portions were big and the food was great. If you like a classic breakfast in a simple, but cool setting, this is a great place to go."}
{"text":"We got seating at a booth for four people right when we got in. Our waitress was very attentive and friendly and we got our water very quickly. I ordered the roast turkey platter, which came with turkey breast, cranberry applesauce, broccoli, mashed potatoes, a dinner roll and gravy. The meal was okay, the gravy was extremely over powering. But the friends I ate with really enjoyed their meals. One thing I did like about this place was that they had and entire vegan menu - - and their vegan brownie was really good! We'll come back here soon for either breakfast or late night dinner to check out the breakfast food!"}
{"text":"Old school -- I enjoyed the meatloaf and there are some really great options if you are dining with a vegetarian."}
{"text":"This place has awesome decor. Great parking. Awesome staff. Mediocre food."}
{"text":"On the return drive from the north, we wanted a fun, local diner with great food. Yelp recommended the BPD as all of the above.

When you walk in you are immediately presented with a series of sinister pies. All shapes, sizes and flavors. Man I gotta save room for that. We went to our booth and were immediately surrounded by families and folks just having desserts: exactly what we were looking for.

For dinner, we had a very delicious chicken pie (how comforting, yet nuked perhaps?) and a vegan burger that was amazing! I have honestly never had such a delicious vegan burger. After reviewing the menu I quickly realized there were many vegan options. Excellent!

In all, our simple dinner came to $22 for both. We skipped the dessert simply because we ran out of room in our tums."}
{"text":"Monty's Blue Plate Diner is consistently good.  They use fresh and local ingredients; they put a lot of thought in their menu.  It is always hard to decide what to get when I stop by.

I found myself here the other morning before the Marquette Waterfront Festival and enjoyed the Eggs Mornay.  It's their take of the Eggs Benedict but instead of a Hollandaise sauce it's the cheesy cousin, Mornay.  The eggs were poached nicely, sitting on top of a thin but hearty slice of ham and English muffin.  The fried potatoes are seasoned with a tiny kick and slightly crunchy on the outside but soft enough to cut easily.

I topped the meal with a cup of coffee.  My server was very attentive with a water or coffee refills (almost to the point where I was going to hide my glassware).  But I would take that kind of service over never seeing a server.  I tipped her well for her efforts."}
{"text":"Monty's is still one of my favorite breakfast places!! Breakfast food is consistently delicious. My most favorite dish is the blue plate special omelette with salsa, cheese, avocado and bacon. Bread is from Madison sourdough, I think? Lots of breakfast options for meat lovers and vegetarians. Coffee is fantastic. Service is usually great. It's breakfast food that is wonderfully homemade with fresh ingredients. It's not a hole in the wall greasy breakfast joint, but it's equally as good!"}
{"text":"Went here on 07/17/16 with some people before going to the Overture to see Kinky Boots! The food was amazing and the service was great!"}
{"text":"I'm sad to say that after a really great first experience over one year ago, Friday night's dinner at Monty's was very disappointing and I probably won't come back any time soon.  The host at the counter was not friendly.  My sandwich came on bread that was literally hard as a rock and then my husband was done eating before I even started my dinner because I sent it back and waited for new bread. The bread the second time around was greasy and the sandwich itself was dripping in grease.  GROSS.  My husband ordered the fish fry and they forgot part of his order.  It was just a bad day for Monty's....I might be back for dessert someday."}
{"text":"This is a great place with an old time vibe. Service is fantastic and the food is definitely elevated!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat.   Zucchini Pancakes are awesome!!!  We mostly eat breakfast here but I'm sure lunch and dinner are just as good."}
{"text":"The neighborhood's excellent food quality sets a very high bar.  Monty's sandwiches half as good as Alchemy's.  Monty's chili half as good as Weary Traveler's.  Monty's vegan options almost as good as Green Owl's.  Monty's ice cream treats are half as good as the Chocolate Shoppe's.  All of those places are within a mile and none of them make you wait like Monty's.  If you like highbrow breakfast food, Marigold is generally better (but still crowded).  If you like middlebrow or lowbrow breakfast food, there's no need to pay $11 a plate.

Two nice things must be said about Monty's.  (1) The pie quality is above average with good selection.  (2) Hopefully, the crazy lines at Monty's drive people to other nearby places with better offerings.

In a one-bar town, Monty's would probably score four stars.  Alchemy, Weary Traveler, and Chocolate Shoppe are walking distance and Marigold is two miles.  And that's if you're not even considering Laotian across the street, or Vietnamese and Thai up the street.  Standing next to tall people makes me look even shorter; Monty's is so close to so many marvelous dining options that it just does not shine the way it used to before the competition heated up."}
{"text":"Visited with my family for first time. I have vegan diet and they don't, but we ALL enjoyed our meals. Will be back!"}
{"text":"The food at Monty's is fine but the service is bad. Every time I've gone there, I've had slow, inattentive servers who seem very confused.  To give you an idea of how displeased I am with the service, every time I go there I plan to get a piece of pie. I never do because the food takes so darn long to get to me.

That said they are an excellent place for getting vegetarian options and breakfast all day. They have lots of pies although they are a bit pricey."}
{"text":"The food is amazing!
It was my first time here. Saw the food ordered by the people next to us. That biscuit and gravy looks so good and so creamy~
I ordered the Wisconsin Salmon Hash (in the breakfast item). It's like having hash browns but with LOTS of salmon in it. Never thought that they could mix so well together. For every bite, you get that smell from the potatoes but at the same time you get a mouthful of yummy salmon.
My friend ordered the turkey sandwich with waffle fries, which also tasted very nice.
The pies and cakes from the front desk also look so yummy. But we were already too full to care for dessert :( will definitely try that next time!"}
{"text":"We stopped in on our way home to Chicago from Wisconsin Dells.   We had a 45 minute wait as it was a Sunday.  We were seated at 12 noon.   I ordered 1/2 corned beef hash and 1/2 Sweet Potato hash.  The corned beef was dried out in small cubes.  Tasteless.   The sweet potato hash was very tasty with just the right amount of spice.   Scrambled eggs were perfect.  Biscuit was fluffy and moist.  Service was good.    I understand the restaurant is very popular and we stopped after reading all of the positive reviews.  Next time, we will try another spot."}
{"text":"We stopped here on a road trip from Minneapolis to Chicago.  So glad we did. The meatloaf was the best ever."}
{"text":"I had high expectations for this diner, but unfortunately, I was highly disappointed with my meal. I ordered the Vegetarian Hash, which is actually vegan. It came with tofu scramble and a tempeh-laden potato hash. I was very excited to try this as the description sounded amazing and it looked SO good in the pictures. There was no flavor! How on earth do you mess up potatoes, onions, and tempeh! Those flavors just naturally compliment each other. Not here. And my hash had mushrooms in it, despite there being no mention of mushrooms on the menu's description. I hate mushrooms! The tofu was also flavorless.  To add insult to injury, they piled 4 slices of dry ass toast atop this dish. Like, why? 

The only good thing about this visit was the vegan milkshake. My shake consisted of vegan chocolate chip ice cream, chocolate sauce, and a cherry on top. They didn't have vegan whip cream but I didn't really miss it. The shake was thick, rich, and delicious. They also give you a lot for the money. That shake was worth an extra star all by itself.

I would come in just for one of their delicious vegan milkshakes, but that's about it."}
{"text":"Hands down the best diner I have ever been to... It all started a year back when my wife was looking for a place to treat me on my birthday and she came across Monty's...Ever since, it is first place that comes to our mind to enjoy a good weekend brunch. I always end up ordering a minimum of two items on the menu, not because the quantity is less but I just get greedy for having more. My personal best on the menu is their Tofu scrambler which has this never before kick ass taste."}
{"text":"I got violently ill an hour after eating here. I will never go back and would caution others to consider the same."}
{"text":"I went here reading positive reviews but my experience was exactly the opposite. Their food is absolutely okay...nothing exceptional about it."}
{"text":"A great diner experience!  They have a huge menu with a lot of variety.  I tried the Meatloaf of the Gods and it was delicious!  The meatloaf was tender and flavorful.  They finished it off on the flat top so the pieces had some texture on the outside.  Their gravy is on point, and they also have homemade ketchup which is awesome.

The decor is your classic diner feel with booths and the big display with desserts, etc.  The staff was friendly and the service was good.  This is definitely a must try if you're over on the east side."}
{"text":"I have only good things to say about Monty's! If you like unpretentious food that is filled to the brim with flavor you will also like Monty's. We had the meatloaf and chicken in a pie at our table. I think I said \"yumm\" no less than 9 times...really it couldn't be helped! The turtle cheesecake I got to go was also pretty spectacular. I appreciated the service as well. Our server was friendly and available without being overbearing. It was the perfect dinner."}
{"text":"Stopped here on the way home from the Dells because you bastards said it was good and guess what!? I AGREE!

Aside from the fact that it was freezing cold in there, I realllllllllly enjoyed the hell our of this place. First of all, the menu is composed of a bunch of awesome dishes; I wanted to order everything on the menu. It was as if they had scanned the portion of my brain that deals with Amanda eating habits and wrote a menu based on the data collected from the scan. Fettucini Alfredo and a turkey dinner!? Blue Plate, you shouldn't have! I'll order both!
Actually, I got a turkey sandwich with avocado on it. I realllllly like avocado. I really like turkey sandwiches, too, and let me tell you Blue Plate did not disappoint. Everything was mad good from the salad to the fries to the sandwich.

Cheap prices, good portions... If you're in the area I definitely suggest you hit this place up. Mail me the leftovers!"}
{"text":"Monty's was and always is, pretty grand. 

Are you looking for a greasy spoon diner? Monty's is your place. Are you looking for an affordable restaurant with MANY vegan options? Monty's is your place. 

On our most recent visit, I decided to go full vegan and order off that menu (yes, there's an entire menu of vegan options). I got the vegetarian hash and added almond cheese to the tofu scramble. Others at the table tried everything from the sweet potato hash to the chilaquiles. We also ordered some drinks and pies for dessert. 

Monty's is in an old gas station and there are cute, blue tables to sit outside when it's nice out. Overall, it's a very quaint little diner. 

The only thing that's frustrating is that there's almost always a wait and it gets very crowded in the waiting area. I did look up the menu online before going and it looks like the website had some outdated prices for some of the menu items."}
{"text":"How can you call yourself a diner when you don't even have real maple syrup?"}
{"text":"I had just moved from Colorado, back here, to the midwest. So of course, I ordered the meatloaf.

I told the server that it was better than my mom's, and that's no hyperbole -- it's DAMN good!

I will most certainly be coming back."}
{"text":"I FINALLY made it to Monty's! And I was not disappointed. I was surprised at the line being that we went around 10:30am on a Wednesday but the 10 minute wait was not the end of the world. The staff was friendly and we were waited on in a very timely matter. I opted to try the french toast which was mouth watering delicious. I also tried ordering a donut but was disappointed to find out they are only served on the weekends! 
All their desserts looked delicious but they were a little to expensive for my college budget so I had to pass. I will definitely be back to try some dinner food or explore other menu items!"}
{"text":"We love Monty's! Our son has egg and dariy allergies and we love all the vegan options they have. Breakfast is the trickiest meal for our son because almost all breakfast foods contain eggs and dairy. But there are several options for our entire family. Our son's favorite is the tofu scramble with their potatoes. Come early on a Saturday or Sunday the wait can get long but worth it.

One of my favorite things is the blue plate special omelette with bacon, avocado, cheese and salsa on top. I also really enjoy the vegan hash and in not even vegan!

I also like to come for lunch. Their meatloaf is delicious and the vegan sandwich with portobello mushrooms, avacados, and lemon tahini dressing.

I'm just sad Monty's isn't closer to our house."}
{"text":"Monty's goes back a very long time in Madison and is a great place to get a home-cooked style meal.  I used to go with my parents as a kid, and now as an adult I've started to rediscover how much I loved their food.

Nestled in the eclectic Atwood Ave neighborhood, Monty's presents a 50's style diner with yummy lunch specials like meatloaf (very good meatloaf), sandwiches, and a wicked good brunch.  They also have ridiculously delicious chocolate shakes, so don't be afraid to splurge while you're there.  

One of the other great things about Monty's is the atmosphere; the area around it is filled with little mom and pop shops, the Barrymore theater, and relics of an older time.  Take a stroll around if it's a nice day and your bound to find something you like.  If not, I'm sure you probably enjoyed the food as all the dishes I've ever had were great and the portions were generous.

There are a few drawbacks though that held me back from giving a 5 star review.  First, there is usually a very long wait.  The place is popular, but I don't feel that the food and eastside location (I live far westside) always justifies the overall experience.  Secondly, the service is hit or miss.  I've had some waitresses who were prompt and polite, making me feel right at home, and others who were sarcastically rude to the point where people in my party almost had to say something.  Furthermore, the kitchen doesn't always look clean, as trays of biscuits have been left sitting out and flies have been a buzzing.

Setting all those things aside though (which I know may be hard for some), the blue plate is a Madison delight that should not be missed.  The food is so good you'll be stuffed in a recliner when you get home pining for more."}
{"text":"THEY HAVE PIES AND CAKES. 

But how can you have any pudding if you don't eat your meat???

Ahem, the \"meat\":
Bacon and cheddar omelet with american fried potatoes.
Scrambled egg whites with sweet potato hash of peppers, onions, and zucchini.
Spinach, onion, mushroom, and feta omelet with fresh fruit.
homemade BISCUITS :o 

Now you can eat your pudding."}
{"text":"NEVER had a bad meal at Blue Plate.  Great for any meal of the day.  Service always good whether you are at a table, at the counter, or outside on the patio.  Plenty of vegan and gluten free choices."}
{"text":"Awesome place to get brunch. Have a good menu for vegans and vegetarians as well.  The breakfast burrito is to die for and I had some spectacular biscuits and gravy there as well. Their dinner is also pretty good, but I'd definitely go for brunch. They also have amazing pies. The interior is a cool blue diner feel. Expect a wait for brunch, but it's worth it!"}
{"text":"I had that chicken pot pie and it was wonderful!  My husband ordered soup and forgot to order a salad, but the soup was so huge that he wouldn't have been able to eat a salad.  My son had a burger and loved the fries.  Really a nice place with attentive wait staff.  Get there early though, because they were out of every kind of pie that my husband wanted.  The shakes were amazing!"}
{"text":"I love Monty's and all the creative, new touches on diner classics."}
{"text":"Delicious Food.  Big portions.  Amazing service.  Maybe just slightly overpriced, but not really considering the quality and size."}
{"text":"Their banana pie and carrot cake are SUPER!!!!!!!
and if you happen to buy the whole container, you are required to give a 5-dollar deposit which will be returned if you bring it back.

Oh Monty, finally!
This morning, though I am still a little bit ill, I came only for you :) (and for me:))
Waiting for less than 10 minutes, we were seated by the window. A very nice spot. 

I decided quickly: I wanted to have a dish of scramble \"something\" (hahaha, I found this funny, I was wondering what \"something\" meant. I asked the server and she said it is for broccoli, pepper, some cheese (and God knows what else!-- too many to list! :D) and has no meat (yay!)
Hubby ordered a dish of pesto omelet! Both came with homemade biscuit- I'm in love with this biscuit right away! We enjoyed our brunch soooooooooooo much. 
I told the waiter: The food is excellent! I wanna come back soon!

The food is a five.
The service is a five.
Yes, full score for you, Monty. 

Sshhhhh, don't forget to also order their coffee and the donut.
The coffee is really an eye opener and the donut is ridiculously huge but so GOOD.

Monty has made my Saturday happy! and I really need that after one week of my illness :(
Mahalo, Monty!"}
{"text":"Monty's is a Madison favorite.  Breakfast all day.  Fantastic comfort food.  Friendly service.  Veggie options.  While nothing spectacular, it's consistently pretty damn tasty.  Of note: popular breakfast (expect to wait) and the Meatloaf of the Gods."}
{"text":"When I was in Madison as a student I loved to go to the Blue Plate with friends because they always had options for the meat eaters and the vegetarians. As a former vegetarian, I think I first came here when I was a vegetarian. It was a long time ago. The diner theme is part of the aesthetic here, and my favorite dishes are the meat loaf, and the breakfast scrambles. My friend and I got two big breakfasts and the service was good on what looked like a crazy-busy Sunday brunch-rush. The coffee dude was keeping our cups full and warm as our server was moving past us bringing out amazing plates of super fresh food, yet always checking with us to see how we were doing. Busy, high quality standards, and lots of great cakes and pies if you have any room. I used to get the pie/cake to go, but not this time. 

It is just wonderful to see a place that was good over 10 years ago, still keeping its standards high and keeping people like me wishing they still lived in Madison! Great place. Great food. Great people."}
{"text":"Update on July 7th, 2015: Monty's you never disappoint. Still in love with this place! :)

Vegetarian's/ Vegan's Eden ~ Many options to select from!
I don't know why I haven't written a review for Monty's even after being here so many times but finally here it is...
What we have eaten here so far:
Vegetarian Hash, Vegetarian Chili, Chicken in a Pie, German's Chocolate and all of their pies! (my favorite the Key Lime)
Tofu Scrambler - The BEST DISH in house. The best tofu scramble I have ever eaten. This is definitely on our every order.
And their potatoes are one of the best I have ever had! What do you put in your seasoning?!
I don't even have to rate each and every item because they are all so good!
Service: 5
Servers are always friendly, helpful, and fast!
Price: Absolutely reasonable."}
{"text":"Had the vegan banana walnut pancakes.  Delicious!

Service was fast and polite.

My partner had the morning bun.  VERY GOOD.

They were out of the homemade donuts by 11:00AM :( - get there early to try those!

I knock off one star because they were really good but not the best."}
{"text":"Gosh, for the dozens of meals I've had here, I'm surprised I haven't rated this place yet.  I used to live just down the block, on Jenifer St.  That was about six years ago, but to this day I can recall several legendary menu items from heart.  The Meatloaf of the Gods.  The Meatless Meatloaf of the Gods.  The Reuben.  Reuben's vegetarian cousin, the Sheldon.  The Mediterranean Sunrise breakfast.  The potato-zucchini pancakes with sour cream and cranberry-applesauce.  Each of these was a delicious new step for me in discovering the foodie scene in Madison when I lived there.

So when I visited recently with my old roommate from Jenifer St., Monty's was the natural choice to grab a bite to eat.  To my initial dismay, the menu had been updated... no more Sheldon!  This was my favorite vegetarian Reuben sandwich back in the day.  I asked the waiter about it, and he offered to get a Sheldon made for me, no problem!  When it arrived, it was exactly as I had remembered it.  Delicious tofu and sauerkraut on rye bread with a side of Thousand Island dressing.  After a long day, I couldn't think of anything more satisfying.

Monty's is a true gem that stands tall, even among Madison's robust food culture.  Every time I go here, my expectations are exceeded.  I can't recommend it enough."}
{"text":"I flew into Madison with only two hours of sleep & no food, so excited to spend time with my Darling Daughter (DD). Our first stop was Monty's Blue Plate Diner.  When you enter the diner the first thing you see is the dessert case. They have their own bakery (examples: pies, cakes, giant cupcakes, donuts, pecan rolls, etc). Then you notice the casual, friendly atmosphere with booths & tables. My hubby will love the fact they serve breakfast all day, everyday & they have a To Go menu.
Our server, Keith W, was personable, prompt, & so helpful in describing the different dishes. DD & I each ordered a coffee with donut ($2.79 per order) DD ordered Florentine, one of their specialities.  (Sautéed spinach, onions, tomatoes and two poached eggs on top of crusty sourdough bread and finished with Mornay sauce & American fried potatoes  $8.99). I ordered Eggs Mornay: Two poached eggs with smoked ham on a toasted English muffin, topped with Mornay sauce & served with American fried potatoes $8.99.
You can order any one of six different hamburgers (five can be made gluten sensitive and one is Vegetarian) between 11am until closing. But that's not all.... They serve 11 different Entrees, 14 sandwiches, 5 salads & at least 3  soups! And I know all of that sounds wonderful, but I haven't even started to describe the specialty shakes, malts, sundaes and fountain drinks. My brother is a huge Elvis fan, so he'll probably love the \"Fat Elvis Shake\": vanilla ice cream, peanut butter, sliced bananas, & a splash of chocolate syrup ($6.99)! Yum!"}
{"text":"Even though I had takeout, I really loved the inside of Monty's- it reminded me of the diners back home in New Jersey. I loved that they had homemade pies & cakes lining the glass display cases. I have been here twice and tried to get a table, but the wait was too long both times. 

I had the Chilaquiles, a favorite of mine, and theirs was really yummy:
Berkshire pork simmered in a tomatillo chili verde served over crispy corn tortillas with two eggs, pico de gallo, and feta cheese

It was a huge portion, too, so I had it for two meals. Would definitely go back here, and would like to eat in next time!"}
{"text":"This was the third restaurant I every visited in Madison, back in 2004.  It remains a go to for relatively healthy diner food.  Great vegetarian options as well as delicious burgers.   Save room for desert!  The cakes and pies are wonderful, and you can also get yourself a milkshake that truly lives up to America's Dairyland standards."}
{"text":"I love Monty's. I've been coming to Monty's for years now, and if you haven't checked it out yet, you are seriously missing out. 

The restaurant itself it super cute. Small diner with booths and some tables, as well as counter service. Blue lighting up on the ceiling ties into the the Blue Plate theme. A collection of adorable tea pots up the walls. Love it. 

The food is amazing. Monty's offers food for everyone: carnivores, veggies, vegans, gluten sensitive.... Whatever you're diet or needs, they got you. 

I've had several dishes and I have enjoyed them all. I think my favorite to date though would be the Eggs Mornay. The Mornay sauce is so creamy and delicious! 

Both of the french toast options are delicious. The Huevos Rancheros are done very well. Honestly I don't think I have ever had anything other than breakfast here, but the hamburgers I have seen served look AMAZING. Big and juicy. On the last visit, the BF got the chicken pot pie, which also looked fantastic. Done a little differently than most pot pies - it looked he was served a slice of a large pot pie, instead of a little single serving. Pretty neat! He gobbled it up and said it was great. 

Overall, Monty's is a staple to Madison's Atwood neighborhood and I love it. Again, if you haven't tried it yet, please do. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Walnut Burger is the way to go.. Their bean salad as a side option is Delish. Not expensive, long waits on weekends in the mornings but worth it."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I stopped here for dinner last night and we were both impressed with the quality and the price of the diner food. The beef is local, from Black Earth, and the coffee is their own blend. The cupcakes were awesome!! Our waitress was really friendly and prompt also."}
{"text":"I love Monty's and come here every time I come into Madison!  As a vegan it offers a large amount of vegan choices and it's so tasty.  Staff is friendly, atmosphere is great!  Everything I've ever had off the vegan menu is AMAZING!!!"}
