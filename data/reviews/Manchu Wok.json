{"text":"I picked it because the food is attractive and looks fresh. I tried the BBQ pork and Tofu with Mushroom with fried rice. They actually tasted very good. The staff gave pretty portions and the price is reasonable. A good selection for quick lunch."}
{"text":"I went to this Chinese cuisine today, I have to say is not bad. The food looks fresh and it is really cheap. Basically u cannot ask too much for a fast food, but the beef broccoli is really awesome. Overall I give 4 stars."}
{"text":"This is by far the worst Manchu Wok I ever had, I ordered 2 items dish with chicken wings and tofu fu mushroom, I only got 1 winglet and wing drum (1 complete wing) and the batter was so thick , almost the same size as the wing, the tofu mushroom was so salty, I couldn't finished half of it, it's a total ripped off."}
{"text":"The food is always good, but the customer service is horrible. I believe the name of the person behind the counter serving us today was \"Dea.\" A very rude lady. No greetings, no eye contact, and does not speak when spoken to. Her response to saying that she shouldn't be rude to customers was, literally, \"I don't care. Talk to the manager.\" I was very confused regarding her entire attitude and demeanor. I would not recommend anyone going to this location because of my experience today."}
{"text":"I went to the one in Yorkdale Mall. I brought for my daughter the Sesame Chicken. The last thing in them waa chicken, it was just friend dough balls, just disgusting. Needless to say, never going back"}
{"text":"I went to Manchu Wok in the Yonge/Eglinton food court today around 4 pm. I ordered the Sweet & Sour Pork and the fried rice. The pork was tough and some of the pieces were stuck together and very weird looking. The fried rice was very dark in colour, almost black. It tasted like it had been drowned in soy sauce. The meal was so horrible that after a few bites I had to throw it in the garbage. I wish I had had the nerve to ask for my money back. I have been to other locations of Manchu Wok and they were okay, but this one was bad. Maybe the food was not at its best because it was late in the day, but really there is no excuse for serving food like that. Needless to say, I will not be going back."}
{"text":"Entr√©es at lunch time are always cold. I have been there once a week for the last 3 weeks but no more.  #fail"}
{"text":"Just had the General Tso right out of the kitchen. Did not taste good, over priced, short size on the portion. Egg roll was ok."}
{"text":"This is the place to go when you feel like stuffing yourself with some greasy Chinese food! It's pricey but the portions are large. I come here as a last resort, when I get tired of everything else in the Yonge/Eglinton food court. 

I guess a healthier alternative would be Terriyaki Bowl in the same food court, but food not cooked with oil taste a bit bland to me. 

Come everyone! Off to my house, I think i can stir up something in between!"}
{"text":"We went to taste noodles, because we saw other day some dude's food from there and it looked amazing. It was very disappointing when we saw no staff, dirty counters and not so delicious looking food... But, we decided to give it a chance. We shouldn't have. It was expensive. It didn't taste good. Noodles tasted bad. Do not enter here."}
{"text":"Horrible service. We didnt even get acknowledged by the cashier/server. They let everyone cut in front of us. We spent money elsewhere. They discriminate against certain groups. Dont go here"}
{"text":"I ate at this place, when I was at Charlotte - Douglas International Airport. The very moment I finished eating the not-so-good food, it felt like something was stuck in my throat. I thought it was rice or something, but apparently, nothing was stuck in my throat. I realized later on that I got a sore throat from that food that I ordered. Now, I have very bad colds. I'm not eating in this place again. NEVER AGAIN."}
{"text":"Horrible food. Noodles and vegetables tasteless. Ginger beef and honey chicken was almost all breading and gristle. Chicken balls were formed chicken nuggets. I've paid less for much better quality. If it were not for the lack of restaurant selection in the departure side if the terminal, this place would not get any business."}
{"text":"Wow, 

Not sure how you screw up run of the mill Chinese food but they did. Bland and greasy and steer clear of the Shanghai noodles.

Blah-zay indeed."}
{"text":"Chinese food sounded good as soon as we stepped off the plane. How bad  can you really mess up orange chicken?

What I (regretfully) swallowed:

COMBO PLATE: ORANGE CHICKEN WITH STEAMED VEGGIES AND WHITE RICE: I was not sure what I was eating. Is there even any chicken in there? It was just huge clumps of heavily breaded something then heavily doused with sauce. Then I had a look at my veggies: Why are my carrots outlined in black? Why are my squash a darker shade of brown?

This wasn't a good idea at all. I was praying I didn't get sick on the way home.

Stay away!"}

{"text":"Horrible customer service. \"Zelda\" specifically should be fired. Spend some time finding quality people.... go to any other quick dining spot."}
{"text":"Aaaaarrrggghh!!!! Why didn't I check reviews of this place before eating here with my kids. Maybe I was desperate because they were starving and they like Panda and the place looked like a carbon copy. I always thought Panda was suckiest chinese food; Boy was I way off on that!!!

Where do I even start?!?! We all ordered a one item and rice combo, both my kids ordered sweet and sour something or other and I ordered Kung pao chicken. The rice was just blah and my Kung pao chicken should have been called Kung pao veggies because there was only a marble sized piece of chicken and a few chicken crumbs hardly worth what they charged and no spicy-ness anywhere to be found. My kids chicken was mostly bread coating with sauce. None of the plates had any flavor and the portions were minuscule to boot. For the three of our plates and three drinks came out to over 30 bucks. I never felt so violated.

I know this stuff is on par with mall food; strike that, after eating here, I would gladly overpay for mall food. This was a tragedy of ingredients thrown together by non caring robot employees and way overpriced for the tasteless food and portions you get to even bother wasting any of your money, heck, McDonald's sounds like gourmet fare compared to this place.

Bottom line: don't Manchu Wok.....Manchu RUN the hell the other way If you happen to find yourself in front of this place!!!!"}
{"text":"Desperation brought me here, I only got green beans and fried  rice.  Nothing looked good. Rice was not from a wok, more like minute rice from a bag maybe? 

Typical costly menu for airport. Embarrassed they call this Chinese food."}
{"text":"Tasteless.... I come to this place all the time because of business travel thru NC. The food is fresh but needs salt and flavor!

What can I say... it's the only Chinese food here to go."}
{"text":"Thanksgiving trip to Vegas, we didn't check in to the Monte Carlo until almost one in the morning and I was practically asleep, but I knew I needed to catch a second wind. I headed to the casino, ordered a Bloody Mary, then went to go find food. The pizza looked old, I didn't want McDonalds, Rubios Fish Tacos did not sound appetizing at 1:00 AM, and the chicken place was closed...Chinese it is!

I got a one item combo plate with nothing else for $9. I asked for half and half fried rice/chow mein, and I ordered their sesame chicken.

The rice had zero flavor and was pretty old tasting. The chow mein also tasted horrible and the consistency of the noodles was gross, and the chicken was so sweet it was literally like eating pieces of candy. I went back and got some soy sauce to try to liven up the bland food, but even soy sauce couldn't help it. 

I gave up and ate some of my friend's Chicken McNuggets from McDonalds. Stay away."}
{"text":"Food was ok. Noodles were different than I was use to at other locations. 
The person wasn't the friendliest and automatically assumed I wanted to eat there and put it on a plate. When I asked her if I can get it to go, she did it and plopped my food into the to go. 
For $10 I had better and healthier. 
Wish I went somewhere else."}
{"text":"Under no circumstance should you eat here. The chicken tasted like shrimp (look out if you are allergic), the noodles were bland, and the remaining dishes were terrible. Worst $12 I have ever spent."}
{"text":"Fine substitute for ipecac.  

Avoid at all costs: this is the worst of all airport food.  Anything looks delicious and reasonably priced after you've eaten Manchu Wok."}
{"text":"Really good Chinese food prepared fresh and made to order upon request. I got the 2 entree dinner with noodles and enjoyed that they don't drown their food super sweet sauces like the Panda Bear does.

Very good food, numerous choices"}
{"text":"This place is why McDonald's is always an option.  Overpriced, small portions, gristly meat.  Zero stars but I have to give it one just to have this show up.

I get it.  It's Vegas, I'm in a casino hotel, they have to soak me.  It's probably in the corporate charter: \"Overcharge on everything\".  Still, if you're going to give me a place of shitty food, at least fill the plate.  The food costs perhaps a dollar to make per plate, maybe two.  In NYC you're out the door for six bucks with a can of Coke.

Nah, the place is a complete ripoff.  Do not go here.  Ever."}
{"text":"To be fair I was shoveling down their food faster than a ditch digger before a rainstorm. But it was totally gross! The Kung pao  chicken wasn't even spicy or had any flavor. Neither did the fried rice and noodles. The best thing in my dish was the steamed vegetables. I would get those again. $25 for two 2-side meals and the large soda."}
{"text":"Service is TERRIBLE! FOOD was Yuck! Compared to other Manchu Wok, this is absolutely garbage! Basically they just put dried orange at the top of there orange chicken! And they dont give you enough, their paper plate sucks!"}
{"text":"Holy God, I should have checked the reviews before eating here. Because of my tragic inability to read a map, I apparently walked to the completely wrong end of the Atrium in search of Salsaritas. Near some other unsavory selections, this seemed to be the quick & easy choice.

I'm no stranger to food court Chinese. In fact, I used to look forward to stopping in the mall with mom and brother to cheaply nibble on the toothpicked free samples of sweet & sour chicken before buying a plate and splitting it three-ways. Americanized Chinese food is comfort food in a way. Dependable, affordable, tasty.

This was none of those things. I went for the two-item dish which comes with rice (no white rice or brown rice option; only fried). I chose General Tso's and Beef & Broccoli. Both were dished up in IDENTICAL sauces. Let's call it Brown Sauce. Brown Sauce has no flavor. And it's cornstarched to hell, so it's thick and blubbery like day-old gravy. Brown Sauce has no business being on General Tso's Chicken. Brown Sauce made me embarrassed FOR my food. I ended up dumping half my meal... and I never do that.

I love CLT's classy atrium, but can't recommend this dining option. If you need me, I'm brushing up on my cartography."}
{"text":"It's like they want to kill us honestly with this grub from the food court. I'm frequently at Scarborough Town and dread temptation especially when they scream \"End of Day, $4.99!!!!\" from the top of their lungs. 

Ashamed to say I've given in here, chicken is that soft kind of gross with bland rice. Plus looking at the photos of the kitchen from here makes me never want to return here for food."}
{"text":"I ordered the chicken balls, should've gone to McDonald's right next to it. Because the \"chicken balls\" which the server didn't add sweet and sour sauce to. The whole line felt very rushed. It is important to note that there was No one in line when I began my order"}
{"text":"Jeez. The black pepper chicken didn't have much flavor. The cooked celery in it lacked crispness. They mght try cooking it fresh. The items on the menu don't require much to cook. I don't like to give low ratings as I want to see a business do well. 
Also the orange chicken had a bit of flavor."}
{"text":"I will never ever eat at a airport Manchu walk unless I am super hungover!  Seriously"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, fast service.. Orange chicken was great, kung Pao chicken barely had any chicken in it.."}
{"text":"The \"Chinese\" food at Manchu Wok is disgusting. If I could give zero stars, I would. This swill (General Tso's chicken was soft and reminded me of GLUTEN) was so absurdly bad that I couldn't finish it, and my friends know I can eat ANYTHING. The lo-mein was tasteless. It was \"Panda Express\"-expensive, but not remotely as tasty.

I ate here when I was semi-stranded at the Charlotte Douglas airport overnight - the only positive was that the meal was comped by the airline.

Everytime you eat there, God kills a kitten. Oh, and Manchu Wok profits. Avoid this place."}
{"text":"For the most part, I like to quick fast food court food from Manchu wok. Its not the greatest but good when you're hungry. I ordered the Shanghai noodles, orange chicken and honey garlic chicken. It was good and luckily the food came out fresh out of wok. Overall, a decent place to grab food court food."}
{"text":"This is the Manchu Work in Scarborough Town Centre.
I have to say the whole experience was a mess. I simply wanted to order 2 types of meat and pay with AMEX. 
First, I asked if they take AMEX, and with a broken English accent they said \"yes\". Second, I asked if I had to get rice with the meal, and they said yes, its mandatory. 
I wasn't thrilled that I had to pay for fried rice but I decided what the heck; I was hungry (bad time to make decisions), and I was thinking about Panda Express (an American Chinese cuisine chain).  So, even thought I don't generally eat fried rice and don't like being forced to pay for things that I didn't request, I went for it. 

Well, once I ordered what I wanted, I went to pay for my meal; guess what, they didn't take AMEX. Nonetheless, I paid with MasterCard. I got my fountain drink and meal, and asked my final question: can I get a refill, he said yes for a $1- what a joke.

Are they kidding me, a dollar for a refill? This business has no concept of understand the customer needs, or satisfying the customer. They simply see the customer as a transaction, where they acquire a monetary gain. The entire meal cost me $11.50, I couldn't get a refill, and was forced to pay for friend rice.

On top of all that, when I went to eat the food I discovered that the honey garlic chicken was not throughly cooked, and the diet coke was flat. I was fuming at this point, but decided it wasn't worth my time. I simply threw the food away, and I will never give business to this chain again. Jimmy the Greek should have been my first choice."}
{"text":"I normally love Manchu wok,  the chicken was old and crunchy could barely chew it was so hard,  the rice was edible thow"}
{"text":"Standard fare Chinese court food. 

I went with the General Tao with sides that consisted of steamed veggies and fried rice. The General Tao was good, the veggies were OK and the steam rice were very dry (as in cooked and heater for quite some time). If this is the best I can get during primetime lunches during the Holiday season..... I don't want to come here at any other time! 

Price tag was about $12 and quite honestly, there are simply better options to be had. Average experience."}
{"text":"My breathe smells like regret.  Was hoping to get some last minute ginger beef before hopping flight to Calgary.  I got a plate full of gristle and batter.  Noodles had zero flavor.  I should have known better.  Threw out most of it and sat in the airport with a sad face before boarding.  I get that it's airport Chinese food but the bar should be set a little higher."}
{"text":"I should have checked Yelp on my phone before coming here.  Came here for some mid-day munchies after doing some drinking.  From the outside, it looks just like panda express, the food items are even similar, but the taste it terrible.  The items just feel like fried, salty, blocks of flour (got the sweet sour pork).  The rice was way overcooked and dry (probably felt this way from sitting around for so long).  Price is way steep for what you get.  I really can't recomment this place."}
{"text":"A food court isn't a food court UNLESS it has a Manchu Wok. There's nothing particularly good about Machu Wok, of course. It's chicken balls slathered in sweet and sour sauce, honey garlic ribs, lemon chicken and rice. You know, stuff real Chinese people eat in China nearly every single day. It's just comforting to know when you're tired of McDonald's, where very little of their food these days is slathered in syrups, you can still get meat in syrup. 

Pro-tip: avoid the rice. Go for the noodles."}
{"text":"Needed something cheap and quick to eat.. decided on this and it was a bad decision. It looks like Panda Express but tastes nothing compared to it. Had a funky sour taste. 

Not a fan."}
{"text":"Inedible.  I left mad because I lost my short layover to the beef broccoli.  Mushy fried rice, tough and bad tasting beef, broccoli dissolved to the touch."}
{"text":"Honey Sesame Chicken is poor frozen then fried chicken with what seems to be a honey flavored syrup on the outside.  Kung Pao Chicken was equally bad, Chow Mein was unflavored noodles with cabbage. It is a food court but service is very poor, the woman at the counter clearly feels like she is doing you a favor serving you this food.  I was hungry and tried a single bite of each item and then tossed the entire meal.  There are decent food courts in Vegas, based on Manchu Wok, this is not one of them.  Hopefully with the remodel the Monte Carlo will step it up, this food shouldn't be served anywhere.  Oh and it was $12+ for a very small portion of each protein and a large portion of boiled noodles."}
{"text":"Located in Dufferin mall main food court.  Haven't been to machu wok in awhile and remember it being decent if you are craving some chinese food in the area.  Noticed a sign for end of day special $4.99 and had to check it out.  Was able to find a box full of black pepper beef, sweet sour pork, veggies and no rice.  The black pepper beef had celery and mushrooms mixed with a black pepper sauce.  Wasn't too salty and tasted good.  The sweet sour pork was bad as it had pieces that were just batter and the batter was all soggy with sauce.  The veggies included broccoli, baby corn, cabbage and carrots and they all tasted good and not overcooked.  Would try it again but would avoid anything that looks deep fried."}
{"text":"Manchu Wok, the McDonald's of Chinese food.  Is there a food court that doesn't have a Manchu Wok in it? ( I mean in a mall that isn't ghetto).

Anyway, back to the food.  This Manchu Wok seems to have specials fairly often.  I've stuck with the Orange chicken, with noodles and sometimes add the veggies.  Serving size is fairly large (I feel full after eating the 3 piece combo).  Chicken is tasty, noodles are standard, veggies are fresh, but serving size can be a bit small.  Serving size also depends on the server (strangely enough, the manager gives out larger portions than the regular staff).

Daily special pricing seems to be a little more than Bourbon St Grill a couple stores over, but has more selection of Chinese dishes.  If you want to try a sample, staff are happy to give you a taste.

If you are in the mood for Canadian Chinese food, this is your place.

Question - Is a sweet and sour chicken ball in any other shape still a sweet and sour chicken ball?  I'll let you know when I order the sweet and sour chicken (strips)."}
{"text":"While shopping at STC, I felt it necessary to take a break and cleanse my...I'll just say it. I was HUNGRY!

My cousin and I went our separate ways to find what we wanted. My cousin came back with nothing but I had yet another craving for plain, steamed rice. 

Of course the foodie in me couldn't go up to the counter and ask for only rice and be able to live with myself; therefore, eyeing the honey, garlic chicken, the server noticed my interest and gave me a piece to try. It was delicious, slightly sweeter than I'm used to but big enough that it covered both my lunch and dinner.

I originally had it assembled on a plate but they were not shocked to see me return for a take-away container no questions asked. For a busy food court, servers were friendly, service was prompt and they had at least one satisfied customer (me)!"}
{"text":"So disappointing for a $9 worth of food. There was only 4 beef strip on the box. A lot of bell peppers and poor customer service. A kind of business like this and inside a casino and by the strip? It gives poor reviews and an unwelcoming responses. It's actually supposed to be a no star"}
{"text":"Welcome to Manchu Wok. If you haven't heard of it before, welcome to North America.

Manchu Wok is, as they say, \"what it is\". If you go here expecting gourmet cuisine for 8 bucks, you will leave disappointed.

Here is what I find to like and dislike about the place...

1. They have fast service.
2. The servers are basically nice.
3. They only take debit.
4. There are vegetable choices, and also less fried choices.
5. The Honey Garlic Chicken, General Tsaos, and Mongolian Beef are all here and taste like the westernized versions that you find everywhere.
6. The rice can taste a bit off from sitting on the steam table too long. I don't know if they have white rice, but it couldn't hurt to ask.
7. It is cheap. If you are looking for quick, cheap, and not every day, this is not that bad."}
{"text":"After spending the early afternoon relaxing in the Monte Carlo sports book, I realized I was getting very hungry.  Knowing that my husband wasn't going to leave the sports book for another 3.5 hours until football was over, I ventured into the Food Court.  I stumbled upon Manchu Wok and saw that they offered Egg Drop Soup and I was sold.  It seems like all businesses in the desert like to blast the air conditioning, so a nice hot soup was just what I needed.  I ordered an Egg Drop Soup and a Chicken Egg Roll to split with the hubby in order to tide us over until dinner time.  The soup was gigantic!  It must have been a quart!  Had I known that, I probably wouldn't have ordered the egg roll too.  The soup was good and definitely hit the spot.  I was disappointed though that they don't offer crispy noodles.  I really like putting them into my soup.  The Chicken Egg Roll was good and had a nice flavor to it.  I made sure to grab some duck sauce for the egg roll.

Overall, a decent option when you're looking for a quick bite in Monte Carlo."}
{"text":"Got Chow Mein, orange chicken and Kung pao chicken. Flavor was OK. Eat here if you're lazy to go out to find other Chinese places. I would choose Panda Express over this any day."}
{"text":"During my recent stay in Toronto, Canada....I decided to stroll through the mall. Like any typical shopping mall, there was a food court! I wasn't all that hungry but knew I needed to put a little something in my tummy. This food court actually had a pretty good variety of cuisines ranging from Indian, Mexican, African, Caribbean, Chinese, Japanese, and Morracan, it almost overwhelmed me with the choices I had? I decided upon Manchu Wok and ordered Honey-Garlic Chicken with Fried Rice and Shanghai Noodles and a Egg Roll. I must say that I like real Chinese cuisine, not the typical fast food type. I must have been really hungry because this was really tasty...pleasantly surprised even for fast food! If the question were to ever pop up, Destry upon your next visit to Toronto's Fairview Mall Food Court, would you return to this food court and Manchu Wok again? Yes, indeed I would!"}
{"text":"Not impressed at all. Didn't even finish my orange chicken or fried rice. Avoid at all costs..."}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch - some of the offerings looked a little suspect as they are pre-cooked and then placed in a container to keep the food hot.

I opted for the fried rice and Orange chicken.

It's very average, ordinary Americanized Chinese food. The fried rice was very bland, but the Orange chicken was not bad. It had a nice flavor and a crisp texture on the outside."}
{"text":"This Manchu Wok has been a place I have eaten at Carrefour Laval for quite some time.  It used to be a place I quite enjoyed.  They served large portions and the quality for cheap food court Chinese food was okay.  Then I noticed the portions seemed to me to be a bit smaller.  Also you get some chunks of just fried breaded mix with sauce.  This is a technique to rip you off as you eat a few chunks of breading and they use less meat.  It's a careful mix by the restaurant and a clever cost cutter,  however I understand this practice. 

Choice here is fried rice or two kinds of noodles.  Then you have a choice of mixed vegetables, beef with veg, the fan favourite General Tao chicken (he must have fought with Montcalm in the Plains of Abraham!), Sweet n Sour pork, Honey garlic chicken and a few others. 

The price has gone up over the years and they serve on real plates with cutlery here now but expect to pay $12-$13 with two items and drink and around $14 with three items and drink taxes in.  Sill reasonable but more expensive to similar food courts.     

The food is fairly fresh as it's a very popular restaurant= high turnover.  I just feel it's jumped the shark for me.  I'll eat it infrequently however I'll let you indulge in some GT Chicken!  Peace on brother."}
{"text":"I was desperate for some rice after being on travel for 3 days and having serious rice withdraw.  

I am sorry and ashamed to say that I had to eat this crappy food.  now I know what a crackhead must feel like staring down at the pipe.  he knows it can kill him, but he cannot stop himself."}
{"text":"Meal was edible, but completely flavorless. Veggies were mushy. I'm sure that the food had been sitting on the steam table for quite a while. 

When at this service plaza, explore the other options. If they don't appeal to you, keep driving."}
{"text":"Based off the other reviews this must be a chain out in Toronto (we don't have a Manchu Wok in the US from my knowledge). But wow were we impressed to find this spot in a food court!! 

We were just browsing around looking for some possible vegan options to snack on and the lady that works immediately snatched us up and asked us if we wanted to try anything. We told her that we were vegan and she said that they had many vegan options. 

Apparently they use rice noodles (instead of egg) so we were able to order chow mein, string bean mix, eggplant in soy, tofu, and vegetable rolls. All of which were pretty good, nothing to make you run right over and try. But if your in the mall and want some tasty greasy Chinese food give this spot a try. 

Also, the lady was very sweet, she told us all the ingredients, let us taste the food, and she gave us extra \"sides\" so that we can try all the options that were vegan."}
{"text":"See the picture for this place? My plate was almost exactly the same. Those stuff were just alright - very generic Chinese-American fast food glop. Honestly, if you eat here, you can't really expect more than that, can you? Not even in the 21st century. Or the 22nd. Or the 23rd.

But that being said - those green beans were tasteless and the worst of the lot on that plate. And they make sure to give you a lot of those.

Fail."}
{"text":"Stopped my Manchu Wok for the first time.  Absolutely the worse Chinese food I have every eaten in 56 years.

The black pepper chicken did not have any meat in it whatsoever.  It consisted of big sticks of celery and mushrooms.  Portion size was not small but VERY SMALL.  Entries were 1 ounce with about 4 ounces of fried rice.

The mixed vegetables were  like the black peppered chicken.  It contained 80% celery sticks. 

All food was so greasy that the entire bottom container of each entr√©e and fried rice was covered with oil when I finished the meal (if you call it a meal).

They use heavily saturated oils so you actually will make a healthier choice by sticking with the burger and fries.

I paid $7 for celery sticks and greasy fried rice.  Hopefully this company will go bankrupt and save a lot of people from getting food poisoning."}
{"text":"I was in a rush for a meal and foolishly chose this terrible place. One would rather eat cat scat and turd than eat food from this place. Avoid Manchu wok!"}
{"text":"Not the best place to eat but they do make pretty good green beans! Do be careful as well because their food gives you the runs!"}
{"text":"Rotten food!!!! Why waste my time with giving a rewrite because we all know it's not good but sometimes the kids crave noodles. I took one bite of the pork and knew it was rotten. I notified the staff and they didn't do anything about it."}
{"text":"I spent 14~ dollars for a two entry plate. I WISH I took a photo. My orange chicken portion was swimming in some dark orange cat of grease and sauce. My sweet and sour chicken had a chew that could only be matched by a gummy bear. I gagged twice before I just tossed my meal in the trash, mind you I was starving as well. 

This place has got to be a complete joke, i should have asked for my money back"}
{"text":"OK... as a true Yelper & food snob, & don't even like eating at restaurants rated 3.5 stars and below. Much to my horror, I checked the reviews on this place after I had eaten there & saw 1.5 stars! 

I was staying at the Monte Carlo, it was late at night, everything else was closed, & I was so exhausted from the day that I did not want to leave the hotel again. As a vegetarian i do not eat McDonald's, & I had already eaten pizza 3 days in a row, so all that was left was Manchu Wok. I am no stranger to mall quality Chinese... but, wow.

They do not have vegetarian entrees, & ran out of vegetables and would not cook more even though they would be open for a couple more hours. The other food that was not an option looked hard and dry. Obviously, they cook just one big batch of food in the morning and let it sit all day and night. 

I ended up getting just a side carton of half fried rice half chow mein. It was a tiny box for $6! Well I guess good thing because I wouldn't have wanted any more. It was tasteless, and had no other ingredients besides rice or egg noodles. No added veggies or egg or anything. It was only palatable with the insane amount of Sriracha I dumped in the box."}
{"text":"I often go to Bourbon St Grill when I'm at the food court, but after hearing about someone finding a maggot in their food I decided to try Manchu Wok instead. Big mistake. I ordered the special: 2 item combo with rice or noodles for $8.99. Got the udon noodle with stirfried vegetables and garlic chicken. You normally can't go wrong with udon, but these tasted awful, like day-old food, too dry, and flavourless. I could barely eat any and my child also spat it out. The vegetables were over cooked and mushy. The garlic chicken was...almost not present. You get about 25% (or less) chicken meat with 75% batter with most of the pieces, and sometimes 50% meat with 50% batter. That's a lot of skill to make such small pieces of meat look so much bigger. 

Overall, I was highly unsatisfied and wish I had just gone to the other fast food joint where they provide way better tasting food and adequate portions."}
{"text":"I got the Orange chicken and brown rice, the chicken was hard and the rice was drenched in oil or butter....I didn't even get a full serving of Orange chicken. Don't eat here!"}
{"text":"The lady basically started removing rice from my tray when I told her it was for my son .... then I had to say for both of us. Like regardless if the food is for an adult or child, shouldn't it be consistent? Don't go here. The wings are full of batter and nasty fried rice needs more seasoning"}
{"text":"This is a basic Chinese food court restaurant.   The item selection is pretty limited to a handful of meats and about the same amount of sides to choose from.  The pricing was average and serving sizes were good. 

The best part of this place is the general Taos chicken and the friendly service behind the counter.   They were quick, helpful and polite which is why I will come back more than the food.  

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Just say no!  Keep walking. This is by far one of the worst meals I have ever tasted!  Not only is the food horrible, but the service matched. 

The rice was not just undercooked, I would call it barely cooked. The sweet & sour chicken tasted like chewing a dirty old shoe. I mean, how do you mess up sweet & sour chicken???

To top it off - she rang the order up wrong and gave my friend the wrong meal. When he went back to get the correct order, she dumped it on top of the wrong order. Unbelievable. 

Again - if you think this is your best option, I urge you, please think again. This place needs to go away"}
{"text":"Amazing gourmet food at awesome prices. The Wok Express is enough to make your tummy satisfied. It's also affordable at $6.49. It's not the best, but it's good enough for a date."}
{"text":"Food is pretty good if s little dry at times. 
Have had no issues apart from the occasional burnt rice or noodles but the Yorkdale location is another story .
Bad enough they charge you $1 extra to add shrimp as part of your order but then when you goto pay there's a big (for me anyway) gotcha. Try asking for Any condiments and you'll see that THEY CHARGE FOR EVERYTHING !!!
Soy sauce ? $.05 per packet. Hot sauce ? Ditto. 
What a joke !!!!!
DO NOT GIVE THIS PLACE YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY !!!!"}
{"text":"I was going to give these guys a 2-star review but they're currently closed for renovations so I'll give them the benefit of the doubt that they realized things suck and they're doing something to fix it.

The selection here is ok. I've never been here when the food is fresh. It always seems to have been sitting for a couple of hours.

The staff are good and quick, friendly for the most part.

We'll see what happens after the reno. I'll update my review accordingly.

{"text":"This location seems to be a little nicer and cleaner than most. It looks like it's either a new location or that it's had a makeover recently. The great thing about this location is that because it's in a busy office building food court the food is fresh during the lunch rush. You can see the staff furiously cooking in the back to keep up with the demand. There's none of that mall food court suspicion as to how long the food has been sitting there."}
{"text":"Zero star if I could! Fried rice is one of the easiest one to cook if you open a Chinese restaurant. This fried rice here tasted like steam rice, absolutely no flavor!"}
{"text":"Go anywhere else to eat!!!!

I came here during a lay over at the Charlotte Airport.  As soon as I sat down and opened the container, I regretted it.  The food just looks overprocessed and gross.

I ordered the Kung Pao chicken and rice.  They didn't even have regular white rice, only fried.  Way too heavy of a meal when you're about to sit on another airplane for another 4 hours.

The food was absolutely disgusting.  I took 2 bites and threw it away.  I can't believe I wasted $10 on this crap.  

I then walked over to BK for a $1.75 cheeseburger that tasted like it came from a 5 star restaurant compared to this dump."}
{"text":"This particular location is in Monte Carlo Hotel
Running on only two hours of sleep and looking down the barrel of a full day by the pool drinking beers, somehow this seemed like a good idea.  Girlfriend and I ordered:
a ONE menu item plate. (for me)
a rice and noodle ONLY plate. (for vegi girlfriend)
two waters and two Soda's
IT CAME TO.......................... $27.00  

Are you people insane?  I get its Vegas but damn, I almost Sh@t myself.

No flavor, and average as the day is long with Restaurant style pricing.  If i was starving to death and found one in the desert,  I keep walking and look for a McDonalds or a soup kitchen or a dead animal  anything but Manchu WOK.  

Manchu WOK, enjoy my $27.00, im getting my enjoyment now wrighting about your dump instead of when I ate that mess you serve up."}
{"text":"Well you shouldn't really expect too much from airport Chinese food, honestly. It will be expensive, it will be filled with grease, and you have to be really careful with picking what to eat because most of the food available will not taste good.
I got fried rice, mixed vegetables and green beans. The fried rice was bland, the veggies were edible, but I thought that the green beans tasted quite decent. Granted I love green beans, it's really hard to mess them up, and I hadn't eaten anything for over 10 hours and I was starving. Ended up paying a little over $8 for all of this. 
I didn't think it was too too bad as I didn't have high expectations in the first place, but I wish I had read the yelp reviews beforehand; I'd have gone too BK or chilli's."}
{"text":"This place doesn't deserve any stars. Worst food ever don't waste your time or money or calories"}
{"text":"Wins 2 awards. Worst Chinese food in an airport, anywhere.  I feel sorry for the trash  can I through food into."}
{"text":"absolutely vile disgusting, not dog worthy crap.
id rather eat my own puke re-regurgitated (and yes thats what i meant lol) nothing could have saved that food.

everything that could be wrong with it was.
first the basics, the portion was over priced and small
the container was something that should be used to bring home, not to eat out of
lastly, the place didnt look all that clean, but wrote that off as it just being the strip and vegas.

now the bulk....
the smell was off
it looked gross
the chicken was chewy and crunchy?
and just the most vile thing in the world- the sauce was just
I-C-K
i cant even think about it anymore"}
