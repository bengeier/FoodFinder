{"text":"Worse. Place. EVER. 
Still sitting here at the restaurant, have been here since 730pm (it's 945pm right now), all our food have still  not come out from the kitchen. I have two seniors sitting at the table with white rice and a plate of veggies and mortified that the table behind us came in much later than us, got all their food before us. 

When you ask, not the employee but the manager about what's taking so long, he brushes us away and said \"it's cooking\". What. The. Hell. 

Fine, I give it that it's the day before mother's day. But damn, that no excuse making customers sit at their table waiting 2 hours for their food. This is so ridiculous."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch on a weekend and ordered from the lunch specials menu.  $5.99 for approximately 20 lunch items.  The specials consists of rice/noodles with some sort of protein with sauce on top.  If you are looking a carb filler/calories for cheap then by all means go here.  If you are looking for something that does not taste like just MSG on rice, I would highly suggest going somewhere else."}
{"text":"Would have rated 4 stars for decent food if not for the TERRIBLE management and service. This place falsely advertised and blatantly lied to us...BEWARE! The waitress pushed hard for us to try a six-dish Northern-Chinese style appetizer platter, of which she emphasized over and OVER as cheap for the amount of food we get! Just $11.99! It was also written in BLACK AND WHITE as so on a menu insert. She told us that the table across from us also ordered it earlier, making it sound like a popular option! Because it was $11.99, it sounded like a good deal, and we decided to order it to try. 

When the waitress left us the bill, we were surprised that it was listed as $16.99. We called the waitress back, and asked her about it. She said it's actually $16.99. It's written wrong on the menu insert. She responded rudely with no apology whatsoever. They did not honour the advertised $11.99 that she had kept telling us, even though it was their mistake...While we paid a few dollars more at $16.99, we couldn't help but feel scammed by their tactics!!!

One would think that since the menu is not new, the menu insert would've been easily reprinted by now if it was a mistake, or how hard is it to cross out (or white out) and write $16.99 instead? I see that all the time at other restaurants if they need to change the price.

If it was an honest mistake, the waitress would've told us the moment she found out, or mentioned it when she left the bill. But she left us to discover the price change on the bill ourselves and had to call her over, and they did not apologize or give us the original advertised price. No integrity at all. 

Also, the wall by the fish tank is covered in a thick layer of green slime and mould. This is a health concern and does not look like it's been cleaned off in a long time. Our table was right under it. Makes me wonder how clean the kitchen would be...

As I said the food is decent. The Chef Special, Dried Shrimps Sticky Rice with Stir Fried Lobster was on point! The sticky rice soaked up the lobster juices and was flavourful. Their steamed minced pork (????) was also well done. As were their chinese herbal soups...

However, the satisfactory food was not enough to overcome the poor service and being scammed on our bill, which left us with a lingering taste of bitter disatisfaction.

Visit at your own risk."}
{"text":"Steam House is a sister company of Steam Kitchen on Highway 7.  It is more nicely decorated and larger.  However the service is poor.  Our plate is full of bones and sauces and even asking for them to be replaced, there is no action.  The waiters and waitresses are hard to locate.  We have the Chinese birthday buns ordered but up to the point of asking the bill, the buns are not served.  We have to repeatedly ask for them before they are served.  We have to eat fast as the contractors are opening up the ceiling covers and start to do their works.  It is such a dusty environment.   Come on!  The customers are still eating and within 10 feet is the construction site.

When the karaoke starts from the VIP room, the door is not shut and the whole restaurant is entertained by the lousy singers.

The VIP card from Steam Kitchen can be used in Steam House.  Their record keeping is separate, so don't expect to find your card information if you didn't bring it.

We ordered similar dishes that we used to order from Steam Kitchen.  Overall Steam Kitchen is much better in food quality and service.

We will go back to Steam Kitchen.  Bye bye Steam House."}
{"text":"Worst resteraunt I've been to in a while. The food was subpar from your average Chinese resteraunt and the service was just terrible. Me and my parents waited more than an hour for our food, and when we asked about our food the manager just brushed off our question and just told us that their \"cooking it\". The food presentation was good but the terrible service couldn't even change my rating even if the food was terrific. 

Terrible service, subpar food and expensive food. Will NEVER come again"}
{"text":"Came here for Mother's Day and it was Terrible. There was a menu with limited dishes they were serving, so not much choice at all for a special occasion like Mother's Day. Ended up ordering 7 dishes, cuz we had to order something. Food came sooo slow. We had to ask the server 5 times where are food was.  We got all 7 dishes in a 2 hour time span.  These were not extravagant dishes, sweet and sour pork, pork tenderloin, bass, steamed chicken, birds best, fried rice and e fu noodles. The dishes had no flavour at all. Was my first time there and my last. Of all Chinese restaurants, the service and quality has to be one if the worst. Maybe when they have their entire menu available, that food will taste better.  But I will never know because I would never go back nor recommend anyone to go."}
{"text":"My Chinese friend told me that this is the most legit and authentic cantonese steam seafood you could ever find in Toronto.

As a person grown up from a coastal city in southeast China with lots of exposure to local seafood, I found my friend's comment overrated.

We ordered a lobser, a Vancouver crab and a grouper (a moderately expensive oceanic fish very commonly used in Cantonese steam cooking). The lobster and crab are well made with thin rice noodle, but the garouper taste a little bit fishy.

If you are an expert in Cantonese steam cooking, you will understand that steaming grouper is an art. The timing is essential so that the meat will not taste too old or too raw. The cutting and placement of seasoning and fish sauce have to be carefully made to eliminate the fishy smell and taste. Overall, the grouper's meat taste tender but they failed to eliminate the very tiny bit of fishy taste that an expert (or picky) customer will find unpleasant.

In addition, the service is quite awful. It takes long time for a server to attend their customers. The waiters are not very careful as well and  they keep spilling soup while carrying the dish on to our table.

In conclusion, a good place to try out but don't expect authentic Cantonese style steam sea food or any good service."}
{"text":"The steamed rice took a bit long (so order that first wHile thinking about what else to order) but the rest was great! Service was good and there is something about the soy sauce that makes the rice amazing!"}
{"text":"3.5-4

Came here with my parents for dinner. Despite bad reviews it wasn't awful. I thought it was pretty ok although it is a bit expensive. Coming from Mississauga, we don't get food like this often so we didn't mind paying a little extra for it. 

We ordered three dishes, Stir Fried and Milky Egg with Shrimp and Scallop Topped with Fish Roe, Deep Fried Pork Ribs in an Orange Marmalade Sauce and Steamed Shrimp Fried Rice in Lotus Leaves. Each dish averaged about $15 each.

The first dish seemed small at first but going through it with the other dishes there was quite a bit. The egg whites were fluffy and I guess there was enough shrimp and scallop, the pieces could have been a bit bigger. The broccoli was a bit bitter. The second dish was alright as well. The pork wasn't fatty but because it was leaner, the meat was a little tougher. Sauce was alright, I don't care for orange marmalade. The last dish took a while to come probably because it was steamed. The shrimps were cut in half and topped with egg whites. The fried rice was infused with a shrimp aroma which made it not your typical fried rice. The fried rice had egg and raw green onions. For dessert!!! They gave us Sesame Paste filled Glutinous Rice Balls in a Ginger sauce/soup. Anything that is not red bean soup is good enough for me. But the filling was lacking honestly, they skimped out on the best part. 

Service was average. Servers spoke Mandarin and a little Cantonese. We noticed that when they gave us soup, they didn't scoop it for us but the guy scooped it for a table of young women. Just saying."}
{"text":"This restaurant is really good. The service was great and he food was very tasty. Fresh seafood and the portions are large. I really enjoyed this place."}
{"text":"Steam House, Steam Kitchen, Steam Patio...might as well offer more steamed dishes if they wanna call themselves Steam whatever. Either way they opened a second branch in Scarborough that's somewhat closer to where I live, so I figure I give it a shot.

The layout of this restaurant is infinite times better than Steam Kitchen. There's a lot more room to walk around, it's wheelchair accessible, and it's overall more spacious. I do find that small seating area to the left of the reception area a little awkward as you're secluded from the rest of the restaurant.

I ordered the usual stuff I order from Steam Kitchen: Kung pao pork, squid with chicken, bitter melon with beef, and two other dishes which I didn't end up having. The pork was probably the best out of the food we ordered, as it was only lightly breaded and not too heavy on the sauce, but still tasted very good. The bitter melon with beef had a disproportionate bitter melon to beef ratio, with way too much beef and way too little bitter melon. The beef and bitter melon were both quite decent though. Finally, the squid with chicken had too much oil; you can really feel the MSG in your mouth as you consume that dish.

The starter soup was quite good as well as the dessert (sesame balls). Service was okay in general, however they skipped out on one of our orders and simply shrugged it off. Lucky we ordered too many items to start so the missed item wasn't a huge issue.

{"text":"I think this location was very not that great, the one at hwy7 was better. I went to both locations and it was just not the same experience. We ordered the same shellfish soup from hwy7 but I couldn't find any shellfish meat at the bottom of the soup in this location at all. Also the steamed chicken with Chinese mushroom was not worth ordering because it's all bones. Maybe they used the Chinese running chicken (known to have no meat compared to the Western chicken) but all we had inside the pot was just the bones from legs and other non meaty parts. Also, they didn't mix the salt and starch well enough, all the taste was on one side of the pot. It feels like they were in a hurry and just put the taste after the chicken and mushroom were in the pot. I wouldn't recommend this location to my friends at all. Maybe the one at hwy7."}
{"text":"Came here last Sunday for an early lunch. We were the third table there and we ordered two steamed rice dishes. We ordered the beef 'patty' with pickled veggies on rice and the pumpkin and spareribs with rice. It was a long wait, 30 minutes for the beef 'patty' and 40 minutes for the spareribs with pumpkin. 

The beef with veggies was bland, very very bland, I doubt they even put a grain of salt in the beef. So we tried to add more soy sauce hoping to give it more flavor, but the soy sauce was just salty without any umami flavor or taste. I can't even taste the pickled veggies which imo defeats the purpose of even listing it on the menu. 

Now the spareribs and pumpkin rice dish was much much better. There's a lot of pumpkins which added good flavor and a touch of sweetness. The spareribs were tender and had good flavor. I didn't even add much soy sauce to this dish. 

The lunch menu comes with a free drink and I ordered the cold milk tea (for an extra $1 or something) and it was pretty good. It had good tea flavor and it wasn't too sweet or too 'milky'.

Service is pretty standard, no complaints. 

I would probably return to try their soup and other menu options."}
{"text":"I have only tried the steamed lobster, it's tasty but pricy. May come back and order the same dishes again."}
{"text":"Lunch Specials all for $5.99 with over 18 items to choose from!! I am IN! 

Steam House serves lunch from 10:30 am - 5:00 pm, and great for people like me that eat lunch whenever. 

Steamed Chicken with Fungus and Mushroom ($5.99) is a healthy option but the wait time is 15 minute, just make sure not to order if you in a rush. 

Dinner option considers of a la carte or set menu combo. If you believe that Chinese Herbal soups have health benefit, you will find a few to choose from here. 

I will be here for lunch specials for sure... My type of place!"}
{"text":"Steam House really feels like wasted potential. It has cheap, generally tasty food on the one hand, but terribly slow service on the other. Their stir fried vermicelli and baked rice entrées are consistently good and sufficiently portioned. All of them available for $10 out-the-door. 

To capitalize though, you will have to wait 10 minutes for someone to notice you at the entrance, and lose your limbs trying to flag down waitresses at any point after that."}
