{"text":"I love the food selection! I can always try something different every time I come here. Such a variety of coffee drinks, too--ask for their coffee menu and they might even give you a quick lesson on the differences between each type of drink. Very friendly staff and a nice, comfortable place to relax."}
{"text":"It's gone folks. Phone dont answer and website is gone. In its place you can find a place called Brooklyn bistro and saddest part is its work hours now are 10 to 4 pm ! Most likely designed for older generation"}
{"text":"Funnel Cakes! I love funnel cakes... the most exciting thing for me to go Wonderland is NOT their rides... is the excuse for me to eat my funnel cake! 

Augusto 33 got me excited when I saw on their website that they offers funnel cake and waffles on Sundays.... ONLY.... sounded like something special?! 

Funnel Cake ($6.99) was dried and overcooked.... I am not sure because it is gluten free or if it is regular.... meh........ Luckily my Cappuccino ($2.75) was A-OK.

Augusto 33 also has freshly baked sweets, breads and other hot sandwiches.... I might come back for a coffee or a drink on their patio, but I don't think I will be back for funnel cake!"}
