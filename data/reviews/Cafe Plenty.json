{"text":"Great place for a dry sandwich.  Asked for whole wheat, saw staff prepare sandwich with white bread, and then proceeded to lie to my face when I asked if it was whole wheat. There's a better spot north on Yonge"}
{"text":"What's amazing about this place is not just the great food but the friendly staff. I work around the corner from this little gem of a spot and will go in every morning to get my coffee and not very long after I started going the employees knew my order. I highly recommend their house made smoked salmon sandwiches with cappers. Great combo!"}
{"text":"First time visit. Was pulled in by the clean, white lines and open windows.

Salads were amazing!!!!"}
{"text":"Exceptional coffee, mediocre and underwhelming service that does not match the grandeur of the decor.  Perhaps it's nitpicking, but the concept of a cafe running out of 2% is jarring.  Esp for a cafe in the gallery district."}
{"text":"Like their no-decoration white coffee cups. And their small coffee is really a small size, which is good for me. Also enjoy the modern design inside."}
{"text":"I love the coffee here and the food is always fresh with fun high quality ingredients.  I really love the salads fresh and flavourful a real bonus to the area.  Staff is really nice and will happily chat about the food with you."}
{"text":"Small place with limited seating, good service. 
Their paninis, for $10, are a bit dry, but the portion size is huge, with a good amount of ingredient filling. I also got one their bread pudding, which was yummy. Not much seating inside, will be crowded during lunch hour."}
{"text":"I visited here a few weeks ago while I was Christmas shopping. This place pulled me in with the clean decor and crisp colour scheme. What was eye catching was the menu which was written on mirrors. I bought a club sandwich and a Pellegrino soda which honestly I thought were both overpriced. I had originally wanted to see if they had soup because it was a really cold day and I was craving the warmth but they had sadly run out shortly before I stepped in. However, the two people working behind the counter were very friendly and good-looking which was a good distraction from the $13+ I spent on my sandwich and pop. 
The sandwich was average but came with a green salad with an amazing vinaigrette. They toasted the sandwich before putting it in a nice white box with the salad so that you could take it away but I sat down at one of the long tables on a bar stool. Since it was winter, I kind of wished that the seat had a back or that there were hooks somewhere for me to hang my bulky winter jacket and purse. Other people resorted to putting their coats on the floor. 
I have to say that this place would be great for the office people working along University as it's pretty quiet and nice to be in as well as healthy as they offer a lot of fancy sandwiches. But with my student budget I don't think I can afford to come here again."}
{"text":"Sandwiches here are the best ones in the financial core. I've walked by this place so many times before and have always been off put by the prices of their sandwiches ($10 including a spring mix with balsamic dressing), however today I was craving something fancy so I decided to give it a shot and I'm very glad I did. 

I had my eyes set on the roast beef sandwich but then I spotted the turkey sandwich with cranberry sauce. The BEST turkey sandwich ever. Hands down beats Brick Street Bakery's Thanksgiving sandwich any day. They grilled it first open faced on the grill to head it up, then as a panini. The turkey was oh so moist, very surprising especially considering how easily it is to overcook turkey. The cranberry sauce was divine. None of the sugary sweet artificial cranberry stuff, this was just the right tartness with a slight hint of ginger

I upgraded to the fancy salad for $3 instead of the regular spring mix salad. Got the kale, pumpkin seed, cranberry salad with pickled carrot and radish. It was a bit acidic for my taste but I quite liked the balance of salad with the sandwich. 

It was quite expensive, it totalled to almost $15 after taxes for the sandwich and salad but for the quality you are getting, it's worth it. I'm very glad I decided to try this place out for lunch.

Baked goods are sub par. I got the croissant on another occasion and wasn't very impressed. It was super dry and not flaky or airy nor was it particularly tasty. Not worth the $2+ for the croissant. I had a taste of the brownie and didn't like it. I like my brownies super chocolaty but this tasted like lots of icing sugar and not lots of cocoa. Probably won't be back for the baked goods but will be back for lunches!!!!"}
{"text":"Bought a pemeal breakfast sandwich here. Looked good through the glass, read the ingredients: pemeal, cheddar, egg. 
Server was super friendly!
Started eating my sandwich and realized it tasted funky.  Looked closer an realize there was some kind of sauce also on the sand which. Asked the server and she told me it was a Dijon.  
Never would have ordered the sandwich if that ingredient had been listed, told that to the server who was polite and said tea he would tell the chefs. 
I wanted a refund since I had eaten maybe a quarter of it, but she didn't offer and I didn't want to start haggling. 
Overall, friendly service but disappointing wast of money since I threw that out and will buy something elsewhere."}
{"text":"What a great spot to grab a sandwich, salad or coffee.  There are a few tables and chairs to eat in, or you can carry your lunch out.   The staff are so incredibly friendly and welcoming. 

All sandwiches can be warmed up on a panini press.  Salads are unique combinations (quinoa, bulger etc.) of ingredients and are freshly made daily. The homemade soup is also delicious - I had the mushroom (not cream based) and it was great!  

There are an appealing variety of desserts that I have not tried yet (including an apple crumble).  They all look like they would be delicious treats!  I have gone back several times and will continue to go back to this spot for a quick lunch."}
{"text":"Cafe plenty has what I will call the \"best damn espresso in Toronto\".   I have looked forever for a decent espresso.  None of the big chains should even be selling what they pass off as \"espresso\"  The only alternatives for a decent cup is relegated to some Italian restaurants throughout the city that only open for dinner.  Or hop on a flight to Italy

Their espresso has a delicious finish of cocoa with a slight bitterness.  In terms of a pure coffee place, their espresso wins hands down.   I will not go to any other chain or independent coffee shop if I can help it. 

The staff is amongst the friendliest I've ever seen in Toronto.  And that is saying a lot.  The food is healthy, delicious and unique.  Stout cupcakes anyone?  :) The bright white European decor is simple, stylish and spotless."}
{"text":"Planned my day around coming in and working in this nice looking coffee shop that seemed to just have opened, only to be confronted by rude staff who won't give out the password to the internet. What is going on here? Espresso IS good, will admit that, but no espresso is good enough to keep me coming back to somewhere cheap with their internet! Food was mediocre at best

UPDATE:

The manager personally came to address this concern after reading this review I guess to resolve my concerns - great to see a responsive and proactive approach to dealing with customer concerns"}
{"text":"Been here a few times for lunch, their salads are delicious! Very filling and pretty healthy (I'm hoping!) 

They start running out of sandwiches and salad options shortly after 1pm so get there early!"}
{"text":"Was at this place abt 10 mins ago. Purchased yogurt with granola and earl gray tea. Place looks nice and clean. Passed by here many times. Yogurt was good, but the cup was only half full.  The amount could have been more given the price of $4 and change.  Wont be going due to lack of friendly service. Girl on the counter just handed me my stuff, didnt even say thank u or anything. Didnt even ask if I wanted my receipt as I paid by debit. I was the only person there, ive worked in cust service for so long and it doesnt take a lot to say thank u. Clearly, not going back as Starbucks across the st has better service."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to any Cafe Plenty location. 

The prices were fair with good sized portions and tasty sandwiches and salads. Don't come here if you expect hot meals! I got three variety of salads for $10.00.

The decor is bright and refreshing and really welcomes you. Location wise it's not connected to the path but you can still get to it with only walking outside for less than 1 minute. 

The service was friendly and helpful and they really made sure that we were taken care of. 

Good afternoon coffee date spot or place to get a quick lunch!"}
{"text":"Cafe Plenty recently opened in a very well renovated space.  The white subway tiles covering the floor and walls make it such a cute place to walk into. 
The menu consists of salads, sandwiches which can be heated up on a panini press and cafe style pastries and coffees.  The Americano was delicious and the double had me bolted awake all morning.  The salad selections are unique and totally worth trying. The prices weren't all posted yet, when I visited. But, I imagine you'll get your fill for right around $10.  The comparison with Avenue Cafe right around the corner cannot be missed. But, sadly Cafe Plenty doesn't have seating, apart from a few stools along the wall.  I do hope they will survive in this location which has turned over so many times.  
The staff were all super friendly and started my day off right."}
{"text":"My first time at cafe plenty I wasn't disappointed! Cute decor and seating area (although not much). The sandwiches and special salads were unique which was refreshing. I ending up getting the turkey with brie and a sweet potato and chick pea salad which was all very tasty! They heat up the sandwich for you so it was nice and hot. Everything was $14 which I thought was a little pricey but the portion size was pretty good so that made up for it. The staff was very friendly and I would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"I went here for the almond milk late a few times and have always had a pretty tasty drink and good service. The place itself is nice and sort of charming. Prices are average  overall a good place for a quick bite or a coffee. You can have both since they serve lots of salad and sandwich options."}
{"text":"Delicious lunch option that is quietly tucked away, serving excellent quality in a fresh and clean environment.  I've enjoyed the tuna sandwich which was the best tuna sandwich I've ever eaten -- I can't describe it but \"tuna heaven sandwich\" would be a better name.  The roast beef sandwich was also great -- tender, juicy and flavourful.  The salads that accompany the sandwiches are perfectly dressed with a light vinaigrette."}
{"text":"I give this place a 3.5/5.

I came to this place sometimes since it's so close to work.

They have some great sandwiches and salads to choose from. I like the chicken club sandwich, and their house salad dressing is amazing. They add a bit of mint and balsamic vinaigrette and it is delicious. They usually have a couple of choices of sandwiches, and salads.

I've had the vanilla latte's here and they are delicious!

There coffee is a bit bitter for my taste, but if you like the darker roasts then you would love the coffee here.

The staff here are pretty friendly. 

The place small, but the white decor makes the cafe feel open and there is a cool modern sculpture running along the left wall. 

If you are looking for a new lunch place, coffee, sweet snack, a sandwich, you should check this place out."}
{"text":"It's true that this place is way overpriced, but the food is good. I had the pulled pork jerk sandwich with a salad. Interesting spices and pretty delicious. I hope the owner reads these reviews and sees the common trend here...too expensive. I work upstairs from the cafe and in a year, I have only been twice. Both times it's like battling good and evil in my head...go ahead and spend $13 on lunch today...no! Are you stupid?! You can buy TWO lunches for that price...but it won't be as tasty...but I just paid $14 for parking. And this is precisely the reason why it's reserved for when I feel like treating myself."}
{"text":"This is a great addition to lunch and breakfast options in the neighborhood.  The pricing on par with similar places nearby (Avenue cafe, for example).  The service is friendly, the decor/atmosphere are crisp and clean, and the food is always delicious.  It's awesome that the grilled paninis all come with a bonus balsamic greens side salad  to make a complete lunch.  The carrot cake dessert is amazing and the grain salads are great too.  We have an office in the building  above.  They've done catering for  several of our events and it's always a hit!"}
{"text":"Cafe Plenty has the best Latte in the city. 

My list:

1) Cafe Plenty
2) Little Nicky
3) Jimmy's  

The price is what is to be expected for a coffee in Toronto, $4. The service is great and the ladies that work there are always friendly.

The breakfast food is awesome. If Tim Horton's is the Toyota of  egg, cheese and bacon breakfast sandwiches then this place is Lexus. 

The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is because of the value. I feel the price is slightly too high for what you get. That being said, I still go there as often as I can because the difference in quality compared to everything else in the neighbourhood is significant."}
{"text":"Just visited this Cafe for the first time. I ordered the roast beef sandwich which came with a mixed green salad for roughly $10.00.

Both the sandwich and the salad were delicious and I would consider visiting again.

Cafe Plenty is pricey and compared to other sandwich shops which for roughly the same price allow you to make your own sandwich, Cafe Plenty does not. 

Regardless, I wouldn't change a thing about the sandwich or salad, they truely were enjoyable."}
{"text":"The espresso and cappuccinos are great but the food is a little pricey and their portions are on the lean side. However, the breakfast sandwich is amazing. It's $6.00 but completely worth it once in a while. The atmosphere is quaint and modern at the same time. All in all, go there for un café but not for un déjeuner."}
{"text":"A cute bakery that also serves meals, I'd recommend coming here. I love their interior design, and their coffee was great quality. It's pricey compared to the Timmy's close by but you do get that nice 'upper scale cafe' feel with this place."}
{"text":"Stopped by to grab lunch to go but unfortunately they were already sold out of their vegetarian sandwich. I opted for the soup instead, a tomato bisque, and it was pretty disappointing. The consistency was good but it was so overwhelmingly sour that all other flavours were drowned out and it was honestly hard to finish - not worth the $6.75 that I paid for it.

I saw that they had some salads and pastries on display as well but none of them looked particularly appealing. I sampled their fruit square and it was only okay, nothing special. 

This place seemed like a cute little cafe where you could get a fresh and tasty meal on the go, however my first experience here would prove otherwise. You could probably get better food and pastries at the Starbucks across the street."}
{"text":"Stepped into this very tiny counter cafe because I was in a rush to eat and get to another appointment.  
It was 12:00 noon with one other person at the counter.  
I was greeted in a very friendly manner as I looked at the very fresh looking sandwich choices.  Quite a few choices with turkey and brie, roasted pork etc.  All with white or whole wheat buns.  Tough decision but chose the roast beef because it looked like my Mum's roast beef sliced nice and thick. They paired the roast beef with gorgonzola,  caramelized onions and watercress.  The sandwich was grilled to perfection and was delicious.  Came with greens but I opted for a fancier salad for an extra $3.00.  They had a choice of pasta and other unique choices.  I decided on barley with feta, baby peas and mint.  Beautiful flavors .
All was put into a cardboard take-out box so was very easy to eat on the subway.
Will certainly return to try the other sandwiches."}
{"text":"There are better places to grab a coffee and croissant in the Financial District/Downtown Core. Located on the southeast corner of Yonge and King, Café Plenty gains points for both super friendly service and the very charming ambiance (great setup and décor). In the mornings, there's a decent amount of pastry varieties available (muffins, croissants, cookies, biscotti), and their drinks menu has the usual options (drip coffee - light or dark roasts available), and various types of lattes and other drink options.

Unfortunately, the positives stop there. I visited on a Friday morning around 8:30 AM, and it was relatively busy (but not as busy as other coffee shops in the area). I ordered a light roast coffee and one Pain Au Chocolat.

Sadly, the pastry was super, super dry! Also, despite being a Pain Au Chocolat, there were only very small pieces of chocolate in the actual croissant. Even worse, it was very, very dry and hard - the chocolate was almost frozen and very difficult to bite into. The coffee was average and left a bit of a sour aftertaste.

The dry pastry was definitely a disappointment (after looking forward to a pastry all morning!) - there are a ton of other options for pastries and coffee in the area, where pastries are way fresher and of better quality. For a small-sized coffee (and trust me, it's small) and a Pain Au Chocolat, I paid $5.25."}
{"text":"Good option for filling breakfast/lunch 

I've been here a few times and tried: 

1. Breakfast sandwich 

At $6 it's double the price of a breakfast sandwich at Tim Hortons or McDonald's but it is worth for the quality. This is no fast food joint for sure. Probably one of my favourite things on the menu. 

2. Smoked salmon sandwich

Again the quality is good. I love that they add capers and everything just seems fresh overall. Also a fan of this sandwich! 

3. Turkey and Brie 

So good. Highly recommend getting this for lunch and NOT upgrading the salad. The regular greens is so good, I love the dressing they use. 

Here is where my review goes downhill... their salads aren't great. I've tried the Asian slaw, and the barley and both were a big let down. They look a lot better than they tasted but maybe you will have a different opinion. Overall, for the portion and quality I think it's a decent deal."}
{"text":"They have great food but way overpriced! However since they're catering to those who have money to spend, I won't give them a bad review for that. The sandwiches are okay. They're good to try but not great enough to claim as a favourite. The best is the chicken club. The salads are okay. The Caesar one is my favourite. Soups are good although sometimes they're a tad overspiced. The sweet potato tart is a must-try! The location I go to is the original one. The owner used to be there but since opening the king location it's run by new staff currently. They're polite enough although there's now some underlying snootiness in the air especially when it comes to asking about specific prices."}
{"text":"Café Plenty is strategically located near the main intersection of Yonge & King and has high quality offerings therefore the prices are high. Prepare to be surprised by high prices.

With that said, their sandwiches are quite delicious, their drinks are all-natural and cold pressed (this last quality is likely meaningless) and the salads are impressively healthy looking/feeling and tasty.

I have to say it is too bad their seating is so limited, but come before or after the lunch rush and it is quite a tasty and refreshing feeling to have a bite here.

The cashier-cum-order taker looked like the standard-issue tattooed woman, but was actually quite polite and friendly. She does not actually prepare the food or cook so there are no worries about hepatitis.

By the way, do not look for Wi-Fi there. 
The café is quite clean."}
{"text":"I didn't want to like this place; Maybe its because I was in a grumpy mood and I didn't want Mr. Sub and Tim's across the street. 

The only negative was how long it took to put down my order, but there was only one person behind the counter so i can't fault them for this.

I will say though that they make a killer Tuna Melt and their house salad is pretty good. Prices are steeper than what I'd like but I know I'm getting quality here.

I'd say it's well worth it to try the food here. I was happy and would be happy to come here again.

Keep 'em coming!"}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings about Cafe Plenty.

I have been a patron ever since it opened up right near my work.  The food is always delicious, a bit pricey but well worth every penny.  However now that this place is getting more popular, prices have increased and containers have been down-sized.  When I order two salads the box has shrunk down about three times since I have been ordering it and not only are the containers smaller, they are being extremely STINGY with the portions.  I usually get the kale salad with the chickpea salad or orzo and the last two or three times I've ordered it I swear there were 5 pieces of kale in my box with a lot of the chickpea salad instead (why? because chickpeas are much cheaper).  It's becoming a bit frustrating because I'm paying over 8 dollars for the two salads and am still hungry after the meal.  I could spend another dollar or two and head down the street to Freshii where my salad is HUGE and filling, but I do like to support the smaller, local business but I just wish that they would stay consistent with portion size.

My 2 cents !"}
