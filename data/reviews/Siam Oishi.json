{"text":"This is a great place to get lunch if you work in the area. Tons of lunch specials for under $7. I got a meal with sushi, soup, salad, orange slices, and egg rolls. The waitress was extremely nice and helpful! I will go back soon!"}
{"text":"I should have known that this place wasn't going to be very good the second I walked in. The place smelled a little off, the miso soup tasted like dishwater, the yellowtail was old and fishy, and the beef yakisoba was way overcooked. The only good part of the meal was the waitress was nice, but the food was not good at all."}
{"text":"FOUND: delicious bubble tea in Scottsdale!  So far I've had the taro and the Thai tea flavors and both were incredible - delectable flavors, not too sweet, and loaded with tapioca beads - literally at least one in every sip, and it's a decent-sized smoothie.  That's right - they serve the tea as almost a smoothie with milk and ice.   At least I hope it's milk, and not cream or ice cream -- in this case ignorance is definitely bliss!   Whatever it is, the slightly frozen consistency is absolutely perfect and makes for a very refreshing beverage on a hot summer night.  

Okay enough gushing about the boba and onto the food.  The Thai red curry with tofu and vegetables was spicy and excellent.  I had to pay an extra buck for tofu AND vegetables, as these are separate options, but it was well worth it.  The tofu came in nice little pieces that were easy to eat with chopsticks, and it was lightly fried, which I like.  Okay so this is not health food, but it is delicious.  

I also tasted the green curry fried rice, which, according to our server, is normally two spiciness levels above the red curry, but we were able to order it toned down a bit.  The dish didn't look too appetizing, to be honest.  It was pretty white so I wasn't expecting much flavor, but that mild-ish green curry really delivered.  There was plenty of coconut curry flavor but not too much spice - I kept stealing a bite whenever my mouth got a little too overwhelmed by the spicy red curry!  

This is a great place for reasonably priced Thai and Japanese food, but if nothing else, stop by for a Bubble Tea Latte to go.  One star deducted for the bland ambiance, but the food has plenty of flavor!"}
{"text":"The Mediterranean place that closed down has morphed into  Siam Oishi a Japanese - Thai, the best thing I can say about it is the bikes parked outside from the Ducati shop improve the view.  

I've only had one meal here but it's not likely to get a recommendation to the people at work. I kinda hate that I kick off with a negative review  but  this isn't that cheap a place for the quality of food I received. I had lunch bento 4 chicken katsu. This comes in a plastic bento tray, salad, rice, katsu and a couple of slices of orange.

 You also get miso soup which was pretty poor and the dashi base was rather too much like a chicken stock with little flavor in the supporting ingredients . ( Zen Sushi spoils us)  

The Katsu was apparently fried more than once, with an intermediate cooling period, was really fat laden and is readily beaten at  Ono's, or to be frank any order of katsu i've had in the last, oh lifetime.  It wasn't white it was saturated with oil for that nice yellow color. 

We have too many good places  around $9 at lunch, Saigon nites,  Thai House and Indian paradise  (on a good day) to make this part of the lunch rotation."}
{"text":"Back again last night for a third time.  I love it when a restaurant can accomodate us by modifying an item.  The Grilled Chicken soup was converted to a strictly vegetarian version and the bowl was HUGE.  My wife finished it because it is favorite thing to eat.  They added tofu and changed the broth to a miso-like broth.  Mmmmmm!  It had numerous pieces of fish cake.  Great udon noodles and loaded with vegetables.  The sushi was good as always.  And Pat makes you feel like you're an old friend.  We always leave happy."}
