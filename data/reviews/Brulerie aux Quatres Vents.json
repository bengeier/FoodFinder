{"text":"This is the second time I try their latte, both were disappointing. For a place that roasts their own coffee, I expected better."}
{"text":"It's located in the Marché Jean Talon. I went there this weekend, and I enjoyed the atmosphere and the inexpensive cofee (less than 2$). I'm no coffe expert, so all I can say is that it tasted like coffee and that I prefer it to the McDonald coffee. I'll probably go there again. As a bonus, the marché Jean talon that extends around this coffee place seems filled with nice shops and restaurants."}
{"text":"I have tried so hard to like this place because of their great location in the Jean-Talon Market, but a coffee spot on the edge of Little Italy has to do a better job than this. I'm not a fan of their espresso nor of their brewed coffee nor of their beans. (I guess the last item on my list probably covers the other two, eh?)"}
{"text":"Went to the Marche Jean-Talon and was surprised to find this was one of the few stalls open at 8:30am.  Ordered a chai latte,  creme de carousel soup,  many vanilles(?),  Bagel with creme cheese and hot mocha.   The service was great and the lady helping us was patient with our questions. I was not accustomed to their method of making chai lattes in soup bowls.   However the soup was utterly fantastic. Great place to go to if you happen upon the Marche in the earlier hours of winter. Free Wi-Fi throughout the market was a bonus too. A little too much creme cheese in my bagel, but that can be easily adjusted yourself."}
{"text":"After a good read through of the reviews, either I know hill of beans about great coffee or I shell out 4 stars too offhandedly.   I had a double Americano. I thought it tasted appropriately. There was a nice layer of crema atop. The barista had great hair and their to go cups are a bright cheerful red!  I don't know, if your understanding of coffee is average and your daily brew is at Tim's, well this is a step up!"}
{"text":"Indeed I am remiss in not having posted a review sooner for this little gem at the marché Jean-Talon. My husband and I function solely on the coffee from Brûlerie Aux Quatre Vents. BAQV, as the name suggests, roast their coffee to perfection themselves. We buy the whole bean coffee in the 1 kilo bags and religiously drink it every morning. Once or twice a week, however, I like to treat myself to a café au lait and a biscotti and sit at one of the many tables with my daughter and (although it is against the market's rules) my dog and watch all of the market activity. My daughter and my dog Vendredi are equally welcomed by the delightful employees at BAQV. Once during one of our morning coffee breaks, we were actually in the right place at the right time and I and my little entourage were filmed by the film crew from ''Des Kiwis et Des Hommes''. However, don't misunderstand, I don't go here in the hopes of becoming famous on Radio-Canada. I come here because the coffee is amazing and the prices for whole bean coffee are less than those at the Metro grocery store and oh so much lovelier!"}
{"text":"Cold hard pastel de nata from the fridge. Taste wise it was fine. But cold and hard pastries is not my thing.  You be the judge is that what you want."}
{"text":"My tea was served in a mug used for coffee. Coffee was all I could taste.  Dissapointing.  Would I return? Unlikely. Would I recommend?  It's a decent choice for the area. Hubby said his coffee was ok.  Maybe."}
{"text":"I come here because of the fabulous Laura R, so tip of the hat and symbolic FTR to her. This has become one of my regular spots in the market, it's tucked right in the warm belly of Jean Talon and there are always bags of beans spilling and roasting, and friendly trilingual staff pouring the tasty good stuff.   The real reason I'm here several times a week though is the breakfast sandwich - English muffin toasted with egg, nice local ham, and cheese for 2.75$. Gotta love breakfast for under three bucks, especially when it comes in sandwich form."}
{"text":"This café is the only obvious place to get coffee in the main Jean-Talon Market building. It occupies one of the building's busiest, most prominent spots. I can't count how many times I've passed through wanting coffee, or when one of my friends wanted (or urgently needed) some. One would hope -- no, expect -- that the only café in Montreal's flagship, destination public market, in Little Italy of all places, serves good or at least decent coffee.  This café doesn't meet this pressing, important need and it's a real shame. I second Andrea L's comments below: their drip coffee and their espresso are poor, although I had an OK hot chocolate once. Instead, make the detour to Café de la Rue, Café Vito, or one of the many options on the Little Italy strip of Saint-Laurent."}
{"text":"This review is for the little taco stand they have out front.  3 for 5.50.  The tacos themselves were just ok, your standard tortilla, shredded pork, beans, and onions.  The standout was the hot sauce.  If you're a fan of the hot stuff and want to start off exploring the market with a kick, try the tacos with a healthy serving of the hot sauce."}
{"text":"This little coffee spot is located within the Jean Talon Market place and is one of my favorite stops for a breakfast panini and Un bol de café au lait, literally a bowl of cafe au lait. They roast their own beans; serve a variety of coffees by the cup, bowl or you can purchase a bag of whole beans or have it ground for home consumption. Coffee in Quebec is like no other, very reminiscent of the wonderful coffees of Europe, you don't want to miss Brulerie Aux Quatre Vents."}
{"text":"C'est Risa qui m'a fait découvrir le fameux sandwich-déjeuner de ce petit café en plein centre du marché Jean Talon. Miam! Quoi de mieux que de commencer la journée avec un sandwich oeuf-jambon-fromage et un café pour moins de 5$? C'est assez dur à battre, et puisque c'est un petit café, c'est fait frais sur place. Pas d'oeuf précuits comme au McDo ou au Tim Hortons. Non, non! C'est un vrai de vrai sandwich-déjeuner...presque santé! Les cafés sont pas mal bon et vous pouvez  aussi en acheter en vrac pour vous en faire à la maison. Ils ont des pâtisseries qui ont toutes l'air très appétissantes, mais je n'y ai jamais goûté simplement parce que je suis vraiment obsédée par leur sandwich déjeuner!"}
