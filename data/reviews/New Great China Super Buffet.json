{"text":"Well I had lunch here today with Robyn N.,Arlin B., Scott W. and Rand H. and it was my second time here (forgot to review the first time) I know I would Have given them 4 stars on my first visit but now almost a year and a half later there are so many better places.The food here is not bad but only half as good as Hibachi only one block away. They might survive with there low price( 4.95 lunch buffet ) which gives them great value'"}
{"text":"CLOSED?!! DEAR GOD WHY???

This was my favorite buffet ever. The food was always good. The staff were always super awesome. I miss this place.. They had the best rice too.."}
{"text":"I use to do take out from this place when I lived on the west side. It was about $9 for their buffet take out and they gave you a container and basically you filled it up until you couldn't stuff it anymore, which I graciously did. I found a place on the East side that reminds me of them and the food is just as good. Plus I always had enough for leftovers for the next day. Call me greedy but hey, it is a buffet and its ok to be greedy from time to time lol."}
{"text":"Had lunch here with Rand H, Robyn N, Arlin B and Mike C.  The last time I was in the building it was a Black Eyed Pea.  

For $4.95 for lunch +beverage, including desert it's a great bargain.  Most everything I tried was pretty good but not much that really stood out.  The serving trays were small enough that none of them sat out too long before being replaced.  The plates were on the small side, I saw this as a plus because it stopped me from piling too much food on, A bigger eater might not like having to make the extra trips.  The employees were all pleasant.  The physical building is getting worn, some of the tables having a slant to them.  Two of us wished there were some small bowls on the desert island for ice cream/pudding.

$7.08 with tax for a filling lunch.  3.5 stars."}
{"text":"I attempted Lin's, to be honest, but it was inhumanely packed, had too long of a line, and was highly priced.  I went with 80% as good for 50% the price and came here.  I think I made a fine decision.

Rand is the GRand Boofay Master, and I can add very little to his well-written review.  
Everything he says about New Great China is true:

The food is pretty darned good.
The booth was uncomfortable.
It deserves to survive amidst nearly insurmountable competition.
The server was really cute."}
