{"text":"I went there for the afternoon tea with my besties. We all looked forward to it since it has not been easy for us to get the reservation there. The bar is quite vintage. The sandwiches were so enjoyable and the desserts were also very good. They also have those fancy silver cutlery sets which I can't decide whether to like that or not just because of the scratches."}
{"text":"I use the Library Bar as a great place for business meetings and after-work cocktails.  Its a bit pricey, but the drinks are very well crafted and the atmosphere is unique.  Reminiscent of old town Toronto and museum-ish empire hotel pubs, I like to think its the bar you might find Mackenzie, or Hemingway, or maybe even Brando having a drink back in the day.  It can get packed on the weekends, but thankfully you can book reservations (just don't do it online).  I've never tried the food, but I always see a lot of people eating.

Recommended:  The 'Hemingway Mojito'..."}
{"text":"Went for drinks and a light snack with friends. The atmosphere is what I'd call \"upmarket classic\" although here and there things look a bit tired rather than classic. The service was excellent and since we had a large group, service charge was already included (although this was not mentioned and we had to spot it ourselves). The food was extremely overpriced and unfortunately that set high expectations for the food. The expectations weren't met as the food was mediocre at best. At least the free drink nibbles included caramel popcorn and pretzels so I commend them for that."}
{"text":"I came here for their afternoon tea.  The Library Bar has a dark, sophisticated, almost intimidating interior but then the leopard print seats lightens the mood.  As expected there are bookshelves along the wall filled with hardcover vintage books adding to the historic feel. 

Service was excellent and my friend and I enjoyed the afternoon tea. We, as usual, left afternoon tea stuffed. 
They have 11 different teas to select from and I chose the Montebello Apple Spice.  While I'm not usually a fan of fruity tea I thought I'd give this one a shot since it's different.  It wasn't too sweet so I enjoyed it. 

We started off with mixed berries in a cocktail glass topped with a bit of whipped cream with a crumpet  with a Grand Marnier butter & honey spread on top.  I thought the Grand Marnier gave it a slight bitter taste so the honey really balanced the flavour. 

The finger sandwiches came next. This was my favourite part of the meal and I think they have the best finger sandwiches of all the afternoon tea places I've been to.  The PEI Lobster & mango salad open sandwich and the Nova Scotia smoked salmon with a wasabi creme fraiche were the stand outs. 
The lobster & mango sandwich was fresh, light and creamy.  The smoked salmon was not salty (as experienced from other places) and the wasabi gave just a slight kick to the otherwise \"normal\" smoked salmon sandwich.  There was a smoked turkey breast and Ontario Brie sandwich.  I enjoyed the brie sandwich more than I expected.  It was also topped with an  apple, strawberry & peach preserve slice which worked...I usually don't like mixing sweet & savoury.  

The pastries came next served on the tiered platter. My favourites were the fresh fruit clafouti (light & fresh) and the chocolate crunch flourless cake (really rich chocolate goodness).  The madeleines were made with honey from their rooftop garden.  The scones were served with organic cream and preserves. They were good but the Windsor Arms still wins the afternoon tea scone & cream competition (love it). 

It's $35 a person and you have upgrade to the Royal Tea Experience for an additional $25 for smoked salmon & caviar canapes that's paired with a Moet Chandon Brut Imperial Champagne."}
{"text":"Dropped in today with my mom for a quick drink before catching the GO Train home. Told our waiter that it was her birthday. He was so nice, brought us some cake pieces with a candle. When I asked for the bill, Zerd the waiter said everything was on the house! We only ordered 2 mocktails but still such a nice treat! Atmosphere and service is completely old school and top notch. Perfect end to a long day for my mom."}
{"text":"They make a fabulous dirty martini here, well worth the price. The waiter pouring it at the table makes it a bit of a spectacle -- so a nice thing to show off to guests/visiting friends. 

The only problem is that it gets so warm in this bar in the summer time - and the air conditioning does so little - that it becomes a bit uncomfortable on hot days/nights."}
{"text":"Fabulous. Great space and the bartender was very gregarious and helpful. Good drinks and good knowledge of booze. There was bar entertainment a guitarist who sang great. Comfortable atmosphere felt like a bigwig."}
{"text":"It was my first time going here, and it was great! 
The service was attentive and caring. I loved every second of it. 
The scones were amazing and so were the pastery swans. 
I would definitely go back again :D"}
{"text":"I ate here on Valentine's day.  The service was lovely, and the bartender seemed to be a really entertaining guy, if the people at the bar were any indication.

The menu was small and didn't offer anything I was particularly interested in, but I think all the food I ordered was well made.  

The creme brulee for dessert was great.  Delicious, nice crust on top, but it was HUGE (no complaints about that, even though I couldn't finish it.)

It was an OK place to eat."}
{"text":"The worst service I've ever had in my life---this is not an exaggeration. Way to make a group of girls celebrating their friend's 22nd birthday a bad experience. The manager was able to accommodate us in the end after a very rude and snarky waiter (Kurt). The tea, sandwiches and desserts were divine. Unfortunately, because the service was so bad I would not recommend this tea room to any of my friends and would be hesitant to visit the Royal York's restaurant or stay at the hotel based on how I was treated."}
{"text":"They started a new menu in October called the Royal Afternoon Tea. I believe they have a new chef who used to be a chef for the Queen herself and the menu is inspired by favourites of the royal family. Maybe this makes it more authentic, but I thought the food could have been better. The sandwiches were pretty disappointing overall, but some of the desserts were good. Some highlights and disappointments:

TEA
The have a few new tea blends for the new menu. I chose Organic Cream Earl, which was described as a creamy earl grey. It was pretty true to its description.

SANDWICHES
Potted shrimp - I enjoyed this but it was pretty heavy. Only suggestion I have is to provide more Melba toast. There was 1 piece per person but way more potted shrimp... Also the menu says it should be served with warm Melba toast so the butter would melt. Ours was cold so that didn't happen... still enjoyable though 

Coronation chicken - this sandwich was creamy and flavourful. My favourite sandwich 

Smoked Scottish salmon gravadlax with suedoise sauce - did not taste any suedoise sauce. Literally a thin piece of smoked salmon sandwiched between two pieces of bread. Disappointing.

PASTRIES
Scones - I was a little disappointed with the scones. It was the tiniest scone I'd ever seen and you only get 1 per person. It was pretty average. Not as buttery or fluffy as scones I've had elsewhere.

Battenberg cake - this was my favourite pastry. I love the marzipan that coats the cake. It's just so pretty and pink!

Vanilla bean shortbread - this tasted more like a sugar cookie than shortbread. But hey, I like sugar cookies so fine by me!

Raspberry tartlet - this was too sour for my taste and the crust was mushy. Disappointing because I typically enjoy tarts.

Chocolate biscuit cake - the chocolate was very rich. Definitely needed the tea to wash it down.

Chocolate cake? - we had 2 chocolate cakes and one doesn't seem to be on the menu so not sure what this second is. I liked this one more than the chocolate biscuit cake because it wasn't as heavy and had more \"cake\" texture to it

Service was quite slow when I went but they were nice enough to not charge us because of it. I made a reservation for noon and want served until after 1pm. Overall, I would go here once for the experience, but not again because I didn't like the food enough to pay $55 for it."}
{"text":"Review for Afternoon Tea.

Facility: Parking. First things first. Pull onto Piper St behind the Fairmont and go into the underground behind the building on the south side). We stayed for Afternoon Tea on a Saturday from 12:00 - 3:00pmish and paid $11. You'll come up the elevator to the \"MM\" level, walk towards the lobby and take another elevator down to the \"L\" level. On exiting, you'll see the clock with winding stairs, turn to the right of it and you should see the Library Bar up a small set of stairs where the washrooms are located. The Fairmont Royal York is located on Front St, just east of York. Walkable distance from Union subway station. 

The Library Bar is an opulent space with old-world elegance. The atmosphere is generally quiet, most people speaking low. It's quite intimate and romantic. Makes for wonderful photos. The hostess will offer you the coat-check before seating you.  

Food Quality & Price: Afternoon tea is priced typically for downtown upscale locations at around $50pp. All four sandwiches were absolutely delicious and we all wished there was more, rather than the large assortment of sweets on the menu. Scones were divine, warm and soft! The second level mousse cake and macarons were nice as well. But around that time, we all tapped out one by one from all the sugar and the richness. Don't get me wrong, they were great, but the accumulation was just overwhelming. Most of us could not finish the little swan pastry and the cheesecake pop was simply too sweet. Devonshire cream was fluffy and light, just the way I like it.

Service: Service at tea was wonderful. Polite, full of smiles and a full explanation of every dish. We were informed during tea that there would be a tour of the hotel at 2pm, which we accepted. The group waited for us to receive and pay our tabs before departing on a lovely tour. The tour is different each week depending on availability of certain areas in the hotel. Ours was just a simple walk around of the mezzanine level to see the big halls where events are held and a walk through the lower level kitchens. Our lovely guide, Brian, said that on other tours they go see the royal suite where the Queen stays when she's here. In other reviews, some go up to the rooftop.

Overall: A great place for afternoon tea. You're not going to get a perfect experience, but you won't be disappointed. I would return again."}
{"text":"I went to the Library Bar for an afternoon tea. I didn't think it was worth what I paid, which was $50. This happen to be the most expensive afternoon tea offering when I was looking for a place in Toronto so I expected more. The sandwiches, except for turkey were just okay, bland describe it the best, and the scones were tiny (I was serve two) and the jams were not freshly made (There were three jams and one honey in tiny jars.) and the sweets were sweets. The flourless chocholate cake was the best of the bunch but after a couple of sweets I was done. The decor and atmosphere were good I rather have good food rather decor."}
{"text":"My husband and I went there last Saturday night for my birthday for after dinner drinks. Reading the reviews and the website we were expecting a quiet and elegant ambiance. But there was a guy screaming inaudibly through a microphone singing whom no one could hear (you could tell because only 1 couple out of every one in the room clapped every time he finished). 

The wine menu was so limited: 90% of the list was 3rd rate Niagara region wines for $16 and up per glass. I asked for a Riesling thinking that would be a safe choice if ordering a wine from Niagara region but maybe the wine had been sitting out too long or something because the alcohol had evaporated and it was just an undrinkable sugar water. 

And the waitress, she was so rude, so abrupt and sharp for absolutely no reason. I guess working at a hotel she felt like the largely tourist bunch doesn't care! I asked her for a dessert menu and she was pissed off. I asked her to get me a glass of water without ice 3 times until she brought it full of ice. She didn't once ask why I hadn't drank my wine. I reiterate very rude! to be fair thought all the other wait staff seemed very pleasant and polite. 


Overall, if you are looking for an elegant quiet ambiance don;t go there. This was just another dressed up Goos N Firkin."}
{"text":"Great spot for a night cap, if a guest at the hotel or not. 

The space is great. Intimate and comfortable yet bustling. Good wine menu, adequate beer selection. Not a liquor person, but I didn't hear any complaints in our group. 

The bar nuts are a great touch, and the menu is just right. Highly recommend the cheese plate. Of course it's pricey, but well stocked and generous. 

Nice stop."}
{"text":"Great place! Not overpriced! Will come back again! It has great service, cleanliness, and friendliness. Great place to go after a long trip!"}
{"text":"Came here for a couple of drinks with a friend, and was not disappointed!

We went on a Friday night, and the maître d' was extremely attentive and polite. The place started to fill up around 9, but that did not stop their excellent service. The decor was beautiful and the atmosphere was cozy; in fact, time passed by without us realizing due to how comfortable we felt being there. Our drinks were well-crafted and delivered in a timely fashion with some sweet popcorn, and we had an enjoyable conversation over delicious cocktails. Prices are on the higher end, but that is to be expected. 

Overall had a great experience here, and would not hesitate to return for more."}
{"text":"This review is based on their martinis and cocktails. My boyfriend and I stopped here for an after dinner drink while visiting Toronto. After spending about an hour at the establishment chatting and drinking our cocktails, we left very happy with our experience!

I got the Bubbles and Berries which contained vodka, chambord, sparkling wine, and fresh berries. I'm not a vodka drinker so I asked the bartender if he could use gin instead. He was more than happy to do so. 

My drink was fantastic! Fruity and sweet, just the way I like my cocktails! It was served in a martini glass with some raspberries socked in champagne for garnish. At $18, this cocktail came in a very appropriately sized glass. ;)

The bartender, Michael, was a total joy to be around. He was polite and friendly, and very attentive. He held light conversation with all of his customers, and checked on them periodically. 

If I lived in Toronto, I would definitely return here for a cocktail or two! I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a classy, intimate spot for an after dinner drink!"}
{"text":"Because I do not live nor work downtown, I always wanted to try the \"drinks at a snazzy downtown bar\" a la Sex-In-The-City. So, on a Friday night, I met up with my boyfriend after work at Library Bar because for me, the atmosphere of a bar is equally important as the drinks. I imagined this bar to be decorated Ralph Lauren style with antiquated books lining the shelves, paintings of English Grey Hounds framed in heavy gold dotting the walls as well as plush, brown, comfy chairs where I would imagine a gentleman with a perfect Ascot to sit, puffing away on his cigar. 

The reality was less romantic I found. The bar is actually one square room, open concept. There are two levels and we were seated by the stairs on the upper level. I looked to the wall and saw fake books!!!! (This to me was the BIGGEST disappointment). I had champagne and a martini champagne drink which made me very tizzy and giggly. My boyfriend had scotch(s). I don't remember the service being bad, but my boyfriend said that it was horrible. Funnily, the one thing I remember about this place (after having yet another champagne) was the guy on the cello playing some jazz-like music. 

Total bill for two JUST FOR DRINKS came out to be $115 including tax and tip. Because I was not at my soberest, I left happily, but looking back and with what my boyfriend saying that the service wasn't up to par, I wouldn't come out of my way for drink here again. Nothing special. 

My quest for my fave watering hole will have to continue."}
{"text":"Weekend high tea review only.

My friends and I stopped in for high tea and it was lovely. Service was spot on and our table was crowded with teapots and deliciousness.

The tea selection was good. The cocktail prices were high and no drinks were included with the tea price, but maybe that's normal. The sandwiches were fine. The scones tasty. The desserts coma inducing...in a good way.

Our service was handled by several people so I'm still not sure who our main server was, but everything arrived in a timely fashion. And the setting was gorgeous.

I did not have time to take the complementary tour of the hotel after, but the people I know who did said it was great."}
{"text":"I thought this was a cool place for a few drinks after work. Service was excellent and friendly. They have an extensive scotch and hard liquor menu. Martini's are also good. They also have a few mainstream beers on tap. Prices are on the higher end. We ordered food of the quick bar menu - a one page menu. Good sliders with roast beef instead of a hamburger - yummy. Poutine was also good. There was a \"Rodney's oyster bar\" stand in the bar as well if you enjoy oysters (not sure if this is permanent or a one time thing). Atmosphere is warm and cozy with couches and comfy seats. I will be back."}
{"text":"There's nothing not to like about this place. It's actually feels like I'm in a library... not the public library, but maybe the library room in an old mansion. Dimly lit, comfortable couches and armchairs, rich dark burgandy carpet, and lots of older gentlemen wearing suits. The wines were a little bit more expensive than I like paying (around $15 a glass for the kind of wine that costs $15 at the liquor store), but they provide free nibblies for as long as you're sat there. Our server was amazing - efficient, friendly, knowledgable (she recommended a different wine than the one that I ordered that was much better and similarly priced. Gotta love that). On a Monday afternoon at around 4:30pm, every table was being occupied. It was a great place for a quiet catch up, but considering how busy it was I can't imagine how packed it must get on Friday nights!"}
{"text":"Never tried the food.. but hostess made us wait 15 mins+  for a table of 2 when there are plenty of room available"}
{"text":"High five for high tea! Came here on a Sunday for high tea - It was my first high tea experience and it was terrific. The service was exceptional and server was ensured I was only given gluten free sandwiches, desserts and scones. Definitely a worthwhile experience. The decor adds so much to the ambience too. The tea was terrific and the presentation of both the tea and food was excellent. We were even offered a quick tour of the hotel when service was wrapping up (4pm)  - great history lesson."}
{"text":"Thank you to the wonderful staff and chef who accommodated my vegan diet for afternoon tea. I had a wonderful birthday. The sandwiches were delicious, especially the asparagus and shiitake mushroom one. I also loved the sweets, I couldn't believe the lemon tart was vegan. Everything was amazing. I definitely have a new birthday tradition."}
{"text":"Put a library in a bar and you've got 4 stars by default.  Have the heritage of the Fairmont and you're bloody well holding onto that.  This is a great spot to have a quick drink while you're waiting to catch a show, game, or before dinner.  The price can add up quickly and it's not as if they serve very good food, but I'll overlook it as the history, atmosphere, crowd and bar makes up for it."}
{"text":"This my favourite bar in the city for years. My date and I had our first date before Christmas and went back to experience their, High Tea on a Sunday afternoon. Presentation was beautiful. Our mini sandwiches and pastries were exquisite. 

Very accommodating to my date's  gluten intolerance. 

We were even provided with lovely historical tour of the hotel after our meal."}
{"text":"@fairmontRYH
A good friend of mine had here Bridal Shower here on a Sunday afternoon. They were able to book the entire place for about 50 people for High Tea, and it was a perfect, yet intimate place for such an event. 

I don't know what the regular price is for the High Tea, but this one is infinitely superior to the one at Windsor Arms, and I bet comparable in price.  This is the way High Tea should be, or at least at minimum. 

With a choice of tea, it comes in a large pot. The servers did have a problem trying to figure out who had which tea even though they wrote it down. They didn't pour tea for us, but could be because it was such a big group. There was also no strainer, but I suspect it's built into the teapot. 

Their infamous Crumpets with honey and fruits came first. I remember over 15 years ago when I came for HIgh Tea at Royal York with my parents, they served this as well.  This time it was quite bland, and the crumpets were not crunchy enough, but I added more Honey and it was tasty.

Then a plate of sandwiches. Some open faced. This did not look like your mother's crustless finger sandwiches made out of Wonderbread. They were creative, and nicely presented. One was Mango and Lobster. One was smoked salmon and cucumber. Another was Strawberry and Brie. They also did a very good job in accommodating any allergies by making substitutions. Except, again the staff had a terrible job of managing the allergies and almost gave my friend the 'strawberry allergy' although she is allergic to mango.

Then was the Scones and dessert that came on the tri-level plate. The servers were a little rude to the guests when they asked what was the \"spread\" that came with the scones (Clotted Cream, note, not Devonshire Cream but still good and lighter). Scones were soft and not too dense. 
The pastries were a fruit tart, cream puff, a really good lemon cake and something else I did not get to try. 

I did overhear that for this private party, there was some on and off debate and inconsistency about whether or not a cake and homemade desserts could be brought to the venue. The organizers were told one thing, and then later another. Just a note. 

Although the service seemed that it could improve, overall, a very good High Tea."}
{"text":"Living in New York, I am used to high prices for drinks, but I thought this place was a bit outrageous.  The specialty cocktails were priced around $25 to $35 with an average drink costing about $20.

I ordered a classic drink that even the waiter suggested just by looking at it again when he served it that it was made wrong and he insisted that he make me another one myself.  The ambiance is calm and very chill...good place to enjoy maybe a small plate and a couple drinks IF you're staying at the hotel, but I would definitely not advise going out of your way when there are plenty of other nice places with just as good na ambiance down the street in the financial district of Toronto."}
{"text":"A hidden gem in the Royal York Hotel.
Cozy, quiet, no television sets - perfect for an intimate drink.  Martinis are to die for.  They were at one time called \"Bird Bath Martinis\", but they seem to have changed this.  They are still unbelievably good.  The bartenders are experts in mixing drinks.  We have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"I came here for afternoon tea with some girlfriends.
The service was great, but felt rather rushed. The tiers of dessert were already on display when we walked in so it didn't feel fresh.

Scones were good, but would have been much better if they were hot. The sandwiches were simple. Overall the food was just alright, nothing blew me away.

HOWEVER, the highlight was definitely the rooftop garden tour after the meal. We were able to sample their herb and veggie garden. They had all sorts of neat plants - chocolate mint, mojito mint, purple spinach, etc. I quite enjoyed the tour over the food."}
{"text":"Love the ambiance of this lounge and the food  and drink is great..  Enjoy it when they have live music."}
{"text":"Classy high tea for a girl days!

I went with 2 other friends and we were seated in a corner with plush couch like chairs, the dark wood and antique looking furniture really brings a fancy feeling,You want to put your pinkys up! it was quiet and great for catching up and chatting. The service was good, not amazing but good enough.

We got the Berry Berry, which was really really red in colour. The Kea Lani Orange Pineapple tea was light and refreshing but my favourite was the Kyoto Cherry Rose tea, it was bold and floral. It came in floral tea sets which were beautiful. 

The finger sandwiches were not bad, the best was the turkey with cranberry and cucumber and watercress. The pastry tower and cream puffs shaped like swans- pretty but didnt feel as fresh as they could be, a berry panna cotta which had great fruit flovour, the macarons were ok again not as fresh as Id like them to be. The scones were delicious and it was the best Devonshire Cream I've ever had.

Going in the summertime also has a great perk, you can go for a rooftop garden tour! After tea, we walked up a long flight of stairs, unfortunately the chef and our tour guide forgot the roof key and he had to go back downstairs to get it, leaving our group in the stairway which got really stuffy and hot. The garden has a great view of the CN tower and he took us around and showed us what they grew, we also got to pick some herbs and strawberries to nibble! They also have a bee farm up there (which scared me a bit haha)

Even though its a bit pricey it makes for a lovely afternoon outing!"}
{"text":"Old school charm personified. Menus on old newspaper, stiff drinks, well costumed, friendly servers. This place is a throwback.

Great bar to settle in for a happy hour, hang out after dinner... or really go for any occasion. It's a can't-miss."}
{"text":"Warm atmosphere and superlative service! 4 of us were visiting from out of town and heading back to our hotel after a Saturday night show. We stopped in for a drink and ended up staying until last call due to the cozy atmosphere (we were lucky to get couch seating), live music that was entertaining without being distracting, and FANTASTIC service from Gerd.  He was attentive and personalized drinks for us in ways we didn't know we wanted until we tasted them.  A fantastic way to end the night!"}
{"text":"Sooo after a relaxing hour in the jacuzzi my husband and I decided to have a little something to eat here! Let me get right to the point. The chicken curry potpie was sooooooo amazing!! Oh My God it was probably the best we ever had so it's a must for you to try. The French onion soup was amazing too!! We also ordered club  sandwich but could not finish it since we got full from the potpie and soup. The Sandwich was pretty good too. So good service, great location and Fab food"}
{"text":"Love their drinks! Crab cakes are pretty good tea- they have live entertainment on the weekends which is a nice touch!"}
{"text":"This is a tough area for a good price on anything... Drinks weren't cheap, I liked the decor, comfort of the room.  Attractive old hotel across from union and acc."}
{"text":"Met up with an old friend, and because her seminar was being held at the Royal York, we chose to meet up at the Library Bar prior to her catching the train.  

Arrived and the place was packed after work on a Wednesday.  The hotel, I think it traditionally busy, so it's not surprising to find the bar busy.  

If you are looking for a place to have a quiet drink in an intimate setting, you'd only be half way there.  The crowded bar was very noisy.  The service is very good, as they were constantly coming around to check on your drinks and pop down some snacks.  Caramel popcorn and some assorted nuts.  Yup, those were a nice touch.  The servers filled those along with the water glasses several times.  Often times taking away a half empty bowl only to put a full bowl of popcorn down.  

Ok, the part that doesn't give me the warm feeling is the price tag.  $20 for a drink !  Seriously ?  I have two drinks and with tax I'm up over the $45 amount, add tip and I'm well over $50.  For 2 drinks !  And it's not like they were the most fabulous drinks I've ever had.  

Overall, it's a nice space, but after work is just plain busy.  The crowd makes it lose it's charm. The service was top notch, but the over the top price for drinks just makes it a bit of killjoy.  I'd go back to meet up with a friend, but I think I'll suggest hitting up a less expensive place that seem aplenty within the block."}
{"text":"A friend once told me about being at a pub in Scotland, where shortly after a round of drinks was served the bartender yelled, \"Closing time! Push it down and get the f*ck out\"! It's part of the charm of a rough and ready Glasgow pub, I suppose, but I wouldn't expect to receive essentially the same treatment having afternoon tea at the Fairmont Royal York. My friends and I had reserved a 2:45pm seating to celebrate a special occasion. Several people in our party had not seen each other for a long time, and we had guests from out of town, so we would have loved to linger and chat leisurely over our tea. It was barely 4pm, however, when we were informed that the dining room had to close to prepare for 5pm dinner, so we had to pack up our unfinished pastries, pay, and leave. Yes, our sandwiches were exquisitely crafted and delicately flavoured, and the scones and cakes were picture perfect and well executed, on par with afternoon tea that I've had elsewhere in Toronto and the UK before -- but none of those other venues booted us out before we decided we were ready to go.
Another sticking point: we had a \"large group\" gratuity added to our bills...it indicated 18% but the amount charged on $50 was $12.37, which is closer to 25%...and tax was applied not just to the food bill, but to this surcharge as well.
I've been to the Library Bar at the Royal York on prior occasions, although not for tea, so I knew that I would be paying a premium for the  venue and the ambience. Too bad we didn't get to enjoy it for very long. Why even bother with a 2:45 seating if guests have vacate the premises by 4? I also thought that if you really want to follow tradition, afternoon tea happens around 4pm, but that's another matter. The next time I want sketchy math on my bill and \"push it down and get the f*ck out\" ambience, I'm heading to the pub."}
{"text":"Hmmm.  This is a tough one.  Service really depends on demand.  If it is full good luck on a bad way.

That being said I was there with my buddy and we were hungry and thirsty later in the evening.  They accommodated an off menu order of wings which was great.  They were amazing.  Drink service was a little slow though.

In previous visits I have order their cold seafood tower which was excellent as well.  But again, drink service is generally slow when busy or very quick when moderately full or less.

They have a very good tasting Moscow Mule.  Unless they run out of copper cups.  Which is more often than not.  For a hotel bar at a Fairmont it is very good.  The decor is more traditional and overall selection of scotch, mixed drinks, and beer was worth going to.

They are very accommodating and strive to do the best they can as staffing permits.  They might consider staffing more during game nights when they coincide with a relatively full hotel.

Overall if you are staying there it is a great atmosphere and a wide range of patrons.  I have been there multiple times and will continue to do so when staying at the Royal York."}
{"text":"My sister and I took my mother here for Mother's day.  I was a bit nervous about attending this place.  I was worried about the etiquette and the posh surroundings.  Well, let me tell you, all the staff were wonderful and made us feel comfortable right from the beginning.  

 I want to make a special mention to \"Emaad\" who was our server.   He was the absolute best!  I could not have asked for better!  If you're looking for a unique experience and the best service ever, you'll be very pleased  with Afternoon Tea in The Library Room at The Fairmont Royal York.

{"text":"A few months ago they changed the menu and it's not as good. The menu reads more like average pub grub, rather than the excellence they were known for. Nice atmosphere, great service, but nothing standing out in terms of food."}
{"text":"The problem with libraries isn't because it's a place of knowledge to feed your brain with all the greatest stories that the human mind can offer.  The problem with libraries is that it lacks adult beverages to catalyze the event.  In my university days, I'd been known to sneak a flask to assist homework absorption by at least one of the three wise men: Johnnie, Jim, or Jack, or a river confluence of all three.   It's been a few months since I've been here and occasionally, my girl and I will talk about it.  Good times.  

I'm not sure if the Library Bar is a common icon in the line of Fairmont Royal York Hotels, but if not, Toronto has a special drinking partner.  I must admit the lowly-lit Library is not conducive for reading.  Yet, the mind is quenched through drink (classic Sidecars and Manhattans) in a lounge: a dark, cozy room; bookshelves; red, comfy couches, low tables only corgis would love, classic lamps, and plenty of elbow room between drinking parties.  Hey, I must be in my living room? Sure, I'll have another drink.  If you need me, I'll be right here.  Thanks."}

If you want posh, this is where you go. I've been to pricey places around Toronto, and compared to that, I thought Fairmont's Library Bar did well. My friend ordered a champagne and I ordered a margarita, and surprisingly we both received FULL glasses of our drinks. They didn't cheap out and the drinks were full of taste. My margarita was ace. 

With our drinks, we also got small bowls of munchies - caramel kettle corn and salty mini pretzels. We got seconds from our lovely server. Speaking of servers, he was a lovely older gentleman and he sure knew customer service. We were cared for - and nobody rolled their eyes at our casual clothes. 

European decor at its best, the Library bar is cozy and intimate. I think it makes for a romantic date venue.

Margarita Rating: 5/5
Ankie Tip: Street parking on Front St after 6pm is $4 an hour - offered by Green P."}
{"text":"We wanted a leisurely meal with relatives. In that respect the restaurant satisfied in providing gracious, leisurely service. The roast beef sandwiches were a pretty average and roast beef dip, the horse radish was the mildest I ever had, the seafood soup was blah, the club sandwich and salad was ok."}
{"text":"Excellent all-round spot for a wide variety of occasions.

Walk in and you'll feel like you've taken a step into the past. In a good way. The furniture all has an old charm to it. I suppose it's essentially Victorian era. The seats for many tables are actually large couches. The place isn't overwhelmingly large. It is cozy and somewhat quiet, despite it being a weekday lunch period where I'd otherwise have expected a bit more of a corporate crowd here. It's a neat and very welcoming atmosphere, topped off by fantastic service.

I came here for lunch. We were informed that the special was the prime rib sandwich. My colleagues opted for that while I decided to give the pizza a shot, for whatever odd reason. I was pleasantly surprised but how good the pizza was. Quality, fresh toppings generously laid out, excellent cheese, and a crust perfectly done. Only downside was it was on the greasier side (almost like Pizza Hut greasy), but because the pizza was so well put together, it was forgivable. As for the sandwiches, they were fantastic. My colleagues were very pleased by them, commenting that the meat just \"melts in your mouth.\"

Great experience here -- it's a good spot to meet up with a few friends for pretty much anything."}
{"text":"No matter how many times I have walked through the Fairmont Royal York on my way to Union Station, I have always found myself admiring of the grandiosity that is this grand old hotel, with its shiny banisters, fresh cut flowers and lush, lovely carpets. It is like stepping into a different time, where porters in red uniforms open the doors of taxicabs for guests, and greet every other passerby with a respectful \"Sir\" or \"Madam\". 

It also never fails to surprise me, how the Fairmont Royal York, one of the oldest establishments in the city, oscillates between grandiosity and raggedness all at once. 

Standing in the foyer outside the Library Bar, under the high and sweeping arches of the marble ceilings, I started my Afternoon Tea by asking the unsmiling hostess if my group's table was ready. I was informed rather curtly that I was to wait another few minutes. 

To her credit, the wait in fact, did not take more than five minutes. Once we were seated in the rather dark dining room, our waiter came around to tell us what on offer. 

The menu he presented was quite your typical array of sandwiches, scones and pastries. Nothing quite jumped off of the menu, but then again, I suppose high tea isn't exactly what one would call, adventurous. 

Scarcely had he left us to decide which tea we would like however, when another server approached, going through the exact same spiel. It was like a strangely compressed Groundhog day.

If that wasn't questionable enough, the server who had brought us our food sported a messy ponytail tied sloppily to the side of the head. Having taken tea at newer hotels like Deq, I have nothing against a more stylish approach to my tea time. Nonetheless, I have to admit, the manner in which the staff conducted themselves was not quite what I expected from a place like the Library Bar. As far as I know - in my limited experience - Afternoon Tea was supposed to be a slightly more sophisticated experience than having a drink at my local pub. 

The tea itself:

My Breakfast tea never seemed to get hot enough, but that didn't stop me from drinking two pots of it. On the sandwich plate, the lobster pretzel sandwich was the best thing on it. The turkey sandwich however, was dry and uninspired - as turkey sandwiches often are. Perfect Lemon-Cranberry scones were accompanied by potted jam and clotted cream, though on a scale of Windsor Arms to Deq, it fell somewhere in the middle, quality and taste wise. 

Melt in your mouth chocolate Mousse and too sweet Macarons were topped off with Choux (puff) pastry filled with custard, and shaped like swans - crowning evidence of how dated the menu really was. 

The meal was finished with frozen white chocolate cheesecake pops, which would not have been out of place in Starbucks, and which I left unfinished and half crumbled on my plate. 

After tea (and after we signed some disclaimer forms), the diners were brought on a tour to the rooftop garden. It was a journey that took us through an elevator lobby with cardboard boxes leaning agains the walls and a trip up many flights of stairs past several dust floors clearly still in construction. 

The tour was quite ultimately worth it, especially as we were allowed to taste the organic strawberries the hotel grew. Ladies in heels, beware; one step off the paving stones, and your shoes will be ruined on the loose pebbles. 

I wish I could say that Afternoon Tea at the Library Bar was special but the truth is, it wasn't. It wasn't bad either. For the price, it is exactly as advertised, no more and no less, which isn't the worse thing in the world, except for the expectation it had built, given the locale and the hype."}
{"text":"Stopped in for after-work drinks with a friend during Christmas-time. The bar was busy but we were eventually seated in what could be argued as the best seat in the house - right by the window looking out to Union Station / Front Street.

The service was superb - with a very attentive and knowledgeable server who gave us a mini-history lesson about the hotel and the rooftop beehive and garden. 

Delicious cocktails: 
- ROOFTOP LAVENDER AND HONEY BEE'S KNEES and
- MORTDECAI SPICED MANHATTAN
both strong and flavourful 

And we shared a STEAK TARTARE to snack on - that came with 3 slides of toasted crostini. We could've used a fourth piece given the amount of tartare remaining and the fact it was shared between two.

Hotel bars, especially those that bear such historic significance - are always favourites to frequent."}
{"text":"I had a martini. 

Nice furnishings. When I was there, fairly crowded. Extremely noisy, which ruins any chance at being cosy or intimate. 

The martini was small and cost twenty f*cking dollars. 

I'd give it four stars, but because of the noise and price, I'm giving it three (which may be generous)."}
{"text":"really classy place to enjoy some drinks. they serve some good whiskeys and cocktails. reason for \"only\" 4 stars, it is a little bit pricey."}
{"text":"This was stop #2 for ST and I in our quest to hit up as many afternoon tea suppliers as possible without morbid obesity. We loved DT Bistro and had really high hopes. It's the Royal York. They'd know afternoon tea, surely?

Booking was easy thanks to Open Table and we were both really looking forward to our girlie meet-up. The welcome at reception was warm which boded well. I can't say I loved the bar itself, unfortunately. It's pretty dark and gloomy. Maybe that's the atmosphere they're going for, but it was more crypt than classy. Our server came over to us with menus almost immediately so that we could start into our important decision making.

The traditional tea is $39.50 and includes sandwiches, scones and pastries (http://www.fairmont.com/royal-york-toronto/pdf/ryh-library-bar-tea-menu-may-13/). Thankfully they also allow a la carte ordering. ST and I are like Jack Spratt and his wife when it comes to afternoon tea (we like different things) so we decided on one full tea with extra scones ($10) and tea ($5). 

Sandwiches were fine. I ate the turkey and caprese ones. Scones were also OK. They're tiny! Like mini scones. Two of them are equivalent to one normal scone I'd think. My Mum's are infinitely better. Jam was Hero in little pots, not all fancied up in bowls or anything. The cream was apparently Harmony farms. It just seemed a bit over-whipped.

I really liked the chocolate truffle cake! The macarons were decent and the mousse was pretty tasty. I wouldn't really go out of my way to get it again.

My tea was kind of lukewarm and while they were technically loose leaf at one stage, they were loose leaf poured into a bag and put in the pot. The purists may take issue. 

It took a while to get our bill, and when we did they'd charged for 2 teas. Thankfully they were quick to change it when we let them know. 

Overall it was fine but far from spectacular. i wouldn't go again. I'm giving a 3/5 because I'm nice. ST has higher standards and reckoned it was a 2. With hashtag epicfail. Tough, isn't she?"}
{"text":"In case you were wondering, there are NO BOOKS in the Library Bar. This hurt my brain.

Thankfully, the drinks were very lovely, which helped my brain feel better about there being NO BOOKS in the Library Bar.

Also, the candied nuts and the caramel corn were fantastic. I'd come back just for those. (Confession: I kind of ruined my dinner by eating too many of the nuts.)

I'm giving it a 4-star rating just because I ordered the same drink three times, and it was different each time. One time, it was radically different. And the bartender was the same. So, consistency might not be the strongest suit. 

I'd definitely return, and I will bring my own book."}
{"text":"The wine was nice, if a bit expensive and I like the little snacks they bring you, but they charged my credit card twice and I had to call 5+ times to get it sorted. Use cash?"}
{"text":"My third time for high tea here and the experience has been progressively worse each time. This time it was the \"festive\" tea that came with an additional $10 premium, bringing the service to $60...for what, I don't know. Maybe the \"tour\" they offered of mostly publicly accessible places (with the exception of the massive kitchen). 

To book the gluten free high tea, one needs to ensure booking 24-48 hours in advance - I gave them a week. 

For $60: the bread was cold, as though it came just from the fridge. Gluten free bread is hard at the best of times, cold it's pretty unpleasant. 4 tiny triangle sandwiches. The single scone was flat, hard, crumbly and too sweet. It was like a cookie. The dessert tray consisted of more hard, dry, crunchy cookies (biscotti & ginger snaps), stale, dry chocolate cake and stale strawberry cake and a bowl of fruit. The tea pot smelled like it had had coffee in it at some time and tasted like it too. 

The first time I went, I was given a massive piece of cake as my dessert selection and the second time a bowl of sorbet (in January). This time at least they offered the selection, sub par that it was. 

If you're looking for a great gluten free tea experience, go to the Shangrila. Theirs is worth what you pay. The fact that both the Shangrila and King Edward were fully booked for tea this weekend and next, but the Fairmont with availability should have been an indication."}
{"text":"Best afternoon tea I've had so far, although it's been a while and I notice their menu (and price, from $35 to $39.50) has changed.  My favourite finger sandwich was the lobster one, too bad they don't serve that anymore.  The pastries are as delicious as they are beautiful, one of them a swan-shaped cream puff.  Alas, they don't seem to have that anymore either.  The place is nicely decorated and cozy, the food and tea were exceptional, the service was excellent, and live music (acoustic guitar) was such a treat.  Hmm... maybe I should go check out the new menu, hold on, I'll be back..."}
{"text":"With its dark, rich tapestries and walls lined with vintage books as old as the historic room itself, Library Bar is an atmospheric place to sip and nibble with good company at the end of a long day. We made a last minute reservation and arrived just before the after work rush. Except for a couple of empty stools up at the bar, every seat in the house remained filled throughout our leisurely stay. 

The service was most excellent. Our server was extremely attentive and helpful with suggestions for both food and drink. Despite the bar's reputation for having the best cocktails in town (as announced by one of my cinq-a-sept dates), we opted for a bottle of delicious pinot grigio that arrived in a classy stand alone chilled bucket. 

My seafood chowder was as heart-stoppingly creamy as our friendly server promised. My friend's French onion soup smelled decadent. The cheese platter was perfect for sharing. Next time, I'll try my best to keep from finishing all of the salty mixed nuts though."}
{"text":"A true hidden gem! Excellent service and atmosphere. They have a great wine selection and an adorable cocktail menu. It's pricey, but as an occasional date night the experience is more than worth it."}
{"text":"I had the beef sandwich and my wife had the French onion soup, which she raved about.
We also had the marmalade mule cocktail which was very good.  Great ambiance, wonderful service."}
{"text":"The food is made with care. I haven't been here for High Tea, but based on my experience coming here for drinking and/or dining, it has been amazing beyond my expectations.

Their Oyster Thursday's have a guy coming from Rodney's Oysters that would shuck upon request. The oysters are decent-sized and fresh."}
{"text":"I've been to the Fairmont Royal York hotel many times and never been to the Library Bar. Always thought it was just a regular bar but they actually serve food!  My friend recommended this place. The ambience was so cool. It's dark and dim like an actual library! Very cozy and intimate with super cozy chairs. I didn't know what to expect and usually hotel food are not that great. But was I open minded.  I had the prime rib sandwich with Cesar salad (decided to go healthy).  My friend had the French onion soup. Our food was so delicious.  I wanted dessert but my friend was sick and didn't want to share the dessert with me. So obviously I'm not going to be a pig and eat the dessert myself!  The dessert menu was so cute. It came in a hard cover book.  Next time I will definitely get dessert.  The service was amazing! Someone always came by to fill up your cup with water or ask you if everything was ok.  I could see myself having tea there and staying for a few hours to just relax.  I would definitely come back. Great experience!!"}
{"text":"Three of us went for Afternoon Tea. The place was lit more like a lounge for drinks, and I wish it was a little brighter in the middle of the afternoon. The tables were very close to each other, and at one point my husband was almost bang in the middle of two guests at the next table. I take one star off for that.

Now for the rest. Servers were great, as was the tea. One of the people at our table found the tea too weak, and they were happy to add another tea bag. Good old fashioned English style china for everything.

The sandwiches were excellent and very well flavoured. The scones were delicious and fresh, and we liked some of the preserves at the table too. There was a fruit mousse which was to die for. Guava and raspberry. This was fresh, tangy and not too sweet. The cake was a good dark chocolate. We weren't marshmallow fans so no comments on that.

Overall, great service and food, but ambience could be brighter and the tables shouldn't be so close together."}
{"text":"The old city library now another of the many bars inside the Royal York aptly named the Library Bar offers up a more sophisticated environment to sit down and have a drink or two after work.  The bar tender, Mike, is very friendly and has great suggestions if u want something different.  There are 2 current specials for beer, one on tap and another bottled to celebrate the 85th birthday.  I also tried their hand carved roast beef sandwich and it was amazing!  Buttery roll stacked with hand carved roast beef with au jus on the side.  Very nice environment to wind down your day."}
{"text":"We have become quite accustomed to the royal experience at the Fairmont Hotels. When we had the opportunity to experience the William & Kate Afternoon Tea Menu at The Library Bar located in The Fairmont Royal York, we had to try it!

In celebration of the arrival of Prince George Alexander Louis, we got to choose between the following tea options: 
Traditional Afternoon Tea
The Royal Tea Experience
We felt like it wouldn't be proper to celebrate the birth of Prince George without some Moet Chandon Brut Imperial Champagne so we opted for the Royal Tea Experience.


TRADITIONAL FINGER SANDWICHES
Both the Traditional Afternoon Tea and Royal Tea Experience feature some of William & Kate's favorite things:

   - Farmer's Egg Truffle Chive Salad
   - Smoked Aurora Turkey Breast with Cranberry Emulsion
   - Kate's Tomato Gazpacho Caprese Salad
   - St. Mary's Smoked Salmon 

If we had to rank the sandwiches from our most favorite to least it would be:

   1.  Farmer's Egg Truffle Chive Salad.  This sandwich was delicious.  We ordered 
        more of these because one was not enough!
   
   2.  Kate's Tomato Gazpacho Caprese Salad.  This was fantastic as well and we 
        totally get why this is Kate's favorite tea sandwich.

   3.  Smoked Aurora Turkey Breast.  The cranberry emulsion made this more than 
         just turkey on wheat.

   4.  St. Mary's Smoked Salmon.  This is made with Fairmont's Royal York Lemonade Aioli and cucumber.  If only we were fans of salmon!


SMOKED SALMON CANAPES
We got canapes because we wanted the \"royal\" experience.  As you are now aware, we do not have a huge love affair with salmon so we could have passed on these.  If you are a fan of salmon then you will be all set!

THE TEA
There are many mysteries and truths about tea but one thing we know is that Fairmont has a ridiculously good tea selection!  With so many Metropolitan Tea blend options it was very difficult to decide.  Below is a sample of their selections:

   - Jasmine Butterfly #1
   - Kyoto Cherry Rose
   - Montebello Apple Spice - they were out of this
   - Cascade Organic Peppermint - they were out of this also 
   - Kea Lai Orange Pineapple

After much discussion we decided to get the Kyoto Cherry Rose and that was a fantastic decision!  This was so good we immediately ran to the gift shop to purchase as many boxes as they had available.  

Unfortunately because of the bees, we were unable to take part in the rooftop herb garden and bee apiary tour--maybe next time!


THE SWEETS!
We have said this time and time again but this is truly our favorite part of any tea!  Who doesn't like the guilty pleasures of eating the scrumptious sweet treats?!  It just is not a Par-tea without these tasty pastries:


Scones
Sundried Cranberry and Blueberry scones with devonshire cream.  Do we really need to say more?  They really are that good.

William's Banana Flan
Dr. J liked the banana flan.  It really depends on the day how I feel about bananas but they say this is one of William's favorite desserts.  

Guava and Raspberry Mousse
We were fixated on the orange berry in this mousse.  Turns out this is a goji berry and yes it is edible!

Buckingham Palace Chocolate Biscuit Cake
Supposedly this is \"THE\" recipe from Buckingham Palace.  When we visit London next month, we will just have to stop by and verify this for ourselves!  Whether or not this is true, we loved it.  Be careful because the Buckingham Palace Chocolate Biscuit Cake is VERY rich. 

English Sticky Toffee Pudding
I had sticky toffee pudding for the first time a few years ago in London and I was a fan of it then just as I am a fan of this particular version now.  Fairmont should really consider keeping this and/or the Buckingham Palace Biscuit on the menu.


We give the Library Bar's Afternoon Tea two pinkies up!"}
{"text":"The Library Bar feels like a place that I would go for a drink when I grown up. 

Big comfortable wing chairs. Dark Wood Interior. Classy Decoration.

Waitstaff polite and proper. Service attentive.

They do have a few draft beer available including Royal York Aivary Ale ($9.50) which is brewed by Mill Street especially for Royal York and a cream ale 1929 in bottle brewed by Double Trouble Brewing to celebrate Royal York's 85 anniversary.

I would probably try a cocktail next time or even some of their whiskies next time.

Price is on the higher end as almost $10 for a pint? but it is after all inside a nice hotel. 

+0.5 star as it is located in The PATH, great to meet up with friends that works in the downtown without even the need to going out in the cold during the harsh winter months!"}
{"text":"I love this place. The setting is awesome. It's inside the Fairmont for one and secondly it's just a really classy place inside and different from a lot of the new trendy fine dining spots in the city. The service was great. The hostess and waiter were both really friendly and at the same time not pretentious at all. The baked escargot I got was delicious if not exactly traditional. Think your regular escargot with a ton of delicious cheese baked over it. It's slightly too salty but still amazing. I also got the bison burger with Caesar salad. The bison was cooked perfectly and the whole burger was just mouth watering because of that perfectly crispy bacon. The Caesar salad was also great. Pretty unique flavour along with some Romano cheese flakes I think. All in all a great spot for a date night."}
{"text":"Nice quaint fancy pants place to get a nice drink. Swanky crowd makes you feel like your rubbing shoulders with the local elites. Got the cocktails and they were interesting."}
{"text":"Drinks were amazing, food was yummy, and service was wonderful! It's a little pricey, but definitely worth it's high price."}
{"text":"Came here for high tea with my girlfriends.  Atmosphere with great and food was good.

My favorite were the sandwiches and the flour less chocolate cake.  

For the money that you are paying for high which  $50 a person, you think you would get real Devonshire cream for the scones but it was more like a whipped butter.

Also the early I got was ok. It was an ice wine inspired tea but it just tasted like any regular tea. 

Don't think I would come back for high tea.  Maybe for their martini cus apparently they were voted for the best one in toronto. 

Plus $50 a person is quite steep for high tea."}
{"text":"This not something I would write home about.
The sandwiches were stale and dry. (Suggestion for chef to wrap up with Saran Wrap to keep fresh) 
Scones sub-par pretty disappointing Starbucks is better.
Desserts are just ok nothing to say was $50 worth ... The service was just ok as we had girl come once to fill cold tea.
The bill was incorrect as they charged us one extra. 
I won't come back, there are lots of better high tea places in Toronto."}
{"text":"Decided to check this place out for dinner one day, lovely atmosphere, the Oxford look was a real draw. Really great service, waited for a friend for a long time, did not get any weird looks hahaha.  Finally when it was time to order, ordered French onion soup for myself. Honestly it was a little too rich for my liking, however my friend helped me finished my soup in record speed, she loved it.  
Would go again to enjoy the atmosphere and great service, they have a great bar as well."}
{"text":"High tea here was quite the pretty sight.
Love the decor of the Library Bar. Cosy and elegant with dark wood, high ceiling long curtained windows, for that intimate feel.
Place setting was pretty as well, our table had a small couch to it at one side with lepard print - ooooo. Couldnt help but smile as I looked around. Definately made me more excited with the service to come.
The service was great as well. They waited for you to finish the course before placing the other down, yet didnt hover over your table.
So high notes to start. Didnt expect there to be different \"courses\" for high tea - usually it all comes on one tier. But we were served crumpets first. Not a fan of crumpets but this could change my mind. Loved the honey that was supposively made from the roof, that was drizzled over the fresh berries.
Next the sandwich platter. OOOOh this was tastey. Definate 5/5. Not the usual bland cucumber sandwiches for sure. They definately put some care and thought into these: smoked turkey, goat cheese with strawberries, lobster - or was it crab? , and salmon. Yum!
But with this high note, you could imagine my disappointment with the dessert and scones that came next. So the tiers were already placed in a row on the bar counter when we came in. They look so elegant all sitting there in a row. Later we realized that maybe they have been sitting there since the night before? Or early that morning? As pretty as they were they lacked in taste. I would rate it at a 3 or eek, dare I say 2.5? 
The scones didnt taste like scones - but more like sweet thick cake. Not something I would order on its own - thank goodness for the dollop of devonshire cream!
The pastries were your average pastries. I adore lemon anything! So that makes me kinda picky about the taste. These were kinda lemony but more sugary which was a disappointment. The cookie that was half dipped in icing was quite boring. At this point I was too full to finish, as I just took a bite out of each dessert to taste.
Thank goodness we got here early enough (2:30) because at 4 they have the Chef take us on a tour of their rooftop garden! Oh what a treat! 
The day was beautiful and the views fantastic. I love looking at the architecture of the royal york and the view of the train station across from it. 
They said that they use the veg and fruits (mini strawberries tasted yum) in their restaurant but Im wondering how they could possibly do that - I mean one night of service in their resto would definately use up all the lettuce etc in the small garden. 
They also have bees and bee containers (? not sure what they were called, Im sure its not a hive or maybe it is a \"man made hive\") up there and make their own honey. 
Anyways the tour was an added bonus !
Overall a good experience. The price was also on the upper end. They should work on their desert platters and also the fact that they have bagged teas - I understand that they are the fairmount chain teas but loose leaf is where it is at.
The teas we chose - cherry and pinapple were not as tastey as the name would imply."}
{"text":"Food was awful (lobster knuckle sandwich and Cuban pork sandwich with what seemed like Velvetta cheese). We both had stomach aches afterwards. Service was mediocre. Good news: nice decor; open late; lively crowd, including a couple making out heavily on a sofa"}
{"text":"Old fashioned English snooty pub feel. Very English selection. Boring pictures and great if you like colonial raj era high end drinking spots"}
{"text":"Stopped in last night for drinks and a late night snack. They have some nice dark rums and were offering Moët by the glass. I found the Caesar to have a bit too much anchovies for my taste buds, but the Tuna Nicoise was excellent. Service was excellent; friendly, helpful and attentive. The atmosphere lives up to the name. Even though the place was packed it was quiet and calm. I recommend this place for a quiet evening."}
{"text":"I was here first in 2011. Their selection of finger sandwiches was more comparing to my today's experience. 
Overall the service and staff was great specially the gentleman who gave us a tour of the rooftop garden. But when i asked our server to pack our leftovers to go, i found out later that she only packed some items, not everything that was left!!! I was looking forward to eat that special dessert at home since I was there with my baby and planned to enjoy that one dessert in peace with a cup of tea at home. I'm gonna call them and ask why didn't they pack the whole thing for me :(???"}
{"text":"Lovely environment, and a nice afternoon tea service. I didn't love ALL the mini sandwiches and cakes, but the selection was quite large. 

The darjeeling from the royal collection is delicious. Can't go wrong with a classic tea like that! I initially ordered the lapsang souchong to try and didn't enjoy it - it smelled very smokey and tasted kind of like bacon tea, which is not as good as it sounds. :P Our kind server offered to switch it for me and I was much happier with the super fragrant darjeeling. I tend to stick to classic teas - blacks teas or earl greys - because I have plenty of Chinese and Japanese teas at home, and if I wanted to have some funky, trendy, \"creatively-flavoured\" tea, I could just go to DavidsTea. So I'd recommend going for a classic at hotel tea services. 

The gravlax sandwich was good, and the roast beef was also alright. The shrimp spread could have used more flavour and I wish they gave us more toast to eat it with, considering how much spread we were given! It tasted kind of like eating soft but solid butter, actually, because it's basically just shrimp cooked in clarified butter. 

I dislike marzipan but enjoyed most of the cakes - I just peeled the marzipan off the two that came with it. My favourite cake was the banana toffee loaf. But the best things in the whole tea service were the scones!!! They were so fresh and buttery and fluffy and they smelled SO GOOD. I wish there were more/fancier jams to eat them with! Cream was nice and fresh, too. 

Service was also very good. Table was very small for all the stuff we ordered, but the old-fashioned armchairs were comfortable. 

I took Superwoman here for her birthday, and she really loved the \"royal\" aspect of the tea - the fact that a former British royal chef put this together and that there was information about who in the royal family likes what item(s) from the menu...we were born in a British colony, after all. 

The tea service also comes with a tour of the rooftop garden and some other parts of the hotel, though we didn't participate because we were pressed for time - we had a movie to go to. It was kind of odd that they came around with waiver forms if you wanted to go on the tour but I suppose they have those based on experience! 

It was a very nice experience over all."}
