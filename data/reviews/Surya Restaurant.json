{"text":"Dear Surya - You are a great Indian establishment you have amazing tasting food and I enjoy almost every item on your menu.   However I have stopped enjoying your succulent meals because of the not so \"fresh\" veg ingredients - We all know what canned mushrooms and frozen peas,corn, and carrots look and taste like and that's not what i spend my hard earned money on.   I truly hope you step up your ingredients, than you will be 5 stars in my book."}
{"text":"This is, by far, my favourite indian restaurant. It's just spicy enough that I can eat a lot of it without having to blow my nose every two minutes, but not so spicy that my friends who aren't used to Indian food can't eat it.  The staff are incredibly polite and friendly, the atmosphere is great.  They have tons of vegetarian options, but lots of meat ones as well.  When you do take-out buffet, they pack up your nan separately AND give you a separate container for dessert. So you really get a lot for your money!  It's difficult for me not to eat here every night of the week."}
{"text":"Masala lemonade. Sometimes I come here just for the Masala lemonade; a glass of freshly squeezed lemonade, speckled with Garam Masala. Sounds strange, but it's incredibly addicting. In fact, I whipped up a spiked batch once for a party, and it was the first drink to disappear.   The food here is delicious, and the lunch buffet has lots of great options for everyone from the most unapologetic carnivore, the guy in your group that just has to look at a jalape√±o before bursting in to flames and diving in to the water pitcher, and the level 5 vegan that refuses to eat anything that casts a shadow.   On one visit here, my lady friend suggested I try the Bhindi (Okra) Masala. I was skeptical at first, because normally, I hate Okra. I mean, who decided eating a vegetable that has the mouthfeel of a loogie was a good thing? Surya does an excellent job of getting rid of the Okra snot, and made something that I was pleasantly surprised to have enjoyed thoroughly. You win, Surya!"}
{"text":"A List. Recommended. Great food. Polite and friendly service. Decor not so much. Come for the prompt service and great food. You will be back."}
{"text":"Two words: butter. chicken.  This place has changed the way I look at Indian food. Everything is deliciously, fresh, and seasoned perfectly. Add to that reasonable priced, and you've got a winner. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for some of the best Indian food around.  Its a great example of how a family-run business can succeed: dad and the older son cook, mom and the younger son work the front.  For vegetarians, try the mattar paneer."}
{"text":"A thread on the Calgary conversation board entitled 'Secret Restaurants' put Indian food on my brain this morning as the post was asking people to share some of their favourite, but less known spots.    My contribution come rushing to the front of my mind as I attempted to quiet my growling stomach through my last meeting before lunch.  'Shhh... sit still and be quiet just a little bit longer.  I'll feed you soon' I promised my tummy as I attempted to hide the sound of the rumblings coming from my end of the table.  It's a good thing Surya is only a couple of blocks away from our office. My stomach would not have been impressed had I not delivered on the thoughts of their tasty lunch buffet that I had been tempting it with all morning.  The buffet is not a large one, but then again, Surya isn't a large restaurant to begin with.  I would estimate that they can comfortably accommodate 40-50 people.  But they always say quality over quantity, right?    My favourite part about the buffet would be the naan bread, the butter chicken and their rice.  I know, pretty typical.  But what my tummy wants on a lunch hour, it gets on days like today.  Reservations at lunch are not necessary, and the value of the food is far greater than the $15-$20 you'll spend on your meal.

{"text":"I'm a late \"Indian food\" bloomer. Yes, sadly I never really got into this fine cuisine until my 23rd year of life. I was always one of those kids who thought curry smelled way too powerful and assumed all Indian food must be of the same potency.  Well thank goodness I was RIGHT, because without this potent flavor Indian food wouldn't be what it is, and Surya does it right.  I came here for their lunch buffet with a rumblin' in my gut. All I knew was I wanted to consume absurd amounts of Naan bread without anyone having to bring it to the table when I finished basket after basket. As a German, eating is not a pastime - it is a full contact sport.  I was delightfully surprised at the selection - no, it's not huge, but it's everything you need for a great lunch. Butter chicken, naan, chickpeas & curry, rice, a few different beef dishes and that tempura-style veggie stuff that I can't remember the name of.   I left full, mouth zinging, stomach quieted like a newborn rocked to sleep. The service was excellent - a kind lady kept my water glass full.  If you need a hop-in-hop-out bite of Indian, you really can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"I have these weird on and off cravings for Indian food and thankfully I have a gf who has the same problem.  Surya is located on the corner of 11th street SW across from the co-op.  Parking is available on the streets.  Michelle lives around the area so she knew about this place and suggested it.  You walk up a set of stairs before you enter.  There were three of us ladies on a Tuesday night and it was just after 8PM, we were told they closed at 9PM but were still welcomed.  We took a table of four in the corner and were poured water.    When I say I love Indian food, it means I love butter chicken and naan and coconut rice.  It's what I/everyone defaults to..it's just a classic staple! Mmm. Any who, the menu is quite extensive, with vegetarian, chicken, fish, beef, goat, lamb and shrimp dishes.  There are various selections of rice and naan as well as a selection of appetizers, soups and desserts.  We started off with the vegetarian platter followed by an order of butter chicken, shrimp masala, coconut rice and three orders of garlic naan (we love naan and we were hungry).  The vegetarian platter is all deep fried so super healthy cause it's vegetarian ;) it came with pakoras, two samosas, and some cheese sticks with two sides of sauces.  The samosas are delicious, they are generously filled with potato spiced filling.  All the garlic naan came in one basket cut up into quarters and I immediately grabbed a few as they looked mouthwatering and totally were.  The coconut rice was a good size and the butter chicken and shrimp masala appeared to look like small dishes but looks can be deceiving!!  The butter chicken was great, sauce was not too thick and not too thin, perfect for dipping and mixing with rice, chicken was tender.  The masala came with big shrimp pieces with a tomato base sauce and cut up veggies.  As noted above, the main dishes looked small but boy did they fill us up perfectly.  There was even some sauce from the shrimp masala remaining and a bit of rice.  Overall, the service was great - she had two other tables to attend by herself and she was always topping off our waters and asking if everything was good.  The food was really tasty and filling!  I would definitely recommend this place whether you want takeout or if you want to dine in.  Ps. They have dinner buffets on Monday and Wednesdays! Mmmm unlimited Indian food... I will try next time!"}
