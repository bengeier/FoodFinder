{"text":"Love this place! Nice to have something other than pizza or chinese delivered. The owner actually went out and bought caramel they didn't even have on the menu to accomadate my love for hot pretzels with caramel sauce! Thank you to the owner and staff. They're hot chicken,"}
{"text":"Stopped in to check out as we've heard great things.  The local bar feeling comes through and the food is great quality.  The gyro is high quality and much better than most places offer.  The fish sandwich was excellent as well.  Prices are very reasonable and the service is quick, efficient and friendly.  And if you happen to meet one of the owners, like we did,  you'll find they take great pride in offering up the best."}
{"text":"Love the grilled fish and Hummus platter!!! Cozy atmosphere and friendly staff.  :) Took a neighborhood eye sore and turned it into a great experience  for the entire family."}
{"text":"The kitchen staff put 'love' in every meal. Peggy cooks for like you are family. The Gyros are fabulous. I have to admit I've lived in Pittsburgh for nine years and this is the first place that has a steak burger that reminds me of home. A favorite is the hummus platter.  I honestly can not say there has been one meal that I did not enjoy!  The soups are good too! Giving 5 stars because it is a five star place for this type of atmosphere."}
{"text":"Went there today to have a sandwich and a cold one. Ended up meeting \"Big Daddy\". Haha! Great guy. He ended up recommending us some of the house favorites. The gyros were really good. Hard to choice which was my favorite between the Italian hoagie and the Fish sandwich. Great hospitality and service. Totally recommend it!"}
{"text":"Great little place and the food is way better than you would think. Try the cheesesteak. The use great ingredients and it's simply delusions. We've been there twice and I need to expand off the menus. Sausage hogtie is next! Maybe tonight.   Nice people, good beer and excellent food!"}
{"text":"Been here 3 times now and have not had a bad meal. Matter of fact I have had 3 great meals. Had the Rupe Gyro the 1st 2 times and was verrry pleased sans you need to order an extra Tzatziki to complete the experience. Today we had the Gyro Bowl which was a 4+ and the Pig Wings which were just flat out outstanding based on portion size, moistness, flavor and blue cheese dipping sauce (no need to order extra here). This place is just soooo nice in that it is quaint, always friendly staff, reasonable, nice beer selection  and great eats. Hat's off to Rupe and his partner on on their Roadhouse Experiment."}
{"text":"Who knew?! AMAZING gyros. Wonderful steak burgers. A great little place to eat.  Everyone was welcoming and friendly. It's a must try!"}
{"text":"This a great little pub.  The place is very clean, the atmosphere is casual and the food is great.  Service is excellent!  Cold beer and a fish sandwich on a Friday night... It's a 'Burgh thing."}
{"text":"Not impressed with this place at all. I don't generally write reviews, but I feel like this must be said.   The way the staff treated my Coworkers and I was terrible. We called to place an order and everyone we dealt with was absolutely terrible. The woman that answered the phone had a sour attitude and didn't make it seem as if they were interested in our business.  Even the woman that delivered the food to us was rude. Our order was of course messed up, when we called to speak to a manager, we were told there wasn't one available.   Normally I don't care. I understand people have bad days. But bad customer service won't get you anywhere. Why would a business offer delivery, and get irritated when people call to place a lunch order? We will happily call other local restaurants that are happy to have our business."}
{"text":"Have been to Rupe's twice. The first time the food was decent and the drinks reasonable. Service however was poor. Staff at the bar did not seem to care if you were not being waited on. Second time three of us arrived at 10:30 on a Friday night and it was not very busy. Stood at the bar wanting to order three drinks and food. Was ignored several times and the person I perceive as the owner was casually talking to the cook. We left without at purchase. I was hoping to find a nice local bar to frequent, unfortunately this is no the one. Oh well..."}
{"text":"Great place to meet family and friends for a bite to eat or a drink. Simple menu, good food. Service is good and fast. Staff is friendly; with a neighborhood feel. I will visit again."}
{"text":"Rupe's is my favorite local place for date night. The food is consistently good, the service is attentive and friendly, and there's never a long wait. It's also a great place to gather with friends to watch the game. I give it a big thumbs up."}
{"text":"What a great way to start our trip to Pittsburg. Super inviting staff and food was delicious! The manager even stoped by and gave us free couzies and bought a round a shots. If your ever in the area, this is the place to stop by."}
{"text":"Awesome clean place. Had the special, an amazing reuben sandwich with interesting chips for $8. It was freaking delicious. I made sure to compliment the chef. It really was good. Lots of meat and perfectly made."}
{"text":"I stopped by here last Tuesday with my father for lunch.  We had both driven by this location before and never really thought anything of it until recently whenever they began advertising an \"authentic gyro\" on a sign outside.  We arrived at the restaurant shortly after 11 AM to find the place pretty deserted.  My father and I even wondered if it was open until we saw the hours on the door.  Still we were the only people there whenever we walked through the door and I began wondering if we had made a mistake.  While Rupe's is less than impressive on the outside the inside is actually quite nice.  They have a giant U shaped bar with seating all around it and a number of TV's to watch.  For lunch I decided to go with the reason that my father and I had headed there, a gyro while my dad made a game time change and went with the fish sandwich.  As we were waiting for our food more patrons started coming in and by the time we had left Rupe's there were a number of tables filled with business men and women.  My gyro came out with a side of salt and pepper kettle cooked chips.  It tasted quite nicely as the lamb meat was nice and juicy and I enjoyed everything else on it.  My only complaint would be that the one side was a little bit on the dryer side since the tzatziki was all on one half of the sandwich.  My dad also enjoyed his fish sandwich even though it was a bit on the smaller side and he said that he would eat there again.  The bottom line for me is that I will head back to Rupe's again in the future.  I am actually planning on taking my wife down for a happy hour and some food in the near future."}
{"text":"I've been driving Camp Horne Road regularly, (or as regularly as PennDot will let me) for almost five years now. There used to be a little hole in the wall called Mark's on one of the turns. The only reason I remember it was called Mark's was because my boss at the times name was Mark. There wasn't much else memorable about the sad building. But now, WOW.   They have done so much to revamp that place. New exterior, new entrance, and although I can't speak to the old interior, this is really nice! They have a nice sized bar, and plenty of high tops and low seaters. Tv's abound, but it's not super noisy. In traditional Pittsburgh style, memorabilia and jerseys are framed throughout the dining room.   Rupe's had a Groupon going, and for $10 for $20, I decided to treat my parents one night. Dad is a creature of habit, and got the fish and chips. Mom got a pepperoni flatbread, and I tried the gyro bowl. So. Much. Food. Dads fish was baked, really well, just the way he likes it. Mom shared her flatbread with everyone, and I thought it was really good! Crisp and cheesy. What more can you ask for? And my gyro bowl? Amazing. Lettuce, fries, tomato, and more lamb than I knew what to do with. I had to eat the whole thing. (Shame, shame)   Service was good, considering it was happy hour, and we weren't consuming alcohol. We didn't need to ask for refills, and I'm pretty sure everyone working in the bar that night came and brought us napkins and asked how our meals were. Nice!   They just launched a new Groupon, and you bet I'm gonna get another one!   Happy Eating!"}
{"text":"Not your ordinary sports bar! I came here with my mom, and we're helped right away even when they were busy! The food came out in a timely manner, the cleanliness of the bar and dining area was exceptional. The food was great! We can't wait to come back, we were greeted by the owner as well; such a friendly place. The portion sizes were great, filling and not very expensive! Please do  yourself a favor and stop by!"}
{"text":"YUMMY!!!!   Fantastic fish sandwich, great flavor and a toasted bun!!  Hummus platter was great.  Owners were spot on and visited our table.  Excited to go back and try the Gyro"}
{"text":"Horribly slow service -- it even took the server about 10 minutes to bring my credit card back . Food was bland."}
{"text":"Enjoyed our evening at Rupe's new place. We had the special of the day...fish sandwich. Would recommend it highly. Great taste. The best of Rupe's is Rupe! Don't forget to order his Rupe's Reserve. Nice interior, new, fresh and clean. We will be back. Best of luck!!"}
{"text":"Super awesome place ! Hidden in an unsuspecting part of town you wouldn't expect something as nice to be in. Looks great inside and greatest genuine hospitality I've received from a restaurant and it's owners in a while. Made the visit feel super personal, DEF worth you're way out of your path to stop by!"}
