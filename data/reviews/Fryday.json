{"text":"Absolutely delicious!  I had the okono and kimchi poutine and its one of the best poutine I ever had. The interior is modern and inviting. If you are looking for a hidden gem in Calgary, this is the place to be."}
{"text":"Ordered a burger with mexi poutine. The burger was cold and tasteless but was the highlight of the meal. The poutine looked like someone had vomited on the fries, and it didn't taste any better! I advise ppl to stay away from this place, horrible food and the worker there isn't very energetic or personable. Want a good poutine? Than go to Big Cheese!"}
{"text":"I've always been on the look out for a fry only place for well over a decade now, so I figured I may as well drop into Fryday, which incidentally happened to be on a Friday evening.  I ordered the Mexi Poutine to go with the Stavros pizza I just picked up... which I ended up creating the perfect carb-coma Friday night especial.  The Mexi Poutine was pretty good, although I would recommend eating it as soon as it is ready as opposed to taking it home.  I don't think I would be eating poutine on a regular basis, but as a treat once in awhile would work for me."}
{"text":"Your review helps others learn about great local businesses.
I was a poutine virgin up until yesterday.  I've made several trips down east but I've never tried poutine so I was anxious to give it a try.  I was having a bit of trouble deciding but settled on the buffalo chicken poutine.  It was quite good but seemed to have a lot of gravy on it.  I could feel my arteries closing.  I got the large.  While the packaging didn't look huge it was more than enough and I wouldn't say I'm a small eater.  The food was also nice and hot temperature wise.

The place is small the the wait staff was not overly friendly but I'm ok with that."}
{"text":"Went there because we bought the Groupon and their website looks really cute. But what a disappointment! That place is not busy at all. We were there during dinner time for half an hour and we were the only ones there. Thus their food is not fresh at all. The buns for the burger tasted old and hard, the burgers were not good. We also ordered the poutine which we thought that's what it is supposed to be good for, but oh man, it was so bad. The cheese were still cold and the gravy was not enough. The poutine from Costco is much more satisfying. I would not recommend this place and we will not come back."}
{"text":"My son and I stopped in for a bite. Very good! Large pouting will feed an army! Don't go at lunch the place is filled with students from the school ."}
{"text":"An expired groupon brought me here. There was a big sign saying that Fryday fried chicken was finally here so I opted for a small regular poutine and 3 pieces of fried chicken. I was the first customer of the day as I had walked in earlier and they told me they were not open for another 10 minutes.
I'm basically going to tell you what my experience was and you can go and find out for yourself. They have about 3-4 tables with very uncomfortable metal folding chairs. I tried these first and opted to sit at the counter along the wall as the stools were more comfortable. The couple who ordered after me got their order first and left and since they just ordered poutine I wasn't particularly miffed. A few minutes later she brings my poutine and asks if I am staying or whether my order was for take-out so I say I'm staying so she leaves the container of poutine with me and says the chicken will be here shortly. About 10 minutes later the chicken still hadn't arrived and I had already finished my poutine. The chicken arrived a couple of minutes later. At this point I have to wonder, if I had said take-out would that have meant that my container of poutine would have just sat there for the 10-12 minutes while the chicken was cooking and the order packed? 
The chicken was impressively crispy but after the first bite I saw that the pieces were glistening with oil (see photo), and there was a small pool of oil at the bottom of my takeout container. Aside from that flavour and crispiness was fine. The poutine was just ok, the curds sat right on top so didn't really melt from hot gravy being poured over it. The potatoes were not really crispy and already a bit soggy, everything was piping hot except for the curds. I don't think the potatoes were double fried. I don't expect fries to stay crisp in poutine but good fries will retain some crispy edges where the gravy hasn't touched and the whole poutine experience is about contrast, some crispy edges while mostly soaked in gravy with cheese curds slightly melted over the whole mess but the fries were just soggy and the curds sat on top. 
The prices were reasonable, $4.95 for my poutine, $7 for 3 pieces of chicken, I got a whole wing and 2 other boneless pieces of dark meat. 
I found Fryday hard to find if you're driving and trying to look as the sign is fairly small. They are a couple of doors away from the 7-11 on 4 St & 40 Ave NW. There's lots of parking."}
{"text":"That time we buy a couple and get the Japanese style and buffalo favor poutine, and two deep fried ice cream. The taste of poutine is unique. But the deep fried ice cream is disappointed me. I can't find out the different between regular ice cream and this one. When we eat, the deep fried surface is merged with ice cream."}
{"text":"Chicken and poutine were what my kids wanted to eat, so stopped here for a late lunch (late lunch means \"starving\").  Food was really slow but worth it in the end.  Chicken was delicious and nicely seasoned, a step above the regular KFC fare.  Portions were huge.  Poutine had a good balance of fries, gravy and curds."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. We have been looking for Fried Ice Cream for sometime in calgary and every time we think we've found somewhere we are completely disappointed. 

We drove all the way here from the South (fishcreek area) with all 5 kids, mom and grandfather (in two cars). Only to arrive and have there be not even a single Ice Cream scoop available to fry. He showed us a melted pile and said he'd make more but it'd take an hour. Having myself made fried ice cream I know for a fact that the ice cream has to have been scooped, coated and then frozen for a couple hrs to hard enough to not melt when fried. 

We left without having had our special occasion treat. Everyone very disappointed. 

When an item is listed on your menu it should be ready to be provided. 

We will not be returning and will not recommend anyone to travel out of their way to this establishment."}
{"text":"Fryday is definitely one of my favorite restaurants. They have good portions and quality food. The service is very slow, but definitely worth it because of how good the food is. I usually have to wait a good 15 minutes for my poutine, I know its ridiculous. I find the food comes out faster when they are busy, go figure. 
The staff are all really nice overall."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of poutine. Maybe it's my French Canadian roots, or maybe it's just that I can't think of anything better than the marriage of gravy and cheese curds. Either way, when I found out I had moved into a neighborhood that had a poutine restaurant, you better believe I made it a priority to visit. 

My first attempt was a bust. She did acknowledge me when I walked in, but then disappeared to the back before taking my order. After nearly 10 minutes I decided to leave.

The second attempt, now that was a success all the way around. I decided to try one of their double burgers and a small regular poutine. Being a team member from Alberta Burger Fest, I definitely know my way around a burger. Although it wasn't the best I've ever had, it was definitely a lot better than other reviews would lead you to believe. The poutine, though, was excellent. I was worried that the portions might be small, but I was full after and that says a lot. The next day I went back and had their kimchi poutine. I wasn't as big a fan as I was the original poutine, but mostly because the fries were slightly undercooked. The flavors of the toppings were excellent.

Overall I really liked Fryday. If not for my first experience, this would have easily gotten a 4 star."}
{"text":"Got a Groupon for this place a while back. Been trying to find an excuse to use it but haven't had the chance till tonight. 

Sad to report that since their opening their Ramen burger has still not appeared on the menu. And has left the menu altogether. 

Their way of presenting the cutlery and such on an painted oil barrel is cute, but off putting to me as it appears quite messy. I didn't want to touch half the stuff cause it just didn't appear... Clean. 

In an attempt to get my moneys worth on the groupon, I attempted to order a milkis... No milkis for me to get though, staff member said they haven't had it in a while (why put it on the menu). Burgers were expensive!  Got two burgers, a small poutine and a coke. Costed about $27. 

Food took... Forever... To make... I was thinking that this would be a faster food joint. But apparently an order takes more than fifteen minutes to make with me being the only customer at 330pm."}
{"text":"My sister got a great groupon deal for this place so we when to try it out. It came out pretty good. They got lots of different flavors of poutine. Which I think we tried four of their flavors, and I found that the garlic parmesan, buffalo chicken and the kimchi one pretty good. The Okonos was okay, but it wasn't our favorite. Any how some people may like it. It all depends on what you like. Overall, this place has great option for people who want to try anything but the classic poutine. So I do recommend this place."}
{"text":"Tried this place out for dinner.  We had burgers and then tried the cheeseburger and the Buffalo chicken poutines.  The poutines were the definite stars of the show with no consensus on a favourite.  We ordered medium and this was a super generous portion.  We couldn't quite finish everything. Next time I would probably forgo the burger and just chow down on the poutine.  The Mexican looks interesting...."}
