{"text":"Tonight after nearly everything in Kensington Market was closed we saw a glowing light out of this new Sadie's Juice Bar location. Yes, it's open and right next to Hot Beans.  We picked up two Tofutti ice cream cones (they had vanilla, vanilla almond bark, and chocolate) and they were of course delicious. Lots of other options available (like drinks, floats, sweets from the earth treats, and soy delicious bars), but I didn't  pay enough attention because I was too excited about stuffing my face full of my vanilla Tofutti cone. (& the person there was kind enough to let us in after closing, and I didn't want to overstay my welcome)  I'm looking forward to visiting them again during the day!"}
{"text":"For the love of god, please turn off those fluorescent lights. Take notes from the lighting at Hot Beanz! Get some lamps! I promise I will come in 8X more than I do now."}
{"text":"So I've been here a few times. But I'm not going back anymore.   One of the most frustrating things is the fact that their hours aren't on any website, or even posted on their door outside.   Today I saw a man and a woman go in, so I went inside after I finished my other shopping. The man, who worked there, had brought his two dogs in, and they were running around the store. He told me they wouldn't open for another 10 minutes (it was 11:30 on the dot...?) But what I really didn't like was the fact that it was somehow appropriate for two dogs to be running around the store. The place already seems dingy and unsanitary enough, but two dogs running around where the food is prepared? No thanks."}
{"text":"Sadie's makes the perfect stop for dessert after a tasty dinner at Hot Beans!  They carry an assortment of sodas, packaged vegan desserts from local favourites like Sweets from the Earth and, of course, Tofutti ice cream.  Seating is minimal but who really sits down to eat a cone?  Grab a snack and stroll through Kensington Market.  I highly recommend you make that snack an ice cream float.  Go for birch beer with vanilla or, if you're a little more adventurous, orange cream with chocolate.  Delicious and you don't have to take my word for it; my dairy-loving friends agree that Sadie's floats are the bomb.  Rumour has it that hot chocolate topped with mounds of marshmallow fluff and steamy bowls of chili will be available in the colder months with homemade vegan icecream showing up once the weather heats up again.  Looking forward to it!"}
