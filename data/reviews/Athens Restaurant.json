{"text":"This is one of my favourite eating spots if my mom or grandmother did not cook on the weekend.  I like the cozy small feel of this restaurant.  A very authentic greek cuisine here.   I usually order the lamb special which is my favourite dish here.  The food is served fairly quickly for this type of restaurant.   It gets very busy on the weekends so I would suggest bringing a friend or family to kill the time while you wait for the food or bring a good book or magazine.  My only pet peeve is sometimes they are out of something on the menu that I want. Otherwise a great place to eat authentic greek food."}
{"text":"I've started coming here almost weekly now, the food is like just good old home cooked meals your mom or grandmother would make. You can even go into the kitchen and check out what the chef made that day and pick out your meal. 

This restaurant truly beats all the other Greek restaurants on Danforth between Broadview and Pape - that caters towards the non-Greeks. You want authentic Greek food, then you must come here."}
{"text":"Traveled all the way from Mississauga to this place, in the hope of a delicious Chicken Souvalaki. Amazing food, traditional set-up, hospitable environment. Five star on all counts. On entering the joint, I was ushered into Kitchen to show varieties and preparations. Innovative and confident way of attracting and retaining customer base. Chicken was as tender as it could get. Last few experiences with Greek food near my residence have been below par, so I could clearly make out the difference. Would again go to this place very soon."}
{"text":"I walked in knowing what I wanted and felt at their insistance, I had to look in the kitchen at what they had prepared....ok thank you very much.
Back to the table and the menu:
No spinach-cheese pie.
No veggie mousaka.
Ok, no moussaka.
No bean soup.
Ordered avgolemono soup and waited so long, I think they whipped it up.
No galaktoboureko.
They didn't have any classic Greek dishes on hand.
Why don't they just do a blackboard of what they have prepared instead of torturing people with a menu of food they don't have.
Wierd."}
{"text":"The cook was great, introduced himself, and took us into the kitchen to show us what he was offering that night! Some ordered off the menu, some ordered the meatball special. Everyone was very happy with the entrees, and the appetizers where even more delicious! Big servings, very authentic and lots of taste! 

Our server was above average, we were a group of 10, and I would say she did alright! 

The overall vibe was great, nothing pretentious, which was surprising because of the area. Very welcoming and very very friendly. Decent price, overall we all left very full, large take out bags and very happy."}
{"text":"I've been living in this city's east end for almost 22 years, I have yet to eat better Greek food than this. I went to Greece once (for 3 months) and this place serves the closest food to that I was eating in small caf√©s. This place definitely has a regular customer base, but is no stranger to newcomers and welcomes them warmly. I have never had a bad experience here."}
{"text":"A non-descript typical Greek taverna hang-out. However, having said that I have always found that if all I wanted was just a good size steak, greek salad and a glass of wine this is the place. Usually being the only non-greek in the place I always seem to get personalized service."}
{"text":"This is the best Greek restaurant outside of Greece. If you have the opportunity to eat here don't miss it."}
{"text":"Wow.... good food here.  This place doesn't look like much, I have to say.  And it was a bit hot inside, I can imagine as the summer warms up, so will this place.   The food did take a little while to come, and I didn't quite understand what our options were.  When we were seated, the waitstaff asked us if we wanted a menu or if we wanted the daily specials we should speak to the chef.  We didn't know what we wanted so we opted for the menu.  Those more familiar with the place seemed to understand and ordered specials which came out much faster then our cooked to order requests.  Lesson learned.  I had the chicken souvlaki dinner which was HUGE.  It came with an amazing greek salad to start and then I substituted cooked veggies for the potatoes.  For $14 it was an amazing amount of food that you could easily have shared between two people.

Loved it.  Loved my leftovers.  Would definitely return."}
{"text":"Had excellent grilled octopus, meatball, Greek salad and stuffed peppers. We requested all as appetizers. It was wonderful. Will go back for sure."}
{"text":"Such amazing Greek food . A huge amount in a take out tray for 10+ tax. Amazing food."}
{"text":"My husband and I have tried almost everything on the menu and we are never left disappointed. It's family owned and we are definitely treated like family every time we dine there. The Village salad is amazing, calamari and lamb chops are hands down the best. You can walk to the back where the kitchen is located and choose one of the daily specials if you want to try something a little different. All I can say is this place is one of the best on the Danforth!"}
{"text":"Big WAW the grilled octopus, Greek Salad, Tarama and the cattle dish with spinach really un comparable must try"}
{"text":"This place is authentically Greek. Great food, huge portions, and great prices. You can even go in the back and see the daily specials. I highly recommend!! My favorite plate was the grilled calamari - they give you a huge delicious piece of it.  And delicious house red wine."}
{"text":"Pretty good small joint! Never really noticed this place but was looking for greek food late at night and saw this on yelp. Dont judge the place from outside, it's very cozy and nice inside. The food was great - grilled kalamari, pork tenderloin, greek salad- all standard greek fare but worth it to me. Big servings. Pork tenderloin nice and juicy, kalamari tender and tasty. Wpuld def come back for late night eats! Best part is the staff- very friendly, and the boss (I'm assuming, big man) is very friendly and outgoing! Environment makes this place. Also cool is that they have daily specials and they invite u to the kitchen to have a look ! Such cool idea."}
{"text":"My first time eating in Danforth and it was great!

Didn't try the moussaka which is my usual order for Greek, so I have something to come back for.

We had the gyro platter, souvlaki, and special sun-dried tomatoes fish. It was all pretty great.

The gyro is odd since it's served like steak instead of thinly sliced. Still good.

Generally the food seemed to have oil drizzled on top but wasn't greasy. Not sure how they walked that line.

They do have highchairs."}
{"text":"Just ok.  Reviews set high expectations...but found the food to be very average. Ordered the lamb dinner and it was tough, while the octopus was average. Wound up going to Libretto's for pizza and dessert . The evening ended well. Amen!"}
{"text":"Amazing Greek food!   First of all they have a great vinegar and an amazing olive oil on the table when you come in.   They give you a lovely fresh bread to go with it too.  Also their veggies are an amazing quality - especially considering it is March right now.   Perfect salads and oh my G-d is it ever hard to find these!   For the main dish we had a totally amazing gyros and souvlaki dinners and the meat was perfect.   The restaurant also had really great Greek wine which I am pretty sure is not available in too many places here.  I definitely recommend this place- perfect if u ask me"}
{"text":"This is one of the interesting foodie excursions we've experienced in a while.

From the outside looks like another small diner/bar. It is away from the area where many of its compatriot eateries are located. Anyways, when we step in we come across older Greek men hanging out, drinking, eating, and bantering with George- the proprietor- at the bar. Now George is the secret sauce of this establishment, he is the rotund cheerful and gregarious 2nd generation owner of this joint. He encourages us to head into the kitchen to check out the specials .....in we walk and the equally happy go lucky cook/chef gives us the low down on how to order. Everything looked good (calamari rice, stuffed pepper, veal stew, chicken cutlets, lamb chops). We failed to make a reservation, so did take out and decided to hang out at the bar, which is great for ppl watching. I think George knows all the patrons, everyone was exchanging kisses and greetings in Greek. Definitely had the feel of being in a neighbourhood bar in Europe. Noticing we were waiting for our food, George offered us complimentary drinks and takes the time to chat us up. Finally, we get our food so we head out. Despite being crazy busy, George catches up to us outside and thanks us for coming by!

Sure this place is small, the waiters are not articulate, and service can be slow. But they do not detract from the food and ambience, which had a feel good homey feel to it. Definitely will return. It is one of the best Greek restaraunts we've eaten at. It lives upto its reputation as a hidden gem!

If you care more about your Instagram feed you go to Mamakas, if you want to kickback with friends you come here."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. It's one of the smaller Greek restaurants on Danforth and has a more authentic feel to it compared to its neighbours.

You can either order off the menu or walk into the kitchen where the chef will walk you through the prepped specials for the day. These consists of very non-typical menu items that you don't usually see at most Greek restaurants.

The service is great, the portions are huge and the prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"This place is the single place I've found authentic delicious Greek food aside from my mother's cooking. It's inexpensive too and cooked fresh daily. You go back in the kitchen, see the daily specials and get an explanation of what the dishes are. I gave it 5stars. Don't go there for the decor and it looks a bit grungy but the foid is worth it!"}
{"text":"The food was amazing! Nothing disappointed. Everything had a homemade taste. Service was friendly and prompt. It's a must try!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Thursday night and it was fairly busy.

Pros: 
- Nice ambiance
- Good service
- They take you in the kitchen to show you the current specials.
- Good portions
- Food tastes good

Cons:
- Pricey for the quantity offered"}
{"text":"I'm giving this restaurant a 4 star review only because it was out of the grilled calamari and the lamb special, both of which I really had my heart set on.

It's a small place, not much to look at from the outside but the service here is excellent. I called ahead to make reservations for 4 as I wasn't sure how busy they would be for dinner. When I walked in I was greeted very jovially and seated immediately. Our server came over with menus and talked about the specials. We got to go in kitchen to see what the specials looked like and sadly the last serving on lamb had just been selected. We ended up ordering the fried calamari, the lamb shanks and the Greek feta plate (strongly recommended to all my cheese lovers!). The other dishes were okay but again not what I had originally intending on trying. The portions are a decent size and the prices are on par with offerings in the Danforth area. 

They don't do dessert here so if you're looking for a treat after a good meal head over to Athens Pastries just down the street. 

I would return again but maybe for lunch so I don't miss out on the good dishes."}
{"text":"The food was absolutely delicious and I will be going there again. Loved the chicken slouvaki dinner. Plus the service was amazing. George is the best!"}
{"text":"This is a small restaurant but the food is the reason for coming here. They have an open kitchen table where you can look at the cooked food prepared fresh each day by their chef or you can order from the menu.

The quality of the food is excellent and you get good value for your money.

We have made this our go to place when we are not in the mood to cook dinner and we know we will have a great meal here!"}
{"text":"Had just arrived in town and came in on a whim to grab dinner.  Sat at the bar and waited patiently for 15 minutes without being acknowledged or otherwise looked at... The 'host' even took a menu off another table once they were done ordering, and put it away 5 ft away from me, instead of handing it to me.  Would not recommend"}
{"text":"Disgusting! I went based on Yelp reviews but arrived to find a run down, filthy restaurant. Not sure if reviews were set up. Would not even sit in there. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"This is one of the best Greek cuisine I have tried in town. 
Had a Greek salad witch was so delicious and their day special lamb -amazing! Place is cozy and clean, can't wait to be back to try other things on the menu !"}
{"text":"Seriously can I not give more than 5 stars !?!

Amazing place, the food was incredible. It was really cool how we were allowed to go to the kitchen where the chef told us about his daily specials.

Ordered chicken souvlaki (nice touch how the skewer was already removed) the chicken was very juicy and tender. It was cooked to perfection. The portion size is quite big. The potatoes melted in the mouth like butter, I'm still shocked the potatoes were able to keep a nice shape considering how soft they were. The Greek salad came on a side plate with a block of feta on top and had just the right amount of dressing. Tzatziki ... wow!

Overall this place was so great, it had that authentic touch to it and it was obvious the chef took great pride in his work. Seems like a family run business which just makes it that much better. Will be stopping there prior to leaving the east coast one more time, it was just that good!"}
{"text":"Rarely travel to this part of The danforth for Greek food and regrettably, because everyone knows your go to spot for Greek is this area. I never seem to be in that craving mood for Greek so that probably has a lot to do with it. This little gem, however, was opened at 11pm on a Monday night when that sudden urge for Greek food finally hit me. 

The restaurants look, is so beautiful, from the art on the walls to the physical design of the restaurant, it really gives you an authentic feeling of what it would be like if you were in Greece. 

The food, nothing short of fantastic. Although slightly intoxicated when going to this restaurant, I did order a chicken souvlaki to go for my girlfriend and she most definitely swears by it. The server was very friendly and brought me and my friend a large portion of bread, which they refill for free might I add, paired along with really high quality olive oil and balsamic vinegar. It was amazing. Portions for food are also extremely reasonable given that for 2 people spending less than 35$ were sufficiently full. One more reason this restaurant deserves a 5 star rating is their tzatziki. Unlike other restaurants that only give a tiny portion of this magical sauce, this place doesn't skimp out at all! Plus it's homemade! Can it get any better!

This place is fant"}
{"text":"Returned a month later. If I could give more than 5 stars I would. This will be my go to restaurant for Greek food. Entertained guests at this last visit to Athens and guests were every bit as impressed with food, service, ambiance, etc. as I was."}
{"text":"EXCELLENT!!!! 

I went here on a Saturday night and had one of the best services at Athens. 

(Make reservations it had about 15 tables) 

When you first arrive the hostess will invite you back to the kitchen to check out the specials. It looked very tasty. That night was stuffed peppers and lamb shanks. 

I got the pork Slovaki meal with an appetizer of calamari...first with the app. The squid was very good. I assume it was frozen but you would never know. It was top of the line....next was the dinner..wow...pork had a ton of flavour and the potion was more than average. rice and potatoes were slow cooked and were soft. Excellent!!!!

Once the meal was done the owner (George) came by to other tables to check on the food/service. When he arrived to mine he offered and insisted to buy cake for me and my guest. I said no but he really wanted to offer...cake was fantastic!! I wasn't sure what kind it was but all food looked and tasted great. 

I will always recommend and go back here. Not far from the subway."}
{"text":"The danforth obviously has lots amazing Greek restaurants and this is one. The value is there for sure. The come into the kitchen to see the specials is different. 
Had the roasted lamb special small village salad and a stuffed pepper. It was all shared and capped off with coffee dessert and a brandy. Service was good easy going vibe. I would have liked a bit more veggies with the main but overall it was a solid choice with an open late kitchen."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING. I didn't get a chance to read the reviews before I went so I wasn't sure what to do when I got there. So for anyone going please read this...

Arriving at the restaurant for dinner around 5:00 pm, we waited at the front to be seated for a while...The place is small and a number of the tables were actually seated already by families. We were debating to leave after a while when no one came but finally the waiter came by and told us we could sit anywhere we wanted. Again, we waited a while to get menus and water to the point where we were about to leave cause it took so long..then the waiter came by and dropped off menus and said for the specials go into the kitchen and ask the chef.

We looked through the menus quickly and then decided we should just go ask for the specials and you literally WALK INTO the kitchen and the chef shows you what he cooked for the day! There were about 4-5 options we could've chosen and for dinner meals they all come with rice and potatoes. We ended up ordering the lamb (omg get the lamb) and the veal (SOO tender! :O) and the greek salad. Bread was served at the beginning with vinegar and olive oil.

Oh my gosh everything was soooo goood!!! You can even order all the entrees and get rice on the side. This restaurant is really a gem! You must try it!! 

TL;DR: Literally walk into the kitchen and order whatever the specials the chef made for the day!! You will not be disappointed! :D"}
{"text":"This is a great authentic Greek restaurant. It is not pretentious either in the locale or in the service, but the cooking shines.

We invited to the kitchen, before ordering, to see that offering there were in addition to the items on the menu. The ladies each chose a fish (sea bream and sea bass), and I chose Stuffed Peppers the other gentleman chose Lamb stewed in tomatoes.

We shared an appetizer of feta cheese and a couple of small plates of TREMENDOUS black and green olives. The bread was a high quality French type bread, not that wilted hastily toasted offering in other restaurants on the Danforth.

I had a Fish Soup before my main course and it delicious. Great broth, plenty of nice fish chunks, and a light pleasant taste....a real find.

The other gentleman had a green salad while the ladies shared a Horiatiki Salad. I taste both and found them both excellent. Finally a restaurant that does not bathe salad in oil.

My dish,  the stuffed peppers was succulent. The medley of rice and meat and the sweetest of the peppers really elevated this dish. The Sea Bass and Sea Bream were all exceptional, grilled and seasoned to perfection. Neither of the ladies eat fish heads it was a real bonus for me. The lamb was good but not great, and this started to provide a 'drag down' on a potential 5 star rating.

The ladies ordered an espresso each, as this really genuine Greek establishment does not have Greek coffee. They had very few desserts, just Tiramisu and Flan. This combined with the lamb got me to 4 stars. 

The place is much as Lauren described it. Its very homey, local with a lot of Greek dudes. On leaving my wife said she would happily come here once a week for fish. From Mrs. G. this is high accolades indeed."}
{"text":"A great start wen the server drops a bottle of balsamic and a carafe of olive oil with some extremely fresh bread at your table. I wanted a light lunch since I had a big dinner party later, so I fought back the urge to devour the bread. 

Before ordering, the host invited me to step into the kitchen to see the specials. They all looked amazing, but I knew they would be massive portions. 

I ordered chicken souvlaki, thinking it would be a manageable lunch, but I say \"nay nay\"!  The first thing out was the Greek salad. A whole plate of Greek salad. With a 1/3 pound of feta cheese on top. I planned to end at halfway through. 

Then came the main, a healthy portion of perfectly tender and juicy chicken, with a massive amount of lemon roasted potatoes and rice pilaf, accompanied by a perfectly fresh, homemade tsatziki.   Normally, I focus in the protein and pass on most of the carbs. This time I started with the potatoes. I never do that!!

A sliver of chicken that I knocked off the plate, and I almost dove to retrieve it off of the carpet. 

I gave up halfway through. I never do that either!  The gracious host packed me a doggie bag bigger than most meals."}
{"text":"Family owned restaurant and you get treated like family.
The food was delicious the calamari was perfect and the moussaka was the best I have ever tasted.
Well done.
If you are unfamiliar with the cuisine they will take you back to the kitchen and show you the food that is being cooked you can chose your dinner from the kitchen or the menu.
We recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"20 minutes for the cheque, service is substandard. Gyros on a pita was alright. Would not go again."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious food! Unlike other restaurants in this area this place is very authentic and homey, and that's what I like about it. Yes, service could've  been a little faster, but...This is such a small thing so it doesn't matter.Besides, the food is so good, I don't mind waiting a little. Yeah.. And the it really cheap)
I just wish they were located closer to where I live so I can come more often)"}
{"text":"Darling daughter, handsome husband and little ol' me had just finished a side-splitting session of Laughter Yoga nearby and were in a happy but hungry mood. I turned on Yelp to see what good eats were in driving vicinity. Athens Restaurant came up on the radar.

I've been to Athens (Greece!) twice and have some knowledge of Greek food. DD just visited this past summer and enjoyed her meals there. I must say that we were very pleased with the food quality and preparation!

Loved the taramasalata, warm pita, Greek feta and grilled calamari. Also loved going to the kitchen to meet the chef and see his daily specials. We chose the stewed okra and stuffed peppers. 

At the adjacent table, a Greek family was chowing down on a pile of mouthwatering lamb chops. Next time, we'll get those plus some paidakia."}
{"text":"I went to Greece for an hour this weekend and came back!!

Mind you we went at around 12:30AM.. A friend of ours who is also Greek said I'm going to take you guys somewhere.... and if you can get passed the stare downs from the men, and the decor then you're ok. It turned out EXACTLY what he described but we didn't care we came to have some Greek Food .. I was waiting to get my hands on some saganaki and lamb.

Upon arrival we were greeted like family, said hi to the pleasant owner who for some reason I just wanted to call him uncle... right off the bat I was liking this place even before sitting down.
 
Attention all newbies to Athen's... if you're waiting for a menu to be presented to you don't really bother, I mean you can ask for one (I think) but what's the fun in that when you can go straight to the back and chit chat with the kitchen staff and the chef, you get to order straight to him!!! I thought that was awesome!.... as soon as we saw our friend walk to the kitchen we  followed.. they spoke in Greek and we just stood there mesmerized and excited. 

HERE WE GO!!!! OPA!

We all shared the dishes that were ordered for 4 people

First dish- The Saganaki- Delicious simply delicious- I Don't know if you could really mess up flaming cheese.

The Greek Village salad- I LOVED- Fresh ripe tomatoes with cucumbers, homemade feta, Greek oregano, onions and Greek olive oil... unlike any other Greek village salad, I especially enjoyed the veggies all being at semi room temp so you could really get the full taste of salad.. I personally hate super cold tomatoes or cucumbers in salads... find it takes the taste of the actual vegetable.

Sliced deep fried Zucchini and potatoes- sliced thin coated with a bit of seasoned batter... the zucchini is a must try... a bit oily but it's really good..

and finally.........

The Lambchops- Succulent pieces of chop grilled and perfectly seasoned, each piece was juicy and full of meat..

While we all enjoyed our delicious dishes... Fine Greek tunes played in the background and you would hear the opa's and the finger snaps... Made the meal and experience super fun.

The food comes in big portions so they're all great for sharing- we each had 3 pieces of lamb and still with all the things we had in between I think 3-4 were left to take home.

Will definitely be back and next time I'll take pictures before devouring the whole thing."}
{"text":"Given the fact that I just came back from Greece a month ago, I ALMOST felt like I was whisked right back.  It's those damn Greek chairs! lol  When you walk in, you are welcomed with dim lighting and Greek music.  Also, the menu is exactly how it would be in Greece.  

I was beyond hungry coming here, hungry to the point where you feel sick.  So that kinda threw me off and I couldn't truly enjoy my experience. Still, I forced myself to eat. As you may have read in the reviews (and it says right on their menu), they take you to the kitchen to show you the specials of the day.  One of the specials was Fasolakia, which are green beans cooked in tomato sauce, so I had to get a side order of it.  I love it!  I also ended up just getting a single pork skewer and my boyfriend got the chicken souvlaki dinner.

They serve complimentary bread which was really good according to my boyfriend.  The thing that surprised me the most was that they actually give you a personal horiatiki as your salad that's included in your meal.  No other Greek restaurants, that I have been to in the GTA, do this. It was a good serving.  Enough for two people.  Taste and presentation were on point. Although, tomatoes here can't compare to how they are in Greece. All the food came out fairly quick.  We were in and out in under an hour.  The pork and chicken souvlaki were delicious and very juicy.  Tzatziki was on point as well.  Potatoes included in the dinner were soft and flavourful.  The only complaint from the both of us was the rice.  Nothing special at all, in fact pretty bland.  

Despite feeling so sick on my visit here, I still think the place deserves 4 stars.  I would return here if I was really feigning for Greek food.  Tastes are as authentic as their Greek chairs.  It doesn't get realer than that."}
{"text":"I'd give this place 3.5 stars if I could, and this rating shows my confusion with it. Athens Restaurant is good, but it's almost like it should be better. Let me explain:

You enter the restaurant and it's like you're transported to Greece. From the cheerfully loud and vibrant Greeks that run the place to the chairs and tables that looks exactly like the ones in the actual Athens, the mood and decor transport you to another world. On top of this, there's the \"experience\" of heading to the back kitchen to see what's available for the day - fun, unique, but above all, makes you feel like you're being welcomed into a Greek home. This place oozes with charm and, dare I say, even a touch of magic. 

And so when the food comes, your expectations are so high. And let me say this first: The food is good. The saganaki was fried well, the octopus had great texture/taste, the moussaka was full and hearty, etc. It's just that I was expecting something more. Or maybe more precisely, something different. For while Athens Restaurant is better than many of the Greek restaurants I've tried in Toronto, it's not a lot better, let alone truly different/outstanding. 

So 3.5 stars is a reflection of my confusion with this charming place/experience that raised my expectations, and the food that was good but not magical."}
{"text":"My girlfriends and I came to visit Toronto and we were staying in Greek town. We decided to eat after a day of travel into town from Chicago and this place was among some of the best food we have ever eaten. We shared the spicy feta stuffed peppers which the lovely waitress recommended to eat with a drizzle of olive oil and it was divine. We had the gyro plate which was unlike American gyros with pita, but instead was served with a fresh Greek salad and lemon potatoes. We also got the lamb dinner special which literally fell off the bone because it was so tender. And we also got a sort of Greek lasagna with a rich white bechamel sauce. The service was super friendly and very attentive. We got to see the kitchen and saw everything that the chef prepared for the days specials which only made our mouths water more than they already were. Prices were very affordable as well. We left with an incredible impression and longing to take this incredible family owned business home with us."}
{"text":"As good as it gets! Stepping into the kitchen to see the specials was eye-opening. George the Owner served us. \"The Best Looking And Tasting Tomatoes In The City\"  This place is where Greeks come to eat Greek food. . #WeWereTheOnlyCanadiansInThePlace"}
{"text":"Firsttime here. Excellent! Warm and welcoming even when it's almost 4pm 
Roast lamb, lamb shank, the cows feet soup, spanakopita were all delicious! 
Great service. Reasonable 
Would love to come again. 


Happy Victoria's Day!"}
{"text":"Food: (5 stars)
They got a few specials every day which has limited quantity.  To see the specials you actually walk into the kitchen to talk directly to the chef.  Every time I got the special I was extremely satisfied. The cost of the specials is around $20.  
The items from the menu are all really good: Calamari (both grilled and fried), octopus, dips, greek salad (With huge pieces of feta cheese), Saganaki cheese (grilled cheese with a shot and lemon poured over it). 
The only thing I was not a huge fan of was fried Zucchini.  

The classic dinners are very large: salad, potato, rice and meet.  Ordering appetizers and a full dinner will be too much.  I would suggest getting an appetizer, 2 skewers and a full dinner for 2 people to share.

Service: (5 stars)
Very friendly, and attentive.

Atmosphere: (4 stars)
A smaller/cozy restaurant.  Can fit about 30 people total.   They got a small patio, but its on the busy street and can fit about 6 people."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious lunch.  We shared a Greek salad, gyro, and braised lamb.  The land was a daily special.  It fell apart as we served it - so tender.  We left stuffed with another meals worth of leftovers.

We will definitely be back.  There are about 9 additional menu items that I'd like to try."}
{"text":"The food was really good, very big portions and AMAZING homemade taziki sauce.  The only drawback was the frieswere way too Greasy, but in all the meal was awesome and the servers were very friendly, the owner even came by to each table to say hello and it was a really busy night that night as well."}
{"text":"Athens restaurant is always a pleasure to dine at, located on the Danforth in Greek town this cozy restaurant is serving up some authentic Greek cuisine which is not to be missed. When I say authentic I mean food that detours from the usual Greek salad, Grilled fish, Fried calamari, etc even though those items are available (and very very good) here that is not what I go there for. I go to this restaurant so that I can walk into the back room and ask the chef what they have left. If I am lucky they will have some stews left that will most likely contain veal or beef and then I will also order an entire fish which they grill with lemon, filet and season with olive oil. Athens is one of those restaurants that you can go to any time and it won't break your bank, you can have a drink with the owner (I suggest retsina) who is my fathers good friend and eat a nice meal. This has become one of my if not my favorite Greek restaurant in Toronto due to the relaxed atmosphere and the unconventional menu that shines like a diamond in the rough compared to other Greek restaurants in Toronto. Any time I want to be reminded of how I ate in the hills outside of Fira in Santorini, I will go here and eat some meatballs or whatever is good. Thank you for always treating me with such respect, I will be back soon."}
{"text":"I have found the BEST LAMBCHOPS ever at Athens Restaurant. If you are a lambchop fan, it's worth a trip here for the chops. OMFG!

Athens Restaurant is a family owned taverna style dining spot. The patrons here are pretty much all local old Greek dudes.  Moro mu is friends with the owner, otherwise it's the type of place I never would have wandered into.

Can't say much for the service as we were picking up food to go.

The grilled lambchops are just ridiculous, what can I say! They are marinated in some kind of lemon and olive oil glaze, a bit salty and nice oregano taste too. We had them with a nice Greek salad and these insanely good sliced and roasted potato wedges sprinkled with Parmesan cheese."}
{"text":"A little restaurant in Greek Town on a busy street with wonderfully friendly staff,  chef and owner!

We loved this little hole in the wall that seemed to host the local Greek population.
Chicken Souvlaki, Gyro (yum), calamar and deal we're ALL delicious.
Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"A place I would not bring a first date to but for sure a second date if she was easy going. 

Hands down best Greek food on the Danforth. Need I say more?"}
{"text":"A Great spot for Authentic Greek Food.  Is A must to walk in the kitchen to check the special of the day.  Lamb Choriatiko is one of my favorites. portions are big and food always fresh and tasty. Even not big  fan of fried food I love it here because they don't use deep friers. Love the extensive Greek wine list that every time I find something new and interesting. The Cabernet from mega spileo was fantastic. Definitely recommended if you are looking for a cosy no prententious place with amazing food."}
{"text":"Unbelievable.   Incredible.   Awesome!   Amazing! OMG!!! 

Best greek that I've EVER HAD.   And I've eaten at most Greek restaurants on the Danforth!! 

And they really DO let you go to the kitchen to see the specials... I felt just like the prime minister!!! 

I had the Horiatiki salad.   Never had it before.   Incredible!   You must try it! 

They have awesome bread, with olive oil AND GREEK balsamic vinegar... No idea that the Greeks MADE balsamic!!   Well,  I  sure do now!! 

Village lamb was truly a STANDOUT! 

Comes with the yummy roast potatoes..... Red peppers.   Yummy cheese on top. 

And a smokin hot waiter, who, frankly, looks like a freaking model! Oopa!!!! 

Lovely owner too! 

Where the heck is \"you gotta eat here\"???

{"text":"Hands down the best Greek food I have ever had. The restaurant was small and authentic, we truly felt like we were in a small family restaurant in Greece. Amazing service and unbelievable food. We started with the fried zucchini and grilled calamari, both were outstanding. Our mains were the lamb special and gyro plate and we loved them. Greek salad was unbelievable, so was the homemade tzatziki.

The outside appearance keeps this gem nice and hidden,  thank you for the amazing meal."}
{"text":"Service was pretty bad, had to ask 3 times for a menu (a bit understandable since it was a busy night). Not sure why they ask you to check their daily specials in the back either. 
Food quality more than makes up for it, though."}
{"text":"We were recommended to this restaurant 3 years ago by a Greek neighbour. It did not disappoint. The food is delicious. We have had Mother's Day celebrations there. We have taken many friends there friends and they really love it, often asking to make that a choice when we go out. George, the owner is very welcoming. The Greek tomato and feta salad is the best I have had. The tomatoes are amazing. There are always specials. You can go back to the kitchen where the chef will explain what they are. We love the veal, the veal casserole, lamb to name a few. Dessert is always delicious."}
