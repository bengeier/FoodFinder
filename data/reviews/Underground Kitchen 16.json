{"text":"I ordered the naan, jackfruit kofta and mixed veggies with spinach from this restaurant a few days ago and I was very pleased with the portion and taste! I will certainly order again!"}
{"text":"I ordered they're food from UberEATS, usually uber eats doesn't make food the best because of the wait time and loss of freshness with the food. However I've ordered Indian food multiple times from there and the flavour is never altered by UberEATS.  I ordered my usual a butter chicken and some type of chicken wrap along with a dessert and mango juice. None of it tasted good, I tried to make it all work but I could take more than a few bites.  The butter chicken tasted more of a tamarind curry, nothing like butter chicken. All the food had chunks of ginger in it that you could bite not just for the flavour.  This is not authentic Indian food, and honestly doesn't taste good regardless of what kind of food it is."}
{"text":"I ordered from this restaurant on Foodora, and I really didn't enjoy any aspect of it. The samosas were very greasy (so greasy that the bottom half of the brown paper bag was soaked), the basmati rice had spilled all over (it had been packed in the weirdest way), the curry was very oily and the chicken was undercooked, and the yellow lentil daal was wayyy too runny. I threw out maybe 80% of it. Won't order again."}
{"text":"So glad I discovered this place. Indian restaurant running out of the kitchen at Crown and Tiger. Take out only for lunch and dine-in when the bar opens at 5. I was looking for an indian place for lunch since I work in the area and this  place is exactly what I've been looking for! Nice flavourful curries. Lots of veggie options. Reasonable prices. Fast! I also love that they do combo meals for $10-$12. A lot of indian restos you have to order each curry and your rice separately, which ends up being expensive if you're just grabbing food for yourself. Will order again :)"}
