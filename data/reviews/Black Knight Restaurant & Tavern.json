{"text":"BUGS IN THE COFFEE

My friend and I ducked in and sat down and instantly regretted it, but wanted to stay to be polite. 

The food on the other tables looked really poor, and the elderly waitress didn't seem very interested, in addition to not being very good at speaking English. 

We ordered the cheap breakfast, and 2 coffees....at which point my friend spooned one small insect out of his black coffee, and then another.  Deal breaker. 

He was good enough to leave a small tip, but we left before the food came without saying a word.  Neither of us felt comfortable trying to explain the situation to an elderly lady.  Ducked into Caledonia next door which was much better, though a little pricy. 

Why do businesses open if they're not going to give a shit?  Isn't there any easier way to flush time and money down the toilet."}
{"text":"For a small place the breakfast here is delicious. It's fresh and for $5.00.  What a deal. Two eggs toast coffee tomatoes."}
{"text":"Police just raided this place......10 people in handcuffs. Closed Down!"}
{"text":"Very happy with the $5(including tax) all day breakfast deal. 2 eggs, bacon, lettuce/tomatoes, potatoes, and coffee. Very fast service! I sat by the open window to enjoy the morning air."}
{"text":"Walked in and didn't expect much for $5 breakfast. Got a full plate of eggs bacon home fries toast. Freshly cut fruit. Tasted amazing. Highly recommend. George gave me free refills of coffee. Move over Cora's breakfast. This place will take it out. Any day of the week."}
{"text":"Good for a cheap breakfast or souvlaki. Awful customer service. One of the tables is a pac-man machine you can play while you eat/wait to be ignored. Get what you pay for. It's OK."}
{"text":"I really want to give this place a good review - typically I like greasy spoons (I mean really what's not to like?) and more so I'd like to advocate for small businesses, but this place just sucks.

The food is terrible, the service is worse and you can taste the resentment in each bite. The only thing this place has going for it is that it is tres cheap..."}
{"text":"This is a great cheap dive breakfast for those days when your wallet can't afford mitzis or boom but yet you are too hung over to make yourself some eggs. 2 people can eat here with coffee for under $10. the breakfast special 2 eggs bacon, sausage or ham and potatos will run you $4.25 includes coffee. If this place isn't a deal I dunno what is. 

There is something about a mom and pop dive that always warms my heart a little."}
{"text":"Came in for the breakfast special on a weekday about 10 AM.  The meal was fine, especially for $5.  It was just... pale. Beige toast, white potatoes, pastel -looking eggs, almost white lettuce, the bacon looked like it might disappear it was almost clear, the tomato was barely blushing. I admit I added cream to my coffee, but it was unintentional that it fit in with the decor of the meal.  If you don't mind a cheap, colorless food, this place is for you.  Looks like the place has a lot of regulars who go for it as all the tables were full when we left."}
{"text":"I actually can't believe I forgot to review this place. This review is now about 9 months late but given the aged environment that makes us the Black Knight, I would be surprised if anything has changed.

I visited this place on a Saturday morning back in the spring. We decided to go sit in the back as it seemed like we could at least be a bit tucked away from the locals drinking coffee in the front. This is one of those places that you can see hasn't changed since the days when smoking was allowed indoors. Everything was yellow and aged, and the tables have a yellowed glass pane on the tables, complete with chips and cigarette burns.

We ordered the breakfast combo, and while the food wasn't terrible tasting, little things spoke volumes. Questionably clean cutlery, and things like the breakfast sausages, where instead of receiving the normal 3 pieces of meat, was delivered with 2 little breakfast sausages that were cut in half, to create the illusion of 4 pieces of meat.

It may be cheap, but I'd rather go hungry than try this place again."}
{"text":"It's January 2, 2017 - business have weird hours. Saw they had a sign advertising all day breakfast. To be respectful of their time, I called to find out what time they closed and received a \"Who's this?\" . My reply \"A customer calling to find out what time you close\" person's response \"I don't know na\". I hung up. Without stepping a foot in this establishment, I believe the other reviewers complaints about customer service. Sorry Black Knight - no longer on my list of places to try - such a shame the restaurant Aziza on Dovercourt wasn't closer to where I lived :("}
{"text":"Whoah, this place has got  some pretty bad reviews! To me, it was alright. I used to frequent this place with my best friend and judging by the posts below me, the \"all-day breakfast\" has hiked up in price again. 
I can't speak of the other dishes but I've always had the breakfast which was not too bad. It's definitely not the most delicious breakfast ever but breakfast is simple and there's not much you can do to mess up toast, eggs and sausage. 
The coffee is good, but I find this place to be consistently weird in the patrons it attracts. Every time I've been here, it's been 10% full and I know theres a huge seating area past the kitchen as well which is never used. 
The service could be improved and there's always been two elderly ladies there. Only one of them serves and the fact the two sit there and watch you like they're just waiting to collect your dishes makes the dining experience somewhat uncomfortable."}
{"text":"This is more of a 2.5 star, but I'm giving them the 3 because it was better than expected. 

So, I usually would head over to Boom for a breakfast, but it was cold, Black Knight was closer, and I figured it was something to review, so I took the plunge. Black Knight heavily advertises their \"$5 Breakfast - Tax Included\" on a giant sandwich board out front, so I figured how bad could it really be. 

So let me tell you - if the food was as bad as their decor made me expect it would be, it probably would have been covered in bugs and hair. Seriously. This place looks SO sketchy - everything is yellowing, it is super dark inside and the other patrons were a wee bit... let's say they were probably doing drugs in the bathroom. 

HOWEVER - I read a few reviews while I waited to order and figured I wouldn't die from the place, so I ordered their $5 breakfast which comes with bacon, eggs, toast, hash browns (really just a fried potato), and coffee. The food came quickly, and though the service left something to desire the food was actually not that bad. It was a good portion, the eggs were done well, and the coffee was terrible, but hey - it was included in the $5 deal. 

SO, would I come back here? Probably not, but I am a bit of a princess. I like my well-lit breakfast spots with cheerful service and decent coffee. However, if you're looking for a cheap bite, you could do a lot worse than Black Knight."}
