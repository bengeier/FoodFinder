{"text":"After viewing the positive yelp reviews we decided to check this restaurant out. Visiting from out of town and we drove our rental to red rocks for the sunset and stopped in last night. Food was great, service was perfect. Highly recommend this place. Salsa was spot on and you can feel a lot about a Mexican spot biased on the salsa."}
{"text":"We found this restaurant via Yelp and gave it a try.  We had enchiladas and a custom shrimp quesadilla. It was excellent!  We learned that Happy Hour ran from two to five and tried the resulting $3 Margaritas.  They were also excellent.  We had such a good meal we came back the next day.  The second time the taco salad was terrific.  I had the sampler and all was well except for the flauta (sp?) that was a little too dry.  That said, we will return the next time we are in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Went on Yelp to find a Mexican restaurant. This restaurant was close and good reviews. Well they were closed when the their website said they would be open. We were from out of town took Uber there and they were closed!!! I would definitely not recommend!!!"}
{"text":"I have never been to this location, I think it's the same owners of Los Lupes  in Mesquite, NV which serves a bad ass albondigus soup. Beans & Rice made to perfection. Homemade salsa / chips great as well... Just the right heat, chips tasted light crispy.  Sooooo if this is the same owner, I am so looking forward to coming here this weekend."}
{"text":"Great food & great service!! Highly recommend this place! Impressed actually for the quality of food! For a first time this place beat my expectations! I had the chicken fajitas and it tasted FRESH! And came with a lot of food! Enough for two ppl...

Will be back soon!!"}
{"text":"Delicious!  Coming from Southern California it was  a surprise to find this place. Nice little salsa bar with sliced radishes, spicy carrots and onions. Our Server Carlos was very friendly and helpful. Guacamole was great, not too bland or too hot to eat. Will eat there again when in town. Prices were very reasonable also. Keep it up"}
{"text":"We went to celebrate our Mothers  and  Nina's 92 birthday the waitress and servers were outstanding. The food is delicious very authentic. We all ordered different so I got to taste a variety of there menu. The menudo has both types of nistamal they have a sampler plate that has all my favorites enchilada hard shell taco flauta and taquito beans and rice. If you like hot salsa they have a salsa bar and chips that are so good. Please go and taste for yourself. Oh and love the zarape curtains and wall paintings very authentic."}
{"text":"It's always nice to find a new restaurant when you least expect it. Wifey and I were looking for a New Mexican food restaurant and stopped in on a whim. I had the best verde burrito ever and my wifey loved her chicken enchiladas. Turns out this restaurant has been open for 20 years in Mesquite and they finally opened one in Vegas. The outside looks like nothing special but the inside is clean and the staff is friendly.  I'll be back again next Friday!"}
{"text":"These guys are New to town. Been open a month or so. We have come twice now the food is Amazing!!!!  The Best Mexican Food I have ever had!"}
{"text":"i really like this place. Their food is delicious and the service is very attentive. Visiting from Socal where some of the best mexican food is this place didn't disappoint. Came in with my party of four and were seated right away and offered drinks immediately. we were there for lunch and we tried their Chorizo con huevos , Machaca con huevos, Green enchiladas and Menudo everything was so good that we decided to drive from the Strip the following day to have lunch again at Los Lupes. will come back next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"My bf and I were hung over from a fun night at Hakkasan and were searching for menudo which is huge best remedy for hang overs. Any way the chips and salsa were ok but that menudo was life! We also got posole and it was the best ive had in a while. Should visit !!"}
{"text":"Comida muy deliciosa. Desayuno, almuerzo y cena. A toda hora
Muy limpio. No mucha gente. Servicio del personal muy amable"}
{"text":"Service was great. Friendly staff. Casual, clean atmosphere. I loved my fish and shrimp soup, but it was insanely hot and overflowing the huge bowl. Just too much. Flavor was great. The three others at the table were disappointed by their burrito, asada and shredded beef tacos. Just average food, but I'd come back in this part of town. Easy parking."}
{"text":"I heard about this branch of the best Mexican Restaurant in Mesquite so we gave it a try. Their Carnitas plate shows why they're good. The meat is cooked so it's crisp, yet tender, with the right combination of spices to give it character. They make their own refried beans and you can tell it's special. Their carne Asada dishes also show the quality of the meat and the cooking technique. The Mole and Menudo are also very tasty and do not have that fatty or gamey aftertaste you will find in versions of other restaurants. Their bar is also well equipped with some of the best tequilas, and they make some really good margaritas. Probably some of the best Mexican food in Las Vegas at very reasonable prices. The service is great, too. We are definitely coming back to try their other dishes."}
{"text":"We really went to this place with high hopes. It's hard to find good Mexican in Vegas. Let's start with the good: I had a chili relleno and a beef enchilada. The relleno was very good, with a nice sauce. The enchilada disappointed; the beef was tasty, but the sauce was awful, thin and vinegary, with no body and less flavor. The wife had a hard shell beef taco. They forgot to mention the shell was precooked, like taco bell. They should warn you about that, especially for10 bucks for one taco, rice and beans.

The service was good, with a salsa bar that had a wide selection, even though nothing spicy. It was a little disconcerting that the place was almost empty, but they left the dirty tables uncleared. 

We might give it one more try, but for the prices and location it better be killer."}
{"text":"Alejandra was our server and she was AWESOME! Made you feel at home and she was super funny! Very attentive always asked if we needed anything else. And she also sold us on the apple stuffed chimichanga... I know sounds weird but it was GOOD! The food is great but Alejandra made it better."}
{"text":"This place is really good! I got the #29 which was the carne Asada burrito w a taco (the taco was carne asada also) I must say it is pretty good. The place was clean, nice, & peaceful so that's always a plus I also enjoyed the happy hour house margaritas they were the best house margaritas I've actually tasted. My sever was nice & well mannered so if your looking for a good Mexican restaurant I suggest here !"}
{"text":"If your looking for delicious, authentic Mexican food then this is your place.  Nice spot off the strip so you avoid the crowd.  Staff is super friendly and food is soooooo good,  we will be back!"}
{"text":"The best mexican restaurant in The Vegas, I am from Los Angeles and still this is the best Mexican Restaurant"}
{"text":"Was walking around and found this place on Yelp since it was close to where I was staying. The chips and salsa are delicious! It's tucked away in a strip mall but it's worth the visit. Got the beef chimichanga and was very satisfied."}
{"text":"This place is REALLY good!! One of the best Chile Rellenos I've ever had! Fantastic food, full of flavor, authentic, and served by the nicest people!! Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"Tried for first time today.  The food was very very good and the service was super nice and friendly.  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Excellent food, friendly service.   There were four in our party and we all enjoyed our meals.  Fajitas were huge and delicious.  We asked them to serve queso with chorizo mixed in.... amazing!"}
{"text":"Pros: Service, food

Cons: I am not sure of any 

Details: I have only been once so it is hard to give a full review and I may update after the next visit. We went because neither of us felt like cooking and it was a little later at night (7:30-8ish). I had a craving for some Mexican food and trusted Yelp to recommend a place. I found Los Lupes and so we went. I ordered the cheese enchiladas and they were very good. The menu was very very large with a ton of options. The service was great, though it was not very busy so I cannot speak to a busy evening. We will definitely try this place again."}
{"text":"Was here on a Friday night. Food was great. Service is good. Live music was a surprise but, wonderful."}
{"text":"Love this place !! The food is delicious and the customer service is great. The Micheladas is a must try."}
{"text":"It's was a very hung over Sunday when I came to this restaurant. I really needed menudo after a wedding and Fremont street. I think I had 11 shots of tequila in a 2 hr span? Anyway I got here with my fiancé and my wifey and I naturally ordered the menudo and a Michelada. Honestly I have had places that don't make micheladas make better micheladas than this place. The menudo was mediocre. The waiter didn't even know the menu. My wifey asked for ceviche and he said there was no band they don't make it. Then we saw that they do ceviche tostadas then he remembered. It was also warm ceviche which doesn't sound right and maybe a health hazard."}
{"text":"A couple of nights ago, another Yelp Elite friend and I decided to eat real food after gorging on dessert type yummies of cookies and ice cream from another Vegas location. Yeah, I know we do things in reverse so my friend said we should try Los Lupes because he had heard great things about the place from the Yelp Community. So we entered the address on our phones and took our separate cars from the cookies and ice cream location.

For those who are looking to eat here, throw your phones on the seat next to you and just head to Decatur and Hacienda. Both my friend's and my phone navigation were trying to make us drive through a gated apartment complex and bring us back to the strip mall. We kept going in circles, so please put down your phones if coming from the West side.

Everything on the menu looked good but sometimes when you go to a restaurant, it ends right there... The Menu. I am a BAR (Born and Raised) Angeleno, so having ligit or great Mexican food is part of the formula. I also don't like posers so don't try to be something you are not (a person or a menu item) and try to fake me out. Posers... Gah! I ordered the Carnitas plate and a side of grilled jalapeños, just to take it up a notch. My friend ordered the Chile Verde, which my phone face planted in while I was trying to shed light on his food while taking a photo. True story. I would have taken a picture of it but my phone was taking a swim in Chile Verde. I ordered a Chardonnay but they were out, so I settled on the White Zinfandel as I just didn't feel 'red' that night. My friend ordered a Mexican Coke from the bottle and I said how great that was because Mexican Coke with real sugar was better than our HFC Coke. I really just said that because I have not had soda for 25 years and I don't think I would be able to taste the difference. No, I am not a Soda Poser.

Our food came out quickly and our server was very pleasant. We dug into our pork product dinners and ate and ate. My carnitas were tender and full of flavor. I did eat it with my jalapenos not because my meal was flavorless but because I like my meal like life, kicked up a notch and on fire. Chica en fuego!!  The rice and beans were very good and not dry, which is very important to me. I refuse to eat refried beans that are crusty and dry with rice that resembles those beans. Not here, very smooth and full of flavor- I don't know how else to describe non dry beans. 

All in all everything was delicious, the service was great and I will be back again to try other items. I also won't shed my phone light over someone's Chile Verde ever again. EVER."}
{"text":"I was looking for a good mexican restaurant to take my grandmother for her birthday. Well since this place had so many good reviews we all decided to go here. There was a Christmas party that was ending so the place was kinda empty. There was a party of about 10 so we gave them a little time to get the tables set up which wasn't long. Place was clean & had a typical mexican atmosphere with the different decor & other things. 

After being seated we immediately had yummy chips, salsa, and water. The chips were pretty good and the salsa was out of this world. So then it was time to order and I got the chili colorado burrito with beans and rice on the side. Well my food came and looked really good but.......I was slightly disappointed. The meat tasted a little tangy and there was absolutely NO CHEESE in sight!!!! None the less because I didn't eat all day I are it anyway. Everyone else enjoyed their food so most of our party was satisfied. 

The service was SUPERB and the waitress made sure we were taken care of and accommodated the various requests we had. That was a huge plus for me as I know this industry not easy and I can really appreciate and respect whenever I get excellent service. So kudos to them for that!!!!

Not sure if I'll return though cuz growing up in L.A. your palate knows what good & authentic mexican food is and tastes like. But then again the service alone may bring me back to give them a second chance. Maybe I'll do a Saturday since that's the only day they serve pozole. 

They came and sang tip my grandmother & gave her some fried ice cream. The other patrons around us also sang along. It wss really sweet! But thank you guys for making a great night for my grandmother since it was all about her."}
{"text":"Was waiting to get a tattoo a couple of doors down and decided to grab some food by recommendation of my artist. We wandered in during happy hour and ordered a half price margarita that was delicious and a food special that was amazing. The tacos are large and the service is wonderful. What a great place tucked in here. Definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"Great food and excellent Margarita drink. The restaurant is very clean and has a nice Mexican ambiance. Soft Mexican music in the background.  Very friendly wait staff."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service.  1/2 price apitizers at happy hour are excellent.  This place is so good.  Everything is so good.  I will be back."}
{"text":"Los Lupes is authentic Mexican food. None of this Americanized Tex-Mex! The chimchanga was fried (oh yeah!) and the flautas were delicious. The salsa leaves much to be desired (bland). Customer service was very good."}
{"text":"I was surprised there wasn't a line out the door to get in. 

This is my kind of place. 

Simple Mexican decor 
Energetic staff full of smiles, nods, and positive vibes. 
Simple quiet unassuming Mexican tunes in the background 
Quiet tv's in the corner, one showing news in Spanish , another covering sports.  

\"Angel\" our waiter let loose his positive personality and smiled his way through our order, service, and \"monitoring \"

We had flautas, stuffed peppers, and a tostada .

Each was full of fresh ingredients 
Each had guacamole and sour cream fordipping. 

The best part. ......
(Hey, I'm a dude....)

Was the chilled beer glass for my beer. 

Girls, take your man here, it's simple and affordable. 
Dudes, take your girl here, it feels private ....like the favorite hang, the \"go to\" fav place.
(Blue jeans. , not slacks )

Bonus- fastest sit-to-food I've ever had.

-------
4th time here. 
Yippee! Had alejandra again. What a positive charming server/host. 
Beer , margarita, guac, and chips showed up lightening fast and we're tasty .

1.99 happy hr beer .....hic!
Loved my tacos , tortilla soup , hot chips, and tostada yum.

------------
Geez.  I'm predictable 
I came back again the next day. 
I like that the tacos , enchiladas , burritos, all have a healthy quantity of meat in them. 

They're not stingy like a chain 
They make it like mom would."}
{"text":"Came here on a whim when I actually get to enjoy late dinner with my fiance 'cause I'm on earlier schedules. LOL. He had to persuade with a description of average Yelp ratings and his fave Yelp pics. Of course it worked! 
General points of our experience: restaurant's friendly staff and great food. It was also great that I got to drink 2 cold Modelos with my food. 
Let's see... I got to eat the carnitas plate with corn tortillas. Yum! Seriously, I ate the whole thing. If I hadn't, maybe I would've gotten to eat dessert. LOL. 
I also like the restaurant vibe/setting, where I don't have to get in line to order my food, and the prices aren't outrageous for the serving. I don't know if the timing was just right, but I appreciated how relaxed (not too busy) the restaurant was."}
{"text":"Had myself a great lunch, ordered the burrito special. Chips, salsa, soup all came out. The had a really nice salsa bar. Clean, comfortable. Great service and everything delicious. I'm a little surprised there are only 6 reviews. I'm from San Francisco and we are really picky with our burritos. From me they delivered the goods."}
{"text":"Checked Yelp for a great Mexican restaurant and found this one. The food was muy bien!! A couple of us had chile rellenos that were delicious, one of us had a burrito and was very pleased. Then another one had beef tacos that was also very good!!! And the service was excellent!!! I will definitely return to this restaurant when I return to Las Vegas!!!!"}
{"text":"Came and had dinner wanted to check this place out for a while now because it's by the house. And it did not disappoint at all!! food is amazing!! To say the least we shared a asada torta, which by the way was DELICIOUS! My boyfriend had the pazolle and I had a enchilada with a asada taco!! Everything was great. Will be back again real soon! Staff was very nice constantly checking in making sure we were Doing okay, or if we needed refills on drinks!! Thanks guys! Good job!!"}
{"text":"Delicious!!!! I love this Restaurant
I ordered chicken enchiladas!  And I must say, these were by far the best enchiladas I have ever tasted! 
Also, I love  the whole staff who work here! They all smile and seem happy to be at work! This place carries  a great atmosphere! And a happy place to bring family and friends!
Thank you for all the love you put into the food!

I will be back for seconds and thirds etc!!"}
{"text":"I've been in here a few times and every time it's excellent food. They seem slow every time I show up then start to pick up so maybe I'm some good luck for them. They sure are a gem for me. The carnitas tacos with green sauce is where its at. Very clean and good service."}
{"text":"Food was really good, but the service was incredibly slow. We were 1 of 3 tables with people and it took 20minutes for someone to bring our drinks. Our waitress then took another 20 before taking our order. Food was good, but we'll probably never be back."}
{"text":"I was undecided what to have for dinner so thought I would give this place a shot. Which was closest to hotel. The dining area was clean with friendly staff. I ordered the shred beef taco and a cheese enchilada combo ($11.99) with a Diet Pepsi ($2.75) and an extra beef taco ($3.50), which I did not finish. I would have just stuck to the cheese enchilada combo and eat the chips. The chips and salsa was great I could not get enough. The chips were the best I have had, they were fresh and warm. A bit pricey $21.73 total with tip for one el jefe's meal but a great atmosphere and great staff. SiriusXM Aguila is the house music."}
{"text":"Best home made food!
Even the free chips and salsa are great, service is quick and servers are really nice and helpful.

The Chile relleno is the best, beans and rice have a good flavor too."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service! Nicely decorator and food is Amazing!! You can always judge a good Mexican restaurant by their salsa - two thumbs up!! I had the carne asada and t was tender and delicious. 
Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Good food, good drinks, good service and good prices in a strip mall.  My idea of a perfect mexican restaurant.  From Cali and travel Baja extensively so I know and love my Mexican food  Whole family left full and had a good buzz from the stiff margaritas.   Worth leaving the strip for.  I judge every mexican restaurant by ordering a carne asada burrito and they didn't disappoint."}
{"text":"We were in town and we're craving good mexican food.  We were not disappointed.  The menudo was an A+.  Very good.  We also had a chicken burrito ranchero which was also very good.  Service was excellent.  As soon as you thought about asking for something, the waitress was there.  Very nice atmosphere too.  This will be a regular for us now."}
{"text":"I ordered a chicken fajita, and the portion was big. I had enough remaining to pack it in a box for next meal as well. Taste is okay."}
{"text":"We are a party of 5 came in for lunch, after waiting for 45mins to sit down, we got a FREAKING ugly attitude short skinny Asian girl with glasses. She doesn't say a word to our \"thank you & please\" just gave us a serious grumpy face for the whole time. REALLY?  If you don't like customer service, get out of restaurant business. I hope the management would talk to her."}
{"text":"AMAZING! The same great food I grew up eating. So happy they are in Vegas now. As always the flautas as well as chips and salsa are to die for. You have to come, they just opened this location but it's not as busy as the one in mesquite so come try it and keep them open!!"}
{"text":"So delicious! Very homey vibe, and the food is delicious. Feels like abuela is back in the kitchen cooking the food. Really reasonable prices too! Definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"Great Service & Excellent food. I haven't had food this good in a long time. I had the Chilie Verde burrito with rice and beans. I also had a crispy shredded beef taco for later. I will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"If you are in Vegas and want some good authentic Mexican food this is the place. Forget the strip, they don't have real Mexican food. This place is 5mins away from Las Vegas Blvd. Totally worth the try. Went to Gordos Tacos hoping for the best and it was Wack!  Los Lupes totally beats that place!"}
{"text":"We arrived at the restaurant and were sat at a table with some chips and salsa. After approximately 20 minutes other groups of people begin to leave after waiting so long before being served. We continued to wait without even having our drink orders taken yet. The final straw for us came about 15 minutes later when another group entered the restaurant and were instantly served by our waiter. We then got up and left with yet another group of of people who had grown tired of waiting. 

This service was one of the worst I have ever received."}
{"text":"My husband and I have lived in Las Vegas for four years.  We came from Southern California where we are very accustomed to excellent Mexican food.  We have been on a search since living here to find a good restaurant.  (We have tried many).  It was during that quest that we came upon Los Lupes from a Yelp review.  It is the best I've found here.  The chips are thin, as I like, and salsa is delicious.  The food has the authentic Mexican taste that I have loved my whole life.  We had drinks that were enjoyable as well.  It seemed as though everyone was devoted to ensuring an enjoyable eating experience for us, and I can assure you, it was.  We will be going back."}
{"text":"Delicious Mexican Food, love the music, vibe and service. Food is just great.... specially after a hangover!"}
{"text":"We were looking for authentic and fresh Mexican food. We found it at Los Lupes. Everything was fresh and very tasty. The guacamole was spectacular and the steak tacos were very good. I had one of the best margaritas I have had in a long time. Loved that it was just off the very busy and crowded main strip. Highly recommend you try this gem of a restaurant! Ándale !"}
{"text":"The food was authentically prepared. The portions were generous. Most of all the food was very fresh! The restaurant was very clean and location has ample parking. Will definitely return when next in Vegas."}
{"text":"So after countless times trying Mexican restaurants in Las Vegas, I turned to Yelp to see what people's opinions where about a good Mexican restaurant. Came across Los Lupes and it's literally 5 minutes from my house. OMG!!!! This place is absolutely amazing. The food very authentic. We came during happy hour. Half off all appetizers and beers/margaritas. We had the Carne Asada quesdilla and Chicken quesdilla, OMG the flavor!!!!  Also had a regular, strawberry and mango margarita!! So good,  let's say they are not stingy with the liquor.
We come at least once a week. The staff here,  very very nice!  We have our favorite waiter Abraham!! They have a second location in Mesquite. A must try,  I promise you will give it a thumbs up!!"}
{"text":"Great place.  Nice people and good service.  

Salsas were bomb! And so many of them.

I went here when I was in Vegas and ended up coming here twice they were so good!!  I had the shrimp burrito.  Shrimp tasted to fresh I had to come back."}
{"text":"Authentic food and great margaritas.
The staff are super friendly and polite. If you are in Vegas I definitely recommend having a meal here."}
{"text":"Found this hidden gem  on Yelp. Excellent food and broad menu selection. No skimping here. Pozole had plenty of meat and hominy. Fresh Chips and Salsa always a plus. Will be one of my go to's when I'm in the area again."}
{"text":"My family and I were visiting Vegas from California. Not knowing what was good around town, we came across Los Lupes and took a chance. Upon arrival, we were greeted very pleasantly, and immediately were seated. Our party of 14 people had water and chips waiting and drinks and food orders were taken very fast. Waitress was very attentive and was able to take down everyone's order correctly. Food was prompt and delicious. Not a single family member complained."}
{"text":"Best chilaquiles in town.. if you in to the real chilaquiles spicy  and delicious, ask real chilaquiles with habanero salsa. Simply the best two thumps up."}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican sit down restaurant. Totally hidden and the window from the outside is dark so it seems like it's closed-but it's not!
My Dad's favorite Albondigas Soup-we always take some home for lunch in the upcoming days ahead.
Large space so good for big groups and sports teams.
Margaritas and Micheladas were D-Lish!
Located in an industrial area strip mall but worth the hide and seek.
Never disappoints no matter what I order! And the staff is always very nice and accommodating to my quirky specific requests."}
{"text":"They have the best authentic Mexican food in vegas. I love the peach margaritas and the chips and salsa!!!"}
{"text":"Finally!!! Soooo happy to have found this place, and what is funny is that it is just around the corner from hour apt. We have been in search of a real AUTHENTIC Mexican restaurant since we moved back to Vegas a little over a year ago to no avail. Most of the places with the exception of TACOS EL GORDO from Tijuana/San Diego (home), they have two stores here in Las Vegas. Always full and always a line, (hmmm wonder why). Well it seems like most Mexican places here are just bland have to drown the food in the bland salsa they offer. I even found a place selling you a \"California Burrito\" with out avocado ummmm HELLO that is what makes it California!!!!! Well I am happy to report, Los Lupes is the REAL deal, wow authentic as can be, the place is clean, the food OUT OF THIS WORLD!! Tasty, complementary chips and salsa to die for!!! Service was great!!! Will be back and sending everyone to this place!!!"}
{"text":"Omg. So satisfied. The food was delicious, cooked to perfection and so authentic. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Food is delicious!  Rice & beans are home made. I had the Chile relleno burrito,  loved it.."}
{"text":"Authentic food. Love the environment and the informative papers at the table to read while we wait for good."}
{"text":"Came here for a quick dinner on the 4th of July and the young man working provided wonderful service. My husband and I were both working and this was a meeting point for a quick dinner break for both of us. I arrived earlier and the waiter immediately went over the menu, brought waters, explained the salsa bar, etc. 

My husband had the sampler plate and I had the chimichanga. Both were very good and had that homemade feel - where you imagine someone's grandma in the back doing the cooking. 

Chimichanga's can be dry inside but this one wasn't - the chicken was mixed with roasted peppers and possible something else as it had more of a stewed meat quality and texture. 

The chips appear to be of the in-house freshly made variety and were served warm and lightly salted. 

Micheladas were on point as well. 

To top it off, the service was excellent."}
{"text":"Lovely dinner here with excellent and attentive service from Angel. Had chicken enchiladas with green sauce, carnitas burrito and carbon steak. 
Ice cold beers, complimentary chips and salsa. What else could one want?"}
{"text":"I went with 2 friends to give this place a try on a Sunday night.  It has only been open a couple of weeks the server said.  There was only a few other tables besides us.  The server was very nice to us and patient!  We were having a couple of micheladas and trying to decide on what to order because it all looked so good and he never rushed us.  We got some tacos and the menudo.  Everything was yum and we had such a blast (after more micheladas hahah). The menudo was especially awesome.  This is a great New Mexican spot to grab some drinks and great Mexican food!!  They really take care of you here!"}
{"text":"Really good Mexican food! Everyone was really nice!!!! Highly recommend this place!!!!"}
{"text":"So we decided to try this place tonite with hopes we find a good Mexican restaurant. Well my husband ordered the burrito mojado plate, and my daughter ordered the two soft tacos of asada plate. They both found hairs in there food. I ordered the two chicken enchilada Souzas plate, with the surprise I found two chicken bones in my food while eating. Then the check came 60$ and some change kinda pricey if you ask me, so I go to pay and give them a 100$ bill and they are looking it over for a little while I guess checking to see if I freshly printed it. Finally my change comes and I get back 29$ and some change no reciept, so I ask if I can get a receipt and they give me one I look it over after counting my change and knowing somethings wrong then the girl says we only owe you 5$ I'm like no you owe me 10$ so after they took a few min to add and subtract they realized they made the mistake. Definitely not a good impression and we definitely won't be back!!"}
{"text":"Went in on a very quiet Saturday night. I should have known from the second I tasted the salsa this place would be great! I had the Asada soft tacos. Fantastic food and very authentic. I'll definitely be back again. Great service too! Highly recommended."}
{"text":"This place is really really good.  Really enjoyed myself!!!! Authentic Mexican food... Great salsas and service!!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is hands down really delicious. I'm from California but any time I stop by Las Vegas I will be eating here. I definitely recommend the camaron rancheros ."}
{"text":"5 stars are not enough for this restaurant!!! A-MAZING all around!!! The food was so yummy!!! Authentic, homemade Mexican! But what I really appreciated was the service!! Our server Val was the sweetest most attentive and helpful person ever!!!! She had patience with us and went above and beyond to make sure we were taken care of. Her and Chris both came around often to see if we needed anything. He was such a sweetheart as well, who ever hired those two did a great job! I  Definitely will be returning when I visit Las Vegas, and will recommend it to my friends and family. It was a great experience!"}
{"text":"Los Lupes is so good the burritos are like mom used to do make. Our waiter Angel is so attentive. The fried ice cream is out of this world. The manager Roma makes your dining experience like being at home. Loved the carnitas burrito. Will be back for breakfast... wonderful"}
{"text":"What a great find. This morning we drove from Santa Barbara to Vegas.  We missed our regular India buffet time due to the enroute traffic.  0.5 miles before our air BNB, we found this market complex.

We were about to enter pizza hut (in my defence we were starving) when saw 'mexican food' post.  The restaurant name was written is rather small font.

I quickly checked google reviews. Yelp takes time and as I told you we were starving.  Yet my wife wanted to freshen up at our staying place before eating. So we ordered a take out.  With happy hour chicken quesadillas (with sour cream, gouc and salad) costed $4. We ordered two of them. Picked up some small cups with salsa from their help yourself counter.

Habenaro salsa is hot but super fun. And I like spotting my quesadillas open put some diced cilantro, onion, tomato (from salsa counter).   Every bit was delicious.  Chicken was tender and flavorful.

The server was so nice...That despite a take away under $10 bucks she offered us a bag of nachos and house made salsa for free.

So 5 stars for taste
5 for salsa counter
5 for price
5 for small business (glad I missed pizza hut in their favor)
And 5 for service.

They gained a loyal customer from me, for my every successive Vegas visit."}
{"text":"Stopped here on 5.14.16 @ 9am....Just as they opened for the day.  Ordered combination plate with chile relleno and enchilada.

The food was outstanding!  This place is authentic and worth a visit.  Total treat and pleasure.  We will be back."}
{"text":"Way way too pricey for a small neighborhood dive. Expect to spend $40bucks for 2 w/o cocktail or tip. And whenever you walk into a joint and its totally empty walk right back out. Food was very good but very expensive for a dive in a strip mall....Omg  great help, good food, expensive as all hell for the neighborhood, $65.00 for 2 people with only 2 alcoholic drinks.   You are better off @ expensive Ricardo's at this rate... Ridiculous...go back to California.  Where folks expect to pay these exorbitant prices...... the salsa bar is rather impressive, wont stay in business long, they are always totally empty.....p.s.  the Happy Hour selections are a big joke.....

{"text":"Visiting Las Vegas & craving Mexican food for breakfast. Ordered the machaca & egg plate & it was delicious! Waitress was very friendly & attentive. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"We were at Las Vegas and had a craving for some Mexican food. This place was good and the older gentleman was very welcoming. I would recommend this place not to far from the strip and good food."}
{"text":"This place is really good!  We found this on Yelp and it had awesome reviews and it lives up to them 100%. Thank you fellow Yelpers!  We are from L.A. and are used to excellent Mexican food. This place is authentic, tastes great, and is reasonably priced. Will definitely be on our list of must eat locales when we visit Vegas and will be telling family and friends to check this place out!  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"The Chile Colorado burrito was the BEST I've found in Vegas.  I'm glad we can across this place, will definitely come back.  I always judge a Mexican restaurant by their chips and salsa, and the did not disappoint."}
{"text":"So excited to find this restaurant here in Las Vegas.  I've eaten at the one in Mesquite. It's our favorite!  Now I have a new favorite here.   Not disappointed. Same warm abs welcoming atmosphere. We were greeted the moment we opened the door.  Enjoyed the chips and salsa.  The chips are warm and thin! Ordered a flavorful guacamole.  Delish!  We had a strong margaritas.  Yummy on a hot summer day. 

We ordered the same entree . Carnitas tacos.  Lots of meat and well seasoned.  A huge plate and almost too much to eat.  

We will be back to enjoy more entrees.  Don't miss the opportunity to experience this great authentic restaurant."}
{"text":"Excellent food and great service. I have been here twice and both time it was a very good experience. Easy in and out or stay as long as you want."}
{"text":"This place is cozy and clean. The staff are friendly and the service is great. They had live music when I went. The food came hot and is authentic Mexican food. The prices are great. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Super yummy and authentic Mexican food!!! Do yourself a favor and leave the strip, take a 10 minute Uber/Lyft and eat at Los Lupes! Their chips and salsa are a great appetizer. The steak fajitas are juicy and filling. Angel is the most friendly and attentive server and deserves a raise. Gracias por todo Angel!!!"}
{"text":"I keep getting surprised here in Vegas. Get out of the casinos and hit some real places like this one. This was some of the best Tex-mex I have had. The rice had a perfect texture and flavor. The asada steak was very good, although it was medium-well and I ordered it med. The chili relleno was also very good. The one thing that impressed me the most was their habanero salsa. I love a good salsa that sets you on fire and this one did. Only other small issue was I asked for the beans to be cut and for double rice. If the steak was cooked med and beans had been cut, this would easily be 5 stars."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the great food and service. The staff seemed to really appreciate the business. I've tried a lot of Mexican food in Vegas and a majority of it isn't my \"style\". I've resorted to looking at pictures on Yelp, so thanks to y'all for posting pictures of the food...it helped me make the decision to try Los Lupes and I'm certainly glad I did."}
{"text":"Had dinner here last night. The chips and salsa were good as described by others on Yelp reviews. They also have a salsa bar which is a nice addition. Had the chili relleno & beef enchilada combo. Came with rice and beans. The meal was good. The staff was friendly. we explained that we were in a hurry and got our food and check to us in a very timely manner. We will return."}
{"text":"One of the best Mexican restaurants I've been too! Visiting from low Angeles for the weekend and was craving Mexican food. Boy was I lucky to find this joint! Can't want to come back next time I visit! 

Must try:
Asada burrito
Horchata
Steak fajitas"}
{"text":"Went today to check this place out since it's right around the corner from me. Very friendly staff, was seated right away. The nachos and salsa they give you to snack on were really good with their nicely flavored salsa. I ordered a quesadilla as an appetizer and no lie, literally the best one I've had to date! Loaded in flavor and it was just a cheese quesadilla! I also had a bean and cheese burrito and that as well was loaded in flavor. Out of all the Mexican restaurants I have been to, from L.A to Seattle, I could honestly say this place is freaking amazing! Next time I am eager to try their tacos de lengua, which I have a pretty good feeling will not let me down :D
  You got to check this place out! It's newly opened and definitely deserves some sort of recognition for their flavorful food"}
{"text":"Solid Mexican food that reminded me of CA. Service was good and the salsa was on point. Would most likely return"}
{"text":"Love your fresh tasting fish tacos! Flavors were perfect!Bueno! I come try burrito next time , only those chips could be less creasy, I let my co workers munch on them;)"}
{"text":"They don't sell Birria or Mole, but they DO have menudo daily, great for the hangovers and pozole daily. They don't deliver, but you can order to pick up. I love their prices and the environment. The people are friendly and greet you with a smile. They have free wifi and the music is not too loud where you can't have a conversation, it's great for a first date. Come check it out to try some good true Mexican food and flavor. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"The service was amazing, always asking is we needed any more chips or salsa, if we needed anything else. So very polite. The margarita was one of the best I have yet to try. Blended to perfection."}
{"text":"We just discovered after searching fir good mex food on yelp.  We had cheese enchilada combo.  The salsa was great..really fresh.  The chips were authentic and not greasy.   The enchiladas came w red sauce and  authentic rice and beans.  All very good.  Only thing I'd ask food be temp hotter next time.  Also had frozen strawberry maguerita..really good!  And we tried the flan for desert...I guess for $4 it was ok.  It was small, tasted ok..we had them leave off the whipped cream .but it was excessively sweet and not carmelized well. Would pass on that next time.  But we are definitely going back to try other dishes. I noticed the tacos had shredded meat and chicken which I prefer.  The atmosphere is casual and simple...but nice."}
{"text":"This place is really good. The portions are huge. They start you off with chips and salsa just like they should considering it's a Mexican joint. The chips are soft and delicious. Salsa is spicy but not too bad. I ordered the chilaquiles (which are not on the menu) and they were loaded with machaca and egg. They were very flavorful. The service was great. The host and waitress were very attentive with our table of 6. Nobody in our group complained about the quality of their food. They also have a full bar to order drinks from. Price is ok overall. I would recommend this place and definitely come back soon."}
{"text":"The servers are very nice and friendly!! Foods are mediocre. And I think they have only one chef??? We ordered a few items to go. The restaurant was almost empty, only 2 groups ( 3 guys group and one family of 3-4 members) but our order took almost 40 mins!!!! That was soooo long plus I felt it was forever since I was starving!!!!!"}
{"text":"Decent mexican fare in Las Vegas. Portions were OK, beans and rice were OK. Their enchiladas were pretty good but their tacos were nothing exciting."}
{"text":"Chile relleno burrito was super good but the horchata was just amazing. I had two there and took one to go!"}
{"text":"Some of the best authentic Mexican that I have had in Las Vegas. 

I have only been once, but will be returning soon. Its not a five star service but the service was exceptional here. 

I tried the chips, salsa, zarapes, queso dip, and guacamole. All were very good, for the type of Mexican food it was the best I have had in Vegas.

The prices are very affordable especially during their generous happy hour appetizers. I don't see why there are lower ranking reviews I would love to do a 4.5 or a 5 star but I don't give 5 stars for anything but five star places."}
{"text":"it's a cute little Mexican spot. The employees are really friendly. Food is pretty good."}
{"text":"Free tortilla soup was the best meal here. Loll
Although service was really good, I can't even give 3 stars. Foods here wasn't authentic but it wasn't modern either.  I can't describe it. 
All I know is it was below mediocre. Salsa wasn't good. Chips were OK. Most importantly chili sauce on my enchilada was awful. It tasted like half way cooked spaghetti sauce. My chicken meat was tough and they only had pork tamales."}
{"text":"Love this place! After you order it comes out pretty fast which is great if your really hungry. Everyone that works there is friendly and there are even some cute waiters. Good prices and simple atmosphere."}
{"text":"Delicious foo. Great service and awesome margaritas. Happy hour pirces/offers are great."}
{"text":"At first everything smelled great. The chips were not homemade. They were stingy with the guacamole on the flautas.  I had to ask for a water refill twice before I got one. And they were a tad overpriced."}
{"text":"So low key . Angel was our server and he was amazing really patient and helpful. Drinks & food was amazing"}
{"text":"I usually judge a Mexican restaurant by the flavor of a few items. 1) Chip and salsa.  2) Rice and Beans.  3) Cheese enchiladas with red sauce. If these items pass my tastebud challenge then usually the other food items are fantastic. They passed with flying colors!! I have to say I live in California and have not found a Mexican restaurant that was as good as I had here and I am surrounded by Mexican restaurants. Amazing food and I will be back again when I come to visit!"}
{"text":"If your looking for authentic Mexican food this is the spot hand's down amazing food I would recommend any one to Los Lupe's"}
{"text":"I've been here several times.  The food is authentic Mexican food and the service is outstanding."}
{"text":"The food here was excellent. The chips and salsa was very tasty. Happy hour prices are incredible. Would highly recommend this place when you want Mexican food in Las Vegas"}
{"text":"Excellent salsa, chicken enchilada and service. Wanted to escape the strip and conference venue for some good Mexican food. Found this place on yelp and was happy. I was a little discouraged that they had no whole beans and was out of the Cabernet. But the chicken enchilada filled me up, was quite tasty and I had a glass of Merlot. Not bad for the price. I was able to sit in a booth and do a little work, feeling very relaxed and comfortable. I would visit again when back in the area."}
{"text":"Absolutely one of my favorite restaurants in town. I highly recommend. Food is great. Chips and salsa is awesome. The service is outstanding. The young man that has a smile always is great."}
{"text":"Back again on 5/5/18 all is  great. Love the salsa. Could be the best salsa in Vegas .

This place is very service animal friendly 

My only complain is TURN ON THE air It's so damn hot in here I feel like I am in Mexico for reals"}
{"text":"Wonderful atmosphere, fabulous food, great service and a very talented mariachi band that I really enjoyed. You will truly enjoy the hospitality and the quality! It will definitely be a frequent stop for our family going forward. Thank you for the wonderful experience!"}
{"text":"This is the best Mexican food I've found in Vegas to date, my one dock was like all of Las Vegas they only have refrained beans and not whole beans which I prefer, other than that is good"}
{"text":"Great Food, Great service!  
They have ground beef-  yay. 

Margaritas taste good, a little small though"}
{"text":"I tried the steak fajitas with rice and beans, steak quesadilla, and a chimichanga from here. I must say that I was impressed! Fajitas was so flavorful and the quesadilla was amazing!"}
{"text":"Was in town for my birthday and wanted real Mexican food, not fancy strip food and this place delivered.  Some of the best carnitas I have ever had.  Will stop here again next time in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"We were driving around looking for a place to eat and came across this place and glad we gave it a try, one of the best Mexican restaurants in town, very clean and authentic looking, I was blown away by the complimentary salsa they served us!!! They were so quick at serving our food and everything was just super delicious and fresh! It's a big restaurant so there is no waiting time and you get seated right away, which is convenient. I would definitely go back there for another treat"}
{"text":"Great prices. Flavorful authentic food. Located in a strip mall. Kinda dead when we came in at 7 on a Monday.  Server was very friendly. Chili con queso was delicious. They have a complimentary salsa bar. Lots of daily specials. Would return. Very clean bathrooms.  Good portions."}
{"text":"Our first time eating Mexican food in Las Vegas and it was BOMB DOT COM!!!!!! From the time we entered the restaurant the service was awesome! The food....OMG IT WAS AMAZING! I usually only eat mexican food in San Diego because everytime i try outside of SD im disappointed. Well, this restaurant proved me wrong this time. The food was so yummy and the staff was very polite! GREAT JOB!!! I am definitely coming back when i rerurn to LV. MAHALO (thank you)"}
{"text":"Excellent Mexican food! One of the best Chili Rellenos I've ever had. Great service and super friendly staff. Great salsa bar as well!"}
{"text":"My family and I found this place on Yelp and I'm happy that we came here! This place is delicious ! The food and prices are great. Staff are so nice and very caring. The young lady we got would come by every 5/10 min asking  us ( party of 14) if everything was ok and if we needed anything . On one of our orders we got the wrong plate and our server was so nice about fixing the problem. I highly recommend this place !!!"}
{"text":"Great food. Great prices. Happy hour is awesome with half off appetizers. Only thing wrong was that it says \"homade\" instead of homemade. Other than that, amazing."}
{"text":"Love coming to this place! From the friendly greeting of the best hostess in town to the perfect sized portions of delicious food! Love the atmosphere and the variety on the menu!"}
{"text":"Service and Food were AMAZING! I highly recommend to anyone that appreciates authentic Mexican food.. Hit the \"Jackpot\" with this place.... 
Happy LA customers"}
{"text":"Ridiculously good mexican food, awesome salsa bar. Maybe I have low standards since I'm from new hampshire where mexican food doesn't exist, but I'd come back to this place time and time again for their tamales and tacos"}
{"text":"The chicken enchilada & chicken hard taco are both delicious. I would definitely eat here as often as l can."}
{"text":"Stopped in on our way out to the airport. The restaurant was empty but the staff wasted no time getting us an ice cold beer, chips and tasty salsa.  Our food was deliver hot and  plenty.  I prefer my al pastor caramelized .   Beans were hot fresh and just the right amount of lard.

Great service, prompt food delivery and tasty food"}
{"text":"I went here with my family and everyone was happy with their food. I ordered a ground beef chimichanga but it was definitely baked, not fried, like the description on the menu, so it wasn't crispy the way I like. The margaritas (I got strawberry and mango) were very good and so was the service. The chips and salsa are the best I've ever had. We will return."}
{"text":"1st time eating here ordered take out,tried the beef chimichanga. the shredded beef was salty and it wasn't fried."}
{"text":"Oh wow 
Wow
Wooooowww we came here for a cheap Valentine's day dinner
It was amazing.
I ordered the carnita burrito and it was smothered accompanied by a player full of rice and beans.
My SO ordered the floutas which I wish I had ordered as well they were so crispy but also soft and full of deliciousness
Then we got the fried ice cream.... #duh u gotta get it! Not big drinkers here but every other table had margaritas. 
The wait staff made good recommendations and the kept our waters, chops and salsa full af!! Would recommend!"}
{"text":"We wanted Mexican Food off the Strip. This is the perfect choice for down to earth Mexican food. I had the beef enchilada and Pork Tamale.  Both were delicious. No wait to get in and food was to the table in less than 14 minutes."}
{"text":"Tried this restaurant tonight. It was delicious! They have a fabulous salsa bar and all their food is homemade. I had the enchilada special (I chose 1 cheese and 1 chicken) and my husband had Carne Asada, which featured a NY Strip cooked to perfection. The tortilla soup was to die for. We also tried the apple chimichanga for dessert. Yum! Served with vanilla ice cream. If you're looking for great Mexican food, this is your place! It's family owned and has authentic, fresh food.  Prices reasonable too. Their original location is in Mesquite and they just opened this one on Dec 21."}
{"text":"If your looking for burritos in Vegas this place is the best the burrito I've had in the valley !

Massive Burritos they even had a salsa bar with radishes ( my favorite :3. )"}
{"text":"A great place for menudo for a hangover!!
Really good service! I definitely recommend. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Food was great. Micheladas were even better. And the margarita went down just as smoothly. Very cute location. Would definitely recommend this place to friends."}
{"text":"Very very cute little Mexican restaurant and PERFECT for a little date night out if you want something colorful yet simple. The service was excellent as I was well taken care of from multiple servers, not just one. I couldn't help but to notice how creatively decorated this restaurant was (at the Decatur location; haven't been to the other location) but not too dramatic either. I was quite impressed and of course to put the icing on the cake-making this 5 stars- is the food. WOW. I mean I already love Mexican food but I love this restaurants Mexican food. Very delicious and I will definitely be coming back and recommending this place if someone ever needs a good place to go for a Mexican cuisine."}
{"text":"My WHOLE plate was seasoned well and delicious! I ordered the chile rellleno plate! Would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Had a chimichanga hubby had the horchata which was refreshing. Service was pretty good. Was very filling had pretty good flavor."}
{"text":"Spent a few days in Las Vegas and wanted to get off the strip. I searched for American food and found Los Lupe's based on other reviews. I was not disappointed. The dishes were HUGE and very tasty. My group had - seafood enchiladas, menudo, chicken fajita salad and beef fajitas. I loved the salsa bar where you can get your own fresh salsa - many different ingredients and levels of \"heat\". Highly recommend it. All of our dishes were delicious."}
{"text":"Amazing authentic Mexican food and super nice staff! Great low key spot off the Vegas strip."}
{"text":"Held a party here for my best friends mom last night. They catered and let us borrow half of the restaurant. Not sure if they actually do all that since the owner and her husband know each other, but they did this time. 

Anyway, since they catered, can I just say...YUM!! Everything they made to cater to the party was delicious! I had to get up and get more. It's my first time here, and I was very impressed. The waiters and waitresses were providing such great service. There was a ton of people that came and from what I saw, everyone was satisfied and content. It was even open bar and no one came up to the counter. They were all taking orders and were quick to bring out the drinks! 

In short, the food was very delicious but the customer service was just impeccable. Very impressed."}
{"text":"Landed in Vegas early, so finding a Mexican restaurant that was open was a bit challenging...this place did not disappoint!   It was so good, we plan to go back before we head home.   We ordered queso, guacamole, fajitas, burritos, quesadilla and Camarones Lupe (bacon wrapped shrimp)...all were delish!    Everyone loved the salsa and the bonus salsa bar where you can make your own.   The chips were fresh AND hot- such a rare find nowadays.   Prices, service and food were all awesome!!"}
{"text":"Great service and great margaritas! The chips and Salsa were amazing.  Ordered the arroz con pollo and it was amazing. Some of the best Mexican food I have had in the valley. The mariachi band was excellent and not so loud that you couldn't hear people at your table talking."}
{"text":"I spent almost 3 months for training in Vegas and found this little Mexican restaurant on Decatur. This is a small family owned restaurant and I know they have at least one other location.

The food here is affordable and surprisingly very good! I usually get the Camerones Diabla or some combo fajitas. He portions are very big. I love to eat and rarely leave food on the table but usually go home full Gavin not eaten everything. Their chips and salsa is good plus they have a salsa bad with 5 or six other favors to try including a good Verde salsa and a Habanero salsa that is much too hot for me but good flavor and I mix it with their table house salsa. 

If you want a tasty sit-down restaurant that isn't over priced you will be happy with his place. This location is new and they need the business, it has never been very busy here and I have eaten here half a dozen times. So give them some business and spread the word!"}
{"text":"Place was off the beaten track and I think we caught them by surprise with a party of six early for dinner. 
We walk in and there is not a single soul in the place, but we get seated and the waiter attempts to take our drink orders a few times but still doesn't get it right, lol. It's all good though as long as the salsa and chips keep coming! 
They take our orders from fajitas to carnitas and everyone was very happy with their food! 
Good Mexican food for sure!"}
{"text":"Great customer service.  Angel checked up on us regularly and made sure we had everything we needed.  Chicken Chimichanga was delicious.  Chicken Fajitas were also very good."}
{"text":"Great food and reasonable prices. Nice place to eat off the strip. Fajitas were wonderful. Corona cheap."}
{"text":"Our food was amazing!!! The strawberry margarita was delicious as well. Our server, Angel, was awesome!! He remembered our orders and refilled the drinks in record time! Very helpful with suggestions and Vegas tips. I would definitely come back and recommend this place to anyone who comes to Vegas! Thank you Los Lupes for serving us an amazing dinner!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent authentic food.  Visiting Vegas and found this little gem.  They also have a salsa bar but the food is top notch"}
{"text":"vacation to Las Vegas I was in the mood to have Mexican food. what a great little find I had tacos and Pastor and Menudo.Service was great and definitely up there with the best Mexican  restaurants i've had. I'm a chef and restaurant owner so for anyone that's looking for a good Mexican restaurant while you're in Vegas this is it.Menudo  is top notch."}
{"text":"Legit spot! I have been here and the wet burritos are the best I have had in town.  Specifically the pork Chile verde burrito is super solid.  Try that I usually get the combo w rice and beans.  Have nice choices at there salsa bar also!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure where all the rave reviews are coming for with regard to Los Lupes. It's OK, solidly average Mexican food. I found it underwhelming and wouldn't make a special trip to come here. 

Our server brought us a basket of chips, that were a bit stale but fine, there was no salsa bar but the salsa was tasty. 

I ordered a taco salad which was fine, nothing special. Hubs had a combination platter, which he didn't finish and he loves Mexican food. The presentation really wasn't that appetizing and the flavors weren't great. Perhaps we didn't order the right dishes. 

Kids had the usual kid tacos/quesadillas which were fine. 

Margarita on the rocks was tasty, but pretty pricey for bar liquor and bottle sour mix. 

The main surprise was the check, for a middle of the road Mexican restaurant our bill was very high. What surprised me was how expensive the margaritas and sodas were. Our entrees weren't that expensive but the total bill really was higher than I anticipated for this type of place."}
{"text":"Amazing chips... Salsas were a hit and miss!
Yummy chile relleno and refried beans. We didn't care for the enchilada... their red sauce was okay and the rice was dry, lacking flavor. The staff is wonderful though!"}
{"text":"Very good chips and salsa! I had bean enchiladas (I'm vegan) and they were very tasty. The sauce on the enchiladas was good but I've had better.  That's the only reason for the 4 stars instead of 5."}
{"text":"Drove all the way from the Mecca of Mexican food - Los Angeles - very hungry and came across this place - food was amazing- micheladas on point - great staff and plenty of parking- forget all the wack Mexican spots on the strip- this is the place to eat great Mexican food"}
{"text":"Very good food.  I just wish it was closer to my side of town.  It would be my new favorite Mexican place."}
{"text":"Great service and the chili Colorado was awesome.  Gonna have to make this a place we go to when we come to Vegas for sure"}
{"text":"You over price every dish .. come on gente y eso que apenas acaban de abrir.. por favor"}
{"text":"The place is clean and friendly, the salsa is good, but the food was not that great. Food was also overpriced."}
{"text":"Great find! Google reviews did not disappoint. Alejandra gave us friendly and helpful service. From the warm and tasty chips and salsa to the steaks we had, we were very pleased. Will definitely mark this as our \"go to\" place for Mexican in Vegas!"}
{"text":"We came in. 4 of us. They asked if we wanted a booth or table. We asked for a booth. They gave us a two person booth for 4 people. We asked to change booths and the service argued with us that the booths were the same size. We left. 

Prior visits here, the food was authentic and excellent. We're just disappointed now."}
{"text":"Went for quick lunch today. The restaurant itself is very simple and a little dated but the gals who helped us were super nice and sweet and the food was delicious. We left stuffed. The chips and salsa are really good! And they had Corona Light which always makes me happy!"}
{"text":"Good reasonably priced authentic (?) Mexican food. Had the usual fair like enchiladas, tamales, rice & beans and beef taquitoes. We will go back on our next trip back to LV."}
{"text":"The best Mexican food in Vegas, I come from Long Beach. Ca. I recommend the steak tacos and shredded beef. Terrific service as well."}
{"text":"Great customer service, delicious authentic beans, salsa, chile rellenos. I'm pretty sure this will be my new favorite mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"Great chips & Salsa! Authentic menu, Delicious entrees, Superb service, Evelia and ALL the staff super friendly & courteous! Jalisco authentic! Will definetely comeback!"}
{"text":"Now this is real Mexican food!! Service was great... I will be coming here again next time I'm in town. Posole really hit the spot! Thanks Los Lupes you satisfied our craving."}
{"text":"The food here is great everytime! Tonight we tried  the shrimp cocktail it was fabulous the rice and beans are excellent. The chilie rellano delish and the green chicken enchilada is one of the best in town. Superb service by Angel our wonderful waiter and were delighted the manager heard it was our anniversary and brought us the best fried ice-cream.  Love this place and I highly recommend this place to all my friends and family.     Five star all the way"}
{"text":"The shrimp and steak fajitas was their redemption! They were Delicious, and the serving size was excellent. They didn't skimp on the shrimp or steak!   A dish for two.... Both meats were very flavorful, seasoned well, and moist. Highly recommend this dish. Also comes with rice, beans, guac, sour cream, and your choice of torts...

So,the reason for the redemption..... on my first visit I ordered a chile verde wet burrito. First bite I thought, oh man this is good, but every subsequent bite kept getting saltier... I love me my Mexican food and I can be a bit over critical so even though my first meal wasn't the best... I knew I'd be coming back to give it another shot and I'm glad I did.

The service was very good both visits so that was a plus and they have good music playing overhead (my personal preference of course )...

Give it a shot!"}
{"text":"Was craving some Menudo before the drive back home! Checked out the reviews and gave Los Lupe's a try! 
Delicious menudo and great service!

See your guys next time!"}
{"text":"5 Star Mexican food and service. Tacos were amazing quality and very healthy proportion."}
{"text":"Short Uber ride from the Strip.  Came during happy hour, 1/2 appetizers, beer and house margaritas. We were craving menudo and I'm so glad we came here. This was so flavorful, with plenty of hominy and tripe. Our significant others had the seafood soup, which was loaded with seafood. They both couldn't finish. Fast ,friendly service. Would definitely come back here, to cure a hangover! Prices very reasonable, paid less then half of what we were paying while eating on the Strip."}
{"text":"Everything was alright. Food was nice and hot. Restaurant was clean and staff were friendly. I would go back and try something else if I were ever to come back to Vegas."}
