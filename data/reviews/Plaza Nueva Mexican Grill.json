{"text":"Their salsa was fresh and just the right amount of kick. We had fast and great service, both with carry out and dining in. We have read reviews about the previous owners and decided to give the new ones a chance! We are glad we did."}
{"text":"Wow! I live up the street from this restaurant that keeps changing its name.. Plaza Nueva, the newest rendition is possibly the worst so far. I went there with my family and noticed they they did absolutely nothing new to the place after being closed for months, I think it's the same owner that just keeps shutting down and reopening under different names. So first off, it was a Sunday so no margaritas or booze. Hey, no problem but not sure that was a smart business move for a place this size. We ordered water and my glass had chunks of old food stuck all on the inside of the glass. When I asked for a new water, the waitress looked at me funny and said \"why ?\", when I showed her she was actually embarrassed. The chips were hard and stale and the salsa was average.  What happened next was very interesting. The food came out, the plates were piping hot but the food was actually room temp?!?  We all agreed to never go back. Later that night we all paid dearly with what was more than likely food poisoning. This place should probably be shut down. Very substandard and a disgrace to true Mexican cuisine."}
{"text":"We saw they have now \"re-opened\", stopped in for a Saturday lunch. Great jumbo margaritas (5.99$), table-prepared guacamole... amazing steak quesadilla... and fantastic chicken and steak fajitas! Wow. Incredibly fresh ingredients.... friendly, attentive staff. We took a ton home... concerned it wouldn't re-heat well---we were wrong. Excellent food, service, atmosphere, and can't beat the price. Looking forward to many returns! I love you"}
{"text":"Been in the Old Brooklyn area for about 12 years now, and this is by far the best Mexican restaurant they put in the Biddulph Plaza! Quality of food and margaritas were awesome! Started with such an amazing chorizo queso and then ordered the fajita with chicken, steak and shrimp for the entree. Tuesday and Friday they have margarita specials all day, and Thursdays they have margarita pitcher specials! Friendly wait staff and very clean. I can't wait to go back again!"}
{"text":"The food was okay, for $42 I was expecting extravagance honestly. Ordered shrimp and cheese enchiladas, no menu to look at. Just seemed very unorganized and over priced. After I purchased the food I asked for a side of sour cream.. which they then wanted to charge me for after spending $42? I looked at the lady with utter confusion."}
{"text":"I am actually really surprised. The last 2 places have been flops here in this location. Yes the food is slightly different but I am impressed. Stopped in today for lunch on my day off. I ordered the lunch fajita quesadilla with chicken. To start out the chips were made from real corn chips with ridges in them and the salsa was fresh not the canned tomatoes junk that the last owners did. My quesadilla came as a lunch portion with rice and beans plus had a side of lettuce, tomatoes and sour cream. My quesadilla was packed with delicious grilled chicken and fajita veggies all hot. It was such a large lunch portion I couldn't finish. Also, I couldn't resist half of margaritas too. I did a lime margarita on the rocks and it did not disappoint!!"}
{"text":"Loved this place! My boyfriend and I both loved what we got and will definitely go back again. Our food was absolutely delicious and flavorful. It was clean and the waitress was very attentive and was great with checking on us frequently. The only complaint I have is that my soda tasted off and that the waitress was a little bit awkward. Other than that I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I came in for lunch and had a fantastic meal for a grate price. I'm lactose intolerant and they made me a wonderful borto without any dairy."}
{"text":"I decided to try Plaza Nueva Mexican restaurant, even after being displeased with the previous 2 owners at this same spot.  So glad I did not let the last 2 Mexican restaurants influence my decision!  Plaza Nueva is EXCELLENT.  The food is far more gourmet than the previous restaurants.  The margaritas are awesome.  The staff is really friendly.  I will definitely go back and recommend this place to all of my friends and family."}
{"text":"This is a great Mexican Restaurant.  The margaritas are amazing ! Rosa and her staff go above and beyond to make sure you love your meal and your drinks ! Try the Jalape√±o Botana appetizer it's the best!  We will be back again and again. Can't wait to sit on the Patio!!!"}
{"text":"Okay we're starting with 2 stars because we came in on a Sunday and they have no liquor license for Sunday. So no margaritas, no sangria, beer only. The lady was very nice but we just ordered an appetizer and left. We'll try again when I can get a margarita. I was being disappointed and feel they shouldn't really be open on Sunday if they don't have a liquor license. Could be why there were only two cars in the parking lot."}
{"text":"Moved from Painesville and this is my favorite mexican restaurant. Friendly staff, large portions and great food."}
{"text":"I had the shrimp enchiladas, and they were delicious. Queso was also great. Very nice servers. Quick service. Great place to go before the movies!"}
{"text":"I've always wanted to try the Plaza Nueva Mexican Grill. I've driven by a ton of times and was intrigued. Unfortunately, I was disappointed with my experience. The inside decor was truly adorable. -large comfy booths, Mexican decorations. The service was polite, quick and efficient. I did not enjoy the meal though. The salsa was tasty but the chips were flavorless and appeared to be stale. The food, I ordered, fajita nachos, were soggy and bland. My friend's enchiladas were ok but lacking flavor. The Plaza Nuevo Mexican Grill is definitely a restaurant I won't return to and one I'd suggest you just skip."}
{"text":"I was happy when this place re-opened, and that it remained a Mexican restaurant. There are so few around the area (I don't count a Taco Bell or Chipotle's as having great Mexican food, sorry). I was also greatly pleased that Plaza Nueva now has a different owner. The food is VERY good ... nice portions and good pricing. And yes, a very friendly staff.  Buena Suerte to the new owner."}
