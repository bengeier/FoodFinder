{"text":"I knew the original owner as \"A-Fau sook\" (Uncle Fau) when I was a toddler in the late 50s and early 60s.  Friend of my grandfathers.  The original place was located a few feet west of the southwest corner of Dundas and Chestnut on the south side.  The building is long gone.  Nice man, he used to pinch my cheeks and give me a free soy chicken wing.  Hong Fatt relocated here in the early 80s.  He and his wife and son all worked here and he managed to acquire a Mercedes Benz.

The couple that run the place now:  The old lady really resents having to work here.  No hello or thanks.   The man is nice enough.  Be aware that unsold BBQ meats are refridgerated overnight and sold again the next day.  I've had two occasions when the meat had the beginnings of rancidness. When it's fresh, boy it's terrific.   I go about once a month for crispy skin pork."}
{"text":"Easily one (in the top 3) best Chinese Barbecue place in Toronto. Hole in the wall greasy-spoon but very clean place. Quick service. Come early because this place gets packed during lunch and dinner. Awesome food! The price is so cheap! I'll come back and be sure you will too."}
{"text":"This is one of those restaurants that have been around forever.  In fact, my mom frequented it recently and told me that some of the old servers who used to provide her with BBQ when she was in her 20s are still working there!  Pretty amazing, especially in Toronto where being \"trendy\" is everything.

There is a reason why Hong Fatt BBQ has been around almost forever.  Their BBQ is excellent, possibly one of the best in Chinatown.  Meats were suitably tender and the marinade for the Cha Siew (BBQ Pork?) is not overly sweet like some other places.  Huge chicken wings - great for movie nights at home.  

Would be improved if the interior was better kept.  Hong Fatt is definitely a \"hole in the wall\".  If you are turned off by dingy interiors, I would choose another place in Chinatown.  If, however, you want to experience what Chinatown was like 30 years ago, this is probably the place to hang out along with KIm Moon bakery across the street."}
{"text":"Hong Fatt has the best BBQ pork in the city, by far.  It is $6.99/lb, and the butcher asks if you prefer fatty or lean pork.  Every piece is sweet and tender, not too overwhelming.  The interior is pretty grungy, but the quality of meat is exquisite."}
{"text":"I make it a point to come here at least once a week. Sometimes more than once.

The ambiance is nothing special. The place is clean, if a little dank. Most people there are speaking Cantonese, but the owners can speak English and are fairly friendly. There's a TV constantly playing Cantonese news in the back. 

But the food is incredible. Definitely some of the best BBQ in Toronto. And not just that, it's cheap. I'm talking less than $6 for a plate of BBQ pork on rice with a bone broth soup and tea. You simply cannot find a quality:price ratio this high anywhere else. HIGHLY recommended."}
{"text":"I grew up eating BBQ pork and roasted duck from Hong Fatt. I am now 32 and still love the food! My mother remembers going there when she was a little girl and that was 65 years ago. Her father (my grandfather), knew Hong Fatt, the original owner because they were from the same village in china. Even when I try other \"authentic\" Chinese food places, it still doesn't compare to Hong Fatt! I swear by it!"}
{"text":"Decent cheap eat.  This joint has been around the neighbourhood since forever, and I'm glad they never opt for \"trendy look\" and jack up the price like many other places.  Although the price has increased gradually but it's still cheap as hell comparing to restaurants nearby.  It's definitively a good place for Cantonese comfort food.  I always buy 2 items with rice to go on my way home, generous portion costs only $6+ tax.  I particularly love roasted pork here, always crispy and tender.  Roasted duck is good but tends to be leaner and smaller than other places.  They also offer roasted goose during the summer but I wouldn't recommend it because they tend to be on the dry side.  Also a free soup if dining there.  I think they are cash only place which is fine with me."}
{"text":"Had a mixed barbecue plate which was ok and a portion of Singapore Noodles which was also ok but on the greasy side and needed a lot of spicing up, virtually devoid of shrimps (2 pieces!!). Lot of business from takeout clientele and I guess I would have gotten better BBQ if I had taken the time to direct the cuts that I wanted."}
{"text":"I have NO idea how this place has decent reviews because it's a gross and scary place to eat! The only time I ever dared venture into this place was when a friend of mine decided to pick up a take-out order and he went here because it was run by relatives of someone he was dating. 

The windows have a greasy, uncleaned haze to them, the place is filthy on the inside as well. China town offers so many great options that I have NO idea why this place has been able to stay open over the years.

I'll admit that I have not actually eaten food here so maybe the food tastes amazing but I fear for the hygiene of the kitchen and will unlikely ever risk eating food from this place.

Who knows, maybe all of the other good reviews for this place are right and I'm wrong? Venture forth at your own risk. :P"}
{"text":"Place is now an effin joke. The new owners are rude and off-putting. I am a long time customer of this joint since I was in uni when the original owners ran the place. Over 20yrs as a customer... It was a chinese husband/wife team and their 2nd generation son who spoke fluent english. They always had rude waitresses even back then but was always made up by the owners in niceties or large portions if you're a regular customer. The new owners (esp. the old lady) is a PITA, rude, and no manners. Most businesses appreciate repeat customers but every time I come in she always acts depressed, rarely smiles, and hates working there it seems. She yells at customers for their orders in her low-class way. Any other employer she would be fired. They cheap out on the dish that I want which is usually roasted pork and cha sui on rice. Many times they didnt include veggies or soup. They say \"sold out\" and it's like 7pm, wtf?? That's dinner time when all your inventory should be available. Many a time I had to get my own tea.  They couldnt care less. Never tip these guys. They dont deserve it. The only thing they have going for them is the price. A dish was $4 over 20yrs ago it's only $5.09 now (include tax) is still cheap compared to rest of chinatown."}
{"text":"Hong Fat BBQ has apparently been around for decades, and the prices are still kept low.
When you come for lunch, you can still get a meal for $5 which comes with soup.

However, portion sizes have been steadily going down over the past couple years. I went last week and ordered the BBQ chicken and duck, but it was mostly fat and bones. I was pretty much eating white rice and some cabbage.

Looking at pictures I took from a year and two years back, there was definitely more meat for the same dishes back then. I mean, there was still bones, but it wasn't like 90% bone + fat.

Although it's cheap, given other chinese restaurants in the area that also sell BBQ with price ranges that aren't that far off, I can't say it's a place to grab lunch. Maybe the regular boxes of BBQ are still good."}
{"text":"Family own. Always busy. Always fresh. Best to go early in the morning. Come late evening, there isn't new stuff BBQ'ed by the kitchen. 

If you're looking for take out, they'll able to package for large parties. 

Very traditional; as such, if you don't speak Cantonese, you may need to point, show pictures or have a buddy to translate."}
{"text":"This spot is grungy and looks like a plain old shop but it is by far the best BBQ in Toronto (I grew up with this stuff). Whenever I go in there is a line up and I'll have to wait 5 to 10min to get take out. This is where all the uncles and aunties get their fix. Best of all, it's really really cheap, even in Chinese standards."}
{"text":"100% Authentic.   The duck is crispy but moist.  Soups are delicious.  Don't be fooled by the look. It's worth it!"}
{"text":"It's ridiculously cheap ($5.70 tax incl. for a two BBQ item rice combo) but the cuts aren't always the greatest for the special deal. But If you are only buying meat to go, then you can select the cut you want. NOT a place to bring family, friends or date for a sit-down meal. More suited for the solo diner. Ignore the non-BBQ items on the menu, they are of suspect quality and it also means the grumpy owner-lady has to leave her perch at the cash to go into the kitchen to turn on the wok. Not a happy camper."}
{"text":"The traditional china town restuarant

Good value and good BBQ meat! The meat is always so flavourful. 
Outside and inside is not appealing at all but if the food is good you end up going back for more!

Just don't expect great service and the takeout line takes forever during lunch hour. but still worth the wait."}
{"text":"Awesome BBQ duck, roasted pork and pig ears!! This is a must visit place whenever we are in Toronto from the States. All the meats are flavorful and juicy. Highly recommended. 

The sit down area is pretty plain. Just remember that you are there for the food and not the atmosphere and you will be set. 

Price is fairly reasonable."}
{"text":"I like many who have said before grew up eating here. This place has been around forever. Granted, new owners, \"new\" added to the name. But the stuff is pretty much same inside I think. It still looks grungy and dated, but who cares when you get great value!

I usually eat the BBQ Pork on Rice. This time I had BBQ Pork AND  Roasted Pork on rice, it also has a few veggies on top and a soup. ALL for the price of $4.50. STEAL RIGHT!

I'll definitely keep coming here."}
{"text":"By far one of my favourite places to eat in Chinatown when it come to Chinese bbq/roasted meats. Whenever I can I try to introduce people to this place. Their lunch special is very affordable and filling. It's cheaper than any place I can get around my workplace (King and Spadina) and is worth the walk up. I brought a couple of my work colleagues along... they loved it as well.

The owners are very nice. You can ask the butcher whether or not you want fatty or lean cuts when it comes to the roasted pork or the char sui. Do yourself a favour and try both of them. They are the best I've had in Toronto. The skin on the roasted pork is crispy and delicious and the meat itself is flavoured nicely and moist. The char sui is just awesome. Sweet with a slight bit of saltiness and very tender.

One of my groomsmen bought a whole roasted pig for my stag because what couldn't be more awesome than roasted meat and beer? All the guys at the stag enjoyed it and couldn't get enough. I still get asked about the pig and where we got it. Definitely a hit for a huge party. We had 30-35 guys there and there was still more than half a pig left.

The decor might not be to everyone's standard but if you can get over that and be \"brave\" enough to get over your so-called fears then you have to try this place if you enjoy Chinese roasted/bbq meats.

This is a hidden gem."}
{"text":"I probably come here at least once every two weeks. Usually get the BBQ Pork on Rice ($4.75) or the Soy Sauce Chicken Noodle Soup ($4.25). They raised their prices recently so these are the new prices. The old ones were unbelievable so I'm not surprised it's unsustainable.

Don't expect updated decor, great service. You seat yourself, it's clean (I see them wiping down everything every night), and good value. The BBQ Pork is decent but I would ask for the lean pieces. The chicken sometimes is hit or miss. If I'm looking for a more confident meal, I'll hit up House of Gourmet but in most cases, Hong Fatt will due for around ~$5-6 all in."}
{"text":"This is the second time that I have visited this restaurant. I went there the first time because a friend recommended the place. The first time I went there, the place looks really greasy. The health inspector was there, and she told them to fix a couple of things--they passed, so I guess it was not too major. The lady at the cash register was not very pleasant. The meat was fatty, and it was \"okay...\" I have had better.

I went grocery shopping this week at a grocery store nearby. I decided to give them one more try. I asked for a crispy piece of barbecue pork--I like the burnt caramel pieces. They gave me a large piece. A piece larger than I expected. I did not want to argue as the man already chopped up the pork. They do not accept debit or credit cards. I was short $0.75, so I had to come back. She took $10 out of my hands, and yelled, \"come back later.\" In their defence I did order the barbecue pork, and they can't cut it up and then put it back. I realize that they are a business.

I went down the street to get money. I came back and paid for my order. She didn't say thank you. She grabbed the $20 bill out of my hand, and she gave me back the change. I walked out of the store thinking, \"wow...\"

The barbecue pork was okay...at best. I didn't think that it was worth the value. I might have come on their bad days...I don't know. However, I do not think that I will come back."}
{"text":"Very much a hole in the wall. You don't come for the comfort or decor for sure. But definitely good for some Cantonese style comfort food and BBQ. Usually make it part of my routine when I come to TO. A nice bowl of soup that comes with rice dish is always appreciated. And did I mention the price is dirt cheap? $5 bucks for a 2-item BBQ rice dish plus the aforementioned soup!"}
{"text":"Not the best Chinese BBQ I've ever had. The BBQ pork was far too lean, the roast pork wasn't very tender and the rice was an overcooked mush. There are far better options in the area"}
{"text":"Love this place since my university days! It is a little corner shop that is usually hidden behind a fruit stand in the summer. It is value for money and the food is authentic! I usually get a large plate of BBQ pork on rice and it comes with a big bowl of soup and tea. Their roasted pork and roasted pork skin is also delicious. Crispy, hot and fresh! Considering the price at $5 (all in), you can't really ask for more. You can't really get anything like this anywhere else nowadays. 

For people complaining about the portions, you can just pay a little more for more meat. It is not expensive! So stop being a cheap ass and pay for more meat if you actually want more. 

I also frequently buy take out of their BBQ pork too and it's so crazy cheap. $10 for almost a full box of meat! You can't get this value anywhere else and to top it off, it actually tastes so so good!"}
{"text":"Ordered BBQ duck to go, it tasted great and the price seemed cheaper than other nearby BBQ places.  The couple owners were nice and friendly, they chatted with my friend and I, and gave me some extra minced ginger to try.  I'd love to come back and try out other Items next time."}
{"text":"You don't want to sit and eat there, as it looks a little bit crappy (well... it looks quite crappy) but a roasted duck or BBQ pork to take out is really worth it here! Cheap and really really fresh and so good!

Next time I''ll crave for a roasted duck, I'll go there to take one half or even a full one home! I found THE place for this in Toronto!"}
{"text":"This place provides good value for BBQ that you would find similiarly in Scarborough or Markahm. BBQ pork is priced decently at $6 per pound. I believe there is a dine in option as well. Good service."}
{"text":"Me and my family have been going here for decades. This time I was stoked about trying roasted Goose. initially i was going to another place for roast goose but they were closed on wednesdays so after searching on yelp found Hong Fatt also has roasted goose. I bought a whole one for $38.00  and took it home to my mother and brother. More than enough for 3 people and mom has left over to make soup."}
{"text":"One of the best BBQ places out there. BBQ Pork and roast pork is seriously legit at around $7.50 per pound. Every piece is always tender and super succulent. I am however cautious about their BBQ duck, comparatively it's a bit leaner than some of the other BBQ joints around Chinatown."}
{"text":"Wow so disappointing.....got 3 meats over rice to go:
-Ton of rice, very little meat, probably 4-6 pieces each
-Roasted pork was almost all fat, not even thick crispy skin
-Duck was not juicy or hot
-Cha siu was ok, but thin, and very small portion
So much worse compared to Markham (ie. HKS BBQ in FMP)"}
