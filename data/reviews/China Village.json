{"text":"Love this place!!! Food is delicious and service is great!!! I wish it was closer...will continue to go every chance I get!!!"}
{"text":"The staffs are very friendly and you get good portion for dinner speial which includes soup, 1 egg roll, 1 fried wonton, 1 lemon chicken wing appetizer, rice and full dinner portion for the entree you choose however the taste is just ok. I didnt find any of the dish to be great or want more of."}
{"text":"VERY COOL PLACE. It looks like its right out of bladerunner or pulp fiction. The service is probably the best on the planet. The food is probably not the best but. The people are very  nice. Order the moo shoo Its cool how the Waiter puts it together at your table. He calls it \"Chinese burrito\"  I also like the garlic shrimp but its very garlicky."}
{"text":"Excellent food always consistent. Typical coy fish family owned Chinese food restaurant in phoenix. So good, amongst your average."}
{"text":"All the ladies here are so sweet ! I suggest egg drop soup, wor wonton soup & bean curd with vegetables"}
{"text":"Good basic Chinese food. The service here sets the place apart from other restaurants. This place is family run and they go out of their way to make sure you have a good dining experience."}
{"text":"Not so hidden gem indeed!  Flashback to 1980?  Right.  Fantastic service? Check!  What is better than drinking zombies and letting the sweet sounds of Billy Ocean flow over you?  Killing Zombies or actually being by the ocean.  But alas we are in a parking lot in 115 degree heat in Phoenix Arizona.  China Village is wonderful, one of the few places I would take an out of towner to.  Always solid food and prices.  Have not been let down yet!  Go China Village!  Woohoo! As good as it gets!         (in phoenix Arizona)"}
{"text":"Ohhhhhhh my goodness, for being a first time customer, our waitress was quite aggressive n rude, and actually seemed more interested in assisting two Chinese men (Rude). Our food was worse!!!  Nvr Again  I'm not sure about all these reviews praising this place but yuck yuck yuck!! Maybe these people just don't know what REAL good Chinese food is."}
{"text":"I don't know if I would have visited because of the decor because I can be judgmental that way (it feels like it's back in the 70's) but that would be remiss because we really enjoyed the food. It was Valentines and we went for dinner and ordered beef chow fun and happy family. Also we enjoyed potstickers and a mai tai for me and a long island iced tea for my boyfriend. We felt that it was a good value and fresh food. I do like me a good mai tai I must say and theirs hit the spot."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for decades and they must have all gotten a raise in the last 5 years because I don't remember the staff being this jovial before.  I hope they don't do any renovations anytime soon since the place has a lot of the same old school mid-century charm I remember from long ago.    I only take off one star because of the kung pao beef I ordered.  Over the years, It's been my favorite dish; plenty spicy, and the beef so tender it melted in your mouth.  Now, it's only half as spicy, and the beef is no longer tender, but breaded and fried.  That makes it no longer gluten-free, which limits menu choices for some.  I'll definitely be coming back though, to try some of the other dishes I see recommended here."}
{"text":"we ordered three entrees for delivery. it took about forty five minutes and then the delivery guy proceeded to argue with my boyfriend over how much he should tip him. after finally handing over the greasy box with our food in it, we were disgusted to see some form of batter and seeds that should have been my sesame chicken. it was ominously labeled \"HCl.\" the food was disgusting and I can't believe how rude the delivery guy was. we paid 35 dollars for nothing but disappointment. buyer beware. we certainly won't be back here."}
{"text":"Old school Chinese restaurant, this is our regular spot for Chinese food!  Our favorite dishes are the Kung Pao Chicken, Sweet and Sour Chicken, Moo Shu Pork, and Kung Pao Beef.    Go for the lunch menu and you get egg drop soup, 2 pork wontons, and an egg roll with your entree for around $6 or $7!  All served with a pot of hot tea!  Great service, you can get in and out quickly if you want to."}
{"text":"Super friendly service. My girlfriend and I went here after the Cardinals game. I ordered the hot and sour soup which was great and general chicken. I didn't really care for the suace on the general chicken but that is just me. I would definatley go back and try another dish. Its much more inviting on the inside then it looks."}
{"text":"First the good.  Service was good, menu was extensive, and facility was pleasant, but dated.  Food was bland.  I had the Kung Pao Chicken Special, and everything was forgettable.  Egg drop soup and egg roll were without a distinguishing taste.  Overall the food is a 2 and everything else is a 3."}
{"text":"Bad food and worse service!  Any place that can make Chinese mustard tasteless is a special kind of awful!"}
{"text":"My husband and I just moved to the area and we're trying to find a decent delivery place.   I called and the gal informed me the delivery driver hadn't shown up, no big deal we got take out - we ordered sweet and sour chix, yui shan, and some wings.  Everything was overcooked, over sauced, and overly sweet.  Of course we expect sweet and sour chix to be sweet but the poor chix was swimming in a sugar thick broth.  There wasn't a vegetable to speak of in the yui shan chix, it was bland, rubbery and swimming in a thick heavy syrup.  Yuck - we will not go back and will never order delivery.  Yuck, Yuck"}
{"text":"Best Authentic Chinese Food in Arcadia! Great For Lunch, Too!!  I have been attending this great establishment since my siblings were in diapers (!) - decades - and their food is excellent. Great moo shoo (pork and chicken), excellent pu pu platter, the best chicken and vegetables I've ever tasted - I order extra spicy, which entails the addition of chili paste. The staff is so friendly and gets to know their customers. They serve hot tea with each meal, and have a beautiful, clean restaurant. They also offer drinks and Tsing Tao - which I haven't seen offered too often - I love it! Highly recommended, and happy every time. The spicy mustard is also worth writing HOME about if you love spicy! Great staple of Arcadia."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I went there on our lunch break. The lunch specials were so reasonably priced i wasn't expecting all too much. In addition to hot tea I received two fried wontons, an egg roll, fried rice, and egg drop soup with my generals chicken. Our server made the experience though. Roger was super attentive and super hilarious. If you go make sure to request the mini-chopsticks!"}
{"text":"Past take-out from China Village has always been good, but the dine-in experience was great. Service was fast and attentive and the staff were all very friendly and accommodating. The food was fresh and came out piping hot. The spring rolls were perfectly crispy and everything we ordered (orange chicken and kung pao veggie dinner plates) had great flavor. I'll definitely be back and am happy I took the time to dine in instead of pick up like usual."}
{"text":"This place was horrible  We normally go to China Chili ( Which we will from now on)  Once we got there we waited 10 mins to be sat ( No one else was there... ) When we sat down we were given 2 waters and soup (We were never asked what we wanted to drink we had to tell them) After about 20 mins of waiting for them to come take our order we ordered the Hot and sour spicy soup ( More sour then anything and was pretty bland) an order of pot stickers ( Tasted like they came out of a freezer bag and boiled?) Mongolian beef ( Was WWAAYYY over cooked and had no flavor) and the Twice cooked pork ( Very oily and greasy ...and that's pretty much what it tasted like). All in all the food was just not good.....We took everything home and by the time we did get home we decided to  throw it in the dumpster because that is where it belonged.....  People...If you want FANTASTIC Chinese food every time...Just go to China Chili"}
{"text":"We are new to Yelp so I have never left a review, but it has been so helpful to us in the recent past, I feel compelled to start.   I'm new to the neighborhood, so a good Chinese restauraunt is an important find. I was really happy with our experience with China Village the other night. We've been doing a lot of take out lately, and it's been hit and miss ( except with my Yelp leads), but the whole experience was satisfying. We called at 9:30pm and yet the food was  fresh and the gal was very friendly. We just had basic Beef Brocolli, Lemon Chicken, Sweet/Sour Pork & Chicken Fried Rice, but it was very satisfying. And when I asked for hot mustard, they gave us the good stuff in little cups, not packets.  Their dishes have a distinct flavor that is very good, not overwhelming at all, but not just the same old..."}
{"text":"We've been going to this restaurant for about 2 years now. As a little background story, it is family owned and operated. The family immigrated to the US but first spent some time in Vietnam, thus the Vietnamese dished on the menu in addition to the Chinese.   The place is indeed a bit antiquated in decor but it really makes up for it in food-flavor. The best way to enjoy this place is to go there with a few people and eat the food family-style. Sometimes you get to sit in the big booth table with the lazy-Susan. The last time I was there, I sat with a group of 7 people and each person ordered a different dish.   My favorites are the House-Chicken which is a lightly battered and fried, and then they pour a light sweet-soy type sauce over it. The hot and sour soup is also very tasty. You can order it extra spicy if you want. It has all kinds of veggies, and shrimp, pork and tofu as well. Another good choice is the fried rice they make: pork or house fried rice are quite delicious. Oh and I almost forgot the walnut shrimp. OMG! DELICIOUS!!!!!!! My pregnant sister can't have enough of that.  The servers sometimes make fruit drinks that they hand out with crushed ice. I'm not sure if we get those because they know us or just because. We usually have water to drink so I can't comment on soda-pricing.   The waiters/waitresses have accents because they were not born in the US. Some people should just get over that.   I've been telling other friends about this place and I'll expect to go there again in the next few weeks."}
{"text":"Delicious food, great little place off the 51 (good place to stop off on the way home). I actually ate with the early birds at 5:00pm and so the waitress seemed preoccupied with the regulars (which was fine--I got everything I needed without being constantly pestered with questions and such).  The waitress has a personality to herself---quite funny (and greatly dislikes highways), and has a bit of an accent but that just shows the authenticity of the place.  For a meal, I had the veggie egg rolls and Mongolian beef---both of which were good (not the greatest but far from the worst). For the price, it's hard to beat.  Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. They stay open till 9:30 pm and are very accommodating. We had almond chicken, chicken fried rice, beef broccoli, and sweet & sour chicken. We all enjoyed our meal. I recommend this place to eat."}
{"text":"I studied abroad in china in college and this is the best Chinese food I've had since. The staff is incredibly friendly and the price is right!"}
{"text":"Bought two different lunch specials today. Spicy beef and Kung pao Chicken. Both were excellent. Good portions and very tasty with the right amount of heat. I was especially impressed with the beef dish because of the amount of beef. A lot of places give a few pieces of beef and a ton of onions and peppers. Not here, it was mostly very tender beef with nice bite size pieces of onion and green Bell peppers. Called in the order and was ready when I got there. They opened at 1100 and there were already a few people sitting down in their dining area. Definitely one of my new spots when I'm the area."}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor and try the House Chicken.  I am not even sure if I have had anything else here. I've been coming here for 15 years and its all I get. It is AMAZING.  And the staff here is so great.  I have been living on the west side and really miss this gem!"}
{"text":"China Village was a popular Christmas Eve stop for my family when I was a kid in the 80s. After decades of not visiting I decided to check it out again and it's EXACTLY as I remember. If you're looking for a nostalgic old school Americanized Chinese restaurant with all the trimmings (Chinese zodiac placemats, fortune cookies, 80s decor) then this is the place - and the food is actually solid."}
{"text":"We had the the kung pow chicken and sweet and sour pork dinner specials. Would recommend the Kung pow chicken. The sweet and sour pork was battered and fried which was a surprise! Everything we ate was delicious! Good sized portions. Service was great and well timed. Surprisingly flavorful veggie egg roll! Definitely will return."}
{"text":"Think I found my new Chinese restaurant places little ran down probably scared to some at night but their pineapple shrimp dish was phenomenal sweet little spicy even the shrimp is cooked perfectly a server was very nice and helpful even though her English was pretty bad but she need the menu very helpful at suggestions definitely spot to hit we'll be back as soon as I can"}
{"text":"We stopped here late one Monday night. This place is very decorative inside. The host suggested the specials and even gave us a sample of Chow fung. It was delicious so we ordered it. The food just kept coming! For $14 you get a dinner special of an entree, egg roll, crab Rangoon, soup, and honey chicken! They were very friendly. They gave us fresh coconut macaroons for dessert as well! I have found my new favorite Chinese restaurant in Phoenix. The food was fresh and delicious!"}
{"text":"Chinese isn't usually my first choice when I'm having a meal out on the town... but I'd go back to this place for sure. (Now that I'm seeing some of the reviews, I'm wishing I tried the egg drop soup. But there's always a next time!)  Hubby ordered the Tangerine Beef (breaded meat in a thick brown sauce with a slight kick of spice)... I ordered the Kung Pao Chicken (thinly sliced chicken in a sauce that isn't as thick with peanuts and green onions). Both were great. We also ordered the Bo Bo plate for two... which is a fun way to try several apps in one. You also get hot tea and plenty of perfectly-cooked, sticky white rice with your meal. We spent less than $40 with the tip... and we both left happy with two boxes of leftovers. (So if you don't want leftovers... definitely share!)  We had to laugh at the music. It had to be Disney princess songs in Chinese.... or some sort of compilation of love ballads. Totally cheesy... but worth it for the food. And, the staff was lovely. Very attentive, definitely authentic, and sweet as can be.  I haven't yelped in years, honestly... but this little spot (combined with some free time I haven't had in awhile) prompted me to log in and write a review!"}
{"text":"Found my Chinese food spot!   I'm now day dreaming about their lemon chicken!  I ordered takeout and another customer was picking up his order too! He said he has probably ordered every item on the menu and everything has always been delicious... and then the woman who helped take my order on the phone gave me a box with my food and welcomed me in saying they've been open for over 30 years!  I highly recommend stopping in here :D"}
{"text":"Best Chinese place and the friendliest service. Yummy Mu shu chicken, rolled up vor you at the table. Inded , yhe service with the bowtie is a great assest (isn't he the owner?). Also, this is a place that listens when you request spicy. Just because you're white, a lot of restaurants will adjust the spicyness, not here they'll a comodate the customers wishes."}
{"text":"I am giving 3 Stars  solely because the \"waiter with the bow tie\" helped us get through the ordeal of a meal at China Village. I regret to say that fellow Yelpers misled me into thinking I was going to get a good meal here.  Made hubby travel quite a distance to try this well reviewed restaurant.   Here's the scoop: They charge 1.50 for the noodles that every other restaurant routinely puts on the table.  They charge 1.50 for brown rice per person.   Ordered the PHO (a vietnamese soup) which is on the menu although it is a chinese restaurant. The soup which consisted of noodles, chicken and broth was accompanied by very, very fresh basil, cilantro, jalapeños, bean sprouts and lime.  Ample and fresh.  The soup broth, although it was chicken PHO, had a fishy backdrop taste.  Can't explain it but it was there.  Hubby gave it a 7 on a scale of 1 to 10.  Ordered the Walnut shrimp which was fried so much so that the batter had totally adhered to the shrimp. The crust outside the shrimp was much too thick.  The sauce was nothing more than mayonnaise.  The General Chicken which we had asked for extra spicy was not spicy at all.  When we told the waiter about it, he brought over some \"spicy oil\" to add to the dish to make it spicy.  Who wants to add oil to your food to make it spicy? Why not add chilies to the food while it is being sautéed as other restaurants do?  When the orders came out, the server only brought out one brown rice and that we should share it until we  get another one later.  The order of brown rice was small enough to fit in the palm of my small hand and the rice was as hard as a rock.  My culinary savvy told me that the rice had been overly microwaved and that's why it harden so much so that it was inedible. Don't restaurants keep rice in rice cookers to keep it warm??? We showed the waiter to which he said he would bring another rice, but by then we had already finished eating.  I also told him  that I hoped that he wasn't charging us  for that rice.  He said he would go back and modify the bill.  I was stupefied that the reduction was not done immediately considering that I showed him that the rice could bounce off a wall.   The straws I requested at the beginning of our meal never arrived and napkins were in short supply All in all the meal was second rate and I apologize to my hubby for sending him on a wild goose chase 15 miles away from our home thinking we were going to have a lovely Saturday night meal.  And by the way... this is no East Coast type restaurant... FAR from it!"}
{"text":"The place definitely looks iffy on the outside, but I'm so glad I stopped in! Typical Chinese restaurant atmosphere, dark but nice. My mom went to the bathroom and said it was very clean.   The food was amazing- I ordered the Hawaiian chicken and the crab wontons and my mom custom ordered something with seafood with a dark, spicy sauce (I'm not sure what), with brown rice.   My main review is for the awesome gentleman who served us. He was SO NICE and was so willing to work with my (admittedly difficult) mother who didn't want anything sweet, can't eat meat, doesn't like this, doesn't like that. He was so tolerant and they were able to whip her up a custom dish with shrimp that she just loved. That alone would make me come back.  Another plus- the food tastes EXACTLY THE SAME when reheated in the microwave two days later! How often does that happen? I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Lovely experience....fun and engaging staff...really good food!  Will return soon!  They brought out the most delicious dessert on the House!"}
{"text":"Our go to takeout place when we are craving just good ole Chinese classics.   Have only ordered takeout but have never been disappointed with the dishes, quality or size of portions.   Egg roll are really awesome and are happy to replace white rice with brown rice for a small up charge."}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite Chinese eatery in Arizona. I've been coming here for 7 years....the food is delicious & the staff is courteous. They remember your name & give you free tea with your meal. This place is my hidden little gem in the desert & definitely worth a visit.....xxoo!"}
{"text":"I have also gone here for dinner with my boyfriend.  The food and service was sooooooooo good!  I ordered the moo shu pork, and they served it to me after making the wraps at my table.  This reminds me of the Chinese restaurants in New York City when I was a kid.  I can't wait to take my parents here."}
{"text":"Last Friday, I wanted some Chinese food (american-for those who want to know) so me and my bf decided to hit this place up due to it having a high rating. Boy, was it good!  When they seated us, we were served promptly with hot tea and water (I asked for hot tea but she told me they automatically give it to us) the tea was delicious.   I ordered the house special chicken and bf ordered Thai chicken which was the special of the day. Mine was really tasty and he enjoyed his too. Very well portioned for lunch. Didn't leave us hungry or bloated. We will come back! Also, our waiter was very nice and funny."}
{"text":"China Village is a time-warp kind of place, where red and gold predominates,the booths are comfy and private and exotic cocktails like Mai-Tais and Scorpions still exist. Sure it's Americanized Chinese food, but like the classic places(R.I.P. China Doll, Autumn Court)it has a certain charm.  Add to this a nice selection of unusual dishes, good assortment of vegetarian selections and yes, even a daily Happy Hour! The staff is wonderful, bordering on the comedic. I love Tangerine Orange Beef, and they make it well. It's hard to not eat the leftovers(portions are huge and reasonably priced)a few hours later. And the next day for lunch.   It's that good."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this more stars, I really do.  They had good food and service for a great price.    Unfortunately there was a man having lunch in the restaurant who was OBNOXIOUSLY SHOUTING rather than talking.  So loud, I could barely hear myself think when I was reading the menu.  I understand he was elderly,  BUT HE WAS SCREAMING.  Not to mention the things he was shouting were totally inappropriate like 'kids seeing naked men for the first time' and 'where to buy dynamite'.    When I asked a waitress if she would say something to him, she just said \"he's been coming here for years, he just can't hear well\".  I understand that he's a regular,  but if they EVER want to gain any new regulars (like younger people who spend more money...) they need to tell this guy to QUIET DOWN!!!"}
{"text":"I live only a couple minutes down the road from this place, and I am so sad that it took me almost a year before trying it out. The food is delicious and the most authentic-tasting that I've had in Phoenix. Egg rolls are greasy but delicious, the more \"American\" dishes like General Chicken are spot on, and the more authentic stuff like Hunan Beef (do yourself a favor and give it a try) is amazing.  Service is heavily accented but very friendly and pleasant. They also have a decent happy hour until 7:30pm weekdays. I'll be going back again and again."}
{"text":"Some of the best Chinese food I've had in a long time! Everything was delicious! We split the hot and sour soup, chicken chow mein, orange chicken, and eggrolls. The service was amazing. So friendly and never had to wait for a drink refill. Will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"I really like that as soon as you sit down they bring over a pot of hot tea. The customer service here is awesome and really inviting. The food isn't great but isn't bad, enough that I think 3 stars is reasonable. The real winner was the hot and sour soup, its really hard to find a place that can make the soup properly and they have it down pretty good. Other than that the rest of our items were pretty average on the taste scale (orange chicken, house special chicken, bo-bo platter). The house special chicken sauce was a little watery for my liking. The egg rolls that came with the bo-bo platter were the \"premade frozen in a bag\" type and even though they tasted ok an egg roll is something simple enough that a restaurant can make really tasty if they would just spent some extra hours out of the week preparing and rolling them by hand. Also I'm used to having crab puffs come along with a bo-bo platter (or pupu platter, whatever a restaurant decides to call it) but what we got instead looked like fried wonton with a dot of meat inside it. Not a place I am dying on to return any time soon but the customer service and décor and feel the place has certainly deserves a visit sometime in the future."}
{"text":"I was in town -- will be moving there soon -- and looking for some good Chinese food. I haven't had any in years. Anyway, I spotted China Village and decided to give it a try, and am so happy I did. Hot tea is brought without having to ask for it (just like they all used to do!), and the food was great. Plus, the people were absolutely delightful! Wonderful service and so friendly.   I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I went to China Village for the first time today.  I was going to order my regular Mongolian Beef from Pei Wei, but I had a hankerin' for an egg roll and some egg drop soup, too.  It was lunchtime during the week, so I figured I could find a place with a lunch special which included all of those things.  I came across great reviews for China Village on Yelp, and did not feel compelled to look elsewhere.  I couldn't find a comprehensive (or solely take-out) menu online, so I ordered carry-out inside the restaurant.  The building is lilac, and boasts 2 signs out front.  The aroma once stepping inside was delicious!  I was greeted immediately upon my entrance, and asked the hostess for a takeout menu.  She was very kind, warm, didn't rush me, but waited at the register while I decided what to order.    I did not find exactly what I was looking for.  The lunch menu had 20 entrée possibilities, ranging in price from $6.50 to $7.75, which included a vegetable egg roll, fried wonton, and fried rice.  No soup.  There was a rather comprehensive soup section in the menu (sizzling rice, wor wonton, hot & sour, egg flower, corn & cream, vegetables & bean curd, seafood), ranging in price from $6.25 to $7.95: one size only.  I asked the hostess if they had a smaller size soup - as I wasn't about to pay $7 for my lunch and another $7 for a gallon of soup - and she said that the smaller size is $5 and that it's better to get the larger size (demonstrating the difference in sizes with her hands).  To me, $5.00 was still too much, so I abandoned the soup idea at that point.  I settled on the Mongolian Beef lunch special, and it was ready in no time.  Seriously, I read one email on my phone, and was in mid-response when my order was ready!  It also smelled heavenly.    Upon returning to the office, I opened up the package, and actually laughed.  From reading other reviews on Yelp, I was expecting a feast of sorts.  Instead, I could barely see the egg roll, and the rice serving was a firm scoop.  One of the compartments in the serving tray was dedicated to sauces and fortune cookies (which I don't consider food).  I felt cheated, but the aroma was so inviting that I did not lose hope.    I tried the egg roll first.  It was light, juicy, and so so so flavorful!  I had never tasted one like this before.  My perspective began to change.  I am, traditionally, one who goes for cheap food, which frequently runs the risk of being nasty and/or dry.  So, it was very possible I was out of my element with China Village.  After finishing the egg roll, I wished that they had included an entire compartment of them!  (Or just made them 12 times larger.)  Next up was the main entrée.  It had onions and green things (sorry, that's the best I can do) in it, which I quarantined to the non-food compartment.  The beef was thinly sliced and perfectly tender.  I felt ashamed eating it out of a Styrofoam container with a plastic fork.  The sauce was a savory, slightly sweet, gravy.  The fried rice had little highlights of egg in it, nothing else.  It, too, was perfectly moist.  After I had finished all of the beef, there still was ample sauce and rice left.  Until I ate it all, of course.  :-)  So, bottom line?  Although it was not what I was expecting (or looking for, to be honest), I would not hesitate to go there again.  It provided a level of pure food-eating-pleasure which I had never experienced with Chinese cuisine before.  I would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I can't tell you how many times I have driven past this place without giving it a second thought.  Today, I happened to be in the area and was craving a quick Chinese lunch.  This is one of the friendliest places around, and the subtle aroma of fresh Chinese food wafts toward you as you enter.  Seated immediately, I waited less than a minute for ice water and hot tea.  I chose the General chicken.  Spicy, crispy, full of flavor accompanied by crunchy egg roll and wontons.  That hit the spot!  Oh the soup was good too.  Service was attentive but not hovering. Got out of there for eight bucks....score!"}
{"text":"Best chinese food in the valley that I have found. Consistently good for the 10 years that I've been eating here. The food has flavor, the people are extra nice. I recommend the Kung Pao Chicken, egg rolls, and Pork Fried Rice. The pepper steak, beef egg foo young are also great."}
{"text":"Delicious Chinese food and family friendly and welcoming waitstaff!  They were very accommodating to our young children and the seafood pot and beef was fresh and yummy."}
{"text":"Love this little place! The food is always fresh and the staff are very pleasant. We just keep coming back!"}
{"text":"We just moved to the area and we were craving Chinese. I am so happy we tried China Village. The inside is nice and clean, the owner came out to talk to us and he was super friendly and funny. I got the BBQ Pork with Bean Curd and my husband got the Hunan Chicken. Both came out very fast and done wonderfully. Tea was complimentary which is always nice and was not over brewed like a lot of places. There are a lot of Chinese Food choices in this area but I highly recommend China Village!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"My favorite family Chinese in Pittsburgh!  Best Won ton soup, egg rolls and fried rice (darkened by soy sauce). Lomein , Moo Gu gi pan yummy!  Service is the best part Kitty with her husband Kwan are the owners and Chief cooks and bottle washers.  They do it all and do it well. Cash only but you don't need much prices are very cheap. Freshly made everything (except the classic fortune cookie in the plastic wrapper and wouldn't have it any other way!). Great Oolong tea with every meal!"}
{"text":"Thus far, this is the best Chinese restaurant I've found since moving here from Chicago.  If you're looking for something more on the authentic side, you'll have to keep searching... but if you seek Americanized Chinese food, it's pretty good.    Your best bet is having one of their lunch specials which features an egg roll, a fried wonton, egg fried rice, plus entree for $7-8.  The portions for it are generous and the food is made to order and fresh.  I have also been to this establishment for dinner with a couple of my friends eating family style and everything we had was rather tasty.    Although the decor is outdated and reminds me of a stereotypical 80s Chinese restaurant, what they lack in decor they make up for in service.  Their staff is friendly, patient, and kind.  They even recognized my friends since they've been there a few times now, which is always a plus.  Only disappointment for me is their lack of Cantonese style chow mein and chow fun.  Now if only I could find a place with amazing fresh chow fun... The search continues!"}
{"text":"It had been years since my last visit....the decor has the same \"Classic Phoenix/Arcadia feel. The service then and now is what separates this valley favorite. From the moment you walk expect a warm welcome and attentive personalized service.  The menu items are traditional Chinese. The flavors of each item ordered was delightful and unique. Dinner combos are a bit pricey for valley Chinese, $15-$17, but I say the exemplary service is worth it.  The head chef, owner will personally make a visit to inquire about the quality and taste of your orders.  I would highly recommend. 4 out of 5 stars for price point."}
{"text":"A quick review: I bought two quarts of soup for carry out today, Egg Flower (like egg drop) & Hot and Sour. While I waited I was offer hot tea, which was a great gesture of customer service. Since I believe my order to be ready momentarily I declined the offer. The soups were piping hot and packaged to go not sooner after. The Hot and Sour definitely had more vegetables than I am used but was very hearty. The breakout star was definitely the Egg Flower soup as my mouth is extremely happy as this one also had a great deal of vegetables. Needless to say, I will return for dine in service very soon!"}
{"text":"I cannot I haven't reviewed this restaurant before. The chef is one of the mainstays in Chinese cooking here in Phoenix (from what I have been told & read); I have had over the past 20+ years several different dishes here. I haven't been there to eat in a while; and usually get take out on occasion. My favorite dishes have been the soups, all of them. Egg Rolls, Fried Wontons, basic dishes like Mu-Shu Chicken or Pork; Kung Pao Shrimp or Chicken, Sweet & Sour Chicken or Pork. Last takeout order; got the Pho which was very good and extremely great value."}
{"text":"Haven't  been to the  restaurant  in ten years. We started  with the egg drop soup . It was warm but had no flavor. The egg rolls were very oily . The crab puffs were much better with plenty of cream cheese . We then tried  the garlic chicken and shrimp  . It was half onions. The chicken  was too dry and only a couple of ship which tasted old . The louse chow me in was better but oily . The food had too much msg. Service was good but there were no customers.  I will  pass on this restaurant"}
{"text":"Fast and Friendly customer service. Food arrived quickly and I was steaming hot. They offer great lunch and dinner specials will be returning soon."}
{"text":"This place is a little run-down & old. The food is average as well as the service.  The staff rush you to order right away & bring you the check before your last bite."}
{"text":"It was Sunday night and our favorite Chinese food spot was closed so Yelp pointed me to the next best thing! I popped in and ordered carry-out. We ordered their beef with vegetables and orange chicken, each came with white rice. It was PLENTY to feed two of us, probably could have even fed three (we were just little piglets after a long day of driving around town). The beef and vegetables was my favorite for sure. It is basically beef and broccoli but with ALL kinds of veggies (yum!). We will definitely order from here again!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite chinese restaurant in Phoenix.  Their food is great without being overwhelmed with veggies to cheapen the protein dishes.  I love their General Tso Chicken and House chow mein.  If you are looking for something different and special try their whole fish preparations they are delish"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic I had the moo shoo pork dinner special that included the four sample side dishes. Great friendly staff, I'll be back for more for sure."}
{"text":"Came in for a late lunch. Had the sizzling rice soup and the chicken and shrimp in garlic sauce. Both were very good We will return when in the area again."}
{"text":"I love this place. They have great cocktails too. Their sizzling rice is the best. The servers are friendly. There is a bar area too. The atmosphere of the restaurant is kind of moody though. But some people like it that way. I just don't, personally."}
{"text":"Picked this place because it has a 4-star rating.  Ordering process was a bit of an ordeal.  Place was empty around dinner time.  Egg roll was good.  Food did not arrive at the same time.  General Tso chicken is a bit gross.  Please remind me to never go back.  Loud.  Dirty bathrooms.  If not for the egg roll, I would go with only one star.  Help - Bring me the check so I can leave!!  So bad that even Panda Express would laugh at this place.  Can't blame the Restaurant, but even my fortune was stupid."}
{"text":"I'm surprised this place has good reviews because I've tried it multiple times and the food just isn't very flavorful. Every time I douse it in sweet and sour sauce or salt to make it taste like something (yuck). However, the people are very friendly, which is why I'm going with three stars instead of two."}
{"text":"So far its the best Chinese food I've had in East Valley.  So far...  I got the General's chicken and my friend go the sweet and sour pork.  They seem to over-fry, the chicken and pork morsels in the dishes were a little tough and the fried wanton had a dark-gray center.  But I could see the potential in the sauces.  If only they would control the fryer a little, it would be almost excellent..  The prices look pretty decent.  I'm going to try Jade Palace next and see how they compare to pick my go-to place!"}
{"text":"The Short: A downtown Chinese restaurant still holding onto archetypes linked to 'the good old days.'   The Pros: - Friendly and personable staff. - Food comes out fresh and hot. - Vintage decor.  The Cons: - One refill maximum on soda. - Staff members barely speak English. - A singular ingredient often overpowers flavor of food.  - Restaurant policies are designed for you to eat menu items the way they see fit or spend tons of $$$. ***EX: All items come only with white rice. You have to spend $1.50 for a small cup of friend rice. No substitutions.***  ______________________________________________________  The Story:  I haphazardly found China Village on my way to a concert at the Rhythm Room. I wanted something in my stomach before starting my night of music and debauchery. Before even checking my trusty Yelp app, the restaurant caught my attention with its folksy outside décor. Its exterior resemblance to Chicago's China district convinced me that it would, at the very least, have the basics of (American style) Chinese cuisine mastered. So, ignoring the old idiom, 'never judge a book by its cover,' I parked my car and walked into what ended up being an antiquated social environment.   First, I'd like detail the food. The menu is laid out in a similar manner to any local Chinese restaurant across America. I always wondered why these are so similar. Is there a database they buy them from? Does the Chinese government teach its citizens how to sell to Americans prior to getting their passports approved? Is it a subliminal demonstration of the Red Dragon's united might? More than likely, the answer is I just eat too much Chinese food.   China Village lost some points with me from the very start with their policies. First, sodas, which run $2 for a comically small cup, are limited to a single refill. This is often the highest profit item for restaurants and the owners plan to keep it that way with their authoritarian statute. Second, all items come with white rice. No substitutions. You can purchase a small cup of fried rice for $1.50, but you are still getting a large serving dish of white rice. God help you if you don't eat it all! The judgmental looks I got put me back in the mindset of a preschooler getting lectured about starving Ethiopians for not finishing dinner.   The dishes are presented in an alluring manner but lack any true substance. I ordered the house chicken, which on the menu boasted a plethora of ingredients. Expecting an orgasm, insert childish laughter here, of subtle and complex flavors; I was surprised when all I could taste was garlic. That's it. It didn't have a hint of poultry, nor a snifter of spice, or even a splash of citrus. Just garlic. On the bright side, I no longer stay awake at night in fear that the kid from Twilight will break through my bedroom window. Not because he played a vampire in a movie, but because all actors are soulless creatures that live off the blood of others and are repelled by garlic. It's just a scientific fact.   Lastly, I'd like to detail the atmosphere. The entire décor of the restaurant has been well taken care of but appears as if it hasn't been updated since the '80s. The staff, while genuinely courteous, followed too many stereotypes to not be deliberate. Every decision I made was met with a compliment pertaining to my ability or intelligence. No one spoke more than a few words of broken English and all the servers were women.   I'm just an old chunk of coal. I don't know how to tell authentic Chinese cuisine from that being altered for American tastes. I'm not privy of the social markers indicative to Chinese hospitality.   I do know when front is being put up. I'm understand that just because someone talks or acts a certain way doesn't mean they are creating traditional delicacy.   The reason for this front became alarmingly apparent while watching fellow patrons of China Village. The less English a hostess spoke the more they were tipped and the happier the customer appeared. It was an experience for them; especially those over 60.   The workers and owners of this establishment are merely responding to an economic incentive. People are awarding them for acting a certain way. Maybe this reminds them of 'the good old days' when an Asian American was only from China or Japan. There's a chance customers don't realize they are sending hegemonic messages. Overall, I don't think this is done with some malicious intent in mind, but it's not something I want to support.   The food here isn't really that tasty, and because I'm not into the pageantry being displayed, there is very little reason for me to come back."}
{"text":"Pros: not busy, quiet, rice, priced ok  Cons: beef and chicken are mooshy, people don't speak ANY English, they get crazy when you ask if the tip is already included, and the portion sizes are very small.  I'll never come back."}
{"text":"Sweet & spicy: the staff are incredibly sweet & genuinely happy to feed your hungry tummy.    After entering, we waited only about 2 minutes but I saw her busy with another table so I wasn't worried. When she did notice, she was soooooo cutely ('sweet'-ly) apologetic with a gracious smile. Than our waiter, Roger, was the 'spicy' part haha. Ok my food was!  But he wasssss funny. No swimming or sushi from the fish tank haha!!  You have to have been there for whole convo.   It was great that he explained what vegetables was in my Hunan beef dish & gladly exchanged them for other veggies for me that I like better. He agreed with me that it's better than wasting food by pushing it to the side of your dish. And they made it extra spicy for me.    The dessert treat (macaroon) after our meal was awesome & served warm!!  And free!!  Truly great experience!!"}
{"text":"This was a great discovery! This place is right around the corner from my family. Ordered Yu Shan chicken for the first time and it was great. Their Ma Po tofu is sweet and the tofu is soft. The chow mein is great and they don't skimp on ingredients. Absolutely did not disappoint."}
{"text":"Food was great and service was fantastic. I went here on a Thursday evening and there weren't but a hand full of tables being used. I chose from the dinner specials, the House Chicken and made it spicy and added extra veggies. I thought there would be more veggies than I got but my chicken portion was huge. I found them from looking at the photos on yelp and the food is as good as it looks in al of the pictures! I do have to say again the service was great. I can see why they've been in business for so long! A must try!"}
{"text":"Best Chinese in Phoenix!! 10 times better than china chili... The egg rolls are authentic and very good"}
{"text":"This is a solidly good Gringo Chinese restaurant. (AKA not the most authentic Chinese I've ever eaten, but certainly pretty decent when you're in the mood for standard fare like General Tso's chicken, chow mein or beef and broccoli.)  Another plus: this is one of the only Chinese restaurants in the Arcadia-Biltmore area that delivers.    I'm giving China Village three stars for inconsistency. The first time I ordered delivery from them, my (vegetarian) Pho was quite literally amazing. The broth, which came in its own plastic container, tasted flavorful and comforting. But the really incredible part was the fresh veggies I received in a separate styrofoam container. (When you eat Pho, the broth is intended to be poured over the veggies, which then cook in the hot liquid.) They were so fresh and beautiful that they looked as though they jumped out of the pages of a culinary magazine. Due to the freshness  and selection of the produce that came with the Pho, my meal was incredible.   I don't know who was cooking in the kitchen at China Vullage that day, but I don't think that person's been back since. Ever since that first Pho order, subsequent orders have just been \"meh.\" And no other dish comes close to equalling the quality or complexity of that first magical Pho order."}
{"text":"The pleasantly spicy Hunan Beef and House Chop Suey are faves!  Been going here for years."}
{"text":"Just ate here and YUM! Their hot and sour soup is to die for. Yummy Jasmine tea, Crab Rangoons and Egg Foo Young. After searching forever for a good Chinese place in Phoenix my search is over. I will be returning again and again."}
{"text":"These have got to be the friendliest and most jovial chinese restaurant employees I have ever encountered.  Most chinese restaurants always have efficient and courteous servers, but not here. One of the gentlemen even continually makes jokes with you while taking your order.  And after all these years, as I have indicated in my tip for this place, they have by far the best sweet and sour whole fish in the valley!  It is a personal treat for me to come here during those special occasions that are pertinent to me; such as a birthday or other significant events.  Today was no different. We just received excellent news, and my wife wanted me to treat myself, and she already knew where that would be. Yes, we can eat anywhere, and have visited many places all over.   However, until there is another place in town that serves a whole sweet and sour fish that is as scrumptious as this; this will be our go to place. It's been that way for as long as we have been married.  We ordered other things with it as well, such as the house special chicken, the chow fun noodles, and the house special fried rice. Everything was delicious, as always.  They even gave us coffee cake for dessert even though we didn't ask for it, and it wasn't bad.  The only bad thing was that they had a broken soda dispenser, and the diet pepsi was atrocious.  They kept asking and verifying if we were sure that we wanted the whole fish, and what size we wanted as they have a small, medium and large whole fish. Ours was a medium and ran $24, and the large one is around $36 or more. Make sure you call ahead an hour or more beforehand, as it takes that long to procure and prepare this delicacy.  All in all, you won't be disappointed with their offerings."}
{"text":"China Village has been around for over 45 years. I grew up w/ this staff. Never disappointed! The dining area is a lil out dated but comfy. Prices are still very low. Lunch specials w/ all the trimmings, 6.95 and you leave very content. They are open 7 days a week. And EVERY holiday! I recently went and had there yummy lemon chicken. My favorite meal is there sizzling rice shrimp. They also have a banquet room and bar..."}
{"text":"Little dingy inside, but the food was tasty. Not the best chinese food I've had, but the best I've had in Phoenix thus far."}
{"text":"great service! our server was super sweet and really involved with making sure we were satisfied with our meal. the food is good but the service made the experience so much better. completely recommend to anyone looking for a place to eat that will make them feel like they're at home!"}
{"text":"This place is great. It doesn't look like much from the outside (or inside) but the food quality and taste is great! Try the pan fried dumplings, they are soooo good."}
{"text":"Some of the best Chinese food around and the prices are also very good. I've been going to this place for 8 years and love it.  I always have Mongolian chicken and brown rice.  The staff are all very nice.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"We love coming here. Hole in the wall feel, but the prices are reasonable and the food is very good. They make little improvements to the decor as they can. The place is clean and the staff are very friendly. I can't find anything not to like."}
{"text":"First time here, we came on a Sunday night. There was a small but steady flow of guests during our stay. The service was prompt and efficient.   Now let's talk about the food...AMAZING!! Crab rangoons were standard, but the Kung Pao vegetables and egg fried rice were right on point. Everything hit the spot for a reasonable price and what seemed to be reasonably healthy; no excess grease or sodium, just great-tasting Chinese food. Definitely coming back soon!"}
{"text":"Amazing service and value wins every time in my book. Food is always solid as well. $3.05 for my chicken chow mein, fried rice, and an egg roll. That's what I'm talking about. The menu hasnt changed in 30 years. Lets keep that a secret"}
{"text":"This is our first time here. We were seated promptly. We started with the sizzling rice soup. It was delicious, a must try if you have never had it. Our food came quickly. Everything we had was delicious. Great place."}
{"text":"First off, realize this is not a pricey or dressy-type place, it is a casual, neighborhood restaurant! I've been dining here since 1991 and this place has CONSISTENTLY provided quality meals and great service. If you can count, that's about 22 years of good eats and affordable dine-out on a budget. The meals are authentic, no China Panda s***t here, no 'fusion' BS, either.  The chrysanthemum tea is excellent, and I recommend their bar if you're looking for a decent drink at a modest price. The layout hasn't changed since 1991, and I have reason to believe they haven't updated much of the furniture, but I go there to eat, not to gawk, so I'm good. I recommend this place to any foodie looking for a more exotic, yet authentic meal. Their lunch specials rock, unless you can do better elsewhere for six bucks!"}
{"text":"We love this place! We live super close so we walk there all the time to get our Chinese fix. The staff is always super nice and friendly - telling jokes and being playful with kids at nearby tables. They always give complimentary tea and so far, desserts (small ice cream or macaroons) at our meals. When we read reviews prior to our first visit, we couldn't believe people thought that heavy Chinese accents at a Chinese restaurant was a con.... either way, the English is decent enough that this Midwesterner has no problem understanding. Highly encourage that you give this place a try!"}
{"text":"Alley pup can't wait to return and have Peking duck Tuesday with a meat eating pal of hers.  The food here is excellent with portions and a price that can't be beat.  Steven A. reviewed this place accurately...the staff is the most jovial I have ever encountered .  Our waiter was the best.  He joked throughout our entire service and he jokes were actually funny.  He told me I had no fun because unlike my dining partner, I had no ordered chow fung.  He reminded me to next time order tofu fung so I could have some fun in my life too.  He was attentive and ensured the order was properly executed.   My vegetarian eggplant lunch special was great and came with soup, 2 egg rolls, white rice and hot tea.  The inside looked like an 80s movie but was clean and well kept.  The chow fung was cooked excellently and smelled amazimg.  There are so many reasons to come here for their lunch special...so come check it out!"}
{"text":"?????. ?????????! ???????????????????. ?????????."}
{"text":"Another fine dinner at China Village.  I ordered Ma-Po bean curd for dinner.  I had enough to share with my dinner mate.  The service was excellent as usual.  The hostess was very concerned that my group enjoyed their dinner."}
{"text":"Awesome food all the time.  They're fast and the friendliest most attentive family business in East Phoenix.  House Special Fried Rice is the best.  Pot Stickers so delicious.   No wonder they've been in business for 30+ years.  Genuine and authentic in a City that's loaded with mediocre Fox restaurants and national chains.  Love old school Family businesses."}
{"text":"Nice Little Find   Found this location based on fellow \"yelpers\" recommendation for egg drop soup and the yelpers were right, of course,  this egg drop soup could be the best in town. China Village has great lunch prices.   Seating is always  prompt, service quick and the staff is very personable.  The food is good,the portions are big and the service is awesome. Food is always hot and ready fast.  If you go a couple times,they remember you.  Really good place for a quick bite."}
{"text":"When we walked into the restaurant, my hopes for delicious food were elevated because the scent of delicious Chinese food filled the air!   We sat down, we were served some tea, and not too long after, a sweet woman came by to take our order.   My heart was set on orange chicken, which was not on the menu. I decided to ask anyway, and she happily responded \"we'll make it...just for you!\"   I really really really wanted to like the food here, but I didn't. To be fair, I am partial to another Valley restaurant to satiate my Chinese food cravings.   The food lacked flavor and didn't have that \"authentic\" feel to it. I mean, I've never been to China personally, but I'd imagine there would be more flavor involved in the dishes.   The only reason I rated this place so high is because of the service. Everyone that we interacted with was just so nice and funny. One of the gentlemen there made some jokes, wished us a merry Christmas, and gave us candy canes. Super sweet! Good customer service is very important to me and will make or break a place for me.   Bottom line - you know that sweet auntie or cousin you have that loves to entertain and cook dinners for you, but you don't have the heart to tell them you don't like their cooking? That's what this place reminds me of."}
{"text":"Love this place. What can I say and it is not because of the fact that I can walk to it. Now granted the only reason this place doesn't get 5 stars is because of the fact that it desperately needs a remodel.   The food is excellent and the service is seriously so good, you almost want to tuck one of your little Asian servers in your pocket and take them home with you and make them an indentured servant of some sort or slave.  But on a serious note, this is one of those hidden little gems you almost don't want to yelp about due to the fact that you don't want a ton of people to find about it and ruin it."}
{"text":"We just stumbled into this place on a trip to Phoenix last weekend.  Maybe it's a matter of taste in view of the other review on this page,  but we thought this place serves GREAT Chinese, with excellent attentive service and excellent prices, (although I'm used to LA prices and Phoenix is generally more economical across the board.)  We opted for  the fixed menu dinner, which we usually do not do, and the selections were very good.  The moo-shu pork was my favorite, although the rest of the dishes were also outstanding. There is a wonderful garlic chicken dish.  They put a little hibachi on the table so we could cook our own little skewers of beef.  We liked the very hearty soup. I did not notice any of the downside aspects noted in the other review.  The outside is not much to look at, just a rather plain free-standing building, but the interior decor is right out of the 50's, like the old style Cantonese places back then.  They play quiet Chinese music in the background, a nice touch that enhances the experience.  Plenty of parking and a bar if you like that sort of thing.  Thanks for a great evening, China Village !  UDATE:  Dropped in again a few months later- just to see if the quality stayed up- and it was as good as before.  They even recognized us from months earlier.  We had the fixed menu dinner for six and they were very cooperative in making some changes based on our tastes.  Thanks again..  China Village."}
{"text":"There is not really good Chinese food in Arcadia, but this place is good. I've been here a few times. It's been consistent and does not disappoint."}
{"text":"This place is a classic Chinese restaurant that caters mainly to non-Chinese people. In fact a quick survey of the dining room as I sit in the foyer waiting for my take out order reveals only one Asian person out of about 25 and he looks more Mongolian than Chinese.  The food here is good. I have eaten here a few times and have always been pleased. The place is really old and kinda worn out inside, which I think is part of the charm.  They offer a fairly varied menu but when you choose to eat at a place like this it's for the standard fare: fried rice, noodles, chow mien, wanton soup, egg rolls etc. China Village serves it up hot and tasty! One of the other things I love about this place is that all the front of house staff are older Chinese ladies who seem to do as much vibrant chatting in their native language as they do speaking to the clientele. They are fast, efficient and friendly and if you order a large soup they will dish it out for you and your guests. Really good service.  I wouldn't want to look too closely in the nooks and crannies of this place as it needed remodeling about 20 years ago, but as I erstwhile stated, for myself the grungesqueness is part of the appeal somehow but you'd not catch me eating errant rice grains off the table.  Eat in or take out I have always enjoyed their  food and am a repeat customer!  China Village: it's about the food not the decor. Though the place is lit up outside like a Christmas festival! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"We ordered Mongolian Beef, Kung Pao Chicken and Sam's Special. The Sam's Special was stir-fried mixed vegetables. It tasted good. The dishes were all American Chinese style."}
{"text":"This place has the yummiest food & great prices! Everything is hot, fresh & flavorful.  Wether for lunch or dinner you will be happy.   Recommend: Chop Suey & Eggplant.  The staff are attentive, super friendly & have a great sense of humor! This is my new regular spot."}
{"text":"Generous portions and good price! The food is delicious! I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Dated decore but the food was delicious. We tried the beef with broccoli, the house chow mein and won ton soup and it was delicious. Ended up here because China Chili changed their Sunday hours and we were not disappointed. This is our new spot!"}
{"text":"I went to this place cause I was just looking for something good to eat because my favorite pho spot was closed. The hostess is really nice, and the servers seem really nice and funny also. I like my food very spicy, so I ordered their general chicken as spicy as they could make it. The waiter asked \"how spicy 1-10, or do you want 12...?\" semi jokingly. I got the 12, he was calling it Presidents dad's chicken, (I guess they call the 10 presidents chicken). This stuff was SOOO spicy, exactly what I wanted/needed. They kept refilling my water because they knew it was going to be drained quickly. Definitely recommend this spot for anyone that really enjoys spicy food."}
{"text":"SO good! One day I just had a serious craving for Chinese food (let's be honest I have a craving most days). I came in here for a solo lunch and quickly grabbed a seat. I ordered the dinner pork lo mein and after a sassy comment from the server regarding my portion size it was just a few minutes until it came out. It was as fabulously greasy and tasty as I was hoping for. Getting in and out in 45 minutes for under $13 was pretty great and I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"By far the most excellent Chinese restaurant in town!!! Totally exceeded my expectations!! I ordered the BBQ ribs as my appetizer and spicy shredded pork (comes with rice) as the main dish. I had the ribs first with a side of white rice (which is free since my main dish comes with it). You get four ribs evenly cut and well prepared. It was very moist, juicy, with a tinge of sweetness and very delicious! Then came the main dish, the shredded pork (spicy) with a side of rice. I was not prepared how exciting this dish was and I am very glad I ordered it! All-in-all, I am definitely coming back to this place! They have totally won me over!"}
{"text":"Oh how I miss the days when China Village was good. Don't even bother going here now. The meat is hard to chew threw, the fryer way too hot, and every dish uses the same bland brown sauce. The orange chicken was the dish I always got, but the poor thing as been reduce to a plate of grizzly, overly deep fried, dog meat with some orange sauce on top. Trust me. Don't waste your money here. I'm actually surprised they are still open!"}
{"text":"This place has NO MENU to view online. (unless you download some crap??)  This place does NOT deliver during normal meal times. I called at 5:45 pm on a Wednesday and they said NO DELIVERY.  WTF? This is just one of the reasons to never live in this Red State, NO DECENT CHINESE FOOD DELIVERY. The first being Judge Arpaio.  Good night and Good luck."}
{"text":"A great sit down restaurant where the food is delicious, the staff is nice and the prices are awesome.  It's the type of place that serves delicious, neighborhood style food. The flavors are wonderful. It's one of those places that start you off with hot tea, which I love! The lunch specials are super cheap. You can probably eat here for less that some place like Panda Express and you'll get better food!  The other things about Chinese restaurants in the decor. Usually it is 80s-esque decor with a pastel palette, luckily this place isn't like that. Hey, it's still not New York Chic, but it's not a disaster either."}
{"text":"We were visiting from Los Angeles and craving some authentic Chinese food and the China Village did not disappoint us. The food was delicious!  Highlights: - The roast duck was succulent, the skin was light and crispy and the meat very tender.  - Lychee martinis were a blast. - Food service was quick and staff was friendly"}
{"text":"I was able to celebrate my dad's birthday by taking him to his favorite Chinese restaurant in town since me moved here from New York City . This was a dad and son affair ! Telling you the lunch menu is on point with reasonable pricing. I had the Mongolian beef plate that included a cup of soup , egg roll, fried rice and a fortune cookie. The hot tea was savoring that balanced the meal! Thank you for taking care of us and making my dad's day special!"}
{"text":"I'm thoroughly disappointed...All the food we got was basically deep fried accept for the soup that came with my meal. I personally thought it was overpriced as well. The atmosphere is quiet & the chef came and talked with us to make jokes which is why I gave them 2 stars. If it weren't for him it'd be a solid 1 star.. Sorry, I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Ambient - Casual dining.  Inside Retro 70s. dim lighting.  Service - Its okay.  The only fall back is that the servers only speak a little bit of english, and at times well what you get is what you get. I guess in part it adds to the authenticity of the chinese food. :-)  Food - its good.  I've had their lemon chicken, orange chicken, kung pao shrimp.  all of them pretty tasty.  I enjoy their hot tea, although if you are going to drink something else you have to let them now, because sometimes they only bring the hot tea and that is it."}
{"text":"Been around since 85' and still leading the game in Chinese. A little pricey but very consistent time after time, very established spot in the heart of Phoenix. My number 1 Chinese food rec!"}
{"text":"We drove very far (per recommendation of our fellow YELPERS)    The people are very nice The people took our order quickly The food came out quickly However it WAS AVERAGE-PAR Chinese food.  I'm pretty sure we passed about 10 Chinese places on the way here that would've done the trick..  We are full & we are satisfied.  Family of four ate for $32 bucks..(I had water to drink)   We won't be going out of our way again:)"}
{"text":"The people and service was very good. The food was not. In my own opinion, it was very bland. I ordered the house specialty chicken. I'm not sure if this is possibly considered 'real chinese' if it is, that may be why it's not my cup of tea. I honestly took two bites, boxed it up, went to a place I like, and fed the food from here to my dogs."}
{"text":"First impression: old and outdated. Dark gloomy inside. Appears dirty due to the old furniture.  The AC is blasting so a bit too cold when you hit shirts at shirt on. Price seams a bit high for the environment....now the food: Wor Wonton soup very good. The kung pao chicken, walnut shrimp , house fried rice, Mongolian beef, and chop soy were ok and some disappointment. small portions for the price.  The owners are friendly."}
{"text":"The employees working here are the sweetest Chinese restaurant employees I've ever came across! I've been going to Chinese restaurants since I can start eating, and I've always known service at Chinese restaurants to lack severely! This place is outside of this norm! Me and my sidekick was hungry and I pulled out my yelp app and saw this place at four stars. I've been craving fried rice so why not?  When we walked in, the hostess greeted us. Our waitress was an older lady that reminded me of my late grandma and she was so sweet. We ordered the Kung Pao chicken and house special fried rice. For drinks, they had happy hour beers for $2.75 and Mai Tais were $5 so I got that. That Mai Tai was strong, but good.  Another employee came by and asked us if we liked the food. It was fresh and delicious! The fried rice was amazing and it fulfilled my rice craving! When we were done, they gave us fresh, warm macaroons along with a fortune cookie. The macaroons were so damn good and something I've never been given at a Chinese restaurant so it was a nice surprise.  I was highly impressed for not just the food but the spectacular customer service! They made us feel so welcome there and I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Walked in and ordered takeout, service was very speedy and they used a recycled box for me to carry out the order which was great!   Unfortunately I was not as fond of the food, the egg fried rice was good but the house special chicken was really fatty and I was not able to eat it. The orange chicken was a little better but still not the quality I was looking for.   Probably won't return."}
{"text":"I went there 10-19-15 for a late lunch with a friend, upon entering the front door I saw a dead roach in the door entrance, looks like they never swept anyway. Place is VERY dark.  We were seated right away and was brought water and the waitress already had her pad asking what we wanted to eat, we didn't even have a chance to look at the menu yet, I told her not yet and asked for a straw for my water, she came right back with it and asked if we were ready yet. I said no to give us a few minutes. They had two lunch menu's on the table in the plastic holders, was confused as to why that was. We ordered from their lunch menu they gave us, and was brought out soup right away, was warm not hot. I was not happy with what I ordered, the house chicken which is to be coated and crispy with a gravy, it was a little too crispy, tasted old like maybe they reheated it and hardly any gravy, dry for the most part. My friend had some kind of beef with veges and she said it was watered down, the beef looked like it was paper thin like from a deli. NOT GOOD at all, we were rushed the whole time we were there. Also another two ladies came in and one ordered what was the special noted on their menu board when you walked in, the waitress said there was not that for a special, that lady had to get up to show her!!!! really. I was not happy with this place at all and would never go back there."}
{"text":"The service was great and the food was delicious! I enjoyed the sweet and sour chicken dinner meal."}
{"text":"Exceeded expectations. Spicy human beef, chow fun, and egg rolls were great. Chow neon was a little bland but still good."}
{"text":"This place is funky old school Chinese place.  I am so shocked how many times I have driven by or gone next door to smart and final and never realized this place was here!   We came here for an early Sunday dinner so the restaurant was empty.  I felt like I stepped back into a late 70's restaurant and I loved it!!  All the staff were friendly and welcoming and they instantly got us water and hot green tea.  We started with the Hot and Sour Soup and Crab Puffs.  The H&S was good but a little more on the sour side.  Its a bold flavor.  My boyfriend wasn't a big fan but I liked it - a little different. But the crab puffs, now these were fluffy fried pieces of crab and cream cheese heaven!! Ordered the small and wish we got the large.  Entrees: I got the Chicken with veggies (spicy) and he had the hong kong chicken.  The Hong Kong chicken wasn't on the menu but we saw it on Yelp and asked if they could make it.  It was like a cross of sweet and sour meets orange chicken with onions.  Over rice it was really good!  Menu has a tone of options and they even have good meal combos"}
{"text":"Definitely a Chinese gem in the South Hills!  Family owned and operated.  It's a husband (chef) and wife (waitress) team that owns/runs the place and my family and I have been coming here for years.    The food has always been good and fresh.  I always get a bowl of their rice soup and it always hits the spot.  I know that's it's probably a very simple dish to make, but that's definitely my go-to appetizer at this place.  Also the egg roll isn't greasy but always crispy and fresh so I highly recommend.  We usually order the chicken with garlic sauce and a beef dish and haven't been disappointed.  When it gets crowded, service can be slower but be patient since it's only the husband and wife team that are holding down the fort.    I feel like it's one of those places that people go to for years and get to know the owners and the owners get to know you, so definitely worth 5 stars in my opinion."}
{"text":"Best place to get Chinese food in the area. My family always comes here after big events, and always enjoy it. House loMein is out of this world, Mushu Pork is dank, and all come with sides of hot tea and steamed white rice. A+"}
{"text":"Decided to try this place out ended up being a huge mistake! Thanks to food poisoning I was sick for two days unable to go to work. Thanks China Village! Seriously though eat here at your own risk I was suckered in by the other good reviews as well."}
{"text":"We have eaten at china village and had their takeout for 15 years.  Love it. Mu shu is fun to eat in. Kung pao is good too. We can eat in with wheelchair access no problem. The bar is not in use, but I wish it was.  It is tiki room cute.  Very vintage look.  Mai tais are cool."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time last night and it was probably the best Chinese food I have had  since moving to Phoenix!!  The service was outstanding, the food excellent and hot when it was brought out.  My grandson said he wanted to give it 100 stars!!"}
{"text":"This place shouldn't have 4 stars. Expensive for the food quality and amount you get. The staff were very kind and friendly. Maybe if the food was a bit cheaper. Or maybe a lunch spot."}
{"text":"Had dinner here last night from looking at the yelped reviews and we are soooo glad we did! The leeche martini was yummy!  Ordered war wanton soup, egg rolls, sizzling seafood platter.... Service was great and everyone Sooo nice!!! Next time we come to Arizona we will have dinner here!!:)"}
{"text":"This place is delicious.   The food is great and so is the service. The lunch special is a really good deal as well. I would recommend the Kung Pa chicken.  It comes out piping hot.  The location id great near Biltmore."}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite Chinese place I've been to in Phoenix. I've gone through soooo many bad Chinese places in the Valley per recommendations from people who obviously have no idea what good Chinese food tastes like.  I had pretty much given up. I was beyond happy to find this place. The service is fantastic. The staff is sweet, friendly, and often humorous. We've celebrated a birthday here and the staff was kind and accommodating. The food is delicious. The egg drop soup and lo mein are my favorites, but I enjoy everything I eat here honestly.  The prices are great and the food is fresh and they have happily provided adjustments to our orders if we didn't want certain ingredients.  It's not \"traditional\" it's definitely Americanized food, but it's a complete delight."}
{"text":"Trust these good reviews, my fellow yelpers and yelpees.  China Village is an excellent restaurant.  I rarely give a restaurant 5 stars based on a single visit, but everything about my visit was fantabulous.  From the moment I walked in until the moment I walked out, they made me feel like a valued customer.  The service was PHENOMINAL.  The waiters and waitresses here CARE about you, and they are very social and entertaining as well.    On to the food!  My waiter gave me several samples throughout my meal.  The first one was the special of the day, which I did like but did not order.  It was mongolian lamb, and if I wasn't totally in the mood for something else, I definitely would have given it a shot.  The other sample he gave me later on was peking duck wrapped in a mooshoo pancake.  I'm not usually a big fan of duck and, honestly, I had no idea what it was until he told me.  But when I took a bite out of it, it was like biting into heaven!  I think I might have to start eating duck now!!  What I actually ordered was a bowl of the Wor Wonton soup, an egg roll and hunan chicken.  Let's start with the Wor Wonton soup.  When I saw the price on the menu I was a bit surprised.  It's over $5.00 for a small order of soup and $1.00 more for the large.  I wonder why they do this?  The soup is supposed to be an appetizer, not a MEAL... and that's essentially what it was.   The small soup was in a LARGE transparent bowl.  Transparent so that you could see all the good meat and vegetables they throw in there.  I'm glad it was, too, because I saw shrimp in there and I don't like shrimp.. he had no problem taking it back to remove the shrimp.  When he returned, and I tried this soup, I almost soupgasmed right there.  There's only one other place where I've ever had wonton soup this good.  The flavor of the broth was just absolutely AMAZING and the wontons were the perfect texture. On top of that there was plenty of cabbage and other roast pork floating around in there, carrots, scallions, the works.  I had to force myself to stop eating it so that I would have room for the rest of my meal.  The egg roll was average.  It was definitely nice and crispy, but it was thin and it almost like eating just fried batter.  I can't really reduce my review because of one egg roll though.  The hunan chicken was perfect.  The sauce was deliciously spicy and the whole dish was tasty.    The only thing I DIDNT like about it, was the amount of those bamboo shoots they put in it.  I would much rather have something crunchier like bok choy and/or water chestnuts but there were none in there.  I suppose I could have asked him to make it with them, but I'm not the type of person to ask for substitutes.  Overall my experience there was excellent.  I was totally happy and satisfied when I left.  The decor is not bad.  It's not the Taj Mahal.  It just a local Chinese restaurant."}
{"text":"I have tried Chinese places of this caliber all over the city over the course of years. This is one of the better experiences I've had. The food doesn't differ too much from place to place. What separates China Village from most of the other places I've had is that you can tell that it is their goal to cook with love, for lack of a better term. We got crab wontons, won ton soup, shrimp & chicken with garlic sauce, and general tsos chicken. Everything we had was a notch above most other Chinese takeout places. It just had that extra touch of caring. They're not reinventing the wheel, they're just doing a very good job at what they do. We even got glasses of water brought to us unprovoked in the lobby when we were waiting for our takeout. Will go back for sure."}
{"text":"Delicious. Friendly. Delicious. I love good Chinese food and detest the bad - we'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I should have written this Review years ago, just never thought of it. I have been going to \"China Village\" since 1985 my family calls it \"Ben's\" because Ben was the first \"Honcho\" when it opened it used to be a Japanese Bar and Restaurant in the old days. \"China Village\" has the basics down and it always has, they have had the same Cook for years so everything is consistent and they train the new cooks well every now and then I can tell a different Cook is behind the scenes but not very often. Over the years I have probably tried everything on the menu I loved it all so be \"Bold\" try it If I were to name my favorites I would have to say nothing fancy the \"Hot and Sour Soup\", \"House Special Fried Rice\", \"Yu Shan Chicken\", \"Moo-Shu Pork\" extra Hoisin sauce,, \"Spicy Chicken and Shrimp\",  \"House Special Chicken with \"Shrimp\" extra cost \" and my all time favorite \"Steamed Whole Fish\" try everything these are just mine.  Thank You \"China Village\" \"Bens\",  Jerry"}
{"text":"China Village has been around for years (at least 28 years that I know of). It's nothing fancy and is a true family business that serves great food.   You are always waited on by one of the owners and the service is always good. The restaurant isn't too big. Although they can get busy, I don't ever remember having to wait to be seated.   The wonton soup is absolutely delicious. My personal favorite dish here is the shrimp with lobster sauce. I enjoy it so much I hardly ever get anything else. This is unfortunate because they have a really great menu.  The only thing that bugs me about China Village is that they only accept cash. This has caused me to go someplace else several times. Other than that, I think China Village is a great place to visit."}
{"text":"We just moved back to the Valley of the sun and  we ate here tonight again and the food is very good and tasty!!  Very authentic Chinese food!! Friendly staff and the service is always great!! We've eaten at other places here in Phoenix but by far this is one of the better ones for great Chinese food!!"}
{"text":"Definitely the friendliest staff! Even on Christmas Day when every table was filled and the take out area was hopping.   Food was tasty and served very quickly."}
{"text":"I can only speak for the take-out service, since I haven't dined in (yet.) Friendly and easy to understand on the phone, food was ready very fast and came out HOT! I appreciated that they serve up the take out orders in a box as opposed to a bag. Why haven't more places thought of this?  I had the vegetable moo shu and it was fantastic. The vegetables weren't oily, just well seasoned and cooked perfectly.   My boyfriend had the general tso chicken and said it was maybe the best he's ever had. It wasn't overly breaded like many are and, I quote, \"You can tell there's actually chicken in there.\"   Apparently they have a good happy hour which I plan to check out. $5 scorpion bowls? I'm in."}
{"text":"Coming to China Village is like coming home, overall we love this place. New specials offered with their twist on happy hour as well. Moo shu vegetable outstanding and professionally wrapped I might say. Orange Beef crisp,not dry with a flavorful sauce. Staff that is friendly with a sense of humor. All this makes a delightful eating out experience. And thank you for the birthday treats."}
{"text":"Love this place. I've been coming here since the womb. You can't go wrong with ordering anything off the menu but my top favorites are sizzling rice soup, general chicken & mu shu pork."}
{"text":"Good Chinese food, great value -- especially for lunch.  China Village is one of my regular haunts for Chinese food when I'm in the neighborhood.  The building may look run-down, but the food and service are good."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times and really like it! The staff is friendly and the restaurant is clean. The food is really tasty too. I've tried the egg flower soup, egg rolls, the dumplings, the Hawaiian chicken, a beef dish (cannot remember which one at the moment) and the house special chicken. Everything except the house special chicken was excellent. I have to sadly say that the last on the above list was not good at all. It was chicken fried in a batter with no seasoning and the sauce was a salty brown mess and there were no vegetables that came with it. I really didn't care for it at all. Despite the bad chicken dish I would still love to come back and try other dishes they offer."}
{"text":"I benchmark any Chinese by my favorite...  Kung Pao.   Unfortunately,  they missed the mark,  badly.  Here's the highlights... a ton of sautéed and soggy onions,  very soggy green onions and a very bland,  generic sauce.  The peanuts might have been pan fried,  there wasn't enough to tell.    The chicken was equally lacking.   I asked for extra spicy,  and received a couple of dried peppers,  which unless actually prepared with the dish,  doesn't impart any heat,  unless you try chewing on one of those insanely tough beasts.   The vegetable eggroll was the size of my thumb,  and the filling complete mush.  The wonton was way overcooked which made the filling into a small rock of indestructible material. Fail,  fail and fail.   The rice had the appropriate amount of stickiness... So there was one positive note."}
{"text":"My all-time favorite Chinese place in Phoenix. Been here over 20 times and never had a bad experience. The food is always spot on. The staff is friendly. Just a great place to go for lunch/dinner or even to go. Get the Schezuan Eggplant my favorite. I am a vegetarian so I get it without pork, which they have no problem modifying. Unlike Autumn Court down the street that threw a fit when I wanted no pork, something about it being a chef special! LOL. They also have AWESOME mai tais."}
{"text":"Ok First time here today, Food was awesome staff was way cool and the lady that processed my credit card was hilarious lil old lady haha this is definitely the closest to NY - NJ Chinese i have had in a while im definitely going back to this place when i want food on the go Thanks China Village"}
{"text":"Great Chinese place.   Took our order quick,  came out quick,  was presented nicely and tasted amazing!   One small thing that I didn't enjoy is the hour after I was done eating I could feel my heart racing from the saltiness of the food.   I guess you have to expect that from most Chinese places but if I find one that isn't salty and tastes like this place,  it will be a 5 all day!"}
{"text":"This was a big disappointment, especially since this got a good review in the Arizona Republic. Can't quite figure that one out.   I like \"old time\" Chinese food...but this really missed the mark big time. I love egg foo yung and order it in two of our favorite Chinese restaurants...this was like a wet sponge, with the consistency of oatmeal.  Never had anything like this before.  The restaurant is in need of a makeover and is very outdated.  I can see keeping the charm of an older restaurant...but this really needs a facelift. The employees were very nice and helpful...but there is definitely a breakdown in the language barrier.  There are definitely better choices if you like old time traditional Chinese fare."}
{"text":"China Village, I would like to award you 5 stars. My boyfriend and I are in love with you. Absolutely our go-to Chinese restaurant.   Why do I love it so much? Well...   The service is fantastic. Especially this one gentlemen that works there, that always seems to be wearing a bow-tie. He is friendly and funny, and I get excited whenever we are seated in his section. With that said, I don't want to take away from the other people that work there, because they are all awesome too. I am yet to have a sub-par experience with the staff.  They start you off with complimentary hot tea and water. It's good tea too. It's unsweetened, but if you are like my boyfriend and need it sweet, there is sugar available of course. However, I like it as is.  The food itself is wonderful. The first time I went, I had a spicy shrimp dish, served with steamed white rice. It had the perfect amount of kick, and there was just enough to fill me up and and then some to take home to enjoy later. My personal favorite dish though is the beef and broccoli. Definitely a classic, but the broccoli is always the perfect texture, and the sauce is so rich and the beef is always great  for this dish. Usually we get the dinner combination that comes with a bowl of soup (also good), a crab puff, a chicken wing, and an egg roll. I usually trade my boyfriend the eggroll for the chicken wing, because they are each of our favorites.   This place is great for a weeknight dinner out..... Well, really any dinner out, I'm gonna be honest. Or lunch for that matter. Actually, whenever you want to eat out, just go here :)"}
{"text":"We love having dinner here. Food is always excellent, place is always neat, and staff are extremely friendly."}
{"text":"5 stars for customer service. This is our go-to place for Chinese take-out after having tried a bunch of places in our area. The food is consistent, standard Chinese-American, always hot, with fresh veggies.   Tonight, though, I was prompted to write a review. I am vegetarian and my husband is a little picky, and as such I made asked for some substitutions to our order. I ordered Mooshoo vegetable with no egg (my preferece) and veggie fried rice with added tofu and no mushrooms (hubbie's preference after finding a rogue mushroom last time). Also ordered a few other items.  5 minutes later, China Village called back to double-check that I also didn't want egg in the fried rice since I had asked for it in the mooshoo. I thanked him for asking, and no, we did not want any egg in the rice.   I went to pick up the order, and the sweet little lady at the counter told me that that also made sure to take the mushrooms out of our soup, since she was worried that we couldn't eat mushrooms and didn't want us to worry about finding them.   They did not have to pay such close attention to details, and I wouldn't have complained if none of these things had occurred. But because they went the extra mile, my appreciation was far greater than my dissatisfaction would have been.   Support this place and show them that customer service still means something!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came to eat here a few months ago (sit down) and he loved it! I thought it was good but he was way more into than I was. We ordered egg drop soup, sweet & sour chicken, & the lemon chicken. The chicken was yummy and crispy! Nothing to complain about. The rice was just plain rice, nothing to complain about. Service was super friendly. They have cute little cups of tea as well, which I enjoyed.    Fast forward to last week, we ordered take out and I swear it was like a completely different experience. I ordered orange chicken & my boyfriend ordered the house special chicken. The chicken was reallly dry. The breading was literally falling off in chunks and they barely gave us any rice. We also ordered the egg drop soup again, and it was amazing. But the chicken was just so bad that we ended up not eating all of it.   Overall, I'd STRONGLY suggest to not get take out and definitely dine in!!"}
{"text":"This place has excellent service- staff was wonderful and welcoming. Food was pretty average american-style chinese food. The sweet & sour sauce was pretty sweet for our taste, but we really enjoyed the fried rice. Overall it was a decent place and we'd visit and try more dishes, but probably wouldn't go too far out of our way to go here."}
{"text":"I hate to go against the crowd but our meals were poor to fair. I had sizzling beef which was ok. My wife had an eggplant dish which was very unappetizing looking. She only ate a little.  It was Christmas day, so maybe they had a poor chef or two in the kitchen.  The service was very slow both the server and the food coming out of the kitchen. We won't go back.  Addition: In checking out the review data I saw that the positive reviews have gone down over the years. Not a ton, but a noticeable trend and enough to make a judgement."}
{"text":"Note #1: China Village is strictly CASH ONLY.   Note #2: They are located within the same shopping center as Signature Desserts and Trolley Barn Eatery and are across the road from Gil-Con Tool Co.  Note #3: During the week, they are closed for 2 hours between lunch and dinner (2:30PM-4:30PM).   The \"cash only\" policy deterred Kay and I a duo of weeks ago from dining in here. Considering that I'm off from work, I figured it was high time for some takeout.   For what it's worth, China Village specializes in Cantonese cuisine, so I tried a couple of their \"Cantonese Delicacies\" in the Har Lung Wu and the Har-Sue Ding.   The Har Lung Wu is simply shrimp in a lobster sauce and measured up favorably to Lobster Cantonese, that rarity of Chinese dishes. The shrimp in this dish (and in the other dish I ordered, which I'll discuss later in the review), was plump and perfectly prepared. The sauce itself has a welcome egg flavor and somewhat gelatinous texture.   The Har-Sue Ding is made up of pork cubes with bamboo shoots and a medley of other vegetables. I found it to a step above acceptable. My only problem was that the pork didn't seem to absorb the flavors as well as the vegetables did. Other than that it was just fine and not much more than that.   The Shrimp With Lobster Sauce on Rice was what I ordered for Dear Old Dad (he's still MIA as I write this. Huuurmmm...), and was surprisingly sweet and candied of shrimp and vegetable. My mother liked this dish best. I enjoyed it also despite being a tad confused by it.  Also on tap were some mighty fine, crisp, and steamy egg rolls, and an order of a rather rich, caliginous order of beef fried rice, both of which were awfully edible.   So you've got another Chinese takeout option in the South Hills, Yelpers. I just can't believe that it took me this long to get over there. Don't take as long as I did.  P.S. A sole Lilliputian television is provided in the dining room for your entertainment. Hey, it's somethin'."}
{"text":"This week the Jolly Diners went to China Village. We started out with vegetable egg rolls and crab rangoons. The main courses were egg foo yung for my sister, sweet and sour chicken for my mother, vegetable chow mein for my brother-in-law, and vegetable chow mein for me; with the addition of tofu. Everything was prepared and served expertly. The wait staff served us China black tea and beverages right away. They offered help on the specials and they were great throughout the meal. I didn't know what chow-fung noodles were and so they brought me a small dish of chow-fung noodles to try. Both the service and the food were delicious and reasonably priced. If you have a family, you're on a date, or you just want a really good Chinese meal - then try China Village. It's very obvious this team of professionals had been doing this for some time.  The Jolly Diners rated China Village at an overall 5 out of 5. Hope you enjoy it the same way we did."}
{"text":"Before I mention the food, service or decor I'd recommend coming for lunch instead of dinner. Lunch specials are around $6.95 & dinner is about $12.50. Granted the dinner portions are likely to be larger. From the outside of the restaurant it doesn't look like much. Inside awaits a friendly and professional staff, with a dimly lit atmosphere. I ordered the general chicken, lightly fried, very tasty. The egg drop soup is average. Ice water and hot herbal tea are a nice touch. The food doesn't seem \"healthy,\" everything seems either fried or sauced, but is a nice treat every now and then. I would return during lunch."}
{"text":"Finally, after 3 years in Phoenix we find great Chinese food. I had the Peking Duck which was excellent. My wife had the spicy shrimp dish and my kids the orange chicken- all very good. Love that they start you off with hot tea. The service is super friendly and my kids had a great time. Inside is totally old school so if you are looking for new and trendy, this isn't it. Prices are super low too and you will not go away hungry. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Sitting here now still waiting for our bill after another 2 hour unmitigated Christmas disaster of extremely poor service and a disorganized mess. I'm typing this review at the end of a 2 hour dinner that felt like a 7 day cruise.   Yes we know Christmas here is mushuganah. But we arrived an hour after opening (early) and ordered Peking duck and 2 other dishes and some potstickers. Nothing too crazy mind you.   So we arrived at 4:30.   Since then we've been here impatiently tapping our fingers. Potstickers took 75 minutes to arrive - after I complained to the harried waitstaff (you could tell they were harried as I could hear them yelling in Chinese from the kitchen at each other throughout the night).   After 60 minutes the waitress came out and said they had inexplicably run out of duck. The ole 86 - just 2 hours after opening on Christmas Day. Go figure. Ok we sighed...we'll get mushu chicken instead.   Then we waited. And waited. And waited.   We've had their potstickers here before and they were usually pretty good - but these tasted half cooked and doughy.   About 1:45 minutes after ordering two dishes arrived - not the three ordered. Oops forgot the mushu chicken.   What drove us truly nuts was watching many tables get served while we twiddled our fingers. Quite a few arrived 30-40 minutes after our arrival yet somehow they were served 1st. That led us to think the issue was more our disorganized and inattentive waitress than the admittedly busy kitchen.   Food tasted fine - not as good as past years.  Bottom line is that this will our last and final visit to China Village. They just can't seem to get it together. We didn't leave a tip - took another 25 minutes after eating to clear the table and get the tab."}
{"text":"We used to live close to China Village and would frequent it several times a month. Now, we try to make it in anytime we are on that side of town. I made a special trip today and it was worth it.   If you're ever feeling under the weather, the soup here works miracles. Specifically : wor wonton soup, Hong Kong style. Just add half a bottle of sriracha and you'll be good to go.   On top of the delicious menu, the service here is fantastic. I would go so far as to say I adore it. I haven't been here in several weeks, yet he not only remembered me, but the exact soup that I ordered. Fantastic.   I haven't been in with a group; it's just the two of us that dine here. Our drinks, food, and check always arrive in a timely fashion."}
{"text":"First time coming here ordered several dishes to try including egg rolls egg foo young House special fried rice. Everything was really good fresh. The one thing that I can say that made our visit stand out is the service. They really appreciate your business they're very courteous and kind. Nowadays that's hard to come by. When you have a good experience you return. Try them out next time you're in the area."}
{"text":"I can't believe I've never reviewed China Village on here. My family and I have been coming to China Village for the past 23 years - they've had locations further north and we found this one a few years ago. The food is authentic, people are good and it's all around a great experience. It's a real charm and one of Phoenix's best."}
{"text":"Very Dericious  I had Kung pow shrimp and scallops  Mongolian beef and chicken chop sue oh and egg rolls I finally found an old school Chinese restaurant that even has hot tea service  Even the plain white rice was amazing"}
{"text":"It was our first time here and this review is for their lunch special.  It was alright- I think Panda Express is better tasting than their LUNCH SPECIAL."}
{"text":"We went back because our first experience was so good. I don't know what happened! We ordered to go like usual, we get home and the order is completely messed up. So we drive back with the food (not touched or eaten) and complain saying this isn't what we ordered. The hostess started arguing with me and my boyfriend being extremely stubborn thinking she was right. All we wanted was what we ordered. We ask to speak with a manager, there's no manager there so we have to call him. My boyfriend is on the phone with this guy for 20 minutes arguing with him, when he's not even there in person to see or understand what's going on. It wasn't a big deal what so ever until the restaurant made it into one. I couldn't believe this place. At this point we just want our money back. The total was about $35, so we weren't walking away without a refund for the food we didn't eat. About 30 minutes later we finally got our money back. Will never be coming back to this place again."}
{"text":"Stay away.  It is dreadful.  Starting with the greasy apps and on to the Thai Chicken made with frozen French fries.   when I asked the manager he said because fresh potatoes take to long to cook.   Really??"}
{"text":"After all the good reviews I have to say I was disappointed. Anything fried was overdone, and the chicken and veggie dish was overpriced and bland. The customer service was great, but the food was expensive and sub-par."}
{"text":"Excellent and courteous Service, Eat in, Take out or Delivery, (I've tried all Three).  Excellent Food_ I Will Be A Regular Here. xie xie"}
{"text":"Far and away my favorite Chinese restaurant in Phoenix. Start with the friendly, family oriented service. Members of our family have been eating here for thirty years. We are always greeted like old friends, even if we haven't been by in months. My only complaint? The staff seems to look younger than ever, while I get older and older. Oh well.   The food is wonderful. Our family favorite is the Bo Bo Platter, a delicious participatory collection of egg rolls, shrimp, honey chicken, fried won ton... and you get to play with fire. Upon completing the platter on our most recent visit, our six year old remarked, \"You mean there's more food coming?\" Yes there was and she managed to find plenty of room for the Moo Shu Chicken, or what she called her \"Chinese burrito\". The little ones also love the aquarium situated by the front door and their mom appreciates the clean rest rooms.   If you're looking for trendy, you might think that the China Village dining room could use a bit of an update. A fair observation, I suppose. It's comfy and familiar to us, however, so we hope they don't change a thing."}
{"text":"This pace is great. Did I say this place is great? Well great is an understatement. This place is AMAZING. Some of the best Chinese food in the valley I would have to say. The service here has always been fantastic every time my boyfriend and I have gone. They really have a knack for making you feel welcome and at home. They love customers with a good humor as well. The place itself is very cozy! it is always impeccably clean as well. It has a stand alone building location with it's own parking.   Now to get to the food..... Suffice to say, my mouth waters just thinking of this place. I absolutely LOVE it. The food is fantastic and the staff is so nice, they let me try as many things as I can turned vegetarian. I have never had an issue with getting sick from cross contamination. This place is SO vegetarian friendly. I personally recommend the Home Style Tofu (I believe that is what it is called, I'm not always the best with names but that should at least be close.).  My boyfriend has tried many of their meat dishes and gives them an A+ rating. This place is great for if you have mixed groups for dietary needs.   I recommend it to anyone wanting to have awesome food and friendly service. I love it here!"}
{"text":"I am from back East I cannot believe I have not discovered this place before. Very casual very authentic East Coast food and atmosphere. Service is great portions are large prices are very very reasonable."}
{"text":"I have been going to China Village for a few years now. Up until about 4 years ago it was the greatest place to eat. Today it is Christmas and we were too tired to cook dinner so we decided to get some Chinese takeout and I ordered chicken with broccoli and ended up with a soupy looking chicken dish that had green peppers in it. I did not eat it. My husband ordered sweet and sour shrimp and said it was terrible. The chow Mein was the only dish that tasted somewhat good. The restaurant was busy so I am assuming that's why the food was so horrible, however I don't believe that is an excuse especially when I'm spending money for a restaurant to cook my meal. I hope this never happens again and if it does I will not be eating at China Village ever again."}
{"text":"This is the best place for Chinese I have ever been to (and I've been to many in various states)! The food was extremely good and the food arrived very quickly.   The service was fantastic and the servers were very interactive and entertaining. The place looks a little older, but everything was excellent!   The price is decent and portions are a good size. Upon finishing, they provided complimentary dessert and gave additional suckers and high fives to the kids.  Definitely worth the 5 stars!"}
{"text":"We had a wonderful evening out with eggrolls, chow mein, bean curd soup, and some very happy looking moo shoo vegetables! The food was delicious with large portions.  The friendly, attentive staff and exceptional service really makes this place stand out. They really go above and beyond to make sure everyone is enjoying themselves. One stand out moment in particular- after noticing we were only ordering veggie dishes the man assisting us let us know that they are more than happy to cook up any vegetarian versions, even if not specifically listed on the menu. That level of thoughtfulness is greatly appreciated.   Don't miss this gem!"}
{"text":"I have been going to China Village for years. The outside might scare some away, and the inside is outdated, but the food is good! I usually do take out, and it is hot and ready to go about 15 minutes after order is called in. Their house special chicken is awsome, beef chow mein and beef and broccoli great, and a friend swears by the Kung Pao Chicken. The staff is GREAT, and the prices are right where they should be, for good chinese food."}
{"text":"No.... just no. This is Americanized Chinese food to the maximum. The food here was not very good and was fairly pricey. They offer 'dinner specials' that run about 14$ and come with a decent amount of food (soup, eggroll, the dish, rice). The issue is, the meal is way too much for one person but not enough for two. The husband got their pineapple chicken.... very sweet as expected. I got potstickers...they were not amazing. So why 3 stars? I can see why this place would appeal to some people and the egg drop soup wasn't bad. Would I come back? No... not with the close proximity of better options."}
{"text":"Came here tonight for dinner. So my husband and I have been searching everywhere for our next favorite Chinese place ever since Little Peking closed down. It didn't compare but it was still good. One thing I really liked was as soon as we sat down they brought us water and hot tea.   We started off with the dumplings. They were good but their sauce needed more soy sauce added. Then we got the sizzling rice soup w extra $2 sizzling rice. Pretty good. The soup base tasted like chicken noodle soup but the sizzling rice came out perfect! Loved all the extra veggies and shrimp in the soup.  For our main entrees, I got the Kung pao shrimp and my husband got beef n broccoli. Kung pao shrimp was good but a little disappointed it wasn't spicy at all. And it had a little bit of sweet taste which was a first for me ordering a Kung pao dish. The beef n broccoli was good. The beef looked a little thin so was worried about the quality but it was soft and tender.  Overall everything was good and moderately priced. Will come back here again!!"}
{"text":"I work in an office building near the Biltmore, and my coworkers and I have ordered here often. We love Chinese food, and the food is definitely delicious. However, we have issues every time we place an order by phone.   The first time, I was told that the lunch special has soup, but that it would not be included on delivery orders. I then asked if the price would be less since part of the special would not come with the meal but they said no. I let that roll off my shoulder and accepted the delivery order.   The second time, the lady said they didn't deliver to our office and said the order would only be available for pick up. I explained that we have had delivery ordered before, but she said they were too busy and that we should call back later.   My final straw - 5 of us were ordering and 3 of us had credit cards. She said we should put the whole order on one credit card because they don't make money by running more than one. I am baffled that this restaurant would rather save money on credit card fees than to accept different methods of payment. Needless to say, our weekly office Chinese order will be from a different establishment."}
{"text":"I am loving my new neighborhood Chinese joint, China Garden. I am giving them 5 stars for tasty food at a great price with very excellent accomodating service (not grading for ambiance- just be aware that the dining roomis pretty outdated but still comfortable). Where else can you go for Chinese food for dinner and get a dinner special for $12 or less that includes soup and three appetizers. While we were there our waiter also brought out some little extras to try including the special of the day as well as a fresh baked macaroon. Yum!  Update 9/2013 Ok, Chaina Village is still pretty cool but after trying a few more items on the menu I am less impressed by the ingredients as time goes on. Pretty sure they are using canned rather than fresh veggies and their meat is eh. Still tasty but not ideal."}
{"text":"Sizzling rice soup and the Family Style Tofu.  Add that together with the fact that the staff here are the NICEST PEOPLE on the planet.  It's gone up one more star."}
{"text":"I went to China Village for the first time. 4 stars because of the attentive service. The chef and owner (I presume) delivered my meal to me and checked in to make sure I was satisfied. The waitress was just as attentive. At the end of my meal, the chef brought over a mini coconut macaroon that he warmed up. It was quite delicious.  As for my meal, I would give it 3 stars. The food was decent but it didn't blown me away. I got the beef chow fun lunch special. If came with 2 fried wontons, an egg roll, a small appetizer sized soup, and I opted for fried rice. The egg roll and soup were pretty good, but I thought the fried rice and fried wontons were really bland. The chow fun had a nice texture and the right balance of noodles to meat. I prefer more noodles than meat though, so if you're into a lot of meat, you might be underwhelmed. Maybe. Maybe not. The sauce on the noodles needed just a little bit more flavor. As soon as I added a smidgen of soy sauce and hot sauce, it was good for me.   The decor is a bit dark since there aren't any windows. I don't know why so many buildings in the valley are built this way.   I would say, give this place a shot. I'll try it at least one more time and try another dish, since it was decent."}
{"text":"The Service and Food is amazing!! For sure a must try if you looking for an authentic, hole in the wall, this your spot!!!"}
{"text":"Best Chinese (American style) food that I have had in Phoenix. I live in Tempe, but I find myself driving out here to have some spare ribs, sweet and sour pork, chow mein, and hunan chicken. Such a delight in this desert where Chinese food is... not great. It's a bit of a wait sometimes once you order, but definitely worth the wait."}
{"text":"This place is OK. They have a full bar in the back. Maybe I'm too picky with Chinese food but I think the taste was off for me on multiple dishes.  It was hot and fresh so give it a try if you like the other reviews. They have dinner specials like lunch specials. Just below my par."}
{"text":"*DO NOT USE PRICES FROM THEIR WEBSITE* I looked at their website before ordering and then called my order in. When I arrived she charged my card and told me the price. It did not add up. After I asked her she said \"the prices on website not correct. We have to pay to update website so it's not accurate\".... are you kidding me?!   I got home with the food. Sat down to eat and no silverware/chop sticks to eat with. What restaurant doesn't provide this with a to go order?   Once I got my own silverware to eat with. I sat down to eat. I had ordered crab puffs, fried rice, and general tso chicken (comes with white rice). The crab puffs barely had any cream cheese or crab meat in them, it was basically just the outer shell. Some of the chicken didn't have any sauce on it. The fried rice had no vegetables, it only had a little bit of egg and was very bland.   Overall this place was terrible and I would give them a 0 if I could. Will never return here again.  It seems they are trying to cut their costs too much that it makes the experience terrible."}
{"text":"Food was delicious and service was good.  I can't find anything to say bad about the food and service.  The building, well let's not judge a book bye it's cover. Great place for lunch or dinner when your on a budget."}
{"text":"This might be one of my new favorite Chinese spots in the Valley of the Sun. Amiable service with a great selection of items for lunch and dinner. Their cocktail menu was rockin'! You can share a few plates here (they serve huge portions) and sample all they've got. The Hot & Sour Soup was both Hot and Sour - very good in my opinion. We then shared Beef with Broccoli, Mongolian Beef, BBQ Pork Fried Rice, and Tangerine Beef - all were quite delicious. There are also traditional family style dinners on the menu as well. We will be back and Soon!"}
{"text":"We were near downtown on Friday night and decided to go for Chinese - I consulted Yelp (I'm getting better at doing this...) The reviews were mostly positive, describing this place as funky old-school chinese, and chinese food for non-chinese people, haha! Americanized Chinese, Perfect! Yeah, it's a bit out of date, and reminded me of the chinese restaurant scene from Cheech & Chong's Nice Dreams (82), minus Pee-Wee Herman and Cheech & Chong... So far as I could tell, the reviews were accurate. We had Yut Shan Eggplant and Hunan Chicken, both were very tasty and came with a big bowl of rice and a big pot of hot tea was included too (remember when that was standard, before they started charging $3.79 per cup of tea?). Prices for dinner were a little higher than expected, nonetheless, large portions so you will likely be taking home leftovers. I really want to return for the lunch specials because it sounds like more items are included for one price. This place reminded me of the (no-doubt Americanized) Chinese places that I grew up with, most of which are now gone and have been replaced with trendy, snobbish 'bistros' that will charge you $30 a plate without batting an eye. China Village is more of a family joint, at one point half of the staff had surrounded a table with a young family, were teaching the kids chinese words, and then told the parents that their kids were going to be working in the kitchen - I think they believed it! Funny as hell, you had to be there... certainly a light-hearted, fun atmosphere and everyone looked to be having a great time."}
{"text":"I've lived here in the neighborhood for about 4 years now and I just tried this place for the first time. I was really pleasantly surprised! The outside of the restaurant leaves much to be desired and the inside isn't fancy by any means. The people that run the restaurant are super friendly and nice and even had us laughing throughout the meal. They had a good sense of humor and I can appreciate that. Our food was served hot and really delicious. The complimentary hot tea was a nice touch. I would highly recommend the beef chow fung noodles. Our dishes came with soup and some various appetizers including a chicken wing, spring roll and a crab Rangoon. The chicken wings were really crispy and had a sticky honey sauce on them that was very good. I'd consider ordering these as an appetizer. You definitely won't go hungry here, they make sure you have plenty of food!"}
