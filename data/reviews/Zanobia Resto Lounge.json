{"text":"My first day at Zanobia and last! I order shisha (the mix), the waitress tells us that its tobbaco and not herbal. And as I am attempting to take my first toke of the shisha, the water from the base goes through the hoes and gets all in my mouth. That's probably the most disgusting thing to ever happen. After telling the waitress what happened he says he's sorry then takes the shisha and walks away. At that point I just wanted to leave the place. He comes back to me saying that he just cleaned the shisha thats why water went in my mouth. Which is the worst excuse because I felt the water came from the base of the shisha.   And then my friend then tries his shisha, after being promised a tobbaco flavor we find out it was herbal.  Worst service, worst shisha and  fake promises. I am really disapointed."}
{"text":"We had our Daughters Pre-Bridale party last night around 50 people, we had such a great time. The Food was excellent fresh and lots and lots of it, service was excellent and the music  was so good that reminded us of back home. Good job Guys keep it up."}
{"text":"THIS PLACE IS DISGUSTING! HOW ARE THEY STILL OPEN?   These people bring shame to the Arab community of honouring and serving guests. Greedy pigs are only in it for the money. It is a family owned business and everyone backs up each other so if you aren't happy, THEY DO NOT CARE.   I booked a table for 10 people and I come in, they don't even remember my reservation. The place was empty and there was a HORRIBLE Dj playing terrible songs. Half these people can't even speak english. We sit down and the first thing they say to us is, \"it's $10 per person even if you don't order\"no hi, welcome or anything. They forcefully charge people. Ridiculous. We complained about the DJ multiple times and we just got fed up since they weren't doing anything about it. Everyone decided to order something since they are going to charge everyone anyways. I'm sure they lied about the meat being halal since they serve alcohol. The shisha was a disappointment, it burned out in 10 mins and they only have 5 or less flavours. The waiter (I'm assuming its the owners son since he was an asshole like the rest of them) gave everyone's order to the wrong person. It took them almost an hour to bring appetizers out.  THEY GAVE US OLD MENUS. If you get them, it will say \"every friday beers are $4.50\". They charged my friends $9 just for a beer. When we confronted the fat lady at the bar, she was being rude about it. I told the waiter they are in a contract law as we came here for service and this (price difference) is false advertisement. Ofcourse, the lady from the bar comes over to me and starts yelling. She's like \"these are the old menus\". Clearly, if you give us \"old menus\" you have to honour the ad. Everything got blown out of proportion and they ruined the entire night. We were verbally assaulted and threatened but they had the audacity to say \"we will call the cops on you\". Ofcourse they were bluffing the whole time.   The manager thought he was so smart for offering a 10% discount but recharges it for gratuity. Nice try bastard. Oh yeah, gratuity is also forcefully charged (we were forced to pay about $20 for this repulsive experience.) They add a bunch of stuff to your bill, so please pay attention to the receipt!   Everyone who gave this place more than one star is probably affiliated with them or the owners probably made fake accounts.   STAY AWAY, PLEASE! SAVE YOURSELF FROM THESE PIGS. Take your business elsewhere.   IF YOU HAVE TEENAGERS, DO NOT ALLOW THEM TO COME HERE,  THEY SERVE ALCOHOL TO MINORS. NO ID CHECK."}
{"text":"Came here on a Thursday evening. The place was fairly quiet. There were only 2 groups of people at two tables. All of them were under the age of 20.  They only have maybe 5 flavours of sheesha. When we asked why, and why they did not have a particular flavor we were told that Zanobia \"is a lounge, not a sheesha place\".  Asked for a menu, and were brought a little stand which listed the drinks as wine, beer, juice. One of the drinks was listed as \"Vodka and Orange Juice\". For $8.50 you'd think they would come up with a better name.  Overall, this place is okay but there is definitely much nicer sheesha places which are also not as pricey. Will not be going back here again."}
{"text":"Its a great place to celebrate something. I went there with my wife on a Saturday night and I took there entertainment package.  The food was awesome!!!! The service is as you would accept in any arabic restaurant slow... but that the norm so chill and relax. Plenty of food to be each all night long. A little price Entertainment include live singers, musicians and a belly dancers. I also ordered there double apple shisha and it was very well made.  Plenty of parking is available   Don't go too early everyone comes late."}
{"text":"this place is a fraud. staff are slobs, disgusting. Friday night is \"wife & kids\" night, saturday night is \"girlfriend\" or anyone they can pick up night. so the owners do that, so the wives don't see the girlfriends, & they never show up on the same nights, so they don't see a guy with someone other than his wife. the poor wives.  they hit on any pretty girl there.  they don't pay their staff, pay them 2 months later, IF at all, & even then, cheques are always several hours short. they owe many staff members thousands of dollars, & staff will tell you they only stay because they need the money.  the kitchen staff drink & smoke shisha in the back, (& other illegal smoking) its disgusting.  when the health code guy comes in, he gets the \"herbal\" shisha, so staff is warned about him ordering a shisha, so he doesn't get tobacco, & shut them down.  Besides that, they force huge percentage tip on the bill, without giving customers any warning, which is not appropriate.  they hit on any & all cute girls.  Even majority of arab community says that place is trashy, dirty, disgusting, not respectable, & would never be seen there. Music is so loud your ears are ringing & can't hear what the person beside you is screaming in your ear."}
{"text":"Just 5 shisha flavours. Bad service. Very small menu and that too they dont have half the things on the menu. Never would recommend or go again. Total waste of time and money."}
{"text":"Came here with my boyfriend on a weekday around 6pm. The restaurant was empty so we got to choose where we wanted to sit. We had a great time. The waitress was helpful and super polite!  My boyfriend and I both tried the chicken wraps with fries. He is pretty picky when it comes to trying new foods so I was surprised when he loved the meal...he loved it so much that he ate half my wrap too lol  We finished off with some hooka. They offer three flavors (double apple, grape and grape mint). It was pretty good.   Will definitely be eating here again in the near future :)"}
{"text":"This place offers Lebanese Cuisine , part of it is a restaurant and the other part is a lounge. i went there on a Saturday night for their weekly dinner/show with belly dancer and an Arabic singer, it was my first time going there i wasn't sure of the entrance it just wasn't clear but i figured it out , the good thing is that they have a private parking lot. We enter the door and we ended up in the lounge section and had to go downstairs for the restaurant part. the layout of the restaurant is awful, its an L shape , then there is stairs to go up where they have 3 tables over looking the lower floor, we were put on the second level in the back so we had no view to the singer , the show nothing , all we could see are the tables below us!  i noticed that there were only  3 servers serving approx 80 people in the restaurant, needless to say we had to wait a while for the server to take our order and to get our drinks. When we asked why it was taking him a while he said he had a table of 10 that he was busy with!    The dinner package price include 10 types  of Mezzeh's which are small appetizers, and then the main entree was a combo of kabobs chicken and beef. The food was OK , the atmosphere was OK . They do offer hookah's , the price of it on their menu is $9 but once it was brought to us we were told that it had to be  paid separately which is fine but it was $17.50 apparently they jack up the price on Saturdays to take advantage.  Once the show started and we started dancing it was a little better . I have to say that they really have to work on their website, the pictures are nothing like the actual place, they don't have their  events updated, its like an amateur made it for them and its just an awful website for a business. This place has great potential if they invest in it."}
