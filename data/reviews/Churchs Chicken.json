{"text":"Every time I come to this place I am disappointed.  The hours if operation are clearly posted and when I get there (any time between 15-30 minutes before the posted closing hours) they claim that they are closed. It always seems to be the same night employees that are involved in this practice. :(  When I show up even earlier (around 6-7pm) they only seem to have spicy white meat chicken 1 out of every 3 times I order and they ignore any complaints with their night manager and cop attitudes when you do complain.   I am so done with this place, I'm calling corporate in the morning and filing a formal complaint."}
{"text":"The food is just fine but Michelle Is just plain rude. She needs a serious lesson on customer service. Or even common courtesy."}
{"text":"After I stayed loyal to my 6-month ban I have returned to this location 2x now and have been disappointed both times. Both times I got the chicken strips. Both times I was asked if I wanted dipping sauce. Both times I said yes to the dipping sauce. Both times I was handed my order with no dipping sauce.   At this point I'm thinking this might be more than mere forgetfulness. Is it possible that the staff here are stealing the dipping sauces to take home? Sounds ridiculous for most of us. But this location is staffed primarily by immigrants (I know because of the accents) and perhaps to them some free dipping sauce to take home to their families is a cost-saving measure. If you think about it, every chicken strip order that gets rung up is allotted 1-2 dipping cups. If they don't hand out dipping sauce several times a day, this adds up to a lot of free ones they can take home, without any shortage in inventory.   Anyway, the ban is back on. The location at 35th Avenue and Van Buren I've never had a problem with. So I will continue to take my business to that location."}
{"text":"Friendly service. I dropped by Church's downtown for a quick bite and to break a 20 dollar bill. The servers were nice. There were a few people who looked homeless patronizing the restaurant. The servers were polite to all. The sandwich I purchased was freshly fried after I ordered. However, the oil smelled a little stale to me."}
{"text":"My experience at this location is both dine-in along with drive thru. This corner location had speedy service. Not the friendliest staff but they do make sure your order is correct and you in/out at fast food pase.   They offer the same gray deals all locations offer. They just need to work on being friendly and having service with a smile. My experience today involved customer service from a manager. She was not the friendliest to the not only the customers but even her staff. They were young and probably their first job but it does not make it right to treat them like they are not apart of the team. This manager not only did not smile she did not greet you when you came in the establishment.   If this location could get the service aspect down. They will be winning!"}
{"text":"I only come here for the biscuits...from the other reviews and the homeless camp next door, I'd be afraid to eat here."}
{"text":"The service was horribly slow.  While waiting at the drive thru to order,  we waited 5 mins to order. One person would tell us to go ahead,  and then another voice would tell us to wait.  this happened twice. once at the window,  it took 4 minutes to take our money. As I wad a passenger,  I ran inside and saw it wasn't that busy."}
{"text":"I almost got food from churches tonight , went thru the drive thru after waiting close to 15 min without either one of the girls acknowledging me , my car started running warm and i had to leave. They would not look at me ,almost like i wasn't even there.....as I drove away, I noticed there was only one customer at the front counter and I think he was an employee. KFC and Popeyes both seem to be so much more organized with better customer service definitely.  Churches,not to be rude, is kinda the ghetto chicken place....."}
{"text":"There are bus station bathrooms that are probably much cleaner and certainly far less depressing than this particular Church's location. It's a rigorous mental exercise to imagine how the place continues to operate given the impossibility that anyone comes here more than once. Whether its existence is a positive or negative testament to fortitude of the human spirit and gastronomic tract is a question left open to the reader."}
{"text":"0 stars....went during lunch to try the smoke bourbon chicken. waited 10 minutes then ordered. was told that they \"we are out and it would be 17 minutes. we only cook 2 at a time. we expect to sell only 2 per 30 minutes.\" this is during lunch, mind you.so I wasted my hour. how can you not have a new, nationally advertised item READY, especially DURING LUNCH?"}
{"text":"Although you may think different ... this place is NOT FAST FOOD. They are located in the center of the 6th largest city and they have exactly ONE cash register. And not only that, the staff move as if they are mentally challenged and have an IQ of 60.  The food is typical Church's but ya' might want to plan ahead and make sure you have plenty of extra free time ..."}
{"text":"\"OPEN\" sign was on, I get to the drive thru to order, \"Sorry we are closed.\" F this location, it was before 10pm! Sketchy corner, too. There's always people hanging around outside turning tricks.  Avoid!"}
{"text":"I've been here 4 times now.  It was ok and worthy of 3 or 4 stars.  They got me bad in two ways though.  1.  Church's wings aren't crispy.  Wings gotta be crispy.  And Church's buffalo sauce is a syrup.  It's sugary.  It wasn't the BBQ!  It was the spicy buffalo.  It's the color of that bright red sweet-and-sour sauce at cheap chinese places.  And it's sweet.  No!  2.  This last time that I went the chicken was soggy, pouring grease, raw in the center, and it smelled strongly like piss.  I was not a jerk to the staff.  I just ordered and waited for it to be cooked.  They took it off the tray with the rest of the chicken.  I didn't get mistreated, it was just HORRIBLE food.  It was raw and smelled like piss.  That \"nobody flushed this toilet for 24 hours\" smell of piss.  Disgusting."}
{"text":"Customer service was horrendous. I've never had this bad of service at any fast food restaurant. Ordered the 'Summer Deal', and was told it would be ready in 15 minutes.  Came back after 20 minutes to check where my order was, and was told that their cook forgot to put the spicy chicken in the oven.  I was told to wait an additional 7 minutes. Around that time, I came around 7 minutes, and was told that they no longer had spicy chicken.  I was offered how many they had left (which was 5), and the rest would be original chicken. They wait until I came to complain to them to prepare my sweet tea. I was told that they ran out caps for their 1/2 gallon containers. So I was walked away to give food to the kids that accompanied me, so they could stay eating after half an hour. The worker never came to me, or let know that my sweet tea was ready.  The lady to the left of me asked for a cup for water, but the worker took a long time to prepare it to her while he was on his cellphone. The 2nd worker made a stereotypical gesture towards me and my friends. I would highly recommend not going here again."}
{"text":"Tammie was great! Chicken was fresh and hot. She was so polite and courteous. Thank you for the good service :)"}
{"text":"This location is on the corner where 7th avenue, Van Buren and Grand Ave intersect.  It's a convenient stop for those in the area wanting a drive thru dinner.  Once you enter downtown Phoenix you'll encounter only dine-in restaurants (except for the McDonald's catty-cornered from here).  Reviews for this Church's location say service is slow.  I've never experienced a long wait through the drive thru and the employees are generally nice.  Sure, the area is a little seedy, but the most perfectly brined and greasy chicken is served from their deep fryers!!"}
{"text":"Apparently they close at 9:30.... got there 15 mins till 10pm and no intercom. Car in front got pissed off and left. There was a car at the window. Finally got up to window. \"Oh intercom broken?\" No we are closed. It says you close at 10! Not this location that is wrong. I feel they just wanted to be done. Poor management. New hours need to be posted."}
{"text":"I got a call from the Store Manager today. She was very apologetic and said as soon as she saw my feedback, she spoke to her employees. She offered my next meal for free (I declined, I wanted to give feedback so they're aware of how customers are affected, not for a freebie). She also said she wants all her customers to feel like they're family. I won't return to this Church's, but glad she was able to have a talk with her employees. I suggested changing the environment also. Happy surroundings = happy attitudes. I hope that those who purchase at this place have a better experience."}
