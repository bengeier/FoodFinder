{"text":"What a Gem, never thought a bar could make pizza that good, the bacon pizza and phylli cheese are a must. Panini's are  also their thing and if u love meat the Lee is stacked with steak and pepperoni, cheese and no veggies, it's a heavy hitter. Prices are between 8$ and 14$ for lunch, but lookout for the specials, offering good value. Forgot to mention that it's a sports bar so yeah awesome Habs specials and great for events."}
{"text":"Great place!! Amazing food! The best pizza and subs. I love this bar cause owners and employees are so friendly, make you feel welcomed and so glad to be there... Ask for their secret hot sauce to try on your food, if you like spicy you are gonna looooove that one..."}
{"text":"i live down the street and its officially my bar. been there for breakfast and dinner as well. awesome food, great prices on food and drinks, specials all week long, and great staff.
since I've started going, i know most of the regulars, giving the bar experience a homey feeling as well
definitively reccommend this place instead of hitting up the crowded downtown bars"}
{"text":"Been curious about this place for a while and finally decided to check it out. Was looking for a place with both food and a bar and Solaris fit the bill. It's a medium sized bar with a kitchen that serves sandwiches, pizza, salads, and appetizers. The multiple TVs playing both NBA and NHL playoff games was a bonus. Oh yeah did I mention the jukebox and the video slot machines? We ordered a pizza (mozzarella tomatoes basil bocconcini) and the fried calamari with a couple drinks, and to our surprise, everything was solid. Points for the thin crust as well as the hot sauce they gave us on the side. But I think the best part was the service. Super sweet, making sure we felt at home and satisfied. Overall it was a great experience and I think we found our local watering hole."}
{"text":"Awesome food. Pizza is amazing. Burgers are delicious. Side salads are great. Paninis so good. Whatever you try from the menu will be good. And they will give you their secret hot sauce, SO GOOD. The staff is super friendly. Whenever I want to see a specific game, they will put it for us. And you can have food even at 2am. Really great place. I'm so glad I bumped into it a few months ago. I regularly go there now."}
{"text":"Awesome food. I go every single time I come to Montreal. Tell the owner, Roberto, that Carmelo sent you."}
