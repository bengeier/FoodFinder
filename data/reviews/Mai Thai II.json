{"text":"I really enjoyed the Pad Thai Chicken. I asked many questions and the staff was courteous and knowledgeable. There were not a great many people in the restaurant. It was comfortable and quiet."}
{"text":"Very good Thai food.  I like ethnic food not dummied down for bland Americans.  Very tasty and appropriately spicy as called for in authentic dishes."}
{"text":"Hands down the worst pad see ew I've ever eaten. The spice level was out of control. First time ever eating this using egg noodles which had no flavor whatsoever, not to mention completely dry. I could not use my fork to grab anything due to the egg noodles being what seemed to be chopped to bits before shoving everything into a plastic container. The price was over the top as well. Soup smelled like kitchen cleaner. Won't go back."}
{"text":"No doubt the best Thai food I have had in Charlotte. The staff is super friendly and the service is great."}
{"text":"Having eaten many thai restaurants and being laos myself I would have to say I would never eat here again....AGAIN! I ordered the spicy basil noodles and pretty much tasted the spice nothing else.  I mean it had no flavor, no sweet, no tang, or anything for that matter. My friends lard na was like a bowl of noodle soup..."}
{"text":"What a great place!  The best Thai food in Concord area!  Food tasted exactly as expected!  Spicy level was on point!  Service was prompt!  They have great lunch specials!  Have yet to visit for dinner but can not wait to do so!  At every Thai restaurant I usually get the cashew chicken; this was by far one of the bests!  I have tried in NY, CA, TX and GA; that tells you a lot!"}
{"text":"Great first time experience. Tom Ka Gai soup was fantastic as well as the Red Curry w/ Pork. My 10 y/o son is a fried rice critic and said this was the best he's ever had. 

Service was good but it was a slow night with it being the same night as the NASCAR race. 

Will be coming back and will recommend this place."}
{"text":"Their food is great and their portions are huge. Order one meal and split it. Their soups and spring rolls are amazing!!!"}
{"text":"My favorite place for Thai food. I love the basil fried rice and red curry. If you like your food to be spicy, you can specify the level of hotness that you want. I would recommend you to try this if you want some good Thai food."}
{"text":"Good Thai food for me. Fresh tastes and good portions. I had friend who never had Thai food before and really liked it. I saw reviews that were mediocre, but I really thought the food had a really good taste and wonder what the difference between their meals and mine were. I've been around many Thai places around the US and thought they had very fresh food that had great flavor. I had Red Curry with fresh rolls and thai rolls. All had great taste and the sauces were good too. Fresh rolls with Fresh mint are the best!
If you have a meal like mine you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"It's OK. We went at an off time of day so not the best point of view for a review. Pad Thai was OK,  could have been more flavorful. Thai tea was very sweet, but yummy."}
{"text":"This was a very nice place to eat.  The food is great and the atmosphere is very charming and friendly.  The servers were amiable and helpful, and came back to check on us multiple times.  The curry dishes are delicious. Definitely a place to check out and to try something new."}
{"text":"The servers here are so friendly and helpful, they even help me decide on my dish which I was kind of indecisive tonight lol. I ended up ordering Pad Thai and a thai ice tea...I know kind of typical...but I have been eating out Thai a lot recently so I decided to go with my craving :) It was really tasty and I love how they check on me to see how it was, awesome service! Definitely would come back :)"}
{"text":"This is our favorite Thai restaurant! 

We tried the restaurant after sampling their Emerald Rolls at the Taste of Charlotte a few years ago. At that time the restaurant was located in a strip mall on the Concord Highway. After losing their lease, they opened in their new location close to the Concord Mills Mall. We were so happy when we found them again.

We love the Emerald Rolls, Mai Thai Fried Rice and Pad See Ew! 

The staff are very friendly, the restaurant is clean and the portions are generous."}
{"text":"Meal was super sized but lacked many of the vegetables advertised in the menu.  It was tasty and made to order spice was just right."}
{"text":"This Thai restaurant is a good place for their fried rice and their Bangkok rolls. I sample their food during the taste of Charlotte and I have been going here ever since."}
{"text":"I love this place....my boyfriend is Thai and he agrees that this place and delicious, fresh and authentic.  I love their chicken larp salad and their papaya salad! Also chicken pad thai is good and their pad bai gra pow!"}
{"text":"The food is very good and the staff is friendly. I highly recommend the dish that is served inside the pineapple: you can get rice, chicken, shrimp, etc.
During peak hours the service can be on the slower side; but trust me, the food is worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Service is great, and the restaurant is nice and clean! We felt like the food is a bit pricey, though, and the green curry was too runny. Overall very tasty."}
{"text":"Nice clean bright place compare to other Thai restaurants. The service was very good and attentive.  I also like their simple lunch menu. 16 items with the same prices for veggie or meat options. The price pretty much about $1 more that other Thai restaurants. Thai ice coffee is good here. The food is okay, that's why I only five 3 stars. Pad See Eew noodle a bit bland and missing the wok char flavor. Pineapple Chicken Curry is good, my complaint is they got too much big chuck of sour pineapples is the bowl compare to the chicken,  bell pepper and other stuff."}
{"text":"The service was fine.  The food was just okay.  I have had better Thai food at many other places.  The flavors didn't really \"pop\" for me like they do at other Thai restaurants."}
{"text":"Great service! Made a mistake with my order and immediately fixed it, offered a drink on the house and a discount off my meal. Food is great too."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch and if you like your food sweet this is the place.. Started off with the Tom Kha tofu which taste like coconut & fish sauce the tofu was fried which was strange. Next was chicken satay, juicy but drizzled with coconut which made it sweet. Calamari had s strange batter nothing special and papaya salad which ordered hot taste like nothing. The papaya was over ripped. Don't think I'll go again very disappointed."}
{"text":"My absolute favorite place to eat. Kate always treats us like family and the food is consistently good. I love the crab Rangoon and the fried rice. I will continue to go back until we move away. The owners are actually from Thailand too"}
{"text":"Not sure if they changed the chef here or something, but the last time me and my fiance ordered food here it was not good. Because of the past we may give them another try."}
{"text":"I love this place! The prices are reasonable and the portions are huge. The servers are always friendly too. I usually get pad thia. At lunch pad thia comes with soup and a roll for only $7.99, and you get a ton of pad thia. Food is delicious. Nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"This is the best tai food in  the area.  Great customer service great food and affordable!"}
{"text":"I finally got the chance to try this quaint gem of a place yesterday. Quiet atmosphere, attentive staff, great lunch specials both in price and quality, and a perfect location right near the mall. I ordered the cashew stir fry with beef and requested that they add a little heat to it. The soup that came out first (part of the lunch special) was delicious. The main part of my meal came out with an emerald roll included and I must say that it was delicious. The rice was tender and flavorful, the green peppers were crisp, the beef tender, the vegetables fresh, and the amount of spice was perfect."}
{"text":"We just took a DoorDash delivery order from Mai Thai II. We have dined in here several times before and also received 1 prior DoorDash delivery. 

The food arrived stacked in a plastic bag: fried rice on bottom in plastic container, noodles above that in plastic container, curry in a flat round container, white rice in styrofoam on top, all knotted up in the plastic bag as mentioned. 

When I opened up the bag I immediately noticed the noodles had spilled out. I have shared the photos I took of it. I'm no physicist but it seems like the food was too hot for this plastic container and caused it to melt and fail. With everything stacked upon each other, weight could have compounded the issue as well.

I called the restaurant to describe the issue and the scene, but the person on the phone did not seem interested in addressing the problem itself. She did offer to make additional food, but no concern for the underlying problem. When I mentioned that I was disappointed she was not interested in gathering all the information about this issue, she apparently disconnected. Needless to say, I'm very disappointed with how this turned out, especially the weak response from the restaurant regarding my complaint."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is nice. Has appealing decor. The bathrooms were cleanish. Not overly clean. 
The food was sooooo good. The presentation of the food was really nice as well. They serve a dish in a cut out pineapple. Really cool! Will go back for sure!"}
{"text":"I don't care if it is good or it bites.  I've been waiting 45 min since ordering with no food served in a restaurant with only 4 of 25 tables occupied.  Never again"}
{"text":"very pleasantly surprised.

I got the Peak Kai Yad Sigh and it was really good.   I took the sweet sauce and mixed with their fish sauce (this is the real deal). 

What a great flavor.    

I really had no idea what to expect, but think \"Baked Stuffed Potato\" only with a monster chicken wing.   really surprisingly great."}
{"text":"Absolutely wonder food, very clean and excellent customer service. Quality meat and vegetables are fresh and not overcooked. Substitutes are not a problem. Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"This restaurant is so good there needs to be \"Mai Thai infinity\". I'm assuming this is a chain of the Mai Thai in Columbia, SC. I could eat this quality Thai food everyday. I've been twice to this location. It's never really busy so it's easy to get a table and service is quick. Nice and helpful waitresses that helped me expand my Thai culinary experience. Tried the Larb salad and it was very delicious. It's light and refreshing but a good size serving so you want leave hungry. Second time I had the massaman curry which was also very delicious. Served with lots of potatoes so I definitely couldn't eat it all but loved that I had left overs. Also got to taste my mothers pad Thai dish and it's one of the best pad thais. I know it's the basic thai dish to get but get it and you won't regret it! It's got the thin noodles which to me I favor because it collects more of the flavors of the deliciou"}
{"text":"Nothing really to write home about. It was ok. I felt like it was missing like that Thai flavoring. Also I read the other reviews about  how they make there dishes spicy by default and I was really underwhelm, but I can take the heat. I should of ordered it spicier."}
{"text":"The Mai Thai II House Salad and Duck Grapow were so delicious. One of the best Thai meals I've had in a long time. The servers were lovely and very helpful. Definitely recommend Mai Thai II."}
{"text":"The absolute BEST Thai food around.everyrhing is always tasty and to the spice level YOU want.staff is friendly and always on point.a great place to relax in a nice environment. Went with some friends last night and had the absolute best food.!!! We enjoyed the spring rolls, OHHH so fresh, Thom Kha soup.to die for.no one makes it any better. The pineapple rice is Huge and delicious. If you like curry try the massamun.its delicious. Don't be afraid to ask, owner Katy she is always more than willing to explain the menu options.i love that this is not a chain restaurant.they do it right.Go and enjoy.we did.i eat here at least once a week sometimes more.its my go to spot after work."}
{"text":"Great meal and super friendly service!  Passing through town on business and will definitely stop again."}
{"text":"Glad to see Mai Thai back, they've got good food and Concord has a serious dearth of good restaurants. Have never had bad service here."}
{"text":"We went there around 6:30 pm ... All the tables were empty.. Ordered Pad Thai and chicken Fried Rice.. The waitress swapped spicy levels, when we told her, she replied that chef has swapped and she had nothing to do with it... I told her it looks like pad Thai but didn't taste anything like that as it was very spicy.. She replied people from our place won't like it  and started explaining how it tastes... I was shocked to hear her response.. paid $32 bill and come out hungry.. I have been to Thai house, basil for the past 7 years and never had such bad experience.. Never going back to this place again.."}
{"text":"Great place to have thai food when you're in the concord area. Choose your spice levels to heat things up, and grab an Iced Thai Tea to cool things down. A must try if you haven't yet."}
{"text":"Best Thai in Charlotte area. Good service, clean and excellent menu. I had a dish ending in 'long song' VERY good.  Literally the only constructive criticism would be to dim the lights for dinner, add some table linens and you would have an upscale environment."}
{"text":"I really love Thai fried rice and had been so ready to try this place. Being in the Concord Mills area, I decided to stop for take out. The service was very pleasant and fast. The food is very expensive. I would have to say it is the most expensive out of all the Thai places I've tried in Concord. The portion was pretty big. However, the rice was very bland. I mean no flavor at all. I tried to force myself to eat it but couldn't. It wasn't good at all. This is the worst Thai fried rice I've ever had. Honestly, I've never had bad Thai fried rice. Very disappointing!"}
{"text":"Thai food is usually a safe option.

I don't think I have ever tried a Thai restaurant that wasn't good...until now.

Mai Thai II fit the bill when my coworker and I wanted a dinner that wouldn't be too filling. When we arrived to the restaurant, there weren't many people inside which somewhat concerned me, but when I saw the \"People Love Us On Yelp\" sticker on the glass door, I thought this place must be good.

Should have stuck to my first instinct...

The menu was nicely written with clear explanations of each dish. The two waitresses running the floor that night were very sweet and made us feel comfortable without a problem. Because I wasn't too hungry, I only ordered the pad kee mao with beef, advertised as spicy basil noodle on the menu.

I've eaten my fair share of pad kee mao and the one thing I love most about the dish is the aroma. The smell is absolutely mouthwatering thanks to the fresh basil and bell peppers, not to mention the spice level in the dish can clear your sinuses without a problem. So can you imagine my utter disappointment when I had a dish that was bland. How in the world is pad kee mao bland?

While there were plenty of bell peppers, I greatly disliked the addition of bamboo shoots that was soaked in a sauce that ruined the familiar smell of pad kee mao. It created a vinegar like smell that overpowered everything. The noodles were cut into strange bite size pieces, the texture wasn't soft, and the sauce was minimal. But what bothered me the most was the lack of spice! This was definitely not pad kee mao--not even close!

Perhaps I got there on a bad night. Perhaps it was just an off day, but I left having eaten only a quarter of my food. 

I'm a huge fan of Thai food because I always know what to expect. 

Ma Thai II was definitely unexpected and not in the good away."}
{"text":"Wow!! Don't let the store frontage detour you away from this absolutely gem. I was in the mood for Thai, and have to admit I almost didn't go in, and then when I did I still wasn't sure.... wow am I glad I stayed. Service was good, but the food was absolutely AMAZING!!! By far one of my top 3 of all time!! Will make this place a weekly must!!! The pineapple rice dish was so good!"}
{"text":"After spending all the money and energy in Concord mills, we started looking out for a thai place, apparently for my lady thai food is something that will provide her with all the energy and wisdom, lol.  Nah, we both love thai food.  So Yelp says go to Mai Thai II.
The restaurant was looking very neat and spacious enough, the waitress were polite and welcoming, not much crowd that night so we were seated and attended pretty quickly.
We did not try any new stuff but rather ordered our regular Chicken Pad Thai for myself and Chicken fried rice for me lady.  BUT we said 'make it spicy'.  Of course the waitress asked how spicy, like a 4 or 5.  I wish I knew the hot/spice levels of each and every restaurant and how it corresponds to the number 4 or 5.  Ugh..  I do not understand that logic of saying a number to determine the spice level, especially when its a first time to the restaurant and especially when you feel like eating spicy.
Anyways, we said 4, coz we wanted a nice spicy meal that night.  My Pad thai was looking delicious, it was a treat to the eyes, loved the presentation and all BUT it was super hot, I infact loved the first few bites because there is this underlying sweetness of the pad thai sauce but after a point my mouth and my eyes were both watering lol.  Pad thai was tasting really good but I would have enjoyed more if I had made a wise choice of spice level.
Chicken fried rice with extra vegetables was just as good, nothing extra ordinary or special. Again too spicy.  
Bottom line - please make sure to choose wisely with spice levels. Service was great, ambience was neat."}
{"text":"This is the best Thai food around. I had the best meal I've ever had here. Hands down."}
{"text":"I've lived across the street from this place for almost 3 years and only went today. So glad hubby and went. He had the house noodles and I had the Pad Thai. Both were delicious! The soup and spring roll were very good too. 
A bonus is it's comfortable inside and the service is great!"}
{"text":"The Service is great. The Thai food is alright. I've had some amazing Thai food in the past though so maybe that altered my opinion. But I still get my Thai food from here every once in a while. I think their drunken noodle is really good and will typically order that. It is good, just not the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"I just want to say this is the best Thai restaurant in the area! Kate was very pleasant and warming not to mention kind. I would highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Nicer inside than you would think - and pud thai was very good!  We both had that, one w/shrimp, one with chicken.  Service was good, and restaurant was a nice and quiet place to slip away for dinner."}
{"text":"We are big Pad Thai fans and search it out in every city. This is slightly different from what we've had before, the noodles are thin and short. We ordered the 2 in spice and our mouths we're on fire!
But, its great. Just a big, big portion... I suggest you split it. Seriously.
We also had the Tom Kah Soup. It only had mushrooms, chicken, onions and tomatoes. Needed more, and smaller bites. The broth was great, though. 
The staff was very friendly, and took good care of us."}
{"text":"Love it! Great food every time even if it's not close to the house. Great service and consistent."}
{"text":"Went in alone.  Monday night. The place was empty. But totally delicious. I ordered 5 out of 5 (Thai spicy) chicken and shrimp spicy basil noodles. Totally would recommend."}
{"text":"The Mee Krob, Khee Mao, and Tom Ka are wonderful!!!  Good and friendly service,  very helpful. My new favorite."}
{"text":"SO HAPPY to see Mai Thai open again! The food is amazing (yellow & green curry highly recommended). I've had nothing on the menu that wasn't stellar. Lots of options for the vegetarians and healthy eaters. One of my favorite places for dinner."}
{"text":"Located close to concord mills, this is a decent thai place for lunch or dinner.

The prices are on high side compared to your regular thai restaurants. An entree is around 15$ to 16$.

We've tried their basil fried rice, seafood noodles and veg noodles. While the portion was decent, the food isnt the best thai food i had. The tom yum soup wasnt good at all. 

The service was decent. Overall an OK place if you want to try something around concord mills area."}
{"text":"Great service, fantastic food. Tonight having shrimp pad Tia shrimp were good size very flavorful. My favorite dish is would have to be spicy basil chicken. This is a must if you enjoy Thai food ."}
{"text":"Good! This place is a really cute restaurant with super friendly staff. We went for lunch and got the lunch special. One of us got pineapple curry and the other got the green curry. We shared chicken satay for the appetizer. The lunch specials also came with a soup that had a taste similar to reallly good chicken noodle. The chicken satay was tasty, but the chicken had a texture similar to fish and was not as great as other chicken satay I have had. The curry was really good. I will go back for that. Just be careful with the spice level you order. The Thai iced tea was also really good. I will give this place another try."}
{"text":"Dropped in for lunch yesterday to order carry-out.. VERY warm and friendly greeting. Offered water at the bar while I waited for preparation of my order. Food was delicious and ample portion for the price. I will return."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places. Ladies who work in the restaurant are so welcoming, I feel like I am an actual guest vs simply a customer. Katie has always given my family amazing service and is extremely friendly!  Love the new decor and the new place, nice atmosphere and great location especially if you are wanting to eat something other than box-restaurants near concord mills. Appetizers & soup are the best I have had at any Thai restaurant in Charlotte. Had the emerald rolls (not greasy at all) & their TomKa soup is made properly. They will add anything you want to it, my mom likes shrimp, I am vegan and they make mine with tofu and vegetables. Broth is great, sweet and spicy! Portions for entrees are more than enough for dinner plus plenty for lunch the next day. Was again impressed they remembered dietary preferences and made sure to make our entrees based on preferences only stated once. Highly recommend any of their curry dishes or pad Thai!!"}
{"text":"We just moved from NYC, so we were in search of a \"go to\" Thai restaurant. Unfortunately, the search continues as Mai Thai II did not meet our expectations.    

Pros:  Friendly staff, relatively large portions.  
Cons:  Food was unremarkable."}
{"text":"Not a great experience. We ordered an appetizer that was not at all what we expected. Fortunately they took it back."}
{"text":"I dropped in here on the road because of the great reviews. They were right on. The food was delicious and the staff was extremely friendly and worked really hard. I talked with one woman at the bar for a while and it felt like a place Id been to a hundred times. It's got a really nice layout with tables both inside and out on the deck. The crab Rangoon was absolutely delicious and the pad this was great with huge portions. 

Best decision I made today was to stop by here on the way to DC!"}
{"text":"Oh wow. Just had the Duck Grapow. Fantastic. Friendly family business with great, authentic food. If I lived here this would be a \"go to\" place for me."}
{"text":"Very good loved my pad Thai. The soup was good glad to find Thai here was hard to find"}
{"text":"Outstanding food and service  Had the spring rolls and they are light and fresh with the Tom Kha soup and crispy noodle bowl. Beyond Delicious !!!!!"}
{"text":"Mai Thai is nestled in a little strip mall near Hendrick, next to a dance studio and a Firehouse Sub. It is nicely decorated with a full bar, booths and tables. 

The food is decent. It's not amazing BUT it's Thai food in Concord so I can't complain too much.

I had the coconut soup and there wasn't as much coconut milk as it should because it was a bit watery. The noodles for the Pad See Ew was not as soft as it should be, but tasted good the next day when I microwaved it. 

Overall, if you have a Thai craving in Concord, this is a good place to visit. 

Free parking in the lot and the prices are decent."}
{"text":"But would give it a second chance

I was on business travel so alone. Went because other good reviews. I guess I should expect this but I wanted a little variety so asked if they would provide a smaller size serving of spring roll since I was alone. They wouldnt. Not unreasonable but it would have been easy enough it seems. 

Also asked for pad thai \"medium spicy\" (and I love spicy food) but it was eye watering, nose running hot. I would have never been able to handle the normal at this rate! 

Knowing this I would give it another shot if in the area and in the mood for thai and in the mood for spicy and with a friend. 

Service was \"eh.\""}
{"text":"Authentic Thai food. I am a regular here and I always leave feeling full but not with a gut ache. LOVE the pineapple curry!"}
{"text":"I went here thinking I'd enjoy a nice stir fry. It's a nice location and almost a whole in the wall. The reason why I give it a 1 star is because I found black hair in my food. That ruined it for me and for that reason I wouldn't return here or recommend it. The place wasn't busy during lunch our either, outside of us there was one other family there. There's no excuse for it."}
{"text":"Delicious, vegan options. Surprisingly good pineapple curry."}
{"text":"I got my food less than 5 minutes after I ordered it. I'm no thai food conas... connaus... Cona-saurus Rex but this was some pretty good eats. Get the Thai tea! It's amazing."}
{"text":"We ordered the red curry and spicy basil. Very very delicious!  Will be definitely coming back.  Green curry was also a recommendation.  Prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"Stopped here after a trip to the neighboring Great Wolf Lodge. Everything here was tasty, the portions generous for lunch, and our hostess made sure that our picky daughter got a meal that would make her happy. We'll be back on our next getaway."}
{"text":"i go here a lot, the food is good & it's a pretty big portion. a little too over priced in my opinion. it's always a hit or miss, i don't want to pay 14$ for pad thai and not know whether it will be good or not. i always ask for it spicy and it is never made spicy, they also have crappy flimsy to-go containers. i like this place just wish they could be more consistent"}
{"text":"This place is very close to Concord Mills mall, so you don't have to eat crappy food court food when you're out shopping. The place is new (they moved from a different location). All the people here are very warm and welcoming and they will remember your special requests if any. We were surprised when we went here a second time and the host brought me chopsticks and said \"I remember you eat with chopsticks but your husband prefers a fork,\" haha... That really surprised us.
As for food, they have amazing pad thai and pad kratium if you like spicy garlicy food. Their pad kee mow is out of this world, and the red curry is good too. The service is quick and they will make sure your drinks are always full. Just love this place so much, can't say enough good things about them."}
{"text":"A nice Thai place. The staff is friendly and the food is tasty (I have ordered shrimp Pad Thai). Portions of food as well as Thai iced tea are very big. Spice level was just as I have asked. 

Interior is not too fancy and the place is not too big, but for me it was not an issue. 

I'd come back again if I'll be in the area."}
{"text":"It's very good restaurant for Thai food.
We had basil chicken rice,it was ok.staff is friendly. Just keep eye on silverware."}
{"text":"It was a good exepeience to go out and eat here but did not meet full expectation of Thai Restaurant. Pad thai was different than it should be. I like Bankok spring roll and friend rice. You can try this place if you are near concord mills mall area."}
{"text":"Not authentic.  We ate there for lunch.
 They gave us the lunch menu.  We ordered #1 (pad Thai), #11 & 16.  Three diff types of foods and they were horrible. one taste fishy which we barely touched, pad Thai taste like ketchup but my kids ate it because it's sweet, and another we barely touched.  The waitress was very nice and for her to see 1253 Buck Jones Rd, Raleigh, NC 27606that the food was barely touched should have given us a discount at least. what a waste of food and money.  Clean restaurant but we just had a bad experience"}
{"text":"Tried the Basil Chicken at Taste of Charlotte a few days ago and wanted to try to rest of the menu. The lady's that work at the restaurant are extremely friendly and welcoming. They gained my loyalty as a customer. 

We ordered the chicken fried rice and chicken pad Thai for dinner...very good!!! 

My husband says 5 stars!"}
{"text":"I've had food here once before and it was pretty great. I recently got an order of Pad Thai and fresh basil rolls fulfilled through Postmates. This is probably the most expensive Thai restaurant in the area, even before the Postmates fees. The portion size for the Pad Thai was very generous, but the rice paper wrapper around the basil rolls was tough and the rolls themselves were pretty flavorless. The Pad Thai itself didn't have enough sauce or something... It just didn't taste all that good. I recommend going to Thai House University instead."}
{"text":"Addicted to their spicy basil noodles or rice and the red curry with spice level 5! It's delicious...."}
{"text":"Typically Uncrowded thai restaurant in a strip mall with food that is surprisingly good. Large portions."}
{"text":"Went to Mai Thai for the second time tonight thanks to my sister's request and a coupon.  I must say that for the second time in a row, the food was awesome.  My son ordered the spicy basil noodles with tofu at spice level 2 and my sister ordered it as well but with chicken and at level three.  I tasted both and the three was a bit too spicy for my liking.  Very good, but just a tad too much heat for my tastebuds.  The two was just right.  I cannot remember the name of the stir fry I got, but it had cashews, green peppers, pea pods, mushrooms, onions and baby corn.  It was absolutely delicious!!!  I could have drank the sauce through a straw!  We also ordered the crab rangoons for an appetizer.  They were tasty, but I felt they had a little too much of a cream cheese flavor.  I prefer more crab.  The staff was very friendly and attentative on both occasions.  We will definitely be back, no coupon needed.  I will happily pay full price for such excellent food.  We live in Concord and have tried Thai Emerald.  The service was also good, but Mai Thai's flavors were so much better!"}
{"text":"I walked into this place because I was looking for a good Thai restaurant in the Concord area. I went into the restroom first and it was in such disarray in disrepair that I figured I was taking my life in my hands to eat here. Would not go back."}
{"text":"Nice place and good food. But the food had more oil in it. Appetizer-Chicken satay was chewy not sure why. Entree was fine. Surprised to see that all the tables are free and we were the only one. Silverware can be little more clean."}
{"text":"Food did not taste fresh- my food did not have a great taste. We got the basil rolls needles and curry and it left a stale taste in our mouths ."}
{"text":"Small quiet location tucked away in Concord...the staff is friendly. I think it's a little pricy for the quality of food. I ordered the shrimp Pad Thai which I found greasy.The noodles were a little over cooked for my taste. The thai tea was the best part of the meal."}
{"text":"The staff is very friendly and helpful. We normally get pad Thai but Kate had given is great suggestions on what to try. Food is great. Beer is cold."}
{"text":"Great affordable and tasty lunch specials 7 days a week. I love the Tom yum soup-full of chunks! I get pad Thai with chicken spicy level 3. The emerald rolls are great. Service is great. The restaurant is clean and there's plenty of parking. 

I have never been here when it has been busy or full but I think that is because it is relatively new and off the main road sharing a building with a jiu jitsu and kickboxing place. I recommend it but not for very large groups since it is small."}
{"text":"I write this as I sip peppermint-ginger tea in an attempt to settle my stomach after eating at Mai Thai II this evening. I used to really like this place, but it seems to keep going downhill. 

I was never a fan of the ambience in the restaurant, so I almost always order takeout. The place is usually pretty quiet because it's always nearly empty, and the music they play is designed to put you to sleep or take you back a few decades, depending on the day. I always found the booths really uncomfortable too; the seats really lack support and the tables aren't wide enough. 

The food is wildly inconsistent. I almost always order Pad Thai (yes I know I need to be more adventurous), so I can tell you exactly how inconsistent it is. Some days it's amazing, and other days I've been tempted to chuck it in the trash. Sometimes a \"spicy level\" 2 will burn your eyebrows off, and other times it's barely noticeable. Sometimes my takeout container is so full it's nearly popping open, other times it's not. And speaking of the container, it's a thin flimsy plastic one that makes me wonder how much is leaching right into my food..."}
{"text":"I went there with my office colleagues for lunch. They have pretty standard fare. The service was no frills, also I feel the portions were not sufficient. We tried the noodle, shrimp and chicken entree not their fried rice. The prices were pretty low, so I guess it kind of makes sense. But its no fancy Thai place. You can try it if you are in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Not a fan. Ordered the red curry, beef is a little too old...pineapple fried rice looks good, especially fried tofu"}
{"text":"Mai tai is an average thai restaurant, nothing more or less. It is located close to concord mills, in an inconspicuous little complex. We figured we'd give it a go and trick ourselves exercising by walking around the mall after. 

We arrived at the beginning of lunch time, we were the only customers. The service was meh... She wasn't mean but it wouldn't kill her to smile. The prices were kind of expensive compared to most thai places. We ended up ordering chicken fried rice and veggie kee mow off the lunch menu, still priced more than the average lunch menu. The items had basic flavor, there was spice which was night though. I didn't really take to the portion size, it was a little smaller than I expected...even for the lunch portion. The only aspect of this meal which was above mediocre was the soup, it was warm and refreshing. Very nice to start a meal on a cold day like this. I think I liked the soup more than my entree. 

Basically I wouldn't go out of my way to eat it but I would get some if close enough."}
{"text":"Good food and service. I tried a red curry chicken dish that was to die for. ,#3 on the heat level and my taste buds were working overtime."}
{"text":"The food is worth their price. This is a great find in charlotte, and the 3 spicy has some heat but no overpowering flavor. We had the seafood fried rice, pad Thai and chicken wing & papaya salad combo. Also the Thai tea came in a huge mug"}
{"text":"This place is solid!  Great Thai food. Flavors are reminiscent of a really good Thai place I frequently dined at in south Miami. Every dish I've had has been on point. On my last visit a couple of weeks ago, I dined in with some friends. Every dish looked good. Mine was excellent as was my husbands. A friend ordered a duck dish and it was delicious. No inconsistencies here. The waitress was very nice and seemed to have a great relationship with another lady whom I think is the owner. They were humorous and made for a pleasant evening.  The fried ice cream is killer!  Get it!  You won't be sorry."}
