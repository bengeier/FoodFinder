{"text":"Très ordinaire.
Le service est mauvais et long.
La nourriture est fade et trop chère.

Cet endroit ne survit que par la popularité de son voisin \"Le Vieux Vélo\" qui est souvent complet.

À éviter."}
{"text":"We came here by mistake as La Vieux Velo was entirely full. Wonderfully decorated and quiet, our waitress tended to us right away. We both ordered the eggs Benedict, one with salmon gravelax and one with their special sweet homemade sausage. 

It was so very excellent, eggs perfectly cooked! Plate was very large too, very filling. 

Would most definitely return."}
{"text":"Come here, have a relaxing, perfectly prepared French meal. 
Just minutes by foot from the Beaubien station on the orange line of the Montreal metro. 
If you want old school without pretense this the place."}
{"text":"Beau petit resto de quartier, trop peu connu!
Un peu cher pour les portions offertes, mais super belle et bonne place malgré tout! Il mériterait d'être plus reconnu"}
{"text":"Très décevant, sans goût et portion dans de mini cocottes... À éviter si vous avez faim.... Service minimum...."}
{"text":"Très bon restaurant. Une grande variété de plats parfaitement réalisés. Meme les vegetariens pourront se satisfaire.
Le service etait impeccable, chaleureux, de tres bon conseil.
Un seul point faible selon moi, la deco pas à la hauteur du reste  mais qu'on oublie vite une fois les plats servis."}
{"text":"Got to try this place on a freezing friday evening as we were just walking around aimlessly for something to warm us up... And there we saw it... the sign that said tartiflette, poutine and all other kind of food your body craves for when it is cold!
The concept is that all (or most) of your food is served in a cocotte. That means that sometimes it is cooked in something else then placed in a cocotte, sometimes it is cooked directly in the cocotte. (Did I mention they have cocotte?!)
We decided for the cocotte poutine and the cocotte québécoise (deer in sweet sauce). Both were quite good though nothing to rave about. 
The down point, and as other here have mentionned, is the serving size. Unless you take the appetizer, the main and the dessert, you will likely leave hungry. Since we weren't too keen on 15$ appetizers and we're not dessert persons, we did leave with an unfulfilled sense which is frustrating.
Nevertheless, it's a nice atmosphere and the service was really good. So give it a try if you're in the area."}
{"text":"L'ambiance est chaleureuse, la musique est bonne et la bouffe y est vraiment bonne.
Les accras de morue sont délicieux.  
Le burger d'effiloché de canard est décadent et les desserts sont encore meilleur.
En plus les prix sont abordables"}
{"text":"We randomly walked into this place for dinner, and every single dish that we tried was amazing!  We were with 3 kids, including a 21-month-old baby, and they were very accommodating.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"La Salad Biquette from @les_cocottes_mtl  is undefeated. Fresh cow's cheese, romaine lettuce, avocado, sesame seeds, balsamic vinaigrette, and grilled chicken. I'm a very picky eater so a limited menu is always a challenge for me but this is truly a customer oriented establishment. When I told our waitress I wasn't particularly interested in anything on the brunch menu, she spoke to the chef and he let me choose and customize something on the lunch menu. It was my best friend's birthday and they made sure to wish her a great birthday. Service was quick and the food was delicious.

{"text":"Les cocottes proposent un Brunch simple et relativement efficace. J'ai pris les ufs bénédictines au saumon (classique). Je ne vais pas critiquer la cuisson car tout était bien mais je trouve vraiment que ça manquait d'un petit quelque chose pour se différencier surtout pour le prix...

En plus de cela lors de notre venu il y avait une seule personne au service et je pense qu'elle était submergée"}
{"text":"vraiment delicieux!! jai gouter au accras de morue et au tartare de saumon, c'etait vrm bon! je ne comprend pas pourquoi quelqu'un a ete decu.. le service fut tres chaleureux, belle experience! à essayer."}
{"text":"Cute little place and rare brunch resto that you can rsvp! But food very very average and not much choice. The concept of building your plate is good but the choice are not very exiting or spécial.The service was very slow but people are nice. The coffee was delish but juice made from concentrate for 4$ was not exceptional...."}
{"text":"Excellent meals. There home fries are amazing!!! Eggs Benedict are on point! 

Everything is great here and fresh. Will come back again. Great atmosphere!!!"}
{"text":"We happened here by chance as the breakfast place next door was full,  but it was wonderful! Our waitress was adorable and very knowledgeable about the food,  and was very attentive to not only  us but  all her customers (seriously impressed with how she pulled that off). 

We had Eggs Benedict, mine was salmon and my Boyfriend had their homeade sausage Eggs Benedict. Eggs were perfectly poached,  flavour and presentation were perfect,  and they make a mean mimosa!! Will 100% be returning when we go back to Montreal."}
{"text":"We absolutely loved our meal at Les Cocottes. We were greeted by the waitress as soon as we walked in the door. We were the only people in the place, so we were actually a bit worried about the lack of diners. Thankfully, we decided to give it a try anyway.

The waitress was incredibly friendly and welcoming. She chatted to us about our trip to Montréal and explained to us what a cocotte was. 

We weren't sure which wine to order, so for fun the waitress brought us 2 glasses of wine but didn't tell us what each was so that we could do a blind tasting and decide without prejudice. 
This is just another reason we thought she was a great server.

We started with the house made fois gras, which was absolutely delicious. It was served with a fig jam which was also delicious. Our son tried the poutine, which was a huge serving and very good with plenty of gravy and cheese curds.

For entrée, my husband had the beef tartare which was the best we've ever tasted. It was seasoned to perfection with what tasted like a mustardy flavour and served with a delicious little side salad.

My son and I both had the 'mountains cocotte' which was quite like a potato gratin with bacon and also served with a delicious side salad. The cocottes were fantastic. So incredibly tasty and piping hot.

What a wonderful experience we had at Les Cocottes. If we find ourselves in this part of Montréal again we will most definitely return and will continue to tell everyone about this little gem of a restaurant."}
{"text":"As many of those who've reviewed, I too arrived here by accident. Next door had a line around the corner. So my party of 5 decided we didn't want to eat brunch by dinner time lol it was around 11 am and only had a few tables available. Immediately we're seated and given a cold jug of water while our husbands parallel parked the car.  We ordered mimosas all the way around the table (even though I truly ordered a Bellini, a mimosa was close enough since she made them strong). We noticed this restaurant was slowly but surely getting more and more customers and worried this smaller restaurant would  become slower with service-as there was only 2 waitresses. The menu was all in French- if you're a local this isn't a surprise to you. But the waitress was happy to translate all of it. Not very elaborate with the menu choices. There were 4 different choices on the menu. A granola and yogurt option, waffle and fruit option, a standard what I'd call an American breakfast with choice of; meat, egg, bread, potato, fruit/salad, and coffee, and lastly what seemed to be their showcase item, bennies! 4/5 opted for the bennies. I chose the in house smoked salmon benny. My friends opted for the sausage. Each came with salad, fruit, and what we'd call home fries. I think we all agreed later that the potatoes were way too salty. Besides the salty potatoes everyone loved their brunch and felt like prices were very much reasonable ($13-$17CA). Our waitress even gave us some tips on what to do later that day, she was super attentive and kept up with our frequent refills. All in all I'm glad we went with this establishment."}
