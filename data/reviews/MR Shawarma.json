{"text":"Their shawarma is just right. The staff are nice and makes you feel welcome. Their serving of shawarma on a plate is big. But my favorite here is their sweet pastry dessert. The place is just a little run down and needs to be brighter to attract more customers."}
{"text":"Shawarma here is top notch. The owner used to own a location in Spandia and Richmond so he has a lot of experience. 

And the Shawarma taste perfect, tightly wrapped and not too much juice flowing out and it was cooked to perfection, nice and toasty hot. Had the 2 sandwich special, had the beef and chicken for only $6.49. Can't beat that.

Simple table and plain tile walls. Interior looks cold and dull but it's exceptionally clean and they have been here for a year. 

Surprised to find a Shawarma place up here will surely swing by next time I'm in the area. If you like Shawarma, this is the spot to be.

{"text":"Average shawarma. Meat is old, dry. Place feels run down. Staff are nice people, I just wish they had a better product offering."}
{"text":"Great quality shawarma at an excellent price. The aesthetic of the restaurant needs work, but the taste of the shawarma more than makes up for it."}
