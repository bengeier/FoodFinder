{"text":"Tenoch's tacos al pastor rival my abuela's. That alone says a lot. You definitely won't be disappointed with the cuisine.   However, the service takes about an hour to an hour and half to get the food, and then another 30 to an hour to pay. I know it's made to order, but there are other Mexican restaurants close by that offer the same thing, and can prepare it in half the time.   If you can spare 2 hours for tacos, they're worth the wait."}
{"text":"Best pulled pork sandwich ever, along with chicken sandwich and tacos and quesadillas, everything is authentic and delicious. Getting pretty busy so call ahead."}
{"text":"I really liked this restaurant.  The service was good. The waitress was very quick to our table when we entered to give us menus.  The food tasted excellent: I ordered Enchiladas de Mole and a Negra Modelo beer. There are large portion sizes at this restaurant, from what I saw we ordered. I struggled to finish my plate, but I'm very happy to have gotten that much food for the price I paid, so the value for the money was excellent.  If I'm in the area again I'll definitely make another visit to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Do you like to eat amazing food?  Not afraid of spice? Then check out Tenoch restaurant of St. Clair West!! Last time my hubby and I split the tinga (chicken) tacos (5 for $11.50) and Chorinachos-chorizo sausage, beans, cheese ($12).  Try their tinga enchiladas and chorizo tacos too. So much good stuff on the menu. Can't wait to try it all!! Service is meh but food is great!!!"}
{"text":"They re-open!! still as amazing as before! Service is much faster now. They also have a Faceboook page now with updated info on closure :)"}
{"text":"The food here is outstanding and the prices are very reasonable.  It's a clean, authentic place.  If trendiness is important to you it's not the place.   The best mexican I've had in this city by a mile.   Pleasant service too.  Zero pretension which is a welcome change."}
{"text":"I don't really remember the name for all the dishes I had ordered, but food are good in there, they service bigger portion than other Mexican restaurants around GTA.... and the spicy dippings are homemade,100% nature."}
{"text":"Food is pretty good here. Chorinachos are so delicious. The Al Pastor tacos were a bit dry for my liking but i was able to try the Bistec con Queso (steak and cheese) and they tasted much better.   However, I'm disappointed with their customer service. I've called on a Sunday afternoon to order for pick up and I was told that they do not do orders over the phone because they're busy (could have least told me to call another time in this case but didn't), which was disappointing and then on another weekend afternoon I went to the restaurant to see if we can order in person and take the food to go and nope they didn't even wanted to do that. Bottom line, they don't offer their food to go and they don't seem to even care to satisfy their customers."}
{"text":"Most authentic Mexican food in the city in my opinion. Sundays they offer a lamb barbacoa, it is delicious. Besides, their regular size of nachos feed a family and are spectacular."}
{"text":"Tacos here are fantastic.  I tried to go back for a second time in less than a week but was disappointed to find they close at 7:30 on weeknights.  I hope they expand service at this location and open more because this place is a shining example of authentic tacos the way they are meant to be.    The tamales are HUGE, and cost about $4.  I would say if you want to try them, get one for the table."}
{"text":"Incredibly slow service for such a small place. About 30 minutes after we ordered, we got our appetizers. The mains came about 30 seconds later. We ordered enchiladas, which were inedible piles of sour cream and cheese on a soggy tortilla, served with three tiny fragments of nachos in a tablespoon of beans. And there was bland rice with frozen vegetables mixed in. We left an excessive tip (the servers were nice, but not exactly attentive) just so we wouldn't have to wait for change."}
{"text":"My favourite mexican food in the city. Excellent chorizo con queso tacos, great value tamales, and overall an excellent spice blend and flavouring in everything they make. Friendly service, but expect a leisurely meal and possibly odd timing as to when things come out of the kitchen. That said, $5 tallboys of Tecate! If you're wary of anything north of Bloor/Dupont (where ever you see 'the city' ending), I urge you to make the trip to Tenoch, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great old school Mexican food. Food was delicious, cheap and plentiful. Some of the best I've eaten in the area. Highly recommend the mole tamale.   Service was pretty much non-existent so, if you care about that, this may not be the place for you. I know I'll be returning to try everything on the menu."}
{"text":"They just re-opened today with a NEW and better Menu!!! Lots more choices and all the great old stuff is still there!!! Woohooooo. Best most authentic Mexican food in Toronto!!!! A Must try. The nachos are amazing and the tacos are to die for."}
{"text":"This restaurant is so yummy.  Definitely one of the best Mexican restaurants in Toronto.  The quesdilla is unique and pretty big for the price.  The service is a bit on the slow side but the food it totally worth the wait.  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Went there with my husband and 4 year old daughter at 1:15 pm on a Saturday afternoon.  There was one waitress who was somewhat run off her feet.  We found a clean table and sat ourselves.  She brought over the menus and about 15-20 minutes later she finally took our order - torta, quesadilla, and pambazo.  A very simple order with no substitutions.  We waited for a long time with the understanding that the place was clearly understaffed.  (I used to be a waitress and am more than accommodating when I see a waitress struggling to keep up).  We started to notice that the food orders were also coming out very slowly as there was only one person in the kitchen.  After waiting for an hour (I know this because I had to put more money in the parking meter), I finally said to my husband that if our order doesn't come out next, we're leaving.  The next order that came out was served to a table that was sat after us.  I'd had it by that time.  We were in the restaurant for 1hour & 10 minutes and NO FOOD.  SO VERY DISAPPOINTED.  WE WON'T BE BACK."}
{"text":"AUTHENTIC Mexican Restaurant! Best I've had on the St. Clair W. strip. Everything is good but highlights include:  Temales Tacos Platillos Enchiladas"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, and great food, probably the best Mexican restaurant in Toronto. Watch out portions are huge!!!"}
{"text":"The tenoch torta sandwich was amazing!! Definitely cannot finish that in one sitting. We also ordered one  la carnitas taco, guacamole and chips, and the doratos pollo. Hands down my favourite was the sandwich. It's not something you can eat everyday but I'd love to come back and order that again in a month or two. Otherwise , we definitely want to come back to try their other dishes! Maybe we'll have room for dessert next time around ;) @nomsoftoronto"}
{"text":"Probably the mosty authentic Mexican place in the city me thinks. Cool spot-mostly great food-interior is typical south american kitsch"}
{"text":"This is the easiest, shortest review I've ever written: good food, cheap decor, and appalling customer service. I'm talking a 10 minute delay to bring you a beer and a 20 minute delay to bring you the bill. Avoid."}
{"text":"I live right next to you, and you're never open but I finally got to experience the wonder that is Tenoche. The salsa is adequately spicy and you know it's authentic when they dont try to fill up your tacos with lettuce and tomato and other useless fillings. I also had the horacha which was rather sweet and tasted a bit like toothpaste but otherwise, was as expected.  The bistek tacos were flavourful and not dry. I was full the whole day. For $12 this isnt bad but it's obviously not US prices and portions. The main drawbck really is that the wait was kind of long. (I think we were waiting half an hour or more) but the nachos (a given) kept us preoccupied.  Might I add, a cheaper authentic option might be Latin World on St. Clair West and Glenholme"}
{"text":"Really bad taste food, nothing like mexican Oil dripping form tacos and taste so ugly like a left over oil  The mole sauces was also so fake and ugly like the canned one being warm Even Tacos bread had strong flavour of fake ready food with plenty of artificial adding, nothing tasted real except the chopped onions and cilantro.  Very long and bad service."}
{"text":"Look, if you want great Mexican food, come here!!! It's NOT tex-mex!  The only problem is the waiting time after ordering. Be prepared to wait. The Tenoch Tortas is awesome!!! Get it, eat it, and go to sleep.... It will fill you up!!!!  After a great meal, it's been like 30 min since a waiter came by.  I think we can just walk out and they wouldn't even notice that we didn't pay. (Of course we paid)"}
{"text":"Great Great Mexican on St Clair.  I remembered reading the yelp review and my girlfriend and I decided to try it last night.   Great decor with lots of tacky pictures of axtec royalty and brightly coloured walls. My girlfriend is the expert when it comes to Mexican so she ordered the enchilda, and the chorizo tacos. We also split a chicken quesidia.  Everything was amazing with lots of spice but never hot enough to be inedible. The freshness was just great.   Amazing!"}
{"text":"This is definitely one of my favorite restaurants on St Clair!  The menu is great but I'm especially in love with the tortas. You can't go wrong with the Milanesa (veal) or the chicken version but if you haven't eaten in 3 days, The Tenoch sandwich is madness and for someone with a HUGE appetite.   Shopping & Eating on St Clair is always a great excuse to ride the new streetcars too!"}
{"text":"If you are spanish or mexican you get great service here, but us crackers are mostly ignored. It is a closed community. Not recommended."}
{"text":"Mucho YUM!  As some of you may know, I have issues with what constitutes a Mexican restaurant in Toronto. Long story short, most Mexican places are not very authentic. Why? Well, many reasons, but again the simplest factor is that most Mexican food is well, 'pleb food' and the more authentic it is, then the more simple and alien it might seem for North American tastes. Also part of the fault lies on Tex-Mex's popularity and the confusion due to the fact that at least in spirit the two cuisines might seem to overlap a bit.     Thus in Canada, in order to survive, like most restaurants tend to do, they Canadianize their menus. Sure, it might make them more accessible and able to perhaps pay the rent but authenticity suffers.     So first is first, you are not coming here for the upscale ambiance, as the locale is very simple and folksy in a very Mexican way. You will find some Mexican tapestries and posters...which is not a bad thing.   Second, the food is great and tasty. They are also not afraid of providing you enough spice to burn through your taste buds.   Yeah, now that is what I am talking about.   ...There is a certain authenticity achieved when a restaurant allows you to hurt yourself with their food. ;-)  The prices are still a bit high for what you are technically getting if you compare to it other cuisines, like Chinese, Korean or Indian. However, if you are going for authentic, then this place is just great!  Compared to other Mexican restaurant in Toronto they are very reasonable priced and the food is worth the drive/ttc trip to St. Clair West.   You will find many Latin/Mexican customers eating here, which again is a great sign and the vibe of the place is definitely unpretentious, which makes it fun.  It was recommend to me by my Mexican friend Memo and I thank him for it. I recommend it to you too. Also, try to avoid the rice dishes, go for some of the more interesting/spicy (not as in hot)  items in the menu. You won't regret it.   Just don't hurt yourself."}
{"text":"Oh tenoch, how do I say this? I love you but I hate you. I can't live without your chicharron quesadillas, nobody in town that could even come close, your barbacoa and consome makes me believe I'm back at home, your pambazos! Omg your pambazos are great when you dont run out of ingredients and fill them out with random stuff. If it wasn't for your inconsistency and awful service I would say your the best thing that ever happened to toronto. And I mean it!! But for crying out loud stop turning down business, fix your hours and improve your bloody service!!"}
{"text":"This place has been on my radar for a while to check out. We were not disappointed!  The Hubster and I came in for dinner with a craving for Mexican food. We got a couple of beers and he had the Tenoch torta, which was basically every meat in the place stuffed between two giant buns. I had the enchiladas verde, which was chicken breast on a bed of spicy, incredibly fresh tasting sauce and corn tortillas. No problem getting this without dairy. Each of us were only able to eat half of our meals before tapping out. They were just as good the next day.   The prices are really good for the quality and quantity. Service was a bit more relaxed than I like and it took a while to get our meals, but once we did, all was forgiven. I even left my car keys there and on the way back, ran into our server coming after us on the street.   This place has found a pair of fans for life!"}
{"text":"Being far from Mexico it is always difficult to find a place with the flavour, the variety, the service with the right balance of price and quantity.  Tenoch is a restaurant that will be full with Mexicans enjoying what we could only have over there.  Tacos al pastor, quesadillas, pambazos y tamales are very good.  Our surprise was to find as a Saturday special beef tongue tacos! The right \"sazon\" accompanied with an excellent nopalitos salad (cactus).  Bring your favourite Mexican friend and you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I go there every time I feel home sick...  I spoil myself with some guacamole and totopos.   Cry remembering my mom's cook with their pozole and a tecate.On weekends, I can't stop thinking on fixing my hangover with that tender barbacoa. And feel like home with every bite of those authentic cochinita tacos...  On the other hand, my husband is a big eater, so he's put himself in the challenge of finishing the \"Tenoch torta\". He has succeeded, but with a food coma, followed by a \"never again\" (he has ordered it several times). Regular people would be satisfied with half of that specialty!  One of the only things that could be a minus for the place is that you need to be patient, really patient.  The place is run by few people that take their time to give the cooker enough space to accomplish the taste for the food to be \"al dente\".  My advice for a partied Saturday: Call the place when you wake up and you feel your tongue is kind of sticking to your palate, order the barbacoa consome (mmmm), and depending how many of you are dealing with the same situation, order a 1/2 or a 1 k of barbacoa to go. You won't have to wait, just pay and get your hangover potion.  Cheers and happy Holidays!!!"}
{"text":"My cousin lived in Chicago for 10 years and during my first visit, I was kind of surprised about how large the Mexican population is over there. With the large Mexican population comes plenty of authentic Mexican restaurants.  My cousin spotted Tenoch from the TTC and looked it up online. The menu and photos reminded him of some of his favourite spots in Chicago so I decided to take him there for his birthday.  Firstly, I will say this place should get a solid 3.75 stars but I round up to 4 this time because of the value you get in the prices and the portions.  The atmosphere is simple as it looks like they took over the restaurant/bar that was there before and added their own touches of Mexican decor and attire (i,e. flag, sombrero, luchadore mask)  I tried the pesole, horchata, tacos and tamale.  The pesole was really good and so was the horchata. The taco was also pretty good but not any better than tacos from some of the other places in the GTA that I have tried. The tamale was something I had to take home.  It tried some of it there but it wasn't good enough for me to want to stuff myself and I think it was a notch below some of the other tamales that I've tried elsewhere. Where it does beat the others is in its size.  My cousin ordered the Tenoch which is a sandwich the size of a regulation football. He could only eat half of it. He did say that he liked it alot.  When I'm around St. Clair West, I usually go to Stockyards and it is a bit of a trek for me.  Not sure I'd rush to go back as there are some other Mexican restaurants that I've yet to try but if you are in the area, have a large appetite and enjoy Mexican food... this is the place!"}
{"text":"This place is ALWAYS closed, and one time I wanted to have take out because I work near by, and the waiter was rude and told me they don't do take out when they're \"busy\" and didn't even offer to take my order and tell me to come back in one hour or so. Bad service."}
{"text":"The service is the absolute worst here.   The only girl waitress constantly is texting on her phone behind the bar and not looking after her tables.  Was here twice and both times, it takes 45min-1 hour to get your food.  They do not serve ice in their water for some strange reason.  Thye buy their bags of ice individually from the variety store and use it exclusively for the Margaritas and Frozen drinks.  Soda Pop, water, Juice or any soft beverage comes as is with no ice.    Then try paying for your order.  Again anothter 20min ordeal in flagging the texting waitress.  Overall the food is just ok.  Their Tenoche Sandwish is aweful!  Do not waste your money on this.  Tacos and other mexican dishes are good.  Giving this place a 2 our of 5 stars is gracious."}
{"text":"This is a go-to place for takeout for us. The atmosphere/decor leaves a bit to be desired - it's not pretty - but the food is delicious and the servings are ginormous. You can get a chicken mole tamale the size of your head for $4 - usually lasts me two meals, maybe three. Except, a lot of the time they are sold out of tamales, because they're so good they have regulars who come in and buy a dozen to eat all week. It's not the trendy hipster Mexican experience you find downtown, it is authentic all the way."}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican spot in Toronto. Authentic dishes and drinks. If you get the Tenoch Tortas you will need a nap afterwards. The tacos and guacamole are fantastic as well. Service is a bit slow but if you're looking for great Mexican, You've come to the right spot."}
{"text":"Since I live in  the neighborhood and absolutely love Mexican food, this place had been on my radar for quite some time. The first time we went there, the restaurant was packed. So when we went back tonight, we were happy to get a seat right away. Place looked pretty authentic and I was excited to try some good Mexican food. We ordered  guacamole and shrimp tacos and carnitas. None of the dishes were seasoned, the shrimp was way overcooked and the carnitas dry. The service was horrible too. We sat there for at least 20 minutes before the girl came to get our drink order. But she was the only waitress there so can't really blame her. Anyway, my real issue is the food. I think it was the worst Mexican food I've ever had. And if the other reviewers are right about this being a authentic Mexican place then I guess I don't like Mexican food after all."}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere and we have been wanting to try this place since we've moved into the area . Friendly staff. Large menu selection. For our appetizer we ordered the chips with avocado salsa which we enjoyed , followed by the el pastor plate which was served with rice , a few warm tortillas and marinated pork, I ordered a beer and spouse had a can of pop.Little disappointed with the main course ( not so flavourful, portion was so so) and further disappointment with the bill $72 after tip and tax yikes!!!! We will not be returning. But seems like a cool place for having a margherita( not our cup of tea but they looked good being served at the bar)"}
{"text":"Loved the food! Atmosphere needs some work but the food is king. You should try this place."}
{"text":"I wish this place existed a long time ago, let's say my high school days so I could drop by this place during my lunch hour to get some really delicious Mexican cuisine at a reasonable price. A Mexican co-worker of mine at the time highly recommended this place. She told me it served very authentic Mexican dishes and reminded her a lot of home. She told me she goes there a lot with her husband that I actually spotted a photo of them two on Tenoch's website (haha). She suggested I try their shredded roasted chipotle pork ($9), which I ended up getting. The pork was juicy and was smothered with meat sauce but not too soggy. My brother chose an item from their 'most popular dish' menu - the Tenoch sandwich ($15) and a glass of Tamarindo Jarritos ($2.50). I really wanted to try their tamales but it was just too much food to stuff down. The restaurant was filled with a lot of family affairs, you can notice it immediately with the amount of noise that were coming from each table. Service was alright, the waitress was able to explain the best she could in English of the different items they served and the ingredients. She simply thought everything was worth trying, which I must agree but until next time."}
{"text":"I used to be a frequent patron here, but yesterday I went for the first time in some time and I'm left disappointed. First, the service is terribly slow, the girl is moody. Then, the food used to be excellent, now it has gone done quite bad. I ordered the torta ahogada and it was terrible (taste and ingredients). We ordered some tacos on the side and they were very unsavory and the portions are smaller compared to what it used to be before. I'm Mexican, I know it can be hard to replicate some dishes because of the ingredients, but there is an improvement in the Mexican food scene around the city and Tenoch is not keeping it. They forget the premise that simple dishes and good service is better, specially when pretentious taco places are popping up but are popular because they understand they need to be competitive to survive. Better go to Kings Tacos two blocks west to have a real Mexican taco experience (and a cleaner place)."}
{"text":"Sunday barbacoa tacos are king in my agenda! Perfect for a hangover... The service comes with a lamb, rice, chickpeas soup/ broth (garnish with finely chopped onion, cilantro , lime and choice of green or red salsa).... Moist tender morsel of lamb tacos. Its  Non fatty, garlicky yet so delicate in taste. A stack of yellow tortillas soft and fresh... This plate is so worth the wait as service can be a hit or miss as there is only one person attending the restaurant. Also try a chelada with ice. I.. Its a beer _ modelo or corona_with lime, the glass rimmed with salt. Perfect combination. Now Im sure there are perfect tacos out there.. But i hate greasy tacos or overly spiced.  This taco( barbacoa) are served only on Sunday.. But they are light and rich in taste. My mouth is watering just thinking about them, me, this Sunday coming."}
{"text":"***This review is about service, not food.   Called this place two times to make a reservation. 1st time I called at 8pm on a Monday night no one picked up so I was ready to leave a voicemail message. The voicemail was in Spanish and I was waiting for them to either switch to English or mention the name of the restaurant in the Spanish voicemail (wanted to confirm that I called the right place)--which I guess I should have known it was since they were speaking in Spanish.   2nd time I called was on a Wednesday at 7pm, and this time someone picked up the phone and they told me that they do not speak English (they were speaking Spanish). I actually speak Spanish, so I asked for a reservation. At that point I was told that the person in charge of reservations would be in the next day so to call back the following night.   Are you kidding me?! On their website they ask you to call in for a reservation!   Not worth the hassle."}
{"text":"If you're craving *AUTHENTIC* Mexican food, this is your go-to spot. My Mexican hairdresser recommended Tenoch and I'm glad I listened to her recommendation. I've only visited Tenoch once, but I was left with a full tummy and a good impression of the place. It was full of Mexican people, which is a good sign when it comes to ethnic restaurants. Doesn't matter which item on the menu you go with, you will not be disappointed. Your wallet will be thankful too :)  In all honesty, I can't wait to go back and try something else. Their sandwiches look delicious. Hmm, I think I know what I'm gonna order next time."}
{"text":"The food is quite good.  It feels like home cooked Mexican food.  That's a good thing.  However, it sparked a debate amongst the diners what makes for authentic Mexican food.  I made the argument that even if the place seemed more like Mexican home cooking than many other places in the city, it was still not as authentic as I hoped it to be.  I was missing the traditional Mexican flavours and ingredients.  I was expecting bigger, deeper flavours with more heat.  The decore leaves much to be desired.  The drink menu is limited."}
{"text":"Very authentic delicious tacos and delicious chilaquiles! Along with King's tacos, this is the best Mexican food in Toronto"}
{"text":"Service: Every time I've tried to go on a Saturday evening, I've been turned away with warnings of \"we don't know when a table will be free\" and \"if you sit at the bar, it could be a 40 minute wait for food.\" Fair and honest but I can't seem to get there during the right window of time to get a seat!  Food:  If their food wasn't so damned delicious, I'd be more upset. I don't mind waiting for food this good and I know they're making it to order. Just make sure to get a starter to share so you're not watching your date eat while you wait for your own meal. Portions are more generous, tastier and cheaper than any of the places on Bloor.   Go on a weeknight and you won't regret it!   If you're there on a Saturday and can't get a table, Tita La Guanaca just west at 1028 St. Clair always has a spot. Salvadorian, not Mexican but their tamales and pupusas are wonderful."}
{"text":"Hand written sign on the front door saying they're closed. Management wasted the time and energy of 5 people. Website says they're open till 10 yelp says 6 and no updates on any of their directories or social media profiles. For shame. Not coming back."}
{"text":"I've never seen so many Mexican people in one room in Toronto, which was a good sign from the get go. Their menu has authenticity up the wazoo, with some added fun favours like the *Muppet shot.   The tacos, the quesadillas, the pambazo, the sauces and the beers are all exactly what you'd get at a casual restaurant in Mexico, and it's so. darn. delicious. I can't do it justice with descriptors, so I suggest you peep my pics and let your mouth water and then come on in and give it a try.   If you have a big group, I recommend ordering family style, and be prepared for it to take a while. It's a small place with only a few employees and it's always packed, so it's not their fault, but it can be a little annoying when you're starving.   *The Muppet Shot is tequila and 7up. They smash it on the bar for you and order you to chug. It's warm, weird and I will be serving them at my next party."}
{"text":"The best Mexican food I've had in the GTA. The Tortas!! The Tamales!! The Micheladas!! All amazing. It's not the most beautiful place, and it's kinda in a weird part of town to get to, but it is all totally worth it for the food. DELICIOUS!"}
