{"text":"I am a reluctant pescetarian, so eating in this restaurant is a bit difficult as the smell of BBQ waft into the dining room.  However their fish dishes do them justice.  For the vegetarians out there, there do not have much to choose from but their Mac&Cheese is sinfully good, it's rich, cheesy and goey the way real Mac&Cheese should be - the whole time I'm eating it I'm thinking I should stop but I look down to see a completely empty plate.  While it would be nice to see some more non meat items on the menu, I get why they wouldn't and there are sufficient items to please my pescetarian self.  The Smokehouse is a carnivore's dream, I can only imagine the crowds in the winter when it's a bit more difficult to BBQ at home.   Looking forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"I've been here twice to dine and it's always a wonderful dining experiencing! The ambiance is warm and welcoming, the staff are very friendly.   The food which is important has been consistently delicious. A must is their duck confit sandwich OMG so good. They also have the quarter chicken which is smoked with a delicious BBQ sauce. Overall, a wonderful meal!  Definitely a hidden gem- too bad they are not in my end of the city!"}
{"text":"The food is pretty great... Service not so great. It's a local place and caters to its local clients but if your not one of those.... Be ready for a loud waiter who doesn't hear well and assumes what you said. Sad cause I would go back otherwise. Manage your service expectations and you'll be fine. Place is charming and cozy."}
{"text":"Really good food. I had the burger with an addition of pulled pork, which is very good. The burger itself was a little overcooked,  however still tasted great. My wife had the mac and cheese which was also delicious. It seemed that there was only one server, who was very helpful but the service overall was a little slow. Will definitely go back to try the ribs."}
{"text":"Went for dinner on Sunday. Atmosphere was warm and welcoming. We were greeted and told we could grab a seat anywhere. The window bench at the front had colourful throw cushions and welcomed us with open arms. Our server was incredibly nice and knowledgeable. I had the 1/4 Chicken/Rib smoked special with mash and sauted kale upon recommendation and was not disappointed. My friend had the Mac & Cheese with the chicken wings. The M&C was incredible as were the wings....they disappeared fairly quickly. I would certainly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"I have to admit, the name of the place could be misleading for those that may partake in smoke as in the 420 lingo but certainly catchy if you may have the munchies.  we went on the rainy Wednesday so service and wait for things was not an issue with us as like other previous comments before me. I am naturally a picky Eater so much even the aroma of the restaurant is very neutral as oppose to other southern bbq places that I have been to in Canada and in the US. The decor was clean and cozy but again it doesn't have a typical  feel other then the wooden seats.  we ordered the fish special of the day and ribs. what I did like was the offer of dry rub and on the side. coleslaw the super vinegar not creamy base. wild rice with spicy jerk fish was a nice combo.  we shared a bottle of wine and the dessert called \"Oh my, Henry\". yummy.  Would I go again? Maybe,  service was nice. However,  I like my real southern BBQ in the south with southern love."}
{"text":"PARTIAL REVIEW Service:  -Ah, service. This is the sticky one. Our colourful French server was both boisterous and hilarious. Flip-flopping from outrageous loud jokes (like comparing to my photo-taking to that of \"Japanese tourists\" - her words, not mine) and matter-of-fact tone (like telling my sister she couldn't have the potato salad with such impassivity we thought it was sarcasm) left us constantly entertained. You either love this act or hate it, but the affirmative will become her regulars and dine at 420 just to chat with her. - As previously mentioned, on the Friday night we dined, the place was absolutely slammed with I believe about 3 servers running the restaurant and bar. So our server did her best to be attentive, but there were times I got the sense she was feeling a wee-bit scrambled. For instance, she brought by side plates for our appetizers, yet only set three of them down, heading back to the kitchen with the other two not to return until I pointed it out (and of course, she was confused why she brought them back). Drink service was also hit and miss. We waited a little while with empty glasses on our table before being asked about refills, and even when they arrived, the empties were not retrieved (which I found weird). I also never got a soda I ordered, but alas, at least our water glasses were refilled as required, so I always did had something to drink. -Now, the bad. The service was slow to say the least, with the meal taking an entire 2  1/2 hours to complete. To put that in perspective, last weekend I enjoyed a luxurious tasting menu in less time. Our server was greatly apologetic and appreciative of our patience, but ultimately, the kitchen staff was just too small to accommodate a full house. What this meant was we waited about 60 minutes for our appetizers, another 50 for our mains and about 15 for our desserts- one of which they comp'd to apologize for the delay. There was also clearly some miscommunications going on, as about 20 minutes after we had received and eaten our appetizers, another round of the same ones came by. I hope they didn't throw those out!  FOOD: Fried Forest Mushrooms ($5) Herbes de Provence, Malt Vinegar  One of our favourite dishes of the night. These didn't really look or taste much like mushrooms, to be honest, but they were crispy and light, and seasoned flawlessly with aromatic herbs and flakey salt. The malt vinegar side was pretty irrelevant, to be honest (why not a seasoned aioli?), but the mushrooms themselves could hold their own.  Smoked Chicken Wings with Ale Sauce ($12 / 1 lb)  We definitely all loved these wings. They were very meaty and juicy, with a discernable, but not overwhelming smoky flavour. I also really liked the sweet acidic ale sauce, even though I thought could have scaled back on the amount.  Jalapeno Corn Bread ($5/ piece) x 2  This was disappointing, especially after tasting Trish Gill's fabulous version at the Dock Ellis. While the juxtaposition of the sweet whole kernel corn and the spicy jalapeno made for good flavour, the bread itself was really dry. I also really didn't understand the side \"dip\"- what was that? Honestly, I tasted it, then tasted it again, and again, and all I could detect was neutral oil. If you're going to keep it simple, at least give us some melted salted butter for a little kick of flavour.   Smoked Meat Sandwich ($12) With Spicy Beer Mustard, Slaw and Pickle  The meat was moist and fatty with a solid smoke flavour that was nicely complimented by the spicy beer mustard. My problem with the sandwich, however, was that the bread wasn't pulling its weight. The juices soaked through the flimsy slices which made eating with ones hands an impossible task.  Reuben Sandwich ($12) With Slaw and Fries  Pretty much the same analysis as the aforementioned sammy except the soggy bread was even more offensive with the addition of the sauerkraut. Actually, the minute my father picked up his sandwich, the bread nearly disintegrated in the palm of his hand. It also could have used a little grill or griddle action- both to add a nice caramelized crust and to better melt the cheese.   Fries (Side with Reuben)  Get the fries, my friends. These puppies were hand-cut super crispy little nuggets of golden joy just waiting to be devoured by a hungry lady or gent. The best side dish by far.  Pulled Pork ($12) With Slaw and Sweet Potato Side  Good but not great. Like the aforementioned beef, the pork had a nice aromatic smoke flavour, but was a bit dry and was served luke warm.  It also was more \"chopped\" than tenderly pulled. The bun, on the other hand, was a home run. Buttery exterior and crispy cut sides and soft and cushiony within. Yum.  Duck Confit Burger ($13)  This was the special of the night, and it sounded interesting enough. I was honestly expecting a regular burger patty with perhaps a little pulled duck on top, but instead was brought a solid patty of pressed together duck confit....."}
{"text":"Excellent portions, great quality, and overall very happy!  Well worth a visit when in Cabbage-Town."}
{"text":"I went to 420 on Valentine's Eve with my mom. Overall, we had a pleasant evening. The service team on the floor worked well together for the most part. I kept in mind that they are still a new restaurant and maintaining communication isn't going to he fine tuned right away. I was impressed with the service that we received. The  bar tender let us know how long the seating wait would take and checked in with us during our wait which was good to see. Once we were seated, we saw our server right away who was also attentive and timely with her service. It was great to see the hands on involvement of the owners of the place as well.   Food:  I ordered the fish and chips and my mom ordered the Jerk Pickerel. We both enjoyed the food and found it quite tasty. The fish was cooked perfectly and flavourful. For dessert we ordered the O'Henry Ice Cream. By far the best home made ice cream I have ever had. One thing I would suggest is having a vegetarian entree.   I definitely will be going back to 420."}
{"text":"I had the smoked turkey bacon club with pouting and it delicious. The service was great and the look and feel of the restaurant is very cozy. I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"My friends and I meet up at various restaurants once a month to regroup and catch up. This months venue was 420 Smokehouse. Don't let the name fool you. This has nothing to do with marijuana and is not based off of an Amsterdam 'coffee shop'. This is a legit BBQ Smokehouse.   My fiancé and I decided to try the best of everything by getting the 2 person meat platter. It came with pulled pork, smoked meat, ribs, southern fried chicken wings, fries and bread. It was delicious! The flavor from the smoker made a huge difference. It gave all the meat a tender and juicy flavor. Our friends also got the ribs, pulled porked sandwich and the smoked meat sandwich...there weren't even crumbs left on the plate!   Our server was genuinely kind and made sure a beer cup never went empty.   Would definitely recommend this place to others!"}
{"text":"Incredible food, great prices.  Wednesday is rib night--a half rack of ribs is $15 with fries/coleslaw, plus pints and glasses of the house wine are $5.  (Unfortunately, they don't let you swap the sides for any of the others on the menu when you order the special.)  Still worth it, especially given how delicious the ribs are.    Service was great--the food came fast, and when my dining companion and I seemed to be done, our server delivered takeout boxes without us even having to ask for them, but there was no pressure to pay up and leave at all.  In fact, we sat at our empty table for ages after we ate with no pressure to turn over the table at all.  I asked to hear the dessert list and almost couldn't choose from the list of house-made desserts. I settled on the \"Oh my Henry\", a scoop of house-made peanut butter ice cream served alongside a slab of chocolate mousse drizzled with salted caramel and roasted peanuts.  Absolutely incredible--I'm still thinking about it!  The crowd at the bar was friendly and welcoming, too--I showed up a bit earlier than my friend, but the four people at the bar (all of whom seemed like regulars) chatted with me easily, so the wait didn't feel like a big deal at all.  Definitely worth a return visit.  (Maybe several.)"}
{"text":"Great place.Limited menu but good choices. Smoked oysters are a nice fresh starter. Friendly servers (nice to hear French being spoken in Cabbage Town). Simple decor, my only suggestion is to put a curtain or divider so that the harsh neon light of the kitchen pick-up area does not detract from the soothing dining area atmosphere ."}
{"text":"Solid BBQ options with yummy sides, really delicious brunch, and very friendly wait staff.  The coffee could've been better but with enough coffee options down the street I won't fault them for that.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"$15 for a Rubin is too dear. Especially when it is made wrong , rye, meat, sour kraut and mustard. Not that hard. My fries came  tepid at best. Also a pickle would have been a nice treat. I won't goto 420 again"}
{"text":"I am so thrilled to have come across this east-end gem! Lovely service and excellent food. I started with the small mac & cheese appetizer - honestly, I could have probably stopped there - it was heavenly. I then had the southern style chicken wings, which are served with sriracha and honey. The wings tasted smoked before they were battered and fried - SOOO GOOD. Capped off my meal with the Oh Henry - chocolate, peanut butter ice cream and smoked peanuts - a delicious combination. The staff are super friendly and sweet, which is extremely important to me. I will definitely make 420 Smokehouse a regular stop. You should too! Plus, they had the Jays game on in there - as if I thought it couldn't get any better."}
{"text":"Great service and delicious bbq burger with cheddar and smoked bacon accompanied by the most amazing fries (I think they may have been double fried).   Listen. I was actually finishing my fries while writing this review and the kind waiter fellow passed by to clear my plate away and I grabbed another fry and growled at the poor guy. THATS HOW GOOD THIS WAS. lol, The burger was so flavorful I initially didnt think I could pull through and finish the fries...and then the cro magnum growl happened haha. Definitely will be back!!"}
{"text":"Our smoked meat sandwiches came with an incredibly small serving of meat that managed to be mostly fat. The service was quick and the fries were good. When we told our server about the food she said\"sorry\" and that was that. Mostly a complete waste of more than $30 for two sad sandwiches"}
{"text":"I went to 420 Smokehouse for dinner one evening and I really appreciated the quality of service of this place.  I ordered the 1/4 chicken & ribs dinner which came with kale and mashed potato as well as a extra side of jalapeno cornbread.  The chicken was tender, well marinated and smoky.  It definitely came out as fresh as it could get.  The mashed potato was very creamy and kale was a surprisingly good blend of flavour with sweet cranberry sauce.  But what I actually liked the most was the service.  The waitress came out to tell us that the cornbread wasn't that fresh so the kitchen didn't really want to serve it to us.  I appreciated their honesty.  So we changed to a poutine instead.  At first it was too salty so we asked if that was how it usually tasted and any possibility to have it less salty.  The server apologized and took it back.  We were brought a fresh plate of poutine with much less salt.  It really spoke friendliness and professionalism of this restaurant.  I would go back and recommend to others."}
{"text":"We shared a whole rack of tasty dry-rub ribs, good coleslaw (no mayo), tasty cornbread. And a really good Caesar salad. Cheerful and accommodating staff. Reasonable price for a meal that made us very full ($50 including tip, no booze)"}
{"text":"Had been wanting to go here for awhile and the wait was definitely more than worth the wait! Loved all the food, especially the mac n cheese - it was to die for amazing! Would go back to simply just eat the mac n cheese. Nice, chill place to have a good dinner."}
{"text":"We had the 2 person meat sampler and it was fantastic.  The ribs were large and juicy, the wings were perfectly done and the pulled pork and brisket were amazing.  All this meat for $30 and it also came with fries, coleslaw and rye bread!  Not only is it one of the best smoked BBQ platters in the city, it's the most reasonably priced. The taste and complexity of the meat, and the presentation of the meal shows the top notch effort the chef's put into the food here. Highly recommended, you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Loved this place! Very cool comfortable atmosphere with great food!   Very reasonably priced menu - for drinks and food - especially by Toronto standards   Tried the Smoked Caesar cocktail which was abit of a risk that unfortunately did not pay off. Not for me... Barman was very knowledgable about all drinks so I easily swapped for a craft beer which was more to my tastes.   Very large portion sizes which was slightly intimidating, especially when the waiter didn't appear to believe me that I actually did really enjoy my meal!   Overall enjoyable experience - will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"One of the best wings that I have ever eat. The jerk sauce gives it a good kick , spicy and succulent. Slaw was pretty good as well."}
{"text":"The food here is more than decent but not outstanding. We tried the macaroni and cheese appetizer, which is actually a small bowl of rigatoni swimming in cheese, but was quite tasty. We were served by an attentive and friendly French Canadian hostess who looks somewhat like Mrs Roper from Three's Company. I had the smoked turkey club which was good and my friend enjoyed his Pulled Pork sandwich. But both our sides were lacklustre. The kale was just boiled to tastelessness and was combined with far too much onion. The wild rice and kidney beans was also just passable. I will try this place once more when I want comfort food in this very immediate area and the line-up at House on Parliament is too crazy. This is not among the best new bbq joints in Toronto but it is a welcome addition to the local scene."}
{"text":"The BBQ at this new Cabbagetown gem is simply outstanding! I went there by chance on Canada Day and had their grilled octopus, spinach salad and full rack of ribs with corn bread and kale as sides. It was so good that I went back in the same week and added the smoked chicken on my next visit. The ribs are flavourful and tender and the chicken is amazingly moist and tender and the smokey flavour is perfect. Whoever has the BBQ hand in the kitchen knows what he/she is doing. I have been to a number of BBQ joints in the city like Stockyards and Barque on Roncy and this place has way better BBQ.  The service is extremely friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Been wanting to check it out for a while and finally have. The food is good and every time I go back, I try something new. They have drink specials and drink/meal combos. The staff is very nice and it's a great spot added to the neighborhood."}
{"text":"I wish I could make up the name to this place, I mean the pot-humor basically writes itself,  Cheech and Chong couldn't have come up with a better name themselves. That is to say if these guys got the reference (shocked look on my face). I mean you hear the name and you would THINK this is basically a head shop where you can buy bongs and other smoking supplies... nope, it's a BBQ joint (rim shot).  If I had a business at 420 Any street there isn't a smokers chance in a marathon that I wouldn't make it all about pot culture or at the very least something that is an ode to Bill and Ted, Cheech and Chong and Bob Marley. Nope this spot had to go ahead and be a swanky little bar/BBQ smoke-shop. Dammit, nd what's worse? It's incredible. It's actually amazing how few reviews they have when they're food speaks such huge volumes, then again they're on the east end of the city in an area vastly under explored in my opinion.  Another easy idea would be to have a restaurant all about typical munchies that stoners want to eat and have it at a 420 address. I mean come on! Nope, this place just HAD to be different and make some of the best BBQ in the city. The four of us shared in a massive rack of ribs that claimed to be St.Louis in style (a bit of citrus and very sticky sweet). It was too big for a started, a side or anything really, just huge! I figured for my main I would go the \"healthier\" route and have a 1/2 smoked chicken with kale greens and corn bread. I figured the chicken would be swiss chalet in size, wrong again, this one half was the equivalent of 1 whole BBQ chicken from costco. Unlike the costco version 420 offers a succulent meaty bird with very few bones, almost non-existent in fact. I cut into the chicken and juice popped out like I had burst a water balloon! The seasoning and smokey flavour had penetrated deep into the meat and for once I didn't need a drop of sauce to moisten my bird.   The only drawback to this spot was their bar was a bit lacking in my opinion. They had a fair variety of craft beers but when I asked to see a cocktail menu the server looked stumped. She said \"like a caesar or a rum and coke\". How can you be a restaurant in Toronto right now and not only not have classic cocktails (old Fashioned, Manhattan, martini, etc) but not even know what they are? Egad folks!  Drink faux pas aside, I was wrong about a lot of things I presumed about 420 Smokehouse. More wrong than I've been in awhile - I couldn't be happier to be wrong  Eatcrest Out!"}
{"text":"We went here on a weekday and it was a fantastic find. The ribs are delicious and the owner is a friendly guy. I would recommend getting the fries or the cornbread but also don't be afraid to venture out a little and try the kale salad with the ribs.  If you don't feel like getting ribs, the fried chicken is also delicious. I will be returning here for chicken and waffles!"}
{"text":"Um....it was not bad.  Went here for dinner on a Friday night with a small # of people.  The food was good and the whole experience was just ok.  Food: 3/5, I got the pulled pork sandwich because the smoked meat doesn't come with fries. We also got the nachos which were pretty good.  Service: 2/5, this was meh since the waitress didn't know much and kept making mistakes like bringing wrong sides on food, and unable to tell us stuff on the menu  Ambiance: 2/5, it's dark and not the best seating for a mid-level restaurant.  Price: 2/5, about $20+ per person and near parliament which is.... Meh"}
{"text":"All home made and a log burning smoker on the premises, hence the smokey smell coming in  So I had the smoked Wings with the dry rub and the crispy skin and moist insides with that real smokiness flavor was just awesome  Fries were done just right  Now they had the best coleslaw I have had in a long long time and they are home made.  The rest of the crew enjoyed their smoked burgers with a wonderful kale n cranberry jam side   So yeah very authentic and smoked for real which will satisfy the discriminating purist.   If I am gonna go for  bbq then I want the real sh#t and these guys have it in spades st Louis style  Blown away by the oh Henry dessert with home made peanut butter ice cream...so so good  Now for 420 fan club you may wish to partake the herbal religion at Hot Box in Kensington cuz this ain't the place but there is an alleyway beside the restaurant to discreetly light up among the homeless guys  Only regret is the soul town motown soundtrack background music ........not a fan......so that begs the question? What's appropriate bbq music? SOUTHERN ROCK  oh Yeah"}
{"text":"I had been planning to write this review for some time now as I've been to The 420 Smokehouse a handful of times for both brunch and Dinner.    I was originally drawn by the name and I thought it was hilarious when I spoke to the owner and she mentioned that it was all a coincidence and she had no idea of the implications of the name of the restaurant.   This place serves good food and has a very inviting atmosphere with simple decor and very friendly wait staff.      The pulled pork is great and not overly saucy.  I find it strange that I would say this but the smoked meat poutine while good, is swimming in way too much gravy and I wish it had just a touch more smoked meat on top.  Every time I had gone they raved about their burger and I finally tried it last night... I was underwhelmed and won't be ordering it again as it was under seasoned .  I wished I had ordered the smoked meat sandwich instead as it is simply fantastic.  Their 420 Caesar salad is quite good and they do it proper with a touch of anchovy paste from what I can taste.   Also their grilled octopus appetizer was rather delicious I just wish there was more of it on the plate.  I have been there a few times for brunch and their menu changes slightly every time.  If you get a chance to try their fried chicken and waffles or their Turkey sausage and cheddar biscuits with fried egg and gravy you are in for a treat.   I do find it  very strange that they do not offer refills on coffee.  Granted they give you a huge mug but personally I would rather have smaller mugs with refills so that I don't have a cold coffee by the end of my brunch.    Also, I wish they would bring back the deep fried mushrooms. They were awesome"}
{"text":"Came here for brunch on a Saturday at around 11:30am and the place was empty.  Our service was polite, if a little bit slow. We started with some of the spiked drinks ($6.50 each).  We tried the Ski Jump, which is hot chocolate with Peppermint Schnapps and Frangelico, except they were out of Frangelico so we had it with just peppermint.  It was okay.  Very sweet.  We also tried the Spanish coffee (with Kahlua and Brandy) and the Irish coffee (with Irish whiskey and Irish Mist).  Both were strong, and were topped with a generous serving of whipped cream and shavings of chocolate.  I ordered the smoked chicken and waffles ($12), which was not very impressive.  The plate had two large waffles and two pieces of breaded chicken breast.  The serving was large, but the chicken was kind of dry and uninspired.  It was also a bit disappointed that it was all white meat, as I was hoping for some dark meat (though this may be a little bit my fault, since I didn't ask).  One of my friends ordered the Breakfast Burger ($12), which is a 4 oz. beef patty with bacon, cheddar cheese, a fried egg, and homefries.  He enjoyed it, and actually couldn't even finish all of it.  My husband ordered the \"420 Breakfast\" which includes 2 eggs any style (he had them poached), with bacon, lightly smoked sausage, home fries & toast ($11).  The eggs came out a big soft for him, but everything else was fine.  My other friend ordered the smoked meat poutine (large, for $15).  This was okay overall.  The smoked meat was DELICIOUS, but everyone felt that there was a distinct lack of cheese, and the fries seemed to have been tossed in gravy a while before serving, since they were not very crispy.  There also wasn't as much gravy as we were hoping there would be.  The little bits of smoked in the poutine were so good though, I asked if I could order a plate of this alone.  Our waiter asked the kitchen and then told me that a plate would be $8, which was fine by me.  It was delicious.  Fatty, full bodied smokey flavor that just melted in the mouth.  Perfection.  This was the best part of the meal.  The overall meal was just average, but the smoked meat is delicious.  I probably would only come back for the meat, but I don't think I'd do brunch here again.  Other things to note: They do have free wifi.  Also street parking was fairly easy to find.  And the bathroom is clean."}
{"text":"Meh.....I had nice service. The sautéed kale and fries were both good. The ribs were just ok and their 'wellington' BBQ is odd and not for me. By reading yelp reviews about BBQ in TO, I can tell it's a wasteland in terms of finding truly good BBQ.  And 420 doesn't dispel that.  Please give me options other than a '2 person platter' for sampling multiple types of your meat.  And please give a 'normal' BBQ sauce to go with your house special because yours is not good.  I might go back to try a different meat, but I doubt it."}
{"text":"First time we went there, Saturday noon, place was empty But is nice and cozy. Nice waitress, very pleasent and chatty she even mention she was new and was not fully familiar with the menu but if we have any questions she will be happy to check with the kitchen! Extra point for the Smoke house. I ordered the turkey smocked club with a side of poutine. The side was a very good portion and the gravy and cheese were really nice. Sandwich ohhh dear what a disapointment, made out of 3 slices of toasted wonder whole weat bread, smoked deli turkey, lettuce tomatoe, butter and in the bottom more butter lettuce tomatoe and bacon, I could feel some smokines in tye meat but overall, no taste and tye bread super dry. Hubby got the benedict eggs with smoked pork on waffles. He said Eggs were not poached they were cooked over easy, the meat and waffles were very nice but not together did not work bcs both were sweet, so it made the whole thing really really sweet. The hollaindese was really good. We were expecting more from this place for the food and price, service is nice oh yes and the washrooms are beautiful. Oh well there is still more places to visit in cabbadge town :(."}
{"text":"So there is a place at No. 420 Parliament Street called 420 Smokehouse. Great idea. Blaze up!...  ...the grill, that is. As intriguing and attractive the punny name may be, it does sound misleading as 420 Smokehouse isn't smokin' filled with foodie hipsters nor hip decor, nor crazy top chef-grade cooking that attracts foodies like a 420 rally attracts stoned activists. That is because 420 Smokehouse is more like a family diner than Toronto's newest must-try smoked meat house. The simple decor speaks to its accessible appeal; it does not scream damn-right Texan barbecue house like it would elsewhere.   Which is not a bad thing. I wouldn't want a lineup of carnivorous foodies running along to the laneway here. But at the same time, I wouldn't want people to not know there is good food here at this end of Cabbagetown. As I have experienced, 420 is as welcoming to a family dinner sitdown as it is to a small group of soccer fans at their bar, staring with intensity at the TV, screaming, \"No No! Ronaldo, Ronaldo! Get the ball in! Get it out of there! Yes, GOOOOOOOLLL! Yes yes!,\" beside a family trying to quietly enjoy a meal. I guess we were the bratty kids at the diner. (By the way, go Deutschland!)  An 8oz burger patty is pretty big, and for $12, you can indulge in their \"420 burger,\" a well-charred chunk of big beef goodness topped with bacon strips. I enjoyed it much, even in the simplicity of its clean appearance.   As the name implies, 420 specialize in smoking anything that moves. (Haha.) Their menu isn't limited to just beef, chicken wings and ribs, though their chicken dinner sure looks good, and they also have a $18-ish chicken and ribs special. Jerked pickerel sounded intriguing to my friend (\"Smoked and fried pickerel is awesome, but jerked? Gotta try that!\"). They didn't have the pickerel that night, sadly, so he opted for pulled pork sandwich ($12) instead. He was quite impressed by the flavor.  Service is generally pleasant, though could use more tweaking to escape the new restaurant jitters. They will own up to their mistakes from what I have seen; these two guys beside me got free drinks for their not-thoroughly cooked chickens. All in all, this is a decent addition to Cabbagetown, an area that could use a few more great eateries. Just hope nobody here takes the name literally."}
{"text":"I was craving BBQ yesterday and kept passing this place when traveling to/from work so it was time to try it out.   I came here with 2 friends and with very few reviews (they opened up in January I believe), everything on the menu was fair game.   What we ordered:  - fish and chips:   3 generous pieces of fish and thick cut fries with one of the best tasting tartar sauce we had in a while. It was chilled with hints of dill and lemon zest to give it that refreshing taste. 4/5  - Korean sweet & sour ribs with kale as a side  The flavor was tasty and not too powering but the ribs were dry and felt over cooked. Was chewing quite a bit.  I never had kale before but it made a good impression. It was well dressed and the cranberry sauce made it that much better. 2/5  - St. Louis ribs (dry rub) with smoked meat poutine as side  Similar to the Korean ribs and didn't feel like there was a lot of meat.  The poutine was good but the smoked meat... Damn!  Was very tempted to order a smoked meat sandwich. 3/5  Service was great. The waitress was very friendly and considerate. My friend asked for more napkins for a runny nose and as soon as the waitress realized what he needed it for, she brought over a box of kleenex! Wow!   *Note* The ribs and chicken comes with a choice of $5 side. If you want to get the more expensive sides, let your waitress know that you'll pay the difference. She was hesitant when we said we wanted the poutine as a side to the ribs.   Smoked meat sandwich, wait for me!"}
{"text":"Strongly suggest the SAMPLER PLATTER for 2. Nice mix of ribs, smoked meats, wings, fries... Too much salt on fries, otherwise really good! Nice early father's day meal. Need to get the AC on, too warm inside."}
{"text":"i went there friday night with my partner and 2 other friends, the service was very good, the lady who serve us speak french, super friendly and she was very funny. the dry rub rib was so good, is not the fell off the bone kind which i am not a big fan of. Their ribs are so flavorful and you can taste the smokeyness. We also order the southern chicken wings, they just taste like homemade. The kale with cranberry is excellent, compliment the ribs perfectly. I would go back in a heartbeat. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Friendly service, huge portions, & it won't break the bank.   Went for brunch. I had the chicken and waffles and my husband had the pulled pork eggs benedict. I think we would have happily swapped choices, but I couldn't really fault the meals. The chicken was crispy and moist, and the eggs Benedict was delightfully salty and oozed with flavour. Both were served on waffles, which were unfortunately very doughy and dense. I like mine light, crispy and fluffy. We definitely could have shared one meal. My hubby is a big eater and he couldn't even manage. I'd definitely go back, but I'd cut the cost in half and share a meal."}
{"text":"I have wanted to try this place for quite some time now and finally got the opportunity to try it.  I would give this place 4.5 stars.    The only complaint I had was that the food took longer than expected, especially considering there were only a couple of tables without food (including us).  I know the menu warns you about a 20min wait for the ribs, but we waited longer than that.  I'm sure you want to hear about the good stuff now though! The food was excellent.  The southern fried chicken wings were large, tender and juicy.  You could really taste the smokeyness.  The fries were amazing, so crispy and fresh.  The mac and cheese was also great.  I loved the panko crust.  My date and I shared a large for a starter and it was huge.  We probably could have shared a small.  My friend got the dry ribs which looked really juicy.  I will probably get them next time.  I also like how you can have a dry or sauced version of the ribs.  I prefer dry but my friend likes saucy.  The jalapeno cornbread was great (just a hint of jalapeno, and not spicy which I like) and I liked that it came with melted butter.  While I enjoyed the burger, there were other things on the menu that were much better.  The prices were really good too, especially for the portion sizes.  Just the right amount.  The decor was pretty and spacious."}
{"text":"Ordered a half rack of ribs with the ale sauce and a side of slaw for pickup.   The ribs were excellent. I've been ordering ribs from a number of places around downtown Toronto since I moved here trying to find great ribs for a reasonable price. These are the best so far! I personally would love to have them fall off the bone a bit easier, but the taste on these was incredible."}
{"text":"Just to clarify for all of you who may have googled 420...this is a restaurant, and only a restaurant with a street number of 420.  I'm not even sure they owners are aware of the double entendre. ;)  Ok, so I really wanted to like this place and was quite excited to try it, but I just had my first meal here and left feeling a bit disappointed.  I'm being generous with 3 stars as this place is still fairly new, and I want to give them a chance.  The food was quite a mixed bag.    The FOOD (2.5 stars):  Between my friend and I we got a nice assortment of offerings: ***420 Smoked Meat Sandwich ($12):  The sandwich on the whole was fairly successful in terms of the smoked meat itself with a nice bit of whole grain mustard.  The bread, however, was not up to the challenge....the plain white bread instantly began falling apart.  This needs a heartier bread to contain it.  Unfortunately, the side of coleslaw was utterly inedible.  A violent salt explosion seemed to have taken place in the kitchen resulting in the saltiest thing I've ever had on a plate in a restaurant.  I pointed it out to the server who went back and tasted it and agreed.  ***Pulled Pork Sandwich ($12): The pulled pork was pretty average.  On its own it was rather bland without any BBQ sauce...also lukewarm in temperature.  The BBQ sauce on offer seems to be Hoisin sauce straight out of a jar (as sickly sweet as it is) perhaps spiced up with just a little bit of added heat.  The combo of BBQ sauce and pork was edible, but my friend didn't enjoy it much.  ***Jalapeno Corn Bread Side ($5): This was by far the most successful item of the night.  A delicious light and fluffy cornbread which had a pleasant, but not overpowering heat.  The portion side was pretty tiny for $5 though...not enough to share really.  ***Duck Confit Sandwich:  This was a special of the night, but I didn't try it.  I love duck confit, but again it came with Hoisin sauce.  This place needs to step up its game and make its own BBQ sauce if it really wants to be a smokehouse.  As we were leaving another customer ran up to us to ask what we thought of our meal.  He just wanted to share how much he disliked this sandwich, as the meat was terribly dry.  That's not a good sign if a stranger wants to commiserate about how bad his food was.  The SERVICE (2.5 stars):  We had a friendly Quebecois hostess who seemed to be serving the entire restaurant.  I pointed out the coleslaw disaster.  She and the chef apparently went to the kitchen and confirmed it.  I was trying to offer constructive feedback, and the appropriate response would have been to either offer a replacement or take the other side dish off our bill.  They did neither and when clearing our plates should have noticed that my friend and I both had our mounds of coleslaw 95% intact.  There were a lot of delays to service and some general confusion.  It's not really running smoothly yet...I wouldn't come here in a rush.  The DRINKS (3.5 stars): They have a decent and fairly priced wine list.  I quite enjoyed the Valpolicello which was around $21 for a 1/2 Liter.  For some reason the whole bottle of wine is way more than the 1/2 liter...I'm confused.  The beer list is Ontario macro-micro standards (Beau's, Wellington's, Steamwhistle, etc.)...no standouts for me.  I do find the wine list to have a nice variety and reasonable prices, especially at the 1/2 liter size.  No cocktails available.  The AMBIANCE:  It's nice and cozy.  I quite liked the window seat.  Warm.  Nice volume levels and real candles.    OVERALL, I left on the disappointed side.  The food was quite the mixed bag and how they handled the problem and service didn't inspire confidence.  I'm going to give them some time to shake out the bugs and try it again in a few months.  2.5 stars, rounded up to 3."}
{"text":"I feel like writing a review for this place is like letting out the local secret.  As much as I don't want a huge line-up of hipsters clogging up my new favourite joint, I think that they really deserve the acknowledgement.  This is a much welcomed attention to Cabbagetown.  On this one particular day that we went to try 420 Smokehouse they had a barbecue setup outside and were giving away free samples!  On Sunday night they had a special for ribs and chicken and a side.  I thought that sounded like a bit much so I opted for the $12 pulled pork sandwich.  It was the best pulled pork sandwich I've ever had and even the fries were impressive.  I don't usually have high expectations for the fries, but damn, don't hesitate to get the fries.  My date got the rib and chicken special and it was a decent portion but not ginormous as I had expected.  The special came with a dessert that he generously shared with me.  It looked like a chocolate bar, and it was divine.  I'm not a huge sweets fan, but yes thumbs up to the dessert too, which again really impressed me for it being a barbecue restaurant.    I saw that they had a brunch menu, and I came back for take-out brunch.  Had the waffles, eggs benedict with pulled pork and maple syrup.  I had friendly service both times."}
{"text":"Amazing place with friendly, very accommodating staff. Very clean with a wonderful laid back home feel. Decor seems to be new but is country. Great service and delicious southern comfort food. The meat is of an extremely high quality. Would definitely recommend for BBQ. Feels very homemade"}
{"text":"Love their wings. On the nights that they have special smoked oysters, that's a must too.   Over all, the food is really good. Lots of flavours. Some dishes however on the menu are a low in value however - octopus, kale salad, being examples of that. On the other had, their wings, ribs, chickens are phenomenal."}
{"text":"Came here with a group of friends for dinner on a Wednesday night. The place was not very busy and I think our larger group might have been a little much for the restaurant. There was only 1 server that I could see & she could only do so much. She was awesome though. Very friendly and offered some good suggestions from the menu. She really helped to make our evening great. If not for her, I would have rated this place a little lower.  We ordered: * mac & cheese - one of my favourite dishes of the evening. It was cheesy, creamy and smooth * pulled pork poutine - also pretty good * pulled pork nachos - great for sharing  * deep-fried pickles - nice but nothing all that spectacular * half chicken dinner - really nice and tasty * sample meat platters - we ordered a few of these to share. It was a great way to try the different sauces and the various meat options. The one thing I think they could've done to make it better would be to slowly cook the ribs a little longer so that it would be more tender.  * turtle cheesecake - it was nice but a little sweet & rich for most of us. * berry crisp with bourbon ice cream - aside from the mac & cheese this was my favourite part of dinner."}
{"text":"Service and food were both outstanding. Very nice ambiance and great homemade food. I had the korean sweet & sour ribs (amazing) and my friend had the pulled pork sandwhich (which she said was excellent.) We shared the slaw, mashed potatoes & jalapeno cornbread - all of which were excellent. Our server was so great that she even talked us into dessert (their take on an o'Henry bar) which was well worth it. The price was great, and we had all of that food plus 2 pints for $50. A great new gem in Cabbagetown."}
{"text":"Hungry going in, hungry going out.  Service: 0/5  We were sited promptly at arrival, upon ordering, we were told that smoke meat and reuben sandwich was not available for ordering. So going to a smoke meat place without smoke meat is like going to wings place without wings. Why brother even open for business if your main item is not available?  We placed our order, meat sampler dinner for two, which was supposed to be a taster of the best item offered by the restaurant. The description of the dish was 4 wings, 4 rib, 4 oz of smoke meat and 4 oz of pull pork, served with rye bread.  What we were served almost 45 minutes later is: 8 piece of wings, 4 piece of ribs, 4 oz of pull pork, and some loaf breads.  We were never notify of the substitution or let us know there was a delay, and was sitting there hungry awaits for our food while other tables are being served.  The waitress avoid eye contact with us after putting down the dish and never asked how the food was.  Food: 0/5  Let's start with wings, when we bite on it, it felt very dry, and there is no tenderness or juiciness you normally associated with wings.  Ribs, it's so hard to chew that it's like rubber. Do not associate this with your typical fall-off-the-bone-smoked-rib.  Pull Pork, it's okay-ish, nothing spectacular.  Smoke meat, never get to try it, they either ran out or never made it for the night. Which is kind of odd for a Friday evening to go without your signature item.  Rye Bread, loaf bread was substituted instead, and there is not enough meat to eat with as we were not served with smoke meat. (Plus finger mark left on the bread as well)  Conclusion: 0/5  We ate what we could (we couldn't finish the rib because it's too hard to chew on, and bread because there is no meat or stuffing to go with) and wrote a message to waitress describing what was wrong. Obviously they know we're not happy with what was served as we saw staff had discussions behind the scene looking at us. However, no offer was made as a gesture or apology. Defintely not coming back or recommending anyone. to come back.  End up going back home to make noodle as potion of food was not for 2, more like 1 and half person. And angry that we wasted a night out eating disappointing food."}
{"text":"What a delight to have brunch here. I had their 420 signature burger (see photo) and can't rave enough about it. The meat was juicy, the fried egg was perfect, and the bun was fresh. The hashvrowns were OK, but to finish it off, the sliced honeydew was a bonus to cleanse your palette. Large and spacious although no patio. Located in the heart of Cabbagetown, it's really a \"secret garden\" waiting to be found. Come for brunch. This place deserves your attention."}
{"text":"This place is definitely a hidden gem! Great BBQ wings, ribs, and pulled pork. The place is very cozy, clean and welcoming. The service is great! Very genuine friendly service. The price is great. Compared to the popular House on Parliament, this place is more quite, enjoyable with great value for the food and service. Strongly recommended."}
{"text":"Mediocre. Wings so not special. Meat poutine lacking meat. Corn bread was a hit. Very noisy and waiter has doesnt care attitude. Not a return spot."}
{"text":"Went to the 420 last evening with a friend. The place is nice, service great, though mind you it was empty. Here's the thing: the food was generally very good. The smoked meat sandwich my friend has was delicious as were the beans and corn bread. BUT: the ribs I ordered were dreadful. They were dry and tough. The rub was overpoweringly peppery covering any other flavours used. Maybe the ribs were leftover from Canada Day, who knows, but they were pretty dreadful. You can't call yourself a smokehouse with ribs like that. I did say something, but no one came out to chat with me."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, service and most importantly the Jerk Pickerel on wild rice with kidney beans and coleslaw was absolutely scrumptious! The surface of the fish was slight blackened and crisp. Yet it was still juicy, flaky while the meat maintained a distinct bounce to the texture. There was a subtle taste of the spicy jerk seasoning but still allowed the flavour of the fish to come through."}
