{"text":"Delicious Korean food. Great find !  Ask for kimchi if you want some. Support Korean food!

I came across this restaurant by accident. Glad I checked it out."}
{"text":"Awesome staff and the only Korean bar around Phoenix area. The food is decent and they have soju! Will be back. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Excellent place! Had the chicken wings, rice cakes and padak! You will be thoroughly surprised and not realized how different this street food is so different than the typical! The service was kind and fast. Give it a try, it'll totally surprise you!"}
{"text":"This Valentine's Day evening we chose to dine at Cafe Agit for the first time as I was craving Korean style chicken and we wanted a low key evening. And it was great! 

We chose from their menu the Korean style wings, padak chicken, fish cake pot and ddeokgochi (rice cake skewers). The fish cake pot was particularly delicious because the broth was very flavorful. Everything was delicious by my only critiques are: the Korean style wings had a little too much gochujang for my taste which made them peppery  and the padak could have used more sauce. 

In addition, our server was very sweet and attentive. And it was awesome that there was live music! The young lady playing guitar and singing was extremely talented and I would love to come back again when she's playing. 

It didn't take me back to the streets of Seoul but it's definitely worth the time!"}
{"text":"We were driving by, and saw that this place had replaced the old Pizza Pit (which went out of business for a reason). So we stopped in. EVERYTHING we got was awesome! I didn't have any cocktails, but the prices are very very cheap, $2 for a 16 oz draft, and other great deals on alcoholic beverages. If anything, go there for the upscale, on the lake atmosphere, with dive bar prices. 

Now the food! I am a chicken wing advocate and these things are FANTASTIC, and they come with fries for $6.99. It seems like they are baked, then finished on the grill (guessing), then just smothered in sauce. They were fall off the bone delicious! We also got the the tteok bok ki, and mushroom ramen. Both were very good. Service was great, and unlike many Asian restaurants, we left feeling better than we came in. 

I would highly recommend this place for the prices, atmosphere, cleanliness, quality, and of course the awesome food!"}
{"text":"Awesome service, cozy vibes and the best dumplings I've ever had, the wings are SO GOOD and they have Soju!"}
{"text":"I came with a group of friends for my birthday for a little drinking and food and this place did not disappoint. When the food says spicy it really means spicy but everything we ordered went so nicely with all of the drinks we ordered. When we showed up it was slow but more people showed up later into the night and the atmosphere was really cool. The staff was super friendly too and were always around when we needed to order more drinks or get more cups. I saw a karaoke machine that the music was playing from too but unfortunately no one was brave enough to use it. Maybe next time we'll order more drinks."}
{"text":"So far after ROK (Oldtown Korean bar) closed down, this places seems to be the only Korean bar i know in the Phoenix region that is that is a legit Korean bar. After Vegas, I stopped by here with a few friends Sunday night. This place has a really good Korean vibe. I was wondering where all the Koreans hang out :D. I like pocha so this place is good enough for me. I'll definitely be back. 

Likes: 
-The server is cute
- (Yang Nyum Chicken) is delicious. The sweet spicy taste, just like eating general tsaos chicken. 
- (bulgogi) is was good. It's like any other bulgogi you get a Korean restaurant. 
-Alcohol: We were drinking somek [soju + beer (mekju)] all night which was awesome. 

*I wish they had corn cheese and juipoh*"}
{"text":"(Unfinished review from 6/3/2016)
Korean Sports Bar - like the ones in K-town (LA). Was craving some Kyochon but this did not satisfy the craving. Wings were crispy but the flavors were not enticing. Do not get their noodle soup - tasted like packaged ramen noodle you can make at home. In conclusion, my hunt continues..

After I posted, I see that they have CLOSED. Not a shocker."}
{"text":"Came here to try to the KFC. It was pretty good. Unique flavor and has a good crunch even though it was smothered in sauce. 
I would give it a 4 stars but the pricing was expensive. It came out to be 9 dollars for basically 6 wings. 
I liked it but the price was too much"}
{"text":"Food is delicious over here! Love the atmosphere and the staff. Definitely will be coming here more often! I haven't had such great Korean food in a while!"}
{"text":"This place reminds me of being in K-Town in Cali. A small lounge/ bar where you can grab food & drinks while doing some karaoke!
We came here on a Saturday night and it was pretty dead. There were only two tables including ours but we didn't mind. We ordered some Korean style chicken wings, spicy Korean rice cakes and ramen with dumplings. The wings were crispy and there was a little to much gochujang but we enjoyed it. The ramen literally tastes like the package ramen you buy at the Asian store and they just added some dumplings to it. ( I like the Korean ramen so I wasn't disappointed & it would have been better if they had some kimchi )
However the spicy Korean rice cakes were blah. The rice cakes were drenched in gochujang and it was very plain. We did order and egg ($1 extra) but they forgot to put it in our food so our server brought it out to us after we were done eating. She apologized and said they would not charge us for it.
I'll be back with my friends to enjoy some karaoke and drinks!"}
{"text":"From the outside it looked like any other restaurants' but there's a small patio if you walk out the back door! We wanted to try their gal-bi but unfortunately they were out of it. We ended up getting dduk-gal-bi which is ground beef with sweet teriyaki sauce. Actually they were out of a lot of stuff we wanted to order as well but can't complain because all the dishes we got were pretty darn good. Glad to find this cozy little place thats perfect for night outs!"}
{"text":"Came on a Friday night.  The place was kinda of empty.  Got the Korean fried chicken and poddak.  Yes, both are fried chicken with difference sauces...  They were very good and had great flavorful sauces.  The server we got was brand new, so he had to ask the other server when we had questions."}
{"text":"Awkward/ rude experience with the server at best. Ordered calamari and popcorn chicken and...for the money we paid the portions and taste were not satisfactory. Right when we walked out we all looked at each other and knew that we wouldn't be back. Sad because a place that serves good Korean food is so rare and we were initially excited. Very disappointed, but maybe if we give it another try we'll have a better experience with a different waitress."}
{"text":"Cafe Agit is a small gem in Phoenix if you're looking to get some real Korean bar food. Reminiscent of the places I've eaten at in LA's Korea town there is never ending soju, with tasty Korean fried chicken, bulgogi, or that insane sea food pancake. The decor is classic and the service feels very friendly and casual like you're waking into a home. Definitely a must try in the Mesa Chandler area!"}
{"text":"My friend recommended this Korean place to me, the food was good. But I ended up throwing up later. I thought it was the chicken wings, because my buddy said she felt the same way. The wings are tasty to be honest, but it was not right for us. Will not go again."}
{"text":"Update! They do serve panchan now, and when we went they had 4 little side dishes. No kimchi which was odd, but they did have black bean, fish cake, shredded marinated seaweed, and small crispy fish. The fried chicken dish (Korean popcorn chicken) was awesome. It was perfectly crispy with tender chicken. I've had the Korean style sweet/spicy sauce with chicken or on rice cake at other restaurants and this version is very similar. For me, as a note on the dish as a whole everywhere, I prefer a little more acid to balance out the sweetness, but that's just me.

The bbq plates we've had have been tender, with a lot of savory and slightly sweet flavor. The bulgolgi and spicy pork were excellent. I also tried some udon which had a more delicate, seafood flavor with a heaping amount of veggies, some fishcake, and noodles.
 
The soju was well hidden within the pineapple flavor we ordered it with. You won't know what hit you until you've had quite a few shots!

Service was great and we each got chopsticks with our meal this time. It's still a great place to dine for dinner and late at night!"}
{"text":"Korean dive bar right in the middle of Mesa! Portions are quite large.

Things to get: 

Kkanpunggi  (Spicy Garlic Fried Chicken) - popcorn chicken in a spicy tangy sauce, excellent

Padak  (Green Onion Fried Chicken) - same fried chicken in a delicious sweet and tangy mustard sauce. This one had a bit less mustard but it came with a lot of green onion strands which I love - friends not so much.

Not so great: 

Korean Fried Wings  - breading was ultra thick and weighed down the chicken. Eating this was a slog and I actually didn't finish this even when I brought it home. (Never Happens)


We also got Chum Churum Peach soju which was pretty tasty stuff. Tasted like a Bellini and packed a punch at 14%.

Still can't believe this place exists in the middle of Mesa in a random strip mall. Just having the K-pop and divey Korean bar feel does it for me but for people expecting Seoul or LA quality fried chicken they may come away disappointed. 

Friend said Cafe Agit was better a couple years ago but as a first time visitor in 2016 I loved it."}
{"text":"Basis for my starred ratings (which skews heavily to the food or drink):
1 star:  Never again.
2 stars:  Poor food, poor experience, extraordinary measures in order for me to come back.
3 stars:  Average, nothing really special, nothing particularly bad.
4 stars:  Very good, would definitely return.
5 stars:  A favorite, one of the best.

Totally unassuming Korean bar-food joint.  Went in with no expectations and having compared it to other Korean chicken in the Valley and to Korean bar-food in LA (here's looking at you Dan Sung Sa), this place is fine.  We were hoping for more, but it's an average tasting joint where you probably won't be disappointed but won't be wowed by the food either.

Ordered the tteok-ko-chi (rice cake) skewers.  Not crispy enough on the outside but the sauce was fine.  La-pok-ki (spicy rice cake and ramen noodles) was also decent, good size portion, but lacked a little heat and a little depth of flavor.  Ordered the dak-ddong-jeep (chicken gizzards) which were overly salted but cooked nicely.  Next time we are going to ask to have them prepared spicy.  The wings, average (noticing a theme?)  And finally, the paddak chicken, which Crazy Chicken and Crab, I believe, does better with a bigger portion (but accompanying higher price.)  

If you're with a bunch of buddies just looking for a drink and something to eat while drinking, this place is totally fine.  My wife and I would probably only come here if we were really craving Korean bar food, but as a destination dining location, I'm not so sure."}
{"text":"This place was ok. May go back for drinks. Food was disappointing. They were not busy, maybe 3 others there in the bar. The service was ok but the food was off. Soggy, undercooked fries. The waitress had asked if we wanted them seasoned and we said yes. Apparently that means very lightly salted.  The entrees came out at different times and we had to remind our waitress of the sides that came with the meal. Flavors were very one dimensional.  Best way that I can describe our experience was \"meh.\" At least the beer was cold."}
{"text":"We were passing by the area and came across this gem! I didn't know I would find such cool korean bar in Mesa :D their food was great and service was fast and excellent. We had the korean style chicken and it was amazing. Also great deal on alcohol.  I certainly will be a regular!"}
{"text":"I have been looking for good Korean bars/eateries since I left the SF Bay Area. Unfortunately, this is not the one. Absolutely horrible. 

Bad food; too greasy and bland. Our server was very weird as well. One of my friends ordered fire chicken bowl: What a horrible dish! Dry chicken pieces swimming on a grease pool and overcooked noodles. Of course, we sent it back. The server said she had to charge it. We said OK; then she changed her mind and didn't charge it. We wanted to order another Kalbi but they were out; we wanted Bulgogi instead but they were out. The explanation was they were really busy two days ago. Imagine the freshness.

Just don't go."}
{"text":"Came here with two friends on a Wednesday night. It was around 6pm so we were the only ones there as Cafe Agit is more lively later in the evening. 

The restaurant is clean and spacious. Somber korean love ballads play in the background. The furniture and walls are all black colored. It's a good place to go with a group of up to four people. There's a private seating area with a table that could seat up to ~10 people (with only a piece of cloth as a divider).

It was nice to enjoy our meal in quiet, but because it was so early in the evening, there was only one chef and one waiter working and the food took a while to come out.

When it did finally come out, the dishes were delicious. We ordered the \"Podakk\" (chicken pieces that are breaded and deep fried and covered in a savory sauce with chives on top), udon, and chicken katsu (comes with salad). Each were delicious, and the quantity was enough to more than satisfy three girls' stomachs.

I would definitely come here again to try the chicken wings and other menu items."}
{"text":"Decided to come here because of the delicious looking pictures and the 5 star rating. The restaurant was empty with 2 other couples. The space was clean, roomy, and the one waitress was very nice. We found the prices to be quite high. 

With that being said, I decided to order the dumpling ramen. When my dish came, it turns out what appears to be TOP RAMEN! I was very upset paying $8 for this bowl. 

My boyfriend ordered the kalbi rice bowl. The flavour was tasty, but super oily and salty. Moreover, the Korean style side dishes were just bizarre. 4 small cups (mini spicy shelled shrimp, fish patties, flavourless bean sprouts, and black beans?) This dish was a whopping $20.

Additionally, he spent an extra $2.50 for tea flavored water. They must have waved the tea bag over the pitcher. 

Also, this restaurant is billed as a sports bar, but we were watching the local news instead of the NFL wildcard game. 

Should of gone with our gut feeling of eating elsewhere since there are delicious Korean diners down the street."}
{"text":"Heard about this place for its KFC (korean fried chicken) so I decided to give it a shot. The place has both bar and dining area, reminds me of the small family restaurants in k-town. I was excited to try some KFC that I had craving for a while! However the quality of the food didn't impress me as much... Maybe I set up the expectation too high, but the batter on the chicken wings was too thick for my liking, and the flavor was subpar compared to what I had in Cali. The Dduk Gochi was pretty good, similar taste as I expected. Crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside with Korean sweet chili sauce. Overall I think this place has good potential, I want to give this place another try after reading other yelp reviews, maybe with a bigger group so we can try different menu.

{"text":"Came at a quiet time on Friday night but looks like it would definitely but a cool place to hang out in the early morning hours. The yogurt soju was on point!!!"}
{"text":"A lesson from K-drama: Soju won't solve your problems but neither will milk.

We popped in here after attending a child's 1st birthday party and I for one needed a drink.  I came for the soju but ended up staying for the food.  At 8PM on a Friday night, this place was dead.  There were two elderly guys at the bar taking advantage of the $3.50 16 fl.oz Bud Lights, a couple sitting on the lakeside patio, and our table of three.  That was pretty much how it stayed until we left when another group of three popped in.  But on with the show!

We had ordered a carafe of pineapple soju for starters.  At $10 a small carafe, it was downed between the three of us.  It tasted mainly like watered down pineapple juice and no one even tasted the soju.  We later ordered a carafe of yogurt soju and it was pretty much the same --- all yogurt, no soju.  None of us even had a tiny buzz when we walked out so it makes me think that they go skimpy with the alcohol.  Not cool.  We also ordered some Korean Style Wings, Dduck Ko Chi (fried rice cake), and Bulgogi to share.  The Korean Style Wings are similar to this other KFC [Korean Fried Chicken] place in Chandler and it was delicious!  There was some definite heat and I regretted it when I took out my contacts later that night.  Yeowch!  The  Dduck Ko Chi were also amazing.  It was even spicier than the wings and I enjoyed the crispiness.  The Bulgogi was a miss for me though.  I miss that char that other Korean BBQ places have on their meat. The bulgogi they served us sat in this watery sauce and didn't really have any flavor.

So while the soju cocktails were definitely weak and the Bulgogi lacked luster, I enjoyed the Korean Style Wings and the Dduck Ko Chi.  4-stars for Cafe Agit because I'm curious about some of their other menu items.  Come for the food but if you're wanting to get some dranks, don't come here."}
