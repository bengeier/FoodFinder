There was only 2 customers there when we arrived and they were both at the same table, that should have been the first warning, the room was dark and very outdated with dishes piled on a cart in plain view and that should have been warning number 2. The food was not good at Absolutely terrible. There was only 2 customers there when we arrived and they were both at the same table, that should have been the first warning, the room was dark and very outdated with dishes piled on a cart in plain view and that should have been warning number 2. The food was not good at all, the tacos meat was bland, the taco shell was chewy and almost seemed stale, the enchiladas had very little cheese with a sauce that would have tasted better if it came out of a can,  and the mojito was perhaps the worst I've ever had. When we went to pay with a Groupon we were told that it wasn't valid for daily specials  and that we couldn't use it or we could if we payed full price (price with special $39, without $72), we opted to pay for it without the Groupon and have emailed Groupon asking for a refund or credit.  Stay away from this place, you would be much better off getting food from virtually anywhere else. for it without the Groupon and have emailed Groupon asking for a refund or credit.

{"text":"My friend and I were in the area and decided to give it try.  It was about 1pm and there were no cars to be seen.  Thar was my first clue that this wasn't going to be good.  We went in anyhow.  It was strange and had a weird odor.  It waz dark and dreary.  The menu looked promising and ordered off the lunch menu.  I had the beef flautas and he had the chicken.  But I'm getting ahead of myself.  We liked the chips but the salsa was very odd - and not in good way.  On to lunch, the beef flautas were decent and was served with tasteless beans and rice.  My friend didn't like the chicken at all.  The service was good but everything else was a real miss.  Sorry Manny...you got some of my money today but that's it - never again!!!!"}
{"text":"Manny's used to be the old \"Arturo's\" restaurant from way back however this is the first time we ate at Manny's. Nothing spectacular to brag about but then its a typical Mexican food restaurant on par with many similar establishments. The food was \"good\" overall but our server was even better. We were motivated to eat here based on a \"buy one get one free\" coupon the restaurant sent out. Being a participating establishment of the dining program was also a factor in our choice. However we didn't notice the coupon was not valid for Fridays, the very day we were visiting. Oh well, we should have read the fine print. While the food was not exceptional it wasn't bad by no means but I can say my wife and I had a pleasant dining experience none the less."}
{"text":"Stopped in the Goodyear location for lunch on Friday.  Wasn't sure they were open, since it seemed dark and there were no cars on the parking lot.  My friends and I were the only ones in the restaurant.  Decor was very dark, and uninspired.    Our waitress was attentive, and kept the chips and salsa coming while we had some margaritas and waited for our meals.    The food was mediocre, at best.  Two friends had the taco salad.  The taco shell was crisp, but the salad was a wet mixutre of mystery ingredients.  Nothing about the presentation looked appealing.  I order shrimp tacos with flour tortillas.  My shrimp and cabbage were so wet that the tortillas fell apart before I could eat them.  The beans and rice were ordinary.  Don't think I'll return.  The restaurant is nothing like the original Manny's in Avondale."}
{"text":"I needed to have daddy and daughter time with my 3 year old and had an awesome dinner with her here. Justin, Paul, and Daisy did an awesome job holding down the fort down. Food was just what I expected and my daughter whom usually doesn't like Mexican food, ate half my plate:). I recommend this place if in avondale."}
{"text":"Finally tried this place and  was pleasantly suprised. We ordered the fajitas to share and it was very good. We will definitely be going back again."}
{"text":"Horrible. Went to the one in Avondale.  Man who acted like owner, was extremely rude like he didn't want to wait on us. Very long wait for food and the service was worst ever.  Food was not good and left us with a nasty aftertaste.  I do not recommend this place for so many reasons.  I have never given a bad review in my life, but we are pleasant quiet people and there was no reason to be treated like we were."}
{"text":"Ordered take out for the first time through uber eats. Not sure if that was why I had my issue. I ordered the enchilada and taco combo, the portion was absurdly small. Maybe enough for a kids combo, and the taco was about the size of the palm of my hand. I like going to the location on el mirage and indian school better. Never ordering again from here or even thinking about going to this location ever. Not to mention that the amount of beans and rice was maybe half a scoop if I was lucky."}
{"text":"Love Manny's! Wife love the steak Fajitas, tasty carne asada tacos, and Good beer mixes. Micheladas are great! 4/5 stars since they seem to run on very minimal waiters for service. So service is sometimes slow. Jalapeño poppers appetizers also tend to get over-cooked. All else is good though."}
{"text":"We've passed by this place a few times but we finally made it in tonight :) We were greeted and seated within seconds of entering. The waitress and other staff were quick, friendly, and attentive. The food was great too! We had a couple drinks which we were happy with.  Plan on going into the bar next visit. We were told they are expecting to get a pool table in there soon!"}
{"text":"Lets start with the food: my bf and I both had the choose 3 items plate. He had green chili corn tamale,  Chile reano,  and taco. I had the same, just an enchilada instead of the reano. It was mediocre at best. No flavor or spice to speak of. The green Chile tamale was really good, but that was it. The rice was just rice with some tomato sauce cooked in it. The retried beams were bland a.f. my bf took two bites of his reano, and said it was the worst he ever had. Then there was the \"salsa\" and chips. The \"salsa\" was tomato sauce with some onions chunked in it. Terrible. No flavor except onion and tomato. Bad.  The service:  or lack there of. One guy brought us chips and \"salsa\", the other guy took or order, brought our order...that was it. The whole time we ate, he didn't stop to ask us how the food was, or if we needed more water (I was out half way thrust dinner).  So, it wasn't the worst service or food, AMD OT wasn't good either. It was \"whatever, won't be coming here again\".  Lucky for us we didn't have to shell out 40.00 for the lack of experience, because it was 16.00 on Groupon.  Oh, and they have ZERO beer/alcohol."}
{"text":"I have been to Mannys many times and this was the worst experience ever. Paul our servicer stated that \"he would have to make some  coffee, that it was from this morning\". My boyfriend order steak fajita and it was totally inedible.  I had a shredded taco salad and the beef was nothing but fat. They were out of everything and the kids food came out cold. I think that this will be the last time I will ever go into this place. Horrible experience and the only reason they are getting a star is because they have to get at least one. The 18% gratuity  certainly wasn't earned and I am a good tipper. Just horrible. So done with this place. When we told our server about it, he nothing to say , but he told the cook and the cook agreed, but we paid for it anyways. No compensation..."}
{"text":"Terrible will never return!!!   Waited 10min to b seated when the entire place was empty, then server took another 5 just to greet us...food was terrible!! We got 1 refill ..it was hotter than hell in there as well!!! She added gratuity to the bill ofcoarse , which I have nothing against if she deserved it ...but she was never attentive to us , I'm sorry but u guys have got a lot of work to do!"}
{"text":"We were hesitant to try this place after reading previous reviews. We were however pleasantly surprised. While the service was slow the food was better than most of the Mexican places we have tried so far.  Will defiantly go back."}
{"text":"Service was awesome.  But other than that, the rest is a trending spiral of disappointment.  The ambiance- none. The Food - almost approaching mediocre. The drinks- expensive and either watered down (hubs) or funny tasting (mine).  Not worth the price of the Groupon.  The best I can say is that their other location is worse so this location is a 1/2 step above."}
{"text":"Great food with a laid back atmosphere. Really enjoyed the enchiladas and their tamales. Very fresh with a great flavor."}
{"text":"Mannys is excellent, I had the Taco salad and the lady had carne asada tacos. Food was authentic and delicious. Huge portions at a solid price, I will return for more great food!"}
{"text":"Service was awful, and food was disgusting. Taco Bell has better flavored food than place. They messed up the order twice."}
{"text":"I went to the Goodyear location, ordered the Carne Asada Burro and it was delicious! I was very impressed with the food & service. Our waiter was extremely nice, always had a smile, and joked around with us younger adults. I definitely recommend them to anyone!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed a pitcher of Margarita and some street tacos. Good service and cozy environment!"}
{"text":"Food is not good but service is awesome. I was hoping that's since Arthuros restaurant use to be there it was going to be tasty but no it was not. It's a little expensive too. Sorry guys I'm a huge fan of chips and salsa and they need some major work in the area salsa taste like red devil sauce was added to it. The shredded beef taco I had was pretty good though. I may go to tryout there breakfast menu but I don't ever plan on eating dinner there. Staff was very friendly curious and service was fast. If only the food was just as great."}
{"text":"Newly opened. Great service from a nice young lady named Salina. Had cheese enchiladas with rice n beans. All was great. Served hot and quick.  Great new find not far from home! Nice happy hour menu too. Sweet!"}
{"text":"Horrible customer service! I had a group of 20 for dinner. When we first walked in the server gave us a \"stank\" face for having such a big party and we had to put our own tables together for seating. There were maybe 15 people in the whole restaurant but the servers never even came to take our drink order.  People who came in after us were even helped while we were left waiting. Every time we go there we get nothing but bad bad service!!! Never again will I go back!!"}
{"text":"The reason I am giving one star at all is because the sweet waitress took our soup off the bill without us even asking her do do so! The salsa was from cans. The albondigas was not edible. Meatballs were not made at the restaurant.  They were from a bag. No veggied. No bueno. Couldn't even eat it."}
{"text":"We thought we were going to make this place our every Tuesday date night, but after experiencing Elsa, we will go back to the Manny's on Indian School and El Mirage where the servers are not grumpy. good thing this location has a liquor license to numb customers from the rude service!"}
{"text":"Well this place was awkward. Have you ever stepped into a place and instantly felt like you shouldn't be there? Well, that's how I felt about this place. I should have left but the server greeted us and seated us right away since it was DEAD inside.   There was only 1 other group inside the restaurant and a family had walked in behind us. The outside of the building looks old and rundown, the inside looks like an office space instead of a restaurant. There was not color, no pizzaz, it was bleh. I'm used to Mexican restaurants being lively, colorful, and with lots of ambiance. The only pizzaz was one lonely Corona piñata that looked out of place with the rest of the room.   The service was good. We were given chips and salsa as soon as we were seated and our food came out within 15 min of being there. I ordered a margarita and it was gross. It had a weird flavor like old lemon/lime flavor. I wanted to send it back but the one waitress was busy.  So I reluctantly drank it after I watered it down. YUCK. I ordered a bean and cheese chimi and my hubs ordered carne asada tacos. The food was ok. It wasn't anything out of the ordinary or special. I could have gotten a cheaper and more delicious chimi if I had gone to Señor taco. What was another sucky part of this already awkward meal was the price. My BEAN & CHEESE chimi was $10.95 and it came with NOTHING ELSE on the side. Just the chimi itself. I was pretty pissed. My hubs tacos came with rice and beans and his came out the same.   I didn't like anything about this place except the service. The waitress was really nice and that's about it. The place is expensive, the food is meh, and the margaritas are GROSS. Unfortunately I will stick to Señor Taco from now on. Cheaper and more delicious!"}
{"text":"We went to Mannys around 4:00 pm Oct 29th and was seated as we walked in.  Ordered drinks and they brought out warm chips and a great salsa and refilled.  The food came out on hot plates and beans, rice and fish tacos were great.  Other family members had beans, rice and burritos.loved the food.  Would recommend to everyone, we were pleased with our meal and service."}
{"text":"We will never go here again. This place is close to home, so we thought we would give it a shot. It was a saturday and we were watching the football game. We had a few beers and service was great....until the waitress brought us our check. She charged us for 30 beers. Upon calling her over to advise her there was a mistake, she simply looked at us and with attitude stated \"you had 15 beers a piece!\" I then proceeded to talk to the manager who told me that I would pay for what I drank. As an owner of a restaurant, I asked her to roll back the tapes to verify I did NOT drink 15 beers. She told me that I could either pay for check or she was going to call the cops. She was totally unprofessional and lacked managerial skills. If you take the risk of going there, do NOT open a tab. PAY CASH!!!!"}
{"text":"Love taco Tuesdays, can't beat $1 ground beef tacos , $1 bean tostadas, $1 cheese enchiladas, and $1 bean burritos for the purchase of only a beverage!! So filling and great portion sizes, definitely took the enchilada and burro home, and was just as delish as the day before!"}
{"text":"I will NEVER return to this spot. I wasnt greeted by the two bartenders when I sat down at the bar. It took way too long to get some communication n a drink. I was served a margarita in a plastic cup...when I asked for a margarita glass the bartender said she cant serve them in the margarita glass. I ordered food n two minutes later wanted to change it n the bartender didnt even attempt to go stop it before they started making it. I had two patron margaritas n some food n was billed $60. I have service experience n I know when someone thinks they can take advantage.  The bartender argued when I mentioned it so I asked for the mgr n she got it straight.  The deal was $5 margaritas n i was charged n extra $7 bc they was served with patron smh. They need to work on they customer service n the smell in this establishment is bad. They really need to get it together.  They lost a customer last night."}
{"text":"The food here is so delicious and better than the other location! Justin was our server and he was fast and friendly! Great did and great service we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My review is from a dinner we had about April 23, (Taco Tuesday)  was excited to see that the old Arturo's was reopening from a place we have visited on Indian School rd.  The staff was super friendly and right on top of service from chips & salsa, drink refills, dinner being served and prompt return of the check.   Food was good and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Ordered Manny's through UberEATS and it was one of the best Mexican meals we've had in a long time. The Tres Mariachis Enchilada and Chimichangas tasted incredible.   So excited to have found Manny's!!"}
{"text":"Poor service and horrible food. We were one of only 3 tables seated in the whole restaurant and it took 45 minutees to receive our food. Server was not focused, and were out of several food items and unapologetic about it. Made it seem like he was doing us a favor. Enchiladas and Tacos were small and with little sauce and little meat, and were served at luke warm temperature. We enjoy their Indian School location. Never againn here on Van Buren..."}
{"text":"This is the third time I've used Uber eats this is the second time they screwed up my order it's also the last time I used Uber eats"}
{"text":"Not good. This was our 3rd time.  The first time we went we actually had decent service and the food was pretty good. The second time we noticed it was not as busy and the food was just okay. This last time the food was not great and the service was terrible. When you go on a Saturday night and there's only one other table of people in the restaurant and no cars in the parking lot that should tell you something. It was close by and I would buy Groupons that made it reasonable. But I definitely would not go back and I don't even know how they stay open with no customers."}
