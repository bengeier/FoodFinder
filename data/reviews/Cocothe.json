{"text":"Cocothe has found itself! We recently had a very nice dinner with great service. The atmosphere is warm and inviting. The food was delicious and satisfying. I highly recommend this for a special meal."}
{"text":"Situation: dinner with my husband  Background: I had dinner here with my husband in 2/2017. We had never been to the sewickley area and thought we would try a restaurant there. btw the houses in this neighborhood are gorgeous. We didn't think we were very hungry and thought we would keep the ordering to a minimum, but as soon as we saw the menu, we decided to go for the 3 course instead of the 2 course meal.  We loved everything (from dishes that we ordered to the standard additions: bread, amuse-bouche). I thought the veal was slightly oversalted but my husband thought it was the best veal he has had.  We are both fans of Altius but this restaurant (although does not have the view of altius) has more creative dishes and better execution.  The decor/setting was intimate and romantic, modern and not frilly.  Also, service was excellent.   Assessment: This is a great french-american restaurant with solid execution of an delicious-sounding menu.  and we would definitely come back again.  Recommendations: Josephine's desire (cocktail), beef tartar, pork belly, veal, pappardelle, gnocchi"}
{"text":"Amazing atmosphere and food so fresh and delicious. It's fresh off the grill and Tate's like heaven. I came with my daughter and the service was great and food even better. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone. So if you are just walking by I'd go in and check it out.   :-)"}
{"text":"Wonderful lunch and great ambiance.  The menu and decor set this restaurant apart from the usual.  Everyone at our table ordered something different and was quite pleased with what was ordered.  The food was well prepared, fresh, creative, and interesting.  The service was good with all of our meals delivered at the same time.  Far superior to the other lunch restaurants we've tried in Sewickley."}
{"text":"We walked in and didn't have reservations.  The maitre d' (who may also be the manager) asked if we had one which we said No. He proceeded to say that it was good it was a slow Friday otherwise we may not be seated. I held my tongue but wanted to say 1) We looked in and saw it wasn't busy which was actually WHY we came in and 2) Would you like me to go on my OpenTable and make a reservation now? It could have went downhill from there but was fine.  But thats not why 3 stars.  Here's my review...  Food: The presentation was beautiful but the taste did not match. Two course or three course option. We chose two. You get two amuse bouche to start. We received goat cheese, fig, and watercress - Good balance of flavors; potato soup - Tasty; potato with a chive cream - balanced; and something I don't recall that reminded me of arancini. Appetizers: Beef tartar with quail eggs - Good flavor; Veal sweetbreads with cheese ravioli and braised red cabbage - Eating it all together was really balanced and the flavors went well. Entrees: Seabass with seafood risotto and shellfish glace - THIS IS WHY 3 STARS. It was not that enjoyable. The fish was cooked nicely but it could have done without the seafood glace which, to me, did not taste good. The flavor was off. The risotto was okay. It had some black olives in it which, if maybe there were more, could have brought a bit more acidity to the dish and offset the glace. Veal with bone marrow custard and hollandaise - It was a bit tough to cut into. Tasting all together was okay but also had a bite of bitterness.  Service: Other than the initial encounter the service was good. Our server was knowledgeable, explained all dishes that came out, and was attentive but not overbearingly. And the maitre d' / mgr came by also and was pleasant this time around.  Ambience: Has an air of stuffyness initially but fine once seated. It has a mellow vibe."}
{"text":"Amazing!!!  This is truly fine dining at its best. The decor is chic and refined.  The staff is well educated in the menu.  The French inspired cuisine is absolutely delicious.   From the minute my husband and I entered the front door we were immediately greeted by Neal who was very warm and welcoming.  Our server Rose was well educated in the menu and was very gracious.   DJ the bartender was very engaging and knowledgeable about wines.  The food was unbelievable.   From the first course to the last.  Sous Chef Julie and Pat really have the magic touch when it comes to blending flavors and textures, they  were unbelievable .  For dessert we had this amazing almond cake with raspberry filling topped with  chocolate gnache and raspberries, edible flowers and edible gold leaf accents made by Josh who is so talented.  So, if you truly want a dining experience,  visit Cocothe in Sewickley."}
{"text":"My first experience at Cocothé involved casually walking through Sewickley when I noticed this enchanting alleyway with dining tables and candles. It both made me think of Lady and the Tramp and a European fantasy. This instantly intrigued me. Determined to find to whom this dining area belonged, I looked around. Two doors down was Cocothé, the inside clean and elegant, like an upscale teahouse. Lining the walls on two sides are modern display shelves with teaware and tea offerings, neither cluttered nor barren.   I approached the counter as they had just opened for the evening asked to see a menu and learn more about it. Before leaving, I purchased a cookie, assuming that as a chocolatier of sorts, this should be indicative of my expectations. I do fancy myself a bit of a cookie connoisseur, and I can positively say that the cookie blew my mind. It was moist, chewy, delicious, and flavorful without being overwhelmingly sweet. I also detected a pleasant pinch of saltiness that really accentuated the rest of the flavors.  I kept this place in mind and decided to try the dinner service with my wife for our anniversary. We made reservations in advance and, upon arrival, there was no waiting, just a friendly, enthusiastic greeting, which was nice and not artificial.   My wife and I were seated outside in the Euro-like alleyway, just as I had hoped when I first found the place. Our server was very pleasant and helpful when we asked questions. For drinks, we ordered a glass of the drinking chocolate and a mug of tea. Everything here is made from scratch, including the chocolate used in the drinks. The espresso-based drinks even have homemade syrups for those who want something more than a basic cappuccino. The drinking chocolate I ordered, The Saint, was luscious and spicy, in a cinnamon and clove kind of way. There were some small discrepancies between the online menu and what was available though, and I would encourage them to get that resolved.  The drinking chocolate was pure decadence in a glass. While my wife loved her tea (most are flavored teas), it was painful seeing them displayed in glass containers. There is little question that it looks really nice, but it is a cardinal sin in tea storage as exposure to light can accelerate the oxidation process, causing them to lose their potency and flavor much faster. As a tea aficionado, I would make the recommendation to display the tea in smaller glass containers so that customers can get an idea of what they look or smell like while actually storing the tea in a dark, airtight container. The upshot, too, is that in the unfortunate event that they drop, tea isn't really wasted.   For our appetizer, we had these baked lemon chips. Accompanying them was a melted cheese, mozzarella mixed with goat, and it was topped with black lava salt (burrata was unavailable). The tanginess of the chips were balanced very well by the salt and the bitter sweetness of the cheese. It was a great appetizer, perfect for two or three depending on how heavy you apply the cheese.   We had originally planned to order the Steak Frites for dinner, but when the order was being placed, the server mentioned that the chefs are excited about the Pork with Mole and Orange Pepper Puree, wishing more people would order it. Admittedly, I was skeptical. First, I feel like I've heard these things before and have been met with disappointment, regretting not following my gut instinct. Second, I get suspicious of recommendations, believing that in many cases, they simply push the foods that have not been selling. Still, I gave it a chance, and WOW!!!! EASILY THE BEST PORK IN THE CITY!   We finished our meal with a salad as a palate cleanser before dessert. Even something as simple as a salad exhibited a great deal of care in its preparation with every single ingredient (including dressing) complementing each other. Everything was crisp, fresh, and cleansing. The dessert likewise was moist and warm without being soggy, and was executed incredibly well. I loathe when desserts are too sweet, too large, or drenched in sauces. This was not the case here. It was refined, elevated, and delightful.  In addition to the wonderful food offerings, the service itself was great. Our server always had a smile, and not once did I ever sense annoyance or agitation. I felt comfortable disclosing dietary restrictions, and she (and the kitchen) accommodated us as best as possible. The courses were well-timed as well. It's a pet peeve of mine when everything comes out at once or with very little down time between courses. I like to enjoy the company of those around me and the atmosphere without feeling rushed or overwhelmed. I felt like Cocothé handled this aspect very well.   I enjoyed everything about our experience and would not hesitate to do it again. It had the charm I was looking for on a Summer evening and they did their absolute best to make us happy. And it worked."}
{"text":"Back to one of the best in Sewickley (not what I would consider a high bar). This was one of our favorites. After the Asst chef took over we had one pretty average meal so were hesitant to try it again. The service has never been very good but the food in the last was very good. So we were pleasantly surprised either a great dinner both in terms of service and food. Feels like things were finding their groove and now if they can bring consistency with what they've got now I think this will easily be the best meal in Sewickley for a nice night out. Definitely on the higher end of cost but worth it if they deliver like they did tonight."}
{"text":"My husband and I celebrated Valentine's Day at Cocothe and enjoyed it very much! We started with drinks--my husband had the Kir Royale (Chambord & Champagne) and the bartender was kind enough to make a specialty \"mocktail\" for me (since I'm 8 months pregnant). Both were the perfect start to the meal, and the bartender was extremely attentive and accommodating.   We were served an amuse bouche (croquette and potato soup shooter)--very tasty/much better than just a bread basket (which was also good) prior to the first course.   We each started with the chopped salad--perfect portion size with great textural elements. I could honestly eat this salad every day.  Then, we shared the cauliflower risotto as second course; the kitchen smartly split the appetizer into two portions for us. The roasted beets were the perfect contrast to the creamy rice and cauliflower. Yum.   For the entree course my husband had the beef short ribs, which he enjoyed very much.  Rich and hearty.  I had the pork tenderloin with shaved brussels and squash ravioli.  Loved it.  The pork was perfectly cooked and the accompaniments rounded out the dish.   We didn't stay for dessert only because we had something planned at home.  We'll certainly be back soon!"}
{"text":"Four of us went to Cocothe for lunch today, and we were all pleasantly impressed.  The food was simple yet creatively put together and very good.  The ambiance was nice, and service was good.  Definitely the best meal I've had in Sewickley!"}
{"text":"Sewickley has clearly stepped it up gastronomically in the seven years I've been away.  I happened upon this small restaurant a bit down from the heart of the village.   The menu is straight forward and just extensive enough to cover most palates and cover them it does!!!  Wow!!  I had the lamb chops.   They were perfect.  The yam ravioli that accompanied is made entirely on site.   There were a few under cooked but none over cooked.   The chops were on this tangy Brussels sprouts deliciousness that complimented the sweet sauce on the chops.  Honestly they were so good.   But I have gotten ahead of myself.  The chopped salad was large and I ate every leaf.  I'm in a food coma and need to go chill now but if you want fantastic food and fantastic service (Amy you are the best) in a small local restaurant go to Cocothe."}
{"text":"This has to be the best lunch place in Sewickley. It's a great example of the high-end, yet casual, lunch trend that's definitely 3 tiers above Panera. Everyone needs to get the Fancy Bird sandwich."}
{"text":"Yum, yum, yum! The food is so fresh, so different and consistently delicious! I've head both lunch and dinner here and have not been disappointed...there are many restaurants in Sewickley...this one is a must try! From sandwiches and salads at lunch - the ones we've had are the Blue Barn sandwich, the Lex and Lynne and Keep Tahoe Blue salads - to dinner small plates (Scallops) and entrees (Steak with Chimichurri and Frites) it's all well prepared and so good."}
{"text":"This really is a hidden gem and I've been singing its praises to all my colleagues at work.  The food and service is impeccable, making it the ultimate dining experience.  It's a small venue from what I could see when I came here for dinner one night, making it a very intimate experience.  We were served french onion soup as compliments from the chef that tasted so rich and cream, not a typical taste of its kind!  We started with the Hamachi Crudo, a tuna tartar with caviar and mustard dressing, so delicious I was bummed I decided to share this appetizer.  I later concluded the meal with the blackened seabass over hot pepper cavatelli and ate every last bite.  We didn't have room for dessert, but they sent us back with homemade macaroons (raspberry and apple flavored) which tasted amazing.  Will definitely be coming back here, great place for special occasions!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious. However, the service was strange.  None of our food came out at the same time. The first person was done by the time the soup came for the last person.  Our water glasses were empty. The coffee was terrible. I guess since the tip was included there was no motivation. Go when you have plenty of time. We spent 1.5 hours to get soup and sandwiches at lunch."}
{"text":"I went to Cocothe on 8/18/17. The entire evening was awesome from being picked up by Ben (Uber) to an awesome dinner, cocktails, wine... and then a hysterical ride home from Lynda (uber). I had the veal which was amazing! The service was awesome. My allergies were accommodated! I can't wait to go back!   Thank you everyone!"}
{"text":"We stopped in for lunch on a Saturday while walking around Sewickley. Very interesting menu! We had a salad and sandwich with whipped goat cheese. Our meals were amazing! The flavors mix perfectly. Prices are very good and we will definitely stop back!"}
{"text":"I've been eyeballing Cocothé for what has certainly been about a year now, and I finally decided to treat myself to lunch over the weekend.  It wasn't busy, but there was a large party in the middle of the floor who seemed to be lingering over a delightful lunch.  I was seated quickly, and I chose to face the middle of the restaurant so that I could take it in.  The design aesthetic is rather austere, but not cold or uninviting.  The bright white walls are offset by the rather rustic able tops (think reclaimed barn doors), and the chandelier in the center holds its own.  Some local art work or photography would not go amiss if they ever did decide to add some color, but I digress.  The food is why you go to a restaurant, right?  I decided to start with a cup of coffee, even though I rarely drink it past the noon hour, I wanted to give it a try since this spot specializes in hot beverages.  (It was delicious.)  Then I tucked into a cup of chipotle tomato soup, which had just the right amount of heat and some of that chunky tomato texture that lets you know that you're not drinking Campbell's soup.  Great croutons too.  After that, I dug into a MASSIVE duck confit salad that was just fantastic.  Peppery arugula, juicy shredded duck, tangy bleu cheese, and honey, this salad was NOT over-dressed.  After all the coffee and soup, I could have stopped at half the salad and been perfectly satiated, to be honest.  But I also knew that the shelf-life of such a dish was so fleeting that I just went ahead and ate the whole thing.  It could have easily been split between two people with a cuppa soup each, or something.  I would like to return again, and I hope the they start offering brunch on a regular basis soon, because I'm sure they would completely blow away any other place in the Village."}
{"text":"Far and away the best restaurant in Sewickley and in the running for the best in Pittsburgh. Dishes here are incredibly thought out and very high quality. Make sure you take advantage of their suggested wine pairings. One of my favorites in the Pittsburgh metro area."}
{"text":"Absolutely the most amazing meal I've ever had. Hands down. The wait staff was so knowledgeable, almost couldn't believe how great it was. Delicious and 5 stars to the max"}
{"text":"Having lived in various places and dined all over the world, this restaurant, the staff, the creative cocktails and the food were absolutely amazing. We were greeted by Jeffrey with celebratory glasses of champagne (Vueve) in honor of our anniversary. Jeffrey was warm, engaging and professional. Rose our waitress was friendly, intelligent, knowledgeable, efficient, prompt and thorough. My husband has very specific instructions for his martinis and rarely in a restaurant are they prepared to his liking but the bartender created my husband's perfect cocktail. I ordered the Martini de France created with Goose, St. Germain & grapefruit and it was a delicious libation for a summer evening. The bartender stopped by our table to make sure our drinks were to our liking and that our dining experience was going well. In terms of staff, even the young man who provided us with water was once again friendly, engaging and efficient. We were never hurried during our dinner and in fact every member of the floor staff would check in on us regularly. Now to the menu...next time we will Uber in an effort to enjoy the 5 course food/wine pairing menu offered! In that we did drive, we each ordered an appetizer (oysters, tuna crudo, beef tartar), entrée (duck, sea bass), and dessert (key lime tarte, peach crème brulee)...everything was extraordinary. I cannot emphasize enough just how unique, fresh and delicious the food was. The presentation was also exceptional. The complimentary amuse-bouche & bread were also remarkable. As we left we were given macarons to take home.  Not only will we return to this restaurant consistently but I will encourage everyone I know to dine at Cocothe not only for special occasions but any day of the week they are open."}
{"text":"This is a great restaurant. It's a hidden gem and it's in Sewickley. The chef is amazing. It's the same chef they have had since they first opened up next door. It used to be in a smaller place but now it's next door and remodeled. It's very pretty inside with a black & white motif. Our waitress was very efficient & pleasant. The food was superb. The desserts were homemade too.   The only real negative comment I have is that the music was too loud. Otherwise, I highly recommend it"}
{"text":"This was easily a top 5 meal I've had in my life. The flavors were intense but paired so well. I would encourage you to try things even if they may have an ingredient you don't like- it will not taste like what you think it tastes.  The cocktails were delicious. The Phoenix is their take on a negroni and it was better than any negroni I've ever had. I had the seafood tartar, the pork belly, and the Seabass with seafood risotto. All spectacular.  Don't balk at the price. This is a restaurant for a date night and it is well worth it. Service and atmosphere were excellent."}
{"text":"The fiancé and I were looking for a place to have a cute date night and this place did not disappoint!  The food, drinks, and service were amazing!  I got the sea bass \"you should really get this\" which was blackened, served with hot pepper cavatelli, shrimp & crawdad cream sauce, and andouille sausage crumb. Fiancé got the New York strip \"melts in your mouth\" with a side of potatoes and carrots.  Fiancé raved the carrots were the best carrots he ever had . We finished our meals and our hunger was satisfied.  Of course... there is always room for dessert.  Homemade almond ice cream with a torte topped with chocolate ganache... Delicious"}
{"text":"I stopped by here a couple of Saturdays ago with my wife for dinner.  We had made reservations to Cocothe on OpenTable and since we were celebrating our anniversary I selected that box.  The outside of Cocothe isn't much to look at and and you could easily walk right past it on Beaver without really noticing it.  That's not to say that it looks bad but more that it blends well into its surrounding.  It's inside is really nice though and decorated chicly in mostly blacks and whites.  There is a large bar on the one side and the rest is all dining room seating.  As soon as we got there we checked in with the mater d and were immediately ushered to our table.  Then since it was our anniversary they brought out two complimentary flutes of champagne which I thought was a great touch.  So my wife and I toasted our anniversary and got down to looking at the menu.  For dinner on this evening my wife and I decided to each order an appetizer and split them.  I decided on the beef tartare while my wife went with the tuna crudo.  Then for my entree I chose a blackened sea bass on top of hot pepper cavatelli with a shrimp and crawdad cream sauce. Our waitress confirmed that I was ok with it being a little spicy before leaving the table and since I love spicy food, I was.  Whenever our appetizers came out I thought they were plated beautifully, especially the tuna crudo which had little squares of fruits (including dragonfruit) accompanying the tuna.  Both of the appetizers tasted nicely as well and I liked the creaminess of the yolks that came with the beef tartare.  My only complaint about that dish was that it was majorly under seasoned and probably could have used something else to give it some more flavor (truffle oil perhaps?). The tuna crudo was perfect though as the tuna itself had some great flavor and I loved pairing it with the little squares of fruit (acidity).  After we had finished our appetizers we had a little bit of a wait before our entrees came out.  Whenever I saw mine I got pretty excited as it looked fantastic.  It didn't disappoint either as the sea bass was cooked perfectly as it was glistening in the middle and had a nice crust of top.  It's flavor was pretty mild which paired nicely against the rest of the dish.  The pasta had a nice heat to it, as advertised, which I thought was perfect as you could taste the pepper and the heat lingered a bit but didn't overwhelm and could easily be cooled down with the cream sauce.  Speaking of the sauce, I found it to be flavorful with slight hints of savory sweetness from the seafood.  It was good enough that I ultimately ended up using the bread to soak up the rest of it and eat it.  Then for dessert my wife and I ended up splitting a peach creme brûlée which I don't think I have seen before.  It had a nice custard with the requisite sugary top and I was impressed that the peach flavor was present and yet not overwhelming.  The bottom line for me is that I would head back to Cocothe again in the future.  We had some good service and all of the food tasted great."}
{"text":"I want for a midweek business dinner so the restaurant was pretty empty.  The server, Loni, was fantastic and really helpful.  We ordered a variety of items and all were very good.  The presentation and attention to detail of preparation rivals big name restaurants I have been to in NYC and Chicago.  Four stars however for two reasons. The dessert choices aren't on the same level as the food and need work.   The restaurant itself is dark and oddly barren, not in a good way.  It detracts from the food quality.  The server indicated they were moving next door and adding a bar but hopefully some lights and ambience.  A little pricey but definitely a good choice for a small business or intimate dinner."}
{"text":"The outdoor seating has a nice, casual vibe. The menu is a little limited and pricey, but it seems fresh and creative enough to warrant the price. I had the salad and it was unique and delicious. The staff was friendly and attentive. It's BYOB which we greatly enjoyed. I would definitely recommend and go back."}
{"text":"My husband and I just ate here on Saturday, a belated birthday dinner for me.  We both had the chef's tasting menu, which consisted of two selections from the appetizer menu, two selections from the entree menu, and a chocolate mousse dessert.  We were told that the selections from the appetizer and entree menus were half the portion of their normal counterparts.  We both had the cauliflower risotto and foie gras mousse appetizers.  They were absolutely delicious and very nice sized portions.  For the entrees, I had the venison chop and my husband had the New York strip steak.  They were delicious and good sized portions.  We both had the lobster ravioli for our second entree.  While this was delicious, it was in our opinion, an appetizer.  We were each served with one ravioli.  Don't get me wrong, I did not leave hungry, not at all.  But if this was half the portion of the normal sized lobster ravioli, I would be extremely disappointed to receive two ravioli as my entree, no matter how delicious it was.    There was not a choice for dessert, a chocolate mousse was presented to us.  It was very good, but very rich.  I could only really enjoy a few bites of it, then I just couldn't handle any more.  My husband, being a chocoholic, finished his and mine.  We both would have liked to have had a choice of dessert. Because, although, he did eat the dessert, my husband has never been a big fan of mousse.  The fact that it was chocolate is the reason he ate it.  Our server was friendly and attentive.  For a special occasion, I would recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Actual experience: Went for Sunday brunch with my mom and Aunt. We were the only people in the restaurant. When we all sat down, it took the waitress about 15 minutes to get us coffee, actually only two of us wanted coffee. We ordered, my aunt and I ordered a very simple dish of 2 eggs and bacon. We both wanted our eggs over easy with crispy bacon. We both said please no runny eggs....after a rather long wait, again we were the only people there. We were delivered our meals. Both my aunt and I got runny eggs with soggy bacon with only 1 piece of toast. I was too hungry so I ate mine, but my aunt was grossed out and returned her meal. The waitress was no where to be seen. All we heard was the banging and clanging of dishes being down in the other room...not good. My mom wanted a cup of coffee and again, no waitress. Frustrating to say the least! We finally just shared our coffee with my mom. My aunt got her dish back, finally. Burnt runny eggs! Oh well. Gonna chalk this of off my list for sure! And it was too expensive to boot!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to eat here for a while because I enjoy French food and it's not available much in the Pittsburgh area.  My wife and I enjoyed a very good meal here last night.  The restaurant itself isn't much to look at.  The owners literally went into an old retail store, spread some paint around, added a few tables and called it a restaurant.  The only thing attractive in the entire place is the chandelier in the middle of the room.  So, when I first walked in I thought, this was a big mistake.  However, the food more than made up for the lack of atmosphere.  The food was wonderful.  Everything tasted great!  It was presented beautifully, and we both enjoyed everything we had.  The rack of lamb was by far the best I've ever had.  The quality, the presentation, and the attention to detail was far beyond what I expected from a Sewickley restaurant.  You won't even find this anywhere around Pittsburgh.  This is NYC quality food.  The service was ok.  The waitress did what she had to do but wasn't extremely friendly.  She took care of all seven tables so once the place was full, the service suffered.  In her defense, I think she was a little overwhelmed trying to accommodate the entire place alone."}
{"text":"Intimate, stylishly decorated and furnished. The menu is compact and well thought out. The wine list is designed to match well with the dishes prepared by Chef Dave. Our group of 8 was sat timely and drink orders delivered expediously. Water glasses and the bread baskets were kept filled by a well coordinated staff. Several amuse bouches preceded our first course. Each was unique and accomplished the goal of exciting our senses and tastes. Our group ordered many of the menu items. Each plate was beautifully presented and tasted delicious. Wonderful desserts and coffee concluded a perfectly serene dining experience. I highly recommend to anyone looking for a fine dining experience offering Michelin Star quality at affordable prices."}
{"text":"I would normally take a few pictures when reviewing a new restaurant, but not this time.  It would be a crime to rob you of the experience of seeing it the first time.  I've eaten French food in several states and countries and this place holds its own against any of them.  The cheese plate was perfect. The fois gras/moose was amazing! The venison chop was the best venison I've ever eaten."}
{"text":"There's so much in Sewickley I'm finally discovering - one of which is Cocothe. If you're looking for a restaurant for that special date or if you're just feeling a little fancy, this is the place. Everything from the decor to the atmosphere is super elegant and chic.   I would call the cuisine primarily American with some French influence. There are limited vegetarian options, so I had almost every dish they could give me. The bruschetta appetizer was delicious but nothing noteworthy. Take away all the frills of the fancy plating and it just boils down to some diced tomatoes and crostini. My first entree choice, the Ratatouille Manicotti, was a flop. Traditional ratatouille is a vegetable dish, so imagine my surprise when there was no vegetable to be found. It was ricotta cheese wrapped in a crepe and covered with mozzarella. Essentially, it's cheese covered in more cheese. Too cheesy and this girl gets queasy. I spoke to the waitress who kindly offered to get me the Chopped Salad. Although it wasn't great and only an appetizer, it was still filling and at least I wouldn't have the burden of a cheese overdose.  When it came time to pay our bill, I was a little salty about getting charged for the manicotti entree that I did not enjoy or eat more than a few bites. We talked to the waitress who said that her manager specifically said to charge us for the more expensive option which was the $21 manicotti over the $11 salad. I found that completely unreasonable, but we just paid it to not cause an issue.   Overall, I was not very impressed. Food was not good enough to justify the price tag. On top of that, getting charged for food I did not eat made the experience slightly worse."}
{"text":"We went for a five course tasting menu and we were not disappointed.  The food and drinks were fantastic.  They offer in-house smoked drinks, and I had a bourbon.  Up until then I thought the smoke-infused drink thing was trendy malarkey, but wow was it great.  A must try.  Each course was properly prepared and well executed.  I especially liked the Salmon Tartare dish that was one of the best dishes I've had, but the food is great at most restaurants of this caliber these days, so it's really not what sets Cocothe apart.  What made our dining experience better than most was the service.  The bartender, hostess and wait staff was as good as I've experienced.  They were knowledgeable, enthusiastic, friendly without being patronizing and on point at all times.  This crew could make a below the line meal seem good (not that the food was below the line - it was actually top notch) because of their service.  I highly recommend this restaurant because it's getting harder and harder to find great service and this is one place that will provide it to you."}
{"text":"Geoffrey did an excellent job. Food was awesome. All of the staff was great. We had the 3 course meal. Main course of duck and short ribs were the best we have had. I highly recommend this establishment."}
