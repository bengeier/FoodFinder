{"text":"Our company comes here to wash all of our cars and they are by far the best of the best in the business. For anyone looking to have their cars super clean for the lowest price, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Just Excellent. The owner is there working with employees and they clean your car in such great detail. And last but not least, the price is cheap. Would highly recommend."}
{"text":"Took my car here after a 1500 mile road trip.

No waiting on a Sunday morning at 11 am and the crew did a great job.

I highly recommend this business."}
{"text":"The best car wash I've gotten! They did an excellent job in just under 30 minutes. The owner is very meticulous and makes sure that you leave satisfied with their work. The prices are more than reasonable as well. Highly recommended and will be going back."}
{"text":"Best car wash in town!! They opened about 6 months ago.The staff is great!! They care about getting your car cleaned !!! Super affordable prices."}
{"text":"Great service and quick.  Thorough quality assurance.  A wonderful value and convenient!"}
{"text":"This crew are absolutely awesome, they are running a real \" restoration hand car wash \", ask for Francisco.
Look at my 12 years old Subaru !! No question ask"}
{"text":"Totally appreciate their work. My car arrived dusty, grime and dirty inside and out. After 20-30 minutes, I left with a car that looked like it just left the showroom. Well worth the price!"}
{"text":"I have been searching for a good car wash since I moved here and I have found one!! The guys here are so friendly and awesome. They made sure my car was clean and had me check it out before I left! Decently priced $24 for the inside/ outside and tires. (They may have done more) All I know is my car came out shining and the inside was very clean. Definitely going back!"}
{"text":"After all the snow & rain we had here in Las Vegas. I was in need of a good detail. Came here with my GMC Acadia and they did an excellent job. The guys spent an hour making sure the car is to its showroom best. I did the $29 wash and $39 hand wax. I was not disappointed. Will return with my Jeep next"}
{"text":"I'm in Vegas from Cali. Needed a quick wash. Don't let the little building fool you. They did an EXCELLENT job inside & out. For a very good price too! If we were locals this would be our spot."}
{"text":"Very detail oriented and hard working staff. Chris, the owner, is very professional and made sure that his staff did a good work on my car. The price is reasonable, too. I would definitely come back to this place."}
{"text":"Great job you guys! You got me in quickly and you even pushed my car through when you thought I was out of gas haha. Great value, great service, highly recommended! I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Confirming all the other five-star reviews ... Vegas Voyager-approved!!

My car was done in just over 10 minutes. Twenty bucks for an in&out (ie, inside & outside). The only other menu offerings are exterior-only for $12 and a hand wax for $40. Add $5 for SUVs & trucks. Add $10 for Armor-All in&out.

Just seconds after I pulled my car into their bay, four energetic employees swarmed upon my vehicle. And all four stayed at it until it was finished. I noticed one or the other of them back-tracking to double check their own work, door jambs, windows, whatever. 

And, yes, the car looked superb. 

The $20 deal included tire dressing, cleaning the wheels, vacuuming the trunk, etc., items that at other car washes are costly add-ons.

Ok, now the venue itself isn't much to speak of. These guys have commandeered one of those no-touch, robotic cinder-block car wash bays at a Sinclair gas station ... and are using it to do hand washes. Then they do the interior and other details after they drive the car out of the bay. There's nowhere to sit, no music playing, no conveniences of any sort. So I just walked over to the gas station's convenience store about thirty feet away ... and by the time I picked out a drink & snack, my car was all but done.

To quote a former California governor ... I'll be back!

UPDATE: I've now been back for the hand-wax special. That includes the outside only (add $10 for the inside). 

Awesome. Pull-in to drive-a-way was about 25 minutes. 

They are using a liquid squirt-paste wax that hazes (and so requires serious hand-buffing), NOT that 'quickie' liquid spray wax that goes on clear (and wipes off easy). 

At the end of the job, they spotted some overspray from recent paint work ... and worked to try to rub it out with some compound, without me asking. 

While I waited, I saw a very-new gray Corvette drive through for an exterior-only wash. So apparently people with high-end vehicles are quickly coming to trust this venue as well.

Accordingly, this venue is even more highly recommended upon this, my second, visit."}
{"text":"No complaints, cozy chairs to wait for by the shade and several people cleaning it at the same time helped me leave faster. Really clean inside and out! Definitely coming back"}
{"text":"Absolutely hands down the best hand car wash in Las Vegas 
Francisco is the man
I take 3 cars to him every week
Its worth it everytime"}
{"text":"Came here when I just got into town from driving from Northern California. I called the car wash, the owner was very kind and accommodating. I came by and was in and out of the wash within 20 minutes. They pay attention to detail and make sure you are satisfied prior to leaving. Thank you! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"They did an excellent job! I've never seen my car this spotless in years. I really recommend them to everyone."}
{"text":"Looked up the best Car Wash in Vegas on Yelp and this spot turned up as number one. So we drove to it and were kinda surprised to see the set up but I talked to Chris and he was straight up about pricing so I opted for the full service. They went to work and we left the car to them. We went inside the Sinclair station and were treated very well. So we returned outside and were pleasantly suprised about the condition of our vehicle. Every area was meticulously cleaned, checked and rechecked. I cant say enough about the great pricing.  In Cali this type of detail is at least $60. Chris and the crew hooked it up for half that price. 
Botttom line is if you need your ride detailed and dont want to feel like you got fleeced. Take it to Chris."}
{"text":"**Update of Cyber Bullying 5/22/18** I received a very hateful message by a user profile w the name \"clueless\" w zero friends and no pictures (this was an account someone set up for the purpose of sending me some hate mail). They berated me and defended the business, adding in what a great guy the owner is. Told me I am clueless and basically to F off. Obviously this was the work of the owner himself or a friend of his. Wow...so unprofessional!! 

 I'm not sure what all the hype is about. 
I got my car washed here today and I definitely was NOT impressed by this place over any other car wash. 
First of all, the price advertised on the wall for my wash was $20 but they told me it would be $25 because my car was pretty dirty. I have a hatchback so it's like the size of a golf cart, but I agreed to pay the 25 because they insisted it would be a really great, thorough wash. 
When it was done I came out and had to point out at least 10 spots on the outside to the guy that didn't seem very happy that I was pointing out spots to him. Also some spots they missed vacuuming the inside. And, they forgot to put the air freshener in. I still tipped him even though I feel I was overcharged for the wash in the first place. 
Service wasn't that great- I'm not sure if these guys were hung over or just didn't really care about my business but I got no warm and fuzzy or level of professionalism...
I definitely won't return."}
{"text":"Amazing job. Took the time to make sure every last drop was gone. 

From the first moment I entered the bay to to when I drove away, they were friendly and attentive. Much attention to detail, inside and out.  

Highly recommend."}
{"text":"They did an awesome job on my new Silverado. This is my new car wash!! 
They pay great attention to make sure I was completely satisfied."}
{"text":"Don't even bother going anywhere else. This is simply the best car wash I've ever been to. Great hand car wash by a team who truly cares about the quality of their work. I'll be back again and again."}
{"text":"They did a great job cleaning my car- clean and efficient. Very friendly staff."}
{"text":"Some of the pumps don't work because the screens are smashed. The car wash is open 24 hours which is pretty cool but it doesn't even have it a brush so it's just a wash my water squirting at your car. Also this wise doesn't even have a working LCD screen you just have to assume you entered the code and that you entered the code correctly as you can't see what's going on. If you need a car wash in the middle of the night you might as well go here but if you need a car wash in the middle of the day make sure to avoid this place. It was better inside where it was clean and neat but outside it's kind of ghetto."}
{"text":"This car wash is the best!!! Super fast and detailed work. Great customer service. Francisco and his team are awesome! I can get the exterior of my car cleaned for free at the dealer's but I prefer to go to Sinclair to support these guys. Thank you for your great work!"}
{"text":"Great place. Hard workers. They have a good team and the owner is working hard right beside his guys. This is my spot from now on.  Support small business!!"}
{"text":"They make food here! Yes it's a deli inside they also sale beer. They provide you with great staff who will educate you on meats and cheese if you have never had them. It's a nice little spot to stop in and get gas and also coffee or cups of Ice and we all know I love Ice. I give it five stars total."}
{"text":"They weren't even done washing and waxing my car, and I was already writing this gleaming ass review.

My car, a Subaru, literally looks better than the day I bought it. This place is top notch and very reasonably priced for the level of service. It's the equivalent of having your boots spit shined.

Without a shred of doubt, come here to get your whip hosed. Sounds dirty but it ain't! It's clean as you can get, inside and out. And yes, they clean the jambs and the exterior crevices. I could have picked this shit apart down to the engine, and no spot was left untouched."}
{"text":"Took my truck in for a quick wash, was in and out w/a truck cleaner than when I bought it! Can't say enough about these guys they team up & get the job done, I wouldn't take my truck anywhere else!"}
{"text":"This place is the place to go if looking for a quick but very detailed and very nice Car wash ! Would recommend to anyone out there with all types of vehicles they will take care of you and will be amazed with the results ! Definitely give it a try, will be back for sure myself !"}
{"text":"Well they try their best.. but im very particular to details and tried this place because its a \"secret gem\".. but still dont pass my 5 star. Some spots and stain inside my leather chair... spent $80.00 though. Wont go back there again.."}
{"text":"Great wash, great price. Now have a very clean vehicle. Definitely going back with my other vehicle."}
{"text":"Amazing guys Esoecially Francisco! So knowledgeable! I will come back because you know all the secrets to make tiny scratches go away"}
{"text":"Update :  have been back a couple of times since my first visit. Always happy with the outcome but today I went back to get my truck washed and the price has always been $24.99 and today it was $29.99. I mentioned to be person who greeted me that the price has always been $24.99 and be said there prices have gone up. I get price changes, but for that price I can pay someone to my house and wash my truck there. I left. 




Came here on a whim. Nice guys. All were hustling and no one was kicking rocks like a normal car wash. No jack ass trying to fix my window either. 

Truck looked great when they were done.  I did ask them a couple times to wipe off some the tire dressing and they sort of did it, but not really. I drove down the street to Home Depot after my wash and the tire shine stuff had spun up all over my truck. When done at Home Depot I went back and they came right over and asked me if something was wrong. 

They cleaned it off and wiped the tires down. A gentleman came over to me thank me for coming back so they could make it right and he told me \"we are not perfect, but we are trying \". Hey, that's all I could expect. I'll be back and would recommend. 

Note : there is really no where to sit, except two older chairs, but they move very quickly. I think I was maybe 25 minutes in and out, which is quick for a busy Saturday morning about 9 am"}
{"text":"Watching these guys clean my car right now. I asked them to do a good job on the inside and they are really going to work. They found a weird spill/stain on one of the mats and asked if I wanted it cleaned. I said yes and they are doing the best they can to get it clean. I am impressed and will definitely come back. Be sure to tip these guys, they deserve it!!"}
{"text":"We recently had our new Dodge truck detailed inside & out. They got us right in & finished up in the time frame they quoted us.  They are very thorough.   We will definitely take our truck back there."}
{"text":"I came here for the first time a few weeks ago and was very impressed with the work and the customer service. I came for the second time today. Although the drive is a bit further for me, the results make it totally worth it. Would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"By far, the best car wash in Henderson. This is the second time that I am at the carwash. The crews wash your car quick and super clean. I want the higher package but Christian told me, your car is only 6 months old and don't need Armor because if you put Armor which will damage the new finish. I highly recommend to this place to everyone. Will come here every month now."}
{"text":"Yaaaaas. Even though its 8 miles away from my house, it's centrally located which is convenient for anyone in the city. My car was SO NASTY from taking in off-roading in Sedona, and I waited about two weeks before getting it washed, so I'm sure taking off all of the caked on red dirt from my white care was not an easy task. 

In about 20 minutes my small SUV was finished inside and out and it looked AMAZING. About four people were hustling getting everything from the floors to the tires clean. $20 (because I didn't need my trunk vacuumed or detailed) and I left so happy. 

Unfortunately the next day it rained :("}
{"text":"The employees here are always so friendly! I normally don't expect much from gas stations, but the people that work here are great. 

This is also my favorite place to get my car washed because they have an automatic car wash which is really convenient. The car wash prices range from $4.99 to $6.99. I usually get the $4.99 job because my car comes out looking nice. When my car is particularly dirty or if I want to impress someone, I'll spend a couple extra dollars ;)"}
{"text":"I've been looking for a good car wash to remove all the bird poop I've had on my car for a while (i drive my car to Arizona almost every weekend) and this place did the job! They left my car spotless and shiny and took every inch of my worries off! Paid $20 for exterior and interior. Left satisfied. Will be my come to after long travels. On top of that their customer service was superior, before i left they told me if i was to find any problems with the wash after leaving to come back and let them know. Amazing job."}
{"text":"Came in from San Diego and didn't want to drive back in a dirty truck. I have a 2018 Black F-150 crew cab and I know that it's difficult to have it just right after a car wash often times disappointed. Friendly staff and the supervisor Chris walked me around the truck to see if everything was to my liking...it definitely was! For the price and service the best car wash I've been too! Come out and support your local business :)"}
{"text":"Best car wash I've had. You can tell that the guys working here take pride in the job they do. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Fantastic place! They do everything right and I'm extremely particular about my car. They have great attitudes and make your car really shine! Prices are extremely reasonable too!!

This is definitely my new go to spot."}
{"text":"Went today.. can I give 10 stars?????? They were really busy, didn't skimp on the car. Fast still, listen to requests. I love this place!!!"}
{"text":"Ok, so I'm from out of town and read a few reviews for hand car washes.  This may be the best hand wash I've ever been too!  Also very quick, just a little longer than an automatic car wash and a way better deal.  Auto Carwash for 10-15 bucks (which my truck won't even fit in) and here they did my lifted (3/1 on 35s) black Ram 2500 for 20 bucks!!!  And after they were done it's the best the tricks looked in a long time.  I don't care where you live in Vegas it's worth the drive!"}
{"text":"Website says they open at 8 am. Called yesterday to confirm they would be open on the holiday. It's 8:10 am and no one is here. Gas station attendant has no way of reaching anyone, and doesn't care because car wash is a different company. So, no way to find out when someone might be here. Complete waste of time driving here. Will not return."}
{"text":"Older store but clean and friendly staff! (Meant store is clean but the staff seemed groomed well also)"}
{"text":"This car wash is nothing to look at, but that doesn't matter because you won't be waiting long anyway. They were so fast at washing the car I barely had time to get a drink inside the Sinclair gas station. I walked out and was worried that it wasn't going to be a good job considering the short amount of time it took them, 20 minutes - maybe less, but the van was clean inside and out and done really well. The price is reasonable and I have already been back 3 times with no complaints."}
{"text":"Fast, friendly, reasonably priced, and best of all no scratches! Drive thru car washes will ruin your car. Don't do it. Hand wash is the business."}
{"text":"They pass my 5 star review! 
I loved it got there gave them my car, got the delux and fell in love with their work. I have been looking for a new car wash and now I will be washing my car there all the time.  They finished with in 30 mins and they did a GREAT job. They are very Friendly and nice best car wash I have been too, I am very picky when it comes to my car. I loved them !!"}
{"text":"Was in & out within 20 min. They really focus on the small details. I will for sure come back."}
{"text":"I came here because of the good reviews. Once I got there are and saw the small car wash at a gas station I was skeptical. 

My F150 was filthy after traveling across the country through, snow, dust, sand etc. Plus our dogs were in the back so there was dog hair everywhere. I honestly wasn't sure if this place would be up to the task. 

However I was pleasantly surprised with one of the best car washes I've had. They really took their time and went over every detail several times. I saw at least 3-4 people clean the mirrors for example. 

I would definitely recommend this place if you need a GOOD car wash."}
{"text":"My Jeep has been several off-road trips in the desert and it was in rough shape. Looked great when they were finished, and were pretty quick about it."}
{"text":"If you need a car wash, do yourself a favor and go here.  My car had tree sap all over it from my Texas Olive tree, UGH!   Francisco, the owner assured me he could get it all off and the car would look like new again.  He and his team went to work and did a fabulous job on it!  I appreciate the personal service and expertise.  The place itself looks like a self serve car wash but the end result was that of a complete detail.  A normal hand hand wash is $25.00 but I also opted for the hand wax as well as the special care to get the tree sap off.  He gave me a fair and reasonable price for it all.  I am impressed!
As a small business owner myself, I always support other small business owners especially when they obviously take pride in their work.  
I will definitely be back with my other vehicles!"}
{"text":"Amazing job! They were fast and thorough. Not a fancy place but I will be back for sure. I'm super picky about my car and cleanliness and these guys did not disappoint!"}
{"text":"Chris was professional and took care of the brand new Toyota Camry that was being photographed for an award show in no time. He had four guys working on the car inside and out and really had a sense of urgency knowing I was in a hurry.

Chris is a small business owner, and I was glad to support this young man providing EXCELLENT HAND WASHED SERVICE.

Thanks again Chris. SUPERB. PROFESSIONAL."}
{"text":"Being very particular of my new sports car and being admittedly to lazy to wash it myself I found this place on Yelp and took it in today
Wow it was awesome it's a no frills place but the quality of the wash was excellent and only 20 bucks
The guy in charge was the owners son and when it was finished walked the car with me and pointed out if there was anything they missed to make sure I came back to get it done
Do t waste your time at theses places that might charge a few bucks less but really dont care
These guys are awesome"}
{"text":"Drove in from SoCal for the weekend & we were looking for a business that did 100% hand car wash. Thank you Yelp reviewers! We arrived & we're greeted by Fransisco, he had 4 crew members washing, drying & detailing the car. Definitely paid attention to detail. Francisco did a final inspection before releasing us. Less than 20 minutes, we were driving off in the shiny car. 

Will definitely be back next time we're in Vegas! Excellent customer service and they will earn your trust & repeat customer loyalty."}
{"text":"These guys are awesome and know the meaning of HARD WORK. I have never found a car wash that does the kind of detailed cleanings for only $25! I'm from California and it's unheard of, especially with such great prices! Thank you guys for making my baby look like new again."}
{"text":"Wash and wax for $40. In 30 min. They did such a quick and good job.  I'll be back soon"}
{"text":"Just found this place on Yelp today, rarely do I review places but this review is well deserved. If you saw the car before the job these guys did you would be shocked at the difference. 5 stars all the way and I will be back."}
{"text":"This is a Sinclair Gas Station and Convenience Store that has a full service deli inside. They have great food, and have excellent service. I regularly order take out in advance for large meetings. Thank you Lisa for great service."}
{"text":"OMG. Francisco and his crew are just the best. Gave me a really good deal and detailed my car in less thank 30 minuets. I would not have believed that was possible if I wasn't sitting there and seeing them work. Great place for a take your car for a wash any time."}
{"text":"I have no idea why these guys got the 1 star. This dudes were sufficient and quick. I told them I had about 20 mins and Chris said we got you. His crew jumped on the car quick, 4 dudes hella quick. Chris even asked me if I didn't like anything, to come back let him know and they would take care of me. I don't see any problems with it car looks clean inside and out. Definitely going back."}
{"text":"The best hand car wash I've been to so far. I used to go to Alamo to wash my car, but they weren't putting the time and effort that I wanted. Tried this place out for the first time the other day and they were amazing. Great customer service and $20 car wash for both inside and out! They finished washing my car in maybe under 15 minutes. There are some hard working guys at this car wash! They made sure that my car was spotless and even reassured me that if I found anything that wasn't up to my standards that I could tell them and they'll fix it."}
{"text":"I've been to this location several times.  At least 3 out of 4 visits I walk out with a smile due to the customer service and friendly employees. Great job!"}
{"text":"I've been needing to get a car wash/interior cleaned for about a month so I decided to search on yelp for some places close to my house. I found this place right away and hoping that it wouldn't be crowded at 4pm on a Monday, I went in and was immediately greeted. I had the exterior washed and the interior cleaned as well. There was no one ahead of me so my car was ready in about 15 minutes. For the cost and the quality of the service, I give this place 5 stars! I will be returning soon!"}
{"text":"I ain't gonna lie but this hand car wash is worth the price. I've been in so many hand car wash and this one is the one I'll keep coming every single time I need my car wash. Y'all should give it a try, is worth it"}
{"text":"Recently moved to Vegas from Hawaii && got my first hand car wash here. Amazing job with amazing price."}
{"text":"I was recently was recommended to this car wash and I loved the work.  The attention to details was amazing since my car needs that extra car. Totally worth the drive. I do not usually give reviews but they really earned it."}
{"text":"Definitely a hidden gem if your car is no longer shining like one. The staff is polite and super fast, but detailed.

This is my new go to and #1 recommendation. I'll miss the days of not having to wait long once more hear about his place!"}
{"text":"This place...these guys went the extra mile to get my truck to shine! Thanks to the owner- the scratch I put on my truck was 90% buffed out!  The rest I get to handle with a body shop!"}
{"text":"LOCATION LOCATION LOCATION: Located on the corner of  the busy intersection of S Pecos and Russell Road. They are situated right next to a gas station which has a deli and tables where you can get out of the heat and sit and buy refreshments while you're waiting on your vehicle to get detailed or washed. The employees inside the convenient store were very nice and greeted me immediately as I stepped into the store. There is also a smog testing booth next  to them as well. 

SERVICE: I got lucky this afternoon around lunch time and was able to pull right in and get my car detailed and on a Friday too! Francisco and his crew of 3 was able to hand wash and wax my car in about 25 minutes! The team was very professional and did a fantastic job bringing the shine out on my black car. My car didn't really need much attention on the interior since I keep my car very clean any ways but the exterior needed a nice coat of wax. Make sure you do a good walk around of your vehicle before you leave in case they've missed a spot or two. I found a few spots they missed and they fixed it immediately. Don't go home and complain and write a bad review when you could have had them correct it right there on the spot. 

PRICING: Very reasonable. Washes start at $11.99 and up. My service cost me $35 and I gave them $50 which included tip. It was about 115 degrees out today and they deserved it."}
{"text":"This place is the best, the staff is very courteous and attentive. I take all my vehicles here even though it is out of the way from my house. My cars always look so good afterwards and the guys tell me if I notice anything that they missed to please bring it back and they will correct it."}
{"text":"Excellent hand car wash service! If you don't need a car wax, the deluxe car wish is only $20 and takes about 15-20 minutes. They are fast and good!"}
{"text":"Amazing!!!

These guys are so good. I think six of them worked on my car at once and they did an incredible job. The first time I went, I took my sleek black Volvo coupe. They made my car look like it did the day I bought it! Then I bought a super old Honda CRV used and brought it to them. They made my baby shine!!

The best part is the price. Seriously, you can't beat $20 for an exterior and interior clean. They vacuumed my seats, hooked me up with an air freshener and cleaned all of my mats for an extra $20.

They're also super nice, professional and friendly. And QUICK!  I absolutely 100% recommend this place."}
{"text":"This is the best place to wash your car!! Francisco and his staff are amazing and hard workers!!! He always check by himself all the work the guys do, I always have a great time there! My car was so bad inside and now looks like new!! I don't know what the other lady was talking about because on my car they took off all my car spots including some white paint (my car is a black Nissan Murano) all my carpet is clean, my seats and everything inside!! I did a detailing and was very impressed and satisfied with the price and the work! I did before in another place and payed $180 for full detailing and was not included the engine (there was overpriced)  not with Francisco! His price was more than $50 dollars less including the engine and they did a great job !! I did before a regular car wash there too and payed $25... is a reasonable price comparing to other places but the work for sure is the best!! It's 12 miles from my house, but I drive happily lol specially after wash my car!! I rightly recommended this place!! Thanks again guys!"}
{"text":"This is the best car wash in Vegas- friendly and fast service, leaves your car super shiny and clean. Will do inside and outside very cheap. I love that they're careful and don't break/scratch my truck like some other car wash spots!"}
