{"text":"They have a good selection of vegan and tasty vegan food.. I been here multiple times.   The only time I was disappointed was when I went 1 hour to closing time on the weekend... Majority of the food was gone.. only a small selection was left.."}
{"text":"Best Vegan Vietnamese in GTA. Every time I'm in the area I stop in and indulge in the huge hot table selection and dessert."}
{"text":"I can't believe I lived in the area for 4 years and only discovered it a month before we moved out.  Regardless, we came here about 10 occasions upon our discovering this.  It deserves more than 5 stars because the flavour just tasted so good.  My favourites were the lemongrass tofu, mixed tofu, bean curd rolls, drumsticks and shrimp tofu.  The only downside is that I've came on a few occasions where they ran out on a lot of the foods prior to closing so I was thoroughly disappointed.  The lady there is very friendly and I would love to go back here when we are in the area."}
{"text":"Seriously a hidden gem in North York! This place is a small Vietnamese vegetarian restaurant/takeout/counter. I walked by it a few times and didn't think much of it but always wanted to try. My boyfriend and I finally decided to take a try at it and we ordered off the menu on the wall. I ordered the bun bo hue,and he ordered the bun rieu. Both noodle dishes were spot on and you really would not think the whole dish is vegetarian. I have no clue what they use to substitute the pork and other meat but it is darn delicious. I know vegetarian mock meat, a lot of it is soy based. I wanted to ask the lady that worked there, but never got to it. Another thing about both of their noodle dishes was, I felt hungry after an hour! (It's super light food)  I decided to also grab some of the banh xu xe, these green soap-like pillow looking cakes that have mung bean filling and a tapioca exterior. Think of it as a chewy, glutinous/jelly-ish like dessert. It's a little hard to explain...so just take one and try for yourself! I think it was 4 for 2 dollars...but anyways it was cheap!  I highly recommend any vegetarians out there to give this place a shot. It's worth the trip. Oh and remember! As most Vietnamese restaurants are, it's cash only!"}
{"text":"This is a vietnamese vegan restaurant ran by a family. My mom has really gotten into the tofu scene lately, she will usually get a box of their plain white tofu every week. They are very consistent in their tofu quality. I'm not a huge tofu person in general, but their very nice and helpful cashier/ waitress girl, Jenny recommended me getting their mixed sweet and spicy  saut√© tofu and it was absolutely to die for! The flavouring is great, one of the first items that truly made tofu an eyeopener for me. It goes great on rice, and even a green salad surprisingly! Jenny is so helpful in explaining to me any questions that I have about their ingredients. Its also always lovely having a quick chat with her! I always manage to run into her, as she always works on Saturdays. She sometimes even gives me a couple extra pieces! Quick tip, be nice to her and she'll definitely hook you up! That's what you call good customer service! After you finish your meal, definitely try one of their vietnamese desserts. One of the absolute favourites is Che Chuoi, also known as a vietnamese banana che/pudding. An absolute pallet cleanser after a full meal. The prices are great too with the majority of the items being under $10, especially for a vegan place in toronto, which can often be quite expensive. Will be ordering from then again for sure!"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem. One of the best vegan Vietnamese joints in the city! Everything is super cheap, fast and delicious! There are only 2 tables so it's mostly a takeout kinda joint. They also have a hot food table with all sorts of yummy vegan goods like drumsticks, smoked duck, spring tolls, stir frys...etc.  CASH ONLY."}
{"text":"Pretty good, the vegan food is really good. The food makes it taste like real meat. Totally recommend trying it. The only reason why it loses 1 point is because the staff doesn't seem to care. One woman who works there was like \"Why is it so busy! I'd rather it be slow, I don't wanna see any customers\" I found it rude that she said that while customers were in the store"}
{"text":"The service is nothing but friendly which makes me always want to come back. I work in the area so coming by for lunch breaks are frequent.   They offer a variety of different tofus. They are a Vietnamese vegetarian restaurant while they have their already cooked meals in the front for you to order, there is also a menu where they'll freshly cook it for you to either dine in or take out.   The banh gio is good. I always come by for that especially for just $2. Sadly they ran out yesterday :(   I ended up getting spring rolls (4 for $1)  two different types of tofu on a bed of rice and sour soup on the side!   She always hooks it up, and the food is good   I highly recommended mamas tofu"}
{"text":"The noodles and the tofu duck are excellent choices. The tofu duck is just as tasty as a meat substitute, and is very close in taste and texture. Noodles were excellent texture, not too saucey but still fluid.  The chicken and shrimp were okay. I would probably get the duck, noodles and veggies again."}
{"text":"My favourite place to get tofu. My family n I frequently come here to grab some tofu and bring it home to enjoy. Its convenient and close by.  Would have given it a 5 but sometimes they are closed unexpectedly and sometimes they run out of food when it's not even close to the closing time which is pretty disappointing but other than that the food is good :)"}
{"text":"This is such a cool little place in a part of town you wouldn't necessarily frequently visit. Great little restaurant with some excellent and unique menu options. There's not a ton of space but I imagine most people just order for takeout anyway. I think the place is run by a family and their friends, and they're all very kind. I really like that they're located in a place that offers something new and unique for the neighborhood. You can get a range of your typical Chinese cuisine and also some other great items. Give it a try!"}
