{"text":"It's funny, another yelper mentioned a great ambiance - but I guess it's not to my taste. I don't need silence when eating my ramen, but the music was way too loud. It's not really enjoyable when you server has to yell at you, and you have to yell back for them to hear you. To make matters worse, there was awkwardness at the communal table between the random couples (yes I've sat at communal tables before without issue). Thank goodness the food was better than I expected! If it was just based on food, I'd have given it 4/4.5 stars."}
{"text":"I am not very brave when it comes to food, so when I ordered food here, I got the one that was most familiar to me. (wonton chicken ramen) It was absolutely delicious! Ordered to go, so they give you the soup in two different containers which I really like, because this way the wontons don't get soggy. Also got a Jinya bun, pretty similar to a pork bun, which was really good too. I would definitely recommend if you were looking for a great soup fix!"}
{"text":"We have Brussels sprout tempura, gyoza and ramen. The gyoza were fine- nothing out of be ordinary. It was great to see the Brussels sprout tempura which was quite tasty. I had the vegetable ramen which had surprisingly great flavored broth given it was not the usual pork broth. Other table members had pork based broth which they said was good but missing the complexity of other ramen shops in the city. The toppings on top are basic. A good meal  that we would go back for if in the area with a craving for ramen. Otherwise we will probably make the drive to some of the other spots in town"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place. The atmosphere and ambiance were particularly inviting to me. Great ramen, nice music. The staff was really attentive and sweet :)   I got the tonkotsu black ramen and I loved loved it! This is definitely a spot that I'll enjoy recommending to my friends. I was too stuffed to try the desserts that looked so delicious but I'll have to leave room next time I visit."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is chill and rustic theme. Sitting is average size. The kids meal is generous for your little one. Happy Hours 3:00-5:00pm and 10:00-12am. We had the Jinya Bun and Jinya mini tacos pork chashu with kimchee. Food was bomb as fuck of course with a Sapporo in hand. I will be back!"}
{"text":"First time here, first impressions are that I love the music and ambiance. The service has been kinda short and rushed but the food is AMAZING. Best Ramen in town imo!"}
{"text":"Terrible customer service. Was just on the phone placing an order and the lady(used loosely) was rude and disinterested in doing her job. I've worked in this industry for over 20 years and this person just had awful customer service. Never again Jinya! One ramen customer lost. Too bad because I enjoyed their product. Oh and make sure to tell the total bill to the customers once the order is placed, kind of helps both parties involved. Makes for a smoother transaction. Probably won't be picking up that order I just placed."}
{"text":"This is easily one of the best ramen places I ever been too.  Been over a month since I've been here and I've thought about this place everyday. If you're in vegas it's a must.  Service, environment and food are all excellent. .I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"These guys at late night crew are the worst!lots of people waiting ,bunch of open tables but they still making people wait.step Up your game! The way I see it they dont Know what there doing.its frustrating to wait here.they need new managers.no sense of urgency! food is pricy!I will give one server the 5 star though.she was the only one we see that was moving fast.but the rest are of the crew are super slow.been here before but I rather go to other Ramen places."}
{"text":"Went on a Monday evening and got a table without having to wait. Super delicious food! Prices are very good for appetizers & desserts especially. The takoyaki is also amazing. Totally recommend it!"}
{"text":"Have been here a few times. They make a excellent bowl of Ramen. It's the second best that I've had in Vegas for Tonkotsu style Ramen behind Monta Ramen. Being open late is a huge plus."}
{"text":"Been here a few times now and every time they have managed to mess up my order and charged me for it. Every time I tell them and end up waiting even longer. Taste wise it's pretty standard, nothing I'd rave about, they're pretty lucky they're the only ramen open late."}
{"text":"Food was good but the customer service is worse than a seedy vegas strip club giving happy endings in the back. I don't know where these people were raised or come from but they need some training or get out of the service industry. You're location is in a city that businesses come, go and be re-branded with a quickness. I don't know what's wrong when you want to rush out a patron who is paying for you and your family to live out the door when they are walking to the WC. Then these dreads who trying to run a business chain double charged my credit card intentionally not by mistake because you don't want the likes of me in your establishment, fraudulent/money stealing sneaks I will be reporting you.  The nerve to be discriminatory."}
{"text":"Always good when i come here. Love the quinoa salad and apps here. Ramen has a huge variety to choose from! Not bad for a franchise."}
{"text":"Me  my husband and closest friend decided to try this ramen place because we heard it just open up. Interior look very nice ,loud.   Me and my husband decided to order gyoza , spicy tuna roll for appetizer. Pretty good for appetizer. My husband drink cold beer and mimosa for me..  Ramen?! Hmmm.. I order tonkotsu assari and ask the server no green onions but she serve it to me with green onion arghh I don't like my ramen with green onion even though I'm Japanese lol. The broth is pretty good. The men cook OK. Just the green onion upset me so bad because our order took long time to come out plus she put green onion in it..  My husband ordered chicken ramen , broth very bland. Buy he enjoyed the gyoza he said ;).  We ask our waitress what's on their curry she said CELERY lol.  After our meal everybody just relaxing and drinking mimosa and beer probly my friend drink 8 mimosa lol. Then the waitress came to give us the check without asking us or anything she's pretty rude for doing that because weren't done.and we feel so rush. I give them 2 stars because the server binay we know him and his the best without him there I probly out 1 star;)"}
{"text":"So glad Jinya is in Vegas now! If you love the thick Tonkotsu flavor this is the place to go. Service was good, except for our waitress didn't know what restaurant she worked for? She kept saying \"Chinga Ramen\"? I know they just opened and all but it's a big turn off,"}
{"text":"Jinya Ramen Bar has a really interesting set up with a large table in the middle of the room where multiple parties can sit as well as smaller tables lining the dining area. We had a group of 6, so we basically took up a corner of the large table. Not really ideal for seating.  For starters, I decided to go for the Jinya Pork Bun, which was amazing, as well as the Pork Gyoza, which was actually really good, probably the best gyoza I've had at a restaurant. For the main course, I had the Tonkatsu Black (Jinya No. 1), which had a very rich pork and garlic broth that felt a little salty at times. The pork and egg in the bowl was delicious and pretty much melted in my mouth.  Overall I think I would come back here again to try some other items on the menu."}
{"text":"The takoyaki here was absolutely amazing. It taste really good like it was melt into my mouth. Overall is great and I love this restaurant."}
{"text":"The ramen was not too bad and gyoza was pretty good The rest was a disappointment We ordered the Brussels sprout tempura and it smelled funky Could be the oil or the batter The jinya bun tasted ok, bun was not fluffy enough and saggy, and the braised pork didn't have enough fat in it would have been better Nobody came to ask how the meal was so I didn't provide any feedback right there and then But here it is Maybe they had just opened up only one week, possibly needs some time to iron out the kinks"}
{"text":"One of my favorite ramen places in Vegas! Try their spicy chicken ramen with thick noodles, I always add corn and an egg. You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"First time here Ashley was my sever. She was pretty good point out which dishes are the popular ones she was every attentive"}
{"text":"Everyone was friendly. The food came out fast and tasted wonderful. The chefs would always talk with us it made the night more enjoyable I would definitely go back.   The decor was really nice it was kinda dark inside at all of the tables. The only place that had light was at the bar.   We did make it in time for happy hour from 10pm to midnight. There was another time for happy hour but I don't remember"}
{"text":"Love these off the beaten path gems like Jinya Ramen Bar.  The food AWESOME! Definitely start w/ the Jinya Bun; it's slice of tender pork belly with veggies and the Crispy Chicken.  Follow that up with Gyoza dumplings ooooooo wee that's real good eating!!!  This will be one of my new hangouts when in Vegas!!!  Kudos to Jinya & the staff excellent customer service and great food!!!"}
{"text":"Screwed up the bill...manager thought it was funny... no apology...she needs training 101.  Noodles only OK, was suppose to be spicy, but it was not at all. Moreover, the broth was nowhere near as flavorful as last time. Ambience good.  Music good.  Not sure what this restaurant wants to be when it grows up but I hope someone can figure it out."}
{"text":"AMAZING!!!! The BEST Ramon... Full of flavor! Perfect noodles!! I got spicy pork and you can choose your spice level.. And they nailed it!!! The gyoza was the best we have ever had state side. Great service!! Fun atmosphere. Not enough good can be said! We will be back again and again. This is the Ramon shop we have been searching for! YUMMMMMMMM!!!"}
{"text":"Great noodles and broth. Had the #3 mild . It was outstanding. Best ramen in town. Much better than ramen Sora."}
{"text":"Greatest bowl of ramen I've ever had in Vegas. My boyfriend and I try and go once a week. Decent prices and the spicy paste you can add is what makes it perfect. Always fast service and the food never takes more than 10 minutes to come out. I always leave happy and super full!"}
{"text":"3rd time here because the tonkatsu asari is yummy, it has a sesame flavor which I love.  Other ramen we've tried here: cha cha tastes very good but too oily for me, chicken ramen is a great alternative to traditional chicken noodle soup, and creamy chicken ramen also good but I prefer tonkatsu asari over it.  I ordered the $12 lunch special for my chicken ramen (half portion) comes with rice bowl, gyoza, drink and dessert--filled me up and tasted great!  I only gave 4 stars because the noodles are not as good as Sora (in my opinion).  Service is friendly and tables always clean when we have come."}
{"text":"Tasty Miso Veggie Ramen soup! Many additions that can be added for $1-$2 extra. Really enjoyed the broth, noodles (thick) and their version of a \"seasoned egg\". Service was alittle jumpy and \"over attentive\" at first, not really giving us much time to review the menu- but there are certainly worst things! (Like being ignored when you're starving and ready to order :) ) Seaweed salad pretty standard. Also has a veggie roll and spicy tuna sashimi. Both solid.  Late night happy hour! $3 sapporo pints and $3-$6 apps. I would return if ever in Vegas again."}
{"text":"I've been to other Jinya's before. This one is my least favorite. It's tiny and the customer service is underwhelming. Expect to wait 30+ minutes for a table. It's dirty and dingy. The food is good as usual though. So if you can get past the other stuff it's worth trying."}
{"text":"I want to live across the street from this place.  Thank God they stay open late for those nights when you leave the strip and want an inexpensive and filling meal.   If you like ramen and can handle a wait from time to time, eat here.  The chicken ramen is amazing.  You can customize your order to your liking. There are great appetizers and sides.  Check out the menu.    We took our family that has never had ramen here and they loved it.  Mind you, they are picky eaters and tend to hate it before they eat it!   No complaints from anyone."}
{"text":"Had a great lunch here today! Excellent service.. out server was very sweet and attentive.. vegan/vegetarian options which was a huge plus as the other ramen places we looked into dis not have a veg broth without meat.  Kid friendly.. we had 4kids with us and it went great thanks to the awesome kids meals they have!! So many items in the kids meal to keep them busy with a lollipop and dessert! Definitely recommend this place! Shrimp balls were delicious and everyone loved their ramen!"}
{"text":"Awesome late night Ramen. Our server, Igi, greeted us immediately; explained the menu and was patient for any and all questions we had for our first time being there. The wings were amazing & our ramen bowls were massive! I got the JINYA Tonkotsu Black & my boyfriend got the Spicy Chicken. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"I go here specifically because they have vegan ramen. And even better, it's spicy and creamy, and you can add extra veggies to it. AND the best part is you can order seconds of noodles!! They do that Japanese thing where they yell at you when you walk in, which is startling at first, so prepare yourself. Service is always snappy. Even when there is a line it moves quickly. Eat here."}
{"text":"Good and Authentic Ramen. Great place... Great Ambiance.. Great customer service... you have to wait to be seated but worth the wait..."}
{"text":"With 4* we decided to try this ramen spot out, but I was highly disappointed. There were only us and another group of people in line. The hostess asked if we wanted to sit in the center table, which is a communal table. We said no we wanted a booth, but not less than 10 min, she asked again if we wanted to sit at the center table. I honestly think she forgot that we requested a booth. Anyway once we were seated, our waiter told us about the menu, but the music was a bit too loud and we couldn't hear him too well.   We ordered gyoza because they ran out of the jinya buns that other Yelpers were raving about. Hubs ordered the pork chashu and he thought it lacked flavor. I had a taste of the pork and the first thing I noticed was that the temp wasn't hot enough, it was just warm. I waited more than 5-7 min before my ramen came out and having to wait that long got me a bit irked. I had the cha cha cha pork chashu ramen. I liked the thick wavy noodles, but the noodles were broken, not long like other ramen places. Another disappointment was that the broth was very thick and tasted very rich. I know I ordered the pork broth, but it just seemed fatty. I've had other pork broths at different locations and I've never had it this rich. I couldn't even finish it and my hubs didn't even want it. The positive thing was the seasoned egg and our nice waiter. I don't think I'll be frequenting this place anytime soon or again. We literally had to rush home just so I can drink some hot tea to wash it all away."}
{"text":"Love this place! Right around the corner from my house and open late! The Quality is great and the service is always fantastic.  It's little more expensive than other ramen places but worth it"}
{"text":"By far my favorite ramen bar!! I should mention that I haven't tried Monta, but that's because I can't get enough of Jinya.   Service is incredibly fast, and even when there's a wait, it moves pretty quick. I always get Tonkatsu Black with and extra egg and a Jinya bun.   Late night hours are also really convenient for me. Just a great place overall."}
{"text":"Ramen was amazing and the waiters served the food quickly. Tonkotsu black is the best!"}
{"text":"Decided to meet up with a friend here for lunch. Despite my first 15 minutes in this place waiting by the door because I wasn't able to sit until my whole party of two people were there, this place is pretty good food-wise. The prices are really good in my opinion, $15 total for drink, salad, Cali roll, and ramen was great. I still prefer Sora because I feel their broth is just so nice and rich, and they have a much nicer service. What I didn't like is not being able to sit at a table when I was only waiting for one other person and there were seven empty tables and the place wasn't busy at all. It was also pretty funny when the couple behind me had complained about not being able to get seated when it was just them and they were staring at a wall of empty tables."}
{"text":"Check this out! Ive been coming to this place for two years and never been checked on twice!! I dont give a shit i love the food the food amazing !! I barlly use yelp . And today angela the server she might be new bc she was the shit!! She checked on us 3 times!! And smiled and actually showed some love!! So this experience made me download yelp again!! Good shit angela!!"}
{"text":"JINYA needs to get its shit together. This used to be my favorite Ramen spot in Vegas but the customer service has completely deteriorated.  I just got done waiting 45 minutes to potentially be seated and still had 6 groups in front of me.  The managing of customers waiting needs to improve if I ever come back here.  Not one person greeting people at the door, 0 communication, empty tables that SHOULD be in use, and people are just sitting around at their table staring at their check.  I decided to leave and I know a lot of people did the same after I told them about other places to eat around town. If you're reading this,  bored as hell in line at JINYA, just leave and go to Pho Kim Long or Sora down the street. At some point,  you have to recycle people out and get new people in or at least reassure your customers that you fucking care. Unfortunately JINYA has become a joke. Embarrassing."}
{"text":"I've always loved the concept of ramen but as a vegetarian things don't always go as expected. Sometimes I order vegetarian ramen and it tastes like noodles in water with some mushrooms thrown in for good measure. BUT THIS was the best vegetarian ramen I've ever had in my whole life. It tastes so nuanced and hearty and savory. I was shocked. I added the hot chili sauce a few bites in and things got even better. I also got the caramelized cauliflower and it tasted AMAZING like nothing I've ever tried before. I felt extremely full and very very happy, would highly recommend."}
{"text":"Its better than Monta Ramen ! Just bcuz more people are waiting in line at Monta doesnt mean they are have quality ramen soup. I think this place is fairly new, how new idk, but the noodle taste better, soup is dense enough where its not salty. Jinya has more stuff put in the ramen bowl than other places I go to. Gyoza is very tender and tasty, its fresh. Next time i go, ill get some other stuff bcuz this was just my first time and I just wanted to try their ramen. If youre in sin city again,and want some ramen, Jinya is the place. You dont have to be in the crowd just to fit it."}
{"text":"OK, so...I've been going to Jinya for a while. Like, a few years. I've had almost everything on the menu, and honestly don't expect much from the staff. I used to love the food, but lately the quality has gone down. I've had maybe two or three servers deliver good service throughout all the times i've gone. But man, tonight might've just ruined it for me. So on a weekend expect to wait 30-45 minutes. I really don't care, it's not the staff's fault, and I'm used to waiting the long periods of time. So we sit down, me and my bf order three beers, but our server informs us she can only give us two, and we have to finish them before we get the third. Weird, since she didn't even card us. Strange (and fairly new, at least they never did that before) policy, but it's not her fault. We get our jinya buns, which were excellent. It was all downhill from there. We ordered the salmon poke tacos, which are normally better. These were utterly soaked in whatever marinade they used, it spilled out of the taco and completely overpowered everything. We got the spicy creamy shrimp tempura, and it overall it tasted good. But the takoyaki was a complete mess. Not worth the money at all. Not worth anything. It disappointed me because I had wanted to try it for so long. It was extremely bland, it had the consistency of soggy stuffing with very little actual octopus, and there was no egg tartar... only a mess of mayo and sauce as a 'bed'. And the California Poke bowl... another thing I had wanted to try for so long that was a huge let down. The portion of spicy tuna was incredibly small- the amount of ginger they gave me was actually a bit bigger than the scoop of spicy tuna. Couldn't even eat it with the rice because whatever sauce they used they just decided to get a giant ladle and pour it over. I had to leave 1/3 of it because it was actually sitting in a pool of sauce!! They gave it to us with spicy mayo which was very thin- more like a liquid mayo based dressing. The dressing tasted alright (we used it to make the takoyaki taste better- actually like something instead of bland soggy bread) but it was no match for the sauce they used in the bowl. I would have complained, but our server never came back to us once we ordered. Another busser/server took our plate away too quickly to get his attention. I'm not sure if they didn't hear us over the insanely loud music or they were just ignoring us. It wasn't until 15 minutes after we finished that someone (a different server) came up, realized we were missing a drink (the beer we never received), and got it for us. Again, all too quickly to talk about how bad the food was. He came, and just dropped off the beer and receipt at once, and hurried away. I gave up trying to get their attention. Not once did anyone ask me how everything was, how the food tasted, how my experience was, or anything. Only thanked me after paying. As much as I loved Jinya, that was probably one of the worst food experiences I've had. And no, we never did see our server again."}
{"text":"Good stuff. I like having all of the different options for ramen. I also liked that they have other things like wings, sweet potato fries, etc. I would totally give it a five star for the food, but the place is a little small which causes the wait to be long. We had to end up sitting at the huge table in the middle with strangers which didn't make for private convo. We could have waited another 20 mins for a table but we were hungry. Also I chose this place too because of the review of the tempura Brussel sprouts and they didn't have any when I went. Shame."}
{"text":"My company added one of the air conditioning units for this space. It is a great area for good quality asian food. Great atmosphere and great prices.    The staff is very friendly and the fact that many of the workers are japanese makes it feel authentic. Lol  Good location.  Close to my office.    I would have no problem coming here almost every night of the week. Good drinks and a nice multicultural costumer base."}
{"text":"First time coming here and the food was alright. Seating is a bit of a tight squeeze however, so the distance between strangers and myself was a bit close for comfort. The servers can come off a tad loud and aggressive as well, but are direct and to the point. They made sure to repeat back the order to us.  Overall, would eat here again but would not go out of my way to visit again."}
{"text":"Best ramen I've ever had in history. Great service, not to expensive, and great food. I came while it was busy so it was a little slow but despite that great all around"}
{"text":"excellent food over all. the place was full of nicely dressed, hip, young college to young adult generation. the ambience is great! but i'm picky with smells -- i'm not too happy when my clothes and hair smell like the restaurant's kitchen after leaving... for that i would reconsider going back... since there are at least a couple of other ramen restaurants that are on par with Jinya's food.  so if you plan to go somewhere else after eating at Jinya just know that you're gonna smell like green onion whether you had them or not!"}
{"text":"This restaurant was really cool, never seen anything like it. The food was great, fast and friendly service. Just wish there was somewhere to sit while waiting. We stood around akwardly for about 20 minutes before being seated. A little bit clastrophobic."}
{"text":"I have to show some love for jinya!! They satisfy all my late night ramen cravings. Great service, great food. I keep coming back! Keep it up guys!!!"}
{"text":"I'm not really sure what the hype is about this place because it has been a long time since I've been this disappointed with ramen. I went last Saturday at around 6pm and I was told that they already ran out of thin noodles. I ordered Brussels Sprouts tempura to start. It didn't come with any salt or dipping sauce so it was really dry and boring to eat. My Premium White Tonkatsu was nothing amazing; broth was not as rich as I thought it'd be and the noodles were okay, not bad. Worst thing was I only got two very tiny pieces of pork (the pork was very tender and soft though). I was not full nor satisfied, so I ordered mochi for dessert. I seriously had way better mochi from T&T - they were hard and artificial tasting. Jinya is more expensive than other ramen places in Toronto, which is fine IF they actually delivered. Not worth it."}
{"text":"Love love love!!!  This place is amazing! The service is excellent and the food is great! I actually prefer this place over Monta only because I am completely in love with The Cha Cha Cha bowl here. MUST GO place here in Vegas."}
{"text":"The ramen here was fantastic. Went great with the large amount of Japanese beer we ordered.  Noodles were cooked to perfection and so good I drank the soup!"}
{"text":"The Ramen wasn't bad at all, I would give 4 stars just for ramen. I give this place 1 star because service was terrible.  First, there was about 7 people waiting at the door and hallway even though there were about 8 or 9 seats open and clean table with chopstick and napkin already set. The waitress doesn't start seating those open seats until she's finish talking with her friend.  Second, while waiting to be seated the kitchen staff comes out from the kitchen and start taking a dinner break and starts eating at cashier just by the entrance where customers are waiting to be seated.  Third, when I ordered KAEDAMA (extra noodle) it took about 30min even the people who ordered extra noodle after I did was getting it. I asked why and seems like there was miscommunication between the cook and waitras. The waitress comes to me after talking to the cook says to be it should be ready in couple min without any apology.  I will never go back to this place."}
{"text":"SO SALTY!!! I ordered the miso, took one bite and it was soooooooo salty. I asked for a cup of hot water and it didn't help. They took off 10% when it wasn't even edible. Save your money and go to other ramen places in the area."}
{"text":"Took a long time for food to arrive and when mentioned to staff they pretty much called me a liar. Food was more expensive than other places and I got only one piece of pork and less noodles. I won't go back."}
{"text":"So after a few friends on yelp and co workers went to try this place I had to give it a shot.  I actually got here early...they open at 3pm and I got there at 2:45.  Apparently starting tomorrow they open at 11:30am.  Or rather on the first.  Anyways, I was greated right away.  I was the only.person in there for awhile.  Granted I got there right when they open.  They apparently.have specials that last until a certain date.  Thats nice to.know.in case you LOVE the special you know they will have it until a certain time.    I had the tonkonsu ramen black, gyoza, salad, and the squid balls.  The salad came out first.  It was mixed greens with some dressing.  A typical salad.  The squid balls came out next.  It was good and filling!! It was 6 pieces...with lots of sauce.  I never had anything like this before so I cant say it was the best, but awesome choice.  The squid was hot but I found it to be cakey with some bites.  Still good just texture.  Gyoza came next.  Nothing spectacular.  Then the ramen.  By this time I was getting full.  The both is nice.  I like the chasu and the egg.  The noodles...meh it was aldente.  I like my noodles soggy or a little but softer.  But it was good tasting.  Just not what I was excpeting.  It was the thinner kind...im thinking maybe I need to try the thick noodles before I truely render my verdict about this place.   Overall good customer service.  The waiter filled.up my water...and was attentive.  The food was good but I didnt like the way my noodle was...perhaps I needed a pork chicken broth but based on what I had it was good but not spectacular.  I guess I prefer monta..."}
{"text":"Instead of giving us the sitting the host gave it to a party that wasn't in the restaurant when thier name was called and thier name was crossed off...  waitress has an attitude.  Seriously?  Been coming here for awhile but tonight have been terrible service.  No refills on hot tea, asked for a bowl and the waitress turns around and forgot not even 2secs after, I had to asked another waitress."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a great ramen place in Vegas, Jinya is the spot. It's not too far from certain hotels. Prices are good, especially for the amount of food you get. They also have HAPPY hour just look at the back of the menu. I get the Cha Cha Cha every time I go it's for garlic lovers! It's a very rich broth and lots of topping and flavor. The only downside is how small the place is, wait times for parties bigger than 4 can be awhile."}
{"text":"First time here, the waiter was nice and kept coming back to make sure we were doing ok. The food was great! Recommend getting your ramen spicy for an even better flavor."}
{"text":"Decided to check it out shortly after the grand opening. I found it was very loaded with sodium and MSG. I have never had any issues with sensitivity to MSG in my life but after eating the Cha-Cha-Cha Ramen dish I could actually feel how swollen my tongue was. Ordered the gyoza as an appetizer and it tasted as if they had been cooked in dirty oil and was nothing notable.  I have since returned and tried two other dishes (Tonkatsu Black & Spicy Umami Miso) they had much lower amounts of Salt / MSG and were more enjoyable. The fried chicken and Pork Chashu Bowl are both great. I'd almost rather just eat these than the ramen.   Every time I have visited one part of the order was mistaken or wrong. The service is probably the worst out of any ramen place I have been to and is definitely bottom of the list over all for service in Calgary."}
{"text":"Nice decor inside and out for world wide chain.  Food good not great and higher priced.  Hiromaru better tasting for similar price.  Monta much better bargain.  Music here was so loud could not have conversation.  Who comes to these places to listen to loud 'club' music?  Hard seats need cushions.  Too many better places so would not return."}
{"text":"Wonderful food, we ate here while visiting Vegas and the food was amazing. Great service as well."}
{"text":"Jinya is the more American approach to ramen in the sense that there's room for alot of customization as well as various appetizers and sides that can accompany these dishes. The fact that this place is open until 3 lends itself to becoming the go to place for locals in the industry. The vibe is always a modern sexy type of feel with the rustic interior design, open ceilings, and dim lights lit by tastefully designed gastropub esque lighting.   Service: This place gets very busy and there's usually lines out the door at times and sometimes it's faster to eat at the spot then getting it togo as togos can take up to 2 hours or more sometimes. With all that in mind the service could still be better as once they take your order you'd be hard pressed to find them again so you have to make sure you get everything you want in. They tend to forget alot of things sometimes as well which is annoying as you have to flag them down in a sea of people at times while your food gets cold. But the servers are all friendly and nice but the execution is like I said hit or miss.   Food: There's alot going on in the menu and sometimes it feels like it's too much. There's alot of gimmicky food items on the menu but the main dishes are all on point.   Appetizers: The takoyaki is one of my favorite dishes and we always make sure to order it. The ratio is perfect and the way it's fried and drizzled in the sauce as well as topped with plentiful amounts of nori/onions is enough to get the mouth watering. I don't really bother with any other appetizer, but I have tried the Jinya bun which is good but a little pricey for what it is.   Ramen: The ramen served here is creative yet sometimes to a fault. There's certain ones that offer alot of toppings and stuff but when eating you realize you didn't even need or necessary enjoy the toppings with your ramen. We like to keep it simple with the usuals being the Tonkatsu white and Spicy Chicken Ramen. The broth here is more heavy and definitely more oily but still delicious as sometimes one craves a more intense flavor profile. Adding the fresh garlic makes the ramen 10x better (beware of smelly breath after). The noodles are more darker and is definitely better when stirred in with the broth. Egg and Chashu is the usual affair where it's very soft and melts right in your mouth. Kaedama is always good and they let you swamp the noodle types which is nice if you ever feel like switching it up.  Jinya is definitely a great spot to take a friend who's never had Ramen as there's such a variety and customization option that they're sure to find something they like. The modern interior is also very cool and is definitely a unique place to slurp ramen in. Jinya has become a staple in the Las Vegas community as attested by the lines out the door during peak periods and is a great late night option."}
{"text":"Food is good, The management is horrible. The girl Tomimi or whatever her names is. Doesn't have a clue on what she is doing. The service is kind of slow. I ate there twice and both times The next day didn't feel so good.. My stomach was acting up. I wouldn't recommend this place. I would rather eat at Monta until the management gets better. My servers when I ate there were Brittany and Keoni. They were really great . They kept checking up on me and really seem like they knew what they were doing. The guy always made sure I had drinks and made sure everything was alright real great hospitality.. The girl did the same they worked really well this was the second day they opened. The next time I went there I got a different server who did alright he left me hanging a couple times which is the reason I feel this place deserves a lower rating. Foods good management not really and some servers are good some aren't so much. If you go there ask for Brittany or keoni I think that's what his name was."}
{"text":"Excellent! One of our favorite places. Our favorites are the black with curry rice and salad as sides. Love everything about Jinya. Excellent authentic ramen with great service."}
{"text":"One of the best ramen places in Toronto. I ordered the Cha Cha Cha and it exceeded my expectation. Also, the tako balls are a must try. I would definitely recommend this place to ramen lovers."}
{"text":"We had stopped coming here since last year due to bad service but decided to give it a try tonite and I'm sad to say it hasn't changed.  We started off by ordering the crispy chicken appetizer and our waiter said that it would be happy hour within 10 minutes and he could place it then so we agreed.  In the meantime we each placed our order for ramen.  We got our ramen but not the chicken even after we finished eating the ramen and by that time at least 30 min had passed from the time that our waiter said he would place that chicken order.    Another server saw that we needed water refills and said he would come back with it than our waiter also passed by and offered to have it refilled but minutes passed and no refill...finally that other server realized he forgot and came back.    We finally asked for the check and we weren't charged for the chicken appetizer because it obviously was never placed.  As we were leaving I told the server and he said \"do you still want it?  It's coming out\" and I said \"no\" because clearly we were leaving and how could it be coming out if it was never placed.  There are so many other ramen noodle places in this city that provide much better service than this one!"}
{"text":"Best ramen noodles hands down... reminds of my time in Okinawa, Japan.   Awesome restaurant!"}
{"text":"I had a Ramen craving so I checked around on yelp and found this bar. I was greeted right away... I like that. My server was Rachel, very sweet and knowledgeable when I asked her questions on the menu. I ended up ordering this...(picture) yummy, thick noodles, so good...then paired it with this... (picture) and ordered extra noodles but I got full and ended up taking the noodles home.  My hubby ate it 24hours later and he said it was delicious! I will be back. This bar is busy...when I left, there were guests waiting outside... love the vibe..Great Service!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in to try a new place for us. The server was very helpful with one picky person we had with us. The ramen was amazing. The only complaint I have is that it isn't closer to me! A little on the pricey side but not so much that I would complain about it. The shrimp balls were delicious also."}
{"text":"Finally found a place better than Monta!  Never thought i would say that.. Ive probably tried every ramen place in this city and this is it.. Great service as well.."}
{"text":"I have been there for many times. The food and services were good except for this time. I requested for non-spicy for my ramen but the ramen came up spicy therefore I had to ask for a changed.  After I got home that night, I got food POISONING. And their ramen was the only thing I ate that day. And I have been throwing up for two days since then. Not gonna come back for sure."}
{"text":"Tight space. Order spicy chicken ramen and gyoza. Order came out quick and tasted great. However it exited the digestive system as quick as it came out the kitchen. Not sure what it was but something didn't sit well."}
{"text":"The ramen is okay but the appetizers tasted better. I still think Ramen Sora is the best ramen place in Vegas."}
{"text":"After trying to give this place multiple chances, the 3rd time was the last straw. Worst customer service in Calgary. Rude and inexperienced wait staff every time we've been here. Will not be coming back."}
{"text":"Awesome food every time I have been here and being open late helps due to getting off of work at around 11 every night"}
{"text":"came here at night around 8pm. Place was decently busy but we got a seat right away.   atmosphere is great. service was great. portions were higher than normal.  however quality was lacking a bit.   we got the jinya spicy chicken, cha cha. cha and the third favorite one. all were just simply good. not great   something was missing in each.  overall its alright, bit pricey for ramen. 13-15$ and no free toppings if u post on social media.   Would prob not come back again."}
{"text":"Broth was delicious! I just couldn't figure out why they brought out all of your extra orders on side dish plates instead of just throwing it in the bowl with the soup. Made it cold once the soup came out but other than that it was delicious!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick bite. The Brussels sprout tempura was really good. The ramen was really good - we both had the black. Taking the leftover home to enjoy later. Staff was friendly and quick."}
{"text":"Jinya is the best ramen shop in town. I've been trying every ramen place in Vegas for the last 10 years. Sora, Monta and Ichiza have been my favorite to date with subtle differences that make each unique and about on par with each other. However, Jinya is on another level completely. Jinya has great ramen and offers a variety of broths that are complex and delicious. Most ramen places offer half a dozen add-ons or less. Jinya has a huge add-on menu (20+ options) for the ramen. They have a decent tapas and basic sushi menu, the brussel sprout tempura is crazy tasty. And they have a legit alcohol menu that has craft beers (stone & ballast point) and even a lychee-tini and  mimosas and some nice wines and sake. The decor is like minimalist contemporary and there's always hip jams playing to create a groovy vibe. There's a small section of bar seating, about a dozen tables and one huge group table that seats about 20. I've tried the vegetable ramen, which had so many vegetables I was kinda overwhelmed in a good way. I've also had the spicy chicken ramen, which was so good I actually said while eating \"goddamn this is good ramen\" like 8 times while I was eating it. I hate giving gushing reviews of places I legitimately like because I don't want them to become more crowded, but Jinya is hands down the best ramen in Vegas. If I could get them to change anything, I wish they offered chicken yakitori as a side. Enjoy."}
{"text":"The waitress was wonderful and attentive. The food was delicious. My partner and I both ordered the veggie ramen. The broth was lacking in flavor. However, the waitress provided fresh garlic and a few sauces. We were able to add the seasoning items to our personal taste. This place wonderful from the service to the food."}
{"text":"Awesome food and atmosphere!!!thanks Bond!! Ur service was amazing we had a great time. Definitely coming back here!!! Best Ramen in town"}
{"text":"Such a great place! Big portions and I loved the spicy chicken ramen. Great atmosphere and super great service! Definitely going to come back often!"}
{"text":"As near to authentic Japanese raumen as you can get. Outstanding service. The 2 times we went there same good service and tasty food. Prices reasonable. Good place."}
{"text":"Excellent ramen & takoyaki. At decent prices as well. Would come back everyday if I can, especially for the takoyaki. I mean it's $4.80! It's a steal!  Customer service is also a thumbs up. Very well appreciated by the waitresses. They also do bill separation with your pals when you request for it.  Atmosphere is a plus. Might be a bit small but it's still good."}
{"text":"Food is great, but the service is mediocre.  I've come here a few times, every time the food taste great.  The noodles are cooked right, the broth is rich and flavorful, and the toppings are tasty.  The price is a bit on the high side, but food this quality of food, it's worth it.  The problem with this place is the service.  There were a couple things that happened to me on the few times I've come here.  The first time I went to this place, there was no service.  I went around 11:15-11:30, just before the lunch rush.  The place was about half full, and they sat me down on the bar stool facing outside.  I quickly decided what I wanted, since I scouted out the menu ahead of time, but no one came by.  I use the western style of signaling - my menu was closed, indicating that I am ready to order.  About 10 minutes went by, no one came around.  I thought to myself, fine, Asian ordering style them.  I waved at the nearby waitress, indicating I needed service.  She saw me, turned away, and went to get the server that apparently was in charge of my section.  \"So it is western style after all... at a ramen place.\"  2nd time I went, the servers could not decide who would be serving me.  A waitress came and took my order after I sat down for a few minutes, no problem there.  After I ordered, another waiter came over and wanted to take my order.  I told him, I have already ordered.  Then it became this double service where the waitress comes over and ask how my food was, then the waiter would come over and does the same thing.  Also, the waiter was really trying to hard sell me extra food, even when I told him that I was full.  \"How about some ice cream or desserts?\", while I think to myself, I just told you that I am full when you asked if I wanted extra noodles...  Another time I came with some friends about an hour before closing time.  The food was great again, all of us enjoyed it.  When the bill came, there was an 18% auto gratituity slapped onto it.  We only had 6 people in the group, and nowhere did the server or the menu mentioned about an auto gratuity.  I understand that usually when you go to restaurants in a big group, there is auto gratuity, but it's definitely a first for me to have auto gratuity at 6 people.  And at a ramen restaurant.  It would've been nice if the server told us that, or if that was written on the menu.  I'm not against paying tips, it was once again weird coming from a Ramen restaurant.  I probably would go to this place more often if it weren't for those experiences."}
{"text":"Ramen Sprout set + curry rice  Oily soup broth and fried vegetables on top makes it even more oily. I could not tell the base of soup if it's pork bone/miso/salt/soy sauce at all. The best part is marinated egg.  The chasiu slides are fine. Overall quite disappointed as previous comments said delicious.  Curry rice (supposed chicken) also very generic, no protein/veg could be noticed only like curry sauce + rice. Staff are friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"I've been to here few times ! every time I come here  , I ask please make sure my soup is HOT ( I'm mean temperature ) but every time I get like room temperature soup .... I really hate any kind of soup coming to me lil cold !!!!!  Price is lil expensive for the ramen ... But they open until late ....that's good  And taste of food is good !!!!! So I jus happy if they give me a very hot hot soup ramen"}
{"text":"I had a supper disappointing experience here with my colleagues. We went to celebrate one of my colleague's birthday, and two of us are vegetarian and she (birthday girl) eats halal so we were excited to have the creamy vegan ramen. Unfortunately, they told us that they were sold out of that. We tried really hard to get them to work with us to figure out what part of the creamy ramen was sold out, and see if we could get the vegetable broth from the only other veggie option with the toppings/incredients of the creamy garlic since they weren't sold out of that.... but they said it's company policy not to do that.   We were so frustrated and it certainly put a damper on her birthday celebration. Don't promote having a vegan/veggie friendly option (rare for ramen places) if you're not actually going to support those customers!   I don't think we'll be back, as the other veggie option is sort of gross. Salad on top of my ramen? No thanks."}
{"text":"We got hungry and craving  for some ramen.  I saw the good review and decided to try it out.  We were a group of 6.  It was quite busy but worth the wait.  Been to many good ramen place and this can be added in the list.  Our waiter was nice and friendly.  I can see myself coming back again with group of friends or family ...so yes, I recommend this place."}
{"text":"So this is my first attempt for Jinya. They were in LA and decided to try Vegas. So here I go.  I ordered Tonkotsu Ramen with extra noodle and extra broth. Comboed it with 4 pc gyoza and curry rice bowl with salads.  Salad came first. Salad is spot on.  The gyoza and the curry rice came next. This was already 11 dollars. This was not worth it but the taste is good but I feel I can get the same thing somewhere else for a better price.  Now the Ramen. Took while to come out and we waited and waited while we see our friends take theirs to their stomachs. But anyways, here we go.  The charsui was plain. Seems like it wasn't marinated for a day or 2 like most traditional Japanese charsui are made. The tops are great and presentation of the Ramen is great. Taste of the broth is good. It is up to participate of what a Tonkotsu Ramen is.  My bottom line is that this is a regular ramen bar if you want your ramen fix. The ambiance and presentation of the food is what's attracting the customers. As for the pure taste it is great, right between good and excellent/super."}
{"text":"If you like ramen, this place provides flavorful broths and you could add whatever in your ramen.  The atmosphere is nice but they play their music too loud.   Togo order is recommended"}
{"text":"Our Ramen go to place. Just be sure to get there before the rush around 8.. small and quaint but food is full of flavor. Another must try place in vegas..."}
{"text":"Short: Lacked flavor, but good place.  Long:  Arrived here after noon on a Friday. Not the best area for a ramen shop, and not that many people in (though I've been to better ramen shops with less people). Service was a bit off as the girl didn't know how to welcome a guest in Japanese (said ?????? rather than ???????? which was kind of funny). Menu is rather typical for a shop specializing in tonkotsu ramen. Black tonkotsu ramen with extras being their specialty so I ordered that ($11). Food came out rather quick for being a little busy (not as quick as Monta roman when it's not busy though).  When I say the food lacked flavor, I do mean it. I've been to Monta (one of the best restaurants in Vegas, IMO), Hiromaru and Fukamimi that all do tonkotsu ramen, and each have their cravats. For Jinya, the whole bowl just lacked that strong punch of flavor you should get from tonkotsu. The chashu pork was nice, but wasn't seasoned enough and lacked flavor. The toppings were the usual deal. But the biggest let down was the soup broth just did not have a strong richness to it. In fact, I think it's thickened with corn starch to help it become thicker rather than letting the richness of the broth support it. Other than that, nothing really stood out.   Is it terrible? No. And there's many other things on the menu that people might like.   But for a ramen shop, there's a good list of better places out there like Monta, Hiromaru, Fukamimi, and Sora. I recommend those first."}
{"text":"3.5 stars.  I ordered the sprouting up ramen.  Lots of sprouts, broth was good, chashu was good, noodles were okay, portion is adequate.  Price is probably the highest among most ramen (ramen from $12-16) places in Toronto  Worth a try if you haven't been"}
{"text":"I'm not usually a fan of ramen, but I'll happily make an exception for this awesome ramen bar! The environment is always lively and it's fun being greeted at the door by all the staff (although I recommend sitting away from the entrance as the yelling can get annoying by the end of your meal). Our waitress Lena is the best, she helped my table figure out exactly what to order. The vegetarian options are delicious, get the spicy creamy vegan ramen with thin noodles!"}
{"text":"The food is pretty good, this place is actually my son's favorite ramen in Vegas. I've been coming here since they've opened, and unfortunately over the past year the staff has become increasingly rude! Each time I call for a pick up order I'm hung up on at least twice before being able to actually place an order. Whenever I've arrived the hostess never acknowledges me or anyone else for that matter. Tonight when I picked up an order my husband placed, it was by far the most unpleasant experience yet. Safe to say this establishment will never get my hard earned money again!"}
{"text":"Jinya..I had high hopes for you! After some good recommendations, I tried you out! First of all, being a soup-noodle restaurant, I expect my soup to be hot! Um..it wasn't, second, I shouldn't have to drink two glasses of water because it's so salty! The staff was friendly, and service was fast. I don't know, maybe ramen isn't for me!!"}
{"text":"I'm torn on Jinya. There are a lot of positives to it. Firstly it is open until 3:00 AM, far later than others in the city. Next, the sides are great. The gyoza, quinoa salad, chashu bowl... They all taste so good and the prices are excellent on them. Last, the service has never been bad when we've gone here. If they make mistakes, they correct them (often with a free item). The servers are all 5 stars.   However, there is one huge negative to this place. The ramen. I don't think I've had a good bowl of ramen here in the near 10 times I've been. My wife has said the broth is very slimy which she says is a indicator that the noodles are cooked along with the broth. The worst part for myself is that the flavor of the ramen have a greasiness to them. Almost like fried chicken. Especially their Tokyo Yatai. It tasted like KFC in a bowl. This flavor extends to their other ramen, like the Tonkotsu ramen. Also, the broths are very one dimensional. I feel a good broth should have a depth of flavor - a bit spicy, rich, salty, etc. But the broths at Jinya are just flat, generic tasting.   That is why for all the positives, I just can't get behind Jinya. The ramen isn't very good, actually it's below average. That's alright if it's a generic Japanese restaurant or Izakaya, but for a ramen shop that specializes in ramen, that is damning. There are so many other options in Las Vegas, that you should skip Jinya. When most of their ramen are approaching the $10 price range, I feel you should be getting a great product."}
{"text":"Jinya is your go-to ramen restaurant in Vegas. The variety of ramens makes this establishment accessible to everyone, whether you're looking for vegan ramen or pork belly. You can taste the love! Use the sauces at your table to add even more flavor. They have a great happy hour, try the salmon poke tacos! The wonton chicken ramen is everything."}
{"text":"This place really surprised me. Everything we ordered were pretty good. The waiter was fantastic, so nice. I recommend the panacotta!!! It was delicious!"}
{"text":"I love this place and the vegan option is beyond scrumptious. Thank you for having it on the menu. I crave it when I'm out of town!"}
{"text":"Everybody is seating before us and we are waiting half an  hour longer than some of them. And they never ask us like seating at the bar or big table in the middle over there. We just stand and wait like 1.5 hour. Such a bad service."}
{"text":"Delicious. Super friendly and knowledgeable staff, fast service, and great noodles with delicious broth that really does taste like it came from a Tokyo yatai.   The staff was even super nice to the person who came in and threw a fit when it didn't taste like Cup Noodle. (I felt super bad. They tried their best to accommodate them, but some people are just awful.) The ingredients are quality and the noodles al dente. If you want a bowl of rehydrated noodles in salty broth, you might be disappointed.  If I want to go to my happy place I get the miso or yatai ramen, a pork bun, and light Japanese beer.  I've always gone off peak hours and never had to wait for a seat. Parking is a bit tight though."}
{"text":"My experience can be summed up by one word: SALTY! I had the Chef's Special chicken broth ramen ($13+). It came with thin noodle, 3 pieces of pork chashu, a half soft-boiled egg, and some raw cilantro. The noodle itself was very salty, not even mentioning the broth. If the broth was the only thing that's salty, I can cope with not drinking the broth, but if the noodle was salty, I felt there's no where to escape, although the texture of the noodle was actually nice. I also added bamboo shoots for $2.5 and that was only for 3 pieces of bamboo shoots. These too was way too salty. My husband had the Sprouting Up Ramen. He also thought it was salty, but probably because this one came with a different kind of noodle (slightly thicker), it wasn't as salty as mine."}
{"text":"Man this is the best place to eat in town. The servers know how to treat there customers. The ramen never disappoints here and always satisfies."}
{"text":"Very good soup.... The service is very good as well .... Great lunch spot .... I liked it better on this my second visit !! What can you say it's spicy noodles !!! I want to try it for dinner as I can tell it's a trendy place that must be fun!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I tried Jinya for the first time today.  Best ramen in town.  The broth was flavorful and not too salty.  The noodles soaked up the broth perfectly.  The quinoa salad was very tasty.....might want dressing on side if you don't like a lot on your salad.  Both desserts were also best in class.  Great happy hour specials from 3-5 and 10-midnight.  Service was very good.  Don't miss out"}
{"text":"Jinya just opened and is already packed almost every night.  I tried it two days after the official opening and was not disappointed at all. The staff is really nice and always around when you need them.  The ramen is good, at least for the one I tried, and for students like me, it's affordable :)"}
{"text":"Worst service I have ever had! If there was a negative star I would pick it!!!f First let's start with music way too loud that your server can't  even hear over the music then they  forgot my aunt's salad but no biggie but for you as a server to have an excuse that you \"you didn't realize\" is ridiculous. First thing after food is dropped at your table is to ask if anyone needs anything or if everything is OK. Strike one, then the food seems to be taking extra long way after we finish our appetizers finally our server come to tell us that the noodle cooker is down and it will be a bit longer after what feels like forever our food is brought out  My sister who is new to being vegan order the vegan Ramen and  took a bite before the server came back to ask if she was vegan and if so they put in the noodles made with egg cause they could not make the vegan noodles due to the cooker being down wth!??!! My sister order the vegan Ramen for them to service non-vegen noodles strike two and lastly but not least ask I was bringing to enjoy my Ramen I found a piece of plastic strike three I could have choked and all we got was an insincere apology. I did not pay for a thing and walked out. Never again will I eat here!!! Needless to say there was a tacobell next store and the service was very good"}
{"text":"A worthy addition to LV Ramen community (namely Monta and Sora)"}
{"text":"Just went to check this place out. Friendly atmosphere,  good service, great food. I gotta give it to the kid meal for $7 u get the chicken noodle soup, fries w/shrimp tempura and rice. Oh and it comes with a dessert too...for $7 it's a lot of food for a kid but really good.   I almost forgot they have homemade tofu. I love it. Definitely going to go back."}
{"text":"Amazing. The ramen was delicious. I got the spicy chicken ramen with dumplings and extra noodles. The broth was flavorful.Best ramen in vegas.Great atmosphere. Decent prices. A must try."}
{"text":"Had a great experience with the customer service and atmosphere here-the prices are reasonable-the food came out fast and the soup portion of the dish was great!!! the only BAD thing was the noddles itself-i asked the waitress why my noddles were so hard/stuck together in my bowl-i even showed her-but her answer to me was to get my smaller noddles and charge me for them. I paid $14 for under cooked noddles-which is the main selling point here-i left oddly satisfied but not with a good taste in my mouth. their smaller dishes are better than there noddles."}
{"text":"I love ramen! I have wanted to try this place for the longest time but their hours were so late 3pm-3am. I was off yesterday, and no one wanted to go with me, so I just went by myself!   I was seated immediately as there was just a party of 1. They sat me at the bar, and took my order quickly.  The waitress asked if I had been there before and when I told her I hadn't, she explained the menu and reccommended her favorite dish which had chicken and pork broth. I love pork, so I ordered the tonkotsu assari. It came out immediately. The broth was actually a lot lighter than what I am used to.  I like my broth heavy and thick. There were plenty of veggies on top. At first I was scared that it'd be all veggies, but my noodles were hiding underneath the mountain of bean sprouts. The noodles were the only noodleson the menu that were thick. One of the reviews complain there was only 1 piece of chasu, but mine had 3 pieces.   My younger sister last minute wanted some ramen, so I order the spicy chicken ramen with a spice flavor of hot for her. That order actually took a little bit longer as it got more crowded.  Her noodles were thinner and the broth was more of a chicken flavor. I did like the spice level of her ramen broth. When I ordered the noodles for take out, they put the noodles in one container and the broth in another container. The garnishes are on top of the noodles. My sister just put the noodles in the broth, and it tasted wonderful. They do have a drive through coming soon, which is probably how they will package that. I wonder how the drive through is going to work as the noodles do take a while to cook...   Just a minor complaint. I like spicy as I am part Korea, but they didn't have any chili oil. Sadness. They did have chili powder and spicy sauce, but it just wasn't the same without my chili oil.   The service was really good, and they waitresses checked on me several times to ensure that everything was okay. It just didn't taste better than what I expected."}
{"text":"Underwhelmed :-( ramen was mediocre. Had great expectations and left greatly disappointed."}
{"text":"3 stars only cuz of how bad the service is. I have never been in a place where multiple servers pass by me & don't acknowledge me, especially when I'm @ the bar next to their POS system & all I hear is the girl servers talking about their life stories to the BOH. Its hard for me to go back there knowing for sure I'm gonna get the same service"}
{"text":"I live about 2-3 minutes away from this place and have never gone there until about a week ago. I absolutely love this place. Everyone there is so nice and it's so comfy. Oh and don't get me started on the food. The gyoza is probably the best I have ever had. As for the ramen got me full and 10000% satisfied. I recommend the spicy chicken ramen. My new favorite place."}
{"text":"Delicious food! Decent prices with plenty of options to customize your ramen bowl. My favorite is the BLACK. I usually add extra pork and veggies and its delicious. They also have options if you want to get a noodle refill once your bowl starts running low. They do offer some  happy hour specials. The best appetizer by far is the Jinya bun. Its light and delicious ! Staff is friendly and attentive. Just be wary of late night trips - they get busy quick !"}
{"text":"Man, I like this place cause they open late . But man you have have to take debit visa master card for payments . You are not a Chinese restaurant ."}
{"text":"Terrible experience. There was a huge line so I chose to order my food To go thinking it would be faster. They sat us down which was nice but I'm pretty sure they forgot about our food. We waited 40 minutes and asked different waiters and they all said they are making our food now it will be out shortly. The last guy said that our food doesn't hold priority since we aren't dining in. There were multiple groups that sat down and got their food before us. I understand waiting for our food but telling us that our food doesn't hold priority and waiting that long is ridiculous! If this was the case they should tell the customer. And lastly when I did get my food it was the wrong broth. I will not be back nor recommend this place."}
{"text":"Our server was horrible. First of all we waited for a long time before she came over after we sat down. After she took our order we never saw her again . she did not bring me the drink that i asked for so i had to ask someone else to get it for me. Also, we ordered a combo that comes with Ramen, salad , and gyoza but the only thing came out was the ramen so again we had to ask someone other server to get our salad and gyoza. We ask her it's happy  hour right? She said \"i dont know what time is it ?\" wth... She ruined our appetite tonight for sure !  Overall food was ok. Not as good as tge first time we went"}
{"text":"I ordered the vegan soup without tofu and it was delicious  My husband ordered the vegetarian soup with thick noodles it was okay mine was better   His was more of a broth mine was more creamy.   They basically only have ramen soup (hints the name) and a few salads so only go with people that want this.  A few People in our group did not ordered because they thought their menu would be a little more diverse.    Our server was soooo sweet. I forgot her name but short curly hair.  Her personality was great.    I would recommend it to friends/family."}
{"text":"The taste is just not there for me.  Many of my friends have raved about this place so of course I had to check it out. I love Ramen Sora and Monta, but had yet to find another ramen place in town to rival the 2. I thought this would be the one, but sadly not. I got the Tonkatsu Black ramen and a side of Takoyaki. The Takoyaki was delicious and had a perfect ratio of octopus and batter. The Tonkatsu Black, presentation and ingredients-wise, reminded me of NY's Ippudo's Akamaru Modern bowl (which to this day is the best bowl of ramen I have ever had). The taste however was disappointing. I waited a minute to start eating my bowl because I was waiting for my additional topping of corn, but the broth was lukewarm and watery. I thought the garlic oil would enhance the flavor, but it really didn't make a difference. I was disappointed to say the least. Maybe it was an off day or I ordered the wrong thing? Who knows. But I will give this place another shot in the future."}
{"text":"Extensive menu and options so you can have almost any version of chicken or pork meat, broth, thin or thick noodles, and toppings.  Also they have non-ramen options to accompany the ramen, or to eat as tapas.  Reasonably priced.  Very efficient staff. It was busy and they moved people through there quickly without making the guests feel rushed, and while remaining very polite. Cute, modern set up.  Very small but unlike most ramen \"hole in the wall\" spots around town, they made good use of the space. Very clean.  Fancy toilets with heated seat covers and high tech hand dryers in the bathroom(s).  We had 2 dif types of ramen (with different toppings and thickness of noodles), gyoza, and chashu bowl with salad. Everything was delicious and we will try other things next time just because the experience was so great and many other options looked yummy as well...Oh, and I love that there is a ramen house open past 11:30 pm!!"}
{"text":"Quick and friendly service! Ramen is amazing! Spicy chicken with thick noodles is bomb. Just like LA."}
{"text":"I really like this place, the ramen is good, the broth feels a bit heavy but has some good seasoning to it. The restaurant seems a bit dim, but enough lighting for you to see your food and the people around you. I enjoy the chicken ramen a lot, and the servers are very friendly.  I definitely come here often, and I recommend this place greatly however, I feel like I am shouting to the person across/next to me when I am talking to them. The music is actually louder than I thought, I didn't realize it was so loud until I was literally screaming at my friend across from me because she couldn't hear me. She even said, \"Sorry, I couldn't hear what you were saying because of the music being so loud.\" Yes, I understand when you go to dinner you normally eat your food, and not talk, but if I'm waiting for my food and not eating I'm not going to be sitting there in no engaging conversation with my friends.  Overall a really delicious place, I enjoy the toppings and the noodle types. Also, have had some of their desserts before, and the desserts are too very delicious after some warm ramen."}
{"text":"I had the tonkotsu assari and the pork buns, and both were delicious. The ramen was savory and a little spicy, so good. Only waited about 5 minutes for a table and the service was excellent."}
{"text":"I drag my boyfriend here for the takoyaki, coz the ramen really isn't that great. Definitely not coming back after tonight. Our ramen had egg shells in it, and both our eggs were cold. The eggs were cold, not room temperature, they were cold.  I'm no expert, but I don't want to risk getting salmonella. The takoyaki was good though."}
{"text":"IF YOU WANT FOOD POISONING , and love vomiting I highly recommend this place. I Am a vegan , came here for the vegan ramen , the host , server , and I had a convo about the broth options and warned me about one containing fish , so I made it my biz to make sure she knew I wanted the VEGAN broth , &  no animal products in my ramen bowl what so ever  , I most certainly consumed something that was cross contaminated with meat or fish.  the kitchen was pretty busy, not sure if they have a separate section , or separate cool in kitchen dedicated to making vegan options. this is a lesson , do not eat at places that are not FULLY vegan , they don't have the correct vegan ethics to sell vegan options . Vegans are highly concerned about cross contamination and animal fluids getting in their food. I never vomited in my life , since being a baby , I'm extremely healthy, tonight I was poisoned. thank you JINYA , lesson learned ||| UPDATE ! I was contacted by shift manager of Jinya after I wrote this review and she confirmed that They are making the vegan soup in the same area they cook the dead animals. this item should be removed from the menu , it's not vegan if dead animal energy is KNOWINGLY being cross contaminated into the vegan food.   If you are a vegan DONT EAT HERE !!!! You will get very sick, they are very busy and will not take the  time to make sure your food is not contaminated.  you will get sick  !"}
{"text":"I tried Unami ramen and I loved it though my friend didn't liked cha cha cha ramen maybe he's not used to it and also I tried a Japanese beer that was super good loved this place :) will definitely come back every staff is friendly good atmosphere would recommend this place for everyone (y)"}
{"text":"This place is less than 15 min from The Strip.  We came her for lunch with a group of 8 on a Saturday and got seated right away in the center table. I ordered the Cha Cha Cha, which is #2 on the menu.  The broth was really rich and full of flavors, the noodles just right.  I wouldn't say it's among the best ramen I've had but it's good. On top of all this the staff are super nice and pretty patient when"}
{"text":"BAD BAD BAD service, the manager made us wait more than 40 minutes for 2 spicy chicken ramen. His attitude toward us was racist in a way. He gave us free sodas but that doesnt fix anything. We didnt appreciate that he would rather return our money than try to make sure our order was being made. I'd say this restaurant is not very good for to-go orders."}
{"text":"Got just take out here the other day(first timer) and I absolutely loved it. Much better taste and quality than Monta. And much nicer staff."}
{"text":"I highly recommend dining here, and not placing any ramen orders to go.  Their to go process is fast, but by the time you get home, the broth becomes congealed and the noodles stick together in a big clump. I even tried adding everything into a pot and heating it back up that way, but everything ended up tasting overly fatty and salty.   So if you're going to eat anything from here, eat it fresh."}
{"text":"Ramen restaurants have picked up in popularity over the past few years in Vegas, & I feel Jinya is the best! Their gyoza is the most delicate, soft, & gentle... There must be a secret behind it. The Jinya Bun is a must every time I go.  The flavor is always spot on, though the size of the meat has varied from time to time. If in doubt of which ramen to order and you enjoy spicy foods, definitely order the Spicy Chicken Ramen.  It is the perfect level of spiciness. It is hot enough to make you eat too much of it, but not so spicy that you can't eat it.  There's also an option to add more noodles to your bowl. The restaurant has a cool,hipster soundtrack.  I sometimes find myself downloading songs that I have heard at Jinya! If you visit the restaurant in the evening, you will likely wait for a table.  I promise it is worth the wait!    While JINYA is still my fave ramen restaurant, I must mention that their hostess needs additional training.  I believe she mentioned that her name is Melanie.  This evening, we arrived at 525pm and added our name to the list for a party of 7 and were told the wait would be 30 minutes - not a big deal.  Well, at 6 PM, the center table had 12 open seats, & we were still standing.  It felt like Melanie was dragging it out on purpose.  She would very slowly and deliberately count out 7 menus, answer a few calls, put the menus down, use the orange highlighter on the roster, answer the phone again, pick up the menus again, and recount them, all the while the 12 seats remained open for nearly 15 minutes.  Does she think she works at a nightclub on the Strip?  As we were waiting, a party of 10 came up, and she told them it would be a 2 hour wait!  It was so ridiculous.  I think someone should train this girl properly."}
{"text":"Avoid if you like ramen or good food.  Had the spicy umami miso ramen and crispy chicken. Both were horrible!  Ramen was cold and tasteless. Chicken was more like jerky.   Do NOT recommend eating here and I'm very surprised by the positive reviews."}
{"text":"My wife and I visited this ramen noodles bar and had a great time. The service was very quick and nice and the ramen was very good. I ate a pork bun and loved the Asian flavored pork. They get only 4 stars because I didn't like the Mochi  ice cream, and I love Mochi !! The chocolate flavor was not so good...  Go enjoy...don't order the Chocolate Mochi."}
{"text":"A delicious restaurant.  Boyfriend got the chicken curry ramen where I got the tonkotsu black.  He loved his, and I enjoyed mine.  The takoyaki is meh.  A bit undercooked on the inside, but at least the octopus in it isn't overcooked.  Their pork belly bun is tasty though. Their beer selection is also pretty good, but a bit overpriced since they are off the strip."}
{"text":"Black Tonkotsu: It's definitely heavy but somehow I finished mine with no problem. My hubby ordered Red, which was definitely lighter, but with a kicked up attitude. We loved them both, and we are willing to come back to try other ramen as well. At Jinya, sides are plentiful as well. We ordered brussels sprouts tempura (very creative and intricate), octopus balls (I'll come back just for them), and refreshing annin-dofu at the end of our meal. The only thing they're missing is fried rice, which isn't a big deal at all. The service was super fast, hostess/servers were all friendly, and it's not as crowded as monta/spring mountain. It seats about 50 people (spacious), so you can actually enjoy your meal without feeling rushed. HUGE PLUS."}
{"text":"4/5 stars for food 1/5 for service.    Food taste amazing but the constant bad service makes this place junk.  Employees standing in the front talking stories while guests have to wave them down to come to the table."}
{"text":"This place is listed as wheelchair accessible. When my party arrived, including my partner who uses a wheelchair, the accessible entrance was locked. A sign said to call a number if locked, and we did. It rang endlessly and no one answered. My friend went inside the non accessible entrance to let the workers know, and they led her to he entrance which was completely blocked by all of their equipment, coats, and other nonsense which they had to remove. So my friend finally got us in, an the staff basically did not care or show any apology. They gave half assed apologies and acted like we were an inconvenience. We were about to eat but we were shocked they didn't offer any sort of compensation for the trouble and the rudeness they showed. We decided to leave, and it turns out they put all their stuff back in front of the door again, even though we obviously had to leave again at some point?! And they did not even care that we were visibly disturbed by their ableism. They were cheerfully, blissfully ignorant and said \"sorry!\" as though they just misheard an order or something. It was extremely rude and unpleasant. Jinya, it is unacceptable for you to be listed as accessible when you are not. If we hadn't accompanied my partner, he wouldn't have been able to get inside at all. And their lack of apology and ignorance made it much worse. Never coming back."}
{"text":"The 3 star is because of the attitude from the hostess. This is the second time we have come here and both times I have not felt at all welcome from her. She threw our menus down at our table when she seated us. A group next to us tried to let her know that they have still had not received one of their orders and she rolled her eyes at them. Incredibly rude. Our server though was great. She was super friendly and nice. And the food is good. I enjoy their variations of ramen. They're different and very tasty. Their spicy chicken ramen with a spice level of spicy actually has a nice kick to it."}
{"text":"I really liked this place. I took my 2.5 years old twins and they had cute kids dish and silverware that my kids loved! Atmosphere is very relaxing ( maybe i went weekdays for lunch). The food was good, not super, but pretty good. Price is just right so this was a win for me. I am japanese, I enjoyed, my hub enjoyed but overall, girls loved everything even the dessert ( mochi icecream!)."}
{"text":"I ordered their Ramen and I asked to be a little bit spicy, but I felt that they gave me a really spicy one. I also ordered the rice plate with Curry (I forgot the exact name) and it was ok. Curry tasted alright. I also ordered some sushi rolls for side and it was blahhh. The ambiance of the place was nice and it is usually busy. I would give it an ok rating it comparison of some other Japanese and Ramen places in the area."}
{"text":"My Japanese friends would be appalled that a ramen place would serve cold eggs and cold tonkatsu in a luke warm broth.  Inexcusable"}
{"text":"The food was amazing,  it was a really nice and authentic Japanese ramen bar.  My husband had the Cha cha cha and really enjoyed it. I had the number 3, the broth was phenomenal, there was so much depth to it! The noodles were thick and had a great mouth feel!  We also got the takayaki which was just full of flavor!  We will be eating here again once we finally move back to Vegas. YUMMY!"}
{"text":"Was excited to try the ramen but at the end of the day it was mediocre at best. Had a bowl with ground pork (which I didn't realize would be ground until it arrived..but my mistake, since it was written in the menu. Still weird.) and thin noodles. The noodles themselves were hard, and the I found broth lacking in flavour. The quality of the meal strangely reminded me of a bad chain restaurant, until I realized after looking online that they ARE a chain restaurant. Quite uninspiring overall. There are much better places in Calgary for authentic ramen which actually tastes like it, like Umami or Shikiji. Which this meal made me sad I didn't pick"}
{"text":"Good food, nice service. Will be coming back. A good place for a cute date night before going to the movies or out dancing and drinking."}
{"text":"This was my first time having ramen and we sure came to the right place. The flavors were great. Thick broth with great flavor. Also don't forget and get the thick noodles,  there's something about those thick noodles that make it taste better  All and all a great experience. The place is clean and nice set up.  The waiters were super nice  Next time I come back to Vegas. I sure will be coming back to this place for a nice ramen"}
{"text":"Love this ramen joint! their veg ramen is so tasty with tons of vegetables. Very filling. I always switch out for the thick noodles.  I think they could improve it by offering a creamy version with soy or coconut milk.   The Brussels sprouts are so tasty. Never have to wait long and their servers are super sweet. I love the vibe of this place."}
{"text":"Visited 12/29in the afternoon. We waited about 40 minutes on a cold day for gummy ramen noodles that we barely covered in broth. It was really disappointing. I won't be going there again since there are other places around town with much better ramen. The sun was in my boyfriend's eyes the entire meal with no way for the staff to pull a shade or turn the blinds. Service was ok. No real sense of urgency with the wait staff to turn tables. Apps were good though. We had the cauliflower and crispy chicken. They also have a good selection of add ins however they were pretty skimpy for the prices."}
{"text":"Delicious, worth every penny. The service is excellent, I like their Cha Cha Cha. I would recommend it to anyone who is a ramen or garlic lover. I think it's the best ramen so far I have had in Toronto"}
{"text":"Love this place! The vegetable Ramen is delicious. The quantity is enough for my 1 year old and I to split and still have leftovers."}
{"text":"I was cooking ramen noodles the other day in my house very expensive but then realized that this place could do it better went and checked it out have a good time 5 stars"}
{"text":"This place is bomb!!!!! Great Brussels sprouts. The broth is great and there's always enough ice in my water"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. The best ramen in town. I recommend the spice chicken ramen with thick noodles instead of thin. I also always add an egg every time! My friend also thoroughly enjoyed the vegan option as well."}
{"text":"Like most people I am going to break this review up into two parts.  The Service   Just. Awful.  We arrived around 4pm on a Saturday. It was busy but there were tables available so one of the two (why two I don't know) hostesses sat us.   Then we waited. And waited. We could see waitstaff but no one came to our table. After a while I was able to get the attention of one of the hostesses and she came over and asked if everything is ok. \"Is anyone planning to serve us?\" I asked.  She was apologetic and ran to find our waiter.  Finally the waiter arrived and took our order. We ordered some drinks, Ebisen for an appy and three bowls of ramen.  Then we waited and waited for our drinks. How hard is it to bring a couple bottles of beer and some green tea? Again I flagged down the hostess and she brought us some water.  After a while our Ebisen arrived but no drinks. I had to flag down the hostess again!  Eventually we got our drinks.  When the waiter arrived with our ramen he had it all on one tray. Instead of setting the tray down (the table next to us was empty) he was struggling to take heavy bowls off the tray with one hand. Somehow he managed it.  Once our ramen was served he walked away leaving our finished plate with Ebisen shells sitting in the middle of the table. Like, what the hell? Multi-task man!  When we finished it took awhile for him to finally get the bill to us.  Not sure if it's his first day but he had no business being a waiter!  Now, the food.  The food was very good! We had Spicy Chicken Ramen and two Spicy Umami Miso Ramen. The food came promptly and piping hot. Very flavorful! Very Filling!   On it's own the food is a four star at least but the horrendous service just ruined the whole dining experience."}
{"text":"Decent service. Staff members were accommodating. Noodles were mediocre however the broth was good (a more rich and creamy broth)."}
{"text":"Second night in Vegas at one in the morning everyone were craving for ramen, so we tried this place. Place was small but they were able to accommodate a large group within 10 minutes. Food was awesome as well as the service. Adam was wonderful, he was very attentive. Went back there again two days later. I would recommend this place to anyone and I would eat there again."}
{"text":"Good service, cool people, good, but not real Japanese place. Few differences from a real ramen place; but good"}
{"text":"I'm perplexed by the popularity of this exasperatingly mediocre ramen bar.  Floor staff were all extremely kind but seemed flustered, confused, apologetic and inefficient despite a plethora of workers and a moderate to light flow of customers.  With 6 tables seated, our table of four was visited 5 different servers.  FIVE.  And they still managed to have trouble assessing our orders (and cheque) and executing the delivery thereof.  But, again, very kind.  The music was bone shakingly loud.  Pounding dance club music on a Monday night at 7 p.m.  When I deferentially and politely requested that maybe the bass could be turned down, the (very kind and sweet-faced young) server of the moment apologized and said \"she\" (owner? manager?) insisted on it as it was \"restaurant standard\".  I presume this atmosphere was an attempt to imitate a busy Japanese ramen bar but, considering the western style of sit down dining, it was quite jarring and interfered with the experience significantly.  The food was junky and wildly over salted.  Flavours indistinct in briny subsumption...  Pork and egg ramen was one note salty broth mess (though pork slices were buttery and tender).  Noodles were improperly cooked(!!).  a few strands floating, the rest glommed together in an unappetizing rubbery dough glob at the bottom of the bowl.  \"tempura\" was far too eggy and thick... soft, doughy nonsense.  Utterly flavourless fried chicken was served with a salty sauce that didn't make up for completely unseasoned chicken.  Fried greenbean app was my fave but, as with all, wildly over salted.  I suppose it could have been an off night but I am not likely to try it again."}
{"text":"Atmosphere was great, relaxing and upbeat. Waitress was outgoing and very knowledgable, explained the menu with confidence.   Explained the differences between thin and thick noodles and how it affects the taste of the broth and spiciness levels.   Food was a little salty and portion sizes were small for the price you paid. Taste was good. Will be back in the future.  Tonkotsu Spicy is the bowl I got with mild spice and it was very mild, had to add a huge spoonful to get a decent amount of flavor."}
{"text":"Obsessed with jinya. I've literally tried every ramen place in the city and nothing comes close to the food I've tried here."}
{"text":"I've been going to jinya for a while now. The food is excellent. Maybe the best ramen in town. However, recently there's been an obvious drop in customer service. I understand they are always pretty busy, but they always seem to be short handed. I don't like going to restaurants, and having to flag down the wait staff just to get a refill on water. And then on top of having to flag someone down, certain servers make you feel as if they're doing you a massive favor by refilling your water, or getting something you asked for. So some of the best ramen you'll eat, but terrible wait staff and customer service."}
{"text":"I went to Jinya once before and on my first visit the ramen was good except for the pork belly that was overcooked. On my second visit explained to the server my previous experiance at the restraunt specifically with the pork belly to which they responded by saying would ask the kitchen to use a \"soft piece.\" This last time the the ramen was ahain good, personally would have preferred the egg to be softer boiled, pork belly was superb, it was tender with the right amount of let, my feedback was understood, recieved constructively and the addressed effectively. I would have ideally given a rating on this review of 4.5 out of 5 stars given the option since believe there is still slight room for improvement."}
{"text":"Excellent place, try everything on the menu beyond the delicious ramen - chicken karage, shrimp ball, string bean, sushi rolls"}
{"text":"First of all, I LOVE their takoyaki.   Their customer service is excellent. They always apologize for long waits and always comes to check on how you're doing. The food comes out fairly quickly even if they're busy.  Their ramen is decent, but not the best I've tasted. However, like I've already mentioned, I usually end up coming here for their takoyaki.   One thing that bothers me is their parking lot. I don't know if it's just me, but it confused me on where I needed to park the first time I came here. But can't blame them for that."}
{"text":"4 stars because the food was great! The only thing that sucked was the service. Not very attentive servers, wish I could tip the kitchen, and not the server.   Update:3/12 Foods still great, servers are horrible. Wait time? \"Oh 15 mins\"... 30 mins later still not seated. Tables empty, 4 seats at the community table available. Girl with glasses, short hair, should not be a server."}
{"text":"I asked if they have gluten-free options. They said: \"No, we don't have anything for free. Sorry.\""}
{"text":"It was great but it was $18.00 for a bowl of ramen! (After tax and tip) $18.00 with out any beverage is outrageous. Way too expensive for lunch. May be back if they start a lunch special... otherwise unaffordable."}
{"text":"I used to love this place. Since it's been getting more and more popular, I feel they have lost their quality control. I ordered a spicy ramen which didn't come spicy at all. Had to bug the server for some chili. Then we had no utensils to eat with and had to bug the server again. My broth was super salty. Ordering tea came in a very tiny cup with hot water only filled halfway which they never came back to refill on. It was hard enjoying my soup with almost nothing to drink down with. At this point we didn't even want to bug the server anymore and decided to leave to go get tea elsewhere. She never came to check up on us to see if we needed anything. Everything, we had to ask for. I still ended up leaving a 20% tip out of the niceness of my heart."}
{"text":"The ramen in this place is so good. wait time is reasonable considering how small this place is. servers and host are one of the nicest people in restaurant i have been too. The Ramen is really tasty and have that real ramen taste not like some wannabe ramen. trust me i have my fair share of ramen in LA. overall experience amazing"}
{"text":"I had the vegetable ramen and added some chicken, it was AMAZING! I sat at the little bar are in front of he kitchen watching all the cooks. That was cool. The whole place is a really awesome experience and I will gladly by back for more."}
{"text":"Thought I would check out this ramen bar around the corner from the house. Excellent attentive service from my server Lauren. I dined on the chefs special with a seaweed salad to start, finished off the meal with the panda cotta.  With the late hours,open till 3am this place will definitely make the weekly visit list"}
{"text":"The interior is really lovely, it's so sleek and modern you'd never guess it used to be a fast food restaurant. JINYA offers a $12 lunch special. My brother and I felt it was a good way to sample a few things since we've never been to a ramen bar before. Initially, we were a little puzzled with what actually came with the combo, but we were pleasantly surprised when we learned we didn't have to choose between ramen or the rice dish. We were given half orders of each, gyoza and almond tofu dessert. We chose Tonkotsu Spicy, Spicy Chicken ramen, and we each had the pork bowl.   Both broths were nicely developed and perfectly seasoned. However, I enjoyed the chewiness of the thick noddles in the Tonkotsu a bit more than the thinner version in the spicy chicken. I'm not a big fan of eggs in general, and the seasoned egg in the pork bowl did nothing to woo me. The pork though was succulent and rich with flavor. The gyozas were addictive and some of the best I had, I return for those alone. Dessert was light and refreshing, a nice end to a filling lunch."}
{"text":"I live in the neighborhood, love a good bowl of ramen and was really looking forward to a great bowl.  A few days after opening, a few friends met up for lunch, a visit and the big taste test.  The usual Japanese Izakaya commotion greeted us as well as a very friendly and helpful server.  Since it as a late lunch and not too busy, we didn't feel crowded.  If the place had been full...we would have been squeezed together...tables way too crowded. We ordered some caramelized cauliflower and a broccoli tempura starter to split.  The cauliflower tasted like any other cauliflower dish but the broccoli was good.  Our server tried to explain the menu at the top of her lungs, but had to repeat herself constantly...the music was over the top loud, and not a particularly great selection.  We couldn't hear ourselves think!  We asked her to have it lowered, but she shouted that since they were a bar, they had to leave it turned up. Our ramen arrived..all fine, but we couldn't carry on a conversation.  I can understand cranking up the music for happy hour or later evening, but not at 1:00 on a weekday.  There are several ramen places in the hood that are much more conducive for enjoying a bowl, and I guess next time I get a craving for some sake and some loud sound, I'd go back to Jinya.  If  I want an enjoyable ramen meal with good conversation and some good background music...I'll head elsewhere."}
{"text":"Very friendly and accommodating wait staff. Nice interior. Tonkatsu pork 'spicy' was the dish. A little different from the normal bone broth. Slightly thicker, but in a good way. The pork was nice and melty. Noodles were good. Missing the egg, otherwise an excellent bowl of ramen. Portion could have been a little bigger for the hungry people, but good enough for me. Recommend as a change to the big two ramen houses on Dundas."}
{"text":"Came here with my boyfriend for a date night. I liked the ambiance. Food was amazing and highly recommended. This may have stolen my heart from KoBo.  keep up he good work JINYA!"}
{"text":"Since they don't take resos, we arrived just as they opened for lunch. Good thing too because it was quite nippy out, there's no waiting area and it got really busy shortly after (more on that in a bit).  There's definitely a lot of options including rice bowls and snacks, but stuck with what we were there for: the ramen!  My Tonkotsu Black looked and sounded appetizing enough: pork broth, kikurage, nori, seasoned egg, garlic chips, fried onions and spicy sauce on thin noodles. The savoury broth was a perfect richness and there was a decent amount of noodles and meat to fill me up.  The venue isn't very big but it is open concept. Once it gets busy, it gets really loud. In addition to the music, there's yelling/greeting from the service staff as people come in and the diners talking over each other, it's quite difficult to maintain a conversation. Your options could be to come at an off time or I guess you can contribute to the noise and be loud as well lol  The food is decent and so is the price. I'm glad I waited for the hype to die down before trying JINYA."}
{"text":"I finally ate here yesterday with some colleagues after driving past the last few weeks. After viewing photos and reviews online, it was easy to know what to order and man was the food delicious.  I ordered the Special: Spicy Miso Based Ramen Combo with Crispy Chicken and Salad. The chicken was perfectly fried and had an authentic Japanese taste. My friend ordered the Gyoza pot stickers and they were perfectly steamed and crisped on the outside. Another member of our party ordered the tempura Brussels sprouts. They were light and crispy all at the same time.  The ramen was very tasty and not too salty like other places. Like most ramen, the meal was filling but Jinya delivered on taste.  The décor in the restaurant was very pleasing and inviting."}
{"text":"Chef special is a must of Jinya!! I have been coming to Jinya regularly since they grand opened cos I'm working just around the corner.  Their ramen are generally rich and bit salty like all other Japanese ramen.  HOWEVER, since they introduced the chef special, I had been going regularly, like once a week!! Really loved the interesting combination of lemon+ parsley+flavored soup!!! Highly recommend a try!!"}
{"text":"This was my first proper ramen shop since I've learnt about the craze.  I had an amazing experience. They are open pretty late (got there around 2am ) straight from the airport.  Wait time at 2 am for a table is roughly 10-15 minutes on the weekend.  I had the chefs special which was chicken based and spicy.  Mushrooms and seasoned egg and fresh garlic as additions.  Overall it was great. Food came out timely and server was very helpful and polite. We went back again on your trip and the experience was just as pleasant.  Ps. If you aren't into creamy based soups don't choose mild for anything. As the consistency changes based on the spice level."}
{"text":"I went to JINYA on Thanksgiving weekend with my husband,we tried the veggie and spicy chicken ramen,service and food was great,very nice, clean ,relaxing place,we are came form San Francisco and will come back again when next time visit LV"}
{"text":"Delicious ramen.  So far...one of my favorites in Las Vegas.  Great food, great service.  Yumm!"}
{"text":"Liked everything about this noodle bar but the music was a little loud hard to talk to someone while eating their great food"}
{"text":"I ordered a ramen called garlic lover or something. But there is only onion but no garlic in the ramen. What kind of garlic lover it is."}
{"text":"Great service.  The ramen's broth was very good.  I got the vegetable ramen, it was filled with with so many greens and they give you all the hot sauces you want.  Had a Sapporo bear and warm sake that was very smooth and had a bite of honey at the end. In vegas for another 3 days and I will be coming back"}
{"text":"Jinya is the place to go when it's like midnight on Saturday when everyone is drunk and tired from a party....well that's only one of the reasons to go. But for real, if you are hungry and craving soup whether it's for lunch or late night, this is the place to go. Their ramen is pretty on point and I love that every time I come here, there's a new ramen dish with a twist to it. From unique flavor of the Cilantro Ramen to the light flavor of the Chicken Ramen to the tangy Spicy Ramen, this place knows how to make every and every ramen dish delicious and well of quality. I like that they offer a lot more appetizers than most ramen places and you can even come in during happy hour for cheaper appetizers too! They have great Pork Buns and the Shrimp Balls are uniquely breaded, the only appetizer I can't ever get myself to try is the Fried Pork Ear. For drinks, they do offer Sake, Beer and Wine so it goes perfect with the food. Lastly, the look of this place is amazing and I've always wanted a reason to bring a huge group of people to fill their large table. I also love the loud edm music so it can block the noise of the customers and I can rock out to my ramen. Remember, NO RAMEN NO LIFE!"}
{"text":"In my opinion, one of the top 2 ramen places in town (the other one being fukumimi). Place is well designed and has a comfortable atmosphere. After the ramen, the salad dressing on the house salad is awesome and the brussel sprouts are a must try. The kids menu here is great too. They give a special table setting for the little ones and the meal comes with an app, entree, & dessert. Very cool"}
{"text":"Boyfriend and I love this place! We wanted Ramen late at night so we came here (open til 3am!!!). They asked if we wanted to sit at the bar or community table. We chose the bar since we were on a date and wanted some privacy. Loved it!! Tonkatsu Assari was delicious. Sake was delicious as well. Sitting at the bar was cozy and more personable with each other.  Second time we went we sat at the community table with our other friend. Fun, different atmosphere. Servers are very attentive and kind!   We're getting in take-out tonight! We found our spot!"}
{"text":"It seems like Toronto is filling up with Ramen bars nowadays and Jinya is the newest of the bunch. I really enjoyed the service at this ramen place. The servers are super friendly and the cooks bring you your ramen nice and hot! Just the way I like it. I got the Chicken Garlic Ramen and I liked the broth and noodles alot. The broth is not too salty compared to other Ramen joints like Kinton. The seating area and atmosphere is really comfortable too. I'm glad that this ramen joint has joined the Church-Wellesley area. I would say the pricing is on par with similar ramen places in the city. I like that the basic ramens come with at least a few toppings so you don't have to pay too much for additional toppings. It's sad when you order a ramen and all it comes with are noodles, an egg and meat. Overall would return for another meal just for the service alone!"}
{"text":"I ordered the tonkotsu garlic ramen. The broth and noodles were ok but I was sad to see that my egg yolk was quite overcooked and not runny at all. Upon asking the waitress if it's always like that, she said it was. For the price we paid, we've definitely had better ramen elsewhere and for cheaper. There are a number of places in the area that serve better ramen in my opinion (ie. Santouka, Kinton, etc.). Kinda wish we went to either of those places instead!"}
{"text":"Are you kidding me with how delicious this place is???! We arrived here at 2:00 in the morning and were greeted as though they had just opened. Super friendly. The ramen was spicy, hot, and delicious. The chicken on the ramen was so tender - I honestly don't think I've ever had chicken like that. Plus I added tofu to it - double yum. A fun, different, healthy break during a long night of gambling!!"}
{"text":"The food is great, first time here I had the Seaweed salad & Spicy Chicken ramen. It was so delicious I had to go back the next day. Only problem is they have a very small dine in area and it's packed. They should really think about going bigger on the place. It looks pretty popular at any time."}
{"text":"The ramen is great. The deep fried Brussel Sprouts are wonderful."}
{"text":"Let me just say it the place is great! But... Few things to note: I got the Cha cha cha, and on the menu it says its for garlic lovers and that is why I ordered it. It was overloaded with green Onions and a bit too much bean sprouts.  Garlic was the last flavor I can taste and I just didn't get the Garlic lover at all from it.  But overall the ramen bowl was pretty good, thick sauce and thick noodles and I love that about it.  I didn't mind the overload of green onions but the bean sprout was too much for my preference. Every bite was surely crunchy but at the same time every crunch of the bean sprout was diluting the flavor of ramen itself.  Meat was okay, in my opinion and the egg the came with it was pretty cold in the center and i didn't like that.  For 14$, I did not appreciate the value as it is not worth it for me. Overall I'd give this ramen bowl a 4 star and the place itself a 5 star for the great customer service."}
{"text":"Personally, I didnt really like it here. Its loud and so dark I had to out my phone to read the menu. There also wasnt anything on the menu I was dying to try. Food was bland; you could tell they made their everything extra spicy and salty to hide the fact that the base of everything had little to no flavor. The soup didnt have any depth to it. Service was good, and thats about the only thing I can compliment them on."}
{"text":"Awesome Ramen.  VERY FULL FLAVORED.  Having tried ramen in Japan, LA, Canada, Taiwan, China and New York, this definitely stacks up to some of my favorites.   The food i give 4 stars, the extra star is for the customer service. everybody was very friendly and when they made a mistake with the order, they were very apologetic and immediately fix the problem."}
{"text":"I had really wanted to try JINYA since it opened and finally went on a Sunday night with a friend. Overall it was a great spot for our casual date! We got a table right away and the service was fast.  The JINYA bun was a fantastic starter. The bread was delicious and the meat inside was flavourful and tender. For my main dish I got the Chef Special which was the Karaage chicken and it was definitely a great pick. I actually didn't want my Ramen to end. The broth was so tasty and soothing. It tasted as good as it looked when it was set down in front of me.  I look forward to going to JINYA again and will recommend it to friends!"}
{"text":"Went here for some lunch since I was in the area.  I got the cha cha cha ramen dish. There is a generous enough serving of noodles compared to a lot of other ramen places. Definitely leave feeling full. I ordered a side dish of noodles and did not need it. Char sui was thick and soft which was great. The broth though was on the lighter side and could have been a bit more creamier. Ramen is all about that broth so for the price that it was, it was a little steep. Staff were friendly."}
{"text":"My first visit to Jinya....loved it. Tonkatsu Ramen with fresh garlic and corn...... I will be back soon"}
{"text":"I like ramen but I hate crowds. Jinya is really good BUT if you come late at night, it can get really crowded. I think the proximity to the Strip is part of the problem; I've seen waits of 45 minutes even on a weeknight. Their specials are well priced, the food is good, and the service is usually great even when it's packed. I like the communal seating option too (if you've been to Asia, sharing tables really is pretty normal). It's a bit far from me so it's never going to be my go-to spot but if I'm heading home from the Strip and in the mood for ramen, this is where I'll be."}
{"text":"JINYA is open til 3am. Big Plus. So we went for some 2am ramen when we were done gambling for the night.   The place is stylish but with scream at each other loud music. Minus.   I got the \"Sprouting Up\" Ramen $10.80 with Pork Soboro topping +$1.50  Pork broth - Pretty good. Liked it.   Pork Chashu - Had to taste my wife's because they gave the Soboro topping and forgot my chashu but I was almost done by the time I realized it.   Brussel sprouts!  Yes brussel sprouts. Thought there would be a couple of them but there was maybe a handful, cooked perfect and cut in quarters.  They tasted great and matched the other components perfectly.  I'll go back just for this.   Egg - soft yolk. Above average.   Served with thick noodles that were too thick for me  Gyoza was... gyoza  I'll be back for Brussel sprout ramen. Don't forget my chashu next time!"}
{"text":"First visit with the wife for lunch. Ample parking, it's in a shopping center, smart modern décor.  Staff very attentive and friendly.  Service was very speedy, and the food was extremely tasty.  Both had Takoyaki, which are very tasty and addicting, and their number one seller the \"Black\" ramen.  Tasty, tasty, tasty!  Will definitely go back to try other menu offerings."}
{"text":"i actually only ordered to go but even as a to-go diner they took really good care of me. they sat me at the bar to wait and gave me a glass of water. staff was friendly, all smiles. two different servers made sure i was ok while waiting.   the atmosphere is cozy, intimate and they use the small space very nicely.   the food. . . ridiculous. i ordered the chicken ramen spicy with thick noodles. perfectly hot and had tons of flavor. also got the Tokyo curry which was new to me, also delicious. only problem now is resisting coming here every day. and open till 3am which is just another plus."}
{"text":"The environment is warm and cozy! The staff is skillfully and aesthetically pleasing. Speedy service with fresh food. Highly recommend for a budgeted but luxurious date or bite to eat with your friends!"}
{"text":"My first time at Jinya, ordered their special Tokyo Tonkatsu Ramen. It is good but for $14.50 , I was expecting a bit more in terms of ingredients. The broth was flavourful but it was not hot enough. With this Ramen it came with thin noodles, you can change your noodles for extra cost. NO THANK YOU! ill keep the thin noodles. That being said, if you finish your noodles you can ask for more noodles at an extra cost, but to me not worth it when your soup is not HOT. I did enjoy the egg, very good and perfectly done. I'd come again. When i went for dinner it was pretty busy."}
{"text":"I love this place, plain and simple. Great food, great space, great service. I would consider it reasonably priced for what you're getting. My only criticism is that when you order a bowl with protein (e.g., chicken), you get literally 2 pieces of chicken. I'm certainly not left hungry, given the noodles and abundance of vegetables, though I think they could probably be a bit more generous with their meats."}
{"text":"Living in SoCal, one gets used to finding good Asian food.  I've been a fan of Japanese food for a long time, and a *good* ramen place is always a find.  We were trying to chase down someplace for dinner and this place came up.  I wasn't expecting much, but this place was a very pleasant surprise.   I had one of their tonkatsu ramen bowls.  The noodles weren't overcooked, the pork tender,  and the broth was very tasty, while NOT overly salty, which I appreciate.   Worth the trip off the Strip!"}
{"text":"Tried for the first time today. I had the chicken ramen it was delicious and very comforting. Place is small and crowded but it was worth the wait."}
{"text":"Great spot to eat when the weather is cold, rainy, and if your feeling blue. It had a nice cozy intimate atmosphere with their dim lighting. Very welcoming, friendly service too. However, the seatings are all wood with no butt cushion (ouch) - puts a damper to my back -__-   I recommend:  Spicy chicken ramen - delicious  Crispy chicken - double delicious esp with the Spicy creamy shrimp tempura - yumm  Lycheetini - tasty alcohol treat!"}
{"text":"Have eaten here a couple of times. Always something new and interesting to try. Yesterday I discover the crispy chicken, wonderful!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I wandered into this place while on vacation and we were so surprised at how amazing it was. I had the spicy chicken and he had the cha cha cha, both were to die for. We also ordered a saki and it was worth it just to see the presentation!"}
{"text":"We visited this location because we saw it advertised. Fist we ordered 2 small plates then we ordered the tonkotsu spicy ramen. The side plates never came. The spicy ramen is not spicy and the broth was not hot. The service was substandard. The beef was cold and the inside of the egg was also cold. We eat ramen pretty regularly but have to say we will never go back here."}
{"text":"Its overly hyped. Decent ramen with a too long wait. They are open late which is a huge plus."}
{"text":"This was my first time at a ramen \"bar\" so it was quite interesting. Ordered two ramen for my wife and myself plus a California roll, for about $25 so that wasn't bad. Ramen was flavorful, and the service was fast. The only down side was the atmosphere was slightly to fast paced, with club music over the speakers, not really my style but fascinating to try."}
{"text":"4 stars for food 2 stars for service 1 star for cleanliness. Floors were slippery from grease..."}
{"text":"Awesome. Front runner for best ramen. Jinya Tonkotsu Black ramen is ALL the others are raving about. Rich, garlicky and a myriad of flavor. Tempura Brussel sprouts add a nice punchy note to the light fry."}
{"text":"really good???egg-mayo beneath the taroyaki is great?cha-cha ramen is awesome?much better than santoku and sansotan"}
{"text":"Literally the best ramen I've had in a very long time. I get the spicy creamy vegan ramen and omg I crave it 24/7. There are so many flavors and toppings in this specific bowl, even if you aren't vegan or even vegetarian you would still love this bowl of ramen. The portions are perfect and you can always choose the option for extra noodles. The music and overall vibe of this establishment is so welcoming and fun. I always have a good time when I come here even if I'm tired or just having a bad day. I took my dad here a few days ago and he's not a huge fan of ramen. He also had the spicy creamy vegan ramen and he ate every last drop.   I will always recommend this place to anyone and everyone.  The location isn't a super convenient place but it's no big deal at all.  There's also a drive thru which I have yet to check out but I think getting ramen in a drive thru is pretty cool."}
{"text":"To start this review, all I have to say it's definitely a great place to get Ramen....especially if its 1am, and you really need a fix.  Pros: Great atmosphere that has both a modern, and authentic feel to it.            Excellent, quick, and friendly service.           Great variety in their Ramen menu.(For Ramen)           Open til 3am, I mean really? 3am Definitely helps when you are craving it.  Cons: Really there's only one. And it would be consistency, most of the time the food is perfect. However a couple of times I've noticed the base to either be completely over-powering, or slightly underwhelming and that's only happened maybe twice.   All in all, definitely a must go to when you're in the mood for some absolutely delicious ramen."}
{"text":"Went to Jinya on opening night and I've been waiting to come here since they've been renovating.   When we first arrived, there was a long line of customers waiting for a table- which is expected on opening night. My main issue with this, is that the staff do not know what they were doing. The front of house staff had to double check with the owner (I assume) which causes confusion and extra waiting time for customers. Once we were seated by the ramen bar, we had clear view of the kitchen. Within 30 secs, a server came over to get our drink orders. Which would be awesome, instead, he basically told us to order right away because there was a big line of customers and we should eat as quickly as we can and get out or he couldn't get us our food. I was shocked that he would even mention being accommodating to other customers when I've barely been in my chair for 5 minutes. I literally just hung up my coat on the back of my chair.   Anyhow, I was hungry so we made a swift decision on what to get. I got the Sprouting Up Ramen (keep in mind, I hadn't even looked at the menu for very long, I just got the first thing on there.), it was a standard bowl of ramen, nothing to write home about. It was an odd but surprising pairing with Brussels sprouts on the top. The noodles themselves was cooked perfectly chewy. I could however, see inside the kitchen from the ramen bar, and watch the chefs unpack packets of pre-made noodles. There was a trolley of cardboard box with packets upon packets of uncooked noodles.  It's now about 4 hours from finishing my meal and no amount of drinks could help me get rid of the bitter taste in my mouth -- a big red flag telling me there's MSG in the broth. We also ordered the Tonkotsu Spicy Ramen and Tokyo Curry Rice. They were okay, but very mediocre.   When we finished our meal, we asked for the bill and the guy comes over with the check and the debit machine. Halfway through processing our transaction, he tells us to get up and go to the till at the door (where there are a ton of people waiting for a table) so he doesn't waste time helping to pay for our mediocre meal. The service was horrendous, even for opening night. The food was average and definitely pale when compared to all the other Japanese restaurants in Calgary. I still can't believe the level of terrible service we received. Needless to say, I will not be returning to this restaurant nor will I recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"Best ramen I have had to date and I love ramen!  Good service, cool atmosphere and food that put a smile on my face.  Definitely on my list of go to restaurants in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Very good selection of Ramen and more choices in the menu for side order. Will gladly come back for more."}
{"text":"I like going to this place when I'm not too hungry but I want something to snack on while I drink my Sapporo. I've only been to this place once and I think their ramen is okay. It's more on the salty side and it doesn't help that their ramen sauce is also really salty. One of my favorites is the kale pops. I was really disappointed when I found out that they discontinued this product. On my last visit, I tried the crispy chicken, the dynamite, jinya bun, and the tempura brussel sprouts. I really enjoyed their crispy chicken but I had to put a lot of lemon juice because it was a little salty for my comfort. I like the jinya bun's well, bun. It was really soft. The pork inside it was basically all pork fat which I found a little disgusting. I wasn't really a big fan of their tempura. It was okay. Nothing special. Their dynamite though is probably what I'll come back for. It's very rich and I love how much seafood they put in their. Too bad it only comes with a few crackers. It would be better if they put more. That way you're not using a spoon to eat the dip like it's an entree. Customer service wasn't too bad. Got seated in a timely manner and staff was very friendly. Again, I wouldn't come here when I'm really hungry."}
{"text":"Broth is now pure perfection since opening! Karaage chicken is done very well just needs a better sauce component! \"Spicy aioli\"...Consistency and overall amazing I recommend all ramen lovers!"}
{"text":"The 15 minute wait for a late (2pm) lunch was a little off-putting, but it was WORTH it! We had the vegetable ramen--deep flavor variety of veggies, and delicious thin noodles; the takoyaki-creamy and over-the-top (not my favorite, but other members of my group enjoyed it); the Dynamite roll--of which I didn't partake; and the tempura Brussels sprouts--I already love Brussels sprouts but these were delicious! The best thing, though, was the kid's meal. I mean, I would have ordered it for myself. It was lots of little bites of chashu pork, crispy chicken, salad, an orange, and fries. It also came with a small bowl of ramen and an amazing custard dessert. Here's the kicker, we paid less than $50 (including a Sapporo). That may not impress you, but for the amount of quality food we ate, I consider it a bargain!"}
{"text":"Referred by friend, just try it out tonight. When the door open, heard very loud music. Very difficult to communication with the waitress, I have to speaked  very loud to order the foods. There not enough light. The Jina Bun was great. Ramen are so so, too much oil, too creases. Too salty."}
{"text":"Came with my kids and what a disappointment. This place used to have some of the dishes. I was sad not seeing the servers that used to work here, also the cooks are new as well. The guy seating us had great customer service and a great personality, kinda wished he was our server. Instead we get this girl who looks like she would rather be doing something better than serve people food. She rushed our order and our drinks, only to disappear and not come to the table to check on us. My son got his order 15 minutes before we had all of ours...it wasn't even busy! There were two other families and that's it. When I went to dig in my whole bowl was mostly cold with some luke warm broth in it. Even the meat hadn't fully heated through in the broth. It's such a disappointment, never coming back."}
{"text":"BEST RAMEN IN VEGAS! Not only is the food spot on, the venue itself very well decorated with a very hip feel -- nice and dim, good music and just an overall great ambiance! Definitely my pick for a casual date night, and absolutely perfect for rainy days that call for hot soup!   In terms of the food, I think what sets this place apart is the broth they use. It is full of flavor and rich without being overly salty (which apparently is in large part that they simmer their signature stock for TEN hours!). And aside from the usual pork and chicken broth, they also offer vegetarian. Their noodles are also great, which they age for THREE days to maximize their flavor.   For her: - CRISPY CHICKEN TONKOTSU RAMEN (chef's special): Chicken broth, green onions, fried onion, thin noodles (added corn & a seasoned egg -- which is a must!) - CRISPY CHICKEN: Five perfectly seasoned fried chicken pieces served with a very complimentary sauce (originally $4.95 but can be found on happy hour menu for $3 if you're lucky!)  For him:  - CHA CHA CHA (for garlic lovers!): Pork & fish broth, pork chiashu, seasoned egg, bean sprouts, chopped onion, green onion, garlic, chili powder, thick noodles.  - SALMON POKE MINI TACOS: Two of Jinya's original salmon poke in crispy wonton taco shells, with side of cilantro. (can also be found on happy hour menu!)  PRO TIP: \"Kaedama!\" aka get a noodle refill! Still have soup? For $1.60, get a hot, fresh batch of noodles to add in! :)  PRO TIP II: Happy hour menu from 3:00pm-5:00pm, and 10:00pm-12:00am."}
{"text":"Came here for the second time with my parents that were here from out of town. They loved it the first time. So we decided let's have it again! Man did we make a mistake & man oh man did we wait. We had a party of 8 which yes I know it was huge (for this place) we knew we were going to wait no doubt about that 45-min to an hour tops. After about an hour we were told we were next so we headed inside to wait because it was cold. Not a surprise, not much space to wait. We were like sardines huddled near the front door, but hey when we were told we were next we assumed we were going to be seated within what 5 minutes or less maybe? Not the case at all! The host made the mistake of seating a party of 3 right smack dab in the middle of our table which made our wait an extra hour!!!!! Why?!!!!! Why would you seat another party in the middle of our table (you know the only big table in the middle of the room). You could've seated them in one of the 2 empty booths that were available We weren't the only ones that noticed that huge mistake. A couple waiting right next to us said \" wow I can't believe they did that!\" So we stood there inside for an extra hour just dumbfounded. It seriously ruined the mood for us which sucked because we were in such great spirits that day.  When we were finally seated, no I'm sorry about the wait which was our mistake. No we apologize about that. Just seated. The waitress gave us water, asked if we wanted anything else besides water and then took our order. (Which she almost forgot to take orders from 3 others in my party wtf?!! I had to point to them and tell her \" they need to order as well\" We were seated all together are you not paying attention?!) She never came back after taking our order?? 3 other servers/bus boys came to give us our food which is fine I understand, it happens all the time. But NOBODY checked on us, didn't ask how's everything? need a refill? Etc.   The food was good, no complaints about that! Which is why we came back obviously. Trust me we ate it all up after waiting so damn long!   NOTE: We still gave them a 20% tip because I would never ever not leave just nothing, that's just not me and it's just rude! But we all left so upset which sucked so bad. I haven't seen my parents in a long time and we wanted to have a good time. My mom told me that this was the last time we were coming here and despite how much I love or should I say loved this place, I would have to agree after last night. This is the last time we're coming here!   Sorry JINYA. You could've stepped up your game and offered us some type of compensation for our 2 hour wait due to YOUR terrible mistake. (Free sodas? One free appetizer? A little discount off our meal? I don't know the possibilities are endless!) it would've made us feel like you were trying to show some type of apologetic gesture, but we were left with \"a real bad taste in our mouth\". Maybe I'll consider coming back when you guys MAYBE OPEN A BIGGER LOCATION? TRAIN STAFF ON CUSTOMER SERVICE? SHOW YOUR CUSTOMERS YOU ACTUALLY CARE?   Suggestion to others: Don't even bother coming here if you have a party bigger than 4-6. I'm dead serious. (Unless you enjoy waiting??) Honestly it's just an absolute nightmare. Trust me."}
{"text":"Have been there in weekday's noon,  after lunch rush hour very less customers.  They are modern ramen bar rather than selling authentic traditional japanese ramen.  They provide very sensitive service and foreign little girl server behavior so nicely. Their ramen price is a little bit higher than other ramen competitors,  but since their bowl of topping are very full,  also providing better services and overall in store experience are better,  that is worth to have it. For the food they still need some improvement. I have tried the very popular chachacha garlic noodle.  Noodle was soft and sticky,  and some noodles even stuck together,  this is not really professional as i cant see any others will doing like that. You can see a thick layer of oil on top of the soup obviously,  this is not really good looking and for eat.  And sadly even this bowl has much garlic on top,  but the garlic favour is not really enough. And you will feel thirsty after drank its soup. Chashu are nice with thick cut and fat meat portion are good. You will feel full after ate it,  but after taste was not really good at all. I also tried their advertiser salad is good to give a try, but the gyoza is just ok or you can just skip it.  For noodle i preferred from Kyouka,  Hakata soup is more rich to be loved, Isshin ramen's topping is the best for now, Jinya has providing very good services within ramen brands."}
{"text":"Great Ramen! Highly recommend Jinya RB for all those ramen lovers."}
{"text":"Food - Delicious!  Place - clean, small, booths/tables total about maybe 10 and one big table in the middle that sit multiple groups together. Chill atmosphere.  Service - when you arrive you have to put your name on a list. took a star away because nobody greeted us for a good 20 min. I don't think they have a hostess. From what I saw the servers were doing both, sitting and serving. Another reason I gave it 4 starts is cause our server disappeared and we waited on our check for another 20 min. Maybe it was just one of those days.   other than that the staff was nice.   Would definitely come here again!"}
{"text":"I thought this place would be amazing due to the hype and long lines that this place boasts. The lines look long but they move quickly as the seating is pretty open and they have a big seating bar in the middle which also helps the wait times. However, I have high standards for ramen coming from Socal and Norcal.   I tried the Tonkotsu Black ramen and thought it was average. It wasn't bad, but it didn't blow my mind like some of the reviews I've read. Also, for the price, I feel like they should give more as I pretty much ate the whole bowl in a couple big slurps.   Overall, this place is good but I wouldn't queue in the long line just to get ramen."}
{"text":"Came in around noon on a Friday with my boyfriend. We were greeted and sat right away by very friendly server. Same server got our drinks started and offered to explain how their menu worked. Great job at up selling appetizers and specialty drinks. We ended up ordering 2 Chicken Won Ton Noodles, Pork Gyoza (6 pot stickers), one of their Watermelon Delight Summer Drinks, and an order of their Chocolate Mochi Ice Cream and Green Tea. Food came out VERY quick despite the restaurant getting busier by the second. I can see why this place is such a hotspot, BEST NOODLES I'VE HAD IN A WHILE!!! Pot sticker appetizers were crunchy and flavorful, noodles had a great amount of wontons, veggies, and noodles. Hot sauce at the table added just the right amount of kick. Watermelon drink was very refreshing, perfect to cool off from the hot food and weather. Mochi Ice Cream topped everything off as a delicious desert. CAN NOT believe I have never heard of this place. Will definitely return, recommending this place to everyone ! Only downfall is the restaurant needs to be a LOT bigger for how popular it is!"}
{"text":"The black garlic ramen (black tonkotsu [sp?]) is sooooooo delicious. It's relatively cheap and on par/better than Monta ramen! :)"}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite ramen places to come to in all of Toronto. It's tucked away in the corner of Church Street. It's usually pretty busy and they don't have seating really for groups bigger than 4. I come from Markham, so I always have to drive. There's some street parking in the area and a few lots. Obviously the street parking is cheaper....  My favourite ramen to get is the Cha Cha Cha ramen. It is a must for garlic lovers! It comes with 4 pieces of Cha siu and a mountain of bean sprouts. I love their thick ramen it comes with and it also comes with a side of garlic and a presser for you to add more garlic into the ramen!  The side dishes are also very tasty here. My favourite is the chicken karage here. It comes with a side vinegar sauce for dipping. They come in 5, 10, or 15 pieces. I always get the 15 and share!  I would totally recommend coming here :)"}
{"text":"This is a must try! We came here one night w my little family and had to wait a few since it seemed like a busy night. While waiting we had to use the restroom and the girls restroom had the automatic toilets like in Japan! I thought that was cool. We finally got seated and our server was super nice and patient. We ordered a few things from the menu and definitely loved the rice bowl we ordered. I liked that the menu had small and large portions to choose from. And there's a neat table right in the middle of the restaurant that can seat a big party or just share amongst other parties. Haven't really tried much ramen places here but we would definitely Coke back here for more"}
{"text":"I've been here - dining-in and taking out - at least 12 times (and counting!), and is definitely my new ramen spot! The rotating chef specials are great, but the Sprouting Up Ramen with pork chasu is my fav. The Brussels Sprouts Tempura appetizer is delicious as well!   The broths here are good, the ingredients are fresh, and the noodles have been consistently cooked to perfection. Prices are average and the late hours make Jinya a prime ramen spot!"}
{"text":"Ramen and food was good but service was whatever. Waiters never checked on our table and had to grab their attention."}
{"text":"This is probably my new favorite ramen restaurant. I love the facts that they're open late everyday of the week and you don't have to fight for parking. I always get an order of the takoyaki balls because they come with this delicious egg salad underneath ... so good."}
{"text":"I really enjoy the ramen at Jinya! Their broth is flavorful but not too overpowering, allowing you to appreciate the flavors of the cashu pork. The tonkotsu has a subtle, creamy texture, which goes well with the veggies and noodles. And their noodles have a good bite to them while being able to pick up the flavors of the broth.   I recommend this place to all visitors (and locals) who are looking for a good ramen place in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Really good ramen! Got the spicy chicken and hit he spot! Fast service and they were very attentive. Place is also clean and has a good vibe. For sure coming back!"}
{"text":"Once again the soups are super fantastic. The service was good. Our 2yr old son was dancing to the kuhl music as well. 1 small detail missed, we do not need glasses of water when lake mead is empty... As we said no water when we ordered.  I approve this message  JK KUHL."}
{"text":"As a ramen snob, Jinya is one of my favorites in Vegas. They have a wide variety of choices - I've had something different everytime and have enjoyed all of them. I'm very particular about ramen noodles and I have yet to be disappointed by the handmade noodles here. The firmness is good, never soggy, and the ramen is rarely left on the counter to cool and served as soon as they are done (ramen noodles have a time limit!!)   Gyoza is a must have accompaniment when it comes to ramen and the gyoza here is also quite good. Crispy outside, juicy meat filling.   This time around I had the chicken ramen - a very 'assari' flavor (light broth) and the chicken chashu is very tender. I really liked the Tokyo style chicken ramen but they unfortunately removed it with the new menu.   I didn't have the panna cotta this time around but I've had it a couple times in the past. The dessert itself is not super outstanding, but the cookie cubes that accompany the panna cotta adds a great contrast that I enjoy. If you have room after your meal I'd say it's worth trying!   There is often a wait but definitely worth it. A couple of the servers can sometimes be brash with the handling of dishes when serving/removing from table and filling waters."}
{"text":"I tried this place back in November on a Tuesday afternoon around 12pm. I came with some friends (there was about 6-7 of us). it wasn't super busy even at lunch time.   the servers were pretty friendly, so she took our order. two of us were vegetarian/vegan, so we both ordered the vegetable soup ramen (I guess this ramen is also vegan, but isn't stated as so on the menu), and everyone else ordered their meat items.   they started to bring out the bowls of ramen to everyone, our server asked who had ordered the vegetable ramen soup, I had raised my hand, but so did the other girl, and the server gave it to her. not a big deal, I would just wait a bit longer to get mine. next thing I know, the server comes to me and says \"I'm sorry but unfortunately we don't have the ingredients for another vegetable ramen soup\" ...its broth and vegetables, is it not? I went with it and said that's ok, she suggested the creamy vegan one instead because she said it was more popular anyways, so I agreed to it.   it ended up being probably another 25-30 minutes until I finally got my ramen, meanwhile everyone I was with was nearly done with their food.   onto the food: the ramen wasn't bad, the noodles were really good, the tofu was SUPER soft which I'm not sure if I liked or not, and it has some veggies in it. the broth itself was creamy, but it was almost like a strong smokey/hickory flavour, which can be a lot to take in if you eat a lot of it.   the overall experience wasn't good, tons of waiting just to be told my food wasn't able to be made, getting something I didn't enjoy, waiting more time just for the bill and to top it off, it wasn't cheap either, it was around $15, even after ALLLLL that waiting.   (I might be a bit bitter because the vegan girl I was with stole my veggie soup ramen, and I ended up with the vegan ramen, but oh well - still not sure if I would recommend)"}
{"text":"A go-to noodle place. There is not a huge variety in the meny, but it always enough to choose from. Fast service, good food. Also close to the strip so it us very convenient to stop-by on the way home or just to meet with friends for a casual lunch or a dinner."}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite ramen spot! I've been to locations in Houston and Las Vegas several times and never been disappointed."}
{"text":"Service was just horrible!  The busgirl was the only one with some sense of customer service. She was always very attentive.  When the the waiter arrived with our ramen, he seriously just tossed/slid the bowls on to the table and walked off without saying a word and never really check up on how we were doing.  While he walked around being extremely loud with other customers.  He just seemed to ignore us and we didn't understand why. JINYA ramen is overly hyped. Wasn't worth it."}
{"text":"We came here all together 3 people,and then we signed our name on the sheet. We've been waiting for one hour,however people whose name behind us all got call. Guess what,they told us they forgot us. This restaurant really sucks.??3???????????1???????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"Just stopped in to check this place out because all the sushi joints were close at 2pm which was really annoying. So stopped here. So good!! nice find. check it out."}
{"text":"First two times I came here we're alright and the third time I came with a friend it was actually pretty good. It was the fourth ( and the last time that I'm ever coming here) that left me completely disappointed and dissatisfied with the overall food and service. My boyfriend, his friend, and I were sat down at a table where AC was put on blast. I understand it's summer and it's super hot out but I was freezing! Second, the food had absolutely no flavor. I ordered what I usually do (the vegan ramen) and it was completely bland. Third, we had to wait almost 30 min for the waiter to get our cards and check in order for us to be able to pay for our food. The waiter was inattentive for the most part and was kind of rude. As someone who has worked for customer service for a few years now, I usually try to be completely understanding but this was by far one of the worst experiences I've had. I honestly don't understand the hype about this place. I'm guessing it's because they're the only ramen place opened past midnight. Don't bother to waste your time and money here. Monta ramen is so much better; their ramen has so much flavor, service is quick, and attentive."}
{"text":"Normally I would eat here but tonight it's a different night. We ordered for take out and my god what a fucking mess... Yes it taste amazing as usual but the thing about today is how my order was packed... I've worked in various amount of restaurants and I know how to pack to go orders.  Now why in the hell would you stack something heavy on top of something light?!  The soup base was packed all on top and that being said it basically ripped and ruined everything else that comes in ramen aside from the soup, which by the way I paid $2.00 for extra soup which happened to spill out as well...  Tonight really disappointed me   PSA don't order take out. Just deal with the wait and eat in the restaurant.  P.S. normally 5 stars all the way but this time man...."}
{"text":"Whooo whoooo whoooo!! I finally found a decent ramen spot in Vegas! That's what's up!! They have a variety of soup base flavors and a good selection of add ons.   What is going on?! I had the tonkotsu assari with extra sprouts and bok choy. This soup is hitting the spot and helping my tummy ache. And the pork chashu bowl is MmmmMmm good. Washed it down with some hot tea and I'm good to go.  Great for the rainy weather. Try it!"}
{"text":"I love coming to Jinya on a cold winter night! It's a pretty small place so there is usually a wait unless you go early, but the food is well worth it. They have great happy hour specials, and all of the friends I've brought here have enjoyed everything. I'm a fan of the Vegan Ramen in particular, even though I do eat fish. It's creamy, savory, lightly spiced, and combined with the thick noodles and tofu it's OH SO filling. If you enjoy good food and a pretty good buzzing atmosphere, try it out."}
{"text":"I love this place. It really a different Ramen experience. Has a lot more sophistication than most Ramen bars. Decor is nice staff is attentive. Im still trying all of the different Ramen selections. Stay tuned...."}
{"text":"This was my second visit to Jinya. I remember the first time, the food was okay with a kind of saltier-than-average side. I had Spicy Umami Miso Ramen this time. The soup was way too salty. I like Ramen and I like salty food but the soup was way too salty to enjoy the whole bowl. Noodles and toppings were okay and sadly the soup ruined everything.  Just noticed today: I sat at the bar and they have these ramen bowls stacked and displayed on the kitchen counter around the bar. I really hope they don't serve food in these bowls because the countertop and all bowls are covered in thick dust. I bet they haven't cleaned for months. And their kitchen is surrounded by it. With the over saltiness of the food and this dirty condition right in front of my eyes and food, I completely lost my appetite.  I would go somewhere else clean and serve better food. Never again."}
{"text":"I would say this is probably the best ramen place in Vegas. I ordered the dynamite roll as an appetizer and the Tonkotsu black ramen. The ramen was very tasty and had a great touch of garlic to it. The noodles were nice and thin. The soup base was very appealing and I would prob say be top 3 in my book. I highly recommend trying this place out!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite & best ramen places I have ever been in Calgary. The atmosphere is welcoming with the usual Japanese greeting, irasshaimase, (which I tend to say it too when other customers get seated) prior to getting seated. The menu selection is quite large for a ramen bar with a few other unconventional (mini tacos) menu items. There were a lot of ramen flavors to choose from and descriptive on the contents to help better understand.   We ordered JINYA Tokotsu Black, Old Skool & Sukiyaki Q Ramen flavors and all of these ramens were fantastic in flavor (especially the broth), ingredients (the egg was amazing and I recommend to add on more egg), harmonizing flavors and texture. I would go back again to try other ramen flavors. Try Takoyaki, it comes with egg salad which happens to taste really good & Chicken Karaage."}
{"text":"Gotta say I love that this place is open late! Ramen was great and the Gyoza was awesome!!! I was so excited to be eating Ramen which I have been craving for a very long time, that I forgot to take pictures!!! lol.... anyhow I definitely recommend trying out JINYA when you are in vegas!!!"}
{"text":"This place is a small hole in the wall with some awesome ramen and appetizers to offer! Like I said its small so it does fill fast! Only a few 4 tops, 2 two tops and small ramen bar with a huge communal table in the middle. Make a reservation or show up before a rush or you'll be stuck sitting at the communal table. Happy hours pretty good too! 3$ mimosas!"}
{"text":"First place I've ever had ramen & cant find any better! This place is awesome, they offer gluten free noodles and vegan. I've been obsessed since I've had it the first time. The cauliflower is amazing!"}
{"text":"Decided to try this place out since the reviews were so good. Went there on a Tuesday night around 11:00pm. The place was quite empty. Ordered a pint of Sapporo, Spicy Chicken Ramen and Gyoza. The broth for the Spicy Chicken Ramen was very flavorful and had the right amount of spice. I wasn't so sure, but I think they make their own gyoza. Anyway, I couldn't say is the best Japanese Ramen I had; however, I would rate Jinya ramen as one of the top 5 Ramen I had in my life."}
{"text":"The food was good, I got the fried brussel sprouts and curry chicken. The reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because they were out of the following: hot sake, veggie ramen (what!), and a few other options which made ordering a little frustrating. My friends told me about this place and I wanted to give it a fair shake, so I did."}
{"text":"This place was good, but didn't satisfy my ramen craving. The broth was super thick. It was more of a slow cooker stew. I asked for the spiciest chicken ramen and it definitely could have used a better kick. Real spicy ramen for me at least makes me break into a little sweat but this one did nothing.   Now, I'm giving it 4 stars because it was tasty, it just wasn't traditional or what I preferred when it comes to ramen. I ordered the gyoza too which was also delicious and it came with a salad. The dressing was definitely an acquired taste. I loved it but I don't think it's for everyone.   I went during happy hour which surprisingly was from 10pm to 12am on a Sunday. Half price on beer and wine and most of the appetizers. Plus they're open til 3am which is fucking awesome cuz I'm a night owl and it's Vegas so why not?! We got there at the perfect time. No wait. When I left the wait line was well out the door. Call ahead to try and avoid huge delays in seating.   I also tried the shrimp balls which were super good. I've never had anything like those before. They were deep fried, crunchy on the outside and soft and delicious in the inside. I ordered a bun and they forgot to bring it out. I had to remind them about it right in the end and I couldn't really eat it cuz I was full from all the ramen, so that sucked.   Oh they don't carry Asahi in a bottle or on draft, which is my favorite beer, so I substituted with Sapporo on draft and it was just ok. I don't hate Sapporo but I always pair my ramen with Asahi."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!! We went two days in a row. The ramen is delicious!! The broth is so savory!! Highly recommended!! Don't forget to add the fresh garlic to your noodles"}
{"text":"Got food poisoning from their Spicy Miso Ramen I ate yesterday. It was the only thing my family and I had different that day. I haven't had food poisoning like this in awhile. Sick all night and all day *ugh* :("}
{"text":"There's a new ramen restaurant in town and this is not just another ordinary ramen place capitalizing on the new ramen craze in Vegas like many other ramen places popping up around town. This ramen can actually compete with the big names like the Montas or the Soras. So be afraid...Monta, be very afraid...Sora, you finally got some real competition.  The menu is very extensive, you can actually have a complete meal here without having ramen, but since ramen was the reason I was here, that's exactly what I ordered. I went with their most popular which is the tonkotsu black, a very rich in flavor broth with pork chashu and the perfect toppings, fresh onions, fried onions, garlic, nori and a boiled egg and served with perfectly cooked thin noodles.  I had to try the pork broth this time for comparison purposes but on my next visit I'll provably be nicer to my heart and order the chicken broth instead or even the vegetable soup ramen and I hope they're as good as the pork so I can stop here more often without the guilty feeling.  Service was great, I had no problems with my drink being refilled as needed and my waitress was very helpful explaining the menu and making recommendations.  The dining room is very spacious with many booths and tables, a bar facing the open kitchen and a majestic communal table in the middle inviting strangers to become friends by the power of ramen if only for just one meal.  I can see Jinya Ramen becoming one of my favorite restaurants come winter, for I could definitely have ramen here every day, if only my arteries were twice as wide.  #happy hour 3 - 5  = useful."}
{"text":"I really like that they have chicken based soups since I don't like pork based soups. It is limited with chicken based but really the spicy chicken ramen is my favorite. Good service, quality food, and it's a really nice atmosphere"}
{"text":"As much as I wanted to give a higher rating, this small establishment was only okay in my opinion. It's enough to satisfy your ramen fix if you literally cannot find something else in the area. In terms of taste, service, atmosphere, or presentation, I did not find it memorable.  There is quite a good variety of ramen offered. You are welcomed nicely when you enter by staff, but surprisingly, I didn't find service that attentive during the meal even though it wasn't particularly busy when I went (i.e. had to flag down to refill tea a few times)  Personally, I found the broth a little bit too much on the salty side despite not ordering a shio ramen. I also found the pricing to be a tad more than other restaurants even for some of the more common, standard ramens.   Don't think I would return, and given the competition in Toronto, I think I would venture elsewhere for ramen."}
{"text":"This is, hands down, the best ramen in Vegas. The portions are huge, I can rarely finish a bowl of their ramen in one sitting. The sides are delicious, and the beer is inexpensive (compared to other restaurants). Check this place out if you love ramen."}
{"text":"Decent environment. The staff are very friendly and attentive. However, the ramen. (Expecting non spicy) Was spicer than I expected. My fiancé, however who loves spicy felt the spicy could of been more spicy. The octopus balls was very Mayo-e  and had too much bar b que sauce for my taste. I really love the ramen broth but this one seemed a bit watered down."}
{"text":"I really wanted to give this place lower stars but their ramen is too good to not be recognized. Even three is kind of pushing it as customer service is a huge deal to me. First visit was a wonderful drunken night. Didn't matter that the guy serving us completely forgot our order or that 30 mins into sitting he had to ask us what we ordered again. I was just happy to see food when it finally came! Which yes, was absolutely delicious. So hey, I thought to myself.. try this place sober. Living 30 minutes way triggered me to call on and place a pick up order. This being my second visit I'm not too familiar with the menu. Mind you, I also did not have one in front of me. The employee who answered the phone was very sweet at first... but quickly did that change when there was confusion on the menu. Friends that I am also picking up for gave me the details of \" don't get me the black, I don't like how it taste\". So I explained that to her only to get a massive amount of attitude and a condescending tone. She sounded extremely frustrated that I didn't know the menu. To the point that I felt uncomfortable even ordering. I almost hung up and said forget about but due to already almost being there I sucked it up. I did just drive from one side of town to the complete opposite. I've been out of school for 9 years. If I felt like being schooled and schooled about a menu.. I would get a job in the industry serving."}
{"text":"Foods great and the staffs are amazing. They were unable to accommodate our friend the last time they were there  but they remembered and gave us complimentary dish."}
{"text":"Drove from San Francisco ca to Las Vegas for this. You can't go wrong with this place. Ramen is bomb"}
{"text":"One of the best ramen places I've ever been to. LA, Japan and Vegas combined. Love the decor and vibe as well. Oh and the fancy toilet too."}
{"text":"It was a rainy day in Vegas & I knew I needed ramen stat. JINYA had been chillin' in my bookmarks for a while now so I thought it was time to give it a try. I wasn't surprised to see a lot of people waiting outside & inside the restaurant. It's a quaint place so there wasn't really a designated waiting area or chairs at all. The set up of the restaurant is pretty unique. A counter facing the kitchen, tables on all sides of the restaurant & then a massive rectangular wooden table surrounded by stools is in the center of the restaurant. Heads up for large parties-- this is the only place you really can sit at so don't expect to eat facing each other, you'll most likely be sitting side by side & there will probably be a longer wait to accommodate you, although turnaround is quite fast since it's ramen.  Anyway, onto the customer service. It was a really busy night so I pretty much people-watched while we waited for our table. Hostesses were so-so. Not exactly chipper but not entirely rude either. It also wasn't clear who's who. Servers sat people, hostesses took orders. However, it was as organized as it could get for a packed house. Our server Rachel was really sweet. She handled orders for the whole big rectangular table with ease.   Lastly, the food was yummy! I ordered the Premium Tonkotsu White & the fiance had the Chef's Special Tokyo Tonkotsu Ramen. There wasn't much of a difference between ours except for the supposed spicy sauce on mine and fish powder on his. The pork chasu freaking melts in your mouth. MMMM. The taste of the broth was pretty identical for us. One complaint is our ramens were not as hot as we would have wanted. Even with us moving the toppings quickly, the broth was only warm. Also, of course I agree with everyone here. Takoyaki is BOMB & the egg salad at the bottom is just icing on the cake.  Prices are a tad higher than other ramen bars in town but that's what you get for eating at a super hip ramen bar right? All in all, I'm sure I'll be back. Vegas just needs to stay colder for a little bit more. :)"}
{"text":"Been here way too many times to count! Food is amazing and the service is ALWAYS quick!"}
{"text":"Came here with it being highly recommended.  It did not disappoint.  Service awesome and food was almost flawless.  Gf soup was a lil cold but they remedied it quickly and with a great attitude."}
{"text":"Hmm, where do I put Jinya... That's the million dollar question. But after careful consideration, I believe 4 stars is accurate. This is probably my toughest place to review, so bear with me...  First time I was here, I ordered the tonkatsu assuri, their cheapest ramen at 7.90. I thought the flavor was ok, but it didn't blow me away. My friend ordered a veggie ramen, he said that he liked it a lot, but I thought that was ok.  I came next during their HH and sampled the world renowned Jinya bun and crispy chicken, aka karage. Things were starting to look up!! The Jinya bun is a pork belly bao, and probably ranks up there with Wendy's ribeye bao. It's grilled with a delicate BBQ sauce, and it is extremely tender, and the fat is nice and melty. It's a little pricy at 3.00 during HH. The karage is a great deal during HH. This isn't your normal, popcorn chicken sized crispy chicken. These are 5 large hunks of chicken, that are super crispy and moist!! So good! I do have regrets of not ordering the quinoa salad that a neighboring table ordered, it looked very appetizing.  On my last visit, I was feeling full from a late lunch so I decided to get something small so I ordered the small pork chashu bowl. The best part of this bowl was the rice, it was perfectly cooked. I was disappointed in the pork chashu. It looked like the leftover bits from the Jinya bun meat. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't that great, there wasn't a lot of fat on it, but it wasn't dry. Overall, I thought it was kinda bland.  The service here is really good. They really do a good job of taking care of you. The ambiance is really great, especially the large communal table in the center. I don't know if this would be my go to ramen spot, especially with so many unique ramen spots in town, but it has a great vibe and would be a fun hangout spot with friends."}
{"text":"Oops, this one slip through the crack among the reviews.  I suppose you have say the word JINYA with a yelling voice since it is all capitalized?  During our quest to hunt down ramen in Vegas, we found JINYA in strip mall on Flamingo Rd, which was a little different since I was once told all the ramen places are on Spring Mtn Rd in Vegas.  It was not too busy when we went in the afternoon, and the place was quite big.  We started with some Fresh Tofu and it took a while to prepare, but it was totally worth it, since it came out quite awesome from tofu liquid and turned into solid within seconds, and you can customize the flavor you want with different amount of toppings and sauce.  The Dynamite was ok, a little too heavy on the Americanized flavors for my taste.  The Jinya Black Ramen was surprisingly delicious, it had a nice balance with the broth, meat was tender, noodles were cooked al dente, and egg was perfect soft boiled, not quite an onsen tamago.  We ended our meal with some Green Tea Mochis that were just regular mocha, and the Tofu Almond Dessert, which was very nice and refreshing.  I am surprised to found out this to be a chain later, and they definitely kept up the quality at this location.  The menu was big enough for me to return here again in the future.  The staffs were also friendly as well, not the same typical Asian restaurant service you would get."}
{"text":"Great great service but not one of the cooks are wearing a hair net and 2 of the men have very long hair while handling and cooking my food"}
{"text":"I have never had ramen in Las Vegas before and I tried this place and it was ok. It was packed during lunch and the wait was not that bad. I like the community table where everyone shares a table together. I ordered the pork ramen and it tasted mediocre. I wish the noodles were softer, I felt the starchy flour when I bit into them. The waitresses were a bit grumpy and we had to request several times for water and sauce. They just walked away with no response whenever we asked for something. It was a bit odd."}
{"text":"Open till 3 a.m. in the morning?!?! Hell yeah!!! I love me some ramen! Not because I am asian (well, most likely because of that but who's judging righht?) But because I love how ramen makes everything feel so much better. Cold? Have some ramen! Sick? Have some Ramen! \"Ramen for you, Ramen for you! Ramen for everybody!\"   Now let's get serious! Not too famaliar with ramen? Go ahead and order their, \"Spicy Chicken Ramen!\"  The dish is acca-mazing. Order it level, \"spicy!\" (For my, \"spice-cravers\" go ahead and kick it up a notch! It really isn't spicy as they claim.)  The dish is already garnished with two slices of meat, some beansprouts, spinach, etc... Not enough garnish for you? Well my friend? You are in luck! Go ahead and choose all the other options you want! \"BOK-CHOY? SPINACH!? CORN!? BUTTER?! MORE MEAT?!\" ADD IT ALL! Like I said, no judgement here.  You even get to choose the type of home made noodles you want in your dish!  There side orders are even more amazing. I tried everything and its, \"mmm- mmm-gewd!\" Especially the crispy rice and ahi tuna (i think that's what it's called).  Service: I have to say it's great but not amazing! Sounds bad but it's not that bad. The only comment I have is that some of their servers might need to remove there tunnel vision. I would've gave a five star but i think my friends and I sat there waiting on our waiter to come by with the check but she never showed. Maybe she was busy, and or left but some waiter ended up helping us.   The End."}
{"text":"After many trips to this ramen shop, a review was on its way.  So, service today was pretty good. It's was a little busy, but warm and the servers worked hard.  Now to the food. This ramen is good for a very biased and specific reason; Brussel sprouts. Before I continue to my favorite part, though, we had the Brussels sprout appetizer, the chicken bun, and the creamy tempura. The sprouts were lightly salted and super crunchy, so good. The chicken bun had an awesome sweetness and creaminess as well as a great texture. Every bite, you're met with the crunchiness of the outside of the chicken and the juicy, tenderness on the inside. The tempura was very good. The fidelity of the crunchiness was not compromised by the sauce. It wasn't soggy or hard. It was just right.   Now to my favorite part, the ramen. You're met with the usual umami: heavy pork flavor and al dente noodles. This ramen is excellent due to one thing: Brussel sprouts. The deep fried sprouts not only add texture, but the lightness and the bitterness of the sprouts refresh your palate. This is a ramen you can eat without getting fatigued. Get brussel sprouts!!!  Lastly I ordered the block bar. It's sweet lol.  Will eat again!!"}
{"text":"The Vegan options here are so yummy!!!! They have cashew and green beans, caramelized cauliflower, and a vegan ramen bowl. This place is usually pretty busy, but worth it. The bathrooms here are amazing with heated toilets. Overall great experience dining it, and wonderful presentation when you order take out. They package everything separately so it doesn't get soggy or anything. I eat here all. The. Time!!!! Def recommend for vegans!"}
{"text":"Reading the other reviews that are heavily negative, I think people are being too harsh on this newly opened restaurant. Whatever their reason is, I don't think this place deserves a 1 star!  Went there for lunch with a colleague on Friday, I had the white premium tontaksu (prob spelt it wrong) and my friend had the black tontaksu. The broth was VERY flavourful and thick without being overly salty (yums). The pork was not as fatty as some other ramen places so that was nice. My ramen came with thin noodles which I liked and my friend's ramen came with thick noodles. Properly soft boiled eggs / seasoned eggs. We both enjoyed our ramen! (It's comparable to Santouka in Vancouver)  We also ordered the crispy chicken and it was super fresh. I'm guessing it's breaded in-house with their own seasoning and fried to order. Will definitely order again.   It did take awhile till our food came to the table though, but I'm guessing that's because they only opened a few days ago. But with good company, a nice decor and delicious ramen, it's worth the wait."}
{"text":"I have tried a few different ramen places throughout Vegas, and this is by far my favorite I have been to. The inside of this restaurant is so cool! The music they play creates an awesome ambiance. The restaurant is very small, but they didn't cram tables so close together so you can really enjoy your experience & meal. The lights are dimmed and they use really cool lamps to just add to the vibe. Perfect for a date!;)   I have tried their edamame, veggie ramen bowl, spicy chicken ramen bowl and the salad that comes with their combo. The spicy chicken bowl was my absolute favorite! I got mild and it added a little flavor, but I definitely could have gotten medium spice for a little kick. I also added cilantro and it made the bowl taste AMAZING!   The staff are all so nice as well. I really enjoyed my time there, not only because of the food, but the restaurant itself. Must try!"}
{"text":"Nasty! I ordered the pork chashu bowl and the rice was so undercooked. Pork was just ok.  I prefer Monta on there pork belly bowl.  Ordered a Jinya bun and the one side of the bun was so soggy and the braised pork tasted like fish.  Also,  ordered shrimp balls and it was VERY bland and it was sooooo crunchy I couldn't finish them.  It tasted like the oil was old."}
{"text":"I liked my experience at Jinya.  I  had the spicey miso ramen. The broth was tasty, and it came with a good amount of noodles. The rest of the family shared the Jinya buns, gyoza, and chicken karaage. My youngest had a kids set dinner. It was probably the best deal out of everything on the menu. It came with a small bowl of ramen, rice with chicken, a small salad, chicken karraage, and a small scoop of icecream for dessert. All of that for $8. We also ordered the Mochi with icecream for the adults. The young gentleman that served us was friendly and efficient. He also said he was the guy that uploads all the Instagram pics for the restaurant. I guess Facebook and Twitter are also new additions to social media.  I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Disclaimer: I have not yet been to Monta or Ramen Sora yet, so I can't compare it to them.  JINYA FEATURES THE BEST RAMEN I HAVE HAD IN LAS VEGAS!!!    We arrived at 6:00 on a Wednesday night and were seated right away.  The server made helpful suggestions, and our ramen came out extremely quickly - perfect because we were in a rush.  I had the Tonkotsu Black and it was perfect!  The broth was very hearty and flavorful.  Additionally, you can add \"ramen seasoning,\" which is in a bottle on the table to make it even tastier!  It also comes with the infamous soft-boiled egg that was cooked to perfection.  The noodles were relatively thin for ramen and soft, but it was delicious.  The chashu pork was also great!  The price was also very reasonable.  I also ordered the Jinya Bun as an appetizer and it was delicious and a little fatty (which I love, but understand it is not everyone's favorite).  This is where the service was a little weird because they forgot to bring our appetizer before the ramen and after we mentioned it to the server, she still forgot to bring it out.  This was a tiny mistake that was overshadowed by the AMAZING RAMEN!!  I have been looking for outstanding ramen here in Las Vegas because it is so easy to make mediocre ramen.  I think I have found my place and I HIGHLY ENCOURAGE everyone to try out Jinya!"}
{"text":"My first time at a Ramen joint and WOW! What a great experience. Very hip, inexpensive, and FABULOUS food. I ordered the meal \"hot\". Definitely HOT - and I know hot. Seriously, it was hot - yet, still great flavor. Enough heat that it stuck with you - right up to the VERGE of uncomfortable and still not. GO HERE!"}
{"text":"I was surprised by how good the ramen was given the yelp rating wasn't that high. My husband got the black garlic ramen with thin noodles. The soup was FULL of umami flavor. The fried chicken was medium juicy but very crunchy (more battered style) and he got that as a combo with the ramen. The vegetarian ramen was ALSO surprisingly good and I highly recommand it even though I am normally a sucker for pork bone based soups!  The brussel sprouts tempera was lacking flavor but I dipped it in the soup and it tasted amazing!   Will come back again!"}
{"text":"best ramen in vegas. the spicy vegan is my favorite! cant go wrong with their noodle refill too!!"}
{"text":"Meh. The food is decent. I wasn't  disappointed but I wasn't like omg this is soooo good either. Add the very mediocre /semi bad service , a little bit pricey items besides their happy hour options and it's just ok. I'm willing to give it another shot , but I'm not rushing to come back anytime soon either. Quite honestly I would rather drive a little ways for fukumimi or wait a little bit longer for monta."}
{"text":"Pros  Takoyaki: Jinya did an excellent job on the octopus pancake balls. The octopus wasn't chewy or rubbery. The sauces and garnishes was just as good and I love the chunks of eggs incorporated into the Japanese mayonnaise sauce.   Tonkotsu Black Ramen: the broth was extremely thick with the thin noodles being cooked just right. The chasu was delicate and the soft boiled egg oozed as you bite into it. The overall ramen was great; however, they should really kick it up a notch with the garlic flavors which was missing in the broth considering the garlic chips and garlic oil didn't do much justice.   Service: the best service I received from Vegas overall. My waitress was super attentive and nothing but smiles throughout the evening. I made an order for ramen without green onions and before placing my order to the chef, she went back and asked to make sure that I didn't want green onions in my takoyaki as well. She went the extra mile to make sure I got my food to exactly how I liked.  Seating: compared to Monta Ramen where you're cramped into a tiny space, there was more spacious seating. Also the restaurant itself was much more cleaner and attractive."}
{"text":"Ramen is nice... now is so many ramen restaurant. This place is one of it. I want to get something special. But service is good. One of the Japanese quality!"}
{"text":"Delicious ramen with many options, rice bowls, appetizers, and even desserts. Service was great. Wait was long, but that's when you know a place is good. They allow take-out. It's my favorite ramen spot in town."}
{"text":"Not a fan whatsoever. Ordered food last night and then ended up with explosive diarrhea and heavy vomiting all night long. Got the California Bowl and it did not treat me right. Definite food poisoning. But I'm sure that happens a lot in the restaurant industry are close to me and I will never eat at this restaurant again. Thanks guys"}
{"text":"Been to 5 ramen places here in Vegas and by far, this has the best tasting ramen in the valley. Believe the hype.   This is not a traditional ramen place by any means but I think that's a good thing. Their broth is spectacular. I ordered the Black Tonkatsu Ramen and it had an excellent balance of tasty and smooth. Everything else in the ramen was balanced perfectly. You can really tell (taste) the craft behind the dish.  Be wary though as this place will probably always have a long waiting line. Good sign of great food, bad if you're impatient. The place has a big center table that I think they can get rid off to make space for more chairs. It is a bit stuffy on the inside but you came for the ramen, not to chill.   If you don't like to wait, I see them do \"to-go\" orders. Lifehack.   Food 5/5 Venue 4/5 Price 5/5 Service 5/5"}
{"text":"First time getting ramen ever (besides top ramen) and i have to say that it was amazing. Very surprised at the quality of the food and services. Everyone's nice the atmosphere is new and modern with a little twist. They have set the bar very high! Will be coming back again soon! :)"}
{"text":"Great for a fun date night! Great atmosphere and great selection of ramen. A bit pricy compared to other ramen restaurants but you won't be disappointed on the flavor and quality. We will most certainly be back!"}
{"text":"Food is good, service is sh**t, servers on their phone while we are sitting at the bar NOT being waited on, no introduction to A server, no drinks, as we sit. Waited longer than 5 minutes to be greeted and im sure if we didnt ask the host to be greeted we wouldve waited longer."}
{"text":"Cool music and a dark and typically packed setting greets you upon arrival to Jinya. I had the tonkatsu assarri, a California roll, and a salad. The salad was very fresh not a browning leaf in sight! The California roll was also good. I could actually smell the tonkatsu assarri ramen as it approached my table. The broth has a deep and savory flavor, the bean sprouts are crunchy and fresh, and the pork is succulent and tender. They add a little of a spicy sort of sesame oil on top of the broth that gives it a little bit of a kick, in a good way! Overall I really enjoyed this spot it's a very cool little restaurant and it's open way late! This may actually become my new go to ramen place."}
{"text":"One busy Friday night  10 parties away from being called  Seated within 30 minutes Soup was aight Need to try a couple more times"}
{"text":"I finally made it here to find out what all the hype is about. It is well deserving. Intimate dining room, friendly staff who knows their stuff. I am vegan and immediately my server knew how to modify menu items to fit my dietary orientation. The house made tofu is a delight and the soup is so flavorful. Nice beer list and of course the open until 3 am is a major plus! Great spot."}
{"text":"Ambiance is very cute. Reminds me of Ramen spots in NY. Service was great. Food was amazing!!"}
{"text":"So happy they have a veggie ramen and the tempura  brussels sprouts were bomb! Open late and the staff is very friendly."}
{"text":"This is the newest Ramen spot in Las Vegas, me and my wife wanted to try since we do like trying new resto's and trying to compare with the one's that we tried before we checked out the Happy Hour which is 3-5 pm.   We ordered the Jinya Bun which is definitely a must try, it sweet, and juicy, the karaage was excellent, and quinoa salad was something refreshing and definitely something new.   The Ramen was OK though.   The service was great. The Ramen plus the excellent sides I would definitely come back to try other side dishes on their menu. Over all I would definitely  come back."}
{"text":"Edamame was extremely over salted, the crispy chicken was so salty, our gyoza was clearly fried with the tempura oil (tasted strongly of tempura) and the menma (bamboo shoots) in the ramen clearly wasn't cut properly (the bamboo shoot was half the size of my hand). They also discontinued the gluten free ramen (which was the main reason I even came here) even though it was on several places in their menu and website. Ramen was not very authentic. I was disappointed having tried many ramen joints in North America and Japan. Price is great which is why I gave one star. If you are thinking of going somewhere else, definitely do that."}
{"text":"Tried an order of the crispy chicken, seriously disappointed, then opted for the spicy chicken jinya (medium heat) and it was pretty tasty! However it was a bit pricy and I thought it was a bit steep to pay over $20 for a bowl of ramen and a plate of crispy chicken that really wasn't all that great. But, I know better next time. Stick with the authentic dishes! :D Also, side note. When I reordered for the jinya, I didn't get my food until everyone in my party was completely done eating. (It sucks being the last person still eating, and eating a full bowl of ramen!) And, every other random guest in the place, even the ones that came in, sat down, AND ordered after me, got their food before I did. Literally, every single guest was served before I was.... That was a HUGE let down. I'm not one to pester the servers but unfortunately, I had to do just that to make sure they knew I had been waiting far past a reasonable time."}
{"text":"I accidentally ran into this place and I thought that it was an old Arby's or strip club.  After sitting down and having a crazy great server named Alecia (sic I'm sure) I was totally stoked to eat my meal. This place is truly a hidden gem."}
{"text":"I love this place. My favorite ramen place in Vegas!! They have takoyaki too! The eggs in the ramen were perfect! I had their garlic ramen and OMG! Delicious! Will definitely come again and again.  The place looks really nice too."}
{"text":"The service was excellent. The waitress was very helpful with menus. I loved Cha Cha Cha ramen with fresh garlic. It was really delicious. I also ordered and highly recommended Jinya bun. The pork was tender and well-seasoned. I will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"This place has the best spicy vegan ramen.  I'd come back anytime for then. Service is great. Love the atmosphere as well."}
{"text":"There was a long wait during lunch time but they managed to get everyone seated in a timely manner. We got served quickly, one of my friends was stirring her soup and a fly flies right into her soup. I then look around the place and there's flies everywhere. Luckily, they weren't bothering anyone but there were so many!   Soup was delicious and good price. When we left, I noticed the back door was open and that's probably where the flies were coming in. Small and great place for ramen, minus the flies!!"}
{"text":"I used to come here often but it is starting to slowly change on their offers. The food and service is great, but the place no longer feels the same.  Things on the menu no longer offer everything they used to have. I went in Monday night 10:00PM and was told that they do not have a happy hour when it was sitting on our table that specified 3-5PM & 10-12PM. The happy hour menu barely had any items on it as most were taken off and they covered it with \"DISCONTINUED.\" I've also noticed that they do not have sushi rolls on their menu anymore. Even though on their website still listed a wider selection of items that I looked forward to enjoy, but feel disappointed when stepping inside.   Hope that they will fix the menu back to be better."}
{"text":"Finally got to try this place out !! Let me start with the building and location ! Sits by itself and is very tiny ! A little messy outside with some trash and graffiti around the building! Sidewalks are dirty and doors / glass were also dirty !   Surprise inside again very small but very busy ! Decor is nice other than the benches are a little sticky cause they use water to wipe down instead of pledge !   The service was great ! Everyone was very helpful and checked in on you ! Could have used more ice in my water !   The food was amazing!! We had a crispy chicken that was fried and it was incredible! The Pork Gyoza  was really yummy ! I had the Cha Cha Cha and it is awesome ! The broth is very heavy with the right amount of Ramen and Pork ! Very good Garlic taste ! My mom had a chicken ramen and had a thinner noodle and on the sweeter side ! Both were good and would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"This was a great place to go to for ramen. I've tried a bunch of other places before but Jinya really stood out! The service was great! I ordered the Tonkatsu black; the soup to noodle ratio was perfect. The noodles weren't drowning in the soup. There weren't enough vegetables in my opinion and as well the base was a bit too salty for me. I had to drink a couple of glasses of water after finishing my ramen. They do offer vegetarian ramen which is great since ramen places only offer pork or chicken bases."}
{"text":"Just ordered Tonkatsu #3, the flavor isn't what I expected.  It tastes a lot like Shin ramen noodle cup from the super market. Not really special.  But it's a good place to hang out with friends.  Friendly staff, nice environment and vibe."}
{"text":"The food was great,  having said that, the staff could've been more personable.  I do think the food spoke for itself. I would recommend this place to others. Thanks for the great ramen."}
{"text":"I really like the food, and have visited multiple times. I give my stars for its very hip and local aesthetic, tasty food with vegan choices and drinks, and its fancy toilet (I'm totally not kidding here).  I say come here if you have time to spare to wait, and not in a rush. Dinner time is really busy and if you have 3+ people,  its definitely a wait.Lunch time is pretty tame however. There is a good variety of food on the menu, so you can have salads, tofu, fried chicken, rice with curry, and of course ramen. Ramen here is a little salty here for my tastebuds, but the broth is quite good and thick.  The fried or karage chicken is defnitely a dish to try when you're here.  Some things I have noticed is that, spoons aren't a given, you have to ask for them now. Might not be an issue if you drink from the bowl though! Service was a miss for me sadly. Although staff was friendly, there was mix ups in our orders and some time for our orders to come out. But hey! Might have been an off day.  Definitely give the place a try, I'll look forward to this Jinya's improvement next time round."}
{"text":"This is, I think, the best ramen place in Vegas.  I may be incorrect, as there are per square mile something like 500% more restaurants in Las Vegas than other standard cities, but for now, this is what I'm sticking to.  The broths are delicious and the noodles are to die for.  Good god, eat it.  Eat it now."}
{"text":"After a night of drinking, Jinya ramen is exactly what you want. But you don't need to be inebriated to appreciate the richness of the black ramen broth. It is a solid bowl of ramen. The best part is that it comes with a whole egg, rather than half of an egg. Essential."}
{"text":"FINALLY found a worthy rival to the infamous Monta ramen. I would go so far as to say that Jinya rivals that of Monta but I know most others don't agree. The reason I would say it does is because of the Black Tonkotsu ramen. The broth has such a deep deep flavor of pork and is so very rich. Makes me drool just thinking about it. If you don't enjoy the porky flavor as much then I recommend the Jinya chicken ramen. Its half chicken and half pork broth. The chicken broth really lightens the porky flavor but also compliments it. Skinny noodles were good, similar to Monta. Other item I tried were the fried brussel sprouts. Didn't think I would enjoy it but I guess anything fried tastes good. Other than that, service was fast, efficient, and friendly. Definitely found my new ramen spot!"}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend are ramen obsessed, so when we yelped this place we were hesitant to go because it's a little bit of a drive from us, but let me tell you...it was well worth it!  Ramen is bomb here!!! Definitely making another trek out for it soon!"}
{"text":"The place was nicely decorated and staff was very nice. One downside of restaurant was that it was very chilly in there when we went today. I ordered takoyaki and no.3 ramen with pork chatsu. Huge portions. Ramen wasn't best of what I have had but it was good. Broth was too salty to me. The takoyaki was great though."}
{"text":"I'm going to give this place another try, but my first experience there wasn't great.  I'll start with the good. The decor is really cute, it'd be a good place for a casual date. The staff is really nice, we didn't wait at all to be seated or our order to be taken. My husband had the Spicy Chicken Ramen and said it was delicious, portion size was good and it was served pretty quickly, unfortunately that's where the problems began.  I'm a vegan, and they have a vegan option which was super exciting for me since vegan ramen is hard to come by. My excitement ended when I was informed that it wasn't available, I asked when it would be and they have no idea. So why even have it on the menu?!? They do have a vegetarian option, but my fellow vegans know there's a difference between vegetarian and vegan. I ended up getting a simple order of a vegetable roll and steamed rice. My food arrived 15 minutes AFTER my husband got his ramen. Everyone knows there's nothing more awkward than eating while the other person just watches.They were nice enough to let me know my food was on its way but by then I was already pretty annoyed. My food was just ok.  I'm gonna give this place another chance and hopefully it'll be a lot better."}
{"text":"This is my favorite ramen place in California and in Vegas. I always order the Jinya Chicken Ramen and it's so delicious and flavorful. I like it because it's lighter than other usual ramen broths were its normally really salty. I add an egg and call it a day and it's pure perfection. I also really like their pork buns!  Price is reasonable. About $10 for a huge ramen bowl. Service is great and the ambiance is nice and somewhat dim and moody. Oh and major bonus points for their bathroom and their amazing Japanese toilets that have seat warmers and other fun functions!  I love how this location isn't too far from the strip. So if you want to get out of the Strip for a bite to eat, this is your place. Totally worth coming here for lunch or dinner!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, service and food!  The place is offers about eight tables and a large communal table that seats about a dozen.   I love their Cilantro Lime Ramen which you can substitute thick or skinny noodles.   The broth is clear with nice lime and chili flavors, not too spicy, just right!  For appetizers we selected their Truffle Oil Brussel Sprouts, which are good in flavor just a little heavy on the tempura batter.  Next we tried their Pork Chashu Bowl which I did not care for much and wish they had a little more seasoning or char.   They offer a good variety of appetizers, ramen and sushi.  Overall a great ramen place with a modern vibe! I would like to get around to try some of their other ramen specials but I can't get away from their Cilantro Lime Ramen goodness!"}
{"text":"Food is good but the service is horrible all 3 times I've been here the waitress have no sense of urgency and there's no excuse I've been here during rushes and also during slow times where there are 3 waitresses and only a handful of tables and it's been the same service every time I don't know if it's company policy to not check on tables throughout their meals or clear plates when you see them stacked up and put to the side or to take 10 minutes to bring a check after someone has asked and then take another 10 to pick it up and bring it back to close it out this last time was probably the fastest we've gotten the check and it still took a long time"}
{"text":"I'm going to give them a 5 star due to being busy but the food was good....kinda upset they didn't know mango mochi existed. Other than that it was ok"}
{"text":"my husbands and i's go to place for ramen. nice place and good best ramen weve been too so far."}
{"text":"Can't really speak 100% because me and a couple of friends came when we were STARVING but someone recommended this place and it was pretty bomb. The wait was pretty long, we were a group of 5 and had to wait like 20-25 minutes for a table, so I wish the place was bigger but I'm glad they had a coat rack for all of our stuff. I got the JINYA Tonkatsu Black and it was sooo good, it really fills you up while still making you want more but if you're not a fan of mushroom, i don't think you'd like it. My friends got the Spicy Umami Miso Ramen and the best way to describe it is basically what all spicy instant noodles TRY to be. Its really nice, not too spicy with thick noodles and oooh the chashu pork is so tender and good. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"This is my favorite ramen place in Vegas so far.  I took my mom there for a late lunch.  We were seated  within a few minutes of arriving.  We shared a gyoza appetizer that was flavorful and perfectly cooked.  Mom ordered a veggie ramen and I had spicy tonkatsu.  This is the only place I have been that does not slice the chashu paper thin.  It gives the broth tremendous depth of flavor.  The menu has a variety of choices and it is a great place to take a newbie because the menu is so varied.  I will keep going back.  This place rocks."}
{"text":"I would probably have to say they have the best Japanese ramen in town! Definitely would try their noodle soups out!! Beware of weekends, lines tends to get long!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Two entirely different vegetarian options available and both are great (although the creamy spicy version is my choice). My girlfriend claims they have the best eggs, just perfectly seasoned or whatever it is they do with them. Major bonus points for a beer selection available by the pitcher (is it weird I find this article rarity in Toronto?) Also great appetizer selections (try the tempura brussels sprouts!). And they yell an adorable greeting at you when you enter and leave. It's all so perfect!"}
{"text":"I got take out delivered through Postmates, so I can't speak to the restaurant, but this food is incredible.  Absolutely delicious, high quality, great prices. This is my new go to for ramen.  Well done Jinya!  We had the spicy tonkatsu ramen, pork gyoza, and veggie rolls - everything was delicious.  Also, I saw the previous reviewer mention cleanliness, so I looked it up and the most recent rating was \"A\" - it was the top rated ramen spot in Vegas."}
{"text":"Jinya is a welcome addition to the local ramen scene.  Actually, the scene is getting too hot that some of the otherwise good joints have closed down and considering that, Jinya seems to have attracted a solid customer base.  My favorite so far is \"Tonkotsu Assari\", as mentioned by Philip T it is a basic, no cheat fare. Tonkotsu Black is also good and rich, but it can be too heavy when I'm not super hungry.  Jinya is also one of the closest, most accessible ramen spots from the strip when we have a visiting friend.  Overall, I'm very happy with their food and service."}
{"text":"JINYA, JINYA, JINYA - the ramen that Las Vegas has been asking for. Granted, I've only had ramen at three other restaurants, but JINYA is definitely at the top.  The broth is deep, rich, and flavorful. Toppings are varied and fresh. My greatest praise of JINYA is that they have spicy ramen, and the broth is actually spicy! The chashu pork is thick but delicate with melt-in-your-mouth fat. Even their chicken bowls have chicken \"chashu\" that isn't that differentiated from the pork variety (meaning it's just as delicious even without the melt-in-your-mouth fat).  JINYA offers pretty awesome appetizers and tapas (takoyaki, anyone?). The karaage is always a necessary order as well. I have paid the price of a burnt tongue many times just to consume these succulent pieces of fried chicken. But, what's really killer is their brussels sprouts tempura. Although already a lover of those mini cabbages, the thin, crunchy, and slightly salted tempura version is even better. Wish each order came with more because they are addicting.  The atmosphere is amazing as well. The wood detailing, dark lighting, and posters of Ramen Life make it a pretty cool late night place to go to with friends. Not to mention the bathrooms have Japanese robot toilets. I almost gave JINYA four out of five stars, but those toilets..."}
{"text":"I am writing this review as my first Ramen Noodle experience so I can't compare it to other places yet. It was such a great experience and I can't wait to try other spots around the city.   I went with my sister on a Wednesday evening at 5pm and it wasn't busy at all so we were seated right away. To be honest I thought there would be more diners at this time especially since it's soup weather now!  I went with the Cha Cha Cha, Crispy Chicken combination and my sister got the Spicy Chicken Ramen so we could try both. As other reviewers recommended we got the free fresh garlic to add to our soup as per our taste.   Firstly, the salad was simple, but the dressing was delicious and made for a good start to my meal. Then the chicken was really good and flavourful, not your typical, boring, fried chicken.  As for the Cha Cha Cha, I loved the seasoned egg, it was cooked perfectly so that it was both runny and a bit hard boiled. I added about 3 cloves of garlic to my soup and it was such garlicky goodness! I also added the Ramen sauce and the spicy seasoning provided at the table which were great additions. The Pork Chashu was perfectly tender and went very well with the flavour of the broth. I only managed to eat about half of my bowl because it was so filling so I took the rest to go.    For the Spicy Chicken Ramen, I thought the broth had very good flavour and I loved the Spinach in it. My sister got the mild and it wasn't that spicy so she added some more heat to it at the table.  Both the thin and the thick noodles were great, but I preferred the thick ones. They weren't actually as thick as I had imagined they would be which was perfect.  Because it's the closest Ramen spot to my work I will definitely be back again and will try some of the other soups. As others mentioned it's a bit on the pricey side, but it is very filling and delicious!  I have returned to Jinya and tried the Spicy Creamy Vegan Ramen and it was spicy creamy goodness! I opted to add spinach noodles for an additional $2.00 and it was worth it. I enjoyed this ramen even more than the Cha Cha Cha. I happened to go on a Friday and they had a pitcher of Sapporo on sale for a great price! Also their hot sauce is on point, great heat and flavour."}
{"text":"I've tried multiple ramen places in vegas, and this was one of the better ones! I love that they are open so late! I think this place will be my go to when I'm in town and want a late night snack! In Japan, ramen is a drunk food and a lot of the places are open late. So it was definitely nice to be able to eat darn good ramen at 2:30 in the morning! Jinya Tonkotsu Black was so good!! And I love all the toppings that they offer!   They're coming to Chicago and I hope they're as good as the one in Vegas!!!"}
{"text":"I love me some ramen. This place is one of the best in Vegas.  Get the combo to get your fill. The salad dressing was very tasty. The fresh garlic on the side was a plus. I love me some garlic. But why are Ramen places so small. Place filled up by noon. Also, the spinach noodles are excellent."}
{"text":"Ok, no joke, one of the BEST bowls of ramen I've ever had! I got the spicy creamy vegan ramen with spinach noodles and added mushrooms & Bock Choy. Omg I finished the whole thing. The flavor was amazing! Can't wait to come back for more!"}
{"text":"recommend cha cha cha ramen! The soup is very good! Also the tokoyaki is very tasty."}
{"text":"I love noodles, but ramen is always a tricky because one of us doesn't eat pork, and most ramen broths are made from pork bones. Jinya offered more than one option for chicken ramen so we thought we would give it a try. Our server recommended the Kara Men special for me and it did not disappoint...hot and spicy with loads of ground pork in the rich broth! Too bad the noodles were super thin and that substitutions would cost extra. I'd love to try it with regular ramen. Hubby had the spicy chicken ramen, which was loaded with big pieces of chicken. The broth wasn't as rich as the pork broth (to be expected), but still very tasty. Kid had a soft shell crab bun (messy but tasty), tofu salad (also tasty but not what she expected when ordering a salad) and we all shared the tempura Brussel sprouts (very tasty!). The food is good here...but what dampened our experience is the sheer volume of the music, which lead to louder conversations and shouting from the staff and patrons. Not a place to meet up to catch up! Service is friendly and helpful and the decor is modern and chic."}
{"text":"Food 4/5 (60% of final grade) The ramen itself is incredibly fresh, and the soup base wasn't overly heavy, but the real star of the meal for me was the seasoned egg. It. Was. PHENOMENAL. The outside of this Japanese-style-soft-boiled egg was tinged brown by the ramen soy sauce used to marinate it, and the yolk inside was a bright orange the consistency of thick custard-- an incredible mingling of weight in the yolk and soft texture of the egg white. I was really tempted to add another $2 for a noodle re-fill, but the food baby born to me did not agree with that notion. YOU MUST TRY THE SEASONED EGG. NOT THE ONSEN EGG (which is a poached egg with soy-sauce). THE SEASONED EGG. Reminded me of Gudetama.   Ambiance 3/5 (10% of final grade) I went around 6PM on a weekday, and the ambiance was quite nice. It was winter, so it was already really dark outside. Inside was dimly lit on purpose for ambiance, and the interior was largely chrome-black themed. The only draw-back were the washrooms-- they were disappointing at best.   Service 3/5 (10% of final grade) Nobody seemed like they hated working there, so that's a plus when someone is writing down your order. It was also pleasant for them to welcome customers by shouting out \"irashai\" (\"welcome\" in japanese) in unison (though there was one waiter that very obviously stumbled over the pronunciation of the greeting). When I requested for less salt and oil in my ramen, they were very happy to oblige, which is always a nice thing to have instead of rolling eyes.  Cost 3/5 (10% of final grade) $12 for a bowl of good-quality ramen (before tax and tip) is quite a bargain when you're downtown. The aforementioned egg was also only $1.50/egg, so for me that was INCREDIBLE.   Brownie Points 3/5 (10% of final grade) If only for the seasoned egg. And the cool, thoughtful coat hooks they had underneath the long table by the door with the stools.   Final Grade = 72/100 = 4 Stars  TLDR: Try the gudetama-esque, seasoned, soft-boiled egg. The place is small, but it's perfectly suitable to accommodate a small group of four friends or a date. If you are within a 15 minute drive, do swing by ;)"}
{"text":"Quinoa salad was diferent and delicious. Soups are amazing. The bar and sharing tables are cool."}
{"text":"The ramen here tastes like Chinese egg noodle.  Not very good.  Also they took forever to seat people when there are tons of empty seats.  There is a nice young environment here so that's the only great thing.  Food is small portions so you will need to order extras and also it's very very dark here with loud music so be prepared for that."}
{"text":"Jinya is a ramen chain, but the restaurant felt like it was its own. The restaurant was easy to find and there was plenty of parking spaces.  Didn't get any apps to start with, just wanted to get straight to the ramen.  A friend that I was with had the spicy chicken ramen and I had the cha cha cha ramen.  The cha cha cha ramen is 'for garlic lovers'. I love garlic. So much. And although I thought there was garlic flavour in the actual ramen bowl, our server had given me a garlic press and a small container with fresh garlic. Totally fine with that.  The ramen was very flavourful and the broth was fantastic. It was well seasoned and the pork chashu was very tender. I loved the chewiness of the thick noodles.  My friend's spicy chicken ramen was the right amount of spicy for her, she liked it a lot. It was only her second time having ramen and this was definitely a good example of what a bowl of ramen should be.   Our server was friendly and the ramen was great. I will definitely be back soon to try out more things on the menu!"}
{"text":"For a former fast-food restaurant, this place has completely transformed to be a new player in the Vegas ramen wars. Exterior is all black, interior is swanky and looks like a lounge. Very welcoming, very clean. Menu is fairly extensive with a few different types of ramens, a handful of sides, add-ons, tapas options, and a few desserts.  JINYA BUN is $3 (~$4 regular) on HH menu- chashu on a bao, simple, classic, flavorful, and delicious. The tempura BRUSSELS SPROUTS were crispy and fresh with a touch of truffle oil that didn't overwhelm but added an extra savory note. CRISPY RICE WITH SPICY TUNA is a favorite dish of mine: I'm not a jalapeno fan but the thin slices are the perfect complement to the tuna and rice, which is perfectly crisp and never burned. CRISPY CHICKEN is super-moist and flavorful, plated with a small salad with their fabulous dressing and a delightful dipping sauce.  RAMENS: TONKOTSU ASSARI- pork broth, chashu, karagge, green onion, seasoned egg, spicy bean sprouts, and thick noodles: delish! Broth had good depth of flavor without feeling too fatty (server described it as one of their lighter options), noodles were chewy and the egg was just slightly overcooked. [2nd visit] TOKOTSU BLACK- pork broth, pork chashu, kikurage, green onion, nori, egg, garlic chips, garlic oil, fried onion, and THIN noodles: full bodied broth, but highly preferred the thicker noodles, the thin ones are too similar to spaghetti IMO. [Millionth Visit] SPICY CHICKEN TONKOTSU: amazing noodles with a spicy broth and ground chicken. No egg. Reminiscent of a lighter version of Sora's spicy ramen bowl but without the heavy grease of Fukumimu's tan tan men.  Very pleased with food and service- so much so that I went two days in  row.  Affordable pricing (see receipts in pics). Management visible throughout my visits, interacting with visitors. If this is any indication of an average visit here, they'll have a huge following with a waitlist very soon."}
{"text":"pork chashu bowl and salad combo   Very savoury and saucy. Perfect mix of egg, pork , veggies and rice. Pretty good value for $6.95 as an add on with your ramen. I would suggest sharing it because once your get your ramen, it will be a struggle to finish it ( maybe it's just me lol ) unless you are super hungry!  tonkotsu black It comes with thin noodles and if you like that seafood taste, then this is the ramen for you. This was pretty tasty too and the pork is tender AF"}
{"text":"Always here after a late night drunk sesh since it's open late.. I really enjoy their tonkatsu spicy ramen with a combo of their salad and rice bowl (about $15 for all of it so not bad at all!). Although their spicy level is not as spicy as I want because apparently my taste buds has no feelings, this has to be my favorite spot for tonkatsu! Never fails to make my tummy happy. :)  Service here is always amazing. Never that long for them to refill waters and always someone to help when needed..  Ambiance is very fitting for the mood. Just a chill little spot with an awesome women's restroom! I mean obviously it doesn't take a lot to make me happy haha."}
{"text":"Cute little restaurant. Love the atmosphere and setup of the place. We started with the shrimp balls and they were very good. I have the spicy chicken ramen and made it a combo with the salad and pork cha shu bowl. The rice bowl was delicious I love how they marinated the meat. I was pretty difficult since it was my first time here I was asking a lot of questions and the waitress was really patient with me so I appreciated it. It was worth the trip off of the strip."}
{"text":"I heard about this ramen place from a blogto article and from a friend. I love eating ramen so I had to try out this place.   The employees were friendly and explained the menu since it was my first time here. I decided to order their #2 popular item on the menu named \"cha cha cha - for garlic lovers.\" Service was great and while I was waiting, there was another table that did not receive their food and the server admitted that it was completely her fault.  Not too long after, my order arrives. At first glance, the presentation of the ramen was great. I always try the broth first before I try anything else and it was rich and flavourful which was quite a surprise. I thought the broth would be really garlicky and I would get garlic breath but it was not. The noodles were a bit different than other ramen places as they seem much more thicker and hold more of the broth's flavour. The chashu pieces were not rough and were soft and tender. Finally, the egg was perfect as it matches and exceeds other ramen places as it was a bit runny. More importantly, after I finished my ramen, I was not drinking water constantly meaning that their broth was not salty.  Even though the ramen was amazing, I found this place a bit pricey. A bowl of ramen cost me around $19 with tax and tip for lunch. They have combinations where you can add gyoza and rice bowls for around $4.75 which pushes the bill over $20 easily.  Overall, I will be back someday and I would recommend this place my friends who enjoy ramen."}
{"text":"If you're a big fan of brussel sprouts like I am, then you will really like the sprouting up ramen.  Why hasn't anyone thought of this before?  Brussel sprouts taste amazing in this creamy pork broth with the pork chashu, egg, green onion, Kikurage, chili oil and thick noodles.  I love how you can choose from a whole list of different toppings to add to your ramen... the most choices I have ever seen on a ramen menu including broccoli, butter, seasoned egg, wontons, tofu, pork & chicken soboro (spicy minced meat), to name a few of my favourites.  They even have ramen sauces on the table to customize your soup even more... The possibilities are endless.  The portion size is bigger than most.  I was not able to finish my bowl.  Probably why it costs a bit more than other places as well.  I need to slow clap the jinya bun.  Finally a bun where its mostly pork belly goodness and not all bao.  I would definitely order this again. The caramelized cauliflower was tasty and looks better than it does in the menu photo.  With all the food options, you will need a drink.  I suggest the house cold sake which is served in a shot glass where the over-pour spills into a wooden box that you can pour back into the glass or drink from the box.  A fun and different way to drink sake.  Plenty of seats, no patio, friendly staff, dim lighting.    It is now on my top 5 ramen joints in the city and I will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Okay, so I really wanted to give a 4-star rating because the service could have been better, but the food is making me give them 5 stars.  I got the garlic ramen (it has a name but I can't remember- cha cha?). They give an immense amount of bean sprouts, but I easily took a little out before mixing everything together. I absolutely love soft-boiled egg in my ramen, so I got extra :) the yolk was perfect. I guess this certain soup usually comes with thick noodles but they were out, so it came with thin. Very delicious and cooked perfectly! We got some gyoza and it had good flavor, they were a little smaller than I'm used to, but flavor was there so it's all good.  THE JINYA BUN. LITERALLY THE BEST THING EVER. My parents took me to this ramen bar as I was visiting and we all took a bite of our buns at the same time, let me tell you about the silence that overtook our table. THE JINYA BUN IS AMAZING, and if you haven't been blessed with being able to try it here, I'm sorry. But go do yourself a favor and go there and order some RIGHT NOW."}
{"text":"Quick Summary: Excellent selection of ramen not too far from the strip. Just like with anything off strip travels though, make sure you request a cab well before you need it."}
{"text":"After trying the vegetarian ramen a while ago, I decided to try the Creamy Vegan Ramen, and it was AMAZING. The broth is quite flavourful, and the thick noodles are perfectly cooked. One critique is that the toppings are limited, there's just some tofu and onions here and there, an addition of more vegetables or an egg would help enhance flavour.   My friends and I also tried the green tea mochi and flan during \"Happy Hour,\" it was $1-2 off regular price. Mochi was good, however it seemed like generic store-bought, nothing special. The flan was great initially, but nearing the end was tasteless.  The service is fantastic, and VERY fast. Overall, high quality food and a great place to enjoy ramen!"}
{"text":"Not my favorite ramen bar but definitely unique and worth going to. Main selling point is their hours; they're open super late so that's great. The ramen is tasty and they have a great selection of appetizers, sides, and desserts.  The bad part is always the wait. There's almost always a line, especially at night. The service is a tad slow due since it's always busy. But the service you do get is decent.   The prices($11-$15)are also a tad higher than Monta ($7-$8)/Fukumimi($9-$10). But you are paying for quality ramen so I think it is worth it."}
{"text":"Loved it!  Fast and attentive servers, clean enviroment, awesome, delicious and cheap ramen, 10/10 will come back soon!."}
{"text":"A group of us came here Saturday evening.  Even with a group it was only about a 25 minute wait.  I have never had ramen like this before, so I was excited!  We were not disappointed in our dishes.  The chicken wonton ramen is to die for!  Cannot wait to come back when we are in Vegas again!!!"}
{"text":"I'm one of those people that enjoys ramen on cooler days. This place is very popular so expect a wait,  even for lunch!   There are lots of ramen places in town and this is one of my favorite. I love that it's cozy and minimal and when that hot bowl of ramen hits your table it always makes me smile.  Favorites are the house chicken & spicy chicken ramens and the Tonkotsu black ramen. I always add butter and garlic and occasionally corn or mushrooms. It's the absolute perfect food for rainy & gloomy days! Packed with flavor and so filling!   They also offer a great happy hour for small bites (ramen not included) daily from 3-5 and 10-midnight. Favorites are the caramelized cauliflower, crispy chicken and salmon poke tacos!"}
{"text":"Wow. This is the best ramen I've had in Calgary.  I came here with my sister, Aunt and daughter (they're family friendly).  This was the first time my aunt tried ramen, I'm very happy my sister chose this spot to represent the ramen world. I think we were all blown away by the food.  I got the garlic lovers ramen. Oh. my. goodness. That was garlic heaven right there in that bowl. I would have to say that my ramen won, but my sister and aunt were just as adamant about their meal.  I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Was pretty excited to try this place out primarily because they have a vegan option! But I was definitely not impressed.   Now I understand that good things take time and my group didn't mind waiting. However, when we finally got to a position in line where we had a view of the restaurant, there were about a dozen seats available! Mind you we had been waiting for an hour so seeing open seats was pretty annoying. It was puzzling why an establishment wouldn't at least let their patrons have a seat and get something to drink... This especially confuses me when more and more people rolled in after us, were seated immediately and the place ensued to fill up.. oh well.  When the hostess came up and called our party's name we all smiled and nodded. The hostess looked super confused, rolled her eyes and nodded a slow demeaning \"YEESS?\".  Um, yeah? Dang I'm sorry we didn't verbalize it but you don't have to be rude.   On the plus side, our server was good and deserves a little gold star! Very attentive, knowledgeable and sweet.   The food I had was no good. My vegan ramen broth was cold and flavorless and the noodles were thick and super chewy. Not a fan. It also gave me a pretty painful stomach ache for the drive home.   My friend got this chicken appetizer that was undercooked. When he brought this issue to a waiters attention they were like \"oh they're supposed to be like that because if they cooked longer the outside would burn.\" ...Haha gross.   When we got the checks we gave 2 cards and they split it for us. The same hostess with the eye rolls came back and held the 2 CLOSED bill books up without saying a word. Like how are we supposed to know which one is which? Before we could even say anything she rolls her eyes, tosses them to the table, and mouths a long \"oookaaay\".  Why so much attitude?! And why so many eye rolls? What happened to customer service?   Sorry Jinya but I won't be a returning customer."}
{"text":"A ramen restaurant opened up on Church where Daybreak used to operate. Ok I know, like we need another but anyways I gave it a try. The decor looks trendy & pretentious like La Carnita and the music is mind numbingly loud. I was expecting a disco ball to drop from the ceiling at any moment. It's pricey and what does it say about your authenticity if you serve brussel sprouts with ramen. So I ordered the Tonkotsu Black with fresh garlic on the side.  It was average at best, the pork and toppings standard and the broth forgetful. For $15 I was expecting orgasmic blow my mind away taste. It never happened...off to the bathhouse it is then!"}
{"text":"I have to share my last experience at Jinya, I ordered the chicken ramen, it came with 2 tiny pieces of the driest chicken you couldn't even swallow. I asked my server if I could have new chicken, the manager Crystal then came over and said I had to eat what they gave me because it's what I ordered. I was not allowed to replace my chicken with pork or order another bowl. She told me if I didn't like the food I didn't have to eat it and took my bowl away. She further went to make a point to show me the chicken was edible by using her hands and eating a piece of chicken in front of me at my table. She continued to be extremely rude and yell at me in front of everyone it was mortifying. She continued this horrible behaviour as I was exiting the restaurant and continued to yell at me as I was leaving out the door. I will never go back here and I will do everything I can to tell as many people I can about the terrible service and food at jinya."}
{"text":"This place is the bomb. Fast, delicious, not expensive. I'll be back again and again."}
{"text":"Best Ramen in Toronto! I had an incredible experience. The broth is so delicious and the menu has lots of great options. Server was so nice and food tasted very fresh. Love the ambience of the restaurant too. Will definitely be coming back here on my next visit to Toronto."}
{"text":"this is very good ramen.. came here with 3 of my ramen \"connoisseurs\" there were enough menu options and add-ons to satisfy even them..   their menu has salad, small plates, rice bowls and curry. they got a lot going on.. but the Tonkotsu ramen was pha-nom-in-all   and many toppings at a decent price for your ramen..  location is super convenient too at flamingo and decatur"}
{"text":"So far my favourite ramen place in Calgary. Tried, the tuna \"tacos\", creamy tempura shrimp and most importantly the sticky pork buns. After that had a large bowl of spicy pork with thick noodles.  Amazingly delicious, every single bite. The only bad thing is that the place is kinda small and tables are really close to each other.  Still a great place to try and keep coming back."}
{"text":"This place truly is a worthy \"rival\" to the famous Monta Ramen.   The only thing that makes this place slightly worse is their bowl is more expensive by a dollar or so. However, this place definitely has the flavor to match that of Monta. I ordered their spicy tonkotsu ramen with their flavored egg (which is a soft boiled egg) and I was very satisfied with what I got. Their broth is very rich and flavorful I didn't even need to season it at all. The only thing I found a bit weird was that the tonkotsu ramen was served with thick noodles rather than the traditional thin noodles (which they serve anyways.) I'll probably order the same thing with thin noodles next time.   Service was also great here, I'd say better than Monta. I came here with my large family which included a small child. My niece had the kid's meal which was a fried rice with fried chicken and also had a pudding dessert with a strawberry puree. The waitress noticed that my niece really enjoyed the strawberry and offered to give her some more. Our table was checked on frequently enough to feel hospitable but not too much that it was bothersome.  In my opinion, Jinya is a nicer restaurant where I would go on a date, where Monta is more touristy and casual. So depending on what you're in the mood for pick accordingly."}
{"text":"Went for a Sunday lunch with family. The place was crowded. We waited for about 20 minutes but it was worth the wait. We order ramen, brussel sprouts, and takoyaki. A lot of chicken ramen dishes which I was surpised about. I ordered the Jinyu black ramen. Good flavor soup, firm noodles, and plenty of toppings. The sprouts were good but I was really impressed with the takoyaki. Very nice flavor, good balance of filling and batter. It was placed on top of an egg salad mixture which made the dish. The service was attentive especially considering how busy it was. The facilities were clean. Probably not the place to bring a large group but great spot to try."}
{"text":"This place is seriously bombbbb !!! Atmosphere is modern & hip. Really good happy hour & if I'm not mistaken it's twice in a day ! How rad. It's so hard not to get the crispy shrimp balls before a big bowl of delish ramen but I do anyways. Channeling my inner fatness every time I go here. I have eaten the Cha Cha Cha which they say is for garlic lovers. It's literally TOO MUCH GARLIC & I'm an insane garlic addict lol. I have figured out that ordering Tonkotsu Spicy (if you don't like spice, maybe just the regular Tonkatsu cause it does have a nice kick to it) & adding the fresh garlic provided to you is wayyyyy better ! You can add as much garlic as you want to ensure you're main course isn't literally garlic for dinner !! Lastly, the service is always super efficient & awesome & check out their toilet, you won't be disappointed ! Hahaha Enjoy !"}
{"text":"I can see why this place is popular.  The ramen is good,  and the ambiance is pretty hip and young,  and you don't have to go deep into Chinatown to have your noodle fix.  It definitely seems like a \"cool\" place for the under 30 to eat Vegas' latest food craze.    But honestly,  it wasn't quite worth the hype it got.  There was a 10 minute wait when we got there at 9pm on a Sunday,  and the wait staff seemed run down and overwhelmed by so many people... but I hear they're always busy, so you'd think they'd have it down by now.  They were out of EVERY sake.  Not just one sake... every sake.  The ramen was pretty good.  A lot of choices,  and the tonkotsu black was better than the chef special chicken I had.  I don't think the noodles are home made,  but they still taste good.  The chef chicken special was hard to eat.  Chicken pieces so big I really wanted a knife and fork to cut them up.  Try getting a bite out of a semi tough piece of chicken while holding it with chopsticks and trying to remain a lady... impossible! Even the bamboo shoots were huge.  I had to bite it down 5 times!   All in all I'd be back if I lived on the west side."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I, after a ridiculous trip to the Bay, on a cool Tuesday night, were in much need of a bit of nawsh! We didn't feel like cooking!  We decided to try Jinya, for the first time. It was packed! Every seat was full. Great sign!  It wasn't a noisy as some of the other Ramen places in town, and had a killer sound system, that set the mood quite nicely, with the dimmed lighting.  The food.. bang on!  The pork broth that was in the ramen was to die for! Piping hot. We split a bowl of ramen, had the tempura brussel sprouts, the pork gyoza, and the octopus balls.  We thoroughly enjoyed everything, especially their ice cream desert that put the button on the meal!  Awesome.  5 stars.  We can't wait to go again. We will be recommending this to our friends! Cheers!"}
{"text":"Jinya has always been my bf and I's late night go to for ramen. I always order the same thing, tonkotsu black with thick noodles. We love the takoyaki and their Chashu bowls! Also their baby leaf salad with their garlic ginger dressing is so bomb. Jinya never fails. It's probably one of my favorite ramen places in comparison to Monta and Ramen Sora."}
{"text":"Waiting time was quiet long.. Atmosphere was nice and service was good. A little bit noisy, music was quiet loud, but okay. They do veggie broth which I was looking for. As a starter I had some cold tofu with seaweed on top, don't remember the name. But it was really good. The dressing is a little sour, add some gyoza (I guess it was soy sauce) and you're good to go! I did the veggie ramen soup with dried seaweed topping. Was yummy, especially the mushrooms and asparagus! I don't like when you put broccoli in an Asian soup (like pho/ ramen soups) because it ruins the taste of it. Will tell them to leave them out next time. And I want to try corn topping too. All in all I'm happy with my dinner."}
{"text":"My taste buds were very surprised by the balanced flavors of the Ramen! I expected it to be very salty because it was the saltiest ramen but it was just PERFECT. The spicy miso ramen is a little too sweet for my taste but most people would probably like it. It has a lot of flavor and definitely not salty like a lot of other ramen places. Although it's not as salty as other places, it packs more flavor. The pork gyoza was cooked to perfection. The ramen #1 black was very rich, but it balanced out the saltiness. There was black garlic oil that made the ramen soup rich but it wasn't overpowering it at all. It complimented the thin noodles. Definitely the ramen I will remember the most. The takoyaki was pretty average because everything else was phenomenal. The Chashu bowl was average because there was only a little amount of Chashu and it was cut into pieces. It would have tasted better is it was whole in my opinion."}
{"text":"It's my 2nd time here and man this place is pack to the rim.. There is a waiting list and waited less then 10 mins for a single person.  I order the Sukiyaki Q Ramen add bean sprouts and did the combo plate with Pork Gyoza and salad plus an ice tea, too.  This bowl is quite filling to your stomach and no room for dessert!"}
{"text":"OK ramen in Las Vegas.  Worth trying but not good enough to return. Ramen is available with thin or thick noodles, based on the broth.  The broth was simple & clean.  The noodles lacked flavor or any character on their own.  Gyoza was good, tempura brussel sprouts were good.  Those I'd recommend.  The ramen is what I came for and I was not impressed."}
{"text":"This is by far the worse eating experience I've had in a very long time. My daughter and her boyfriend suggested this place to order take out from instead of ordering pizza. The worst mistake for the start of the year. I treated them and paid for it. Over $ 65.00 dollars for some stale noodles in an over-salted, disgusting broth that reeked. The tiny sliver of pork they added to the portion was ridiculous. The mushroom non existing. I've never felt so cheated out of my money. $ 14.50 for a bowl of this. Any instant Ramen is superior. So sad that places like these can flourish in Calgary and swindle money from people. Just recently I visited Hong Kong and stayed in the Whampoa Station Japanese neighborhood. The Ramen eateries there are delicious, inexpensive and offering high quality food -not this sodium toxic waste. Oh well...lesson learned. I wish I could have my hard earned money back. Stay away from this place is all I can say."}
{"text":"I was terribly upset by the lack of strategy by the hostess. We were a party of 7 and, as a person who works in the food industry myself, I understand how stressful and messy dinner rush can be so we were all ready to wait. But that's no excuse for the atrocious treatment of my part. Party after party was let in before us. Smaller parties of 1 to 3 were passable but parties of 5? Of 6? If the hostess had waited a few more minutes before letting those parties pass, there would have been enough room for us. But it seemed that the greater concern was the number of people they got in as opposed to who got in first. Considering we had already waited an hour at this point and the great things we've heard we were willing to wait. But then the hostess proceeds to /dismiss/ us when we attempt to negotiate a seating arrangement in which we would split.  Although the food was honestly fantastic (hence the two stars), and the servers were incredibly nice, I'm sorry Jinya, I won't be a returning guest. Get a better hostess/plan for seating."}
{"text":"My go to ramen place. The broth here is amazing and the thick noodles are cooked just right. I always get the tonkotsu black with thick noodles because I'm not a big fan of the thin noodles. The salad here is fantastic too, I think it's the dressing but I always have to get it whenever I dine here. Atmosphere is nice, dim lighting and more seats than other ramen places. The customer service is alright, and for some reason it's always freezing cold in here with the music pumping so loud you have to yell in order to talk to your friends.   Oh yeah, THEY HAVE AMAZING TOILETS!!! Butt warmers ftw!"}
{"text":"Excellent ramen. Anybody would love it all the food i have tried is delicious. Took my kids and they even enjoyed it. My mom lived it as well. I will be coming here many more times and highly recommend it to anyone for the need of authentic noodles and flawless flavor."}
{"text":"I love this place!! The best takoyaki and a must try Tonkatsu Black if you're a garlic lover like me. Their panna cotta for dessert is great too! Very good price as well. I eat here like once a week."}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant three times now and I'm writing my review following my third visit.  Therefore, after three visits I can see that this restaurant is excellent   For sure you have to get there early to beat the crowd and get in line before it opens at 11:30 if you want to eat lunch here there is an absolute need for you to get there ahead of the crowd   Importantly if you try to get here around 12 you will be waiting out the door with no ability to get a seat The place has some tables around the edge of the dining room and a large communal table in the center   The food is very good and each time I've been here the food is consistent and prepared with fresh ingredients   I was introduced by a friend and since then I've brought my wife and then the third time I came by myself do not miss this great lunch spot but be sure to come early and wait in line posted some pictures of the line out the door and that is something I've seen on each visit"}
{"text":"After seeing and eating a couple days of fancy casino food, we were craving some comfort food.  Ramen fit the occasion perfectly.  We accidentally stumbled upon this place, in fact almost drove by because it was dark and looked closed.  It was 1:30am so we didn't really think the place was actually open.   But then again this was Las Vegas, why wouldn't it be?  First impression, dark like a bar, in fact if I didn't see the ramen on the other tables, I would have easily thought this place was a bar.  The music was similar to what you'd find in a bar scene.  Loud,  Really loud and annoying.  One of the owners just happen to be there, young guy, who just happened to originally be from Hawaii.  I thought I'd compliment him on the ramen flavor and at the same time ask him to turn down the music so we could hear each talk and have a conversation.  It was also really cold in the restaurant, perhaps time of the morning and lack of bodies in the place had something to do with that.  After our eyes got adjusted to the dark atmosphere and loud music, we focused in on the ramen.  Thin noodles, rich tonkatsu broth (that you know took days pto produce), the wonderful garlic flavors and the perfectly cooked egg.  The atmosphere, not too desirable, but the food was so amazingly delicious! It was as good, if not better than, authentic ramen from Japan.  The menu is perfect for picky eaters, who can order their noodles thick or thin, and customize their dish with a number of add-ons.   The most incredible thing was the spicy sauce, photo enclosed of the chefs creation.  Stopped in the restroom prior to leaving, very clean, toilets were the fancy Japanese high end ones that you find in 5 star, Tokyo hotels.  To me, restrooms are a good measure on how to gauge how much a restaurant cares.    If your ever in Las Vegas and are looking for a very good bowl of ramen, visit and try it, I guarantee you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I'm not much of a ramen person (I prefer pho over ramen since it's lighter) but JINYA really exceeded my expectations. My friend introduced me to this place a few weeks ago and I loved it ! I had their tonkatsu white ramen and it was bomb. The broth , egg , mushrooms , chashu (pork belly) , and everything was all really really good. I've been to Monta , Ramen Sora , and Fukumimi and I feel JINYA is the best out of all of them. Much better flavor and selections. My tonkatsu white bowl included an egg unlike at Fukumimi where they only give you half an egg & at Monta it's not even included , you have to pay extra for one. I ordered their spicy chicken ramen to-go for my dad and he's not a ramen person either (he doesn't even Japanese food) but he loved it too. So that says a lot about the food.  I really enjoyed the vibes here - dimly lit ambiance and good , loud music. Service was spot on. Everything here was all just very good. You will never want to cook a packet of instant noodles ever again LOL. I will definitely be coming back , although I only crave ramen like twice or three times a year."}
{"text":"I'm not vegan but the vegan creamy ramen is by far my favourite, followed by tonkotsu black and spicy chicken ramen. The panacotta is amazing. Service is always friendly and there's never a lineup all 4 times I've been here."}
{"text":"Not enough soup for the tonkotsu and yes tonkotsu is all about the soup.  What is the point for marketing tonkotsu when stingy on soup.  Not recommended!!"}
{"text":"This is the only ramen place I go to now. The broth is really flavorful and it doesn't make me feel really bloated and heavy later. The interior sort of reminds me of Ichiza. I like how you have a choice between thick or thin noodles, types of broth. I really feel like I'm eating noodles in Japan when I'm here."}
{"text":"Always a great place for Ramen. Their garlic bowl is amazing. Unfortunately their sides are all lacking."}
{"text":"Chef is a jerk. Bad manners. Insists his noodles were perfect when they were terribly underdone. Too bad."}
{"text":"After a crazy night in Vegas, I really needed a bowl of ramen. My friends spoke highly of Jinya, so that's where I decided to go. I waited about 20-30 minutes for a table for 2 on Sunday at around 1pm.   I went with my friends recommendation and ordered the Sprouting Up Ramen. However, I made the mistake of replacing the pork chashu with pork soboro. The pork soboro is really well seasoned and would taste great with rice because it's on the salty end. However, adding the soboro to an already salty ramen made my broth extremely salty. The brussel sprouts were unique and cooked well, but I think I'm definitely more of a tradition ramen fan.   We also ordered the takoyaki, which was well worth the $6. The appetizer comes with 6 octopus balls on a bed of crushed hard boiled eggs covered with japanese mayo, sauce, green onions, and bonito flakes. The takoyaki was delicious and I would come back to Jinya just to eat them again."}
{"text":"The ramen is good but nothing special. In fact, it's a bit pricier than other places. However, their small plates and rice bowls are what really shines! Their regular rice bowls are about $10-13 after tax and tip and it fills me up more than the ramen does. I almost always get the bowl (plus an appetizer if I'm really hungry) when coming here instead of the ramen. Recommend you try the sukiyaki bowl!"}
{"text":"I had the spicy tonkotsu Ramen with extra chashu and added an egg. While I liked it enough and it's on my list of top favorites it's not as authentic as Monta. I love that they have a variety of different bowls and of course you can make your own. The one downside, and why I remove a star, was the price. They are several more dollars than any other Ramen joint I've been to In Town. I'll be back to only when I can afford it"}
{"text":"Awesome food with an awesome happy hour. The kids menu was nice and allowed for the kids to try a little of everything!  The ChaCha soup was great with extra Charsu . Definitely a great place to eat!"}
{"text":"When coming here, my family and I had the intent that it would be really good, and we weren't disappointed. We saw on other reviews that it was rumored to be better then Monta and/or sora, so expectations were already high.    To be honest, I don't think it was better than Monta, but it was better than sora. JINYA and Monta are both on equal terms but jinya's other menu items are what out them on top.    We ended up getting Tonkatsu assari mild, Tonkatsu black, JINYA chicken ramen with extra butter, takoyaki, pork gyoza, and JINYA buns. All were so delicious (especially the JINYA buns... So good)"}
{"text":"So I've eaten here on a number of occasions, and I can't say I hate nor can I say I love it.. but there are a number of reasons why this Ramen spot is getting a solid 3 stars from me.. food is good but not mind blowing, and it's kinda over priced in my honest opinion, servers here are hit or miss like they're either really nice and on top of it, or really spaced out and not all too together and there.   I come here mostly when friends want to eat here as a group or whatnot, and my boyfriend and I came here together once so he could try it out (he wasn't so much a fan) I think the inconsistency in their service is one of the main dampers to this place.. one time the server was coming around to a group of mine collecting plates and bowls that were finished and my friend next to me wasn't quite down with her ramen and instead of asking and waiting for a response, she asked, \"are you finished?\" while she basically grabbed the bowl but she grabbed it in a way that she placed her thumb in the inside rim of my friend's ramen bowl.. umm unsanitary and gross dude seriously.. ask and then wait before you go sticking your fingers in other people's ramen bowls.. geez lol   The ramen is solid good, but I always tend to get the chicken ramen and never really venture off to anything different unless its the appetizers options... but if i'm coming here for ramen, I always get the same ramen lol  I wanna definitely try their drive thru.. which to me is kinda mind blowing awesome that they even have a drive thru but I wonder how quick and efficient that is.. ramen in drive thru   but my boyfriend felt his broth was a bit too salty, but again a little over priced for less traditional ramen spot, wait on the weekends or rainy days are especially long and there's no real waiting area.   I do have to say the female's restroom is kick ass toilet seat! I'm assuming its from Japan, but it's definitely one of those high tech toilet/bidet combinations. but the seat is heated and it sanitizes the seat with a spray when the automatic sensor is activated to lift the seat cover. most high tech throne I've ever sat on. lol   They do have a small bar area to sit on.. only seats up to 4 guest at the bar. They have a large community table that seats about 25 people, then lining the establishments are booth sittings that fit either 2 - 6 guest depending on the booth.   They offer a lot of side add on items but each item add on is usually additional $1.00 if your ramen is $10.95 then you add poached egg, extra spinach, corn, etc etc you just added additional $3 making your Ramen $14.. idk to me it just comes out a little bit pricier than other spots I've been to.. the serving size is average; nothing large like a large bowl of pho, but its not small either. Tends to be usually be just right, but I'm a huge soup over noodles fan.. so I tend to always finish my soup first and still looking for more when I'm finishing the noodles.   Again the ambiance of the place if definitely more modern than traditional, but their menu is pretty straight to the point with not too much fusion options which makes choosing pretty simple. I do like that they have a half off certain appetizers Happy Hour 10p-12am, but I just don't like how if you order appetizers, your tapas tend to come out after the Ramen, especially if you order the Dynamite tapas. That one is actually really good and comes with 4 small toasted baguette slices to place the dynamite mixture on and its very tasty and not too creamy, like its not swimming in cream cheese which I like. but i prefer my appetizer as an appetizer before the main meal.. just saying.   Again, I have mixed feeling about this place like some days I'm into it and most I'm like ehh.. but really can't go wrong with Ramen in cold or rainy weather and this is relatively close to my house so nothing mind blowing here but solid good ramen, but not my top spot."}
{"text":"First time going out for ramen, chosen for the veggie options. I have to say I'm pretty impressed, the spicy vegan was delicious. My date and I both loved it, so much I brought 6 more people another time, and they all loved it too. Will be back! Thanks for the great food."}
{"text":"Here's takoyaki is the best takoyaki in toronto area! The egg salad under takoyaki completes the amazing taste.. I can eat it everyday.. I got spicy tonkotsu ramen! The broth was so rich and chashu was smooth. But the thing is even though I ordered it spicy, it wasn't really spicy. My boyfriend ordered sprouting up ramen. It was really good too! The first taste of brussels sprouts was fantastic but the end was a bit bitter. Service was pretty nice too! Would definitely return!"}
{"text":"My go-to Ramen spot!  I'm really not even that into Ramen but this place changed my mind. They have tons of ramen choices & appetizers on their menu. Also a great happy hour menu!   Every time I come in there is no wait but still a good amount of people coming in & out to eat. The service is fast & the restaurant is clean. Everyone who works here is friendly & actually seems to enjoy their jobs.   I really like how they had a little bowl & plate with toddler sized utensils for my son! Makes eating a lot easier for all of us lol."}
{"text":"Loved this place! Love the atmosphere. Staff very friendly and nice.   Had the tonkontsu ramen with mushrooms and bok choy. Very flavorful. Mushrooms seemed like there were sautéed almost for a steak. Would go again minus mushrooms. Maybe replace with marinated shiitake! Yum!   Will go again though."}
{"text":"This awesome ramen shop is only a few minutes drive from the strip. They are just off of Flamingo and Decatur. During my visit, I arrived for an early dinner so it wasn't crowded.  From their parking lot, I noticed a drive thru menu board but, it wasn't opened as a car was parked, blocking the entrance to the drive thru. Maybe it opens up later in the evening. I certainly hope so as this would be my favorite ramen place to go in Sin City! Imagine driving by and picking up some late night ramen before heading back to your hotel or home. What a concept! I'll have to make a return trip and confirm if see this is true.  Now for their ramen. Soup flavor excellent, ramen noodles al denté. Truly a favorite go to ramen spot while in Sin City. Take it from your ramen connoisseur, Jinya is worth a short drive from the strip. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Wow where do i begin. I was suprised to find this place on this side of town. Everything around this area has a local feel to it but this place is a well run business chain. They have good servers. Everyone seems happy to work here. The price is perfect for what you get. They have a small menu that I wish was bigger because everything they offer taste good, but I understand they kept it small to help the food get out faster. They seem to make up for it by letting you customize everything (example size of noodles). I recommend the house Ramon and Japanese style fried chicken with an extra side of lemon. Put the lemon on the chicken and it taste authentic, like in japan.  Service-5 price-5 business flow-5  menu-4 food quality-5"}
{"text":"When we come to Vegas we like to try new places out. I was driving down flamingo and I kept seeing this place so I decided to give it a try. I have never been to a \"real\" ramen restaurant before so I didn't know what to expect. The staff were very friendly and explained the menu and options.   We ordered the gyoza for an appetizer. They had good flavor and taste but all 6 pieces were stuck together. When you tried to separate them with chopsticks they would sometimes split open and spill the contents on the plate. Not a big deal but I wish they would desperate them more before cooking them.   I had the chicken ramen and my girlfriend had the spicy chicken ramen. Only additional item I added to my bowl was extra noodles. She didn't add anything extra. The bowls the ramen come in are huge lots of broth and good proportions. Add in extra noodles and you have yourself a really big meal!  The whole thing was excellent. My only disappointment in the ramen bowl was the lack of chicken. But overall I really enjoyed my meal and I wouldn't have a problem coming again and again to eat here."}
{"text":"Ok the interior is decorated to perfection ! It's like not too dark but it's not very bright . There are tables and then there's one giant table in the middle . There are also chandeliers that hang above the big table so it makes it look cooler . They have quite a variety of ramen soups to choose from there are also vegetable ramen If you're going for the healthy soup . The crispy chicken btw is VERY good and it's Japanese styled chicken . Then there's the ramen soups , the bowls have fair portions , but the noodles were a little hard and I got the thick noodles that's why I'd give it a 4 stars instead of 5 (I hope these noodles aren't the same type they put in processed cup noodles omg ) but other than that everything is was good , the customer service was excellent ! The girls were very nice , oh and last to add the bathroom was SO COOL . Like I opened the door and the toilet seat opened on its own omg and there were settings to it !! Like the toilet seat was warmed to my liking and the toilet even flushed when I said flush !! Like what the hell how cool is that . That toilet just won me over lmao and then the Michu dessert was actually pretty good it didn't taste like perfume unlike kaya sushi omg but yeah this place deserves a four star"}

{"text":"Jinya was first introduced to me in LA when my friends and I were on the hunt for ramen after a long day at Universal Studios. Huge wait out there but we quickly realized how worth it was. For me, vegetarian ramen speaks for itself. I thought this was going to be a one time ordeal falling in love while on vacation and having to wait years before eating it again..... then Jinya Vegas was before my eyes shortly after I moved here. Life made!  I had the spicy creamy vegan ramen then and I came to the Vegas location with high hopes for it to knock my socks off again. It did just that! I added a soft boiled egg and mushrooms to my ramen and we shared edamame on the side. We all got ramune which has become my guilty pleasure.   Our server was super helpful in explaining the menu to my girlfriends who were there for the first time. She noted which of the condiments were vegetarian since a friend and I are vegetarian. I suck at eating ramen in the sense that I eat all the broth before i get to my noodles so she even offered me extra broth to go and I was able to make two servings of my one bowl of ramen.   Ambiance is hipster-esque. We were seated at the high top. Not my preference but was ready to eat! It's not insanely large which explains the wait. Parking is a bit of a struggle but there's a large strip mall behind the establishment.   The wait is the only inconvenience, but if that tells you anything... it's that good! No reservations, no calls. Will absolutely be frequenting it time and time again."}
{"text":"This place is ok, but wouldn't be my first choice for ramen downtown - prefer Sansotei, Santouka, & Raijin.  Found the Tonkotsu White too salty & Cha Cha noodle too overpowering. The tempura brussel sprouts were interesting & karaage good. Their iced green tea is uniquely delicious as it's all matcha.  Lastly, their price seems a bit higher than Sansotei (and maybe Santouka as well)"}
{"text":"As a vegan it can be pretty difficult to find a ramen place you can eat at let alone one that offers a bowl as delicious as JINYA. If you are craving some vegan ramen I suggest going here and getting the Spicy Creamy Vegan Ramen. It is amazing! I suggest pairing it with the Brussels Sprouts Tempura or the Caramelized Cauliflower. I'm not even lying when I say this is my favourite Ramen Bar in the city so far."}
{"text":"Ramen Sora's pork kicks ass over this place. However, Ramen Sora only has pork. Jinya has several chicken & vegetarian options, which works well for my non-pig-eater friends. Jinya suffices, but for more authentic, family recipe ramen with superior noodles & ingredients, Ramen Sora is the shiznit."}
{"text":"This is a very small ramen place but they serve fast and food is superb! They also offer an extra side of noodle if you need more to satisfy your hunger. The buns are a must too before you get your ramen noodles."}
{"text":"Pretty solid Ramen, sides dishes are typical, nothing special.  Overall worth a try, service is awkward, you'll see when you visit."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Great service and food. They have a vegetarian ramen and it was delicious. Alicia was our server and was friendly and explained the menu to us which was helpful. Definitely will be back soon!"}
{"text":"It's is the most delicious ramen noodle shop i have visited in Las Vegas. agreed that it's salty and greasy but no worries at all. it is not MSG but the pork soup indeed. my sis and i go to Japan almost every twice a year n found that JINYA made ramen very similar to those original in Japan, or even better"}
{"text":"A friend in Vegas suggested I go here when I asked her for a recommendation. It was a good idea. We took an uber from the Mandalay Bay and the drive was about 10 mins. Not too bad. Got seated with a group of 5 in just a few mins. The waiter was great and made a few suggestions. We ordered some pitchers of beer and then just chatted while we waited for the good stuff.  Service was on point, and the beer kept flowing. Had a few appetizers and then our ramen came. It was AWESOME. The best ramen I have ever had. I could have eaten 3 bowls of it and would have come back again and again, but it was my last night in Vegas. I need one of these closer to home!"}
{"text":"Overall - 3.0/5.0  This place has gotten quite a bit of mixed reviews so I gave it a try to throw in my two cents.  Ordered the Cha Cha Cha ramen and here are my thoughts:  - Portion (5/5): It was topped with a lot of sprouts but overall my bowl was filled all the way to the top and had quite a bit of noodles. I typically finish my ramen at Sansotei fairly quick but this one took me a while.   - Noodles (4/5): It was more al dente than most places, but I did like it thick and chewy.   - Soup (3.5/5): Although not as garlicky as I thought, it was quite well seasoned, thick and hearty. Some may find it a bit on the salty side.   - Meat (3/5): It came with 4 slices of pork cha siu which were quite thick in size. I prefer thinner slices as it is easier to eat along with the noodles but at least it was still relatively tender. It came out cold as if they were left out for a while. Also it did not have that grilled/charred flavour. Recommend dipping it into the soup and let it sit for a bit before eating.   - Egg (2.5/5): It was flavourful but a bit overcooked. Not a showstopper item but would definitely liked it if the yolk was more runny and cut into two halves for better presentation.  - Price (2.5/5): It was quite steep at $15.25 and definitely does not command that price unless they improve on their cha siu and egg."}
{"text":"Fantastic happy hour, excellent apps. Highly recommend the pork buns, the tacos with Kim Chee, and panna Cotta dessert. Excellent staff, fun late night crowd."}
{"text":"I've been to JINYA Ramen Bar at least 6 times in the past 5 weeks.   I was really disappointed the first time I came here. Well I got take out, and let me tell you, DO NOT GET TAKE OUT because the portions were so tiny I'm pretty sure it was a scam. So, when I went to the actual restaurant for the first time, I was surprised at how LARGE each portion was. I was also surprised how hip and trendy this place was. They have a bunch of happy hour specials, but I've only gotten their ramen. I can see young professionals coming here after a day of work, eating some ramen and drinking some good beer.    I can't remember what I ordered the first time, but since then, I've only been getting the Cha Cha Cha ramen with EXTRA fresh garlic on top.  The thick noodles taste SO GOOD, and I think this is one of the best ramen joints I've been to just because of the taste of their noodles. They must make them in-house because I've never tasted noods like this before.   BUT, yes there is a BUT, even though this is one of the best ramen joints I've been to, it is also one of the saltiest ramen joints. While you eat their noods, make sure to drink lots of water because 2 - 3 hours after dining, you will not stop drinking water. It feels SO bad. Nothing will be able to quench your thirst, but that is just the price you get for their noods.   I'm usually always complaining about never being full after eating from a restaurant, but this place always makes me full. My BF really likes ordering their extra noodles. If you have enough broth left, for a dollar and something, you can get a noodle refill.   TLDR; DO NOT GET TAKE OUT, but regardless, salty AF and delicious AF. If you are a garlic lover, then CHA CHA CHA ramen is for you."}
{"text":"First time eating ramen, and I have to say \"It was AMAZING\"! The service was great. I had the spicy chicken ramen added fresh garlic and mushroom excellent combo."}
{"text":"This has become my favourite ramen place! Service was great; the waitress and host were enthusiastic, cheerful and quick on their feet. Jinya definitely had a more western feel to it, which I thought was a bit weird at first, but got over it after tasting the food.  Their menu offers more than just your standard ramen bowls, such as garlic-themed ones and their brussel sprout bowl (which was amazing--broth was light yet flavourful, noodles were perfectly al dente). They offer a variety of thin/thick noodle bowls as well (thick noodles are a must try). The only thing you have to be wary about is that it's a tad pricy for ramen--averaging around $15 if you add just one topping. The portion size is more generous than usual, but I guess that's because you're also paying more. Overall a great, chic place to eat some yummy ramen!"}
{"text":"Oh how I love ramen! My BF and I have been going to many of the local favorite spots in town to see which is our favorite ramen spot. We finally got the time to come to JINYA, and it was good! Probably not out favorite tho. Despite that statement, their ramen is still pretty good.   We walked in and the design is so pretty! There was no wait so we were seated right away and at once all of their staff greeted us (super awesome!!). They greet each guest that arrives and it just kicks off a great first impression.   We opted for the Takoyaki as an appetizer, which is a popular Japanese dish made of octopus balls with bonito flakes (fish flakes that move!!) I've seen this dish in maybe 3 other restaurant I've ever gone to and this was finally my chance to try it. We enjoyed it, but felt like something was missing. Still a good experience tho!!  For our bowls I got the JINYA Tonkatsu Black Ramen and I added corn and fresh garlic to it. It came with thin noodles and I kinda regret that I didn't request for thick noodles.. I feel like I might've enjoyed the thick noodles better. The broth was not as rich as I anticipated for. I've had richer broth before - this just had something missing. I had to then add extra sauce and seasoning to it to reach my liking. Nonetheless I did end up enjoying my bowl and it filled me up super quick I had to make my BF finish the rest for me!   My BF ordered the JINYA Chicken Ramen. He enjoyed it! I didn't get the chance to try some of it but he also agreed that there was something missing.   Maybe we just need to come another time and try more! I love how they have happy hour so we shall be back!"}
{"text":"This place is BUSY, so expect a wait. Wait for a booth if you can as the communal table can be a little cramped and uncomfortable (had to keep jacket on and purse on lap). The food is worth it though. The creamy vegan ramen is amazing."}
{"text":"Love the food specially the sweet potato fries and Veggie Ramen server was very friendly!"}
{"text":"So, this used to be my go to spot. Im talking once or twice a week at least. That has now changed drastically. The past 4 times I have been the service is TERRIBLE. The servers are always in a FOUL mood that you can visibley see. To the point where getting/ asking for anything like basic utensils or side dishes is pulling teeth. It is super uncomfortable. I don't know what is going on but you are made to feel completely unwanted and it is an inconvenience your there. The Ramen is still excellent as usual but I will now be looking for a new spot, as this has been the environment multiple times. Shame..."}
{"text":"Jinya has THE BEST Vegan Ramen in Vegas. Honestly it may be the best vegan/vegetarian ramen period. Other ramen bars like Manta only offer chicken or pork based broth, but not here.   I take out of town guests here when visiting as i can rely on it to always be a crowd pleaser. Most recently I took my cousin and a friend here this past Saturday for lunch. They said it was the best ramen they've ever had.   One tip is to come here early. The restaurant is tiny with only 7-8 \"four tops\", 3 \"two tops\", and a bar for four surrounding a large communal table so the waitlist can tick up fast. We got here right at 11:30AM when the doors opened for lunch. There were already four other groups waiting ahead of us. So come early. I'd say this place is perfect for groups of four our less unless you don't mind splitting up due to the limited amount of tables and the usually long wait times during peak hours. I've sat at the communal table a few times with larger groups but it can sometimes be awkward for me.   I order the Spicy Creamy Vegan Ramen with garlic and mild spice. This bowl is served with thick noodles, a creamy broth, with fried garlic chips and a drizzle of garlic oil and chili oil. They bring whole pealed garlic cloves and a garlic press to the table to smash the garlic right into the ramen. This is my favorite bowl for sure. The other ramen bowl they offer which is also very good is the Vegetable Soup Ramen which is served with a clear broth and thin buckwheat noodles.   My friend and cousin ordered the Spicy Chicken Ramen and both thought it was so so good. As I mentioned earlier, one said it was the best she's ever had.   Just 10 min away from Las Vegas Blvd, it's worth a trip from locals and visitors alike."}
{"text":"Wow!!!! Best Ramen I've had since Japan.....amazing spicy miso tonkotsu ramen.....and the gyoza was wonderful. Five stars from me because the service and ambiance made the whole package five stars!!!"}
{"text":"i came here because after watching a movie at palms, It seemed like a nice place to try that was close. It was not very Gluten and vegetarian friendly but i kinda expected that. wish they offered grilled or fried Tofu. but over all it was a nice experience. Staff was super friendly and helpful they went out of their way to cater to my gluten and non animal eating diet."}
{"text":"I guess you can say upbeat location. The young lady at the entrance counter has amazing customer service, wish we got her name because she was the only staff with a great welcoming vibe. The only reason i have given them a 4 star is because their quantity of the dishes was really fresh and good. They ran out of beef so i had to work with what they had. Music extremely loud and you cant really socialize with your group here, so be alert of this!"}
{"text":"Very very delicious. Definitely a top ramen spot in Toronto. I got the CHA CHA CHA ramen and it was very heavy. When people who work at a ramen shop tell it's heavy, you know it'll be heavy and if you can't handle a fatty heavy meal you probably shouldn't be getting ramen in the first place. Otherwise stick with a garden salad."}
{"text":"They give you disposable chopsticks. Strike one. They skimp on the soup so there is barely any for you to drink after all the noodles have been eaten. Strike two. I ordered spicy chicken ramen and they sent out spicy pork ramen instead. Strike three.  There is absolutely no reason to eat here when other ramen joints (Ramen Raijin/Santouka/Kenzo) are a ten-minute walk away from this place. Sansotei is a little further but it's my favorite. Toronto has so many great ramen joints that Jinya simply cannot hold up."}
{"text":"Stopped in after work pretty late one night and got a bowl of ramen to go(call ahead since they are usually crowded) turns out I made a good decision because the place was packed. I soon found out why, the ramen was fantastic! I also got the pot stickers because I was starving and I needed a snack they were partly soft and then seared on the other side so they were crispy. Sooooo good. I highly recommend them!"}
{"text":"I come to Vegas once a month and came here for lunch today and was incredibly surprised at how incredible the food and service was. It is a small and friendly place and the food may have changed my life. My co-workers and I had a few appetizers and I had had a chicken bowl. I can truly say it is in the top ten foods that have entered my palate.  I lived it so much I walked 1.5 miles from hotel to eat it for dinner tonight.  Dinner was even better than I anticipated as I had The #1 bowl. I will be back for more next time I am in town."}
{"text":"Be prepared to wait on a Friday, Saturday, or Sunday! But it's WORTH the wait. I really wish they would expand their building or open new locations. I always get the spicy chicken ramen with thick noodles & mushrooms. It's everything! My experiences here have almost always been good. They've messed up my order wrong twice on separate occasions, but quickly corrected it. Or I've asked for a side of garlic and they've forgotten. The chicken wings are always good & the spicy mayo shrimp is always on point!"}
{"text":"Seems hit or miss....I've gone in for lunch and dinner. Lunch seemed to be better all around. The music is always too loud tho."}
{"text":"I have mix feelings about this place. The ramen tasted a bit too starchy, which made the broth a bit thicker than most places. Broth did tasted flavorful and the pork was super tender. The chashu and kimchi tacos was delicious! Also loved the Tokyo curry rice with shredded chicken. It was almost too addicting."}
{"text":"The best ramen outside of Japan itself! You MUST have your entire party present before being seated though. It's that busy!!!"}
{"text":"Great ramen, great service!! Food came fast and hot, green tea is really good! A little noisy but not too bad. Definitely will be returning."}
{"text":"Jinya serves up authentic and delicious ramen in a causal environment. Everything I tried here was excellent, and the service was fast. We even came for an early dinner after the Toronto Pride parade and were seated right away/got our food quickly despite the crowded. We ordered the sprouting up and the tonkatsu spicy ramen along with their gyoza. The gyoza arrived hot, and were perfectly tender yet crispy  with the right amount of filling. The sprouting up ramen was also great. The creamy broth was rich, savory, and not overly salty (though the Brussels sprouts and fall-apart tender pork were my favorite part). The spicy tonkatsu that my girlfriend ordered was delicious  too, with tender pork and the right amount of spicy and flavor without too much heat. I will definitely come here again next time I am in Toronto!"}
{"text":"Love this place in Los Angeles and had to try it in Vegas! Definitely worth getting off the strip to come here and eat well and save dollar dollar bills ya'll. Crispy chicken was delicious with a nice sauce. The cilantro chicken ramen was delicious on a cloudy, rainy day."}
{"text":"This is definitely the best ramen house. I absolutely love the ambiance here. Servers were very friendly and efficient. The food is absolutely delicious! I had tonkotsu spicy noodle soup.... very authentic Japanese ramen. It's not too often that I'll walk away from a restaurant and think about it again but this place here, is on my mind constantly! You will love it!"}
{"text":"JAPANESE FOOD PORN (Warning: Young adults from Central Florida in for vacation) Besides offering us some of the best tasting cuisine during our visit- awesome prices as well- the large soups delivered are also visually delicious. No add-ins needed. This visual presentation had a drawback- our Takoyaki arrived doused in sauces and flakes. Visually very appealing however I don't like my dishes drowning and overwhelmed in sauce.  DELICIOUS AND COMFORTING RAMEN Oh how complicated yet delicious my Jinya Tonkotsu Black was! It wasn't too oily or salty. Splashes of boiling garlic oil and dabs of hot sauce allowed for various flavors to suddenly creep up in the middle of eating. The Cha Cha Cha was very garlicky but still approachable. Both contained generous amounts of soft pork, crunchy vegetables, seasoned & soft egg. All the toppings made every bite slightly different.   WELCOMING AND CASUAL RESTAURANT Two large tables at the center allow for big groups and community-style seating (although there's also other areas for 6-tops.) Other seats allow a great view into the kitchen. It doesn't seem very large inside- perhaps because every seat was taken during our Friday lunch- yet the look was comfy because of all the wood decor mixed in with black and red colors."}
{"text":"I came here at Monday night at 11pm.The turn over is the slowest restaurant I have ever seen.  It took 20 mins to clean up the table and ready to be seat for customers when half of tables are vacant.  Finally I seat at 12:50am. Service attitude is 2/5 also."}
{"text":"A friend recommended me here when asked about a new place . I love it ! I try to come often. I love the noodles always perfectly cooked and spicy less is perfect ! Also they have Jinya Buns so good and delicious as well . The desserts are pretty tasty too  Very great prices ! Always cold inside . But overall it's a bomb place !"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing. I had the pork bun & the ramen with black garlic oil, pork & thin noodles. The most amazing food I have ever had."}
{"text":"I was helped by Angela and she was super nice and friendly! The ramen was delicious and the overall ambiance of the place is really cool. Dark and intimate, open kitchen so you can see what's going on. I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Yum! I got the Sprouting Up Ramen, and it was delicious! The Brussels Sprouts are a creative addition to ramen (and totally welcome from me, because I am a weirdo that loves Brussels Sprouts). The broth was light and pretty good (not quite as flavorful as Monta, but it worked well with the other components of the ramen and I enjoyed it).  Overall, this is a good ramen spot!   Oh! I also got the Salmon Poke Tacos.. I didn't like the marinade that the poke was in, but these are a good deal for $4.   I am excited to try more from this place!"}
{"text":"Seriously good Ramen! But no reservations and there is always line! But it's worth it!! Their fried chicken is soo good!"}
{"text":"I've only gone here once but I definitely won't be going again. The service was horrible. Our food took half an hour and the place was not very busy. Another issue was at the end, when we were paying, the waitress gave us our bills, asked if we needed change and when we said yes, left the table and didn't come back for another 5 minutes. Another issue was the vegetarian ramen that my friend had was not completely vegetarian.   The food was good once it came though and the restaurant itself is quite nice. However, I won't be coming back as there are other ramen places that have better service and taste just as good."}
{"text":"This place is fine. It's open late so it'll scratch your itch for a late ramen run. The place isn't huge so do expect to wait a bit, especially if you're Asian and it's late at night because every other Asian is trying to do the same thing as you.  I personally like garlicky things, so I do recommend the Cha Cha one. I also personally think this branch looks cooler than the one in Los Angeles (if anyone cares about that)."}
{"text":"I'm a Pescatarian and haven't had a bowl of noodle soup in over a year and a half due to everything is made with a meat based broth... So when I heard this place had a vegetable broth ramen I was all in! We started off with a spicy tuna roll that wasn't spicy at all... I ordered the vegetable ramen with a seasoned boiled egg and a poached egg with a side of spicy beansprouts and it was AMAZING!! Holy moly! Talk about being flavorful! I drank and ate everything in that bowl! And the spicy beansprouts was marinated in this amazing spicy sauce... *drool* Definitely try this place out if you like ramen and prices are very reasonable! Very happy and will be back.  http://www.jinya-ramenbar.com/menus/"}
{"text":"So the first time I came here with my boyfriend it was good. I ordered the Veggie Ramen and  we had pannacota for dessert. The Ramen isn't that amazing in flavor but it's good enough when you're  craving ramen late at night. The server was very friendly. I forgot his name but I wish my boyfriend or I remembered! Yet, when we came here for our third time, it wasn't a good experience at all which made us not want to come back. The restaurant surprisingly wasn't completely full that night and the server (Ashley) took us to our seats. I ordered my Veggie Ramen and asked her if I could just have the veggies and no noodles... and she said no right away. When the last time I came (my second time ) they were able to do that and even the manager was the one who gave the thumbs up for this request. Also, when we finished ordering our food right away we asked if it was possible to move to the table on our right side next to us (we wanted to sit there because it was on the very corner and I feel much better like that because of my anxiety). Yet, Ashley said no, that she couldn't do that. That once she sits us down , \"she can't move us somewhere else.\" I felt very frustrated at how a server could be this rude and not give good hospitality. She is clueless about what it means to be a good server."}
{"text":"Try the wonton soup! The chefs special is marvelous! The wonton soup is not only good, the meat inside the wonton has amazing texture, and it's unique flavor! This is the second time we came, and the place was packed. They give you the option of open table, or something more private!"}
{"text":"Any new business has growing pains and some of these reviews are just over the top in complaints (who cares if management is Chinese or Taiwanese). It would be my understanding that they ironed it all out, the food order was taken quickly, food came out and we were asked several times if we needed anything else. The ramen was great! Meat was tender, broth was flavourful and the noodles were perfect. Also had the tempura brussel sprouts! Yum!!  Upon leaving, they thanked us for our patronage. I'll be back again!!"}
{"text":"The wait was long, when we finally got called we got placed at the big table and saw there was an empty booth seat so we asked to have the booth and they told us no. We ordered the spicy chicken ramen and it was horrible. I'm from New York and compared to the ramen I've had there, this place was terrible. The chicken was rubbery and did not taste fresh, the spinach was raw, it was extremely salty, the flavor was just altogether horrible. Not coming back here next time I'm in Vegas. They're running this place on a temporary license which expires April 2018, I wonder why..."}
{"text":"The ramen and crispy shrimp ball are very delicious. Good place! Good food! Definitely we will come back."}
{"text":"Today was my third time here. I remember in the past the ramen was always just the average i came here mainly for their takoyaki since it was the best in town. Today i realize they changed the menu again and even raised the price AGAIN!! They changed the menu so many times in the past to let people think they add new stuffs but actually they were just raising the price! And the portion keep getting smaller and smaller! The meat comes with super mini size and the ramen portion were too small. Me and my boyfriend were so mad because we waited 30minutes for slow service +worst food +overprise??I gave this place chances but they just keep getting worst! Wont come here again and i will rather go buy a takoyaki machine on amazon because their sauce is easy to copy lol"}
{"text":"This place is pretty good.  We got the spicy pork tonkatsku ramen and the pork buns.  Both were good.  The ramen wasn't too salty and had enough flavor.  The pork buns were really good.  The buns were moist and soft and the pork belly was tender.  Will try other stuff next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"Best ramen ever. Those chicken won tons are literally the best won tons I have ever had. Nom"}
{"text":"Small plates were pretty cool. Definitely recommend the truffle brussell sprouts and pork buns,  Ramen was just OK, though. Thin noodles and broth was not thick, rich, or hearty."}
{"text":"Up until last week, the only ramen I ever had was the kind in a cup. I was in the mood for soup last week and decided to hit up Jinya as its right down the street from work. I went in and there were a lot of people waiting. The dining room is pretty small. I asked how long the wait was but the hostess had no idea. I only get an hour lunch break so I had to leave. I am not sure if they take reservations, I think it is first come first serve, so be advised.    I decided to go back a few days later and luckily there was no wait. I sat at the big family sized table right in the middle of the restaurant. This table seats at least 20 people, so if you don't mind eating in front of strangers then you are good to go.  They do have a few smaller tables that border the large table, but they were all full.   Anyways I sat down and was given a menu. I already knew what I wanted, and that was the Tonkotsu Assari. It took a good 25 minutes to come out. When it finally came out I slurped myself into a ramen oblivion. It was very good and filling. Unfortunately this type of meal has loads and loads of sodium, so it is probably best to just have occasionally. It is tempting to go everyday when the weather is cold though! The service was good and the waitress was nice. Packaged ramen you can suck it! There is a new sheriff in town.  Yelp 2015 Review #6"}
{"text":"Thank god for the billboard along the freeway, traffic busy took detours was headed to Caesars buffet, glad I came here instead!"}
{"text":"5 stars???...NO WAY....Maybe 6 or 7!  This place rocks! I am from Hawaii and know my local kine food grinds. And Jinya does it right!  1st of all, 3-5PM is the Happy Hour Special and the prices are great, especially if you want to sample a few appetizers for only 2 bucks apiece!  The atmosphere is open, rustic, and comfortable. The music playing throughout our meal was outstanding. If you like The Paper Kites (look them up on iTunes), then you'll enjoy all the music. We did!  Service? Outstanding! Very friendly and helpful to make the right choices. And very accommodating when we needed 'to go' bags, bowls, etc.  The food? 10/10! The pork bun was tender and very flavorful. Yummy for the tummy.  We decided to share the Tonkotsu Black Ramen bowl, based on our waiter's suggestion. Again, a perfect choice and very flavorful!  Lastly, I can't wait to go back! The only downside was the location. Not in the best of neighborhoods and about a mile or so off the Strip. We walked from The Palms and it was okay. It is worth taking a cab though, because the food is great!"}
{"text":"Fist time eating here and it got me melting. Alicia was my server and she was really welcoming, helpful as far as recommending what's good and overall really nice. I would definitely come back, and highly recommend this place if your looking for something that really hits the spot especially during the nice cold weather."}
{"text":"I came here many times. This location open late and the broth is excellent. Not too salty compare to Shoku Ramen and Monta. The bowl is around $9 but it includes stuffs that I like so no complaint. Monta starts at $7 then you add stuffs in and at the end comes to the same price. The fried chicken is okay. It is busied after 10pm but slow during the day, so if you don't want to wait come during the day time. But then the line is not bad compare to Broiling Crab! :)"}
{"text":"I loved this place. I got chicken ramen, goyoza and terra cotta. The guy who took my call was well informed, polite and patient. I had such a good meal at home. Wonderful place! Delicious food!"}
{"text":"Came here looking for a good ramen restaurant. And yep, we found one. It's almost as good as home! Reminds me of AGU ramen at home. The restaurant is of descent size, the staff are friendly and service is quick. We ordered our usual gyoza and also tried the jinya buns. They both were good :) The noodles--you can order them thick or thin. I had the tonkatsu and the kids had the miso. All were great. I recommend that you try this place if you are a true fan of good ramen and dashi. There are lots to choose from with add-ons as well. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Never getting Ramen anywhere else in Vegas. I don't like close by but the drive is so worth it. Be prepared for a wait time there is usually a little bit of a line and I totally get why! The appetizers are delicious. The best one in my opinion is the pork bun its soooo good! They have other meals other than ramen but I mean the ramen is too delicious to pass up so I have to order it!"}
{"text":"I had the \"cha cha cha ramen\" or garlic lovers Ramen with creamy garlic broth, thick noodles, soft boiled egg, tofu and char siu pieces. Super good and definitely very authentic.   Aside from the good food, we had awesome service. Definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great place to go if you're craving some great ramen that's off the strip but still close by. Their portions are huge too!!!   I would highly recommend going during their happy hour for discounted appetizers! Their menu is a little small but everything we ordered was excellent.   They have family-style dining areas of you don't mind sitting next to strangers or you can wait a little longer for your own table.   I ordered their spicy chicken ramen... So darn good I'm drooling just thinking about it! I highly recommend their gyoza and their almond tofu desert as well!!  I'm absolutely coming here again the next time in in the area!"}
{"text":"server was nice. a little over priced ? soup was good. extra 4.20 for salad and 4 gyozas. didn't like the salad dressing so server gave me a creamy sesame dressing which was much better"}
{"text":"I'm not sorry for what I'm about to say... but this place is way better than Monta and Ramen Sora. Period. I honestly think it's the best ramen place in Vegas.  Getting seated here is usually very quick. Orders are taken in a timely manner. The wait for food isn't usually long. The ambiance is very chill and relaxed with dim lighting. It's great for a large group of friends or even eating alone.   I always get the Tonkatsu Black with a Jinya Bun. EVERYONE should try the Jinya Bun. It will change your life -- savory pork belly that melts in your mouth, a mayo-like sauce, with small slices of cucumbers and some greens on a fluffy white bun. My mouth is watering just thinking about it.  Ramen broth is not too salty. It's actually very flavorful and not too overpowering. I used to be a die-hard thick noodles kinda gal. But Jinya made me appreciate thin noodles which I now love!  And if you're not feeling like getting pork, get the chicken ramen. Much lighter feeling after eating but still very tasty.   I love this place, hands down."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised with the steps Jinya has made to better their customer service. I previously wrote a negative comment about my to-go experience and I'm happy to report an excellent change.  My order was ready on time, the food, still delicious and I wasn't given false hope. My order was accurate and the woman who was in front was very helpful. Thank you for improving your service."}
{"text":"I'm not going lie but jinya has a decent ramen and will get the job done.   I love how it's open till 3 am here because I get late night cravings all the time.   My favorite ramen here is spicy chicken ramen. It's perfectly flavored and not too thick where you feel nasty afterwards.   I've also tried Cha Cha Cha and it wasn't my favorite. Way too fatty for me and not enough garlic on its own when it's suppose to be for garlic lovers. It kinda tasted like a soy sauce soup base also.   They also have great chicken karage here! Perfectly breaded and fried."}
{"text":"We were on our way to Canmore and decided to stop by Jinya for a late night dinner.  It was great for a quick ramen / rice bowl fix before a long weekend ahead!  Atmosphere: 4/5  It was almost 9pm by the time we arrived, and I was surprised to see the place was still quite busy with a line outside despite being near closing time.  The restaurant is not huge but has nice and modern decor with an open kitchen area.  We were seated at the bar which I didn't mind at all and enjoyed the bustling atmosphere as staff prepared food.  Thankfully we were able to find parking easily on a side street.  Service: 4/5 Efficient and friendly; staff took our orders quickly and our food was delivered piping hot!  Food: 3.5/5  I had the pork chashu bowl.  Overall tasty dish.  I liked how the meat was marinaded well.  The chashu was a little too fatty for me but that is also the nature of chashu.  I would've liked more vegetables.  The egg was very delicious!!  I also tried some of my friends' tonkotsu broth which tasted good and satisfying; the ramen itself I thought was pretty typical in terms of texture.  Overall satisfactory.  Price: 3/5  Reasonable for size / amount of food  Overall: 4/5  Overall good experience at this ramen joint for a quick and hot meal before continuing our journey to the mountains.  I would have liked a slightly larger bowl as I was still a little hungry afterwards.  I would return to try some of their other signature ramens."}
{"text":"Other than the fact they don't take reservations I give this restaurant 5 stars! Great service and good food! Love the JINYA bun and cha cha cha ramen was my favourite!"}
{"text":"Arrived at 10:30pm to try it out. Guy tells me it's closed and he already did 'last call'.  Don't advertise 'open until 11pm' including your window sign if you are not willing to actually be open those hours."}
{"text":"I ordered the chef's special ramen and I didn't like it at all. I was disappointed with the caramelized cauliflower but the tacos were good."}
{"text":"This is the best ramen place in Vegas imo, and I've been to quite a few. I love the variety they offer, as well as they quality of the ramen. I found out about this place a few months ago, and it has easily become a favorite of mine."}
{"text":"Okay, this is my second time here and I nearly died this time! This is a MUST when you're in Vegas, like how can you not love this place? I had the vegan Ramen and we ordered edamame for appetizer. The ramen tasted like God himself was in the kitchen prepping all day-- it was heavenly! Highly recommend. Make sure you try their lycheetini and bring a sweater because they kee the place cold since you're eating hot soup. Can't wait to go again!"}
{"text":"When in Vegas, I always try to get here, especially for the brussel sprout tempura. I try a variety of ramen, so I can't recommend just one, but all are good. The service is always great and prompt, especially for the crowd. A little patience goes a long way and you only make yourself suffer. If you can't wait, please move on."}
{"text":"Very good flavor for ramen.  Got the cha cha cha for garlic lovers.  I thought I cooked with a lot of garlic.  Wow. The amount of garlic this ramen has will kill a vampire off.  That is not a negative review.  Very good if you like garlic.  I just wished it had a little more meat with the ramen. Still very good and would get this ramen again."}
{"text":"Service is terrible. I could not get any workers attention . It would have been easier if I jumped over the counter and refilled my water myself. Otherwise, the food is great and the atmosphere is cool. My girlfriend and I got some chicken wings and gyoza . She got  the spicy chicken ramen and loved it and I ate the Cha Cha Cha ramen. The broth is amazing, the noodles were great and everything else was delicious as well. Only critique I would say is that it had a bit too many bean sprouts,but that is just my opinion. I feel a lot of asian restaurants use them as fillers and if you use too many they just rob the rich flavor of the food. Anyway, if you aren't in a rush check it out, but if you are short on time I would go elsewhere.  Oh,The seats for the booths are massive so if you are ridiculously fat then don't worry. You will slide that fat ass right in there and feel right at home."}
{"text":"Awesome place for ramen. My favorite is the tonkotsu black with corn. They have different selections of ramen from chicken based broth to pork and even vegetable broth I believe, I don't remember. Their sides are good like the crispy chicken and gyozas. The place is very dimly lit and follows the same tradition of keeping the place small and cozy for a ramen place. Overall great place if your craving ramen."}
{"text":"Terrible. The wait was an hour to just sit down. The hostess was so rude. First time and not returning."}
{"text":"Our waitress had a hard time hearing us and kept getting our order wrong because the music was too loud. I could hardly hear the person across from me. When I asked if they could turn the music down just a tad bit the waitress said it's a bar, the music is turned on or off...when clearly I heard the music get turned up as I was waiting in line. Atmosphere could be improved. Food is good."}
{"text":"Everybody compares every ramen place to the next so I will as well.  While this place isn't the best ramen I've had in town, (shout out to ramen sora) it is hands down the second best I have had.  The menu is definitely larger than ramen sora and seems a lot more hip in that there are different appetizer combinations and items to try like tacos.  The place itself is in an old fast food building which seemed odd at first but is really nicely decorated inside and was very welcoming!  Every time I have been here there has been a line out the door so that shows that it is definitely doing something right.  They have their ramens that you can get but there is a so a high level of customization that you can do to make it how you like, although everything is a la carte (not expensive though).  Too me the broth seemed a lot thicker than other places I have been to, almost like a gravy, which isn't a bad thing by far, just different.  I do like how you can make a combo meal though with a salad, rice bowl of some type, and your ramen.  Oh and ramen only comes in one size although you can add fresh noodles to your broth during the meal!"}
{"text":"We came here for dinner with friends, and had a great time! Service was great and quick. Our waitress made some suggestions and which I had ordered and they were amazing!   We ordered the shrimp balls and tempura brussle sprouts appetizers. The shrimp balls were very tasty. The Brussel sprouts were okay, I wish they came with a dipping sauce as they were kinda missing something.  I ordered the spicy chicken ramen, with flavored egg. It was delicious. I would have to say it was the best ramen I have ever had. I ordered it the hottest it comes, and it only made my eyes run but it wasn't too hot for me.   My fiance ordered the pork cha cha cha, she enjoyed it, she didn't finish because the portions was a bit much for her. The broth seemed a bit thicker, but still delicious.  This is a very good ramen stop. Thr hard wood benches were a bit uncomfortable. I did notice a drive thru but I'm not entirely sure if it's functional. I would recommend trying this place out!"}
{"text":"Came back again , still great this is our 4th or 5th time , little busy but the staff kept up , tried the pork bun for the first time , if you order one thing to start your meal make sure it this , so rich and very very tasty might be the single best thing I had tonight but the Ramen is always stellar ."}
{"text":"This place is the best! You won't be disappointed. Experienced & novice ramen eaters alike. This is my favorite ramen place in Vegas & I've tried just about all of them in the area. They have options for everyone, even a vegan ramen that is delicious. The food is great & quality. The customer service is always friendly & hospitable. They really know what they're doing! My all time favorite is that Cha Cha Cha!"}
{"text":"The ramen broth here is excellent!  Their menu offers many different broth and spice combinations to highlight all their flavors; it's not just a broth with however many sides you want to throw in.   Their tonkotsu broth is SUPER thick which shows how much fat and flavor the chefs were able to cook into the broth. My favorite variation was the tonkotsu black which is the basic broth topped with a black garlic oil and some chili paste. The tonkotsu white is a mix of tonkotsu broth and chicken broth. It's much soupier with a lighter (but still amazing) flavor. There is seriously so much to choose from, so their ramen soups can satisfy anyone's palette.   My must have is the takoyaki. It has such a creamy texture on the inside and they are generous with the octopus. Most other takoyaki that I've tried have a strong artificial ginger flavor in their sauce. This stuff tasted like the real deal! The ginger flavor here was subtle and exactly what I want when enjoying takoyaki. Instead of covering the takoyaki with Japanese mayonnaise, the balls are placed on a bed of egg salad. It was such an interesting combination. It added to the creaminess and I found myself eating every last bite of the salad.    The wait here can be long but it's well worth it! This place is good to go solo. They have a bar and a huge community table so dining alone will get you to a table much quicker.   I enjoyed everything I ate at Jinya Ramen and I can't wait to be back for more!"}
{"text":"The Skinny: although not the best ramen I've ever had, this might be the best bowl of tonkotsu ramen in the Las Vegas area so far. That being said, I'd skip the spicy chicken ramen. The truffled brussel sprouts are brilliant (3.5) service: prompt and helpful (4) value: a bit pricier than its counterparts, it's definitely worth a trip (4 starred review).  We were stalking Jinya on Facebook to check for its grand opening - eager to find a decent ramen joint in town. We managed to come in on the second day of opening. It was so good, we dropped by the next day with a pal to take in their happy hour specials.  First, the ambience. I think the tendency for this joint is to turn up the tunes - loud. Although their music selection is good (MJ is classic), I kind of prefer not having to shout across the table to the hubs. Luckily the manager is accomodating and turned it down a notch for the comfort of my tympanic membranes. The decor is comfortable - lots of open spaces with variable methods of seating. Bathrooms are nice and clean - the women's bathroom even sports a real Japanese toilet with heated seat, bidet, and butt dryer.  Service is prompt and friendly while our water glasses were never left unfilled.   On to the food.  In our two visits we were able to try multiple items:   Tonkotsu Black Ramen ($10.55): the broth: overall, not bad. There is some porky depth to their broth which as appealing and the flavor wasn't too muddled with other things. On a broth scale, they'd get a 3.5/5. The noodles are the thin traditional hakata style tonkotsu noodles which gets extra bonus points. These were cooked well and had a nice bite to it (4/5). The toppings: the chasu had a nice soy flavor to it, and melted in your mouth. The egg was a tad overcooked for my tastes (I like it a little more runny) but again marinated well (4/5). In terms of tonkotsu ramen, I'd say this is a 3.5/5 on a ramen scale which would put it decidedly as one of the best bowls of ramen we've had in the Las Vegas Area. I think this is first joint in Las Vegas where we'd ever finish all the broth.  Spicy Chicken Ramen ($9.55): their number two most popular ramen. The broth: although the broth had a nice thickness to it, it just didn't have enough chicken flavor. On a broth scale, it was about a 2/5. The noodles were the typical curly thicker noodles which were done well 4/5. The toppings: the chicken chasu was tough and didn't melt in your mouth like the pork chasu. Served with bean sprouts, green onion and spinach, the toppings here didn't wow me (2/5). This ramen bowl would get a 2/5 and I wouldn't recommend it.  Brussel Sprout tempura with truffle oil and salt ($5.80): this is the only time I've ever seen the hubs voluntarily gobble down brussel sprouts. The batter was crisp, light with just the right amount of salt.. When combined with the truffle oil, the flavors worked really well together. A must try item!  Tako-yaki ($4.80): served on a bed of egg salad, this rendition of tako-yaki was good with nice flavor. The filling was light without the being too gummy. It could be a bit crispier on the outside but otherwise a good decent dish with a very healthy serving size for the price.  Happy Hour Special items include Jinya bun ($3), Crispy chicken ($3/5 pcs), Jinya Quinoa Salad ($3), Edamame ($2), Marinated Spinach ($2), Baby Leaf Salad ($2), An-Nin Tofu (sweet almond tofu with fruit, $2).   Jinya bun ($3): this is a steamed bun with a slice of pork belly with some lettuce, cucumber and a drizzle of sweet soy sauce marinade. The bun was steamed perfectly and had that perfect texture. The ratio of meat/bun was good. The pork belly melts in your mouth although it was a little fatty. The time we had it, I think it was a tad sweet but otherwise the flavors and textures were very good. The buns are larger than you think. Would recommend trying this.  Crispy Chicken ($3/5 pcs): this is a very large portion size of karaage for the price. To be honest, the crispy chicken was a little on the dry side on the inside for me albeit very crisp on the outside as advertised. I'm not sure if I would order this again.  Marinated Spinach ($2): sprinkled with sesame seeds, this was dish was marinated in a sweet soy sauce. Overall, it was okay but not something I felt I needed to order again.  Baby Leaf Salad ($2): I found the dressing to be a bit watery and under seasoned - could probably use a bit more onion in the dressing to make the flavors in the daikon dressing pop. I'd probably skip on this one.  An-Nin Tofu ($2): this is almost like an almond tofu mousse in texture and incredible soft. For my tastes, it didn't have quite enough almond taste to but it was nice and light. Not a bad dessert, may order it again if we come for happy hour again.  Given that they make one of the better bowls of ramen in the Las Vegas area, I would recommend you come in for their tonkotsu ramen and the brussel sprouts tempura.

{"text":"This needs to be on your must try list! Ramen is delicious here! The sides and additions variety is great. Get there early. It's always busy"}
{"text":"This was my first ramen experience not in a cup purchased from the supermarket for about 28 cents.   The place is a little loud for me and every time I go, it seems like it's a half hour wait.   But I can't fault them for the wait, they are popular and don't have too much seating.    The broth is tasty.   Maybe a little salty for my taste but nonetheless it was enjoyable.   The noodles I have no complaints about either.   Where the stars went shooting from a 4 down to a 3 was the meat.  I got the one with chicken and they give like two fairly small pieces.   Chicken is cheap as hell.   Can I please have a semi respectable amount in my bowl???    It just feels like it's not proportionate.   And the chicken itself is nothing at all special.  But a brother needs some protein with his meals.    Honestly, I'd rather get pho than ramen.  So I won't be back.  But hey, to each their own."}
{"text":"Ordered veggie ramen to go for before flight dinner. Was feeling sick and craved broth and veggies. This hit the spot. Broth full of flavor, ramen perfectly chewy and not over cooked and vegetables still crisp enough. Better than any airport food. Would go back again next time I'm in Vegas. May visit Cali location too. Recommending to Vegas and Valley friends."}
{"text":"Man it takes a lot to get lazy me to write a review and this place was a lot. A lot of flavor! Jeez I have been dying to try a good ramen place and this is it! I was just lucky to yelp it when dropping a friend off nearby serisouly it's so delicious prices are very reasonable and a great atmosphere. 10/10 WILL come again!"}
{"text":"i can't say anything about the service of this place because i actually had it postmated to my hotel while staying here in vegas. but the ramen was amazing! i got the spicy vegan ramen, which i was soooo happy to see was on the menu, and my girlfriend got the veggie ramen (+ tofu). both were full of flavor and packed with veggies. we also got the spicy tuna mini tacos? i believe these were around $5 for two SUPER little tacos. i guess they really meant mini, wouldn't get them again. id go back for the ramen!"}
{"text":"JINYA Ramen Bar is one of the best I have been to!  They were very accommodating. We went after my son's high school graduation and they very graciously hosted our large group of 11!  Our server, Gino (I think I remember correctly) was quite possibly THE BEST server I have ever had, actually the entire staff was excellent.  They prepared a special dessert for my son for his big day! THANK YOU FOR A PERFECT SPECIAL DINNER TO ALL AT JINYA!!!"}
{"text":"Best ramen in Vegas hands down.. Love them all but especially love the spicy vegan ramen with the THICK noodles, and I'm not even vegan. Long lines but worth the wait."}
{"text":"Had the Cha Cha Cha! It was fantastic! They even easily made it a chicken dish instead of pork for no extra charge. I was completely full and satisfied.   Come here for awesome food!"}
{"text":"Was my first time trying this spot while visiting Vegas and I wasn't pleased. I've been to several spots throughout southern California and Vegas and this place was by far was the worst out of the ramen spots. Even ten Rens tea time that doesn't even specialize in ramen has better tasting tonkotsu ramen. I ordered the tonkotsu with an extra side of chashu. At first I was enjoying the broth and the Noodles. The broth was the only reason I didnt give it a one star. I then proceeded to biting into the chashu (pork) and it tasted bland and to top it off, it was cold. I couldn't believe it and I even had to ask a waiter why this was. She said that jinya serves their chashu cold. That's when I ordered the side of chashu to see if it was true. I got it and felt it and yep it was cold AF. I couldn't believe it.. Other than the over all dish tasting OK, the service was great and the enviroment was chill. Will not be coming back because I look for ramen that wows me and the ramen was underwhelming at best."}
{"text":"So, heard lots of people talking about this place so give it a try.  One star for the ramen noodles and one star for the fried chicken. Chicken was not bad compare to allots of ramen places. Ramen texture was good as most ramen places have to have good ramen.  See in the picture the cha siu or pork belly is ripped off and is way too thin slices. Pork belly have to be in a good shape and thickness not sure why is it ripped off like that. Nothing special about it I would say around 2.5 stars for this place. Also I went at a quite time that the kitchen have lots of time to prepare a bowl of ramen instead of busy hours where they just make it fast and messy.  Gotta fix on the cha siu though."}
{"text":"So amazing. Get the mini tacos. You're welcome. Pretty much a true Asian bistro, and a line out the door always means amazing."}
{"text":"Checked this place out after finally waiting months under construction. Walking inside, you're met with a traditional Japanese greeting shouted out by all the staff.  The restaurant itself looks great and it's very pleasing to the eye.  There is a good amount of seating; table seating and bartop seating.  The service was awesome from my waitresses who explained the menu and was attentive. I ordered the Spicy Chicken Ramen which came out very quick. THIS ramen was pretty darn delicious. A good portion and balance of noodles, broth and the chicken so tender that it breaks up into nice small pieces when you mix it all around. Overall this would be a must try if you're looking for a decent ramen, good atmosphere and attentive service."}
{"text":"Okay, this is the Best ramen place I've been to, hands down. My friend introduced me to JINYA yesterday and I ordered the tonkatsu black ramen and the panna cotta. The ramen exceeded my expectations by far. The panna cotta was not the best I've had, but still very delicious. Now let's talk service. Every worker in the place had something great to contribute. Our server was excellent! I cannot recall his name but I will update this when I visit again. Even the cooks had some great conversation! Everyone was so friendly and nice and I shall be going again tonight because of how great everything was!"}
{"text":"We were surprised what this small place offers. Nice unique decor. A huge table in the middle where people can sit and there are booths on the side. The ramen noodles that we had were all good, the best broth that we had was Jinya Chicken. I always get the dessert Panna Cotta, which is the best ending to a nice warm meal."}
{"text":"Along with an upbeat rhythmic atmosphere, not to mention the late night availability, this ramen joint is pretty great! Food's amazing and very fast whenever you're getting apps or a quick bite to eat! Oh and the ramen is perfect, not to chewy but also not too soft as well ... just right."}
{"text":"After living in Hong Kong and testing out some amazing ramen I can't say this place is that great. Good, but definitely not great. I miss the flavours of Asia!"}
{"text":"Hands down, worst service in Vegas. Didn't even get to eat my food because my server never gave me the time of day when I would try to get her attention for silverware... didn't get one refill. Just a joke."}
{"text":"I went to a gem when I stopped by this place.  I've been to Japan many times and love to get real ramen, something that can be hard to come by in the US.  But this place is firing on all cylinders.  The ramen is flavorful and did not disappoint me. In addition I really liked the way the wait staff worked, it seems that everyone works together and stops by to ask if anything else is needed, and all were very friendly. Next time I'm in Vegas I'll stop by again."}
{"text":"vegas currently has quite a few ramen places, most below average.  so when i heard about this place and saw all the rave reviews, i thought to myself, \"self, it's just gonna be as disappointing as monta\". how terribly wrong was i???  jinya does what the monta's of the world wished they could do. they make a broth so flavorful without adding the salt that others do. they make noodles that are perfectly al dente, even the skinny ones. because, in the end, the only things that really matter in a bowl of ramen are the broth and the noodles. oh, wait, and the egg too! theirs is perfectly seasoned and perfectly cooked.  there was only one time that i went and the noodles were actually undercooked. other than that, they have been consistently good.  is it as good as japan, not really. is it as good as los angeles, yes."}
{"text":"In town for a weekend event, and this restaurant was close by so we popped in. Greeted promptly, seating available looking out onto always entertaining corner of Carlton and Church. I have never had \"real\" ramen before and ordered the Sprouting Up ramen, and this was delicious! Love the egg, and always love Brussels sprouts. I would definitely come back, and recommend this spot highly."}
{"text":"Another ramen spot checked off the list. Living in a city with so many ramen spots, when i crave ramen I feel the need to try a new place.   When we got there the wait was about 20 min they were pretty busy.  Biggest take away the pork chashu bowl is GOOOOD! Way better than any other place I've been and bigger too. It kinda has a sweet taste, I would go back just for that.  The ramen itself honestly was just like any other ramen house. The amount and size can be a bit decieving though. The bowl is larger than most places but they don't fill it up. I didnt feel full and I finished the whole thing which is very rare. So maybe mine was just smaller?!?   Our server was really nice. She explained the menu to us since we had never been there before and she gave us time to look it over. She came back a few times to check on us and asked how everything was. Overall the experience was pleasant.   I would go back if in the area."}
{"text":"This is an average ramen spot for me.  Nothing really wow'd me. Thin noodles are the way to go and don't forget to ask for the free garlic.  All the other toppings are extra.  I would probably try a different ramen place the next time I am in Vegas."}
{"text":"So the first time I went here I was super happy, it tasted great and I wanted to come again. I came here again and the place was out of pork broth at 5pm. They didn't even make it to their dinner rush yet. I pretty much come to ramen shops specifically for the pork broth and the majority of Jinya's menu uses pork broth. I ended up getting the spicy chicken ramen which was good, but pales in comparison to the tonkotsu black."}
{"text":"Meh. Service was good. They had 3$ pints of Sapporo for happy hour special. Seaweed salad was seriously lacking flavour. Edamame were fine. Gf had a vegan ramen that was overloaded with green onions, I had a pork spicy something that was incredibly salty. They are efficient at flipping tables ie : eat then gtfo."}
{"text":"Service is trash . Food is good tho, but that's if they don't forget some of your items . Every time I've gone something is always missing and the waiter never comes back after they drop off the food .  Flavor is great but , they have lost me as a customer 100% now after I've come for multiple redemptions ."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good but service needs to improve. We got there right around the time they opened. The place was already crowded and I think that the staff was not prepared. It took over 30 mins for our food to arrive.  They are located close to the Strip so it's pretty easy to get to.  I'll give them another chance when I'm back in Vegas. Hope things get better."}
{"text":"Jinya was pretty decent. Not the best ramen I've had, but not the worst. It's definitely worth visiting though and I'd rather eat here any day than pay exorbitant prices at The Strip for ramen.  My husband and I both ordered the Tonkotsu Black ramen. The broth was okay... it was a bit too salty for me, but my husband thought it was perfect. The nori was horrible! It tasted like rotting fish! It almost ruined the entire bowl.  The saving graces were the noodles and the pork chasu. Out of all the ramen places I ate in Vegas, JINYA had the best pork chashu. It had a good amount of actual MEAT as opposed to just fat on fat on fat. I also really liked the thin noodles, they weren't too heavy and still managed to have a great bite to them. The other toppings (kikurage, green onion, nori dried seaweed, seasoned egg, garlic chips, garlic oil, fried onion, spicy sauce) were also great complements.  I'd definitely eat here again next time I'm in town, but I may tell them to hold the nori... literally the WORST nori I've ever had."}
{"text":"Another Ramen spot added to the Vegas scene. One that heard lot of great things about and happy finally got to check out. I came here with some friends visiting from the 808. I was telling them about new Ramen spot in town. I had my worries cause back home Ramen is almost as common as Spam musubi. So pleasing the local boys would be tough. JINYA never missed a beat 808 style.  I remember years ago the building that JINYA in changed few times over the years. My last memories thinking was fast food chain. So walking into the restaurant was totally different world. I like the whole revamp look from the interior the lighting fixtures, the huge community table is different, still have your booths, also have small but tradition Ramen Bar area with bar stools (have your own private show of sorts watching the chefs at work), all the bowls Ramen serve in screams personality, the sake box of sorts that the tempura brussel sprouts served in, and even the outside clearly stands out. The fact that it opens till 3am...  JINYA not very big place but then again most Ramen spots here in Vegas not that big. So if you go when busy expect to wait or do like three of us did community table. We started with tow appetizers the JINYA bun and the Tempura Brussel Sprouts. The JINYA bun was ok. I was thinking more along the line of peking duck with oyster sauce in steamed bun. It amounted too was charsu in steamed bun. I needed sauce or something bring personality to the dish. The brussel sprouts that was amazing!! Honestly after having the brussel sprouts give regular traditional shrimp tempura bad name. The brussel sprouts was perfect nice al dente and hot inside. The tempura batter was perfect consistency not over heavy or light. It had the right amount of coating, flavor, and the truffle oil on top took it to another level. Appetizer that must in restaurant this is one highly recommend. Addicting we crushed it between three of us.   I went with the Tonkatsu Spicy. It had nice kick. I love the broth had so much depth and mention the kick again. If not enough they have different spicy condiments on the table. I love all the stuff that on top of the Ramen. You get nice size portion of noodles in the bowl. The bowl deceiving cause lip of the bowl not wide but deep bowl. I know had noodles till the end.   The menu has great diversity. Few more appetizers that looked (lot of the items have picture on the menu) good! The Ramen again diversity even have vegetarian one. One of the best things about the menu. They offer combinations with choice of appetizer plus ramen. The catch is can only go with the combinations they offer. Still something that can not think of other Ramen spots that offer it. Ramen and gyoza that must for me. I got the best of both worlds. The homemade gyoza was awesome. The combination gyoza you only get four pieces instead of regular order of six.   The service was excellent. She was on it the whole time."}
{"text":"So grateful to find this spot.  I've been so turned off by the common go to's around town that everyone swears by.   Came the first time and was satisfied.  Months and months later I am sick thought I'd give it another try.  Extremely satisfied.  The ingredients are great, good selection, really something for everyone.  I'm sure I would enjoy other things on the menu.  Tonkatsu white, thick noodles never disappoints!  Did I mention the customer service is insanely awesome! If you ever feel down these guys will somehow always put a smile on your face."}
{"text":"This is the second time I eat at Jinya Ramen Bar. Both times I had to wait around 10 minutes to get seated, it's not a big deal, it's small restaurant and that's how it works. The servers are fast and nice, the vegan creamy spicy ramen is great and the cauliflowers with pine-nuts are surprisingly yummy.  The only negative part I see is that the music is super loud. I get that it's a fast eating place, you sit, eat and get out so another table can get seated, but the music makes hard even a one on one conversation. But I mean, who I'm gonna lie, didn't talk that much because I was busy splurging my ramen with my face inside the bowl"}
{"text":"Amazing! Tried it for my first time four days ago and have been here three times since. Can never go back to the ramen places close to my house."}
{"text":"I got the Tokyo Tonkotsu Ramen and edamame for my appetizer. The bowl of ramen was delicious. Kinda disappointed that the edamame was too salty. I also had the chocolate mochi ice cream. Overall the service was awesome !"}
{"text":"Visited on 9/10/2014  Food: Ordered the Jinya Chicken Ramen, Jinya bun, Brussel Sprouts Tempura and Takoyaki. The ramen is very well made. Slightly better than your average ramen. The Jinya bun, which consists of Chashu Pork is so good. It literally saddens me when I finish one. The Brussel Sprouts are crispy on the outside, and nice and chewy on the inside, as a brussel sprout should be. The Takoyaki is terrific. I've only had it once before as a child in Japan, and I can honestly say that this was better.  Service: Our waiter and the cooks inside greeted us with the obligatory \"IRASHAI!\" upon entry. He welcomed us to Jinya the first time we came, and explained almost everything on the menu, including his favorites.   Decor: Very interesting layout, with booths and a community style large table in the middle. It is funny to see how us Americans require our space, as strangers will almost never sit directly next to someone."}
{"text":"This place is great.  Went there for lunch and everything we ordered was excellent..even the vegetarian Ramen.  Cool interior and service was spot on. Can't wait to go back!!!"}
{"text":"This is a nice spot to enjoy some good ramen as well as small dishes, such as Takoyaki, very good and inexpensive. Pork bun is very tasty as well!!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here exactly six times since it opened.  For a while I *thought* this was my favorite ramen bar, but I realize now that it was only because of the atmosphere - it's super alluring in here. Something about the filament bulb lighting and the massive community table that could have you sitting next to Drake or Beyoncé on any random night. Or perhaps the clean 'Less Than Zero' -esque bathrooms being textbook designs for impulsive restaurant bathroom sex and doing lines of cocaine off of the black lacquer Toto toilet tank lid. Imagine that!  Reality check, though. The food here is just not at the same level of umami as say, Ramen Sora (another LV ramen spot down the street). The kitchen food at Jinya just isn't that great. So crazy how the ambience at Jinya helps make every bite you taste seem like the most delicious version of that bite you've ever tasted. And that is worth something, but don't be tricked. Don't let the ambiance drug get 'cha.  For sure a great first-date place. The lighting will make you look like Zac Efron to your Tinder-mate. It's a sexy spot. Just don't eat too much 'cause your big performance later in the evening may be into the toilet at your Tinder-mate's apartment."}
{"text":"Best Ramen Bar in Vegas hands down!!! I had ramen at other places like Monta, Sura but nothing compares to this place. I ordered the Cha Cha Cha ramen but but wanted it spicy and they had no problem making it."}
{"text":"Stopped by last week to meet up with my homie Michael K for happy hour but wasn't too impressed. Although the HH prices are fairly cheap, like $2-3 for everything, it's not much of a discount off the original price so it's not really worth going out of your way to make it on time. For example the Jinya bun is $3.80 but during HH it's 3 bucks. Crispy chicken is usually $5 but during HH it's 3 bucks as well. Anyways, HH is daily from 3 to 5 PM.  Didn't get ramen on this visit because it was still early for dinner and we wanted to take full advantage of the happy hour specials. Plus, I was a little turned off by their ramen pricing which seemed a little steep for what seems like a standard sized bowl. I ordered a Jinya bun and crispy chicken which is basically karage. The Jinya bun was surprisingly delicious and I loved how tender and flavorful the meat is. The crispy chicken is a 5 piece order which makes it a killer deal for 3 bucks during HH; tastes similar to karage I've had at any other ramen joint. I tried some of Michael's tempura fried brussel sprouts but they aren't for me, probably because I'm not a big brussel sprouts eater...I'm sure it's a taste that I just haven't acquired.  The service was pretty decent although I felt like they came by our table way too often to try to pick up empty plates practically as soon as we were done with the item and to ask if we needed water refills. Seriously, no one drinks water that fast so chill!"}
{"text":"Ramen noodles were ok, didn't care for them blasting music so loud that we had to shout at each other."}
{"text":"Two bao buns, a mimosa, and a bowl of the tonkotsu assari...Jinya stole my heart this time around! The first time I came here I had ramen with thin noodles in the tonkotsu black (I think that's what it was called) and it was okay but not great. I now know that the tonkotsu assari aka Jinya #3 with thick noodles is the way to go. We came during happy hour, and if you do too, please order those bao buns. You'll thank me later. $3 bites of deliciousness.   The broth here is sublime and our server was awesome. I also like that they have a veggie broth for my friend's pork/beef allergy. Five stars for Jinya!"}
{"text":"I ordered the Cha Cha Cha based on the many Yelp photos and for my own love of garlic.  The heaping bowl full of ramen is served in a very rich, thick and heavy broth.  You can taste the intense garlic flavour infused into the different layers of the flavourful broth, which is accompanied by thick ramen noodles.  Each strand was nicely coated by the thick broth.  I loved the thick ramen noodles, as it had the bouncy and chewy texture you would expect from a good ramen bar. If you didn't think there was enough garlic in the broth, the server also brought over a whole jar full of fresh garlic cloves and a garlic press that you can add to your ramen.   The Ajitsuke Tamago (marinated soft boiled egg) was also cooked nicely and was included as a whole egg in the bowl of noodles. You'll also find four thick cut slices of pork chasu swimming along with the bean sprouts and minced onion. The bowl was huge and will surely satisfy those with a hearty appetite. If only I had known how large the bowl of ramen was, I probably wouldn't have made my order into a combo by adding the crispy chicken (3 huge pieces) and a salad for an additional $4.75.  The crispy chicken which is essentially chicken karaage was so tender and bursting with juices.  It was well seasoned and could be eaten on it's own as a main dish.  I also ordered the Iced Yuzu drink for $2.00  (one of the bargain items) which comes in a tall 20oz glass.    Jinya falls under the pricier side of ramen bars in the city, but I suppose they make up for it by the size of the serving.  The bowl of ramen can potentially cost a small fortune if you decide to add additional toppings which start at $0.50 to $2.00. The servers were all very friendly and provided a welcoming environment and were quick to help explain any menu questions.   I will most likely return as Jinya has one of the tastiest broths of all the ramen joints I've been to and I'm also looking forward to trying their signature dish- the Spicy Chicken Ramen."}
{"text":"I probably shouldn't go looking for a restaurant when I am hungry but I did.  I was meet with a long line of people that extended out of restaurant.  I was about 10th on the waitlist but only single person party.  The restaurant does not have enough waiting area for people on the wait list and they will skip you if they call your name 3 times and no reply.  This restaurants looks like a normal Japanese Ramen place but there are few quirky things about this place.  One is that there is only a small ramen bar area big enough for 5 people (usually reserved for single patrons in most places but not here).  The menu looked decent enough and food looked good and had recommendations for people new to Ramen.  I ordered the number 1 most popular ramen (for garlic lovers) and a gyoza/salad set.  After I ordered, I looked at the condiments and found a ramen seasoning that looked like Guam Finadene sauce.  I asked the waitress what is was and she said that it was Guam Sauce.  I thought this was weird and also thought that it was weird when they brought out a garlic press with garlic out so I could press as much garlic as I wanted into the ramen.  I figured it was safer if the customer added their own garlic so they can't be blamed for too much inside.  I love garlic so I added a lot.  The ramen was ok, kind of small and the garlic did add good flavor to the soup but the thick noodles were nothing special to me.  Also the gyoza was completely crap.  It was tiny and overcooked to a crisp.  The waitress forgot my salad and then brought me salad with goma (sesame) dressing which was good if it wasn't drowning in dressing.  Waitresses were cute but this place is not worth the wait if you have to wait and it is nothing special if you have eaten good ramen before.  Also don't waste time with the gyoza because mine sucked."}
{"text":"I solely opened an account to advise everyone of my experience at Jinya Ramen Bar. I was very excited to try this place out, as I have heard it was one of the best places to get ramen. It was a cute place when we sat down, but nothing infuriated me more than this: on my last bite of ramen I choked on what I thought was a sharp leaf. It came out to be a PIECE OF METAL. It was about an inch long and cylinder shaped. I was unbelievably shocked, scared, and embarrassed. I could have died; even the server agreed so! When we asked to see the GM, they did not even address us directly, but somebody else that worked there did. Our meal was, of course, comp'ed. As for the piece of metal, we were told that it was probably from a cleaning brush they regularly use to clean the ramen bowls with. I wish I hadn't have given the piece of metal up so promptly and took a picture first. This was completely unacceptable and easily life threatening. If something does not change there, someone could end up dying."}
{"text":"I've been here so many times and always leave happy. My fave is Jinya tonkotsu black. Their takoyaki is to die for and the shrimp ball is great too What I love about this restaurant is they have chicken broth instead pork broth so that I can bring anyone to this place and still eat ramen.   Service is good, everyone is paying attention to the customer.  I will definitely keep coming back."}
{"text":"Hands down, this is my go-to ramen place for any situation!  I usually go with JINYA No. 1 and ask for it to be super spicy.  The noodles are consistently cooked to a delicious texture.  And the soup.  The soup is so good!  It's we'll seasoned and so hearty.  Every now and then, I will mix things up and order one of their seasonal ramens.  It's either hit or miss with these, so talk to the server and see if your choice is right for you.  That brings me to my next point!  The service here is so friendly and accommodating!   If you're looking for great soup, great service, and great ambiance, then head on over to JINYA Ramen Bar.  The exterior might make you think it's not going to be top notch, but the interior is super trendy and modern!  Give it a try!"}
{"text":"This place was wonderful, the service was excellent they didn't miss a beat. Very courteous and attentive the service alone was impressive. Food was excellent too I'm definitely going back."}
{"text":"I just have to say that this certainly isn't the Ramen most of us grew up eating in our dorm room. Lol. I'm not even 100% sure what I ate as I was hungover and my amaizing girl brought me take-away. It was phenomenal, full of spice, heat and flavor. Incredible soup with just the rite balance between veg & meat. Mine was pork and it was delicious. I highly recommend this for anyone wanting to break away from the same old, same old.(Pho or Wor Won Ton)"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite Ramen spots in Las Vegas, the staff is amazing and attentive to detail. I've been going to this location for the last year and the food and the service is awesome. I have to do a shout out to one of the hostesses there, her name is Richelle, and she goes above and beyond everyone in making sure people are comfortable while they wait for seating. She's also very attentive to what's going on at the tables and makes sure the guests are treated right!"}
{"text":"I am a picky eater, especially when it comes to Ramen. My standard was Monta on eastern. I heard this place was good and decided to give it a try on my lunch break one day. I sat at the bar and the service was very fast. The server was kind enough to give suggestions and answered any questions I had. I tried the spicy Chicken Ramen and added corn. It was absolutely delicious and now Jinya is my favorite ramen place in town. It is a bit of a trek from my house, but totally worth it."}
{"text":"I came to Jinya because I've heard so much hype about it and I had to check it out! So I went to check it out and the wait was about 15 minutes. We had a couple groups in front of us which made me more excited to try the food. When we were seated a male popped out of a corner and asked us if we would like water and at first I didn't realize he was an employee because of how he just popped up randomly. He was very kind though. I ordered the Kara Men and it was so good!!! But it stopped being good when I found a hair in it! I was very upset about it and lost my appetite to continue. I also had a Pork Chashu bowl so I just continued to eat that which was really good. Overall the food and service was good but I was just upset about the hair."}
{"text":"Not a big fan for ramen but I'd definitely go here for ramen. The place is nice and the food is great! I'd definitely go back for the Gyoza since it was d'lish.   The atmosphere was really cool. A good thing is that it opens late; but that also means that it's very crowded at night. Still highly recommended tho. Love the motto \"no ramen no life\" LOL"}
{"text":"Plenty of seating in a hip, mood-setting restaurant. But don't be fooled, this isn't some limited menu fancy ramen. They do a ton of recipes here. Even the tonkotsu varies. I'm interested in trying the other broths despite loving what we got this time around. I think people will also be pleasantly surprised by the selection of appetizers. I have my eye on the takoyaki. Also enjoyed the excellent service. We must have come after the rush because everyone was pepped up but not many tables were full. This is what we enjoyed:  Tonkotsu Black: buttery oily broth, thinner noodles al dente/perfect, chashu with melty slippery fat, uncut marinated boiled egg (wish it was softer yolk, but still good taste), a couple nori sheets, just the right amount of garlic oil, green onions, crunchy onions (so savory), and a tiny dallop of chili paste. This was great. Spicy crazed folks may enjoy adding the chili paste to it, which is at every table.  Tokyo Tonkotsu (Special): chunky savory broth was very good- had onion chunks, but toward the end tasted very salty, same chashu-egg-nori-green onions, and bonito flakes. This one tasted much better than the black, but was also insanely savory. No need for any additional condiments.  Overall we were very happy with our visit and look forward to trying everything on the menu. I suggest making a special trip to try this spot."}
{"text":"Best ramen I've ever had! Couldn't say enough things about this place! Authentic broth with perfect chew and cook to the noodles. Friendly staff and the crispy rice with tuna was great!"}
{"text":"This is my current favorite ramen restaurant. The employees are friendly and have come to remember us each time we come. They have a fairly wide variety of choices when it comes to ramen which is great because I tend to enjoy thin noodles whereas my fiancé likes thick. The sides are also delicious. The steamed buns are light but meaty.   I am sad that their lunch special is gone. It was a wonderful deal for a smaller portion of ramen, rice bowl, gyoza and dessert. It lured me in, got me hooked and jonesing for a ramen fix."}
{"text":"First impression: smelly and uncomfortable. We ordered two ramen bowls with two salads, a California roll, and chashu bowl. The salad dressing and the chashu bowl was salty and the ramen was bland and tasted like chicken broth straight from the box. The side of one of our bowls were not at all clean. Also one of the eggs in our ramen still had the shell attached to it. At first, the California tasted fine but then In the middle of the roll (which should be the best part) the avocado tasted strange. The service was nothing special. Overall, I don't understand the rave about this place. There was nothing that stands out especially compared to places such as Sora and Monta. Never again. What a waste of money. ( The restroom was very nice though )"}
{"text":"Terrible customer service from the host. Had us waiting for 40 mins, so we decided to go to a nearby bar. We called him them 30 mins later, they said that there is another 20-25 wait; so we came back at the 20min mark, they had probably called our name right before we showed up. The front desk hostess said that she is putting our name to the bottom of the list. Either estimate better or invest in the technology that texts people when their table is close to being ready or hosts with better customer service.  Update: decided to wait and two different customers walked in within the additional 20min wait, as the host moved us to the bottom of the line, and apparently the host called their names too so they were recommended  to go to the buttom of the line as well. Seems like a recurring problem."}
{"text":"I had the Tokyo Tonkotsu Special, Pork Gyoza, crispy chicken, and the Brussels Sprout tempura. The broth was thicker and more savory that Monta which is my favorite place in town. The pork wasn't as flavorful and good. The gyoza was very well done, very juicy but were very vegetable heavy which is good /for me/ but some may prefer theirs more on the pork side. The sprouts tempura was good but maybe a little undercooked. The Crispy chicken was good but nothing about it really stood out for me  All in all I wouldn't say it's /the/ best but it's /one of the/ best places for Ramen in town. it's also bigger than some of the really tiny places so hopefully the wait won't get bad.  I will frequent this place"}
{"text":"This was our first time to this restaurant.  It is over priced and the portions are small for what you get!! $33 for two soup orders... thought wow must be good sizes but WRONG and when I got home and opened my order they forgot the bean sprouts!!  I won't go back!"}
{"text":"Igi was the best! Really took care of us! Totally reccomend the salmon tacos the food is the bomb"}
{"text":"I am going to give this place a 5 star. Not only is the food really good but this has to be one of the most inexpensive restaurants I have been to in Vegas. The prices are really great."}
{"text":"Did some one say J-j-j-jinya?? ..well okay, because it wasn't me.  I've tried really hard to love this place, really I have, but I just can't find the heart to. Seating is always easy to find, out of the 7 times I've been, I don't think I've ever once had to wait for an open seat.  Food is slightly pricier than Monta but you compensate for a little bit larger quantity. Most of the popular appetizer favorites are also constantly present on their ever changing menu as well, like their: takoyaki, chicken karaage, or edamame, with some occasional new ones like the pig ears, and shrimp ball.  I've had their miso, tonkatsu, and even experimented with their new garlic \"cha cha cha\" ramen, but it only left me wanting to \"cha cha cha\" out their door unfortunately. Their cha cha cha was overpowering in onion flavor and drowned out anything else that was even present in the broth. As for their miso and tonkatsu, on the times I've returned it left me thinking the ramen was mediocre at best resulting in either a slightly more bland flavor or more over powering feel, but never a decent balance. I haven't really been having good consistency here..  Don't get me wrong, jinya isn't a bad place to grab a bowl of ramen, but for my own tastes I prefer other places, especial since when I'm grabbing ramen, its because it's my cheap college student budget go to meal."}
{"text":"The atmosphere at Jinya is awesome. Dim lighting, modern wooden booths/tables, and fast service! They are reasonably priced from 10-12$, and you also have the option of adding items to your ramen! My favorite dish is the wonton chicken soup, as well as the vegetarian soup! Both come with thin noodles and you can pick your range of spiciness. I prefer spicy, but if you are hesitant start with mild. Overall, I have never left here un-satisfied, the best ramen in town in my opinion!   The only downfall is there is sometimes a wait, but it is definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"Went tonight for the first time.... we got two of the signature dishes plus the chicken appetizer... the chicken was dark meat and was way to greasy... it was not appetizing at all!!! I had the sprouting up ramen with pork and he had the spicy chicken ramen.... funny thing was they were two completely different dishes that tasted the same my husband said... I didn't eat more then two bites of mine and the waitress did not even ask why I didn't eat it!!..  it was hot out and wanted cold iced tea.... I had to ask 3 different people 3 different times for ice.... I finally had to stop someone and say please please... ice!! My iced tea never had ice!!!!!  Service was very disappointing all around.... next time I will just get the 4 for $1.00 package of ramen at the supermarket. Extremely disappointed"}
{"text":"Came here last night after a party at McFaddens. One star deducted because as soon as I walked in with my fiance, the hostess was too busy socializing with another employee. When she was finally done talking, she made it seem like her tickets were a priority and didn't even acknowledge nor greet us. Another star deducted, which I hope won't happen the next time we visit, is that our server (who was very enthusiastic and super friendly) was not attentive to us as soon as he brought our food. We didn't see him after that. We got the check from the busperson and even that took a while because there was only one server and one busperson.  Other than that, the food is awesome! I ordered the Takoyaki and Cha Cha Cha (with tofu and nori seaweed, which was put on a separate plate). I'm a huge fan of takoyaki and it's hard to find a place that has it but I'm glad I found this spot! I'll be ordering this every time I visit. The cha cha cha was really good as well but I don't know why I expected the tofu to be cooked like Agedashi tofu. The broth was super, the thick ramen noodles were super, and the portions are pretty generous.  My fiance ordered the Pork Chashu Bowl and Salmon Tacos. He obviously liked it since he wiped his bowl and plate clean. Overall, this place is a great late-night option and I'm willing to try this place out again especially since I love the Takoyaki here."}
{"text":"Has great variety of ramen. The spicy chicken ramen is my favorite! I like their menu that you could add tons of different things to your ramen and you get to choose how spicy you want your ramen. If you're like me who likes average-spiced foods, don't go with mild bc it isn't spicy at all. Go with the spicy or the next one. Although I find this place tight and noisy."}
{"text":"I'm giving this 2 stars only because the ramen was good however, this place is expensive for what you get. I've been to MANY different ramen places in and around the city and this one barely makes top 5 on my list... so why so expensive? The bowls of ramen compared to other places I've been to are slightly smaller and also slightly more expensive than other restaurants. What really upset me was that the side of bamboo shoots my boyfriend and I ordered were a measly 4 tiny pieces which was a complete rip off. I told the server this (he was actually really nice) and he said there's nothing they can do because all of the Jinya restaurants use the same quantities/pricing. The spicy miso ramen bowl I had was $14.25 and this did not count a seasoned egg or any other topping.   Overall, I was really disappointed in this place. The ramen was good, the service good however I was really rubbed the wrong way with the way things are priced. For what you get it's truly not worth it. There are far better, more reasonably priced ramen restaurants out there."}
{"text":"I've tried all of the \"big\" ramen places here in Vegas and no one can ever compare to Jinya. Never a bad experience here!"}
{"text":"I love this place. I come here everytime I come here. I also frequent their LA locations. I've been here several times. The hostess was very careless being we were on a bit of a time constraint. He told us 20-25 minutes. We came back in the time frame he have us and told us we had to wait another 25 minutes. I am fresh off a plane and hungry beyond belief. They took several tables in front of us and took ages bussing to seat us.Very disappointing. It's been an hour man and then some. Piss poor customer service. What happened?"}
{"text":"Such a cool spot to grab a late night meal away from the havoc of the strip but close enough to Uber to! The servers were gregarious and seemed happy to be working there which makes you feel good about your dining choice! We enjoyed the Seaweed Salad and two Pork Dumpling to start which were delicious... The waitress helped us out w our Ramen decisions so we could enjoy a lighter Chicken version that was one of the chef specials and the more classic Pork version which is a greasy salt bomb, but in the best possible way!  Forcing ourselves to give up the challenge of slurping up each and every last noodle about 3/4th of the way through was the only way to avoid going into food coma so we could still enjoy the rest of our evening!  The portions were abundant and the flavors were delectable!!! Would recommend to any seasoned Ramen goers and newbies alike... Compliments to the kitchen and friendly staff!"}
{"text":"Forever eating and Jinya, always find myself here after a night out on the town! I love the food, the service is always great and quick."}
{"text":"A good place to go late at night.  It's not as roomy as other places so expect a short wait for a table. This visit, for openers, tried their poke salad on fried wontons... I really liked it. Their quinoa salad was also good. Had their Cha Cha Cha Ramen. The broth was thicker, so we're the ramen noodles. The broth was perfectly seasoned, I added some garlic to kick it up a notch. It was pretty delicious.  Again I would recommend it."}
{"text":"Best ramen and the servers are over the top friendly ! I will definitely return for more ramen.  Make sure you order either the wings or the potstickers with your ramen . You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"For my bowl of ramen, I ordered the Spicy Chicken Ramen.  It was a bowl of thin ramen noodles with chicken broth, chicken chashu, spinach, spicy bean sprouts, tokyo negi, and green onion.  Usually I order the pork version of ramen at ramen bars, but this Spicy Chicken Ramen definitely spoke out to me.  You can choose either the spice level of Mild, Spicy, or Hot.  I chose the Mild one even though looking back, it would have been nice to try their Spicy level."}
{"text":"I hate leaving reviews with complaints, I seldom do. This was a hard one for me because this used to be my favorite spot! Came in here late night after craving it all day, was super excited! Waited about 30 minutes as usual because the food is usually awesome! So I don't mind waiting. Ordered my usual spicy chicken ramen with an egg and butter, extra onion. Well when my food comes, it was luke-warm :( I'm not one to send food back in a restaurant, EVER. It's not like I had the chance to anyway because they were too busy to even come check on our table and see how our food was or if we even needed anything. I definitely won't be going back to jinya for a while. They're so damn busy all the time that they lack customer service.  it's too bad because the food really does taste bomb!"}
{"text":"Jinya's Sprouting Ramen was surprisingly satisfying.   TL;DR conclusions:   Pros: * Brussels sprouts are key to the Sprouting Ramen and they're an amazing addition! They add great texture and earthiness.  * The broth of the Sprouting Ramen is rich without being too salty or heavy  * Noodles have a nice dense texture * Servers are extremely friendly  * Their pints of beer seem larger  * Lots of seating  * Huge portion sizes!  Cons: * The broth of the Sukiyaki Ramen is heavy with oil and fat. It was hard for either of us to stomach it.  * The fried chicken is average and has no unique character to it. I would only purchase this during Happy Hour.  * A non-tonkotsu shoyu broth doesn't exist here  Overall, Jinya's Sprouting Ramen is impressive and has become one of my top picks for ramen when I'm feeling peckish around Eaton Centre."}
{"text":"Again, I came here based off of the raving reviews from other Yelpers but it was just average to me. For some reason I had imagined the restaurant to be a lot larger but it was fairly small. Staff was welcoming, and the place was a lot busier than I had expected for a Thursday night. It's at the corner of Church and Carlton so it's a super convenient location for Ryerson kids. Sat at the large table in the centre of the restaurant with five of my friends and it had coat hooks underneath (good thinking guys).   I ordered the Chef's Special which was very tasty indeed, but it wasn't THAT outstanding. My friends however, all loved the ramen here. Food service was really quick and our waiter even split the bill for us without us asking. For me, I think I'll stick to my other go-to ramen places (Sansotei holds a special place in my heart) since it was pricier than average, but it was a nice first experience. For anyone who loves ramen as much as I do, check this place out! They have daily drink specials too (Sapporo Wednesdays mmm)."}
{"text":"Good , almost 5 star good but then not. I ordered the Tokyo Ramen as a combo with California roll and salad. Pig Ear Chicharron was on the happy hour menu for $5 so I wanted to try it.  To say first I m alone , my experience is that most servers are not too thrilled about it, it took them a couple minutes to acknowledge me but then she was friendly. I got the salad that was ok nothing special. The California roll was really good , real crab and not freezing cold. The Chicharron was interesting, served on crispy kale that was very salty was the pig ear, don't really know if fried or how it really was prepared but it was flavorful and strange in a good way. The Ramen was very tasty, as for the broth the rest was nothing special kind of weird , smooth pork and the same leaves that I had in the salad? What's up with that?? Well the food was good , the service ok and the blasting music not my thing to eat a soup to."}
{"text":"Instant ramen is the best-selling item at the Rikers prison commissary, outselling coffee, candy, and Coke.  You won't find instant ramen at Jinya Ramen Bar, but you will find a bunch of great options to eat. In fact, I'm tempted to give Jinya 5 stars for having so many really good items...but in the end I'm not sure that any one thing they do is my actual favorite. I love their Premium Tonkotsu White Ramen--a blend of pork & chicken broth with pork chashu, kikurage, green onion, seasoned egg, and a little fried onion. I always get it with their thick noodles, make it spicy and add some fresh garlic. The broth has such a lovely consistency and feel as it coats your mouth and invites you to lick your lips.  While the  Premium Tonkotsu White Ramen is my favorite, there are several other items that are better than the usual items you find at ramen shops, such as: Chicken Chashu Pork Bun Pork Gyoza  I also really liked the Tonkotsu Black Ramen. It is a more traditional pork broth and comes with garlic chips and garlic oil, both of which add a nice depth to the already flavorful broth.  I have also tried their Spicy Chicken and Vegetable Soup Ramens.  Both are good, but not what I'm typically looking for when I head to a ramen shop. Besides, Jinya specializes in Tonkotsu and Tokyo styles of ramen...so I'm not sure I see the merit in venturing away from what they do best.  The brussel sprouts are a miss for me. They are heavy and don't do anything good to promote tempura or brussel sprouts.  You can also get pretty carried away customizing your ramen in a lot of beautiful ways here, so take advantage of the opportunity...maybe add some greens to your diet!"}
{"text":"So authentic. Just like they make in Tokyo. Love this spot and it's conveniently open late!"}
{"text":"Great food. But sooo busy. Feels like the staff wants to get rid of you as fast as possible."}
{"text":"I thought the ramen was very flavorful here..definitely would come back.  It was a hipster feel ramen place.  I got the pork ramen (black) and a side of curry rice.  We also got the Brussel Sprouts tempura which was very good..didn't have that after taste  which was great."}
{"text":"Hate to love or love to hate? I've checked into this place six times. What keeps me coming back? You and I would both like to know. Pros: it stays open into the late hours for your necessitated 2am ramen fix (no judgement here). the menu offers more than soup and noodles, must try the jinya bun! the whole place is photogenic. everyone there is super friendly and inviting. there are monthly specials which keep things interesting and fun. there's a drive-thru though last time I checked its been boarded up. Cons: I find the broths just okay. i'm not saying i want things done for me but i shouldn't have to concoct my own flavor creations because the flavors just aren't there. but of course, for my 7th check-in, i'll be back."}
{"text":"Popular little Ramen place with a wait most nights.  We happened to go on Valentine's Day so the wait was especially long, but not bad at 30 minutes or so.  It is a small building, which is part of the problem.  The food is worth it however, and the service is very good.  They greet you in Japanese when they seat you.  We had ramen and pork buns for apps.  Super duper good! :)"}
{"text":"I'm a little disappointed because I had high hopes for Jinya. I came here to eat with my family on a Sunday at 12pm. The restaurant was busy and we had to wait about 20 minutes which was fine. Our waitress was very sweet and I liked the menu however the food was not impressive. Parts of my food were very cold and other parts were warm. For example, the seasoned egg in my ramen soup was cold on the inside. How does that happen? My family didn't really care for the ramen because the broth was very, very thick and too rich for their taste. I thought it was okay but I do agree that it was very thick. So if you like thick ramen broth this may be a place for you! However I don't think there is an excuse for ramen broth being luke warm and for the eggs and noodles being cold."}
{"text":"Been to about 4 ramen bars in Vegas so far. This one's the best! The ramen is GREAT! So flavorful and lots of varieties. Good prices too. Tip: get the Sprouting Up Ramen and add two small spoons of seasoning and spicy sauce to your bowl. And add more meat of your choosing. Soooo yummy!!! Spicy Chicken ramen is also good, but I think the Sprouting Up was better.  :)"}
{"text":"It just a small Japanese bar in dt Toronto. The lunch time was busy. Although it's a ramen bar, I don't think the ramen is good. I think the ramen is a little bit greasy. We ordered the ramen and some snacks. I think snacks are much better than the staple food ramen. The most delicious one I tried is takoyaki!!!!  I think the takoyaki there is the best one I have ever tried. It's delicate and delicious. If you go to this bar, takoyaki would be a must try item for you!!!!Each takoyaki with a toothpick and the sauce is much better than other places. More importantly, it's very cheap!!!!! Only $7 for 6. I am a crazy fan of takoyaki!!!! The takoyaki here is the best one I think in Toronto. They are so amazing!"}
{"text":"Swung by on the recommendation of a co-worker for a late night dinner with the wife.  We were both in the mood for ramen and had initially went to another ramen bar (our favorite) but the line was too long.  Made it here where their line was not as long.  After a relatively short wait we were seated.  The ambience was excellent.  Plenty of room for such a small venue and very clean.  They were quite busy for a Tuesday night but our server was prompt and quaint.  We both ordered the Tonkotsu Spicy bowl (I ordered my usual side of Kim Chee).  Very tasty.  Spoke with the manager after listening to her handle a guest who complained about the noodles (which I found annoying).  She was gracious during their exchange and I let her know that she did well not to lose her cool.  All in all I'll probably be paying future visits in the near future."}
{"text":"He low rating os more for the service then the actual food. I've been a long time lover of this place. Less then a year ago i gave this place a high rating, i'm not sure if its new management or if they just have been having some off days. Ramen is not as good as it use to be. But besides that it's decent. After work we usually eat here, or phó. But last night we chose Jinya. I ordered the cilantro one with thick noodles. When I received my bowl I noticed it had thin noodles. Ok,  easy fix right? I got the attention of a server passing by and let her know I asked for thick noodles. She took my bowl back to the pass and after talking over my bowl with the young lady who toll my order. She brings my bowl back and says \"the supervisor said she took your order and you didn't order thick\" . So now I'm stumped.  The supervisor walks over and says \"you didn't order thick noodles\". I reminded her that I did. She said she couldn't remake it but they could give me thick noodles on the side. I wasn't in the mood for double noodles. So I just declined the offer and took my bowl as is. (After it was passed around). It's after work and I was hungry. I'm 7 months pregnant and was craving a bowl of ramen with thick noodles. We were finishing our meal she comes back to apologise and offers me a free ice cream.  Because ice cream covers all mistakes. I said no thank you. She comes back with a pre plated dessert and again said \"I'm sorry you are upset\". No She was not. She could have easily fixed and remade my bowl but she decided she didn't want to since she didn't want to admit she made a mistake. I work in the industry and was baffled by the service."}
{"text":"Wow. Just... wow. 8:15pm on a Tuesday night and I show up by myself to probably one of the best meals I've had since I can remember. I sat at the bar and got so much personal attention from the staff. My waiter was SUPER attentive, the hostess checked up on me as well, and even the chef made sure everything was OK. It made for such a pleasant experience... and I haven't even gotten to the food yet (it was A++). My waiter went over the menu with me but because of the pictures on yelp and what I had gotten at other places, and because I wasn't feeling 100% (getting over a cold), I knew about 99% of what I wanted, just had to find it on the menu. I ordered the salmon tacos, pork bun, pork gyoza, tonkatsu black ramen, and a hot green tea. Let me tell you, I was not disappointed one bit. The salmon tacos had a nice refreshing taste to them and the taco itself was the perfect shell. Tons of salmon meat as well as some nice surprises such as tomatoes and onions. The pork bun was tender, flavorful, and delicious. The pork gyoza were ever so crispy and yet delicately soft at the same time. They were flavorful and did not come with sauce (they didn't need it). The gyoza did stick a little together but came apart nicely with minimal effort. Lastly, my ramen was mildly spicy and a nice temperature. The noodles were cooked perfectly and the flavor was phenomenal. My pork pieces were surprisingly cold but my waiter checked in on me instantly after a couple bites and not two minutes later I had two fresh, hot pieces I could replace my current ones with. Boy, did that make a HUGE difference. The pork was even a bit crispy toward the end for a bit of texture (but not overly so) and still juicy. My only regret is not having finished all my food and not being able to take it with me since I was staying at a hotel without a fridge/ microwave (although it was only a 10 minute drive to the restaurant, a plus). Everything came out so quickly that I was done in probably 30 min, which was great because I had had a long day. I will abso-freakin-lutely be back and maybe next time I'll up the spice a bit :)"}
{"text":"This place is pretty good (the garlic ramen is the best) but it's very heavy. I find Ramen heavy in general but Jinya gives you a LOT of noodles. The broth is also too salty for me. The service is good and to be honest the best thing on their menu is the fried chicken, which is really juicy and crispy. The octopus balls are also very soft with large chunks of meat and a tangy sauce."}
{"text":"Tokayaki is soooo delicious servings are perfect. Friend chicken is soo good also. Soup portions are kust right and so so good. There was a line when we arrived which only means that this place is rockin. Everything was soooo good. Definitely a great place to eat"}
{"text":"One of the best ramen restaurants here in Vegas! Service is quick. It gets busy at peak hours, but I've never waited more than 30 min for a table!"}
{"text":"Jinya is a ramen chain that originated in California. The atmosphere is lively.   I ordered the Jinya Tonkotsu Black ramen which comes with pork chashu, kikurage, green onion, nori dried seaweed, seasoned egg, garlic chips, garlic oil, fried onion and spicy sauce. I though the ramen was cooked well and the soup was flavourful.   Just as I was finishing my bowl of noodles, I ordered a kaedama of noodle. Kaedama is where you keep the soup from your first bowl of ramen and order a fresh batch of noodles for $1 - which I thought was a great deal. You will definitely be full after ordering a kaedama.   I would definitely recommend a visit to Jinya if you are a ramen lover."}
{"text":"It's hard to chose between Misoya Tomi and Jenya. Jenya is the winner for me because of their seasoned eggs here. They are the best and crave them all the time! My bf and I both get spicy chicken ramen, he gets a hot(hottest level) and I get a medium(lowest level). I always substitute the chicken out for a egg, and then get additional, so two! Defiantly a good traditional ramen spot that everyone should try.... I don't recommend the cha cha cha, super fishy broth, unless you like that sort of flavor."}
{"text":"Their ramen is really good. Crispy shrimp ball is always good. But i cant stand with their line, its always pack everytime i come, no matter what time is that. At least you need to wait 30 till 60 min to get sit always their take so long to refill the water and get the check."}
{"text":"Excellent ramen, love the cha cha cha. Service is great. Only complaint is the waiting area is tiny and the cool tricked out toilet was broken :/"}
{"text":"Duuuuuuuuuuuuuuude, OMG.  I've been here twice now (definitely not enough). The first time I went was a couple months ago. I was a bit disappointed in the place because they ran out of all things chicken and I really wanted the spicy chicken noodles. Regardless, the food was still good and the staff is unbelievably friendly.  Fast forward to last Wednesday. My girlfriend and I went for a friend's birthday dinner and I finally got to order the spicy chicken ramen I wanted. IT WAS AMAZING. I'm one of those people that orders food and is full within the fist three or four bites but not this time. I ate the entire bowl and was still tempted to order more. The next day I wanted to go back. I still want to go back. The bowl was the perfect amount of spicy - I added nothing to it except fresh garlic (which is free, by the way). It's so delicious. I definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Ramen tastes a lot better than I remember the first time. Rich broth and I really enjoyed the Cha Cha Cha and Spicy Umami Ramen !"}
{"text":"Jinya, this is by far the best ramen in Vegas.  The service was amazing and they took care of us well. You can tell that customer service was a priority to them. The food came out quickly and I felt so comfortable with my friends there.   The ramen, that was slurping something gifted to us by the gods. I had the Tonkatsu Black and I was not disappointed at all. It had the perfect amount of each ingredient in every bite.   If you're a ramen lover, you'll love this place too.   As a bonus, the music is poppin' too c:"}
{"text":"The have a great lunch specials. They really took care of us here. They always make us feel welcomed. I'm glad to go to an Asian restaurant that don't let my glass run empty! Now that we are regulars I feel even more welcomed!! This is an awesome place with great specials all day long! I love recommending my friends and family here!! Thanks for the awesome service!!"}
{"text":"I like how spacious the restaurant is; quite different from the hallway for ramen joints I've been to before.   Since it was my first time here, I went with the tokyo tonkotsu ramen ($14) which was their special. The broth is thicker and on the heavier, saucier side. If you can't handle such, I'd go with my friend's option which is the Jinya Chicken. It looked a lot lighter and clearer.  Overall, this place satisfied my craving for ramen and I'd like to come back soon to try the other dishes. The service was a bit unattentive but friendly. It did get incredibly busy towards the end of our meal."}
{"text":"This place never disappoints. This is the only Ramen place I can go to with my hubby cause he doesn't eat pork. He loves the spicy chicken ramen bowl. I always get the Jinya #3 Assari. I love their thick noodles and their broth is on point.  Service is always fantastic and they play good music. Decor is modern and really nice."}
{"text":"This place is amaaaaazing!! Best ramen I've ever had. I'm a regular there and they never disappoint. Besides their ramen, all the appetizers are delicious ! I've had just about everything on the menu, my favorite is the spicy vegan ramen and my boyfriend's is the spicy chicken ramen, but they're all good. I love the lycheetini drink. And you have to have their panna cotta, it's to die for! Happy Hour is from 10:00pm-midnight"}
{"text":"This is a great ramen restaurant. The atmosphere is very comfortable. There's a large table in the middle of the dining room for large groups and communal seating, there's a bar and some tables around the edges. The music was a little loud for my taste. It was difficult to talk to anyone who wasn't sitting right next to me. The staff was very friendly and attentive. We always had full waters and the food came out extremely quickly. I ordered the creamy spicy vegan ramen and was very impressed. I'm going to ask for a spicier broth next time, but even though I wanted more heat the taste was still delicious. It was full of flavor and very creamy. There are lots of options for additional ingredients. I think I'll try adding some bamboo shoots next time. I will definitely be going back to this restaurant. I want to experiment with more ingredients and more spice. Great ramen restaurant. Did I mention that already?"}
{"text":"My personal favorite ramen in all of Las Vegas. I come here for the spicy chicken ramen, the broth is delicously creamy, which I'm so into. I usually get it mild and just add my own additional spice in that's available at the table to my liking. The takoyaki here is also really good. The restaurant itself is super ambient, dimly lit, and plays upbeat music so it has a really cool, contemporary vibe. I love that it's open pretty late, too. The service is always fantastic. Just make sure that when you come in, if there's a wait (there usually is, in the evenings at least) you not only sign in, but somehow let the host/hostess know you've added your name to the list or you could risk being overlooked. That happened a couple times before to me, unfortunately. I still give it 5 stars because I've been going here since it opened and it's always yummy."}
{"text":"Unbelievable meal tonight - amazing service, fabulous food.  Spicy chicken ramen with an egg and the thick noodles was perfection.  Tempura fried Brussels sprouts were a perfect start and who can turn down $2 panna cotta during happy hour.  We may or may not be back tomorrow"}
{"text":"Didn't think I'd like this place butttt it's pretty darn amazing! Had the spicy creamy vegan ramen and substituted the thin noodle with spinach noodle and added some spicy bean sprouts. My oh my, delicious! We also tried the crispy chicken and that was really good. Can't wait to try the rest of the menu! Just keep in mind, the place is tiny, so even for two people, you'll end up waiting awhile. But the wait is worth it ."}
{"text":"The Jinya Chicken Ramen with the big noodles and the crispy chicken. Uffff can't go wrong with that. The place is a bit small so it does get busy late at night but still a great place to eat."}
{"text":"Amazing ramen. The broth was perfect and the noodles had just the right amount of chew. I liked that you could chose thicker or thinner noodles. If you want garlic, they bring it to your table and you use a garlic press to squeeze in just the right amount. We also tried the cauliflower and green beans. A smaller portion than expected for the price, but each very tasty! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"It was a really great ramen place to end with on our trip to Vegas. I got the CHA CHA CHA which has A LOT of garlic and really thick noodles.   It as delicious but the broth became really thick really quick and almost had the consistency of garlic gravy at the end. Overall, it was great and would recommend getting there early because the line forms fast after 12:00pm!"}
{"text":"Another delicious meal. We normally come here late at night after work but we decided to try out lunch. We were not disappointed. Food was excellent. I highly suggest you ask for fresh garlic for the ramen or bowls."}
{"text":"We come here often and are never disappointed. The staff is friendly and helpful. Ambiance is like any other Asian restaurant. The music is quite loud. Hard to have a conversation and not very suiting if you have little ones with ya.  I wasn't a range noodle fan until I had it here. I am so happy they have chicken broth and chicken katsu as an option as not many other ramen do. I usually get the chicken dumpling or katsu. It's my go to dish. We have tried many of the apps on the menu and they are all tasty and satisfying. We will be back for our ramen fix."}
{"text":"this is pretty good restaurant but you wait for at least 30 minutes to an hour to get seated sadly"}
{"text":"We are already Jinya fans from the Studio City location, but even though this is a chain we felt the Las Vegas location was much better.  Nothing against Studio City, but we also have tried Mid-Wilshire location and notice slight differences with all three.  The food was delicious as always, but I noticed the Tonkotsu pork was a bit more tender and succulent at this location.  Regardless though I highly recommend this as our favorite ramen spot whenever we come across the opportunity."}
{"text":"The food was super delicious and the service was great!! The wait time is a little long but that's expected with places like this! Yummy food attracts a crowd. The waitress was super nice and explained the the menu when we had questions. The ambience was pretty chill and I liked that the kitchen was open so we could see them making the food!"}
{"text":"Loved the ambience. It is such a cool place in my opinion. My friends and I were just out of a festival and were absolutely starving. Everyone was feeling ramen and soup and we came to the right place. This stuff HIT THE SPOT! It was kind of late so my girlfriend and I shared one bowl of ramen so that we wouldn't feel stuffed going to bed. (WRONG CHOICE) We were all having a good time and then I realized my girlfriend was NOT happy. (WHY?) I ate the noodles and soup so fast cause I was so hungry that she barely had any to eat! LOL.   Eggs / Broth are the best parts of the ramen here. Many would eat the noodles and stop and leave a lot of the soup left. No one here leaves the soup... It is quality soup.   Honestly, there isn't much to say other than this was a great Ramen Bar and they had some nice dumplings here as well. I can't complain for a ramen shop that is open pretty late and it served its purpose in my life."}
{"text":"JINYA is our favorite ramen place. The broth is so flavorful! The appetizers took a little while to come out. Although I do have to say that we arrived right before the lunch rush. They got slammed pretty fast. Everyone was very nice and apologetic about the delay. They comp'd a dessert for us without us asking. Great food as always and great service."}
{"text":"I though I was suffering from ramen withdrawal when I was in Las Vegas. Having tried it again while on a full stomach and after dinner, I can claim this to be one of my favourites because of theor varieties and sophisticated broth."}
{"text":"Oh, yeah. Walked in around 10:30pm, and we were able to finally try the Creamy Vegan ramen! Damn, was it good! We added mushrooms, mmmm.  There was a bit of a wait (a little extra for an actual table instead of this communal table they've got going on), but we didn't mind. There was a super upbeat, trendy vibe that we enjoyed.  The prices weren't bad, either. And the hours were great, as we had just gotten out of a show & few places are open, nevermind with vegan options. The service was good. I really appreciated that the server knew which condiments were vegan & offered that info without us even asking.  My only only oooonly wish was that we could try more of the fried veggie appetizers due to the shared equipment thing (not vegan friendly - but I appreciate how open they are about this - it's on the menu, I think).  We will DEFINITELY be back."}
{"text":"Its okay. Just a pop ramen place but, theres no rules to ramen. Service was poor  Food is good and a good energy in the place."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! one of the best noddle places in Las Vegas. At a pretty good location as well, food is excellent, really recommend the Spicy Vegan ramen. The restaurant is just a little to small."}
{"text":"Ate here several times. Make sure to order the soup extra hot because often the broth is room temperature. The last two times I ordered here was for take out- and both times my order was messed up. I would also suggest double checking your order before leaving  Also they often have a busy signal if you're trying to order take out and when you do actually get thru- they put you on hold for ten mins.   It would be worth their money to hire another host and figure out a better phone system. They've lost my business several times because of the issue"}
{"text":"Every time we are in Vegas, we must drop by this restaurant for lunch. The ramen and pork buns are great. The service is fast. The kid menu is very generous and affordable. Your kid will get a bowl or ramen, rice dish, and dessert."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved my first experience at Jinya Ramen Bar!  My mom and I came for a somewhat early dinner and waited for about 20 minutes or so, not too bad for a Sunday evening! I put my name down on the waiting list and peaked inside the restaurant. I was surprised at the size of the place. It was actually smaller than what I expected it to be, but bigger than Monta's interior. The dining table in the middle of the restaurant reminds me of medieval times, really cool.  We were seated and greeted by our waiter. He was so friendly and since it was our first time, he explained the menu to us and even recommended a few of his favorites! He suggested the JINYA Tonkotsu Black and also said that it was one of the best sellers. Now I know why! I was already thinking about ordering the Tonkotsu Black, but his suggestion just confirmed that it's what I would be ordering. The broth was creamy, hot, rich, and full of flavor. Anyone who loves ramen knows that the broth is the most important part of the dish and Jinya definitely nailed it. The broth was also really garlicky, which I loved! It was served with the right amount of thin noodles and the toppings gave the dish the perfect texture. The kikurage is my fav!  I also ordered the Tokyo Curry Rice and house salad to pair with my bowl of ramen. After the Tokyo Curry Rice arrived to our table, I won't lie, I was a little skeptical at first. To be quite honest, it didn't look appetizing at all, but oh my god, was I wrong! Why did I not know that this stuff exists? It was packed with flavor and extremely filling on its own. I would definitely recommend this dish! The house salad was okay. It was made with arugula, which I'm not too big a fan of, but the dressing was interesting and tasted good!  As far as appetizers go, my mom ordered the gyoza and the JINYA Bun. She enjoyed both, especially the Bun. We'll have to come back and try the Crispy Shrimp Balls because that's what everyone around us seemed to be ordering!  Overall, a great bar to get your ramen fix! The service was great, our food was even better, prices are reasonable, and the atmosphere was hip! Can't wait to bring the rest of my family to Jinya and show them what it's all about!"}
{"text":"I love ramen, I mean the real ramen not the instant ramen noodles from the store. After driving almost 7 hours, this was our first stop.  I ordered the spicy tonkatsu ramen and my husband ordered the vegan ramen.   My ramen was so delicious, a very nice & rich flavorful broth, freaking good tonkatsu, melted in mouth, cooked perfectly. The other important part from a good ramen is the noodle. This noodle was perfect! Not mushy at all. The texture was  perfect, it had a body. It was nothing like instant packaged noodle at all.   My husband's ramen was delicious too, and again the broth & the noodle were perfect.   Price is cheap for a very delicious ramen, yeah especially if I compare with ramen in Reno that I had before, was nothing to compare about. This ramen has a very good quality, lots of broth so it was not like noodle bowl with less broth, this was the real ramen.   The place wasn't that busy that day, because we were there after lunch time. The restroom was clean & quite fancy toilet bowl with a picture on the wall wrote no ramen no life, pretty cool funny.   Maybe someday they will open in Reno, well I hope so, real ramen from Japanese people not just western style of ramen."}
{"text":"Jinya, whatever culinary wizardry you got going on in the kitchen, keep it up! My tastebuds thank you.   Jinya reawoken my love for ramen in Las Vegas. Granted, I've only had the chance to try Monta so far, I can quickly say that I preferred the (less saltier) ramen at Jinya. The broth was wonderfully delicate - It's not a condense, salty, ghastly rich and difficult to digest broth like Monta's. (But hey, if that's your thing? Just not for me.) I'm typically an advocate of strong, punch-you-in-the-face flavor, but something about that broth at Jinya kept me sipping and savoring the quality ingredients of the comforting broth.   I can understand that some may feel that the lighter at broth at Jinya is unfavorable. However, I have to argue that if you feel so inclined, you can always add dashes (or tablespoons) of the delicious bottled ramen seasoning and thick spicy sauce that is conveniently sitting on each table, in order to adjust the boldness of your ramen broth. You have control of customizing the flavor of your ramen? I'm down with that! Honestly, my boyfriend and I didn't go crazy with the table-side ramen seasoning - a few dashes will set it off just right. Enjoy savoring that broth, close your eyes if you need to. It's actually more wonderful than you can even imagine, when you take it all in with the perfect bite: some broth, a little bit of noodles, some seaweed, some corn (if you added it), some chashu, etc. and slurp away! It just hugs your tastebuds and your belly.   Here's what I recommend:  - Jinya Tonkotsu Black ($10.55) - 2 slices of pork chashu+ kickurage+ green onion+ nori dried seaweed+ soft boiled seasoned egg+ garlic chips+ garlic oil+ fried onion+ thin ramen noodles. Yeah. This is the broth I was talking about when I wrote my love story above. The thin ramen noodles were perfectly cooked, al dente. The soft boiled \"seasoned egg\" is ultra luscious, silky, and also cooked perfectly. All of the components in this ramen were meant to be eaten together. I truly enjoyed the delicate nuances of garlic in the broth, it was not at all pungent or artificial tasting. I also feel that the toppings I chose were perfect for this ramen-   Toppings added:  - Corn ($1) - I love corn and I love corn in ramen soups! It adds a lovely pop of texture and sweetness with each slurp of the broth. Highly recommend.  - Fresh Garlic (FREE) - They bring out a small jar of raw garlic cloves that have been soaking in water and also provide you with a metal hand garlic press. You can freshly press the garlic yourself and adjust how much garlic you want in your soup. The garlic flavor is very smooth and not aggressive, because the soaking method removes a lot of the pungent, spicy, bitterness in the plain raw garlic. It really enhanced the garlic flavor in the Tonkotsu black broth and brought the ramen to a whole notha' level. If you're are a garlic lover, I highly recommend!  - Extra Pork Chashu ($2 for 2 pieces) The chashu here is indeed buttery, but there is also a good amount of enjoyable, tender, meaty substance - unlike the flimsy fatty chashu that just disintegrates into the broth at Monta.   We also tried: - Jinya Bun ($3.80) - Daaaym! that pork belly is buu-tter-yyyy!!! That pork belly is what makes the bun unforgettable. The toppings and the sauce were on the simple/weak side, so I can't necessarily say I need to order this every time I come here. But I would definitely recommend this for first-timers to enjoy that expertly cooked, buttery pork belly.    - Takoyaki ($4.80) - Philip T. didn't joke around when he said it was one of the better versions (if not the best) takoyaki in Vegas. It came out hot, plump, juicy, and it even had cooked egg white chunks (egg salad?) in the mayo! That was totally unexpected and added such an amazing texture and unique flair to the beloved classic. Take your takoyaki ball and just run it along the plate to pick up any (and all) of the takoyaki sauce and chunky mayo sauce - sounds weird, but that's how it was meant to be eaten! The octopus inside each ball was also cooked perfectly, moist and extra tender.   Not only was all of the food we tried satisfying, I was also really diggin' the ultra sexy vibe and bossy decor here. Plus, right when we walked in, their amazing song playlist completely captured my attention. They played back-to-back-to-back jams that were right up my alley. I'll admit it - I used SoundHound the entire dinner to figure out what exactly was playing, since I needed to add it to my playlist. I can only recall 1-2 places in my entire life, where the music really set an amazing mood for dinner. I'm so happy to report that Jinya was certainly added to my list as one of those places.   I am relieved they are open late until 3 am (!!!), in Vegas it's necessary and a step above all of their competitors. They also have a ramen/ Japanese tapas drive-thru coming soon! No way? That's crazy! I can't wait until next time!"}
{"text":"Got the spicy miso ramen, gyoza, pork buns, and green tea mochi ice cream!   Everything was delicious but the only rant I have is how long we waited to be seated. We came on a weekday around 2 pm. Waited for about 30 mins WHILE THERE WERE SEATS OPEN!! If the seats were all filled I wouldn't have a problem waiting BUT there were empty tables."}
{"text":"I've had both their vegan friendly ramens and enjoyed them both. The creamy one is my favorite because i like ramen noodles better than the skinny ones the other one comes with."}
{"text":"best service ever, food tastes perfect, Love their takoyaki and Tokyo Tonkasu"}
{"text":"Service is great. Food is pretty good depending in what you get.   Their house salad, takoyaki, and JINYA bun are on point. As for their ramen, it's okay. If I go here it's not the first thing I would consider getting which is odd because it should be since this is a ramen bar. It isn't bad by any means, I just think there are a few places up the street that work that ramen magic better.   But go here for happy hour! They have their JINYA bun on HH and it's awesome. Two of those and a glass of Sapporo and you're good to go for lunch"}
{"text":"Soup is for the sick so a friend of mine took me here. It was cold in the hallway while we waited which perpetuated my problem. The food was good and the ambiance intimate. And when I say intimate I mean small af."}
{"text":"Been here several times and food is consistently great. So much flavor. Good portion and I never leave hungry. Simple spicy chicken Ramen will always cure my hunger pains.   Veggie Ramen is also very good and also loaded with flavor.    The kids meal was great because of the variety and price. For $7 you get chicken tenders, fries, salad, fruit, ramen, and dessert. I might just get this for my self next time.  My two kids split the one meal and could not finish it."}
{"text":"The service here is not good.  I ordered extras on my ramen and was charged double for the extra.  Also my waiter didn't bring me my water and didn't care if I was even there.  The front desk lady was very nice though.  Also its so dark in there like I'm at a club.  The ramen soup is too salty for me.  I had to go to the store next door to buy a gallon water to drink afterwards.  Over hyped ramen."}
{"text":"This ramen place deserves a five star review. Their food is consistently delicious and service is very fast.    I've always dined in at dinner time and I would always encounter a wait. The wait list is organized and they sit us pretty quickly. I think the longest I've ever waited was 30-40 mins on a Saturday night. I'd say it is well worth the wait though.   I really like the Tonkutsu Black and the regular tonkutsu ramen noodles. Thin noodles all the way for me. I've never had their thick noodles so I don't really know what it's like. Their mini tacos are good too; salmon and tuna. Definitely try their pork belly bun as an appetizer! You won't regret it!   Recommended A++++"}
{"text":"BEST ramen in Toronto !!!!!! I've been here multiple times and got different items on the menu and I have been beyond satisfied every single time!!! Food and service is both amazing! Staff is super nice! My fave dish is the spicy chicken ramen"}
{"text":"When I think of ramen, I think of Jinya. There's no other place that can compare in Vegas.... even the vegan ramen is good. The tonkotsu black is really delicious. I always add like 3 cups of garlic in my ramen haha (it's free)."}
{"text":"If I could, it would be 4.5 stars but since they don't have that, 4 wouldn't be good enough for this place so it deserves 5.   I've been a Monta fan for a while now. Going there at least once a week. I decided to try this place since it's new. As soon as we walked in, we were greeted by the server and running. The server names Alex immediately asked if we've been here before. We said no so she kindly explained the menu and her favorite things on there and asked if we'd like drinks. After quickly coming back with them, we ordered. She even asked us if we'd prefer getting the appetizers first or if it didn't matter if we get the ramen first. No one has ever asked that before. She showed that she really wanted us to enjoy our dinner there! She was so full of energy and looked like she really loved being there. Her alone would make me give this place a 5. I adore her.   Now to the food, the gyoza was great. An 8 piece appetizer. Cali roll was delicious too! I'm used to going to ramen places that either didn't have rolls or had really tasteless ones so I was really happy with it. The pork chashu bowl was amazing and even the small was big! They even flavored the pork before. A decent selection of beer as well. I can't remember the ramen I tried exactly but it was something black. Very good! I tried my boyfriend garlic something ramen (sorry I suck haha) and I liked that one better personally! Some of the appetizers come with salad as well!   The place is very nice looking. Dim lights and they even have a large party table in the middle!   I loved this experience. Great food and service I've never seen before. Only reason it would be 4.5 stars is it's a bit more expensive. Definitely recommend it. Found my new favorite ramen place!"}
{"text":"JINYA is a pretty spacious place compared to other ramen bars I have been to. It does get pretty crowded during peak times though so be weary of that. I would recommend limiting your party size to 4 as there aren't many tables that accommodate more than this. As for the food, the ramen has never disappointed me, with my favourite being the spicy umami miso with the thick noodles. I also love the fact that the ramen comes with a side of garlic that you can crush into your bowl! They have lots of different items on the menu and even have a really good vegetarian option too - which is not so common when it comes to ramen. The service is quick and pleasant and makes for a good experience overall."}
{"text":"Love their ramen and the staff is very friendly. The shop itself is super cute too and fairly cheap for the portion size."}
{"text":"Does Vegas need another ramen joint?  Well if the menu is different enough, why not?  I had my reservations about this place but glad I tried it anyways.   Glad I did.  The menu is less traditional than the other places in town.  I started with the karage chicken.  Flavor wise, best I've had in Vegas.   Light batter with nice seasoning and a lot of chicken flavor.   Nice to have chicken taste like chicken.  Comes with a sauce but it's great straight.   Also, had the fresh tofu, made at your table.  This was a real winner also.  Comes with 4 toppings and a ponzu sauce.  toppings were a sesame salt, green onions, scallions, bonito flakes and a citrus/ginger topping.  Any fan of tufu should like this.  The main event was the tonkatsu black for me.  Their noodles are awesome.   Al dente with a rich flavorful broth.  My friend had the the white and I also liked it. Lighter but still flavorful broth.    The wait staff was very attentive and friendly.   Only weird part was that none of the booths were open and so we had to sit at a large communal table.  Slightly awkward at first but turned out to be a fun night.  (no I didn't go into the women's bathroom).  I'll return to have some of the other offerings."}
{"text":"My review is only based on the food as I went on their soft opening day.  I like ramen.  I don't care if it's a chain or a mom and pop shop as long as it taste good.  I learned that Jinya is a chain but I've never been to their other locations so I was excited to try their version.  First glance at their menu: large selection of ramen and snacks.    Short blurb about each dish we tried: Jinya bao: thick slab of fatty pork belly tucked inside a soft, pillowy bun.  Oh it was so good.  Fatty, sinful, deliciously good.  Side salad (combo with ramen) was a standard spring mix but the dressing was very salty.  We gave feedback to the owner and he said it is a recipe from head office but will look into it.   Gyozas were housemade, dainty and flavorful.   chicken karaage were crispy, juicy and lightly fried.  The ramen: I went with the classic tonkotsu and loved how flavorful the broth was.  It had a rich pork taste but was not overly salty.  The thin noodles (my preference) was cooked perfectly and had great texture.  The soft boiled marinated egg (ajitama) was seasoned nicely with a perfectly ooey, gooey yolk. Hubby went with the spicy umami miso ramen and said he really liked it.  I did try the broth and it had some heat to it.  Desserts (panna cotta and mochi) were your standard fare but a nice way to end your meal.  We had an opportunity to chat with the owner afterwards and learned quite a bit about opening a Japanese owned chain! But from that you can expect quality control and consistent taste of their food across all their locations.  I thought their prices are pretty similar to other ramen shops in the city.  I am anxious to return to try their other ramen but will wait until the crowd dies down a bit before I haul my two kids there.  Oh check out their kids combo - spectacular value!!"}
{"text":"This place rocks. Tasty soup, flavourful broths, awesome tacos, the cauliflower dish is awesome the chicken chashu dish is awesome. My favourite soup is the Spicy Chicken Ramen   However they rarely answer the phone with is frustrating and it's always busy and always a wait."}
{"text":"Probably the best ramen in town. The food is amazing and consistent. If you want solid Japanese Ramen then this is your place. The only downside is the dining area is small so hit it during off hours or be prepared to wait.  Well worth it."}
{"text":"The food is delicious but, if there are more than 4 people in the restaurant expect to wait a MINIMUM of 45 minutes before you are given any drink and a half-hearted apology for their gross ineptitude. Beyond being verbally abused, or being poisoned I cannot imagine worse service than what has become the standard for this place. AVOID AT ALL COSTS!"}
{"text":"Took my daughter here to see if there is another ramen place that is as good as Ramen Sora or Monta... This place did not disappoint.    I had the Jinya No. 1- Tonkatsu Black. The broth was hearty and flavorful. The noodles are thin, but I think I prefer it like this. The chashu is tender and the rest of the ingredients/toppings were complimentary to the ramen soup. It had nori, kikurage, seasoned egg (nitamago), garlic chips, fried crispy onion, green onion and a little dollop of red chili pepper sauce.  It was very good.   My daughter had the Tokyo Yatai ramen. It came with a chicken and pork clear broth, chicken, chashu, bamboo shoots green leafy veggies, fried onion and nitamago. She opted to not have the shredded red peppers.  She ate as much as she could. She rarely orders ramen and her saying that this was delicious was a big deal to me. She usually opts for a small bowl of just rice and chashu.   We ordered the gyoza and Takoyaki. Gyoza were on the small side (from what I am used to), but just delicious. Takoyaki on point. I haven't had really good Takoyaki in the states except from Shirokiya at the Ala Moana mall in Oahu and my time I was in Japan for vacation.   The Takoyaki was cooked well. It had good chunks of octopus and ginger in it. The sauce they put over it and Bonito flakes were not overpowering.   The service was good and attentive.  I will be back."}
{"text":"Addicted .. The vibe is perfect too .. Open till. 3am .. Thick noodles all day.. Spicy"}
{"text":"This place is consistently delicious. I like that it is a small more intimate restaurant. Service is always friendly and right on! The only downside is that they are not open 24 hrs. Have the tempura Brussel sprouts, amazing!  Kid friendly  Reasonably priced drinks Vegan options!!!!!"}
{"text":"Food here is great!  The wait can be quite long when it gets late though.  First visit here I waited for an hour only to find out they were out of everything that I wanted!  They do have happy hour here too!  We love the ramen here."}
{"text":"Not my favorite ramen in town. Broth was a little bland. Nice selection of add ins but overall I felt it wasn't very authentic ramen. I prefer Monta but not a bad place. Staff is friendly"}
{"text":"I was so excited to try this place because of the 975 reviews, but it didn't quite do it for me. I got the Cha Cha Cha Ramen, my husband got the veggie. My ramen had a pile of raw white onions and green onions on top. Way too much onions!!! They did however get the \"katame\" correct. Broth more salty than rich. Veggie broth was not that impressive either. Brussels sprouts tempura was ok. Overall service was decent. Though the space could be a little cleaner."}
{"text":"Our appetizers, fried chicken and dumplings were good. I liked the thick ramen but didn't like the thin noodles. The pork was soft and tender. Soup base was too thick for my taste.  Service was good but we were the only ones there.  I can see when the place gets busier that the wait times could be slow.  Tea is extra...so better to order the lunch special which includes an appetizer and soft drink/tea for $2 (tea on its own is $2.50).  I'd give it 4 stars but I think at $13/ bowl of ramen the price reduces the star."}
{"text":"My favorite Ramen place! A little bit bummed that it's in Dirty Dining.. And I take those things seriously. But with Jinya....I'm coming back for more regardless (I do hope they fix it).. Yeah, it's that good."}
{"text":"I was a fan until I witnessed The employee break room , on the other side of the dumpster!!"}
{"text":"JINYA is ,or shall I say ONCE, one of my most favorite ramen places in Las Vegas. The ramen came super quick, the food was great, and the servers were really nice. But when we came back to this place a few days ago after a while, the place  really changed. Some of the servers were super unhappy and seemed almost as if they weren't pleased with anyone or ANYTHING. It bothered me and my family due to the fact their displeased looked gave a sense of unwelcoming attention.   Not to mention, the kids menu was already delicious the way it was, but for some reason, they changed the fries and it doesn't taste very good anymore. JINYA was honestly the best, but the vibe and taste of the restaurant no longer catches my appeals the way it used to."}
{"text":"Underwhelming. Service was just ok, ramen was bland (had the recommended ones). There are better places in Calgary. We went on the third day they were open so maybe they just need to smooth things out. Would try again in a couple months."}
{"text":"When there was a JINYA in Costa Mesa, CA years ago - I went there SO much, the workers started calling me Van-chan. I would like to imagine that I was one of their favorite customers. I was absolutely devastated when they closed down the Costa Mesa location. While I was in Vegas, I stayed at Palms Place and I was so close to JINYA, I knew I had to go back for that delicious tonkatsu broth that lingers to my soul!!   I came about 10 minutes after they opened and the restaurant was already half full. The place was packed by the time I was ready to order!!  I had the JINYA Tonkotsu Black ($12) which has their heavenly pork broth, thin noodles, pork cha shu, seasoned egg, garlic chips, garlic aioli, fried onion and spicy sauce. I actually asked them to make this spicy for me since I liked the ingredients in this bowl better than the Tonkotsu Spicy Ramen. I made my dish a combo (additional $4.20) for 4 piece gyoza and salad.   The person next to me ordered their combo after me but they received their salad first. I got my salad a while after and I was less than impressed. The gyozas were pretty good but definitely on the smaller side. I do not recommend the combination upgrade.   My JINYA Tonkotsu Black was almost as impressive as I remembered. The broth was PERFECT and the seasoned egg leaves my heart fluttering. The only thing that I wasn't in love with was their cha shu. Hopefully I went on an off day because the cha shu was tough and not as flavorful as I remembered.   I also splurged while I was on vacation mode for their Panna Cotta ($3.50). This is one of my all time favorite desserts and I loved the panna cotta itself but I have no clue why they threw ice cream on top of it. The sweetness of the ice cream over powered the delicate panna cotta. This panna cotta had the perfect consistency and I feel like they downgraded the product as a whole by throwing on a scoop of ice cream.   The conclusion is that you should come here for the ramen, but nothing else. Their service can really improve too. I came and ordered because the customer next to me but they gave him his identical order before I got my stuff. And also there was this annoying issue where at first they ran out of the pork broth and only had the chicken broth. By the time their tonkotsu broth was ready, the waitress came to inform the customer next to me and walked off. I had to flag her down to change my broth to the default tonkotsu broth. I would have been less than satisfied with chicken broth if the one I actually want is available."}
{"text":"I love this place!  I love the ambiance; its very lax and modern. Their food is just amazing. Their JINYA buns are ridiculously good. Their ramen is better than other ramen joints that I have tried in town. Their noodles are perfectly cooked and the broth is well seasoned. I pretty much go for the ramen and stay for the buns.haha Yay for JINYA!"}
{"text":"My oh my is Jinya growing it's franchise! When I think of Jinya, I think reliability. I can always guarantee that I'm going to enjoy the food on the menu. So when it hit Las Vegas I was really pleased, I think my mom can really enjoy this spot....  The ambiance is nice, very clean and proper. Great pork buns! Didn't really like my chicken ramen. But overall it's a good place to have ramen that you know won't fail in decency. It's not the greatest but it is FAR from terrible. I'd recommend the tonkotsu black, the pork buns, and that's about it. HA"}
{"text":"Went here for a friends birthday while we were in Vegas. One star for the atmosphere and another star for our server. No stars for the food!!!! Maybe it was because it was a Saturday night, our food was cold! I mean cold! My friends mom asked if she can have hot food and our server said \"we can microwave it for you\"... seriously I could make better ramen at home using Maruchan! The wings were decent. But the spicy chicken ramen terrible. Within the hour my boyfriend and I had diarrhea. Never again if I am ever in town again. Yuk!"}
{"text":"I see that a lot of people compare JINYA to Monta & Sora. I have yet to try Monta, but Sora is my favorite ramen restaurant in Vegas thus far.  I decided to give JINYA a try because of all of the good reviews from friends. I came on Friday night around 8pm. There were only 4 people ahead of me on the list and I only waited about 15 minutes to be seated. The hostess was really friendly and so was our server. The restaurant itself is pretty small but they seemed to get customers in and out at a pretty quickly. Every employee was extremely attentive and made sure we were satisfied with our food.  I ordered the \"Old Skool Ramen\" and subbed the thin noodles for the thick noodles. Overall I have to say that the ramen was pretty good, but I did not think that it was as good as the ramen served at Ramen Sora. The pork chashu was kind of dry, but other than that it was good.  Even though I do prefer Ramen Sora over JINYA, I will definitely come back in the future to try some of their different ramen choices."}
{"text":"I am beyond appalled by this restaurant. My boyfriend and I dined in at about 9pm last night. I ordered the spicy chicken ramen and there was a piece of HAIR stuck and wrapped around one of the wontons in the soup. I was beyond DISGUSTED. I have never experienced this at any restaurant before. The waiter did not offer to bring me a new bowl of ramen when I notified him about the disgusting matter. He instead made a joke about stating that it could've been his hair (he is a young white male with long hair). Unfortunately I do not remember his name. I was forced to pay for this unsanitary meal and the manager never came out to speak to me about the matter which is an absolute no-no. I work in hospitality myself and this has never gone on at my restaurant and if in fact there is any reason the customer is not satisfied, our manager comes out immediately to accommodate the customers needs and to express sincere apologies. This restaurant obviously does not know the meaning of hospitality and does NOT care about their customers. What a DISGUSTING establishment. For my first time trying ramen, I was horrified with this experience and all I can picture is that nasty strand of hair in my food. I am beyond traumatized and feel gross. This place needs a visit from the health department."}
{"text":"Had the Black Tonkotsu Ramen,  it was ok. Like another here has said there are better ramen places in Calgary.  I'll go back to check out other dishes."}

First walking in your hit right away with yummy smells we were seated very quickly in a corner the benches arnt big and kinda hard there just wood with no padding but not a big deal for me.....   I have NEVER ate at a ramen bar this was my very first time ever.... our server was very nice and friendly explained to me   I got the Spicy chicken mild with an added egg and spicy chicken.... no bean sprouts for me though I hate those things lol   I also got some sort of jelly drink which was a little strange but it was sweet just different lol   The noodles came out quickly and we dug right in... we had to break up the egg since it didn't come out broken up..... it was very yummy the noodles were nice and tasty cooked perfectly I was very happy about that .... it sure does warm you right up I got full fast and made me a little sleepy lol   Added bonus when I went to use the bathroom they have the cool toilets that are heated so your butt is nice and toasty lol"}
{"text":"Jinya (in Mission on 4th) takes the top spot for my favorite ramen restaurant in Calgary.  The service was really attentive (without being needy, creepy or just plain bothersome) and I HUGELY enjoyed the food...Wow!  Massive menu!!    We randomly dropped in for a post-Canada day refuel....We shared Cilantro Sashimi and Kale Tempura.  For the main, I had Spicy Tonkotsu Ramen with TRIPLE PORK!!  That's right... I added triple pork and the Jinya crew were soooo happy to accomodate this special dietary need of mine... My friend ordered the White Tonkotsu... she said it was \"Yum\".  My friend lies a lot though (compulsive or something), so I would have to try it myself before I agreed.  Wasn't the cheapest... I think two appetizers, two soups, one cocktail and one sparkling water (all in with tip) was about $82 ... still... I had a great dinner ... so worth it ..."}
{"text":"The ambiance was exquisite upon walking in. We were seated at a nice window booth and ordered the tonkatsu ramen at HOT level and ordered the Cha Cha Cha. The broths were amazing and rich. And the service was on point as well. The only slight con was the restroom was quite warm as if they don't turn the a/c on in there. However everything was a great ramen experience. 5/5"}
{"text":"I love this cute little ramen house  I came here with my girlfriend right before they closed after a crazy night out.  There was only one other party inside.  Once seated, we were pleasantly surprised that they had late night happy hour.  However, the one ramen bowl on the HH menu was out.  We went for their shrimp balls on the HH menu to start.  For my ramen, I went with their Jinya Chicken with added corn and spinach noodles instead.  The Jinya Chicken consisted of chicken broth instead of pork base.  It also had bean sprouts, green onions, chili, spinach, and chicken.  I also asked for some black garlic oil on the side.  It was still a little bland so I added some of their gyoza sauce to give it more flavor.  I wish they had vinegar instead.  It was very good and super filling.  As for the shrimp balls, we had ask the waitress how big they were.  They were a LOT bigger than what she told us.  They were good though.  Extra crispy on the outside and filled with lots of delicious shrimp pieces inside.  It came served on a spicy mayo sauce.  We couldn't finish them.    Our total was about $25.  I thought pricing was very cheap and reasonable.  The bowls all run about $11 each and any additional add-ons, such as corn, is another $1.  The service was excellent.  The girl waiting on us was very bubbly, sweet, and knowledgeable.  The food came out fast.  The inside of the restaurant is small but cute.  It has an urban vibe, which I like.  Overall, it's a solid ramen house that I would come back to."}
{"text":"Giving 4 stars instead of 5 because of the server, she was cold, i felt rushed and you could tell she hated her job...  That being said, the food was phenomenal! Best ramen I have ever had I will be back!"}
{"text":"Very good ramen and great for hangovers! Make sure you bring your hunger!"}
{"text":"Although the ramen was good, when I went to finish the leftovers I brought home there were two fruit flies in it! I did notice once I was seated that there were a few fruit flies that we were attempting to swat away, but didn't think anything of it. Again, good ramen. Hold the flies."}
{"text":"After eating here 4-5 times I can only give it 5 stars. Best Ramen in Las Vegas so far!"}
{"text":"Food is delicious! The atmosphere is awesome as well. We had to wait for 15-20 min before getting seated. Had the pork ramen. Added some extra fresh garlic and ground pork. It was so satisfying!!  The chicken curry was equally flavorful. Would recommend it to others."}
{"text":"We were looking for some late night noodles and found this gem a bit off the strip. The place was hopping with good music and a great look to it. We only had a 10 minute wait but since it was 1am on a Sunday night. I imagine it's much busier at peak times. Our server was Britney and she gave us excellent recommendations especially since some menu items we were interested in weren't available which was kind of a bummer but we were happy with what we ordered. She was friendly and fun. The tempura Brussels sprouts were amazing as was the skinny noodle ramen. We also or the dynamite with shrimp scallops and mushrooms, the shrimp cheese balls, the baby leaf salad and a veggie roll. All fresh and melt in your mouth flavors.  All that along with nigori  sake and some killer beer and out bill was $66. We found out there are two more in the LA area and will be making the trip to visit those since they are closer to home."}
{"text":"They need to hire more people here, service was not that great and portions were pretty sad but they were very generous on the salt.  I ordered the following:  Wonton Chicken Ramen ($10): It had wonton, spinach, green onion with thin noodles.  The wonton wrapper was very thick, the noodles were really starchy.    Spicy Tonkotsu Ramen ($11): It had chicken, bean sprouts and I just remembered it being way too salty.   I won't be going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"First time having ramen here with my boyfriend. It has an upbeat and modern ambience and the food was amazing. We ordered the jinya no. 1, premium tonkotsu white, jinya bun and crispy chicken. Everything was very good especially the jinya bun. The chashu pork was melt in your mouth! I definitely recommend getting it for your appetizer."}
{"text":"SPICY CREAMY VEGAN RAMEN (no tofu) I'm obsessed. This place is delicious and always serves up the most perfect bowl of ramen. I go here way too much. I love the ramen and the employees are so nice too. Even if you're not vegan, try the spicy creamy vegan, it's BEYOND AMAZING!!!!"}
{"text":"I will never go back until manager fired.  Seems to be an unmedicated bi polar based on interactions.  Watched her freak out on a server for something that appeared to be not his fault.  Was a regular but all original staff have been fired or quit I am told and new staff not up to speed yet.  Only a couple months old but needs a \"Gordon Ramsey\" makeover! Foods good though.  Just be prepared for the unexpected."}
{"text":"Me and the boy went nuts at this place!!!  So glad it opened so close to the Vegas homestead and so glad it is open until 3am.  This is a very hip place to dine in the wee hours with very patient and helpful service along with some very fantastic food! I swear we ordered one of everything on the menu.  The pork bun was a perfect little size with deliciously fatty pork tucked inside.  The brussel sprouts were hot and satisfying and the ramen was so good that I couldn't get it in my face fast enough. I am pretty sure which any way you order your ramen, it is going to come out awesome. This place is kinda of small but the service is swift so there usually is one table available."}
{"text":"The overall experience was awesome. Even though the restaraunt was completely packed, service was still outstanding. Our order was taken once we were sat and the food came out rather fast. Everything from the appetizers to the main course was delicious!"}
{"text":"I got the tonkotsu spicy pork ramen. It had a great broth. I find it difficult to find soups of this caliber.  My friend got the cha cha garlic lovers bowl. It was really yummy too. Definitely coming back"}
{"text":"Although this place isn't terribly bad, it's definitely not the place to go if you want a solid bowl of authentic ramen. Good portions, decent taste, but it's just not for me."}
{"text":"Checked out this location based on the yelp reviews. I would say this place is average.  We went on a Sunday night around 11 PM. Service was slow, and there were quite a few empty  tables around, but they still took a while to seat us. They might want to work a better system.  The ramen was average. Being from LA, we're used to having really good ramen. I ordered the tonkatsu white and my wife ordered the Cha Cha ramen.  The tonkatsu white had fried onions. the broth was decent, but just felt it had something missing. The cha cha ramen was garlic flavored and more memorable taste. moderately priced. probably worth the trip  place if your craving ramen somewhere off strip."}
{"text":"For a ramen place it was pretty cool. Awesome atmosphere and great seasonings for the ramen. The issue i had was with the amount of fat in my \"Jinya Bun\". Its equivalent to sho-po or mana pou and it was just so much fat i couldnt find the pork!   If you're strictly in the mood for ramen they're awesome but stay away from the supplemental menu."}
{"text":"Holy salt overload!!!!!! I'm totally feeling the effects the next day after eating so much salt. Bloat, guilt, and swollen toes.   We walked in, were seated quickly and the server asked us if we have been there before. My bf and I said no and her response was \"hmmm interesting.\" Uh wtf is that supposed to mean and what happened to \"welcome thank you for joining us.\" Are you guys so freaking well known that you are appalled that we've never eaten there before? That just put the rest of my dinner experience downhill, and honestly just straight pissed me off.   Tempura Brussel Sprouts: You could smell the truffle oil and garlic right when it got to the table. Batter wasn't too heavy and it was fried perfectly.   Tonkatsu assari The noodles had a good, firm texture but not too hard. The broth was rich and creamy. My favorite part of eating ramen is the soft boiled egg, which I always save for last. This was cooked perfectly as well.  Pork chasu bowl This was good, but the pork was a little tough in my opinion.   Mid meal, the initial server who put me in a bad mood had to go home, so she introduced us to our new server. She was nice and I'm glad we got someone new. I hope the tip we left went to her and not the first girl. As you can see, their food is great, but that one girl brought my whole experience down. If I come back, I hope I don't get the same server."}
{"text":"I went and had ramen here about a week ago. I am bias to the one in Studio City on Ventura and decided to try this one.  I have to say that I was not disappointed. There wasn't much of a wait on a Friday night. For a table of four we waited around 20 minutes. You could tell that the staff is very attentive but does their best to clear out and bus the tables as soon as they can for quick turnarounds.  Started off with the gyoza. They did a pretty good. Not too oily and the gyoza had a nice crisp side to it and the wrapper was still soft and chewy on the other side. They have premade sauce for the gyoza. I tend to like mine a little spicy so all I did was ask for chili oil.  I had the chicken wonton ramen. I have to say I am a fan of the more traditional places where you order Ramen and depending on what you order all the extras are included. You have to pay for everything outside of the noodles at this place. If you want an egg, which I added, it comes at a price. I also added the butter and Green onions. Be sure to ask for the fresh garlic. They hand you a jar of peeled garlic along with a garlic press. Might as will get all the freebies that you can.  The noodles were cooked well and the broth was flavorful. All in all a good experience and was on par with the studio city location."}
{"text":"Crystal is always amazing to me and greets me here all the time! I've never had a place that knows me and is so continuously amazing! The vegan ramen is my fav as it is the only thing I can really have! It's so delicious and I love coming here! Thanks jinya for being so delicious and so homey"}
{"text":"Incredible ramen.  Second favorite place for ramen in town.  Cauliflower was solid.  Staff was cool.  More contemporary than its competitors."}
{"text":"I always love coming here! I've been here a handful of times, at different hours, different days and have never had a bad experience. The hosts/staff are always friendly, and the kitchen is always fast.  Out of five or six times going I have only sent one thing back because they accidentally made the wrong soup. But within minutes I was given the right one.  They have the best seasoned eggs you can find in Vegas. Jinya has absolutely spoiled me in regards to that, I have to check to see what kind of eggs a ramen place has before I decide to go.  They have come out with a new cilantro ramen bowl and it was everything I could ask for.   This is an all around great place! The only thing I would wish for is a bigger restaurant, since this location is a little small."}
{"text":"Vegan ramen in Calgary!!!!! The broth wasn't great when this place first opened but now it's amazing. Their thick noodles are the best. Service is always great too."}
{"text":"Got the Spicy Tonkatsu and my date got the Tonkatsu Black. Overall, it was pretty good and nothing wrong. The meat very soft and well seasoned, however, the spicy broth was my favourite part of the meal. Thick and filling, it really hit the spot on a cold rainy day.   Overall, I would give it 3.5/5. It was still good, but I felt like it had lacked something extra."}
{"text":"This was the third ramen restaurant I have tried and I would have to say it is the best.  I am no expert, but I from all the ramen my friends ordered, there wasn't a single disappointment and they all had unique and strong flavors.  A local friend recommended it and there was a line outside the door before it even opened so I assume it is popular with the locals.  Within minutes of opening it was full.  Ramen was super flavorful, they give you options of different noodles, and a whole lot of additions you can make like adding eggs, various other meats, and more.  I would say if you like ramen this is a solid choice."}
{"text":"OH MY GOSH!!!! They are opening a location on rainbow and Warm Springs (SW) I just saw it yeahhhhhh"}
{"text":"I was so looking forward to trying this new ramen bar as it seemed to have a lot of franchise support backing it up.  Walking by at night since it opened a week or so ago with people lined up outside made me wonder also. Was it that good or were they just great marketers? Well the answer seems to be partly both.   I think they built up a bit of hype being the new kid in town and hailing from the US.  The reviews have however been spotty so far. So decided to give it a try at lunch the other day.  Snuck in at 11:30 just before the noon rush.  A few minutes later and we would have been lined up waiting for a table. We ordered a few things to try out.   Edamame - standard fare.  Can't really do this one way better or way worst than average. Sashimi salmon with cilantro - rather ordinary.  Salmon was average and the soya sauce with cilantro and jalapeños was just meh. Crispy chicken 5 piece -  juicy and tender but quite salty.  I think some good Korean KFC is way better. Then the real test.   Ordered the thick noodle tonkatsu ramen.  Noodles were chewy and very nice.  Broth was fairly salty and didn't have the subtlety of other ramen places. Fatty pork was average.  They gave a whole soft-ish boiled egg which was good.  I sort of like the half cut one to see how well they could really cook it.  The best concept was that you could get a noodle refill for $1.75.  So when you are almost done with your first order, you place another order for another batch of noodles.  So in ~ 5 minutes from ordering, they give you a plate of steaming noodles to dump into your remaining broth. Sweet. This accomplishes a couple of things.  First the extra noodles remain chewy and al dante versus sitting in the broth for a long time.  The replacement batch of noodles is piping hot so it acts like another new bowl of noodles sans all of the pork, egg, onions etc that you slurped up the first time. Tried the regular thin noodles and my preference is for the thick version which actually costs you an extra $1.75 surcharge.  But worth the extra cost in my opinion. So appetizers a 3.  Ramen with the bonus noodle refill concept pushes that part up to a 3.5. Overall nice addition to the 4h street dining scene which now has almost anything you want form burgers to high end dining and from various ethnicities.  Foodie heaven!"}
{"text":"Cute little place near china town. The decor inside was very cute. The chairs had no cushion though so my butt was hurting after an hour of being there.   Ordered the Tonkotsu Black spicy level medium. Delicious! All the flavors mixed well together. My favorite part was the seaweed. The spiciness was just right. The beau got the Spicy Chicken spiciest level. That thing was so spicy but it really was delicious. I think I might just stick with Chicken broth. I liked the Tonkotsu but I think chicken broth tasted better than pork.   We also go the Jinya Bun. I didn't really care for it. The pork had a very dominate taste to it. Also go the Crispy chicken, which I also didn't really like either. Came out with a salad which I liked.  But I ordered Annin Tofu for dessert. This was by far the best thing about the meal! It's sweat almond pudding with kiwi, mangos and strawberries with whipped cream on top! I don't know who told Jinya that those were my 3 favorite fruits. Must get if you come here.   Overall, it was a good meal."}
{"text":"The food here is great but the service is really really really bad.  I've had their Chachacha ramen and it's very tasty especially if you like garlic and spicy food. The Jinya buns are soft and the pork melts in your mouth. The salmon Poke tacos are my favorite. Nothing special with the pork tacos and crispy chicken. I understand that when we came here the place was new so we extended our patience. But we came in the afternoon avoiding the peak hours. Service was still really bad. Nobody came to seat us. Half the bar was empty so my group expected to be seated right away. Still took the staff 23 minutes to clear up the bowls from the previous customers, wipe down the table and come get us to take our seats.  So all in all great food. Terrible service."}
{"text":"3.5*  My favourite place for ramen in Jinya in Kerrisdale (Vancouver). I was so happy when I heard Calgary would soon have a location. My friends and I went on the second day Jinya opened. I don't want to be too harsh because Jinya just opened up and I'm sure this place will be my new favourite place soon.   The positive - great vibe and the room itself is nicely set-up. There's lots of space and tables though it got completely packed by 12:00pm. I ordered the Toyko Special ($13.50). The ramen is well-priced for the amount of food in the bowl. I really really enjoyed the pork cutlet and the creamy gooey egg. The thin noodles were perfectly cooked. The broth was super thick and a little too rich, and this is coming from someone who loves anything super high in calories, cholestral, and fat. The broth wasn't hot enough for me. Perhaps that was why the broth was gelatinous.  I won't go into the \"What could be improved?\" because other reviewers have touched on it already. Right now, if you want a big bowl of ramen in a hip, fun vibe, I would totally recommend it."}
{"text":"I'm not sure where I read or heard about this place but it was definitely hyped up enough that I convinced my bf and friends to go try it out.   I ordered the tonkotsu ramen which was mediocre. Noodles were thick cut and had the right amount of chew to it. Broth was tasty but a little bit too salty for what I'm used to. Overall, it wasn't mind blowing but a good/reliable option if you're in the area. I was entertained by how many different kinds of ramen and add-on options they had on the menu."}
{"text":"Pork gyoza - not bad.   Spicy chicken ramen - absolutely amazing. I got the \"spicy\" selection, and it was just the perfect amount of heat. Go up to hot if you're into spicy things. L  The spicy sauce on the table is on point.   The side salad was straight up a bowl of spinach with a large helping of the typical house dressing on it. Not tossed, just sitting there. Tasty, but meh. Some other veggies would be cool.  The tofu dessert was really tasty.   The service was not good. At all. I think the server's name was Fei. Sometimes, people have a way about them and their presence is just unwelcome even if you don't know them - that was our server. She'd take our order, and then walk away without a word - didn't even look up from the tablet. No \"thank you\" or \"you're welcome\". My drink cup was empty for way longer than it should be. Not the greatest. The kicker was an interaction with the party seated behind us. They asked for something, she says \"Ohh there's only one left and I'm taking that for my boyfriend\"  LOL REALLY.   I'll be back. And I'll be sure to have a different server."}
{"text":"This place has some of the best ramen in town, hands down.  Definitely recommend the spicy chicken ramen and an ice cold beer.  Great customer service as well."}
{"text":"Enjoying Tonkotsu Ramen with black garlic oil. Solid ramen, sometimes Tonkotsu (Pork) ramen can bet a bit too rich and heavy, but Jinya seems to find a good balance. Soy sauce egg perfectly soft boiled yolk and firm whites - which is exactly how I like it!   Pork belly bun (Jinya Bun) average- steamed bun pillowy soft. Pork a little dry, could have used a bit more sauce. But I do like the texture of the pork belly - good bite, not too flabby. I would have loved a little tang - maybe a bite of pickle to cut the richness of the pork belly, soft bun, mayonnaise."}
{"text":"Was not a fan of these guys.  Was excited to check it out based on the recommendations of a friend but left disappointed with the quality and especially the staff.  I really love late night ramen and it was cool to see these guys open so late, and we came by right around midnight for a late dinner.  I got the garlic ramen and it was decent but I would argue there actually wasn't enough garlic with it.  The noodles were okay as well but nothing special, and the price/value overall was fairly average.  Overall, it was fine and definitely filling, but the flavor was a bit lacking.  The staff was where I had the real problem, though.  Our waitress couldn't be bothered in the slightest with us and barely spoke to us while taking our order.  We really never saw her again as other servers came to refill our drinks and such.  We ordered two appetizers we didn't receive until we brought them up twice and they arrived after we had almost finished our ramen, and my wife didn't get a drink she ordered until late as well.  The waitress also mixed up our check with another one and added items onto ours that we didn't order.  When we went up to talk to her and a manager about the bill and the lack of service, we were met with indifference and no effort to make things right.  I'm not usually one to complain about wait staff because I know it's a hectic job and I don't leave crappy reviews for for things like waiting a few extra minutes and such, but this was not acceptable, at all.  With so many other excellent ramen options in Vegas, we will not come back to Jinya."}
{"text":"I was impressed with the line that formed before they opened the doors at 11:30 am. But I was not impressed with the food or how small the restaurant was. I ordered the sukiyaki beef bowl and my friend ordered the original ramen soup. The beef bowl was ok, but only had like 3 pieces strings of beef and the rest was rice. No flavor. Disappointing. My friends ramen looked good and he loved it. The restaurant was small and totally need a real paint job and a ceiling. Hahaha. Customer service was okay, just sat us, took order, served food and done. I wasn't impressed, so this review is going to be short."}
{"text":"Went here last night around 6 pm and for a Saturday night there was a pretty good wait. Probably around 40 min. or so for a table of two. Once we were able to sit down, we ordered the Spicy Chicken Ramen and the Tokyo Special Ramen (available until February). Both were delicious. The broth on both of them were so hearty and the noodles were cut and made just right. Not too soft and not too hard but just right.... If I had to pick which one was better I would pick the Spicy Chicken Ramen. The broth is so good and the chicken is so tender. The Tokyo Special is still nice though, they give you a some pork chasu and an egg.  I've tried a few ramen places including Monta, Ramen Tatsu and Ramen Sora and in my opinion, Jinya beats all the others hands down. Highly recommended and I will be back!"}
{"text":"Best ramen I have had in Las Vegas. The food here is all very tasty and delicious. Just be prepared for a wait time for both lunch and dinner. Have not had luck at all with delivery services as all my orders have been cancelled due to high volume of the restaurant. Other than that, it is always great being seated because it means food is minutes away!"}
{"text":"I love that place. I'm back to Vegas for a week and went here already twice in 2 days. Karage chicken ramen are really good as well as shrimp balls with cream cheese))"}
{"text":"Pretty good, the server was cute hehe, the food was filling, the rice wine was interesting new place, new things. New experiences,  is come back for that cute guy to serve me food again!!! ;)"}
{"text":"Definitely one of the best ramen restaurants in Vegas! The place is small but well worth it! The food was good, the atmosphere was friendly, the restaurant was clean and the staff is one of the best! The food was a good portion and also allows you to \"customize\" the food anyway you want it. I would go back again! One of my FAVORITE RESTAURANTS!"}
{"text":"Honestly cannot complain at all about this place. Went here with my boyfriend on a Friday night after a concert and you can tell everyone knows this place is gooooooood.   Cute ramen shop with lots of different ramen bases and add ins to choose from! It was so late that I don't exactly remember the name of what we got, but I did get a white...tonkotsu base? And my be got something with hellllaaaa garlic. All you need to know is that the flavors were reaaaallllyyyyy good! We also got the pork buns as an appetizer and I'm fairly happy with those also!   I feel as if the cuts of meat were generous, but I still have lots of love for My OG spot in Vegas- Monta Ramen. Monta is a more simplistic ramen with good cuts of porkbelly and relatively basic but delicious add ins. I'd have to say that JINYA is unique for the different flavors, the atmosphere with great service, and the attention to detail with their ramen. Definitely try this place out! (You may be waiting for a bit, but it's worth it!)"}
{"text":"Super ono; the service was fast and friendly! Get out of the casino and eat here!"}
{"text":"Jinya is one of my favorite ramen bar places to go. It's the first chose when someone wants ramen. They waiting line is about 10-20 minutes long so be ready to wait. The food makes the wait worth it. I usually get the Spicy Chicken Ramen (Hot) the thing I like is that you could add anything you want to your ramen for less then 3 dollars each item.  The serves is great they are always making sure you are doing well and giving you refills ."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I are on a Ramen tour around Las Vegas. And WOW this place had such incredible flavor. Once you walk into the place you are hit with a savory wisp of delicious smells. We got there during happy hour and tried their popular Jinya Bun (you don't want to pass on those!) it was so tasty. The only downside is that when the place is busy the service quality goes way down. We didn't know who was our server and it took them about 7 minutes from seating us to getting our drink orders in. Definitely will try again when it's not their rush hour!"}
{"text":"I like it. I have yet tried all ramen places in Vegas, but this one is pretty good Tonkotsu Ramen.   We ordered karaage for appetizer. Very traditional Japanese flavor note, very well seasoned, very juicy inside with crispy outside.  For noodle, I ordered white one (wanted to try black one but had to share mine with my 5yo, so I gave up my spicy :( ) with corn and spicy bean sprout on the side. Very mild broth with extra thin noodle. Kikurage topping adds really good texture.   My husband ordered spicy (you can chose spiciness, 1-5) something and he liked it."}
{"text":"JINYA is definitely shaking up the Vegas ramen scene. Truthfully, I haven't been back since to Ramen Sora or Monta Ramen since this place has opened, so I feel a bit guilty for that. I really like the Tonkatsu Black Ramen and appreciate that it comes with everything you could already want, no need to order any extra. They have a \"ramen sauce\" on the table, but I haven't been compelled to use it. There is a good variety of appetizers here, my favorite so far is the tempura Brussels Sprouts that are really well seasoned, no sauce needed. My one complaint would be that my husband and I keep getting seated in cramped 2-person tables when there are plenty of other non-cramped 2-person tables available. I'm going to start speaking up on this when we go, I'm a bit tired of putting my purse on the floor or on the chair and it getting hit the whole time. Otherwise, I really enjoy coming here. Music is always interesting, tea costs extra but is pretty tasty, parking is easy and there's normally never a wait. It's a little bit less of a drive to make it out here too from the Westside, those few blocks down Chinatown make a difference haha"}
{"text":"There Ramen was delicious! Best Ramen I had since returning from Japan. I decided on Tonkotsu! There soup base is so so so   tasty... just thinking about it makes my mouth watery! The pork is soft and melts in your mouth! To make things even tastier you can pick from thin or thick noddles. If your debating about going to JINYA ... DO IT! You will not regret it! Cheers and Enjoy ~ lucky!"}
{"text":"I'm not the biggest fan of ramen, but JINYA's spicy chicken ramen was pretty good. It's hard to find a ramen that isn't a pork broth, so this option was pretty nice."}
{"text":"Officially open for less than a week.  I would've thought this ramen joint has always been here.  Service is definitely a top priority here.  The choices are nominal and the prices are extremely low.  The tapas have some unique clichés.  Such as the Truffled Brussels Sprouts Tempura. Light tempura crunch into brussels snap then the sharp taste of strong truffle oil.  The aroma of truffle is so strong it can be sensed at the next table.  Real or not I'd take any kind of black truffle flavor I can in the summer. 4/5  The sticky bun pork sliders were soo tender.  I would say the pork was cooked over night.  The bun was soft fresh and delicate.  The light sweet sauce and arugula finish it off as my favorite asian slider to date.  All so tender it made me eat it slowly. 4.5/5  Takoballs were arranged in a line of six.  Lightly golden fried with a little slice of baby octopi in them.  They are nested atop an egg salad cream.  Flavor was not too prominent but the textures were nice.  3.5/5  Crispy Chicken was only 3$ for 5 pieces during HH.  They were crispy and not dry in any way inside.  White meat and heavy portioned there was a small dash of that Japanese signature salad.  A little bit of dipping sauce (ponzu?) it was a nice filler. 3.5/5  The Tonkotsu Black is the more formal ramen here.  It has everything in it.  Seaweed, soft boiled egg, fried onions, etc. with small noodles.  Now this is the thicker broth of chicken and pork with 2 slices of tender pork medalion.  So rich and not salty at all.  I imagined turtle soup would be this thick.  This is the best bowl of ramen I've had in town & I've been to Japan.  So if I hadn't I'd say it was the best I've ever tried.. 4.5/5  For dessert we had a whipped almond custard that had chopped fruit.  Only 2$ during HH!  Modern eastern minimalist decor, of which I have a fetish.  Notable service.  Damn good ramen!  4.5 star restaurant."}
{"text":"Cozy atmosphere. Great for a date night! The chicken and rice bowl that I had seemed really simple on paper, but the flavors blew me away. The tempura brussel sprouts were also seasoned to perfection!"}
{"text":"best ramen offered in Vegas. Beats Manta Ramen because of their larger selection. They are also more affordable than Manta due to their combo lunches/dinner. I ordered their spicy miso special (Dec 2014- jan 2015) and that should be a main staple on the menu because it's the best tasting ramen if you are into spicy. Their pork belly is always perfectly cooked and never over done."}
{"text":"Nice hangout spot. They play upbeat (Electronic) music which makes it a little more lively. Not a large menu but your noodles are very customizable! I could eat about 10 of their Jinya buns, so delicious and soft!"}
{"text":"Decided to try this new place out with a takeout order.  The staff was friendly, and talked about the menu.   The broth and soup base were in separate containers so I could blend them together. The noodles were a little stuff, but that might be my inexperience.  The bag include chop sticks, which I appreciate and skipped the fork that I didn't need anyway. The tuna roll was well presented in another container.   I will be back again."}
{"text":"Recommend the fried chicken.  Noodles where also good.   When early Sunday night, no line.  Will go back again. They have a happy hour 3-5 pm.  Got there a couple minutes before happy hour was over and they still let us order off happy hour menu."}
{"text":"Food was amazing,  easy menu to navigate through.  Service a little hectic  (plates cleared before we finished, language barrier) but no attitude."}
{"text":"Jinya is brand new in Toronto, and is a large global player in the world of ramen. I love ramen, so we just had to come check it out.  Located at Church and College, Jinya sits inside of an unassuming space that looks like a repurposed bar. The table settings were neatly placed and clean, with prominent Jinya branding, and there was even an array of sauces for your own enjoyment: hot sauce, gyoza sauce, ramen seasoning, and the familiar mixed chilli pepper powder. Being able to season your own dishes is relatively novel, so I'll give them props for that.  Our server quickly greeted us and walked through the menu, before letting us know that, unfortunately, they had run out of thin noodles, so only thick noodles would be available. At the end of the day, not a huge deal, but I've never heard of a ramen place running out of noodles.  Anyhow, we ordered the brussels sprouts tempura, the premium tonkotsu white ramen, and the Jinya tonkotsu black ramen.  To start, the brussels sprouts were well presented, and were fresh from the fryer. They were hot, and crispy, and the sprouts themselves were nice and tender. That said, they lacked any sort of seasoning or flavour, and I really wish they served it with salt or some sort of flavoured sauce to dip it into. Really, really, disappointing.  My girlfriend had the premium tonkotsu white ramen ($12.75), which was a mixed pork and chicken broth, and I had the Jinya tonkotsu black ramen ($14.00), which was just a rich pork broth.  I can tell you that the noodles were well cooked, and the fixins were prepared well. Unfortunately, both of our broths were on the weaker side, in terms of richness, and were really nothing to write home about when it comes to flavour. In addition, both of the ramen we ordered had seasoned egg as an inclusion, except the premium tonkotsu white came with half, and the Jinya tonkotsu black came with a whole one. Who decided this, and why was no one told?  In addition, the portions were on the very small side. I found myself not feeling completely satisfied after a beer, splitting a starter, and a bowl of ramen. The pieces of pork in my bowl were also quite small, and despite being tender, lacked any sort of flavour. This did not help.  Basically, eating at Jinya came down to this: a mediocre bowl of ramen that was further dragged down by small portion sizes, tasteless meat, watery broth, and at a price point that makes it far more expensive than better bowls of ramen from other places. Very disappointing.  There are better offerings down the street, or a short walk away: Kinton, Santouka, Sansotei. I encourage you to explore those options, or any other ones that aren't much farther away."}
{"text":"Food was mediocre. Menu was extensive and everything sounds good.  However, it was not good! I think i would have enjoyed it better if the service wasn't below average.  These girls are unhappy with their jobs and they need to understand they are in an industry where customer service is important.  Not worth the wait. I ate as fast as I could to get out of that depressing place."}
{"text":"Quality ingredients and those broths....just awesome.  The place is always crowded and a pain to get into but worth it."}
{"text":"I stopped in around noon on a Sunday. They open at 11:30 am and it was already busy busy. Fortunately for us, the host seated us at the community style table just 5 minutes after we arrived, which was great because we were starved after a hike. (Side note, the toilet is..well not your traditional throne, I honestly could not figure it out, but it looks neat) Anyhoo, I'm new to the ramen world and the menu was simple enough for me to get exactly what I wanted. I had the shrimp balls and the spicy chicken ramen (just the right amount of spicy), both were delicious and full of flavor. I stopped by later in the week for dinner and the line was out the door, it was windy and we didn't feel like waiting but I'll be back another day with more time. :)"}
{"text":"What can I say....My Girlfriend and I loved this place so much until today We ordered Crispy fried chicken appetizer and to our surprise it was grossly uncooked, which as you all know, when it comes to chicken it can be very dangerous...anyway, we call out server to complain about it and she was very rude and careless, we showed her the piece of uncooked chicken and she just said \"oh is that the only piece that is uncooked?\" like as if one piece wasnt enough...then she offered to replace it, however,  we didnt feel like eating it anymore.  We also spoke to the manager, he was nice and professional and actually apologized for the inconvenience. But seriously dissapointer today for this experience."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to come here for quite some time per Yelp reviews from friends, however, unfortunately, the service does not live up to the expectation. It took over 30 minutes for us to receive our food. Since we were on our lunch break it ended up costing us the dine-in experience and we had to ask for our food to go.   That is the sole reason for the 2 star review. The food is great. I got the spicy chicken ramen at the HOT spice level and the flavors were on point. I eat fire so it wasn't too hot for me. What surprised me was that I didn't think I'd like the spinach but it was wonderful! The edamame was plain, steamed, hardly any salt. I should have put some garlic on it.   Next time I come I'm going to make sure I have nothing but time. However, this will never be somewhere I stop for lunch again."}
{"text":"This location is very tiny, you'd think they start making their locations bigger with the volume of customers they get but they don't. The wait was about 25 minutes for 4 on a Tuesday night. They were very very crowded, tons of people waiting. But it looked like the kitchen was really backed up.  I ordered my ramen and then found out they were out of limes, so my ramen didn't really taste right. But the service is good, not exceptional, just ok.. I don't know why they didn't have an employee go to the store, from the time we sat down to the time we got our food..  40 minutes went by. They seemed really disorganized last night 1/1/18. I don't know what was going on..   They should take some tips from their California locations, like the one in studio city."}
{"text":"Horrible service, waited 40 minuets for them to tell me they had called me prior. If you really want the best ramen drive 2 more minuets and go to Ramen Sora on spring mountain, way better and worth a wait."}
{"text":"I seriously love this place! Always fast and friendly service, delicious food, and good atmosphere. Seating doesn't take too long and the service is very attentive even though it's always busy. I always have to get the crispy chicken on the side because it's so good. I prefer to get the chicken based ramens because the pork gets a bit heavy for me, but everything is great! I love coming here for either date nights or to hang out with my girlfriends. I'll always come back for more of this bomb food and fun times!"}
{"text":"This place was really nice, tonight was my first time there and I immediately fell in love with the atmosphere and of course the food. I tried the Tokoyaki and the braised Pork belly on steamed sweet buns. Each dish was really delicious, To the point that I savored every bit.   The music they played reminded me of a cool lounge spot... Just really laid back but classy, not to mention the staff was very knowledgeable about the menu, friendly, and helpful! I would defiantly be back for more... So far my only complaint is that the restaurant as a whole is kind of small, but with that out of the way I still highly recommend you to check this little gem out! (In my opinion) you will not regret it!!"}
{"text":"I can't bring myself to give Jinya less than 5 stars. It truly is my favorite ramen place in Vegas and L.A. I bring so many of my friends, family and the occasional work meeting here to try ramen for the first time and they all are just blown away. BUT my last experience was something truly regrettable. In true Japanese fashion the restaurant is small and intimate, which adds to the ambiance in a positive way. It gives the restaurant and very authentic feel but it seems it is getting busier and busier. Wait times are outrageous; last time my family and I waited for over an hour and a half. To add insult to injury, they were out of stuff! PLEASE consider adding a second location. Somewhere in Henderson would be fantastic. To fight through traffic and then wait for nearly 2 hours to be served is really discouraging, no matter how awesome the food is."}
{"text":"Its really good, but it's over price by about 30% in my opinion. I just had the chicken Ramen I need to try the other dishes to give a better review. Soups just to costly."}
{"text":"Ramen was great! I like how they have so many flavor options for you to choose out of. I got the Tonkatsu (Black) Regular. I also got Takoyaki. I was a little disappointed in the Takoyaki. They put barbecue sauce on it and it kind of ruined the whole thing for me. That's the reason why I gave it minus 1 star. Otherwise- it's a great ramen place with decorative bowls and chill ambience."}
{"text":"With all the great Yelp reviews, this looked like a good place for lunch. And how right we were!!  We ordered 5 different items to go. I had the Tonkotsu spicy, ($10.) and requested medium. Holy Schmokes was it good!! And this was a to go order! I can't imagine how yummy everything is fresh out of he kitchen.  Every single person said they loved their lunch from here.  I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Definitely a vegetarian, vegan and pescetarian-friendly ramen place! This made me very happy.  I had the salmon poke tacos (happy hour includes some appetizers) and the veggie ramen with garlic, butter and a seasoned egg (my fav). Service was a tad slow, but it was the beginning of the dinner rush and happy hour, so no biggie. Just be aware like with most ramen places in Las Vegas, there will be a wait unless you time your visit just right. The restaurant itself was very clean. I won't go into a deep philosophical  novel describing my food, I'll just leave a picture right here...."}
{"text":"I have seen a few Jinya locations, and this chain has been recommended to me by a few people, so I thought it would be a great time to try it out. I was hankering for a bowl of ramen while I was out in Vegas, and luckily this place was there. Upon arriving, we saw that the parking lot was full and that the restaurant itself was pretty busy - always a good sign. We put a name down for a table and we waited, which made us crave the ramen and made us much more excited for our meal. We had great service from the moment we walked into the restaurant up until the moment we walked out. I had a bowl of the Jinya Tonkotsu Black and my companions had the Spicy Chicken Ramen, Jinya Chicken Ramen, and the Wonton Chicken Ramen. All of the bowls of ramen were delicious and had great tasting broth. We definitely were very happy with our meals. We also had two servings of the Takoyaki which were the perfect accompaniments to our bowls of ramen. I hope to come into another Jinya location since this place was great. I am very surprised with the quality of the ramen that we got here, and I look forward to seeing another Jinya location. The restaurant itself was very stylish, clean, and had a dark setting. The restaurant was busy, but the service did not suffer due to this."}
{"text":"Less Menu Selections and to improve the taste of their main course. They need to stick to thier Coulture flavoring...Service is Great.. Manager and Server always come by to check if anything is needed..."}
{"text":"I love going here. The ramen is so good. Everything I have tried has not disappointed . Thy even offer a vegatarian option but I like substituting the chicken/pork broth for veggie. And , always getting thin noodles. They let you substitute very easily which is great. There pork bun is perfection. Highly recommend the wait ."}
{"text":"Jinya is one of the better ramen places in Vegas. Their wait time was bout 10-15 mins on a normal day. The service was good that day despite the business.   I ordered the Shoyu ramen with extra Brussel sprouts. I quite enjoy the char of their brussel sprouts. This place so far, is the only one that offers Brussel sprouts as an addition to your ramen. The broth of the ramen wasn't to thick and had all of the umami flavors that I was expecting.    Their chicken bun is a highly recommended appetizer.   And for dessert, I ordered their block berry icecream bar. It's pretty sweet so find a partner to share it with.   I would come here again."}
{"text":"They have different variety to choose from but I was looking for shoyu and they don't have it. I like their happy hour because it's 7 days a week unlike most of them excluding weekends."}
{"text":"I like mine thick, rich, and hot...ramen at Jinya Ramen Bar that is!  We have so many options for ramen in Vegas, but this is my favorite spot, and here are some of the items I enjoy:  Wonton Chicken Ramen Spicy Chicken Ramen Jinya Chicken Ramen Takoyaki  Arabiki pork sausage Brussel sprouts  I always prefer thick noodle vs. thin, extra spicy, and a couple cloves of garlic squeezed in it...and of course one more seasoned egg. Their seasoned egg yolk is always perfectly runny and delicious. I added a poached egg a couple of times, but seasoned egg adds more flavor to my soup.   Most of the time, my love and I have to wait at least 10min or so, but once you're seated, service is quick and excellent. Doesn't matter how busy they might be, the staff are calm and pleasant. Don't forget to put your name on the clip board when you first come in if there is a wait list going.  - 2017 Review #40 -"}
{"text":"The buns are amazing my bf loves this place he also loves the ramen me i think it's good way better than last time for sure it's growing on me"}
{"text":"TLDR: Service was good, appetizers came quickly and was delicious, entrees were slower. I had the chachacha, decent, had better elsewhere in Los Angeles.  Takoyaki, tasty and generously portioned. Chachacha, garlic flavors, chasiu was good, not a fan of the thick noodles, extremely filling.  Worth a try!"}
{"text":"The Ramen soup is good but only if has chicken!! The vegetarian soup had a very boring and  bland flavor.. The rice and Japanese curry was excellent and all of the Vegetables/ingredients were super Fresh... I  also loved the tempura Brussel sprouts!!"}
{"text":"Used to be my favorite ramen joint in Vegas. USED TO! I am never coming back here after my terrible experience!! We ordered takoyaki and after eating few pieces my girlfriend found a long hair in one of them! When we called our server she gave us a weird look and took the plate away, no apology no sorry nothing!! She treated us like it was our fault there was a hair in the food! When she brought our check she said I took the takoyaki of the bill, still no apology! I thanked her and we paid the bill. I asked to talk with the manager who was a little bit more understating and offer us ice cream next time we visit. I explained to her that it should not be my who has to ask for a manager in this situation and someone should apologize  1 star for terrible service, I understand mistake happens but the server should react in a more professional manner instead of giving us attitude and not offering an apology."}
{"text":"Yet another global ramen chain coming to Toronto is never a bad thing!  I dropped into Jinya Ramen Bar for a quick tasty lunch and a more relaxed dinner (This is two dining experienced wrapped up into one review!)  I was not disappointed and left satisfied after both visits.  For lunch, I settled for their no. 2 most popular ramen, the cha cha cha which is for garlic lovers.  Pork chashu, bean sprouts, and a seasoned egg accompany the thick pork broth while they pile some green onions and crushed garlic on top.    (Don't forget to ask for some additional garlic to crush into your ramen, it's free!)  I liked the thick noodles with the broth and I just devoured it wholeheartedly.  For dinner, we started with the tempura brussel sprouts drizzled with some truffle oil.  They came out fresh and crunchy with the strong scent of truffles.  I am sold on tempura brussel sprouts!  I decided to try their no. 1 spicy chicken ramen with \"spicy\" spice level.  The light chicken broth definitely provides a great punch to your mouth while slurping up the noodles.  The chicken chashu didn't really impress as it just looked like slices of white chicken breast meat with no real seasoning but the other veggie condiments (bean sprouts, spinach, and welsh onions) were nice.  The service was fast and efficient and, like most ramen places, they offer you a warm greeting when you enter and exit the place.  Definitely another place that is going to have some staying power here in Toronto. :-)"}
{"text":"Best ramen in town. It has wiped monta off my list of go-to ramen shops. I'm coming after sora soon!"}
{"text":"I like that Jinya Ramen Bar is trying to do something different than the other ramen shops in Vegas. I did like their Tokatsu Black ramen for ~$10.50. Very fatty, deep broth with plenty of garlic (which I love), good thin noodles and tasty meat. It could use a little more meat and a little less salt. This is good, but I think that Monta Ramen has arguably better or just as good ramen and it's a few dollars cheaper.  The thing that sets Jinya apart is the rest of their menu (not the rice bowls). The tempura brussel sprouts with truffle oil were amazing! They were very crunchy but juicy on the inside and the truffle oil was both fragrant and tasty. It was also well seasoned with salt and pepper. They also have the best takoyaki in Vegas. Sufficient portions of octopus and just a well done, generous portion for $5.20.  They also have a happy hour from 3 - 5 p.m. on weekdays (I want to try their chicken karaage then) and also a lunch special seven days a week from 11:30 - 5 p.m. ($12 set menu with half ramen and half rice bowls, three gyoza, a free soft drink and almond tofu dessert.   We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Simply the best Tonkotsu I have ever had.  No wait time @15h00 Service - 5 star Food Presentation - 5 star Food flavor - Cloud 9 Waiting for the Panna Cotta.   Def coming back"}
{"text":"I love this place! Let me just say I'm now vegan and have never been to this place in my meat eating days. I enjoyed pork in my ramen in my precious life so I'm constantly on the search for fatty, creamy, belly stretching vegan ramen. This. Is. It. I really loved their spicy creamy vegan ramen both times I came here.  This place isn't that large but they seem to make it work. There are a few bar seats, booths lining the restaurant and a community table in the center. I love that they have alcohol on the menu because who doesn't love beer and/or sake with their food? They have different items like tacos and buns on the menu that I have not tried but seem to be popular. They have a happy hour for drinks and food items.  One of the best things about this place is that they allow you to order extra noodles for your ramen for only $1-2.... so both times I finished my noodles and some of my broth, ordered extra noodles to go and had my broth packed to go as well. Second meal! I wish I lived closer to this spot. I would be here all the time!"}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to trying out Jinya since I read a good amount of positive reviews on Yelp.  We arrived at about 5 PM on 11/24, before heading out to catch our flight back home.  We were seated pretty much right away since it was a Monday and we happened to show up during their happy hour which is from 3-6 PM, I believe.  I decided to order the pork ear chicharones as an appetizer, since it looked really interesting from the picture on the menu.  My son loves hot sauce so we were hoping that it would be one of those items we'd come back for on our future visits.  It pretty much tasted like they just drenched tapatio sauce all over it.  It wasn't spicy at all so we won't be trying that again.  We both ordered a bowl of the tonkotsu spicy ramen, my son went for spicy while I opted for medium.  The broth was pretty good, but you can see that extra layer of fat once your broth gets cold which I'm not too crazy about.  The noodles were really firm to the point where it seemed undercooked.  Maybe I will ask to have them cook it longer next time.  Overall, I would come back if I need a ramen spot that stays open late, but if it's during regular business hours...I'll continue to enjoy my ramen at Ramen Sora."}
{"text":"Best place to eat Ramen in Vegas. Always worth the wait. Price is great. Happy it was open when we went. Because last time we went we didn't know why they closed."}
{"text":"Had the Cha Cha ramen. If you like garlic, you'll like this one! Broth is very good! If you have a large group you might have to share the big center table. Restroom has heated seats! Haha!"}
{"text":"I like Jinya.  I like everything about a small ramen bar with enthusiastic service and great music.  The appetizers are delicious.  I will definitely go back for more sometime soon."}
{"text":"Ramen was amazing and service was very attentive. I loved the atmosphere of the restaurant! The place gets busy so make sure you come early!"}
{"text":"I keep returning to jinya because I love their ramen so much!  But unfortunately I keep getting really unkind servers. I actually nudged my boyfriend and I asked him if we tip okay and he said we did. My friends had the same server in which they tip 20% everywhere they go - and terrible experience to the point they don't even go back anymore.   I've had a tall white kid with blonde hair and we had to flag him down for anything we needed and he would come by and literally drop them on the table and quickly leave. I watched as he did that to multiple tables. Then there's a chick with glasses and light skinned, and for some reason she has a really bad attitude all the time. She brought us our ramen for our server and I asked her for two spoons because our table didn't have any, and she said yes and I watched her go straight for a pitcher of water to fill up other tables and then she kept looking over at me and I got up from my table and walked over to ask for spoons which were right behind her and she said \"yeah in just a minute.\" And continued to not do anything. 15 minutes go by and my boyfriend got up and went to the same lil station and asked a different person and he got our spoons.. It's not only that time but every time, even if I just have a question she kind of looks at me like \"uh.\" And I don't understand.. if I ever go back, I will make it clear not to have her near me again. I was pretty irritated and hungry and that almost pissed me off enough to ask her what's the deal but I have to remember to be nice and have consideration for others if they're having a bad day but damn. I've also had this OTHER girl who got irritated that I got a ramen with something I didn't ask her for but I wasn't asking for a remake, she was just forcing that upon me and I still paid for the type of soup I didn't ask for, haha.  I work in a restaurant myself and my job is to bring a smile to the table and welcome everyone to continue to help our business grow but I can't be rude to someone when I have no reasoning. It's frustrating in a faced paced place but I'm kind. As everyone should be.   Maybe I'll start doing To go orders instead. Or I'll go to the other ramen place by the CSN Charleston Campus."}
{"text":"Authentic ramen in vegas!! Al dente noodles, thick broth, perfect soft boiled egg, what's not to like? Brussel sprouts were super yummy too.. Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"I don't see what's so special about Jinya. At first, I tried to get it spicy, but it left a weird taste and pretty much ruined the soup for me. Then I decided to give it a second try, sans anything spicy and it was just decent."}
{"text":"Came here because we went to the one in San Diego, but the service sucks really bad here. We ordered salmon poke, 2 ramen, and califlower. They brought us a wrong order, so i let a different server know. They took it back and didnt apologize, also they still charged us for the wrong order and didnt take it off our bill. Our server was nice but wasnt attentive. He never came and checked up on us. We had to wave him down to get a spoon and napkins, but after we asked him he went to go help another table and then bus down a table that just left before he brought us the spoons and napkins. At the end we asked the hostess for a 2 boxes and our check, she said okay. Then i saw her getting 2 checks for other tables and not us. She kept walking by and still didnt give us our check and boxes, 15 minutes passed so we asked a different server to get it for us, i explained what happened, and she didnt even apologize on the behalf of her coworkers."}
{"text":"This place is ok. I've been here more than a few times to know that their food isn't consistent. Ramen tasted alright, dessert was good except for the mochi ice cream (the consistency was grainy), but the appetizers & tapas are mediocre. Music is extremely loud (you can't even hear each other talk), the air conditioning vents made the food cold fast. The last time I went, their credit card machine went down.   The server was nice, apologized & asked if it was ok for us to wait until it came back up but the hostess returned & forced two people out of our group to go to ATM's to pay for our food so that other people can sit in our booths. The machine went back up after 5 minutes but by then the two people out of my group already had left. The hostess didn't even apologize. Such a huge inconvenience!  I honestly think that was one of the worst customer experience I've had at a food establishment."}
{"text":"BADDDD BADDDD to go experienced!!!!!!!!!  I ask for two ramen to go w/ noodles uncooked and jinya bun.    Normally they would put the uncooked noodles separately but this time they decided to put the toppings with it. HOW am I going to cook the noodles???!! Yeah I can just pick on the noodles etc but TIME CONSUMING!!! I am just exhausted from work and I seriously shouldnt be doing this. I did call whoever is in charge and told me to just pick on the noodles etc blah blah. Well, not happy about this at all!!!!!"}
{"text":"I've only really been to Monta Ramen and Ramen Sora but this place blows it out of the water. I'm not huge on ramen either, I feel they're all the same and have that same distinct creamy taste. However, with Jinya that's totally different.   First off, I love the ambience of the place it's very warm and sultry with dim lighting. The place is fairly small but was packed tonight and wasn't really a wait. The staff is very hands on and seem very inviting as well.   Now for the food, this is my brothers favorite place so he recommend me try the Tokyo Yatai since this was my first time. It was absolutely delicious, the broth was both chicken and pork and had slices of chicken in it as well. I added corn and seaweed and opted out of the bamboo shoots since I feel bamboo really overpowers the true flavor of the broth. The spicy level I chose was hot and it was the right amount of hot for my palette, it wasn't like a bland type of spice only focusing on heat content but this spicy level was more so about flavor content and that's what I like. Overall, it was great and I finished my entire bowl.  Now the negatives as to why I didn't give it five stars, not really a wide selection of beer or other drinks. They had your regular sake's and craft beers with some novelty non-alcoholic drinks like Calpico and ramune but as far as everything else goes I wish they had more non-alcoholic drink options maybe expansion of their sodas or maybe even some Thai tea? Also no free refills which caused me to spend 7 dollars alone on just drinks.   Other than that, I still would recommend this place to everyone. They're doing great. Keep it up Jinya."}
{"text":"What an enjoyable ramen bar. I always come just for their crispy shrimp balls but of course, their ramen is good too.  The interior is great and since I come in at night, it has dim lighting. They don't close until 3 AM which is even better! Service is always excellent and our drinks are always filled.  It does get busy around midnight so prepare to be on a wait list. I went there recently and the music selections have improved  :-)"}
{"text":"My favorite thing about Jinya is the food is always hot, fresh and fast even though they are usually really busy. By far best ramen in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"WIth the breaking news that JINYA is opening a restaurant in Chicago, I have been compelled to finish this review (not even the constant yelp reminder could do that!).  I enjoyed having the option of thin or thick noodles, and as I prefer the thicky thick (noodles), I went with those. It was a good decision.  Chose the Tonkotsu Black ramen and the spiciness was just right, especially for this fella who cannot handle his spice well.   There are a number of items available to add-on, and if you add garlic they give you a press and you can press the garlic yourself. Pretty interactive.  I know the drive-thru may never open, but the fact that they even imagined the concept of a ramen drive-thru scores major points in my book. I'm up for the challenge if it ever does open!  Also, staying open until 3am is another bonus. I don't know about Vegas, but in Chicago I can only think of Strings in Chinatown that is open that late.  It's actually a little cheaper than places in Chicago so I wonder what the price points will be when they open one here.  In the meantime, I've found a place to fill my ramen cravings when in Vegas.  Feeling generous, so I'll drop a fiver on this joint."}
{"text":"I arrived at Jinya shortly after midnight and was impressed to see how busy it was.  Small, but delicious. The menu is set up perfectly so you can satisfy your needs without over doing it. Most definitely on my ever growing list of late night dinner spots.  Happy hour ends at midnight  There's chicken strips that are killer & the quinoa salad is a staple. Of course don't forget the ramen! Go for skinny noodles!   And don't forget to check out the women's room! The toilet cost more than the daily revenue! It's all about the experience right?"}
{"text":"This is a cool little late night spot. First time here and we watched 3 other tables get here after us, order their food after us, and get their food before ours came out. One table even cashed out and left before our noodles came. The server was nice and the manager took care of the noodlles for us after we complained about the wait. But then it took forever for us to hunt down the check and we had to ask for the noodles to be removed lol. Food is good but service was mediocre at best."}
{"text":"Must try the tempura Brussel sprouts and french fries with ketchup in truffle oil!  The ramen was good too.  I got the #1 ramen soup with salad and gyoza. Very tasty! The ambience of the restaurant is good too. Nice decor! I will be back next time I go back to Vegas!"}
{"text":"Went for dinner with the family. Cute place, excellent food. I had the spicy chicken ramen, my daughter had the curry rice and the hubs had the tonkatsu ramen. Service was good. Took off one star because it look a long time to actually get our order, a lady who came in after us, placed her order after us, got her order first and finished eating, paid and left before we got our orders."}
{"text":"We had a great time @ this restaurant.  We were looking for ramen on a cold day in Dec. Nice hot bowl of noodles!  Took only 10 mins to get seated. There were lots of people waiting but the tables opened pretty fast.  Server was quick and checked back often. Drinks were always full.  Ramen was in my top 5. Spicy chicken was perfect. Double noodles meant I left a very full customer."}
{"text":"My favorite late night (open till 3am) happy hour places in vegas. Tako yaki is a favorite and Jinya has some of the best in town. Super fun and intimate place to go eat some ramen after hours. The vibe is more on the hip side so expect bass heavy music of a modern variety. Definitely a good place to eat, and meet up before or after going out with friends."}
{"text":"I love JINYA Ramen Bar!   Located on Flamingo, near Decatur.  Ate here dozens and dozens of times and happy almost every visit. I've brought many people for their first times and all enjoy themselves.   The wait can get pretty long, about 5-20 minutes is standard these days but worth it. They still have you sign a piece a paper to put yourself on a list, sometimes they say hello but overall they welcoming should be improved. The girls doing the seating are great but just overworked and it could be much better.   The noodles dishes are so good. The sprouting up ramen is my favorite. It was a seasonal one but it was so darn popular they remade the menu and added it on the very top, I get this almost every time and add pork sabaro and corn.   If you eat all the noodles and have broth you can pay to add more noodles and even get them to go. Add the seasonings they have on the table and be sure to get the fresh crushed garlic for free, I love crushing it into my noodles.   The cauliflower appetizer is great. Dessert has changed over the years but is always good and not to heavy or big.   Price are just right but wish they had a stamp card for locals to show some love to their repeat customers.   The staff all works hard and is great overall. It gets busy but most of the time they do very good.   It is a cool vibe in this place, I highly recommend going with friends, a date, or even by yourself as they got a great little bar to sit one or a huge table to seat a large group.   Thanks JINYA Ramen Bar!"}
{"text":"Date night called for a change from our go to sushi spot. Still wanting to eat somewhere where they have seaweed salad we picked Jenya! I have seen this restaurant so many times and figured it was a fast food restaurant because there is a drive thru. When we arrived I was very surprised! There was a twenty minute wait that went by fast but there was nowhere to sit or an actual lobby area. Everyone was standing awkwardly around but the service was fast once you sat down. It was happy hour we ordered two draft sapporos for 3 dollars a piece. Score! Started immediately with seaweed salad, spicy chicken and a pork bun. All of it was amazing! I recommend every single item! The servers use tablets which makes everything go by super fast I would say within 15 minutes we had our drinks our appetizers and our entrees. I got the spicy wonton and my boyfriend ordered the orginal ramen. We loved both. I ordered it spicy but still added some of the hot sauce they offer in it. I can't wait to come back to this place to try out other things as well!"}
{"text":"VERY DISAPPOINTED! This was my go to spot over Monta. I constantly raved about this place to my local and out of state friends & families. But after my most recent incident @ Jinya, I will no longer dine nor recommend this place to my friends & families.  Incident occurred on 12/18/16 @ 11:40pm on a busy night. I decided to order takeout after work since I needed comfort food bc I was sick. I waited at the host desk and stood in front of Christina, the host, and looked at her and she did not greet me even after exchanging eye contact. Instead she looked at me. Me as a customer, had to make the first initiative and asked Christina if I could see a takeout menu. She handed it to me & I stood in front of her while I looked at the menu for a good 5 minutes. I then proceeded and asked her if their is a combo meal that I could order to go and she replied yes. I continue to tell her my order and she responds, \"I'm sorry we are not taking any take orders at the moment because it is busy\".  I responded with, \"For future references, please put a sign at the front door to notify your customers that you are not accepting take out orders during busy hours\" as a common courtesy and to save your customers time. I asked to speak with the shift manager for the night, Adam. I also informed Adam that at a professional standpoint put a sign at the entrance as common courtesy. He then then told me that, \"THEY ARE TAKING ORDERS DURING BUSY HOURS ITS JUST THAT THERE IS A 30 MINUTE WAIT\". I told Adam that I was told differently by Christina that you guys are not taking orders. He apologized for the mistake, BUT I WAS AT THE POINT OF AGGRAVATION AND NO LONGER WANTED TO CONTINUE TO BE A CUSTOMER OF JINYA BECAUSE:  1) CHRISTINA THE HOST WAS NOT FRIENDLY NOR DID SHE GREET ME 2) I SPECIFICALLY ASKED FOR A TAKEOUT MENU TO ORDER TAKEOUT. INSTEAD OF NOTIFYING ME BEFOREHAND ABOUT NOT ACCEPTING TAKEOUT ORDERS, SHE HANDS ME THE MENU 3) I CONTINUE TO ASK IF TAKEOUT ORDERS COME WITH A COMBO MEAL AND SHE REPLIES \"YES\" & STILL FAILS TO TELL ME THEY ARE NOT ACCEPTING TAKEOUT ORDERS 4) THE TOPPING ON THE CAKE IS HOW SHE MISINFORMED ME ABOUT NO TAKEOUT ORDERS, BC ACCORDING TO THE SHIFT MANAGER ADAM, ITS A 30 MINUTE WAIT  I'm a very patient person. I know a lot about patience from being a special needs mom with a medically fragile child. So it has taught me to take things with a grain of salt. If I was notified before hand the moment I asked for a takeout menu that there will be a 30 minute wait. I would have been perfectly fine with it. But unfortunately, your host Christina was unprofessional! She needs to be trained to greet your customers, especially if they are standing at the host desk directly in front of her. Train her to inform her customers before hand with the correct information. Thanks to her I will no longer dine nor recommend this place."}
{"text":"Great noodles ! Best PHO . But always busy, they should expand a little more so they could have more customers coming in. But it's still good!"}
{"text":"This is a great place to get ramen when you're just on your own, or with a group of friends. I went to this ramen bar May 11, 2016 during the evening with a group of friends.  Atmosphere: Not too distracting The music was a bit loud upon getting seated at our table, but it wasn't anything too detrimental to our experience. The floors and tables are clean and we were seated comfortably.  Service: Very reasonable For my party, we were given our food in a timely manner and were all served at the same time. The waitress was kind enough to lower the music for us since it was a bit too loud and was very polite upon serving us our food. All the questions we had about the menu were answered by the waiter and we were all satisfied by what we were all served.  Food: Excellent! At Jinya, you get exactly what you order. The food met all of my expectations and the presentation of the menu items was spectacular. Our food was all full of flavor and all the items we ordered stayed true to what was described by both our waiter and the menu.  Overall: Willing to return! The food was excellent, service was spot-on. I am definitely a fan of this ramen restaurant. Definitely worth the money and time. Stop by to this place if you get a chance!"}
{"text":"I'm going to give Jinya a 4 because there's nothing wrong with the food... In fact it's pretty good... but at this point it's gonna take a lot to blow me away with ramen.   We've tried going to Jinya a few times but always turn away when we see the lines out the door (at all hours). However, I now know this is misleading because we got seated right away and the place is huge compared to the other ramen spots. Jinya is definitely \"trendier\" than the other places as well, with younger, hipper servers. We sat at the bar which was a tight squeeze and ordered a couple draft Sapporos, Jinya buns, and tempura brussels sprouts to start. All of the above was great and I appreciate the diversity and creativity of their appetizer menu.   Now we all have a ramen type that we can't help but gravitate towards when going to a new ramen restaurant. For me it's anything SPICY. Sure spicy isn't a flavor profile but I like my ramen spicy, okay? Unfortunately Jinya doesn't offer all of their ramens spicy, they have a few labeled as spicy and I chose the Tonkotsu Spicy and my boyfriend had the Umami Spicy Miso. Given all the new and different types of ramen Jinya offers I shouldn't have gone with something so boring but I did and it was... boring. And not spicy. The miso though was quite good, with a deep peppery taste that was unlike anything I've ever had in a ramen. The ground pork was also great and reminded me of a tan tan men more than a miso ramen. I like that Jinya offers \"unusual\" toppings like garlic and bamboo shoot. I guess I should have branched out a bit more with something like cilantro or sukiyaki ramen because it looks like that's what helps Jinya stand out. I can't say if these variations are gimmicks or if they actually elevate the ramen experience but I guess that's for another time. For now it'll be hard to pry me away from my spicy ramen at Tatsu and Sora now that I've officially tried all the top ramen shops in Vegas."}
{"text":"Had lunch here today. Sat at the bar as j was solo. Order wonton ramen with extra noodles. Reggae music playing with loud bass and a great vibe inside.   Waiter was quick to order and it took forever to get my ramen 30 minutes. Place was half empty. There was a person from the health department doing a routine inspection and the kitchen is the size of a small closet so one extra nosy body in there was one too many. Slowed things down. Inspector made them throw away some eggs in the fridge that were not at the right temperature ( like 75 of them in a sauce/ marinade) but all else seemed cool   Ramen was good, a little bland and the extra noodles were too much. Plenty of noodles come with it. All in all a fun place with decent ramen. I'm not a ramen snob, it all tastes good to me so it's worth a trip unless you are a ramen snob. Then you should go write a post about being a ramen snob."}
{"text":"Good place to Go And eat with friends good music good food good environment but the service we got by a busser was not professional they just need to give more hospitality so ppl can come back more often I wish the wait was not too long but is good food !"}
{"text":"I have eaten here twice. I have tried the tonkatsu black and the spicy tonkatsu. Both were unpleasantly salty so it was hard to enjoy the food. There was very little broth to accompany the default amount of toppings and noodles.   The takoyaki had excellent texture but taste was bland. The crispy chicken was not crispy. I love making karaage chicken and I can tell that they dumped way too much chicken into the potato starch to where the coating became gummy instead of crispy when fried."}
{"text":"One of the ONLY ramen spots in LA that offers a delicious vegan option. One of my best friends (who is pescatarian) has been to almost every ramen shop in LA (yup, there's a lot) and comes across a lot of \"boring\" vegan broths. The SPICY CREAMY VEGAN RAMEN at JINYA is by far her favorite. It's really tasty and is true to its name... both spicy (but not too spicy) AND creamy. BUT DON'T GET THE VEGETABLE SOUP RAMEN. My friend said she was SUPER bummed last time she went there and they were out of the Spicy Creamy Vegan so she tried the Vegetable Soup Ramen. She said it was a bummer and bland in comparison.   I've tried the JINYA Tonkotsu Black and it was GREAT. Tasty, but not too salty. Hits the spot.  And who doesn't love a good mochi ice cream dessert to top you off ;)  Overall, I recommend this place for a quick ramen fix, especially on a cold day. Oh and try the Tokyo Curry rice... YUMMY!   Also, the construction is done so there is great parking! Convenient and easy."}
{"text":"Great ramen place. I believe this used to be a location for golden griddle but it got revamped into a ramen joint.  We went on a Friday night and it was quite empty.  The food was good and so was the service; I would definitely return to try something else.  Good: 4/5, I got the sprout something ramen.  The broth was unique in that it tasted a bit more greasy than normal but not very salty.  The runny egg and vegetables were good but I wonder if they fry the ingredients or I could use less oil next time.  The takoyaki was also very tasty.  Service: 3/5, relatively attentive and they greeted us with a smile.  Ambience: 3/5, a bit odd with the music choice and felt more like an italian restaurant with louder than normal music vs. other asian restaurants.  The decor was simple and fit the music.  Price: 3/5, average around $15 per ramen and a bit more for drinks and appetizers - you can expect to spend around $25 per person."}
{"text":"This place is a MUST when we go to vegas!   Tako yaki, shrimp balls, gyoza, spicy umami ramen is our picks"}
{"text":"The ramen is ok but the service is bad. Bunch of people in the kitchen but I walked in and stood at the host desk for 10 minutes before someone acknowledged my existence. There are better places in town and that's where I will take my money"}
{"text":"Ramen here is ok. Good but not amazing. Maybe I wasn't in the right mood for this restaurant. I was in the mood for a good bowl of ramen. Nothing more and nothing less. Ramen is my comfort  food when I'm tired. Wasn't in the mood for a restaurant blasting loud music. Not when I'm eating ramen...  The food is ok/good. Not bad. But I don't know if I was in the mood for $50 ramen restaurant bill for two. The soup is tasty upfront but a bit too thick and heavy.  I can see people liking this restaurant. It's just not for me. I would recommend to go to this place if you want a decent (ok to good) ramen with trendy ambiance and loud music."}
{"text":"Locally well known, but for people coming from out of town, it's a hidden gem. China town in general has the best food in Vegas"}
{"text":"#WHATSYOURSLURPGAME  Blown the f away by this beaut that has finally arrived from the homeland (LA or van city, I think). The place is aesthetically pleasing and the service was great throughout the entire experience. Our server was Maggie and she was extremely pleasant and didn't mind my friend's many requests.   I came here originally because I saw on instagram that they offered vegan ramen. For someone who is in love with ramen and has not had it in 4 months, the idea of vegan ramen stole my heart and I definitely needed to try. It had silken tofu, greens, fresh garlic (added free of charge), scallions, sesame seeds and to my surprise, it was SO creamy - exactly the way I loved my pork infused, dairy filled ramen broth back in the day. I instantly fell in love and could've cried on the spot. I found love. I FOUND LOVE, AND I'M NEVER LETTING IT GO. #VegansNeedRamenToo  I loved it because I didn't feel that sickly bloated feeling I used to feel when I'd try to be a kinton bowler. None of the dairy/meat shenanigans. Just tofu and veggies to fill up a hungry girl. I also enjoyed the fact that it wasn't covered in oil, like most ramen places like to douse their dishes with. My friend had the cha cha, and the portion was HUGE. The noodles were plenty, like, more than the typical ramen place when you order extra noodles! It was a garlic lover's dream. He even got the fresh garlic, which he minced himself (with struggles..) on top of his ramen and it soaked up the rich flavour of the broth immediately. He was falling in love with his ramen by the second. The noodles were super duper fresh and the texture was great as well!  You guys, you cannot believe how estastic I am to find such a gem in t.o, ramen was one of my favourite things and to find one that is not only vegetarian, BUT VEGAN!?!?!? AND it tastes the same as a creamy pork broth?! Down. Sooooooo down.  I'm literally going back. Every time I'm in the downtown core. You can bet on it."}
{"text":"I love this place! Their ramen is so delicious. Seriously full of flavor. I get their vegetarian one and add lots of spicy stuff to it plus a season egg, oh my gosh amazing! Just writing this makes me want to go back ASAP."}
{"text":"We waited about 20min but, soon as we got seated and placed our order everything came out quickly and food was really good (I heard good things about this place prior coming and it was still better than expected) if you're vegan, you don't even have to look for anything else try spicy vegan ramen it was so flavorful and satisfying...I didn't think ramen could be so filling. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Love love love this place. Sucks that I live in n. Las Vegas cause I want to go here more. Also they ruined \"normal\" ramen for me. I can't seem to enjoy noodle soup from the grocery store anymore. Ahhhhh. None the less it was amaze, and when I'm down there again I will totally go again."}
{"text":"The food was absolutely delicious. You must try the shrimp balls!! Took my bf for the first time to eat Ramen and he loved it!! The ambience was perfect also. Great music"}
{"text":"Came here with my family on my birthday wanting to eat some delicious food. We had ditched our usual Ramen house, wanting to try it here due to the good reviews we've heard about this place. However, the wait time took forever even though we were the third one on the waiting list. Those before us were seated along with plenty more that came after us even though there were plenty of seats that could accommodate my family of six.      When we were finally seated, we were placed on a big table with other customers that made my family sit away from us. I requested to be seated on adjacent booths so at least that way, my family would be closer. My request was denied because it was seen as \"inconvenient\" to the hostess, because it was her job to seat the customers. This small request would require her to move us to different tables. How this small request could be seen as \"inconvenient \" is beyond me. All I asked was to be seated with my family, we were willing to give up our own seats for other parties while we occupy the smaller booths.      Denied, we sat spread apart, resulting in having to eat with our dampened moods. The food we ate was not as delicious as I heard it was, disappointed with the reviews, and the waiter kept on insisting we try the dessert despite our refusal. Also, they kept on disturbing our eating time by constantly picking up our trash, taking the dishes, and refilling our water  before the cup is even half empty! It is safe to say that my family and I will never be coming back here. Instead we will be going back to our regular Ramen house, monta."}
{"text":"JINYA have a diverse menu compared to most Ramen restaurants in Las Vegas. They offer dishes to add onto your ramen like pork gyoza, Tokyo curry rice and crispy chicken. JINYA also has an additional page of tapas, rice bowls and desserts.   My waitress recommended the pork bun to start. At $3.80 it was the most expensive single pork bun I have ordered. It arrived on a small black plate with a toothpick in the center to hold it together.  It ended up being a reasonable size for the high price. The bun was fluffy and unlike most pork belly the meat was lean. It was also very tender but I thought the lettuce in the bun was unnecessary and would have done better with just the cucumber. The sauce did not pack enough punch for me so I mixed the house made ramen sauce and chili sauce to dip the rest of the bun into.   For my ramen, I decided on the chicken ramen because my waitress said it was her favorite and had just as much flavor as the pork broth without being too rich. She was right, it was the most flavorful chicken ramen broth I have had. It was rich, creamy, but the noodles were too chewy for my taste.   JINYA ramen has a much better chicken broth than any of the other ramen restaurants I have been to in town. Their three house made sauces are well executed and their diverse menu will bring me back even if I am not in the mood for ramen."}
{"text":"I would keep this easy and simple.. less salt would good cuz everything was so salty.. I'm not a big fan of ramen noodles but even my wife she love ramen she still agree with me that the food doesn't taste the same than it use to be."}
{"text":"Hands down the best ramen, I always order the tonkotsu black non spicy, the soup is what separates it from the rest, I have tried izakaya go and ichiza's ramen, nothing compared to jin ya, also the best takoyaki in town!"}
{"text":"Great service! Lots of different ramen. We got the cha cha, sprouting and spicy chicken. Our 4th person is a vegan but they were out of the creamy vegan broth. He had the quinoa salad it was very good. The baby green salad dressing wasn't very tasty. The dressing missed the mark. The directions say the broth is hot and everything on top is cold including the meat and egg. The spicy chicken broth was even cold. We asked to reheat it but it still was cold. Loved all the garlic!"}
{"text":"Delicious Ramen!! Restaurant has a good atmosphere as well, small but comfortable. We also ordered Spicy Creamy Shrimp Tempura which was excellent!"}
{"text":"This definitely is not my favourite place to eat. It is supposedly japanese fusion but seemed to me to be exactly like vietnamese food.. however.. I like vietnamese food better because the portion sizes are way bigger!  This was just too bland and flavourless for me."}
{"text":"Addicted to this place. I come here 2-3 times a week. Spicy chicken ramen with corn is my jam!! And Pork Chasu will be one of my death row last meal requests for sure. Lol. A bit of a wait sometimes but that's coz it's sooo good. Staff is helpful and cool. Late night happy hour on drinks and appetizers. But you must get the ramen. Happy slurping"}
{"text":"Love everything about this place. Beautiful interior, nice playlist, great service, and phenomenal food.  JINYA provided the best ramen experience that we have had in quite a while. The takoyaki was better than any I have tried before, so satisfying and mouthwatering! Their tonkotsu black ramen was delicious and full of flavor, which makes me wonder - why have I never tried garlic with ramen before? The almond tofu dessert was also a dream, although I barely had any because my date nearly devoured it whole. We also ordered a lycheetini and even that was a delicious and refreshing treat.  This place is probably my favorite in terms of Las Vegas ramen restaurants and I am eager to have many more meals here. As they say, \"No ramen, no life!\""}
{"text":"Jinya  has disappointed me. I used to visit regularly but they recently changed the menu and took off one of my favorite soups, upped the price big time and now serve smaller portions. I was shocked when the server brought out the same large bowl I'm used to but with a splash of soup and ramen at the bottom of the bowl! Smh I have not returned since.     Service is always very spotty and the servers seem to always put in my order late because they are more focused on the larger tables.  My other favorite spot is not too far away and always has a long wait time but I will plan ahead and just go there instead. Jinya has lost me as a customer."}
{"text":"I came here with a group of 6. I ordered the tonkotsu white $10.50 + tax. We did not get our ramen together nor in close timing. I was the first to receive mine.  I waited for a while for every one else's bowls to arrive but eventually I caved and started eating. When I finished, there were still 3 people in my group still waiting for ramen. When I compared my bowl with other's, mine seemed to have less noodles in it. I did not feel full after finishing my bowl and i even helped some of the people in my group finish theirs. Regarding the tonkotsu ramen, the soup broth was pretty salty even for ramen standards. Tonkotsu soup should be white however it wasnt; although it was cloudy. The thin noodles were good, slightly chewy. I added fresh garlic, crushing it myself with a provided tool. It kind of puts the work on the customer which i dont really approve of? But it was a free topping so... yeah. They also had a ramen sauce which had a lot of garlic inside (this place really likes garlic huh). The ramen also came with 2 chunks of cha siu which i thought were too big and thick for ramen eating. The taste was also not enjoyable as other places. No sweetness. The most notable toppings were the 1/2 egg and 2 pieces of cha siu which for ramen is not a lot. The other toppings: onions, kikurage although nice, does not add value to the meal. I did not even find any fried onions. I feel the the price is not really fair for what you get. I had the chance to taste the Tokyo Yatai. The broth had a very powerful taste of chicken flavor and not the good kind. More like pure chicken fat or grease that was not skimmed. The takoyaki sat  on a bed of minced egg with bonito flakes and had a drizzle of sauce. I found it quite difficult to eat the toppings with the takoyaki as they were underneath. There were a lot of toppings on the plate. The overall taste was creamy rather than sweet sour savoury (there was only a little bit of sauce put on). A friend of mine had the tonkotsu black. I found that there was barely any different from mine for an extra $2 (add nori, garlic chips, garlic oil, add. half an egg). The Cha cha cha bowl was recommended for garlic lovers at a premium price of $13.50 however does not contain any garlic in it... not even garlic chips or oil. You could order the cheapest ramen and add free minced fresh garlic or the ramen sauce with garlic in it instead. The most unique thing about that bowl was that it had \"korean powder\" and \"fish powder\" (are we getting instant noodles?).  It did have a lot of onions and bean sprouts on top though... cheap ingredients."}
{"text":"We came here late in the evening after i arrived back to Vegas.  I had been on the United Diet so I was in the mood for some really good food.  I had noticed several of my fellow Yelpers checking int to Jinya so after bookmarking it a couple of months ago decided to give them a try.  I must say I was not disappointed.  The fact they are a chain restaurant is surprising as they have the feel of a local place.      The decor is modern and inviting.  The staff was very friendly and made the evening special.  We were all in the mood for some Ramen and looking at their selection was kinda exciting. They have a pretty good selection of unique flavored Ramen so choosing one was challenging.     We started off with the Jinya Buns which were delicious.  The bun itself was very tasty and the pork inside melted in your mouth.  We also had the Jinya Dynamite which was also a special treat.  Unities in flavor and so tasty.  The heat level was very good and it was hot even to the last bite.  The Gyoza were really good but unfortunately my daughter hoarded most of them so I only got one.      The Ramen was just what we needed.  It had been some time since we had had Ramen and all 3 of us were dying to try theirs.  I had the Tokyo Tonkotsu,  my garlic loving daughter had the Cha Cha Cha (for garlic lovers) and the wife had the Tonkotsu Assari.  the noodles were perfect and the pork was tasty and plentiful.  What stood out to me was the broth.  They all three had very good broth which had a depth of flavors.   I truly enjoyed their Ramen and will definitely some back soon to enjoy it again."}
{"text":"I loved their ramen and egg noodle. Very delicious food with decent pricing. I would come back to eat again in my next visit at Las Vegas. Recommended"}
{"text":"Kids and I absolutely LOVE coming here~ food is amazing, and we always feel welcome!! You won't leave hungry"}
{"text":"The best ramen in town. I've tried Monta more than a couple times, but I'm usually not that impressed. I've tried a couple other places in town, and none will ever come close to my forever favorite Sapporo-ya in San Francisco's Japantown...  But Jinya is close to the house, very friendly, and pretty delicious. :) So, definitely worth considering it the best in town."}
{"text":"This place was amazing!! My great friend Jessica suggested this spot and I will be going here all the time !! I had the garlic lovers bowl OMG it was delicious i was NOT expecting this !! We also had the pork belly bau and these fried brussel sprouts omg my mouth is watering lol i will have to go back here ASAP"}
{"text":"Ramen was excellent.  Prices are usual at $12/bowl for the regular ramen.  Tonkatsu ramen is what we had and it was good.  The takoyaki was good as well but I felt like it could have been fried a bit longer because it got soggy very quick, especially on the bottom.   Flavor is good, the deviled egg creamy sauce on the bottom was good and interesting, the generous portion of bonito flakes was also very pleasant.  Problem is that there was to much dough and not enough octopus.   The prices are decent.  Most notably, the price of the takoyaki is surprisingly cheap, which was only $5.50 for 6 balls.   *I am able to compare takoyaki properly because the one I've had in Japan is superb, even at the chain restaurants. Always crispy and always full of flavor and depth."}
{"text":"Favorite ramen place I have found in Vegas. So yummy!!! I'm not sure the full name but I always order the black ramen extra spicy. Never been disappointed"}
{"text":"I've tried several ramen bars in Calgary but Jinya is the best one for me!! They have excellent customer service.   We ordered their Jinya Tonkotsu Black and Premium Tonkotsu White and both were very rich in flavor, not too salty. However, I feel like the servings were so small (or maybe we were just hungry that time). The good thing is that you can ask for additional noodles for $3.  I would also recommend their Jinya buns. I think it's $4 each but totally worth it!!"}
{"text":"Best ramen I have had! The vegan ramen is the most amazing ramen ever! Every time I get a chance I come here! It's amazing! The staff is always really nice and helpful and the environment is chill and nicely decorated."}
{"text":"The restaurant is really nice inside, it's nicely decorated and has a good amount of seating. There are plenty of options for everyone, including vegetarians. They are also very accommodating with adding to/changing the ramen.  I don't eat meat, but I'm ok with broths. I ordered the Cilantro Chicken Wanton Ramen. I took out the chicken wantons and added tofu and broccoli instead. The soup had amazing flavor and the noodles were delicious. The portions are excellent as well.  The staff was incredibly friendly and I would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Our server was great and just so nice, but it didn't make up for the food.  I had ramen throughout Toronto and had the real thing in Tokyo. However, Jinya's ramen was one word \"disappointing.\" The flavours were just meh and the texture was meh. The experience as a whole was just meh.   I had the tacoyaki, which was more mayo than octopus. My ramen was more a stew than actual ramen. Overall, it's overpriced for the quality of food you're getting. I paid more than $50 with tip, but I'd pay only $15 for what we actually got.   I won't be back and I'm not missing anything."}
{"text":"I came here during late night happy hr time and damn this place is popping. I wish they use better noodles and the broth could be  a little more seasoned and less starchy. Don't get me wrong. I love creamy creamy soup but this place just over did it. However, the salmon poke tacos are pretty delicious tho. 3 dollars for 5 giant fried chicken is such a steal."}
{"text":"Really just so so.  There are such super great reviews on this restaurant - my conclusion is that the selection of good ramen places in Vegas are limited and compared to all, they maybe good?  To start with, majority of the patrons (90%) are non Asian, at least at the lunch time we were there, thus my guess is that the reviews are really not the Asian standards of what a good bowl of ramen should be.  It is so great that they have a kids menu.  For $7.50, you get a small bowl of chicken ramen with corn and spinach; 2 crispy chicken, small bowl of chicken and rice, slice of orange, lollipop and a small vanilla ice cream.  I would say that was the highlight of the whole meal.  For the adults, we ordered the Tokyo ramen special, which is just the to tonkatsu (pork) soup base with skinny ramen noodles with cha siu and a soft boiled egg.  If you were to go to an authentic ramen place, they would boil the broth for each table, not just scooped out the broth from a big pot.  At this place, you know they just scooped the broth out and assemble the toppings and bring it to the table.  Out ramen came quick before our appetizers (hint).  The broth was not hot (which it should be).  Disappointed!!!  Now come the food - we ordered the Brussels sprouts tempura, it was really good because they put truffle oil in their tempura batter so it was very fragrant.  The crispy chicken was also tasty.  Authentic Tonkatsu broth should be white or close to it, it was brown so assume they add quiet a bit of soy sauce, which made the broth quiet salty.  Oh and by the way, everyone in the kitchen was non Asian.  OH AND there are no Japanese restaurant (at least not the authentic Japanese restaurant) that will charge you $1 for tea.  Tea or water supposed to be complimentary.  We are not at an American restaurant asking for a cup of tea or coffee that is on the menu.  Very disappointed considering we purposely took uber to come for this ramen place which supposedly have such great review"}
{"text":"Yummm! Can't blame for having a wait list all the time. Location is too Damn small. Expand!!!"}
{"text":"This place is one of the better ramen joints in Las Vegas. The broth and noodles are well made. We had the tonkatsu spicy and the Jinya tonkatsu black ramens. The tonkatsu spicy is made with their thick noodles and the black is made with their thin noodles. I liked the broth of the spicy but preferred the thin noodles that come with the tonkatsu black ramen. Next time I'll order the tonkatsu spicy with the thin noodles. Overall, both good ramens.  I highly recommend the Pork Chashu and kimchee tacos! The pork is nice and tender combined with a great crunch from the fried taco shells. The kimchee adds a nice saltiness to the tacos. An order comes with 2 tacos and is a perfect appetizer.   Service is very quick and attentive. The restaurant was packed but our food came out quick and easy. Good experience overall."}
{"text":"Wow. Came back here and HUGELY disappointed. JINYA has stopped serving high quality, traditional ramen and instead catered to the masses of non-Japanese people pouring in.  The food- 3 or 4 stars. The tapas are all really good. The tacos are great. The JINYA bun is very special- the bun is AMAZING. However, they switched out the special cucumber and sauce with a ton of lettuce and the beautiful, delicious pork belly was traded out with a tough, tiny pork belly. VERY disappointed. The JINYA  black is good, solid 4 stars, but there are a multitude of other ramen options nearby that are better.   Service- the wait time was VERY long. Crazy line. Luckily, for 5 people, we were able to sit at the bar. Come before 5 or be prepared to wait anywhere from 30 mins to over an hour. The waiters and staff were fine, pretty nice and standard. Almost none of them were Japanese (none of the cooks) which is a bad sign. It took 45 MINUTES FOR RAMEN. Ramen bars are supposed to be quick, simple restaurants serving authentic food, but instead a much longer, complicated menu takes forever. Also, they seemed to be only making to-go orders! If you're waiting more than 5-10 minutes for your ramen, that's not good. The Tonkotsu Black was good, the Miso Ramen was good, and the chicken buns were good.    Overall, it's time to pick a new Ramen place. Monta, on my opinion, is by far the best, although the wait is foreverrrrrrr. Ramen Tatsu is great and so is Ramen Sora. Just because everyone just found this place doesn't mean it's that good."}
{"text":"The food is so good and the atmosphere is cozy. The food portions are quite large which is great for leftovers. It's probably some of the best ramen I've ever had. I definitely recommend."}
{"text":"We want more!  We want more!  We want more!  Crunchy salmon poke tacos that is.  Those were so delicious!  I almost ordered another two of them cuz they're so tasty!  They're a new Chef's special appetizer.  Special indeed!  For our ramens, we requested Cha cha for garlic lovers, and Karaage chicken which was another Chef's special.  No regrets!  They were ramen-liciously perfect and different.  Broth flavor was nice.  Then the ingredients in the soup added yet more great flavor.  And the noodles are either regular or fat, good texture too.  We still look like out of towners, so I'm not sure if that's why we received such attentive service.  But we loved it.  If that's the case everyone should look like an out of towner.  And you'll want to come in during their happy hours cuz they have TWO happy hour slots.  This restaurant is clean, industrial modern design - very sleek.  Table layout is well planned especially for how the servers need to move about.  It's a tiny space, but due to the floor plan and high ceilings it does not feel cramped.  They play cool lounge music too.  Their menu isn't overwhelming and the Chef's creations are kinds we haven't seen before.  If you're a tourist in Las Vegas, and love ramen and creative fusion, you'll want to bookmark this restaurant.  I have to give 5 stars!  Ambience, lounge music, clean and simple but classy chill atmosphere, great food, serves unique alcohol, two happy hours, splendid service...  P.S. Try their panna cotta - creamy not too sweet and may cure a pouting face."}
{"text":"THE BEST RAMEN IN TOWN! This is by the far the best place to get ramen! I love getting the sprouting up ramen with T H I C K noodles, tempura style fried Brussels sprouts, tofu, pork, seasoned egg and too many other things that I'm now drooling for... the price is great, the wait is usually 10 to 20minutes not going to lie, but it is WORTH IT!! Don't forget to sign in when you come in or you'll lose your spot!"}
{"text":"I always come here for their delicious ramen! Hands down I think they have the best takoyaki I've ever had in Vegas. Although it can be a long wait at night, it's totally worth every minute. Thanks for keeping my cravings satisfied. :)"}
{"text":"Tonight was my first time trying a ramen bar, and after a friends recommendation I decided to give it a try.   Jinya is a very small establishment, but don't let the size fool you! The place gets packed, and you'll see people outside waiting to be called. I like that there's plenty of parking space, and thankfully we didn't have to wait very long.  I had the Spicy Chicken Ramen and it was very good! Tons of flavors with every bite! I added an egg to make it a little creamy, which made it taste even better! Our waiter was very kind, answered any/all questions we had, and constantly checked in on us!   I'll def be back with my younger siblings as it'll be their first time, and I now know that Jinya won't disappoint!"}
{"text":"Spicy Chicken Ramen and Jinya bun are to die for. My favorite ramen spot. Just be prepared to wait a while to be seated."}
{"text":"sorry to post a negative review but the food and service were pretty bad..  there were more than enough number of staff members but they worked as if they were short staffed. A girl who seemed to be the manager or hostess looked so stressed out by her servers.  Food I dont expect so much out of Calgary anyway, but the service they should do something about it.."}
{"text":"The service was bad here for my first time here. Server took about 20-25 minutes to take our order. The restaurant was not busy. Ordered the tonkotsu ramen combination with fried chicken and salad. The salad was awfully expired tasting as it was put in the freezer when bad salad is about to go bad and put in freezer doesnt make it fresh. The ramen came out warm not pipping hot like im used to and did not enjoy this. The fried chicken was pipping hot and  delicious. The bill came out fast and rudely while eating the bill  just got passed over and they werent even closing. Did not enjoy the eating experience here especially with all the ramen places in radius."}
{"text":"There are many ramen shops in Vegas now and Jinya is the one that offers more variety in the sides menu as I known so far. Even if you don't like ramen, there are rice choices too, like really yummy chicken and pork rice bowl we tried. We always order chicken karaage   in Japanese restaurants  and Jinya's  is pretty good but  the whole family agrees that yu-yu's  karage is still the best. I do not like the crispy rice tuna , because the soft tuna and the harder crispy rice, just didn't taste right. Anyhow, the takoyaki is the best as other's suggested with the tender octopus inside and crispy outside. I love the homemade tofu, but the dashi sauce might be little too sour.  Anyways, I strongly recommend Jinya ramen and looking forward to see who will win the ramen war in Vegas."}
{"text":"Gave this place a chance today hoping I can prove the 3.5star average wrong.  So I was, except it was worse than 3.5stars.  Frigid cold today at -17 with that windchill.  Perfect day for a bowl of steaming hot ramen.  It's a 9min walk to Jinya or a 10min walk to Santouko.  I've been to the latter several times so I thought I'd try out Jinya.    Well, I wish I took the extra minute walk to Santouko instead.    Food:  It is definitely pricier than your popular ramen house.  Quite a bit pricier about $2-6 more per bowl of ramen.  That was already a shock.  Especially for a lunch on a Wednesday.  My go to is usually the garlicky broth so I ordered the black Tonkotsu.  I wanted thin noodles and there's no substitution on the Cha cha cha which came with extra thick noodles.  This confused me.  Then I tried to make a substitution on an addition.  I thought, how about an order of Kaarage don.  Mostly because my eyes are always bigger than my stomach but also I wasn't sure when I'll be back so I wanted to try more than 1 item on the menu.  Anyway, they had an option for crispy chicken and salad for an additional $5.75 (I believe...just check the menu I attached).  Server said it's hard cause their menu is pretty set and it's basically 3 pieces of chicken on a bed of greens.  So...its not quite a salad is it?  And seriously, how much is rice?  So, no flexibility here.  Anyway so I ordered takoyaki.  It was interesting.  I've never seen takoyaki served on a bed of egg salad.  Nice touch on the egg salad.  It was bland though.  It needed salt.  The black Tonkotsu was odd tasting.  It had a dolop of red pepper paste which made the broth have the most miniscule heat but also a sweetness. There's also an off putting burnt smell and taste and it wasn't the garlic either.  The seasoned egg was served whole.  It should really be cut in half it looks better on the bowl.  Anyway, ramen was a bit of fail.  Service:  They were nice and attentive.  I won't fault them for the inflexibility of the restaurant for options/substitutions.  I do fault the kitchen for taking forever to serve though.  I think it took them 15-20min for my ramen.  The restaurant was predominantly empty.  I don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"Not exactly 4 stars but more like 3.5 stars. Food was decent but not as good as Monta Very very nice staff. Very nice decor. Lighting was too dark and music was way too loud. Was really disappointed that they didn't have any Japanese fried rice!! Had some other tapas that was ok but not really a Raman Raman place... They had tapas that you can pair together with a Raman which is nice but Raman house to me is Raman, gyoza, and fried rice. Heads up, just stick to the pork broth and skip the chicken broth Raman"}
{"text":"Bigger place than Monta ramen. Spicy ramen delicios. My wife get tonkatsu ramen.takoyaki so yummy too"}
{"text":"Omg fell in love....this place is the Bomb!!! The flavors were absolutely delicious...I have wanted to eat here everyday since I have been...lol....can't wait to come back!!!"}
{"text":"My entire experience at JINYA was quite disappointing. First of all, I arrived at around 8pm on a Saturday and was seated next to the window next to a couple that was constantly making out. Given that there were so many other empty seats, I found it weird that the waitress chose that seat for me.   There were only two \"main\" items on the menu--spicy chicken ramen and karaage ramen. The other ramen were on the side. I got the tonkotsu pork ramen. I also ordered a glass of water but it didn't arrive until 5 minutes later.   Now onto the ramen. The portion was very small; there was very little noodles. The broth was okay but it was only lukewarm. There was one piece of meat and one whole egg. The entire bowl of ramen seemed like it wasn't well prepared.   During my dining, I put my chopsticks down to use my phone. A waitress immediately came over and wanted to clear my table. There was nobody lining up; I didn't know why she was trying to rush me out. The small bowl of ramen cost me more than $16 after tax, which is much more expensive than other ramen stores.   I wouldn't recommend JINYA since their ramen is expensive and not up to par, and their service isn't either."}
{"text":"I like this place a lot.   The ramen isn't quite as good as Sora's, but they have a better selection of appetizers, drinks (both alcoholic and nonalcoholic), and larger variety of ramen.   For vegetarians, they have a vegetarian ramen, and for those who don't want pork, there's chicken ramen.   There's never a line, and they are going to add a drive-thru soon. Service is friendly and fast as well.  Lastly, they're open until 3am, making them the obvious choice for late night dinners.  Personal favorites: Takoyaki, Spicy Tonkatsu, Spicy Chicken Ramen, and Crispy Rice."}
{"text":"My friend was always raving about this place and I'm a HUGE sucker for Ramen. Figured we would give it a shot. My favorite ramen place by me closed down so finding a new spot is hard.  We were greeted very nicely and sat right away. We sat at the Ramen Bar. Server was polite and friendly. He sold us a drink they didn't have but was very apologetic about it. Didn't matter to us we were there for Ramen.  I was really hungry so I had the Pork Bao Buns. They weren't the best I've ever had. The pork was just TOO fatty. Flavor was still good. The mayo and the cucumbers on it paired well. Didn't know mayo would be good with Pork. They are $4 for each bun. Good pricing. (I give it a 3/5)  The seaweed salad was 2.80$ and was a massive bowl. Really healthy and great portion size. Can even eat for an appetizer or side. It is inevitable you will always have seaweed salad stuck in your teeth lol. (I give it a 5/5)  The Ramen was great. I kind of customized my own because I'm THAT guy lol. I got thin noodles, Tonkotsu broth, cabbage and 3 eggs. I love eggs in my Ramen and they cooked them perfectly, plus they were so tasty.  I suggest adding more eggs to yours because it only comes with one. (I give it a 4/5)  For 3 people. 3 apps. 3 bowls of Ramen. 3 drinks we spent $69. Great pricing for a great meal and night out. Thank you again Jinya, I shall be back!! Pricing- I give it a 5/5"}
{"text":"On the fence between giving this place 3.5 to 4 stars. I was really excited for this place since the chain is from LA and I had really good ramen in LA (see my review for Daikokuya in Little Tokyo) but for some reason, we live in Calgary where it seems no one can get ramen right 100%...  If you are driving, there's paid street parking in Mission but if you visit for dinner after 6pm, street parking is free.  I visited the first day they opened - we came at 5pm (before the dinner rush) and did not have to wait for a table. Our server was understanding when a few of our friends were late, and still seated us even though we did not have the whole group there.   I had the tonkatsu black with a combo of salad and rice bowl on the side. The description had said the ramen would be spicy, but it was not noticeable in mine. Unlike most places that give you a choice between lean and fatty pork pieces, our ramens were served with fatty pork (which some people like and some do not - all personal preference). My broth was very rich and flavourful - it was so thick and it seemed very gelatinous which again can be good or bad based on personal preference. I had the thin noodles and I thought they were cooked well.   Although the combo was good value (+$5), I don't think I would recommend because the rice bowl was mediocre at best. I only ordered it because the portions of the ramen looked smaller than most places (which it is) but next time I will try an appetizer instead. The crispy chicken that was an option for a combo was fresh and served piping hot which I appreciated, but again, I didn't think was amazing or a must try. The Jinya bun was good but at $4.5 for one, I thought it seemed a bit too expensive.   For dessert, the green tea mochi ice cream was great for sharing (2 round pieces cut in halves - half a piece per person would be good if 4 people wanted to share). The coffee panna cotta was good but a tad bit too sweet with not enough coffee flavour for my liking.   With the ramen averaging about $13-14 per bowl (plus extra for more toppings if you want), I thought this place was a bit expensive. Appies, dessert can add up quick to $30 per person if you make your ramen a combo too, with the ramen portion being smaller than most places in Calgary.   I did not have any issues with service as I was seated when it was not busy, but I did think it was extremely stupid to have people pay for their bills at the front counter by the door where everyone enters and exits, especially when there are tons of people waiting.   It's decent ramen for Calgary but if you've had good ramen elsewhere (Japan, LA, Vancouver, etc.), you still can't compare. If you are dying for some ramen in Calgary, give this place a try and avoid obvious busy times like 6:30-8 for dinner. If you are travelling outside of Calgary where you know you can get a great bowl of ramen, maybe just nurse your ramen craving until then :)"}
{"text":"Better than average for sure! Came at 5:25 and were seated right away and then a huge line formed at 5:30. Had the black tonkatsu and tried some spicy chicken ramen, chicken karaage, and caramelized cauliflower. I loved that extra spicy meant extra spicy! Soooo good and spicy! Flavour of the broth was very rich and thick. It definitely is better than your average ramen place. It just opened though, so definitely some service issues. Nothing too bad, just small things. I am sure they will find their footing. Great addition to the Calgary food scene. I will be back."}
{"text":"Not only is this place nice inside, the broth is ON POINT. There are a few other locations in California, Canada and Texas. Not sure if  I would consider it a \"chain\" though. I will be back to try something new and order a few of the same things.   PROS: Tonkatsu Black (#1) ramen              Jinjya bun              Tokyo Yatai ramen              Crispy chicken  CONS:  Priced on the higher side (but really good quality)"}
{"text":"Food was good and is always good. I usually get the vegetarian ramen with caramelized cauliflower. I love this place except the Women's bathroom was a little scary tho, toilet seat opens on its own."}
{"text":"The vegan ramen is amazing. I also like how you can get a refill on noodles, I typically will split an order with my partner and it's the perfect amount."}
{"text":"Used to be my favorite place.. but service went way down and so did the quality of the food. I'll take my business to Monta."}
{"text":"So I'm here to check out the hype. The place is small, like most ramen places in Vegas. I came here on a weeknight and my wait was about 25minutes.   The staff here are all very friendly, happy and efficient. I know this is a ramen place but I wasn't craving it so I ordered the JINYA Quinoa Salad instead. It consisted of baby greens, kale, broccoli, quinoa, garbanzo and red beans in some sort of creamy dressing. The portion wasn't huge, which is nice and it hit the spot.   I'll have to come back one day and try out the ramen. Seems like everyone else in the restaurant ordered it and left the bowl empty. A good sign!"}
{"text":"The place is small and not enough seating even the waiting room but the service was great. The food presentation is awsome my wife enjoyed her meal and her desert. As for me I enjoyed the Ramen that I order but not great it's a bit salty for me. Maybe next time we'll come back and the Ramen that I ordered will taste awsome."}
{"text":"My favorite bowl of ramen is the spicy chicken ramen with thin noodles. I also love to order the jinya bun the side. I think the middle table is a huge of waste of space, you could seat more people if they were divided into smaller tables. Other than that... Great place!"}
{"text":"Great service, clean, and really yummy food not only ramen. I have enjoyed every bite"}
{"text":"Jinya is a relatively new Japanese restaurant in Calgary  (as of September 2017), and is a chain from the U.S. If you are looking for some good ramen, then this is the place to be. I would highly recommend the \"sprouting up ramen\". This is one of their more popular dishes, and is quite tasty. Another dish to try would be the pork chashu rice bowl. The pork is quite tasty, but can be rather salty at times for my liking. Other than that, it is quite Good, and I will be getting that dish in the future. Another item to try would to the chicken karraggae. This is basically deepfried chicken, and comes out hot and fresh. The chicken is juicy and quite good.   I have mentioned only a few of their several dishes on their menu, and have not tried every dish myself. All I can say from what I have tried so far is that the food is quite good, but could be cheaper. Otherwise, this restaurant is quite Good, and I will definitely be coming back in the near future for more tasty food!"}
{"text":"I've been to JINYA many times and finally decided to do a review this time around. Overall I can say since I've been multiple times they are still very good. They have maintained the flavours and service which is why I find myself always going back.   I went for Sunday afternoon lunch and the restaurant wasn't full so we got a seat right away. We were served right when we sat down with water and asked for our orders.   I ordered the sprouting up ramen (pork and chicken broth: pork chashu, kikurage, spicy bean sprouts, green onion, half seasoned egg*, crispy brussels sprouts, black pepper, ginger \"served with thick noodles) I asked for no ginger and they easily accommodated that change. The soup was delicious, hot in temperature, and not too thick and heavy. It was very flavourful and light. It comes with two pieces of chashu and a ton of toppings and noodles. They definitely don't cheap out in that! The Brussel sprouts are so good but obviously once in the soup they're not as crispy anymore. But none the less still very good!    My bf ordered the tonkatsu black (pork broth: pork chashu, kikurage, green onion, nori dried seaweed, seasoned egg*, garlic chips, garlic oil, fried onion, spicy sauce \" served with thin noodles). The soup was rich and overly thick and greasy. Noodles tasted fresh and came with all the toppings mentioned. The tonkatsu black is one of my favourites. I love the flavour of the soup as it tastes different from other places. It has such intense flavours without being over powering and overly salty.   Jinya is one of my favourite places for ramen because they have a huge variety spanning from pork, chicken and vegetarian. They also always have new things!   Only down side now is that I think they took away their lunch combos. Otherwise overall still love jinya!"}
{"text":"I LOVE Raman & have my favorite go-to places in Toronto. My husband & I decided to try this place out in Friday night for dinner. We didn't have to wait long for a table, which is nice for any Raman joint in Toronto. I ordered the signature sprouted Raman which was everything I expected, by happy with the quality of pork & flavor is the broth. We shared a pitched of Sapporo for $17 which was on special. I will definitely come back here."}
{"text":"First thing i have to clarify how most local people judging the customer service. It is actually pretty good. I think theres people just like to find bones inside an egg.   The ramen is good and very creative. Soup base is thick and tasty. As well as the meat is tender enough that it melt instantly once you put it inside your mouth. Highly recommend the CHA CHA CHA ramen.   So i would suggest you guy to go there personally and get a feel on it. Because i always think that some comment here are either too bias or they basically think they are king and queen so they want the best of everything. Agree?  I would definitly come back again."}
{"text":"I like the ambiance of the place. Excellent food. I had tonkotsu asari. Delish. I was full for the rest of my shift-graveyard and thats a good thing coz if im not satisfied i will eat tWo or three times throughout the night."}
{"text":"The wonton ramen is delicious. But don't over look any if their scrumptious appetizers either!"}
{"text":"I usually don't write updates every time I return to restaurants, but Jinya disappointed me.  I already know that the prices are too high and the wait is always a bit long, but I was ok with that when I returned.  This time around I tried the black tonkatsu and spicy chicken ramen.  First off, they are already $11 and don't include many common ingredients like bamboo shoots or egg.  Then they add in weird ramen ingredients like spinach that you can't replace without being charged an extra $1-2.  But past that, the broth was bland and not even remotely spicy even though I asked for extra hot.  Then I was charged an extra $0.50 for making it \"hot\" on top of that.  Chciken chasu was also very undercooked and tasted like a chicken breast - something that does not go well with ramen.  I will not be returning and would recommend at least 5 other ramen shops in town."}
{"text":"ChaChaCha you can get from here taste exactly the same as \"Jiro-kei ramen\". The best quality in entire Toronto. Also the atmosphere in the restaurant is A+! Probably the best customer service I get so far in this year. If you're Japanese or visit Japan and fell in love in Japanese ramen, Jinya will serve you what you're looking for!"}
{"text":"You would never guess how beautiful this restaurant is by judging it from the outside.  As soon as you walk in, the dim-lit, modern decor overwhelms you in a good way.  Like most japanese style restaurants, space is very limited. Theres a ramen bar, comminal table and a few booths/banquets for seating options in the restaurant.    The menu is pretty simple.  I tried the \"Premium Tonkotsu White Ramen\" which was probably my favorite in comparison to the popular \"Tonkotsu Black Ramen.\" The difference in broth is that the black only contains pork broth and the white has a mixture of both pork and chicken broth. To describe the difference taste wise? The black seemed a bit more rich than the white... and as a personal preferance, I don't like my broth too think or rich.  The Tonkotsu White was perfect for me! I also tried their Takoyaki, which was amazingly delicious! Their \"Jinya Pork Bun\" was ok, I've tasted better, but I didnt despise it.  I love their \"Pork Chasu Bowl\" very much!  Their pork was so tender, and it paired perfectly with the spinach and seasoned egg added in the bowl!  Overall I'm very please with Jinya Ramen! I could definitely see myself coming back for more!"}
{"text":"THE MUSIC IS TOO FUCKING LOUD it's hard to talk but the food is pretty good. I usually ordered the chicken ramen and it's yummy but it's pricey. The takoyaki is great too better then most in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"it's a great place to eat and hangout, the servers were amazing and friendly. Location is totally clean and awesome, but I had a bad experience with the ramen being too salty..."}
{"text":"The experience was just awful. Young lady with glasses which I dont know whether she was a hostess or server had an attitude and no customer service skills. They forget to put in our app which was brought out till almost the end of entree. No refills of water . we had to ask and she was bothered about it. That person just ruins your day and food. They never came to check on you or ask if anything else is needed. Waited for the check and nothing. I had to get up there and ask for it. The food was decent but what ruined the whole experience is the lack of customer service and I manage a restaurant in a casino and being that this place was not busy is no excuse. This is the last time I come in just to not see her face ."}
{"text":"I have only been here twice, once for lunch and once for dinner. The lunch crowd was non existent so if you wanna try this place, I would recommend lunch time. Dinner is a ridiculous amount of people.   The first time I went I ordered the shoyu ramen and gyoza. I also got a sesame seed panna cotta that they no longer offer which is sad cause that was the only memorable thing. The ramen was ok, it was light and the noodles were chewy but nothing spectacular. The service was great though and the staff was very nice.   The time I went for dinner, the place was starting to get busy, luckily I kind of beat the crowd. The lady at the door took our names down without a greeting or a smile or any eye contact. The vibe is dim lighting and music is like I'm in a club which is cool but then it was a little too heavy on the edm which started to give me a headache. Our server was very nice and this time I got the miso. Once again, ok flavor but it was cold! Granted I was sitting under the ac vent and I was freezing my butt off so I think that may have something to do with it. The sad thing is my friend and husband got extra noodles so it got cold on the table and when they added it to the cold broth, it was just not ok.   Note to restaurant: majority of the ramen joints that offer extra noodles bring it out a little later so the noodles don't get cold, hard and stuck together while your finishing the bowl. They even offer more broth in a tea pot just to go the extra mile."}
{"text":"Good  soup, service from Dom or Don an asian guy is out standing!! Im glad i stop by. I will comeback for sure, also i will recommend this place to all my friends, ambience little dark but is ok, i tried this time the chicken soup, next time will be the cha cha cha!!! Lol."}
{"text":"This is the best ramen bar I have been to, the tempura Brussels sprouts are fantastic. I get the vegetarian ramen and add an egg, the broth is excellent and I like the fact that you can order extras in the ramen. A little loud inside from the music so it's hard to hear your company sometimes which is the reason for 4 stars. The food over all is very good!"}
{"text":"Love love love !!!!!!!!!!!!! I waited almost 2 hrs in a BS line but I was so determined. It was wayyyyyyy worth it!!!! Definitely recommend! My server was very nice he was very attentive. I wish I would of got his name I just remember it was a white guy."}
{"text":"If you're looking for the best ramen place in town, JINYA is the place to be! There's a lot of ramen selection! My favorite is JINYA TONKOTSU BLACK. The place is always packed so expect to wait maybe 5-15 mins. When you get inside a server will initially ask what kind of drink do you want. It's pretty loud inside so if you're looking for a place to sit and talk with your friends, just think that you're in a bar or club. I love their JINYA BUN! It's a must try! Their restroom is awesome, very modernized toilet ahaha! I love it here!"}
{"text":"First time here had dinner for 2 in a nice booth.  Small restaurant, but feels open and comfortable.  There's a huge table in center for large groups.   Booth was nice and wasn't too loud to hold a conversation.  The service was great.  Server was knowledgeable and attentive, she took our ramen orders promptly and we received food and drinks in a timely fashion.  Water glasses were kept filled and we received check after meal, but weren't rushed which was awesome.  Enjoyed the ramen, I would like to return to try other items on their menu."}
{"text":"This is my favorite ramen place by far. The food has never disappointed. The only downside is how long you have to wait sometimes and the fact that they have no where to wait but outside in the hot sun or smushed up against a wall. You'd think with all the customers they get they'd get a larger location or somehow expand. Otherwise the restaurant is great."}
{"text":"Jinya wasn't one of the places that I bookmarked but I ventured in anyways since it was too cold out. Their prices were steeper than average, w/ ramen bowls ranging from $12-15. This wouldn't have been too much of an issue if they had justified the cost-- except they did not. There wasn't anything about the tonkotsu white that stood out. Rather, the broth lacked depth, the egg wasn't soft-boiled (almost fully cooked), and the char siu slices were rough albeit thick. As well, although the noodles were nicely cooked to al-dente, there was too little of it. I found myself hungry even after finishing the bowl.   Given that there are cheaper, tastier, and larger portions of ramen nearby, I doubt that I'll be back. -1 star for the cost."}
{"text":"Might've found our favorite ramen bar.  Everything from the staff to the food was great! The interior was lovely with a social atmosphere. Music is pretty loud though. We ordered the crispy chicken and Jinya bun off of the happy hour menu. I got the Tonkatsu Black. Food was delicious."}
{"text":"One of the better places to go to for ramen.  Good amount of seating, good variety of ramen as well as Japanese tapas.  Hearty broth.  Full of flavor.  Appears milky creamy.  Not too salty.  Comes with an egg, a couple of pieces of chaschu pork, green onions.  My favorite is the premium tonkatsu white because it's a mixture of the chicken and pork broth.  The chicken ramen (with the chicken chaschu) isn't bad either.    Chaschu pork has a good amount of fat and meat.  It's not entirely fat like Monta's, which is great.  Service is prompt and fast.  Nothing to complain about this place other than they don't have miso ramen."}
{"text":"False advertisement on drive thru service. We went down, ordered TO GO that took 30 mins for 3 bowls of ramen. Monta is way better."}
{"text":"I love the food, atmosphere, hours, & prices. I like spicy chicken ramen with the added soborro, garlic, corn, and anything else that sounds tasty at the time. I'm always full, and so happy with the food.   A couple times I've had horrible luck with service ... one time my waitress was just down right dismissive and rude, I can say I am a polite person and always respect staff wherever I dine/spend my time. This specific time I ended up requesting a new waitress and everything was fine.   Another more recent occasion that disappointed me was when I ordered some take out. I was having issues with their phone number, it was saying it was disconnected for a while, but eventually I got through, much to my relief    I ordered and was told it would take about 20 minutes. I went in 15 minutes later and the young woman at the front podium told me it would be another 20 minutes. I was a little surprised.   Anyways I step out for a couple minutes and come back sooner than she said in hopes maybe it was ready. I go inside and I see my order bagged up and sitting on the shelf ready to go, yay! I asked the woman if my food was ready and she again told me no it would take longer, not bothering to check if the food that was ready was even mine.    Anyways 10 minutes goes by she finally looks at the tag/receipt on the bag and she called my name, and was like oh it's ready now. She acted as if I hadn't been standing there for almost 15 minutes staring at the food. I was annoyed, I could have been home eating it by then. And it wasn't super busy either. She was barely applying herself. I  found it rather insulting too cause she didn't care at all. I'll be back because I love the food, but the staff can sometimes be a tad rude."}
{"text":"Every time I crave ramen this is the place that comes to mind. If you ever get a chance to go here make sure to try their takoyaki (I get it without the egg salad). Their spicy chicken ramen is my favorite and I like how they give you an option to choose what level of spiciness you want. I even love ordering togo since they arrange the noodles & toppings separate from the broth so it can be heated at home, that way the noodles aren't soggy. The packaging and design of this location is also very modern. It's become really popular lately so whether you're dining in or ordering togo don't forget to plan ahead."}
{"text":"First off this place is a little noisey... The menu selection is awesome! I am a huge fan of the tonkasu black. So much delicious garlic! My boyfriend and I love this place and frequent it quit often! I have yet to try the chicken ramen but that is next on my list."}
{"text":"Service sucked!!!! Asked for extra noodles and did not come in my ramen. Then I had to wait 5 more minutes for just noodles!!! Don't go! I waited 45 just for ramen and soup wasn't even hot"}
{"text":"Ambiance: 5/5 dark, trendy, vibrant, and young. arguably date-worthy.  Service: 5/5 friendly and speedy!  Food:  -Ramen: 4/5 What I LOVE about this place is that you can ask for them to control the salt level. I had both the tonkotsu spicy and jinya chicken with lower salt levels and they were both flavorful and not insanely salty! woot!! FTW! -Takoyaki: 3/5 OK, a bit too salty and sweet -Pork Gyoza: 1/5 tasted like microwaved pot stickers. fail.  The ramen was very good. Not out of this world or mind-blowingly delicious, but still probably the best I've had in Vegas. The rest of the food fell pretty flat. Hey, but it's a ramen house. I'll be back for more ramen!"}
{"text":"?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????Jinya??????????????????????????????????????????????????????10???????????????????????????bb??????????????????????????ok.??????? ???????????????"}
{"text":"When this place opened, I went a lot and gave it a 5-Star review, but unfortunately, time has changed that review to 3-Stars.   The ramen and food are still great, which is the only reason I have it at 3-stars. Everything else has deteriorated.  The ambience inside has changed. They now play loud club-like music making a conversation with the person next to you very difficult. They always have a long wait, around plus 45 minutes, good for them, not good for you. Because of this, I started doing pick-up orders, but they consistently mess up the orders and their phone lines are commonly disconnected for hours at a time.   Their pick-up times have increased as well, 10 minutes to a 50 minutes wait to pick-up your order. One time I waited an hour to get my order, and they left me waiting at the front register for another 15 minutes.  Their service used to be amazing. It's not the worst now, but definitely less than amazing. You won't be disappointed, unless you are talking to the host, the long waits, poor line management and the phone service is lacking there."}
{"text":"The food was expensive for what you're paying for. I asked for mushrooms in my ramen, and it seemed like someone took a handful of cold unwashed mushrooms and threw them in my soup last minute. The salad and gyoza were decent, but nothing to rave about.   All the employees gave the impression that they didn't want to be there. Our waitress made it feel like we were bothering her by eating there. She only came by once to refill our water, and then disappeared for about 15 minutes. Quite possibly the worst server I've ever had.   The entire restaurant feels cramped. The center table makes for an incredibly awkward seating arrangement. I absolutely hated this place."}
{"text":"Delicious ramen with so many choices - all of which are so good. I got the spicy chicken ramen with thin noodles and my sister got the spicy miso umami pork ramen with thick noodles. I personally liked the way the thicker noodles soaked up the broth and were easier to eat with the spoon but the broth of both bowls was so great. I got my chicken bowl with medium heat and it was just enough to add a kick but still allow you to taste all the ingredients. We also tried the fried shrimp balls. They were delicious and not greasy or too filling - they're creamy on the inside and full of fresh shrimp chunks. The fried chicken appetizer is some of the best fried chicken you'll try. The service is great and someone is always checking in on you to make sure everything is going well."}
{"text":"Look out Monta, there's a new kid on the block. Actually, Jinya is quite a few blocks away but it is on par, dare i say better? Having consumed the Tokyo special which includes the standards by which to judge ramen: tonkatsu pork and pork broth, i think better is a consideration.  I found the pork broth to be heavy and filling in the best way. Creamy umami permeates the entire bowl and delivers satisfaction with the perfect amount of salty-ness. Speaking of perfect, i have to mention the temperature of the dish which was, perfect. The only thing worse than cold ramen is losing taste buds right out of the gate!  Add to this slightly aldente noodles and flaky, delightfully seasoned pork and you have a serious contender for Vegas' best ramen. I can't wait to return for more of the small yet exciting menu.  Do be advised that this is a ramen bar so expect a bar-esque music volume, not really my bag thus the four stars but it won't stop me from a return visit."}
{"text":"Yum! Love ramen and always love when its done right! Shared the chashu pork bowl and karaage, both really good! I had the spicy umami miso ramen with an added onsen egg! This bowl hit the spot, would definitely come back next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"So glad I gave this place a chance. Came here around 10pm with a rowdy bunch of friends and we enjoyed ourselves very much. The ramen is best with thick noodles for me and mildly spicy. The broth was rich, but not overly thick, the flavor was really good and the noodles were perfect. Sapporo out of the fresh keg was super cold and went so well with my ramen. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The venue is pretty cool. It's small so sometimes the wait can be long. They have a communal table in the middle where you dine with strangers or you can wait longer for an open booth. It has that trendy, industrial vibe. The music is pretty cool too.  I got the cha cha cha and I regretted it. I love garlic but the blend wasn't good at all. The broth wasn't hot in temperature. It was almost cold which made the experience unenjoyable. At first the broth tasted really good. It's pork and fish based. I guess after blending all the other ingredients, it tasted bitter and couldn't taste the flavor at all. The pork was really good. It tasted just right. The egg was good. I think it was suppose to have a garlic flavor but it tasted like a regular egg. The noodles were thick which I didn't really enjoy. Something wasn't right and I can't really point it out but I wouldn't recommend the cha cha cha.   The service was great. They were attentive. They came often to refill your water and see how you were doing. The people were nice.   I would come back again but I would try something different."}
{"text":"Jin-Ya is proof that good exists and wants us to be happy."}
{"text":"I don't know if I'll change me back here. I probably won't if I can help it. My boyfriend and I agree that it seems like they might not be doing well in maintaining quality control with their food. Every time we come here, we order the same thing but it never ends up tasting the same way. In addition to that, this evening both of our bowls had noodles that weren't fully cooked. Some days out bowls are filled, some days they're halfway filled, and tonight, my bowl was less than halfway filled."}
{"text":"Greeted promptly. One star lost due to sticky menus. No fuss ordering. Received food in less than seven minutes. I ordered the ramen with cilantro. It was good and didn't weigh too heavy on the stomach. Was asked if anything else was needed. Was not asked if I wanted a drink refill. Music was way too loud for my taste. It certainly helped to clear my table out fast. Maybe that was the point."}
{"text":"I fudging love this place!  That's all I can say about that!  Food, awesome!  Something about the Season Egg ... so good.  I added an extra one to my Chef's Special, Tokyo Tonkatsu Ramen that I tried for the first time.  Excellent for my liking.  I just wish they would either make their pork slices thicker or even have more than just two flimsy pieces.  But other than that, amazing!  The gyozas are always delish.  This trip, I also ordered the Spicy Creamy Shrimp Tempura and OMG, I think I just had an orgasm in my mouth!  At first I was obsessed with the seasoned egg, now the spicy creamy shrimp tempura has taken its place.  I love this place!  I wish they would make this place bigger.  With a small space and it being busy, during this visit, it bothered us watching how the waitresses were seating the customers.  Clearly, a two top was seated at a table for four when they could have clearly seated them at the big community table.  But whatev's.    With all that being said, Happy Eating's!"}
{"text":"I haven't really found a ramen place that I like in town. This one comes the closest to being a favorite.   Growing up in Japan and eating ramen frequently from different shops, I like to say that I'm pretty particular when it comes to ramen.   I had the karaage ramen. It was definitely different from what I'd usually have but it was either ramen and karaage or karaage ramen. I chose the latter obviously. I also had them add am egg and corn to my ramen which is a little extra in cost but that's typical from ramen joints. The chicken soaked up some of the broth which added extra flavor to the chicken. It still had somewhat of a crispy outside and still was good with beer. Oh! If you didn't know already karaage in Japan is usually eaten with beer. It's like the Japanese equivalent to bar food. The ramen was perfect as far as not being too soft or too hard which is always a plus! I'm sure if you ask they'll make it the way you like it but I like that perfect in between.   I forgot how much my bill was but it was exactly as I expected as far as cost to quality/service. The service was spot on and I wasn't bothered too much or too little.   I can't wait to go back and try other things!"}
{"text":"Pretty average. Went during reverse happy hour tonight. Pretty empty, but still had to wait a bit to be seated.   Ordered a Sapporo (kinda warm and flat)... the crispy chicken (really good).. and a jinya bun. The bun itself was meh, but the inside was good!  Ordered a veggie ramen and added pork and chicken to it. Added an onsen egg (best part of the bowl.. except they had to bring it out on the side. Forgot it?).   Lackluster ramen. Pretty bland. Noodles are average. Chicken was alright, the pork was good, but again, lacked any seasoning or flavors. Much potential! Also, the food was much better this go round than my first try here (crispy Brussels, jinya bun, tonkotsu).   Service was iffy but friendly."}
{"text":"No RameN No LiFE    The whole vibe here is pleasant.  Good vibes, good music.   It's always busy,  I've been here a few times and every time it's approximately a 25-40 minute wait.  They are highly strict with you keeping an ear out for when your name is called.  So be sure to be attentive.  Service is prompt once seated.    Ramen here is delicious.   Ordered the spicy chicken ramen  With seasoned egg , soborro spicy chicken and corn.   Was happy with my choice tonight.  The BF-- ordered Tonkotsu  black ramen.  A small chicken chashu bowl.  Did not disappoint   And at the end we tried a Blockhead ice  Cream bar - matcha green tea with pistachios  And chocolate drizzled on top.  Worth trying.   Cannot wait to return.  ---------- no ramen no life --------     Bonus points : Bathrooms are clean , this is a big game changer for me.  If your bathroom is dirty --- everything else seems dirty  Just saying    Their toilet has a seat warmer .... \"  wow , well that's nice.\""}
{"text":"One of the best ramen places in Vegas ! Definitely a must try but expect a wait for such a popular place !! Usually wait an average 10-30 minutes to be seated but it's definitely worth it !"}
{"text":"Definitely one of the better ramen places in town. The restaurant is not too big though, so be prepared for a wait during peak times.  The concept is cook and the interior very hip with a lot of wood. Service is very attentive and Japanese.  I ordered the garlic ramen which was tasty, though a bit oily. Noodle were not bad, though still not quite the level of chewiness I desire most. The broth was salty (most ramen broths are) but flavorful.  I like how you have many noodle choices, can add on sides to make combos, and have lots of options for broths.   Overall, not the best ramen I have ever had but above average for Las Vegas."}
{"text":"My first time going wasn't too impressive for me . There was no wait as it was mid day so got sat right away and greeted by server. We ordered our ramen and my friend had asked for extra noodles and we got the edamame to start. That was good , pretty much same garlic edamame you get everywhere . But the ramen came out and had ONLY 2 skinny pieces of pork for the whole bowl. Very thin and short pieces which I tried to conserve for the whole time I was eating . My friend's noodles came out about 5 minutes on a side plate... which we thought was kinda odd and we assume would have already been inside the bowl. The seasonings they provided were pretty good but I had to keep adjusting to get the right flavor I was looking for . Got some sake and Sapporo too to go along . But pretty bland broth with not too much flavor , maybe I'll give another try and order different bowl."}
{"text":"I've eaten there in the past and loved JINYA. This time I was disappointed. The flavor seemed off, but really disturbed me was the cleanliness. I was served edamame in a bowl that had old food stuck to the side, it was about an inch by an inch. The server issued a perfunctory sorry, and took it away. I doubt I'll go back again."}
{"text":"It's always a nice time coming here. Tonight was a bit different in that I guess we came during happy hour. For the most part, it was good. The food and service overall but it seems like our waitress kept forgetting part of our order so we had to ask another waiter. He was on top of it however, it seems like the cooks were over the happy hour rush and didn't seem too keen on rushing the food out. I like to think that it was just a one off as its usually a pleasure to come here."}
{"text":"JINYA's one ramen bar that offers much more than others in town. It's complete with a menu presenting more than 10 different kinds of ramen, plus a variety of appetizers and small plates.   FOOD  Appetizer - Taoyaki: We started off with one order of the takoyaki. The bread was soft and the octopus was a little chewy, but not so much that it was inedible.   Ramen - JINYA Tonkostu Black:  The broth was garlicky from the garlic oil, and the fried onions actually go well with the other ingredients. Though the broth was decent, I was expecting a richer, meaty flavor. Thin noodles were a pleasant change from the thicker variety. A downside about my ramen was the globs of fat from the pork chashu.   Ramen - Spicy Miso Ramen (Special of the Day): This was what my boyfriend ordered. The broth was mild and not as spicy as expected. It doesn't come with a marinated egg. To me that's like serving a burger without the fries.   RESTAURANT I was concerned that we'd have to wait for a table to open up, but 4PM on a Saturday afternoon was mellow with only several diners. Hip and contemporary, the restaurant is accommodating and has plenty of seating available.  SERVICE Dinner went off without a hitch. Service is in top shape here.  OVERALL Not bad, and I would return to try other their other ramen. JINYA's a good option if you're looking for variety. Rating: 3.5."}
{"text":"The food has not let me down within about 4 different trips to this modern little ramen spot, up the street from the Palms.   The ramen has always been pretty satisfying. I am not particularly a ramen connoisseur but I do I enjoy the flavors I get from ramen bowls. Plus these new jinya buns were so good and those salmon poke tacos have become a craving.   Service here is okay and has not particularly wowed me ever. I do see them helping each other out but many times I've found myself waiting for attention and getting stale exchanges from servers. Usually a good experience overall."}
{"text":"This is my first time for Jinya Ramen, we arrived there around 2 pm and it was a long line already but it wasnt too long for us to get our seats. We ordered Cha Cha Cha Ramen which is i think a signature noodle of them . It was soo good with big bowl , bean sprout ,egg, pork and their broth was perfect."}
{"text":"Best ramen I have had in town, hands down. Went there late night around 1am, luckily there wasn't much of a wait that night since the hostess said it's usually a 30 min wait, minimum.   All 3 ramens we go we're stellar. I would stay away from the hockey wings, small, and way too much seasoning. Instead go for the fried chicken.  Will be back again."}
{"text":"Food is GREAT and pricing is reasonable. I definitely recommend the soup and salad special, you wont regret it. I'll definitely be coming back :)"}
{"text":"Probably the best tasting ramen in town.  The prices are high though.  I do like their bun and their black garlic ramen."}
{"text":"Jinya is one of the first restaurants that come to mind when I want ramen! I love coming here to hang out and eat. Very clean and hip. Helpful staff and amazing bathroom! The only thing I would say I don't enjoy is the music combined with the volume. Some people might find it loud and maybe even obnoxious.   The restaurant has a great selection of ramen! Also,  they've got side dishes like takoyaki, steamed pork bun, fries, etc. I really like the sweet and savory steamed pork bun; it's very soft but still has texture. Their gyoza was pretty good too but I've had better. The best ramen they have is the tonkatsu black! Their other ramen bowls are good and some are okay. There's a choice for everyone so don't feel restricted when you first come here!"}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this place because my cousin told me we should try it.  We always have been going to Monta since it was one of the places for Ramen that we liked.  The only problem with them that it is way too salty for my taste plus the place was so tiny I felt so claustrophobic.  I am not one for cramped spaces.    My husband is an especially picky eater, especially with Asian food, but he loves this.  I think he finally found a place that he cannot get sick of.  They offer such a variety of food that you cannot go wrong.  I love the ambiance of the restaurant.  Very cozy and casual.  The staff is on point when it comes to filling our drinks.  That is one of my biggest peeves is when the servers do not fill my drinks on a timely manner, but they do and I love it!  They are seriously on point when it comes to greeting us when we first come in.    My usual order is the Tonkotsu Asari.  Thank you BTW for not making salty.  I have a sensitive palatte so I am glad that you are able to add flavor without making me an enormous amounts of water.  My husband gets the Tonkotsu Spicy which he makes super hot.  It looks delicious, but I do not do spicy foods.  I think you guys made me a lover for the Takoyaki (Octopus Balls) and the Pork Chashu Bowl.  Yum!    This is definitely a place that we can eat with our friends and family.  My husband, cousin, and I are going to be regulars here.  People should seriously try this place out.  I cannot rave enough about this place."}
{"text":"I arrived for lunch around 1:30 pm on a Monday.  To my surprise it was still quite busy, but I didn't have to wait to be seated.  I always like to sit at the bar so I could see what they are cooking, but I couldn't see what they were cooking at this place because there was a stack of bowls in the way.  I ordered one of their more popular ramen combos ~ tonkotsu black and 3 pieces of karaage with salad ($10.55 + $3.95).  I think it was a bit on the pricey side.  To my surprise the waitress didn't even know what karaage was.  It didn't take long for my order to arrive.  Judging from the reviews of this place, I was expecting a good bowl of ramen.  But to my disappointment, there was a thick layer of garlic oil on top and the noodles were overcooked and soggy.  On the other hand, the broth was good, pretty concentrated broth.  Also, I wasn't expecting any chili paste in my ramen, but it came with a spoonful of chili paste right on top of my chashu.  If I wanted a bowl of spicy ramen I would have ordered it spicy.  They should have indicated on their menu that this is spicy.  I wasn't too please with this.  And for the price of over $10 a bowl of ramen, I think they should be able to at least cut the hanjuku egg in half and make the bowl look more presentable.  The karaage was equally disappointing as the chicken was not fresh.  It actually was on the verge of going bad.  All in all, I won't try these two dishes again, but might go back and try some other menu items."}
{"text":"This is more a 3.5. The service was slow and a bit pushy so I'd say a 3. However, the ramen was pretty good and more like a 3.75. The noodles are thinner than I'd like but the broth is good and egg cooked a little soft which is great. My chef's special was $13 before tax and I was stuffed!! Not sure I'd go here again considering I've had better and cheaper food such as pho and Magic Noodles. But the drink specials are good if I was dying for a drink."}
{"text":"Yum. Wait wasn't too bad. Ordered the Tonkotsu Spicy/Mild with Japanese curry and salad. I don't know what's on the salad but it was delicious. The curry was good and so was the ramen. Service was fast and friendly.   Happy hour from 3-5 and 10-?"}
{"text":"Wanted to try this place, but didn't get to.   There were only 3 of us and we waited for over an hour - no updates, no estimates of how much longer it may be. After 45 minutes, we were only told we'd be put at the big table (even though there were 4 person booths?) after the hostess (blonde w/ tattoos) saw us and realized we'd been there for so long. We didn't hear anything from her after that, and realized 3 groups of 2 and a group larger than ours that came in AFTER us got seated. There also appeared to be 2 other employees getting behind the hostess table but didn't really do much.  I understand things get busy, but the lack of communication from the hostess was disappointing especially since she knew how long we'd been waiting. Someone really needs to work with the hostesses on customer service. It seems like this is a recurring issue too, which is even more disappointing that nothing is being done about it despite responses saying they're welcoming feedback."}
{"text":"5 stars because every thing was very good! I got spicy chicken ramen with wontons and brussel sprouts!!"}
{"text":"This place has the best ramen in Vegas.  The Cha Cha Cha bowl is on point, and especially if you love garlic.  Their thick noodle is perfectly made.  The restaurant is beautiful on the inside and the ambiance is great.  Aside from the extremely loud music blaring, everything was next to perfect.    I am extremely picky with my ramen, and honestly feel that every other ramen spot in Vegas is below average at best.  The service here was alright, but you can't expect too much out of an Asian restaurant.    Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Tonkatsu black is my go to ramen. I have been to quite a few ramen places all over and sad to say this one falls towards bottom on the list. Poor service, unorganized, poor qlty broth with no real taste that you get w this soup, sub par ingredients in the soup and noodles felt packaged. And over all way too expensive. Ideal for not someone very discriminating about their culinary experience. I recommend Sheki Menya for ramen in Calgary!!"}
{"text":"This place does get quite busy, so expect to wait. My first experience didn't go so well. My family and I ordered fried chicken, tako yaki and crispy rice for appetizers. They failed to bring out the tako yaki and crispy rice until inquired about. So, we ate those after our ramen. We ordered a kids meal for my little one, who never received his order :( I ended up sharing my ton katsu black ramen with him. The ton katsu black was flavorful as well as the fried chicken. The tako yaki would be better if they actually added a little more taki. If I do visit again, I do sure hope my experience is better."}
{"text":"We go to the Jinya in LA and were very excited to try this location while visiting Las Vegas. We weren't disappointed. The ramen and fried chicken tastes exactly the same. The staff was so nice and the place was clean. And the toilets in the bathroom, talk about luxury."}
{"text":"Quality ramen for a reasonable price! Super friendly staff that helps you pick out what you want if its the first time being there."}
{"text":"The only ramen place that is open late night. I like going there with my friends to eat and drink for happy hour. It can be busy at times and will have to wait during peak hours. Service is good, atmosphere is better, ramen is decent."}
{"text":"I am updating my review after eating here quite a few times. My most recent visit was disappointing. Our server left for break after taking our order and never came back. After being ignored by the other server for twenty minutes we had to get out of our seat to find someone to talk to. Both the new server and manager didn't seem to really care that in a restaurant of only five other patrons that they dropped the ball on our service. If I'm paying $45 for lunch for two I expect to not be ignored. I will be taking my business somewhere else, where they value my time."}
{"text":"This chain, with locations in California, Texas, Washington, Vancouver, and now Nevada, not only has good ramen but excellent service. Happy hour specials are the way to go if you're dining on a budget. For $3 you can get a decent cut of pork belly covered in a sauce that balances sweet and tanginess in their Jinya bun.  On their regular menu the Jinya No.1 tonkotsu black ($10.55) is a medium-sized bowl filled with a creamy pork broth with just enough heat to clear the sinuses. They'll let you substitute thick noodles for the typical thin ones if you'l like. The single, large slice of pork in the bowl had enough fat to deliver a blast of savory-sweet flavor with each bite.  Service was friendly and informative. I also admire them for denying alcohol to a belligerent customer too drunk to make a coherent sentence. As long as it isn't me, I'm completely ok with that."}
{"text":"Our friends suggest this place for dinner, I was a little sceptic because I'm not fan of noodles, guest what?  The place feels welcome and very nice layout. Food is delicious, service is good and friendly highly recommended"}
{"text":"BEST VEGAN RAMEN YOU WILL EVER HAVE. I have gone to multiple locations and I always leave full and happy. Get the spicy creamy vegan ramen! It's not too spicy, I promise it will be the best you'll ever have!!"}
{"text":"Each business has its pros and cons. For this place the pros fortunately outweigh the cons.  Pros: the pig ear chicharon, the crispy rice with spicy tuna, and the tonkotsu black ramen with extra pork. All absolutely delicious! I've been here multiple times and I've tried many things on the menu but I narrowed it down to 3 favorites to avoid this review being too long. The pig ear chicharon was fried absolutely perfectly and the poached egg gave it a little something extra but didn't overpower the dish. The crispy rice was perfectly crispy and we got a second order since it was happy hour.  If you're solo dining and sitting at the counter you're right by the kitchen and you can talk to the chefs. They're super friendly and knowledgeable about the food they're putting out   Con: I understand that sometimes they get busy, which is good otherwise they wouldn't be open. But your hostess shouldn't be bussing tables. I've been in here on a couple occasions and at times I've had to wait over 10 minutes to even get greeted because she's clearing tables. The hostess should be doing standard side work such as cleaning menus and rolling silverware, so that if customers come in she can greet them right away. If I didn't like the food so much I would have walked out. Also, more than 1 POS system might be good for efficiency  P.S: check out the toilet in the ladies room!"}
{"text":"I came here with a group of 6 and we waited approximately 20 minutes to be seated. The restaurant is very small and intimate. Our server had our appetizers out within minutes and our food came shortly after and was great. I got the spicy chicken ramen and I would get it again. I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Great place to satisfy my late night craving for ramen.  The spicy chicken ramen had just the right amount of kick, veggies of spinach and bean sprout gave it a crunchy texture against the soft ramen noodles, and the chicken breast was nicely seasoned.  Add a seasoned egg and you're set.  Don't forget to add the fresh garlic.  The broth was slightly thick that coated the noodles for the best punch of flavor.   This was a delightful place and one of many new restaurants we checked out on this trip.  The music is a bit loud, but that doesn't influence the quality of the food."}
{"text":"Is it weird that my favorite thing about this place is the restroom?? THEY HAVE HEATED TOILET SEATS! At first I was a little uncomfortable because I thought the toilet had a bidet then I warmed up to the idea.. See what I did there?!  Let's get down to business. Let me start off by saying I was not hungry when I stepped through the door. As we waited, I noticed how busy it was and the hostesses said 20 minutes is nothing. They also said that sometimes there is a 2 hour wait and mentioned how much people enjoy Jinya. As we were seated, I noticed how they do not have TV's set up and seat you at a giant table.  We came at the right time because it was happy hour and they have a decent amount of food to choose from. I got kimchi tacos. They were enjoyable but a little too salty for my taste. The list of ramen had my mouth watering at that point. I got the Cha Cha Cha. It was delightful because of how garlicky it was. My favorite thing on the menu had got to be the noodle refill. I can't tell you how many times I've thought how delightful it would be to be to add more noodles to all the broth I have left over because I'm a monster.  I didn't mind the wait and I can't wait to use the restroom here again."}
{"text":"Bless all the places that let me live out my late-night adventures without going to bed starved or spending money on unworthy late-night snacks. Jinya is open until 3 am and thus one of these places. It is always, always worth it.   The restaurant is bigger on the inside than it looks on the outside. There are regular tables, a bar, and a big table in the middle, at which customers sit with other random customers. Jinya may be a little on the dimly lit side, but then I guess that's the atmosphere they're going for as a barstaurant. The servers are speedy, helpful, and friendly. Drinks are kept refilled and orders are taken immediately. The cooking time is also reasonable. I've never had to wait longer than 13 minutes for my order, regardless of how busy the place was.  And then of course, there is the ramen. Sweet, sweet Jinya ramen. The egg is one of my favorite parts. It is cooked just enough for it to be solid on the outside and smooth and soft on the inside - just the way I love it! Each serving of ramen comes with thick well-cooked noodles and plenty of meat, no short-selling there. Actually, can we talk about how the prices are crazy low for the huge portions of ramen that are served here? I have never come out of this restaurant anything less than full. In fact, I sometimes wish I had a little more room left for dessert, that's how big the portions are.    My only gripe about this place are the windows: The one time I was here during noon, the sun was shining through the windows so badly that my friends were practically blinded throughout their entire meal. I'd love if this place adjusted their blinds a little so that wouldn't happen to people sitting on the window side during lunch. That by itself is not worth a downvote, though. 5 stars from me!"}
{"text":"A friend made a bold statement that JINYA is her favorite ramen shop, so I just had to go out of my way to try it.  I ordered the Tonkotsu Black, Tonkotsu Assari, and the Chashu bowl to go.  The broth is flavorful, with all the nice accompaniment to further bring out the delicious pork flavor.  When I went to pick up the food, this place was packed!  There are many customers waiting patiently for their names to be called for seating.    This place is one of the best place for ramen, though, my hubby still thinking Monta is better."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the spicy chicken Ramen. The unfortunate part, $15 for a small/medium sized bowl, call me a glutton I was still hungry afterwards... If this was 9-10 bucks I'd return more often, at those prices once or twice a year, place is busy, so they don't care if I come back. The fake yelling/greeting could easily be removed, silly."}
{"text":"Love this place! Love calling and making orders for pick up. They're always nice and friendly and they food is delish !!!!"}
{"text":"I'm giving it 5 stars because I think they are the best in town.    Broth:  Tonkotsu Black is the one to get.  It's the most savory broth in town, better than both Monta and Sora (although Sora doesn't have Tonkotsu).  The flavor isn't from the excess salt but truly savory pork.    Pork:  Perfect mix of lean and fat.  Similar to the one at Monta but slightly less fattier.  Noodle:  I usually order the thick noodle.  I wasn't impressed during my first visit because part of the noodle was clumped together...but it was perfect during my second visit.  Appetizers:  Pork belly bun is very good with generous portion of very fatty pork belly...I'm craving for it as I'm typing. Takoyaki is surprisingly good.  Good flavor and texture.  The egg salad at the bottom is also very tasty. Fried Brussel Sprouts:  Nicely breaded with good mild flavor. Fried Chicken:  Also pretty good, tender, crispy, and flavorful  Caution:  I'm not a big fan of the spicy sauce.  It's okay in moderation, but the flavor is too strong that it changes the taste of the savory broth.  I'd stay away from the Tonkatsu Spicy.  Or at least try the Tonkatsu Black first then decide for yourself.    Overall:  Every item we tried has been great.  Good Service.  Suggestions:  Please consider opening for lunch!!!  And I think adding more variety of veggies will make it better (Sora does a good job on that)."}
{"text":"Stopped in after the Eddie Izzard show at the Pearl looking for some good ramen and was not disappointed. The hostess was friendly and seated me quickly at the bar.  The server was right there to take my drink order and explained they were having happy hour.  She also talked a little about what was available and what her favorites were.    I ordered the tonkotsu assari ramen without any extra toppings along with a draft Sapporo.  It was delicious and really hit the spot.  The server checked in with me on a good basis and was quick to get my check once I finished.  I can't find any fault with either the service or the food so this gets 5 stars in my book and I will certainly stop by again when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"I really do try to avoid leaving poor reviews, but my experience here warranted me to do so. Husband and I arrived around 11:15pm with about 8 parties ahead of us. We were given a wait time of 20-25 mins, no big deal. The big deal lies in the fact that, come 11:45pm, the two girls handling the front took their sweet time in seating patrons. I counted, there were about 12 available open seats, with a large waiting list, yet the staff didn't seem phased at all.  About 11:52pm, we were finally seated. Our waitress was probably the worst part of the experience. It was very apparent she didn't want to be working. She literally looked pissed. She dryly took our orders and hardly ever returned to check on us. I asked her for the red chili flakes, she said okay, only to ignore me and not fulfill the request.   By now, we just wanted to finish our food and leave. They blast house music, yet most of the staff really just look depressed and not happy to be working at all. The food itself is alright. I ordered the spicy chicken mild. It was indeed mild. I couldn't even taste any spiciness. My husband ordered the Jinya chicken. The broth had a heavy eggy flavor to it. I live in San Diego and am spoiled with ramen places like Tajima's. So, this particular ramen place didn't do much for me.   Back to our experience, we finish our food, and literally have to go out of way to flag our waitress for the check. When we do, we hand her our credit card, thinking she's just going to go and take care of the payment. Of course, we were wrong. We see her walking around the restaurant. After about 5 minutes, my husband is now just irritated with the whole experience so far, he goes to the front only to find the card just sitting on the front podium. The hostess didn't acknowledge it and hasn't even taken care of the bill! My husband had to tell her our waitress dropped this but apparently didn't give further instruction nor cared enough to follow up on it. Only then did the hostess check us out.    Overall, the food is mediocre, but the experience is in dire need of improvement. Management, either take care of your employees or instruct them not to kill your customers vibe! It's Vegas, there's hundreds of places to dine. I, for sure, will not return."}
{"text":"Really great place with excellent ramen. 1st time coming here tonight and I had the spicy chicken ramen (spicy) [it comes in 3 different degrees of spice] and it was amazing! So flavorful. I will definitely come back to try some other flavors, but I was not disappointed by any means of the word! A friend had the shrimp too as an appetizer and said it was seasoned really well. She also loved her chicken wanton ramen. I forgot what her husband got, but he enjoyed his as well. We were all happily satisfied. (They come here often)"}
{"text":"Nice decor, good broth, great noodles, amazing pork and solid service. It's a great place to take someone on a date. The music is very fitting and enjoyable. I will most certainly be back!"}
{"text":"First let's start by saying I'm a Monta fan. I came here seeing it was a new ramen joint, it's definitely spacious inside with a nice ambience. The staff and service was great. The bathroom was clean although they do not have paper towels as an option only air dryer. We got here around 8 and only 1/3 of the restaurant was filled.   I ordered a Tokyo tonkotsu ramen combination with their crispy chicken (3 pieces) and side salad while my girlfriend got a Tokyo tonkotsu ramen as well, both with thin noodles. I added corn for $1 while my girlfriend added chicken dumplings (2 pieces) $2. The side salad was mediocre, if I'd known I woulda just skipped the combination and just got a 5 piece crispy chicken for an extra $1. The crispy chicken was better than most places that I've tried. Now if you think Monta's tonkotsu ramen is salty then this place's broth might be for you as it is not as heavy/thick as Monta's. The chashu was more lean not much flavor, I like a fatty chashu like Monta's. There were not many options on adding your own spice, however the fresh garlic was a nice touch. The thin noodles were different from Monta's but still good.  Over all this has got to be my second favorite ramen place in Vegas, I will probably come back and try a different type of ramen, maybe their spicy chicken."}
{"text":"Very small spot that you should try at off hours, as it can be packed with a long wait. It's soooooo worth it if you do have to wait. Staff is friendly, helpful and will walk you through if a first timer. Pork bun was absolutely delicious and then I had a Chix/Pork combo Ramen, which was a home run. Check total UNDER $20!!!!!"}
{"text":"Came in here for dinner during the weekend, and there was no wait. The service was very friendly and we were greeted immediately upon entering.  The ambience was great. Very spacious for a ramen restaurant. I ordered the sprouting up ramen and my friend got the tonkotsu spicy. There were also a huge variety of additional toppings to add to your ramen.   The sprouting up ramen was great, especially the brussels sprouts. The brussels sprouts were my favorite topping in my ramen, it was very flavorful. I thought the pork lacked in flavor however. The portion is a bit bigger compared to other ramen joints, but the price is also a bit higher. I could barely finish my portion.  Overall, great food and great service. I will return to try other non-ramen items next time."}
{"text":"After driving past Jinya so many times and saying I wanted to check it out, I finally got to yesterday and it was so worth it! The portions are huge for how affordable the ramen bowls are! I ordered the Jinya chicken bowl and my boyfriend ordered the spicy version of the same bowl. We were shocked at how huge the bowls were when they came out! Everything was really yummy too! I had to order the Jinya bun after seeing so many good reviews about it on Yelp. I love pork belly and the bun did not let me down! It was only $3 on happy hour!"}
{"text":"We just finished attending a show at the MGM and were heading back to our place at the Palms Place but haven't eaten dinner. Drove past Palms Place and looked around. We didn't want fast food then we stumble upon this place. Small place but upon entering loved the ambiance & music. Immediately greeted upon entering.  We waited 15 minutes for a booth seating. Our waitress explained the menu to us because it was our first time here.  We order 10 piece chicken appetizer, 2 spicy chicken ramen.  Once order our food we received in a timely manner. Food was delicious. Food was fresh and chicken is moist and had alot of flavor.  All the staff were attentive to us especially our waitress. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"The creamy vegan ramen is everything! It's one of their best soups and worth a try even if you aren't a vegan.  The salmon and poke tacos are also amazing."}
{"text":"I love ramen, so I was excited to try this new ramen bar. It's got a great vibe - buzzy but not overly so.   I got the cha cha cha ramen, which was more expensive than other ramen in the city that I've had ($15.25) but the portion was quite generous. This was the first time I couldn't finish all the ramen on my own! The noodles were thick with a good bite. It was served with a seasoned egg (cooked perfectly) and several slices of pork chashu. The chashu was the best I've had at any ramen place so far - it was meaty, tender, and the fat just melted in my mouth. The broth was a tad oily, but very flavourful. It wasn't overwhelmingly garlicky, nor was it overly salty. I ended up crushing a few more garlic cloves into the soup to bring it to my desired level of garlic flavour.   I asked if it was possible to make the broth spicy. They said they would charge me extra for it or I could use the hot sauce supplied at the table. I opted for the hot sauce and it turned out great. The hot sauce was flavourful - thick, spicy, a bit salty, but not acidic. It was the perfect enhancer for my broth.  My boyfriend got the Tokyo tonkotsu ramen, which he thoroughly enjoyed. It came with thin noodles, which were good, but we both agreed that the thick noodles were better. It would have been nice if customers could choose thick or thin noodles for all ramen dishes (as is common at other ramen joints).   Service was good. We were acknowledged and seated promptly, food came out quickly and the server was very friendly.   Would definitely return again to try some of their other ramen, as they have quite a variety!"}
{"text":"nothing wrong with another ramen place opening up, especially when they are putting out excellent eats. A nice opened spaced dining area as where some other places cram you in. There is a larger table in the middle where different groups or individuals can come together. They also had some good music pumping, a little reggae as I recall.   I had the Tonkotsu Assari bowl. It was such a flavorful broth that I left some noodles behind while sipping the broth to its end. I also had the tempura Brussel sprouts. A bit salty for me but I definitely enjoyed them this way. Another star of the meal was the Jinya bun. pork belly on a steamed bun how could you go wrong. I will definitely be coming back to try the many different options Jinya Ramen Bar has to offer."}
{"text":"YELP 365 CHALLENGE 2014-(212/365)  \"The Hipster Ramen Joint\"  Nice open space with a communal dining table in the center, Jinya sports a hip modern vibe with cool beats blasting out the speakers. The menu selections here are also plentiful with traditional ramen and rice bowls, along with familiar dishes with a Jinya twist on them, and even a few tasty tapas style dishes.  We started off with a Jinya Bun, Mini Chashu Bowl, and the Tempura Brussels Sprouts with Truffle Oil.The bun was very tasty, and the sprouts were delicious too, things we'd probably order again. However, the Chashu Bowl IMO doesn't top the one found at Ramen Sora even though Jinya's version is a tad bit bigger with a soft boiled egg.  Our waiter suggested the seasonal Chicken-Lime & Cilantro Ramen, so we split that. Although the flavors were good. It had more of a Vietnamese/Chinese flavor to me.Looking to try the more traditional type ramen when we return. Great service, open until 3 am, and solid food overall...we'll be back!  ALOHA!!!  Shaka Meter:  \uuu/  \uuu/  \uuu/  \uuu/  4"}
{"text":"I love JINYA. This is probably one of my favorite ramen spots in town. The broth is really good compared to other places and they're opened really late. I usually get tonkotsu spicy and sometimes their pork buns. Super good!"}
{"text":"The hubby and I live in the neighbourhood, and we had been watching Jinya build itself up ever since Daybreak (one of our favourite morning after greasy spoons) shut down.  Our hope was that Daybreak's successor would serve as a worthy replacement.  Today, we finally made a trip for lunch--he got the the Sprouting Up Ramen, and me, the Tonkotsu Spicy.  The pros: the noodles were nice, and the pork had a nice texture (even if they were small and under seasoned).    The cons: where do I start?   - This was really expensive for the portion size!  We both paid $13 per ramen bowl, before tax and tip, and the bowl was really not that big.  Neither of us felt satisfied after our meal. - My pork broth was weirdly thick yet lacklustre in taste.  It had little fat globules throughout.  It's fine if you're into that, but I prefer a smoother broth, and the consistency just didn't sit right with me.  Also, I ordered a \"spicy\"-level spiciness bowl, yet there was zero bite... - His Sprouting Up Ramen had brussel sprouts in it.  Don't get me wrong--I enjoy brussel sprouts!  But I don't understand how you can claim to serve authentic ramen while putting brussel sprouts on them.  I'm a ramen purist snot head--I've been to my fair share of ramen places and I don't believe that these two things go together.  Along the same lines, if you're serving French fries and quinoa salad on your menu, call it what it is.  You're Asian fusion at best, not an \"authentic\" ramen shop.  I am pretty let down.  I would only return if the prices go down, and that's really only if the nearby ramen shops are closed.  As another Yelper has already mentioned, Sansotei, Kinton, and Santouka are fairly close by with cheaper and higher quality ramen, and actually I would go as far as to say that even Kenzo on Yonge is better.    PS: the final dagger into my heart happened as we left, when the hostess just BUTCHERED the pronunciation of \"arigato\".  ARGH!!"}
{"text":"We were here just now. We waited for almost one hour for our food.  Ramen shouldn't not take that long.  There were four people in the kitchen, not sure why it take this long for three bowls of ramen.  If you want a regular meal length, don't come here. Expect long wait for the food to arrive."}
{"text":"I took a sabbatical from ramen in Calgary because I hadn't had a good bowl in a while but I had to check out JINYA.    Loved it.  I ordered the JINYA Tonkotsu Black.  The broth was so flavourful (but on the fattier side) and the pork was nice and tender.   The noodles were chewy and delicious.  I had some broth leftover to decided to get extra ramen to sop up all the soup I had leftover and it was a good and bad idea.  Good because it was absolutely delicious but bad because I got so full I couldn't finish the extra noodles or order anything else!  I'll be back to try the other items on the menu.  They have a Happy Hour in the afternoon too where some menu items are discounted."}
{"text":"\"No ramen no life!\" - Wise words from a wise person  Las Vegas has been getting pretty wise these recent years, with it being the hot destination spot for ramen restaurants to open. Its crazy to think that a few years equal to the number of fingers on your hand there was only a handful percentage of residents who knew ramen beyond its instant form? In current day its the hottest thing, always in the spotlight in the local magazines, like its a trend. Thankfully it'll never die out like cupcakes or cronuts.   Jinya is the NEWEST and TRENDIEST of the ramen residents, a franchise with locations in places like California and Texas. Two pages of variety include ramen that can be suited for the carnivorous cravings and vegetarians with their Vegetable Broth Ramen. Ordering in combinations ($4-5) such as gyoza and chasu bowls will get you the best bang for your fairly spendy meal. It wouldn't be trendy without the tapas available of course. The Jinya Bun ($3.80) is a pork steam bun is worth a try (once) if you like steam buns but do pass on the kaarage or crispy chicken. I assume its called Jinya Ramen BAR because they offer various brews, many delicious Japanese beers that aren't widely available. It seems pricey, but trust that the liquor store pricing is not far off, must be the importing.   So the ramen... unfortunately I am not a fan of the four that I've tried. I blame Brittany Murphy. Her awful acting in \"Ramen Girl\" really had me thinking about the soul and heart that true artisans put in their ramen and at Jinya I just don't feel it. I'm probably just crazy though. The Tonkotsu Black and premium white broth's both have a sour finish to me. The garlic chips have a fishy taste, but that could just be me. I enjoy the taste of the chicken broth over the pork here and am much appreciative of the variety that Jinya offers.  Maybe \"Ramen Girl\" was onto something, Sorry Jinya I think there's gotta be more heart and something else beyond the dim lighting, the bidets, the iPad ordering, sushi, the 350k franchise opportunity, and community seating."}
{"text":"Excellent Ramen. Great choices. Maybe not the best service I've ever gotten but the Ramen is very good."}
{"text":"The food was fantastic. I had the edamame, takoyaki, and crispy chicken as appetizers. The crispy chicken come in 5,10, or 15 pieces and the takoyaki (octopus balls) come in 6 pieces. For the ramen I had the junta No.1 which is the tonkotsu black. There is a lot in the bowl and it fills you up right away so keep that in mind when buying appetizers. The service was really good. The servers were very nice and tend to your every need. I would definitely come again soon! So worth the money"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Ramen bars are just hitting Orlando so I didn't really know what to expect. Expect deliciousness! These are giant noodle bowls with all sorts and flavors of broth. You can choose one of their put together combos or create your own from a nice mix of ingredients, think.., nori, eggs, veggies.. yummy stuff!  The decor is cute , nice big booths and awesome big family style table. There were 7 of us and there was room for about 10 more. The dishes were fun and Asian . The service was good and quick. Even though we were staying on the strip, we drove here 2 days in a row because it was awesome."}
{"text":"Please is kinda cute but small and hard to get a private party table. It's more like a big sharing table, and chairs are very close one to another. I was hitting elbows with a stranger. Wait could be long, sometimes. Ramen is ok, the pork belly bun was really good. Service is not the greatest; nice waiters, but they don't really come to check on you, I couldn't get a drink refill. We also waited a lot for the pork belly. They do apologize about that tho, but I wouldn't wait that long again."}
{"text":"I'm not fan of ramen, but my boyfriend is, and we come here every once in a while. The atmosphere is hip and chic. It's close to the strip and the food is actually really good. They other things than ramen. The line is usually a little long but you get seated pretty fast!"}
{"text":"I pretty much checked out all other ramen places in town and I seem to keep coming back here for two reasons:  *Tonkotsu Black: it totally hit the spot *Homemade gyoza: they are juicy and good  I like the ambiance.  It doesn't look like you typical ramen shop rather a Japanese style bar.  Service is usually very good.  Check out their Happy Hour 3-5pm, 10pm-12am.  *Update: I had a quinoa kale salad with goma sesame dressing, which I forgot to mention in my review, and I really liked it. Thanks for a compliment and kind reminder Stefany V!! You rock!"}
{"text":"This is the worst ramen I have ever had.  We pretty much paid for a bowl of water with no flavor.  Cup of Noodles is better than this ramen.  The chicken wings were also dry, jerky like wings with no sauce.  They were terrible."}
{"text":"Tonight my girlfriend brought me here and I had the pleasure of having Rachel as our server , I have to say that although the place is busy the ladies and the staff here were very hospitable and on top of customer service ,  no table was left unattended no dishes on the table after guest left the staff in the kitchen was great getting food out in a good time frame ! Overall I had awesome service and food and I feel that's hard to find in vegas these days so thank you Rachel and staff"}
{"text":"Spicy Umami Miso Ramen???????????????Santouka ??????????????????Toronto??Jinya Ramen??????"}
{"text":"Ramen very enjoyable here. Good number of people but no insane lineups. Egg is cooked just right. Would recommend for casual ramen dining."}
{"text":"Quality wise, i would give it 3 stars because i have been accustomed to very good ramen (Totto, Ramen Dojo, Mensho Ramen), but I give this ramen parlor 4 stars since it was a savior for late diners like myself.  I got to Vegas at 11:40 pm , and after checking in my hotel, I figured not too many good restaurants were still open. Luckily, JINYA opened until 3 AM, so i made a trip there.  Surprisingly, there were still lots of people waiting in front of the restaurant at 12:30 AM, and I also had to wait 30 minutes before I was seated.  Quality wise, the ramen was decent. I had the Tonkotsu black ramen. The broth was decent, the meat was decent. Every thing was decent. Not too bad and not very good in my opinion. The roasted seaweed was not crunchy so that was a minus.   It came out to be $14 including tax and tips. A pretty decent choice for late night dinner in Sin city."}
{"text":"The food was absolutely excellent. I loved the ramen, and the wait was short since we came in early on a weekday. However, the lycheetini was honestly the worst cocktail I've ever had in my life. I love lychee too! It came out lukewarm. Maybe it would have been good cold but we couldn't manage to get our server's attention to correct it. Luckily the other server who cashed us out was nice and took it off our bill."}
{"text":"Vegetarian Ramen is my favorite! I've tried the Vegan ramen too! But i think i like the vegetable one better, i can add spicy to it and make it perfect! I will definitely recommend this place"}
{"text":"Ok, so from the location I wasn't sure how much I should expect from this place because it's not in the \"coolest\" spot; but once I went inside, WOW! Totally immersive experience. We had the Gyoza appetizer and it tasted amazing! Just like my mom makes at home from scratch. My boyfriend had the pork ramen soup which I loved, (of course I had to take a bite). It was more of a classic broth with thicker noodles, a little salty but probably just from the pork. Good thing I like salt! I had the spicy chicken soup. Really good, I added cilantro for some fun on the side and it was good together. The soup wasn't that spicy so if anything I'd ask to make it a bit more spicy next time.   The servers, host, and cooks were amazing! The whole staff welcomes you in and works as a team to give you great service. And when you leave the whole staff then says thank you as you walk out the door. Super friendly people. I will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Took everyone here for Saturday lunchtime. Had Jinya No 1, spicy; Jinya No 5 chicken--the sauce was amazing; Cha Cha Cha for garlic lovers, and the Chicken Chasu bowl. All was delicious and very flavorful. Great laid back atmosphere for lunch."}
{"text":"ooooooooooooooooooooOOOOOOOOOOOOooooooooh, a place sooo good, I had to review it right when I woke up the next day.  Friends from LA had been telling us about Robata Jinya opening its sister restaurant here in Vegas...and thanks to foodie friend on IG, we saw that it finally opened.  The roomie immediately \"dragged\" me here specifically for their shrimp toast as Robata's shrimp toast is his ultimate fave food. I, on the otherhand, was looking forward to trying their ramen (it is a ramen bar, afterall).  Got here around 10pm, and it was fairly slow with half the place filled. Nice décor with a large table in the middle; perfect for larger parties. You could tell that it just opened as there was still decorators tape on the mirrors and walls.  Sat down and was gladly seated by the waitress and she was very informative on the menu and what they're known for. Roomie immediately ordered the shrimp toast but, it was sadly sold out --- lemme tell you that the roomie was like, \"ohkaaay, lets leave!\" lol  We settled on fried chicken, shrimp balls, truffle fries, veggie ramen, and two combo orders of the #1 tonkatsu black ramen with charshu and Tokyo curry bowls.  Fried chicken - Nice batter on the chicken, juicy, and VERY good with or without it's ponzu dipping sauce.  Shrimp balls - First thought when biting into this deliciously crunchy cream cheese filled morsel: it tastes like shrimp chips!!!!! All you/us Asians know about shrimp chips! YUM =)  Truffle fries - Can never go wrong with anything truffle but, I just couldn't get enough of the truffle ketchup =)))))))  Tonkatsu black ramen - My new favorite as the \"thin\" noodles were al dente and just to my liking. Broth wasn't salty at all which is extra to my liking cuz I'm not into salty/miso flavors. Broth was, also, light and not too heavy which made it easier to finish the whole bowl. The mushrooms and garlic chips added the extra crunch which is always delicious. Sadly, they were out of egg so didn't add egg to these ramens; but, added extra charshu instead -- I ain't mad at that. I really liked the charshu in the ramen yet, the charchu bowl was very whatever. Their Tokyo curry rice was sweet and I don't like sweet curry. I was hoping for a more spicier version. (((((so, on that aspect - no one is touching Ramen Sora's curry and charshu bowls!)))))  Veggie ramen - Roomie found it but, thought there was tooo much veggies in there and the broth was rather bland.    Overall, a new favorite and I'd gladly come here again and, hopefully, soon! Especially since I still have yet to try their shrimp toast!   *****side note: they have the best women's bathroom....it's a BIDET with SEAT WARMERS! lol*****"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place for Ramen Chicken Wonton. The broth is very well balance and flavorful. Noodles were perfectly cooked and the portion was great. Staff was friendly and fast. Came here during work lunch hour and everything came fast."}
{"text":"Interesting experience this time at Jinya. I am a local and I came here often but I've never experienced unfriendly service or slow food service till now. The ramen took a long time to come out , we ordered ramen and gyoza combo but they forgot gyoza and it didn't come till 10 minutes after ramen when we are about to finish eating. When we asked the server, she gave us excuse of having a lot of tickets and new chef even tho the place was not  full and busy at 12am. Server was rude and almost slammed my brother's food in front of him. Also after 5 minutes into eating, someone came again to offer us another bowl of ramen which was definitely not ours. You need to get your kitchen and server together. I brought my brother and his wife who came out of town with me this time and I was embarrassed by the service that you provided."}
{"text":"Sprouting up ramen all the way!  Best in town.  Too bad it's so crowded during lunch though...."}
{"text":"Love love love this place. Always a wait but hey it's worth it right. Just found out they do take out. So now I have been ordering over the phone and just picking up with no wait. Total win win!"}
{"text":"Solid ramen, nice ambience. It's not the best ramen, but it hits the spot and they're open late."}
{"text":"Food was just okay and the experience sucked! I came in with a friend, 2 teenagers and an 8 year old. We ordered our food, which included 2 appetizers, and waited for 25 minutes before we noticed that people that were seated 15 min after us were already eating their meals and we hadn't even gotten our appetizers yet. When we finally said something to our waitress she came back and said that the kitchen was cooking it up right now, that she didn't have an iPad and had to manually put in our order and they were just really busy. What?? Why would three people that came in after us already have their food just because she had to manually put in our order? After that we watched her and somebody else scrambling to find our order. The truth is that our order completely got lost in the shuffle and they had just started working on it, which I understand happens but at least be honest about it instead of making something up lying to us. Honesty Integrity goes a long way. When the food finally did come out another 15 minutes later it was only for half of us and the rest of us got our food another 10 to 15 minutes after that. My son's kids meal which is supposed to come with a Ramen as well, was completely forgotten and he was never served.  The whole experience was really frustrating and I won't be back. The food was just okay and not worth going through that again. If they just would have acknowledged the situation and apologized that would have gone a long way and now they've lost a customer."}
{"text":"Great ramen selection. I enjoyed my meal here. I don't rmr what it was called but I rmr it being a little spicy but not too too spicy. Anyways not too much to say about this. Great spot if your looking for some LA style Japanese ramen. The layout looks great and classic. You will see me here again soon."}
{"text":"I've been stalking this location for months (okay, not really but I do work very close by). I have done my homework and read a bit about all the hype and hoola. One of the best in California they say and winners of the most flavourful broth year after year. Suffice to say I was overwhelmed with excitement by these bold claims until I had to remind myself that the \"best\" of California really isn't all that great (at least from my ramen experiences in LA).  Anyhow, for a broth that has won so many accolades and praises it's rather muted in taste. I was waiting for that flavour explosion but it never came. Somehow, they've managed to create a fatty broth that is thick yet lack depth and mouthfeel. I went with the most garlicky of broths but it was far from garlicky at all. On the other hand, the noodles were nicely done - al dente. The chasu was some of the best I've had; flavourful with a melt-in-your-mouth texture. I was a little confused at the amount of bean sprouts in my noodles and I really think this dilutes the flavour as sprouts are full of water. The eggs are nicely done and is tasty.  We also tried their takoyaki and it was delicious! This was definitely one of the highs of the meal. Ooey and gooey in the inside with tender pieces of octopus that offer a bit of chew. All on top of a nice bed of pillowy eggs that somewhat resembles scrambled eggs.  I think the number one complain by most is the price. Paying $15 for a bowl of ramen is a bit steep and you also have to factor in the large list of add-ons they offer, each at an additional cost of course. It's not difficult to end up paying $25 for your bowl of ramen after taxes and gratuity --steep!"}
{"text":"We always come here when we visit Vegas but this visit was quite disappointing. The JINYA bun and shrimp balls were good but the chicken ramen and tonkatsu ramen were bland!  With all the other ramen bars in town, not sure if we'll be back."}
{"text":"One of the best Ramen houses I've tried out here in Vegas. Gyoza is tasty and the chicken ramen bowl is simple and satisfying. Chicken wings were bombastic."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing!  After living in Japan it is hard to find a good ramen place. This is the spot!  The spicy tonkatsu #3 is my favorite. I will be seeking this place out anytime I am near one. Unfortunately there isn't one near where I live that compares. Atmosphere is causal but very nice. Service is great. And food is amazing!  Sushi Ida bit on the bland side but I don't go for that. It's called ramen house for a reason. I recommend it highly."}
{"text":"Decided to try this ramen place that I discovered and loved in Texas.  I was very embarrassed and disappointed during our dining experience because I was telling my girlfriend how good it is. We ordered  Gyoza and asked for a small spoon to stir the Gyoza sauce and was told by our waiter Gino to use our chopsticks instead. First of all, it is unsanitary to use our own chopsticks to stir the sauce container that everyone uses.  After we said that we don't want to do that he said he thought we have not used it.  Its concerning that cleanliness is not a priority for our server.  This is a reflection to the establishment and must be addressed  immediately.   #foodie #foodenthusiast"}
{"text":"You know, pretty much any day is a fine day for ramen and iced cold draft Sapporo.  And better still that I can score the beer here at the happy hour price of $3 bucks.  Although I've had better luck at this 1 ramen shop in San Diego where the happy hour Sapporo was $1.50.  But alas, this is Las Vegas, not San Diego, I know I know.    I had this month's advertised special: the chef special, Tokyo tonkotsu ramen for $11.50.  The ramen was grand.  It was thin noodle and the broth was thick and served at the right slurping temperature."}
{"text":"JINYA is a chain ramen restaurant that started in California. They have quite a few options on their menu ranging from tacos to rice bowls. I ordered their sprouted ramen which was their most popular. The sprouted ramen ($14.95) contains pork chasu, bean sprouts, crispy brussel sprouts, half an egg in chicken and pork broth.  The portion was definitely sufficient for one and served in deep bowls (everything looks better in ramen bowls lol). Like advertised on their website, Japanese ramen is all about the broth. The broth was quite clear and flavourful but not overly salty like other ramens I've had. I was surprised that they added brussel sprouts. The ramens I've had in the past rarely included greens of any sort so it was refreshing to find some veggies in the bowl. The only thing I didn't like as much would be the noodles. The noodles are apparently made in house everyday. However, I found that the noodles were too hard in texture for my liking.  On a side note, I actually really enjoyed the extra sauces at each table. They have a selection of three sauces including a chilli paste that I would recommend for those chilli fans. Overall it was good ramen and a good spot to satisfy your ramen craving without having to wait in line for too long."}
{"text":"the ramen and the soup too thick ,price so high?i wont come here again,only one can eat is the crispy chicken"}
{"text":"I LOVE ME SOME RAMEN  This place never fails to satisfy me all though they only have one option for vegans (Spicy vegan ramen) it was enough to satisfy my cravings. It is a bit of a wait but the location is pretty small in itself."}
{"text":"This place has great varied options. Has a great GF noodle option and lots of vegetarian and vegan option. I've been to the one in Santa Monica and was thrilled to find out we have one here in Vegas too.  The night we ate here was very busy with a a large number of people waiting outside. The service was top notch with every one being attentive and helpful. The main sitting space in this restaurant is a large communal table in the center of the restaurant so if you come in a group of two or more than 4 I'm guessing they seat you at the communal table."}
{"text":"Just happened to be in the area and decided to try this ramen restaurant out. We were there 10min before they opened and were their first customers that day.   Im a big fan of tonkotsu ramen and their JINYA tonkotsu black is very good. The only thing I didnt like was that their chashu was a little too brittle. I understand they want it to be tender, but theres a difference from fall of the bone tender and brittle like crumbs. The flavor was very good and the egg was soft boiled just right.  Also had their chashu bowl, but it suffered from having the same brittle chashu from the ramen. You may like it, but I prefer the chashu bowls from places like Shin Sen Gumi, Santouka or Fujin.  Their takoyaki was also very good. It was served on some sort of egg sauce. Probably shouldnt have ordered it as we already had way too much food.  I think the only 2 things I didnt like was the chashu and that I felt the price was like $1 higher for everything then it should have been. Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"hands down my favorite ramen in las vegas!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"FOOD: 4 SERVICE: 4 AMBIANCE: 4 VALUE: 4  This is one restaurant chain that's actually pretty good. Coming from the Bay Area and after experiencing one of the worst meal at the Chef of the Century \"chain\" restaurant, I was very leery when we sat down and found out that Jinya is a chain.  We were greeted with a smile by the hostess and led to a nice table for 4 for the two of us. We sat for a little while examining their menu to decide what to eat. Our waitress came to ask if we were ready to order, but since we were deciding and taking pictures, we told her \"not yet\" and she left us alone without any attitude.  We ordered the following:  1. Jinya No.1 Tapas: Chashu pork bun, pretty juicy piece of pork on a Chinese style bun.   2. Jinya No. 1 Ramen: Tonkotsu Black, thin ramen noodle served with three slices of pork chashu, Kikurage, green onions, dried Nori (seaweed), seasoned egg, garlic chips, garlic oil and fried onions in a pork broth. Very savory broth with just a hint of spice with just the right amount of accompliments, for slurping those perfectly done ramen noodles.  Taking into account of the service and ambiance, Jinya is really comparable to my favorite ramen house, Dojo, in the Bay Area."}
{"text":"All the foods were pretty salty for my taste. I had to add hot water to my Ramen and add more rice to curry to dilute saltiness. My chicken was cold and salad dressing was almost frozen. I think all the foods the prepared in advance not made to order. I am not impressed. Even though all the staff was nice, I want quality and tasty foods. Sorry probably won't be back"}
{"text":"SO GOOD. Tonkotsu white is the bomb, the baby leaf salad is so simple but delish, jinya buns are so good too. BUT, why are they ALWAYS out of seaweed salad?!"}
{"text":"09.03.2017  Came here at 3pm we were seated at 309pm. The lady took our order around 311pm. We ordered the poke tacos and jinya bun. We also ordered 2 bowls of ramen. (Jinya chicken ramen and the spouts ramen)   So our appetizers came out 5 minutes after ordering we thought cool it's pretty fast. We finished our appetizers and waited for our bowls.   We sat there talking and waiting... it was 3:30pm, we looked around and everyone after us was getting their bowls of ramen. Around 3:45pm we asked our waitress about the order, we watched her go to the cooks and of course the confused faces which made us aware that they forgot our order. The waitress came back and said it will take 5-10 more minutes. Now normally my wife and I will wait for the food because we loved Jinya so much but I had to be at work by 4:30, I didn't want to rush and eat my food and rush to work. We were also irritated how long it took. We told the waitress to cancel our order and that we will pay for the appetizers. The gentleman who was going to ring us up said not to worry about the bill which was very nice of him.   I'm not sure what happened to this place, but this was our go to for ramen. They got rid of the kale lollipop which of course we came for and was not on the menu. It was disappointing, and the experience was different. Hopefully they figure it out."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! Excellent quality and you definitely get your money's worth. Jinya is way better than Monta in every way and has the best ramen out of any that I've ever tried. It's got a great atmosphere and is a really nice place to go on a date or out with friends or family"}
{"text":"This place is live right now! Music was loud and pumping, which might not appeal to everyone. This is my first ramen fix after moving to Calgary, and Jinya did not disappoint. I had the tonkotsu ramen. The broth was rich and flavourful; the noodles had just the right amount of teeth to them. Garlic was free (yay!) and I was given fresh garlic and a press. I loooove raw garlic in my ramen (much to the dismay of anyone in talking range) and this made me very happy. I'll be sure to try the other options soon!"}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this new place.  Ordered the  Tonkasu assari combo with the gyoza and salad. Ramen noodles was good ,Soup just a little to salty. Pork is too thin and brakes apart. Decent size , I like it more then monta because monta give you so little noodles that  it doesnt fill you up. Salad was really bland. The dressing was garlic? Ginger? I dont know  what it was but it tasted like nothing,  all I taste is the oil. The gyoza was really bad. I mean I gyoza itself was good. The fillings was good but they cook mine with a dirty pan and the bottom isnt even crispy but its soft and black from a dirty pan. I whipe it on a napkin and it was all black. I dont know ill go back , maybe I more try."}
{"text":"Really, really liked the ramen here.  Fresh, well seasoned, and diverse ingredients.  Tried two different ones on two visits and liked both.  Sorry, I didn't write down the names, but the one with the pork chasu was the best.  Shrimp tempura appetizer was very good too.    Happy hour drink and beer specials were good, and staff were polite, friendly, and attentive.   Will go again."}
{"text":"I don't think I've ever had a GOOOOOOD bowl of Chicken Ramen before.  Not until my return visit to Jinya Ramen.  Not surprising, the place was quite busy when I arrived at 1:30am, but it didn't take long to get seated.  As much as I wanted to get their Black Tonkotsu Ramen that I've had before and enjoyed, I was really curious about their Jinya Chicken Ramen when I saw it on the menu.  Jinya Chicken Ramen -- http://bit.ly/2hI4iMy The Chicken Ramen was delicious!  The Chicken \"Chashu\" were thin slices of chicken breast that were moist and tender and actually melted in my mouth with the soup.  I was not expecting that and it was a welcome surprise for me.   I definitely would order this again!  Unfortunately that night I was only hungry enough for a bowl of ramen and didn't have any room for their epic appetizers, which I'm pretty sure next time I'll tackle because I love their famous Shrimp Balls!  I'm glad to see that Jinya is still a great late night ramen spot that's not too far away from the Strip.  It's still my favorite Ramen spot in Vegas and everything on the menu that I've had has been amazing so far!"}
{"text":"If you're from SoCal or have tried anything better than SoCal ramen don't eat here you will also be disappointed. That being said this was a decent place, the ramen was ok not anything amazing, but the service as very good so they get a 3 Star from me."}
{"text":"This place was Ah-Mazing!  Travel off the strip for a great price and even better ramen. I had the spicy umami miso bowl and the curry rice. So good. Wish they had one in Madison."}
{"text":"My cousin and I went there for the first time and the waiter was explaining  everything we love spicy he Said there was the hot oil on the side we put a lot and nothing near hot and spicy at all and we asked him for the hot sauce he talked to his manager and came back and told us they couldn't give us any hot sauce that was disappointed and the broth was a little bit salty"}
{"text":"Quite a bit of space and seating for a ramen place. Good service and easy to get seating at lunch.  Tried the sprouting up ramen and it was really tasty. Not too salty and maybe the best brussel sprouts I ever had, full of flavour. The noodles are supposedly hand made in shop and they were really chewy and delicious. Aslo tried the takoyaki and it was crisp and soo hot inside, really enjoyed it.  Overall a nice experience, I would return."}
{"text":"First time having ramen in vegas and I must say its not bad! Lets start with the good stuff : chicken ramen was very light and not too salty just the way I like it, the gyoza was perfectly cooked crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside,as for the salmon avocado it was a little on the salty side, but the salmon was very fresh. As for their service its pretty subpar, they take your order and then they bring out the food, had to ask for anything else that we needed."}
{"text":"Best Ramen ever!!! We got the Brussels Sprouts tempura to start and the Creamy Spicy Vegan Ramen and Vegetable Ramen and it was SO delicious!!! Can't wait to come back!!"}
{"text":"I don't know why everyone are so crazy about this place,I honestly don't like that fat stincky broath blah"}
{"text":"Great menu Love the Spicy chicken ramen.  Brussel Sprouts Tempura is awesome.  Nice ambience. Very clean open kitchen.  I only wish they had longer hours.  They offer Vegan dishes also.  I highly recommend trying it."}
{"text":"????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"JINYA is a GREAT little place to have that trendy Noodle Bar lunch when you are on the West side of town.  Just up the street from the Palms.   The service was great and the waitress knew the menu items.   Pricing was good.  Food quality was good as well.   Just go check it out.   You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"First time there. The staff is very friendly and the restaurant has a nice set up. The music is too loud, making conversations challenging.   The brussel sprouts tempura was quite salty, the fried chicken was too greasy and the Cha Cha Cha ramen was ok. Not my favourite ramen, but I believe it worth a second shot to try a couple of different ramen flavours."}
{"text":"Located on the corner of Carlton and Church street near College TTC station.  Came here after skating at Mattamy Athletic Centre.  Once you enter they shout a Japanese greeting to you and nicely walk you to your table.  Service is friendly and attentive.  Food comes out at a reasonable amount of time.  I read reviews that the ramen wasn't good and overpriced and the sides were good so I just ordered sides from their happy hour menu.  After ordering the first items that came out were the fried chicken and salads.  The fried chicken was really good.  Lightly battered, lightly seasoned and really juicy meat.  Pretty good for $5.80 happy hour price.  Never had poke tacos before so wanted to give it a try.  Taco shells were nice and crunchy and went well with the soft poke texture.  They also added some veggies that didn't overpower the poke too much.  Each taco was small and can be finished in two bites.  $5.80 happy hour price was a bit high for this considering that's the same cost of the fried chicken which was much better.  My friends wanted to try the ramen and they said it was salty, underwhelming and prices were too high for what you get.  On your way out of the restaurant they shout arigato/thank you."}
{"text":"I decided to try this place because they are the closest ramen restaurant from my apartment and didn't disappoint me.   Since they have only 1 vegetarian/vegan option, I had to order their vegetable ramen. It was pretty good, the noodle was too thin and tasted more like somen noodle though. I found it interesting that they put salad vegetables on the ramen so I felt like eating ramen and salad at the same time. lol  Actually I liked their takoyaki more than the ramen. It was definitely one of the best takoyaki I have ever tried in my life. Outside was so crispy but inside was chewy... Yum!  The service was good too. They came to bring water every 10 minutes.   BTW I was surprised when I saw the counter for the drive through outside. It was closed though"}
{"text":"Been here three times and each time was delicious. I always get the Tonkatsu Ramen as the pork broth is tasty and the tonkatsu just melts in your mouth. The atmosphere is a little dark and can get crowded if it is busy (it isn't very huge inside). Love this place!"}
{"text":"Came here twice. Food is really good, love the refillable iced green tea and the variety of snacks. I had the Tokyo Yatai Ramen both times, sooooo good. Flavor was on point, not too greasy and light. Definitely ask for the fresh garlic which you can grade into the soup. Karrage was good too, nice and crispy.  TakoYaki was the best I have had! Reason why it is missing a star is because of service. Seemed like they were all students and wasnt as experienced. Service can be improved, although friendly but not as attentive."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch after skating at Maple Leaf Gardens.  It says authentic ramen but the staff seems mostly not Japanese.  I ordered the sprouting up ramen $12.75.  Never had ramen with brussel sprouts before.  It consists of half an egg, two thin slices of pork, bean sprouts, brussel sprouts and thick noodles.  The broth was salty. The portion was not that big. I was still hungry after eating.  Not a good value for the price.  Probably won't repeat."}
{"text":"The restaurant is packed with people.  Service is very good.   Many choices of ramen.   My husband ordered pork ramen, very tasty."}
{"text":"Their pudding dessert is amazing!!! The pork ramen is yummy. Great casual place to go for lunch or dinner with a date or a group of friends. Prices are decent. Good portions. Friendly staff."}
{"text":"Ordered around 12:45am for pickup and was told that it would be a 30 min wait. I just got off work and wasn't in a hurry so I was cool with the wait. I ordered Cha Cha Cha which is for garlic lovers with a chashu bowl and salad and I ordered Tonkatsu Spicy for my boyfriend. The employee who answered the phone asked for my name and number and when I arrived to pickup she had actually called my cell phone. I wasn't expecting that and I don't think any other restaurant has ever done that, but that was actually really nice and convenient to know that they call you when your orders ready.   My bowl tasted so good! It was full of flavor and boy am I a garlic lover! Deeelicious! I thought the soup was lacking quantity because it wasn't covering the noodles and pork chashu completely and I tend to like my soup really.. well soupy!   The chashu pork bowl was good as well and it was just the right size. Not so much to make you full but enough that you'll want more. Salad was ok, I can't put my finger on what the dressing is made from. The Tonkatsu bowl was really good a little kick to it.   All in all really good food. I'll be back! It's a plus that it's right down the street from my boyfriends' place."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Ramen bars in Vegas.  Good options of Ramen. Worth the wait each time.   One thing though- I always get the Cha Cha Cha for garlic lovers. The server today wouldn't sub my thick noodles with thin. All the other times (and I've been here a total of around ten) I was able to. The other servers were awesome at catering to my request, despite what the menu stated. This particular server was so quick to say no to the request, it ruined my experience today.   I didn't catch her name- she was a short thin Asian female with short hair. The description doesn't really help. Avoid this server at all costs. Very rude and not welcoming. All the other servers and hosts are phenomenal, esp. the males. I'm sad I didn't get this server's name.   Despite the experience, I consumed the meal halfway although it wasn't the same and took the rest to-go. I will definitely be back.... but will refuse this server! She's probably new since it's my first time seeing her."}
{"text":"Outstanding food! Excellent service! Pleasant setting. Good selection of beer including porter and stout. My wife and I had No. 1 and No. 2 with the pig's ear chicarone and the JINYA bun. Had to have seconds on the bun. This place has been added to our 'Return for More' list and it's taken the top spot."}
{"text":"Haven't been to Jinya in a very long while and glad the quality of their ramen is just as good as I remember it. Glad that they're open for lunch (last time I stopped in was when they only opened early evening). New menu items, new and old ramen choices, and friendly and attentive wait staff will have me coming back again for sure. Make sure to save room for one of their bomb in house popsicles. Got the matcha green tea with pistachios and was mind blown!"}
{"text":"At my daughters suggestion we visited Jinya Ramen Bar (just down the street) I had the Chicken Chashu Bowl and  Pork Chashu & Kimchee. Others at the table had ramen (Chicken and Vegetarian) Everyone was happy with the food, quantity and a general feeling that supper could be put off for an extra hour or more. My food was well presented (a big factor) and of excellent quality and taste. Staff and the location were excellent. A comfortable place for a relaxing meal with folks you like."}
{"text":"One of my favorite ramen places in Las Vegas. Customer service is great, they very quick and carrying. Since I don't eat pork, I love their Jinya chicken ramen and Vegetable chicken ramen. The only thing I find annoying is the music a lil bit too loud."}
{"text":"No complaints. We were seated fast, got our drinks super quick, food came fast and was DELICIOUS. I had the spicy chicken ramen and my girlfriend had the tonkotsu black. 10/10 recommend"}
{"text":"Lunch with my Yelp Twinsie, Joyce, from Arizona in Las Vegas. ..what a fantastic story!  How can 2 people meet online and become close friends? ?  Yelpers have so much in common!   Back to Jinya Ramen:  There are 7 Jinya locations in California. This is the first one in Nevada. There are none in Hawaii. What does this mean?   Answer: I need to eat ramen with Twinsie at Jinya Las Vegas.  It was a bit chilly outside since it's November - a good atmosphere for a warm dish. I ordered the Pig Ears (JINYA No. 2 Chicharron) to share,  but I had difficulty eating it because it sadly had some firey hot sauce (harissa) on it.  I did enjoy a few bites of its crunchy goodness and some of the fried kale and soft tamago (egg) that accompanied it!  Mmmm!   Twinsie smartly ordered the Takoyaki...oh wow!  Pop one of those tako balls in your mouth and enjoy! !  The texture of the octopus was a \"just right\" chewy - not mushy nor rubbery!   I had the Tonkotsu Assari because it had THICK noodles. The other goodies included the kikurage (aka black fungus), pork chashu, & seasoned egg. YUM!!!  The variety of ingredients was fun so that I wasn't bored! Chewing on al dente noodles makes me happy!   Some readers may not like this part, but I MUST mention it because it was a \"BAM\" moment for me: the HEATED toilet seat in the restroom!!!  Now remember - in the beginning - that I mentioned that it was a chilly November in Las Vegas. ..I mean like in the 40s...  Yeah.  It's a rare thing to find anything heated in Hawaii. ..like a car seat.  So, I really notice and appreciate little thoughtful gestures such as this!  First of all, the restroom is very dim. I guess it's supposed to be a calming atmosphere?  Anyway. ..just sit down and relax! None of that cold, \"wake up suddenly\", shocking kind of feeling. ..but very gentle and soothing! Ahhhh... hahaha!   So, I'm looking forward to another Jinya visit. ..wondering if all locations have this special customer treatment?  ;)  Thanks to Twinsie for such a memorable lunch!  Luv ya!!"}
{"text":"I'm new to the world of ramen so I will say that my opinions are  not based on a refined or cultured palate, lol.  Went in for dinner, the hostess seated us promptly, and the servers were very quick to place our order and bring out our items. One was nice enough to ask if it was our first time there, which it was, so she explained the menu a bit. That was very nice. The actual restaurant is very clean, modern, and very pretty compared to hole in the wall places. The bathroom even has those super modern toilets that have seat warmers and the lid goes up on its' own lol! So cool!  We ordered the fried chicken and salmon roll for appetizers and the spicy chicken ramen and the wonton chicken ramen. The fried chicken was among the best I have ever had from anywhere. I highly recommend it! The salmon roll but was pretty standard to any sushi restaurant. The ramen noodles were thin, and explained in the menu, so that was a little different. I prefer the thicker cut noodles but no harm done. It said in the menu so you can't be surprised by it. My wonton soup tasted like any wontons. Enjoyable but won't send you off into another dimension, lol.   For 2 bowls and 2 appetizers,  the bill was about $36 so reasonable prices as well. I will definitely go back but I do feel like other ramen places might have more flavor. Or, again, maybe this is the correct way to make ramen? I feel bad commenting as I know nothing of the preparations of ramen...this is just my opinion. :-)  I did, however, end up getting pretty sick almost immediately while eating. I was on an empty stomach so I know it was the food there. HOWEVER I have a very sensitive stomach, especially to new foods, and the other person I went with ate everything I did and they were fine so I definitely do not blame the restaurant. I just recommend coming in with a good solid stomach lol."}
{"text":"Been to this place before and they have new ramen..sukiyaki ramen was delicious.. the chicken bun is also good ..it's a new one as well but I prefer the pork belly steam bun....I'll come back again..."}
{"text":"Finally had a chance to check out JINYA, originally I had been wanting to try a bunch of their appetizers but I ended up going directly from post-work drink/snacks at another restaurant to dinner at JINYA so my appetite just couldn't handle that, alas, another time. The restaurant was packed for a Tuesday night and since it was chilly out it was the perfect night for a hot bowl of ramen. I had the Tonkatsu Spicy, Spicy. The broth was flavourful, the noodles were chewy and the pork was flavourful and melt in your mouth tender - no complaints! Our server was awesome, super friendly and attentive, he did ask if we needed extra noodles but we all declined, I find ramen super filling and never need more but it's good to know the option is there. I didn't find the Tonkatsu Spicy that Spicy but it was really well flavoured, there's a hot and a mild option as well so you can adjust the flavouring to your liking."}
{"text":"Always love a spicy bowl of ramen in the middle of winter.  Price points are fair and their spicy levels are good too.  Great staff."}
{"text":"Love the late night opportunity to eat at JINYA! Always so accomodating and the food broke da mouth at 2 in the morning"}
{"text":"Really love the takoyaki here! What Jinya does differently with their takoyaki is they put it on a bed of eggs which really adds a nice touch. If you like your noodles al dente, you'll like Jinya. I really enjoyed the texture of my thick ramen noodles in the Tonkotsu Spicy ramen. I hate soft, mushy ramen. The flavor of the broth was pretty decent and not overly salty. I ordered it \"hot\" but wasn't really impressed with the spice level. Disclaimer: I have a really high tolerance for spicy food. The seasoned egg was boiled to perfection with the yolk still runny. The chashu here is really tender and almost melts in your mouth. The service here blows. I'm not sure if they are understaffed or if they are just slow. There was not a line when my group came in for lunch AND there were open tables but it took us 15 minutes to get seated."}
{"text":"I come here frequently and always get the spicy chicken ramen for about 10$ it's so good I love it"}
{"text":"I've been super hesitant to try a Ramen bar, I'm just not a noodle kind of man. And the last time I ate Ramen (somewhere else I won't name) I got extremely sick. But most of my co workers love to come here at least once a week after a long shift at work so this time I decided to come through. I was pretty impressed at how the place was set up. It was a very social setting with all tables kind of close and they had this huge square tables in the middle you could share with other patrons. The lighting was new and elegant and dimmed perfectly for the time of the night it was. My friend and I were the last to join the table. We saw them so we decided to just roll ride over without really talking to the hostess. Something I generally still wait for out of courtesy but my friend darted over there so I was like okay I'll follow (sorry hostess). I sat down in the seat next to our friends and my section of the table had sake spilled all in front of me and finished plates to my right. I was like oh it's ok like I sat myself this is obviously my fault. I didn't give them proper time to clean this up before I sat....BUT unfortunately it sat there for 20 more minutes as I sat there. I even got my order taken and it wasn't taken away.  I decided to stack up all the plates and cups for them nicely and push it to the right seat of me which was empty. And then I wiped the table with this napkin I also found laying around next to the plates and finally wiped all the sake off my area. I'm not sure if this was them punishing me for seating myself or maybe they just didn't see it but whatever I recognize half of it is my fault for seating early so you still get 4 stars. I would of gave you 5 even if someone picked it up in 10 minutes of me sitting. I'm pretty fair. The food was awesome by the way. And I recommend the Coedo Shiro beer. It goes well with everything on the menu."}
{"text":"By far my favorite ramen spot in Las Vegas. I got the spicy ramen and it was amazing. Spice level just right & full of flavor. Service was great, they constantly refill your water and check if everything's ok. I also tried their deep fried Brussel sprout, delicious! Very different yet yummy. Two people recommended this place and I'm glad I finally tried it! Defiantly will be coming back."}
{"text":"Came here again yesterday and unfortunately have to update my review and give it a lower rating. Jinya has decided to change their ramen noodles.  Everything overall isn't bad, but the noodles tasted a bit odd, it reminds me of the noodles that are used to make Chinese chow mein. I asked the hostess if the noodles changed, she said yes, then I asked if there was an option to order the noodles they used to serve and she said no. I don't know why they decided this change needed to happen, but I'm not on board with it."}
{"text":"I'm a very picky ramen expert and I gotta say, this place was off the chain. Me and my friends were looking for a late night snack while in Vegas and one of the places that popped up was this one. They close pretty late and we were stoked about it! The ambiance is really dim and the waitresses are really hip.   I ordered the tonkatsu and the broth was really hot and creamy like it should be. I literally ate all the broth due to how much I loved it. I would totally come here again for it.  I also got the karage.... Pretty good chicken but a bit pricey..."}
{"text":"Rich broth...love the thick noodles. Now my favorite ramen place in town. Totally worth trying."}
{"text":"Ask me to get ramen and I'll probably say no. I usually have ramen twice a year.   It was about that time of the year and I decided on Jinya. This place may have changed the way I see ramen.   I came here right when they opened. I noticed it started to fill up about the time we left, 4.   I decided on the black ramen combo, which came with a salad and another side. I chose Chashu pork. The ramen broth was nice and light. I really enjoyed the thin noodles. This bowl was huge too. As I was eating, I felt like it kept refilling itself like in Harry potter. There was a good amount of meat, but not too much. The Chashu pork was also delicious! I absolutely loved the egg that came with it. The combo is definitely a bang for your buck kind of deal  3-5 is when they have happy hour. I didn't actually get anything off the happy hour menu, but I'd be down to come back and try it sometime.  The service was pretty attentive. They made sure we were enjoying our food. When we were trying to decide what to get, the waiter brought over the sign for the new ramen they had, just so we could have an easier time deciding."}
{"text":"Wish we had a great place like this where I live in California. Open floor plan, non claustrophobic like many other small ramen places. Poke tacos are fantastic! Service was great, played awesome current edm, young staff. The ramen was perfect, egg was perfectly cooked? And the noodles taste fresh. I will be sure to visit this place very time we go to Vegas."}
{"text":"I honestly don't know why this place has a rating of 4 stars when it clearly deserves 5! Had dinner there last night. The place always seems busy which means they serve great food inside. The check-in process seems very fair and even though it was a bit of a wait at the entrance on a Friday night the line seemed to go really fast. Me and my husband ordered black tonkotsu and spicy chicken ramen, everything was delicious and the prices seemed fair as well. They also have an amazing happy hour deals between 10 pm and midnight, where you can get 3 dollar appetizers, drinks and deserts. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Consistency, people! Consistency is what I look for! Consistently good, not bad!   This place delivers on consistency and is the first restaurant (on my radar) that defies the famous quote \"if better is possible, good is not enough\" - my 10th grade music teacher, simply because I have no idea how it can get any better.   They are consistent with the service, the sound level of the music, the decor, the staff, but most importantly... The food!   Sorry folks, today I wasn't starving so I only ordered one bowl of ramen. Usually I would order more. I also ordered the same thing as last time just to see if they maintained the same level of godliness and also because I was craving cha cha cha as well. Needless to say, it definitely satisfied my cravings as well as maintained its level of godliness.   The ramen noodles were perfectly al dente, some people might think it's too chewy or under done, but to me and many others as well this is absolutely perfect. I even wanted to ask if these ramen noodles were from the famous sun ramen company(?).   The pork and broth and loads of garlic was nothing short of greasy, oily, flavourful, salty, unhealthy, warm, porky, hearty, goodness. This isn't a healthy dish, and I don't feel bad for saying that, so don't order the cha cha cha hoping for some extremely healthy bowl of noodles. It's definitely not. It's full of strong flavour, but yet there are subtleties in there that are just WOW. The pork was so tender, I would drink the broth out of a shoe if I could, and there's no shortage of garlic in this dish. So, if you are going on a date or are sensitive to the breath of others or yourself, make sure you bring some mints or just stay away from this dish if you don't like garlic!  I also took additional picture of this place today! Incase you guys didn't know, they have this Instagram competition thing where if you take a picture of your bowl of ramen and tag something then you can enter to win a free bowl of ramen. I'll include that picture in my review!   I will definitely be back next time and I will order something different!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place but it was one of the most bland unflavorful Japanese meals ever.  The meal started with hot green tea in a teabag. Not a good impression.  Then we ordered appetizers consisting of the pork tacos and the tempura Brussel sprouts. The tacos were decent but the Brussels sprouts were tasteless. There was no sauce. Tried using the gyoza sauce and hot sauce on the table but nothing worked. It might have been better if they provided a simple tempura sauce.  The ramen was average at best.  I think Monta is heads and shoulders the best ramen in town.  They set the bar."}
{"text":"Im not sure what happened to this place. I used to come here all the time, and even brought family and friends along. I don't know if it was taken over by a new owner or they switched out all the chefs. However it has drastically changed. The food does not taste the same. Yet its more expensive. The music is still too loud, and they really need to do something about the pile-up at the door. They need some type of paging system, some outside seating or something. It's always super congested whenever you go in there. I understand that you have to wait, but to have a pile-up of people at the door is absolutely ridiculous, not to mention confusing. I won't be back unfortunately. Its no longer worth it to me."}
{"text":"Good ramen.  Service overall was great, ladies were friendly and one seemed super Japanese lol.  Anyways this was the first time I had ramen where the noodles were super thick and chewy. I thought it was pretty good.  I forgot what dishes we ordered so I'll update this later.  Would I recommend this place? Yes  Will it blow your mind? Not sure, but it's pretty tasty  Would I come back? If I'm not hitting buffets in Vegas, definitely."}
{"text":"Wound up being disappointed by Jinya. I didn't read any Yelp reviews before I visited; now that I have, it appears Jinya has consistency issues and that would explain my experience as well.  I had the namesake tonkotsu black ramen while my friend got the spicy chicken ramen. Now, don't get me wrong; I love garlic, but I just wasn't a fan of the garlic flavor here. And the garlic taste was so overpowering and the broth was also so salty that it completely covered up everything else. To be honest, I couldn't even have told you it was tonkotsu base - that's how crazily garlic-ky and salty it was. To top it off, my broth was lukewarm, so I'm not even sure what they were doing in the kitchen. Even at the bottom of my bowl, I doubt the broth was even 120F.  My friend's spicy chicken ramen was much, much better. It wasn't overly salty and the broth had a nice creamy and smooth feel to it, and it worked really well with the spiciness.  I also really liked the iced green tea, which seemed like it was actually brewed tea. Super tasty and refreshing.  So yeah, if I decide to come back - I would definitely go for the spicy ramen or maybe the namesake white. But the tonkotsu black was enough of a disaster that I'm not really enthused about the prospect."}
{"text":"American style ramen. If you are an Asian, you won't like the food that much. The seat arrangement would be better when there're more separate tables. The service is good though."}
{"text":"Ordered ahead for pick up & it was ready as soon as I walked in the door. #2 Cha Cha Cha was delicious, I would definitely recommend the THICK noodles. Big portion #Tokyo (pork & chicken, clear broth) also VERY delicious. Hit the spot and was extremely satisfying. Love to eat here again"}
{"text":"Terrible Service! I'm usually never the person to write reviews, but my recent visit here was awful. I ordered the spicy ramen and my food came immediately. I was pleased by how quick the service was but once I tried the noodles it was not cooked properly. I told our server that my noodles were not cooked correctly and he took a sample to bring to the cook. The server stated that the noodles are usually like this when it's spicy but you couldn't even bite into it. The noodles taste as if they were microwaved. I'm very disappointed with the the outcome since this was a solid spot for me to visit. Never coming here again!"}
{"text":"This is a regular spot for and friend and I. By far one of the best ramen places in Toronto. We also want to venture and try other dishes but not matter what we default to the garlic ramen. The egg is cooked perfectly and the broth is amazing."}
{"text":"Jinya! One of my top favorite ramen joints to eat at. I've tried a few different bowls but my never fail always satisfying choice is definitely the tonkotsu black. Delicious pork flavored broth with an extremely creamy mouthfeel. Must have!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places for ramen! Waitresses are always friendly, ramen is delicious and the chicken karage is addicting. I haven't tried the \"lounge\" side of the restaurant but the regular side is A ok in my book. We will have to go back soon and try the fried Oreo which was recommended to us by our waitress last time but we were just too full to order it. We will definitely be back, especially since they are open much earlier than other ramen places. Perfect for when I'm crave ramen after a long night shift!"}
{"text":"Other than the light that kept flicking above our table, this place has a hip and cool atmosphere. I had the Tonkotsu Assari (8.50) and wasn't that impressed. The flavor of the soup base was just ok. For a few more bucks, you can make your meal into a combination. I chose the pork chashu bowl & salad and enjoyed it more than my ramen. Best thing about the meal was their crispy chicken and lychee martini."}
{"text":"For my first ramen experience ever (I know guys, I'm late to the party), I was so stoked on this place. They did not disappoint and gave me many reasons to understand why people love ramen so much. The restaurant itself is beautiful. I went at midnight and it was dark and intimate. There was also tons of parking and I had no issues finding the place. The staff was so friendly and made my experience less stressful due to I had no idea what to order. I can appreciate the clean, simple menu with no fuss, especially it being my first time. Do not let this fool you though, the food is no where near simple.. It's freaking amazing! I got one of the options with spicy chicken.. And I still have cravings to this day! So if you ever want to experience Jinya.. Hit me up because I want more!"}
{"text":"The broth was extremely heavy and oily. A great option for late night ramen but not my first choice in  Vegas."}
{"text":"I tried many ramen places here in southern California, this one is just about good as the others I've gone too, although line wait is long at peak hours, I think they call your name in a considerably amount of good time, great ramen and good service."}
{"text":"Does the world end if you go to a ramen bar and don't eat ramen?  Not at all!!  This has been a bookmarked place for many months since I drove by on Flamingo and read the Yelp reviews especially from Philip T, Leonel M, Candace C.  I dropped a friend at McCarran and then made it across the Strip and here in good time.  I arrived just about 6 PM and stood there like a jerk!  One of the people waiting told me to sign the sheet on a stand.  This is the way you get \"in line.\"  The restaurant is small with about 5 seats at the bar, tables on three sides, and a large square table in the center around which there are about 20 seats for more communal dining.  Being solo, that was fine for me.  Having checked the menu in advance, I had decided not to get ramen but to concentrate on two or three of Jinya's small plates.  I ordered a Jinya bun--pork chasu with cucumber, sauce, and Jinya's kewpie mayo on a bao bun.  The sandwich was good.  I also got the smallest order--5 pieces--of crispy chicken.  What a nice breading for these chicken pieces.  Take care to let them cool a bit because the chicken is fiercely hot inside when first served.  Finally, I had asked the server if I could get a half order of takoyaki and she said they don't normally do it but she'd order it for me.  Instead of 6 pieces, I got 3 wonderfully flavored octopus rounds with a wonderful sauce.  (Thanks for the heads up, Philip!)  Rounding out the meal, I got the panna cotta for dessert.  The graham cracker squares gave a good texture to the panna cotta.  It was a good, light choice to end the meal.  When I left at about 7 PM, there was a long line.  Be prepared to wait or come earlier.  Next time I'll get ramen!"}
{"text":"LOVED IT!!!! Totally lives up to the popularity and hype. It took forever to get a seat but I'm glad I waited.   Garlic Ramen: I was in love with this dish. The thick ramen in this matched perfectly well with the soup garlicy tonkotsu and overall was super super flavorful. I couldn't believe how amazing the flavor was in the broth. Mine also came with a full soft boiled egg that was cooked to perfection. Runny, thick yoke and soy sauce flavored outside. The chasu was also bomb!!!! So flavorful and tender.  Karaage: Huge pieces. We got 5 pieces and expected them to be such tiny pieces, but noooo. These were huge, about the size of a golfball or bigger. The flavor of it was ok. Not enough marinade to make it so flavorful, but it was good because hey, it's fried food.  Takoyaki: loved loved loved this appetizer. Comes with 6 balls and each made excellent. I can't really describe the flavor of it, but it definitely tasted authentic like I've eaten in Japan. Maybe it shined with the octopus flavor that is usually lacking in other places' takoyaki. Not sure. But presentation was great, didn't want to eat it cuz it was so pretty.  As for the scenery, it has a dark Japanese bar feel. They played modern top 40/EDM music, which didn't really fit the setting, but it was enjoyable. There isn't a ton of seating, and I would not recommend a huge party. This is probably why it took forever to get seated.  Conclusion: super delicious, yummy, will definitely want to come back for sure!"}
{"text":"A friend was in town from California and we were dying for some noodles. Cons: super long wait especially if you are starving. Took about 40 Minutes to be seated. Pros: Service was quick and food was delicious. This was on a weekday, also NYE. Not sure how the wait is usually but I would recommend and definitely will come back. I was told they do NOT take reservations  Update: returned yesterday around noon, about a 5 minute wait and food was even better this time. Try the poke tacos for a appetizer... yummy!!!! Enjoy"}
{"text":"This is my 7th time here and it won't be the last. Everytime the service has been exceptional, the food phenomenal, and the atmosphere really chill. If you're looking for a great ramen place, don't look anywhere else. Come here, you won't regret it. I swear it on my ancestors."}
{"text":"There's a wait to be seated...just like any other ramen joint. I got the jinya tonkotsu black ramen bowl, delish. Cannot wait to try other bowls. The price is great and service is good."}
{"text":"At first I was pretty skeptical about this place because it had been on dirty dining consider that it just opened couple months ago, but because this place just opened I figure I would try it out anyway.  The ambiance is pretty nice and the food we ate was delicious. I wasn't a big fan of the crispy chicken, it was hard to chew and nothing about it wowed me. The shrimp toast and Brussels sprouts tempura in the other hand was pretty good. I definitely also recommend spicy miso Tonkotsu ramen.   Our server was very knowledgable with the menu and attentive which made the experience even better. Tipped her 20% because she earned it lol. I also like the fact that they are open late.  I must add, the toilet is pretty fancy!"}
{"text":"I decided to cheat on my beloved Ramen Sora and try Jinya after a long day. Dim lighting with hip and trendy vibe. Then seeing a couple cuddling/holding hands got me wondering, \"where am I? Why am I here?\" I felt out of place but soon realized I was just there to eat a bowl of ramen.   Oh.  SERVICE Casual and prompt. Based on few visits, service here can be hit or miss. On my very first visit, we were the only one there yet we waited over 40min. Our server got off his shift in a middle of serving us so he ditched our table completely. What was even better was that kitchen staff threw away our order=reason why we didn't get any of our order.   FOOD First off, Jinya Bun from their appetizer is a MUST. Fluffy bun with super tender, mouth-watering meat inside.   Tonkotsu Assari (~$9): \"Assari\" refers to something light/not too heavy. Broth was flavorful, albeit too salty and oily for my liking. I didn't see anything \"assari\" about the broth.  Noddle was thick and had a chew. One and only thing I liked about my bowl of ramen was the egg.   CONCLUSION I still like Ramen Sora all the way. They have everything down to perfection, from service to their always amazingly delicious ramen. Jinya is open late so might stop by in the future for late night ramen fix."}
{"text":"Had the Jinya buns and hiyashi (cold) ramen special with sesame sauce. Both were great, among the best I've had. I would especially recommend the sesame sauce on the hiyashi ramen. It reminded me of a cold sesame sauce ramen I had once in Tokyo which I've never been able to find outside Japan. Only reason for four stars is that the waitress was too loud and aggressive."}
{"text":"I have discovered  tonight I am not a fan of ramen. That being said, this was a nice clean restaurant with a lovely staff. Our server was so sweet and patient. I loved the fried chicken and the salad was wonderful. I guess romen  is just not my thing."}
{"text":"I had higher expectations for this location considering I'm from LA & the JINYA that I'm use to has exceptional service and better food quality. I would assume the food would be the same since it's the same company, but I was definitely let down this time. We ordered takoyaki, sweet potato \"fries,\" the chefs special tonkotsu and the tonkotsu black for me. I requested for no mushroom and when I received my ramen there were mushrooms as if they disregarded my request. Also the worst part was that there were pieces of egg shells on top of my egg. I was so shocked and upset that they didn't have quality control with their ramen. Not only was this such a disappointing experience, but the management just seemed so stand-offish like sheesh shouldn't you be able to accommodate to customers when it's their fault?  Never coming back when I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"I kind of like to think of myself as a ramen connoisseur so decided to try this place out last night with my friend. The place has a pretty nice interior with a huge table right in the middle for large groups I'm assuming. The waitress greeted us promptly and was attentive at first but as the meal went on the customer service disappeared.  For appetizers we got quinoa salad and takoyaki. The quinoa salad was very tasty and would gladly get it again. The takoyaki was very delicious, probably the best I've had in Vegas honestly.  For ramen we both got the regular spicy one. We weren't expecting bean sprouts in our ramen and don't really like them but we shouldn't been attentive in the menu seeing it was on it. The broth was good but the noodles tasty pretty sturdy. Not sure if they're packaged noodles or if they just didn't cook the noodles long enough.   As I said earlier the waitress was attentive at first but weirdly disappeared. The meal was whatever but the appetizers would bring me back."}
{"text":"I was near Loblaws last Friday night and contemplating another expensive salad bar dinner when Jinya Ramen caught my eye. I'd been walking past for a while now and meaning to try it. I headed on over and was quickly seated by the hostess and given a menu.   I ordered the vegan spicy ramen and a Cameron's Brewery red ale. The vegan ramen was really tasty but not spicy at all, I definitely had to add some hot sauce to give it a kick. The beer was delicious, I'll definitely be seeking it out again.  in comparison to Ramen Isshin (my favorite in the city) Jinya scores and loses a few points.  Pros: - Very attentive customer service. My server was always accessible and she did return promptly after 'giving me a few minutes' but without bring pushy - Nice decor and different seating options for solo eaters, groups and couples - Lovely food presentation - You can custom add all sorts of things as toppers to your ramen. Brussel sprouts, peanuts, you name it. I thought this was a cool idea and a good differentiator.  Cons - As mentioned the spicy vegan ramen wasn't spicy. It also wasn't actually vegan as they served it to me. The vegan noodle option is the spinach noodles and they cost extra. Even though I ordered a vegan dish the server didn't ask me about the noddles. This is ok for me as a vegetarian but I feel that a dish labelled vegan on the menu should be served as such or be clarified with the customer. - A smaller portion than Ramen Isshin. Also not a fan of the raw tofu cubes, would prefer cooked. - Some of the staff in the open kitchen were continuously yelling loudly when orders were up. It's a smallish place so it definitely effected the ambiance.  All in all though a good and easy experience. I'll likely be back coz it is decent and in a convenient location."}
{"text":"The only thing that prevents this place from getting five stars is that they only serve beer and wine.  Great food......"}
{"text":"My friends and I came for a late dinner around 9:30. It was packed, so we were told the wait was about 30 minutes. We ended up waiting about an hour and was wondering why people coming after us we're getting seated before us. We asked the hostess and she had rewrote my name as a completely different name on another paper, so that was why we waited so long. I was a little upset that she didn't apologize but she did get us seats quickly. After we sat down we waited another 10 minutes or so with no one coming to take a drink order or anything. Again, a little disappointing because we were all so thirsty from waiting outside. By the time we got in a ordered it had kind of slowed down already but our sides kept getting forgotten or something was missing so we had to keep calling for the server. I have been here a couple times feeling satisfied, but this experience was a bit disappointing all together. The restaurant was extremely cold (to the point that I was shivering), the ramen was luke-warm, and the service was not as good as before."}
{"text":"Service was unusually awesome. When I go places , my server usually ignores me. But this cute little gay dude was very pleasant. The place has an awesome modern Japanese interior, though the music was a touch too loud. Food was interesting and delicious, but not too pricey. Shall return."}
{"text":"Quick service. Friendly employees. Awesome women's restrooms. Tasty & interesting twist on the Japanese cuisines. Definitely would come back and recommend others to eat here."}
{"text":"Luke warm broth is a no no. I rarely come here only if friends have decided on meeting here, otherwise I wouldn't go or recommend. Simply because of the not hot broth and I have nothing on the menu drawing my attention.   However, the brussel sprout tempura is fairly good and the takoyaki. But, I'm not coming for appetizers haha."}
{"text":"I had the cha cha cha, the portion was quite large. It had 4 pieces of pork belly on top which were unfortunately 50% fat. The noodles had a good texture. The broth was odd as it was oily.  Could only finish half because there was about a 1mm thick layer of oil that was very visible.  Turned me off.  Also had the tako yaki. Interesting presentation. I suspect that everywhere you go in town that serves tako yaki is from the same supplier.   The sound system has way too much bass. I was there around 2pm on a rainy day. Didn't need to be subwoofed out of my cozy state. I bet this place and their sound system is a lot louder at night."}
{"text":"Think this is my new favorite ramen spot! They had me at fresh garlic with a table garlic press. I love their spicy garlic ramen.  The gyoza is really good too!"}
{"text":"Our go to for ramen or for late nights. The Jinya bun is a MUST, so delicious. The meat is tender and well seasoned, the bun soft and fluffy. Now the ramen... Sprouting Up Ramen is my favorite. Everything about it is AMAZING. I don't like Brussels sprouts but the ones in this ramen are delish. I love everything about this dish. I like to add some spiciness to it but other than that it's PERFECT!"}
{"text":"Hey! I've been here many times. Truthfully, I always enjoyed Monta more than Jinya. Though, arguably their menus are very different from each other. But now that I'm trying to eat mostly vegan, I loooove Jinya! Before you stop reading because you're not vegan, their Spicy Creamy Vegan Ramen is out of this world! I honestly like it more than the several non-vegan ramen soups I've tried here which includes chicken, pork and vegetarian based broths. My least favorite has been the vegetarian ramen, it's really heavy on the vegetables which actually takes away from the ramen. But truly, do yourself a favor and try the vegan ramen.. It's so tasty!  Also, the quinoa salad is super delicious! I got it without tomatoes (personal preference) and we ate it right up. I really recommend this, it's so good!  My boyfriend ordered the spicy chicken ramen with a poached egg, a regular for him. He was very happy with his meal. But the star here is the vegan ramen! I can't get over how good it is! Give it a try, even if you're a meat eater :)"}
{"text":"Absolutely love it here! One of the best ramen places in Vegas, hands down.   Everyone in this restaurant is so friendly! Greeted very promptly and our waitress was very attentive.   FOOD CAME OUT QUICK! Was pleasantly surprised. I highly recommend the Jinya Bun! Delicious.   All in all, I will definitely be returning. Friendly, quick service and great food!"}
{"text":"All was excellent.  Ramen made hubby and my father in law very, very happy.  They had a really nice almond pudding with fresh fruit dessert that was so refreshing -- the called it something like Annin tofu but no tofu involved.    The kiddo meal was huge and had a lot of variety - one of the best I have seen.... chicken ramen, a little chicken and rice and chicken pieces with fries.   And a touch of sushi - cali rolls and tuna for the non ramen eater.    Pleased."}
{"text":"This is my second favorite ramen spot in Vegas. I've never had a bad experience here but I feel that they rely too heavily on garlic. This is great news for those that love garlic with their ramen and other dishes. Their appetizers are fun, creative, and delicious. Did I mention they have beer?"}
{"text":"Visited Jinya on our trip to Vegas the food was so delicious that we ate here twice during our two day stay in Las Vegas.   The Ramen here was delicious! Highly recommend the Tonkotsu Assari.   The Restaurant is clean and welcoming. The staff is very friendly and extremely attentive.   Good appetizers to try, Tempura Brussel Sprouts & gyoza  Will be back again!"}
{"text":"We stopped in here to check out this unique location and discovered that it's not just ramen. They pair ramen noodles with beef, chicken, or vegetarian and one can even order it with rice either. The staff is very helpful with pointing out things on the menu that customers are unclear of. I do wish that the restaurant location was larger but other than that check it out one will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I've been trying to go to Jinya for a couple of years, but it is always packed! I finally made it in to Jinya a couple of weeks ago and had a really great experience.  I don't always like to rate a place unless I've gone on multiple occasions, but I do sometimes when I feel like I tried enough of the food.  Jinya is within the China Town area of Las Vegas right off the strip on Tropicana. The plaza it's in isn't the best looking one in Vegas, and neither is the outside of the establishment. The restaurant itself is modern inside and very clean. The one gripe I have with the decor is the huge community table in the middle of the space.  Jinya is a Japanese restaurant that specializes in ramen. With this huge surge in ramen joints the last few years I see Jinya standing the test of time. They have a great menu with many different ramen with varying flavor profiles and spice levels. They also have a bunch of tasty appetizers.   I'm a classic ramen type of person: I like a savory broth with tons of flavor & some corn for some sweetness.   I suggest taking your time reading the menu and figuring out what sounds best to you. A unique choice I enjoyed was their sukiyaki ramen with poached egg. An appetizer I'd recommend is their takoyaki. It's become such a popular dish, but theirs is served with egg salad underneath-such a good flavor combination.   Jinya only had a handful of people working their floor, but they're incredibly attentive and nice. I love how they have some starter dishes for around $5/$6 bucks. I thought Jinya was just hype, but I really enjoyed myself and their food."}
{"text":"If you find yourself in Vegas and love ramen, this is the place to go to. After the hangover the ramen here is a godsend. They also got sushi, and not just pork ramen. They have chicken as well which is what I prefer. You can make your ramen from mild to spicy. You also have your choice of veggies to put in your ramen like broccoli, bean sprouts, spinach etc. The flavor is amazing and the serving is generous. The chicken is all white meat, juicy and tender. It's a little off the strip but just about 5-10 min depending on traffic. Completely worth it. Also I recommend to get here early or you might have to wait a while, it can get packed."}
{"text":"Lots of pluses for JINYA.  1. It's from LA, so that makes it feel cool. 2. The interior is decorated pretty hip with a big communal table in the middle. 3. When they saw that I had kids with me, they set up our table with kids bowls, spoons, and forks. How cool is that??? 4. The ramen has a really great taste. I think the broth is stronger/creamier than other places, and it comes with more accoutrements inside.   The price is a little higher (I think I paid $10.50 for my bowl), but that's mostly because it came with some kind of toasted garlic, a whole hardboiled egg, seaweed, pork, and a couple other veggies. Overall, I think the price is probably comparable for what you get.  All ramen places: can you please provide fountain drinks???? I don't really like paying $2 for a can of diet Coke!"}
{"text":"Came in around 7:30pm on a Thursday night and waited in line for about 45min.   The seating inside doesn't accommodate a lot of people and is pretty dim.  The food is pretty tasty. I got the jinya black and my partner got the vegetarian ramen. She really enjoyed it! It's also a rarity to find a ramen place with multiple options for vegans and vegetarians because usually the broth is meat based.  I would come again and try another ramen just wish the wait wasn't so long."}
{"text":"We've been to Japan 4 times and this place is legit. They even had the heated toilet seats from Japan. Got the sprouting up and spicy tonkotsu ramens both really great flavor with perfectly cooked noodles. Not over cooked like alot of places. Brussel sprouts are not a traditional ramen topping but they are now one of my new favorites. Also got the spicy tuna tacos and Jinya buns. Tacos we're great with a perfect crunch and I loved the sides of cilantro and lime. The Jinya Bun was the only disappointment, not nearly as good as ippudo pork buns. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I had the pork belly bao and the Black Tonkotsu Ramen. It totally hit the spot for the hangover I had. I can't wait to try some of the other ramens on my next Vegas trip."}
{"text":"Oooh fancy fancy! I'm not going to pretend I didn't eat a ton of the .25 cent packages of Top Ramen back in the day.. but now that I am older, I am all about this fancy ramen and JINYA is my favorite place to slurp up some curly noodles.  My first visit to JINYA was with some of my favorite Yelpers, Jessica M. and Dyanna L., both who had made multiple visits to JINYA and were able to guide me through ordering. I have since returned with my husband and every experience has been excellent. Never too long a wait to be seated, friendly and efficient service and the ambiance is quite nice as well.  The chicken ramen is my go-to order, the broth is so flavorful. I always get some additions to customize my order: I love adding butter, mushrooms, corn and LOTS of freshly pressed garlic.  JINYA has more than ramen, the tempura brussel sprouts are a must get, they are amazing.   For your late night, party animal types: JINYA is open until 3 am, and has Happy Hour from 3-5pm AND 10pm-12am!   Pro tip: Do not leave without checking out the restroom."}
{"text":"No Ramen, No Life!      I really can't believe that it took me this long to review JINYA. The girlfriend and I hit this place up on the very first day they opened their doors. JINYA was empty and service was fantastic that day. Service is still great, but dang, the lines are out the door.  We tried almost every side item and of course, the ramen.  There's so many options here that it's very easy to be undecided on what to get.  My favorite was their Tonkotsu Black Ramen w/2 extra eggs and extra seaweed. I love the noodles and the creamy broth.  What makes JINYA so good is their consistency.  The taste, textures, and portions are always on point.  But if you ask what I enjoy the most here, it's their Chicken Chashu Bowl.  I will get this with an extra side of chicken and some extra eggs.  This is a \"must try\" if you're here and want something other than ramen.  It's so good.  I will usually get the small with very little rice and pack on the extra proteins. That's how it's done, folks.  No Ramen, No Life!  That's their motto. My JINYA motto...\"No Chicken, No Life\".     TIP #1:  Long waits because everyone loves JINYA  TIP #2:  Happy Hour Menu is from 3:00 PM to 5:00 PM (super deals on side items)  TIP #3:  Please caption your photos.  Even my fork pictures have captions. I hate showing our server a picture on Yelp and telling them \"I want this. I don't know what it is, but I want this\".  Please Yeeps!! Captions!!!!     2017 Yelp Review #33"}
{"text":"omg the spicy vegan ramen! AND NOODLE REFILLS! (you can't see the fist pump, but there is definitely a fist pump happening right now!)  just go to here. but be prepared to wait at peak food times, it's a busy place."}
{"text":"their ramen is very good,I was there very late around 9,no lineup. I ordered cha-cha-cha ramen was amazing,it was a best ramen I ever had,my friend got spicy chicken ramen,it was amazing too.their ramen soup was very creamy,looks like milk,yami yami!!"}
{"text":"I visited this place for the first time for lunch. The service was very prompt and the staff was very attentive. Friendly smiles and greetings.   They have various options for ramen.  We ordered the cilantro lime ramen and chicken wings appetizer.   The food was tasty and full of flavor.  The wings were well seasoned and fried hard.   However,  they were still juicy and not dried. That also have vegetarian options as well.   My date is not big on ramen, but he did try my food and he agreed it was good. It is something he would order and eat in the future visits.  The soup base was very good,  which I feel determines the major of the flavor with ramen as other noodles such as Pho.  It's located in a freestanding building on the parking lot of shopping center,  so there's lots of free parking.   This place is a good value for the quality of food. If you like soups or are short on time,  you can be in and out real quick. It was reasonably priced.  We spent $25 for two for lunch.  I recommend trying this place out if you are on the area."}
{"text":"If a restaurant can make me want to order Brussels sprouts on purpose, that is quite an accomplishment. I will order them every time I visit Jinya, and I plan to be a regular. The waiter welcomed me back although I'd never been there, and that seemed like a good beginning to the meal. Three of us ordered different ramens, and we all raved about them. My tan tan men was so, so flavorful. And ladies do NOT miss the toilet experience!"}
{"text":"I wish I lived in Calgary because this would be my go-to ramen bar. The food is delicious. I tried the tempura Brussels sprouts and they were amazing. The gyoza were soft and lightly pan fried.   I had the chicken wonton ramen with mushroom topping. So yum!!  Highly recommended, but be warned. A gratuity is added for groups over 6"}
{"text":"Mediocre hence the three stars  Ordered the Cha Cha Cha Ramen and the Jinya Bun  Cha Cha Cha Ramen Decent portion in terms of toppings, noodles and chashu Soup is very hearty and meaty due to the combination of pork and fish stock used.  I appreciate the bits of pork fat populating the soup.  Noodles were done right.  Chashu needs work though, although soft, it feels dry.  The chashu is also a bit too acidic for my tasting.  Soup needs to be a bit hotter as well.  Thus, not bad but not that good.  Jinya Bun Same as the ramen.  Toppings are quite generous, pork is lacking once again.  Service is ok, menu is a bit overwhelming in terms of ramen selection compared to other ramen shops, I dont really know what is the specialty, there's at least 3 types of brother but no choices of tare.  Jinya places in the middle of the pack in terms of downtown ramen"}
{"text":"I've heard good reviews about Jinya from a couple of friends, so I was eager to give this restaurant a try when I was in the area.   Environment: The restaurant is located near the College/Church intersection, which is very much TTC accessible. If you're driving there is also a private parking just right across the street. Upon walking into the restaurant, the ambiance emitted more of a bar/izakaya vibe, as supposed to the other ramen restaurants that I frequent. There was a coat rack right by the entrance to hang your winter jacket. Going along with the bar vibe, there were many TVs around the perimeter of the restaurant with sports on.  The dining space was good sized, but many of their tables were only good for up to 4 people, and larger groups would have to use the high tables in the middle. There were also couple ledge seats available by the window and by the open kitchen for solo diners.   Food: My friends highly recommended their Takoyaki so for sure I was going to try it. It was $6.95 for 6 pieces, so the price was reasonable. However, I find their Ramen bowls to be on the more expensive side, as the prices ranged between $12 to $15.  We received the Takoyaki first as it was our appetizer, and I really like how it tasted with the Japanese mayo sauce at the bottom, that I kept it for flavouring when our ramen arrived. The texture of the Takoyaki was really tender and fluffy and it tasted great when it was hot.  We waited for quite a long time for our Ramen to arrive, which was quite a bummer as ramen is supposed to be a type of \"fast food\" in Japan. When it finally arrived I was slightly disappointed by the portion size and the toppings, considering that I was expecting more due to the higher prices. The soup turned out to be too salty to the point that I wished I had told them to give me -50% salt when I placed my order. The Chashu pork was really tender, but it didn't really standout for me, similar to the rest of the toppings.   Service: To be honest, when I realized the restaurant was going for the izakaya vibe I was expecting loud chants from the staffers, but thank god it wasn't the case during my experience. I was at Kinka recently where they did that constantly, and it felt like the noise was going to burst my eardrums at any moment. In terms of service, you don't really get an assigned server to your table, so you're free to get a hold of any server walking by to place your order. They came over periodically to clear the dishes and to refill our water as well.   Overall, I think the restaurant is a 3.5 star for me, but for the sake of the review I'm giving it a 3 star, because the ramen was so average and the portion wasn't very big, so I can't justify paying a premium price for it."}
{"text":"They probably have good food but the hostess wouldn't sit us and we were waiting for over an hour. She sat a whole bunch of people who came after us which is fine.. Apparently coming in with three people is a bad number and means you have to wait longer then most groups..."}
{"text":"This place is a cute little ramen shop off the strip. The hot soup definitely hit the spot, especially for my bf who was still recovering from a hangover (and yes we came here for dinner). Lol. The actual building is a bit weird, looks like it used to be a small drive-thru place, but they obviously no longer utilize that drive-thru window and the entrance is on the side of the store facing the strip.  There was no wait for a party of 3, we opted to sit at the large communal table in the middle. The restaurant is fairly dim and quiet inside. I ordered the Jinya Tonkotsu Black, without kikurage (mushrooms) plus corn and extra seaweed (came with 3-4 pieces). The bowl was of decent size, even a little on the larger side which was a nice plus. The ramen noodles were good and the chashu meat was delicious and very tender. My meal also came with a good amount of corn. Yay. The egg was a bit more undercooked than I'm used to - even the white portion was gooey, but it's okay I just left it on the side. Our waitress, Roselle was very attentive and sweet. She even commented on the uneaten egg when she was clearing our table, but I explained I'm accustomed to the soft boiled eggs that come with ramen, I just didn't realize that theirs was so undercooked here. No harm, no foul though.   Great location off the strip for a yummy bowl of ramen, would like to return on our next Vegas trip."}
{"text":"Adam is a great worker. Every time we come in, he makes us feel welcomed by remembering us and introducing us to new things on the menu.  The reason I am giving two stars is because someone I think her name is Ashley, is extremely rude and ignores our table. When we asked her for more water, she said okay and never came back and stood where the food comes out. She never asks if everything is doing okay, and just walks around like she hates her job. I have been here on multiple occasions where she acts like this. Every time I come here I hope she is not our server.  The food tastes great though, one thing I appreciate about jinya is how creamy the broth is as compared to other ramen places."}
{"text":"Perfect date night atmosphere! The lighting is dim and when you enter they yell jinya! I think it's a greeting in Japanese! Very cute ! On to the food! We ordered jinya 2 spicy chicken ramen, tonkotsu assari spicy, spicy creamy shrimp tempura and Sapporo beer and a lycheetini! The chicken was very basic, probably could have made it at home not to special. The tonkotsu assari however was amazing it has thin slices of pork which seemed like they had been marinated forever, and a seasoned egg which tasted marinated as well, best egg I have ever had in my life! This soup had thick noodles which I wish I would have ordered the thin ones because it was so filling. The shrimp tempura was also very delicious it was 6.80 for 4 pieces on a bed of lettuce (lettuce seemed pointless though haha) very wet sauce and amazing spicyness. Also the beer tasted like any bud light nothing special and the lycheetini was VERY sweet I wouldn't order it again because it didn't go very well with the food I ordered, but I would have it again with a desert maybe- it has Japanese vodka, vodka and fruit."}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME. me and my friends came for lunch, it was SOOO good. We ordered two orders of shrimp balls. The ball sauce was so good we even got extra. After our ramen we had to use the restroom. The ladies room is awesome. They have this really fancy toilet that has a seat warmer. My friend saw that their were other functions on this toilet, upon checking it out we discovered we could get a free colonic!!! HOW AWESOME IS THAT? Thank you Jinya for the awesome food as well as cleaning my friend out. We really appreciate it!!!"}
{"text":"The place isn't huge. We had a few minutes wait on a Wednesday night. It seemed that the staff was out of it. We could see a table in front of us, but they weren't sure if they had a 4 top.   The server came around pretty quickly once we were seated. Our server, though, was not particularly helpful. When I asked her what were the best dishes (her recommendation) she just pointed to the the three biggest pictures on the menu without much explanation.   I ordered the Jinya No3 with extra ground pork and fresh garlic. The Jinya No3 was great as the broth was not too thick like some ramens are. The fresh garlic was a nice touch. It just comes out in bulbs and they hand you the press and you can press it in yourself, which was nice. I don't think the ground pork added much to the ramen, however. For some reason, it didn't have a fresh taste. Maybe a little old.  Friends of ours had ordered spicy ramen with extra noodles. Their dish came out and it didn't look spicy at all (just plain yellow broth). When they asked the server if it was spicy, she wasn't sure herself. She didn't check either. She just assumed it was. She also had to be reminded to bring extra noodles.   Overall, it was good Ramen. Personally, I'm a bigger fan of Pho than Ramen. Just be sure that you are on top of your order."}
{"text":"The restaurant is pretty small with limited seating. We went in a group of six and sat at the large center table. We started off with the Jinya Bun which was really good. We ordered the Tonkotsu Black and Spicy Chicken Ramen. The ramen soup wasn't really to my liking so while the food was enjoyable, I probably don't see myself coming here again."}
{"text":"I love ramen, so I'm always excited to try new ramen places. The ambience of the restaurant is nice and because it is a new restaurant, it is still very clean. The ramen was a little over priced. The broth didn't have much flavor to it but the portions were large. My cousin ordered gyoza, but it wasn't anything out of the ordinary. Excellent customer service."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times for lunch and other than one appetizer that they failed to bring out I have never had an issue with the service.  You should know that it is a little small and can get very busy.  Not sure if they take reservations.  I go for lunch.  The Tonkotsu Spicy is fantastic.  I like to add some veggies to it.    Not sure why but the middle booth seems to be just the slightest bit sticky.  Like they may have had some adhesive and a pad there at one point bu removed it."}
{"text":"My go-to for to-go!  Especially if there's a wait, and there usually is.  It's also really good to eat onsite... even though the seats aren't that comfortable.   My favorite ramen is the Jinya White, which is a mix of their Pork and Chicken broth. With the two flavors, it's not too porky and the chicken adds a clearness which gives a cleaner style broth.   Thick noodle is better than thin, in my opinion.   Order Spicy and get the Hot level; it's good.   They make a good egg, so I usually add an extra.   Pork chashu is not the best I've had but it's still good.   If you're onsite, ask for fresh garlic. It adds a special kick, but it is something you and your party should partake in, or the odd one out will be the vampire target. Or get punished by garlic essence.   I also really like the combination meal where you can order a side dish. My favorites are their housemade gyoza or chicken chashu bowl. If I'm not that hungry, I ask the server to pack up the bowl so I can have for lunch the next day.   I did not like the Brussel Sprouts - it's not light tempura style at all and had too much batter.   Pork Bun - It's a good version and I would order again.   All in all, my new favorite ramen spot in town. Lots of versions and variety for all to enjoy."}
{"text":"First, the service was great! I'm all about service. Our waiter was nice and always made sure our drinks were filled. The only concern I had was that the restaurant was sooooo hot!! I think their AC was broken because they were using a fan. We live in Vegas too so it was like 108 outside and inside was even hotter.  Overall the soup was pretty good. It's almost as good as Monta Ramen.  We had the spicy chicken soup and the Tonkotsu Black.  The spicy chicken soup eh not a fan. The flavor was kinda off for me. The chicken was not tender and the spinach wasn't a great mix. I did enjoy the Tonkotsu Black. The flavor was really good.  For appetizers, we ordered gyoza and shrimp balls. The gyoza was okay, it was not as crunchy on the sides but the shrimp balls were on point!  This is an awesome lil hidden spot. The ambience has a great feel to it too. The only thing I'd change about the ambience is that huge table in the middle. I would add more smaller tables. A lot of people tend to be not open to sharing with another huge family. Most people just want to cut the small talk and just enjoy the food."}
{"text":"After such a bad dining experience this morning at Paris (Le Village Buffet), we were seeking something more soothing on the stomach... Ramen!  Everything here was on point -- good service, nice decor, flavorful, fresh ingredients.  I had the Katsu Ramen and the noodles were great, al dente even.  Great broth, char sui, boiled egg, bok choy and a few other toppings.  Fried chicken app and gyoza were great too.  Mochi ice cream and almond jello?  Yum.  Give these a guys a try when you're in the mood for a little soup and noodles!"}
{"text":"Yes. all  that is cracked up to be. I am Loyal Ramen Sora (mmmm). However the service (Brittany) is top shelf. This place is open: kitchen staff and environment.  Take your time order a pitcher of beer, appetizer enjoy the awesome music. When ordering Ramen ask your server what fits you best (Spicy, Meats, Egg) You cant go wrong. I really enjoyed this place, Brittany and staff made me love this place."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is nice, only complaint is music is pretty loud for some reason.  Gyoza was delicious! Came out quickly.  The ramen on the other hand took a while, so I recommend you have patience if you come. Not sure why its taking so long.  How was it?  Yummy...  I had the chicken and pork broth..    Toilet seat experience.... don't be scared :P just push the buttons."}
{"text":"Jinya was due for a revisit. Still lacking lunch in the late afternoon, I chose to try their happy hour (3-5pm).  Upon arrival, I was promptly seated at the bar area and informed of happy hour (helpful for those who stumble in without prior awareness). I didn't need alcohol or veggies, so that eliminated most of the options. Having neglected to compare costs thoroughly beforehand, I ordered a Jinya bun ($3.00 HH, $3.80 regular) instead of the crispy chicken (5 pc, $3.00 vs. $5.80, a great deal). Luckily, the bun was very nice, with dough that wasn't too dry and tender pork that wasn't too sweet or anything of the sort. It's comparable to other pork burns that I've had.  For my main course, I chose the tonkotsu black ($10.80) this time instead of the tonkotsu assari. This one has thin noodles by default, and they seemed to be done properly this time. There are two fairly thin pieces of chashu (one with a dab of chili paste, which was odd since it's not in the photo or ingredient list), one more piece than the assari. The egg seemed fairly typical - not fully hard-boiled but not runny. A little black garlic oil, green onions, fried onions, kikurage, and two pieces of nori rounded out the bowl.  Like last time, I was confused by the broth. It did taste better than the assari broth, but it still seemed to be lacking. Halfway through, I tried adding a bit of the liquid from the bottle labeled \"ramen seasoning.\" The mixture of soy sauce, garlic, and other components does really round out the broth's flavor. It's almost mind-boggling that Jinya has this gimmick of basically forcing the customer to add liquid seasoning to get comparable flavors, a conceit that no other ramen restaurant that I've been to in any city has done.  At this price point for ramen, I still favor the deluxe miso at Ramen Sora at least 9 times out of 10. I think I would also prefer the kogashi ramen at Fukumimi if price and drive are eliminated as factors. However, I will say that the dessert (an option missing from other places) was a pleasant upsell at meal's end. The An-Nin Tofu ($2 HH, $3.50 normally) felt like a steal, with soft almond pudding, a little whipped cream and strawberry sauce, and fresh diced mango, kiwi and strawberries.  I still like Jinya in spite of my broth quibbles, but if it's not happy hour or late night, you'll probably only find me here again if I've overenjoyed my other local favorite ramen spots. And no, Monta is not one of them."}
{"text":"Had their quinoa salad which was very good, the spicy vegan ramen is good too but not spicy at all. I didn't like the fried chicken though. Servers were attentive"}
{"text":"Their ramen is so good! One of the better ones I've had in Vegas and LA! The broth is very tasty. Their jinua black ramen and the tokyo tonkotsu are my faves.  Prepare to wait in line though. Wait-time for my group was an hour, good thing the food was worth it."}
{"text":"Food was amazing but service has the be the worst! Seems like everyone does everything no one has an exact position ! No hostess, no bussers kinda of a free for all. Stopped coming here due to a Server who wore glasses darker skin completion. By far the worst walked past us 7 times ( barley anyone inside to eat) finally came over took our order but she forgot to write it down because she  higher then a kite! Came back asked us again after ten minutes finally got our order right then gave us our meal! After we asked for he bill she never came back for 20 mins ( once again not busy just bull Sh*tting in the back because we could hear her laughing and what not) and we asked another server and she was quick to give us our stuff! I will never come back if our first server is working!"}
{"text":"Great place, fantastic service!! Green bean app and chk ramen are genome all! Great place!!  Thank you so much"}
{"text":"'Tis the season. Winters in Vegas get cold! But nothing a warm bowl of rich flavorful ramen can't remedy.  Came here late - probably past midnight on a very cold Saturday - and Jinya was bustling. Thankfully, the wait wasn't more than 10 minutes. Service was quick and to the point - no chitchatting and no BS. The food came quickly and did not disappoint.  Pork buns were solid. Nice piece of fatty but not too fatty, tender pork belly balanced with crisp cucumbers and a tad of lettuce, sandwiched in a fluffy soft bun and topped with just the right the right amount of japanese mayo. The pork belly itself probably could've marinated in whatever magical sauce they use for a little longer.   Now the ramen - we went for a classic tonkosu assari (with pork chashu, kikurage, green onions, soft boiled egg and bean sprouts) and a tonkotsu black (main difference being the addition of nori dried seaweed, garlic chips, fried onion and the use of thinner noodles). The broth in both were rich, alllllmost bordering on being a tad too rich to the point where I couldn't finish all of the broth (a sin in my book). The noodles were perfectly cooked. I'm not quite sure why they use two different types of noodles - a thick and a thin version. I personally prefer the thicker version, but the tonkotsu black only comes with the thin noodles. Eggs were properly soft-boiled (it drives me nuts when ramen joints don't do the egg right!). I'll definitely be coming back again, looking forward to trying some of the other ramen options - perhaps some of the other broths are not quite as rich."}
{"text":"- What I have tried:     + Chef's special ramen $12.50 (3/5): it came with shredded mushrooms, half an eggs, cilantro, 2 slices of  lime, and couple pieces of pork. The soup was ok, tasted more like pho soup but richer flavour (soup will taste better if you put ramen season provided on the table). This ramen bowl did not come with ramen noodles but some sort of chow mein noodles, which made it so ordinary. I felt like I was eating vietnamese/chinese home-made noodles. Nothing special about this bowl at all.    + Takoyaki $6.8 (4/5): It came in 6 octopus balls.They gave lots of octopus chunks and bonito flakes and a lot of egg tartar in the bottom. I thought this dish was better than chef's ramen, very flavourful and well worth it.   - Portion: large, I can be full with just one bowl of ramen - Price: Average like other ramen places, but pricey to me as I have to spend $13 on a bowl of ramen that tasted like some chinese noodles soup. - The place has lots of tables but they are not closed to each other, very well designed  - Very good service and active waitresses **** They did not update their menu online, the menu in store is about $1 for each/most dish(es) as compared to the one online."}
{"text":"This was my 2nd time at the restaurant. We waited 10 mins to be seated as they seemed busy. We then were sat at our table. The waiter came by and took our order.  It was simple 2 ramen bowls. He dropped our water and then left to place our order. After about 10 mins he came back and stated that our order will take 15 more mins to be made.   So we understood and sat patiently waiting for our food. The time was around 8pm. 15 mins went past and no food. So I still waited. At around 8:30pm I had to get the servers attention. As he never came back to apologize nor say that it will take a little longer. I caught his attention and told him about our wait. He apologized and came back saying it is coming in another 10 mins.   we finally got out food at 8:45pm. Not a big fan of complaining but it was such a bad service on the servers end that ruined the whole night. The food was great as expected. We were given a bowl of edamame for the inconvenience. But I didn't want edamame, I just wanted what I ordered and good service.   Hope they fix the issue and have better communication with their guests.   2 star for bad service."}
{"text":"Gormet Ramen....who knew?  This Ramen tasted better than I ever oculd have imagined.  My prior expeirance was with those bricks you get at the grocery store for a quarter each.  This was freshly prepared, highly customizable, and spiced to my liking.  I will return!"}
{"text":"Food is great! To be honest I first thought it had a fast food concept and was a little sketchy but it's not at all. Not sure what I ordered, all I know is that it was one of there specials and it had pork in it. Great new place. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Excellent. The gyoza was delicious as well as the ramen with pork belly that my husband ordered. They deserve 5 stars, but gave 4 due to the fact that the wait was really long and they don't take reservations."}
{"text":"Well, well, well  A new contender in the ramen food scene of Las Vegas.  I remember coming back from Japan and there were none in Las Vegas that could even rate a zero on the rating to japan.  I used to be one of the firsts requesting Ramen in Vegas I think I might have been the first to review a new ramen in Vegas.  I was one of the firsts asking for authentic Ramen, over the years it has turned into a Vegas experience.   Ramen in this town has grown from going to a side bar that has the reputation of a good ramen to some of the best ramen on the west coast.  I no longer have to drive to LA to have Ramen.  Jinya again exceeds expectations of a ramen restaurant.  This place kind of resets the bar of Ramen in this town.  There are others who have held the bar for so long but have become lax.  Still good but not as good as this, sad to say but I feel fame will make you relax too much.    We put our name in and waited about 30 minutes.  Not bad for good Ramen in Vegas.  we were asked if a small table was ok (of course) sat and were explained the menu.    I recommend getting the Thick noodles, I was fine with normal noodles but my man really likes the thicker noodles.  The normal noodles are quite thin.  We got the Jinya Tonkostso Black, we added Nori, Corn, fresh garlic and seasoned egg.  I really wanted some apps but it was only us 2.  We got our food and feasted, I have never had a egg this good.  I have made this claim before but every time I make this claim it has never been this good. I relished this egg...  I would go back for the Tonkostso Black any day.  This Ramen is the best at this point, Monta Ramen and Ramen Sora look out you have a new player in town!  I think Jinya might take over in my opinion!   I will go back and i will ask for more, I might ask for extra.  I will for sure get more of the Jinya Tonkostso Black.  I can t wait to try some sides.  Yummy!!!"}
{"text":"The ramen was good, the place was crowded and always loud though. I still like Sora. The soup is better."}
{"text":"3rd visit. Most likely the last. There are too many other great ramen places where the service may be quick paced and slightly impersonal - but you actually do get service, and you get what you ask for.   Jinya - The speed in which the food arrives has much improved since previous visits. The demeanor of our server - as if he \"couldn't be bothered\" - was pretty frustrating. Twice, he held his finger up at me from a distance as if to say \"just a second\" while he dance and laughed with others servers 2 feet from our table. It wasn't as though he was busy with guests. So that's just annoying and uncool. You are a server, please provide service or move on. Honestly. It's not rocket science.   Asking for items to come as a first course made no difference - as everything showed up either all together or appetizers after the ramen bowls hit the table. Again, not the biggest deal - but communicate to your table if that's the case. It becomes a situation where the lack of proper service has you noticing everything that is not right. We ordered a pitcher of beer and saké and the server never came back to check on us when they were done - make sales dude!   It's hard to review the food with such  bad taste in   your mouth due to lack of service. Next.   Happy Eating!"}
{"text":"Jinya is a particularly small restaurant. Delicious food & the martinis are even better. I would recommend this restaurant if you are on a date or with a very small group. Otherwise, the wait time will be extensive with very little elbow room. Prepare to get close & personal if you are seated in the large center table as you will be brushing elbows with strangers. Other than that, the service is fast. They bring out the food as it is cooked, so you may be eating before your party (apparently I am perfectly fine with this)! The food is reasonably priced & I recommend the LYCHEE martini. A new favorite!"}
{"text":"Great place the gyoza are great in my opinion is better than Monta ramen  The pork belly bun is great  And the ramen are good  Went couples time and it was always great  Open late"}
{"text":"You said you close at 3am and we came in before 2:15am. What do you mean you don't guarantee that we can seat before 2:30am because there are one table ahead of us and cannot serve us? Very bad business practice and you should just put your business hour to 2am instead of 3?"}
{"text":"Ramen joints seem to be a dime a dozen in Vegas. Located outside of Chinatown but on the West side - the place looks like it may have been a fast food joint at one time. Parking was no issue since I arrived before the noon hour. Inside the décor was chic and hip looking with a large island bar located in the middle and surrounded by tables along the walls.  I ordered the Tonkotsu ramen black which contained a large seasoned egg, pork chashu, seaweed and green onion. The broth was tasty and flavorful. Service was solid. I had room for the green tea mochi which is large enough for two but ate the whole dessert. A great way to end lunch.  Overall for being a franchise chain I was impressed with the décor, food and staff here and would return in the future."}
{"text":"Oh my god their ramen is heavenly? I have to say this is probably the best ramen I had outside of Tokyo!!! Their thick noodle is sooooo good!! Makes me wanna go back to Vegas just for their ramen!!"}
{"text":"This China town ramen bar is worth visiting if you are craving ramen. The ambiance is trendy/casual and everything is reasonably priced. There is a lot of variety on offer as well as spice ranges. Try to get out of your comfort zone and you might find an unusual dish that surprises you with flavor.  Decent happy hour options as well make this a great recommendation for value diners."}
{"text":"I think I've found a new favorite ramen spot.  Walking into the restaurant, you're greeted with dim lighting and a romantic atmosphere. The interior design recalls Japanese influences with an modern and industrial feel. In the center of the restaurant is a huge wooden sharing table with cool light fixtures hanging above them. Smaller tables line the walls and windows.  Our server was informative of the menu pointing out that the pictures on the menu were their popular items.   I got the tonkatsu and my roomie had the spicy chicken ramen. Now, a lot of people claim that this place is better than Monta. I won't agree to that but I will say that quality and taste of the ramen is good in it's own way and is on the same level as Monta. That's just my honest opinion. The broth is a little lighter but still full of amazing flavors.  I definitely recommend this place to everyone who is a ramen lover or just curious to try a new restaurant. I'll be back to try more of their ramen options."}
{"text":"Have been this place a couple of times in the last week. Depending on the time of day there might be a bit of a wait to set down. My favorite so far is the spicy chicken ramen. I also am a fan of the Shrimp balls. The only thing I haven't been a fan of was getting my app after I had mostly finished my ramen. No worries thought everything here is really good. I mean i have been there twice in 5 days."}
{"text":"Went late night around midnight and waited about 20 mins. Was really excited to get my ramen fix here after seeing their high reviews and advertisements on billboards. Let's just say I left super disappointed in the quality of food and service. You're better off at Manta. And no, this place does not at all compare to Ramen in LA.  Ordered the black garlic oil ramen combo with the curry bowl/ salad. For my ramen, I added corn and asked for spicy.  When they brought out my curry bowl, they forgot my salad. When I asked for it, they questioned if I even ordered the combo. Then came my ramen, and yet again They forgot something-  the spicy sauce. As I started eating, I fished around my bowl and noticed they ALSO FORGOT MY CHASHU. Told the server, and he said he was goin to bring me it. I waited 15 mins and my ramen got cold. Got the servers attention again and guess what- he forgot about getting my chashu pork.   So after all this, I was pretty over it. My meal was incomplete and cold. Staff are incompetent and can't seem to get an order right. They did offer to reheat my ramen-  but it really didn't live up to the hype. Don't waste your time and stomach here."}
{"text":"I have tried this place many times, and I really like it. They have good ramen and a good variety to choose from. Not bad at all."}
{"text":"We had a delicious meal that made me want to return. The waiter made great suggestions that satisfied everyone. If you like traditional style Ramen you'll love this food."}
{"text":"I am pretty salty just like Jinya's ramen. I visited this place twice for lunch and can safely recommend that this place is not worth visiting. Don't be fooled by the nice bowls and interior.  My last visit was on Trump's inauguration day (ew I know), and the customer service was terrible. My coworkers and I waited 30 to 40 minutes for our ramen which is awful especially when you only have like 1 hour for lunch. This wait time has been consistent for both my visits.  When my Tokyo Tonkotsu Ramen finally arrived, the noodles were so soggy and tasted awful. When you are charged $13 bucks after tax for ramen which is pricier than most ramen places nearby and it tastes worst than instant noodles, that is truly feels bad. We also ordered the sweet potato fries and it came with like 8 fries... 8. Talk about overpriced.   For my first visit, the noodles were much better and was why I even considered revisiting Jinya. I had the Cha Cha Cha ramen and it was very pricey at $15 pre tax. In terms of taste, it was mediocre but definitely not worth the higher cost.   Save yourself from overpriced ramen, a long wait time, and soggy noodles."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere! Just the whole vibe is so nightlife too. I wish there were more vegetarian/vegan ramen options. But I do love the vegetable ramen."}
{"text":"This place is rather expensive for ramen but you do get what you paid for.  At first glance, everything is expensive but when the food come, everything is well worth it.  The portion is big.  I ordered the first chicken.  This was very good value as you have a lot of pieces of chicken and each piece is rather big.  For ramen, i ordered the cha cha ramen.  They don't let you choose the noodle as I guess they want to keep it to what they have design for.  The broth is light, the noodle is good and it comes with 4 pieces of cha siu.  The egg was a disappointment.  It was pretty much hard boil egg.  Also, if you want to add seaweed, it will cost extra.  This place is ok but rather expensive for a bowl of ramen."}
{"text":"Given the fact that I am not a big fan of Pho, I was very ehhh when I was invited to this place. When we got there at about 12:30 am there was a bit of a wait time which I did not really like but it was just about 20 mins. Once I ordered I got the spicy chicken with wontons. It was amazingly good! It was also very reasonably priced. I was check this spot out again. They have so many combinations that you could add to your soup. The service is great. The location is dim and classy. My girlfriend feel in love with the bathroom setting, she said it was very upscale something she did not expect. The portions are also big we even took home some. I recommend this spot! Ramen over pho any day!"}
{"text":"At first I was a little annoyed because of the wait, I hate waiting 25+ minutes, but the wait is worth it! The food was amazing, the prices were affordable, and the customer service was great! I will be back!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best ramen in town - and one of  my personal top 3 places to eat in all of LV. The food is insanely delicious, all at great prices, and the staff is always super cool. The menu gets slightly adjusted every once in a while, but (as a Vegetarian) my current favorite menu items are the Spicy creamy vegan ramen, quinoa salad, spicy tuna tacos, and sautéed green beans. I've never tried anything that I didn't like! And it's also great to-go."}
{"text":"Super yummy ramen and close to the strip! Who knew Las Vegas would have a good ramen spot? I'm excited to learn that they have one in Los Angeles ahahaha good thing because I live in LA!   I had the pork spicy ramen and the big noodles were chewy and tasty my bf had the chicken spicy ramen but like mine more better. They also have add a salad and app for $3.95 I think.. Lol more it's worth it so get it!"}
{"text":"Thank you, gang, your restaurant, food, atmosphere, service, all fantastic. I can't think of a single thing in the last four visits I've made, that wasn't absolutely great. The aggressively delicious #1 Tonkotsu Black Ramen, is preventing me from trying the other ramen choices, but I'm not sorry; I love it. The pork bun, the gyoza, the delicious, pulpy dressing on the salad, the tokyo curry rice. Everything the kitchen puts out is full of flavor - all of them, good.  In a town with a lot of good noodle choices, I drive way out of my way to have a late night meal here. Totally. Worth. It."}
{"text":"Awesome! Love the spicy chicken. Huge servings. Very nice servers. Only negative thing was the wait for a table."}
{"text":"I've only been here twice but I've absolutely loved going each time!! I had the pork ramen which was absolutely amaaaaazing. the seasoned egg and slice of pork were so good!! But I've just recently made the switch to becoming a vegetarian and JINYA offers veggie & vegan ramen! I'm looking forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"So I've been meaning to come here because of many referrals from friends. The staff was really welcoming. My waitress Alex was very nice and made the whole experience. The food was amazing. I've been to a lot of ramen joints here in Vegas and  this place definitely on my top 3."}
{"text":"Place was great!  Went on a Friday at lunch and didn't have to wait when sitting at the communal table.   Service is was excellent. They took the time to explain the menu and were super nice throughout  the entire meal.   The gyoza app was delicious. The wrap had a nice texture. Not to thick.  Not too thin. The filing was tasty. The fried chicken wings were tasty. A little heavy for me but a nice size app. The octopus balls were pretty good. Octopus was tender.   I got the chicken ramen. It was amazing. Not too salty but very rich in flavor. The noodles were cooked great. There were two slices of chicken that were ok. You get free fresh garlic, as much as you want. I also got the broccoli add on which is steamed and serve in the side.   The ramen was great, highly recommend."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!!!! Never had vegan soup with so much flavor I can only imagine the non vegan options. Place is always crowded busy tho which is a good thing. Just prepare your self for a wait not very long."}
{"text":"Id have to say that I truly love the taste of a good, creamy bowl of ramen and being the hours that I work due to the nightlife industry I get off late and all of my favorite hot spot are closed down! After finding about this new place that was open till the early hours of the morning I decided to check it out.  Not only do they have a great selection of ramen bowls but a fantastic/energetic staff and a great environment  I will always go to Jinya for my latenight ramen craving  Justin @ NLS Concierge"}
{"text":"I would rate negative stars if I could. Waited over an hour for a to go order of three raman at 11pm on a Tuesday night. Quoted me 20 minutes on the phone. Nah bruh"}
{"text":"We are native Las Vegans, and noticed this restaurant was brought over from Studio City (LA), CA. The wait was 30 minutes and 5 parties were in front of us (not good for parties over 5 people). After trying 3 apps and 4 entrees the food recommendations for this place are the fried shrimp balls and spicy chicken ramen. This is why this is the best ramen place; the ramen noodles are handmade, the service is attentive and professional, and music bangin' (upbeat and tasteful). Overall there are a lot of choices when it comes to ramen in Vegas, but this is easily top."}
{"text":"So we waited 55 mins but came back 15 mins after our name was called. Katarina or Kat was hosting and she said it was policy that only 5-10 min after could you still be sat, she made an exception for us per request and called the manager who then told her to let us be next. We appreciate them both so much and come here almost 1-2 times weekly and will continue to do so. Making customers feel valued will keep them coming back."}
{"text":"Ordered the spicy chicken ramen and it was absolutely delicious ! Comfortable environment and friendly staff . Definitely will be coming back !"}
{"text":"Best. Broth. Ever. Fairly priced ramen but perfectly crafted! We always come here and it is always packed, its that good!"}
{"text":"With all the ramen shops in town, I have to say Jinya is definitely one of my favorites. Since the first time I started going, I feel like the food has gradually been getting better. There were some items on the menu that were a bit questionable before but now I find myself here quite often ordering those exact same items. Also, just like any typical ramen shop, it's a bit tiny so always be prepared for a 15-25min wait depending on the time of day you go.  They have quite the variety of ramen and rice bowls. The Tonkotsu Black and Cha Cha Cha ramen bowls are definitely great if you're a garlic lover. I usually ask for a side of fresh garlic so I can garlic press straight into my soup until my heart is content. Plus you can get a noodle refill for only $1.60 if all you're left with is broth.  I always stop by for their Happy Hour that runs daily from 3pm-5pm and 10pm-12am. They have the most amazing Salmon Poke tacos. I don't know what sauce they use to marinate with, but seriously, those tacos are godly. They are not stingy with the amount of salmon that goes into the two tacos either and it's only $3! I also always get the Jinya Bun, which includes a nice buttery slice of pork belly.  WIth Jinya's late hours and amazing music playlists, I will continue to find myself here and will hopefully try out some more dishes."}
{"text":"First time here and the place and their ramen is really good.  Staff are very friendly and very attentive.  Longer wait for large party.  But other than that I like the place.  Noodle is great and broth is amazing!!!  Thank you Jinya for the great service!!"}
{"text":"Omg!!!soooo delicious!!!first time trying ramen and it was such a cute lil spot...young and hip and the ramen was soo perfect..I will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Amazing japanese cuisine my wife and I enjoyed the customer service and quality of food totally recommend this place to all ramen lovers"}
{"text":"The cilantro lime chicken wonton ramen was the only thing keeping me coming back. It was absolutely amazing. Since they removed that from the menu, their other ramen options including their various takes on tonkatsu were just underwhelming in taste. I do like their combo options with the ramen though"}
{"text":"I like this lil spot. Worth the wait. Really tasty ramen with lots of \"fixins\" to add too, I liked he po egg. The belly buns were so soft and delicious. And the caramelized cauliflower was pretty good too. I will come again for the Ramen, for sure."}
{"text":"This turned out to be a truly unexpected pleasure. I am in total agreement with my friends, Clint and Philip T reviews, this place has that winning combination of Good Ramen and Excellent Service. I would think of them as independtly owned, and was surprised to find out they were a chain.   The appetizers, which I can't spell right, were generous in portion, good in quality, and a fair price.   Though we had to send one of our Ramen bowls back, to have them change the noodles, they were very good quality, generous portions, and we were satisfied. My son, who was stationed in the Navy in Japan, is a Ramen snob, and he likes it. What does that tell you?  For sure, this place is joining the line up, of places in our regular rotation. Go there hungry, and enjoy quality at very fair prices."}
{"text":"Jinya Ramen Bar is another competitor to hop into the already saturated Vegas ramen scene. I would probably put it on the #3 spot in terms of best ramen spots in Las Vegas. Two things I like about this place is the inclusion of happy hour (3-5pm) and super late hours (open until 3am).  I've had the chance to try both the spicy chicken and tonkotsu varieties over here. The spicy chicken broth has some savory kick (with a choice of mild, spicy, and extra spicy). The tonkotsu broth here is rich and creamy, reminiscent of Monta. Only miss is that the pork chashu was a bit more tough than I'm accustomed to. The pork belly at other ramen spots are much more \"melt in your mouth\" worthy. Here's a rundown of what I've had:  -Crispy chicken (5 pcs): Nice big pieces of chicken karage. Doesn't beat what Fukumimi offers, but it does its job, especially during happy hour prices ($3). 4/5 stars. -Gyoza: Really tasty gyoza here. I wouldn't mind ording another round next time I come by. 4/5 stars. -Curry rice: Nothing really stood out with the curry here. Standard Japanese curry over rice. Not bad, but not amazing either. 3/5 stars.  -Spicy chicken ramen: Rich chicken broth filled with the usual components in a ramen bowl. I was kind of bummed that this was one menu item that didn't come with an egg. I had to add it myself ($1). I really liked it. They give a choice of mild, spicy, and extra spicy. 4/5 stars.  -Jinya Tonkotsu Ramen: Here's that rich and creamy pork broth that I love. Probably my favorite bowl of ramen here. 4.5/5 stars.  -Almond tofu dessert: A creamy almond tofu pudding complemented by kiwi, peach and strawberry fruit topping. This was much more delicious than I expected. 5/5 stars.  I definitely see myself coming back here. The vibe that this place offers is very \"L.A.\" It's hip, modern, and very upbeat. It's much more accommodating as a hangout/date spot than most other ramen bars out there. I like the fact that they have a happy hour, which makes things very reasonable.  Note: Happy hour is daily, from 3pm-5pm. Plenty of drink specials and $3-5 apps."}
{"text":"Any other time I would have given 5 stars but the last time we went the soup was very thick and wasn't as tasty. Customer service is great. We will go back to test out the soups and if they are the same we might have to look for a new ramen bar."}
{"text":"Cool spot, great food, good music and people. Very different than the usual...and they make Kale delicious!!!"}
{"text":"Absolute best Ramen I've had in the vegas area. There was a 40 minute wait to be seated, but I still think it's worth trying if you have time. I tried the chef's special (garlic tonkatsu ramen with Shrimp, pork broth) with extra pork Chashu and my friend got the vegan ramen and it was excellent. I can't wait to go back and try others."}
{"text":"Finally I find good ramen in las vegas.. I like what i got today. Really reccomended!!! Good food & friendly server also nice ambience!! If you haven't try this place, I tell you miss out .. Will be back for sure!!"}
{"text":"Solid Ramen bar, we tried the tempura Brussels sprouts, tempura shrimp to start. Both really delicious and comes with yummy sauces.  I drained my Lychee-tini (garnished with a lychee skewer) because it was delicious!  For the mains, we tried a range of dishes, including the veggie ramen bowl. A bunch of us had the Black Ramen though which was really good.  No need to add on a ajitsuke tamago (flavored hard boiled egg) which is gooey and delicious- it has one already.  Of course, when you enter, the hostess shouts out to announce your arrival and all the staff respond- so that's fun. They do not take reso's so you have to kick it old school by putting your name on the list, but have fun with the name.   I wouldn't say it's my fave Ramen joint in the city, but it's a chain so that's not surprising. It is definitely a solid option though, and a great location!"}
{"text":"We ordered  Takoyaki (octopus ball) with Bonito flakes. There was one itty bitty tiny octopus inside and mostly batter. Kinda bland.  Spicy chicken ramen (chicken broth, chicken chashu, spinach, spicy bean sprouts, tokyo negi, green onion, chili oil served with thin noodles). This is really good and recommended.   Tonkotsu assari (pork broth, pork chashu, kikurage, green onion, seasoned egg, spicy bean sprouts, served with thick noodles). Hearty and flavorful. :)  Tan Tan Men (No soup ramen: noodles with spicy sauce, ground pork, Tokyo negi, Bol choy, red bell pepper, seasoned egg, fried onion, served with thick noodles). It's just okay.   It's more spacious compared to other ramen places. Service is fast and efficient. Will be coming back. :)"}
{"text":"The restaurant is small and very clean. The staff is super friendly and take good care of customers. I had cha cha cha ramen, it was delicious and very garlicky. I recommend anyone coming to Vegas to stop by for a bowl of ramen."}
{"text":"It's finally cold enough to truly enjoy hot soupy things!  Came here late night with some friends. I was surprised at how busy the place was at 10:30pm on a weeknight. But the vibe was cool so I can see why.   The service was a touch of a let down for this place. We arrived, signed in, and we waited for probably close to 10 minutes because there was some confusion about empty tables. Some people that came in after us were aggressive and were trying to get the jump on us to steal a table that just needed some cleaning. They needed to turn the tables over faster and get more organized because it got a touch awkward.   Then when it was time to order, felt a little rushed and I was honestly a little overwhelmed by all of the choices for ramen and possible combos for adding stuff. I wanted to add it all but then my ramen would have been $40 since some of the items are add-ins. Kind of just ended up pointing at a number. The ramen that came out was satisfying enough. I got crazy dragon breath because I squeezed fresh garlic in there. Someone at my table did have an issue with having to remind the waitress about her items. She also did not check on us very often. She was nice but she may have just been overwhelmed (much like I was at the menu options).   I did totally preesh (Master of None quote, not a typo) their happy hour menu. Got to order a cheap beer and some tasty apps. I also got totally nosey watching this couple that looked like they got in a fight and the guy got up and left with his skateboard. So she just kept ordering food for the next hour. Like several desserts and some more dishes. It distracted me hardcore. I wanted to be like \"put one of those ice creams on my tab\" or something."}
{"text":"I ordered to-go on Saturday night and the service was quick and prompt. I was even offered a glass of water while I waited, which was less than 15 minutes. By the time I got home, 20 minutes later, the broth was still warm. My mom likes her soup boiling, so I did reheat both of our broths (which they kindly separated) and poured it over our ramen noodles. We both ordered the same thing, Jinya Tonkotsu Black because we like thin noodles and altered it to our liking. My mom added bamboo shoots. I omitted the spice (I'm a whimp) and green onions and added tofu. The depth of flavor of the broth was spectacular. It was what you hope for when you order ramen: deep, rich, porky goodness. The noodles were the right texture. All the other accoutrements (seasoned egg, seaweed paper, pork chashu, kikurage, garlic chips; garlic oil) made the ramen a complete meal that was delicious. I also ordered takoyaki, fried octopus balls, which were yummy, especially with the sauce they are covered in. I was disappointed in the Jinya bun. The piece of pork chashu was very small in the soft, white bun. I will not order it again. Otherwise, I was really happy with my order. The next time I am craving ramen, I will come back to Jinya!"}
{"text":"I've been to the Jinya in Studio City, CA, which is quite decent. I think I gave it a 4 stars over there. This place was my only hope really in Vegas, after having an okay experience at Monta as well as Ramen Sora.   Black Tonkotsu Ramen- 2 stars. I prefer my ramen to be less fatty, so I didn't like the flavors and it was a bit too greasy for my taste.   Tonkotsu assari ramen with fat noodles- 4 stars. I thought this was the best of the 3 ramen I had. It was still missing something for me, but also good enough.   Spicy tonkotsu ramen- 3 stars. It wasn't spicy, and it was a bit greasy for me still.   I thought the soup to noodle ratio was a bit off. Their broth is very small for how much noodle they give you. I think the garlic press w/ garlic is genius, as it upped my ramen flavor dramatically after adding in a clove or two.   Gyoza- 3 stars. This was again average. Nothing to write home about.   Service was stellar. Nice, posh place, and I'm giving them extra half a star for having a ramen drive-through, because that is just too cool for words. It doesn't even exist in Japan (makes sense cuz there's not much land) and a pretty cool option to have. Of all the ramen places in Vegas, I'd say that this place is the best so far. It's not saying too much however, and I'd take a few places in L.A. any day."}
{"text":"love the ambience. hop n good music. good procing too. alternative to ramen sora. great place to eat and chill."}
{"text":"Really good food! I've been there 3 times. I order the one with fried Brussel sprouts which I can not remember the name of, and I sub chicken instead of pork. It's in the upper right hand corner of menu. You won't be sorry. Wait time is always chills and Service is good enough. They offer diff size noodles which I like too."}
{"text":"UGHHHHHH why can't Vegas figure out how to make ramen. Nothing stood out about JINYA and the chashu in my bowl was cold. Not that I particularly love the other ramen shops in Vegas, but I do prefer them over JINYA."}
{"text":"We arrived at JINYA around 8. It was really busy and the red headed host was a hard worker and wasn't taking anyone's shit. ( I liked her) we waited around 35 min then we got seated at the big table. The house was packed but we got service really quick. I don't remember our servers name but he was an Asian guy with glasses. We ordered our food along with our waters seeing that a huge rush was coming. I'm a vegan so I ordered the Spicy Vegan Ramen. Once our server found out i was a vegan he took it one step further by letting me know what i can and cannot have on he table along with telling me what was in the appetizer that I couldn't have. This impressed me and made me feel comfortable. We also ordered the sweet potato sticks and we could've done without them. The presentation was cute but the taste wasn't that good and texture was hard. (If you're vegan don't eat the dip it has honey) Our ramen on the other hand was Probably one of the beat ramens I've ever had. I didn't want it to end and the people around us also couldn't stop talking about how good it was."}
{"text":"JINYA Ramen Bar continues to expand. First heard about them in Vancouver and they've already set up shop in Calgary.    Hours are pretty good. Everyday open till 10:00pm! The inside is very chic modern.  - Peach and mango pop ($3.80 each) - cute little Japanese fruit drinks. I tried a taste of both; tasted like fizzy pop with a lighter, more subtle flavour. - JINYA Bun ($4.50) - this surprised me. The bun was light, fluffy and the chashu completely tenderized. - Old school ramen ($12.50) - I thought this one would match my ramen preferences but broth/noodles weren't to my liking. Thin noodles didn't do it for me. I decided to combo up my ramen with their pork gyoza (4 pieces) and salad combo ($4.95). Salad was pretty standard but the sauce was tasty. The gyoza were better than expected. Crispy, juicy inside and not just an afterthought.  - Premium tonkotsu white ($13.25) - broth was much more flavourful. Natdogg throughly enjoyed it. - Vegetable soup ramen ($11.95) - don't see many vegetarian ramen's so keep this in mind if you have vegetarian friends.  Cowtown continues to get an onslaught of ramen joints opening up. Worth a try if you've never been to JINYA but I prefer their Vancouver location(s)."}
{"text":"I had the Jinya chicken ramen today and the shrimp balls!  Wow.  The noodles tasted fresh made, the sauteed shallots on top of the soup had such good flavor with the chicken broth and slices of white meat chicken.  The shrimp balls, were crunchy, not greasy and they texture of the shrimp inside was fresh-like nothing I've ever tasted before.  I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Tonkatsu black, takoyaki, gyoza, and Jinya bun.  Tonkatsu black was creamy and the broth was good but I felt it was lacking something. Not sure what that something is but I added chili to give some spice. I ordered it with thick noodles. The egg was cooked perfectly. Over time the broth did become too salty to my liking.   The takoyaki had a very nice preservation and came with a sauce that was creamy and very rich. It was delicious at first but by the end the richness was very overpowering. The octopus was roughly chopped and inside a fried ball shell.   Gyoza was alright. Not the best but not the worst I've tried. Not memorable.  The jinya bun was my favorite. Moist, sweet and melted in your mouth. I'd come again just for the buns.  The staff was very nice and prompt. They all stood good bye as we left."}
{"text":"First time to eat here with my hubby and friends. They get super busy during lunchtime but it's worth the wait!!! I tried the JINYA Tonkotsu Black Ramen and it was delicious! For dessert, I got the Green Tea Blockpop drizzled in chocolate topped with Pistachios."}
{"text":"This place is as good as everyone says it is and I'm kicking myself for not going here sooner. I've been going to fukumimi ramen on eastern and trop for years, always trying to convince everyone it was the place to go. I will never step foot in there again. Jinya not only has the best flavor of ramen, but their noodles taste unlike any other. Their menu is extensive too and they offer a killer happy hour. AND they have craft beers. The music is great too. Definitely has a millennial vibe. I would come here on a date or just dinner by myself. This little restaurant is one room and it pumps out the best and most authentic meals In vegas. I hardly come across places I like and I can't wait to come again. Disclaimer: the line is long but so worth it. (I waited about 20 minutes and it was just me). Be patient with the hostess she is also the cashier for all the servers and takes all to go orders in person and over the phone. Being in the f &b service, my heart goes out to people who are in such high pressured jobs. I know how it is! You are appreciated   UPDATE: put an order through door dash. They (jinya) called me 45 minutes later to tell me the order couldn't go through. Wow"}
{"text":"So good to be True, I visit this place with my husband we ordered Ramen and Takoaki everything was very testy and price was good as well but on the same night I'm stars feel herself really bad, I'm got poisoned by this food! It's terrible:(("}
{"text":"Jinya ramen is a trendy restaurant with modern music and a fun community table at the center of its seating. This place can be loud and packed on the weekends so don't expect to converse easily. Jinya does not have a waiting area and can be very busy, so busy in fact our group had to wait outside for our table. Their shrimp balls and salmon poke taco appetizers were absolutely amazing. They offer vegetarian broth options which can be hard to find at ramen places. Their noodles were perfectly al dente. They offer thick and thin noodles, my favorite being their thick! I recommend stopping in during their happy hour for cheap delicious appetizers."}
{"text":"I come here at least once a month. Last night my daughter and I went there around midnight. I always order the Cha Cha Cha.with xtra egg. BOMB! ! But I had to drop you 2 stars. Word of advice....you really need to warm up your egg and pork separately until its out of danger temp zone. My pork and egg still had a chill to it which made the soup  warm.... I almost felt like gagging towards the end of our meal.... I'll give Jinya anotjer chance.. because of the Cha Cha Cha with xtra egg.....cmon Jinya... step it up! Your my favorite Ramen spot.... I recommend you to all my friends..making me look bad....."}
{"text":"Great ramen. Ordered tonkatsu ramen hot spicy and it was delicious. I really like how you can customize it with all toppings you want. And the pork buns where really good so was the curry rice everything is good here."}
{"text":"Five stars for the food.   My boyfriend just moved to the US and this was the first place we went to dinner. I am so embarrassed with the impression he now has of American service.   If I could give zero stars for the service I would. I take pride in tipping well. This is the first time in my life that I left giving a zero tip. I do not expect or need to be pampered when I go out to eat, but as a customer I do expect a certain level of service, just as I know I am expected to tip.   Host was amicable and was able to get us a booth. Unfortunately for us it was in Alex's section. Some things I did not enjoy: - We were treated as if we were a thorn in his side - He tossed the drink menu onto the table and left before we ordered - My friend accidentally dropped the menu as she was passing it to him. He watched it fall onto the floor and walked away without picking it up. - Our tab was brought to the table while we were still eating. Yall are busy, need to turn tables around, no big deal. We weren't done though, so my friend ordered dessert. We watched it sit on the counter, and had the tab brought to our table again by the same person who brought it the first time. She was the person we had ordered the dessert from. Getting the tab to us seemed to be more of a priority than our food.   Alex did not come back to our table until after we asked for his name. At that point I didn't want anything else.   I am extremely sad the night turned out like this. I was texting my dad while I read the menu telling him how much he would love it here and how I couldn't wait to bring him. That will not be happening now.   I know it is busy and yall always have a line outside, but there are much busier places that would never treat customers like this. The attitudes of some of the servers would not be acceptable at a high school concession stand. We did notice that servers in other sections seemed to be much more involved with their tables. I am sure sitting in another section would be a much better experience, but the taste in my mouth is going to make it very difficult to come back.   Extreme shame because the food at Jinya is extremely good. Come if you don't mind being treated like shit."}
{"text":"My go to ramen spot in Vegas. Non pork options are a definite plus. Service is on point. Usually crowded but worth the wait"}
{"text":"This was my first true ramen experience( I have had top ramen but no this place is true ramen as I like to put it) and I am in love only downside for me would be the cost but other than that great service and excellent ramen. I work right up the street and if it didn't cost as much I would eat it for lunch practically everyday. Mmmmmmm goooodd"}
{"text":"We decided to check out this new spot after our late night movie. We walked into the restaurant and it had a cool layout. There's a giant table in the middle with multiple booths surrounding it.   We were seated at this tiny booth for two along the wall. Then the server approached us, asking how our day was and in return she told us she's had a long day and it could have been better... Like what do you say back to that?! Awkwarddd...   Then she briefly explained the menu and their popular items and gave us literally 1 minute to look over the menu. I get that they are going for a dim dinner feel, but we could not see what the menu had to offer. We had to pull out the flashlight on our iPhones to read the menu. She came back but obviously we weren't ready, because we couldn't even read the menu to begin with..   Finally she came back and my boyfriend and I both picked out the spicy chicken ramen. I'm kind of a picky eater so I asked what each ingredient was. When I asked about the \"Tokyo Negi\" she literally stood there for 30 seconds, blank stare, not knowing how to explain what it was.... So I just asked for that on the side.   I added mushrooms, corn, and butter. As she was taking our order on the iPad, I had to repeat over and over what I wanted.. Again she said, sorry it's been a long night..     After that I went to the ladies room. I was surprised by their high tech toilet that lifted up by itself when it felt my motion near it. It even had a seat warmer lol! And that was the highlight of my experience there, pretty much hah....   Finally, our food came out and I didn't see the butter or the mushrooms..  Pretty bummed out, but I didn't say anything. I was so hungry, that I could not  wait any longer. My stomach was growling all day.  Overall the food was good, but I still like Monta Ramen wayyy better!!   Their service definitely needs improvement if they want to compete with the others."}
{"text":"Very good, traditional ramen. The lunch deal is excellent- a ton of food. Bigger noodles are better. Ask for a garlic press!"}
{"text":"I am not one who really likes ramen. I've tried a couple ramne places here in town but they are \"okay.\" But, I must say, their spicy chicken ramen was so delicious and perfect for a very chilly night!"}
{"text":"I'm not a tourist. I know Vegas very well. I pass through Vegas several times a year. Jinya is my favorite ramen place. My favorites are the Cha Cha and the Black Ramen. In both cases the broth is very flavorful. Noodles are done right. The soft boiled egg adds texture and mouth feel to the entire bowl of noodles. I can't wait to go back !"}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday night around 9-10pm I believe. I ordered the black tonkatsu ramen and the crispy chicken. I couldn't quite taste the garlic tbh so that could've been better. I did for sure enjoy the thin noodles. They were really chewy. Chicken was too salty for me and quite greasy as well. It comes with a sauce that's a bit tangy and has a small bit of cooking wine flavour. I would've appreciated it more if the chicken wasn't salty already lol. I would come back again to try something else on their menu. Quality is there and maybe it's because I'm not the biggest fan of savoury things. Price-wise it is a bit more on the expensive side, depending on your order. I paid around $20ish for the ramen and chicken (which I split with a friend)."}
{"text":"Our group of 4 was told we would have to wait 40 minutes for a table, but we only had to wait 10 for seats at the bar! I ordered the chicken ramen and a pork bun. Both were fantastic. The food came out quickly and the noodles were perfectly chewy. I do wish the egg had been cut in half."}
{"text":"Food is great. Service not so much they take forever to check on you if that.  The place is but so big for them not to tend to you."}
{"text":"3.5/5, +.5 for service  So, another ramen place in Toronto. Might as well give it a shot.  Unlike the other ramen places, Jinya is actually reasonable in size, which likely explained why the place wasn't full on a Friday lunch hour. There was constant traffic in and out, so the word on this place was definitely out there.  This place has an interesting selection of ramen, and that alone will likely make me return here. I decided to stick with their specialties (they have three bowls that are deemed famous), so I went with the \"Sprouting Up\" ramen.  I will start by saying I'm not an expert on brussel sprouts, and ordered it simply because it sounded interesting. In fact, this was actually the first time I've ever eaten brussel sprouts. Regardless, I liked the thick ramen they used, and I found the broth to be quite good. The brussel sprouts are an acquired taste, so for me it's not something I'll eat again. The pork was to my expectations.  Service was excellent, and the servers took the time to explain what each ramen was and recommendations. Yup, will definitely try the other options next time I'm here."}
{"text":"Even though it was busy, I feel as though service could have been much better.  I ordered the special Karaage Chicken Ramen, and they forgot my egg. I told the waitress and she goes \"Okay, I'll bring it later\". So, I start eating. As my soup is almost done (and I was eating slow), she finally brings out a cold soft boiled egg. Not impressed.   Portions are considerably small for the higher than normal prices, and while nothing tasted bad, it wasn't amazing and definitely not worth the money. I've had much better. Also, this didn't feel (or taste) very authentic. More like a rushed, gimmcky chain placed in a high-traffic area. I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Broth is excellent and that's where the compliments stop. Went in last night around midnight and ordered the Tonkatsu Black when I noticed a strange stringy substance in my mouth. Pulled it out and found a hair .. but not one of those long hairs from someone's head, rather, a short curly hair much resembling a pube. Brought this to the server's attention and she apologized profusely and got me a new bowl but by then my mom had finished eating and I was grossed out it threw off the meal and I couldn't finish.  This place has a C health rating for a reason. Enjoy your ramen with pubes.  No discount on the tab either, server never refilled our drinks, and location is in a shady area. Pass, for pubes."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the food and atmosphere here. Servers were friendly and he asked me if it was my first time here and he introduced me to the menu and popular items. I went with the ramen combo with gyoza and a salad. I chose the sprouting up ramen. It has Brussels sprouts, bean sprouts, pork, egg in it. Loved it. I did think they put too much Brussels sprouts in it but that was it. The pork gyoza came out hot and it was yummy. It was smaller than what the pictures made it look like. Flavor of the broth was awesome and it filled me up. It's a great place to go if you have ramen craving."}
{"text":"First off, I hate giving bad review... So here it goes:  Came in at 2AM after a night of drinking, so I was obviously hungry.   1.) wait times were long, considering the time.. Usually drunchies are the worst so it was a bad start.   2.) the main reason why I gave this place two stars was because they messed up my order. I ordered for non-spicy Tonkotsu and she gave me a spicy bowl.. Like I said, I spicy isn't in my palette so you could only imagine eating a jalapeño when you're drunk.   I didn't bother to complain, I still paid & just left unhappy. Wish I better had a better experience, but it happens. :/"}
{"text":"I went here once with a friend after work around midnight. It was fairly full but we were seated right away. I ate these sort of squid balls that had like egg on the bottom and it looked so cute :3 haha. The ramen was yummy and I enjoyed it very much. The atmosphere was great and my friend and I had a nice time. Prices are great too."}
{"text":"They've had some major service issues in the past, and they earned themselves a c rating from the health department. But in the past few months, this place has had a complete 180. The A rating has returned. The whole staff greets every new table. The servers were all attentive without being annoying. It's absolutely remarkable how much they've changed and turned things around.   The food was already one of the best in town, but the philosophy changes also seemed to have made their way into food quality. While before, I may have internally debated which was the absolute best ramen in town, this place now wins. It's absurd good.  I usually get pork broth ramens, and I absolutely adore their spicy tonkotsu. It's completely fantastic. Just make sure you realize their spice levels are a little weird. It's mild then spicy and the spiciest level is hot. It is listed on the menu, but you might miss it. (Hot, their spiciest level is the best level. Although it still needs an extra spoonful of the table side hot sauce.)  One small qualm. Their seasoned eggs are served whole. I stopped ordering them, and I miss them. But I really wish they were cut in half. It looks better presentation wise and it's edible in halves.   Overall, go and eat here yesterday."}
{"text":"I came after reading all the great reviews but unfortunately it didnt lead to my expectations.  i give it a 3 star because the staf is very nice and attentive and regardless of my review i definitely think people should give it a try. the ramen itself were pretty tasty. the creamy vegan ramen was good but the veggie one was basically ramen with a salad on top, wasnt really creative and i wish it has more flavor like the creamy ramen but still ok. place was sticky. the ramen bowel was dirty with sauce from preobably someone else food who has that bowel before us. the forks had food on it still. and they were actually dirty with food, not hard water stains but actual food stuck to it. the tables and bench was sticky but what was worse were the menus. i know they are busu but wosh theu took the time to at least clean the dishes and silverwear better. food again was not bad but ive has better."}
{"text":"My bf and I walked in there at 2:21 am, as we walked in, we were informed that last call is 2:30, closing is at 3. As we were being seated, the cooks in the kitchen immediately screamed \"woahhhh\" and made gesture towards the waiter of how many min left until last call. We walked out right away. Very unprofessional. We were afraid that they will spit on our food judging by the way how the kitchen guys greeted us."}
{"text":"I couldn't believe all the hype behind this restaurant. There's a bit of a wait to get a table at certain times. If you come after 1:00pm on Saturday it seems the rush does down for a bit and some empty tables can be found after the lunch rush. We got the bun, takoyaki, 2 other bowls of spicy ramen. Maybe I was too full from the appetizers to really appreciate the ramen. I can't say it's the best bowl of ramen but it wasn't bad either. The soup was really thick so a glass of coke was welcome to wash it down with. The menu is quite larger and there's a good selection of appetizers and some desserts. I would probably come back if I was in the area but I definitely wouldn't go out of my way to come here. It didn't blow me away but the service was pretty good considering past reviews."}
{"text":"sat 11/19/16  2.42pm We came here so many times and  the manager or waitress normally managed the wait list well. The service were great!   This time, we walked in and signed in the list.  It was not busy; 2 available tables, 4 opened seats in the middle table, and 2 available seats at the bar. But there were about 4-5 names (2,4,2,2 ppl) in front of us: 4 ppl were waiting outside and 6ppl long line inside.   But 2 waitress and 1 waiter did not care to seat all customers to these empty seats!!!   Now,  we have been waiting for 20 mins with other 8 customers now. There were now 6 available seats in the middle table plus 1 table just left.   We were leaving at 3.45pm! There were 6 ppl in line and there were still 5 available seats in the middle and 1 empty table, and 4 opened seats at the bar in the restaurant.  I know food is good that why customers like me are coming back. But if writer/es don't care to seat customers who waiting in cold weather hungry in emthy restaurant, not sure it is call good service!!!  Does the owner them to run the restaurant like this?"}
{"text":"Ordered the tonkotsu spicy ramen which didnt seem spicy just the hot sauce that was on top. The pork and noodles had good flavor though. Also we ordered mochi ice cream the chocolate was firm but the green tea was soft and already melting."}
{"text":"LOVE JINYA but if I'm ordering takeout it should be ready when I arrive. They told me it would be about 25 minutes and I arrived closer to 35-40 minutes. When I got in they told me about 5 minutes then they needed to pack everything up. I waited an additional 15 minutes before getting my food. Super disappointed that takeout here actually means nothing.   They also messed up my order. Maybe tonkotsu broth in la means something different than tonkotsu in Vegas. Just wanted to get home and eat my food but instead I spend 15 minutes waiting for my food and another 10 trying to sort out my order. Heavy sigh. I think I'll stick to the JINYA back home."}
{"text":"Not only is the Ramen spot on, the venue itself very well decorated with a very hip feel -- nice and dim, good music and just an overall great ambiance! I would say it can get a little loud however this is what makes the atmosphere what it is. This will be a stop anytime I am in the area."}
{"text":"Came here with my roommate. We got seated immediately.  I ordered the Umami Miso Ramen, which has pork & was somewhat spicy.  He ordered the #1 - Tonkotsu Black Ramen  They were pretty busy with a few open tables left.  I finished my water & left it on the edge of the table & the waitress came over & apologized & quickly refilled it. I didn't wait long.  Even though I'm not a huge fan of ramen, the one I got was tasty & quite filling.  $10 per ramen is a little pricy but overall I was satisfied with my experience & will visit again.  4.5 stars out of 5.. Not quite a 5 but close!"}
{"text":"Still my favorite place for ramen and other yummy food!  I've tried a couple other ramen places while around town and they all pale in comparison to Jinya!    I love that they are open late so I can get my fix after work lol.  They are usually busy so you probably will have to wait for a little bit but who wants to eat at a slow restaurant anyway.  They have two different happy hour times with some awesome specials.  I've never been disappointed here.    Prices are good, food is delicious, and service is excellent...what more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"I'm not gonna lie, I don't usually go out for ramen.  It's usually too salty, so I just make chapagetti at home and I'm happy.  But I saw that Jinya just opened and it offered a happy hour?! I just had to check it out.  Jinya opens up at 3pm, which is also when their HH starts (3- 5pm) which is great if you want to enjoy some ramen and different appetizers/beer.  They even offer bottomless mimosas for $10!  I love how extensive their menu is!  There are about 10 different ramen to choose from, you can also turn it into a combo which includes a salad + your choice (either gyoza, chasu bowl, curry rice, california roll, crispy chicken.) And if you're not feeling like ramen, you can order off their tapas menu which includes salads, curry and rice bowls, desserts, and more.   I ordered the Tonkotsu Black Ramen and Jinya Bun.  The Jinya bun was a great start to the meal!  The Chasu Pork had the melt in yo mouth consistency and the gooeyness from the barbecue sauce went perfectly together.   The ramen was just as described and looked exactly like the picture!  What sets Jinya apart from the others is the flavor of their broth. My tastebuds are usually hit by overload of salt and it just ruins the experience for me.  However, with Jinya's broth, the garlic oil, garlic chips, fried onion, and chili paste added depth to the broth and changed my perspective on going out for ramen.  I'm actually really excited to come back for more!"}
{"text":"First time here, I ordered the House Special (Spicy Chicken Ramen) it was delicious and also, added a Soy Egg.  The ramen was  done just right. Excellent Service as well."}
{"text":"Good food but not for a wait time of more than 30 minutes each visit. The owners or holding officers of JINYA needs to realize they don't have enough tables or space for their business and start thinking it's time to expand into a much larger place."}
{"text":"Ramen broth was good. The chicken ramen broth that came with the kids meal was tasty but scary thick... or fatty? Tempura brussel sprouts was good. Hubby ordered the tonkotsu black, his bowl was empty after. I had the sprouted ramen. It was meh. Ordered the takoyaki, it wasn't good. Wasn't soft and melts in your mouth like the ones in LA.   Another thing I noticed is that the seats are all sticky. When I sit up from a leaning position, i feel my hair sticking to the back of my seat. My pants were sticking to the chairs as well. Its like the whole place doesn't get wiped down often. Kinda questions the overall sanitation of the place.   Will I come back? Not until I check out other ramen places. Def not a first pick."}
{"text":"My new favorite Ramen place! I usually go to Monta, but usually end up feeling sick from all the oil. This place has more seating, the staff is on point, and the menu has more to offer. I had the spicy chicken Ramen, the meat was tender and flavorful, and I enjoyed all the elements of the dish. I love that they have combination meals, because let's face it, sometimes noodles are not enough. But with the addition of the gyoza and salad that came with my noodle combination, I left very happy and full! I can't wait to try out their other menu items!"}
{"text":"Overrated and overhyped. Ordered Spicy Chicken Ramen with Corn and Butter. Food was just okay and a bit plain. The portion was very small. Felt like I was eating a kid's meal. I was so disappointed that I made this Yelp account. Go SORA or go home!"}
{"text":"Sadly this place doesn't hold up against it's sister stores in Los Angeles. The ambience is nice and the place is well designed but sadly the staff aren't trained to the same level. I ordered the Black Tonkotsu which was phenomenal while my girlfriend got the Cha Cha Cha. They did this cool thing where they actually give you the garlic cloves so you can add fresh garlic to your ramen. But sadly they served the ramen raw. The noodle was extremely firm and still hard on the inside. They apologized and gave her a fresh bowl. Though they did try to argue that since the noodle was a thicker kind it was supposed to be a bit more firm. Too bad for them my girlfriend is from Japan, so they couldn't quite one up her when it comes to ramen since well she grew up eating that stuff haha. Other than that everything else was fine."}
{"text":"Oh Jinya, my go to joint when I am in Houston. I didn't realize it was a chain so I was ecstatic when I found out Calgary had one.   I'm a big fan of the modern, sleek and dim decor of the restaurant. The star, however, is the broth. The broth here is excellent, and so are the seasoned eggs. The ramen was very good, though someone how overall not as good as Jinya in Houston, maybe the broth noodle ratio is different. The noodles are passable, though not a highlight.  Overall a wonderful place for ramen - I will definitely be a repeat visitor."}
{"text":"I've never been to this place before so I thought I would try it out. We had a party of 5 and I understand that we must have the whole party present in order for us to be sat down.   Service: My friends were parking and the rude hostess looked out the door for couple seconds and skipped us. She has an attitude problem. She has dark hair color and she was wearing a choker the day I came. There was another hostess I believe and she was preppy and nice. But unfortunately we didn't get that kind of service from the other hostess. The server was okay. He didn't smile the first time but smiled after we ordered. Honestly the service really killed my mood. As a first timer here, I would never come back. First impression is everything.   Food: The ramen was good. Not too salty and the portion size was just right! I really love the way they boiled the egg."}
{"text":"When you arrive in Vegas at 2AM and crave Asian food...your options are limited. Luckily one of them is JINYA :)) I tried the tonkotsu and tantan noodles both of which were delicious!! Overall solid late night vegas choice.  Service was great and plenty of parking in lot."}
{"text":"My experience at Jinya Ramen Bar was lackluster.  My friend and I came with empty stomachs and a big appetite.  So, we ordered enough food for a party of 4.    Cha Cha Cha for garlic lovers was suppose to be my chosen one.  Unfortunately, the thick broth had a weird garlic favor.  I love garlic, and Cha Cha Cha did not do it for me.  The ramen noodle was good.  The broth didn't complement the rest of the bowl.  I elected the pork chashu bowl to supplement.  I prefer the pork bowl at Monta Ramen.  My buddy had the tonkotsu ramen and it was good.  On par with every other ramen shop.  The appetizers we tried were the pork gyoza, jinya dynamite, and crispy chicken.  The crispy chicken was delicious! The jinya dynamite was heavy in mayo and it overwhelmed the dish.  If it was lighter on the mayo, the dish would've been tastier."}
{"text":"I've tried different choices of Ramen except the spicy ones and can say the Tonkatsu Black is by far the most flavorful for me. Doing the combo with the Fried Chicken or the California Rolls, you just can't go wrong and have nothing bad to say but yummy! The Takoyaki balls and steam pork bun is also a very good treat! One of the best Ramen places to go and they close at 3am, that's always a plus when the other Ramen places are almost all closed by then. Service all the time is always very attentive and courteous. Cool atmosphere but just have to wait for a booth sometimes if you don't want to be slurping next to a total stranger on the king size table in the middle of the restaurant."}
{"text":"My first time visiting was on Saturday night. I caught a movie at the Palms and decided to head over and try out some Ramen. I've had Pho before and it was delicious but I knew deep down in my heart I'd love Ramen more and boy was I right! This place was amazing! I went around the happy hour time of 10pm-12am and started off with some hot Sake for only $5. Talk about a good buzz for cheap. I was floating with the stars and still had plenty to share with my girlfriend. I ended up ordering the Crispy Chicken Appetizer and the Spicy Chicken Ramen at the hottest level. That chicken was so perfectly fried and seasoned and the sauce they serve with it was out of this world. I loved every bit of it! Now let's get to the Ramen. The broth...... OMG. It was savory and bold in flavor and is exactly what I like. I ordered the Seasoned Egg and also added Ground Chicken (Can't remember the exact name on the menu) =( and I was beyond satisfied. Our server was great and checked on us periodically and the overall atmosphere was chill and relaxed with dim lighting. I will definitely be back here on a regular basis. My GF also taught me how to use chop sticks that night so that made it even a greater experience. I felt like an idiot looking at everyone going to work while I was the only one who had a fork in my hand lol. I'm not sure what some of the bad reviews are about but just know you can't please everyone so don't hesitate to give this place a try!  -P.S. I'm a Chef so take my word for it. I know what good food tastes like ;-) (Instagram: Thekitchenleroux)"}
{"text":"Favorite Favorite Ramen and appetizer spot in Vegas! They have such an awesome selection of chicken Ramen  the broth and the noodles are amazing, ambience is dope! Looking forward to my next stop in"}
{"text":"Im a regular here and its one of my favorite ramen places in town. I always get either the spicy chicken ramen or the spicy tonkatsu, depending on what I'm feeling. It's a great price for the portioning."}
{"text":"Hearty and filling. Jinya provides a heaping serving of noodles and toppings with a thick heavy broth.   The taste is top notch, full bodied flavours, and texture. A little on the salty side.   Price is on the higher side for a ramen place. Although Portion size reflects the price  4/5 too heavy; makes me sleepy. But very tasty."}
{"text":"We violently (lol) fell in LOVE with this place!!!! We go to ramen or izakaya or similar places all the time in Montreal, we've seen and tasted it all, and this instantly became our top 3 most favorite place ever. The staff was very young but very polite and friendly (seems to be rare these days). The place was packed but we only had to wait about 10 minutes for a party of 3. It's super nicely decorated, so cozy. The music was great. The FOOD, omg the food... It was so perfeeeeect. The taste was there, everything was soooo amazing!!!!!! Super mega tasty menu. Good portions, fair prices! A different deal everyday. They did forget to bring us one thing we ordered, but since we weren't hungry anymore we asked not to charge/bring it and they obliged. One other small thing is no wi-fi, but at this point, who needs their phones anyways when you're having such a great time!! :3 Will come back again and make it a staple anytime we'll be in TO next!"}
{"text":"Jinya Ramen Bar has an interesting seating arrangement with individual tables surrounding a large center table that can fit total of 15+. After frequenting Monta and Sora countless times, I decided to give Jinya a try.   Upon looking at the menu, I was enamored by the Jinya Pork Bun which was excellent. A friend in the party ordered gyoza and that was surprisingly good. (My expectations for gyoza are usually pretty low)    Next came the Spicy Chicken Ramen with HOT spice level. It was ok, nothing too special. Friend got the Tonkotsu Black which is more garlicky and rich and I think that would have been a bit more to my liking. 3 stars  Comparing all these ramen places is difficult, but I'd still rank Ramen Sora as my personal favorite. However, the side dishes (Pork Bun and Gyoza) were so delicious that I give it 4 stars."}
{"text":"Great ramen!! I don't know why or how I became such a sucker for ramen now even worse that I found the true true BOMB bomb place. Lol ¯\_(?)_/¯ BOMB"}
{"text":"Updating my review to admit that I have converted my loyalty to Jinya.   The Tonkotsu Spicy is now my go to and highly recommended. With the seasoned egg it's close to perfection.  The service never disappoints and food always comes out quick. The ramen comes in these awesome bowls too, my roommate and I always joke about how we want to accidentally take one or two home..."}
{"text":"I'm giving 5 stars only for 1 server Gino. He was the best. Sorry bud it took so long. He's very helpful, knows menu well. Very sweet and kind! Awesome with my kids unlike his fellow server, tall Asian with mustache who was very rude to my kids especially. Food was good. Nice atmosphere.  Gino your the best! Jinya, Gino needs promotion & raise"}
{"text":"Excellent food, great ambiance. Great spot to have a quick bowl of ramen with friends after work. Highly recommended to everyone!!!"}
{"text":"Bad first: they were kinda meat stingy. Just keeping it real. They are one of three local ramen spots I've gone to and the shortage of pork we got was immediately visible in comparison. I will also say that I can see seating being very problematic. It looks VERY easy to reach capacity with even just a few people. I'm thankful I didn't come during a busy time. That would be a rough wait.   Now good: the service was kind and involved. The recommendation was well received. The thin noodles are fantastic. I wish the other spots offered those because I loved them. The flavor was on point. Not too much sodium. Good stuff. I liked the decor a lot."}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots. GARLIC LOVERS UNITE! They offer fresh garlic you can press in to your bowl of Ramen. Every item I have had so far has been very flavorful."}
{"text":"I've been needing a Ramen fix for a while. I think my love for Ramen has allowed me to become somewhat of a connoisseur, but for that reason I could not give it a five. Nonetheless, if you're into metro style dining I would give it a 5 for the ambiance."}
{"text":"I went for lunch here on a Monday hoping the line wasn't as bad.  I drove by on the Sunday and there was at least 20 people waiting outside.   We got there at 11:50 and there was already a 20 minute wait.  We waited since we figured there would be a line for the next while due to it being a new restaurant.   The hostess did give us a menu so we could look at it during our wait.  We got seated at the bar.    We decided to try the caramelized cauliflower, crispy chicken, cha cha cha and the vegan ramen.  The caramelized cauliflower was very good and refreshing due to the citrus.  The crispy chicken was just alright for us because I think it was given to us quite a bit after it was fried so it was warm and not that crispy anymore. The cha cha cha ramen was huge. The ramen also comes with fresh garlic that you can add. The broth was very heavy; it had very good flavour.  I definitely could have shared this with the hubby. The vegan creamy ramen was very good. We didn't ask but the vegan ramen came with the yellow noodles (we're not sure if there was egg in there and we didn't bother asking).  Its definitely worth a try if you enjoy ramen.  I would definitely come back to try the other items on the menu. We were too full to have the mochi green tea ice cream. There's always next time."}
{"text":"A few of us ate here last night. The five stars is for the Ramen. Seriously delicious. Now, if you're looking for other cuisine like sushi they have a few roles but honestly this is a ramen house all the way. Also, we had their Brussel sprout tempura which was unique for sure. I had the quinoa and kale salad....yea they had a quinoa and kale salad and it was delicious. We had great and eclectic meal but hands down the ramen was incredible. We have had ramen everywhere in LA and this was definitely up to the challenge."}
{"text":"Having heard good things about the chain, we decided to come here instead of Hapa Izakaya on a cold Friday lunch since we were craving a bowl of hot ramen.  We got the last table just after 12, and as mentioned there is no waiting area and no reservations are accepted so make sure you go slightly off-peak unless you want to wait.  The food came out fairly quickly, I ordered the Old Skool and gf got the Feb special Tokyo Tonkotsu.  I also asked for the fresh garlic topping which is offered free here.  They provide a container of peeled garlic and provide a garlic press for you to season to your own preferences.  The Tokyo Tonkotsu is a pork based broth and it is definitely richer and thicker than my chicken based broth.  Both bowls were topped with a perfectly cooked egg.  However, the egg was cold because the broth in both bowls weren't hot enough.  The pork chashu were nice and tender without being overly fatty.  Both of these bowls came with the thin noodles which are reminiscent of al-dente Italian pasta which was great.  Wanting to try the thick noodles, I ordered the Kaedama (extra noodles).  They warned me that since my broth was flavored for the thin noodles the taste might be too light, so I'm guessing the broths with the thick noodles are more concentrated.  The noodles came hot on a plate and slid into the remainder of my broth.  They were much thicker and firmer than typical ramen noodles with good bounce.    Overall the noodles themselves were great.  The gf preferred the thick noodles and I preferred the thin, but both are above average in my opinion.  However, they were let down by the tepid broth temperature which also dragged down the perfectly cooked egg.  The service was OK, however it took a while to get our bill.  I might come back eventually to try the  Cha Cha Cha ramen that has earned lots of good reviews, but as of now I prefer Hapa Izakaya as my downtown ramen lunch spot.  It looks like takeout is available if you don't want to wait in line since I saw some people swing by to pick up food in styrofoam containers."}
{"text":"Amazing foods, friendly service and good vibes! What more can you ask   Flavorful ramen options! My boyfriend loves the Cha Cha Cha one! I personally don't care for ramen but there other dishes to choose instead of ramen. They also have happy hour which is always a plus!"}
{"text":"This place was so good! Coming from the East Coast where pho is extremely popular, it was a bit of a different experience coming to a Ramen house.   I started off with the tempura Brussel sprouts and the fried chicken thighs. Both were really good, although the chicken was my favorite.  I then have the wanton chicken ramen bowl. Don't let the bowl deceive you because a nice serving size comes with the order. It was really nice to have a selection of broths to choose from: chicken broth, vegetarian broth, or pork broth.  And, of all of the different noodle places that I have ever been to, this was the very 1st place that I had ever seen, where as long as you hold on to your remaining broth, you can order a second round of noodles for less than $2!  And, the list of additives that you can add to your order are plentiful. Everything from corn to butter, mushrooms, egg, cheese, tomato, at cetera etc etc.....  I will definitely be back to this place!"}
{"text":"It was very blasé.  Food not great and expensive for what it was.  Atmosphere was neat and staff were friendly and efficient.  I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Great ambiance. Only place with better ramen is Monta. I particularly recommend spicy wonton ramen. Awesome place for groups and for getting your late night fix."}
{"text":"I ate there last night. What a delightful find. I had the salmon tacos...SO TASTY!  Had the vegetarian ramen and the made it with the vegan tofu sauce.  Nice!!!  Service is great & friendly.  Great variety in their menu.  Will definitely go back & tell my friends."}
{"text":"I love this place. The worst thing about it is the small space and wait but it is the best ramen place in town. The appetizers are always different and unique. I enjoy the broth for the Ramen, and the spice factor is always on point."}
{"text":"We were look for great ramen off the strip and found this little jewel. I am so happy that we went exploring. I had the spicy chicken ramen. I added ground chicken and pork, mushrooms, and bamboo. It was amazing! The seaweed salad was on par with others, nothing to set it over the top, but it was good. The staff was friendly and attentive and very helpful with any questions that we had about their menu. It is a place I will return to."}
{"text":"Hands-down the best for him have had in town. I love that you could add a ton of veggies/more broth. The wait was long but that's understandable because the place was so amazing. The Ramen was delicious,  I love the flavor of the soup, and great spices you can add to it as well."}
{"text":"The Jinyu chicken ramen was delish! Just enough flavor.   But Let's be real... We all come to eat here as an excuse to use their bidet toilet."}
{"text":"I think this is a bit on the overrated side. The noodles we had were really firm, and personally, I didnt enjoy firm noodles. I almost want to say it tasted a bit undercooked. Price wise, its really expensive. $15 for a cha cha cha ramen? Hmm, I might just save my money and spend it somewhere else.."}
{"text":"The food was well prepared, ingredients were arranged in an artsy matter . It was delicious !"}
{"text":"The Ramen was okay. They were out of alot of stuff. Especially thin noodles and pork buns. When I got my order which was #2 cha cha cha for garlic lovers on the menu. I received my noodles luke warm."}
{"text":"I went to Jinya last night for the first time and I have to say that I was pleased with my experience. We arrived a Saturday night a 8pm with 4 people and it took about 20 minutes to get a seat. Once we ordered it took another 20 minutes for the food to arrive.   I started with the Takoyaki - octopus balls - and it was a nice dish with way more balls than some other ramen places I've been to ( I'm looking at you, Sansotei). They were hot, they were flavorful. Great start.   I then had the tonkutsu ramen. The broth was nice and thick and tasty. The noodles were cooked right but I wish they would have been more thick. The pork was good too but only 2 slices weren't enough. The ramen was hot but it could have been warmer.   They are good but they could improve by making the kitchen work more efficiently and really focusing on their ramen."}
{"text":"This review is long overdue but this is my favorite ramen bar in Vegas.  It's a bit lacking in Nevada but this place makes up for It because they sell black garlic ramen. Mmmm, my favorite.  Anyways, it's always always ALWAYS packed here.  I came during the day, late at night, and late late night and no matter what time, it's busy.  It's a good sign!  Parking could be a little tough but I've always found one near by.  It's located in a plaza so there's more parking in the other areas.    As you walk in, there's always a crowd waiting near the entrance which sucks because they're always in the way.  They need to have a waiting area tbh.  So there's a host stand right by the door and you put your name.  The times I've went, the wait is usually around 30 minutes to even an hour or two.  I don't mind.  They usually ask if you want a booth or if you don't mind, they shared table.  It's a large table where they sit everyone at.  I don't mind so I'm seated faster.    They do offer happy hour items.  I always get the chicken.  I also only order the black garlic style ramen with thin noodles.  You could always opt out for thick but It does depend on the ramen.  You could also do combos for I believe $3-$5 for curry and a salad, etc.  they also have toppings to add into your ramen for cheap!! I also like that they offer fresh garlic that you could mince into your ramen or sauce, or whatever you want.  They even offer vegetarian options!!! If you still have soup leftover, you could get a refill of noodles for $1!!!   The prices are decent and I think they are fair for the quantity and quality.  I enjoy this place a lot! I will be returning here.  If you want to try this place, I suggest getting there a bit early and distract yourself while waiting."}
{"text":"Over priced. Service is mediocre. Ordered 3 appetizer and 2 bowls of ramen and was not impressed. Can't say I'll come again but 3/5 is being generous."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I go all the time to Jinya. Best ramen in town! Great environment, music, layout, flavor. MUST GO HERE FOR GREAT RAMEN!"}
{"text":"Ramen place is pretty good. Luckily walked in and it wasn't that busy. So got a seat pretty much right away. I came here to see if there is a different from the Houston and Vancouver BC location. Overall, pretty similar. I got a seat at the long table. Definitely can get cozy and meet some new friends. So, I ordered the Chicken karaage ramen (Chef special). It was pretty pricy for a bowl of ramen if I were to compare it to Vancouver BC price. But overall not bad. It came with three big pieces of chicken karaage. Broth very thick and flavorful. Will definitely fill you up if you drink all the soup. But I think I prefer the Sprouting up ramen over the chicken karaage ramen.   Décor is quite nice and I do like it. Located in a trendy location in Mission."}
{"text":"I've come to Jinya several times in the last year or so and 9/10 times it's excellent, however I was brought here on my birthday earlier this month and my nephew of 4 years old had gotten a stomach flu from the chicken in the kids meal. It was really devastating cause it was my sister and her family's first time here and her son and husband (who was feeding him and breaking apart chicken pieces) were sick for days and struggling to hold down food for about a week after. We came here on the evening of January 4th and it wasn't till just a few days ago they recovered from it. All I ask is more caution or cleanliness is exercised especially in the kids meal because my nephew couldn't understand what was wrong with him and why that was happening."}
{"text":"The creamy vegan ramen is beautiful, the noodles are wonderful, the broth isn't exactly spicy but very flavorful, didn't think I'd be able to enjoy ramen without a pork broth but this was amazing."}
{"text":"Ramen Jinya, I love you but a C rating for health inspection is NOT okay. Also, you should visit your studio city location for quality control as the spicy chicken ramen was watered down and not nearly as flavorful. Server was really nice and decor looks great but step it up!"}
{"text":"My first ramen bar!I chose the chefs special -Tokyo tonkatsu Ramen. It was ok. It has a very fishy flavor since it does include fish powder. LOTS of fish powder  With it being my first ramen joint, I didn't really know what was good. Let's just say I definitely won't be getting that one again lol the gyoza and takoyaki were yummy. Also be prepared to wait. This place is so busy  with such little space. There were people waiting outside because there barely is any waiting room inside. Hopefully they move to a bigger location."}
{"text":"My husband and I always seem to end up eating ramen every time we go on vacation. Considering we're not in Japan, this place was awesome!  The ramen was tasty, very well flavoured.  The appetizers/side dishes were also very delicious (e.g., the pork bun, the crispy chicken, and the gyoza).  I had their anniversary special and I loved it!"}
{"text":"This place is affordable and has big portion meals. I gave 3 stars because the place is too small for the amount of clientele it receives and the service can be better. Our server took so long to come back to take our order, around 20 mins. Then towards the end of the meal we felt as if they were trying to rush us out when weren't done eating."}
{"text":"When we walked into the restaurant the hostess jumped a bit surprised. But in a good way. Like, \"Yes! Visitors!\" Good signs already! She immediately seated us in a table in the corner, half booth half table really.   I was very pleased with the seating arrangement if I do say so myself. The floor plan is open, the place is not big. The walls are lined with booths or tables and in the center there is a large wooden table with seating for a group of about 20.  The lighting is low, so it gives a sense of privacy despite the open room. The music is mostly tasteful indie dance and its just loud enough to drown out the conversation of others but not too loud that you can't hear your own.    Our server was a young girl who explained the menu to us and checked on us at all the appropriate times. We ordered curry rice and the octopus balls which were both AMAZING and I would/will come back for more!   I will be a tad hit of a stickler here and say the ramen was not as aesthetically pleasing as at Monta and I don't truly care for the thicker style ramen noodles but the broth was very good and had a nice full flavor. The service was great and our server was attentive and friendly without being intrusive. Overall a very nice experience. And they're open late!"}
{"text":"The hostess that took our name for seating was very inconsiderate. The white girl with gages told us that she called our name, but she crossed us off the list. This was a very bad experience, I will not be coming back when this girl is working. I wish that I could give no stars for this hostess."}
{"text":"I enjoy a tasty and not too heavy broth, but I felt theirs lacked just that. The noodles were pretty good, but not the best as it didn't taste too fresh. As a whole with everything in my JINYA Tonkotsu Black and in my boyfriend's chicken/pork ramen, I would say it was on a scale 6 out of 10. It was 12:30 and I was sad that they didn't have time the Takoyaki that I keep seeing in reviews as the best anyone has had in Vegas. I will have to come back to try that. The potstickers were okay and I wish they were crispier. It tasted like the ones I boil at home and had that same boring texture and tasted like they had a hint of soy sauce. We ordered Brussels Sprouts Tempura, and my boyfriend dislikes Brussels, but really enjoyed these because he could barely taste them. The reading on them were not too thick. The hostess was kind and on it. The table service was okay as he never came to check on us and didn't really explain a couple of the choices too well with my boyfriend (his first time having ramen). We had to flag someone else down for the bill. Great atmosphere (liked he seating situations and the music)."}
{"text":"Came here on a recommendation from a coworker. The broth was very good. A little different than any we have had before. It was creamy compared to broth like. We each had a different ramen and they tasted totally different which was nice. We started with the thick noodles and ordered an extra serving of thin. Comparing the two I liked the thick and my husband preferred the thin noodles.   The staff was great. Our waitress spent time going over the menu with us. Not needed but definitely appreciated.    Would recommend to friends and return."}
{"text":"I must say I never thought I would want ramen so often until I tried Jinya! I used to have the random craving and would go to spring mtn. But I literally find myself wanting Jinya like crazy!! I've gone 2 times in the last week! First off I love the atmosphere it's very warm with the dark woods and they play awesome music that's not on everyday radio.   We started out with iced green tea which was super refreshing and had free refills. Next up the Jinya buns. DO NOT SKIP THE BUNS!! The pork is sooo tender and the sauce is yummy. We tried the premium white tonkotsu and it didn't disappoint. The broth has more flavor then I ever expected. It was lighter in texture even though it appeared very creamy. The noodles were PERFECT in texture. I didn't use any condiments but they do have chili sauce and ramen seasoning on the table.   One thing that I think is SUPER cool is they have a kids meal. This thing contains so much food I was in disbelief. When I saw the menu I had to ask 8 we choose and item, but mope! You get everything listed/pictured! Chicken ramen with corn and spinach, chashu rice bowl with spinach, chicken karrage, fries, orange slice, a lollipop, and their tofu dessert!! All for $7!!  Since my 5 year old can't eat all that we got to try a bunch of stuff. Their karrage was amazing, it is kind of heavy on salt so if you're sensitive pass it up.   Our service was eh, at best. But the food and decent price point out shown the service. I can't wait to go eat Jinya now that I've been thinking about it since I started this review."}
{"text":"They have the best ramen ever! I go here all the time since it's soo close t our apartment area and oh god! The takoyaki is to die for"}
{"text":"I've been visiting this Ramen Shop since they opened at this location at least 1x a week.  I love their Ramen.  Over the course of that time the price has gone up a couple of times, but I've dealt with it as the servers are all friendly, know my order right when I come in, and I'm happy when I finish!    The last menu change and price increase unfortunately has crossed the line for me.  They no longer offer Tonkatsu Assari (#3) in all its glory.  The closest thing to this is now something with brussel sprouts and extra pork.  I don't mind the extra pork and it's probably still a good price for what you get, but the latest price increase brings my regular order to close to 50% more than what it was when they first opened.  I could just change my order to accommodate their new menu, but with so many other Ramen shops around that offer a lower price bowl or Ramen that has everything I want in it (and nothing more that I have to pay for) it's hard to justify staying a regular here.  Makes me a little bit sad since it's SO close to my office and a great lunch option.  I asked the server if they could just keep giving me what I like to order.  They are able to do some substitutions and get it pretty much how I like it but the price remains higher.    Perhaps you can keep Tonkatsu Assari as it used to be as an \"off the menu\" option for regulars like myself.  You'll definitely win back my regular business and Yelp Stars!!!!  I would rate it lower for the menu change, but the food is still quite good so I can't go lower than this."}
{"text":"All I can say is Miso Ramen is a must have. Everytime I go here it's 2am and theres a line. But it goes fast and is well worth the wait."}
{"text":"I liked their Tonkotsu Assari.  It was not too heavy and had good flavor.  The service was great.  The servers were very attentive and nice to my little one too.    The only thing I was disappointed was their kid's meal.  I was excited to see the presentation as shown on the menu but it came out in a ship-shaped plastic dish and the Nuri (paint) was chipped to the point they should just replace it.   Also, the rice was not Japanese rice.  I am very picky about my rice.  I know it is a kid's meal and they are not catering toward them, but it would still be nice if they could also apply the same standard to it."}
{"text":"I love their chicken ramen! There's no other places who serves chicken + ramen, that's why I love this place! Wish they had another location closer to home!"}
{"text":"The food is amaizing! Love it! The food came out fast and the service was great... I will definitely be going back.  The kids meal is so good my so loved the chicken and rice."}
{"text":"Went here during peak lunch hours and waited about 10-15 minutes for table. Overheard customers saying they were waiting long for their food to arrive as we were waiting to be seated.  We were seated at the bar. We ordered the spicy chicken ramen and sprouted ramen--recommendations from a friend who works at a Jinya in San Diego.  As we were waiting for our food we noticed people who were seated after us were getting their food. Our server notified us that they forgot to place our order and said they would get our food out in a minute.  Our food came out shortly after, as our service said! They gave us extra protein in our ramen. After we finished eating they gave us green tea mochi ice cream on the house!  Over all, the food was excellent and they handled their mistake for their service very well!"}
{"text":"Good ramen but a tad on the small size. Broth was delicious and the pork was cooked perfectly. Nothing to complain about. Not sure about appetizers as I only ordered ramen."}
{"text":"Yes, this place is open late. Is hip but is it really worth it? If you asked me this question 3 years ago, I would say definitely yes but over the past couple of years...this place has gone way down in quality and service. Yes, you can customize your order but is it really customized to your liking if they get it wrong? ALL THE TIME!! Let's not even talk about the wait time. I can never understand why even when there's plenty of space available, they don't seat the guests littering the tiny area by the entrance and the hallway to the bathroom--blocking guests from escaping should there be a fire or an \"emergency\" type incident? Is that even ok fire code wise??? Well, I suppose you can answer the \"seating\" question by watching the kitchen staff flounder their way around the kitchen. OMG so disorganized! No wonder they have to filter people from coming in and being served?! FAIL! You order a kid's meal and it comes out 20 minutes after the adult's meal. Hmmm...who should we serve first? Kids or adults?! And then get the kids order wrong?! Seriously?! For those of you non-parents reading this, this might sound petty but parents reading this will understand why this situation is a MAJOR SUCK!  AVOID!  As good as this place is, it's not worth the aggravation.  How hard is it to pick the right noodles to put in the bowl, thick or thin? They're spelled differently! If you can't differentiate, then don't make it an option! Good Grief! I literally have not had a visit (over the past 3 years) where they simply just got the orders right ...and we don't even customize our orders much! All we do is add toppings! LOL - crying inside! Sad to say this but I'm afraid this is my final visit to this place...I am so disappointed that I am actually writing my first Yelp review. Congrats guys!"}
{"text":"Amazing place.  The ambiance, the service, and the food were top notch!  My cousin recommended this place and from the moment we entered to the time we left, we were well taken care of.  Upon arrival, we were seated immediately and I took notice of the lay out of the restaurant and it was very feng shui.  It flowed nicely and was decorated nicely.  Very clean, very modern with a traditional feel with the wooden tables.  It was dimly lit and there was some low music playing.  Seems like a great hang out spot for 20-somethings or even a place to take a date and have a great intimate conversation with.  As for the food, my aunt was a gracious host since we were coming from out of town and I was happy to order and test out plenty of the menu.  I ordered the vegan ramen, edamame, and mochi ice cream.  As for the rest of my group, they ordered the ramen with the different types of meat in it and also the shrimp ball appetizers.   Everyone was blown away with the presentation as well as the taste.  Apparently the ramen sauce was also spectacular although I didn't try it as I felt my bowl was perfect the way it was.  The service was also fantastic with our waitress Kate.  She was very knowledgable, friendly, and attentive to all our needs.  It didn't hurt that she was also easy on the eyes as agreed upon by my group.  In any case, the pricing was extremely fair and reasonable and made it great value for our money.    I highly recommend coming to check this place out!"}
{"text":"Good food and nice atmosphere. Service was a bit lacking. There was a line when we got there, so we just added our names to the list on the clipboard. Not a lot of waiting space so we waited outside in the parking lot. When they called our name they put the five of us in a booth with one on a stool. It worked well enough. There seemed to be space available at the big table where they could have been seating more people, but often there were empty seats, tables while people still waited. We ordered our drinks and we had two people order water and beer. Beer came, no water. Asked again. Nothing. Asked again. Nope. Asked a fourth time and got one water, out of the two we asked for.  And by this time we had ordered dinner and had our food. Also, FYI they have soda, but it is in a can. When we ordered our food they made a point of reminding everyone that ordered that they were out of thick noodles, so they would all be thin. Fine with us and there had been a handwritten sign on the door saying this. But I ordered one of the bowls or ramen only to be told they didn't have that. Sucked because that ramen was the reason I wanted to go here. I ordered something else and we were fine. First bowl shows up. A minute later two more. Another minute and bowl four shows up. We wait... and wait. Probably five plus more minutes and the last bowl shows up (also when the first glass of water showed up). I don't know if the vegetarian ramen takes longer or what, but that is the bowl that was last. Everyone said there food was really good. I liked mine and my husband's was tasty too. When the check comes we all throw down twenties. We give the waiter twenty-two bucks over the bill and ask for change. He comes back with two ones and two tens. I wanted to tip around fifteen, but since that's the change we got, we put down twelve. Most waiters give you an assortment of bills when you get change. Oh well. A good place and I would go back, but not expect the best service. Not sure how much is language barrier or how much is they were just busy."}
{"text":"Simply the best food. Love the portians . Had the pork belly mini sandwhich, yum also the curry and lobster roll. Nice place to try a little bit of everything. Great service, friendly vibe and killer music selection. Yep, I'll be back..."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, great Raman! Would give 5 stars but service a little off, hit and miss , but hip atmosphere! As a Vegas local love me sum ramen!"}
{"text":"Jinya is usually my go-to for ramen, but after this last experience, I probably won't want to go back for a while. The food was great as always, but this was the first time I've received bad service. The server got the orders right; however, she was very inattentive and very blunt when talking to the table. My friend and I finished our drinks halfway through our meal, but our server never came around to ask if we wanted refills (and we did). We asked for utensils as well, and didn't receive them for about ten minutes afterwards. We also waited about a half hour after we were done with our meal to get her attention for our check, and in that time she talked to every table around us without noticing  us. We had tried to get her attention several times and also made eye contact with her, but nothing. I've never had a bad experience here, and I love jinya...I still love the food but the service was very upsetting."}
{"text":"This place has incredible food and serves it really quickly. Wonderful ambience in the restaurant and if you order delivery through postmates it always travels really well."}
{"text":"Tonight was pretty busy at Jinya but our server Rachel was freakin awesome! I was never a big fan of ramen but she suggested the spicy miso and i loved every spoonful. What topped it off was that it was happy hour too. Rachel always kept our waters topped off and made sure we had everything we needed even though the place was super busy. I'll definitely come back for the food and the great service she gave my group!"}
{"text":"Monta Ramen vs. Jinya Ramen? Monta hands down every time!   I really hate to knock a good thing but in my experience, this is more hype from the Billboards than reality. I've lived in Japan and eaten enough ramen there (and in the US) to experience what good ramen is.  Maybe it's just this location b/c I've been to Robata Jinya in LA for Ramen and it was good.  What this Jinya does have going for it is menu variety but it's a double edged sword as execution can be inconsistent when you try to do too many things at once. On that note, execution was lacking in both front of house with seating and service and back of house with food quality.  Seems that the restaurant is run by young kids just winging it as a first job or part time job. Service and attention to detail is lacking. Dirty tables were bussed in \"batches\" rather than individually and thus people were waiting looking at each other with confused looks. Nobody asked or checked up on us. Restaurants thrive on turnover but is obviously not a metric that these employees are aware of.  Ordered the Sprouting Up Ramen and the Cha Cha Cha (both which are \"Jinya Recommended\" items).  I know Jinya serves fusion ramen but there shouldn't be fat chunks floating in your ramen... The only fusion with fat chunks is how it fuses to my belly, which can't be good.  Extra noodles which were ordered never came and had to ask 2 times for them. Finally arrived and fortunately portions were large but my soup was already cold...  Jinya should have their employees visit Japan to understand what attention to detail, pride and service. Or better yet, just visit Monta Ramen."}
{"text":"I finally have decided to stop in here after driving past it nearly everyday. The interior looked much nicer than I expected before I entered the restaurant. There is a small ramen bar in front of the kitchen and a small Japanese themed dining area. The staff were all very friendly and the restaurant appeared to be very clean.  The food and the service was better than average. I would definitely recommend giving this place a go.  Takoyaki - this was excellent. If you like the Japanese dish Okino Miyaki then you will like this dish. It is basically the same ingredients and then it is shaped in to bite size portions.  Crispy Rice with spicy tuna - this is just what it says it is. It was good.  Crispy Chicken with ponzu sauce - This would have been a good choice if the chicken would not have been so greasy. I think the oil in the fryer needed to be changed or they dropped the chicken back in the fryer after it was cooked.  Spicy chicken ramen noodle - the ramen was excellent. I ordered it \"Hot\". It had a lot of heat to it, but not so much heat that you could not enjoy it. I may just go with \"Spicy\" next time though."}
{"text":"Fantastic.  Had the spicy chicken medium, and couldn't stop myself from finishing the entire bowl."}
{"text":"Saw the reviews of this place and waited 30 minutes to sit and man was this a disappointment! We ordered gyoza and takoyaki which both came out slow and cold.   The server didnt apologize and our ramen came out after 30 minutes. She also forgot our egg with the order with no apology.   Out of the 3 ramen places we chose this place and the service was garbage with no manager on staff. I would never recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"I wasn't expecting to like it as much as I did, the house dressing on the salad was amazing. You also get a portion that matches the price, which is not something you see often. It was all really tasty and I'm glad I went on a whim."}
{"text":"Not the best in a very heated Ramen market in this town. Great restaurant, I like the location and the food was good but somehow the service is just really bad and they can't get your order correct.  It starts off that there are 2 different servers that come to take care of you.  \"Can I take your drink order?\", \"...well actually someone already came and we ordered tea\".  \"Is everything okay with your food?\".  \"...well actually his soup came and it was stone cold so we sent it back but the other server took it...\"  We ordered two bowls of Ramen, My friend is diabetic so he askes for only half the noodles and pays for extra eggs. Soup comes cold, full noodles, no eggs. Looks of confusion when we ask to have the correct order sent out. They take the soup back, comes back hot, still too many noodles, still not eggs. Later server number 2 comes around to ask if we want more noodles (my friend has piled his extra noodles on his side plate next to his soup to manually remove them).  Anyway, hopefully they can work our the supply chain issues and turn the ship around."}
{"text":"For the longest time I couldn't decide if I like Jinya more than Monta, but yeah-- I personally think it's better because there are more options.  I know some say Monta has the best broth which I personally think Jinya and Monta are pretty close in that category, but my tie breaker is the fresh garlic and theeeeeee best takoyaki at Jinya.  Not only that the service is great every time I visit too! But going back to the food, the noodles are perfectly cooked. The loaded takoyakis are a mountain of flavor--Probably the best I've had in Vegas."}
{"text":"Probably the most hip ramen bar I've been to. The staff were friendly. Ordered a JINYA bun and it was worth the $4. However, the ramen was pretty mediocre. I've had better ramen at Walmart for 99cents. Would definitely come back for the JINYA bun though."}
{"text":"Okay, it wasn't the worst. But it wasn't Monta - you know?   Atmosphere is cool. Hip-ish. Servers were nice. Just the food - eh? It was missing something. I dunno. It grew on me about halfway through the bowl but I was also starving. I had the chicken ramen with thick noodles. It was almost as if they were under cooked? Like chewy. Not at all like the perfect consistency of a usual ramen noodle.   The chicken ramen tasted like thin gravy! That's what it was. Also kinda smelled like thanksgiving? But honestly it wasn't that bad. I didn't hate it."}
{"text":"This place is great! They have a great lunch special and the best takoyaki in town! And the crazy thing is they have a drive-thru window!"}
{"text":"Definitely a great ramen bar phenomenal experience and vegan options. Outside of vegan the takoyaki is to  good."}
{"text":"I had Jinya Bun, Spicy chicken Ramen and panna cotta for dessert. They were delicious!  I always drove by this place before and my first time here. I think I found  new spot.. Service was great too. I will definitely comeback"}
{"text":"The service is pretty average but the food is very good. I'm usually not a big fan of ramen, but if i'm ever grabbing some, this will be the place. The atmosphere and decor is awesome. This is a good place to come with friends as they have a biiiig center table. The food comes out really fast, so you can pretty much come in and go in 30 minutes. We tried the Tokyo curry which was amazing! It does not have any meat, but the flavors are there!  Ladies, you have to check out their restroom.. They have a pretty cool smart toilet! Must try! Overall, a good restaurant to try if you are craving typical ramen food."}
{"text":"Woke up at 1am suffering Jet Lag from a 16 hour flight back home. Thank You JINYA for being open till Three In the Morning! This place ROCKS.  They have so many options!  Raman for any Taste, Vegan or Vegetarian! Totally satisfide our late night jet lag hang over."}
{"text":"Drove here specifically for vegan ramen that is on their menu. My friend and I were so excited to sit down and enjoy, we ordered, and the server explained that they don't have the vegan option \"yet\" and that its \"coming soon\" even though it's on the menu with a price. I had to modify my order severely and was really disappointed in the false advertising. Say coming soon on the menu or take it off. I would hate for someone else to be as disappointed as I was. Service was fine and food was okay."}
{"text":"This is a very nice ramen bar. There is plenty of seating and the atmosphere is great. The pork is a little fatty but it still tasted great. I can't wait to try more flavors."}
{"text":"Let me preface this by saying I am a true ramen snob. I visit my parents who live in japan regularly so I am prone to judge Japanese food pretty harshly.  Food:  The broth at Jinya is great. I ordered the Chicken ramen, which is essentially a hearty shio ramen which is exactly what I was hoping for. I also tried the soup from the Tokyo Tonkotsu Ramen, which had a strong flavor of katsuobushi (dried skipjack tuna) which made for a really nice, light taste for pork broth.   My gripe comes from the obvious lack of attention to the smaller details in creating the bowl which really took away from the great broth. The ramen itself came out lukewarm. The noodles and spinach were not drained properly which resulted in diluted soup. The noodles should have been slightly more al dente (although this is probably a preference thing).   The gyozas were good. The takoyaki came out cold in the middle.   Overall Jinya has all the flavors for a great ramen place. With just a few minor tweaks in details I think it could be SO much better."}
{"text":"My first time having real Ramen. The \"sprouting up Ramen\" it was great. Seating service was horrible tho"}
{"text":"The front desk girl has no manner! We were party of 4, all waiting inside and she made a mistake allowing other people taking our spot! She did not apologize, just made an excuse saying our party is not all here!(which was a lie, we were all standing in front of her) it was not a big deal but her attitude was ridiculous"}
{"text":"JINYA is perfectly alright, but not better than a lot of other places in town.  For me, I think it will be a \"change of pace\" kinda place.  Their flavors are a bit unusual and they offer a wide selection of optional toppings.  The location is more convenient to me than most other ramen joints.  The customer service was fine.  They are a little expensive considering the bowl leans small (they look big, but the ceramic material is just really thick and tall), and the toppings are a little stingy in portion (probably because the bowl is small).  Ramen prices in Vegas seem to be creeping up in general.  It was also odd that the \"thick\" noodle ramen (what I would call normal) in my husband's bowl was super small portion, while my thin noodles (the thinnest I've ever seen in ramen) were pretty generous.  I ordered tofu as a topping and it was cold, not cooked, and cooled down the ramen faster.  But it was an entire brick worth of tofu.  The fried onions are quite tasty and I enjoyed the chicken char-siu, still kinda rare.  The spicy is really not spicy (like maybe 1.5 on a scale of 5) - it did make the ramen more flavorful but also more salty, I think.  JINYA ramen was definitely saltier than average.  I think I'll try the basic chicken ramen next time and see if it's less salty.  This was enough to make me feel a bit sick soon after."}
{"text":"This was my first restaurant ramen experience and it was fantastic. Jimya looks very small from the outside, but it is roomier than it looks once you're inside. I went with a group of 7 for a work lunch right at noon and the service was quick and correct! I ordered the spicy chicken and added a poached egg and was not at all disappointed. I had to ask the server what Tokyo Negri was (listed with the ingredients) and I learned a new fact of the day - Tokyo Negri is a Japanese onion. You can order the ramen as mild, spicy, or HOT. Spicy was pretty darn spicy, so I can only imagine that hot was high up on the spicy scale.  Our table was in and out of there in about 45 minutes tops and all of us thought our food was delicious. I will definitely add this restaurant into the lunch rotation going forward."}
{"text":"I'm only rating 3 because it wasn't an experience that blew me away. Service was slow. We didn't have to wait long for a table but when we finally got one, we almost decided to leave before someone came to take our order. Food portions were generous, but again, was just ok. I'd probably check out another Ramen place before I go back again."}
{"text":"This place was unexpectedly really good!  You would never have guessed if you are a tourist driving by and glanced over to see Jinya.  It's in a VERY non-descript strip mall with nothing else around to make you look twice.  But trust me, stop in and have some Ramen.  I've turned into quite the Ramen addict in the last two years and although I hate to admit it, I've acquired a taste for hipster Ramen vs traditional.  Although you won't catch me kicking any Ramen bowls out of my bed...  So back to the point of my taste in Ramen.  There is a place in San Diego that I LOVE called Underbelly.  Some people haven't been quite won over yet, but that does seem to be the place I use to compare all others.  Well except for the place in Paris, which will be my ALL TIME favorite.   There is a very good flavor to the broth, you can choose thick or thin noodles and you can add \"toppings\".  All of which is very important to me.  The price is very reasonable and the serving size is filling.  They also a happy hour so it's a win win in my book!"}
{"text":"Forever will love there ramen!! Phenomenal customer service and they work at a fast pace so your food comes out pretty fast. Upbeat music and it's a cute little spot :)"}
{"text":"Was excited to try this spot out as soon as it opened after seeing the menu for their different locations.   The service was fantastic! Everyone was friendly and we had two people check in with us after we got our food. The waitress was patient and explained the menu to us and answered our questions which. The only thing we didn't enjoy was the noise level at the restaurant. It was hard to hold conversation and we were periodically startled by the random Japanese shouts which as classic to ramen joints.   LOVED that they had two vegetarian options which were very distinct from each other. There was a creamy vegan broth with a thick noodle which was very rich and paired well with the silken tofu topping and thick and chewy ramen noodle. The second option was a vegetarian broth that was lighter and much more savoury topped with a tonne of vegetables and a lighter noodle. Both were spectacular though the creamy vegan broth was definitely more filling.   The food was fantastic, the ambience trendy and fun though slightly loud and the service was perfection. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"For a regional chain, this place is a pretty good spot for some good ramen and appetizers!  We had a good group so got to try quite a bit of appetizers:  Gyoza - Pretty good, it's pork and veggies and pan fried.  Not a big fan when they someone does deep fried gyoza.  Tempura Brussel Sprouts - Didn't care much for it, a lot of batter and pretty bland for my taste.  Fried Chicken - Big pieces of their version of chicken karage.  Very tasty and seasoned very well.  Fresh Tofu - This was a pleasant surprise, if you have some time and like tofu give this dish a try.  They actually make fresh tofu for you at the table.  Note, this is plain tofu and you have to add the ginger, scallions, fish flake, and soy sauce that they bring on the side.  It takes some time for it to form, if you're not sure when it's ready they should be able to tell you.  Black Ramen - The soup base was pretty good, not a fan of the thin noodles though.  Spicy Chicken Ramen - This was really good and I asked for the thick noodles instead of the thin.  The noodles were chewy and the soup base was yummy.  The service was good.  It does get really busy here, so plan to wait a bit and make sure your whole party is here or they won't seat you."}
{"text":"ohhhh my gosh the spicy vegan ramen! best ramen i've had in the city, lots of toppings available to add on, i was 100% satisfied. they are usually very busy but i've never had an issue with the service, very prompt wait staff. also they have a cauliflower appetizer and it is incredible as well. keep up the great work to any staff reading this!"}
{"text":"This place really has everything going for it. The atmosphere and music are on point. And the food keeps me coming back.   YOU MUST TRY THE JINYA BUN!! you'll thank me later.  The portions will get you full and are tasty.  The sushi is actually surprisingly good!  The lyceetini is something I would definitely drink again. I actually wish this place had more drink options."}
{"text":"So we came here because we have heard good things about this place.  We were able to arrive right before a huge rush and there was no wait.  The host was very unfriendly and even though there was no one in line or waiting and tables were open he still had us stand there in front of him for 10 mins before finally acknowledging us.  We were seated on a dirty table which i used my napkin to wipe off the seat.  The server was actually pretty nice.  We told him it was our first time and he seemed happy to explain the menu to us.  After we placed our orders the food came out pretty quick.  Thats where the problem started.  My order was wrong.  So i asked the server if i could send it back.  He said no problem.  When i finally got my order back it was wrong again.  I received what i ordered but now everything extra i ordered like an egg and garlic were not in the bowl.  So i had to call the server over again and ask if i could get the extras i ordered (since i was paying for them anyways) and he was annoyed now and went to the cooks to get it.  He brought back an egg but nothing else.  I didn't feel like requesting the rest of my items even though i was being charged for them.  I did ask for the server one more time which now took forever since he was avoiding me.   When he finally came back to our table i asked if we could have a spoon since we were the only table without any and we wanted it for our soup.  He said ok and walked away.  He never came back with our spoons.  We were over this place and wanted our bill which took another 20 mins for the server to come back with our bill.  I gave it a 2 star instead of 1 because the soup was pretty decent.  It would have been better to try the soup if it would have had all the extra ingredients i ordered. I think for now on i'm just going to stick to my usual place ramen sora."}
{"text":"We came in at lunch time and was able to quickly be sat. The waitress knew it was my first time and she gave us the run down on the menu with some great suggestions on what to try. The food was very good, noodles were awesome. Location is very convenient, with ample parking. Very clean atmosphere"}
{"text":"The worst hostesses, poor system, slow service - they have everything you don't want here. I waited an hr for 4 people which could have been cut by 15 minutes if the 2 hostesses know how to work together. They didn't even know they had the same shift and were discussing it for good ten minutes and take another 10 to delegate duties while there were bunch of empty tables ready. One of the hostess just stood around looking lost. Once seated, the party after us somehow got their food before us. I also noticed that there were a lot of tables empty that were not cleaned when they could have cleaned and seated all the angry customers waiting. I got the sprouted ramen which was alright, there were shit ton of sprouts. The broth was alright in the salty thick side. Not the best ramen I have had and not the worst. I don't think I would come back here, I will spend that hr wait time at Monta ramen instead.  Overall Taste 3/5 Service 1/5 Price 3/5 not that worth for me Parking 3/5 plenty in the lot"}
{"text":"No 1 is delicious, I'd go with that any day.  Once in a while a variation on the mood, try No 3  This is my favorite Vegas ramen spot, hands down!"}
{"text":"I ate here before I saw that they were featured in dirty dining. I forgot exactly why they were featured in it but I think they were written up for not storing food properly (temperature wise). I was reluctant to come back since... I don't wanna get food poisoning.   Buuuuut. I came back and it was still delicious! I think I just psyched myself out but their food is great. I always order the spicy chicken ramen (or something like that) with egg.   The service was good too. The servers were nice and attentive. The overall atmosphere was nice but the size of the space is really small."}
{"text":"Love it here ! Amazing ramen and quick, friendly service ! I always leave satisfied . I usually get the vegetarian ramen with California roll . Wonderful. I've been needing to come back soon . I need my Jinya ramen fix ! :) thanks you guys"}
{"text":"Best ramen in Vegas!!!  This is my go to place when I'm craving ramen (which is pretty often!). I normally order take out but have dined in more than a few times. Everything I've ordered has been tasty but here are some stand outs:   - Spicy creamy vegan ramen: regardless of whether or not you eat meat, this is a MUST try. The broth is very savory and perfectly compliments the thick delicious noodles. Add a seasoned egg for a little extra creaminess and flavor   - spicy chicken ramen: perfect soup for a cold day or if you're under the weather. The broth is a little thicker than a traditional chicken soup with big pieces of tender chicken chasu and thin noodles.  - tonkotsu black: a more traditional style of ramen with pork, seasoned egg and other veggies in a flavorful, umami broth.   - Jinya buns- tender pork bao buns  - takoyaki: these octopus balls are flavorful and addictive. 1 order is perfect for two to share. ;-)  Tips:  - This is a popular spot and a pretty intimate dining area. That being said, coming during off peak hours or ordering take out during peak times are you're best bet. -  Order extra broth... it's really good!  - Just because a soup has the word spicy in its name, they will prepare it mild unless you indicate your preferred spice level. If you're not sure, ask for the hot sauce on the side so you can adjust it to your own taste."}
{"text":"Unprofessional poor customer service. All these young generation that works here has lack of ability in delivering great customer service. In other words, they need to be more trained. One of the servers looks like she was on drugs. When we we're talking to her she literally just answer us 'what's up' like 5 times. Food was alright.. I still prefer to go to other places specially if I wanna get better service"}
{"text":"Ramen in this cold weather is the way to go. Took my bf here for his first bowl of ramen and he loved it. And of course, gotta have takoyaki."}
{"text":"We ordered three different kinds of ramen. The thick noodles did not cook thoroughly which makes them a bit tough to chew on... but the thin noodle i got was quite perfectly cooked with crunchy tenderness in each bite... But overall soup based could be better if it isn't so thick and creamy... is like we are eating thick cream of sauce mixed with ramen... Price at the higher side which priced the same as new york city but considering the rent is incomparable to ny...  Overall great atmosphere, modern design, and nice feels of big city restaurant. Pro on foods: thin noodles cooked perfectly with nice tender bites... friend ordered a pork chausau rice bowl was quite delicious, and nice sauce combination. Con on foods: soup based just way too thick and creamy which i have been to more than 10 ramen shops and Jinya gotta be the creamiest of them all... flavor wise was just okay due to the richness is getting destroyed by the thickness of the soup based.. Thick noodles did not cook thoroughly which is still raw and tough...  prices are too expensive for the portion and quality  Will visit again but wont be anytime soon..."}
{"text":"The service was top notch and find ramen was good. I'm a ramen snob, I've had the best of the best all around Japan. From Tokyo to Hiroshima and all the small towns along the way. So, I guess I have a certain flavor that I'm looking for.   First off the waitress was sweet as can be and very attentive. If we were ever wanting anything, I'd simply have to look up at my food and smile and she'd be there. Got to love good service. We went for a late lunch so there was no line and about 5 tables inside. Perfect time because apparently they have a waitlist at night.   The Gyoza tasted like my mom's home cooking. Yum! The fried chicken was very flavorful but a bit too chewy for my fiancé's liking. They use dark meat but you can tell the fat wasn't trimmed much. The tonkotsu assari ramen had good flavor, the egg was cooked perfectly, loved the bean sprouts and I added some bamboo. The noodles were a little overcooked though and though the serving size was perfect for me because I don't eat too much, it was a smaller portion than what I would expect for ramen. If you're hungry, I'd recommend ordering extra noodles and broth.   Overall a solid 4 out of 5 stars. Now to go try the other ramen restaurants in sin city and find my favorite!"}
{"text":"I finally found my Japanese food that was actually great.. curry/rice was fantastic along with the gyoza and of course the company was fantastic. I would most defiantly visit again"}
{"text":"ALL THE HYPE for this place. Had one of the best bowls of ramen in Toronto (spicy pork) - the broth is to die for. Standard pricing.  I was floored by the takoyaki (however ya spell it) - 8 large pieces with HUGE AF chunks of octopus meat. It came in a bed of yellow potato salad?? Totally forgot what it was but it was de.lish   Mochi ice cream takes the night. $3.50 for 2 with your typical aZn flavors of mango, green tea, sesame and red bean. Had to order 2nd rounds.!"}
{"text":"I went for happy hour. The happy hour specials were very good. I got the crispy chicken which was very good. I also got a pork filled bun which was ok but nothing special. I then finished my meal with a Ramon. The noodle used in the Ramon was not very good. The noodles were slightly undercooked and not that satisfying. When you go for a Ramon you expect to have a good noodle in the bowl. On the good side the flavor of the broth was very good and the egg was cooked perfectly. I'll give this place another try."}
{"text":"PLEASE UPDATE YOUR TIME ON YELP!.. Drove across town at 2:20.am thinking that we can eat because it says on yelp that you guys close at 3am.  Arrived at 2:28ish ashley said that the kitchen is already closed. So what happened to closing at 3am?  Very disappointing and don't hire host with attitudes."}
{"text":"By far the best ramen in town. Got the Tonkotsu spicy with an egg  and it was absolutely amazing. Service was good as well and the food came pretty fast. Great place."}
{"text":"JINYA BUN!!!! Ramen is exceptional and its been consistent every time.  Service is attentive and spot on every time. Definitely my favorite ramen in Las Vegas and I'm a ramen addict.  I hear Katana-ya from San Francisco is coming to a Strip location so it's good to see quality ramen is here in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"I stopped in here a couple weeks ago but never left a review. This place has amazing service, idk the servers name but she was very knowledgable and helped me out when ordering(it was my first time at a ramen bar). They were extremely busy but we never felt rushed at any point in our meal, and they also made sure we had everything we needed.   Food was phenomenal! I did the spicy chicken ramen, with Added Bok choy, spicy ground chicken, and egg. It was amazing. My taste buds thanked me that night. Definitely a do again!"}
{"text":"My favorite ramen bar. It's close to my house, it's open late, the food is ALWAYS good and the service is polite. Spicy chicken ramen is my go to, make sure to add a seasoned egg!"}
{"text":"Loved Jinya Ramen the first time I went! It's always nice when I can go somewhere as a vegan and my non-vegan friends still enjoy the food. The spicy creamy vegan ramen is unreal.. I recommend everyone try it, even if you're typically a meat eater.  Giving 3 stars instead of five because it being available is very inconsistent. I've gone two times since to find they didn't have it available. Kind of sucks having to leave because there's no other ramen for me to enjoy when that one isn't there."}
{"text":"I've been here twice before & both time's were meh for me. I think mainly it was the wait. The ramen was delicious but I do prefer Sora over Jinya. The place as most ramen shops are in vegas was a bit small. I did like the ambiance of the place and the inside was very appealing. A LOT of the appetizers that my friends and I wanted to order were actually out of stock during the times we went which was very disappointing. Their ramen either comes with thin noodles or thick noodles and every single time I go there I always seem to forget this. I ordered one of their specials in the Black bowl and it came with thin noodles. It was really good but my noodles even in the broth kept sticking together. I'm glad that this place stays open really late because I usually crave ramen late into the night!"}
{"text":"I stopped by this Decatur/Flamingo eatery one time my teen was craving a \"vegetarian ramen dish.\" Well, I was quite surprised to the taste of their JINYA Tonkotsu Black ramen. It was delicious!! If you don't want the lines of Monta, I definitely recommend this eatery. It met my standards and I give it a 5!!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday afternoon. No wait to be seated and quick service! Been to a several ramen spots in Vegas over the past few years and have to say that JINYA tops the list. Glad to have found my new go-to spot."}
{"text":"I used to like Jinya more than Monta when I first discovered Jinya, but I feel like since they get more guests coming in, their food quality has gone down. The last time I had their ramen, I didn't enjoy it at all. The broth was fine, but the noodles were hard, the egg was cold... It wasn't so crowded before, but it's getting more and more crowded. The lychee sake is the best. The music is too loud for my taste. During the meal, I either just stay silent because it's too loud and I'm tired of talking over the music, or I have to yell at my friends so they can hear me. I don't like some tables because they're so close to each other. I don't want them to hear our talk, and I don't want to hear what they're talking about either. Now I only go back to Monta if I want ramen, even if their seats are literally next to each other, but good ramen and better price made up for it. Their restrooms are pretty nice though, I was super impressed lol but I'm not going there for their restrooms."}
{"text":"Food is pretty good. I've been to this restaurant a couple of times. But unfortunately the last time I was there, I found a hair in my noodles. The hair wasn't even on top of the soup floating, it was intertwined with the rest of the noodles. I'm not one to complain so I thought about just quickly removing the hair, but the hair was really stuck in there and as I pulled the hair, noodles came too.  My friend told a server about the hair and they offered me a new bowl. But to be honest, I couldn't even eat it because I was so grossed out. I'll never be back.  The food here is actually pretty good, but this experience has put me off noodles altogether."}
{"text":"For a long time now, my favorite ramen variety has been miso.  I enjoy a hearty broth, and most tonkotsu broths don't deliver.  Jinya makes a mean tonkotsu broth though, and it's been consistent enough that I don't mind skipping my usual ramen spot.  I'm not settling when I come to Jinya, I'm simply going with a different alternative.  When ordering a bowl of ramen, you also have an option of turning it into a combo meal.  Not the french fry and Coke variety, but the ramen and gyoza variety.  Or ramen and karaage.  Ramen and chicken chashu?  Ramen and pork chashu.  If you have an appetite for more than just soup, you can add on a salad and side dish of your choice for only $4 or $5 extra.  Outside of their delicious tonkotsu broth and combo meals, the other big reason I enjoy coming here isn't even food related; it's the fact that they have a bar!  I dine solo quite often, and every time I come here I've been able to grab a seat at the bar without waiting.  Food is consistent, and service is super friendly.  Two things that make it easy for me to be a fan of Jinya."}
{"text":"They're open till 3am  Parking lot is ok, smaller shared parking with other business. If you have a lowered car you'll probably scrape getting into the lot or finding parking.   As I entered the Music was a little loud. It made it hard to hear what the waitress said to us. She did go over the menu since it was our first time here. She went over the menu fast but it as informative.   Seating is ok, there are plenty of booths. All the seats are wooden though, even the ones right at the front near the kitchen. You can see right into the kitchen from any where you sit at. You can see the chefs at work.   Lighting is good, not to bright but low enough to set the mood and theme   The side salad dressing was garlicy. The side of crispy chicken was a good size, 3 pieces as an add on combo  Tonkotsu Asari was good. The broth was light and flavorful. Their noodles were cooked properly. The egg was cooked properly also but had no flavor. This was an overall great experience. The food and service was good but music was to loud would be my only complaint."}
{"text":"despite that it's always busy (because it isn't open 24hrs) we were able to be seated right as we walked in. we got drinks n our orders places within the 10 mins we were seated. i always get the tonkotsu ramen. the option of choosing thick or thin noodles is great, i choose thick. the jinya bun (something a lot of people get) is really delicious. the bun is tasty n soft as well as the chasu."}
{"text":"The best in town. Open late, flavorful broth and good appetizers. Friendly staff and the women's bathroom has the coolest toilet I've ever seen!"}
{"text":"Okay, I didn't have the ramen so cannot speak to it, but what I did have I LOVED. I got a too-big order of \"crispy chicken\" (chicken karaage), a medium order of 10 pieces and it was among the best I've ever had. Lovely tender juicy boneless thigh pieces and a ponzu dipping sauce. Absolutely fantastic. Then I added an order of gyoza. I still think that the best gyoza in town are at Midori (pity the value ratio there has become terrible) but these are pretty damn good.   I will order the karaage every time I go here- I'm already wanting to head back and I was just there about an hour ago!  Service was a tiny bit scattered but friendly. I went at 4:30 and the place was already getting full what with some decent happy hour specials, but I grabbed a seat right away and was in and out in barely 40 minutes. Good music. I liked the entire experience."}
{"text":"Maybe I'm showing my age here but when you walk in and the hostess is dressed like a wannabe gangster with a skull cap pulled down to barely see out of her eyes and is completely tatted including the hands and does not bother to greet you and is dumbfounded by new customers not knowing they're supposed to sign the clip board in front of her that's probably not a good sign. And then we stood there 5 minutes in front of her with no other customers coming in or out and she calls out our name like there were a hundred people standing there waiting to be seated when we're the only two.....? And the music is so loud you feel like you're in a nightclub Phantom Fireworks got a sign on the cash register telling everyone they no longer serve liquor for some obscure reason. I only gave them three stars because the ramen is good by my wife's definition."}
{"text":"One of the best ramen place I've ever been! Hubby & I were loving it!  The flavor of the ramen is very good & tasty. Highly recommended! I can see that lot off people mentions about the lack of availability for the seating. It's a small place. However, I think this place is worth for a wait"}
{"text":"My favorite ramen place! I die for the shrimp balls, I HAVE to get them every time I go. The chicken is also very good. They are usually very busy. The service is kinda of up and down but it's never terrible, it's usually when they are really busy which is I totally understand, but over all a must try!"}
{"text":"Two stars are for the soup, two stars less for poor service and one star less for staffs lack of motivation. This place was packed, we waited either way. Once we sat, it took a while to order. My water had something floating in the bottom, I asked a waiter for Nother water well he dumped the water from the cup and refilled it in the same cup, he didn't even bother to look in the cup upon serving it to me and nothing the floating thing in there was in fact still there. Disgusting. Asked another waiter since ours disappeared and there was never an apology, it almost seemed like it was a burden. The soup was great, but something about this place and the people's lack of providing good customer service is definitely present at this location. As someone working around the area, I'll just have to venture out to another ramen place. Who knows, maybe this place is better as a takeout only."}
{"text":"Best ramen in town! Always go for the spicy one and it never fails. They are always pretty busy but that only tells you how good their food is!"}
{"text":"Had tempura brussel sprouts YUM, tonkatsu with thick noodles (meat is fresh, soup base is good but a little bit too rich and not as fresh as it could be), organic tofu needs a lot more garnish to get me because I am used to agedashi tofu with lots of flavor, and crispy chicken was fair, would've been perfect if it was white meat, dark meat fried is always a bit much for me.  I wish they made real green tea and not just the kind I have at home.  You know what the highlight was...they brought out cute little child bowls, spoons and plates for my son!!  NO ONE has that, not even \"kid-friendly\" places with crayons and coloring place mats! The atmosphere as you read through other Yelpers is cool, music is bumpin and people are enjoying themselves. I have yet to try the buns, spicy ramen and gyoza."}
{"text":"Clean, neat, good food and good servers.  Went there on weekday lunch. It wasn't that much busy and food came out fast. Ramen has distinctive flavor different from other ramen restaurants.  Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Came here with a party of 5 and had to wait for a table 'cause the place was almost packed. Restrooms were clean and actually spacious. Good variety of food options. However, slightly pricey for the amount of some servings. Adding noodle soup costs $2.00 while other places add that for free. Overall, the ramen was good, not salty like the other ramen spots in town."}
{"text":"Ramen is great but the wait is awful.  They quoted 20mins but it's been over 40mins and we are still standing cramped up by the front entrance.  Annoying thing is they have empty tables (booth and main large table) but they don't seat people.  Clearly the owner needs to hire an extra server if there are empty seats, long time waiting outside, but no one gets served.  It's too bad because the ramen is 5 stars but the wait time is terrible and turns it into a negative experience.  We brought friends with us and are feeling terrible for the overwhelmingly long wait when we could've eaten elsewhere and be on the way home by now.  The hostess that doubles up as cashier is completely clueless as to managing people flow.  A booth stayed clean and empty for over 20mins and she sat zero people there.  Eventually, when someone did get sat there, they were unhappy with why they weren't sat sooner when the table became available 20mins ago.  The hostess (long black straight hair eith bleached hairtips lied and said \"oh it just got cleaned a few minutes ago.\"  BS!  Everyone standing near the front knew she was lying and were grumbling about the same thing.  Bad wait aside, the food is great and the servers we've had were also excellent (except for the young woman with thick black rimmed eye glasses who took every opportunity to complain about customer.  This is the only ramen house with a vegan ramen and veggie ramen. All vegas broth ingredients atr imported from Japan.."}
{"text":"Have this first time after walking by a few times. This is not a real true Japanese ramen place you would expect. Lot more room than a normal ramen place which is the only highlight. The soup is okay but not great. The portion is small both the ramen and meat. A normal man will need extra noodle portion. However the price is about 10 -15% more than the other place around. I probably won't come back for all the above reason and few others just walking distance away."}
{"text":"Dammmmnnnnn good ramen!!  What can I say....this place hit the spot and left me wanting another bowl.  I ordered the Jinya #2 (spicy chicken bowl for $9.55). I got it without onion and I added an egg. They have 3 levels of hot/spicy, and I went with the hottest. It wasn't unbearable, but it had a good kick, in my opinion it was just right. The bean sprouts added crunch, I couldn't really taste the spinach, the chicken was moist and there was a good amount of noodles. It was the perfect serving size and left me satisfied.  Went to the bathroom before leaving and found myself in awwww of the toilet that sat before me. This toilet was the king of all toilets, and was amazing! This thing was huge, lit up when I came in and the seat cover lifted on its own. It cleaned itself for me and was ready to go. I sat down to find a heated seat cushion and control panel to my left. Awesome! They had rinse, spray, and all kinds of gadgets for your bathroom experience. A must try. =) The service was good, they all seemed happy and were friendly inside. The interior was nice and hip inside. Totally not what I expected from seeing the exterior of the building.   So if you're in Vegas and want some delicious ramen, stop on by."}
{"text":"I really like Jinya! It's my favorite ramen place for now and I am always pleased with the service.   Many people like different ramen places in Las Vegas and I have 2 favorites right now and one of them is Jinya.   The food is amazing! I really like the pork bun, the crispy chicken, and the pork ear chicharron (those are just the appetizers). All of these took me by surprise because I did not think that I would actually enjoy those foods. I expecting to think eh. The crispy chicken has to be cooked in some sort of god sent seasoning and it is nice and crispy and very hot...(but super yummy). The pork bun was delicious! My cousin ordered it and we shared it but it was so flavorful and I really wanted to eat more, but it was all gone :(. BUT, we should really talk about the RAMEN! It is so good and flavorful! Some places have a more specific flavor but I think Jinya encompasses a good taste in their ramen and it makes me happy.   The staff is very nice and they give very good service. I really like them and they take really good care of you while your there. Which I realize must be super hard because this place is always busy. I feel like ramen places are always really busy and Jinya is no excuse.   The atmosphere is very bar like in my opinion. It is very dark and intimate.  I feel like a lot of restaurants are going for dim lighting and dark settings now. I don't know if I like it or not. However, I will say I love having the big table in the middle. It feels very communal. Which, Im not sure is good or bad. It just has a welcoming atmosphere for the most part. Sometimes its awkward if you sit directly by someone you don't know but most of the time people are really nice at the big table.   Overall very good experience and one of my favorite places to dine."}
{"text":"Just came here out if a recommendation of my GF and I am not disappointed.   I ordered two appetizers, two bowls of ramen, hot tea and a Sapporo.   They all arrived on time and the service was on point. Personally I really like the decorations and the ambiance.   The only reason I would say it isn't 5* is the location. The neighborhood itself is just ghetto and makes me feel out of place. Other than that if you are looking for good ramen then come here :)"}
{"text":"Great lunch date for some yummy delicious ramen! Ordered the tonkosu ramen! Had some kind of pork flavor broth, 2 slices of pork and noodles!"}
{"text":"The vegan ramen is amazing! It's my favorite thing on the menu! Highly recommend it!  There's usually a long wait because the place is small and seating is limited but it's worth the wait! Definitely go during lunch hours if you don't want to wait. Dinner is crazy busy.  The tempura Brussels sprouts are always so yummy!"}
{"text":"Some great ramen. Love the chicken option. And their toppings are great - fresh garlic you crush yourself."}
{"text":"This is my favorite ramen spot in Las Vegas. I've tried other places and they don't top Jinya. Seriously.  I usually get the spicy umami miso ramen with tofu or sometimes I will get the tonkatsu black. My two faves. Also, the appetizers are bomb. Jinya buns and takoyaki is always a must. I recently tried a new appetizer, crispy unagi with seasoned eggs. I recommend that. It also comes with fried soft tofu. Just eat it all together, it's so good.  It's a small restaurant and usually busy during dinner time and late night, but so worth the wait if it is busy. It's also open until 3am so it's a good place after getting dranks or if you're hungry in the early hours of the morning.  @jinya pls open up more locations in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Awesome Ramen bar! I've been to several JINYA's in Southern California. I prefer the ones in California, however for Vegas, this is the best ramen in Vegas in my opinion. This location beats out all other  JINYA's when it comes to professionalism and great service!"}
{"text":"Got the cha cha cha ramen as i love garlic. So disappointed! Not at all garlicky. If you want garlicky ramen there are better ones in the GTA.   What was also disappointing was that my ramen bowl was not piping hot. It was above warm at best. The soft boiled egg was cold as was the chashu. The broth was overseasoned with salt for my taste and as a result I really tried to minimize the amount of soup I was taking in.  As this is one of their pricier ramens (15$), I was expecting a much tastier experience... I feel the higher price is unjustified as this ramen is mostly topped with a bunch of soy bean sprouts (cheap filler). Actually, it seemed like there was more bean sprout than ramen per volume. Also, I totally did not like/appreciate that the servers did not bring everyone's ramen in our group at the same time, or even within 15 minutes of delivering mine (basically we all had to watch each other eat, or if we had waited for all our ramen to come out our food would have turned cold)...If I was eating at the bar with my friends I would understand, but we sat at a group table."}
{"text":"So good! Can't believe I hadn't been here before yesterday. Spicy Chicken Ramen was unbelievable, so fresh and flavorful. They have so many options and I don't eat pork anymore so this was why I gave this Ramen place and dish ago. They also have a vegan ramen which is supposed to be good. Loved that they give you unlimited fresh garlic which you crush yourself at the table into your bowl. Line was out the door but only 10 min wait for seat and 30 for food. Nice atmosphere, big table in middle gets strangers talking and staff very friendly. Nice change from pho. I will be back very soon."}
{"text":"Awesome spot. Ill be back to try a few more dishes and make some more detailed reviews..."}
{"text":"I thought monta was good.... But this place is delicious!!!!  Tokyo Tonkotsu ramen broth was buttery, pork belly melts in your mouth!!!"}
{"text":"I finally decided to give this place a shot. The wait is usually kind of long after 5 so make sure to plan for that. First of all, the service was not that great. Myself and two friends went and we all ran out of water and had to flag someone down for awhile to fill them.   Happy hour has some sweet deals though. Got sake for $5 and some apps;  Takoyaki - I love takoyaki. And I've eaten it too many times to count. It wasn't served hot at all which made me sad. Good, but I've had better. (Poku poku has amazing takoyaki! :p)  Pork chashu w/ kimchee - I was very confused. It didn't taste like kimchi at all nor was there any kimchi in it. The pork was good though.   JINYA bun - I enjoyed this a lot. The pork was very juicy and melted in my mouth.    Now, for the ramen, I got;  JINYA Tonkatsu black - really appreciated the broth. I could really tell how long it took to get that type of flavor into that broth. I've had many salty broths at other Ramen spots and this wasn't overpowering. I also love garlic. They allow you to put freshly squeezed garlic in it! I also got butter and corn in my soup. The butter was huge!  I didn't meant to put the entire thing in... but oh well. I loved the garlic chips.    After eating it took a long time for the check. Then our server was non existent. Someone else came with our check and set it down on the table. Not one person said here you go. Or thank you! Or having a nice day! Nothing. So that bummed me out. Overall it was all good food. I will be back to try some other stuff."}
{"text":"The food was sooo good here!  I knocked off 1 star for ambiance.   The music was way too loud and I felt like I had to yell through my conversation.   My boss took me here and we ordered the tempura brussel sprouts..YUM!!!... Jinya Buns..made of marinated pork belly and wrapped with a sticky bun...MUST ORDER..SERIOUSLY...then we each got different soups..I had the no. 1 pork soup..VERY GOOD...same with hers.  Sje had the chicken version.   It was pretty reasonable too..our bill came out to $38. Ill be back for sure to try their tapas menu next time =)"}
{"text":"I was really excited to come to this place.  I waited three days to eat the noodles here.  I'm a vegetarian, so it's difficult to find a place with a vegetarian friendly ramen.  I came around an hour before closing.  This is due to it being the only time I could go.  When we first walked in, it was super intriguing.  Very dimmed lights...loud music too. My husband and I waited maybe 5-10 at most.  Nothing too bad.  While waiting, we noticed that they have a grade C for their food safety... Both my husband and I are very well educated on the proper ways to obtain and A, so we were a little scared.  When we finally was seated, we automatically noticed why they have a C... The dishes weren't sparkling clean, the kitchen looked like they could use people who know how to clean kitchens correctly...When we looked out our spoons, we had to clean them more as it was not cleaned to the fullest extent.  In regards to the food.  I personally thought the takoyaki was great.  The vegetarian ramen tasted a lot better than I anticipated.  So I was excited.  But since it was so close to closing, my husband and I felt rushed to finish eating since they literally gave us our bill the moment we got our bowls.  Quite frankly, we just ate as much as we could and got out as quick as we can since we didn't want to feel like a burden.    I feel like if I came during the day time, (hahah, only if I had the time), the experience would perhaps be less rushed and I could've enjoyed my noodles more.  Overall, I did enjoy the food...It was good....."}
{"text":"Their chicken broth ramen is amazing to match their service. If you are going to catch a late flight into Vegas this is the place to go eat (if you can) since they are open until 3am. Their sides are good. I definitely recommend the rice bowls as well."}
{"text":"Great ramen place! It was raining all day then in Las Vegas, NV which then called for a perfect time for some hot steamy Ramen! Let's see how my experience was!  [Environment] The location and inside looked really nice. Love the decor, paintings and the Japanese feel. You can see the chefs in the kitchen cooking away the delicious ramen. I loved seeing the natural ramen noodles being cooked with an exact timer for pure perfection.   [Service] The Service wasn't too bad, they were a little slow and quiet...a little too quiet for my taste but wasn't sure if it was because we were sitting at the bar side. Could have been a little more attentive though.   [Food] The food was great. I really enjoyed my bowl of ramen (Spicy Tonkatsu Ramen). The spice was there and I could feel the kick! The flavor was really flashing and the ramen noodles itself tasted fresh and cooked perfectly. I also enjoyed the sides that were offered! Lots to choose from, I'd recommend the seasoned egg, bok Choy, Nori, and fried onions!  Overall great place...the only reason it didn't get a higher star from me was because we ordered hot sake and we found a small bug in them...TWICE! The first batch and the second after we had it returned. Not sure how clean the sake area is but I would definitely suggest they inspect that. I wouldn't want any other people to experience that and ruin their appetite.  [ Taste it, Love it, Yelp it! ]"}
{"text":"The Ramen at this spot was delicious but you must order the Chicken Karaage! With Sapporo beer! Great pairing! The ambience was nice and service was great.  Wait time wasn't that bad and price was great too. Until next time..."}
{"text":"I didn't have the ramen here, but I did order the chashu bowl (10/10) and the JINYA bun (10/10). They were super tasty. The wait was not too bad, service is not as fast as Monta Ramen. Our server never came back to refill our drinks until we asked. Maybe I'll give this place another try, but overall average."}
{"text":"Soooo yummy. I'm a huge ramen fan and was very surprised how delicious my ramen was from here ! We came on a Monday 12:30AM (they don't close till 2) and it was busy! We only waited about 15 Mins and got a booth which was nice. Our server was very friendly and explained the menu to us and didn't rush us to order. They also have a noodle refill for under $2 but i didn't need it, I was so full. I will defiantly be coming back next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"This was my first ramen experience. The staff was very friendly although the food was a little slow and the waitress did not check on me as often as I would like the food was very good. I had the spicy chicken ramen and it was delicious. I came during happy hour and the mimosas were $3 which is very decent priced. I would come back again."}
{"text":"Great spicy chicken  soup highly recommended. The octopus  balls are a must try. The place can have somewhat of a wait sometimes. Luckily there's a check in list to keep things organized. Great place to come on a date or just to hangout with your friends. Happy Hour has some great deals as well. Their California rolls are decent. I wouldn't recommend the salad though, but it still deserves the 5 stars."}
{"text":"Awesome place. Women toilet have have A butt warmer !!!!! The food was delicious. Try the jinya dynamite if u like scallop."}
{"text":"Awesome ramen. I had the vegetable bowl and the bf had the cha cha cha. We started with the pork buns which were amazing."}
{"text":"HOLY COW. Best ramen I've ever had, the people were very sweet, the atmosphere was great. 11/10 would recommend."}
{"text":"The ramen is always fresh, and the service is fast and friendly.  Great ambiance, and open til 3 am! Can't live without this place."}
{"text":"Negative for food and service, yep, which one should i go first?  Ramen:  the taste is not too bad, BUT - insanely MSG, you have to drink gallons of water after and still feel thirsty like your body is leaking - among our bowls, some noodles are not done yet, still raw and hard in the middle, and noodles in different bowls are DIFFERENT! for my Cha Cha it is thick like a straw but in tonkotsu it is thin as thread, nothing is written on the menu, or did you just put in wrong ones by mistakes? - we had it on a Sunday night, no alcohol involved and that was our last meal, some of us had a sleepless night afterwards and took a sick day today, the others? spent the rest of night in the washroom, oh, and the next morning.  Man, you have a serious problem with your food do you know that? it is not even about the quality.   the service were much more interesting: 1. the greeter at the door did not know how to do a waiting list and start panicing and look around for manager. srsly? gimme a pen and paper and everybody can show you. just the name and # of ppl? 2. when the waiter was at our table, his face is just WAY TOO CLOSE to customers, like if i blink the eye lashes will be on his face close. is it now popular for la bise in japanese restaurant? this is so awkward, and boy, you are just not cute enough to have the privilege.   3. we asked for the bill, the waiter grabbed the manager, manager typed sth in the computer, and thats the end of story. then we waited for 20 min at least. and they were still swinging by like nothing happend? hello? the bill? 4. so finally we grabbed another guy, my original words are: can we have the bill please? we asked for it 20 mins ago. he looked at us, 5 second pause, and respond in Chinese: you want the bill right?  uuggh? why?? is your translator broken or what? If thats not the case, then youve been eavesdropping the whole time, and have to tell us that?    overall, even if i say dont go, you prob still will. so maybe just wait a little bit till they find out what they are doing? and get an iron stomach."}
{"text":"The food is great and consistent with flavor. I highly recommend the gyoza and pork bun along with any ramen you choose. I'm not a big dessert fan but the tofu (sorry I'm brain farting on the actual name) one is great because it's not overly sweet which is a great transition after all the food. Everyone there is welcoming that compliments  atmosphere. Check it out!"}
{"text":"One of my friends recommended this place. I went in with high hopes, especially after being back from japan and craving ramen. I got excited when I saw takoyaki on the menu...but that's where the excitement stopped. The takoyaki was mostly all batter, some of the inside pieces still being raw. The tako inside was almost nonexistent. Also, the takoyaki sat on egg salad which I thought was kind of weird. My friend and I ordered the chef special which had shrimp flavored broth and cilantro. There was SO much cilantro in the ramen it overpowered everything else.   If you're from Hawaii like me and expecting agu ramen or goma tei quality, don't expect it. It's nowhere close."}
{"text":"Service: Five Stars  We were seated quickly.  Server was friendly and explained the menu after asking if we had been before. Checked up on us a few times, but not too many times to the point of annoyance.  Food: 4.9 stars  This was my first real ramen experience, so I have nothing to compare it to, other than store bought packets, lol!   To me, it blew my expectations out of the...broth? Ha ha.  I tried the current chef special since it was only available for a limited time. I added fresh garlic (comes on the side with a press) and corn.     The broth was very flavorful an unlike anything I had ever experienced.  It is very different from pho or any other soup. It is a class of its own, and it's world class.  The egg was the most flavorful egg Ive ever had. Some ramen comes with egg, some you can add it on for $1, which I will always do if it doesn't come with it, it was that good. The only issue I had with the ramen was the broth was a tad too salty for my preference, hence the 4.9 stars, lol.   The famous Jinya bun was amazing.  Get this. Go during happy hr and its only  $3. It's got delicious pork, yummy sauce, and greens bundled up into a pillowing steamed bun like a taco.  Highly reccomend.  Busy place, we were seated right away but we got lucky. Parties behind us had a wait time. Its always a good sign when a place is poppin during normal slow hrs on a monday!"}
{"text":"Call ahead if you're looking for vegetarian fare. There is a lot listed on the menu, but they were out of basically all of it. Food looked good, but I left hungry."}
{"text":"I have tried many ramen joints in Toronto and there's a reason why I keep coming back to Jinya. Simply the best: deep, rich flavor paired with the perfect textured noodles... I always leave full. My go to is the tonkatsu black with a noodle refill."}
{"text":"Don't order the new appetizer chicken wing , so mini!!!! the chicken wing looks like from the tiny chicken and taste horrible . The ramen size is less now."}
{"text":"Horrible taste. Super greasy. The meat was all fat. Wrong noodles for the meal.  The soup was bland. No flavor. 2nd time going there durning the day and it sucking.  Not traditional Japanese ramen at all."}
{"text":"I love ramen and I've tried most ramen places in town. First time I've heard about Jinya was in the Ramen Festival last year in Rio. The rumor was they were coming to Vegas to open. They were not my favorite in the ramen festival but it was better than the most as well. That's why I had to check it out.  Food  1.Homemade tofu- the concept is interesting. They poured the hot soy milk in front of you and after five minutes the tofu started to get firm. It comes with seasoning you can add to your tofu. I personally think it's fun to order and it doesn't taste too bad. However, homemade tofu in Raku is still my favorite.  2. Crispy chicken- it comes with 5/10/15 pieces. They are not the usual karage where the chicken nugget is bite size. I would say they are twice as big as normal karage. However, that was my favorite dish of the night. Chicken was marinated perfect, crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside.   3. Tonkatsu black- I was impressed that they give your a whole egg instead of half. The pork was tender and noodle was nice and chewy. The broth is not salty which is a plus for me. Tonkastu in Monta is too salty for my palate. However, I think the broth can be more flavorful. This is why I'm giving four stars.   Service was attentive and decent. Decor was hip and spacious. I would definitely return and try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"I like the clean and modern feel of Jinya. There is a huge communal table in the middle of the restaurant but I am not a fan of those. I like that the menu has several different appetizers that you wouldn't usually find at a ramen spot.. We enjoyed the spicy tuna on crispy rice.. The spicy tuna did not have any kind of \"fishy\" taste and the crispy rice was perfectly fried. I recommend trying the chicken ramen.. You don't see that everywhere and the broth was surprisingly just as creamy and rich as the pork broth.. I do, however, prefer the pork chashu that comes with the pork ramen VS the chicken that comes with the chicken ramen.   Service was good but we did get a few plates that were not properly cleaned.. :/  HOT TIP: There is no drive-thru.. they should take their sign down lol"}
{"text":"Very good Ramen.  Line wasn't too long.  Even if it was, it would of been well worth the wait."}
{"text":"Looking for somewhere to get your ramen fix on a late night? Jinya's got you!! My normal go-to is Sora, but since my sis & I wanted it after midnight, Jinya was our best shot. For just us two, we waited for 20 mins to get seated. When we got there, there 10 parties ahead of us so I thought this was not a bad wait at all.  We got the Sprouting Up Ramen & the JINYA Tonkotsu Black. The sprouting up ramen had waaay too much brussel sprouts IMO, but the broth and noddles were still very good. My sis enjoyed the tonkotsu. It's got a little bit of spice but not too much - just perfect amount for those of us that can't handle the spice. And finally... we got the Tokyo Curry Rice & a Crispy Chicken and omg... this has got to be one of the best Japanese curry I've ever had!!! I didn't have much expectations since this is primarily a ramen house but I wanted to try their curry too, and I'm so glad I did. It is so flavorful, the texture is perfect (not too runny or too chunky), and the rice to curry ratio was good. Paired with the crispy chicken, we devoured this in just a few minutes before we got our ramen. YUM YUM YUMMMMM.  For a busy night, I thought the service was superb. I can tell that management definitely cares about training employees to be efficient & customer-oriented. Our server checked in on us frequently & we didn't have to wait too long for our food when we got seated. I'd definitely come back and try some other new items on this new menu! The only reason I took off a star is because I thought the noddle consistency could've been better. It was a bit too chewy but still acceptable."}
{"text":"I've seen vegetarian ramen options before, but never a VEGAN ramen option. So I was surprised to see the spicy creamy vegan on the menu. I was hesitant to try it thinking that a vegan option at a non-vegan restaurant might lack taste. Boy was I wrong! Hands down, this is the best ramen I've ever had!!! I will definitely be a regular here! Also, their quinoa salad is delicious & only $3 during happy hour!"}
{"text":"So So Jinya!  I'm pretty new to this Ramen craze and before dining at Momofuku at The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas I decided to take my friend girl up on her offer for a \"ramen\" lunch introduction.  I want to like Jinya honest I do but there were way to many service failures to count Sunday afternoon that took away from the overall experience. Side Note: majority of my friends rave about this place being phenomenal. Returning is a gamble at this time!!!  Main: I ordered Vegetable Ramen ($10) and it was just okay. I asked for spicy but I don't think that was communicated very well. No hint of spice in sight!  My friend ordered a \"chef special\" chicken ramen ($11.00) which comes with half egg. After a short debate with our server about ordering an additional half egg to her order; the ramen arrived with no eggs at all! Awkward! Appetizers: Caramelized Cauliflower ($6.20)was by far the best item ordered. Bold flavor and the pine nuts were a great addition. The chickpeas were loaded with cumin. A bit too much to be honest but I did enjoy them!  We ordered Spicy Creamy Shrimp ($7.80) which literally arrived at the end of our meal. The server came by two additional times and acknowledged she forgot the remainder appetizer as she continued to forget! Flavorful and delicious but late af! Dessert:  I ordered the Panna Cotta ($3.50) which was also blah! The graham cracker topping and ice cream taste like it was uncovered in a fridge for quite some time. My friend ordered a block pop ($3.80) which arrived unwrapped and a little moist like it sat out a few minutes (she shared this dessert is always wrapped).   The icing on the cake was our server coughing directly into her hands before setting up the small table next to us without washing her hands. She touched the napkins and the spoons. I'm no sanitation police but this was totally unacceptable!  Not sure the total because my friend felt bad recommending the place and took care of the tab!"}
{"text":"This place has great service! First time trying the chicken ramen and it was delicious! The tonkatsu assari was soo good! You should also try their curry rice bowl! I'm definitely coming back! :)"}
{"text":"Got the veggie ramen, ordered it spicy and it was fueeeego! Loved it. Got there just in time for happy hour and sat at the bar. Also ordered the cauliflower appetizer which was pretty good. Noodles were perfect. Service was great. Our server Gino took our order and he was awesome. Great and quick service. Kinda felt like the broth was overseasoned but I did ask for spicy."}
{"text":"I looked for ramen restaurants for visiting Las Vegas and found this place in Yelp. Tonkotsu black soup was delicious and noodles were great! My husband's chicken ramen was good too but I prefer tonkotsu flavor."}
{"text":"Loved the chef special ramen definitely recommend coming here the wait is long though, but its worth it!!"}
{"text":"great experience, great food! and most of all great service from IGI! he couldn't have made it a better experience for us! he checked on us every several minutes. food was to die for, eat here like 3 times a week!"}
{"text":"Making another review because I had another great experience and I want it to be known. Yoshi gave a 100% great customer service. We waited a bit longer then should have for our food because the kitchen messed up on our order, which is totally okay because people make mistakes and I appreciated that Yoshi was very apologetic and gave us some appetizers on the house. He had a great attitude and kept a smile on his face the entire time. Thanks Yoshi! It's hard to find great customer like yours :)"}
{"text":"Unfriendly vibe from the moment we went in to the moment we left... treated as if we were people who didn't pay for our food. food is not the same as the other JINYAs I've been to.."}
{"text":"The food alone would make this 5 stars. The service unfortunately was terrible. Not sure if it was a one off but I doubt it. We waited for around 45 minutes and then another hour until we received the food. I don't know why it takes so long to serve ramen... it's a pretty simple dish and it's a fairly small restaurant so there aren't that many people. Also after ordering nobody came by to check on us or give us an update when the food would come. Also it takes them forever to clear tables and seat people. I'll probably be back but will try to find a time when it's not busy. Management needs to make things more efficient."}
{"text":"This place says I never checked in before.  But I have.  I don't really like ramen, but I like this place!  Fast service and a cool hip feel."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good..... if it comes out to you correctly. 9/10 trips they are going to forget something you added or comes with your bowl and they still try to charge you for it! This place is starting to disappoint me :("}
{"text":"Super delicious ,, but my loyal 5 star is at oh jah noodle house.. I just wish oh jah offered that noodle and soup refill that JINYAh does ,not sure if it was free since I couldn't eat anymore of my giant bowl of ramen, it had such a delicious variety of fresh vegetables and the menu has lots of vegetarian options I can't wait to go back and try."}
{"text":"This place is as dark as a dungeon. I don't mind a little mood lighting but I'd like to be able to read the menu too. Aside from the darkness, the restaurant is pretty cute considering it use to be a Taco Bell. Too bad they didn't keep the drive thru, that would've been awesome.   So far, I've had the spicy chicken, tonkatsu black, cha cha cha, and miso ramen. They were all ok. The broth is just too rich and fatty tasting for my personal preference. I actually prefer the tapas over the ramen. The Jinya bun is pretty tasty and I love the crispy shrimp balls. Service has always been prompt and polite."}
{"text":"This might be my new favorite ramen spot in town.  Most people would steer towards Monta to get their ramen fix and I don't blame them. It's a legit spot. But this time around I was near the Chinatown area and wasn't feeling the idea of having to wait so we decided to give Jinya a shot since I've heard about how good they were from a variety of different people.  Located inside an old Taco Bell restaurant, they really did a great job remodeling the exterior and interior to create a cozy and dim environment. A little bigger than the Monta in Chinatown but I think ramen spots are suppose to be intimate in size. Anyway, let's talk food.  Ordered the Crispy Spicy Tuna since the prices here were half the price than they would be on The Strip. I was curious to see if there was going to be a difference in taste due to the price cut but nope! It's just as good! Also ordered a side of gyozas (ask for them extra crispy) since I usually like to throw them inside my ramen and it balanced out really well. My boyfriend even enjoyed them plain and he's usually not a gyoza or potsticker lover.  I decided to try the Tonkatsu Black and my God it did not disappoint. I was pretty surprised by how it wasn't as salty since I'm usually gulping down my water cup after a few slurps of broth. My face usually swells up after a large sodium intake but the fact that it didn't was very impressive in my book.  Knocked down a star since there was so many servers on the floor but I still had to flag a waitress down for some basic requests. Mind you that this restaurant is small. Service should be more than just taking your order and disappearing but I'm sure this place will look up since they're still fairly new.  I will be back regardless. Especially when there's a drive-thru lane attached!"}
{"text":"Very good. Great atmosphere. Excellent service. Great price.   Ramen was tasty and filling. Convo with waitress even better. Music rocked. Great vibe."}
{"text":"My kids took me here after many months of telling about how good this place is. I was not disappointed. We went here after a long hike at Red Rock and it was perfect for an after hike meal. I had the vegetable ramen and it was loaded with kale, lettuce, cauliflower, broccoli, and of course ramen noodles. There was so much that's I couldn't even finish it even though I wanted to. The waitstaff was very friendly and great at explaining what everything was. Also very attentive and never let my water go fully empty. The decor is nice but it can get a little loud when it gets crowded just because of the open seating area but it isn't so loud that you cannot carry on a conversation within your group. I recommend this place if you love ramen."}
{"text":"This place is bomb.com i would so recommend this place to anyone. Even my husband is the worst man to take to eat he is such a food critic and he loved this place."}
{"text":"This might be my new favorite Ramen joint. I don't necessarily think Jinya beats Monta, but it's definitely on the same level as them. The gyoza may be a little more tasty though.   We've eaten at Jinya a couple of times now. The first when it was still pretty new, and my boyfriend and I both tried Tonkatsu's. I did the Tonkatsu Assari and he the Tonkatsu Black. It's weird because when I eat Ramen, I guess I don't automatically notice the difference in flavor right away, I just think they're all good. I tried mine next to my boyfriends and was able to compare. Both were delicious, so both win. We also enjoy JInya because they offer the option of making your ramen into a combo which includes  a salad and one other item (gyoza, fried chicken, cali roll, or a some kind of meat bowl) We've ordered the friend chicken and gyoza. Good deal! and the chicken is so incredibly juicy and seasoned very well. The atmosphere is really nice also; I liked the decor, but think they could have utilized the center of the room a little better, rather than throwing that oversized group table in the middle. The table is so wide that the center doesn't get any use really; instead it takes up a lot of wasted space. Which wouldn't be a problem if the food tastes horrible and people didn't come there. But seeing as the food is good, and people will visit, they will be busy. Jinya should have realized this and, instead created two tables in the space available that would have been accommodating.  Oh yeah, this is a note for you ladies. Don't forget to check out the bathroom. They have the BEST TOILET I've ever seen. I probably could've stayed in the bathroom for a while and just played with all the amazing things this smart toilet could do. haha."}
{"text":"Not the best restaurant if you're looking for authentic japanese style ramen. The soup base tasted like regular chinese noodle broth and the chicken slices were too salty. The service was also slow compared to other ramen joints we've been to and it wasn't even busy. Overall, the tastes did not blend well so it was evident that it was not cooked by Japanese chefs"}
{"text":"Great Ramon for lunch I had the sprouting up ramen it was fantastic. Third time here and it has been fantastic every time."}
{"text":"Amazing Ramen and Great Service! The restaurant is nice and clean and the servers and friendly and polite.   I wish they would turn up the air conditioning!!!! Yikes"}
{"text":"We go to Jinya all the time in Houston and love it! When we saw it was right by our hotel we jumped at the chance to get away from he strip food.  The portions are huge!  As always the food and service were great! Love, love, love the brussels sprouts they were fantastic as always! My boyfriend got a HUGE bowl of the cha cha and was so happy.   Thanks for a great meal! If you love garlic get the add on (it's free)."}
{"text":"I'd give 4.5 stars actually But I don't kno how to use that button.  We arrived vegas at 1am And searching for any good place for late dinner And we found this!  We went at 1:30 and it was still very crowded, needs to wait but not a long wait. The vibe inside is really nice, although it looks like everyone was just on a date rather than filling up.  We were sooo hungry and really went for FOOD (laughcry) my boyfriend and I ordered 2 combo, mine comes with a curry rice. THE CURRY IS REAL GOOD. best curry I have in this half year in the states.  Noodles portion was nice too, filled up real satisfied :) and they offered real ramen, I mean, closer to what we can get in japan. And the broth, I'll give it 4/5, it's tasty, but of course, with MSG. But still fine... all ramen places in the US are like that.  What I appreciate most is the CHAR SIU!!!!! The PORK comes with the ramen!!! You really should go trying that!!! 5/5!!! (I'll even give 10 out of 5!!!!!) That soft and they did it really well!!  Overall would be 4.5/5... just because of the MSG, No ramen place in states could ever get 5/5...   Already missing this place when coming back in CA..."}
{"text":"This place really hits the spot. My cousins and I came here for happy hour which is from 3-5pm, and they have a great selection of appetizers on the menu. From the happy hour menu we ordered Jinya Buns and Salmon Poke Tacos, which were both absolutely delicious. I think the star of the show was definitely the Takoyaki, which are these soft amazing octopus balls. I usually don't like octopus or squid because the texture is too chewy for me, but the takoyaki was a flavor bomb in your mouth, I highly recommend it. For the entree, I got a small chashu pork bowl which was pretty good. I can't wait to come here again."}
{"text":"Food was very good . Service was nice.Love happy hour. The noodles soup is one of the best I had...yum. Will come back for more..."}
{"text":"I have never had the opportunity to try Ramen, until now. WOW! This is the best meal I've had in a very long time! They had a vegan ramen that was out of this world. I will continue to stop here every time we visit Las Vegas. This place has now opened my eyes to the world of ramen!! The service was not great. Our waitress didn't know what anything meant on the menu. Also the mimosas are not fresh, they are a bottled drink. No bubbly :( The food was so amazing that it trumps the waitress issues in my book!"}
{"text":"I still clearly remember my first visit to Jinya a few years ago when it was new - I hated it. The menu laid out their ramen philosophy, and stressing the most important thing for ramen is the broth. Ironically the broth in the ramen I ordered was very oily and underwhelming in taste, and I stayed away ever since.  Come Sep 2017, I was invited to try out their revamped menu. My group ordered one of each of their new ramen - the sukiyaki Q; Spicy creamy vegan, and the Kara-Men. We absolutely loved all of them! The broth is now much more clean tasting, not oily, and the flavour is good. I am a big meat-lover and would have never ordered a vegan ramen, but that veggie broth tasted fantastic. The Sukiyaki Q ramen tasted good, with my only complaint being wanting more meat (the beef slices are thin, like in Sukiyaki, but I want more meat!!). The kara-men is the most flavourful of the lot and I loved the look of the onsen egg on top.  We also had some appetizers beforehand, with my favourite being their Jinya bun - a flavourful steamed bun with a thick slice of tender braised pork chashu. It definitely rivalled by usual go-to at Bahn-Mi boys! The deep fried brussels sprouts were interesting as well and I liked having it.  The only disappointing part of our meal was the mochi dessert, which have green tea ice cream inside. The taste is a bit weird for us as it was somewhat \"floral\" and not like the green tea ice cream we are used to. Wish there was another flavour we could have tried.  Overall, I am super-pleased with the change in taste and in the new items at Jinya. I would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"I'm very hard to please when it comes to ramen, but this place exceeded my expectations! I had a chef's special ramen, called Tokyo tonkatsu. Very tasty, the egg was jumbo, the broth is just perfect, and the pork is savory and tender! My only recommendation is to have levels of how much garlic is put in, as they get abit too into how much garlic goes in. Other then that, great job! This place usually has a line due to popularity."}
{"text":"Where to begin? so many things wrong with this place it's not even funny. Came in from outta town for a small vacay. This place came highly recommended and the wife and I love Japanese food! So we come in small line to wait 10 minutes. We get seated and we wait about 20 minutes for our waitress. So finally she walks up and has an attitude. Small blond Asian with one sleeve of tats. Acts like she's doing us a favor by taking our order. We ordered a bunch of food, takoyaki, Kara age, the buns, kimchi tacos, the curry bowl and the spicy ramen. All I can say is meh on the food, with some exceptionally bad items. Eveytime our waitress came she just threw our food at us, like here's your shit. My wifes food came quick mine came 10-15 minutes later. Yay i get watch my wife eat! wife heard someone cuss the waitress out so we weren't the only ones I guess.   The curry was a salt bomb and for being a large plate it seemed very small. The ramen was warm by the time I got it, wtf? I did mix it and it got to barely warm... oh and did I mention the flies? We had at least 3 at our table. Yummy just what you want to see at your table as you eat. The music was obnoxiously loud. The only reason this didn't get 1 star was the wife enjoyed her takoyaki."}
{"text":"Food: 4 / 5   The food is quite good, my broth wasn't too strong nor was it too weak. It was a good balance.   I ordered the white tonkotsu premium with extra meat and extra noodles. Happy hour crispy chicken and a soft drinks   There were a lot of extra noodles but only 2 small pieces of pork chasu for the extra meat so I'll try to stay away from the extra meat. The only reason why I didnt give the 5 stars is because of the small portion of chasu.   There were no problems with the crispy chicken tasted pretty standard and good, nothing too special about it.   Serving time: 5 / 5 Fairly Quick  Staff: 5 / 5  Super attentive, helpful and friendly.  Price: 5 / 5 Pricing for ramen is always like this so pretty standard. No complaints."}
{"text":"Have long been a big fan of Monta but ever since I've tried Jinya, I found that I prefer Jinya a lot more. Broth to me is more flavorful, they offer a lot more varieties and you can't beat the fact that they have fresh garlic and a garlic press to use with your ramen! I'm a garlic fiend so that is a no brainer. It can get busy at times but it is never like monta, where you gotta wait a good hour before eating as if you're in California. Highly recommend! Decor is also of a modern feel too, gives you the vibe of a hipster place downtown."}
{"text":"JINYA specializes in tonkotsu flavored ramen which is based off a pork bone broth. I think JINYA does a fantastic job with their broth. It is creamy, rich and full of flavor. THey have several options for their broth, I went with a spicy tonkotsu broth with a spicy level of \"spicy\" which i assume is considered medium. The ramen was cooked firm the way I like it, it had pork slices, but more sliced than normal, eggs, green onions and some of the other regular stuff you'd expect in the ramen.   I honestly felt like I could have gotten away with the tonkotsu assari which had about the same things in my ramen minus being spicy. Reason being was they have a bunch of condiments to still make your broth spicy so you could save a couple of bucks.   JINYA also offers a ton of toppings, they also have some really fresh garlic you get to mash yourself. I was not a huge fan of their takoyaki, too much batter, not enough octopus imo. They also have fried brussel sprouts in truffle oil, tasted like any other tampura fried item, truffle oil does not elevate the taste.  Overall, I think this place is great for their tonkotsu ramen."}
{"text":"O V E R R A T E D. Only been here once but there was a huge ass queue here which is ridiculous since the ramen wasnt that good, compared to other places. Have fun eating this overpriced, Americanized, gentrified, oily crap."}
{"text":"Probably my fav. restaurant in town! It's a fun spot, intimate (I think the building used to be a Starbucks), but I love what they did with the space. The food is always good, and the people working there are super nice. I like that they always have a good playlist going as well. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Im huge on ramen so believe when I moved to Vegas a year and a half ago I scoped out all the ramen spots to find my go to place. What wins me over? The seasoned egg! That is the hardest thing to find that's perfect at ramen places and jinya is the absolute best in Vegas.   Also, I'm not huge on the pork chasu so I'm thrilled that jinya offers chicken! They have vegan/vegetarian options too which is pretty exciting. I think the best thing about them is their variety. I usually go for the spicy chicken ramen or the regular chicken ramen and it's amazing! Also the add ons are mostly a dollar so add some tofu, broccoli, corn, or my favorite... extra eggs!"}
{"text":"Wider variety of Japanese food which I love!  Ordered ramen and curry. Good enough to satisfy my craving but not to where my taste buds would sing.   Good go to spot for all Japanese food cravings though."}
{"text":"food 2 stars service 1 star Our server had attitude that I might've been ok with to deal with as a fellow patron at a happening club. But definitely NOT as a server at a mediocre ramen joint.  I thought she was mute. she didn't talk in the beginning. when my friend asked for drink selection, she disappeared, came back with menu, and stuck drink menu under her nose w/o a word. When my other friend didn't get his drink, he asked for it again. She simply nodded and disappeared again. No apology, no verbal acknowledgement, nothing. I felt grossed out by the service.  GROSS!"}
{"text":"Always open when I need them, before a party or maybe even after! Great food with lots of flavor! The gyoza is bomb, best gyoza I've ever had I believe! As soon as it comes out I pop it in my mouth! Even though I may burn my mouth it's still worth!   Spicy ramen is they way to go! And taste even better when you add fresh garlic it takes it up to a whole new level!   10/10 would go again. And another one"}
{"text":"I was debating on 3 or 4 stars because the service was WONDERFUL and I feel terrible that the ramen wasn't the absolute best.   Let me just add in that I've never had Ramen before, this was my first time. I'm not quite sure that it's my kind of food.   I ordered their Vegan Creamy Ramen (as did everyone else at the table). I was told to add egg in it by the server. (I'm not vegan but I enjoy eating things with no meat or dairy sometimes) the Ramen came out fairly quickly, no complaints about that whatsoever. When it came out the noodles were delicious and hot along with the broth. However, the egg was cold, and as was the Tofu. I'm not sure if that's how it's supposed to be but I personally prefer all my food to be hot when it gets to the table.   Other than that, the flavor was nice and the noodles were amazing. I would eat here again but I would reiterate to the waiter that I'd like the food to be hotter."}
{"text":"OMG their tokoyaki (I hope I spelled that right) was GREAT! I loved their ramen. Noodles were perfectly cooked.  Service was pretty good, Prices are fair.    I don't think there's a whole lot to say except YUM and I've been there twice now and will definitely come back again!!!"}
{"text":"I went here on an early Saturday afternoon. The interior is ok. Large bar/table in the middle of the restaurant with some bar seats and booths.   I had the miso black ramen combo with crispy chicken and house salad with a jinya bun and their ice cream flan for dessert.   The ramen was too fatty for my taste and the chashu was a bitty fatty as well. The crispy chricken had a nice flavor but that too was heavy and oily after a few pieces. The jinya bun was mediocre at best, as it was just sweet. The desert was very good and was the saving grace of this being a 1 Star.   ...Side note this meal left me with the fattest headache for the rest of the day, so I don't think I'll be back when I have my ramen craves."}
{"text":"This is one of my new favorite ramen places in town, for sure.  Ordered the veggie ramen bowl. They weren't kidding when they said \"veggies\", the bowl was overflowing with greens and vegetables. Awesome amount of food for the price you pay. The have various other bowls with chicken and pork as well, and you can get it spicy or not.  They also have the option of adding extras to your order. Extra noodles, meat, egg, etc. Really great idea, since I think we can all agree we need a little more noodle in our lives.  They have a surprising selection of beer here. While it's no where near a 'craft beer bar', they do have a couple craft beers that pair great with your bowl of noodles.  The only downside to this place is it is small, so chances are if you go during normal dining hours, it's going to be packed and a bit of a wait. However the Ramen Bar is open late, so if you need a late night meal it's perfect."}
{"text":"Their policy for split checks was the most troublesome. Otherwise, food and service was good."}
{"text":"Wow, Jinya makes some tasty ramen! On the salty side though. My revisit was long overdue. If I want ramen I'm usually at Sora or Fukumimi depending on which part of town I am in.   I remember the one with black garlic was good. I love that they have chicken ramen and vegetarian ramen. I recently tried the creamy, vegetarian ramen with egg and it was so bomb!   They also have a nice selection of appetizers and side dishes. The sweet potatoes were cool, but a bit too starchy for my taste.   What sets Jinya apart from other ramen places is that they have happy hour and reverse happy hour! Would love to come back and try a bunch of apps and sides.   Service here has always been prompt and friendly!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love Ramen!! This place is packed on a Tuesday it is that good! I had the soft shell crab bun, spicy chicken ramen- I may just convert from pork belly it was that good. Daughter had the Cha Cha Cha garlic pork belly bowl, hubby had the special pork ramen. All the broth in all three were delicious. We had the crispy chickpeas as an appetizer. These are so good with a little curry flavor on top. We will definitely come back next time we come to Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Their ramen is good but I feel like their customer service needs improvement. The servers look so unhappy and they don't even talk or ask if you need anything they just walk away. They should be more enthusiastic and put a smile on their faces since that's what customers like to see and experience when going to a restaurant. The only one that made it pleasing was the older lady which she looks like she's the manager she was very nice and helpful. Overall they would've got a better rating but the service wasn't great."}
{"text":"Nice Ramen, by far the best in Vegas. Broth is really good and big portion, noodle given too much, can't finish.   High quality and almost same as Japan standard. However the place is fusion bar with some cool music, so if you are looking for a silent place here might not be suitable."}
{"text":"AMAZING! The food is delicious! We have been twice now and have been very impressed with everything we have ordered. I love that they have brussel sprouts  to add to the ramen- so good! The broth is flavorful and they have tons of stuff you can add.  To top it all off, the customer service is wonderful! Our waiter was Hitoshi and he blew our minds with how friendly, professional and attentive he was. We will definitely be back again and again.   Huge thank you to Toshi! You made our night :)"}
{"text":"4:30 on a Sunday and this place was surprisingly busy. After tasting their Spicy Creamy Vegan Ramen I knew why. Its your typical mid/upscale ramen joint - exactly what I was looking for. Friendly staff, quick service, yummy food. Cant go wrong! They have tables for large parties too."}
{"text":"The best thing about this place? Service. They were awesome and always on top of it. Super friendly and this place wants to make sure you get your stuff quick. Which is excellent if you're starving.  The ambiance was great. Love the decor, the music, and the overall vibes.  We had:  Gyoza - super yummy. They have the sauce on the table which was very garlicy and delicious.  JINYA Dynamite - Meh. I wasn't too much of a fan.  JINYA #2 - I loved it. Everything but the dried seaweed. I should have asked for it without. Because I hate seaweed. The broth for the ramen is very good. I've had a bit better other places, but it was very tasty.  Tonkotsu Spicy - Very good. Nice and perfectly spicy.   Everything here was very good. We will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"This place is so poorly designed first of all if your entire party is not present you can't be sat and they don't have anywhere for waiting guests to sit and the waiting area is tiny."}
{"text":"First time trying ramen! & not the Maruchan kind lol.   I tried the pork bun & the Tokyo tonkatsu ramen & I loved both of it! The broth was very flavorful, & I loved the thin noodles, since that's what I'm used to. I didn't really care for the pork that was in it (I can be picky when it comes to meat), but it's okay since the soup & noodles filled me up. The portion was a good size, big enough for two people to share.   The service was excellent. Our waitress was always around to check on us, but wasn't too overbearing. I'll definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"Jinya is the ramen place to go in Vegas. In my opinion, it is better than Sora, Monta, Tatsu, and Fukamimi. The broth here is what makes it so delicious. The broth is so thick and flavorful that the other speciality ramen restaurants. I've only tried the Tonkotsu Black here but I can't change my order because it is so delicious. I do have a few complaints about this restaurant. The taste may be the best, but the service is far below outstanding. They NEVER refill drinks or check on you. We ordered the \"fresh garlic\" that is supposed to be free and the server never brought it to us. We reminded them twice too. Another complaint is that the first time I came here, my noodles were stuck together in a ball and they looked sticky and gross. And my boyfriend told me they made them fresh and when I took a bite it was raw dough and and flour and it was disgusting. I lost my appetite after that. That's the same day they served my boyfriend a hot tea with the teabag tag inside the hot water... Very unprofessional and lazy for the staff to overlook that. I haven't had the best experiences here, but the food is pretty good for the most"}
{"text":"The staff is exceptionally friendly and accomodating, the ingredients are fresh, and the thick noodles are to die for. I have worked my way through the whole menu and the Cha Cha Cha and \"Sprouting Up\" ramen are unparalled in deliciousness. Pro tip: get the $1.50 side order of extra noodles."}
{"text":"My son wanted Ramen again so we looked for a new place to try. I had the wonton Ramen and he had the kids meal which came with chicken Ramen. To say that he loved it is an understatement. He actually ate 2 bowls! He loved the crispy chicken and fries that came with the kids meal. The wontons were delicious and the meat inside was delicious. This was a pleasant experience and we are now traditional Ramen addicts(in a good way)."}
{"text":"JINYA ramen has been good to me everywhere I've been.  I ordered the cha cha cha ramen for delivery to my hotel room at 3am in the morning.  It was delicious!  The ramen's broth was extremely flavorful and the chashu pork was melt in your mouth delicious.  My only quarrel with the to go version was that the noodles were a bit clumpy but the broth took care of that after time. Also, the egg was over cooked and not wet at the center as it should have been.  I'd definitely order from them again however. Solid late night option."}
{"text":"Until now my only experience with ramen noodles was cup of noodles, boy was I missing out. This place was incredible. We arrived late at night and the place was mobbed. The wait was about thirty minutes we were very hungry and decided to get ours to go and take it back to our room. With so many delicious choices to choose it wasn't easy to pick. I chose the spicy chicken ramen at medium heat. They give you two containers for your takeout, one with the broth and the other with the rest of your contents. Wow was it awesome and just a heads up the medium heat which they call spicy has a pretty good kick to it. So if you are in the area and looking for something a little different this place is where you want to go."}
{"text":"Good broth that isn't too rich and the chicken was nice as well.  That was a first for me in leu or pork belly but I am trying to keep the weight down so...."}
{"text":"Their ramen is so darn good, so much flavor in one bowl! But overpriced in my opinion. Still, my new fave ramen place."}
{"text":"After my experience last night I don't think I'll be back. Last night marks the second time I've been fed non vegan food. I used to come here because they a decent amount of vegan options with a little creativity. My favorite was the kale salad which I've eaten every time of gone which I was under the impression that it was vegan, well apparently it contains egg. I don't think I'll be back I've been sick all night."}
{"text":"The booth was abit salty, noodles were perfectly cooked.  Chashu is pretty tender, not too fatty. I love garlic, not very japaneses authentic thing to add fresh whole garlic into ramen, but i do like they have this option.  Their takoyaki is delicious. They don't have alot of table for huge groups, mostly bar spaces like most ramen places."}
{"text":"Had the chicken and pork ramen. It was great, you can really taste the chicken in the broth."}
{"text":"I love this place! The food is delicious and they also have fast service. The servers are very polite and informed as to what the menu offers. I like how it's open late...The only downside is the wait time, the restaurant is very small but the food makes up for that. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"I am unsure where all the positive reviews are coming from. The service is descent however terrible wait times. Started with the shrimp balls and crispy chicken. Crispy chicken was fatty. The shrimp balls, I don't even know where to begin. The three of us each ordered separate varieties of ramen all tasting like rotten turkey pot pie. You can't make this up...... Turkey pot pie. We shall not return."}
{"text":"Is this authentic Japanese Ramen? I thought it would be going in, but was disappointed, as was the rest of the family.  That being said, it usually looks pretty busy when I go by so I am glad they are doing well and hope they have improved since I was last there."}
{"text":"umm let me see here....this was a last minute choice and i still think of this place being that old Taco Bell but as i walked inside it was defintely transformed into a place that had a really big table in the center of the room which i feel gave it the family feel. Even though the room is dark and loud music is bumping i felt comfortable in here.  Lets get to the food me and the wifey had the Jinya #1 and a order of shrimp balls.  Jinya #1- (3/5) i think when it comes to ramen i have a hard time being amazed or having it make my eyes roll back on taking a bite. im used to eating alot of different asian noodle soups. it was a creamy pork broth with egg noodles topped with pork,fried garlic and a boiled egg that wasnt cooked all the way so when you crack it you get that oozing yolk. i think the egg tasted weird though but thats just me. i think it would have been better with some wontons or bbq pork but then it wouldnt be japanese.  Shrimp Ball (3/5)- I think it was like those shrimp balls you get at dim sum with the sweet mayo but it had some fried garlic on the outside so it wasnt nothing special. they garnished it with chilli peppers but its something that i probably would order again.   The service was great and they were attentive and can actually hear what youre asking for even though that music was loud. Space is very limited and after we came in there was a grip of people that came in that seemed to wait for a long time to get seated. im glad i came and got seated right away. thanks for some decent ramen unless im craving it i probably wont be back"}
{"text":"Host was slow to sit people down even though there were lots of open seating! Food was great! Ramen were rich! I loved it"}
{"text":"I went in to jinya to get an order to go. The girl at the desk told me it would be about 10-15 minutes ended up taking 35 minutes for 2 orders of ramen.  One of my orders was wrong. Ordered broccoli and corn didn't come with it! Wouldn't advise going to jinya for take out, just dine in."}
{"text":"Man!! That was amazing!! We sat down right away, and ordered within 5 minutes. I had never been there before, so the waiter explained everything. I wasn't in the mood for ramen, so I ordered the rice bowl. It was exquisite. The ice tea was fresh and very yummy. The ramen came out a little later, but not too long. It was huge!! There was a lot of broth left so the waiter recommended that we got more noodles. Then we put that in a box and ordered dessert. The matcha ice cream was the most interesting on the menu. So we ordered that and it was probably on my top ten list on best ice creams I have had in a while. Overall,  it was great. Will visit again"}
{"text":"Still have yet to find a better ramen bar in Vegas! Fukumini and Monta are conveniently closer to where I live, but the drive to Jinya is always much more worth my while. You really can't go wrong with anything you order here. Everything has always been consistently delicious for me every time. My \"usual\" that I order is the Cha Cha Cha with an extra seasoned egg as a combination with their Tokyo curry. Both have such great flavors and haven't failed me yet. Stop in and get your ramen fix here!"}
{"text":"Great Ramen! Down the street form my office, I have been wanting to try for some time. Finally talked another co-worker to give it a shot and I will be a regular customer! I tried the Tonkostu Black and it was delicious. We got it to go, so can't speak of the servers but the hostess was great, sat us down while we waited and even offered water. May get an extra egg next time....soaks up that broth!!"}
{"text":"This place has very good ramen if you have the cravings for ramen. I ordered the tonkotsu black ramen and it was very rich in flavor and the noodles were cooked perfectly! Although I wish the broth came out hotter in temperature because after a few mins of eating the soup cooled down.  Also don't waste your money in ordering extra thick noodles because there really wasn't a difference in my opinion in thick vs extra thick noodles    Their happy hour menu looked good and I would definitely want to come back for it especially to try their baos. The service here was great our waitress was very attentive and friendly!"}
{"text":"The ramen is good, although I am not a fan of ramen at all! The service was good, but it's so busy it takes a long time to get help. Now, the appetizers are off the chain!! Guys, there's happy hour and the appetizers are a little more than $3!!!! I order the chicken, and also the shrimp balls! Both amazing. Shrimp balls are normal priced although the chicken appetizer is on the happy hour menu.  I like how intimate he dining experience is. It's a small establishment with dim lighting and lots of chatter from people laughing, cooks clanking hardware, and music blazing from the ceiling above. The atmosphere is great!  I don't like how limited the menu is and all the extra charges. I wish there was a Parmesan bacon item added to the menu, or something acquired to different tastes and not just one tasting pallet. I also don't like that each time I've visited Jinya, the items I ordered were not available. It seems there's a shortage in supply. I order something different every time and both times the items weren't there so I had to order a different item I didn't desire that night."}
{"text":"I had a very positive experience at the Vancouver location and was not disappointed by the speedy, efficient, and excellent service and vegan ramen at the Toronto location! It is a loud place, but that's part of the fun. You could definitely do casual or dressy and not be out of place, and the appetizers and sharing plates are great if you're with friends or looking to add a bit more to your meal. This location might be a bit worse for sitting across from each other as a pair, but it looks like it would be good for 3-6 people and you can sit on your own or with another person at the bar-like tables that look out to the street, which I enjoyed!"}
{"text":"Service was awesome, ramen was awesome! Need I say more? Try the tempura Brussels with truffle oil great stuff."}
{"text":"Jinya is one of the most inconsistent restaurants I have ever been to, which is really unfortunate.  Sometimes the food is absolutely fantastic, while other times the food is bland or too salty.  My GF and I used to go here all the time, however we both decided it wasn't worth the risk anymore..."}
{"text":"The taste of their takoyaki is inconsistent. I've ordered it four times already. I like the Rice Bowls."}
{"text":"Big bowls of ramen at JINYA! It gets super busy and loud at night since the ramen is pretty good here and it's decently priced considering the amount of food you get here.  We had the Sprouting Ramen (their speciality) and the Cha-Cha-Cha (for garlic lovers). The Sprouting Ramen is one of their best, it's rich, filling and yes, bean sprouts everywhere. As for the Cha-Cha-Cha, it was slightly different from my first visit. When I first went there, the Cha-Cha-Cha came with freshly peeled garlic and a garlic crusher. I could literally put it in as much garlic as I wanted to. Second time, they didn't have the crusher so I had to ask for garlic - they gave me a small plate of crushed garlic. Kinda wish they still gave me the crusher.  Overall, it's a pretty decent ramen place in downtown. It's very good value but the taste wasn't amazing or mind-blowing."}
{"text":"I just called and placed an order for pick-up. A girl who answered the phone was so rude. She kept talking to somebody while i was telling her what i want. Of course she did not hear me and she kept repeating herself with attitude like i did not understand what she was saying.  It is not just today. I never felt welcoming when i go there. Greeting with smile seems too much work for them. I understand they are busy it is a popular ramen place. But who wants to go back to be treated like that"}
{"text":"Great and fast service! Wish the place was a lot bigger tho.. Waiting time wasn't too bad.. Food was delicious!"}
{"text":"Was seated and wasn't spoken to for 15 minutes.  2 groups sat behind us had their order taken and food served to one group.  After order was finally taken 5 minutes passed and still no drinks.  Walked out and told manager our dissatisfaction and he looked like a deer in the headlights saying sorry over and over.  No attempt to keep a customer.  Bad experience!"}
{"text":"Myths and lores has stated that eating long noodles will promote longevity.  So always eat your noodles!  Came here on the first day of the great journey in Vegas.  JINYA Ramen Bar.  We were hungry and ready to eat.  The location was clean, the service was fast and friendly.  They did messed up my friend's order, but promptly fixed it.    The food was good, one of the finest Ramen I had ever experienced.  High quality noodles, decent broth, and decent pork belly.  The octopus balls were okay, I was never a fan of them so I can't judge.  Everyone seemed to have enjoyed their food for sure!  The loo? Was mediocre at best.  I was really hoping for something magnificent because I heard many great things about it.  And was totally disappointed with the standard issue equipment in there.  I heard the ladies restroom was better with those fancy toilet that rinses you clean.  None for the mens.  Minus one star for lack of equality. :P Pretty clean loo with good supply of toilet paper.  Overall a decent experience, and will definitely be back when in Vegas.  I hope next time there will be a better throne in the loo waiting for me to do my business."}
{"text":"I usually love jinya but this location gave me my worst ramen experience to date. Their seating system is a write in list and they made no consideration for party size. Even though there were 3 or 4 single person spaces available they made me wait until larger parties were seated. I ordered the quinoa salad and that was unremarkable and not well tossed. I ordered the tonkatsu black with tofu instead of pork. The first bowl had pork in it and the tofu was ice cold. The second bowl was right but again the egg, tofu, Kikuragi mushrooms, and spinach I requested added were all cold. This never happens at the Atlanta location I go to and I go there a few times a month. Even worse I stepped away to go to the bathroom briefly (think a number 1) and they bussed my table while I was in the bathroom briefly. It was an extremely disappointing experience all around."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh. I thought I had a favorite spot, not naming them, but this is my NEW favorite. This place was yummy. As an app, I had the tacos (can't remember what they are called specifically, but they were interesting in a good way! Hubby had the fried chicken which was great and crispy.   I had the garlic ramen, and the flavor is so full and yummy. I have no complaints. It was exceptionally prepared and all of my additions went perfect. I definitely would get extra noodles next time but would not mind trying the other ramens on the menu."}
{"text":"This is my second time to Jinya and they never let me down. The Ramen dishes are so good. I had the Tonkotsu Asari and my dinner mate had the spicy chicken Ramen. He said his was so good he wanted to lick the bowl. This is a must try for anyone who loves good ramen bowls."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this Ramen spot. Spicy Chicken ramen was so so so GOOD. Will definitely make this a regular spot. Loved it!"}
{"text":"I'm always on the lookout for a good ramen spot and this is a great place. Their ramen is delicious and the space feels inviting and authentic. Only downside is the waiting, it's so good it's always full."}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE!!!  I've been wanting to find a great Ramen Bar since leaving Portland and I've finally found one!  I discovered Jinya after a concert at the Orleans Arena.  This is defiantly a late night spot.  When you walk in you place your name on the waiting list and wait to be seated.  Their seating options are individual booths, a seat at the bar, a seat at the community table or a small booth.  Just be sure that you are open to any type of seating.    During my visit, I ordered the Spicy Ramen Chicken, but they were out of Chicken so I had them add Pork to my bowl (which I was super nervous about).  I also added Corn and Green Onions to my bowl.  For additional charges you can add additional noodles, broth, spices, vegetables, etc to your bowl.  We also ordered the crispy chicken as an appetizer.  The appetizer came out super fast and was so good.  The chicken was cooked perfectly.  It was hot, it contained all of it's juices and a crisp outer shell.  The Rame came out in a huge bowl (which I couldn't finish and ended up taking half home with me).  The service was fast and the food was super flavorful and hot."}
{"text":"In my opinion, the best ramen place in Vegas. Ever since I've gone to ramen places in Japantown LA, most ramen places here don't taste as good. Jinya, however, is up to par with the better ramen places I've tried out of Vegas. Every time I go here I am sat instantly. Longest I've waited was 5 minutes. They also sell combos where you get a bowl of ramen and an appetizer.  If the wait times were an hour I'd still eat here. It surprises me that some ramen spots here have a one hour wait when the better ramen spot can get you seated almost instantly."}
{"text":"My partner, our friend and I were in the mood for ramen, and remembered this place when browsing Yelp because our vegetarian friend was raving about it. None of us are vegetarians, although our friend doesn't eat pork, but this place definitely had something for everyone.   It's located in Chinatown, and very easy to find. The inside is nice, and intimate. The decor is something you'd expect to find in a restaurant in Chinatown. We opted to sit at the bar, facing the line cooks (open kitchen). They were all friendly, especially our server. I wish I would have asked her name, or kept our receipt so I could give her a proper shout out.   I have to mention that they were out of thick noodles and wontons when we went in. They were very up front about it, including posting a sign on the front door.    I ordered their Sprouting Up Ramen, and it was delicious! I am glad I ordered a few extra eggs in the bowl. The thin noodles were really good! I usually order thick noodles, personally, but was pleasantly surprised. The tonkotsu broth is flavorful, the slices of pork are generous, and the bowl was really balanced. The price was reasonable, especially considering the portion size.   I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Jinya Ramen was amazing. Best ramen I've had outside of Japan. We went on a Wednesday evening, we're seated immediately, menus were explained, the special happened to be a $9.99 pitcher of Sapporo which I partook in, and the ramen and gyoza were delicious. I ordered the classic Tonkatsu, and just like in Japan, the pork just melts in your mouth. The broth was almost creamy with how rich it was. The noodles were cooked to perfection, and the whole dish warmed the soul. I wish we had this place back home."}
{"text":"It's a cool, hip, and very tasty ramen place. They play some really funky music and the ambience is stylish. Ramen is top notch. We got there around 12am and got seated right away. Overall, it's a great ramen place that I would definitely come back if I crave ramen again next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"Probs one of the best ramen places I've had in Toronto. I've been waiting for this place to open ever since I heard about it. And it's from LA too!! I came here on a Sunday for late lunch and we got seats at the bar. I got the Sprouts ramen with pork chashu, Brussel sprouts, egg, and corn. It was sooooo good. The broth was amazing, thick noodles were cooked perfectly, the egg was perfect, pork was super tender, and the Brussel sprouts was a good addition since other ramen places don't usually put in veggies. I really liked how light the pork broth was, I do like creamy broths usually but not something too heavy, so this was a good change. The portion was pretty big too! Although there is one thing to note- there's no AC inside so if you come in the summer you'll be sweating like cray cray"}
{"text":"Every time I'm in Vegas, I love trying places off the strip. The family was craving Ramen so I found this place on Yelp. I'm so glad that I did. It's a really small restaurant, but the food definitely makes up for the lack of space.  I loved that it is kid friendly! They have plastic bowls and plates and a kids meal! The kids meal was awesome and huge portioned. My two kids got to share ramen, fried chicken and rice, and a california roll. Plus almond pudding for dessert.  The family got tonkatsu ramen, veggie ramen, and spicy chicken ramen. The broth was very tasty, and had ample noodles. I loved that you could press fresh garlic into your broth at the table. We also ordered the brussel sprouts, which were good but I would've loved a dipping sauce.  The lychetinis were also legit. Loved that they were only $5 each. Wouldnt hesitate to eat here again. The servers were all very nice and attentive."}
{"text":"New place.  Deco is ok, nothing special. Staff is ok, nothing special and the nonuniform squared open shirt style looks kind of awkward to me. Music is too loud!! Ramen place is not a sportsbar!! Waitress asked too much and weirdly -- if you can hear them --- whether the food they brought to our table was what we ordered. Shouldn't they know before? On the opposite they forgot one item.  Ramens are decent, on the comfy creamy oily style, but easy to digest and in good (meaning small enough) proportion. It is clearly a bit different from all other ramen places so it is not only another one... Prices are a bit high.  I probably will continue to go to my basic kinton when craving ramen, and to this one when i wish to change, alternating with raijin or sansotei"}
{"text":"Jinya is my new favorite ramen place! Love the food and staff... They are friendly! Good foods, love their selections..."}
{"text":"One of my favorite ramen places in town.  Environment: The restaurant is located just up the street from the Palms casino and is in the general Chinatown area. The outside gives the impression of the place being small and the surroundings aren't exactly the prettiest setting ever but upon entering the décor is hip. They play trendy music, have nice lighting, and a variety of seating options including small booth, a communal table, and seats at the ramen bar. Jinya can get busy though so the limited seating does sometimes require a wait so be warned!  Food: While at most ramen places the most important thing is picking the right ramen, at Jinya the appetizers are just as good. Their jinya buns are amazing, the tebasaki was surprisingly delicious and although they don't have it anymore their crispy rice spicy tuna used to be great too! However, on to the ramen, I typically go with the tonkotsu black ramen, which has most of the ingredients I usually add to ramen anyway: garlic, hard-boiled egg, nori, etc. I have also tried the spicy chicken ramen, Cha Cha Cha ramen, and the sprouting up ramen, each of which is just as good.   Service: Service is generally good, especially for a fast-paced ramen spot. We had multiple employees checking up on us throughout our meal and I never felt like I was left needing something.  Overall, Jinya is one of my go-to ramen places, and I since the Monta location in Henderson shut down not too long ago I bet I will be coming here a little more frequently than usual!"}
{"text":"After all that drinking and partying, my friends and I decided to eat ramen before our drive back home to San Diego. I went I yelped and found this joint Jinya! Upon arriving, the wait was pretty long and we had a big group so we decided to split up so that it would be faster. They have a lot of different variety on their menu. I ordered the Tonkatsu black and my boyfriend got the cha cha cha ramen and made that in a combo and got the pork chashu bowl & salad. My ramen came out to be really gooood and they even have the option to give you fresh garlic and a garlic press so you can add as much garlic as you like! My boyfriend ramen was great also but the pork chashu bowl was one of the best rice bowl I've tasted honestly!!! I like it better than my ramen. Lol the server was very nice and attentive. I would definitely come back again when I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"I went in really wanting to like this place. We waited about 20-25 minutes huddled by the door waiting for a table. They have a really big communal table in the center of the place that I believe was available, but never offered, so we ended up waiting for a booth. One of the first things I noticed was that they have their \"B\" health department rating covered up by a potted plant. Service was pretty good and I enjoyed the ambiance of the place. The ramen broth was well balanced, but I agree with a previous review that the noodles are just too damn starchy. A few pieces of very fatty chashu and a whole bowl of starch. I don't think I ate even have of my Cha Cha Cha and my companion didn't finish hers either. The happy hour salmon and chashu tacos were tiny but pretty tasty. They do have a good beer selection! I'd like to give them at least a 3 star, but if a ramen place has bad ramen, you get a 2. I wouldn't repeat."}
{"text":"Brought my five boys here for dinner on our way through town. Two gave it 4 stars, two gave it 5 stars, and the three year old gave it 3 stars because 3 is his favorite number. D and I say 4/5.  A few boys got the chicken ramen with wontons and loved it. My husband loved the broth but not the wontons. I got the other broth and loved it with the seasoning sauce mixed in. Super yummy. We are all big fans! Yum!!"}
{"text":"It was a long wait when we went but it was worth it. Ramen and takoyaki taste legit :) and good price. The servers are also attentive and nice."}
{"text":"Best ramen in Vegas!    The service is great, everyone from the staff to the chef was very welcoming and greeted us right away.    I tried Spicy chicken ramen for the first time. It was literally the best ramen I've had. I can't wait to come back just for this.   My friend tried the Tokyo Ramen and thought the same thing about hers.   Also tried the almond pudding with the fresh fruit topping.  It was good. Nice change from the usual ice cream options at the other places."}
{"text":"First time here thought we give a try..  But too bad what we want mostly to ordered they don't have it..  Some appetizers and curry chicken ramen they even don't have it..  It was only picture on yelp..  Service was good but food taste was OK..  Should take out the picture out off from yelp if you don't have it no more.."}
{"text":"A friend and I visited Jinya during happy hour after hearing good things. It definitely did not disappoint. We ordered several dishes including: Salmon Poke Tacos, Pork Tacos, Jinya Bun, Salmon Cilantro Sashimi, and Jinya Tonkonsu Black Ramen. All of it was very good and I look forward to trying other items on the menu. The waiter did forget our drinks but no big deal, he was very knowledgeable and gave good recommendations when it came to the food. I will definitely be back. *Visited Aug/17"}
{"text":"A ramen chain in the West Coast. I decided to give myself a treat after my exam. I wanted to try the quinoa salad for some reason I forgot all about it when I saw Brussels sprouts on the menu.  Brussels Sprouts Tempura: My bad for not seeing the \"tempura\" part. I wanted a vegetable...fried veggies just don't make sense - what's the point? Aside from being deep-fat fried, these poor things are doused in truffle oil and heavily salted. After forcing ourselves to finish the sprouts, there was a good teaspoon-ful of oil at the bottom. Veggies aren't supposed to give you a heart attack. 2/5  Fried Chicken: Kara age. Lightly breaded but extremely oily and salty - Soul Glo oily. The pieces of chicken were not dry. 2/5  Jinya Bun: Pork belly bao. You get a nice thick piece of pork belly with sauce, Japanese mayo and greens. 4/5  Tonkotsu Black: Pork broth with chashu, kikurage, green onions, nori, seasoned egg, garlic chips, garlic oil, fried onion and thin noodles. Probably one of the best bowl of ramen I've had in Vegas. The noodles were perfectly cooked and the broth was excellent because of the garlic. 5/5  The service was good and the place is typical of a ramen bar. I appreciate the variety on their menu. The ramen was great and they are a ramen bar. But man, the oilyness and saltiness of the appetizers were unforgivable. We walked out with our lips all pale and feeling so bloated after eating all that salt. My hair smelled like oil the whole day. I would still come back for the ramen and nothing else though."}
{"text":"Frequent Las Vegas trip for work, we found JINYA open until late at night helps.  Last time I dine there after 10 p.m., restaurant is packed with young. Happy hour menu and drink was nice until I see  \"Tonkotsu Black\" I orderd. It looks and taste ugly as you see on the picture. Too much \"Mayu\" , and noodle was soft, soup was bottom of the pot?  I will drive to Monta or Fukumimi ramen on our next trip."}
{"text":"Just great soup.  Big into soup in hot las vegas as it keeps me hydrated.  These guys do it right.  Their pork in their ramen dishes is unbelievably tender."}
{"text":"I originally wanted to give this place 2 stars, but considering how the service was actually decent and the overall establishment was clean, I opted for 3 stars instead. For a small location, Jinya is quite nicely decorated--it is very hip, modern and trendy. The fact that Jinya is also one of the only ramen places in Las Vegas that is open until 3 am also makes it a plus. I can definitely see this restaurant being the perfect joint for late night dates, large group gatherings and after work hang out. The service here is also very good. The food comes out fast and the servers are very attentive. Now, that being said, the quality of food itself is a completely different story.  When my boyfriend and I went to Jinya, we both tried the tonkotsu ramen. I ordered the Tonkotsu Black (pork broth, pork char siu, nori, garlic chips, thin noodles) and my boyfriend ordered the Tonkotsu Spicy (pork broth, pork char siu, bean sprouts, thick noodles). For an average of $11 per bowl, the ramen was nothing out of the ordinary that you couldn't get some where else like at Monta or Sora. The tonkotsu broth itself was one of the heaviest broth that I have ever tasted in ramen. As soon as it was in my mouth, I could taste the richness of the broth and literally feel a thick layer of butter/fat coat the top of my tongue and mouth. While I understand that ramen joints typically enhance the savory taste of the broth with ingredients such as fat and butter, however, the broth at Jinya was so rich that it made the entire dish too overwhelming to finish. It almost felt as if I was consuming pure fat, butter and oil mixed with salt.   You know you ate some serious heavy sh**t when you can still taste the fat coat your tongue and the back of your throat several hours later.   I'm normally the type of person with a very strong stomach. However, that night when I got home, I felt very sick with heartburn.  While I don't expect to walk into a ramen place coming out feeling detoxed, because let's face it-- ramen is usually an indulgence of umami and flavors.. But, I have never experienced such a heaviness feeling from other ramen places like I do from Jinya. I guess there is such a thing as too much richness-- a concept I usually don't mind. But here, I feel like it's overboard. Not to say that it's not worth giving this place a second try.. but if I ever go back, I would never order the tonkotsu ramen again."}
{"text":"Before JINYA, I had tried one packet of Top Ramen in college, was disgusted and never considered it an option again. All that changed after one of my bestest friend's birthday. She stated she wanted Ramen and I told her about college and she exclaimed, \"that's not REAL ramen!\" I agreed, since when was accepting a 10 cent package as the be-all, end-all of ramen? It wasn't. I was so ignorant, given my love for virtually all Asian fare (expect Korean).   JINYA has a sleek modern feel. A large table in the center is used for large parties or several small partied. It should be noted the rest of the establishment has maybe 4 seats at the bar, and the rest are booths that seat 4 comfortably. Not a place for large groups.  On my last trip I got a the Cha Cha Cha (my favorite to date!),a chicken ramen with seasoned egg, tons of herbs, and tons of garlic as well a side of fresh garlic and a garlic press. I dream about this dish. I've brought friends to taste their noodle delights and they too are hooker. I am so afraid to try Ramen elsewhere because JINYA serves up a bowl of heaven. I rarely get sick and pho is my GO-TO, but I rue the day I get down with the sickness and destroy a bowl of broth and noodly goodness. Seriously, it's next level.  I usually order a combo with a salad and/or gyoza/california roll). The salad is great and I whatever dressing they use on it, is flavorful and unlike anything I've tasted before. During a happy hour I tried a JINYA bun which was delicious (and almost as good as Fat Choy's). Oh, yes, folks, you read that correctly, JINYA has a dope happy hour (3 PM - 5PM)! Cheap drinks and all apps are reduced (although the price point here in on point).   Service is always polite and the staff seem to work in teams running food and providing refills. This place gets packed! I've seen wait times. The joint is open until 3 AM, 7 days a week! Note to self: on the off chance you get schwasted, noodle it up!  I am in SLURPY, NOODLY heaven when at JINYA, my only complaint is that the music is so damn loud in there. I've found this to be a trend in modern Asian joints. Anyone else notice this?"}
{"text":"Such a great place. I come here late at night after my buddy wins his basketball games to celebrate the victory ^_^ I can see why it gets so crowded during the happy hour at night. They have pretty good deals for what it's worth. There's this new girl that's the hostess named Richelle. She's so sweet and she's got a real nice smile whenever I come by. I like that it feels like I'm welcomed in by her and the staff."}
{"text":"Maybe the best ramen spot in the city. Great salad, gyoza and service. Had spicy chicken ramen on most recent visit and traditional pork tonkatsu my first time, both on point."}
{"text":"Friendly,  prompt,  and helpful service.  Food was awesome. I had the lunch special with a small portion of Ramen,  3 piece gyoza, rice, drink, and dessert.  Hit the spot and it's lunch until 5 pm!"}
{"text":"This chain has the BEST VEGAN RAMEN ever (even better than T's Tan Tan in Tokyo!).  Best of all, this location was super friendly, had ample parking, and the staff was great. Love my Vegan Garlic Ramen with Extra Noodles and tons of extra fresh garlic on top - a must try!"}
{"text":"Came to Jinya and of course, it's winter and ramen shops are starting to get busy. Line was out the door so we waited. Unfortunately, the heater outside was not working so I was freezing my butt off. Waited about 30 minutes. First time here and the atmosphere is a little too dark and loud for me. If you like taking pictures of your food, flash would be have to be on lol. However, the food was delicious. Ramen was on point. We got the Sprouting Up Ramen and Tonkotsu Black Ramen (the popular). We also ordered appetizers. The steamed bun and the tako (octopus). Really good!   The waitress was forgetful. We requested the food to come all at one time with the appetizers but they ended up giving us the appetizers first and then the main entree 7-8 minutes later. Appetizers got cold because we wanted to eat it with our ramen. That's okay though. I'm willing to come back and try this place again and hopefully I'll give it a full five stars next time."}
{"text":"The food was unreal.   Kids friendly and most reasonably priced with excellent portions. Deep fried rice with Spicy Tuna app was ridiculous and had the Spicy chicken Ramen, hot!   Last the almond jelly, what a surprise!"}
{"text":"So happy they had a vegan option!!!!! The ramen was super delicious. If Ibdidnt cut out noodles I would definitely be at this place all the time. My hubby got the black something ramen he said it was hands down the best ramen he's had!"}
{"text":"Absolutely biased because my favorite server - Brittany, is here. When I'm here, problem is, I lose all my money because she's just fabulous.  I always get the appetizers here - chicken karaage, if not, then the gyoza, if not then the takoyaki... and for days when I'm a pig, I get all 3 lol   My favorite would be the spicy chicken ramen - but switch out the chicken chashu to the pork for me since last time I tried the chicken it was a bit heavy for me.  Here, I always get up full and bloated and take all my food home.. but I can't help that I like everything here lol  I spend here a minimum of $30 each time, and it's $30 well spent each time. Consistent in service and in food. Nom nom  And they close at 3am, go go go!"}
{"text":"I've been waiting for Jinya to open for a while now after hearing about it a long while back during a ramen festival. And so when they did open up, of course I had to go. My friends and I decided to give it a try one of the nights for dinner.  We started off with the organic tofu, which was made in front of you! It was pretty awesome to see. The texture of the tofu was a bit rough than what I'm used to and when I was eating it, all I could think about was how I wanted some syrup to go along with it and turn it into dessert tofu! Taste wise, nothing really special but interesting experience.  I also got a Jinya Bun to try, which was pretty much a pork belly bun. I gotta say...I've had better. It was a lot of sauce on the bun and most of the times, it covered the flavors of the pork belly and .. I didn't really like that. It was a sweet smokey type of sauce and it wasn't exactly very appealing to me.   As for the ramen, I decided to go with the spicy chicken ramen at their spiciest level. I normally go with a tonkotsu but most ramen places in Vegas make their tonkotsu broth really heavy and salty so I didn't really want to go there. Instead of their thin noodles, I decided to sub it with their thick noodles. I like my noodles al dente and most places don't cook their thin ramen noodles that way so I took the chance and went with the thick ones.   Good choices on my part. The broth was light and very good. It is not heavy, not salty, and not too spicy even though I can take really spicy things. Best of all, I didn't get tired of the taste of it. When I normally eat tonkotsu, I get tired of the flavor really fast. The noodles were perfectly al dente!   On the side note, their bathroom is very romantic. It was quite dim with some lights around the mirror and lights around their toilet. Their toilet's lid automatically comes up! Its one of those bidets -- pretty spiffy. All they really need is some soothing music in the bathroom and we could have a nice rendezvous there!   Overall, great ramen. Would definitely come again to try other things! (:"}
{"text":"Outstanding! We have been searching for a good ramen place since we moved here from Japan. This will be our ramen house from now in. Great service and the seating only took 10 minutes."}
{"text":"takoyaki was good. ramen was dull, a bit blant. went there twice. the service was fast. servers were friendly. the table setting was weird though, having a huge center table that was meant for group of 20+ people. the menu was small and food was flavorless. i give it an ok 3stars. it would be 4stars if the chairs wasn't solid wood. it will hurt your butt if you sit too long."}
{"text":"Busy or not. This is the best ramen place in Vegas in my opinion. I used to get the tonkotsu white ( or black) but they got this new Brussel sprout ramen ( my love for Brussel sprouts in unreal) that is to die for! Foods great. Service is great. Even when it's busy. Give your employees a raise."}
{"text":"My family was very happy that we choose to visit this restaurant. Customer service was great and very fast. We recommend this Ramen restaurant to our family and friends."}
{"text":"...and WE'RE BACK! We come here whenever we are in town and I admit, I suck at posting reviews sometimes so I'm trying to do my part fellow Yelpers...this place is Awesome. Service and food are equally fantastic. We are a Ramen eating family and this is our spot when in Vegas.  The place can get full but it's because the food is pretty darn good. Please stop in and try it out, the add in options to customize your Ramen is a bonus!"}
{"text":"Excellent ramen and great staff. The only downside is that the establishment is not large enough to accomodate the demand and so expect to wait 20-30minutes."}
{"text":"Always a busy place but I never seem to have more than a five to ten minute wait. Vegan options are good nothing spectacular."}
{"text":"I went here on a friends recommendation that they had the best broth for Ramen. If you go to their website you will find a history on the franchise and franchise options.  I ordered their sprouted ramen and had a order of their Crispy Chicken off their happy hour menu. The crispy chicken was chicken thighs battered in flour and salt and pepper. I found it a bit salty. It also came with a bit of fresh greens with traditional Japanese salad dressing (ginger). I wouldn't order the chicken again as it was too salty for my taste.  The ramen on the other hand was very good. The sprouted ramen comes with cha sau, bean sprouts, brussell sprouts, a hard boiled egg, seaweed flakes served with ramen in a chicken broth. The soup is light not overly salty and msg tasting. I also like the soup because it is not too oily.   I didn't take the offer of a Sapporo for $3 dollars but that is an added bargain.  I would come here again and enjoyed the food"}
{"text":"Discovered this place while doing Postmates so I decided I had to try it myself! Got a take out order of the Spicy Chicken Ramen. You get 3 different choices of spice level and I chose Spicy! It was soo delicious! They sent the noodles, chicken & veggie in a separate bowl from the liquid (so not to get soggy on the drive home). The portion was a perfect size and I'm STUFFED! I will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"All the dish are tasty! i ordered the takoyaki,the jinya bun, the brussel sprouts tempura and one  premium tonkotsu  white( ramen) .Everything was fresh, the takoyaki so creamy and the ramen is simply the best i never had. The service is fast and efficient. The price is cheap, around $10 for a ramen and around $ 5 for a tapas. I already been twice in a week."}
{"text":"I lived in Japan for 4 years and this is so far the best Ramen restaurant I've had in Vegas. Sora taste very oily  to me, Jinya tasted perfect. Also, the crispy chicken is very good. Something I'd order as a child and it was on point! My husband is also very picky and he loved the variety of foods Jinya offered. We will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Wow what a fancy ramen restaurant.  We enjoyed using Happy Hour(3pm-5pm), Sapporo draft was only $3!  I love how they set up a menu, we wanted to try one of each..  so we already plan to take one for next visit. Tokyo tonkotsu was very richer flavor, yes server explained to me before we order so it was supposed to be.  I am ready to try next one.  :-) Overall we were so happy to be there."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time last night after hearing a lot for good review from friends. Very busy even at 2 Am.Food was great but the service really lacks! I will however be back and recommend to others!"}
{"text":"This is the best restaurant that I have tried in Calgary,furthermore, the service and food is really amazing. ??????????? ???????"}
{"text":"Super SLOW service. We had to wait 30 mins just for a couple of bowls of ramen!!! That is on top of another 30 mins of wait for the table."}
{"text":"The quality of Jinya is not very good. I was expecting a cold ramen for summer special on a hot summer afternoon at Jinya, just like any other ramen restaurant. BUT, SURPRISINGLY, they have NO COLD RAMEN! Their soup base was greesy and I lost my appetite after a few bites. I packed it into a take out box and went back home to eat the rest of it under a very cool air conditioning."}
{"text":"Instead of the tonkotsu black, I've been getting the tonkotsu spicy and God damn....I love both! Constantly getting my jinya buns on the side and topping it all of with hot sake is a great way to end a stressful night. Been coming here since day one and I'm still a Fvcking fan. Keep up the good work. I love you...."}
{"text":"Its a bit on the pricier side but I had such a delicious meal. The takoyaki balls were big and fluffy, and I also ordered the Chicken Wonton ramen. The portion size was generous, lots of noodles and I think maybe 5/6 wontons (only thing was that there was a slight off-taste to the wonton meat). Overall, I'd definitely go back."}
{"text":"First time here, was looking for a late night bite from our travel from SD. So this place caught our eye since it was a ramen place opened til 3am.   We were greeted and seated quickly as we entered. Our waitress Alex explained their menu, informative.   My husband and I were eager to try the Jinya bun and it was delicious!! The charshu pork was so tender and flavorful, it's a must! I'd come back here just to eat it!  My husband ordered the Tonkatsu Black and outta 10, he rates it 7.8. He enjoyed it but it wasn't the best.   Our friend Ryan and I got the Tonkatsu Asari, the broth was light and the ramen was filling. Wish there was one more piece of the pork, it was yummy- it comes with one! I usually don't finish mine, so my husband added my thick noodles to his broth. Ryan prefers a thicker noodle for the ramen. My fave part of any ramen is the egg, it was cooked perfectly but it did not have any flavor- minus a star.   Overall this place hit the spot, I'd come back. The one thing we didn't like was how loud the music was playing. The set up was nice!"}
{"text":"This is probably not the best ramen place to go to. I have been to better places. However, this is a good place to hang out with friends. Food is okay an service is so so."}
{"text":"Came here for a variety of appetizers / small plates to share for dinner, and not a single one of them really stood out to me. Off the top of my head, we had some bao, takoyaki, and katsu curry with rice. It was filling, but probably a bit too expensive for the quality of food that we had."}
{"text":"The ramen here is very similar to KINTON Ramen. This specific location is very cool. Overall if you're new to the whole ramen phenomenon this is a good place to start considering the ambience and good ramen."}
{"text":"First time coming here - located at the intersection of Church and College.   --- Food --- The ramen was mediocre. Broth didn't impress me. For $14 Black Tonkotsu, I don't think it was worth it. Although there is a lot of noodles in the bowl, nice portion. The egg was almost fully cooked, I was hoping for half boiled.   My partner ordered the combo - comes with a salad and tea. The salad was tasty, good salad dressing. He also ordered Japanese tea which was quite a rip off because it was just a simple green tea bag in hot water - it also costs $2 where most places its free.   --- Atmosphere/ Service --- We really liked the interior design of this ramen shop. Nice decor and lighting, ample of seating space for hanging out with friends or your date. The service was great, they were friendly. However, in the beginning, the hostess accidentally swiped the chopsticks off the table, and she picked it off the ground and placed it back on my plate. I thought that was a little gross - even though the chopstick was still in the paper packaging, it was placed onto my plate...   -- Overall -- Still a good experience overall because we liked the atmosphere and service. We weren't fond of the ramen itself though, we might head for the other shops instead for now."}
{"text":"\"I'm sorry your ramen is cold, the BEST I can do for you is MICROWAVE it\"  This was the response from the server after I received not lukewarm, but actually COLD soup.  I have been a regular here for years and I used to recommend the place to other chefs and restaurant professionals that Iwork with. However, the quality and service have declined so much over the years I would tell anyone to avoid this place at all costs.  The last four times I have come here the ramen was barely warm. The noodles had been sitting too long and gotten slimy and the broth gelatinous. Refrigerator cold add on toppings didn't help improve the experience.   Let's talk about \"service\". Last night I was there with two friends. We ordered an appetizer and drinks and three entrees from one server who never once returned to the table again for the entire meal. The drinks and apps came in a timely manner. (\"Whoops I forgot glasses for the pitcher of beer\")   We got one bowl of ramen. Ten minutes later we got one more. Another 10 goes by an I flag down a random server to tell him my ramen is cold ( it's been in the window for 10 minutes, \"How about that microwave, for food you just paid for, that wasn't made right, how bout we just nuke the crap out of it for you?  It's the very BEST we can do\") and we are still missing an entree.  The server  dismissively says, \"Oh, I know, we are still waiting on that\".   (We just figured you didn't want to all eat at the same time, but rather, take turns watching each other eat)   Get your sh*t together Jinya."}
{"text":"I love ramen. I haven't have legit from Japan but what I've had I love!  This place is a great goto when you're at home and want to order on postmates! These guys are consistent and don't disappoint.  I ordered the gyoza and pork charsu ramen spicy. Came to the house piping hot and ready to eat. All the flavors were great. They could look at the seasoned egg as it didn't have much flavor but overall a great experience.  I haven't visited the restaurant first hand but having ordered togo a handful of times and had great food I'm sure dining in will yield a great result.  I do not have any pictures of the togo but they had great little containers that kept the food hot and simple.  Monta ramen has a steady competitor and  they deliver!!!!"}
{"text":"You can't be vegan and then not have vegan. Seriously a sign in the restaurant is a joke. Walked from the strip for nothing..."}
{"text":"First time here today. It was really good. We had brussel sprouts appetizer, crispy chicken, pork buns and gyoza. For the main Ramen meal we had Jinya NO.3 Tonkotsu Assari. Good service and very affordable meal. I would go back again for sure."}
{"text":"Let's get the cons out of the way: Lines. It took about 20-30 minutes to get a seat, but TBH, was kinda worth it.   The music playing pumped me to buy a damn ramen bowl and made waiting not entirely terrible. The hallway to the restrooms turned into the standing line as you waited for your name to be called. Not the most glamorous of queues, but it's better than the frigid outdoors. After being called and getting seated, we were greeted by a fantastic waiter. He not only was patient, but grabbed our drinks and appetizers in a speedy fashion.   Speaking of drinks....the water!!! SMOOTH AF.  Don't think I've ever commented on the texture of H20, but there it is. Feels filtered, but so close to bottled Fuji.   Back to food. We ordered the Poke taco, Jinya bun, Old Skool Ramen, ChaCha, Pork Chashu, Salad, and green tea mochi to finish. I was glad I didn't get the chacha even though I love garlic. I couldn't get into the fish broth.   The tonkatsu black was the perfect combination of what I was looking for and had just enough broth and noodles in it, along with the soft boiled egg. It was nom!"}
{"text":"After a late night workout, I was hungry for some ramen and around this time (10:30 PM), many ramen places seemed to be closing. After yelping out some places, I found JINYA which seemed to have good reviews, not too far from where I was, and opened till 3 AM.  The location had a lot of parking and the spot seemed quite busy. Some people were waiting outside the door so I kinda got iffy to dine in, assuming that the wait was long. Asked the hostess how long the wait was and she said 15 mins so I went ahead and reserved a spot.   In less than 10 min, my boyfriend and I were able to get a seat. The atmosphere was great; lighting was dim (I didn't mind it) and I really enjoyed the music playing.   Our server was able to assist us pretty quick from the time we sat down. We didn't know but it was happy hour at this time so we got the crispy chicken and the salmon taco. We enjoyed both and I definitely loved their mini salmon taco!  As for the ramen, I got the chef's Tokyo Tonkatsu Ramen and my bf got the same one but the Tonkatsu Ramen Black (soup base was a little different). Both tasted great, good toppings, and the soup base was delish! We finished the whole thing! Definitely gonna hit this place up again."}
{"text":"The ramen here is LIT! I used to think Monta was the best ramen place in Vegas, but after coming to Jinya, my mind has changed! Whenever I go to Jinya, I get the tonkotsu black ramen, which is my favorite ramen dish on the menu. The broth has the right flavor to it, the egg is on point, and the pork is always a hit! I also like how this ramen dish comes with thin noodles since I like thin noodles. Also, if you ever come in the evenings, Adam is an amazing server! Whenever he serves my table, he gives wonderful and welcoming service and is never afraid to give recommendations. I definitely recommend this place for your ramen cravings!"}
{"text":"Really good Ramen, staff could use some help just a little too busy and loud makes it difficult to get good service. But great food and friendly smiles."}
{"text":"This was the worst day at Jinya ever... I was very Hyped to try the Pork Chashu Rice Bowl but wasted like 10 mins of my life and finally we had someone who came to us to tell us that their \"microwave was broken to actually heat up the Pork.\" Other wise the ramen is EXCELENTE."}
{"text":"I was pretty disappointed by the ramen. I got the Tonkotsu Black and the broth was bland and not hot enough. The restaurant itself is roomy and the service is good, but the food just was not up to par. The prices are also slightly higher than most of its competitors which makes it even worse."}
{"text":"My first time at this place. There are more choices of ramen and other items on the menu than other places I've tried. Came there around 9pm and the wait was about 30min. Definitely will be back to try different ramen. I had chefs special and it wasn't my favorite. The buns were excellent! Must try!"}
{"text":"Really good ramen but pretty heavy. Not enough vegetarian options. No gluten free noodles."}
{"text":"It's a hip restaurant with ambient lighting, seats at the ramen bar, communal seating in the center, or booths along the edges. Seats around 50 max, and not great for big groups (like 6 or more).   The ramen was good, very flavorful and rich broth. I got the jinya tonkotsu black, and it's a pork and chicken broth that wasn't too oily like some ramen broths can get. The only complaint I had was that I got a ton of noodles but not enough broth. Also, the char siu pork wasn't as fatty as I'd like, and it was cut into thin flat strips (I like thicker cuts). It did fall apart easily though, showing it was slow cooked for a long time. The whole egg was perfectly cooked (soft yolk inside but not runny).   My party got the fried shrimp balls which were the absolute best I've ever had!! The fried crust had just a touch of sweetness (tasted like cane sugar?) & nuts, the shrimp paste inside was a mix of minced shrimp and chopped shrimp, so there were larger pieces of shrimp in there. there was also some of the spicy mayonnaise dipping sauce in the shrimp ball too, making it super moist and delicious.   We also got the tempura Brussels sprouts which was a miss. Had a touch of black truffle oil & salt, but it didn't come with the typical tempura dipping sauce which I like. I didn't like the taste of black truffle oil with the Brussels sprouts. truffle oil already has an almost bitter, savory taste and Brussels sprouts do too, so it was a bit too much for me.   Four stars was mainly because the music was too loud! The bass was pounding away and I had to semi shout to chat with the others I was eating with. It was so annoying that we were in and out in 35 minutes, and didn't really get to sit and savor everything.   Service was friendly. The women's bathroom was super high tech Japanese. flushing the toilet takes some time because I had to figure out how to flush it. You flush it by pressing a tiny round button on the side of the bowl. I don't like touching toilets (I usually flush by pressing my foot down on the flushing handle), so this was gross for me. But I appreciated the super high tech toilet, just too bad it's not in my home for me to personally enjoy (tmi!)"}
{"text":"Newly opened restaurant, so definitely a few kinks to work out. The first problem is the shortage of wait staff and delayed seating of patients. We waited approximately 10 minutes for a table for 4, even though there was an empty table available the whole time we waited.  A party of 2 walked out since they were also waiting, but several 2 seat options were available the whole time they waited as well.... So efficiency and customer service definitely needs some work!  The restaurant decor is modern with wood paneling.  They also have a large family dining style table in the center, good for a large group.  One thing lacking is lunch service...I think they are missing out financially by starting their service at 3pm....   In regards to appetizer options, I would say Jinya ranks #1 of the ramen restaurants (even over Monta Chaya) for the variety of offerings.  The pork belly buns are $3.80 each or $3 during HH 3-5PM.  The pork belly is extremely tender and flavorful and the bun is nice and fluffy (pretty much like Peking duck but pork belly inside).  We also tried the truffle oil tempura brussel sprouts which were tasty but I've had better brussel sprouts (i.e. Yonaka).  The crispy chicken (comes in 5,10,15 piece orders) was extremely moist and had a nice crispy exterior, paired with a yuzu soy sauce. I would definitely order the chicken again.  I was a little disappointed when we sat down and the waiter started listing off multiple items they had run out of (i.e takoyaki, shrimp toast, assari ramen, etc).  Not really a good start with half the menu items missing or unavailable =(  I'm a takoyaki fiend, so I was very sad to hear they ran out.  The waiter informed us that the shrimp toast is being removed from the menu....not sure why, since he said it was delicious.  In terms of ramen, the following are my rankings for Vegas: 1. Kogashi ramen with thick noodles (Fukumimi) 2. Tonkatsu black with thick noodles (Jinya) 3. Tonkatsu with thick noodles (Monta)  The tonkatsu broth at Jinya has depth of flavor and the broth is very hearty.  I prefer the broth here over Monta, since Monta can often be too salty.  I ordered the tonkatsu black which has garlic oil and chips, chili paste, a whole seasoned egg, nori, kikurage (fungus), green onion, nori,  The flavor marriage of these items makes the broth stand out and I would say the broth is on par with Fukukimi's broth, albeit different.  The pork belly is not quite as fatty as Monta's,  but is flavorful and tender similar to Fukumimi's.   The one thing that leaves Jinya at #2 in my rankings, is the consistency of the noodles.  My noodles were slightly overcooked and some noodles were clumped together in a ball....  Hopefully, they work that out, since I think the consistency of the noodles is very important to the ramen experience.  A nice touch is the raw garlic that is free, they bring over a garlic press so you can have fresh pressed garlic to your hearts content.   The wait time for the ramen was about 15-20 minutes after our appetizers...they are definitely lacking the efficiency of Monta.  However, if you want to sit and chat, this is the place to go.  You never feel like they are rushing you out of the restaurant.   I'll definitely be back to try this place out in another month or so, I'm guessing things will be even better then!"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place!!! I've been to a few ramen places since and it just doesn't compare. Going again tonight to get my fix...;)"}
{"text":"I've been here twice. I like that it's open late, relatively affordable, has parking, and that they have one vegetarian and one vegan (ramen) option that are tasty.  I tried a few vegetarian appetizers but wasn't into them much."}
{"text":"We ordered the no.1 and 2 ramen (cha cha cha), which were pretty good, and comparable to kinton and sansotei. The karaage and sprout tempura were too salty tho. The decor and atmosphere felt like a sports bar just without TVs, a bit off to me personally."}
{"text":"Everything you want out of a ramen place. The menu includes a variety of styles to satisfy most dietary preferences.   Went there on a weekend so there was a bit of a wait to be seated which is reasonable. Service was quick. 4 instead of 5 because not much knowledge of the menu was answered when I was asking questions and the appetizer was whatever. But this is a ramen place so I'm not offended   Definitely worth a shot if you want a nice hot bowl of bad ass ramen"}
{"text":"I loooooove this place!!! Always busy, music is always blasting, had to shout to my friends all the time but it's kinda fun...   Food: 10/10 I tried the vegan option, broth is very creamy, perfect match with the silky tofu. I also tried their tayoyaki, best one I've ever had!  Environment: 8/10 Service: 8/10 friendly staff but the service is kinda slow cuz it's always busy which is understandable   I'll definitely go back, might try their Mochi ice cream during happy hour!"}
{"text":"the food was great and the service was amazing major shout out to my boy adam!!! thank you adam youre the best!!!!!!   definitely coming back again!!!               adam is g.o.a.t"}
{"text":"Maybe ramen really is the new pizza!  It's kind of mind blowing how I was dying for just one legit ramen joint in Las Vegas only a few years back and now I could do a week straight without going to the same spot.  I'd also have to chug 500 gallons of water during said week but still....  I was looking for a basic, no frills ramen and their \"Tonkotsu Assari\" fit that bill perfectly.  Our server also mentioned it was his favorite.  Assari consisted of pork broth, chashu, green onion, egg and bean sprouts, but the thick noodles were the clincher for me.  Most of Jinya's ramen offerings come with thin noodles which I am usually not down with although I didn't ask if they would substitute.    It's a good thing they put me at a corner table since I slurped my face off.  From top to bottom, it was solid through and through.  There is better chashu to be had in town, but this was still a nice bowl of satisfaction.  I'd also skip the salad (dressing was gross) plus gyoza add-on and opt for another tapas dish instead.    To my knowledge, Jinya is also the first and only spot in Vegas to do takoyaki the right way.  I've had so many awful versions of it since moving from Japan that I had given up hope.  I was delirious after my first bite!  The light crunch, generous chunks of octopus with its signature sauce, mayonnaise and dried bonito flakes put my taste buds on another planet.  It was a terrific dish that I will be having multiple times in the future.  Love that they're open until 3am!!    Good call with giving only the ladies the nice Toto toilet.  :P"}
{"text":"Just barely off campus (the strip), but very worth the drive / cab ride. Great prices. Very tasty ramen & curry. This is our 5th or so visit. Was nice to see a line waiting for them to open. Places like this should succeed."}
{"text":"Second time coming here and I absolutely love it. Came here a few days ago with my friend for happy hour. We started off with a couple glasses of Sapporo and the salmon mini tacos. Afterwards, we got the Sukiyaki ramen and Tonkatsu Spicy ramen. They were both really yummy. For dessert, we got the Panna Cotta and omg, it was the yummiest panna cotta I've ever tasted.  Food and service was both great. There's usually a long line to be seated, but I would say this place is worth the wait."}
{"text":"This is a definitely one of the best ramen place I've tried and usually I'm just meh about ramen. I'll keep this short.  Get the chachacha ramen - it's not so garlicky, it's pretty mild in garlic taste You get to crush fresh garlic into you ramen and adjust the garlic flavour yourself Rich full and savoury broth - unlike any soup base from any ramen place I've been to A little pricey around $15.25 (the more expensive ramen option in their menu) Huge portion (You won't be left hungry after) Comes with a seasoned egg (although I wish they cooked it a little bit more runny)   I'm craving this while I'm typing this."}
{"text":"If I had to say one thing about Jinya, it's that it's got a great ambience!   The music is somewhat loud, but usually has a nice beat. All of the wait staff I've had were girls and I've never seen a guy on the floor yet, and are mostly cute. The workers at the counter yell out \"ITTERASSHAI!\"(\"Welcome\" in Japanese\"), and the server was spot-on and attentive when it came to taking the order.  Now came the food, the food was alright. Nothing spectacular in comparison to the other ramens I've had over at Miso-ya and Sora. The broth is a lot lighter, which a lot of people might like and appreciate more than me who is a fan of heavier-flavored broths and giant pieces of tender char-siu :,,: Don't get me wrong though, the pork was delicious and tender, but the pieces were much more generous over at Sora.   In this highly competitive, emerging market of Ramen and Japanese food in Vegas, Jinya stood out with its appeal rather than amazing food. I enjoy eye-candy myself though."}
{"text":"Same as I wrote before. Made an exception for the vegan ramen for me when it was off menu. Beer and sake was really good. That broth alone with have you coming back for more!"}
{"text":"One of the best ramen bars in Vegas! I've recently stopped eating pork and it was so hard for me to say goodbye to my favorite ramen place: Ramen Sora (since their broth is pork based) but I absolutely LOVE how Jinya also has chicken and both vegan and veggie broth selections! Now I can still get my ramen fix, woohoo!   Their salmon poke tacos are the best, which is a must try especially if you go during their Happy Hour. The ambience feels very modern and doesn't feel like a traditional ramen place - they have one huge table in the middle that can seat large groups or different parties at one time as well as booths and a seating bar that leaves a lot of space for people to sit at (versus other small ramen shops).   My bf & I usually order their chicken ramen bowl with thick noodles instead of thin and today we tried their spicy creamy vegan ramen and OH MAN, that is our new favorite!!   Definitely go here if you're looking for some good ramen especially late at night since they close at 3am which is another huge plus!"}
{"text":"The egg in the noodle is cold and yolk inside is running texture which isn't good. But egg is flavoured which more like original Japanese style.  Broth is rich but with heavy soy sauce flavour inside. Noodle is ok, amount is decent, price isn't. Have to mention their service is terrible, I almost yell in the crowd to get a bill, many servers passed by many many times BUT still didn't hear me or see my fast waving hands!! It made us feel the servers don't know what to do so just pretend to be very very busy and they were hiding in their own world with deep thinking, instead of checking their tables!  In such a small space with less than 20 tables, they have a way TOO many servers and none of them pay attention to customers requires. The host at the front even used her mirror to check her makeup and the lips in front of a long waiting line. Didn't she feel it should be done in washroom instead of over 15 waiting customers staring at her?? Waited for 10mins, Their manager had to come and give us the bill and she showed unsatisfied face and corrected the server in front of us... which is not professional at all, manager seems know how to serve professionally but doesn't know how to train and manage her team at all! So far, noodle taste is ok 3/10 Service is poor 1/10 Overall 2/10 Conclusion: even its 2 mins away from my house, but since I could cook better noodle soup and not have to wait in a nonsense restaurant, I will either try other Ramen place or cook at home. No desire to visit again."}
{"text":"I ate at Jinya the first time last night.  Came home started vomiting and diarrhea.  Whatever was in their food made me really sick.  Will never return!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent ramen spot! Food is delicious and they get it to quick, no matter how busy they are! The dishes are all so flavorful and of course they make sure to prepare your ramen to your liking, along with any extras you decide to add.   Expect a long wait if you go for dinner but try their food once and you'll know.   Great vibe and atmosphere; it can get pretty crowded on here but it's all part of the ambience."}
{"text":"This ramen bar would have gotten all five stars from me had it not been for the extensive wait to be sat. I have frequently been back for the sake of trying more of their items. The cauliflower appetizer is delectable! The sweet potato fries are delicious as well. Gyoza order is too much for one person, but still worth to order even if its just you. The ramen itself is quite tasty. I love the additional noddles for your left over broth! Usually, I have the spicy chicken, but have come to ADORE the vegan spicy ramen. WOW. Great flavored broth and thick noodles with plenty of options to add! I say you should eat here at least once. Make sure you have time to spare to be sat. Even if you are sat, sometimes they run out broth which again, adds to your wait time. Still worth it though!"}
{"text":"Really, really good food at a good price. The place is small inside, so there might be a wait for a table, but it is worth it. Got the chicken ramen and this pork ramen. Both were \"spicy\" which is medium heat. They were delicious"}
{"text":"i think i found my favorite ramen place here in Vegas! Before it was Ramen Sora, now Jinya introduced me to a very delicious and flavorful broth! Ohhhh gosh when i had my first sip of the broth i told myself \"this is my ramen bar\" lol... The flavor was very balanced! It wasn't salty at all! I totally recommend this place to ramen lovers! The place was really cute and rustic and the service was very good! Please keep it up! I'm actually loving it! ;) also the good thing about this place they're open til 3am!!! Unlike other ramen places here closes so early! I can see industry people eating and drinking here after work. Thank you for the good experience jinya! ;)"}
{"text":"With all the hype of the amount of reviews you would think they would be able to refill your water since they only had 12 customers and 3 servers. The button mushrooms were large and too hard to eat in a warm base soup, the tofu was soggy and the chicken was cold. The edamame was the best to snack on with ponzu and hot sauce. Hit or miss with this place"}
{"text":"JINYA ramen bar gets major points for being open til 3 AM on a Wednesday. I can't really think of better food after a long night of clubbing and boozing. The ramen was very good although not as good as ramen sora in my opinion. I did a combo with the tonkotsu ramen plus Gyoza and salad. the service was also really good here, next time I want to try their cha cha cha garlic ramen."}
{"text":"We had lunch, here, this afternoon.  I had the spicy miso, she had the cha cha cha.  Both were satisfying and hit the spot on this chilly day!  I especially like the free \"fresh\" garlic that comes with a mincer on the side.  She, on the other hand, does not appreciate my addiction to garlic, afterwards.   We also had the gyoza, which were good.  Had a little of griddle char on them that you could distinctly taste, but wasn't overpowering.   Good lil joint for a quick fix."}
{"text":"Really, really good stuff served by friendly folks in a super busy atmosphere. I love the tonkatsu black... Pretty good beer list for a ramen place too. I'm staying away from the cha-cha garlic whatever... three different servers tell me it's the worst thing on the menu. Don't sleep on the appetizers - shrimp balls and crispy kale are awesome too. Get there at 11:30 for lunch, or you'll be waiting 20-30 minutes."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good. I never would have known or seen this place if a friend didn't tell about it. I ordered their Cha Cha Cha which boasts a very garlic flavor. The first thing I noticed was how fatty and thick their soup was. Granted, ramen is supposed to be fatty and thick so it definitely accomplished that! But I got full too fast and couldn't enjoy much if anything else. Their chicken wings were good and crispy. But the #1 item for me was their almond tofu pudding. It was so light and refreshing!! I would come back just for that! Its a must try!"}
{"text":"SOOOOO DISAPPOINTED!!!!!   I've been going to this restaurant for years in NYC.  I moved to Vegas and it's just been terrible every time I go.  There is LITERALLY ONE GIRL being the hostess and the waitress for the WHOLE restaurant.  The AC is terrible and this is VEGAS! People in a long ass line waiting....she would disappear for 5-10 minutes at a time taking care of all the other patrons taking orders and checking out tabs.  Like really??  We can't find someone else to hire???  The ramen is good but not that good.  I'd rather go to Ohjah Noodle House on S Durango where they're attentive, the atmosphere is comfortable and the food is just as good!  Get it together Jinya....you're losing quality clients!!!!"}
{"text":"You gotta come early if you want to eat here. The place gets really packed with people on waiting list. Sometimes you'll end  up sitting in a community table with bunch of strangers next to you but no problem if this is your kind of scene, unless you'll get lucky to be seated in a limited small table or the bar. You have to speak up when you're ready to order coz this place has a fast pace. Then comes the food, it's just plain delicious comforting goodness! I could eat this everyday. We will definitely be back. Highly recommended!!!"}
{"text":"This is my go-to ramen place. They have late hours and a solid menu. They are always so busy so sometimes it's a nuisance to wait in line but their food is always worth it. Their service is awesome 97% of the time; they have a couple waiters that aren't the best but they're not terrible. They have one vegan ramen that I would recommend to everyone (spicy creamy vegan). Their jinya buns are delicious and they've recently added these \"tacos\" that are delicious. They have a happy hour that starts at 11pm, I believe, where certain things are half price."}
{"text":"This extended weekend had been full of good eats, let's see if we can keep the streak going and what better place to do that than at the newly opened Cali transplant, Jinya Ramen Bar.    Jinya is located close to the hustling and bustling Vegas area with tourist and local traffic alike, just off Decatur and Flaming-O, away from the compettion on Spring Mountain.  Upon arrival, the place looked closed and includes a drive through that is not functional and uncertain if and when it will be up and running.  You will find the entrance on the Eastside of the building, trust me, it's there.  (Shouts to Downtown Cocktail Lounge's secret door)  Once we got in, it totally looked like and had the feel of a bar, only that you are taking shots of tonkotsu broth.   Actually, I took a peek at the alcohol menu and it was respectable.  Problem was the place reminded me of that \"dark dining\" phenomenon all over NYC cause it made me want to refund my Lasik work.  Hard to order when you can't see, just saying. Cool Victorian loop style light bulbs that were totally ineffective to say the least.  Somehow, the wifey was able to see done good friends and fellow Yelp elitists, Laurie and Derek, that did liven up the mood.   Oh yeah, weird to the wise... don't get  stuck with your dominant eating arm against the wall of you are seated in the tandem mini booth unless you want bruises.  It's tiny and requires an Orbitz baby seat to get in and out.   When it was time to order, I was saddened to learn that they were out of the tonkotsu asuri.  Not only that the shrimp toast and takoyaki was nowhere to be found as well.  So I opted for the Tokyo Tonkotsu Special, but to top it off (or lack of topping it off), Jinya was out of eggs too!  Kinda turning out yo be more like Jipya instead of Jinya!  I was slowly starting to think that the opening may have been premature.   The waitress was pleasant and from Hawaii.  She could easily tell we were too but is still subject to the same brutal scrutiny (if warranted) just line everyone else.  Oh girl just needs to expand her knowledge on the craft beer menu, but she got redemption by showing me each if the bottles and cans up close to get the real deal Holyfield.  The food came out rather quick and I gave it the broth test right off the bat and the verdict is...manslaughter, cause man did I slaughter the ish out the bowl, maybe it's because I hadn't eaten since breakfast at Rise and Shine this morning.  The flavor that stood out profoundly to me was the bonito flakes and the thick noodles was a Nice touch.  I can't Complain about the chashu though, the chicken chashu too.  I wonder if it is a stretch to say it rivals Monta's melt in yo mouth chashu?!? Not to mention we got double the chashu since they were out of everything we initially wanted.  The spicy shrimp tempura was mediocre at best, not traditional by any stretch of the imagination.  The mayo sauce, ehhhh not a fan, but the skrimpz were big but it still reminded me of buffet style and not impressive at all.  The seaweed Salad had more vegetable greens than seaweed and the pork belly bowl tasted a lot like rinsed adobo.  The wifey said the spicy chicken ramen was delicious though, you know what they say, happy wife, happy life.  What they lacked in menu items, they sure made up for in Cool Japanese craft beer and double chashu.  Some new interesting brews seen for the first time included, Yona Yona ale and Coedo Shikkoku, but went with the Suiyoubi No Neko.  No I'm not bi and yes I have a neck, but true translation is \"Wednesday (humpday) Cat,\" a Belgian style white that was especially good on Saturday chased down with almond pudding for dessert.  Oh yeah, they played good music that prompted me to give them a score of 3.2, would been a whole point higher had they dished out what we wanted.  Hopefully, the next round will get me editing this review in a positive way."}
{"text":"The Tonkotsu Black Ramen is our favorite. Always craving for it. I tried the Cha Cha Cha and it's really filling because  side of the thick noodles, but the  black ramen is tastier compared to this. Service is good. Another good thing about this ramen bar is its family friendliness...the kid's meal consists of a lot of food choices for the kids and for an affordable price of $7,  just check out their online menu to see what's included in the kid's meal. This is our new favorite ramen place even if it's quite far from our house."}
{"text":"Tapas are all amazing! I've tried almost all of the ramen and they are all great. Favourites are the Sprouting Up ramen, and the Spicy Vegan ramen (which is so creamy)."}
{"text":"Tl;Dr: Although they were busy, their service and food were on point. Props to the team.  Food: I had the Tokyo Tonkatsu and have to say it tasted great. The broth was quite flavorful. It had a great consistency which not only could you taste but could also observe if you let sit too long and cool, it would start to congeal. A good sign in my opinion. The jinya bun was also great. I dont think the kewpie Mayo is necessary when the chashu is so good by itself. The piece of pork would melt in your mouth when you bit into it, both in the Jinya bun and the ramen. Excellent! The crushed garlic was a nice free addition which I welcomed. The noodles were were good but I would probably try the thick ones to compare to make a better judgement.  Price: a tad on the pricey side, but it is good ramen.  Seating: small restuarant, and be prepared to wait .  Service: Great!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, but long line because it is very popular. It is really worth the wait though, I recommend the chicken wonton ramen."}
{"text":"Don't come too hungry. The one bothersome quality about JINYA is that there's usually a line.  As with most of the ramen shops in town, this place gets crowded quickly and you have to be patient while waiting to be seated.  Other than that, JINYA is solid as a rock.  I am a fan of their Tonkotsu Black Ramen as well as the Wonton Chicken Ramen, which I just discovered on my last visit.    And I always order the thick noodles with their scrumptious waviness; if you want these type of noodles, make sure you specify when you place your order.  As usual, I prefer to sit at the bar if available, but probably not feasible if you're with more than two other people.   If you don't want ramen, there are salads, small plates, mini tacos, and rice bowls available.  The comfort food I crave especially when winter hits, come here to get some noodles and have a slurping good time."}
{"text":"Can't believe I missed reviewing about jinya after going to this place multiple times. Many people I know always recommend this place for some good ramen. Even though it's really hot in Vegas to be eating noodles preferably go to jinya to make it worth a while.  Jinya has daily happy hour starting 10pm Til closing. Many of their selections in the happy hour menu is appetizer. My go to order for ramen is the \"Jinya Tonkatsu black\" ramen. Very rich taste of the broth and delicious pork. Noodles are very well textured with the soup. I would say this place is by far my only favorite spot to get ramen."}
{"text":"Oh jinya how I love thee, let me count the ways...  1- tasty ramen 2- takoyaki 3- perfect nitamago  4- ikezo peach wine 5- the best bathroom in ever 6- garlic garlic garlic  I could go on and on..... Before I start I have to mention the bathroom. It literally was the reason I ever decided to come here for the first time ever. And is the highlight of each and every visit. You think I'm joking?? Just come here and pay a visit to the loo. You'll get it. First thing you'll notice is how dim and zen like it is. Then as you approach toilet, the lid slowly lifts and the blue lights come on as if to say \"welcome\". Then some type of mist comes on and toilet is rinsing itself for a couple of seconds. When you sit down, every bit of stress and tension leaves you all because the seat is WARM.  Oh man oh man... The rest you can figure out for yourself, just know the bidet is customizable for front and back, fast or slow....  Ok now for the food, Let me start by mentioning the tonkatsu broth. The broth here is outstanding, it's complex with a depth of flavor that can only be gotten from a loooong time cooking. It was rich and soothing and not overly salty.   I ordered the tonkatsu black (ramen with black garlic oil) and added a few cloves of freshly pressed garlic. Wow. Just wow. The fresh garlic subtly changed the fragrance and taste of my ramen in a sublime way. It wasn't overpowering but definitely pronounced. In my bowl I asked for an extra egg as they are perfectly done and taste fabulous. Spicy bean sprouts and extra mushrooms went in there too. The noodles are perfectly cooked leaving just the right amount of chew and texture.   The takoyaki was perfectly executed, cooked crisp, light and fluffy with the perfect amount of octopus in each ball. They serve it on an egg salad bed (which seemed strange at first but it totally went together and seemed to even bring out the wonderful flavor of the balls) and garnished with green onion and bonito strands.   The ikezo drink was interesting- it was like a peach sparkling wine which turned jelly like after it was poured in the glass. Very different at first but it was a fun drink. I wish there were other favors though....  Service can be iffy here. Sometimes you get someone super attentive and aware while other times you get someone disconnected unaware and oblivious to customers needs.    I knew immediately during my last visit that the place had a new manager- longer hours, the music was louder, vibe was different, workers were different and they were at capacity when I came for a late lunch. This was confirmed by an employee after I asked. I'm glad they're busier now than before but I'm not sure if I enjoy the new loud music hipster kind of vibe. It was laid back and zen mode before, very relaxing and enjoyable. Not so much now. And it was uncomfortably hot in there. Like made me dizzy while eating hot ramen type of hot. Uncomfortable and not enjoyable.   Turn up the a/c and everything else can be ignored while I enjoy the fabulous ramen and later have my moment in the bathroom.   Food: 5 Ambience/atmosphere: 2 Service: 3 Value: 4 Overall 3.5 but excellent food along with that bathroom gave it a 4"}
{"text":"Hubby, brother and I hit up Jinya on our latest trip to Vegas.  We got there a few minutes before opening so were seated promptly when they finally opened for business.  The menu and taste was reminiscent of Ippudo (of NY and Japan fame).  They had the pork belly bun which was actually pretty tasty.  We also ordered the tempura Brussels sprouts that was highly recommended - those didn't disappoint.  And since I'm a sucker for fresh tofu, we ordered the homemade tofu, done tableside.  What a gimmick.  But ya know...? The tofu was actually really great!  If you let it sit, it becomes silky, like the Chinese sweet tofu custard dessert.  They give you a sauce and the usual ginger, green onion and added a touch of yuzu kosho (which I love).  They also instruct you to stir it up which I wasn't a huge fan of doing but in the end, it turned out fine.  You were just eating like a porridge made with tofu.  In terms of noodles, brother and I ordered the tonkotsu black.  He added corn.  I got it \"as is\".  When our orders came, mine had a small dollop of spicy in the middle and corn while his was missing the egg that comes with the tonkotsu black.  We had to show him a picture of our noodles (we're food picture takers) but he still looked at my egg suspiciously, as if we were trying to steal an extra egg.  The taste was ok...it didn't blow me away....it just didn't have the richness of Month's broth or the complexity that other places had.  The noodles were nice and hard and the eggs were just on the verge on being overcooked (still miles better than those places that give up and cook it all the way.).    Hubby ordered the tonkotsu assari which, was promised, was lighter.  I think he regretted that choice.    My combo chasu bowl was a little underflavored and dry.  Not enough sauce in the rice to season it.  The combo chicken karaage was good though they serve it to you in giant pieces.  Definitely not a bad option if you want to go through the drive through or if you don't want to wait it out at Monta.  But not our first choice for ramen in Vegas."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch. Excellent ramen and no long waiting lines like at other places in Las Vegas. They make their own gyoza and it's delicious.  Service is the best we've had at a ramen place."}
{"text":"The broth wasn't the creamy, milky consistency of tonkotsu that I'm used to. I also agree with another review that stated that the servers make you feel like you're bothering them. Our server had no personality as he never once smiled and seemed annoyed when I asked a question about the broth. The hostess, on the other hand, was very nice and friendly. I will say that the place is cute and trendy and that the pork bun was one of the best I've ever had, but overall this place isn't an option when it comes to ramen for me."}
{"text":"Literally just wrote a review 3 hours ago and thinking about this place got my taste buds going so I'm back and I brought my mom and her bf along ! We started with the shrimp balls which are so delicious then we got three spicy chicken ramen then we got the fried chicken (10piece) and can I say again bomb! They loved this place and we will definitely be regulars here and we will be back!"}
{"text":"Okay - things have definitely changed since the time I was here last summer, so I have to update! When I came last year my ramen was borderline flavourless and felt under cooked - however this time around I ordered the spicy creamy vegan ramen and I loved it! While it wasn't too spicy (which is a bonus for me, but maybe not for some people who want it super spicy), it was really creamy and didn't taste bland, like some vegetarian/vegan ramens do. The servers was also super friendly and the space itself has a really cool vibe to it, not to mention the food comes out pretty quickly, and you can see it all being made right in front of you. My only issue is that sometimes it can be really difficult to track down a server and I have had one server who wasn't as friendly as the other ones, but overall it's a really solid ramen place! (Psst - they also have a high quantity of solo people, so it's a great place to come in if you just want a quick bite to eat while you're by yourself!)"}
{"text":"So many ramen restaurants in town and they all do a good job so it's tough to tell them apart. Jinya has good appetizers and fine selection of ramen bowls. They also have a couple good rice bowls if you're not in the mood for soup.   The place is popular and crowded on weekends so you often have to sit at the communal table. Also no seats available when waiting for a table.  It has fairly loud music so more appealing to hipster vibe than intimate setting.  Jinya is a bit more pricey than other ramen spots."}
{"text":"I have been a regular at Jinya ever since they opened. This is usually a go to spot to eat at when I'm with my friends, but my last three visits have left me dissatisfied.  SERVICE  The service has always been good here. This is probably the one thing that hasn't changed.  FOOD Tonkatsu Assari: This is one of their specials and also my usual order. Since they've opened til now, I have noticed a change in the broth. About a month or so ago I noticed that the broth has looked and tasted more like MSG. My boyfriend and I liked Jinya because the broth was lighter than Monta's. A second note is that the broth also has changed in taste. I ate here last night and my broth, as well as my friend's tasted insanely sweet. Some of my noodles were also clumped together on the side and they were a little uncooked compared to the rest of my noodles. I don't know if there is a new cook or not but the ramen I crave for at Jinya just leaves me wishing I chose another place instead.  Takoyaki: Still tastes the same, but they became smaller.  Another thing that I liked about Jinya is that they are open til late. Recently however they start to run out of half of their menu items by around 9-10pm. One night I came and they were completely out of pork broth. Last night they were out of half of their ramen. I just find it strange how this use to never happen before.  Maybe it's time to go back to the old time favorite Monta?"}
{"text":"overrated ramen place visited since I didn't want to go out to the strip noodles are uncooked and their food is too salty I don't get why people are waiting to eat this will not return and I don't recommend this restaurant"}
{"text":"Loved what I had today compared to first time I was here. Soup wasn't that salty this time. I had the Cha Cha Cha. It's like an udon kind of as it has bigger noodles and it is a large soup and chunky noodles so if you're hungry, you better try this one. Also had the Jinya Bun. So delicious. Wine isn't very chilly though but loved their dessert. Forgot what it's called. Only remember it starts in letter P. No waoting area so you got to stand outside. Best time to come in is about 3-4pm when it's not that busy."}
{"text":"* When we got there and seated, the waiter had a \"I hate my job\" vibe. When she gave us our Jinya bun, she basically just threw it on the table. The restaurant just didn't really have a friendly environment. Which, is probably affecting my reviewing rate quite a bit.   * The Jinya Bun tasted good, but it tasted like any other siopao. For $3, I guess that would be reasonable for any bun. We ordered the spicy chicken ramen and the original chicken ramen. The noodles had a different kind of texture that aren't typical for noodles. It reminded me of potato noodles, which are really good. The ramen itself, filled enough for one person, which is enough for us because we ordered 2.   * The prices ranged around $10-$20. I believe the noodles I ordered were around the price of $11-$12   * Would I go there again? Yeah, I think I would, to try the other kinds of ramen they have. As for the service, that's something they should probably work on. I'm not going back for the good service, but the good food.   * Rate: 6/10 * Price: $$"}
{"text":"Ambiance is great, food is good, price is okay. Will come back but it's on the high end price for a ramen noodles for me."}
{"text":"As this is a popular chain in the States, I was excited to check this place out! It was busy during dinner time, so we had to wait approx. half hr for a table for 3 and there wasn't a lot of waiting space. I Once we were finally seated, the entire place cleared out, so I would say a good time to go without any waiting is like 7:30ish. I noticed right away that each table had a little 'sauce' station which included hot sauce, gyoza sauce and soy sauce, which I thought was pretty neat!   My girlfriends and I got a couple of appies as well as their one and only cocktail, the lychee drink. It was a simple, yet very tasty drink! We got the salmon poke tacos, crispy chicken (karraage) and salmon cilantro sashimi. The salmon poke tacos were unreal! While it was a little messy, I loved the crispy wonton shell! I could definitely eat like a whole plate of those. For the crispy chicken, you can choose between 5/10/15 pieces and they are pretty generous on the portion sizes. For 5 pieces, the plate was pretty big and full, so I would recommend you share with someone.   As for the ramen, not only were SO many options to choose from (chicken, pork AND veggie broth) but you can customize the ramen in any way you like! There was huge list of extra toppings you can add and you can also customize the noodle thickness (they even have spinach noodles!), which was cool! Also I would like to add that this is the first place I've ever see VEGAN ramen! I really like how inclusive this place is trying to be.   As for us, we all ended up getting the cha cha cha ramen just because we've been hearing a lot of good reviews (and it also sounds amazing). You can also make your ramen a combo and choose a side and salad. I choose gyoza and was very happy with them, they cooked perfectly and were full of flavour! The ramen itself was delicious, especially the broth!! Super garlicky and I love spice so I added the hot sauce and it made it even better. Every table also gets fresh garlic as well as their own garlic press so you can add garlic to your ramen if you want! I wish they served the ramen in a bigger bowl because it was pretty overcrowded and it was hard to mix everything without it getting everywhere. I don't know if it was just me, but I found their noodles to be a TAD too soft and it was easy for it to become a little mushy pretty quickly. We finished everything off with some mochi ice-cream (green tea & chocolate, you can get one of each if you like) and they were great!! They're cut up if you would like to share, but I don't know why you would, they're just too good.   From the first couple of reviews I read complaining about the service, it looks like they noticed and upped their game because we had multiple people come in and check in on us. Overall, it was a lively vibe and great little joint. I'd check it out if you're around."}
{"text":"I always like this place. The menu is kinda small but they change it up often. Open super late & phone-in take out is cool too."}
{"text":"Ok food but the worst servers. Ramen wasnt out for 40 minutes. When we asked one server she said it was coming out irresponsibly and went away. Asked another server after 5 more minutes of wait and that server said my order was going in then when everybody who came in after me got their orders. I paid for my drink and came out, didn't even receive a proper apology. Wasted my time. Uncaring servers."}
{"text":"Tried most of the top rated ramen places (according to fellow yelpers) and I'd have to say JINYA is my top choice and my new go-to spot.   Sora is not too far behind and Monta is always a all-time favorite.   Can't go wrong with any of these 3 ramen spots IMO.   I had their Tonkatsu Black, added corn and butter. It was a nice change of taste. Ramen noodles, perfect texture, broth on point and enough spice to enjoy. Also tried their pork belly bun and that was also pretty damn good too. Their Crispy Chicken was also flavorful and not dry.  They have unique seating and can get crowded during peak hours.   Overall a good experience. Highly recommend and will be back!"}
{"text":"The ramen was cold  But your tattoos were smokin  Las Vegas Thursday   -A. Pinault"}
{"text":"Finally made the time to try this place. Great food and great service. Food came out fast. I tried their special of the day. It was good. I can now taste the difference in flavors between Monta and Jinya. Jinya has bolder flavors in their broth. Monta has a light and cleaner broth. I like bold flavors. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"The service was fine, you can say. However, the food wasn't satisfying and was more disappointing. And it's expensive, so I don't find this to be worth it."}
{"text":"Hands down my new favourite ramen place. The food here is delicious. Everything we tried was good. The staff was so accommodating of my allergies. The head chef came out and talked to me forever until we figured out how I could get my ramen fix without a trip to the hospital. So I ended up with the Pork Tonkatsu Black with Vegan broth. (Sesame and shellfish free) It was amazing.  I really appreciated his going the extra mile for me.  They also serve beer and have this super tasty crispy chicken appetizer.  The restaurant was popping for late lunch on a Thursday, but the food was worth the wait. Can't wait to go back and try some of the other dishes."}
{"text":"This is our second time coming here. My wife and I are plant based and they have have meals for people like us. The service is always good and so is the food. You will wait like 30-45 minutes on Friday/Saturday night but worth the wait. They do not accept reservations over the phone"}
{"text":"Yessss.  I finally found a ramen place here I LOVE.   Came at about 2pm on a Monday which is obv not a busy time but that works out for us. Got a table right away. Small and intimate with a community table in the middle.   Good selection of ramen and appetizers as well as a small plates. And a little happy hour.   Service was good and easy. I ordered the spicy chicken ramen with thin noodles. Added a bunch of extras like mushrooms, corn, nori, and fried onions. All $1 but totally worth it because the soup was filled with the extras I ordered. I even planned to order the extra noodles toward the end for $1.60 but I was full. The portions are big and he broth was so flavorful. I had left over for the next day.   The price came to about 20.00 each for our ramens with the extras which is a little pricey but honestly worth it to me because it was a delicious meal."}
{"text":"Another amazing ramen place in vegas WITH VEGAN OPTIONS. Ive only had the spicy creamy vegan ramen here but its one of a kind. It has so much flavor and automatically comes with the thicc noodles. I would be down to eat this ramen everyday. All of the other food looks amazing too. The only downside is the wait because of limited seating however the service is fast and efficient! The food doesn't take so long to come out."}
{"text":"I have previously visited this spot frequently, and liked it. Tonight, I called at 2:10am, they told me last call was at 2:30am when they close at 3a. We rushed to get dressed and sped over. We walked in at 2:29am and they refused our business because of \"last call\". Had they said on the phone last call would be before 230, I wouldn't have bothered. Extremely disappointed and will never be back. Lazy staff."}
{"text":"This place has great service its what really impressed me. It was our first time here and they helped us as first timers to choose something to introduce us to Jinya ramen. We started with the crispy shrimp ball it was really good I really recommend it as an appetizer. For our entree we got the spicy chicken ramen and you can choose how spicy from mild medium and hot and also the wanton chicken ramen which was really good I was afraid it wouldn't fill me up because it's soup but it actually is satisfying and filling."}
{"text":"I only came here for the fancy Japanese toilet...and I wasn't disappointed.  I ordered my food and then discreetly slipped away to the little girl's room.  I was trying very hard not to skip or run but that's how excited I was.  I got inside and locked the door behind me and approached the glorious throne and to my surprise the lid flung open and lights and water mists beckoned me to come and sit.  I popped a squat and heard a chorus of angels as the toasty sensation enveloped my buns.     Went on Saturday 4-23-16 at 12PM for lunch.  $35.37 got us two bowls of ramen, a salad, two drinks, and a brussel sprout appetizer.   I got the tonkotsu assari ramen for $8.80 and added corn for an additional dollar.  The broth was perfect and I love the tiny bit of spice they put on the top.  I wish there was one more piece of chasu because the piece that was in there was wonderful.  My only issue (and this may be a personal preference) was that the egg was refrigerator-cold on the inside.  When the tamago is hot on the outside and cold on the inside it is so gross to me.    The baby leaf salad was a steal for $3.80 and covered in the most delicious garlicky dressing.  The fried brussel sprouts were wonderful, too! I was able to snag a wonton from my dining partner's ramen and it was marvelous.   Come for the fancy potty, stay for the tasty ramen."}
{"text":"The food was delicious! We enjoyed the cauliflower and tempura brussel sprouts appetizers... And I had the Tokyo Yatai Ramen, loved the fried onions and the egg was cooked perfectly. The only complaint I had was that the service was a bit slow and nothing spectacular. I'd come back to try more apps and flavored of ramen!"}
{"text":"I haven't been here in a couple years, but I had fond memories from before. I don't know what happened since then.  First of all, service was great - super friendly, super cute, no complaints. That being said, the food left much to be desired. I love raw salmon, but the salmon tacos were pretty basic and overall bland. It lacked a depth of flavor and was simply uninteresting and forgettable.  I sat at the end of the bar where there was a constant chill from either the hallway or front door, which I didn't mind because I was expecting a piping hot bowl of ramen. However, when I received the recommended \"Cha cha cha\" the broth was only lukewarm, the center of my egg was still cold, and although I appreciated the thicker cuts of chashu, the meat was also lacking in temperature to the point that the fat was still almost solid. I also had to dig through a mountain of bean sprouts just to get to my noodles - overkill. I may be nit picking on the sprouts, but after everything else... just saying.   The restaurant was far from full capacity at the time and still had a few hours left before closing time, so quality control should not have been an issue. I have NEVER left half a bowl of ramen uneaten before. Starting to think that the lines out the door are because this place is trendy and open late, and not because of the food. I departed supremely disappointed, and worst of all... still hungry."}
{"text":"Wow! I am elated that my friend introduced me to this amazing ramen bar. Firstly, you know this place leaves something to be desired when you arrive fairly early to beat the rush and the line is already out the door. The ambiance is really cozy and it must be said that the restroom was very clean. We ordered Jinya Buns, Sprouting Up Ramen, Jinya Chicken Ramen, and Spicy Umami Miso Ramen with Gyoza. The ingredients used were very fresh and our meals arrived hot and delicious. Their menu had a variety of appetizing dishes and I cannot wait to savor more of what they have to offer. I highly recommend this ramen bar for those who want to try ramen for the first time and for those wanting to satisfy their ramen craving. We will most certainly be back soon."}
{"text":"Singlehandedly my FAVORITE ramen bar and in my top 3 places to eat, EVER. I come here at least once a week and have been coming for at least a year. It's always worth the wait, and better for date night or 4 people max. Service is always super quick. I usually stick to the same order, The Spicy Chicken Ramen, but have tried other ramen and haven't had one I didn't like. If you haven't gone here yet, you're seriously missing out!"}
{"text":"Best Ramen in Calgary! I love this place, everything is delicious!"}
{"text":"Came back and had the vegan ramen. It was worth the sodium hangover. So good! My partner is new to ramen and had something with a lot of meat in it - he really enjoyed it as well. The only annoying thing is how close you have to sit to other people. It's super cramped even when it's not extremely busy."}
{"text":"Ramen With A Modern Feel  Completely caught by surprise with this quality ramen restaurant. Jinya offers quality ramen at a reasonable price.  The broth is a bit more 'porky' or 'meaty' than other ramen bars. What makes this place unique are it's appetizer and side dishes. The venue is small and dark with a modern feel. A must if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Food was good, it was pretty crowded when we were here so it took around 30 minutes to get seated. The cup that was given to me to pour my beer in was full of unknown black stuff. Just drank it out of the bottle. Also ordered Kardama which is a fresh noodle refill when your ramen is low on noodles, but it was brought out before I could take my first bite of ramen, and was cold and congealed by the time I needed more noodles. I suspect it would be 5/5 stars at a time when it wasn't so crowded"}
{"text":"I've been to the JINYA in Houston, TX, so when I heard there was a Las Vegas location, I wanted to eat something I was familiar with from home. With that being said, chains aren't always the way to go. The consistency and quality of the Ramen broth was not there.  First off, right when we walked in, there wasn't a wait which is definitely a plus. The restaurant only had a few tables of patrons. So we were quickly seated in the corner. I noticed the table was sticky and flagged down a server to ask for napkins to wipe it down. The waitress looked at me annoyed as if I made up the story to make her like more difficult. She probably deals with tourist all the time. So I was a little empathetic. But For a half empty restaurant, customer service should be king! When she came back to take our orders she didn't even remove the dirty napkins off the table. But that's okay. I just placed it out sight in the corner.  Now to the food. I ordered the pork ramen and added some extra goodies. The food came out fairly quickly. But when I tasted my broth, it had a sour taste to it. But since the waitress already had an attitude, I decided to just add some gyoza and ponzu sauce to mask the taste. It did help with the broth. Needless to say, hours later, my stomach did not agree.  My whole experience was just not satisfactory. From the dirty table, to the unnecessary attitude, and the broth itself, I won't be returning to the Vegas location any time soon."}
{"text":"This is one of the best ramen place in Toronto. If you are hungry, get the cha cha cha. I had that around 2pm in the afternoon and didn't have to eat dinner at night. Don't ask for the extra garlic as some reviewers mentioned because they just bring the raw whole garlic and you have to use the garlic peeler to shred the garlic, it is simply too much work.   I ordered the premium white ramen the second time visited there, I found the portion was much smaller compare to cha cha cha but they used better ramen for this. The ramen tasted a bit like the Chinese egg noodles. I like this type of noodles better.   In addition, the seating and service is much better than sansotei ramen nearby."}
{"text":"The food is always terrific here and the staff is pleasant.  I love that they offer chicken ramen as most others in Vegas are only pork."}
{"text":"The first time I came here, I wasn't a fan, but I must have been having an off day because it was so much better this time! I ordered the Cha Cha Cha (garlic lovers) and it was delicious. I got to try my friends' ramens, the black, white, and spicy tonkotsu. The garlic was the best but the white and black were very tasty as well. My friend ordered the spicy at level 6 but everyone agreed there was almost no spice to the broth. The chicken wings were well cooked but weren't very flavorful. The takoyaki was great. I'm glad I gave Jinya a second chance because now I have another place to go to get my ramen fix."}
{"text":"great ramen place. got the jinya tonkotsu black ramen combo with crispy chicken & salad. my kids shared a kids ramen meal that came with a small scope of ice cream at a killer deal. my wife had the spicy chicken ramen. the employees were very friendly and helpful. we came during lunch on a weekday while hanging in Vegas. really great ramen with a good vibe."}
{"text":"Food was great, some of the service was not so great.  We walked in and I understand it was a little busy but the hostess never once greeted us, so we walked up to her and with out saying a word to us she just turned a clipboard around and walked away . We waited about 15 min to be seated, we asked for a booth but we were sat at the table . Our waitress was very nice though."}
{"text":"I was so excited for Jinya to open in Toronto but my expectations were set too high. The broth was way too salty and service was lacking. There is much better ramen in the city."}
{"text":"Best ramen I've had in a very long time. I tried it with butter and fresh garlic-amazing! I like the spicy broth but no chicken. Great portions too. It's a must try!"}
{"text":"Food was tasty, and service was good. The ambience was also good. Don't have much more to add..."}
{"text":"Wow!   Came here a couple week ago for dinner.   I'm a fan!   Honestly the best ramen I had in the city.   Parking can be a problem, wait can be a little long... but it's worth it.   Love the vibe. I'll be back."}
{"text":"The spicy ramen is way too spicy for my taste. I would almost every time cough up the spices after every bite.  There wasn't too many people here, yet our party of 5 had to wait a good 25 minutes to get our ramen.  The workers saw our frustration and they gave us 2 free mochi balls for dessert."}
{"text":"It would be nice to have an option to order half portion of the ramen. I could never finish the whole thing. I like that they have new special flavor every month. I love all their appetizers!"}
{"text":"Jinya is by far my favorite ramen spot in town. The broth has a lot of flavor but isn't as salty and overwhelming as Monta. I like their seasoned egg consistency here, it is perfectly runny.   Be sure to try the Jinya bun (pork belly bun) and the takoyaki. Best takoyaki I've ever had!  They also have happy hours with discounts on some appetizers and drinks!"}
{"text":"I'm obsessed with his place! I love the eggs in my ramen. I always order the spicy chicken ramen combo. Comes with the best fried chicken and little salad. One delivery bit.. I always ask for the soy sauce for my chicken and neverrrr get it. I still eat every drop though haha!"}
{"text":"ALWAYS amazing. Any of the ramen I've tried has been so flavorful and delicious. As long as my ramen has corn, and egg, and some nori, I'm all set at this place. Ladies, use the bathroom - it's awesome. Everyone, come hungry, but not too hungry, because there's a wait!"}
{"text":"Good ramen, they had one job and they nailed it!"}
{"text":"Out of all the Ramen shops in Vegas, Jinya is probably my favorite. After trying out most of the menu, my go-to is the Premium White Tonkotsu Ramen. However, the last time I went it was off the menu, but the waitress told me I can still order it and took care of me!"}
{"text":"I discovered this place from a couple of friends after watching Fifty Shades of Grey. (Obviously the movie pegged my appetite.. for food anyway, haha!)  Let's start off with the decor and the environment. The lighting is dim, which I didn't mind. The tables and chairs kind of bring me back to old Japan town or something. There's booth amongst the side and a HUGE table in the center - perfect for big parties  If you've ever ate at Monta Ramen then you'll notice the menu being very similar. I was recommended the spicy chicken ramen (mild) with added butter and tofu. I can handle my fair share of spiciness, but I wasn't sure how it would be here. If you rather be safe than sorry - go ahead and order a mild. They have their spicy powder available on the table for you to add to your heart's desire. The ramen was served in a huge bowl so it appeared to have larger portions than Monta Ramen (although I can't verify that). The dish was flavorful and delicious. Our friends ordered the Jinya bun that resembles a siapo (meaty, steamed bun) and creamy shrimp tempura (awesomeness on a small appetizer plate).  Now, the only reason why I rated it 4 stars was due to the fact that my side of tofu came pretty late =( The temperature heat of my noodles subsided a lot by the time I was delivered them.  Overall, I look forward to returning here. It definitely will change your view and taste palate for noodles. You'll never want to cook a packet of instant noodles ever again."}
{"text":"Slurp, slurp and slurp!!! Jinya never disappoints me. Enjoyed Chef's Special, Tokyo Tonkotsu Ramen with extra noodles, with small plates of chicken karaage & salad ($24 all together) It was perfect on a snowy   day. Menu description says Tokyo Tonkotsu has fish powder in it. That means they added hondashi ? Hondashi is basically fish based msg. Or they added bonito flakes ? I didn't taste any strong fish flavour from this pork, in fact I wouldn't even know if there was any fish powder in it if I did not read the menu carefully."}
{"text":"This place is OK compared to the ramen in Los Angeles. Their tonkatsu with black garlic oil was flavorful but it didn't have enough broth, which might have been a good thing because the broth was really thick and filling. I asked for hard thin noodles and it was perfect. Their gyoza was good, needs a little more crunch. I was not a fan of the squid ball because the crust's flavor was overpowering the flavor of the filling inside."}
{"text":"Service was slow, but food was great, friendly staff. There was no wait time we were seated almost immediately."}
{"text":"My boyfriends favorite ramen place ever so we made sure to stop by during our Vegas trip. I came here with two other people and waited about 15 minutes for a table because we didn't want to sit at the big table. I love when hosts/servers keep you updated on the status of a table when they can!   We had gyozas and a pitcher of Sapporo. Everyone ordered the tonkotsu black. The only thing I didn't like about it is the thin noodles but that's customizable so that's what I'll change next time! The egg is absolutely perfect. I love that there is fried garlic because it adds so much flavor! The broth is just to my liking. I can't wait to come back.   Oh yeah, their ladies room is really cool! make sure to check it out. My boyfriend said the men's room was nothing special tho.. LOL  And little do I know... They have jinya's in LA. So I'll make sure to check it out here too."}
{"text":"Great ramen and great service. Staff are very courteous and attentive and the atmosphere is great. My ramen was off the charts good. An added bonus was that our meal costs didn't break the bank. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I love ramen, fell in love at a spot called Jin Ramen in NYC on 125th and Broadway. Moved from NY back to LA 3 years ago and hadn't found a place I loved until today! Let me break it down   Service: the woman who seated us was nice but seemed sooooo off, almost high? Maybe she has a super chill personality but she responded \"uhhhhh\" to my questions so that rubbed me the wrong way, but overall she wasn't terrible, just odd.  Food: I ordered the white tonkatsu and made it mild. I added bok Choy and dried seaweed. Also lemon, which the server was kind enough to bring me plenty of. The ramen was AMAZING. The broth was tasty, not too salty, not too greasy. Perfect! The pork in it was tender and the egg...OMG sooo good. We also ordered the pork chashu bowl to taste. Really good as well! Seasoned to perfection and the rice had a good flavor as well.   My boyfriend ordered the spicy chicken Ramen, I tasted a bit and loved it, it is on the spicy side though.   We drank a sculpin to wash it all down.   Great experience and will definitely be coming back whenever we come to Vegas to get away."}
{"text":"Despite being very busy the host tried his absolute best to get us a table of 4 quickly.  Good thing about a place like this is no matter how busy it gets you will not wait long as ramen is a relatively quick dish to prepare and eat so seems to be quick turnaround of seats.  On to the important part, the ramen (got the Sprouting Up Ramen)...I'd say it's pretty good, maybe a B- to B.  Also tried the Pork Gyoza and these were very good, a must get.  It's close to me so will likely be back, but I think Ivan Ramen in Kensington makes a better ramen dish."}
{"text":"Without ramen, there would be chaos and darkness.  At least this is how I felt after missing out on eating breakfast during Nadine's tri-state UYE.  I've wanted to stop in this great upcoming-chain ramen joint after seeing Mike W's photos of the place.  Since it had been a windy and cold November Vegas trip, some ramen sounded perfect.  I ordered a JINYA Tonkotsu Black [$10.80 - pork broth with chashu, kikurage, green onions, dried nori seaweed, seasoned egg, garlic chips, garlic oil, fried onion, and served with thin noodles] and a JINYA Pork Bun [$3.80/ea. - thick braised pork with vegetables wrapped in a fluffy, white, steamed bun].  The table also shared JINYA No.2 Pig Ear Chicharron [$8.50 - harissa sauce, crispy kale, and a softly onsen tamago] and an order of Takoyaki [$5.20 for six].  Here's a breakdown:  JINYA Tonkotsu Black:  Delicious!  I love Japanese chashu, which is more like a roulade than the Chinese style, and kikurage [wood ear mushroom] is always fun to eat.  I regret forgetting to ask for some freshly pressed garlic but it was still delicious.  I also asked for a pat of butter for my ramen and it made the broth super rich.  Kotteri!  It had great porky flavoring to begin but I have a weakness for adding butter to my ramen.  I ended up getting full halfway into my bowl.  It had good flavor and wasn't too salty.  The egg was also beautiful softly boiled with a creamy egg yolk.  The noodles were good but I'll admit that I was staring at Nadine's thick noodles with envy.  The thin noodles were good but I want the chewy and springiness of the thick ramen noodles.  JINYA Pork Bun:  This could be dangerous.  Great flavor, good size, and a thick cut of pork belly is nestled in between some leafy greens with a generous drizzle of Kewpie mayo.  JINYA No.2 Pig Ear Chicharron:  Technically Nadine C. of YelpHI ordered this but found it too spicy for her liking.  I wasn't sure what the onsen tamago was for so I used it to dunk my fried pig ears in it.  It helped dilute the spicy hot sauce.  Not bad but I don't know if I would recommend it.  Takoyaki:  When is takoyaki ever a bad thing?  Delicious octopus balls served with some bonito flakes.  They were thick, juicy, and plump.  It even sat on a bed of this hard boiled egg custard type sauce.  Not traditional but it escalated the creaminess of the takoyaki.  I even went back after we were done eating all the takoyaki to scoop up any leftover egg on the plate with some bonito flakes.  I would definitely recommend this.  $65 for lunch for three, including tip.  Very reasonable!  Will I be back?  You know I will! I'm glad I got to try JINYA with my twinsie Nadine C. of YelpHI! Love that girl!"}
{"text":"My friends and have started to come here frequently and for good reason! The food here is delicious. I always order the same thing- the creamy vegetarian ramen (no spinach because I find it to clump together) besides that everything is perfect. The workers are very polite and attentive. The atmosphere is cool and \"hip\" especially when they dim the lighting. It's a great place to come with either a large group because of the large center table or for a date. Definitely worth the wait for a table. The wait is usually 10-15 minutes, but they do only seat you if your complete party has arrived!"}
{"text":"Great place not a lot of seating but the food is good. The average price for a bowl of ramen is $9.55 the combo is an extra $5. The service is great would recommend this place and they are open extra late."}
{"text":"Holy yum batman! My best friend brought me here because she's recently become vegan and they have an option for her. Thanks for the JINYA :) The food was damn tasty and service was good. This is going to sound crazy but really made my experience was the restroom. I'm one of those weirdos that judges a place based on their restrooms. They had a fancy Japanese toilet! I was a little too nervous to play with the other button options (the bidet wasn't on), but it was freaking cool. But oh yeah--the food is great. Eat there!"}
{"text":"Great food. Awesome customer service. The music is too loud though. They need to lower it a little."}
{"text":"This place is offers the perfect selection of ramen, appetizers, and rice dishes to choose from.  So far, I've visited approx 8 times and have tried the majority of the menu. All the food is AWESOME! Monta no longer is the only game in town when it comes to delicious ramen. My favs are the Tonkatsu Black Jinya #1, crispy karaage chicken and pork chasu rice bowl. I highly recommend this place. It's the perfect assortment of fine quality food...no overkill...just right."}
{"text":"I'm giving Jinya 3 stars based on food and service. Service was great! I ordered tonkatsu ramen with curry and salad, the bf had tonkatsu ramen with gyoza and salad, and my gma had some chicken ramen with gyoza and salad. The salad was served in chilled bowls, making it nice and refreshing. But dressing tasted like shoyu. The gyozas were good and the curry was decent. My grandma and bf liked the ramen. I didn't care for it much cause a few bites in I started to feel sick. Decided to take the rest home, figured might be too much oil for my tummy. I was right, container was filled with oil the next day. Probably be back to try other menu items, but I'll pass on ramen"}
{"text":"This place is terrible!!! Went in last week when we visited Las Vegas came in with 3 children & 3 adults.. there are tables available so my husband asked the hosted if we can split up and she asked one of her co worker and he look at us like where crazy!!! VERY RUDE server!!! He doesn't want to serve us!! But his other co worker made him too.. I hoped the management read this and talk to him!! If you have a attitude problem then you have no business in food industry!!!"}
{"text":"Tasty Sprouting Up Ramen.  The soup was a good balance of flavour and texture.  It's more expensive than other ramen places especially since there was only half an egg, with a small serving of pork and noodles.  The variety of condiments: fresh garlic, ramen sauce, hot sauce, and pepper seasoning is a bonus.  The service was friendly but it took a long time for our ramen to arrive."}
{"text":"Had the vegetarian miso and regular vegetarian ramen here. It was just ok. The regular vegetarian ramen comes with salad on top and lots of pepper which is nice. My girlfriend ordered one of the pork ones and wasn't blown away either, and the pork portion was super tiny.  Not the best place for a date because the staff yells greetings EXTREMELY loudly when every customer enters and leaves the restaurant, which is distracting. I prefer getting takeout from here for that reason. It was also very hot inside."}
{"text":"I literally eat jinya everyday. I worship their cha cha cha ramen. The blonde hostess is cool too, thanks for giving us an updated time and letting us know it'd be fairly long for a booth. Jinya keep doing you"}
{"text":"Solid ramen!!! The price point seemed a little high when compared to other ramen spots ... that was, until I was served my bowl!!! It was way more than I could accomplish in a sitting.  Ordered the spicy chicken w/ cabbage and corn. Winning dish and wish I would have ordered it hotter.  The kids meal is pretty insane also.  It comes with a child's portion chicken ramen- corn and spinach. The little boat that accompanied had two friend chicken nuggets, fries, a side of rice and teriyaki chicken, orange slice and salad. For $7.00!!! I can't wait to come back for the sticky buns!"}
{"text":"I have ordered the garlic ramen bowl Cha Cha Cha on several of occasions. It is really hit and miss as far as consistency goes. The first couple of times I had it I was left in an orgasmic trance. I found on another visit it just did not have the same flavor profile so it left me unsatisfied. I do enjoy their steamed pork buns which are always on point. The staff is super friendly and on their game which is a nice treat! I just wish my bowl of ramen would taste the same every time."}
{"text":"Our go to place for ramen in Calgary. Friendly, efficient and fast service. Fried sweet potatoes with honey dipping sauce was very good. The gyoza was excellent. Better than my wife's. The tonkotsu black was the best we've had anywhere. All together, food, service and price merit a 5 star rating from us. We'll be back. Bootcamp Breakfast Club (BBC)."}
{"text":"I visited the newest ramen place in downtown Toronto a month after it's opened. It was a Wednesday night  and it was not too crowded.  I heard the music could be loud but that night wasn't bad. The wait stuff was very friendly. The menu looked interesting.  I ordered the premium pork ramen (can't remember the exact name)  with a combo with salad and 4 pieces of gyoza. The salad was good and simple. The gyozas were tasty. The ramen looked good and tasty. I did enjoyed my meal. However the portion is not big and the price is about 20% more than other ramen places in town (just for ramen,  it ranges from $12 to 15. Most places are around $10 to 12) The taste of the ramen was good but I would need to get more to have a full meal. The pork buns look interesting. I will probably try it next time when I am there."}
{"text":"our first time here...i had read about them on fb newsfeeds..great reviews n pics of food also looked great so wanted to try their ramen..tho it was a full house we got there at a good time becuz aftr we got seated..only waited about 10 min..there was a line of people waiting..we sat at the bar..we didnt mind becuz we didnt want to wait any longer for a table..we ordered several apps..brussels sprouts tempura which was crispy n seasoned right..delicious..the spicy creamy shrimp tempura was also delicious and takoyaki was excellent too! my friend ordered the veggie soup ramen..has veggie broth, mushrooms, baby leaf spinach, asparagus, broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage, blk pepper and served with thin noodles..he liked his ramen..i got the jinya chicken ramen..it has chicken broth, chicken chashu, green onion, spinach, fried onion served with thin noodles and i added on cheese n tomatoes n a onsen tamago..i loooved mine!  i ate everything n the broth! great food n service i will be back!"}
{"text":"Great service, always welcomed with smiles. Love the fresh garlics they offer for your ramen and love the option of refilling your ramen! My wife is a vegan and they have a creamy vegan ramen option and that's a huge plus for us--- we've been to a few ramen joints and a vegan option is almost non existent."}
{"text":"I am not sure that I like this place. they have a community seating in the middle of the room, a small bar area, booths and a dining table in the back. So lots going on here. I've been here twice now. The first time was just okay but the second time was awful. I tried to get something similar as when I go to my favorite ramen bar and it was just disgusting. I didn't even finish it. The noodles were like spaghetti noodles and the broth was awful. They were kind enough to take it off of our bill, which I appreciate, but overall, I do not like their food at all."}
{"text":"I got the black tonkatsu ramen, medium spicy and added corn.  I don't know the meaning of portion control and I am always hungry, so usually i don't get full off of just a bowl of ramen, but this filled me up!  The noodles are a little thinner than I'm used to but I didn't mind as they were flavorful and taste fresh.  Broth was good, just a little kick.  Toppings are generous - usually they give you half an egg, you get a whole egg which was still a little runny in the middle just how I like it.  The pork was cooked perfectly, buttery and soft!  I would totally come back next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"For some reason, this place just gives off that Japanese nightlife feel to it. And hey, it sold me pretty well! You're surrounded by fun knowing that although it's a spacious place to dine in, you get to vibe to the variety of entertainment they serve. For example, the music. They offer a diverse selection, it can be jazz, house, pop or even rap! The service is great! Though there is a line, they try cater to you as soon as they can. They give out smiles, warm welcoming, recommendations etc! A solid team for sure.   And hey, with great customer service comes fantastic food! I think that answers the question why there's always a line here, its good stuff!   I would definitely recommend this place to people who just wanna have fun while enjoying a fresh hot bowl of ramen! By the way, their menu is crafted to cater any of your cravings! From chicken wings to salads to rice and hey, even alcohol!   I've been here more than I even bothered checking in yelp, and it's always an awesome experience. With a place that opens till late? What more to ask? Till the next one!  -Arashai?!"}
{"text":"Love this spot staff is so attentive and friendly, I have been eating and showing this ramen bar off for close to two years and they never let me down . Flavors and portion-size are stellar not to mention a fair price to boot tell your friends tell your family let's make this place vegas strong and grow"}
{"text":"Cold, breezy nights led us to JINYA on the other side of town to get dinner with our lovely family. Although we got there around 7:30pm, there was about a 20 minute wait and quite a few people who came in before, during and after us.   The inside is cute-sy with the big family style table in the middle, with booths bordering the building. JINYA has a drive-thru although probably not usable.   I liked the idea of being able to order Chicken Karaage in varying amounts without seeming like we were ordering 83294023809438 orders. :)  The ramen was flavorful - I got the spicy tonkotsu (pork and chicken broth) with extra corn and a flavored egg. Customer service was top notch! We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I'm a fan. One of the best Ramen places in town. A trendy-chique restaurant right on flamingo and decatur. Right away, if you come in during peak hours, you will see a line outside the door, this usually means that this place is really good--and you're right. Right when i walked in, i noticed the big round wooden picnic table that seats probably 10-15 people. They also have a bar and booth seating.  I had a the spicy tonkotsu ramen with cilantro and the seasoned egg, it did not disappoint. The broth is full of flavor and it's what keeps me coming back. You can make every meal into a combo which gives you the option of a salad + gyoza/chicken/etc. The only reason I'm giving this place a 4 star instead of a 5 is due to the inconsistency of the service. I've been here multiple times where the server was talkative, observant, and helpful. Other times, our server was so high off her mind that she forgot everything. We were eating without spoons for almost the entire dinner after asking for them multiple times.  Overall, a good experience. More pros than cons. Will be back."}
{"text":"I've been there for many times. The greatest sever Hitoshi is the one always with a nice smile and provide fabulous services to every single one there!!!"}
{"text":"PBefore I came into this restaurant I was freezing cold wearing a sweater and sweat pants. After eating the spice chicken ramen in Hot mode my bod is warm and toasty. My frozen face was thawed out by these delicious bowl of soup. I feel great. My only complaint is I wish I brought bigger sweat pants.lol"}
{"text":"For all vegetarians and vegans in Vegas, this is your one way stop to pleasure town: aka the spicy vegan ramen. I literally crave this soup as it has many complex and delicious flavors. I also believe Jinya has the best egg to add into their ramen.  Sometimes it's incredibly busy with waits up to 45+ minutes-other times you sit down right away. It really just depends. I would definitely classify this as my #1 ramen place in town."}
{"text":"While the service at JINYA's is friendly, it's not enough to redeem itself from its subpar food, prices, and speed.  The turnaround time here was very, very slow. We came during a rush, so it was kind of expected, but it took us quite awhile to be seated despite multiple tables being open. And getting our food was painstakingly slow. We were here for an hour and a half, and that was only because we spent an hour waiting around.  The service was very friendly and apologetic, however. And while I appreciate the good customer service, I don't think it's enough to redeem the food or the prices.  I got the creamy vegan ramen. The highlight were the thick noodles, which I loved. Everything else was mediocre (the toppings) or subpar (the broth was ridiculously salty).  Three bowls of ramen and two additional toppings came to $42. Having been here a few times and considering the competition nearby, I don't think I'll be back. It just wasn't worth it, and I couldn't help but leave wholly unsatisfied and disappointed."}
{"text":"Yummy yummy food! Glad they had two vegan options to choose from. Broth was a little salty for my liking."}
{"text":"As a new vegan who struggles daily to find food that is both plant-based and actually yummy.. (I am also plagued as a foodie, which makes my new journey super difficult.. needless to say..)  Jinya restores my faith in humanity and keeps me reassured that you can cut out animal products and still have an amazing meal. Not to mention, the price is excellent and very affordable."}
{"text":"If I were stranded on a deserted island and could only eat one type of food for the rest of my life, I think I'd happily eat ramen til I die....  My favorite ramen in town is still Monta Ramen, but if you want variety, JINYA is the place to be! They have a great spicy chicken ramen for those of you who don't eat pork :).  Overall, the broth is very good (personally I prefer the tonkatsu broth at monta, bc it has more flavor), and they have a larger selection of toppings and add-ons. I love the fried garlic :P  They also have a choice between thick and thin noodles (thick is definitely the way to go....)  The decor here is modern and hip. Service is great and there is a nice big communal table in the center of the restaurant that's nice for a larger party.  Overall, I would definitely come back for more ramen.....esp if I'm looking for something not pork based."}
{"text":"First impression is the most important, greetings should be given to customers when they walk in through the door, indicating that they notice us but no acknowledgement was made. The host was caught talking to an employee, completely ignoring us. We caught them on a slow night so I didn't understand why it took so long to be seated.  The food on the other hand made up for how hangry I was. The salmon tacos are currently my favorite, add a hint of lemon and ugh, those are to die for. I got the JINYA chicken ramen and that's pretty good too, their broth is very flavorful and there's a lot you can choose from.  The waiter barely checked up on our table and we always constantly had to grab their attention. I hope they really pick up their customer service."}
{"text":"Now, there are only a few late night eateries I can go to. AYCE sushi, Roberto's, and of course bars. But when I stumbled upon this gem. Who doesn't want ramen at 2am? This place is great! First off, I adore the atmosphere. It's very mellow and dark (as a ramen bar should.)       I've had my server Alex, 3 times and each time she was remarkably nice and very attentive. From what I can tell, so is the rest of the staff.      As for the food, in my opinion, Jinya does ramen right. The pork broth I had was flavorful and slightly thick. Noodles were on point. The Cha Sui pork slices melted in mouth and nothing is better than their seasoned egg. The appetizers we ordered, which consisted of Spicy tuna of crispy rice, crispy chicken, and pork Gyoza, were also all delicious!        If you're looking for genuine ramen, even if it's late night. Then Jinya is the place you need to go."}
{"text":"We went to celebrate a family birthday with our 7 immediate family members, two parents and 5 kids.  It was okay service, loud and noisy with the owner/manager screaming something like a cheer every 15 minutes.  Very off-putting.  Worse was when we got the bill.  We were slapped with a mandatory 18% gratuity for having 6 people in the party.  Didn't matter we were in one family.  Our server could have told us before we ordered, but waited to tell us when the check came.  So not acceptable."}
{"text":"I'm. Surprised.  Never thought I would see a ramen place excel higher than monta. Well, this place is pretty damn close. Keep it up and I would say they finally raised the bar for ramen in this town! Their broth (tonkatsu premium white) is less salty, thick and creamy. It sits well in your stomach. It doesn't feel fattening, and is really light. When you eat it, it goes down so smooth and you don't feel humongous after you eat a bowl. You simply feel satisfied.  Get the combos for more for your buck! Awesome prices. Chasu bowls are really good. The Jinya bun is suuuuper yummy I could eat those all day.  The atmosphere is awesome. Nice setting. Loud music. When you walk in they immediately greet you hello. When you walk out they immediately greet you goodbye. You feel like you're a famous someone, and that's an awesome feeling! The waitresses are super sweet! She even remembered me after just two visits. This place is definitely a hot spot.   Their girls bathroom is also pretty awesome. And I love the fact that they're open late til 3am. Finally don't have to rush for ramen because most of them close at 11am.  Kudos to you, Jinya."}
{"text":"I honestly love coming here at night for dinner or lunch. The ramen is one of the best here in Vegas. I personally like the spicy chicken ramen with a side of seaweed salad. Lines get pretty crazy during nights as it can go outside. There customer service is also top notch. Our server Bon made us feel overly welcome. I hope to see him there next time I dine in!"}
{"text":"For a small Ramen joint, 3+ servers and 4+ cooks is plenty enough to provide good service.  Our server may have been high I'm assuming because she greeted us with \"Wassssuuuup\" and spoke very slowly.  But anyways food came out slow and out of order,  Ramen before appetizers, side order curry rice halfway into meal (isn't the curry already made?) and we weren't even done with our food and instead of refilling our empty glasses she asks if we wanted more water.  Hello, we ordered spicy ramen!  The problem was not only they knew their service was slow (they apologized for each dish they brought out slowly), but they continued to be slow.  We waited 25 minutes to get our check.  And the girl at the front of house who's also the cashier didn't know which table to bring my change to.  She can't even do her job right.  I feel bad for whoevers waiting to be seated because the wait wouldn't be that long if they had their ish together. They get 2 stars because the ramen tastes good but there are many in the area with much better service."}
{"text":"Good price, but quite salty food. Very nice employees with excellent service. Pretty busy for lunch. Reasonable prices!"}
{"text":"With the loss of Hapa, I was afraid that convenient Ramen was now gone. Then I discovered Jinya.....So glad I did. The ramen was excellent. Absolutely fantastic. I had the spicy some thing something ramen and it was all out glory.  The addition of outstanding sides was also a huge plus.  Poke salmon tacos??? Frickn delish!  And deserts they have yummy dessert as well.    While I did not have them the table next to us did the children's plates look on point, with fabulous presentation. Seemed like a fantastic way to introduce any one to this establishment's fantastic cuisine."}
{"text":"Amen for Ramen!!! Jinya has been a solid staple in my Las Vegas ramen eating career. They are in a good location and away from the strip and easily accessible. They are also open late until 3am which is also super clutch.  The food here is also super bomb! My personal favorite is the Tonkatsu white or the spicy. The broth is super well spiced and incredibly filling. They also have a pretty good happy hour and appetizers. Cheap bear and squid balls for the win! They also have a vegan ramen that I have never tried but all my vegan friends sing its praises.  The fact that they have a Vegan option is a good sign In my books since I have quite a good amount of Vegan friends. They also have a drive thru that I've never used because I'm not a fan of on the go ramen.   The only downside is that this place is a little small and depending on when you go the lines can get crazy long. Also the women's bathroom is super awesomely decorated, but as of my last visit the men's was just a normal one.    Overall, you definitely should come here if you're needing ramen in vegas"}
{"text":"Awesome! Ramen and Tapas are amazing. Have a good happy hour from 3-5pm/10pm-12am. Try the Jinya Bun its on the tapas list. As far as ramen try the Cha-Cha-Cha."}
{"text":"If visiting Vegas, the short cab ride to this place that's a little ways from the strip is more than worth it. Their ramen is amazing, their staff is super friendly and they are quick to serve you. I was here during the lunch rush and my food was out in less than 10 minutes. I had dumplings, ramen and sake, all three were exceptional. I will be back for sure for some of the best ramen around. Who doesn't like being offered more noodles for their ramen when they have left over broth? Love this place!"}
{"text":"I visited this place along with my job training class on October 31st. None of us decided on where to go for lunch, so we all settled on Jinya, which was conveniently located next door (not even a 5 minute walk.) We all walk in and the place is extremely lively. Delicious aromas all around and s someone who worked in the food service nearly her entire life, I usually look for flaws in eating establishments. Couldn't find one. We all sit down and only one orders an appetizer, which was Edamame. Now I'm a cultured little lady, so I usually don't branch out from my comfort zone, but since it was offered to the rest of us to share, I decided to try one.  It was pretty good. Interesting at most.  I soon found myself unconsciously nibbling at them one by one until our food came out. I had the basic chicken ramen with nothing special added. The only other time I EVER has ramen (that wasn't in cup form) was in LA at a place called Mr. Ramen. Jinya FAR surpassed that of MR. The broth has a good, heavy feel to it and not much of a watery, soupy context. It was so delicious that I was the first one to finish eating and ended up becoming actually upset that I didn't have enough money to order another bowl. This place really ended up etching a place on my heart, so the next day, I ended up eating from there again.  The next time, I had their Tokyo Rice Curry and if you like to eat like me, their lunch size, I promise is MORE than enough. I expected one tiny little bowl for $7, but you get that and SO MUCH MORE. It was delicious like nobody's business. Needless to say, I ended up taking home leftovers.  Overall, if you're a pasta lover like me and also happen to like the Japanese cuisine, Jinya is the place to go. It's not the biggest restaurant, but for its size, it was cozy, warm and their waitstaff was very friendly. Extra points for the Pokemon Go discount, where if you \"caught\" a pokemon in the restaurant, they put you in a drawing to win a free bowl. I will DEFINITELY be back soon!"}
{"text":"As per previous review, their service has not improved, but again knowing how they act amongst all guests so I'm prepared, just wanted to go in for a good bowl of ramen and nothing else.  This time, not only their service level plummeted, the quality of food also declined.  I've ordered my bowl of Spicy Chicken Ramen (their signature dish), but waited 40mins until I got my bowl.  And when I took my first bite, the broth was COLD.  How could you serve a cold bowl of ramen?  This has been by far the most disappointing visit ever.  From their first opening in Las Vegas I have paid many visits, sometimes twice a day because of their good food.  Have visited their Vancouver, BC location as well.  Now, not only their service level sucked, their food now also sucked.  I can say I will not be returning to this restaurant again.  Truly sad to see a great business got ruined by bad employees."}
{"text":"What a yummy lunch just off the strip. But if you aren't very hungry you must stop in to the ladies restroom just for the luxury of it."}
{"text":"I had the creamy vegan ramen that is basically one of the best things I've ever tasted! It's even better than the chicken one that I ordered last time. I'm located way in the other side of town but I'll make the trip just for this... Amazing - must try!  Oh I forgot to mention every time I've been here the service is just as amazing as the food. Great job Jinya your wait staff is great :)."}
{"text":"Our favorite ramen spot to go to. Only down side is the wait, usually around 30-45 minutes!!  The ramen is delicious with tons of flavor. The rice bowls are also really good. We get the fried chicken for our son and it's perfectly cooked. Nice and crispy."}
{"text":"I'm not a huge ramen person...instant and otherwise. Even when I was a broke-a$$ college student I never resorted to noodles as a life saver but jinga has definitely converted me!   We tried Tokyo ramen and tonkotso black and the latter is way much better with more flavor profile. I'm a firm believer that in a ramen the broth should take centerstage and this particular one definitely delivered."}
{"text":"This is my wife and mine favorite Ramen Bar to dine at whenever we are in Vegas. Delicious Ramen, attentive service along with a fun atmosphere."}
{"text":"Extra star for the male server taking our order.  He was super nice, alert n quick. The ramen good, but still don't beat my fav in south San Jose or the ones I like in LA.  Still a good bowl of ramen in the desert. Takoyaki good, salad OK.  Overall a good meal."}
{"text":"Ok, so the food was great. Actually, it was more than great. If I could review strictly on food I would give Jinya on Flamingo 5-Stars. However, the service I received makes me want to rate this place -1 stars. My party and I were served by 2 servers on 1/29/18 by Alex, and a waitress with pink hair. Let me tell you that I have never received such horrible service anywhere. When Alex stopped by our table he just threw the drink menu at us, and didn't wait to take the drink order. He came by twenty minutes to take our food order, when he did, I handed him my menu and he didn't reach to grab it so it fell. I was going to grab it for him, but it was right at his feet and I couldn't reach. He acknowledged that I dropped the menu, but instead of grabbing it he left it there. That was the last time we saw him stop by the table, until later when we asked someone for his name. Our food was delivered by someone else, and then the pink-haired waitress came by to try and give us our check. One person in our party was not done eating, and we wanted to order dessert. So she loudly crumpled the check and took the order. The dessert didn't come, and the pink-haired waitress came by with the check again. When I told her the dessert was not there she said \"oh, no one brought it to you?\", she did not care to apologize. It was at that moment that my party and i decided to ask for the waiter's name that initially served us.   Basically, we never got refills, no one ever stopped by our table, they were trying to rush us out of the restaurant the entire time. The atmosphere of this place is 'get out, we need you to leave'. No one is attentive, and the place lacks organization. The food is great, but the service is enough to never go to this restaurant again.   The seating host was kind, however. That's a plus for the service team."}
{"text":"Yaassssss! I finally found another decent ramen place to add to my list in Vegas. Thanks to my friend's recommendation, I was able to finally check out JINYA.   This place was ridiculously delicious, but a little pricey for Vegas prices. For a party of two with one appetizer, we spent about $37 bucks with tip and tax. Who would have thought that sin city had some good ramen places, huh? JINYA would be in the top 3 ramen places in Vegas. The place was also well-decorated too and had a nice hipster vibe to mesh with the overall atmosphere.   JINYA was generous with portions and offered a huge variety of topping options. I ordered the JINYA Tonkotsu Black with thick noodles. I enjoyed the noodles as they were perfectly cooked and chewy. The broth was decent, but unfortunately, the flavor wasn't as delicious as Monta's Black Tonkotsu version. It wasn't bad, don't get me wrong. As far as flavoring and taste goes, it's a solid 3.5-4/5. The noodles, meat and seasoned egg were a solid 5/5.  We also ordered the fried Shrimp Balls, which I highly recommend! It had just the right amount of crunch, shrimp and cream cheese that made it beyond orgasmic.  Overall, this place is a solid choice to dine for a quick bite. We went on Monday around 5 and were seated quickly. If I had to wait in line for this place, I probably wouldn't wait more than 20 minutes. The service was attentive and friendly, especially when we told them it was our first time at the restaurant! Our waters were always constantly refilled and they routinely checked up on us to see how things were going."}
{"text":"I get a New York vibe in here, it's dark and mysterious, the set up is super cool. The food is on point, the soup is not too salty, this place would be great for dates. Imagine sucking noodles and rocking to good music. Hot like sauce. One of my favorite ramen places, would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Extraordinary ramen and excellent service. I know it shows I've checked in twice but I've been here before many times.  The reason behind it is because I'm way too excited and happy to even look at my phone... I can't think straight,  my taste buds are about to be taken to ramen heaven! How can I even think of anything else?! You can't go wrong with the black tonkatsu,  or the JINYA no 1. The seasoned egg is an absolute must! Order an extra one, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"This is a welcome addition to the corner of Flamingo and Decatur.   The restaurant is cute and modern. They recently started serving lunch during the weekend, so my fella and I decided to stop by.   We shared a crispy rice with tuna as an appetizer and I opted for the spicy tonkotsu and my fella ordered the spicy chicken ramen.  I wouldn't recommend the crispy rice appetizer. The texture and taste were completely off. The ramen was tasty. Not the best I've ever had, but decent. The spice levels were good and not overly salty like others I've had.   The noise level was a little high in the restaurant. I like having music accompanying my meals, but it was overwhelming and hard to hear.  Service was very friendly and efficient. I wouldn't mind coming back to check out their happy hour."}
{"text":"The soup is extremely good but they're very stingy when it comes to sides like when I added an additional boy choy to my ramen for $1.50, I only got two scrawny leaves of bok choy. If you're running short on time, I wouldn't recommend this place because chances of them making a mistake in your order is 99%. I have visited this establishment several times, all ending with some kind of mistake in my order. I honestly would not come here if it wasn't for my mother. This visit was much faster in receiving the order but in many of my other visits it took over an hour or more just to order and get the food delivered to the table. On the bright side, they have a variety of different toppings compared to other ramen restaurants. On the down side, the toppings are $1 to $2 or more just for two pieces. Making your noodles spicy even costs $1 which is a bit ridiculous to just add a dab of sriracha. If you don't like smiling and angry looking waiters this is the place for you!"}
{"text":"The best ramen you'll ever have in your entire life, especially the Spicy Vegan Ramen. Everything on the menu is phenomenal.  Seating is limited and at peak times, the wait can be up to an hour.  The service is super good and everyone is friendly. I'm here at least 3 times a week, I love this place!!!"}
{"text":"Seriously so good! Really awesome vibes and you can smell how good it is from outside. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"I've only been to a few ramen houses so far in Vegas but Jinya seems to be my favorite. Cool atmosphere, lots of seating, and tasty ramen. I love the option they give you for the level of how hot you want it, being that I like my food on the spicier side. My go to is the Tonkatsu Spicy Ramen with the fat noodles and an egg, but adding the gyoza makes it even better. I definitely love the fact that I never have to wait to be seated. I don't know if I just showed up at the perfect time or they're just amazing!!"}
{"text":"Is my son's favorite place, the food is good the service is good.  But that place is so small that is a ridiculous wait time! If you have a party of 8, more than an hour wait last nigth. And the manager is not very effective in doing her job. Turn down"}
{"text":"BEST RAMEN IN VEGAS. I love their ramen so much, I crave this place all the time. The restaurant itself is a little small but they are so kind and the food is so good that it makes up for it. 12/10 would recommend!"}
{"text":"The food was great the SERVICE was HORRIBLE... when I say horrible I mean our server didn't bother to asked if we need anything else, if we want refill on our drinks, Instead he asked if we are done like wow.    So we waited until our server realize we need more drinks, but nope he was behind the black curtain talking and eating with his coworkers like hello we're still here.    We always come here and we never had a bad service till today.   So whoever is server 1 on 6/20/2018 at 1:20am he need more training.   People who come to your restaurant are paying customer!!!!!! we're not eating free food."}
{"text":"Jinya is a yummy ramen shop. It's not a large establishment so definitely expect a wait. The staff here are really friendly, both about the wait and during dinner service. Though our waiter/waitress wasn't consistently one person, they were all great.  The menu has various ramen options that are separated by tonkotsu, chicken, and vegetable. Apparently their JINYA bun is popular, but we just were too full. They also have some interesting items such as mini tacos and BlockPops.  +SPROUTING UP RAMEN: This may not be the most traditional ramen, but I absolutely loved the brussel sprouts in here; they added some crunch. The broth is also rich and creamy and overall a wholesome ramen bowl.  All in all, the ramen shop offers some delicious albeit possibly non-traditional ramen. I would love to return to try some of their other non-ramen offerings because they also sound tasty."}
{"text":"After a dozen plus check-ins, I'd say it's time to leave a review. That being said, a year ago Jinya was my go to spot for ramen, but the quality of food seemed to decline as the months went on. It's either that or maybe things just weren't consistent, which is a no go for me. So, I started to go elsewhere. Fast forward to last week in which an impromptu lunch date landed me here, and let's just say everything is back to being perfect!!   The noodles in my spicy chicken ramen were cooked perfectly, not too overdone that is (I can't stand soggy noodles); the shrimp balls were golden & crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside; and although they were out of jinya buns, the karaage chicken being fried to perfection definitely made up for it. Customer service had also improved and everything came quickly and correctly.   It's safe to say Jinya is back to being my favorite!! Although I wish they'd  bring back the tofu dessert, it's definitely not a deal breaker."}
{"text":"June 24, 2016 - the day I fell in love with this ramen bar.  We have visitors from NC and they were craving ramen after watching Mariah at Ceasar's... but wait... it's past 12 am!!! No problem! This place takes order until 2:45AM!   Appetizers: Jinya Bun, Gyoza, Takoyaki, and Crispy Shrimp Ball Ramen: Jinya Tonkotsu Black; Cha Cha Cha; and Tonkotsu Assari  Loved the Tonkotsu Black ramen! Order this if you're a fan of thin noodles! Broth is soooo good!   Jinya Bun - so flavorful! get it!  I highly recommend this place for ramen lovers!"}
{"text":"This place was not what I expected. The ambience was as quaint. I felt like I was in China town with all of the art and how the place was set up. The service was awesome and our waitress was very attentive. The food was great. We have to try happy hour one day, but the ramen selection didn't overwhelm me and pictures helped me to choose what I wanted. Overall the experience was great and food was really good."}
{"text":"My favorite Ramen place hands down... And I've been to some awesome Ramen houses in California"}
