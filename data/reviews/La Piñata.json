{"text":"While the neighborhood has changed significantly over the last thirty years, (not for the better)  La Pinata hasn't changed a bit. The food is still wonderful and the margaritas are too. Their salsa is my favorite in the Valley though I like Carlo's O'Brien's chips better. I don't care how authentic Mexican food is, I want the food of my childhood when I return to Phoenix and La Pinata is it. The spinach queso dip is really good and I always get a machaca chimichanga because theirs are outstanding. Wish I got to Phoenix more often...."}
{"text":"Love the new location.  Has a modern hip vibe, but yet still retained their authentic Mexican food.  Great combination!"}
{"text":"This place is the only place for Mexican food within 2432 miles. Tamales, red chili and the Margs are the best."}
{"text":"Love this place! Everything I've had has been great. Their Mexican pizza w machaca beef is my favorite thing on whole menu! Great food, service, and prices. This place has a vintage phoenix Mexican restaurant vibe....very chill and inviting. Been going there since I was little and La Pinata will always be my go-to for easy, straight forward, sonoran Mexican food."}
{"text":"The food we ordered was really good. It's not super authentic or anything but definitely a lot better than other Mexican-American places in Phoenix. Our server, Matt, was super polite and attentive. 

Side note: Our early dinner entertainment was provided by the table behind us. The woman was explaining, (practically yelling) to the man that she was with, that she steals from the adult bookstore that she works for (and that they should expect her to) because she isn't paid well enough. Oh, okay. Then she offered to steal some porn for him and asked his preference. After first choosing heavier white ladies, he changed his mind to \"blue, green, whatever...\" After they left, people on the other side of us started talking about cysts and boils! Then someone did the whole horn nose blow routine. It blows my mind that people still (in 2013!) don't realize that nose-blowing is meant for the restroom while in a restaurant. How many comedians have to talk about it publicly before it reaches everyone? Anyhow, I'm not holding any of this stuff against the restaurant, I just felt compelled to share."}
{"text":"Dropped by for Lunch today at 2:15 pm.  Place was largely empty with  plenty of staff around. It took 20 mins  for my food and  later nearly 20 mins to receive check after my meal!. I asked to see dessert  menu,which was ignored twice by server.So no flan today !  Bottom line:Food was marginally OK ,Service was bad and this surprisingly  from an iconic  restaurant with 45 years in this  business . Emphasis evidently  is on bar offerings \"Casa Margarita'  they call it.Try El Bravo  or Las Glorias or Los Compadres if you are after good Mexican fare in  North Central Phoenix.   FYI :I've lived in this neighborhood for 46 years so I believe  i know  my Mexican food.  I voiced my dissatisfaction to the Manager.No plans to return."}
{"text":"Nice chill spot , customer service is good, looks nice in there, has a modern Mexican twist with a lil razzle dazzle the food was OKAY could be better , the area is nice , the location is perfect  good parking"}
{"text":"I am a long time, faithful friend of La Pinatas.  La Pinata has been a source of comfort through the good times and bad times in my life.  I have rabidly encourage friend and foe alike to make the venture to the dump that is 19th Avenue and Osborn and brave the wild flora and fauna that is the neighborhood to get the La Pinata.  Why?  The food is the BEST!  

I have never received bad service.  I have been eating here for 14 years (Holy cow! I can't believe it's been THAT long!) now and I have never eaten a bad meal here.  My old standby:  Chicken Yucatan with Jalapeno cream cheese.  The yucatan is basically a chimichanga, smothered with ranchero sauce and queso con espinaca.  De-freaking-licious.  Served with beans and rice.  Your choice of sour cream or jalapeno cream cheese.  Get the cream cheese.  You will never regret it.  I have never been a fan of their chips and salsa but frankly, I am there for the plate of gluttony!"}
{"text":"Outstanding food!  I had what equated to the sampler of everything when I was there.  Since I live in Ohio, it may be a few months before I fly out again to see family.  I will be sure to stop in when I arrive again.  I've been talking about my experience in Phoenix and this restaurant ever since I returned home."}
{"text":"I love this place. I have the chicken tacos, chicken taco salad and the machaca beef taco salad. All very good. Love the chips and salsa. Love the service. Went there the other nite told our waiter that the last time we came my son ordered the Carne Asada Burro dinner did not get beans and rice but got charged for it. My son ordered it that nite again and the waiter only charged us for the burro to make up for it. Really cool. My other son really likes the Chimi. My boyfriend loves the cheeseburger not a great Mexican fan is he but he goes with us for the burger. I will continue to go here."}
{"text":"Yum. Try the steak fajitas. 
They charge for any extras. Our fajitas came out with hardly any peppers and onions at all. I asked if we could have some more, and when the check came I was charged $4 for a side of grilled onions (didn't even have any peppers) So I felt a little ripped off, but I still love the steak fajitas and I also love the rice and beans. I will be back and nextime not order any extras to be safe."}
{"text":"Food is ok...however the well margarita is 6.25 which will cost more if you ask for it frozen.....BTW it's premixed so dont bother.   tried to voice my concern to owner who didnt care or wish to listen."}
{"text":"Love the new location even though I am nostalgic for the old.  Same great food they have had since the 70's(the best green corn tamales I've ever found in a restaurant.)  Cheese crisps are actually crisp!!!  

Love that the new location has outdoor seating which the old one lacked.  The restrooms are a great improvement too.  

Their enchilada and sauce is closer to the great stuff we got back in the 60's and 70's than on most cheese enchiladas in restaurants in recent decades (deep red/rust sauce, tasty cheese with tiny chopped onion, wrapped in good corn tortillas, topped with chopped black olives and white crumbled cheese)....not the same, but closer than most restaurants.  Shredded beef tacos are always good.  Salsa is good and they can bring algo mas picante.  My husband likes their machaca dinner and rarely strays from it.


We will be able to go more often now that they are way closer to our home."}
{"text":"My favorite chimichanga at a sit-down restaurant.

Many years ago I used to hit up La Pinata about once a week in its old location. It's one of the best casual Mexican restaurants I've ever been to. I recently got to sneak in before the lunch rush at their new location. It used to be Mary Coyle ice cream *sad face*.

The chimichanga is big. It's lightly crisped all around in deep fried goodness. The beef has an option of either machaca (really just shredded beef, no eggs in it) or ground beef. I prefer the machaca - tons of seasoned shredded meat that has never been dry or burned. Lots of red sauce but not quite drowned in it and a bit of cheese, lettuce, chopped tomato. The lunch special I had comes with rice, which was fluffy and good, and beans, which were very creamy topped with a bit of 2 different cheeses.

I've tried their tacos (good), tamales (average), enchiladas (good), \"There's a taco in my burro!\" burro (interesting but okay), albondigas soup (very good), chicken tortilla soup (okay, was always salty), Pinata Chimi (very good), machadilla (great), fajitas (average)...almost half their menu but at their old location. I'll have to come back with an update and try some of these again.

Their complementary chips are above average. The salsa is very chunky and tasty. The hot sauce is really good - hot in heat and lots of chili flavor.

The new interior is all windows towards the street with a front patio that can seat quite a few. Plenty of space between tables and booths. The bar is off to the side with about a dozen seats. They still have a couple of pinatas a the entrance but not nearly as many as before. It's nice. Parking could be an issue - they have about 20 spaces and when I left around noon, not a single spot was open."}
{"text":"Some things don't need to change and La Pinata is one of them. So happy the food is the same after all these years.  Great flavors- starting with the salsa (both the chunky served with the chips and the special \"red sauce\" from the back) and chips to the iced tea- strong real brewed flavor. Couldn't decide what to order so I got the green corn tamale with green sauce and the shredded beef n bean tostada with guacamole.  The tamale was flavorful and sweet- it went well with the green sauce. The sauce was nicely rich which chunks of onions and green chile- enough substance to eat alone with the melted cheese on top. The shredded beef of the tostada was very flavorful, the guacamole had the right balance of avocado and garlic. Was very ful. My lunch date ordered the Taco in my Burrito, deep fried. He was pleased as well. The food at La Pinata is loaded with flavor, but not overpowered by spicey heat. If you like your Mexican Food really spicey, you'll have to ask for it here. What you'll find here is quality ingredients cooked with old family recipes that haven't changed much over the 30 years its been here. Definitely worth the trip!"}
{"text":"My family has been eating here for 30 years however since they moved to their new smaller location the service has been terrible. Their attitude seems like they don't need your business and they sincerely act like it. I thought their move would hurt Sylvia's Mexican food which is directly across the street however with there don't care attitude Sylvia's is busier than ever.
Sorry to lose one of my favorite eating places but I won't spend my hard earned money for owners that take it for granted"}
{"text":"I have been going to La Pianta for the last couple of years for lunch. I recently stopped by for dinner and it was awesome. You are always seated quickly with servers bringing chips/salsa and taking your drink order. The margaritas are great and the serving size of the steak fajitas was overstuffing me, lol.."}
{"text":"This is the kind of Mexican food that I grew up eating at Karichimaka in Tucson. Delicious! My usual order is the red chile chimichanga, which is perfectly done. We also like the crispy cheese crisp with green chiles, and the free chips and salsa are great. 

I have to say that I've eaten at a lot of Mexican restaurants, and La Piñata and Karichimaka are the only ones that do justice to the red chile. Oregon, California, Colorado - all of these places seem to only offer New Mexican fare, which is fine but not truly authentic (to me). 

Their new location will be opening in the next month or so - they don't have an exact date. Come by and write a thank you note on the wall before they close the old location."}
{"text":"Good family friendly restaurant in central phoenix. This new location is very clean and feels somehow modern. The food is mostly good but Americanized a little. Tacos and burritos with lots of cheese (maybe too much) and the spicy level is quite low so the chips and salsas are kind of weak. Overall a good choice for Mexican food."}
{"text":"The rice was good , other than that the food was just average. Most notably the tortillas seem packaged. Overall disappointed"}
{"text":"How can a place that's been around Phoenix for over 40 years be anything but Great!!  La Pinata's new location serves the best Mexican food anywhere in the valley.  Chips and salsa are made fresh daily, sometime more often.  The place is spotlessly clean, the service is top notch and the food is the best!  The chef, Peter, is usually wandering around kibitzing with the new patrons as well as his regulars.  He's a hoot!  Eat on the patio if the weather permits.  It's beautiful with a large fireplace and flickering lights all over.  The food portions are more than generous and you can tell the ingredients are top quality.  If you have room, try the \"baked ice cream\" or the sopapias with honey or chocolate.  Go to this place once and you can be sure it will become one of your regulars."}
{"text":"Went on a Friday. It was very crowded during happy hour. We were not offered a happy hour menu and had to wait 10 minutes before our server came by to offer drinks. We were just there for drinks and appetizers. The taquitos did not have much beef and the beef was extremely dry and not flavorful. I am not sure if the hype is because this is a new restaurant but I do not know how it stays so crowded."}
{"text":"Great local mexican restaurant that I always want to find when on business travel.  Not fancy, familyish feel to service, refried and rice style mexican place.   

Chips and flavorful/spicy salsa
I rate all mexican places on rellanos and carnitas.  Here the rellanos were the fluffy style and good.  It came with rice and beans which were very good.   Also ordered a la carte carnitas enchilada & it was great .  Also had their special margarita which was good.  

The one down side was the tortillas - esp the flour that came with the rellanos.  Side of corn I ordered where better, but still not even average.

All in all, for this style of low key mexican place, it was a solid 4.

Adding the following to all of my reviews:  
Way too many undeserved 5 star ratings on yelp.  Ratings should be a bell curve, with at least 50-60% of your ratings a 3.  5 should be another world special, not everyday good.

{"text":"I've been go here before I could walk. Love the food,  best chips and salsa around not to mention the margaritas! The people are great and especially the memories throughout the years."}
{"text":"Food just OK. Four of us went all ordered different meals. All just OK. Looking for something crave-worthy. Beer was cold and served in frosty mug. Had to ask for chip refill. We liked the ambience and location is perfect."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood restaurant and bar! Has a loyal following in the area for it's great bar staff and good food. The best part of course is their margaritas- so potent and tasty."}
{"text":"I love this place it is down the street from where I live and it is definitely old school Mexican food. I like it, The place has not been around for 39 years for nothing. I love the green chimi. I have now been there 3 times in two weeks. I love family owned businesses and hate going to chains. So this fills the bill perfectly"}
{"text":"Not the best area of town, but you will be happy you made the trip.  We saw La Pinata advertised on the news and check them out Saturday.  We were greeted nicely at the door and taken to our table.  My server was phenomenal.  He was very high energy, SERVICE WITH SMILE, and attentive.  The food was AWESOME.  Our Pina Coladas were DELICIOUS. The chips and salsa was fresh.  The salsa was the best we ever had and the chips were served warm. We ordered two chicken tacos.  They were very flavorful and heaping full of meat.  We could not get over how everyone worked so nicely together.  Everyone appeared to be working very hard and everything was done with a smile."}
{"text":"My life long favorite restaurant. Though the meat varies, my usual is a burro (currently with machaca) enchilada style with a side of rice and I have not found another restaurant anywhere that makes this better. Also lots of love for the staff who have been like family."}
{"text":"I have been eating in this restaurant, since it opened. My grandmother, who is now 95, lives just up the street. Every time I'm in Phoenix, I eat at La Pinata. My husband always has a mixed bean and green chili burro enchilada style. I eat black beans, rice, guacamole, salsa, and fresh corn tortillas--they are wonderful at catering to my food allergies. Grandma eats spinach enchiladas. Mom is the only eclectic in the bunch and loves everything she tries. We love the extra spicy salsa, available upon request, as well as the house variety. The chips are the crispy extra thin variety that are sooo hard to resist. The service is impeccable and prices more than reasonable. The owners are friendly and of course recognize our family."}
{"text":"Really great food.  Went with the chimi - enchilada style.  Had to pass on the margaritas at lunch though, next time."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant and the new location! Everything from the decor to the food is fantastic. So happy that they have moved to a better location. I tried the soft tacos and guacamole. The chips and salsa are the best . I have also had the tamales which are delicious. Food is fresh and service is great. Will return soon. There is a great outdoor patio that I look forward to sitting at when the weather improves."}
{"text":"I has a bad experience here. I ordered a green tamale and a red tamale and beans and rice for take-out. When I arrived to pick up the order the bill was $19.70. The tamales were 4.95 each so that makes the beans and rice about 8+ dollars I guess.  After a frustrating conversation with the hostess about the price, I asked for the manager. Well it must have been his daughter because he was as dumb as she was. Out of frustration I paid that ridiculous price and left vowing never to return. I can see the order being written up incorrectly perhaps causing the bill to be high but that is why restaurant have managers, to fix problems and hopefully make sure others do not happen in the first place. Not at La Pinata!"}
{"text":"our family favorite!  love this place.   The food is fabulous! great staff, 
very clean"}
{"text":"Service wasn't bad at all, I actually like the decor and set up as well. The food just wasn't very good. I think eating authentic Mexican food in AZ may have spoiled my taste buds."}
{"text":"We've been here quite a few times because we live so close, but it wasn't until tonight that I finally got the order ready that really knocked my socks off.  

Beef machadilla and frozen blood orange margarita with salt.  Delish!!"}
{"text":"I've had bad and good service..I ordered chicken green enchiladas to go, got home and they were red.I was very clear on saying please make sure it was green I went back and advised them.... The manager Lenard was there and didn't even apologize . They brought me the right one but didn't offer me a discount.
The manager stated, \" oh sometimes the chef doesn't read if red or green.\" REALLY!!!  Customer satisfaction is not a priority for this restaurant"}
{"text":"I always get the same thing at Mexican restaurants, a green chili burro enchilada style - boring, I know but tonight it was different. The meat was tender and choice cuts, the sauce smooth and spiced exactly like I like it. Beans and rice on the plate were also excellent. I am always looking for the \"old school\" Mexican food that I knew as a kid. Well this is the place! 

Me dinner companion had fajitas, a combo of steak and chicken, which were the best that I had tried anywhere  in the Valley. I was surprised because the old style restaurants usually don't do fajitas well, because they are not traditional.

We both had margaritas, very good, and also traditional. Meal topped off with ice cream with cinnamon, pastry, whipped cream - what could be bad about that?

Our service was outstanding by all employees, fast water, chips and salsa, drinks, and dinner. Friendly, professional staff added to an experience that I hope to repeat again and again."}
{"text":"By far the BEST Mexican food I have had here in the valley! Always a wait but always worth it! The staff is amazing! Starting from the little cute host that greats you at the door to the amazing food they place on your table! I live this place! Everyone needs to give it a taste! The red enchiladas are the BOMB! I kinda wish the queso was hot (spicy)"}
{"text":"My sister wanted to meet for lunch one day last week, and told me to pick a place.  I was tired of all the usual spots, so after a quick search on Yelp, I came across La Pinata.

It is in an old strip mall on 19th Ave., but once you walk in, it is this funky, little retro Mexican restaurant with a cool vibe.  The menu is huge, with lots of the classic Sonoran style dishes us Arizonans love!

The chips and salsa were great; the chips were warm and the salsa was fresh and chunky with a touch of heat!  We tried the beans and they were really good, they didn't beat the beans at Los Compadres, but nonetheless, they were tasty.  We tried the cheese and the spinach enchiladas and both were really good, served piping hot!

We decided that we would definitely return to sample some more items on the vast menu!  They even had my all time favorite, the Mary Lou on the menu, and I just have to try that at some point!"}
{"text":"So I was coming from Portland on a weekend trip and wanted some good Mexican food. Not nouveau, authentic, fancy, Mexican. Just honest to goodness tasty Mexican food. And a margarita or three. I did a lot of research and talked to many friends and finally settled on this place. Mostly it was the pictures of the beans and rice. I like my beans pinto and mashed. And I like rice that is not in the shape of an overturned bowl, meant to look fancy.  

So we get there on a Friday night around 7 and I'm expecting a wait because the parking lot if filled. We enter through the back and immediately the fresh smell of peppers hits us and I know we've made the right choice. We were immediately seated at a nice table by the bar and it was our good fortune to have Gabby as our server. She was very sweet and had a can do attitude!  She recommended several dishes and we decided to start with the Mary Lou Christmas tree. It's basically a fat quesadilla served with beef and red sauce on one side and pork and green sauce on the other.  It was phenomenal and a ton of food!  Seriously we would have been full from that, but my wife and I love enchiladas so I ordered the red/cheese with beans and rice. She ordered the chicken ala carte.  Again, very, very good.  Great salsa and chips too.

We wound up taking at least half the food home and had for lunch the next day.  

The margaritas were just ok, not fantastic but the service was A plus!

If you're looking for good, down home, tasty Mexican with great and friendly service with huge portions at a very reasonable cost. this is the place.  There, aren't you glad I did your research for you?"}
{"text":"I have to say that this is my VERY favorite restaurant. We go there several times a week. We have been going there since the original La Piñata opened in 1970 and have never been disappointed. The food is wonderful ... service is attentive ... beautifully decorated. Take-out is now available and they are also doing Bar Specials, in addition to Happy Hour.  I love this place!!!!

PS  Try the frozen Blood Orange Margarita! My favorite!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, chips and salsa.  My favorite is the Carnitas Burro, best I have every had.  I would give them 5 Stars but they are not offering take out.  Hard to go out and eat with the little ones.  I have been going to this place for over 20 years, new location is very nice.  UPDATE, they have take-out now, all is complete, we order from here almost every week, excellent food!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  Their green corn tamale was delicious and I liked their chicken enchilada as well.  The decor is fun and the staff is super friendly.  Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"New place is a lot smaller, decorated upscale. So it would seem they would be more in that mode.  We would of liked if they put out small plates so you can put you salsa on the plate instead of all of us dipping from the same salsa bowl. They are tight on the chips, they come in a smaller bowl. When we asked for more chips the much older waitress seem annoyed. Also when you ask for an order to go why not put the container in a bag other restaurants do.  It was ok but I wouldn't drive out of my way to go back.Other Mexican restaurants are more customer friendly and food just as good or better."}
{"text":"Mexican cleansing, forget about fiber this place will clean your insides real good.  I didn't mind the over priced drinks or the low quality food but once I got the runs I knew I will never set foot on this place again."}
{"text":"I am very picky about my Mexican food. I grew up in a Spanish home and had the best cooking. This place is as close as it gets to home. Honestly you can not go wrong with anything you order from the fresh chips and salsa to the black bean burros.  My favorite the chili rellenos is great. If you want authentic food and really good service, this would be the place. The decor is a throw back to the 70's, but it is clean and comfortable. Staff is always friendly and welcoming. Their flan is delicious and two people can share one order of their fried ice cream."}
{"text":"The best machaca in town! We have tried several places in Phoenix and this one is a classic plus it offers great service and a relaxing atmosphere."}
{"text":"I never went to the old location but I am a fan of the new place!  I have been to dinner there twice now and have had good meals and service both times.  The blood orange margarita is delish!  Service is pretty quick and efficient and the wait time both times I went wasn't that long."}
{"text":"I cannot say enough kind words about the food at La Piñata. I share the same view as everyone else who has rang the praises about the amazing food. Now, I would like to take time to talk about the owners. I grew up at La Piñata in the 80's. I consider myself a close friend of the family. I remember Hope, the first lady aka founding mom of La Piñata. When I get to Heaven my hope is she will be willing to provide an endless supply of chips and salsa to me. I have known Roseanne, Romana and Peter since I was a little kid. I grew up with a kidney disease and eventually had a kidney transplant. I am an alumni in the Make A Wish Foundation in other words I was a Make A Wish kid. When Roseanne, Romana and Peter learned about Josh going on this Make A Wish trip to Canada they eventually threw a party closing down their restaurant to celebrate my life and raise money for Make A Wish. These people are some of the kindest people you will meet. I go there often and am always met with heart warming communication."}
{"text":"Who wants lunch? I came here with a coworker on a whim for lunch and wasn't disappointed. The tacos were nice for lunch. I didn't really like the selection, but it was pretty decent Mexican food. The service was good too. I recommend."}
{"text":"Still the best Mexican food in the State but parking, wait time & service is not what it used to be compared to the original location. Not to mention the lack of carryout now - I'm assuming due to the limited parking. If you're getting tired of waiting DON'T let them talk you into sitting at the community table! They say no reservations but apparently that doesn't apply to everyone. We saw a table for 5 + 2 high chairs in holding for over 30 min. When I asked about it they said that there was a party of 7 ahead of us but obviously they weren't there so clearly they do take reservations. Once we agreed to go to the community table then they divided the table up for two other parties of waiting customers . Go figure! I still won't eat Mexican food anywhere else but it's unfortunate that the customer service has declined so much."}
{"text":"The NEW La Piñata is a major disappointment !!

This is a great place if you like your food served tepid.

The WAS one of our favorite haunts ( 200+ visits over a number of years at the old location).

Since their move in October 2015, things have deteriorated.  The service is now mediocre and slow.  The noise level is profoundly louder.  The food is not served hot.  The lunch special menu variety is greatly reduced. 

Our LAST visit at the new location was today (our third attempt for a satisfactory experience at the new location):  We asked our waiter to make sure our order was served hot.  The food was barely warm.  We opted to take our food home to heat it.  When we asked for a container to take salsa home - the waiter informed us that the charge would be 75 cents.  We were insulted, especially since we had unsuccessfully asked our waiter three times for our first salsa refill.

In spite of all of this the restaurant seems busier - since the move. 

I am truly happy for the owners - but WE will not be returning.   Three strikes and you're out. 

There are too many better alternatives.  For example: Jordan's Mexican Food on 7th Street has vastly superior service, good food, and is pleasantly quiet.  It is only about 5 minutes away from the new (not improved) La Piñata."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good. I had chicken fajitas and I really enjoyed them although the chicken isn't sliced up, it's just a chicken breast. The portions are huge. Overall, I enjoyed my meal and the service was okay."}
{"text":"The staff is very friendly and the food was fantastic.  The shredded beef tacos, rice and beans were really good. I'll be back with the family for sure."}
{"text":"Been twice since they've opened and both times have liked the food. The staff has been great and attentive. No issues with owners/mgrs as stated in other reviews. Was disappointed when I read that take-out was not an option, so that' something to keep in mind. The food was very good and the prices are reasonable. Will return when looking to dine-in."}
{"text":"We went there on a Tuesday night for a family dinner. Granted we had 14 people, but the receptionist Was very rude. Don't think he wanted to be there that night. He told us it would be a very long wait. Yes they were busy but he was very rude and not helpful. We ended up leaving and went to Macayos. Got seated right away.  Had great service and the food was. Great. Unfortunately I missed out on la Pinatas great hot sauce."}
{"text":"Outdated decor and kind of musty smelling, but who cares.  I came for the food. Ordered the taco and enchilada lunch special. Surprisingly pricy for a basic lunch special. $9. 

The cheese enchilada was PERFECT! Gooey cheese and yummy sauce. However, the shredded beef taco was very disappointing. The meat itself was ok. A tad dry but I've had worse. The fried taco shell was extremely tough and chewy. Typically the shells are crispy. Not sure if I got one that was sitting for a while or perhaps they use extra thick corn tortillas? I only got halfway through the taco before I gave up. 

2 stars for the price and the taco. 5 stars for the enchilada. I wont be coming back."}
{"text":"We were a bit cranky and very hungry after our flight into Phoenix was delayed by more than 8 hours.  We needed a late supper en route to Sedona.  We didn't expect to find this gem - and are so glad we did!
Just a few minutes off of I-17, this is authentic family Mexican.  Great fresh salsa, just the right ratio of chunky to puréed tomatoes; outstanding Pork Carnitas which we split (with way too much left over).

Bring your appetite, and seek out La Piñata!"}
{"text":"Delicious authentic tacos and enchiladas. I really liked the rice, beans, salsa and guac too. I ate until I was sick and still had leftovers. this place is worth the trip."}
{"text":"Authentic delicious Mexican food with trendy, ketchy decor! And a great outdoor patio that is dog friendly and oh so nice now that the weather has gotten so nice.  We come here often and have never been disappointed in the quality of the food, generous portions, and friendly service of the staff.  100% of the time we take part of our meal home so the value equates closer to two meals for the price of one.  My husband always orders the same thing, and has for years, the Carne Macacha dinner!  I i'm more adventurous and have tried just about everything on the menu and it's all been delicious. I've never been disappointed in one single bite. Guacamole is outstanding! I had the chicken tortilla soup on our last visit and it what is hearty and delicious! It is topped with fresh avocado and tortilla strips and cheese and is even better than mine and that's saying a lot!  If you want nonsense real deal Mexican food, this is the place!"}
{"text":"Awesome neighborhood place! After scoping out possible places to dine in this area on yelp we settled on La Pinata because of the promising reviews about their stellar enchiladas! Never one to miss up on a good enchilada, we gave it a go and were very happy!!

The salsa was good, as were the chips, they kept 'em coming! I especially loved the lady with the salsa in a pitcher who wandered around the dining room giving our lil bowl refills on the regular! The tacos were awesome and so were the enchiladas!! YES! 

The food was fantastic, our only complaint was that the service was shit. We had this guy as our waiter, sorry didn't catch his name but he was ignoring us like CRAZY! We'd call for him, he'd give us the errect index finger asking for a minute and would never come! We didn't get refills on our sodas, until we asked for them from the salsa chick! Other tables that were seated after we arrived got their food before us and were out the door before us because he kept forgetting to bring us our check! 

We weren't especially rude, but after being fed up, I asked him if he was slammed that day. I knew he wasn't because there were three servers and about 12 tables filled, that's around 4 tables each and most of his other tables were just drinking and hanging out. He said no, and I asked then why are you ignoring us? No apology, nothing. He just laughed and walked away and kept on ignoring us. We tipped the salsa chick, paid and then left!

The food is AWESOME! don't get me wrong... but the service is reeeeally awful. Or atleast this guy was. The other servers seemed to be doing a better job. To my yelpers, I say: if you want good neighborhood mexican, go here. That is, If you have a lot of time on your hands and are very patient with crappy service. If you have neither of these things, then don't fret - there are PLENTY of other places nearby!"}
{"text":"Really good and LOTS of food for the price. The staff was wonderful and very timely. Pork was a little dry but the salsa is great and very spicy. They have a good happy hour to."}
{"text":"Classic style Mexican food done nicely!  

Yummy crispy cheese crisp with a limey margarita will will win my heart any day of the week!  The classic frozen with a chambord float is my favorite and they do it well here.

The salad carbon was off the chain- served on a big platter and worked for me as 2 full dinners."}
{"text":"So far we have tried La Piñata twice, and have really enjoyed it! Cool design inside. The food has been excellent, one of our new favorite Mexican restaurants. So far we've tried the fajitas, the Chile relleno, the chimichanga and another chicken dish, but can't quite remember the name. All the dishes taste authentic without being the generic Mexican food you sometimes find in AZ."}
{"text":"Some places are just so a part of your childhood that they always remain a favorite.  La Pinata is one of those, I have been going here since before I was born... no seriously, my family has been regulars for decades.

Kids grow up and it had been quite sometime since I had been to La and went there for a birthday dinner recently.  Man oh man it was a blast from the past.. not much has changed.  There was a new pinata- Chicken Little.. made me smile & the Steak Piccado was off the menu.. but other than that is same ol' same ol' (including the non-pos terminals for servers.. which made me chuckle a bit).  And you know what it works.  That is what has kept people coming here forever.

Portions are huge, flavor is even bigger.  Support your local restaurants!!


(Btw.. for those of you who have been coming here for years, there is a new AZ history mini-book series available at Barnes & Noble and some Walgreens.. Well the one about Mexicans in Early Phoenix mentions a couple times throughout the book about Pete and his early days with the band.)"}
{"text":"I have been going to La Pinata for the past 30+ years.  This is Mexican comfort food at its best.  The high quality of the food has remained the same over the years.  My \"usual\" is the Green Chili Burro, enchilada style. The green chili has consistently tender beef chunks in a rich beef and green chili gravy.  The crowning touch is the outstanding enchilada sauce.  With soft drinks, the meals for 2 cost a little over $20.  

Over the past few years we have ventured off our normal orders and have tried the chili relleno, tamales, cheese enchiladas, and the salad carbon.  Everything was absolutely delicious.  

The staff is always friendly.  Our usual waiter, Matt, always takes very good care of us.  

During the bad economy, I worried about this little family run business.  I am so happy to say that they are still going strong.  I highly recommend this restaurant to everyone."}
{"text":"La Pinata is really good Mexican at a reasonable price for enormous portions. Come hungry. Also come with patience because they don't take reservations so there will most likely be a wait"}
{"text":"Seriously meh. The beans were good, but none of us really felt that any of the other food was more than adequate. Fast and decent service, but without good food what have you got?"}
{"text":"We love this place. Been going since 2012 when they were at the old location. Still great, slightly more expensive at new location but still crazy delicious!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for an early dinner and had great service. One of only a couple of places that serves a really good chile relleno. Our waiter kept my water topped up and even turned the plate so the stem was facing away from me. Fresh modern decor, very clean and even has a flat screen TV in the mens room..."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time for lunch today. Good prices, fast service. The green chile burro was amazeballs! I'll definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"ok.  parking here is a joke.  you can come 10 minutes after they open and can't find a spot.  i get takeout because am alone and don't want eat there alone.  anyway, takeout food is generous and good but always cold.  Always."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by this place as I ride by it all the time. Finally gave it a try. The food was delicious and affordable Cool vibe and a great ambiance. They give you ample portions. Definitely worth the $$$."}
{"text":"LP's new location is IMO central Phoenix's best mexican restaurant. It is what Tee Pee used to be. Just solid, somewhat pricey but solid sloppy mexican food at its finest. Everything is great, simple, basic, by the book, mexican food. I did not like how they would not allow me to take home a meal off the children's menu for my daughter, even though the rest of our order was well above $60 but I guess that is their policy. Other than that, and the lack of attractive female bartenders, is the only qualm I have with this place."}
{"text":"Never went to the old location as it looked kinda shady. This location couldn't be any different. Very well decorated, the ambiance is top notch. The service was awesome, everyone working together. The food was awesome, I got their famous chimi and it didn't disappoint. The only thing that's weird is they opened up across the street from an established Mexican place, Sylvia's. That's kind of a dick move, but oh well let the people decide I guess. Anyway I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"still grate food the new place is awesome I love it the service is a little rushed but they are so busy the food is the same as the old place witch I normally get the chimi witch is one of the best I think today I had the shrimp enchiladas they were OK to much sauce for but tasted good but a place to try if your in the area"}
{"text":"We had lunch and the place was popular and fairly busy. We both had lunch Chimis and the green chili beef was very good. Great faculty and patio too"}
{"text":"Went to the new location last night and was sadly disappointed.  Same food, higher prices, poor layout and loud, loud, loud.  We were at a round table and couldn't hear our table mates.  The waiter had to lean over and talk loudly into our ears to tell us \"we don't have that, we don't have this.\"  Why is food on your menu if you don't have it??  If you want a family environment don't go here...the bar is the focal point of the room....the waiter said they were going for a more upscale feel....And it's reflected in the prices..... 4 alacarte tacos, an order of cheese dip and a bean burrito with no drinks....$44.00!!! What the what!!  This is Mexican food people and basic, mostly boring at that. We were excited that they were moving closer but it does us no good ...we'll travel a couple miles to Gloria's or go right across the street to Sylvia's."}
{"text":"Actually attempted to order take out from another restaurant nearby but had a bad phone experience and decided to try take out from this place instead. Glad I did. Food was excellent. We ordered the red chile combo, the taco combo and chicken fajitas.  The red chile was delicious and they didn't skimp on the meat like a lot of places do and give you mostly just sauce. Only reason for not giving a 5-star rating is that we got beef tacos instead of chicken like we ordered. They were still very good though. Order was ready at the time promised and staff was very pleasant. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Probably hands down my new favorite Mexican restaurant. The decor inside and out made me think of cafes in LA- very trendy and authentic. The food was so good- portions extremely generous and well priced for what you receive. Our server was excellent- and everyone around the restaurant helped each other out constantly. It's a bit of a drive, but we'll be back!"}
{"text":"Everything is always great here- food and service! I love their chips and salsa. This is where I take out of town visitors for Mexican food and it's always a hit."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food that I've ever had- hands down! My fiancé and I eat here almost every week. Everything on the menu is amazing! Be sure to go for Taco Tuesday. We always ask for Reese as our server. He is so kind and enthusiastic- clearly loves his job."}
{"text":"I don't normally write reviews but I just dined here for lunch with my mom and two children (5 and 7) and I don't understand why it's so busy. Don't waste your money, go somewhere else, especially if you have younger children with you.
We waited about 10 minutes once we were seated to get our drink order. Then we waited another 15 minutes for those drinks to come and for our order to be taken. Once our food arrived the waitress never came back to fill our drinks or ask how everything was.
Nothing special about the food itself. My mom and I both had bean burrito enchilada styles. Which I thought for $7 was kind of expensive because it was a large flour tortilla with a small amount of beans and bland sauce. I had to put a bunch of salsa on it to give it some flavor because all I taste was the tortilla. Also it was recommended by the waitress to wait to give my children milk until the food arrived so I thought okay, sure. However by that time they had drank water and didn't really drink the milk (which happened to be $2.50 for a children's milk!). With all of that being said we'll never go back. There are much better places around. Bad service, bland food, and expensive for what you get."}
{"text":"Had seen good reviews here on Yelp, so decided to give it a try before heading out to the fair.  I was not disappointed.  I knew it was going to be good as soon as I walked in the door.  Not only was the food absolutely delicious, but the service was outstanding.  Our server was very attentive, salsa was refilled without asking, and not only were the drinks never empty, but plenty of ice in my iced tea.  Although the ice may sound like a minor thing to some, it scores big on my ratings.

The menu has all of the traditional offerings at an affordable price.

Although I live in Buckeye, I will definitely make the trip and come back again."}
{"text":"Stopped by for happy hour with friends, glad I did! The food was delicious, the happy hour prices reasonable and the service was excellent. The portions size of each app was large enough to share with two people! Will definitely visit again"}
{"text":"Great food, authentic feel, and attentive service. 

\"Do not judge a book by its cover\" is what comes to mind when I think about our visit to La Piñata. I really enjoyed our server Jose as he was very upbeat and enthusiastic about the menu. The Guacamole appetizer  is awesome and their chips taste like they are homemade. 

Both my wife and I had great dishes - carnitas and combination fajitas. Both dishes were served with excellent homemade tortillas.  

I recommend this \"hole in the wall\" Mexican joint. It's guaranteed not to disappoint."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place, based upon a friend's recommendation and good Yelp reviews.  The chips and salsa were tasty and fresh, but that's where the goodness ended.  As an appetizer, we ordered the spinach queso dip.  The dip was runny and had the consistency of milk....not creamy at all.   For dinner, we each ordered the shrimp fajitas and they were pretty terrible.  The shrimp was cooked and served in a very sweet Asian style orange sauce (complete with real orange slices), looking and tasting more like an order of sweet and sour shrimp.  The shrimp itself was extremely rubbery and overcooked.  The beans and rice were okay, a little bland, but I shoved them in my tortilla to mask the taste and texture of the shrimp.  Drinks seemed watered down.  I felt sick the remainder of the night.  Will not be back."}
{"text":"Sopa pillas... And Mi Chilladas! Cool spot for Mexican food and cold beer! We stopped by after biking around the area on a gorgeous day. The wait can be crazy for dinner during the weekend. The Carnitas are a flavor explosion and the rice is a flaky yet tender surprise."}
{"text":"The best salsas in the valley so far. We have been going to a lot of places in the downtown, mid town, South Phoenix and Uptown Phoenix as well as here and there in other parts of the area. I detest a watery salsa, that is no more than straight from a can. La Pinata serves a thicker one with taste ( go figure that salsa should have taste) Then the hot isn't overwhelmingly out of balance with the rest of the taste in the hot salsa. It has a creamy texture and again it has flavor. That isn't even getting into the meals. They have good sized portions and great flavor."}
{"text":"This food is sooooo yummy! After years of searching finally found may favorite spot to eat. I've been twice and ordered the pollo favorites dish, and the yucitan burrito. The house marga are huge and delicious. The ambiance is great, and the owner obviously knows what good Mexican food tastes like. Maybe they will be on door dash or uber eats soon for delivery. We can only get there on date nights... So very rarely."}
{"text":"As a family who has visited this establishment more than once, I am very disappointed in the service I received recently and I will likely not be back. I was excited when this restaurant opened in my neighborhood ~ they took quite some time to offer \"to go\" food. I can appreciate  getting your bearings, but as a pregnant woman on strict bed rest who was craving Mexican food, it was disappointing that they were not able to serve us.

Their food is decent ~ tex~ mex only, if that's what you're in to. We don't go often but tonight after screwing up an at home dinner we thought we'd go. Now at home with twins, we also don't go out often but order to go food frequently.

When we ordered two meals and a kids quesadilla, we were told that they do not offer kids's meals to go.....because they do not have containers for kid's size meals. WHAT??? You can't offer me a kids quesadilla to go because the container is not the right size?

When pushed they said \"no\" because they just don't offer kids meals to go. So regular meals to go are finally ok, but no kids. If you offer it on your website, why don't you offer it to go? The manager, Terri, said that when the owner tells her something, she just does it, no questions asked.  So she couldn't even give me a a logical reason for not making me this kids meal.

With only decent food and ridiculous \"rules\" of business that you can't justify or explain, I will happily take my family's business, kids included, elsewhere."}
{"text":"Still good as they always been, new location is cool. Wish they'd bring back carne asada torta."}
{"text":"We loved this place at their old location on 19 Ave., and, we love this location, too. The new location is beautiful without the tradition kitschy decor, but, a tasteful modern feel. The food is almost the same as before, with some of the best Carne Macache in town. The chip and salsa are very good, along with the offerings of the full bar. They offer both indoor and patio seating. The service is still very good. It can get very busy, especially on weekends, but, well worth the wait."}
{"text":"Awsome Mexican food!! Especially if you're new around here and coming from California!! The owner and staff are great and perfect on their customer service. Came in for a to go and the owner was so nice and sweet she convinced us to stay and eat. Beautiful on the inside as well!! Well satisfied"}
{"text":"La Pinata feels like a true, authentic Mexican restaurant in the heart of Downtown Phoenix. Parking is a little tight (as is most parking lots in that area). The restaurant itself feels large, but cozy. Well decorated with an outside area. 
The Bentley margarita is amazing! The chips came out warm and the salsa had the perfect amount of spice. The server was very sweet and frequently checked on us. 
We came earlier in the night, but by 5:30 pm it was packed. I saw many large groups. Overall a great experience. I would recommend to anyone in the area!"}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place 5 stars. The food is always really good and fast. The reason this place is receiving 3 stars is the service and the cooks. 

Every time I order my food, I ask for no garnish. Not too big of a request, I just don't want a side salad with my Mexican food. It never fails, they GIVE ME IT ANYWAY! 

EVERY. SINGLE. TIME.

It seems small but I come here often and it happens every time. 

Second, the Grey haired older lady always has a shit attitude. Not once has she been pleasant to anyone. I don't know what her deal is but she makes the place look bad. As harsh as it sounds. 

Besides that, like I said earlier, the food is amazing. The waiters are awesome. The ladies who refill chips and drinks are always on it! If the kitchen could get their shit together a little and if the lady could be more pleasant, this place would be perfect."}
{"text":"Pros:Food is good, locations is pretty. Cons: not home made beans, bad service, very pricey."}
{"text":"This is the best Mexican food I've ever had. To be fair, I just moved here from the Midwest, but I've still eaten a LOT of Mexican in my life. La Pinata is unmatched in terms of price, portion, flavor, and overall quality. A $12 appetizer nachos supreme filled up both my girlfriend and I. If it wasn't so unbelievably flavorful we even would've had leftovers. The fried ice cream defied all expectations by coming with a chocolate tortilla. The flavor of the ice cream and toppings would've been fantastic by themselves. We will be returning on a weekly basis. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Green Chile Con Carne, Tio Pancho's Pollo Con Queso, Carne Asada, Tamalito de Mi Tia Carlotta, Flautas, Huevos Rancheros, Chicken Chimi, one for each day of the week!"}
{"text":"The food is just as awesome as it ever was but there is a problem with an old school waitress. She was no fun at the old place and it continues today. I'm kind of recognizable so she probably has it out for me. Tonight I signed my bill with a note, I wrote, \"Poor service equals poor tip, please apologize to the bussing staff\". I felt terrible stiffing the kids but I felt I needed to express how I perceived her service. The other servers were working like rock stars and showing attention to each and every table. 
To be true to the guidelines I will not mention names but many long time visitors probably know who I am talking about. It wasn't the half bowl of chips she started with or not noticing my tasty Michelada was empty when the food came and never dropped by to see if I might like another for the next 30 minutes. The next time we saw her was when we finished our meal and had to call out to get her attention for a check.
I should have written, \"Poor hospitality equals poor tip\". When she brought out our food I asked her how the seafood place was doing that moved into their old location. She replied smartly that \"She doesn't go that far south\", making me instantly feel that she just disrespected the entire neighborhood that I have enjoyed for over 50 years. I know she has gone that far south, she worked there for years. I had no idea that moving 3 and a half miles would change people so much. Not a lot of love tonight, via con dios amigos... I can name a half dozen competitors that love my business and sell Tecate."}
{"text":"The Cheesiest of the Cheese mines! Arizona's authentic capillary clogging dining experience! 
Come here for the traditional Arizona Cheese Crisp! Cheese Enchiladas! Red or Green Burros! they have all the staples. Service is always quick and friendly even when they are packed on Mother's day. Slip in the bar for some snacks or drinks and feel right at home in the cozy little nook."}
{"text":"Staff is out of this world. Very sweet and very considerate. They definitely make the experience. True Mexican food that is ALWAYS good. If you don't like what you get, they find something you do. Seriously so awesome. And great chips and salsa!"}
{"text":"I never visited the old location, but I love the way they have redone the old Mary Coyle's building on 7th Avenue and turned it into a great, upscale Mexican food restaurant. We visited with a group of seven people and had an excellent experience. Service was fast and attentive and the food was excellent.

Between us we tried everything from the carne machaca dinner to the shrimp enchiladas suizas, the enchilada combo plate, and the chimichangas. (As a side note, its funny that La Pinata also lays some claim to the chimichanga as I'd thought the debate was strictly between Macayo's in Phoenix and El Charro in Tucson who both claim to have invented the dish. La Pinata is careful not to claim to have invented the chimichanga, but they certainly play up their connection to it).

Everyone was very happy with the food they had and most of us went home with enough to eat again the next day for lunch.

Now that they are in my neighborhood I have no doubt that I will be returning!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to La Piñata for years and it is consistently delish!! Rice and beans are a deciding factor for me and theirs are YUM. I've never had anything not good! Do yourself a favor and ask for the hot salsa!"}
{"text":"I ordered the Mexican tortilla stack thing on my next visit. It was awesome. Highly recommend. Didn't leave room for friend ice cream though. Still regretting it because it looks so good. 

Read my original review for more info."}
{"text":"I had not been to this location of LaPinata since they moved from the old location awhile back.  I was pleasantly surprised.  The new location (the old Mary Coyle shop) did seem like an upgrade to me and everything was great.  We were there on Sunday, June 19 arriving about 5:15pm.  The restaurant was busy and having a large party we had called ahead and the wait was not long.

The food was very tasty and hot.  But the best part of the visit was our server.

There were 9 in my party for dinner which will challenge even the best server.  Jose N. did a superb job with our table.  Just the right touch of knowing when to fill water, salsa, etc. 

Kudos to Jose.  We look forward to dining with you again !!"}
{"text":"It's in a neighborhood that looks to be conducive to quality Mexican food.  I mean crap, Chi Chi's Cabaret is right up the road (apparently).  But I think the food failed to hit the mark in terms of outstanding Mexican/Sonoran fare.  It was lackluster and not very tasty.

Lots of decent reviews caused me to go out of my way to eat here with my family.  The prices were a little steep for the food they gave.  $12 dollar enchilada plates and $10 dinner specials.  

I'd have to say the stand out entree of the night was my plate.  I ordered the MP-1 which was basically a Green Tamale dinner.  It was actually pretty good.  I like the hint of sweetness that is present in the masa.  The beans were decent as well and tasted homemade not canned.

But there wasn't anything very 'Green' in any of the flavor of the entree.  

Otherwise, everything was pretty standard.  Service was great.  Food came fast.  But all in all, I wasn't knocked off my feet.  

I might possibly give this place another chance.  I really did like the ambience and location.  We'll see."}
{"text":"Solid food, generally good flavor.  They kick the food out the kitchen in a very timely manner!  The pollo con queso Chimi is very good.  Stay away from the chile relleno if you grew up in NM like me, you'll be disappointed!  Not a real green Chile.  It's a stuffed Anaheim Pepper, that's far from stellar!  Otherwise, excellent service, like the new location on 7th Ave!  Will go back and stick with what I know to be good."}
{"text":"This was my first time to this establishment. I gave it 4 stars because they seated us right away, swift with getting our drinks, and entree.  I ordered the seafood enchilada dinner and my wife had the chimichanga combo. I am a big connoisseur of seafood, however the enchiladas didn't pique my palet. However the chimichanga was amazing. Other than the enchiladas, everything was great. Definitely going to come back."}
{"text":"Jeez- why did this place have to move from the older location?  The quality of the food has gone south big time! The tortilla chips with the chips and salsa were all broken into small pieces. The margarita on the rocks was ALL sweet mixer and very little tequila. The red chili beef is now very greasy- total let down. My wife had the pork carnitas burro- the pork was SO dry and bland. What happened??? Seems like they became too popular too quickly at the new location and the quality control is gone. Extremely disappointed and sad. Doubt we will return."}
{"text":"Food wasn't that good. Server was kind. Leonard, one of the owners was not friendly at all. We ordered before 6pm for the happy hour special and they charged us full price and said we ordered after 6 and wouldn't give us the happy hour prices. The ticket showed 6:38pm, well after our order. I wouldn't recommend this place."}
{"text":"The food was delicious! Huge portions and a great price. I had the spinach and cheese enchiladas. They were very filling and not greasy. There was so much food that I took half home and I'm looking forward to leftovers tomorrow. The staff was attentive. The ambiance was modern. They have a nice patio. The restaurant is not very big and it fills up fast. They have a decent Mexican beer selection and a full bar. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Good chips good salsa not much selection of white meat chicken and the few dishes I've had have had a lot of fat and gristle on them .. the fajita chicken is fatty as well as the pollo Azteca the last time I ate there the chicken was very fatty and almost undercooked I ended up not eating most of it and tried to fill up on chips .. wait staff and management is great I've been coming here for years chicken cuts have gotten worse"}
{"text":"This is our favorite Mexican Restaurant to go to hands down! You can usually find us here every 2 weeks! The staff is always so kind and cheerful! The food is delicious! If I ever get married in the future I would love for this restaurant to cater for me!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty good!  For starters we ordered the cheese crisp.  It was very cheesy and surprisingly not burnt like most places are.  Then I ordered the Tio Panchos pollo con queso.   Nicely seasoned and very tasty.  I even liked the refried beans which were \"smoky\" in taste.   My wife ordered the red burro, taco, and bean tostada combo meal.   She says she liked the red chili meat in the burro.  The only thing I feel they could improve on is their salsa.   Both the regular and hot salsas were lacking flavor and \"punch\"."}
{"text":"Why is this place busy? ? ?
We stopped because of all the cars. A lot of cars must be good right? I don't know what the attraction was. The food wasn't bad.....it just wasn't anything special. I have had better many, many times. And all the cars? Really?"}
{"text":"Very welcoming atmosphere got stuck sitting in the bar stools but not bad! Good food and service"}
{"text":"I have been going to La Piñata for about 25 years. I was hesitant to go to their new location on 7th Avenue because I was unsure if it had new owners (new menu, etc.), but no (same owners and employees).  Their food has stayed consistent and their hospitality is wonderful as always. Thank you for not changing a thing! I love the new modern look. The old place on Osborn and 19th Avenue was okay, but I love the new location for sure! The food has stayed the same, DELICIOUS! Thank you!"}
{"text":"Love me some authentic Mexican good. With the pipping hot plates the food is delicious. The new location is always packed. Great chips and salsa and I recommend the beef enchiladas."}
{"text":"My uncle worked at la piñata while he was going to ASU..about 20 years ago. So I've been coming here for years. Not my go to Mexican place usually..but with their new location it could be. 

It's super cute! They needed the upgrade. 

I sat at the bar - ordered a michilada. The bartender made up their own. It was pretty good. 
The menu design is a headache. Stuff all over - confusing. I didn't see a enchilada, taco, tostada, bean and rice combo. So I went with the relleno, taco and tostada. Chips and salsa was delivered promptly. The chips - a little stale the salsa -- well it wasn't ketchup thankfully. But s jalapeño wasn't in the top 8 ingredients. 

The food was okay. For all the white people in the area.. This place will be off the cha..ughh it will be busy and do well. I'll stick to tacos atoyac. I need some spice to my life."}
{"text":"Excellent food! Stopped here in a whim. Best Mexican food I've had in a long time. I had the Chimichanga with shredded beef. Excellent flavor. Great salsa, guacamole. Ilene was an awesome server, every time I thought to even ask for something it appeared on my table before I asked. Truly great lunch."}
{"text":"Went on opening weekend so they were out of a few things.  Still trying to figure out the kitchen.  Forgiven.  However what we did order was fantastic and the owners, waitress, and overall ambience was 5 star!  Fun hip place, clean, modern- made us feel like family there."}
{"text":"Dear LJ, keep getting your beans from Sylvias,  that all she deserves! Oh and she will Charge you for the to go container!"}
{"text":"This place is a little out of my neck of the woods, but a girlfriend of mine took me here to celebrate my birthday... and what a lovely, fun birthday it was!

The dining room was very clean and the decor was lovely!!!   It was a very nice and comfortable atmosphere.   

The server was VERY attentive and genuinely seemed concerned about my $#%-ing tomato allergy and making sure my dinner would require the Paramedics and a stint in the E.R. afterwards.  

We started out with a cheese crisp and it was PERFECT.  Melt in your mouth good!  

I decided on a great green chili tamale dinner.  Unfortunately, I was not able to have the chili topping, but the tamale was delicious!  It was moist and very flavorful and nice big strips of fresh green chili!   

The beans were AMAZING!  Just the right amount of melted cheese on top...  the tortilla chips were perfect!  Nice, thin, and crispy.  Freshly made for sure. 

The server was so fantastic, he brought me a delicious and HUGE order of fried ice cream for my birthday... I'm not usually a fan of fried ice cream, but this stuff was fantastic! 

I saw on the drink menu that they serve Prickley Pear margaritas, which I cannot wait to go back and try!

Besos La Pinata!"}
{"text":"The menu has changed, and not for the better. They've changed the recipe for the ice in my tea. It never used to melt when the tea was gone. Now, it melts while I'm waiting for the tea to be refilled."}
{"text":"Love the new location! We have been eating here 20 years and it's still our number one Mexican restaurant. We drive 20 miles to have lunch/dinner here regularly. If you read a review that doesn't like the food, they're from the east coast and don't know good Mexican. The food here is consistently fantastic. Yes sometimes you wait and sometimes you have to ask for something twice BUT WHO CARES when the food is so delicious. The prices are fair, $9 for lunch. When did that become expensive? I paid $10 for a freaking salad and sandwich at paradise bakery the other day. 
Go enjoy this place, you'll be hard pressed to find anything better."}
{"text":"It is hit or miss... all depends on who is working. The host that was working, he was very friendly. The waitress was in a hurry, and had to be reminded to bring stuff, but it was busy. I think it just a good casual Mexican restaurant. The drinks will not wow you.. I suggest the ordering 2 items and doing a half and half.. Parking Sucks!! So if you cannot find a spot.. just leave and come back another day.. I have eaten here many times.. so you be the judge!"}
{"text":"Great local Mexican place. 
Decent parking and friendly staff. 
Good food. 
Solid dependable reasonably priced."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed our dinner at La Piñata  last night... it was our first time going there for dinner.
The fresh made guacamole and chips were yummy.
We had fajitas.... I had chicken, others ordered steak, and someone ordered shrimp fajitas. We all loved our dinners.... the portions are large and cooked perfectly. The entree comes with your choice of tortilla and beans  as well as the typical accompaniments.
I look forward to going back again!"}
{"text":"Manager returned my complaint with a come back we'll get it straight attitude but must not have told staff.Turned down again and lady at front told me it was lunch hour and she had no time for me and MY problem. You have a lot of people coming in so what does one 14 year customer mean to you,not much I can tell"}
{"text":"Wow.. I cant tell you how angry I left this place. They don't care if they made a mistake (seat someone else in front of you after waiting 10 minutes). All you get is attitude even from upper management. Won't be going to this place any time soon."}
{"text":"I came here on an early Friday night and there wasn't a wait, so that was nice. The parking lot is a little tight and we did notice a wait/packed lot when we left close to 7 pm. The atmosphere was rather dull and I honestly was underwhelmed from the reviews I read and the 4 star rating. The service was decent and happy hour menu had some good items available. I loved the reg. queso and the fried flour tortilla chips served  with it! Made me think I was back home in Texas! The salsa is a typical traditional red salsa that was good, but nothing to rave about. I had the la pina cocktail that was surprisingly not too sweet, but not sure if it's worth $9. I shared beef fajitas with the hubby and we were surprised with the restaurants' version of fajitas. It was literally slow cooked brisket style fajitas with a brown gravy on top? But it did come with a generous amount of refried beans and rice. Our meal came with 3 tortillas and we asked for more to take home with our leftovers. We were charged for $1.50 for 2 tortillas... I've NEVER had to pay extra for tortillas lol. I wasn't even informed it would cost extra especially since they weren't anything special . I think it's kind of silly that a restaurant at this price point feels the need to charge their customers who probably spends a good amount of money to dine at their establishment. As a couple we spent $50 with a tip and have gotten more value and satisfaction at other Mexican restaurants. Was this place terrible? No. was it worth the money? No. Was it a fun and cool atmosphere? No. 2 months ago I ordered Uber eats from a Mexican restaurant at the same price point and similar style and got waaaay more of a value and was super pleased with just a to- go order! I think that says a lot."}
{"text":"I'm only on the salsa and it's just as fabulous as always. I love the new location and the decor is beautiful. Open 5 days and the place is standing room only. To the previous negative commentor, they are way took busy to fill an order for beans. Go across the street....you'll be angry lol."}
{"text":"My husband and I love La Piñata! We were even there twice this week. 

Whether you are sitting at the bar or at a table, you will receive great service! When we sat outside, our server was energetic and attentive. The drinks and food came out quickly and were delicious. When we sat at the bar, the chips and salsa were served promptly and so were our drinks.

If you like margaritas, I highly recommend the margarita made fresh and upgrade the tequila to Hornitos. Oh my gosh, so good! 

For food, we ordered a kids meal which was a great size and price. I ordered the Salad Carbon with grilled chicken. That jalapeño ranch is delightful too! My husband ordered the Tacos Del Mar and was very satisfied. 

Also, one of my favorite things about La Piñata is their decor. The little piñata that serves as their mascot is just the cutest. Also, no matter where you sit you will be comfortable.

Check this place out, it's pretty awesome!"}
{"text":"Overall a good experience. I'd give La Piñata 3.5 stars if half stars were possible. The supremo nachos with half machaca beef & half chicken were good and plentiful, but the chips were a little soggy.  I suggest skipping the chicken as the beef had much better flavor. 
We also had a combo plate with a cheese enchilada, green corn tamale, and a guacamole taco.  All were good. It's way too much food for me though.  The tamale and taco were great the enchilada was average mainly because the sauce was just average.  
Service was good. Good atmosphere.  We dined inside , but the patio looked nice with a fire."}
{"text":"Big fan of this place, one of my  happy hour hangouts. The food is good, try their mechaca and shredded tacos. Their house margaritas are strong and tasty.  It looks alittle dive but still attracts a large following and is a local favorite in the area,  Great bartender-Daniel will take good care of you. Overall, a great family restaurant!"}
{"text":"The new place is nice and new.  Parking is a problem  unless you get there early.  Tha salsa was not spicy. Chips were marginal , a little on the cold side . I had green chili burro and  a taco . Green chili was salty. And the meat overcooked.  Taco had too much cheese . Combinations  were a little pricy. RICE was firm. Service was a little  slow . For the neighborhood  I prefer Los compadres"}
{"text":"Tried the new location. Place is much no we inside . Service  was much better . They were very attentive  . Food was good and potions were large and ftesh..my previous  complaint  was that the food was too salty. Rice and beans were over cooked.place was busy.  The price was reasonable"}
{"text":"We had dinner.we had to wait to be seated when the restaurant only had about 5 tables. I had to ask for their hot sauce twice .they gave us two basket of chips for a party or 5 and never asked whether we wanted more .I ordered the green chili and the pork was WY overcooked , the sauce was flavorful their taco meat way way too dry and it took about  10 minutes for the server to pick up the check  the bill had tips calculated for 18 and 20 percent. I would not plan on going back"}
{"text":"I go here about once a week for lunch. Love their \"burrito in my taco\" lunch special, as well as huevos rancheros, taco salad and cheese crisps. The staff make a you feel like family every time you walk in."}
{"text":"The food is fabulous. Love the chips and salsa. Everything is pretty much always amazing. Only bad thing, I'd have to say is the guacamole has very little if any flavor. I love supporting local businesses."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood restaurant.  Casual dining with a comfortable dining area.  Staff was extremely friendly and attentive.  Ordered the combo beef and chicken fajitas with corn tortillas.  Food was excellent, chicken and beef cooked perfectly, grilled vegetables, guacamole, and rancho beans were great.  Crowded for a Thursday night but order was taken promptly and food was delivered quickly. Prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"I had been once before today and on the journey I was charged twice for my meal. I alerted the person on the phone when I called ans they said it would be taken care of, it never was

But this after noon we the office went to say goodbye to an agent going on to another office. We had a few plates of assorted appetizers and of course chips. The chips were so very bland as was everything else, except for the corn tamale which was freakishly sweet. I think most of my office enjoyed. But who knows no one really said.

The wait persons are very attentive and nice."}
{"text":"This place is a staple for me and my husband.  We're trying to get through the menu, but have our favorites so it's hard.  Happy hour is great too!  House margarita is delish.  Chips & salsa - can't go wrong and can't stop eating."}
{"text":"Do you like \"Mexican\" food? Do you LOVE cheese? La Pinata is for you then!

I was surprised at the inauthenticity of the place given its location but cannot complain about the actual food. I had the Pollo Azteca and it was very tasty. The chicken was well seasoned and cooked and absolutely smothered in cheese. The portions are a perfect size: eat half at the restaurant and take half home for lunch tomorrow. Please do not attempt to eat it all in one sitting, Phoenix does not need any more morbidly obese people. Seriously, we have too many already."}
{"text":"I live in the neighborhood and have been eating here for years. (Both take out and dine in). I don't know if they have new cooks or what, but the quality of the food has slowly gone down hill in the last (6) months to the point I don't think we'll eat there again. The refried beans WERE FROM A CAN. I know homemade versus canned and these are canned. The Cheese Crisp was really lacking and very oily. The shredded beef taco had a lot of fat on the beef. This place used to serve really good Mexican food. Not so anymore. We're going back to Sylvia's La Canasta or Macayo's. Much better food, and not from a can."}
{"text":"Ah, the quintessential gringo Mexican restaurant! (And that's a good thing!)

Nothing here moves beyond stereotype, and what we'd expect to find in a good quality, long standing Mexican restaurant in this town. The food, the decor, the menus - all of it is like the Central Casting version of a Mexican Restaurant.

Ice cold Negra Modelo and a HUGE platter of nachos.
PERFECT afternoon snack!

You bet tus naglas I will be back!"}
{"text":"Came in with coworkers. This place is excellent. I had the carne asada burrito and it had tender steak that melted in my mouth. The guacamole inside was heavy on the citrus which made it pop. If you are downtown and want a good Mexican place to drop in i would really recommend La Pinata!"}
{"text":"Love this place!!!  My husband and I always sit in the bar area...great, friendly service! They have, by far, the best margaritas I have ever tasted...and I think the food is one of the better Mexican's in this area.  The fajitas are delicious and way more than enough for 2. I would also like to add, that I love the decor! And its always busy...it has a following of locals, and that is a great sign!"}
{"text":"We had excellent service and the cheese crisp was fantastic! Thanks Matt for the being a wonderful server!"}
{"text":"I've been to this place a number of times for lunch.  Quickly becoming one of my favorite Mexican restaurants in the Phoenix area.  Ordered multiple items, everything is excellent!  Recommendations include the Chorizo and eggs platter, carne asada burrito, and machacca burrito.   We've had Maggie be our sever a few occasions and she is tremendous.  Always offering recommendations, very personable and conversational.  The host (who I assume is one of the owners as well) is also wonderful to talk with.  One tip - be sure to ask for their hot salsa with your chips if you are a fan of spicy foods!"}
{"text":"For delicious Mexican food in north Phoenix, try La Piñata. This was our visit here and we were so stunned by the speed in which our food was prepared that we were sure it was meant for another table. The food was hot and fresh and well within our budget. My husband got a beef chimichanga and I got bean and cheese burrito, which we both enjoyed. Chips and salsa arrived immediately; the salsa tastes sweeter than most and is equally flavorful. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Very nice lunch for 4. All entrees enjoyable. Especially steak. Readonably priced abundance of food to take home. Nice service quiet atmosphere not fancy just good food at reasonabl prices"}
{"text":"My family and I are always hunting around town looking for good spots to eating in hopes of finding that diamond in the rough. Let me tell you we didn't find much here, the ambiance was  cold in feeling and an eye sore, it was a clash of better homes/home and garden meets  Santa Fe living room... nothing to do with good Mexican food. Anyways.... To the point... The food was just ok. Nothing I haven't"}
{"text":"Still a fan!  Their chimichangas are the best!  Their margaritas aren't as good as I remember, at least the happy hour regular one.  Too much mix?"}
{"text":"I am pretty sure that I have reviewed this place already, but I sort of feel like every time we go here I fall in love all over again!

I just ate the left overs from last night, because I couldn't manage to finish my plate after having one of the \"Casa Margaritas\" and enough chips to put me in a certain food coma... The left overs were just as good this morning as they were last night! DUH. 

This place has the best everything in town. No joke. 

Do yourself a favor, if you like spinach, get the Spinach Enchiladas dinner. 

And don't leave without trying the house margarita. On the rocks. With salt. 

Just do it."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! We walked in with 13 volleyball players, sat on their lovely patio with Matt taking such good care of us!  Good food , great service! Individual checks!"}
{"text":"Chicken Tortilla Soup, to die for! Also best Chicken enchilada! Has a neighborhood feel with very excellent food."}
{"text":"I called La piñata to help cater a party. I was appalled at the service and unwillingness to accommodate my needs. They advertise only needing two hours to put together a party platter, so when I called on Wednesday I never assumed that there would be any issues with getting one by the following Saturday. 

I had a huge number of vegetarians coming to the party and just needed to make slight modifications to some, not all, of the platter items; replacing meat with beans. Seems simple right? I guess not. I was told that I would have to call back on Thursday to speak to the owner about my modifications. 

Long story short, I'm not even sure that they make the food fresh there at this point. There was no way to make any modifications, and the owner even refused to swap the non-vegetarian options with other items from the menu that already were set up without meat. I was told by him, THE OWNER, that I needed to go somewhere else. Then he hung up on me when I replied that I would be sure to share my experience with others. 

Sad."}
{"text":"The food was most excellent, my first time here with some friends on a birthday. We got sat in a corner, five of us, waitress took our orders and we got served our drinks and didn't come back until we got served our food. I actually had to get up and go find an employee to get us more water. 

I think we got full on ice, chips and salsa by the time we got our food, but it's all good, we got full all over again. 

We didn't see our server again until we got our checks, next time I'm gonna ask we sit in the middle of the restaurant.

Again food was excellent, the service could use some improving. Pay attention, it's not a very big place."}
{"text":"Best Salsa, BEST fajitas hands down and good customer service! Been eating here since I was a little kid. Definitely, my all time favorite Mexican food restaurant! 
Need I say more?"}
{"text":"First time and loved it! The service was amazing, food came out super fast and it was delicious. Our New Mexican spot for sure!"}
{"text":"Once again, La Piñata came through with a fantastic meal!   I was very happy to hear that my favorite item, Aunt Carlotta's mini tamales, is coming back to the menu!  Thank you so much for making my mom's 82nd birthday awesome.  We were there last year on your first day, too!"}
{"text":"We have loved La Piñata since the 80s when we moved to Phoenix.  The chips and salsa are fresh, the margaritas are tangy, and the green corn tamales are the best ever.  I usually get the Aunt Carlotta's green tamale special, as I did tonight.  I'll be miserable before I'm done but I can't quit eating it!  So good!"}
{"text":"Outstanding place!  Wife had the spinach enchiladas I had the carnitas dish and they were both excellent!  Great atmosphere and we loved it.  We will be back."}
{"text":"We arrive for the first time, greeted immediately with a smile and seated promptly. Our server was fantastic, he was funny and fast. Gave great suggestions on the menu and we both were very pleased with the food, flavors, speed and accuracy of our orders. We will definitely be going back for more great food!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has been around since 1970! We were welcomed immediately and seated fast. One of the original owners, who is in his 70's, still works there and is the sweetest man. He talked and joked with us and made us feel very welcome. The salsa and chips are DELICIOUS and are made in house. Our server was adorable and so sweet. Too bad it's so far or I would love to go more often."}
{"text":"Passing through from L.A. to Austin, I wasn't expecting much. Boy was I impressed. First, the portions are huge. I felt my belt expanding with every spoonful consumed. The price was about $14 a plate, but given the huge volume of food, it's worth it.  It's basically two meals - one for now and one for sobering up later after too much tequila. Go here. Get the Pollo Azteca. It will make you happy. Love, Chicano Lawyer."}
{"text":"This is my \"go-to\" Mexican food place in the valley.  The chips are plentiful, fresh, and light - the salsa is chunky, not to spicy (but you can order hotter). Service is fast. Parking at lunch hour is difficult - but outside of the lunch hour no problem. They have been here forever. It's a family run business. Favorite dish... cheese enchilada w/ the GREEN sauce most definitely, second - try steak picada - a not to miss dish. They will make the chees crisps extra crispy upon request, which is great - and have fresh tea and great beer.  It's a simple no fuss Mexican food place.  Low cost too.  Love that they don't try to \"fancy up\" the dishes - just nice simple home style cooking - what we all want sometimes."}
{"text":"After having been regulars at the old location on 19th avenue for years (and having reviewed it a couple of times), we were excited to visit the restaurant's new home. We had great expectations, and we can honestly say that we were not disappointed whatsoever.

The new site, which was once the old Mary Coyle's ice cream parlor, has been transformed into this superb Mexican food restaurant.  Every aspect of the new place is simply head and shoulders above their old locale.The parking is more spacious and less scary, the bathrooms are modern and expansive, and the whole interior was well laid out and just evoked an upscale bistro look.

The food, which was the highlight of visiting the old location, was even better - if that was even possible. My wife commented that her chimichanga was really crispy on the bottom, and the meat was very well cooked and seasoned. And my #4 (Taco, Burro, and Tostada) was simply scrumptious. And the flan I had was simply superb. It tasted like it was even more freshly made than normal, just for us.

Even though I have rated them 4 stars in previous reviews, I had to give them 5 stars for the astounding service. Marleen, our server, was just amazingly efficient, friendly and courteous. 

All the supporting wait staff, including the lady that saw my glass empty from all the way across the room and came over to provide me a refill, were just simply astounding in their attention to detail. I had never complained about their service before in the smaller locale, but they really did elevate their performance here at the new place.

Although we had to wait for about 25 minutes, even though we didn't have to really wait before at the old location, that did not detract whatsoever from our experience. However other regulars were complaining about having to wait. They obviously haven't been to eat in downtown Gilbert on Fridays and Saturdays and wait for an arduously long period for a table - anywhere there! That will certainly get you to appreciate the diminutive time spent waiting at this restaurant.

The location, the food, the environment and decor, and most especially the service deservedly receives 5 stars from us! 

We are now truly unabashed fans of the sensational new location."}
{"text":"We ordered 2 fajita Burros, some beans and some queso. The meat in the burritos was super dry. There was practically no peppers and onions so it was basically a meat burrito and not a fajita burrito and there was no sauce or anything in it. Overall super dry and bland. The queso tasted like Velvetta. Not impressed at all."}
{"text":"Currently studying for a rather important and daunting licensing exam and decided to take a break and get out of the house for dinner with my husband. We just moved here a few weeks ago and decided to try La Piñata for the first time! The decor was really cool, and the porch looked like a fun place to hang out and eat, but it was sort of chilly so we ended up sitting inside. I ordered a mango house margarita to drink. When it arrived, it was most definitely not mango (it was lime), but I was enjoying it, so I told the waitress not to worry about having it remade and to just remove the surcharge from our ticket for the flavoring. Apparently the manager wouldn't have that and said I either had to have my drink remade or I was paying for the surcharge. So, I had the drink remade. It was right the second time. I worked in food service in varying capacities for several years and would have never, ever said that to a customer, though. When our chips & chili con queso got to the table, there was a long black hair attached to one of the chips (I'm blonde, my husband has light brown hair). I didn't say anything because the impression I was given when I complained about the margarita was that the manager would likely think I was just looking for a write off on my ticket. When our food arrived, it was great. Not a single problem and everything tasted fantastic. When we were finishing up, though, an upset employee (manager maybe?) busted into the kitchen and LOUDLY (loud enough for the entire main dining room to hear and turn around) said: \"if you guys don't start cleaning off the f****** tables outside...\". Very, very unprofessional to use profane language when dealing with employees or coworkers, and even worse to say it loud enough that customers can hear. Our server, Lindsey, was great. She did everything right! Management, on the other hand, could use some worK. Certainly not the experience I was hoping for tonight."}
{"text":"I will say that if it weren't for the great food, I would not keep coming back time and time again.

The parking stinks, the neighborhood is not very inviting, and parking in the back and walking through the dimly lit and narrow alley at times is quite revolting.

However, the food is just great here. Nothing too fancy or special, but what they do serve day in and day out is quite tasty.

From the freshly made chunky salsa along with the fresh cilantro, to the main course, and ultimately the Flan for dessert - it just all works very well for a great Mexican food experience.

We were informed that they are actually moving by the end of September. We are looking forward to enjoying their food at their new location."}
{"text":"Came here on a whim, on a stop-over for a flight to Hawaii. The front desk guy told me about this place, saying that it was worth the cab ride out there. And boy was it! The rice was so fluffy and paired with the Back Beans it was perfect. I ordered some Enchiladas and the Pollo Asada and washed it down with 2 slamming, potent Margarita's! But I punked out at the end of the meal and ordered the Gringo tourist special-Fried Ice Cream. Such is life....."}
{"text":"I moved away from Phoenix 11 years ago and was eating Cal Mex too long.  This weekend I was in Phoenix and tried La Piñata and love it.  I had forgotten how real mexican food should taste.  My mom had Cocida and was in heaven and I had Chile Verde and it was terrific.  Chips and salsa was perfect.  Fresh, thin, not greasy and warm.  Perfect compliment for the salsa.  I read the reviews on the service and my experience was just right.  I'm going back when I visit Phoenix again."}
{"text":"Whenever I am on the west side, want Mexican and want to splurge, this is the place to go! Food is definitely the best around. I've been searching for a place like this since I moved to Phoenix.  Some people may dislike the decor and blah blah, I think it gives it a distinguished feel. 

Our waitress that served our group of six was on top of her game and all her other tables. She re-filled the chips and salsa a whopping three times. I kept eating them, chip after chip, saying to myself, \"these chips are so light and the salsa is so fresh\"!

Lunch menu gives healthy portions at a great price. I had the chicken fajitas and had enough food to last a week. I am definitely going to come back to enjoy more of the variety off the menu. Of course I over ate :)

La Piñata. One word, Yum."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food by far. Service was outstanding. Food was fresh. Recommended without hesitation."}
{"text":"Went there on Mothers Day, the chicken fajitas were great! The portion size was big enough to split between two but we did not know that so we we took the leftovers home; a nice bonus! The chicken tamale my daughter ordered was huge too and very good. My other daughter ordered the taco plate with rice and beans, it looked fabulous. I did not taste it but she said it was great. We ordered the fried ice cream for desert and it was great too! The waitress was very pleasant and she made sure our drinks were always full, asked if we wanted additional salsa without us having to ask for it. 
We will go back!!!!"}
{"text":"History and nostalgia only will take you so far. La Pinata has been here for a very long time and servs decent quality mexican food. However it is nothing special or unique.

The fast service the chips was apreciated by all, the lunch menu has many options than end up costing ~$10-12 with tax and tip. 

It is hard to say much else as this place is simple mexican and my enchilada was decent.,"}
{"text":"This is hands down my favorite Mexican food restaurant! I continue trying new items each time I go and have yet to be disappointed. 
Eat.Drink.Dessert. You'll love it!"}
{"text":"Great food great service!  Waiter Anthony is a cutie and keeper"}
{"text":"This has become a place I visit weekly for lunch. They have updated their POS system, so splitting checks is no problem. They do have the most amazing tortilla chips, my mouth is watering thinking about it. Best mexican food in this area! om nom nom nom."}
{"text":"One of my longtime favorites! We love family owned restaurants who care about quality food! Their new location is beautiful and very clean. Thank you Ya Piñata ; ) we look forward to every visit!"}
{"text":"Great, authentic Mexican food. My family has been coming here since the 70's. Everything we've tried has been great!"}
{"text":"The manager is so rude. Get rid of her and I'll be back. Really lady...all I asked for was chips!!"}
{"text":"We have not been here for years (5+) the food is not as good as I remember it being. The service was OUTSTANDING!!!! Our waiter Matt was so good he had a great attitude joking with us and very pleasant. He was on the ball. Next time you dine here you have to ask for Matt."}
{"text":"I am so disappointed in this location.  They took over the old ice cream shop that used to be here.  Food is good but over priced.  Still, good food.

This has happened in multiple occasions.  Called to place an order, person on the phone asks me 2-3 times what it is.  I clarify my order and they repeat and give me the time frame.  20 mins.  They sound busy so I give them 10 extra to be safe.

We arrived to pick up our order.  It's wrong.  They ask us to wait for them to remake it.  Businesses, if you make a mistake, and your customers have to wait while you fix it, a good practice is to redeem the experience in some way so that they return.

Sadly, this has happened too many times and we're done.  Adios la piñata."}
{"text":"Food is ok, service is terrible.   Gave this new location another chance becuase a friend wanted to go there,  it was subpar at best.  They hire people who don't care, walk around clueless and laxadasical.   I used to love the old location, I won't go back to the new unless someone insists on going.  When there is a problem, it is always becuase of poor management.  Location is great,  service rates a zero and the food is ok. Taco kissi is way better."}
{"text":"This place was very delicious! I got the ranchero burro and it was so good. The plate could feed at least two people. The staff was great and so nice! I also got the fried ice cream it was good. I would recommend this place to all my friends."}
{"text":"This update is to drop La Piñata from 2 stars to one. I had been eating there from the 1970s when I worked nearby. I was sickened to think of all the dollars my family & friends and co-workers spent there over all those many decades when I read a comment on my review by the manager, \"Peter B.\" I clicked his other reviews and found that he'd stooped to putting bad reviews on his competitors. I informed each one of them and one was upset, as he said, \"I know the family.\" I reported this infraction of Yelp's standards to Yelp and they removed his negative comments from the reviews of Peter B.'s competitors. That is sad."}
{"text":"Saw this place on Check Please AZ, noticed that they have moved to a new location so we gave it a try. OMG!! The service was excellent, and the food even better. Everything was fresh and hot. The tacos were amazing and the Yucatan chimichanga was crisp with the cheese sauce smothering it."}
{"text":"Literally everything on the menu is delicious. Great lunch specials during the week and the drinks are strong and refreshing, and pair perfectly with their food. Their patio is dog friendly as long as your furry friend is on a leash and knows how to behave. They are busy every night during the standard dinner rush but it's definitely worth the wait. If you don't want to wait to be sat, go in a bit later and you're guaranteed an amazing experience."}
{"text":"My family's been going to La Pinata for years - like many of the reviewers.  The restaurant inspires loyalty. 

I've eaten a lot of Mexican food at a lot of places in both Phoenix and LA and I have to admit, La Pinata is good, really good.  

We went the other night and I got the green corn tamale, rice, and beans and a Sprite.  The tamale was moist, fluffy, and just a tad sweet - perfect.  I think the trick with good Mexican food must be the quality of ingredients.  Their rice is moist but rich and their beans are creamy with lots of tasty cheese melted on top.  Of course, there's the requisite shredded lettuce and tomato on the side but it always seems fresh and the right amount.  I've also really enjoyed the chili relleno - again quality ingredients - the cheese is well melted in the relleno, it's a good size, and the egg coating is just the right texture.  I usually get that or the green corn tamale.  My mom usually gets either the green or red burrito.  She likes to shake it up like that!

As people have mentioned, the chips and salsa are addictive.  You've got to like your salsa hot because that's what it is there.  

It's a family-owned restaurant and they've been there for years and years so you know they must be doing something right. It's not fancy but it's definitely not a hole in the wall.  There's the requisite pinatas hanging from the ceiling when you walk in and Latin art work on the walls, red booths and dark carpet but the uniforms are just polo shirts and there's no mariachi bands.  

I think if you're looking to get some hearty, tasty Mexican food, you should definitely brave Indian School and give them a try. I think you'll like them."}
{"text":"All hail the Arizona cheese crisp and this instituation that has been around since 1970 still makes a great one.

This most recent trip to Phoenix for the Jewish New Year left me longing to visit my Grandfather's grave along with my Great Aunt Florence and my Great Uncle Marshall. In order to go to the cemetery, we have to go through what is now a \"sketchy part of town\" but a part that I used to be more familiar with when I was younger. Since we were going on our way to the airport, I suggested to my Mom that we go to LP for lunch so I could get my cheese crisp fix and see if my childhood memories of this place lived up. 

The Synagogue I grew up going to was close to LP. La Pinata was the first \"real\" Mexican food restaurant I ate at and the only one my Grandparent's would go to since they never really cared for Mexican food but did like cheese crisps and chimichangas. My Great Uncle had his 50th birthday party here in 1976 and I was there. Yes, there is history. 

Most importantly, when we arrived around 2pm on Saturday afternoon, there were mostly empty tables and the decor was the same as I remembered it. Our waiter was super nice, we ordered the cheese crisp and it came out crispy, and piping hot. For those of you who don't know what a cheese crisp is, imagine a giant tortilla topped with cheese then baked or put under a broiler for a few minutes and sliced in triangles like a pizza. It is awesome and something I make at home but it is not quite the same. 

My mom ordered a spinach enchilada a la carte, I had a side of refried (lardy kind) beans and rice and the daughter had the lunch portion of steak fajitas (huge portion). Lunch menu is available M-Sat which is a very nice thing to know. 

Is this the best Mexican food ever? No. Did the taste and my memory hold up? Yes. Will I be back-DEFINITELY! 

Thank you La Pinata for being at least one thing that hasn't changed in Phoenix..."}
{"text":"On my way to see pops, had some extra time and had lunch here. I ordered their steak fajitas! Since wife hates this dish!(the smell), and she wasn't with me!!! That's what I ordered! The carne asada steak was awesome, really loved this plate. Comes with beans and rice, both were good. Chips were ok, didn't really liked the salsa. But that's not why I came here for! Great restaurant, will come back again."}
{"text":"Loved it.

I had a salad (boring I know). But it was amazing. Really fresh and delicious cheese (I have no idea what kind however), great guacamole, and a strong and wonderful 3330 margarita. 

The waiters were fairly attentive and the food didn't take too long. I think we were there until their closing time or 9:30 or 10. The restaurant appeared to be very friendly to all types of families. The atmosphere was super comfortable but still had a decor and an appropriate level of mex restaurant ambiance.

The sign out front is the best part though! It's a great place to grab a meal and judging by the margarita probably an ok place to just have chips and drinks too!"}
{"text":"I've been going to this restaurant since I was a student at nearby West High School.
It remains my favorite Mexican food in Phoenix to this day.
The recipes are great, food is always consistent and the ownership has remained in the family since inception.
I just wish I could talk the owners into opening in North Scottsdale...it takes me an hour to drive there, but worth the drive."}
{"text":"My parents suggested this centeralized meeting place for lunch today. They have good lunch specials for Mondays-Saturdays. I ordered the red beef chile burro enchilada style. It was a little bit dry so I had to order extra red sauce to make it juicer. This is a favorite for my parents, but I have to give them an average rating for taste. The portions were generous and the service was \"ok\". Again, my mom enjoyed the salsa and i feel like it needed a little more salt or flavor, like maybe fresh cilantro or lime. Would I recommend this place to my fellow Mexican food connoisseurs? No, I would not."}
{"text":"not only have I ate here several times but also worked here for about a month, I can say that absolutely everything is hand made with the exception of the tortillas. Their vegies are kept fresh in the fridge and there all about how the food looks so if a lettuce leaf is slightly brown guess what? trash time. Kitchen is deep cleaned daily and the kitchen staff is like family to each other. As a customer I love the food and the ambiance is clean and calm it is not over priced as they give good sized portions. All the servers are exceptional."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! Great decor, awesome staff. Tamales are the bomb! Yummy margaritas. New favorite Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"Yelp does it again! We flew in from Austin and San Francisco for the weekend of football games. We wanted to have great Mexican food and we found it at La Piñata.  The atmosphere, service, drinks and food were all delish! The chips were thin and warm, the guacamole was fresh and the margarita divine.  We had shredded beef flautas, beef tamales, chicken tostadas and piñata chimi...all excellent!  The rice and beans were great also.  When in Phoenix again, we will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Food is good, drinks are good, chips are great, salsa is great. The service however is not all that good, seems like every time I go back service is more neglectful..."}
{"text":"Tried to get in here several times and couldn't. Now I see why. It's excellent. I had the salad carbon with marinated steak. My wife had the machada burrito and mh daughter had the black bean tostada. We all loved it. Plenty of food as well. Good atmosphere and service.  A new favorite.  You won't be disappointed unless you can't get in."}
{"text":"La Pinata - the Home of the Chimi since 1970!!  This Phoenix institution is by far my favorite Mexican dive in Phoenix.  This place hasn't changed since the day the doors opened 40 years ago!  The best machaca chimi in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Good food! Great atmosphere! Great patio. Staff was super friendly and accommodating! We will definately return!"}
{"text":"I must say that Rose Ann and her
Staff at la piñata out did themselves! We went back and could not be happier with the service and food!   Thank you Rose Ann and Pete for taking care of us and showing that your customers matter!! We love it and will be back!!"}
{"text":"Visited there new location for the first time love the new look and plenty of staff to make sure you are well taken care of. The food is great, the location near, the atmosphere friendly and easy going. Will definitely come back"}
{"text":"This really is my favorite Mexican food around. Even though I'm mostly veggie, there's plenty of great choices. I love the green corn tamale, the black bean and rice burrito and at lunch they have a yummy black bean tostado with some kind of dressing that is like crack. And the salad with shrimp on it is excellent for the low carbers out there! Also the salsa is consistantly good. You must try their happy hour! Great Margs and Strong!!! Try the 3330 if you like um strong! If you sit in the bar, say Hi to Daniel! He's the best!"}
{"text":"We love their food. Was SO bummed to learn the new location no longer does take out, which is what we usually get. The girl on the phone was short and just said \"we are dine-in only\" as if they'd never done take out and basically hung up on me. This has always been standard phone etiquette at La Piñata but without chicken tortilla soup take out as a result, I was not happy. Nice new digs but no take out, same poor service keeps me at 3 stars."}
{"text":"Opened in 1970, La Piñata, a family affair, has been dishing up Sonora style Mexican food for 39 years. Walking into the restaurant you're immediately transported back to 1970. No time machine required, thanks to dark orange vinyl booths, plastic wood laminate tables and stucco walls. The only element missing were the traditional Mexican dresses. Though it something feels like it wasn't that long ago when those may have been retired. Even in the 70's style, La Piñata is relaxed, like going to a friend's house for dinner. The dark orange vinyl might be original but you can tell this place is loved and well cared for.  Not a strip of duct tape anywhere!

Starting with chips and salsa is almost always pure happiness. Hot and crispy, slightly salty paired with thick chunky salsa, a real bargain at free. Be warned if you think thick and chunky means mild and bland, far from it. On first bite the fresh tomato flavor bursts into your mouth followed quickly by a smack of the spicy chili heat. The 2 contrasts work so well together that it's quite difficult to stop eating until the bowl is empty. Cleverly hidden in the back as to make it more special, is another salsa, this one being almost as spicy and slightly sweet. Many Mexican restaurants have a spicier salsa they keep in back and will only bring out if requested. Ask for this one and your server will happily bring you out a dish.

For lunch La Piñata offers a variety of specials. There's a Taco in My Burro ($4.95) that uses a large flour tortilla, filling it up with ground beef, lettuce, tomatoes, cheese and onions.  Try getting your mouth around this one! Letter F ($8.95) combines a taco of your choice and a cheese enchilada served with rice and beans. The shredded beef taco was decent but it was the cheese enchilada that rocked this plate. The sauce was so wonderfully creamy you couldn't tell where the sauce ended and the melted cheese began.   A dozen of these wouldn't be enough!  A, Taco Salad ($6.50) could be considered a lighter option if the deliciously crunchy shell was missing. Who wants to give up that texture for a few hundred calories? Choice of chicken or beef and topped by large dollops of guacamole and sour cream, pure caloric heaven!   

Aside from the luncheon menu the remainder can be ordered all day. Being a great place to start, the Mary Lou ($8.75), may sound like a retired Olympic gymnast, is actually red or green chile with meat, folded into a humongous cheese crisp served with a cruet full of sour cream. The red chile has a certain creaminess that's further contrasted with thick tender cubes of beef and a spoonful of sour cream, so easy to swallow. Piñata Appetizers ($12.50) comes on a large dinner plate literally filled with miniature tacos, chimichangas, flautas, green corn tamale and a bowl of refried beans for dipping. This is the mother lode of appetizers, easily feeding 2-4 diners or for a larger appetite ordered as a main course. Being able to try so many different items at one time make this the dim sum of Mexican food.

As you can tell the portion sizes at La Piñata are extremely generous. The Tio Pancho's Pollo Con Queso ($11.95) is an entree force to be reckoned with. A deep fried burro stuffed with tender seasoned chicken and smothered in melted jalapeno cream cheese and cheddar cheese. Easily mesmerized by its girth, one bite and you'll know why you ordered it, simply fantastic. The Yucatan ($11.95) is similar in its approach though this time you're given the choice of meats chicken or beef. Once again smothered, this time in their spinach con queso sauce that combines cheese and spinach into each cheesy melty bite, napkins required.

There are also 10 combination plates for the diner who enjoys variety. The number 2 ($10.95) comes with 2 red or green cheese enchiladas with rice and beans. Again the enchiladas here are simply top drawer. Refried beans are generally the norm, but there is nothing normal about how good these taste. These refried beans could easily make up a meal on their own with a bowl of chips and salsa. Or you can wrap your fist around a Bean Burrito ($4.25) and savor each creamy smooth mouthful.

With so much savory and spicy it's nice to know that there are desserts to refresh your palate. The house made Flan ($4.25) is a great way to finish your meal. It isn't possible but the caramel sauce served with the flan would make an excellent dessert soup. Lightly syrupy with a rich buttery taste, if they do start serving bowl of it, you read it first here! Sopapilla with Honey ($2.95) is always a sticky and sweet pleaser. Lightly fried and delicately crisp on the outside, steamy chewiness on the inside all slathered with thick ropes of golden honey, it isn't just dessert but a simple pleasure.

We are blessed to have one another in our busy day to day lives. So it's nice to know that there are such welcoming places, like La Piñata, where we can tear tortillas, eat homemade beans and just enjoy and celebrate."}
{"text":"Decided to take my dad here for a late lunch Friday afternoon. When we were seated they gave us chips and salsa and they were delicious!!! My dad had the Chili Rellenos, I had the bean and cheese burrito with the queso on top, my brother's gf had a combo plate and my brother had the taco in my burrito. It was all OUTSTANDING!!! The service was great too!!!
So nice that this is also only a few minutes from my parents house too! I cannot wait to go back again!"}
{"text":"La Pinata has moved and it's for the better!  Their new location is so much nicer than the old location!  Not that I minded the old location, it's just that this new location rocks.  The interior is nice, and they have an even nicer patio to enjoy the last of the remaining temperate days.

The menu is just as good as the old menu; I might have noticed a few changes, but not a lot.  The food is still spot on, just in a more appealing environment.

Check them out, you won't be disappointed!  JM"}
{"text":"Good Mexican food, but it is like sitting in a basement (no windows, no ambiance).  Food is solid though.  I would go back if I was in the area, but would not make a special trip."}
{"text":"It's a little bit of a drive for me since I am in north Peoria but oh my god this place is to die for. Seriously worth the drive just for dinner. I am so thankful I was introduced to this place, it's so hard for me to find a DELICIOUS Mexican food place and this just takes the cake!"}
{"text":"Really good food the decor is all that but I could care less the owners are usually their walking around. Making sure everyone is satisfied with the service and food. The enchiladas are really tasty and so are the beans and rice I really like this place alot it's good food and friendly service from everyone."}
{"text":"you know what they say  if the Chili Reno is good the rest of the food is awesome    and the Chili Reno was awesome    first time at this place and it has just become my new favorite place... Mexican food is my Favorite   cant wait to bring my family and friennds here     I want to try so many different things    I so cant wait  Ill be back  ASAP  Thank you Owners of this restruant  you are doing amazing    :)"}
{"text":"Mexican done right!!!

First time here and a great experience with our server and the food.

The frozen margaritas are phenomenal and a must do in my book!

I had the chicken chimichanga with green sauce!

Yum"}
{"text":"I've always loved this place, love their new location on 7th, food is always good. Guacamole is freshly made,  try crispy cheese crisp,  always a good choice.  Flautas    seem to be handmade.  My boyfriend had ranchero machaca burrito,  sucker was huge!

Service was good, Friday night the place was packed. 
I heard one family balk at the 20 min wait and said they were going to Sylvia's across the street! Don't do it, this place worth the wait! I would not eat Sylvia's, not worth it!"}
{"text":"Food is fantastic!! Love the pork carnitas! Location is beautiful and friendly staff. Very happy with my experience"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, upscale feel with reasonable prices and excellent service.   Our server, Anthony was outstanding, he made the experience a home run.  The food was good, we had tacos (don't get ground beef, try the chicken or shredded beef).  My wife had a nice chicken breast meal and my daughter enjoyed the tamales, everything we had was good.  The patio was warm despite cold outdoor Temps with a fireplace and great ambiance.   We highly recommend and will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Food was ok, typical Mexican food but I'm not a huge fan of eating high calorie meals loaded with cheese. Lots of it so you better be hungry. 
Service was very good."}
{"text":"Daniel gave us great service with his cute hair. They kept the chips coming I was afraid I'd be to full but when the food came I made room. If I lived in the area I'd be sure to come here more often. I'd suggest you try the chimmy minis BOMB!!!!"}
{"text":"Not that the food was bad but the service... my husband and I have been going there since this location opened. Last time we went our experiences wasn't that great. So we hadn't been back in 6 months till today.  Our server was the bartender and we sat in the corner table. 1st he got my husbands order wrong... whatever,  towards the end of the meal I wanted another beer, he never came over, in fact I watched as he talks to a guy sitting at the bar ignoring us and the table next to us, so I went up and ordered my beer, he was quick to bring it out at which time we asked for to go boxes and our check... 15 minutes go by and he's still talking to the same damn guy sitting at the bar... by now I'm pissed. So I start to stand up to go talk to the owner, he sees me, runs over with the boxes, and again I have to ask for the check... I left pissed off and angry ... in my adult life I have never left such a bad tip for service, but ignoring your customers doesn't earn u a big tip. Here's a hit, if u don't have time to wait tables DONT, leave it up to the servers... WE WONT GO BACK"}
{"text":"Fantastic food.  This is a great place to eat.  Everything on the menu is consistently delicious.  Service has been stellar during every one of my visits.  Good luck finding a parking space during peak times."}
{"text":"Another superb meal for me and two friends. Same exceptional service. Will be back."}
{"text":"Our neighborhood go to that's within walking distance of home!!! They have Delicious food & margaritas - Absolutely Authentic and We Love It!!!"}
{"text":"New location interior is awesome, staff is super friendly and although the menu has not changed much the food does taste slightly better. Parking can be a challenge but I suppose I can park across the street where La CaNasty used to be. Happy hour menu items and drinks are great too."}
{"text":"La Pinata has a kick ass sign!!
The place inside is pretty lack luster and drab.

Margaritas are decent but not as good as some of these rave reviews.
Big portions of food but still kind of over pricey for what it actually is.

Husband has a tasty green tamale, decent cheese enchilada and so-so beef taco.  I got the black bean and rice burrito, big in size, beans very bland.
We got a green chile cheese crisp to start, that was good, they have a good cheese blend.

Our service was fantastic so he got tipped very well.  Good service is hard to come by.

As for Mexican food, Rositas on 22nd and McDowell is still my favorite for food and margs.  Not affiliated with any other Rositas in the valley."}
{"text":"What a great experience. 
A friend and I went in for dinner on 4/12. We ordered drinks, they came with no delay. Chips, food, water refills, \"do you need anything?\" We are good.  The service was outstanding. It seemed that all the people their cared about us having a good meal with no issues. 

The food was good, drinks good... I'll be back."}
{"text":"Best chimichanga and cheese crisps on the planet! Has been my favorite 'go-to' Mexican since 1972!  Same family owners!  Consistant and good!  Great Margaritas, too!"}
{"text":"Really good food.  Enjoyed the fast and friendly service.  Definitely will be back again.  Happy hour every Tuesday, all day!  $3 for the best margarita I had in a long time."}
{"text":"This rating is for the only thing I ever order...it's so good I can't be adventuresome enough to try anything else:  Chicken Azteca!"}
{"text":"This place was great!  I wasn't sure what to expect based on such mixed reviews, but we were pleasantly surprised.  Great food, attentive and friendly servers and a nice atmosphere.  We went for an early dinner on a Friday with our kids and sat on the patio and everyone was SO nice.  Best Mexican food we've had in a while and in a great place!  The only negative I can think of is the parking, which can definitely get tight as the restaurant gets more crowded.  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I love the new location!  They made the move from their old location on 19th Avenue and Osborn to the old Mary Coyle building on 7th Avenue and Missouri recently. Glad they moved, the old one had great food but the location was getting a little sketchy. They did a complete renovation of the inside. Nice modern Mexican theme. 

Same great food here at the new one. Excellent service. It was packed when I was here. 


Great chips and salsa to start out. 

I had the green chili quesadilla and albondigas soup for my entree. Both really good. The green chili was hot! My friends had beef chimichangas and said they were excellent.  

I am looking forward to going back here. 

Check out the new location! 

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I was completely blown away by La Pinata Restaurant! I mean I've passed by there tons of times and always thought it was just a bar but boy was I in for a surprise. 
The food was awesome, service was great and the atmosphere was classic Mexican Mission style, complete with Terra cotta floors, paintings and nice tan leather booths that were very shiny. 
I am sure I will visit many times in the future."}
{"text":"Picked up a to go order. Service was quick. A suggestion for whoever is taking orders. If someone asks what is in the beans or rice, what kind of lettuce do you use, this should be known. If not, then find out., not just say ' I don't know 'and stand there like I'm wasting your time. 

Better yet, include these items on the menu for those diners with allergies or sensitivities. 


Roseanne(sp) was very helpful."}
{"text":"So many people have said the positive things that come to my mind about this place too.  This is for sure to become one of my regular spots."}
{"text":"First time having Sonoran style Mexican food.  I took my daughter and she had the chimichanga and I had the carnitas, both dishes absolutely delicious. Our server was helpful in our choices. I look forward to eating here again even though it's not in my neighborhood."}
{"text":"Our family of 5 had an awesome dinner. 5 different meals and every dish was yummy. We were so stuffed when we left.  Our waitress was a sweet older woman that took good care of us."}
{"text":"My favorite!!!!! I frequent La Piñata mostly every week! Their frozen margarita topped with a Chambord Liqueur floater is my go to starter, afterwards I chose their always fresh Modelo Especial on tap! Peter, one of the owners, is a wonderfully great person! ALWAYS have some of the best conversations with him! Super personable and well liked individual, and also one of the MAIN reasons I continue to visit La Piñata over and over again! Definitely would recommend La Piñata to a friend, and will continue to come here again and again!"}
{"text":"I love this place! It is easily one of my favorite spots whether it's for happy hour, lunch, or dinner! The service is friendly and attentive, the food is fantastic, and the atmosphere is pretty cool too! I even had my last birthday dinner here and they did a wonderful job. Their patio is dog friendly and shaded which is a nice draw as well. I highly suggest the green corn tamales and the green chili but, honestly, I haven't had anything I didn't like. They have a great cocktail menu too!"}
{"text":"Oh, La Piñata. How I loved your old location and how I loathe the new one. Suddenly, a charming old school Mexican food with amazing food, margaritas, and servers turns into a loud, chaotic cafeteria experience with a parking lot far too small to accommodate the droves of people who (thankfully) didn't know about the other location. While the food is still the best Mexican in the city and the margaritas on point, coming here has become more of an annoyance than a joy depending on the day. I'm sure you've gotten a lot of new business, and I'm happy for you for that... but this location stinks!! It has become another loud, trendy Phoenix restaurant restaurant with no unique attributes."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, very good service, hot food, by far the best red chili meat in town."}
{"text":"I absolutely adore coming to La Pinata. I moved to the central part of Phoenix about six months ago from the west side of town, and at the recommendation of a good friend, came here. It's become one of my favorite places for Mexican food. The service is always great and attentive (I often choose to sit at the bar), and the food is to die for. Do yourself a favor and get the Mary Lou with red chile. Delicious!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a weekday lunch with friends on their suggested.  I wanted local Mexican cuisine and that's what I got.  

We had the cheese crisp, which is like a medium pizza with cheese and hot peppers.  I had the spinach quesadilla with rice and beans and a side salad.  So yummy!  My friends had the seafood quesadilla and beef tacos, each with rice and beans.  You know the food is good when conversation ends and the focus is on your lunch.  

The service was very good and I will go back for sure."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. I have been coming here since I was 3 and still havent found a mexican food place I like more. Miss the old building but the foods still good."}
{"text":"I just moved into this area in December 2012 and met \"Nita Margarita\" out shopping.  She encouraged me to at least try La Pinata because I was looking for that ultimate in Mexican food.  As I drove into the parking lot I was a little skeptical but, once inside, it was quaint, albeit a little too dark.  Using my flashlight app (yes it was that dark), I spotted the guacamole which is my absolute fav.  Our waitress came and took our drink orders and left.  After some time she returned with our drinks and started to take our order.  I asked for a side of guacamole to go with the chips as I cannot eat salsa.  We both ordered and waited...and waited......and waited.  No guacamole, nothing.  The place was not crowded or I would have taken that into consideration.  After about 20 minutes our food arrived so I again requested the guacamole.  About half way through my tostada, the guacamole came but by then we were out of chips.  The tostada was absolutely delicious and, once I did get my guacamole and chips, I enjoyed those as well.  Even though the food was really good, I have been to other good authentic Mexican restaurants that had much better service.  I am generally very postive but this hour long meal just did not set well."}
{"text":"A great old time mexican place!  The food is good and the atmosphere is what you expect for a traditional slightly run down restaurant.  The service is always great and the food is also wonderful.  It is also laid back and good environment for kids.  The parking is sometimes full and the neighborhood not so great, so try to find a space in the small area."}
{"text":"This place is great.  We use to live in the neighborhood near this place and the food is great.  My friend Alexander C., described the restaurant and its interior perfectly.  Dimly lit and cozy.  The food is like a good home cooked meal.  
There are numerous choices on the menu at a decent price. The service is good and the owner wants you to know he expects it to be good. It may be an old restaurant but it is well maintained and clean.  It's a neighborhood eatery locals like, however, it is waiting for newcomers to discover it."}
{"text":"Contemporary setting meets traditional Mexican cuisine. This place is great. The surroundings are \"modern Mexican\" with a traditional color palette and accessories with an updated urban design. Food was amazing and served in generous portions. The chicken nachos were completely loaded with chicken, cheese, pico, etc... Chimichanga was huge, smothered in sauce, and came with sour cream and guacamole. We had a large party  and the service was fantastic. Al the waiters pitched in together to provide excellent service."}
{"text":"Great service. Delicious Black Bean Tostada. They put the cheese on top of the beans so it melts then it has a full salad on top with lettuce, tomatoes, onions, cabbage, carrots, red and green peppers. With a vinaigrette dressing to give it a great flavor."}
{"text":"Everything was so great, Food , enchilada sauce so tasty, beans great. Service was good nice friendly, Price was just little high. We are from Las Vegas and Will be back mmmm. The only thing is if you bring an infant No changing table in restroom."}
{"text":"Been here at least 10 times.  Never had a bad experience.  Service is amazing and the food is even better.  Possibly the best Mexican restaurant we've been to. We would highly recommend this establishment."}
{"text":"Awesome local spot. Family friendly and cosy, with character. 

Food was pretty good, service was great."}
{"text":"By far the best Mexican food I've had so far.  Their enchiladas rock!  THE BEST MARGARITAS IN TOWN!!!  I never taste the tequila and all I need is one margarita.  I love their chips and salsa.  Their servers are always nice and very attentive.  

Definitely try this place out!"}
{"text":"So here is the thing... always give someone a second chance... don't know why I never updated this from a year ago 

I must have been cranky they didn't do takeout. They do now! I've lived in phx my whole life. Hands down some of the best Mexican food around! Try the Yucatán!"}
{"text":"Had takeout from here twice and dined-in for the first time last night - so time for a review!

This place has certainly seen the the neighbourhood change since it opened in 1969. While the fabric shop has been replaced by a liquor store and the wig store replaced by Llantera El Rincon Tires and Rims, La Piñata remains constant, serving Sonoran Mexican cuisine and famous for it's Chimichanga. If you are struggling to find La Piñata, it's right across the street from Vlad's Barbershop (who also buys gold)

Service has always been very friendly here with the owner(?) always happy to strike up a conversation about the weather or the utility companies or the state of the nation. The hostesses and the servers are customer orientated too.

In my three visits I've had the Beef Asada Burro, the Chicken Quesadilla and the Shrimp Baja. The first thing worth mentioning is the portion size, absolutely massive! Certainly enough to make a meal again the next day. The burro was packed with heaps of meat, perfectly cooked and seasoned, onions, tomatoes, cilantro - excellent. There are two chicken quesadillas on the menu, Charbroiled or Machacadilla. The charbroiled is only meat, the machacadilla adds veggies. The choice is yours, they are both great. The shrimp for the Shrimp Baja was very good, although it was probably my least favourite of the three dishes and lacked a punch.

Great Mexican beer selection (plus Bud Light if you prefer to drink water!) and although we didn't have one, the margaritas looked amazing. The place is obviously very popular because the restaurant was almost full when we came in around 6pm and the tables turned while we were there."}
{"text":"...weaned me off baby food with rice and beans.

I've been going to the Pinata since before I could walk. My grandparents were tight with the Bougarins and we ate there often. At some point (as my grandmother tells us every time we go), Pete confronted my mother and told her I shouldn't be eating that baby food, that I should be getting a proper start with an order of rice and beans. After that, I was hooked. For years I ordered the same thing with a Roy Roger (think cherry coke). Family Wedding rehearsal dinners, birthdays, out of town guests, there seemed to be no reason not to choose the Pinata for good Mexican food.

I used to sneak away from the table to play video games in the front corner of the cantina. Even today, it still feels like a room that I shouldn't be in or even curious about. Each time, our going-away treat was one of the $0.05 chocolate mints from the bowl on the host stand -- they are still selling the very same mints!

This place is more nostalgic for me than anything else. I have so many memories of so many family occasions celebrated there. The lobby is still decorated with colorful pinatas hanging from the ceiling and walls. Mariachi music still fills the air. And the blender can still be heard in the distance, chopping fresh ice for the next margarita.

As Amy already correctly identified, this is the best chips and salsa in town. On recent visits the salsa has been watery, but it could easily have been that spoonful from the big container of it back in the kitchen. Speaking of which, above the kitchen entrance is an old 1-10 lighted number display to alert the wait staff of orders ready to be served. I used to ask the waitress what her number was and watch for it. (Not much else to do when surrounded by adult-talk.)

If our guests were lingering types, we often ended up at the 31-flavors ice cream next door. It lost its franchise many years ago, no doubt caught by the inspector selling generic from the Price Club like so many other former franchises in this old chain. Today this store is just a City signs violation, like something out of Tijuana.

But back to the Pinata. It's one of the valley originals. If you haven't done it, and you think you are a Phoenician, you aren't one yet."}
{"text":"This restaurant is crazy good. It's classic Mexican food with really high quality ingredients and a clear attention to detail by the chef. The plates come out piping hot, the refried beans are incredible, the cheese is real cheese, the lettuce and tomato garnish is so fresh... the salsa tastes like a grandma made it after years and years of experimenting with recipes... resulting in the most delicious salsa that is not too spicy but spicy enough. 

The restaurant is also decorated beautifully. Not sure if it was custom designed, or was an effort by the owner - but it turned out gorgeous. No matter what time of day you go there, it feels like an intimate night time dinner in another place. Even the women's bathroom is designed beautifully (I love checking out restaurant bathroom design..)

Definitely a great date night spot as the food is delightful and the ambiance is spot on. A locally owned gem."}
{"text":"Ok, so went to the new location on 7th avenue - against my will. My friends wanted to go (I just planned on eating very little and then making a sandwich when I got home). To my surprise, the interior was really cute with lots of windows and I decided to go ahead and give this place another chance. I'm really glad I did. The food was surprisingly good. I ordered my typical go to Mexican combo, cheese enchilada and beef taco with rice and beans. Everything tasted fresh and gone was that nasty cheese from my prior visit. I have been to this new location twice so far and both times the food was great. I recommend."}
{"text":"First impression was great thanks to the man that welcomed us into the restaurant, we got seated immediately. They have a very fun environment and modern fixtures. LOVE the outside patio lighting. Atmosphere is extremely pleasant. Booth seat isn't too worn in and still bouncy! 

Got the #1- Enchiladas were delicious and served on a hot plate, had enough for leftovers, and would order again. 
Margarita was 95% tequila-AKA fantastic and forced me to take an uber home. One tequila, two tequila, three tequila, uber... Ya feel? ;) 

One negative experience was the waitress. she was not very friendly and never asked if we wanted drinks or appetizers. Ran away to the back with our IDs when we ordered a drink. Had to request through other employees to make orders and get her to the table. Never introduced herself.

In short, I enjoyed the atmosphere and food, we will be back again! Thank you!

PS please make taco Tuesday deals all day versus during happy hour times."}
{"text":"We have been 3-4 times since the new location opened on 7th Ave, north of Missouri. I have had a shredded beef chimichanga, Green Chile Burrito, Bean Burrito - red enchilada style.

Of the three entrees, the bean burrito enchilada style was the best. Their enchilada sauce is pretty good. Their salsa is decent and the service was quick. I am glad this spot opened up because the neighborhood could use a good sonoran style mexican food restaurant."}
{"text":"We had a nice first experience at La Piñata tonight. We can in with time to try some things off the happy hour menu including the machaca street tacos, the house margarita and a beer. The tacos was piled high with delicious and fresh ingredients and were my favorite of everything we tried. It comes with a verde sauce that is to die for. My husband ordered the combo #4 which came with a red chili burro, crunchy taco, and tostada. We added a side of rice to try as well. He really liked his dish, especially the tostada. Our server Reese was very helpful, friendly, and quick. Based on the food, nice and clean atmosphere, and amazing customer service experience we will be back again soon!"}
{"text":"I guess no place can get it 100%. It is crowded and we've always had to wait. No big deal for the right place. We like the patio though the fake grass wall is weird. Like many others I suppose, we have a favorite place for one dish and another place for another dish. We've only been there twice, each time we were a party of four so we tried several different dishes. Their cheese crisp is standard (not as good as Los Compadres if you like a really crispy tortilla which we do), tacos were just okay, the enchiladas were a bit better, the salsa was ordinary, beans seemed canned and the tamales were downright boring. The best dishes we had were the Pollo Azteca and the Pork Carnitas. We'll probably go back occassionally for those since they are walking distance from our house but when we want really good Mexican food, this is not our place."}
{"text":"The salsa is amazing. We ear out alot and this salsa is great. Love this place,nice atmosphere as well. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Always eat to much.  Mexican food and beer that can't  beat. Anything with the grilled steak or chicken  is delicious.   Busy but staff is always friendly and check  up on you."}
{"text":"This place was fantastic! We're from SD and was just browsing and saw the clever name, gave it a chance and was blown away by the amazing food, proportions, decor and cleanliness of it all. One of my new top 5 Mexican restaurants! Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Some of the best Mexican food I've had in a long time. The pork carnitas and the shredded beef are astounding. So are the tacos and the enchiladas. We loved every bite! The guacamole is thick and fresh and plentiful along with the house made salsa and black beans. Can't wait to come back!

Even though it was busy the service was quick and kind and we had everything within moments."}
{"text":"The new location is very nice but a lot smaller than the old location. The open dining room makes it very noisy at times. Chips were hot and fresh, salsa and hot sauce was tasty. The food came out in a timely manner served hot. The green chili chimichanga was good. Meat was nice and tender. Just wish they put more of it in the chimichanga. I felt I was getting a lot of tortilla per bite. Matthew was our server and he was awesome! Very attentive and checked on us regularly without hovering. Thank you Matthew for making our dinner experience even better."}
{"text":"We stopped by on Saturday after going to the Burton Barr library.  My mom actually used to visit this place regularly when she was pregnant with me, she reports it's just as good now!  I was pleasently surprised to see the garden fajitas on the menu, they're so delicious.  They're made up of potatos, carrots, bell peppers, mushrooms, and onions also served with the usual, beans (not sure they're vegetarian, didn't eat them and didn't ask), rice, guacamole, and sour cream.  They were very yummy, they also have spinach enchiladas and a black bean and rice burro for the veggies.
My mom had the seafood enchiladas, she raved about them, and my husband enjoyed the chicken fajitas which even at a lunch portion were huge.  

Service was pretty good, atmosphere is nice, for being around 41 years they've kept it up well.  We'll be back when we're in the area."}
{"text":"Jose the waiter hands down understands customer service even with a one time bad experience here at La Piñata. However, I beg to differ on behalf of the co-owner Ramona. After submitting a complaint to avoid future \"complaints\" about a stale taco ($3.95) she became abrupt stating you ate 3/4 of it. Agreeing to her rebuttal, I clarified I'm still paying for it. I don't want to exchange I'm simply telling you it was stale she continued to argue. My husband then interjected \"it was stale\" then she reprieved, no apology, no acknowledgement. 

Customer service goes a long way especially when restaurants like Oaxaca's closes down because of the economy as I just found out. Thank-you Jose for apologizing because of your courtesy I still give the restaurant three stars and recommend the food!"}
{"text":"Very rude management!!!!! Discriminates against the gay community. Will make you wait longer for a table if you are a member of the gay community. When management was asked about this practice their response was \"we'll work on it\"."}

{"text":"Came to the new location (have been to the old one over a dozen times) for my Mom's Birthday because this is her favorite restaurant. The new place is really nice but I miss the old charm of the old building and décor. Our server was really nice, just took a while to clear plates etc. but they were extremely busy....I know why....because this place is amazing!! From the queso dip to the shredded chicken tacos to the Mary Lou (OMG!!) everything is excellent. I got a Devil Horn Margarita that was really good too. Their hot sauce and salsa are excellent and the complimentary sopapillas for my Mom's birthday were great.

Our server was really on point with the happy hour specials which really came in to great use.

We will be back for sure. Loved everything :)

PS...GET THE MARY LOU!!! Both green and red are absolutely phenomenal. This is a quesadilla filled with either red chile or green chile and it is stuffed and huge and did I mention AMAZING???!!! Spinach dip is a must too :)"}
{"text":"Arrived 20 minutes before closing, and the door was locked. Called and was told the restaurant was closed for the night. 

Will update review when I actually am allowed to eat."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood Mexican joint.   Tasty selections, solid food.  In the old Mary Coyle location on 7th Ave.  Love the chimis, appy sampler platter.   Good selection of Mexican beers.
Recommended."}
{"text":"Warning: the food and service is still wonderful. HOWEVER, without telling us, they added an 18% tip to our check. We only had 6 people in our party. Plus the tip was AFTER taxes. 

This is super annoying as we only noticed through careful review of the bill. The credit slip still had a place for a tip. 

This left a really bad taste in our mouths."}
{"text":"Delicious food, nice ambiance and great service! My family and I have been here twice since their new relocation. What an improvement from the old building they used to be in. On our most recent visit I ordered the beef mini chimis. It would be great if there was an option to have them available 1/2 chicken and the other 1/2 beef. Nonetheless they were delicious and the cream cheese dip is out of this world! Their refried beans and rice are authentic and delicious. The prices are moderate and affordable. I look forward to my next visit to try a margarita."}
{"text":"Deliciousness - 3/5 
Happiness - 3/5

The inside definitely doesn't match the outside. It is very swanky and cool, with an impressive-looking bar in the middle.

We went with a big group. Thus, we got a wide range of food - none of it bad, but plenty of it was mediocre. The chimichangas are darn-near-perfect. Too many places lack the crunch a chimi should have. They have managed to maintain the crunchy taste while still loading it with cheese and sauce. The machaca meat was also pretty good, as were the tacos. We ordered guacamole as and appetizer and a few different types of margaritas, none of which were particularly memorable. The waiter was attentive, but over-sold the spice level of the food (I found very few things to be spicy. In fact, I was piling on the pre-meal salsa to my burrito to get the needed kick!). A lot of the dinner entrees also require extra for rice and beans. That said, the entrees are so big and hearty, virtually none of us finished our complete meals (including the heavy eaters in our group!). 

Also, I love tamales, but don't eat pork. Sadly, this disqualifies many a tamale place and La Pinata joins the group (they do have a green corn tamale too, but I simply don't like green corn ones). 

The kids meal is too expensive at six dollars, and also overloaded with beans and rice. 

The bottom line is it's nice food with big portions. The price is also very reasonable (other than the kids meals). It's definitely not the best Mexican I have had in Phoenix, but it has more than enough unique menu items to make it good to go into any good Mexican rotation."}
{"text":"The biggest problem I had with this place is we asked the waitress to split the bill in half.... It was about fifty bucks and an even number. And she ran my card at $30 and my friends card at $15 and said she \"didn't know how\" to split it. She could have asked before running our cards. Or taken a calculated and divided by 2? Idk. Pretty annoying. Other than that they do have big portions of food and some stuff is good some stuff is okay. I wouldn't recommend the steak taquitos as they are very bland and over cooked. The tio fundido chimichanga is really good though. This place is okay..."}
{"text":"We have been going to La Piñata for over 3 years now... Wait I meant 3 months now! Where have we been? Oh yeah we lived in Scottsdale. Now we live on the west side right up the street from La Piñata and that's the best part! The first time we checked it out we were hooked! 

Waiters and staff are friendly. Decor seems ok to me. piñatas hanging from the ceiling makes sense. But it's the food! Just the right amount of spices. Tastes fresh. I love the chimichangas. Shredded beef is awesome. My wife is the picky one though about her Mexican food. Big thumbs up from her too. She cannot decide what she likes best so she gets the combination with enchilada, tamale and a taco! Her only critique is she thinks the bean burros are pricey. But it's so good!

Now for our daughter's review who only likes bean and cheese burros. \"These are the best I've ever had! From now on when we get take-out this is all I want!\"
Her review should mean a lot... Like getting 5 stars from Wolfgang Puck! 

So glad we have La Piñata so close to us and look forward to eating there three times a month for the next three years! (After 3 years I am sure we'll move again)."}
{"text":"Great, authentic Mexican food.. I have never been disappointed with the food or the service!! My wife is a native of Phoenix and they have been going there since the 70's, and still look forward to their wonderful food.. Great combos, incredible refried beans, etc..."}
{"text":"La Pinata has some of the best tacos in town. These are not the ever so trendy street tacos, these are your big fat loaded crispy tacos. The shredded beef is my favorite.

I've also tried the carne quesadilla and it was packed full of flavor and dripping with cheese. 
Parking can be a pain, but it is worth circling the parking lot for the salsa and hot sauce!!"}
{"text":"I went to La Pinata when it originally opened but I didn't remember the food and service being so outstanding.

Nestled away in the the eclectic Melrose area. La Pinata really stands out. The decor is modern with a neutral pallete, but they still have traditional Mexican flare sprinkled in to add some culture. Like the three Dia Dos Los Muertos musicians pictured.

The bartender was incredibly friendly. She kept checking in on us, and was always at hand for refills. I also think it was a nice touch when she brought plastic ramekins for our to go food. The margaritas she served were great. They weren't too sweet. You could taste the tequila and skip the heartburn. She also made us beer backs since we like to create our own Beer-rita.

The food was awesome! Their salsa is chunky, and has just the right amount of kick to it. If you need more heat they also have the hot stuff on deck. The shredded chicken in my enchilada and taco was tender and juicy. The enchilada also had green chiles and salsa that made my mouth sing. I'm so over one ingredient enchiladas. The beans were rich and creamy, and the taco was packed with flavorful toppings. Loved every bite!"}
{"text":"What a wonderful time we had! My sisters and cousins and myself went to celebrate a couple of birthdays! everybody loved  there food, the wait staff was excellent! The place was decorated so beautifully! The patio looked gorgeous, they had a fire going! We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"So third visit. Last week. Decided to just stop in for some margaritas at the bar. ( Thur nite)
Sat down. It was only 8:30pm. 
We weren't even acknowledged. I mean.... no hello.... nothing. There were only 4 others at the bar. Not a lot of tables occupied. 
Finally I got the gentleman's attention. Yes.... we would like 2 margaritas please. 
Oh.... okay. ( like why do you think we are here)?
Put them down. A young lady went to hand us menus. No thanks... we are just having drinks. 
You would think we did something wrong once we weren't eating 
That was it.... never addressed us again. We easily could have had another one.... but no thanks. I'll go someone else. 
I mean.... $20 for 2 drinks.... you could have made a killing on us. 
There are people that eat and drink water only! 
We normally do both!! 
I hate to say it.... but I think we are done with LaPinata. Too bad. 
I don't expect a red carpet..... but a simple acknowledgement would be swell."}
{"text":"3 or 4... 3 or 4.. 3 or 4.. ARG! Darn this thing for not having fractions. I knew this would be tough the minute I left this place. 

I find myself in food ruts very often. I know that if I want Mexican food I can go to \"insert location here\" and leave a happy. Lately my life runs in big giant loops. I do the same things at the same times on the same days. I've decided I need to branch somehow and food is what I landed on. Its a risky one because I don't get to indulge frequently. More often then not its a risk worth taking :)

I decided there had to be other really good old school Arizona Senoran Mexican food joints. This is phoenix, the birth place of the burning hot plate, molten cheese pooling, greasy FREAKING AWESOME! I stumbled upon la pinata.. \"Home of the chimichanga since 1970\" now that's old school. I did what I always do when I run into something that claims to have been around since the dawn of time in phoenix. I emailed my Dad and Uncle and asked them about it. The whole family loves Mexican and if its been around and was decent they had to have been here.

\"Been around forever.. used to go there a few times a week.. don't make it to that area much anymore..\"

This is a good sign. I gathered a small group and got it in my mind that I was going to try one of each of the staples:
cheese crisp, guacamole, taco, enchilada, relleno, tamale

We would go here and split this then head over to Los Compadres and do the same. Never made it to #2 as the cheese and grease (not complaining) won over my will to continue.

Food:

chips hot/mild salsa:
The chips were great! Nice and crispy.. no hint of stale or greasy. Really the perfect chip in my mind. The salsa was also delicious. Was very fresh and heavy on the cilantro. It actually had some kick/spice to it. I was actually surprised how much heat it had and that most of the gringo's weren't complaining about it. For me nothing is to hot. Also really liked their hot sauce which was the normal pureed red chili, garlic, Mexican oregano variety but had no bitterness. Good stuff!

cheese crisp:
Ahhhh the cheese crisp. A magical thing made or two ingredients that somehow can be worlds different everywhere you go. This one was great! The cheese blend was excellent. It was the right combination of crispy/fold-able. Some people like them super crunchy.. I'm not one of those people. I like it right in the middle. Fold-ability is important for mass salsa, guacamole storage :) If its to crispy it just crumbles and you have salsa and grease all over your hands, plate and face. It is kind of sexy for a foodie. But you don't want a date seeing you like this. Some places really mess these up.. or even worse! fold the damn things over and still call them cheese crisps.. This is a quesadilla! not the same thing. You serve me a quesadilla when I order a cheese crisp and there's gonna be trouble.

guacamole:
Another place in the valley that knows what guacamole should be. Avocado, Lime, Lemon, Garlic, Green Onion, and Salt. Maybe a little cilantro and some small amount of pepper(serrano) for heat. None of this giant pieces of tomato and white onion nonsense. Some people love it when they ruin guac like this \"oh it tastes so fresh!\" Bad news people it makes it taste like tomatoes and onions, nothing but a filer knocking down the production cost which I assure you is not passed down to you ;)

shredded beef taco:
I actually like this one better then carlos o'briens. The meat is still very tasty and I believe the shell is fried with the meat inside. It had zero \"soggy effect,\" You know what I'm taking about, one or two bites before the bottom falls out and you finish it on your plate with a fork and knife. Its still tasty when this happens, its kind of like the cheese crisp mess, its not pretty. This was darn good but I still like the ones at Manuels better.

green corn tamale:
I can't judge this well as I don't eat these very often. It was nice and moist and had a good texture. It seemed like it might be a little overly sweet to me.

chile relleno: 
Decent. I liked the batter but the chile was to mild and their green sauce is lacking. Best ones I've ever had were at a place called the friendly dolphin in rocky point Mexico.

cheese enchilada:
I really like their cheese blend so it was hard not to like the enchilada. The corn tortilla was good. Was not a fan of the red sauce.

Red/Green Sauce:
I wasn't in love with the red or the green sauce. It wasn't horrible but far far farrrr from the best in the valley. Since this covers 90% of all Mexican food this is why this place isn't getting a higher rating.

Cons:
Very pricey! a taco, tamale, enchilada, rice and beans combo is 12.95. Cheese crisp with a side of guacamole 7.50!

Service was 3 out of 5. Felt neglected at times."}
{"text":"I was excited to place a carry out order after looking over the menu. We made our choices and called.  To our surprise, they refused to take my order and stated that they do not provide take out service - he stated they are dine in only.  What an odd decision for a restaurant to refuse extra customers without taking up a table.  It's a shame, but with all the Mexican restaurants to choose from, I'm not sure I will choose to dine in at this restaurant in the future."}
{"text":"I just tried to make a reservation for 15 people in March at 11 am on a Tuesday and was informed by a very rude female.  She said \"we do not take reservations\" and I asked if they would for 15 people and she said \" I told you we don't take reservations\" and hung up on me.  Is that the way you run a business?  Very poor customer service and I have no intentions of ever coming there or recommending it to my friends."}
{"text":"Our new favorite neighborhood Mexican spot! The green corn tamales and flautas were fantastic! The chips and salsa were fresh and excellent. Great job La Piñata! We'll see you again soon."}
{"text":"I have been coming here since I was in high school in the 70's. The food is still the same good quality and good tasting, the cheese crisp is the bomb!!!!"}
{"text":"If you've been or have lived in Phoenix for a while, you know that we have a lot of authentic Mexican restaurants. La Pinata, hands down, has one of the best Mexican dishes I've had in the valley! We ordered the chicken burrito with rice and beans on the side, and a bowl of chicken tortilla soup. Everything came out sizzling hot, fresh, and absolutely delicious. The service, although it was a busy Sunday night, was also on point.

The free chips and salsa were great. Since it was busy, we waited for about 10-15 mins for a party of two. However, once we were seated, our server was very attentive & took our orders right away. There is a small parking surrounding the restaurant. I haven't tried the drinks yet since there is a bar, but I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This is one of most favorite places to eat in Phoenix.  Highly recommend going here. The staff is always friendly, food always taste great, atmosphere is wonderful."}
{"text":"One of my favorite sit down Mexican restaurants in Phoenix. Always friendly staff. The spinach queso is delicious!"}
{"text":"Okay, so this location is new but the food is AMAZING. Being Mexican I know good Mexican food and this is what I compare all Mexican food against now. I've been going to La Piñata since I was a kid, and my parents used to go since they were in high school. The owner uses his mothers recipes and they are to die for. You will not be disappointed with the food or service here, guaranteed."}
{"text":"Steak fajitas are amazing and by far the best in town!  I am definitely a fan of the old location,  loved the old school feel to it."}
{"text":"I had moved out of state and had not been to La Pinata for over 30 years.  I now know why I remembered this Restaurant after all these years.  I ordered the combo with green chilli burrito, taco and tostado.  Everything was excellent.  The green burro was filled with tasted seasoned chunks of beef.  The shredded beef in the taco also was deliciously seasoned.  This is the type of Mexican food that I loved when growing up in Arizona!  I can't wait to go back again."}
{"text":"viva la piñata!! I suppose I have to thank the Spanish conquering of the Aztec empire which paved the way for this Gem of a restaurant. These brave restauranteurs  have started a revolution in my mouth! 

Go here and you won't  be disappointed!

Food: 10
Ambiance: 10"}
{"text":"This is absolutely the Valleys best Mexican food ever!!! The Chili Relleno is cooked to perfection with authentic white cheese! The beans and rice are the best I've ever ever had!! SO Delicious!! The bowl of Green Chili, again, is amazing!!
And now I am on a mission to try everything on the menu. We have The YuccaTan Burrito  today... Yep, so good. 
And the soft cheese crisp with tons of cheese. Tasty! 
Service is always the best and fast!!"}
{"text":"We were in the neighborhood and saw it had great reviews. We stopped in and we were blown away with flavor. 
We had the chicken quesadilla and the taco, tamale, and enchilada combo. A sweet older lady thats been coming here for years recommended the tamale and enchilada to me and I'm a glad I ordered it. Best Mexican food! We will be making the trip from chandler more frequently and the owner was especially sweet as well."}
{"text":"With all the different Mexican restaraunts, La Piniata rates very high.  The guacamole is excellent, the service fantastic, and Angilo was an excellent server."}
{"text":"The taco I had tasted like sawdust and enchilada wasn't much better. Sat at the bar and the bar tender never even asked how are meal was. We will never go back"}
{"text":"No horchata and no menudo???? What kinda Mexican restaurant is this? If id known that I would of went somewhere else. This place use to be one of my favorites here in Phoenix but the last couple times I have been here the service and food has gone down. Il give it one more time and we will see."}
{"text":"Wow. This placed just opened and I will definitely be back. 
The waiters were so friendly and eager to please. 
The decor was beautifully done and fresh feeling with a traditional Mexican vibe. 

Now... Let's talk food. Absolutely classic and authentic Mexican food. It was fresh and high quality. And...delicious. The tamales were the best I've ever tasted. Everyone at our table enjoyed their food. My husband had the chile relleno and loved it. They have a great bar too!! The margarita was the perfect addition to my dinner. 

Keep it up, La Piñata!! Can't wait for my next visit!"}
{"text":"We really like La Pinata. It's in a lousy neighborhood near my office. We found this place a couple of months ago and have probably been back 6 times. We've never had anything that wasn't great or a day with poor service. My favorite is the spinach enchilada but we've tasted about everything on the lunch specials menu and loved it all."}
{"text":"UNbelievable experience.  The food was SOO good and the service was outstanding.  Everyone who worked there was SO nice and genuine!"}
{"text":"Seriously good! Excellent service! I rate Mexican food on the basics....salsa, rice and beans. I figure if they can't do that right then there is a problem! Salsa was chunky (like I like) and flavorful. Beans and rice were delicious!  I got a cheese enchilada and beef taco. Beef was juicy and very good! Love their red sauce on the enchilada. Ordered the house margarita on the rocks! Very tasty!  I will definitely be back! Need to sit on the patio before it gets too hot!"}
{"text":"Well was very disappointed to see out favorite ice cream parlor closed but delightfully surprised at how much we like this spot!!
Service was FANTASTIC TOP notch!! 
Taco was great lots of cheese. Freshly deep fried shell not like SO MANY Phoenix mex restaurants use!  Enchilada was very good. My wife really enjoyed her chimichanga.  My moms chilli reanno was great too.  Everything we had so far was great.  We will return. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"The tamales were excellent. I also had the chicken chimichanga, it was huge and delicious. And for dessert I couldn't get enough of the sopapillas with honey."}
{"text":"Saturday I decided instead of waiting for bulk pickup I'd make a journey out of disposing my old dishwasher. A trip to a metal recycling center on 19th ave put $5.10 in my pocket to go towards lunch. I short trip north put me right where I wanted to be. Mexican grocery store and strange Catholic/holistic medicine shop on one side of the street, and an eclectic overly decorated Mexican Restaurant next to a auto shop on the other side of the street. 
La Pinata's food was well seasoned, without being overly salty, good chunky homemade salsa, and great prices with very generous portions. The \"there's a taco in my burro\" with Machaca dry beef was very good, a mildly spicy smokey flavor, and enough for 2 meals. 
Places like this are what make living in the Phoenix area fun!"}
{"text":"All of the positive reviews for this place is legit. I came here right before flying out of Phoenix; definitely in the top 3 Mexican restaurants that I have ever been to. Food was extremely flavorful and the portion was big from what I remember."}
{"text":"My coworker took me here for lunch a couple of months ago and it's now my favorite Mexican restaurant in the area.  I absolutely love the enchilada sauce that they have.  I've only gone for lunch, but the portions are large for a lunch menu- I cannot clear my plate."}
{"text":"I've been going to the old location since I was young and the food has never let me down! Went to the new location tonight and was so impressed!! Clean, bright, contemporary! I loved seeing the old faces in a new, bright place. They have the same food and the same love goes into that food. Recommend their combos to try a bunch of stuff at once, but also really love their chimichanga, fajitas and enchiladas. Old school Mexican - fatty, full plates!"}
{"text":"My family and I come to this restaurant at least once a week. This place has excellent service and you can always count on a consistent and authentic Mexican meal. If you are eating here for the first time I recommend the red Chile dinner plate or the red Mary Lou."}
{"text":"Came into town to visit my mom and had a craving for Mexican food (I'm 7 months pregnant). My mom told us she usually goes to Sylvia's across the street, but I wanted to try La Piñata since it was a new spot. Our server was Daniel and he was so sweet and very easy to talk to. The food was so good! I had the create your own burro and the red sauce is divine. My husband got the mini chimichangas and loved them. Daniel kept coming back to check on us, fill up our waters and spark up some small talk. My husband and mom ordered margaritas and I was so jealous because they looked so good. This is definitely a new and upcoming place in Phx. We are in town for a few more days and will definitely be coming back before we leave!"}
{"text":"Food was excellent! I ordered the steak fajitas which were delicious.  Salsa was great, not too spicy.  Beans and rice were tasty. Service was great. Check this place out!"}
{"text":"I can't get enough of this place. This is the same La Piñata from years before, but the new location is gorgeous. I'm one of those people who always orders the same thing when I go out, but when I try something here, it's always a winner... the Machacadilla is my new religion.
The bar here is worth the trip alone. The 3330 is the best margarita I've ever had. Honestly. And the Mis Padres margarita swirled with chambord is also aces."}
{"text":"I would never have imagined having quality Mexican food outside of my native Austin, TX, but La Piñata delivers in every category. The decor and ambiance has an authentic, old-school Mexican vibe. The staff are friendly and family oriented. And the food and drinks are truly second to none.
I enjoyed the 3330 and the Copa de Oro margaritas. Both drinks were perfectly balanced in taste, and were not short on spirit.
The Chimichanga (the family's famous original) was well executed to say the least. The tortilla was fluffy and crispy, and the machaca filling was spicy and flavorful.
La Piñata is first rate Mexican food. I can't wait to come back to Phoenix for another visit!"}
{"text":"Legit street tacos. Decent margarita. Good guac. Bland salsa. Super excitable server which beats the alternative."}
{"text":"The food is decent considering the degree of competition in Phoenix.  The service, however, is fantastic.  Great people, great place."}
{"text":"Awesome margaritas. Awesome chips and salsa. Great cantina atmosphere. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Best cheese crisp ever seriously. They win. Enchiladas, tacos, salsa, fried ice cream, hot sauce, and bean burros are all excellent! Love when we do family celebrations because we go to La piñata!!"}
{"text":"Okay seriously.... my ultimate favorite place for Mexican food! On this visit I strayed away from my usual \"La Piñata\" chimi. Wanting to try something new, I got the steak fajitas. I was nervous for the change but when I had my first bite, wow! The flavor combinations were out of this world and I was not disappointed! Now I have a second favorite dish here & I'm excited to try something else next time!"}
{"text":"Excellent authentic Mexican cuisine.  Loved the chicken tacos and tamales the most.  Very comfortable dining room.  Our waiter (Jose N.) was attentive, friendly and terrific.  Give this place a try - you will enjoy the food and drinks."}
{"text":"La piñata and I go back 20+ years. I was faster and leaner and dark family Mexican places with great Sonoran food and Frozen Margaritas with freshly fried chips and chunky salsa was just the ticket on the west side. I'm older and not so lean anymore and so is La Piñata. They still have good \"gringo\" food and I still like it. It's hard to say whether La Piñata and I are worn out or just comfortable, but I'm going to keep coming"}
{"text":"Trying the new location out and still great service, menu has many to choose from, and food.... Delicious! The staff are very attentive, and yummy chips and salsa never run out. I would def want to come back and try something else on their menu. So far my fave Mexican restaurant in the valley! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Came here on cinco de mayo and it was a packed house! Even though it was, the wait for food was not bad at all and you always had chips and salsa and margaritas filled while you wait. With cheap prices you consider quality over quantity but with this restaurant, it wins both!!! As much as I want to keep this place a secret... I highly recommend for others to try it out. The secrets out!!"}
{"text":"Hugely disappointed in this new restaurant on 7th Ave after I'd heard a little buzz about it. Although they have seafood throughout the menu, we were informed they don't serve seafood because they have too small a kitchen to handle it. Ordered veggie quesadillas (which the server said were excellent) only to be told later they've removed it from the menu. They offer beef and chicken fajitas but can't hold it and call it veggie? Asked for fajita vegetables on the side which turned out to be a dish of sautéed onions. These guys are in one of the hottest areas for new restaurants in the city, so they better get it together if they're going to survive. By the way, the space is beautifully decorated. Perhaps they should've diverted more thought to the menu for non-meat eaters and (apparently) the kitchen size."}
{"text":"YEsss! This place rules, with a vintage low key old-school Phoenix vibe. The food was ok; the atmosphere is better. Love the mosaic tiles in the front room."}
{"text":"Yum. Every time so good. I've been going here for 15 years, since they were at the 19th ave location, and plan to go for the next 15+ years. Best hot sauce and chicken tacos (among other things) in town."}
{"text":"Service was outstanding and the food was delicious. The enchiladas and tacos are phenomenal. Would recommend a visit!"}
{"text":"My go to Mexican food in Phoenix. Traditional Mexican is my favorite and that is exactly what they serve up. Great tacos, nachoa, quesadillas, rice and beans. And of course Modela on tap."}
{"text":"Ugly decor BUT fantastic food. We didn't eat any decor so I suppose it doesn't matter  that much. 
Every time we past this place it seemed that it was ALWAYS packed. We decided we wanted in, so we stopped by for dinner.  
It was a bit pricier that we expected. (And by we I mean myself and my boy toy, aka the hubs.) We soon discovered you pay for the amount of eats you receive. 

Service was great, waiters attentive. Food came out pretty quickly so no complaints there. Once the food was on our table did we realize that you do get a lot. And by a lot I mean we could both have finished one plate and been satisfied.  We ended up having our dinner for lunch the next day so it worked out. I had the Tio Panchos pollo con queso. It was delicious and very flavorful. I can't remember what my guy had as I pay no attention to him when I eat, but I do recall that he enjoyed it very much.

The bathroom wasn't the cleanest I have encountered in a restaurant but I didn't eat in there so it doesn't matter much. 

We will be going back when a craving hits for Mexican food."}
{"text":"The new location of La Pinata is really nice... not sure why it took me so long to visit. The husband and I went to La pinata before I hopped on a plane out of town. The food was tasty and not terribly expensive (though pricier than some 'americanized' Mexican food restaurants). I had the fajita chicken burrito and he had the bean and cheese burrito. He raved about his burrito. Mine was fresh and flavorful.... maybe not rave worthy, but good. I will definitely be putting La Pinata into my Mexican food rotation. 


PS they have hh here and the bar looks quite nice."}
{"text":"Ok, seriously, this place is awesome. The food is really good, the service is consistently excellent, and they make a solid margarita. I've been to this spot several times and it never disappoints. Their burritos are really good... You won't miss on this place and when the weather is nice they have a nice patio too."}
{"text":"Nice place for some good Mexican food. They have a nice selection of Margaritas as well. Sometimes there can be a wait and rates minus one start for the service we had a couple times, felt like our waiter forgot we existed and we waited for 30 min to get the check. But generally service is good."}
{"text":"Very fast and friendly service! Salsa was delicious! Ordered the Charbroiled Steak Quesadilla and they knocked it out of the park, huge serving for an appetizer! Guacamole was great, chunky and fresh! Chicken fajitas were enough for two people. Happy hour drink menu was excellent! Very swanky decor and clean on the insane with no annoyingly, loud music. Bar area is really cool and modern! Great place to go with anyone. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place has been around for years and has the best Mexican in town. My family and I have been probably been coming here for 30 years!!!!  The MP-1 Green corn tamale rice and beans is very good along with their fajitas. Bomb chips and salsa as well!!!"}
{"text":"We ate at the old location often...the new location is great! Food and service was amazing and very fast.  One of our favorite Mexican stops in the Valley..cant wait to come back..dang rice is sooo good!!"}
{"text":"This is the same great Phoenix staple relocated a little uptown. The resteraunt is smaller then the previous Osborne location but the interior got a great revamp.  EVERYTHING is A-Mazing here.  If you like chicken the tacos are great and is your a little more adventurous the Tio Pancho Pollo Connie Queso is peeeeerfect. The Ranchero burro is fabulous.  All of the staff are very friendly and many have been with this ace for years.  Support a family owned Phoenix tradition."}
{"text":"Cheese crips, queso and Machaca Beef Yucatan were amaxing. Perfect way to end 3 weeks on the road...yumm"}
{"text":"Our family has been enjoying eating at La Pinata for more than 40 years.  The new location is wonderful, and the food is, as usual, fabulous.  From the thin, warm chips with the incomparable salsas, to the delicately delicious house-made green corn tamales, the machacadilla, the savory fajitas, and the more common cheese enchiladas, it is always outstanding.  There is just no comparison.  Thank you, Bugarin Family, for continuing to serve the standard for Mexican food in the Valley!"}
{"text":"Very rude service, worst manager ever argueing with the customer, cold nasty sweet shredded beef, disgusting ceilings and air ducts, health code violations all over the place!!! 0000 zero stars not recommended. Horrible."}
{"text":"Love their cheese crisps. Started coming here regularity when Los Compadres started going down hill. Tonight my daughter had a smothered burrito and she loved it. We also ordered flour chips. They are not on the menu and are costly, but soooo worth it."}
{"text":"All I can say is BEST MEXICAN RESTAURANT in Arizona. Service, food and atmosphere are impeccable. We love the queso dip, machacadilla and grilled steak quesadilla.  The Mis Padres margaritas are amazing.  So glad La Pinata's new location still has the family vibe and the same staff and recipes!!  THE BEST!!"}
{"text":"The place doesn't even do take out orders!!!! Avoid at all cost if you're hungry looking for food. Fail."}
{"text":"Phoenix should be known for great Mexican food, but most of the places offer the same average stuff.  This one is an exception.  

Service is always great, and the food matches.

The area this place is in seems a bit sketchy sometimes, but the food makes it all worth it."}
{"text":"We loved (and had reviewed) the old location.  The place was a Phoenix tradition.  We were totally bummed to hear they were closing but then excited to hear they would take over the Mary Coyle/Appettitos building.  I was glad to have some competition for Sylvia's.  It us nice they got a regulation replica sign for the place because that is vintage stuff.  They did a really nice job of making use of the space there and I think they might have added some dining space.  I was disappointed that the agave margaritas are gone as are some of the other menu favorites.   Thank goodness they still have the machaca chimichangas because they are AWESOME and always have been.   I miss the kitsch of the old place in its 70's vibe but this is nice.  However, the prices are a little higher."}
{"text":"Back in the 70's Phoenix had a dirth of strip mall Mexican places.  Last Pinata was the busiest of them all with 2 he waits not uncommon.  They are still a great place to go for family run Mexican food.  The machaca is outstanding but I do not believe their story of inventing the chimichanga.  Agave margaritas are good too."}
{"text":"Always enjoy my experience at La Pinata, the service has been outstanding the food always consistent, I started going to the original location over 20 years ago and it just doesn't get any better than this."}
{"text":"We've lived basically down the street from La Pinata since 2003 and had never been. Tonight, that changed everything.

I found myself for the second time today in a restaurant with a penchant for cocks. Roosters, that is. It was crazy, especially when you consider I raised chickens for 4-H growing up. So, I know a thing or two about poultry.

But, enough about that. Back to the restaurant. I really was diging on the interior and all the swanky and low booths and the fowl covered walls.

The food lived up to expectations that we formed from other reviews. The portions are insanely huge. In a way where you want to ask your server, \"Do I look like 3 people? How do you think I'll even eat half of this?!?!\" But it's all good and some times I like my small stomach because I can relive tonight's experience tomorrow for lunch. Oh, happy day.

I didn't drink any alcohol during dinner (don't worry. I'm feeling fine. Not sick, not coming down with anything, won't be turning down booze, just wasn't in the mood. So quit looking at me like that. I'm drinking right now, if that makes anything better.) and I would have liked to have a lot more water, but our bill was reasonable when one consideres there were 2 margaritas and four beers drunk at the table."}
{"text":"This restaurant used to be in my neighborhood and I loved it. I am so happy for their new location, they are more exposed to more people. 
Their staff is super friendly and the food is delicious."}
{"text":"Today my mom and I had the pleasure of eating here. The food was delicious, the customer service was excellent,  and the prices were reasonable.

I got the red sauce tamale and a beef taco and was pleasantly satisfied by the large portion it came in. Every worker acknowledged me, and smiled. The manager made sure to ask us how everything was, and even asked if we would change anything about our experience. 

Also, their lunch specials were well priced, and the quality of the food is unbelievably good."}
{"text":"Hands down, some of the best Mexican food I've ever had in my life. Jose, the bartender made is feel at home! Olé"}
