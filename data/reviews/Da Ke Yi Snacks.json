{"text":"The shop is located in a small and old food court and caters mainly to small he breakfast crowd, though it ip be til 7pm.

Food wise, it's delicious. The shop focuses on cheong fun (hong kong style steamed noodles); congee and fried ghosts ( hk style sweet crueller and bread sticks). I have had the BBQ pork cheong fun, beef, mushroom and plain cheong fun. The noodles are soft and the portion is generous for $3.50. The congee is very nice; I tried the pork and century egg conger and the pork liver congee. It's flavoursome especially the pork liver one which is perfectly cooked and lightened with ginger strips and scallions. This is rustic, comfort food from the streets. That is cheap, tasty and filling.

They downsides: the place is located in a food court which is poorly maintained. As such, visually, it can be a bit of a turn off. The tables can be greasy and have sauce from previous customers. The garbage bin is full the last 2 times I visited, which were Fridays at 10am.

My advice : Bring some wet wipes or do take out. Otherwise, if u can handle the humble food court, go for it."}
{"text":"They made the best rice rolls and variety of congee the best in town. Price is cheap too. A very good place to pick up your breakfast (opens at 7am)."}
{"text":"Rice rolls weren't bad but the congee was bland.  Decent ingredients though.  

It's hard to order when there's a language barrier.  I asked for a large congee but they insisted I didn't.  The boss lady doesn't make mistakes apparently.  The people before me asked for a sour veg topping which she didn't add, but she put some on for them anyways after they complained.  Doesn't make mistakes, huh?"}
{"text":"I would recommend Da Ke Yi as a great take-out place for rice rolls and congee (note that congee is on the more watery side).  This place is famous popular among the older generation from Guangzhou China since they make delicious 'heritage rice rolls'.  There is often a line during prime dining time.  Expect a 30 mins wait if you're ordering the 'heritage rice rolls' when it's busy.  In that case, I recommend to call in advance.  I don't recommend to eat at the food court since you can feel the layer of grease on all the tables.  All in all, I am a huge fan of this place."}
{"text":"This is the definition of a hole in the wall. The food court is crowded, dirty, and loud. The wait time for rice noodles is LONG, so be prepared to withstand the far from ideal environment for 20+ minutes while you wait. Although the freshly made rice noodles taste different than the store bought one, the difference is so subtle that makes the wait here unreasonable."}
{"text":"I came here especially, to purchase a particular type of rice roll.  They are called villager home style rice rolls and originate from my father's neck of the woods, in Guangzhou China.  As nobody knows how to make them, in our family, we were told we could get them here.  My dad said that his mother used to make them for him, when he was young.  I decided to come, as my folks were over from the UK and my mum can read chinese.  The stuff that I wanted is not described in English or on their printed menu.  

We ordered 3 congees, the villager rice rolls and plain rice rolls.  The congee is probably one of the worst that I have ever eaten in Canada.  It was watery, bland and honestly, the congee of the day at T & T is even better than theirs.  The villager rice rolls were nice but contain peanuts and the rice roll wrap was too soft.  They were all stuck together and hard to seperate.  

So the congee is a 1 star and the villager rice rolls are a 3 star because not many folks make them.  So overall I would give the place 2 stars.  I have since returned to buy the villager home style rice rolls already."}
{"text":"We went there on 03 March 2018 and I must tell you it isn't the grandest of places.  It is in some kind of mall, however this food court is entered separately, as it is a strip mall.  The prices certainly were cheap but the food was quite tasty.  Also no tips, so that saved a few dollars as well.  I had the small Pork & Preserved Egg congee, at only $5.00 and my husband had the Rice Noodle Roll at $4.00.  I wasn't able to finish the bowl of congee, so they gave me a lid for take out. While sitting at the table, I noticed the other establishment in the food court had Hot & Sour Soup for $4.99.   Next time I'll try that."}
{"text":"I've been to Da Hal Yee a couple of times and I must say, this is truly an understated little place! This place is located inside a plaza diagonally across from the Chako plaza at Midland and McNicoll. 

At first when you step inside this foodcourt, most people would probably be turned off by the looks of it. As it looks quite worn down but you'll be surprised at what they have to offer. Da Hal Yee is very generous with its portions, and the prices are quite reasonable as well. $3 for an order of regular pork rice roll, you can add an extra $1 to add egg into that. Which I highly recommend! That is my ultimate favourite! If you order one of each (with and without eggs), don't be alarmed that the one with eggs would be much more fluffy and \"big\" compared to the regular one. I also tried the BBQ pork and egg rice roll, it was a little messy but still quite good. 

I forgot how much the congee was, but portion wise, you won't be disappointed. However, if you are someone who likes stronger and more savoury flavours, you might find their congee a little bland. Their rice rolls are much more recommended in comparison. 

Rice rolls have always been one of my breakfast or dim sum staples. I love it and am very picky with it. Most places can't make them as thin and soft because they generally have rice rolls pre-made/frozen, and when you order, they reheat it for you. The quality of their rice rolls remind me of freshly made ones from China. Which, all rice alls here indeed freshly made as you order them. Which explains why they are always very fresh, thin and delicious. 

Another cool little thing about this place is that they offer complimentary tea and or soy milk for their customers! I am from downtown, tea is usually not a surprise but soy milk tooo! How can you pass on that!

PS. I recommend their pork and egg rice rolls! =D (in case you're lazy to read my entire review!)"}
{"text":"A seriously no-frills food court congee and rice rolls option in a busy strip mall food court. The food is cheap, plentiful and served with the usual no nonsense attitude of people needing to get places fast. Be prepared to share a table with strangers when it gets busy and be careful where you put your elbows on the frequently used tables. 

The congee is not the best I've had. It is on the watery side but has plenty of ingredients in it so works well to wash down the rice rolls. Plenty of roll options to choose from and you can always add an egg to it if you want. The rice rolls themselves are on the thicker side, but goes well with all the sauces that you can freely pour onto your Styrofoam plate. Cheap and quick, an okay place to just eat and go when craving congee but short on cash."}
{"text":"Located in the dirty food court of mcnicole and midland this restaurant is known for their rice rolls and congee.

They offer soy milk for free in a large tea pot that you have to pour yourself. Paid roughly $10.00 for 2 rice rolls. One was beef and one was veggie with dried shrimp. Beef one was really good, veggie was a little bland. 

We waited around 15-20 mins which is longer then normal for Chinese fast food. Over would come back but only for the beef rice roll"}
{"text":"Love this place. Congee and rice rolls are delicious!! The price is good as well. The food court itselfs is pretty dirty though"}
{"text":"Located in perhaps the most ghetto food court in the city (trust me, its really ghetto!) is Da Hal Yee, a congee, noodle, rice roll place that's serves the home style scraped rice rolls that's starting to get popular in the GTA.

Was in the area and wanted a light snack so decided to try out the rice rolls here.  Ordered the Beef and Egg one and I have to say I really enjoyed it.  Rolls were light but chewy and the beef was velveted (aka marinated).  Portion was also a good size too.  I still prefer the one at Yin Ji Chang Fen but at $4.50 including tax you can't go wrong.  

They also open at 7am so I assume they have a big morning crowd as they are located right across from the Yee Hong Centre.  Good place to try out rice rolls even though its in a \"hood\" of a food court;)"}
{"text":"Fast, efficient, and value focused eats. One of my favourite places for cheung fun and congee! The eating area is far from spectacular, though its reminiscent of a B-grade hawker center in Singapore. I love topping my cheung fun with excess amounts of sesame sauce and hoisin - surefire way to startt he day right!"}
{"text":"Da Hal Yee (or Da Ke Yi) is a hidden gem that likely has the best rice noodle rolls in town! Situated in the dingy food court of an unassuming strip mall with ample parking, appearances definitely aren't everything! 

They offer an varied menu of Cantonese-style brunch and lunch items, such as congee, fried dough fritters, and Guangzhou-style rice noodles rolls. All of these can be had at really low prices (generally between $3-5 each). Portions are large, the congee isn't overloaded with MSG, and the rice noodle rolls feature ample amounts of meat filling and egg depending on what you order. Since it is situated in a small food court with a lot of other stalls, seats can be hard to find. In terms of customer service, the lady at the counter is generally fairly friendly. All in all, a great place to start off the day the right way!"}
{"text":"Da Hal Yee does have a homey feel. I can imagine that's what my Yelp friend expect me to prepare for him when he is under the weather. . A bowl of congee!

Pork Liver Congee ($4) was surprisingly cooked perfectly just enough so it has the perfect texture!

Plain Rice Noodle Roll ($2.50) has a rustic homey look too. Here the rice paste is grinded in house, a lot more effort? a lot of love? Just beware plain means loaded with green onions.

Located inside a food court,  the price includes HST."}
{"text":"Best breakfast with rice noodle and congee in town. They grind their rice flour from rice freshly. It is their secret of the tasty steamed rice noodles. In addition to the usual toppings of beef, shrimp, pork, and fish, one can add a dollar to include an egg. The breakfast menu serves from 7:00am to 11:00am. The congee remains the taste from the childhood of home. The price is awesome. Combo of rice noodles and congee for $5-6. My top choice of homey and comfort food."}
