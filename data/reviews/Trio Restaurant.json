{"text":"came here for summerlicious dinner for 25 for a three course meal.  food was ok at this price but not great.  tuna steak on the summerlicious menu is well done (not a fan) but the sauce is quite good.  steak was bland.  service wasd quite good and being a hotel bar decor is nice.  kind of what you would expect for a hotel restaurant - pricey and average food."}
{"text":"Poor restaurant. Managers reception first evening had me waiting a half hour between drinks. For breakfast, Hair in my oatmeal first morning. Second morning ordered bacon and eggs. Came cold, unbuttered toast and dry potatoes. Won't eat here again."}
{"text":"Went here for summerlicious with my girlfriend and the food was mediocre. The only item that wasn't half bad but was still cold was the roast beef sandwich which was ok, the fries were nothing special....my girlfriend had ordered the cornmeal breaded fish which used the same crap batter as the appetizer! The desert again was nothing special tasted like something defrosted from no frills. Wouldn't recommend a trip to this restaurant save your money and hit fabricca if your looking for a north toronto restaurant in the summerlicious list. But on a side note the staff here is very friendly and helpful....but doesn't fix the food"}
{"text":"Went here today for the summerlicious lunch menu. Service was fine, the server had a friendly smile although he didn't refill our waters.

The reason for the 2 star rating is the food. I had a peach gazpacho to start, a roast beef sandwich, and a key lime pie. The gazpacho was interesting, kind of sweet, but not bad. The sandwich would have been good except the beef was ice cold in the middle. I guess it wasn't nuked long enough. Their version of a key lime pie was also different than I expected. Tasted like key lime cookie dough.

I came with a group of four and one of their sandwiches was cold too. Maybe we just had bad luck."}
{"text":"Went there for breakfast yesterday. Tried out the buffet and it was $15.99, too steep for mediocre. The floors were dirty with food everywhere. The Caucasian waitstaff was very helpful."}
{"text":"This is for their breakfast.

They have a small breakfast buffet for $15. It's pastries, eggs, cheese cubes, tomato slices, and oatmeal. The eggs were horrifically bad. They were effectively egg water with some yellow goo in it. Not good. Very, very, not good.

On the plus side, they refilled the coffee regularly. Minus side, very expensive if you don't eat the pastries."}
{"text":"I went here with my friend for winterlicios and wasn't too impressed. I was firstly disappointed with how it looked, the pictures were definitely misleading. When we walked in the waiter pointed us to seat somewhere and didn't care to walk us to our seat. I found that a bit odd. I went with the lobster soup and my friend got the salmon arugula salad. I did not like the soup at all but my friend seemed to enjoy it so we ended up swaping appetizers. The bread for the soup came about 5 mins after we got our appetizers. For the main dish my friend went with the steak which wasn't too bad. I went with the salmon, it wasn't anything above average. I personally found that the salmon could be more juicer. Also when the waitress brought us the main dish she ran back with my dish because something was missing ... turned out the kitchen was out of it. Typically I'm used to the waitress telling me before my meal comes out that something may be missing.  Our desserts were the only thing that I can say was delicious. My friend got the apple crumble and I got the trio cake. They were simple but good.  I probably won't come here again. I wasn't too impressed with the food or service."}
{"text":"Came here for winterlicous yesterday.   Menu sounded good and parking at the hotel after 6pm is only $5.  

We had a party of 11 tonight and were ready to try some food.   Menu sounded good and pictures looked good .

I bring the wife with me so we can try different things.    For the appetizer course I had the lobster bisque and she had an Atlantic salmon gravlax.   Salmon gravlax came with 2 small pieces of smoked salmon and lots of arugala. the lobster bisque was a little flat no real taste and also was a little disappointed that there was no lobster in any of the 6 soups that were ordered .

On to the main course.   I had the steak medium rare (but came out medium well).   Actually of the steaks that were ordered medium rare , 3 /4 came medium to medium rare, and the one lucky person who wouldn't trade got a rare one.  The other dish we ordered as a main was the spinach ravioli.  This was quite nice.   Big raviolis and I liked the sauce.   Felt it was quite tasty.  I used the complimentary warm bread to soak up the sauce. 

For dessert I think this was the most disappointing part of the meal.   Had the apple pie with ice cream which is my go to.   It was not warm apple pie, possibly left overs  from the breakfast buffet at the hotel.  The ice cream was tasty.   My wife ordered the trio of eclairs, one cocoa, vanilla and coffee.  This dish was completely hopeless.   Firstly it was tiny, the eclairs were so dry I assume they were about 3 days old.   The piping was not tasty 

The servers were nice and attentive which was one of the only pluses that this place had.   Will probably not be going back."}
{"text":"We live like 5 mins down the street and never knew that this hidden gem exist. Tonight we came here for Winterlicious. 5 adults and 2 children- a party of 7.  Very accommodating for the children, they served us a burger and even split it into half without having us to tell them since the kids didn't want anything from the Winterlicous menus. 

I've really enjoyed the salmon stack, good portion of salmon and avocado was fresh. Nice presentation aswell.

For the main, I've ordered the herb crusted halibut and saut√©ed shrimp. The warm quinoa and edamame went very well with it. It was a good marriage of everything! I really enjoyed it.

Excellent service, very attentive and friendly staff.

The warm sticky toffee was very good. Not too sweet. I preferred this over the cheesecake in a jar. To be honest, this is one of the better Winterlicous that I have been to this year and very satisfied. $33 for all three course and they validate the underground parking. Perfect for winter season too. I will be back to try out the regular menu. I think this is how Winterlicious is supposed to be, good food and good service for customers to test it out. If it's good we come back to try the regular menu. I've already recommended this restaurant to one of my foodie friend on Facebook!"}
{"text":"I think the best part of the Trio menu are the three items from the Pleasure Menu:

Macadamia nut crusted goat cheese & brie truffle, rocket, fig jam
Crisp golden crab cake, roasted corn relish, sweet chili sauce
Lamb Sliders, brioche bun, feta cheese, mint & roasted garlic aioli

These items are absolutely to die for and definitely a favourite of mine, especially the goat cheese. However...

I came here for lunch last week with my coworkers and opted for the Panko Crusted Atlantic Salmon ($22). I have a citrus allergy so the dish had to be modified slightly. Unfortunately, this modification left me with just a 6oz piece of panko crusted salmon on a bed of Israeli couscous.

The salmon, although I've had fresher, was cooked perfectly as well as the couscous but overall, the dish was very bland and uneventful.

It's pretty quiet here during lunch time and it's right on the subway line so it's easy to but there are definitely better restaurants to go to in the area."}
{"text":"Nestled in North York's Novotel Trio offers a range in culinary options, as well accommodates those who are vegetarian.  The atmoshere is dim and quite small, considering its not a big restaurant. The chairs we sat in were not as comfy as the others, at first I though i needed to loose some weight as I'd assumed I broke the chair, but in fact was adjustable. oh well. 
Their service was exceptional,  as they were able to help recommend some dishes that were popular, and they were bang on correct!! as were their options on their Winterlicious menu. 
For Starters: their Vegetarian steak was surprisingly delicious, again I love meat, so today I decided to curve my meat cravings for some vegetarian option for starters.  The veg steak consisted of portobello mushrooms, quinoa, cream cheese, pumpkin seeds, and sundried cranberries.  The flavors worked well togther... 4/5
Mains...meat was my beat! Their 4hr slow cooked short ribs, well presented, and taste was at my level of expectation.  juicy, tending, flavorful..all the main components of a perfect entree 5/5
Dessert was their warm Cakery Goodness which was an English sticky toffee pudding, just pure delight!!! 4.5."}
{"text":"Came for the Summerlicious 2012 dinner menu. Best $25 I've spent in a long time. One does not expect much from a restaurant in a Novotel. 

I had the Smoked Mackerel Salad, the Orca Bay Tuna Steak , and the Two Tone Chocolate Mousse Cake. 

There wasn't a lot of mackerel in the mackerel salad but the pieces were really flavorful. The tuna steak offered a nice portion and was so good you really just wanted to shovel it in as quickly as possible. The cake, again, was a nice size and went down smooth. 

For $25, the low end of the summerlicious spectrum, I really enjoyed what I got.

Service was a bit slow to start but stepped up considerably after ordering.

The dining room is nothing much but there's a cool lobby."}
{"text":"I was staying in the hotel for an extended period, and was happy to see a restaurant off the lobby.

The one time I chose to have breakfast in the restaurant was a disaster. There is a breakfast buffet, but when I saw how many kids were running around sticking their hands in the food, taking things and putting them back, I said \"Hell, no!\" to the buffet and ordered off the menu. 

Service was horrendous. I was basically ignored for almost 10 minutes until I flagged a server for coffee and a menu. I guess they assume everyone gets the buffet. 

When I finally got my breakfast, it was nothing short of atrocious - I asked for poached eggs, crispy bacon and pancakes. The eggs were poached fine, but came in a little bowl of water - I guess it was too much trouble to drain them first. The bacon had been deep-fried because, apparently, the cook doesn't know how to make the bacon crispy on the grill (This is what the server told me after two failed attempts at sending me deep-fried bacon) The pancakes were rubbery and inedible. My server apologized and offered the buffet at no charge (no thanks!) I wasn't charged for my meal, but I left hungry and went elsewhere. 

A few days later, I went back for dinner, hoping for a different chef. I ordered the backyard risotto ($17) and added salmon ($9). Thank goodness it WAS a different chef, and this guy was good! I really enjoyed the risotto and the salmon was cooked to my liking (still moist and not over cooked).

I feel the prices are too high for this kind of restaurant (seriously lacking in service and ambiance) but at least I was happy with my dinner. Still, $26 for a salmon risotto in this caliber of restaurant is highway robbery. That's what I would expect to pay in a MUCH nicer establishment. Plus, they don't have a happy hour. What kind of hotel bar doesn't offer happy hour? This place could certainly use the business because it was pretty much empty every night. When I would get back from work, I would pass the empty restaurant on my way out to another place that was either better, cheaper, or at least offered drink/food specials to lure people in. In 19 nights of staying there, I ate dinner in the restaurant ONCE (and ordered room service once). I think that says something. Lots of places in this neighbourhood offer daily specials. When you're eating out every meal, it's nice if you can get a discount here and there. 

I would probably not return here, since I'm new to the city and looking to explore so many places. But I sure hope the evening chef can show the breakfast cook how to make bacon without touching the deep-fryer."}
{"text":"Came here for winterlicious.  The food was only mediocre. It basically looks better than it tastes. I most likely won't be coming back here or recommending this restaurant to anyone anytime soon. Thanks for the meal."}
{"text":"Trio is A-OK with the caveat that I'm handicapping this review for its convenience when I stay at the Novotel.

Is the food great?  Definitely not.  But it's convenient and serviceable for anyone staying at the hotel.

They have a breakfast buffet or you can choose to order off the menu.  Very typical breakfast selections of eggs, sausage, bacon, potatoes.  Nothing spectacular, but it gets the job done.

For dinner they've got some decent beers on tap and I'm fond of the pulled pork sandwich on pretzel bun.  I've also tried the burger, which was very average.

In a pinch, this will suffice.  And it's a good option to get for room service if you're feeling too lazy to make it out into the world.

I certainly wouldn't recommend going out of your way to come here."}
{"text":"We went to the Trio Restaurant for Saturday dinner. Trio Restaurant is located in the Novotel hotel. The dining room is beautifully decorated. The restaurant was almost empty which is surprising since it was Saturday night and the restaurants in that area are usually full. The service was not that great since our server was absent most of the time even though the restaurant was not busy. She only filled our water glasses only once.

The menu is very small with maybe twelve items? My friend ordered the butternut squash soup for an appetizer. She said that it was very good. I ordered the calamari. The calamari was huge and delicious. My friend ordered the fish and chip. The fish and chip portion was large and very good. I ordered the butter chicken dish. It was very good, but the rice that came with it was hard and dry.

Would we go back? Probably since the food was very good. We would like to return for the Winterlicious specials."}
{"text":"We had booked a reservation about a month in advance for Christmas dinner with our families. Then the ice storm hit. I can understand not having the menu we wanted. Their power was out until the evening before. But there's no excuse as to why it would take an hour to get our drink orders or appetizers. We complained to the hostess & our meals were free but despite that it wasn't worth it Why? I asked for my dish to be done without dairy, but they must've put some in because not long after I was sick to my stomach. Others in our party also got quite sick even though they ordered different dishes than mine. Also the waiters couldn't keep straight who ordered what. Won't be coming back again."}
{"text":"Came here for Winterlicious 2016. Parking garage is to the left of the hotel entrance on Park Home Ave and parking ticket can be validated by your server. 

Small restaurant but I did like how it was well lit (dimly lit restaurants make me sleepy during my meal). Service was great! We never had to ask for anything twice and they always responded promptly to all our requests. 

Chicken pate was my favourite; the Cumberland sauce was fruity but I suspect some wine was used in the making. Delicious with the biscotti but you could spread it on the bread if you have any left over. The ravioli wasn't as spicy as I was expecting...in fact, I don't remember it being spicy at all. Nice crispy ravioli shell! Quinoa salad was good as well.

The cod loin comes with noodles in a green curry broth but when we got the dish, the broth was clear and really had no green curry flavour at all...not sure what happened there. My parents said the crispy shrimps were very spicy but I would say it was only mildly spicy. The cod itself was pretty good, maybe ever so slightly overcooked. 

There were 4 jumbo pasta shells and they were quite filling with the ricotta cheese stuffing. Red pepper cream sauce was a little bland. 

Braised chicken was quite tender and probably the best of the 3 we've tried. Vegetable mix that came with the chicken was cooked in a yummy sauce.

Desserts were great overall but a tad too sweet. I do recommend the sticky toffee pudding out of all the choices.

Only suggestions for the restaurant would be to include a butter knife in the bundle of cutlery provided and also a separate plate to place the utensils. There is no tablecloth on the table and we used the one plate we had for bread so it left nowhere to put the utensils but on the table. Neither if these little glitches ruined my existence but just somEthing to consider for their business. 

Prices are pretty affordable in their regular menu. Would consider going back to try a few things :)"}
{"text":"Came here with a party of 6 for their Winterlicious dinner. Reservations were made via OpenTable and I was called twice to confirm our reservation and give them my credit card number. I have never given my credit card number for a reservation, and I never will.

When we showed up, the reservation was still there - phew! No CC needed! At 6:30pm, they managed to already run out of the spinach ravioli and the trio of eclairs so most of us got the lobster bisque, medium rare steaks and cheesecake to finish. Plus the table got two baskets of warm bread to share. The lobster bisque was good but would have been better served hot rather than just warm (note: bisques are meant to be creamy and/or pureed soups - do not expect chunks of anything in here). The steaks were good and had a wine, mushroom and pearl onion sauce on top laid over a bed of mashed potatoes and grilled vegetables - also would have been better if it was served a bit warmer. The cheesecakes were the only odd dish as every bite tasted more like flour than it did cheese - would recommend the chocolate cake or the apple crumble over this.

Overall, the food was pretty good for $28 a person. I wouldn't make it a regular visit but maybe once in a while. Plus staff were really nice."}

Summerlicious 2012 Lunch Experience ($15)

Appetizer: Wild Mushroom Arancini
- The risotto balls are quite massive
- taste wise is not bad but I could not really taste all the ingredient listed: Arugula, Cherry Tomato,Chickpea, Red Onion

Main: Open Faced Taco Sandwich
- Pass!!! This is one of the worst main I ever had in a Summerlicious restaurant
- The kitchen just put so much salt in it and it just unbearable. I could only eat 2 slices and give up.
- I have to drink glass and glass of water for the rest of the evening!

Dessert: Tarfuto
- Quite standard with Dulce de leche

Services is extremely slow. The restaurant is basically empty at 2:30 pm and it still takes a long time for my food to arrive. 

Come here only if you have a long lunch break... or on your day off. Maybe just skip!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I ate here twice already because the steak is amazing. I've had the pasta as well which was very delicious. Not a very busy restaurant which is surprising because the food is quality!"}
