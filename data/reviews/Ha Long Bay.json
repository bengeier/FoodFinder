{"text":"I was unfortunately very dissatisfied with my visit. After having been recommended by more than one person for their Thai food, the Pad Thai and Massaman dishes were bland and lacked many key ingredients. The Pad Thai was particularly sparse lacking leeks, raddish, and especially the bean sprouts....and it isn't Pad Thai without bean sprouts.

In short, isn't worth the wait or the hype."}
{"text":"It was very crowded on a Friday night.  Come ready to wait.  Our reported 15 to 20 minute wait was more like an hour.  It was very warm in the restaurant. I ordered the squash curry as recommended by fellow yelpers.  It was just okay; pork was dry, but sauce and squash were yummy.  Pad thai was too sweet for my liking.  Service was efficient, but not very attentive.  My request for limes was seemingly heard but never fulfilled."}
{"text":"Best asian food in town, period. The lunch menu is fantastic and reasonable. Dinner offers a variety of additional choices. The younger waitresses can be lukewarm at times. But the food here is beyond comparison in Madison for Laotian/Thai cuisine. I used to like Lao Lan Xang but this place is exponentially better than them or Sa Bai Thong."}
{"text":"Service is SLOWWWWWWWWWWWW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I understand new restaurants usually are slow when they first open but this place has made ZERO improvement in terms of speed. Expect to wait a long time for your food.

The food... it's a hit or miss. You have to find the items they make well. Pho is okay. The vietnamese dishes in general are decent. The Thai dishes are laughable though. Don't order the Thai food!"}
{"text":"Yum!

Went to Ha Long Bay for a weekday lunch. It was so tasty! I had a Thai noodle soup made with coconut milk, rice vermicelli, and red curry. They let you select how spicy you want your meal on a scale of one to three stars. I went right in the middle and selected medium spice, which was perfect for me. My friend chose hot, which was a little much for her. 

I also had a taste of my dining companion's Pad Thai, which was also ridiculously good!

The waiter was very nice, but service was surprisingly slow. We ended up waiting about 40 minutes for our food, which was unexpected for what we had ordered. This was only an issue because it was a work day and we needed to get back. 

The atmosphere of Ha Long Bay is nice. It feels cozy, but not too crowded, even on a busy day.

I look forward to going back!"}
{"text":"This is a hidden jewel of a Thai Restaurant. I had driven past it for over a year, thinking, \"Hmm...I should try that place sometime.\" Well, I finally did. And I've been back three times in the past month. My first excursion produced some of the best Pad Thai I've ever eaten. The second, Pad See Eew that was solid, but a bit too oily for my taste. (And I have decided that  large rice noodles are textural anathema to me--something akin to platyhelminthes--but that's not HLB's fault.) The broccoli in that dish was amazingly good. For my third trip, I ordered Tom Yum soup, and it was fantastic. Every time I go to HLB, I end up with more food than I can eat. Which also resulted in the discovery that cold Thai food for breakfast is a wonderful thing."}
{"text":"The food is delicious and reasonably priced.  The service is at times slow and somewhat inattentive, but never unpleasant.   This is not the place it go if you're looking to get in and out.  But slow food is the way to go anyhow."}
{"text":"Delicious pan-SE Asian cuisine. Can't decide between pad thai, drunken noodles, or pho tonight? Just come here and you won't be disappointed. I typically order one of the MD noodle dishes - a more authentic experience than your typical chow mein, with pan-fried noodles. The sauce makes them lose a bit of that crunch, but mmmm so good."}
{"text":"Everything is wonderful and the place has a great environment. Definitely worth the wait that there usually is for a table."}
{"text":"I've been here three times and love their BBQ Pork pad thai. Their portions are pretty big and you will most likely end up taking some of it home because you can't finish it all. The downside to this place is the service isn't that great. The servers are not that friendly and it takes a long time for your food to arrive. Is it worth going? Yeah, if you're willing to wait and put up with the snobby servers."}
{"text":"If I could eat here every day, life would be great. Everything is good. Their Pho' will take you to your happy place."}
{"text":"Great fabulous restaurant! Love the chai tea and sticky mango rice!! Should enjoy a set of pho here and also the fried rice! A lot to explore and I will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I came to Ha Long Bay 4-5 times over the past 3 months after a recommendation from a classmate. My relationship with this restaurant is a perfect example of a roller coaster ride. I actually want to give it 3.5 instead of 3 because I still have hope that our relationship is gonna get better.
I first came here and tried the fried rice, while hubby got the chicken steamed in banana leaves (listed under Hmong dishes). My fried rice was good (not special), while the chicken in banana leaves were horrible and tasteless. 
The second time we were here was on a Saturday because we wanted to try the Vietnamese crepe (served only on weekends). Being a huge Bourdain and Zimmern's fans, I always want to try this dish (probably the best one can only be obtained in Vietnam). I was dissapointed with this  dish, but I am not an expert so I won't say anything else except that I won't order it or recommend anyone to order this.
My third time: I got the pho, and hubby got the green curry noodle with chicken. Both were surprisingly delicious, and made me come back for the forth time. The pho was fresh, brothy, and the green curry noodle soup was warm and comforting, and a little spicy. But you can just adjust the spiciness as you like it.
My forth time: I got the red curry noodle, and a friend of mine ordered the vietnamese beef stew with rice. Both were great, but I still like my hubby's green curry noodle soup better. My red curry soup were a bit too sweet for me.

Another fave from this place is the fried egg roll. It's crispy and I like the sweet/spicy/salty sauce. The thai iced tea is good, but I haven't had thai iced tea in Madison that aren't good.

The service, however, was not the best. It's a little slow even when the place's not busy. I personally don't like the setting because the waiter is actually on the other side of the restaurant and not facing you. They only occasionally check on the customers and it can be a while before they notice that you need something from them (ready to order, get the check, etc).


So, Ha Long Bay.. i am looking forward to try more dishes that you offer!"}
{"text":"Food is AMAZING !
But never go here after 6:00pm on a Friday or Saturday. With a party of 4 we waited 80 minutes for a table when we were told a 30 minute wait. Now here as a couple we were told a 30 minute wait. After 20 min with 5 parties still in front of us we switched and ordered takeout . We've been here 40 minutes so far and at least 2 parties of two that arrived before us are still waiting !!!! How is that for 30 minutes ??? Ridiculous."}
{"text":"The service was excellent. The food was great. Seasoned well. We could have received a larger portion of white rice. It was not enough to go around for the entrees we ordered. I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"If this isn't your favorite or one of your favorite restaurants in Madison I'll assume you're into Arby's and you're ok with that. I haven't eaten everything here but the Thai red curry, Thai peanut chicken are some of the best dishes I've ever had in any city. They aren't known for dumplings but they certainly should be. The flavor of the soy/ginger (and whatever else) dipping sauce makes me cry just thinking about how good it is. If you haven't ever been here do yourself a favor and go. You'll wait 20-30 minutes but you'll realize why there was a wait with your first bite. Please feel free to invite me with. I could eat here all day every day."}
{"text":"Best Pho in town probably but it does not mean its great. If you want some this is the place to go to"}
{"text":"OK, with two stars I think I am being kind. I read the reviews of this place and thought, Wow, let's try it. Now to preface this a bit, I lived in Thailand for two years and throughout other parts of Asian for many years, sooo. having said that there is good Thai food in Madison, really good but just not here.
Started off with the Vietnamese spring rolls, not much filling in them, very cheaply made, but the vinegar sauce, well, watered down so much it  was really hard to taste the vinegar, the peanuts that should accompany this was so meager that you could count the individual little nuggets floating on the surface of the water, errr... vinegar.
Lame and poor.
I ordered the Padthai and my wife ordered the chicken curry. Almost 55 minutes later we got our food. Busy but, what to say?
The curry was decent, creamy, the squash was good, good proportion of chicken to the dish but nothing to scream about. 
The Padthai, I was somewhat horrified when it came out. It was watery with enough red sauce, almost like spaghetti, Padthai is not supposed to be like that, Not even here in the states have I seen it made like this, way too sweet and runny consistency, not what Padthai is about. No veggies in it at all, noodles sauce, lots of sauce and the shrimp. Now the shrimp, the only good thing about the whole dish was that they were almost perfectly cooked and good size, oh and there was the egg in it. Really the worst Padthai I have ever had, anywhere. 
There are so much better other Thai restaurants in the area that are really good, too bad."}
{"text":"This place deserves credit for developing a varied and consistently satisfying menu, but their service hasn't kept up with their rising popularity. 

The menu is a step or two up from the typical Asian place - extensive and varied and pretty good in all categories.  But the past two dinners I've eaten at Ha Long Bay on busy evenings have been disappointing. We understood waiting for a table for five while several other groups were seated before us (that arrived after us). But then our server brought four entrees out and made us wait another 10 minutes for the fifth. We ate in an uncomfortably hot dining room, literally sweating over our food, while smelly vaporized oil billowed out of the kitchen. 

They need to step up the quality of their service, the BTUs of their air-conditioning, and the power of their kitchen exhaust fans if I'm going to be a long-term customer."}
{"text":"I want to give them 3.5 stars.  I've been to Ha Long Bay 3 times now, with my most recent visit last night.  The first time I came, i tried the Vietnamese weekend special crepes (very good, interesting, 4.5 of 5), the sweet n sour pork (3 of 5, much too sweet), the \"LS7\", (4.5 of 5, thought a tiny bit dry), and last night I had the Pad Thai with pork.  It's seriously good.  It's a little sweet but very tasty with a decent amount of pork.  The place is pretty loud and a little cold but service is overally pretty good and food is decent.  I had to compare to other restaurants but I'd have to say Lao Llang Xang is better overall but if you want Thai food, this is the only acceptable place.  Oh, and the guy who said the pho is super good at Ha Long, well, it's too sweet, too!  Saigon Noodles is def better for pho.  I'll go again but only if I want Thai."}
{"text":"Not bad, if you need ambiance.  I had the TC4, yellow curry chicken, rice and Thai tea.  I asked for mild, and should have said hot.  The Thai tea was on the sweet side, if you know what I mean.  None the less, it was good.  The main dish proportion, a lot.  I only ate with the amount of rice they provided, and had leftovers.  Would I visit again?  Let me put it this way, if this was my local Thai joint, then yes.  But since I am an out of towner, probably not.  Need to check out the rest....."}
{"text":"The best Thai curries in Madison, -- I've tried everywhere I know of -- Ha Long Bay's expansive menu also includes specialties from a variety of ethnicities, and should provide something delicious for anyone with even a slight inclination towards Southeast Asian cuisine.

In addition to the superlative curries and curry soups, each of which I'd recommend highly, the pan-fried tofu dumplings and the curry puffs, both appetizers, are excellent, and I prefer their tasty Thai iced tea to wash it all down. Afterwards, it's hard to escape without trying the mango sticky rice or red bean sesame balls for dessert, and even the post-meal guava candies are notably pleasant.

The only real knock is that the service, though eminently friendly, can run just a bit slow, especially given that they are usually jam-packed with hungry patrons. I often prefer ordering carryout if the plan is to dine during peak hours, sometimes taking a nice meal for two to enjoy by the nearby lakefront.

On the whole, the quality of the ingredients, the exquisite flavors and preparation make Ha Long Bay one of the very best restaurants in the city, and every bit deserving of the full five stars."}
{"text":"This Vietnamese fusion place has the best eggrolls I have ever had. It combines a spring roll and a fried eggroll in one. I could just order this and be happy with that!Great service and nice staff.  I wish the pho had more ingredients given to you (they kinda skimp on the basil leaves compared to other places) and the pad thai is better at Thai Basil. Get the eggrolls though!"}
{"text":"I am of Vietnamese descent, and I have grown up on home-cooked Viet food. Now that I'm in Wisconsin, I find good Viet food hard a prized commodity. On a cold winter day in Madtown, this place has food to warm the soul. So far, this has been the best Asian food I've had in Madison.

Ha Long Bay offers both Vietnamese and Thai food. I've gone here 4 times, and I would recommend the Pho and Pad Thai. I got a couple of the pan-fried noodle dishes, and they don't quite compare to home-cooking. The Pho gives you a large portion of the beloved soup, and the broth is great. I don't care if they don't cook it in the traditional fashion; whatever they're doing is working. 

If you want spicy food, be sure to ask for at least a 4 (out of 5). It may be just because the Midwest doesn't do spicy quite the same way as the South, but a 3 is a cakewalk and barely adds a kick.


If you are planning to do a family-style meal, two of the noodle dishes could feed 3 people. Dishes are large for one person (not a complaint), but not quite large enough for 2 people."}
{"text":"Great restaurant, food was excellent, prices reasonable, service was outstanding, and left with more than expected :D"}
{"text":"Long, straggly hair found deep in an order of fried rice? Free of charge.

Not going back to Ha Long Bay? Also free of charge. Or as the think tank at MasterCard would like you to think, PRICELESS.

Regardless of the stray hair, a good rule to go by is that if a restaurant serves more than fifty items, as is the case at HLB, they're bound to be frozen and terrible... excepting the items dipped in the deep fryer (the egg rolls are quite nice, but obviously frozen!)

The service.        Well.         Slow.

Regardless of slow service and the errant hair, Ha Long is a comfy place to dine if you've got the time and inclination for a by-the-book Pan-asian dining experience. It's salty, swimming in oil, and close to your door if you live in the Wil-Mar neighborhood."}
{"text":"Ordered the shrimp pho and it was not a pho I've had in past.
Some cabbage was in the salty soup and vegetables were not fresh. Shrimp was not fully cooked and waitress service was really bad.
I am not coming back to this place.
Totally wasted my time and $$."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite place to eat in Madison... and no I don't go around saying that about just any place. The staff is so nice and attentive, the atmosphere is relaxing (it's a good place to sit and read or have conversation, enjoy with a big group over yummy food)... which brings me to the food. The food!!!!  Delicious, exquisite, mouth watering Pho. I could eat this every day for the rest of my life and die happy and satisfied. Actually it's all good here! They serve both vietnamese and thai food. For dessert get the sweet sticky rice with mango or icecream. The ultimate comfort food. Sigh... I love you Ha Long Bay. :)"}
{"text":"I reluctantly give Ha Long Bay 3 stars.

I say reluctantly because I want to give them more, but I can't in good conscience. The food is (usually) amazing. We order from them frequently, but despite them having the best Thai and Vietnamese food in town (in addition to Lao), we often opt to order elsewhere to avoid various hassles.

One is that there is usually no parking. Not completely their fault. More importantly, we usually order and are told it will be anywhere from 20-45 minutes. Regardless of how long we are told it will take, when we go to pick up at the specified time or even a little bit afterwards, we wait at the restaurant for a minimum of 15 minutes for our food. Usually my husband suffers this indecency when we order, because he loves their Pho and I am obsessed with their Tom Kha Noodle Soup (never seen anything quite like it anywhere else). Recently, however, I ordered take out with a friend and we went to pick it up together. I predicted to my friend that 1) our food would not be ready when we got there (which was 20 minutes after we were told it would be ready), and 2) that we would need to check the food because they would likely forget something. (More than once after picking up aforementioned pho, my husband got home to find to his dismay that his fixins (sprouts, basil, peppers etc) were missing). Also, the previous time I ordered, I had ventured to try something new, Xao Lac, a peanut dish with hot peppers, but instead got something with cashews that was totally bland and had nary a hot pepper to be seen.

Unfortunately, I ended up being right on both counts. We got our food shortly after arriving, they read our order to us, we confirmed that it was right, paid and took it to our car. I had my friend check the bag. Our simple order of my soup, her curry and our dumplings was missing dumplings. Back in we went. I told the hostess and she went to investigate. I heard someone in the kitchen chastise her that \"they were missing because the order wasn't ready yet.\" (Ding ding ding! Now I'm 2/2!) If you can't tell from that overheard exchange, it seems like there is a level of disorganization and poor communication that makes good service fairly unlikely. As a side note, although it was busy, there had to have been at least 10-12 people working besides chefs (3-4 people just in front manning the cash register), so it wasn't an issue of operating with a skeleton crew.

I have also eaten in at Ha Long Bay 2-3 times and the service hasn't been any better. I'm from the east coast and it's been suggested to me the standard here isn't the same. Well, I don't really buy that given how many places I've gone in Madison that have EXCELLENT service.  Also, while a mistake once in a while can happen anywhere, the fact that it is the rule rather than the exception at Ha Long Bay frustrates me. Because I really want to love this place.

Anyway, I can recommend the fresh spring rolls, curry puffs, crab rangoon, fried dumplings (best I've had in a while), soups mentioned earlier, in addition to Pad Phet and Xao Ca Ri. Really, everything is probably delicious. If you get it. And if it's what you ordered.

Do better, HLB. I implore you."}
{"text":"My family and I come to this place pretty often. Certainly the best place in Madison for pho. This place by far surpass Nams Noodles and Saigon. The broth is fresh with a hint of lemon, the overall ingredients are  fresh and not freezer burned. Unlike other places that I've mentioned above. Where the ingredients are just poor, the only down side about Ha Long is the wait..."}
{"text":"AP8 dumpling chicken.
AP11 spring rolls shrimp. 
MD1 crispy egg noodle chicken.
Then sticky rice with mango for dessert.  My wife & I had a fantastic dinner.  Alex our server was friendly & gave us excellent service.  We recommend Ha Long Bay any day!"}
{"text":"Since moving to the neighborhood this has been my absolute favorite place for Thai eats. I used to frequent Sa-Bai Thong quite a bit before discovering the squash curry here. As a vegan, I greatly appreciate the diversity of the menu; from vermicelli bun with lemongrass tofu, to vegetarian dumplings and tofu fresh spring rolls, I have always been satisfied with my meal here. 

Service is quick and efficient, they really have a rhythm down considering it is ALWAYS busy here. 

Intimate dining area with ample booth seating, beautiful décor (wooden ships, tapestries), and plenty of natural light streaming in through the front façade facing Willy street. 

Namaste Ha Long Bay

{"text":"It's difficult, when someone asks \"what is your favorite restaurant in Madison?\" I've found that often I come to the conclusion that Ha Long Bay is my favorite spot to eat. 

First, their lunch specials cannot be outdone. They have many of their top dinner choices available for about half the price at lunch. I recommend the panang curry- extra spicy. The portions are more than enough and the curry sauce is creamy, rich, and full of flavor. I've never been disappointed with any of the curries FYI. One drawback is that it does take quite a while to get your food at lunch time, you may need to allocate up to an hour if it's busy. Plan accordingly because it's worth the wait. 

The beer selection is acceptable (Chang, Singha, Capital Amber are the 3 I order). 

The staff is friendly and knowledgeable enough. 
 
If you arrive during dinner time, you may have to wait up to 1 hour for a table. Drop your name in and come back after getting a drink nearby and you'll be set. 

I would recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"I have been meaning to post a review for a while. Hands down, the best Thai/Laotian/Vietnamese food around! I try and come here whenever I find myself remotely close to this side of Madison and I am never disappointed! 
My personal favorite appetizer is the spring rolls with pork and shrimp. Make sure you put the hoisin sauce on them--sooooo delicious! My favorite entree is the squash curry with chicken. I fall in love all over again with acorn squash every time! I almost always choose the soup with mine. I can never remember what it is called but it is wonderful. It has mushrooms, tofu (the only time I ever eat tofu), and cilantro in it. Weird combo, I know but so, so, so good! 
My husband and kids love the dumplings and my four year old is obsessed with the cucumber salad. 
They are usually very busy but the food is so worth it!"}
{"text":"Terribly disappointing dinner tonight - both the food and service were simply awful.

  I was here last September, and had a wonderful dinner, though it took forever to dine; I chalked that up to it being a UW football weekend, albeit pre-season; the Bun that evening was a revelation.  Sadly, tonight, after a 40-minute wait for a table, it took another 20 minutes for my downright surly waitress to even approach the table - the hostess noticed, and  took my drink order (bad sign).   After my first choice proved to be something they don't serve anymore (despite it being prominently featured on the Vietnamese menu), I switched to a Thai squid salad (Yum Pla Muk).  Bad mistake.  The sauce had no hint of  either saltiness (from fish sauce) or sour (from lime juice), just mild heat and  cloying sweetness - imagine a squid sundae - with but five pieces of squid.  I would have sent it back, but the waitress never came back to check on anything until she dumped my Bun entree and fled - without taking the plates from the squid salad, which sat on the table until I self-bussed the table.  

The Bun, in the same variation as the fabulous one I had last summer (Bún Bò Nuong, Tôm (grilled shrimp and grilled pork), was a flat-out disaster.   The pork was a tasteless, dry afterthought, the noodles were overcooked and mushy, and again the dressing was terribly out of balance, with no hint of either fish sauce or lime, just minor heat and dessert-like sweetness.  Also, as with the squid salad, there was only lettuce and cilantro as the green component - no mint, a critical element.  Terrible.  I can make a far better Bun than this myself. 

Again, the waitress never came back to check on anything, or even to deliver my bill - I had to again enlist the hostess to do so.    Worst $35 dinner I've ever had, hands down.  With the far superior Lao Laan-Xang a block away,  I can't imagine anyone eating here.  I will never do so again.   Madison is chockful of fine restaurants - don't waste your time and money here."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate at Ha Long Bay Tuesday. I have eaten there twice before. The second time, the food was good, not great, but fine. The other two times, it was pretty poor. Tuesday my husband and I each ordered a red curry; his was vegetarian, mine had shrimp. Both had a nice amount of vegetables, which were good. However, both of our curries had very little flavor. I sometimes make red curry at home, and I can tell that they simply used about a third of the appropriate amount of red curry paste. And this was despite my requesting medium to hot on the heat/spicy scale. Our food had zero heat. I do not understand how this restaurant gets such a good reputation. They serve the worst Thai food in Madison. It has no flavor. On top of that, the heat was broken when we got there, so we ate in freezing temperatures until they did eventually get it fixed. The prices, at least, are good, and the service was fine, aside from ignoring my request for spicy food."}
{"text":"I love the food here. They have a diverse menu including Thai, Vietnamese, and Laotian items. Their curries are aromatic and have lots of veggies, and the Pad Thai is one of the best I've had. My husband likes the red curry with eggplant. The service is friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Best Thai food in town. I always order the TN3 pad See-Eew with chicken. I also love their veggie puffs. The place is always stacked but it's worth the wait."}
{"text":"Very mediocre Americanized  Asian food. Little flavor, little heat, little sense that this is Vietnamese or Laotian food. Very boring meal last night dining and and several takeout dinners prior. I can get food as boring as this at any Chinese takeout without the wait. I don't understand the crowds at this place. Madison's Asian restaurants seem to becoming increasingly homogenized. It's edible ... it's not that bad. It's just really really average."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in Madison!  Huge selection (the menu is like a book), great vegan options, giant soup bowls, good prices and friendly staff.

I highly recommend the veggie curry puffs appetizer! And anything with their house sesame sauce. I get the tofu or the eggplant, but really it is just the sauce that is so amazing. I have had other really good tofu and vegetable dishes here, but I keep coming back to the sesame sauce! 

(Also, they have alcoholic ginger ale and that makes me happy!)"}
{"text":"The food is delicious. Haven't dined in but the atmosphere seems pleasant. Help is quite friendly. Aside from some hanky parking, like just about everywhere on Willy Street, this place deserves each of these stars."}
{"text":"A co-worker of my husband's recommended this place--we had been living in Madison for a few months and were down to try whatever!  OMG!  Their dumplings are delicious!!!  We ordered both the pan-fried chicken dumplings and the ones with tofu.  Getting them pan-fried adds a great texture vs. getting them steamed.  I am not a vegetarian by any means, but I can appreciate a no-meat dish.  However, the chicken dumplings were bigger and tastier...I could eat a million of them!  In fact, my husband and I fought over the last one (not so with the tofu :)

On a second visit, I tried the green curry and fell in love all over again with thai food.  This place is super authentic and very affordable."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of pan dear egg noodles and have been trying to have more of it around the country. This was my second dish since I have started and it was delicious. The way they served it was pretty cool too, it was a boat like structure. Unfortunately this structure made it strange to eat because I could not soak it in the sauce without completely destroying everything. The atmosphere was wonderful and I would say upbeat???? That might be the wrong word. The service was pretty good but you have too look for them because they are really busy. I totally recommend this place for anyone looking for a Vietnamese food kick. It's a good price for the food too."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant! Everything I've gotten has been delicious. The prices are very reasonable. Service is fast."}

My second favorite dish- Lightly battered eggplant in our house sesame sauce; served on bed of stir-fried green vegetables. Just try it.

{"text":"Some of the best Bun I have had in the Midwest. The spices and herbs were very fresh, and the fish sauce was the perfect sweet and sour blend. I ordered B5, aka Vermicelli bowl with shrimp and egg roll. I liked how they took the tails off of the shrimp and chopped all of the ingredients into bite size pieces rather than making me bite them all off. 

For $10, I was genuinely pleased with both the quality and quantity of the entree. I did go in with moderate to low expectations though, so perhaps that is causing me to overrate the restaurant. Nonetheless, the prices are reasonable, the interior of the restaurant is cozy, and most importantly, the food is delicious and worthy of a return visit."}
{"text":"First time I tried their pork chop dish a few years ago was good, so I went there again for a couple more times to try their other dishes. Honestly, none of their other dishes were cooked as authentic as they should. Vegetables were cut as they wish, fried rice was too wet, curry was watered down. Ingredients they use for most dishes are not authentic, meaning, they just add any ingredients as they wish.

The worst is their waiters.  I am sure not all of them are bad, but most of the time they always give unhappy face.  My worst experience was last July 2014 when I took my family from out of town to have lunch there.  Foods were not good; appetizers are too greasy, curry only contains vegetables (almost no meat).  To top that, the waiter added gratuity to our bill automatically as if she is afraid we do not know how to calculate the tip???  It was only five of us on our table (automatic gratuity usually for party of 6 or 8). And we did not even ask her to do anything special.  We went in, ordered, ate, and asked for the bill. The restaurant was not busy at all.  Only two tables including ours."}
{"text":"The curries are outstanding, as is the Drunken Noodle.  As a vegetarian, I am really impressed with the distinct flavors of each of their tofu options.  On a recent visit, the place was packed half an hour 'til close and our waitress was sincerely sweet and very knowledgeable.  My only complaint is the estimated time for pick-up.  If they say 30-40 minutes, they actually mean 20-25 minutes.  Also, the 'mints' in the bowl on the counter are not very good.  Aside from that, food, staff, and atmosphere are great."}
{"text":"Everything I've had here has been good, but the absolute best thing is the Nem Khao Tod (LS7). It's actually a shame it's so good because I'd like to try more of the menu, but I can never resist ordering the Nem Khao Tod. Seriously, it's like an explosion of a million different delicious flavors in your mouth at once. So effing good."}
{"text":"Some of this food was killer, some just decent, would crush again, second date please.

Dumplings -- awesome. Like shockingly good for standard dumplings. The dipping sauce was salty sweet addicting, we saved the rest.

Pra Ram Long Song (TE1) -- peanut sauce goodness, very hearty.

Ga Xao Nam Dong Co (VE11) -- this meat was a bit too dry for me & a little flat, chicken, ginger & shitakes it needed like something else or maybe in soup form woulda been more complete.

Nem Khao Tod (LS7) - this was the most unique dish I'd had, the sausage was kind of chorizo like & the crunchy rice & vegetables textures just made it really appealing.

Pad see eew - portion size = large & it was regular run of the mill. Only tasted this BC a basic b*tch needed her Thai spaghetti, so better things to be had.

Service really good dealing with the traffic.

Sure you have to wait waaahhhh, but mommy I want an oompa loompa now!!! Deal with it or just eat at 10 other restaurants nearby.

Huge menu can't wait to explore more."}
{"text":"Great food and ambience - one of the best restaurants on Willy Street! I went there with a large group and they went out of their way to accommodate us. I would also recommend the place for a romantic date.  :-)"}
{"text":"Was a little scared to try food that was out of my norm, but this place is amazing and has food for every kind of palate. You have to park on the street, which is a little inconvenient, but the food is well worth it."}
{"text":"Excellent food, locally owned.  There can be a wait, but it is not long and worth it.  

Do not forget to order spring rolls!!"}
{"text":"My go-to restaurant for take-out. Also a good place to dine in. The drunken noodles are fantastic, and don't be afraid to get them spicy."}
{"text":"We've eaten here many times and have ordered takeout more times than I can count (we used to live next door). The food is always top notch, and we always have enough for leftovers. If you eat in the restaurant, expect the service to be slow. It's not because the staff is slow - they're always running around - it's just because they're busy 95% of the time and the food is fresh so it takes longer. Go when you have the time, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I read the reviews on this place and I had to try it. The place was packed for lunch and everything smelled great. We started with cucumber salad and veggie curry puffs, both were excellent. My husband loves Pho and was pleasantly surprised that there are several options to choose from. I had pad thai with shrimp extra spicy, I think this was the best pad thai I've had in Madison. The service was a little touchy because it was so busy. All in all I great experience."}
{"text":"The Yellow Curry and Pork Egg Rolls are AMAZING.  The menu is very large, so start with a favorite dish of yours in general.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Not only was the food amazing but it came out super fast! I've been craving a good pho for awhile now and decided to try it here. I got the pho with beef meatballs and it was everything I wanted! My sister tried the lunch specials %2 with the ginger chicken and pineapple. We ordered around 2:40 got our food at 2:50! Overall, I definitely would recommend this to friends and family and will be back again."}
{"text":"Just ate here a few days ago. There food is made to near perfection. 

    Unlike most Asian food, that is most of the time lacking in flavor, this is full of flavor 

    They offer Thai and other Asian food. Each bite as tasty as the next."}
{"text":"Always a little busy. But great food overall. 

Try the whole red snapper. The steamed wontons are also great as an appetizer."}
{"text":"Repeat after me: \"AP1, SL3, TN4\"   This is all you need to have a world class meal at my very favorite restaurant in the entire world, and I do mean the world, including Thailand and Cambodia where I've spent months enjoying the fabulous cuisine of SE Asia at the source...and  yet, its HLB I crave weekly.

AP1= Incredible fried spring rolls, the filling is flavorful with spiced pork, always dry fried (not greasy), and perfectly accented by a sweet, but not cloying, ginger sauce. It will ruin all other spring rolls for you, beware.

SL3 (Beef)= Thai beef salad, cold, crisp, refreshing with fresh cucumbers, tomato, herbs, shallots, and  thinly sliced steak swimming in a bracing lime/fish sauce vinaigrette.  My husband has been known to lick the plate. 

TN4 (Chicken)=Broad, fat, luscious rice noodles stir-fried with broccoli, chicken, tomatoes, onions, and holy basil  in a rich sweet-hot sauce.  Satisfying and filling, the best comfort food.

Eat, drink (their wine pours are generous), and be so, so, so happy :)"}
{"text":"The best Thai food around, for sure! Always clean, cool atmosphere, always good service, GREAT FOOD. Try the pra ram long song- I get it every time now. The papaya salad is also amazing! Expect a wait if you plan on going during a weekend evening."}
{"text":"Fresh. Delicious. Large Variety of choices. It does get busy at peak hours like most good places. Amazing pho."}
{"text":"Really really flavorful thai food. Tom yum soup was excellent. Spring rolls and dumplings were clearly made in house as were their accompanying sauces. Both curries we tried were fantastic as well"}
{"text":"***** ANYONE PLANNING TO STAY FOR A MEAL SHOULD CHECK THEIR BILL *****

PROS: Good food, easy to find parking nearby (street parking), a lot of asian food selections

CONS: Not family-friendly, long wait-time for a table, dirty tables/glassware, superfluous costs in bill, non-transparent / frequently-changing menu costs

My friends and I often come here for Vietnamese / Thai food. Overall, the food is worthwhile; the billing headache at the end is not. I went with my girlfriend for lunch and we decided to share an appetizer and entree. We were happy with the food until we received the bill. They charged us $1 extra for \"sharing\" an entree, written in small font on the bottom of the last page of their menu. In fact, I am sure they charge extra every time you go with more than 1 person since the bills NEVER coincides with the menu prices. I guarantee the bill will be ~$1 extra for every dish because of \"sharing\" (it doesn't matter if you did not share the dish, there will be extra charges). Needless to say, we left without tipping (we would've given more than a $1 tip). So keep your extra $1 dollar Ha Long Bay, that's the last one you are getting from me and my friends. Customers should not leave the restaurants feeling cheated with arbitrary costs!"}
{"text":"How do they do SO MANY THINGS WELL?! Usually I hate places with menus as big as Ha Long, but I have never had anything bad there. They somehow perfect most things. 

It is usually busy so you have to plan ahead. The service is usually good, however, and the food is always on point."}
{"text":"Love the food. The menu is excellent.  Hate the wait, though. I don't want to downgrade my review on one aspect alone, but it's now been two times that we have waited at least 15 minutes -- no exaggeration -- for first contact with our server. The table next to us tonight, same thing. I know you may be busy, but even a \"hey, I see you\" would be nice. There are many excellent restaurants in Madison. Service is what makes it or breaks it for me. Hoping next time won't be my last."}
{"text":"Admittedly, I find any Asian restaurant that relies on using MSG in all of their dishes to be pretty much worthless.  It's not necessary and it only serves to try to mask/enhance sub-par food.

Lame.  I'd prefer to eat at a restaurant that is not only delicious but also prepared consciously.   Lao-Laan on Willy street is better and less toxic than this place.

A lot of people on here seem to love this place.  I'm not sure why, unless they've never experienced anything better (in a larger city, outside of the midwest, perhaps.)"}
{"text":"Mango curry is the best thing in the world. Enough said. 

But, I came in for my birthday and I was in a party of 8 people. The biggest issue that really did bother us was the fact that the dishes didn't all come out together. My dish came out first and my friends ginger chicken came about 15min later. But i'm rating this restaurant on food then everything was amazing."}
{"text":"First time visit. Small interesting space, Buddhist decor, statues. So cool to be in. Server was friendly. Menu is large. I settled on TC 2, a vegan coconut milk based curry with peanut sauce, veggies, potato, rice. It was huge bowls of food. Didn't run out of potato it was plentiful. It was incredible. I had to slow down! 
Eager to go back and try more dishes. For vegans they all have a tofu option. The little apple candy at the end was a nice touch. The curry has a aftertaste."}
{"text":"I have to say I'm very impressed with their curries. Probably one of the best Thai foods I've had in Madison. I liked the way the menu was put together with some interesting dishes- especially the appetizers. My friends and I were looking for \"something new\" that can be a new stimulus and this was IT. Had to wait a little bit, but it was definitely worth it."}
{"text":"Great chicken wantons and Thom yum soup! The size of the entrees is good too. I will definitely come here again."}
{"text":"We were really excited to try this place based on the reviews.   Sadly the most basic elements of service and good tasting food were lacking.   The spring rolls and hot and sour soup were very good and nice sized portions. Unfortunately our waiter forgot to bring the soup and then disappeared. We had to ask a busser and another server before he finally brought it. Or entrees were both chicken, but here's where it got really sad.   The chicken tasted old.   There's nothing worse than that, and as such an inexpensive protein  there's no reason to try to use day old chicken. We won't go back."}
{"text":"This place is the bomb. 

Excellent food, reasonable prices, generous portions. Curries, pho, stir-fry, the Vietnamese crepe...we've sampled all over the menu and have never been disappointed -- all great stuff. 

Friendly and attentive staff."}
{"text":"Solid 4 stars. Nothing amazing; that you haven't had before, but just fine to satisfy a Thai craving. Squash curry is really good. Pho is sub-par. Staff is friendly; like the beta fish up front."}
{"text":"I moved to Madison from the DC area, where I've had great Vietnamese and Thai meals.  Since coming to Madison, I've had some good pho (Saigon Noodle), but in general had bad experiences at restaurants like Sa-Bai Thong and Banh Thai.

Ha Long Bay changed all that.  The wait for tables can be long due to popularity, but it is a fairly big place by Willy St. standards.  I am vegetarian (converted since the pho, obviously...), and have enjoyed several great meals at at Ha Long Bay.  And service has been consistently good too; food can take a short while, but is well worth the wait.

Like others, I was concerned about the breadth of the menu, but so far, so good!"}
{"text":"We are not very experimental with Asian food... 

BUT - the curried squash was the very best I have had - ever!
My partner said her pad thai was an \"excellent specimen.\"

We have had only take-out from this restaurant, but it was ready in fewer than 25 minutes, which is a plus in my book.

The restaurant seemed crowded and noisy for a Sunday night, but the flip side of that is that most everyone seemed to be enjoying the food and the atmosphere. 

Parking was really difficult: it took me ~ 10 minutes to find a spot close enough to make sure the food did not get too cold when carrying it outside.

All-in-all, well worth the $20+ for the generous portions of delicious food.

Update as of 9/2014: after going here several additional times, I can say I appreciate the food even more!"}
{"text":"Five stars for the food, but I took a star off for the ambience. Their menu is a tome and has a lot of vegetarian friendly items. I am yet to try their pho, but their noodles and curries are top notch. I personally prefer their Vietnamese food to their Thai (there are other places in Madison that make better Thai curries). Their egg roll wrapped in a spring roll appetizer is one of my favorites. 

Now for the bad stuff. Expect a one hour wait during peak hour. And even after you are seated, the acoustics are bad which makes the noise echo. Service is a little slow considering how crowded they are. If I lived closer I would do take out. But I love their food and so I endure the wait and the noise."}
{"text":"I especially recommend the Hot and Sour soup. In fact,  I have never had anything bad there- to the contrary.  Subtle flavors and fine textures.  As a vegetarian, I have eaten at many Asian restaurants.  It is probably one of the best ones in Madison. I give it 5 stars because it is also inexpensive and the service is great."}
{"text":"I would have love to try the food but didn't get the opportunity to. We were told it was a 30 minute wait. After we waited over an hour we got a table. After sitting at  the table for nearly 30 more minutes we decided to get up and leave because no one had taken our order. People who arrived at the restaurant long after we did we're seated before us and were already eating. I think they were discriminating against us because of our race."}
{"text":"Best vietnamese around, appetizer spring rolls are fantastic, some of the best dumplings which are clearly home made.

For entrees try out any of the vietnamese specialties or thai noodle dishes"}
{"text":"I like Ha Long Bay. The decor is nice and comfortable. There are prominent window seats which give a good view of Willie Street, but that also put you on display for everyone walking/driving by.

The menus, as has been mentioned, is very large-- I like the Bo Kho, which is a stew of beef shank and vegetables in a rich, flavorful broth. The green curries are tasty as well. The only think I've had there that didn't suite my palette was \"Dynamite\" shrimp. The shrimp were pretty good, but they were overwhelmed by a sauce that was essentially mayonnaise with lots of Tabasco sauce in it, and maybe a little sugar for good measure. Eating one of those shrimps was sort of tasty in a junk-food way, but it got less than appetizing pretty quick.

All in all, though, the food has been tasty and fresh, and the meals are well paced (I like a little slower-paced meal when I dine out). There are more flavorful Thai options nearby (Bahn Thai is a bit better, food-wise) but Ha Long Bay can certainly be a place for a wonderful dinner!"}
{"text":"Wow. In town from LA and went with my brother, this is as good as my favorite Thai place in East Hollywood. Great value as well. Had great pad see ew, chicken satay and the cucumber salad-all great. My new go to restaurant when I am back in Madison"}
{"text":"I will definitely go back to this restaurant again but want to get some information out there. If you are planning on a Saturday night, expect a 40 minute wait which we were happy to do. The food was fabulous - we had crab wonton, egg roll, pad thai and sesame chicken and a pot of ginger tea so it wasn't anything too adventurous but it was DELICIOUS, no doubt! The one downfall was that there was so much smoke in the restaurant from the fried food that our eyes actually burned. Better ventilation is a must."}
{"text":"Great food selections.  But expect long waits for seating, and often quite unfriendly service."}
{"text":"Outstanding place to eat. Service gets slow when busy but always worth the wait."}
{"text":"Too long of a wait time. If you are a party of five or more, I would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"Always great quality food. Service goes above and beyond! I received a wrong order and not only did they correct the order, they also threw in an extra goody to make up for the mistake!! Will continue to go back, best pad thai in town.  Also try the chicken dumpling appetizer, and the wings are to die for"}
{"text":"The food here is good and was one of my top go to spots. The only thing is their service, it isn't the best. I shouldn't have to wait an hour just to get a water refill or for my order to be taken. This constantly happens and everytime it makes me want to return less and less. The food may be good but sooner than later it won't be enough to return to because the service is so slow."}
{"text":"Awesome food, TERRIBLE service. I recommend calling ahead with a take out order and eating their delicious food in the comfort of your own home. 2 stars for service and 4 stars for food. Just spent 2 hours there, watching people who had arrived after we did get their food and even leave before we got our main dishes. Food was great, won't be eating in the restaurant again."}
{"text":"update: another visit when  it was less busy - amazingly attentive and fast service.  such great food!"}
{"text":"I was there this evening and ordered what many recommended on both Yelp and Food Network, the LS7, Nem Khao Tod and the Thai Spring Roll.  Neither were very good.  The spring roll was huge compared to other spring rolls on the table and was swimming in an over sweet plum sauce.  If you order it, ask for the plum sauce on the side.  The Nem Khao Tod is really a plate of crispy rice, the temperature of which is luke warm so I assume it's made ahead of time and left sitting in a rice cooker or other warming cooker or lights.  There were a few and I mean only a few of what looked like hot dog slices as the sausage, but these were hot in temperature.  You can't find any diced chicken.  There were a few sliced shallots.  Really I found the rice and sausage to be very dry and not warm enough, although the \"medium\" spice level I requested was on target.  While they say they have AC running it was very hot in the restaurant and way too noisy to have a decent conversation with anyone else at my table as you couldn't hear them.  Maybe if I lived in the neighborhood I'd try something else via carry out, but this is not worth driving from Fitchburg to eat at again.  Too bad.  I was really looking forward to the experience having lived in Asia for 5.5 years."}
{"text":"plain and simple this place is bombbbbbbbb and its 2 blocks from my work so thats cool lol eattttttttttttttt.   hhhhhhhhheeeeerrrrreeeeeeeeeeee"}
{"text":"Wonderful flavors. Service is a bit slow, but I'll be back for the food and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Ha long bay is a pretty decent restaurant. I only tried the triple delight curry, and my girlfriend had the vermecilli noodle. The curry was extra watery, but the noodles were good. The Thai iced teas were also very delicious but was filled with a lot of ice, so if you're ordering a drink ask for less ice. They also charge extra for bowl of rice which I thought was weird, but I'm from chicago so idk.

The service was good, it was pretty busy so we had to wait 20 minutes for a table. There were flies by our table and there was no a/c which kinda sucks.

There is free street parking, and you might want to get a reservation if you don't want to wait.

It's a pretty nice place with some decent food if you don't mind the wait and the slightly overpriced items."}
{"text":"Terrible service, rude child at the front desk. Expect to have to elbow your way past other guests, as advised by the sarcastic server. Food is fine, nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"As my epic quest for fantastic Asian food through the Midwest continues, I made a recent trek over to Willy Street one afternoon to experience Ha Long Bay Vietnamese & Thai Bistro with the fam! 

First, I must tell you a little background on how we got to Ha Long Bay. When we first moved to the Midwest, we would ask everyone where in town to find decent Asian food. Then, when we began to hear a trend for one, specific location, we paid attention. Ha Long Bay was that place. So, we stopped in on a Friday afternoon, and ordered four lunch specials: Two Pad Se Yew's with chicken (one medium; one mild) and two Pad Thais (one mild tofu and one mild chicken). I also got a bowl of freshly-made Hot and Sour soup. 

(One last thing...I should mention that I typically judge all Thai restaurants by the quality of the their Pad Se Yew. Some people go curry and some go Pad Thai. But for me, I'm looking for that downtown bay area, hole-in-the-wall, knock-your-socks-off phenomenal Pad Se Yew.)

* FOOD TASTE/QUALITY: Let's start with the appetizers, tom yum soup or cucumber salad. Both were fantastic tasting. I particularly liked the small, fresh button mushroom halves in the soup. The cucumbers were cut a bit too large for me, so they didn't have much time to marinate. But, again, very nice tasting. 

I reordered the Hot and Sour soup, as I had enjoyed it very much on a previous visit. It was phenomenal that day, but this day was a bit too thick for me (too much corn starch, I believe). While the taste was very good, I couldn't get past the consistency. 

The Pad Se Yew was very good. An excellent dish. Noodles were a tad-bit overcooked for me, but the flavors were very fresh and on-target. It wasn't overly fishy-tasting and had just the right balance of sweetness. The medium heat one was a bit weak for my taste (to me, if a customer asks for medium spice, they're looking for a hotter-than-mild; this wasn't the case), but I would certainly come back for it again.

Pad Thai was also very good, particularly the tofu one. Tofu was just the right size and fried very nicely. The chicken on the other was a little too thick for me, but again, it was an excellent dish.

* PRESENTATION: The dishes were presented nicely. Small soup came in a small white bowl with a spoon, and the large Hot and Sour came in a more decorative clay pot. Everything else came as expected.   

* PORTION: This is one of those \"you won't leave hungry\" kind of situations. While the starters are smaller (as they should be), the lunch portion of main dish was fairly large and made to order. Let me put it like this: I'm writing this review two days later, and I still have one more little white take-out box in my fridge. Yeah...big portions.

* PRICES: Very reasonable. $6.95 with choice of beef, pork, chicken, or tofu; $7.95 for shrimp. $3.50 for the soup. 

* DINING EXPERIENCE: Fairly authentic. We went on a Friday afternoon, so it was pretty packed with about 50 customers. But, it's a classic, mom-and-pop Willy street place. It was busy and a little chaotic with the crowd, so it took our server a bit to find us. But, when she came, she was very nice and helpful. Food came out fresh and was all hot. Nice environment to dine in.

* FINAL NOTES/IMPRESSIONS (4.5 to 5 stars): I really liked Ha Long Bay. The food taste is excellent and the staff were very nice. While, for me, I would have liked the Pad Se Yew fried a bit more and a bit spicier, what it really comes down to are the flavors. This is an area that Ha Long Bay does very, very well. Mix this between the large portion sizes and reasonable prices, and I can see why they stay packed on Friday afternoons and why it's one of my go-to Thai food places in Madison. Well, that and the addictively-good Lychee candies you get on the way out."}
{"text":"This place has AMAZING food!! Every single dish I have tried has been awesome.  Their prices are reasonable too.  I'd say an average for a good dish is between $8-$14.   I had the Ginger Chicken dish with pineapples, medium spicy and it was SUPER SUPER good! 

The only problem I have with this place is that it is ALWAYS packed busy.  Every time I've gone there, we have had to wait 20-30 minutes to sit down.  The area to wait in is right at the front door which gets really crowded and congested with people waiting for tables. 

Other then the crowded front door area, I highly recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"The exotic flavors take you away from the frigid Wisconsin winter into Asia. A lot of options in the menu that you'd want to return to taste them all."}
{"text":"Since traveling to Vietnam, I find myself craving the cuisine far more frequently.  I have NEVER been disappointed here.  We are lucky to have this place in Madison."}
{"text":"Excellent service and authentic food.  We love everything we ordered and they come in large portions too!"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised walking into Ha Long Bay. I liked everything from the ambiance to the yummy smells drifting from the kitchen. I just moved back to Madison after living near San Francisco, CA. I didn't think the Thai/Vietnamese places there could be beat...
I was wrong!
Ha Long Bay was outstanding. I went for a birthday dinner with my family & everything was perfect. Our meals were both delicious & brought out in a timely manner. That's always a good sign with a bigger party (6 adults, 1 baby). Our server was awesome! Always had our drinks full & very friendly. I believe her name was Sandy. I'll be requesting her every time I go (I'll for sure be back soon)! When she noticed it was my Bday, she even brought me out a complementary blueberry wonton dessert. It was soooo good! :) Now that is good customer service! 
This is one of my new Madison favorites! 5 stars :)"}
{"text":"Amazing chicken dumplings got us very excited for our meal. Then had bland mango chicken. Something that resembled tso chicken and chicken pad Thai 
Bland bland bland"}
{"text":"Went for lunch. We both ordered Pho. Portions, price, amount of ingredients were all good but the mainstay of Pho is the broth. There was no beef, clove, star anise flavor to be found. I added all the jalapeños, lime, then garlic siracha and finally hoisin looking for flavor. I told myself forgo the thought of the bowl in front of me as Pho, and just eat the noodles and beef. 

I  overlooked the dirty looking exterior when entering but started to look around a bit more closely when the Pho disappointed. The wall paint was peeling on both sides of the booth, as well as in many other areas of the restaurant, and the window area as we exited was disgustingly dirty. That makes me question the condition of the kitchen.

We will never return based on food and certainly the atmosphere."}
{"text":"I give this restaurant 5 stars easily!  Everything I've ever tried is amazing and incredibly reasonable.  Every time my fiance and I go we order three dishes and split them all and take home the leftovers because it is so reasonably priced and delicious.  My favorite is the pork vermicelli salad.  We were so in love with it we've replicated it at home (or at least tried).  Theirs is still the best!"}
{"text":"Awesome awesome food! The best in Madison! Dumplings Rock, the fried wide noodle dishes Rock, everything is a good pick!  The decor is horrid, but just look at your food!"}
{"text":"This is our go to lunch spot when in the Atwood and Willy Street areas. The pho is wonderful, as is the chicken won ton soup. AP10 appetizer is a must. I have never been disappointed with  the food; service can be slow(er) at times, but always worth it. The person I go there with the most swears the pad Thai is the best in the city."}
{"text":"I tried the beef pad thai and a vegetarian spring roll appetizer for take-out.  Both were okay, but I am still on the search for good (ie that i would order again) pad thai in Madison.  This place is just not it - sauce was too sweet-and-sour sauce with not enough peanut, lime, or savory flavors.  spring roll was bland and too much lettuce.  
the ambiance of the place looked fun, but all in all I'm still searching for my go-to Thai restaurant."}
{"text":"Foods great.  Best Vietnamese food in town.  That's the problem.  Called on a Friday evening and could not connect with the restaurant from 5:45-7:45.  Busy signal.  Finally gave up and ordered Laotian food.  Although Ha Long Bay has great food, if you Can't order the food then who cares. Bad way to do business."}
{"text":"Wow, this menu is large and fantastic. We arrived at 5:30 on a Saturday and there was already a 30 minute wait. Sadly, during that 30 minutes, there was no bar to wait at or much room to stand or sit. In the winter, this can be a problem. 

Our server was an adorable old asian woman who was as kind as your own grandma. Five stars for her.

On to the food: We ordered tea, the thai spring rolls, and hot and sour soup for appetizers. All three portion sizes were double what we expected for the price and all were fantastic. Our entrées were also great. We ordered the VE5 and HS2. I probably wouldn't order VE5 again because I'm sure there is something better on the menu, but it wasn't bad.  The menu is too inviting to explore! The entrée portions were average to slightly above average.

My wife and I had a great date night; we would definitely go back. The only reason why 4 stars instead of 5 was the lack of space for waiting and the fact that the restaurant was full of smoke that was slightly irritating for our lungs and made our clothes small like delicious food."}
{"text":"LARGE portions of very yummy food!  We (party of 3) ordered a soup, the mango curry dish (to DIE for), and several appetizers.  The crab ragoon appetizer was fantastic, chicken satay appetizer is HUGE and could work as an entree, third wasn't great or memorable.  The soup was hot, spiced/seasoned just right, and HUGE. This is definitely a place to split an entree or plan for left overs. Service wasn't as slow as some mentioned here but we had an early Friday night dinner.  Parking is kind of a bummer though."}
{"text":"I love this place, great food and great service. The pad Thai and squash curry are my favorite."}
{"text":"We had a 25 minute wait tonight, not horrible. My friend got a pork stir fry. The pork was extremely dry.  Sauce had a decent taste. I ordered the shrimp mango curry and crab rangoon.My dish was really guide, despite the shrimp being overdone.  My crab Rangoon were ok.  Expect a 20 minute wait on weekends.  Place is small, with nowhere to stand and wait without being in someones way. Menu is extensive to say the least!  Chinese, Thai, vietnamese and food from Laos are the choices.  My bill came to $17.92 for my curry, appetizer, with water to drink. Service was good."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place, and I wish I could go there more often!! The food is delicious, the ambiance is calm and soothing, and the staff is very friendly and polite! Call me boring, but I can't get anything other than the Mango Curry (I'm a wimp, so I get it mild); it will rock your socks off!!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in Madison! Friendly and fast service and AMAZING food!! I always order the shrimp pad thai, and I get the pho (fa?) soup to go. Those two entrees provide me with 3-5 meals because the portions are so big and leftovers taste just as good as dining in. 
What's also nice is that the pad thai gives you spicy options, so for someone who hates spicy food, it's nice to have a mild option."}
{"text":"Food is great..but I was promised a gluten free sauce and that was not delivered. I was horribly sick. For the average person this is s great place...but not with allergies."}
{"text":"All I can say is that I am happy I live less than a block away from Ha Long Bay. I smell Ha Long Bay constantly and having tried many different things on the menu I say try the Pho and try PE1, the one with the peanuts. SO SO SO good. I could eat there everyday."}
{"text":"I am so glad I gave this place another try. I went here when it first opened thinking that finally I did not have to trek all the way to the West side for decent pho and vietnamese food, but I was disappointed. Now years later, they have definitely improved on their services and of course food. 

Pho here is pretty good. It's not amazing, but it's pretty darn close, so save your gas and East siders there is a reliable place to get your vietnamese fix. Their prices haven't changed much in the past couple of years and they offer a variety of dishes. Go before 7 pm, otherwise there is bound to be a line!  

If you're going to get Vietnamese food, you always get the pho. If you're not a soup person their Bun combination is excellent. Any of their rice dishes also won't disappoint and of course can't forget the Bahn Xeo, Vietnamese crepes with shrimp.

Their thai dishes are good, again not great. There are better places (nearby) with excellent curry but for a Vietnamese-Thai restaurant this place shall be darn good enough."}
{"text":"In the context of Madison, 4/5 stars!

I've visited Ha Long Bay well over a dozen times and they've earned my love through consistency and kind service. The staff is especially excited to see regulars which makes the experience extra fun.

Success at Ha Long Bay is, as in most restaurants, all about ordering correctly. Portion sizes are BIG and leftovers are a safe bet, especially if you order an appetizer. Relatedly, their appetizers are fantastic and well-priced. Their spice levels are conservative and consistent; be sure to order Very Hot if you like heat. Even more complimentary is the photo behind the register of Andrew Zimmern posing with the owners. :)

Ha Long Bay offers a sizable menu of Vietnamese, Thai, and Laotian food, but don't let that perturb you. The menu is craftily designed to offer many choices.

Recommended:
App - Veggie Curry Puffs
Anything from the Laotian menu (Mok Pa and Shrimp Laab especially)
Pho broth is flavorful (but garnishes vary in quality)
Pad Thai
MÌ XÀO DÒN - Crispy Eggs Noodles is a showstopper. 
Thai Tea and Coffee (can be served w/o cream if you avoid dairy!)

The only thing I'd avoid are the standalone curries. They're a bit weak and work better as sauces in the stir fries.

Be warned, the kitchen is slow during the lunch/dinner rush. They're never at a deadly crawl, but if you're in a hurry or hangry, order take-out or visit later.

+Food is consistently good and beats the local competition overall.
+Portions are generous and well-priced. You'll have leftovers.
+Staff are crazy nice.
+Atmosphere is great, but know that they're almost always busy!
-Slow kitchen, so visit on the early or late side of meal times, or order take-out."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh, the curries here are AMAZING.
I have tried the mango, squash, and yellow curry.
And I definitely recommend the mango and the squash curry.

I have only been here for lunch, so I cannot speak for those who had bad experiences during their dinner time.
I do have to agree that their service is slow, but most of the staff is quite nice."}
{"text":"Better than others around.  Extensive menu, fast service, and thank God, clean.  Try the Pho, good stuff."}
{"text":"The squash curry is the best in town. Love the crab rangoons, too."}
{"text":"AP10. every time. Egg roll wrapped inside a spring roll, yes please. 

Besides AP10, Ha Long Bay has the best Pho in the city, delicious green curry, and my favorite Thai iced tea!

Service is a bit slow from time to time, but totally worth the wait!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Southeast Asian restaurant in Madison. HS8, the Pad Ped, is amazing with squash, veggies, and your choice of protein. The sauce is creamy and if you get it spicy it is balanced nicely with coconut sauce. LS7 is another family favorite (and favorite of James Beard award-winning chef Tori Miller).  I've never been when it's not packed, so I always get carryout."}
{"text":"There is not a bad item on this menu!!! (which is huge). Some people get intimidated by a large menu, but I personally love all the options. I usually get the Xao Thom with the sweet and sour soup, but most recently I had the Tom Yum soup with a cucumber salad and spring rolls with egg rolls inside! Everything was delicious as per usual. This may be my new favorite restaurant in Madison!"}
{"text":"This place has a nice decor and is in a good location and I suspect that is the only reason why it's been busy so far since it just opened.  The food is very white-wash.  Yea, I said it, white wash!  The pho broth absolutely has NO flavor.  We ordered the papaya salad and asked our waiter to ask the chef to make it \"Lao\" style (we know that the restaurant cooks are mostly Laotian people and wanted it more authentic with all the real ingredients, like stinky fish/shrimp paste, fermented crab etc.) the waiter looked at us confused.  We told him we just wanted it authentic.  He assured us it is authentic and delicious.  I was NOT comforted by that and told my sister not to order it, but she did anyways.  It came out and was nothing BUT, shredded papaya with lime juice, tomatoes, and peanuts.  Now if you like \"white washed\" papaya, then it's fine, however just don't expect the real thing.  I wouldn't mind if the waiter knew that it was NOT authentic, and just told us the kitchen didn't have/keep all the ingredients to a Lao style papaya salad.  I've been to places that simply told me that, and I still got the papaya salad anyways just to try.  But it wasn't just the flavor that gets you...the portion is also very small.  It is not worth the $6 or $7 dollars they charge at all!

Oh and be ware of one of the server.  She's a nice and kind Asian lady,  when she serves she carries food tray out on her shoulders.  She's petite so it must make it easier for her, however, her hair is shoulder length (and curly) and I've noticed her hair brushes the food on the tray especially the rice...I've noticed this on more than one occasion.  Yes I've been there twice despite my 2 stars... I was extremely sick the first time I went there, and decided to give them a second chance.

Oh yes I also should mention, the kitchen takes FOREVER to cook.  Both times we were there, the whole meal took over 2 hours!!!!  The restaurant was NOT busy and there was only 4 of us."}
{"text":"The food is very delicious! The crispy noodle and mango curry are the best! They're always busy though, I recommend you make a reservation."}
{"text":"Very nice place located on a beaten path where it doesn't feel like you're in the city.
Service was very nice, although I waited quite long for my Phö which is not that difficult to prepare.  Spring rolls for my appetizer were really tasty and all was fresh.
Only 3 stars because the broth in my soup was sweet. I've never had Phö that was that way and I really did not like that. I ate all but the broth. I asked if they add sugar to the soup and I was told \"yes\". I value the honesty very much although there is absolutely no reason for added sugar.
I will be back, and will try other dishes which they have a lot of that look great. I will update my rating after next experience.

Btw, I was told that they do not take Amex normally but she ran it for me. Big plus, thank you!"}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite restaurants.  I'm not the most worldly when it comes to cuisine, but this is pretty awesome in my book.  The egg rolls are put simply the best egg rolls I've ever had.  Anything I've tried on the regular part of the menu has been really good to excellent.  I doubt you can go wrong with this place."}
{"text":"It is lovely to be able to walk to this place along Willy Street, I went there with friends who were visiting from Norway the other day. The food is always excellent and I enjoy the atmosphere. There is often a line, depending on when arrive. My friends (who ate here and at Red) went home talking about how the food in Madison is wonderful."}
{"text":"Don't be derailed by all of the California D-Bags posting reviews of this place.  I've been there several times and it's fantastic.  The food is as succulent and fresh as it gets around here.  If the \"Pho\" is not the real deal, well, I'm sure that's disappointing to the connoisseur.  But this place is very, very good.  The beef stew is especially delicious.  Give it a shot, you won't be disappointed except, maybe, if you're from the OC."}
{"text":"Everything I have tried at Ha Long Bay has been delicious!

I have been twice, once for a birthday and once just with friend. Both times I ordered a curry; yellow and green. Both curries had great flavor, with big chunks of veggies mixed in. They were both delicious, but I think the yellow was my favorite.

I also tried the dumpling appetizer, and they were really good! The sauce that comes with is basically just a soy sauce, and super salty, but the dumplings were so good that they were fine without the sauce.

I sampled my friends drunken noodles with chicken, which were incredible. I also sampled another friends soup of some sort and orange chicken. Both were very tasty! No complaints. 

Service is always friendly and prompt. 

I really like that you can pick the level of spiciness for your dish! They only serve beer and wine though :(

Make sure to try the chili paste on the table! Really spicy, but super delicious!"}
{"text":"Every time I've gone I've throughly enjoyed every bite!!! Perfect for lunch or dinner!! Do not hesitate to order something other than your usual dish - so far everything I've tried has been delicious!!!"}
{"text":"I'm sorry, I really want to support this place, but service is constantly disappointing!

Been here so many times that finally had to give up. It is popular, always packed, and it is a good sign. However we have had to always waited so long with no waiters/ waitresses coming over(seems deliberately avoiding us because of mal-functioning kitchen issue?!)  and the wait time is more than 25 to 40 mins. 

Last 2 times we had to walk out of the place after standing in front of the entrance like 2 hungry idiots, with staff people walking by, totally ignoring us, without smiles.  Cashier people gave us a glance, without smile either. What an ambiance! 

Another complaint is, soup of pho is way too sweet. I have never had broth with noodles that's so sweet. Tom yam soup is too sweet too.  Chicken satay is tasty, but feels like it's old chicken, been long prepared for days."}
{"text":"FOUND DIME COIN IN MY TOM KHA SOUP!!! ASSUMED I DID IT AND MADE A FUSS OVER IT AND I AM NEVER GOING BACK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I have been coming to Ha Long Bay for a long while now and I ordered the Tom Kha soup because I usually get the Pho.  I was accompanied by my 5 month pregnant sister and she ordered the pad thai.  About a third of the way down I saw a dime coin in my soup.  We told the waiter and they came back and said \"We don't have any money in the back kitchen area, but we won't charge you for the soup.\" An apology would have been nice for a dime being in the soup.  I asked for the owner and the owner came out and said \"I cooked the soup and we don't have any money back there.\" I felt EXTREMELY offended that both the owner and the waiter were insisting that they weren't going to take responsibility for the dime coin being in the soup. So I told the owner that I wished she would take some form of responsibility because I too did not know how the dime made it into the soup.  She didn't want to cooperate so I said well \"I'm not going to pay for the pad thai either because you are not being apologetic and you are offending me and my sister because it sounds like you are accusing us.\" Next, the owner yelled and said \"Fine, don't pay for anything, leave, and don't come back!\" We then gathered our things and left. On our way out I wanted a business card and they didn't have any.  In the end I gave them $12 for the pad thai but this was all while they were yelling at my offended sister and the owner threw the money back at my sister. I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED BECAUSE THE OWNER MADE US LOOK AND FEEL AS IF WE PURPOSELY PUT THE COIN IN THE SOUP. If the owner would have apologized and taken responsibility then that would have been that but instead they accused my sister and I of trying to get a $7.75 soup for free. Maybe it's because I don't look rich? I don't know what it was but if you don't want to risk having a random coin in your food, don't come here. Also, if you want great service, DON'T EAT HERE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! So sad that I will never return. I can't wait to be back in California where people are less discriminatory of people with my skin color."}
{"text":"Great place. A little crowded as it always seems to be busy and parking in that area can be tough but this is a place to try for sure. Menu is huge with so many dishes I have yet to try but I have liked everything so far. Service is friendly."}
{"text":"Be still my heart. I live a rock's throw away, so I'm here for both food and takeout on a very regular basis. I have tried a large portion of the menu, and I rarely find something I don't like. Get the AP10. It's a spring roll with a small egg roll inside. It defies logic. The dumplings are fantastic as well. There can be a wait, but then ignore your grumbling tums for an off time (3pm is great!)."}
{"text":"Ha Long Bay has quickly become my favorite restaurant in Madison.  I always order from the Vietnamese menu and love the shrimp bun and sometimes daydream about their egg rolls.  The fresh lemonade is divine and I really like the atmosphere.  

This restaurant makes me want to do a culinary tour of Vietnam!"}
{"text":"The mango curry with chicken is VERY TASTY, however not the most complex curry flavor I have ever experienced.  However it also had very little mango flavor, and the predominant flavor was certainly from the acorn squash, and a little from the pineapple.  Ordered it as \"medium\" spicy, and in my opinion it was not spicy at all, not even a little heat.  Will order it as \"hot\" next time.  Got takeout on a friday night and I am very glad we did because the restaurant was so packed I had trouble even spotting the counter through the mass of people standing  by the door waiting for  a table. Very affordable too, my curry was only $10 and was huge :)"}
{"text":"I am convinced that anyone who gives Ha Long Bay more than three stars hasn't eaten really exceptional Vietnamese & Thai (which are both easier to find exceptionally done in bigger, more diverse cities). I like Ha Long Bay and eat there frequently, largely due to proximity and lack of other options, but it is not four-star (or five!) worthy. 

Upsides: 

-When dishes are good here, they are very good. The best dish I've had so far is the \"LS7 Nem Khao Tod: Crispy rice with minced sour sausage, chicken, onion, cilantro, mint, lime juice, topped with peanuts, served with lettuce for wrapping,\" which I eat rarely because I have to take an ethical meat time-out.

-The only other place to get decent Pho is on the west side, by the mall. When I am chilled to the bone and want Pho, this is the place to go for it. I am sort of a chicken addict, but I still think that the chicken is the best Pho at Ha Long Bay, even though it isn't traditional. 

-The staff is generally friendly, and they have to be, because it's a zoo in this restaurant most of the time.

Downsides:

-When dishes are bad, they are very, very, bad. Bland & tasteless, as many of the reviewers have pointed out. The drunken noodles are not good, for example, and neither is the Pad Thai, and these are two dishes that should be easy to make flavorful.

-Sometimes, Ha Long Bay gets overwhelmed by the volume and food takes a long time. I've seen several people melt down when waiting for take out. 

-Ha Long Bay falls into the same sphere as many restaurants in Madison that think that to make food hot, it is acceptable to toss a full bottle of crushed red pepper into a dish 2 minutes before serving it. This is also the only way to get food spicy at Ha Long Bay (but, again, getting hot food in Madison is impossible, unless you go to Vientiane Palace). 

-The music is sometimes so bad that it's hard to concentrate on eating. Think oriental elevator folk music with strings."}
{"text":"Delicious Vietnamese food. It's so beautiful. Spicy like the sunshine, mild like the morning mist. There's a wide enough range of flavors to satisfy any palate, vegetarian/vegan and meat dishes and pretty good pho! That said, this is Madison, and I wasn't quite blown away.
The service is great, timely and friendly. 
If you bring a group, you may want to schedule ahead, because it gets busy! 
Great value and delicious food!

(p.s. visit sf or some other large city for the real stuff)"}
{"text":"We LOVE the staff and service here and chow down twice monthly here.  The food is excellent and beer is cold and delicious.  You can't go wrong with the curry of your choice, and all appetizers are great. This is a great neighborhood spot to meet up with friends."}
{"text":"Yum!!! This was my very first stop in Madison and I was impressed! I ordered the vegetable yellow curry and vegetable spring rolls (they are actually summer rolls) and the food was excellent! And I didn't dine in, just got carry out, but the place looks very nice from inside and the staff was very friendly. I'd definitely be back. :-)"}
{"text":"I'm confused about how this place is garnering so many 4 and 5 star reviews.  It certainly wasn't the worst meal of my life but I expect much more out of a restaurant.  We we came in we weren't greeted.  We waited around while people passed and finally someone, I believe a waitress, asked if we had been helped and proceeded to take our name and tell us it would probably be 15 minutes.  Every single diner who entered after us was told the same thing....The thing is there were technically tables available, they just needed to be bused and nobody was busing them.  Someone would go grab some dishes off of it and then later someone else would grab the glasses and maybe clean it off.  I'm going to summarize the rest of the dinner much quicker.  Slow service, never got another drink, both orders messed up and by messed up I mean completely fucking wrong.  I'm a vegetarian and I was served chicken.  I actually hate it when I dine with people and they send their food back for little things that are wrong, it's horrible to think that the food just gets thrown away so I ate it anyway rather that waste it.  I can say that I definitely don't miss chicken, it was completely bland and dry.  We never got asked for dessert.  It took forever to get our check and after we did we ended up just walking to the front to pay as no one came back for the bill.  The food wasn't very warm nor fresh tasting.  
I've had worse food and actually I've had worse service but there are so many quality places I can spend my money and time why bother settling for this?"}
{"text":"I went here last Friday with my family and everything was amazing! I had the squash curry and even though it wasn't as spicy as I would've liked (I ordered hot and could barely taste anything spicy at all), the flavors were outstanding. The atmosphere and service was great, and I always respect a place that carries New Glarus brews.

Overall I loved it, and I'll definitely be eating there again soon!"}
{"text":"Very good and love the variety on the menu! Nice location, but difficult to find parking sometimes."}
{"text":"Our group arrived on a Friday evening for dine in service. There were two larger tables empty for reservations. We waited with bated breath for an empty table in the bustling dining room. 15 minutes later, we were  seated on the elevated dining area with a window view of Willy Street. 

We started with the Chicken Pan Fried Dumplings (6 for $5.95)  and Pork and Shrimp Spring Rolls (a steal for $4.25 for 2). The Spring rolls came with a liquid dipping sauce, not the thick sweet hoisin paste served at most other places. The delicate rice wrap was filled with crisp lettuce, vermicelli noodles, bean sprouts, crunchy cucumber and cilantro, in addition to the pork and shrimp. It was a very light and tasty appetizer, the sauce could have stood to have more flavor. They do have hot sauces and hoisin sauce on the table caddy so you can create your own dipping sauce to your liking. The chicken dumplings were much adored over. The thick wrappers contained delectable morsels of minced chicken, cabbage, and onion. The signs of  authenticity was visual, no manufactured consistency in the appearance of  each dumping. These fine little purses were mis-shapen and that's a good sign that it's home-made. 

For the entree, we had the Pho Tai Nam, Bo Vien with sliced beef, beef flank ($8.25), and meatballs, Pad Thai with Tofu ($10.25), Beef Pad Kee Mao (Drunken Noodle $10.25), and the Green Curry with Tofu ($10.25).

I'm a frequenter of Saigon Noodles, and I have to give the Pho-rophy to Saigon. The broth at Ha Long Bay was flavorful, but can't hold a candle to the deep, buttery, heartwarming soup at Saigon's. They were generous with the portion of the noodles, and the standards of sides of bean sprouts, basil, jalapeno, and lime. Comparatively to the cost of other menu items, this dish is a good deal for what you're getting. The Pad Thai was richly coated in sauce and had good egg and tofu ration throughout the dish. I did not notice any tomato or broccoli in the Drunken Noodle but the wide rice noodle dish didn't taste as if any ingredients were missing. The Green Curry was the biggest disappointment, the curry was very runny, like soup and due to this fact, the vegetables and tofu didn't retain any flavor of the spices and tasted like boiled vegetables. I would not get this again on our next visit.

Level of spice is 1-4, so proceed with caution. When we remarked how large the menu was, our waitress suggested coming in at lunch to try the dishes sometimes as it's usually cheaper for a smaller portion and the lunch meals comes with salad or soup.

The dining room was especially smokey on our visit, one of our companions had mentioned her eyes were starting to water in the restaurant. Not sure if this would affect anyone else."}
{"text":"I can only echo what others have said about their amazing menu. Every possible combination of Thai, Laotian and Vietnamese food is available here. The prices are a little high, since extra noodles or meat ranged from an extra $1.5-2. I have mainly had lunch here, their food is usually very good, but sometimes the wait is long. I guess because the place is so popular. Parking is on the street only be very aware of the signs, and this is no place for kids."}
{"text":"The soups are rather distinctive. Budget extra time in your schedule for decent, but slightly slower, service."}
{"text":"Is 4.9 stars possible? Not quite a 5 yet, but so so close that I'm giving them 5 anyway. 

Still so good. I got some pho the other day when I left work early due to a cold.  When I went to pick up my order, the cashier asked if I was feeling okay and I said I had a cold. She ran back to the kitchen and tossed another small container of pho broth in my bag. AWESOME! 

Everyone knows their pho is good, but another stand out is the LS7 Nem Khao Tod: Crispy rice with minced sour sausage, chicken, onion, cilantro, mint, lime juice, topped with peanuts; served with lettuce for wrapping. Now I know sour sausage sounds weird; trust me, just try it. It's amazing.

The portions are huge, the prices are right and the flavors are bomb. It's popular and they don't take rezzies (except for larger groups) so expect to wait on some nights. If you get out for lunch, they have some great deals."}
{"text":"Until last night, I thought I didn't know the difference between good pho and bad pho. Last night I ate at Ha Long Bay and discovered that actually, I DO know the difference, but I'd never had terrible pho before.

We stopped in for a \"quick\" bowl of pho after skiing (so, we were cold and hungry. our standards were low.) We ordered pho, because at every authentic pho restaurant I've ever eaten at (maybe a dozen?) it takes about 90 seconds for the soup to come out after ordering. Not so at Ha Long Bay. It took about 20 minutes for us to get our food. How is that even possible? You dump some broth over the noodles, throw some beef on top, and its done! There's no cooking involved! When our pho finally appeared, it was pathetic. The broth was one-dimensional and the meat was severely lacking. I ordered #7, which is supposed to have rare beef, beef flank, and beef balls. It had ZERO rare beef (maybe because it just sat there, waiting for our waitress to decide to do her job and cooking away in the broth?), about 4 little shreds of tough overdone beef, and one beef ball cut into 3 pieces. My husband got the delux pho, which had roughly the same amount of meat, but featured the biggest, most inedible piece of tripe I've ever seen. Think ping-pong ball sized. Gross. If we hadn't been starving and already waiting for our dinner for so long, we probably would have sent the food back it was so obviously lacking. 

Between the bad service and the worse food, I'll never eat here again. I would rather not eat pho in Madison ever again than pay another $8 for this junk."}
{"text":"Good place to eat with good food. But place needs to be bigger especially during dinner. We waited more than an hour for a table once. Never doing it again."}
{"text":"Great food but the place is way too busy. Go during dinner hours and you'll be waiting for forever. The place is just....too busy. They are other places in town that are just as amazing and have no wait."}
{"text":"Ha Long Bay is one of my top recommendations to people if they're looking to try something new in Madison or haven't tried Vietnamese, Thai, or Lao food before. We made a reservation for when they opened right away in the morning, and within a half hour of being open, the whole restaurant was already filled!

I always start with a glass of Thai tea; you won't regret that decision. 

I normally get the panang curry with tofu, a hearty bowl of peanut-y goodness, but I was feeling a home-cooked meal, so I had a bowl of banh canh with chicken, a soup dish with hand rolled rice/tapioca noodles. 

The banh canh tastes so much like the one my mom would make, and I love that they give me a plate of vegetables to add in. The noodles taste homemade, which is how you know if it's good banh canh. 

If you want it spicy, their levels of spicy definitely cater to an American level of spiciness as a heads up, because although I ordered five stars of spiciness, I added in more chili afterward.

Service can be spotty, but the food makes up for the wait, and I can promise you that you will most likely leave with a full stomach."}
{"text":"We came on a Monday night at 8 pm and there was a significant line.  Luckily we weren't deterred and we really didn't have to wait long, many of the people were picking up take-out.  We were really treated to a delicious meal in a really fun atmosphere.  I'm excited to find good pho in Madison!  My husband and son had Thai food and that was excellent as well. We'll be back, for sure."}
{"text":"The dumplings are amazing! Probably some of the best in the entire Madison area!

I have eaten here more times than I can think of, and I order many different items from the menu. Everything I've had has tasted fresh, and is always excellent. My only wish is that I still worked near there and could have lunch there 1-2 times a week like I used to.

Besides the dumplings, I highly recommend a few items:

The Yum Nuah or Yum Gai (SL3) - it's a salad with either beef or chicken - just fantastic!
Any of the Bun dishes - they are all fantastic! A cool noodle dish that is very awesome on a hot day!
The Mi Xao Don - Crispy Egg Noodle - fold the edges in - and wait for the sauce to soak up the noodles. They become soft and have a crispy/fried taste while being soft and easier to eat.
Last, but not least, their Pho. It is top notch. Ask for them to keep the raw beef on the side when you order so you can let it cook yourself. Otherwise it can come out a little too cooked, and not rare anymore. I think they probably do that to accommodate Caucasian patrons, and there's nothing wrong with that.

Try this place. I drive over from Middleton at least a month just for dumplings. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"I love Ha Long Bay so so so so much. Once in a while the food is too oily or off a little but it is always delicious. AP10!"}
{"text":"We love Ha Long Bay. The dining experience in the restaurant itself is fine.. nothing to gush about or complain about. Expect to wait, as the restaurant is extremely popular and the kitchen is BUSY! They do a ton of takeout, as well as food for the diners in their space. The food is worth any wait though! We have eaten here (in the space and for takeout - both great!) on several occasions, although we love our regular selections so much that it's hard to drift away to try new things! Dishes we absolutely love are the squash curry, pad thai, and the chicken and veggies with a rich but sweet peanut sauce. I love the red curry Thai noodle soup in the winter, so warm and comforting. We have also had the spring rolls, peanut chicken and cashew chicken. Our very young son loves the chicken satay.. seasoned, grilled chicken tenders on a stick that are served with peanut sauce. If you're considering trying Ha Long Bay, do it! The food is sooo yummy."}
{"text":"Always a pleasure coming here for the Pho! Best place I know on this side of town! I get the PH6 all of the time and some Thai Iced Tea. It always hits the spot! Service is always fast and pleasant. The waiting staff is always very attentive and the Pho is always good! I highly recommend coming here for the hangover cure! And their Guava candy is super tasty! I enjoy grabbing a bag of those @ the local Asian markets. Don't think I've ever used the restrooms here. The place is pretty narrow so there is enough seating for a crowd but it might be a bit tight. I bring the kids here and we make it work sitting in one of the booths but I wish it was bigger. Oh well, can't really find much bigger on Willy Street. The buildings aren't the biggest on this street. Anyway, this place is awesome! Try their Laap! It's awesome!"}
{"text":"Don't let the wait turn you away. This place is the one of the best places I have eaten at within a reasonable drive from home. 
A must try"}
{"text":"Lots and lots of flavor.  Each dish has it's own flavor profile, and depending what mood I'm in, I'm always satiated.   I am having fun exploring the menu.  I do have my favorites though!"}
{"text":"Mediocre food with horrible service. We've been here maybe 3x, each time same thing. Tonight- Our wait was longer than quoted, ok fine no big deal. Our server took another 10 minutes to take our order. Apps came out at a decent time, entree was at least 15 minutes after apps were finished. Our food took forever, like tables sat after us had their food before us. He never came back to check on us (I had wanted cilantro since my pho didn't have any on the plate). We boxed up our own food... ever boxed up pho? I spilled half of it on my table.. this place could be fantastic if the service was better and they suggested apps & drinks- he never even asked about drinks, we just had water. Up your service game Ha Long Bay and your servers will make more money and you'll have faster turn around time, which means more paying customers."}
{"text":"This was our first time at this highly recommended Thai/Vietnamese restaurant. We are huge fans of Thai food, but this was our first Thai food venture in Madison. The restaurant felt small upon walking inside because it was very busy, but there was ample seating and we only had to wait about 20 minutes to get seated, which was just the right amount of time to read through the extensive menu. 

We started with the Thai fresh rolls. I would give these maybe 3 stars. Not very impressive. The lettuce seemed a little soggy. 

I ordered the Shrimp Pho and boy was it good. Definitely a 4/5 stars. Just the right amount of rice noodles accompanied a large portion of shrimp and bowl choy; however, I did ask for extra protein ($2 surcharge). The flavor of the pho broth was spot on and the side of basil, bean sprouts and jalapeños added extra flare. I added spicy garlic sauce for some extra heat. 

We also order the squash curry which was easily a 5/5 stars. Three kinds of squash were cooked in a spicy red curry sauce. The squash wasn't mushy and with a little bit of rice, the dish was fantastic. We have a tolerance for heat, so next time instead of medium, we will order it hot. 

This place will most likely become a staple for us. It was wonderful finding a nice restaurant to satisfy our Thai/Vietnamese food craving!!!"}
{"text":"Ahh after waiting 1.5 hrs at A Pig in a Fur Coat and still cant seated, we gave up and came here! It was 9:30pm, We were starving and just wanted to stuff our face at this point! I ordered chicken egg roll since I have never had egg rolls here before and I was craving for something fried. It was phenomenal! Just the right amount if crisp and not too oily! Nommm I basically ate it under a min. Then had my standard squash currie. Same yummness! Thumbs up HaLongBay for saving my arse on a cold starving winter night!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed dinner here last night with a friend. Walking into the place I thought it was really nicely decorated. Not over done, but very welcoming. We were seated at one of the tables overlooking Willy St. I am not a Thai food aficionado. I don't know what's authentic and I don't really care. I more judge the food on whether or not I like how it tastes. I liked how everything I tried here tasted. 

The menu was huge, so having an idea what you are hungry for helps narrow down the search. Dinner started with some of the chicken egg rolls. They were crisp on the outside and yummy on the inside, served quickly and very hot. I opted for the Mango Chicken Curry (2 star spiciness cause I'm a wimp). It was lovely. Chunks of squash, potato, mango, and pineapple in a tasty sauce. I thoroughly enjoyed it. My friend had the Peanut Stir-Fry with Shrimp. The bit I tasted was pretty spicy but still had a nice flavor. The service was prompt, friendly, and our waiter was kinda cute, which is always a nice perk."}
{"text":"They don't make Bahn mi because it's \"too much work\". Their 'peanut sauce' for the spring rolls was vinegar and their Pad Thai is way too sweet with a runny sauce. Quality? Oh no! Never again!
If u want good Vietnamese, go to Saigon on Odana Rd."}
{"text":"My rating is totally based on the service and not the food. Food is fine here but I had  terrible overall experience which ruined the good part too. They made me wait for over 40 minutes (after saying that waiting time is only 10 minutes). Besides, they seated other people who came after me. After I got seated, they took another 10 minutes to take the order. I know this is a very popular place, there is a lot of waiting usually. But they need to make sure that they are attending customers in order and with priority. I went with high expectation but came out with this review."}
{"text":"After hearing rave reviews about the Bay for over a year, I finally hit it 3 weeks ago. I was looking for something that would match the Han. I started with the Egg Rolls. Pretty good, not great. I then ordered the Chicken Pad Thai. It was a little too slimy, we don't like that. It was a good Asian place, not the best I've ever had. The limes in the water were a nice touch."}
{"text":"Thai is my comfort food, and Ha Long Bay is so good, so this place gives me the warm fuzzies. I couldn't decide between the squash and panang curries, so our waiter suggested getting the squash, but adding peanut sauce. It was perfect. One of my companions got the pad thai, which was great, and not sickly sweet like some places, and the other got Hu Tiêu Xào which was chewy, pan fried noodles and lots of crisp vegetables. 
The only con we experienced was that this place is just so darn popular. We knew it would be busy, but wow, people really cram themselves in there. We waiting 45 minutes for a table around 6:30 on a Friday. We scored the only three seats in the waiting area, so we were happy campers. We were fine with the initial wait, but it also took a long time to receive our entrees, I believe close to 45 minutes placing our order. I would have been grumpy by then, but we orders appetizers (crab rangoon and spring rolls, both great) so we were ok. 
The service was good, the wait not so good, but really none of that matters because the food is so amazing!"}
{"text":"Visiting from OC and the land of accessible and pretty good Vietnamese food, I had pretty high standards for this place. With an extensive menu that had both Thai and Vietnamese dishes I started to get a bit worried. I agreed with Jason O. that they probably had thai dishes on their menu to appeal to the general midwestern populace that wasn't so interested in Vietnamese food.  

We had the tom rang muoi (shrimp with salt/black pepper) and the pork com tam. Perhaps we didn't choose the best dishes, but the tom rang muoi tasted quite bland with the salt/pepper mixture being nonexistent. There was also very little heat with the jalepenos provided.  Also, in my experience, tom rang muoi is traditionally prepared with the shells still being on the shrimp in order to keep more seasoning on and in the shrimp as it's being fried. This shrimp was peeled...ultimately leading to its strange texture and blandness.

The pork com tam we had was just a generic pork chop flavored with lemongrass and grilled. The pork was flavored nicely, but was quite overdone and ended up being a bit dry. The dish came with most of the traditional garnishes for com tam, but was missing the traditional egg/pork \"meatloaf\" that disappointed me. 

All in all, Ha Long Bay was a bit of a flop. I won't be coming back here on my visits to Madison. Don't let this place ruin Vietnamese food for you. I'm giving this place 2 stars, one for their attempt to create a good Vietnamese restaurant in Madison, and the other for having such a wide variety of choices...albeit the choices that we had were greatly disappointing."}
{"text":"Have you ever had a meal so delicious that your only disappointment was not trying the place sooner? That's how I felt leaving Ha Long Bay last weekend. My friend and I ordered several appetizers, entrees and desserts because neither of us had been there before and the menu is extensive. There was so much we wanted to try. 

We were not disappointed in a single dish. The standouts for me were the veggie egg rolls, crab meat wontons, and the perfectly fried tofu in my Pra Ram Long Song (TE1). The blueberry rangoons for dessert were amazing. Everything was fresh food, freshly prepared. 

The service was good and the menu is nicely organized. Items are numbered, of course, making ordering a breeze. As a vegetarian, there were tons of options for me and my meat-eating friend found no shortage either. I very highly recommend Ha Long Bay. 

Update- Having been here several more times, and tried many more menu items, my 5-star rating stands solid. Got squash curry with tofu today and even though they were crazy busy, all our food was brought out hot and fresh. They are usually crazy busy at dinner time, and I've seen people wait over 30 minutes for a table, so be aware that's possible. But people wait because they know it's worth it. 

Final update- Just tried the Pad Thai and let me tell you, folks, if this restaurant were a man I'd marry him."}
{"text":"Thoroughly mediocre Thai/Vietnamese food.

This past Friday, our group called ahead for reservations and thank goodness we did; a group before us was told it would be about a 45 minute wait.  We were seated close to the front of the restaurant, and the constant opening and closing of the door meant it was actually quite chilly.

Our waitress came by to take our orders pretty quickly and the food came out in good time. However, the food was subpar; in particular the meat was overcooked and everything kind of tasted the same. Definitely quantity over quality. I honestly wouldn't mind if the menu was narrowed somewhat if that meant the dishes weren't all made from the same batches of meat and soggy vegetables.  The pineapple fish and squash curry were both good.  Medium spice tasted pretty mild to me though.  And   what should have been a classic warning sign: forks provided instead of chopsticks."}
{"text":"The food is mediocre but it's the most authentic you will find in white-bread Wisconsin. However the service is atrocious. I placed an order for take out and I was still waiting an hour later to take my food from the restaurant. When I expressed my displeasure to the manager (women with all of the dope chest piece tattoos) she was really snarky and unapologetic. When I finally got my food and returned home, my spring rolls were in pieces. This place is great if you want white-friendly flavorless pho and to be treated like an afterthought"}
{"text":"Best Southeast Asian I've had in the Madison area so far. Spicy wonton appetizer has an incredible sauce. Everything tastes fresh and seasoned right. Wine is pretty cheap at the mid 20s. 
Very busy so you might have to wait but it's worth it."}
{"text":"Love this place!  The menu is extensive! When we go, we try something new each time. Well, with the exception of the dumplings, which we get every time because they are delicious!"}
{"text":"The essence: Some very good food, correspondingly busy, creating a bit of chaos, leading to slow (but helpful and friendly) service, requiring a bit of patience on a Friday evening.

My red curry was excellent; my wife's Pad See Ew was OK - all the ingredients were fresh and fine, but the dish was perhaps a bit monotone.  Even if this dish wasn't an instant favorite, there is a palpable sense that this place cares about their food.  Thus, we look forward to coming back and exploring more of the vast (perhaps too vast?) menu.

This place is no secret; the place was packed and had a line outside early on a Friday evening.  They do not take reservations, so please consider having a backup plan (or two) if you come.  

The crowd did cause some service issues.  Our dining experience threatened to stall with a few noticeably long waits (e.g. to place our first drink order, between appetizers and our main course, for a drink order to be filled).  We were out with family and so conversation flowed continuously, making the gaps appear seamless.    Our server's attitude also helped - making me feel as if they have good people and a culture of service; hence, I expect they'll continue to improve their service-level over time.  

My rating is 3* for now, subject to revision (upwards?) after I come back a few more times. I find myself rooting for this place.  Perhaps I'm a bit overly optimistic and want this place to be better than it really is.  Did I mention that my red curry was excellent?  I encourage you to give it a try."}
{"text":"Love the Pad Thai (veganized) so much, it's been hard for me to branch out and try other items on the menu. I did try the drunken noodles once (although I was sober) which have an interesting array of vegetables, but it was very good. Would highly recommend both dining in and taking out!"}
{"text":"Everything on the huge menu is numbered for easy ordering. Come for the fabled AP 10, the turducken of Asian appetizers, a fried egg roll inside a normal spring roll. That and big bowl of pho and you'll be very happy. They do a stir fry served on crispy pan fried fat rice noodles that we love and get all the time. Forgot the number, sorry.

It's a casual neighborhood place, the food is fresh, tasty and fairly priced, and consequently they are jam-packed ALL the time. If you come at 5:30 you might walk in and get a table, but otherwise you'll be waiting. If 8 or 10 people are standing around outside the front door, it's a bad sign."}
{"text":"the dumplings are amazing. carry out can sometimes take a while, but the food is delicious!"}
{"text":"People LOVE this place.  I am luke-warm.  The sauces are thin and the service is slow."}
{"text":"Descriptive phrase: authentic-ish and de-lish East Asian eatery.

Ha Long Bay serves up Vietnamese, Thai, and Laotian food to the Willy St crowd (and there will be a crowd, expect waits of at least 30 minutes), and does it well. It's bright and airy inside, and the service was quick. I ordered the Xào Rau Cai (VE3) ($9.95). I was served a mountain of chicken, broccoli, peapods, carrots, baby corn, and mushrooms, stir fried with fat and flat noodles. There are not enough \"noms\" in Vietnamese. The \"medium\" spiciness was perfectly tasty and hot. There didn't appear to be much of a sauce, but you could taste it with each bite. Companions' dishes were equally delicious, from different countries on the menu.

Easy 4.5 stars, but I'll reserve perfection for my next visit. And you can bet I'll be back."}
{"text":"I've only actually dined in the restaurant once but I have eaten their catering at plenty of work-related events and it is always on point. Ha Long Bay was actually the first Asian food I tried in Madison because we got it catered at a department event and as soon as I tasted their food, I breathed a sigh of relief knowing that there was some solid Pad Thai around. 

Since then, I have tried a couple of their curries and their fried rice, again mostly catered for work-related events, and I have not been disappointed at all! The squash curry is particularly delicious and whenever we get it catered for work, we rarely have leftovers because everyone scarfs it down. I have yet to try their pho but it looks really good as well. The service is friendly, and their catering is reliable and easy. Makes me wish I lived on Willy St so I had easier access to this gem of a place!"}
{"text":"This is an amazing restaurant, not only is the food pretty good, but the atmosphere sets a cozy, relaxed tone to the restaurant. Very spacious and can accommodate quite a few people. I ordered the Pho which was as good as I've ever had...and I've had some all over the world. All in all, it was a good experience, my review may change the more I eat there. Hopefully not negatively though, as I'm pretty impressed with it so far.

{"text":"This is my go to restaurant when I'm in Madison. We decided not to go on Saturday because of how long the wait to get seated would be, which my friend shared is anywhere from 45 - 60 minutes. 

So we decided to go on Sunday once they opened at 11:30 am. It's a good thing we left a little early, by the time we arrived there were already people outside waiting to get in. Luckily we were able to get a booth, but in 30 minutes the restaurant was already full. 

There were 3 servers and ours had more tables than the others which resulted us in waiting a little longer to get our order taken. Just keep that in mind because it can be frustrating when you see another table get served that was seated after you. I love their chicken dumplings pan fried, it's my go to and their beef pad see ew is so filling I always have left overs for later. Be patient because it does take some time to prepare the food."}
{"text":"Of course we had to try Ha Long due to the massive amount of highly rated reviews on Yelp.  We didn't realize how long the wait would be on a Friday night either, but we toughed it out and waited an hour for our table.  Too bad this wait was not worth it.  

Once we looked at the menu, we noticed that the cuisine is not strictly Vietnamese or Thai, but rather a combination of items from South East Asia.  We were totally OK with this, it'll be nice to have choices.  

We decided to stick with Viet items and had the crispy fried seafood noodles and a bowl of pho.  The wait for food also took a long time and sadly was a disappointment.

Both the noodle choices were unimpressive in presentation and less so in taste.  The crispy noodles were plentiful, but not crispy.  The sauce was plain and the toppings overcooked.  We've definitely had better crispy noodles elsewhere.  Then we tried the pho and was just saddened by it.  Broth was lazy and ingredients lacking, especially for a \"special.\"  

Maybe we should've had Thai or Laos food from this place but we doubt we'd be coming back.  The food was just not to our liking."}
{"text":"Ginger chicken was stellar and they make very good Pad Thai.  Service was fairly good for the degree to which it was crowded, and it was very crowded.  Waited 20 minutes and it looked like the wait list only got longer.  But it was well worth it!"}
{"text":"Food is a high point here, which helps make up for any negatives in my book.  The curries, fried rice, soups and fried noodle dishes are almost always good here.  They've had a few off nights (too sweet pad see yew, too oily drunken noodles, etc) but when things are good they're very, very good.  Spice levels are \"midwestern average\", so order a star hotter if you like spicy food.

The negatives: it's loud.  The place is in dire need of sound-absorbing decor.  When it's busy you can barely hear the person across the table from you without yelling.    It's also only open until 9:30pm, even on Friday and Saturday night.  My guess is that they could do business until at least 10:30pm on Willy St those nights- it's sometimes completely full at closing time.  Sometimes a hankering for Thai sets in after Geriatric Early Bird Dining Hours when you live downtown, and then the grim reality of their business model makes you search out a less-desirable curry rice fix."}
{"text":"Great lunch specials ($). Good Tom yum and spring rolls, too. Not quite Lao Laan, but they do add thai eggplant to the squash curry and that is a bonus. Nice staff."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and although happy with my meals, had not been overly impressed.

Today, however, I just had the best bowl of Tom Kha I have ever had. Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Remember that Seinfeld episode where they talk about a restaurant that has every sort of international cuisine? Sometimes it seems like Ha Long Bay is trying to be that for Asian food. The menu is absurdly long, and has Thai, Vietnamese and Laotian Food. Ordering can be a little overwhelming.  

In my experience, they don't do Thai food as well as the dedicated Thai restaurants in town, and same with Laotian, but every dish is a very solid attempt, and the portions are huge. If you want Pad Thai and your friend wants Pho, this is the place. I would generally say that seafood is not the best bet here. It must be coming out of a bag frozen -- the mussels were particularly tough and fishy.    

There are a ton of Vietnamese specialties that I've never had, and we are having a good time working our way around the huge menu. I dubbed V6 today \"general Tso's Eggplant.\" Yum. 

The staff is friendly, and refills on rice are free. I've had very slow service when it's been busy sometimes."}
{"text":"The HS5 is amazing. Food was a little slow getting to us but it was very busy. Good prices and great servers."}
{"text":"If you are looking for some Asian food on Willy St. this is the place to go! The pho is decent and they have a large variety on their menu. Their Thai dishes are pretty good too. Just another comfortable Asian place with reasonable prices for their food. I wouldn't say it was one of the best Asian restaurants I've had, but probably one of the best around here. 4 stars considering where we are. Most of the items on the menu are satisfactory - pretty good."}
{"text":"I was looking at this place for a while and couldn't wait to stop by for lunch.

We got there and noticed they were super packed and we were told that at least 15 minutes for a table, such a great sign.

The place was colorful with green and orange walls that played off the wood. There is a cool front window seating area that we didn't get. The place is small and I'm noticing this about Maddison places in general. There is booths and tables down the length of the place.

Service was great despite every table in service so no issues there. The menu is super huge which made it hard to pick something.

The triple delight was very good with a sweet coconut milk sauce and not as hot as we wanted, all white meat and the shrimp was the star. The fresh spring rolls were the very good and probably the best I have ever had. The chicken Wanton was was the star of the table and I can't express how good they were, nice chicken flavor and no skimping on the chicken. See my pictures.

So far this has been my favorite meal I have had in the Maddison area to date and I would defiantly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Great food and lunch is generous! Wait is an issue when it's busy - but it's busy because it's really good. Go for lunch when it's a little quieter and enjoy the tom yum that comes with lunch specials (last page of the menu - and only one page, making it a little easier to decide than the vast dinner menu).

Enjoy."}
{"text":"It's my second time here and it never let me down. Very reasonable prices and tasty food. I love papaya salad (spicy), all kinds of curry dishes and Tom yum soups."}
{"text":"I really wish there was better Thai food in Madison than Ha Long Bay.  Don't get me wrong, the food was perfectly fine and not too expensive either.  But I love Thai food so much, and was just really hoping for this place to be better than it was.  A lot of my friends love this place, and honestly I've been pretty consistently underwhelmed.  It's good, but not somewhere I'd go out of my way to eat at."}
{"text":"Man, this is the biggest menu I've ever seen.  On weekend nights be prepared for a long wait.  This is a great addition to the neighborhood. One of my all time-faves in town for Lao/Thai is Lao Lang Xiang, just down Willy St. Maybe now I can get a table there on a weekend night.    Ha Long Bay serves to complement Lao Lang Xiang instead of compete with it.

I've tried several dishes and all have been good. Service was good and the prices are right."}
{"text":"We came around 5:30 pm so there was no wait. It took our waiter good 10 min to get our order even tho it wasn't busy yet. I ordered Tum yum soup and squash cury with spice level at 4 (which wasn't spicy at all). Food was delicious and the portions were pretty big, good for sharing. Definitly a good place if you are looking for good Thai food."}
{"text":"I just simply ADORE the food here. I come here EVERY week :):) 

Faves and MUST-haves:
Vietnamese Crepe (only on weekends): The cripsy outside is filled to the brim with loads of bean sprouts and loads of meat and shrimps. The fish sauce just finishes it so well!!!! Love it!
Vietnamese Iced Tea: Might be a little sweet at times, depends on who makes it. If it is too sweet, let the ice melt for a while, will be perfect in a few minutes! 
Anything with sticky rice rocks!
Laab: Huge plate of minced meat with awesome flavor! Delish!
Bun (with all the meats): AWESOME! love dried vermicelli with fish sauce. The grilled meats are done JUST RIGHT!

It is rather busy anytime after 7pm, so you might have to wait 15 to 20 minutes.. and yes, since they are so popular, the service is a little slow. But they give such tasty soursop candy as your \"farewell gift\". Love it!

If you're into spice and southeast asian food, one of the MUST GO-es in Mad-town :):):) (Btw, they are really nice about no spice and no onions/cilantro etc, just tell the server!)"}
{"text":"Ha Long Bay is phenomenal.  I decided to write this review after eating my left overs.  I had to restrain myself from going around and singing the praises of this restaurant to my co-workers - and they were left overs!  I've only been there twice but I'm already hankering for more.

The place itself is adorable - it's a good size for Willy street but probably hard to get more than 4 people seated in a decent amount of time because they get busy.  Don't expect a quick meal either - it does take a while to get the food but it is SO worth it.  They cook it when you order it; plain and simple - so sometimes it taks a little longer.

I've personally had the Squash Curry and Yellow Curry Thai Fried Rice and both were amazing.  Their crab wontons are delish too.  Check it out!"}
{"text":"On recommendation tried this place.  Located about 5 minutes from the capital in the Willy Street neighborhood.  I tried the Pho - excellent!!  Also tris the house specialty.  Seasoning was great and well prepared.   Ginger tea for drink. 

Wait staff very pleasant and excellent service.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I go to Thailand every couple years, so at the risk of invoking ethno-racial \"authenticity,\" I think I know what I'm talking about with SEAsian/Thai food. This place hits the spot, for both pho and Thai dishes!!!! Curries are great in addition to Thai noodle dishes, plus the pho.

Atmosphere is \"vibrant\" without feeling crowded. Wish they had delivery tho."}
{"text":"Best Thai in madison.  Yummy iced coffee, delicious curry.  They are ALWAYS busy though, so be prepared to wait."}
{"text":"Good food, good service, horrible parking. Been here numerous time and have not gotten a dish that I don't like. The pho is so-so but that's Madison for you. The whole deep fried snapper fish is delicious! It's my go to place for good Asian food."}
{"text":"The food is excellent. It's usually really busy when I go there, so the service can be a bit slow. Also, in the wintertime, it can be kind of chilly in there, and in the summertime, a little toasty."}
{"text":"My favorite casual Thai restaurant in Madison. Great value for the prices. If you haven't tried the Nem Khao Tod (LS7) you should stop what you're doing and go order it now! It will change your life."}
{"text":"I have been to Ha Long Bay many many times over the past few years.  I think it's safe to say it is one of the best asian restaurants in town, if not the best thai/Lao/Vietnamese place. When I first went to ha long bay maybe 4 years ago the service was pretty slow but the amazing food made it worth the long wait for me. Over the years their service had gotten significantly much better and I really have no complaints. They now have a great, fast and tentative service crew to compliment the delicious food. Some of my favorite dishes are the Pad See Ew, Pork Eggrolls, Tom Yum Soup, Drunken Noodles,  Pho and Panang Curry. The only complaint I have about food is that sometimes the stirfried chicken in dishes is dry, other than that the flavors are great. Also i think the wall colors are a bit too crazy for me (orange and green walls)."}
{"text":"Very fine Vietnamese food. Can get quite busy at lunchtime with a corresponding long wait for food."}
{"text":"Lunch at Ha Long Bay. This place is always hopping. Really, even at odd hours. Met a friend there. He ordered Pad Thai so I decided to follow suit. I haven't eaten Pad Thai in years but it sounded like a good idea . I had to shake off my urge to eat pho or my favorite, vegetable combo.

As always, I was not disappointed. The noodles were excellent, spicy and toothsome. The shrimp actually tasted like seafood and were done to perfection. The spice level was a little low for a \"medium\" rating. 

My biggest challenge at Ha Long Bay is remembering what I ate and stopping myself from ordering the same thing over and over again.

Everyone says, \"Don't go there in a rush.\" I Agee. The service can be slow. Relax, breathe deep the sweet, sour and salty. Enjoy the food and venture out and try something new. Many wonderful dishes await.

Sadly I forgot to take a pic. Leftovers sit in he fridge but I am sure they would no longer \"represent\". Maybe next time...."}
{"text":"The best squash curry out of the numerous excellent Thai restaurants on Madison's near east side!  All of the curries that I have tried are delicious, rich, and creamy.  The menu is enormous, and even though I have eaten here at least a dozen times, I have barely scratched the surface of trying all the items that sound good.  The only reason for 4 stars is that the service is slooooow.  On multiple occasions I have waited at least 5 and somtimes 10 minutes for a server to come over just to take drink orders!  Word of warning, be prepared to order the first time your server comes, becausse if you send them away it will be a long time before they return."}
{"text":"The food was tasty (we ordered Chicken Pho and the fresh spring rolls), though I did have an MSG reaction after eating (I won't say it was 100% but that's my feeling).  My main complaint was the service.  Our waiter was rude and barely spoke.  He did not refill our water or ask how the food was, or if we wanted anything else.  Honestly, I was shocked.  Madison tends to be a pretty friendly town."}
{"text":"Amazing and the best Vietnamese food in Madison. They have these crispy rice noodles that make my mouth water just thinking about them. They have a great Sauvignon Blanc which is just icing on the cake. Oh and ask for extra peanut sauce on the spring rolls - you'll be happy you did. We go at least once a week and it isn't enough. Go go go!!"}
{"text":"The reviews are all spot on. This is the best Thai food in Madison!

The Thai iced tea is delicious, and the perfect afternoon drink. I don't want to know how many calories are in it but I finished it no problem. Their lunch specials are phenomenal as well. You get a ton of food for a small price, I had plenty for leftover lunch the second day. 

I ordered the chicken pad thai and soup to start. The soup was delicious and full of flavor. I'm not sure what kind it was but it was surprisingly very, very good. The pad thai was also excellent. It had nice char marks from the wok and the chicken was cooked perfectly. It really was the best pad thai I've ever had!

It's not the biggest restaurant so I can see how you may have to wait if you come to dinner. But we had no trouble getting a seat at lunch."}
{"text":"I used to live only about 5 blocks from Ha Long and ate there regularly.  I have since moved to DC and have not yet found a place there that makes as good summer rolls or Pho.  I miss it dearly and dream of my walks from Morrison St. to Ha Long."}
{"text":"Food I've had here is always 4-5 stars.  Usually we get take out.  

Recently we dined in for the first time.  Again, great food.  However, service was poor.  Not too slow, as others have noted, but just not friendly.  Our waitress had no smiles and was not friendly.  She was ok compares to the tall tattooed waitress, who just didn't seem to like people.  Hopefully she was just having a bad day, but it did not reflect well on the waitstaff."}
{"text":"I live very close to this restaurant and it is *always* busy at dinner time.That said, there is a reason. The menu is huge and I've never gotten something I didn't like. If you'd like to avoid the wait, consider ordering take-out."}
{"text":"Not really impressed, sorry! The wait was long, so we decided to get take out. It was really confsuing to order, and it took over half an hour to get some noodles. The guy was pretty rude when I asked how long it was going to take. We should have just gotten food from the coop, because for $9 I got some noodles with a few pieces of shrimp and some iceburg lettuce."}
{"text":"Ha Long Bay, the definition of a love hate relationship.

Food is excellent, service is deplorable. I write this over a takeout order that, while delicious, is not at all what I ordered."}
{"text":"I really like the Thai food here, especially the pad thai. It has long wait time and can be crowded but the food is great. Service was OK."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in Madison. Great menu at a great price.  It gets very crowded on the weekends so be prepared to wait. A must for anyone who enjoys Thai and Vietnamese food."}
{"text":"After reading the accolades about the squash curry, I had to check this place out.  I love squash.  I love curry.  Nuff said.  

I was charmed by the black booths, sundry plants, high ceilings, and random decor.  Not so much the lighting, which is warm over the tables and cool from the ceilings--which creates a strange effect.  

My server was dear and everything clean and prompt.  I'm just not so sold on the actual curry.  The flavor was good, and the moments the warm tones contrasted with the acidic basil leaves were great.  But the squash and zucchini were both a bit overcooked, and the tofu had a strange aftertaste.  I'm also not entirely clear on what makes it \"squash curry.\"  Like many curries, it contains a medley of vegetables, among which there is some squash.  

Anyhow, it was a solid meal for $9.50.  I don't regret it, but won't necessarily repeat it."}
{"text":"Sometimes it feels repetitive to give good reviews, so let me keep it short: delicious, huge selection, great service, portions big enough to take some home after. Loved it!"}
{"text":"I am obsessed with Ha Long Bay. I love getting it for takeout and dining in - there are pros & cons to both. I think the portions are bigger when you dine in, but the service is definitely slow (especially during the busiest hours of the night).

My favorite 3 items:
-AP10 - this flavorful treat is amazing. It's the perfect light start to a meal, and since it comes with 2, it's great to share.
-Panang Curry with tofu - this place has some of the best Panang I've ever had. I was so inspired by this panang that I almost named my cat after it (true story - ended up naming him Jim though).
-Pad Thai with chicken - my boyfriend always gets this, and I end up begging for bites every time.

I always have leftovers from the curry - enough for lunch the next day.
It's not the spiciness place ever; if you like a bit of a kick, but don't want it to overwhelm your meal, you're probably safe with a 2 or 2.5 (medium) level.

The restaurant itself is cute, although try to get a booth as some of the tables can be pretty close together. In addition, if you're dining in, the wine bottles are extremely reasonably priced at around $22.
If you want to dine in and there's a wait, go across the street for a drink at Gib's bar.

Overall, great place, great food, great prices (especially for the portion sizes) - can't beat it!"}
{"text":"My favorite squash curry in town! Also, really good pad thai.

Only 4 stars instead of 5 stars since their service could be improved- when we eat in, there is usually a really long wait for our food."}
{"text":"I went to Ha Long Bay last Friday for dinner. It started off awkwardly... We were standing inside the door waiting to be seated and another couple came in behind us. They were immediately helped and had their names put on a list to wait for tables. I had to say \"excuse me\" a couple times to get the man's attention. Maybe because I'm a female?? I have no idea. 

So the menu is huge as many have mentioned and everything I have tried is good. That being said I have not tried the seafood. 

Maybe skip the spring rolls, although they are delicious, I have had them twice and both times they were loosely wrapped and fell apart/difficult to eat. I had a Vietnamese tofu soup and my dining companion had a curry. Both were fantastic. 

Our waiter was strange (the guy who didn't want to take my name). But somewhere in the course of our dinner an older woman, perhaps an owner?? took over and was wonderful. She boxed up my soup - which I really appreciated. You get A LOT of soup!!"}
{"text":"The pan fried chicken dumplings are delicious!  I always get them even though I am usually full when my meal arrives. Last night the kitchen was on and they were the best we've had there. 

My favorite entree is the stir fried green beans. It has this great salty flavor that I think comes from the yellow beans and a sauce that allows the natural flavor of the food to shine. I always see other people eating it so it seems to be a favorite. 

The sweet and spicy chicken wings are in a delicious sauce that is so flavorful. They live up to their name without being too hot to taste anything else. 

My husband always gets one of their curries. While I am not a curry fan he raves about it. 

Service can be spotty but overall the food more than compensates. The menu is completely overwhelming, I think it is about 8 pages (small type). If you haven't been before I suggest you check out the menu online to at least narrow down what you want prior to arrival or else you can take forever to order. This is one of my favorite Madison restaurants and I'm so thankful my cousins brought me here my first month in town."}
{"text":"I'll say it again, I love, love, love Ha Long Bay. I usually stop in for lunch with coworkers, but tonight I stopped in with a friend for dinner. The wait for a table was a little long, but it was to be expected since the place is a pretty popular. I ordered my favorite, Thai iced tea (no cream) and pad see ew with chicken at a 5/4 on the \"secret\" spice scale (I call it the Asian spicy scale). I love the portion sizes!!! I worked on my dish for a good 10 minutes and it still looked like I didn't make a dent in it -- and still had leftovers to take home. For dessert my friend enjoyed the coconut rice with mango, and it was phenomenal as well.

Our waitress was so sweet, and made sure to check on us despite the fact that the restaurant was a full house. The louder noise level was to be expected since the place is a little cramped, but it wasn't bothersome. 

Definitely the BEST place for authentic Thai/Viet/Lao cuisine."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped in at 7:30 on a Saturday night expecting to wait 30-45 minutes for a table. The hostess gave us a 45-minute wait time, which we gladly accepted. 

One peculiar thing about Ha Long Bay is the lack of a bar or other space to enjoy drinks and appetizers while waiting for a table. The hostess counter doubles as the cashier station for the dine-in guests and steady supply of carryout customers. Had we been offered a drink, we would have gladly ordered a round to help pass the time. The interior is spacious, yet cozy, and could quite easily be modified to clean up the crowded waiting area. 

As our 45-minute mark approached, there were still several people who had arrived before us that had not been seated. A table for eight was reserved and left open the entire time we were waiting, and the group actually arrived around 8:15. As it turned out, my wife knew a member of that party and they had two unfilled seats, so they were nice enough to invite us to join them. Otherwise, it might have been another 15-20 minutes before we were at a table of our own. 

After sitting with our group, service was cordial and steady, but definitely with room for improvement. We each ordered Thai Iced Teas, along with the Pan-Fried Chicken Dumplings (six per order) and the Chicken Satay (four skewers per order) as appetizers. Both dishes were flavorful and cooked perfectly, with the appropriate garnishes. 

The menu here is huge, and covers at least three different asian cuisines extensively. For our entrees, we tried the Panang Chicken Curry and Xao Tham (a ginger chicken dish). The portions for both were huge, the Xao Tham could easily have been shared by two people, and the Panang was also very hearty. In terms of spiciness, the curry could have been ordered at least one notch higher (I ordered medium, but it was very tame). Like our appetizers, both entrees were cooked perfectly and comprised of high quality ingredients. 

The other members of our party had a variety of different entrees (Laab, Red Curry, Green Curry) and everyone was very satisfied with their selection. 

The waitress had no issue giving us separate checks upon request, and our bill for two (two appetizers, two entrees, two Thai Iced Teas) was just under $40 before tip. 

Long wait times seem to be consistent regardless of time of day/week, so plan on a two-hour experience from walk in through walk out, and possibly longer for a larger group. Put simply, go here with people you enjoy killing time with. 

Ha Long Bay could make the leap from 4.25 out of 5.0 to 4.5 or even 4.75 with relative ease by sorting out the waiting area, adding a bar, and finding ways to make service easier on their own staff. The food is on the same level as Lotus of Siam in Las Vegas. We will definitely be back often, as this is easily the best Asian restaurant we've been to over our 12 years in Madison.

{"text":"From apps to curries to noodles dishes, this place has EVERYTHING. The menu is huge and could be overwhelming, but I'm confident you can't go wrong. I would highly recommend the spicy wontons - probably often overlooked but amazing flavor. Ingredients in the spring roll are so fresh. Prices are very reasonable and service is attentive. Came for lunch on a Friday and it was packed."}
{"text":"Easily the best Thai place in Madison. Typically a long wait but so worth it. Amazing, authentic food and cheery workers! I've had most of the curry dishes they offer and loved them all. Prices are definitely affordable at about $11 for a huge meal. Favorite place to eat in all of Madison."}
{"text":"I've been here twice.  The first time was summer '09.  I can't remember what I ordered, but it was Vietnamese and it was good.  My last visit was more recent and I had the pho special.  

It wasn't special.  The pho broth tasted like pho bullion.  There was one piece of each type of meat.  The noodles got me full, but the soup definitely was not fulfilling in any way.  This is a shame because I like this place.  It's new, it's bright, and the service is polite.  

Heard the Thai dishes are better."}
{"text":"We LOVE this place. Our favorite take out joint in town!  Although it often takes a while to get someone's attention, the food is definitely worth the wait! 

The food is delicious, we especially like the Pad Thai, the spring rolls and curry puffs. 

We have eaten in a couple times but it is busy and loud, we prefer to take out."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in Madison! So many options, friendly, helpful staff. Even though it gets super busy it doesn't seem to lag ever. Veg options galore. Love it!"}
{"text":"Worth the long wait to be seated.  Food was excellent.  They were extremely busy and service was slow, but as good as the food was I am willing to overlook it!"}
{"text":"Honestly read really good reviews about this place and I came cause I was in town however their service was horrible and it took more than an hr for the food to arrive. Everytime I asked the waitress can we please order she walked away. Very disappointed. The food was alright."}
{"text":"Long wait for table for one, recommend reservations, spring rolls with shrimp were excellent, green curry with shrimp was watery, I think it was missing more of the curry spice. It was ok but I've had better at my favorite Thai place in my area. I think Vietnamese and Thai noodle menus looks tempting so I'll give it a try next time I visit Madison."}
{"text":"Ha Long Bay is a really cute restaurant with interesting decor. Yes service is slow but they are usually friendly for the most part. I'm not sure why so many restaurants in Madison try to combine Thai and Vietnamese food, just pick one! They do both and they do it pretty well, again this is for Madison standards. I've had their Thai curry here and they do it pretty well, spicy when you ask for it and a good amount. Pho here is great, comes with the usual herbs and bean sprouts. The only thing disappointing I've had is the seafood noodle stir fry but seafood in Madison is usually disappointing so I'm not expecting much. They have a large menu and yes the food is great for Madison standards, food overall is 3 stars but I think the place has a charm to it (as most places do on Willy st) so that pushes it to 4 stars for me."}
{"text":"Too notch food and service. Get HS5. You won't regret it. Be prepared to wait for a table. I only wish they did delivery."}
{"text":"Even when the restaurant is mostly empty - seriously, we're one of only 3 tables - the service is VERY slow. We came early today - 4:30. not recommended unless you've got lots of time to kill. Hostess rude too."}
{"text":"After flying into Milwaukee from Louisville, KY and connecting in Chicago O hare, I drove to Madison on a brisk Monday afternoon. Glad I asked the gate agent to bump me to an earlier flight, so I didn't have to experience traffic on the I-94W and the tedious 3 hour delay if i stuck with my original itinerary. I was craving Pho, after not having any for quite awhile.

After checking Yelp and my bookmarks, I stopped by Ha Long Bay Vietnamese & Thai Bistro to get my Pho on, since it was rated high by the reviews. Located off of the main thoroughfare of East Washington Ave, it took me a good while to locate this place. After mapping it out and finding Williamson Street, I parked on the quiet Jennifer Street and walked on over to the entrance. It was nice to be able to sit down after long drive.

The restaurant itself was nice, but dimly lite. They have restrooms, but assuming for customer use only. The restaurant itself was a smal bistro in the heart of Madison and there was some patrons hanging out and eating when I came in. There was 2 servers nearby and a older lady came over after to take my order. I assumed this place is a mom and pop establishment, so it was good to support local even on vacation.

I ordered my usual when I come to get Pho, which was combination Pho and a side of summer rolls with shrimp. The entire process took about 10 minutes. The bowl of Pho was good and the flavor of the broth was deep and it was delicious. Only problem was that there was not enough noodles that I am accustomed to. Wish I did speak up about this and asked for extra noodle in the beginning, it was my fault for not asking. The summer rolls felt like they were refrigerated and not made on request, which was a bit disappointing. Nevertheless, it was good anyway.

Overall, this place is worth it's weight in yelp stars. My only gripe would've been the portion of noodles, but that can be corrected easily. They do accept cash and credit cards, so that's always a plus. Clean and inviting to take in a meal by yourself or your Pho hungry friends out. I had a nice experience here and hope you do too. While I can say it was good Pho, it can be better.

Support local!

{"text":"If you're looking for some good Southeast Asian food (Vietnamese, Laotian, Thai), Ha Long Bay is as good as it. I recommend their Pho noodle bowls. If you haven't had Pho before, you are missing out in one of the best things in life. These are heaven on a cold winter's night. Piping hot delicious soup, with light and thin rice noodles. Add your choice of meat!

Also, the LS7 (Nem Khao Tod), is a must try! Delicious minced meat seasoned and sitting on lettuce ready to be wrapped and eaten! If you want to try something new for an appetizer, try the AP16 (Thai Spring rolls). These are amazing! Just writing this review makes me want to go visit again. Go try it...Now!"}
{"text":"I love Vietnamese food and Ha Long Bay does not disappoint. I've been there for both lunch and dinner and enjoyed it every time. They serve Vietnamese, Thai, and Laotian cuisine. Get there early or expect to wait. We got there at 11:45 on a weekday. I am not getting when I tell you that people were flocking there. It sits on a corner and people were heading there from every direction and several of them were literally running. 

I've had the pork egg rolls, curry puffs, spring rolls, papaya salad, pho, pad thai, and laab. All of the flavors have been fresh, intense, and delicious. I can't rave enough about the food.

Our servers have always been friendly and happy to provide recommendations.

The only downside is some of the furniture does need to be updated. I've sat in chairs with ripped cushions a couple of times and you really do need to get there early or expect to wait. But go there, it is worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Best Thai food I have had! My son who went to school in Madison just moved to Los Angeles and hasn't found a comparable restaurant there! When he was home for thanks giving he had to drive to Madison for some Ha Long Bay!! Have never been disappointed with any of the food here!!"}
{"text":"The real thing that always stands out about Hay Long Bay is the variety.  One of the places in madison, where you can order everything from thai curries to viatnamese and laosian dishes.  It's good to note that this variety draws crowds and on many nights the place can be a little packed and the service a little slow, so come prepared to enjoy a relaxing, slower meal, and the conversation of your companions (or a good book).  The food has never disappointed me and they always have options for vegtarian, vegan, and kosher diners."}
{"text":"My first impression is the long line of guests.
My second impression is the \"imitation\" crab soup.
That's all!!!
My first big disappointment is the Vietnamese beef stew with egg noodles. It was totally tasteless and sour, I felt like I was eating a Vietnamese beef Ragu dish without potatoes. Moreover, it was colorless. My friend gave up after tasting the soup.
The second big disappointment is the Pad Thai with shrimp and spicy level: hot. It was a big dish, but i thought they brought a dessert to me instead of an entree. It was very sweet, i tasted it without putting anything on it (siracha, soy sauce, hoisin sauce). In addition, there was no smell from the dish. And I gave up. Then, I asked for the checks and togo boxes, in order to remake it at home with hopes that i could make some changes to the beef stew.
At the end of the night, I still paid in full amount of my bill. However, I would like to ask the owner to rethink about the restaurant's award? Is it worthy?
Is the restaurant still living up on it?
I left the note on the table. Hope that they read it."}
{"text":"Judged this place a bit too quickly last time. Though their pho might not be the greatest, their other entrees are great. 

Their generous portioned fried rice dishes are just so flavorful and unique, that I finished the mammoth plate in one sitting. They also have some great curries made to order. I was feeling adventurous, and went with extra hot on everything. My taste buds were definitely challenged by the spiciness, but it was spread out evenly among my dish, making the meal slightly less painful. 

I guess just like with books, you can't really judge a restaurant by your first meal."}
{"text":"Ha Long (do you have to wait for a table?) lives up to the reviews: excellent fare. The wait on our recent visit was in excess of 90 minutes; we were told 20 when we arrived. 

Ask your server if you are overwhelmed by the tantalizing options. Hard to go wrong."}
{"text":"One of the few places on the east side that can pull off questionable service because THE FOOD IS THAT GOOD. Yes, it will take forever to get your order taken, and forget about getting your water refilled. It doesn't matter. This place is 100% worth it."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in Madison! I have celiac disease and it is so hard to find good gluten-free Asian food. At Ha Long Bay, they can make almost anything on their 15-page menu gluten free...and it still tastes delicious! I haven't gotten sick from accidental gluten \"poisoning\" yet haha. Be sure to try the spring rolls, fried rice, and pad thai! You can also get their food as take-out and don't have to be seated in the restaurant."}
{"text":"Ha Long Bay makes the best pad thai ever. I've ordered from/eaten at Ha Long Bay a dozen times, and I want to order chicken pad thai ever single time. In the winter, I got crazy and ordered their squash curry, and it was awesome. But I couldn't stop thinking about the pad thai.

Their service can sometimes be less than average, but their food is so good that I don't even care. It's often hard to call in orders since they're always busy and regularly don't pick up the phone. I'm relentless, though, and will continue calling back over a 15 minute period to try and get someone to take my order.

I have a friend who used to live in Madison, and sometimes I just snap a picture of Ha Long Bay's sign and send it to her, just to drive her bonkers. It works."}
{"text":"I ordered the pad thai with tofu, my go-to meal, and wasn't very impressed. It was fine but I've had better. It seemed like there was a flavor missing and it didn't taste like most pad thais I've had. I also had the crab wontons and those I did like. I'd be willing to go back and try the infamous curry but I wouldn't get pad thai again."}
{"text":"The food and service were excellent! We had to wait 25 minutes for a table, but it was worth the wait! We had fried rice, noodles, and curry. Everything was very good!"}
{"text":"So I wanted to bring my mother to someplace new, saw the high rating, and many reviews that were positive. The place was packed and one person told us there was no way we could make a mistake on the menu. Well... Maybe we are the only 2 crazy people out there or everyone else there was crazy but it was gross!! The crab wontons were chewy and all cream cheese no crab. The seafood pad thai was very fishy. The chicken curry was okay but the chicken was over cooked and dry.

PS. The dogs wouldn't touch the leftoveers."}
{"text":"This is the best restaurant in Madison. Order the Nem Khao Tod (LS9). Crispy rice dish. Expect a wait but worth it. If you come on the weekend also order the Bahn Xeo. Vietnamese crepe with shrimp. Very good."}
{"text":"I got the tofu pad thai and some giant spring rolls (fried on the inside, lettuce/wrap on the outside). The pad thai was the best I've had in years. I ordered it 3 stars out of 4 since I've found they tend to under-spice things. \"Hot\" was just perfect for me.

The location is a bit small and tends to be noisy. I hope they can move to a bigger location (with nearby parking) sometime soon.

I recommend reservations if you've got a group or plan on going during the busy hours."}
{"text":"So an update. It seems HLB is so random with their service. Usually they are spot on, but lately especially last weekend they were so missing, I'm questioning whether or not I want to come back. Sure the curry puffs are amazing....but I know I can make these at home.  

Friday night, we ordered take out. Was told to pick up at 6:30pm. Get there at 6:30pm. Tell them we are picking up food. The hostess proceeds to ignore us for 30-40 minutes while our food is sitting there packed up and ready to go. 

Sunday, ok busy because of graduation...was told 20-25 mins to wait for a 6 top. Ok. The people who arrived after us with a 5 top were seated before us and another party of 6-7 that arrived after us were also seated before us. The guy admitted he screwed up, but no apologies were made. 

Again when ordering 4 stars, I always have to ask for extra peppers...I would expect 4 stars to be really hot, but alas its just not."}
{"text":"I've been dying to go to Ha Long Bay and finally made it! It didn't disappoint! I had the Mc Rang Mui
(Fried squid tossed with salt, pepper, onion; on lettuce) and while I felt it a little heavy handed on the batter - it was good and fresh and tasty! The onions and peppers where delicious and perfectly seasoned.  We started with the chicken satay and fried tofu - both solid appetizers! The peanut sauce was chunky and peanuty which I prefer to the creamy smooth variety.  

Service was incredibly sweet and helpful.  My dining companion was brand new to Vietnamese cuisine and our server was more than happy to help her decide what to go with.  Very clean, comfy, well lit - great place, I'd definitely head back!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite southeast Asian spots in Madison. Specifically, I always order Thai food when I'm there and it never seems to disappoint. I would recommend the Pad Thai, Drunken Noodles and Panang Curry (though the potatoes in the curry was a surprise). 

Level 1-5 spice levels are available-- I thought that the 3 was perfect for someone that can tolerate spice but doesn't care to drink an entire gallon of milk during dinner. 

They are busy, especially on the weekends, but the line is worth the wait and the service is fairly quick!"}
{"text":"Excellent lunch specials for excellent food! Can be a little on the sweet side with some of its dishes (at least for my taste), but all around excellent Vietnamese and Thai food at affordable prices!"}
{"text":"Their menu is a bit overwhelming, but everything we had was very tasty and at reasonable prices, with plenty remaining for leftovers.  We will be back to explore more of this menu!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is okay. Not too loud and simple. 

The food has never impressed me. I've come here many times over the past few years due to friends wanting to try it and it's location. Ha long bay is always super salty. The dishes need salt to make up for lack of flavor. If you want good pho around here, go to Saigon noodles. For food, go to Saigon noodles or Sa Bai Thong, which is a little more Americanized but still great and worth the price. 

I once asked for rice noodles instead of egg and the waitress charged me $2 without letting me know which was annoying. The service isn't great but it's not bad either."}
{"text":"Love love love the squash curry with chicken. Didn't know I liked squash till I tried this. They have awesome crab rangoon/wontons...lots of creamy filling."}
{"text":"My favorite SE Asian in Madison.  Amazing chicken laab (aka larp).  I daydream about that symphony of flavors.  I like three star spiciness.  They also make a mean shrimp pad Thai, and you can't go wrong with any of their curries."}
{"text":"The food here is absolutely fantastic: authentic, great sized portions, well-seasoned, etc etc no food complaints. 
 
BUT the service is NOT fantastic by any means. A dinner for two (we ordered pho and a tofu stir fry) took us over an hour. Took way too long to come take our order and food itself took way too long to come out. 

My suggestion - do takeout. When I do takeout it's ready in about 20 minutes and super delicious... Except once the soup was so hot it melted the plastic open on my way home!!"}
{"text":"My friend and I had lunch here. It was our impromptu backup plan because the restaurant we wanted to go to wasn't open. I'm glad we did go, the food was very good. I ordered pad-thai which tasted good-not the best, but on the better-than-average level. My friend's daughter had pho. My stereotype that pho can only be made in solely pho restaurants has been broken. The broth was pretty good. 
My friend ordered beef (shredded) laab and the papaya salad. She, being an aficionado for those two dishes, gave them 2 thumbs up. I thought the roasted rice powder used in the laab was a bit coarse, but other than that, it was very good. They're version of hot spicy wasn't hot enough for us. I'd definitely recommend this restaurant for its variety of Thai, Vietnamese & Laotian foods."}
{"text":"The whole package! Affordable, great environment, fast and friendly service, and a wide range of Vietnamese, Laotian, and Thai cuisine!

Superstars: Veggie curry puffs, pan fried dumplings, chicken satay, and fresh spring rolls to start! Mi, Pho are 2 superstar noodle dishes in hot broth that come with über fresh veggies. Squash curry is heaven."}
{"text":"Recently moved to Monona which, outside of average crappy Chinese that does in a pinch, has little to offer restaurant-wise save for chains.  We LOVE Thai and Vietnamese, but it's usually more pricy than cheap Chinese delivery.  Then we found Ha Long Bay.  Outstanding food, tried several dishes and it's always fantastic, plentiful and inexpensive.  My favorites so far:  Drunken Noodle, Squash Curry, Crab Rangoon, Fresh Veggie Thai Spring Rolls, and my 12 year old loves their Pad Thai.  If you dine in, plan on a wait.  Every time I've gone, including last Sunday at 8pm, it's at least a 30 minute wait for a table.  And I'm glad for them.  But I usually do take-out.  Any way you go, just go.  Seriously good stuff."}
{"text":"Since I wrote my old review I have eaten here many many times and while it is probably still my fave lao/viet/thai place in Madison the quality seems to have really dropped off substantially.

The dumplings still taste good but often they are haphazardly assembled wads of dough and meat.  The Pad Thai is a huge gamble, one time it is is sweet and not hot at all with four stars, the next time it is super greasy and not hot, the third time it is dry flavorless noodles CRUSTED in pepper seeds, completely indelibly hot.  And I grow my own chilies, I love hot food.  That has happened several times now.

It seems to have really gotten busy (though the last few months less so) with there often being four people running the front desk and it still takes a while to get their attention.  I think they have had trouble dealing with the success of the restaurant and keeping the same level of quality up.  I wish I could figure out what day the good cooks work and only order from them then."}
{"text":"I came here on a Thursday at 6pm thinking that it wouldn't be crowded but boy was I wrong! I arrived a little earlier and put my name is and was estimated a wait for 50 minutes! My friend came to meet up with me and we struggled with waiting, bearing our hunger, or going to another restaurant.I am so happy we decided to wait because this place is GOOOOD. Here's what me and my friend got the share that was MORE than enough and still had leftovers.

Tom Yum Goong: A little more mushrooms that I expected to have in tom yum, but the overall flavor of the soup was just the right sour and tang
Pad See Ew: noodles were cooked to perfection and the flavor was on point. we got it with pork and it was great!
Squash Curry: While I am more of a chicken curry kind of girl, this hit the spot. It's in a red curry base and the squash is VERY flavorful and cooked just right. 

Overall, I completely understand why this place has a wait and I will definitely be back for more as i'm pretty sure its the best Asian restaurant in town."}
{"text":"I had a disappointing experience, given the long wait times and good reviews. Some of the food was good but it was mostly mediocre, but it could be hit or miss due to their large menu. We came with a group of 6 on a Friday night, and it was super packed. The wait would have been 45 minutes to an hour if we didn't have a reservation. We requested to have our items served family style, so I got to try out several different things: 

-Chicken satay appetizer - a good starter. I could (and have) straight up eat the sauce by itself (I think its hoisin sauce with peanuts). It comes with a refreshing cucumber salad as well.
-Squash curry - Flavorful, the squash made it a more unique dish, and you can never really go wrong with thai curry. 
-Pad see ew with beef - pretty standard, ok dish. Came with broccoli and carrots which made it seem chinese takeout-y. Beef was dry.
-Xao thom (sweet pineapple and ginger sauce) with battered fish (HS2)- Pretty tasty. I really enjoyed the crispy fish batter combined with the sweetness of the pineapple sauce. 
-stir fried large rice noodles with pork (Hu Tie Xao Kho-HK1) - same noodles as pad see ew, but the noodles had really yummy crispy edges from the frying. Pork was dry though, and sauce was pretty generic. 

The overall impression is that nothing was very memorable,and the meat across the board was too dry and thinly sliced. I wouldn't wait 45 minutes and then deal with slow service for this, but maybe if you stick to the curry or noodle dishes you might have better luck. However, I do see myself coming back occasionally during non-rush hours and trying their other items."}
{"text":"I have never had a bad meal here.  Prices are awesome and the food is absolutely amazing.  Their Pho is orgasmic!!!"}
{"text":"This palce is awesome. Nice atmosphere.  It has jsut a huge menu and i had great experenice every time.  IT's GOOD!!!!! @_@"}
{"text":"This place was pretty good, but I can't seem to give it the five stars that you would think it deserves given the packed waiting area on a Friday night. I lived in San Francisco for nine years, so I was privileged enough to eat some of the best Asian food in the country for that long. Madison's Asian food scene is decent, but nothing has really wowed me like the food in San Francisco does. My boyfriend and I had three tofu dishes: the Hot and Spicy Lemongrass, the Chef's Special (with lemongrass and kaffir lime leaf), and the Crispy noodles with tofu. They were all very good and definitely hit the spot, but all three dishes had the same vegetables. It was like we ordered three different forms of the same meal. Delicious and great for vegetarians or vegans looking to satisfy their Vietnamese food cravings, but not the best I've had. Also, they do not have brown rice, which I always see as a downer. Last thing--the iced green tea was refreshing, but had very little flavor. You can make that at home."}
{"text":"We were sat right away and our waiter took our orders quickly.  We decided to try a few different things.  We started off with the chicken dumpling, spring rolls and vegetable soup.  The dumplings must have been handmade they held together really well and the filling was well seasoned and moist chicken meat (YUM).  Spring Rolls were good but the vegetable soup was amazing!  I loved the broth.  I love soup but I am still thinking about this soup the next day.   We finished out meal with Pad See Ew and it also really delicious too.  The noodles seem to be homemade and lot of chicken and broccoli.  We will for sure be back!"}
{"text":"Her: Ha Long Bay for dinner?
Me: Sure. The usual.
Her: OK. *calls restaurant* Can I order for pick up: MD1 with chicken and TR3 with beef, both medium spicy.

I am not kidding when I say that for the first 6 months since we started eating here, it was almost a weekly tradition. The MD1 is the egg noodles deep fried topped with suateed broccoli, bok choy, baby corn, peapod, bell pepper, mushroom, and onion. The sauce is incredible and the noodles are crispy and delicious. The TR3 is my fiancee's favorite; Red curry fried rice with red curry paste, basil, mushroom, bamboo, peapod, and egg. She tries to save leftovers but usually will get up later at night to eat the rest. Occasionally, we'll order some egg rolls or spring rolls which are also always tasty.

Service is good. It's busy there so we typically call for pick-up and it's ready in 30 min. Besides, you stay in there long enough and you end up smelling like the food. It's not bad, but might not be ideal for most folks."}
{"text":"The food was delicious but the wait (to get your food after you order) is ridiculously long.  I think if I get food from here again in the future, I would get take-out instead or else bring a book.  It's also nice that they have a lot of dishes to choose from.  I got the yellow curry and loved it.  Portions were large and I had enough for lunch the next day too."}
{"text":"This is one of our go-to places for takeout -- the lemongrass beef bun is delicious, and the pho is great, too. The menu is a little overwhelming if you don't know what you're looking for, but I haven't had anything bad from there. The one criticism I'd have is that, the one time my husband and I actually ate in the restaurant, the service was a little on the pokey side. But, it's a great place if you're looking for Vietnamese food."}
{"text":"Food was good and service was great today. 

Their version of crab rangoon (yes, I know it isn't authentic, but it tastes good) is done well and I like the sweet sauce they serve on the side. I added a little of their chili paste to give it a kick.

I ordered B3, Bun Tom Nuong (grilled shrimp vermicelli noodle). The greens and carrots were really fresh, exactly as I like them, and not soggy. The grilled shrimp were great and I appreciated that I didn't have to remove the ends of the tails myself as I do in most restaurants, especially when the shrimp are covered in sauce (so messy). Shrimp arrived ready to eat! 

I was a little surprised they wanted us to order by number, but I guess it confirms the order is right."}
{"text":"My husband and I consistently enjoy the pho, the squash curry (with tofu), chicken sa-tay (especially because of the peanut sauce), and the beef laab. When ordering the pho with the rare beef, ask them to bring the rare meat on the side and then put it in the soup to cook. Trust us. It'll cook in the hot broth and will still be tender."}
{"text":"My favorite Thai food restaurant in Madison. It can get quite busy so it helps to go there at off times. The Tom yum chicken soup is amazing, as is the Pho. I've also enjoyed the pad Thai and some of the curries (the exception is the squash curry which was average). I'll be so excited when it reopens!"}
{"text":"This place was actually pretty good. It's not that big so it was kind of crowded. I loved the chicken dumplings!! It was sooooo good! I would definitely go again for the dumplings. I also had the pad Thai, which was really sweet. I don't like my pad Thai too sweet, but overall, it was good! 
And the prices aren't bad!! Give it a try!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my experience here! The wait to be seated was a tad long, but well worth it! The atmosphere is on the louder and more crowded side. The staff members are very friendly and knowledgeable. If you have questions about the food, they take the time to explain the options and make personal recommendations. I would recommend the chicken dumplings to start, then the Pineapple Ginger Chicken over rice or the Thai peanut chicken over rice. I don't think you could go wrong with anything on their menu! The food quality, quantity, and prices are excellent! I will definitely go back! What are you waiting for?! Oh, a table!"}
{"text":"My primary place to go to Vietnamese food on the east side. 

Ha Long Bay provides broader selections than Saigon Noodles and Pho Nam on the west side, as it has many entree dishes, while other places specialize in noodles and rice dishes. For the Vietnamese entree, ginger chicken is one of my favorite. Personally, I almost always stick to the entrees in Ha Long Bay and go to Saigon noodle for their lovely pho. 

Beyond its VT offerings, Ha Long Bay has a big menu that also blends in Thai and Laotian dishes. Thai curry plates are as good as any other Thai restaurant in Madison. 

It always gets busy in dinner time. Make reservation if you can. 

Overall, the quality of food is very good, and consistent. A very well-rounded restaurant. Service has been satisfying. The only minor quibble is that the menu is so large, and many items are in its original languages. While I truly appreciate the authenticity associated with it, it could difficult for the first-timers to order, and even more difficult to remember what I just ate. 

I highly recommend Ha Long Bay."}
{"text":"Best of many very good SE Asian places in Madison."}
{"text":"The more I try from the menu, the more I'm disappointed. Also, why the heck is the menu so big? Gordon Ramsay would not approve.

While I stand by their pho, I haven't had anything else that I'd recommend. The food here is like slightly upscale Asian cuisine. The menu is trying to please too many people, and really should be more focused.

I have ordered the pho probably a dozen times (usually the chicken) and it's always been good. A good simple dish, and a generous portion. But the last several meals I have tried (snapper in some sort of ginger sauce, lemongrass chicken) were seriously lacking and reminded me of cheap Chinese food. And that plate of snapper was around $20, which seemed like a poor value. A beef curry was also underwhelming, but not terrible. All of the sauces taste heavily of salad dressing or corn syrup.

The restaurant space is fairly cramped and extremely loud, so much so that I had to yell my order to the waitress. Conversation is difficult if you plan on dining in.

Service is usually good, with polite and attentive staff. They have a small but decent selection of bottled beer, and a few decent wines.

Overall this is just an okay place, and I've only enjoyed the pho."}
{"text":"Ha Long Bay is a popular pan Asian restaurant that offers the standard vegetarian fare: replace meat with tofu! This place was packed until close on a Sunday night, and my friends and I ended up waiting about thirty minutes for a table to open up. There's not really an area to wait inside, so we walked around the area, which felt a bit dilapidated, but also hipster. A man begging for money was harassing patrons waiting outside the restaurant, which was a sad sight.

I ordered the vegetarian pot stickers for the table and tofu pad thai for myself. I asked for the pad thai to be hot. The vegetarian pot stickers were very average: they were definitely the kind that were probably frozen and then dumped into a fryer. They were more eggroll than they were pot stickers. The pad thai itself was good. The tofu absorbed flavor well, and the egg was quite nice. The pad thai needed another vegetable or something, though: if you look at the photo,  you can see that it looks like a mushy blob of noodles, which it started to taste like toward the end of the meal. Don't get me wrong: the pad thai tasted good. But how many same-texture, same-consistency bites can a person eat before hoping for something different?

I'd return if I were in Madison looking for Asian food. I think I would order something more adventurous than the pad thai - I'm usually at least a pad kee mao kind of guy."}
{"text":"My rating is based only on the Vietnamese part of the menu, as I'm hooked on it and haven't gone further. The pho is perfect, little explosions of different tastes in each spoonful of broth. The spring rolls are so, so, so fresh and fantastic. I think the lemonade is fresh-made. Just the right amount of tart-sweet. I've never had anything but impeccable service here. I like sitting at a window table and watching Willy Street go by through the filmy green curtains. I'd eat here every day, but don't want to risk getting bored..."}
{"text":"Good food and friendly service. Went for lunch with a couple of other people and everyone really enjoyed their meals. They had a nice sized lunch menu for about $8-$10 per plate which came with cucumber salad, an eggroll, or the option to get a spring roll for $1 more. Everyone in my group got the spring roll- delicious! I had the pho which was flavorful but too spicy for my tastes. I am not very sensitive to spice but ordered a level two (one being mildest and four being \"local Lao\") and it was VERY spicy towards the bottoms of my bowl. I think they may have anciently put extra spice because the two other dishes we had at the table were ordered to have the same level of spice but were much milder. I tried a couple bites of both the cashew chicken and mango curry, both of which were very tasty. We finished with warm sticky rice and mango. Overall, very enjoyable lunch. Will return."}
{"text":"Dropped in by myself and was luckily able to get a table early Thursday. This place packs up quickly and there is little space to wait. When I left it was packed. Last time I tried to visit the wait was too long so I was happy to have scored a table.

The establishment is nice but the acoustics are a bit rough. Pretty noisy. It was jarring enough that I even checked on my phone and it was hitting 90 dB. Which is not necessarily a bad thing but something to note depending on the dinner and the company.

Now onto the most important part, the food. I saw that the Nem khao tod was popular on Yelp so I ordered it. Interesting. Crispiness was unique. A bit too many nuts. I ordered it medium spicy/hot and I would recommend much spicier. The dish itself came out a bit lukewarm to cool. Never had it before so I don't know if that's intended but I would have liked it much warmer.

For dessert, I ordered the sesame balls. Yum! Bite sized which was unique.

The service was good. Warm but felt a bit rushed. But for as busy as they got, they kept up.

Finally, the restaurant is on Willie so parking is a bit challenging as well."}
{"text":"Chef's Matter...  Really they do!

Today I learned that who is behind the Wok makes all the difference in the world.  If this had been my first visit to Ha Long Bay, I may not have returned.  Which is really sad, because the food has always been outstanding, at least until today.  

As a vegetarian I was blown away by the complex flavors that were present in my first dish of Ha Long Bay's Stir fried vegetables.  It wasn't until after much research that I discovered that the flavors that I was experiencing were not achieved from a specific ingredient, but rather a cooking technique known as \"Wok Hei\" which involves cooking fresh ingredients, in a well seasoned Wok over extreme heat.   But it is so much more than just cooking over a high heat.  Creating Wok Hei is so tricky to get right that often it is used as a measure of a Chinese chef's skill, and these chefs often spend years trying to perfect the art.  Which is why when I was asked how everything was, I explained how very different this meal had been from all the others I have had there.  It was very disheartening.  So much so, I actually had to resort to using soy sauce to add some kind of flavor to my meal.  Something I had never needed to do on previous visits.

As I explained how things were different, I also asked if there was someone else cooking tonight?  To which the waitress replied \"Yes\"  she went on to tell us that the regular chef Tom, was not cooking tonight... That the person usually in charge of preparing the appetizers was cooking... Which may also explain why the appetizers that we had ordered were severely over cooked... Who was making the appetizers while she was doing the main cooking??   

I sincerely hope that Chef Tom is Ok... That it was just his night off, or perhaps he is on Vacation... If he is out sick, I wish him a speedy recovery not only for his sake, but for the sake of the restaurant as well.  

Please, please, please let it be something as simple as that... God forbid anything worse, or that he has left the restaurant...

You see, Chef's Really Do Matter.  For without them, you really are just another flavorless Fast Food Chinese Restaurant, lost in a sea of mediocrity that isn't worth it's weight in soy sauce."}
{"text":"The food is amazing and the menu is very bug with Thai, Vietnamese and Laotian food. The wait times can be a bit crazy though and they won't text you when your table is ready. Be prepared to go have a drink across the street at Gib's while you wait."}
{"text":"I was disappointed with the great reviews from other people.

I ordered Pho, Vietnamese Springrolls and Eggrolls.  The broth for the Pho was very salty, the eggrolls were burnt and looked old (as if been previously refrigerated), and the springrolls had way too much vegetables and very little noodles and a small hint of meat and shrimp.

I was clearly disappointed.  I will not go back here.

Two stars for friendly service and clean restaurant."}
{"text":"Halong Bay....I love you. 
Tom Kha is so tasty and consistently delicious. 
Pan fried dumplings...SO GOOD.
Pad thai. YUM.
That cucumber salad. I dream about its sweet and tangy goodness.
One of my favorite places in Madison. 
When dining in, expect to be there awhile. Service, while friendly,  tends to be a the slow side.  But that will never stop me from coming back."}
{"text":"Ha Long Bay is probably my favorite pho place in Madison. Expect a wait because it gets busy during dinner time.
I've been here multiple times and both times I had no issues with the service. I liked what I got so much the first time that I got it again the next when I took my dad here. (He's a phoaholic like me, so I had to introduce him)

I got the Pho Tai, and the combination fried rice. Both were hugely portioned and extremely tasty. The pho is flavored traditionally, it's not too sweet, it has a pretty good balance of sweet to savory to spice. It's not my favorite pho, but only one bowl can hold that spot. One thing to point out is that the sliced beef has a ton of flavor, I'm not sure how, but it's way better than any other Tai I've had.
The rice has a good flavor, it's slightly smoky, and has a fair portion of meat scattered about. 

One thing I didn't order twice was the ice coffee, it just didn't live up to my expectations. 

I'll definitely be back again."}
{"text":"The food is top notch....they pretty much never disappoint there.  This is my favorite place to get a cup of Ginger tea, too - for about $2.00 they bring you out a huge pot that I always struggle to finish (that never stops me from trying, though).  The service is the only reason for my '3 star' review - it's hit and miss.  We have had absolutely lovely service, okay service, and downright horrible.  The last time we were in there, we stood up front for about 15 minutes before anyone even acknowledged we existed - and there were THREE waitresses standing right in front of us.  They seemed to be debating something, never made eye contact - I almost walked out but wanted my tea so, so bad!  and then once the woman looked up and decided to seat us, she was nice as pie.  My annoyance with her slowly melted away once I was able to eat (I'm sure I was partially 'hangry').  A bad service night or two hasn't kept us away though - we truly love this place!"}
{"text":"I'm lowering my initial rating. The pho is still pretty darn good, but the Thai wasn't so great. 

It wasn't even Thai! I decided to try my favorite dish at another place: Basil Chicken. I was extremely disappointed. It had so much filler that it seems like a Chinese fried rice. It barely resembled what I thought I was ordering. Now,
if I thought I was ordering a Chinese fried rice, it would be the best Chinese fried rice I've ever had. 

We also orders a Panang Curry...too much filler and not enough spice. 

I'd go back for Vietnamese, but never for Thai."}
{"text":"Fabulous restaurant with so many flavorful menu options.  The squash curry, pho, and blueberry rangoons are a few of my person favorites.  The atmosphere is charming and clean.  The only downside would be the wait time if you venture in during peak hours.  It can be up to an hour or more.  Worth a visit if you haven't been!"}
{"text":"The food here is awesome and it is so reasonably priced! The portions are huge. I've never eaten here and not had left overs. My fiance and I usually get the mango curry with tofu and the pad thai with chicken and split them. The pad thai isn't like typical pad thai in that it's not heavy on the peanuts, but I like it. Last time we went, it was just the two of us and we didn't get anything to drink (just water) and the bill was about $18. Seriously, the prices are amazing. They have a HUGE menu -- it's actually a bit overwhelming, but should suit everyone's taste. Definitely try the appetizers. I've had all the various rolls, and they'll all good and of course, large portions.

The service is a bit slow, especially during peak dinner time. But, when the food comes out, it's always so hot and fresh so I never feel bad about waiting because I know the food quality is great."}
{"text":"Great Thai food, good environment. It gets very crowded and hard to get into, but otherwise worth the wait."}
{"text":"This place is one of my favorite places in Madison. The food has always been wonderful.  They have an extensive menu so there are lots of options. The staff is always polite and the prices are reasonable. Unfortunately, the place gets extremely busy some nights. Good for them, people love them. However, there is no waiting area, so if you are not into waiting uncomfortably close to people who are already seated, or standing outside, then you'll end up having to find a different place for dinner."}
{"text":"Ha Long Bay is my favorite restaurant in Madison!  The only negative is deciding which dish to order since they have so many good ones.  A few highlights:
- Squash Curry is to die for.  It's hearty and flavorful.  A visiting friend described it as \"Thai comfort food.\"
- Shrimp Summer Rolls.  These are a fresh and delicious appetizer. 
- Chicken Dumplings. You can tell these are homemade and not frozen dumplings like a lot fo restaurants. You can get them steamed or fried. Yum!
- Pho.  I personally like the shrimp pho since I don't eat a ton of red meat.
- If you're looking for a noodle dish, the Pad Thai and Pad See Eiw are also good bets.  The serving is very generous so you'll go home with leftovers.

The line is usually out the door on weekends so expect a wait if you're going on a Thursday, Friday, or Saturday evening."}
{"text":"Simply excellent. I had the medium chicken pad Thai and it was great. My wife had a chicken dish with peanut sauce that was fantastic. We also got pork spring rolls, which were huge, and fried chicken wantons which were pretty good. Service was excellent. This place is definitely on the top of our list for Thai food now."}
{"text":"Food was tasty. Menu is very extensive, not sure they can master so many tastes. Had the panang chicken. Sauce was great, good spice but the chicken was rubbery. Place is very loud even for the early dinner hour about 5:30. Seating is just okay. Avoid the booths, you will get bounced around by the university drinkers behind you. Not a place for kids. Can't even have normal level voices for dinner conversation, just too loud. Cost is not bad and overall might try it again for lunch without the family."}
{"text":"Good food & a nice choice of Vietnamese dishes it's nice to see a place in Madison with something other than Pho and a few stir fry dishes. The service can be a bit slow which is annoying but the food is worth the wait. If everyone stays away from here it will make my wait shorter - yea!"}
{"text":"Great pho! Cold green tea was rather flavor-less. Cool atmosphere. Would definitely return."}
{"text":"Amazing is the word. Loved their tom yum soup. Very economical. Their crispy noodles are awesome. That mango sweet rice desert is a killer. Only problem is waiting time and they don't take reservations. But, i always feel i can do that for the no.1 quality of food they provide"}
{"text":"Best pho I can find in Madison. Also delicious Thai food as well. Penang curry is one of my faves."}
{"text":"Food and selection is best for southeast Asian cuisine. I would the Pho isn't as good as other places in town, but the bun, stir-fry noodles, and curries are great. Prices are very reasonable. I would frequent the place more if service wasn't so slow! It's much more convenient on the weekends."}
{"text":"For my 2nd visit, I ordered the sour sausage with crispy rice. Their dishes are so mufti-dimensional, fun and delicious. I am looking forward to trying more items on their menu. 

Once again, it took a long time to get a table, and table service was slow. I would have ordered several more drinks but the waitress never came around after the food was delivered. We didn't see her again until we were done with our meal."}
{"text":"My wife is a HUGE fan of Ha Long Bay while I've only tried it once. I took the recommendation on the website and ordered LS7 (heat level 3) and it was so good. I now have a new craving. We ordered our food for takeout and was still delicious after a 20 minute car ride! The reviews are very helpful, thank you!"}
{"text":"Nice food and nice ambience! Great place for vegetarians with many options to order from! Staff is friendly! Green curry is really nice!"}
{"text":"Wait times more than double what they tell you, in addition the hostess seated 3 groups who checked in after us before I noticed and asked.  We were seated immediately.

Wait staff was slow and inattentive.  They were busy but not an excuse for this bad.

Food was good but the service ruined the experience.  Won't be back."}
{"text":"This place is pretty poppin, quite busy on a Friday night.

I've gotten the Squash Curry with chicken. It's amazing, I super recommend it.

The Pad Thai is pretty solid, and the portion size is ridiculously huge."}
{"text":"wow..  great food! 
There was no parking for the customers we parked 3 blocks down and walked into a crowded eatery..   the wait was 30 mins but the food smelled and looked amazing..   when we finally sat down I was handed a huge menu full of mouth watering options..  
the soups were great...  both my co worker and I ate ever drop of our soups..  then it was time for our main food came it was hot and made to perfection.  i ordered the fried wide noodles, and my coworker ordered the crispy rice with chicken and sausage.     

a note to any one that likes spicy... order hotter than you think u like..   their 5 is like a 3 in most parts of the country.."}
{"text":"We came in close to closing, so we werent able to eat in the dining area, but the staff were so super friendly. We chatted with them at the bar while we were waiting for our food to be made. The ambiance was very relaxing, and the food was really good. Totally recommend."}
{"text":"It's hard to find Pho that can make a meal. You can find it here. Not only that it's really good. Service was friendly and fast."}
{"text":"Wow... So close to giving them a five star rating but the service was average at best.

However, the food was excellent.

We started with the ginger tea.  It was spicy with a strong ginger flavor.  I personally wish it was a little less sweet but can't complain.

We moved on to the dumplings which were excellent, lots of flavor, we put a little extra hot pepper sauce on top for added kick.

The next course was the Thai soup with tofu.  We got it hot (3 of 4) and it came as advertised with lots of flavor.

Finally, we had the lemongrass entree with shrimp.  It was spicy, flavorful, with six nice sized quality shrimp.  I would have liked a little less gravy on it, but really a fine dish.

I wish Milwaukee had an equal to this place, I'd be there all the time."}
{"text":"Service is terrible. Dining area is less than sub-par in cleanliness.  Come maybe for appetizers.. but even then, expect to wait.  Between food on the floor to our waitress that didn't seem to care about anything until she came with the bill... I'd say, if you can opt for some where else to go - than do so."}
{"text":"I went there last night, I'm still full. The menu is more like a tome; I'd suggest coming here with a dish already in mind, I flailed in the spider web of options for a little too long. After much deliberation and a popular vote, I got the pad see ew. 'Twas delightfully delicious. Nice sauce selection on the tables, as well!

I withheld that precious fifth star because Ha Long Bay closed at 9:30PM which is just about when the good conversation starts, service was slow, and there was a longer wait than expected to sit down, but hey, at least you can have a beer while you wait!"}
{"text":"I would give this place five stars for food in an instant, but the service is simply too slow and inconsistent, and I want people to trust my reviews. When I come here with friends, we settle in and know it will be a while, and enjoy each other's company. We build in 20 to 30 minutes of wait time, knowing we will have great food, and do not worry if it takes a while.  It's worth it."}
{"text":"Excellently prepared and great service! 
I love how they have such a varied menu. I also love how they have plenty of vegetarian options, none of which suffer in quality. I especially like the Green Curry, and their pho dishes."}
{"text":"Great food and a huge menu to choose from. I recommend ordering pretty spicy though. My sister ordered little spice and with a request like that the food came out a little bland.

I'm a huge fan of their shrimp spring rolls- 2 giant rolls to share!

However, the restaurant ambiance is very loud. Not a good place to take a big group because it is hard to hear others."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in all of Madison! Every time I try a new thai restaurant I always compare it to Ha Long Bay and they always pale in comparison. Pad Lao is my absolute favorite dish so much so I haven't tried much else on the menu. If you have your heart set on going either arrive early or don't arrive starving- you'll probably end up waiting for at least a bit. Awesome atmosphere, service, and most importantly, food!"}
{"text":"Have never been disappointed here! Between panang curry, pad Thai, and the curry puffs I have had great meals here."}
{"text":"Went there for the first time laste week. My boyfriend and I were both very impressed by the service (very helpful ordering when we didn't know what to try), atmosphere, prices and portions. 

Our 1 noodle dish was easily enough to serve both of us and the steamed veggie dumplings were top notch.

Definitely going back!"}
{"text":"Oh Ha Long Bay, so fresh, so delicious!

We took my mom here to experience Willy Street and one of it's gems of a restaurant. Since it was her first time we ordered the steamed dumplings as an appetizer, and part of me wishes that we just ordered 10 of those. They were that good!

 Our entrees were delicious as well, but I can't help but feel that the menu is overwhelming and hurts the experience. With so many options and vague descriptions I had a hard time distinguishing items from each other and ended up almost closing my eyes and picking one.

That being said, you have to try Ha Long Bay at least once and with such a large menu there is always something new to try."}
{"text":"'Twas a madhouse the night we ventured over to Ha Long Bay, but the wait wasn't painstakingly long (30 mins) due to how surprisingly large this restaurant is. Once seated we looked through the menu, which is honestly a novel and quite overwhelming. My eyes caught my staple of sweet and sour chicken and jumped at it. Wish I had explored something different, as my meal tasted much like that of something I've had before, but that's my fault. 

For an appetizer we ordered the Chicken Sa-Tay which comes with a small and delicious side cucumber salad, and an even more delicious peanut sauce that I think I could just guzzle for days. The chicken was also perfectly grilled.

Boyfriend purchased the Pra Ram Long Song, with chicken, which was also topped, lathered and drenched with the peanut sauce. It was SO. GOOD. I may have accidentally ate all of his leftovers.

Service was alright. Very friendly and not overly attentive, but it was, as I've said, super busy and in all actuality I'm glad things went slow. I had the chance to actually \"taste\" and contemplate my appetizer and meal(s). 

With such an extensive menu, I'll do some exploring, and I'll definitely return."}
{"text":"Was meant to go the Grandpa's pizza last night, but it's fairly full, so went to this place instead. What I can say, sooooooo happy that I tried out this place! We ordered the Thai noodle soup and a hot whole fried red snapper, wow it's really delicious! (But people be careful it has a little bit bones) I've only had fried whole fish at Heritage before and it was super expensive, and good. This is the second time in Madison, and it's only 28 dollars!( depends on how heavy the fish is) overall, price is good, taste is good. I just wish they decorate the restaurant better lol"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants in madison. They have wonderful food and generous portions. Their menu is full of wonderful choices. My personal favorite is their Drunken Noodles or their Pho. Every time I have been there, their employees have given helpful recommendations and have been very helpful."}
{"text":"Every time I'm back at Madison, I crave Ha Long Bay. The food is good, especially their curry dishes. However, the wait times can get to be very long, I often wait for an hour or more. Additionally, the service can be slow and the atmosphere is a bit cramped due to how busy they get. But the food keeps me coming back for more. I think that it would be even better if they get the opportunity to expand to accomodate for the high volume of customers."}
{"text":"I had heard Ha Long Bay was delicious, and it was! 

I had the Pad Thai and Mango Curry, both were fantastic. I would recommend getting there early to avoid a wait. But, if you have the wait, don't worry, it will be worth it. 

They were able to accommodate our larger group with a reservation. 

The staff were friendly and helpful, they even brought us extra plates and forks to celebrate a friends B'day with a cake we were able to bring in. 

The spice level is accurate. They give you a scale on 1-5. 5 is actually hot and 1 is not."}
{"text":"I don't think I have ever been to a restaurant with a bigger menu. It's basically a book.

On the plus side, there is so much variety that everyone can get something they love. They have really great Thai iced tea + Thai iced tea here."}
{"text":"The food is to die for, wait staff are well knowledgeable of the menu items and helped me pick out a meal that i more than enjoyed."}
{"text":"Really good food. A touch pricey for the amount you get but the lunch specials looked like a great deal. We were just a few minutes late so we had to get normal portions. Also always go hotter then you think you should if you like spice."}
{"text":"Ha Long Bay is my go to lunch location on Willy Street. It is very affordable at lunch time, and they have great lunch specials which include either a cucumber salad or soup along with the entree.

My favorite lunch choices include the pad Thai, pad see ewe and squash curry. Although I have worked my way through almost the whole menu! They offer varying levels of spiciness and have some hot sauce on the table as well. 

The reason I am docking a star is because it can get very crowded at dinner time and service can often be slow. However at lunch, Ha long bay is the perfect delicious affordable spot."}
{"text":"The outside of this restaurant doesn't look like much, but the inside is much larger.  The service was friendly and fast.  The prices are very affordable and the food is too notch.  

My wife and I travel all over the U.S. eating at different Thai restaurants, this one is at the top of our long list:-)"}
{"text":"There's a reason this place is consistently busy and packed. This is the best Laotian & Vietnamese cuisine in town. I haven't found a dish I didn't like and my fiancé and I love getting take out. The tofu option is great for any dish and the spring rolls are refreshing. Not to mention the blueberry ragoons--amazing."}
{"text":"Ha Long Bay is consistently my go-to restaurant when I am sick, or tired, or hungry. The food is always flavorful, the ginger tea is soothing, and I always leave happy and full. The location is frequently busy, and loud, and parking can be a challenge, but it's worth it."}
{"text":"I ordered the fresh spring rolls with shrimp as an appetizer and Bun - Shrimp with egg roll.  Everything was delicious. I went on a Sunday evening and I was told a 45 minute wait, but was seated in less than 15 minutes. The place was crowded with a long line of take out orders. I will be back the next time I am in Madison"}
{"text":"We have been to HLB 3 or 4 times, each time trying something different on the menu. We have yet to be disappointed! The menu is huge and has something for everyone, whether you are an adventurous foodie or someone who sticks to the basics. We usually have to wait for a table because it's always packed, but it is well worth the wait!"}
{"text":"The lunch specials are a steal. Big portions, served with wonderful soup or tasty cucumber salad, all around $7 or so. The atmosphere is colorful and inviting. But the five star rating really goes to the staff!! We've had nothing but incredible service, every trip. We walked in last week with a crying three year old and fussy baby... we are so used to service industry folks being annoyed when children aren't perfect, so we were pleasantly surprised when the host popped out from around the desk with a huge smile, and said \"Oh no! Are you hungry? Let's get you guys some good food!\" He sat us right away, brought over high chair & booster without even asking, and all the staff took great care of us. We loved our entire experience!"}
{"text":"Really great spot.  Occasionally service is a bit off but the ship rights itself before it totally puts you off in the long run.  Food is always excellent and their pho is perfect for warming up on a wintery night."}
{"text":"I used to come here all the time for their chicken wings. Yummy yummy. Service is pretty awesome too. It's very casual, it's a good place for my group of friends to eat together."}
{"text":"My friends and I are obsessed with the Red Curry Fried Rice. Service is slow, but this restaurant is 100% worth the wait. Great restaurant for dining in or take out. I would rank Ha Long Bay amongst my favorite restaurants in Madison."}
{"text":"Extensive menu! Loved the options! The food was excellent and the place becomes packed fairly quickly. The owner showed us the variety of artwork and how to tell which country each piece was from. Excellent spot!"}
{"text":"Oh, goodness. I came here once with friends, and I have mentioned it many a time since! Ha Long Bay has the menu the size of a small book. Don't worry. Everything they cook is amazing!

My friend had drunken noodles, and she loved it. I had mango curry (medium spice). I was saving my leftovers for as long as possible to enjoy them. And oh, you'll have leftovers! The portion sizes are HUGE for the price. 

Only complaint is the place fogs up during dinner, and our eyes were burning by the end of our meal. The price of authenticity I suppose!

Great deal. Great food. I'd consider driving the hour plus to come back."}
{"text":"I love the food here. It's always busy even for takeout. My favorites are the Thai soups, and Pho."}
{"text":"I give it 4 stars because I would return over and over again, I just don't know how they compare to other similar places.  I've eaten here twice now and both dishes were memorable and delicious.  Totally reminded me of my trip to Thailand with all the authentic tasting flavors.  This past Sunday I had the squash curry with rice.  I couldn't get enough and for only like $11, going home with leftovers makes me so happy!! The one down side to me however, is how HUGE the menu is.  For someone who appreciates a smaller menu, I am completely overwhelmed.  I'm sure some people do like all the options though.  The place also does get a bit loud - it was jam packed with people and we waited for our table for about 15-20 minutes on Sunday around 1:30pm.  Can't wait until I return to try another dish!"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised to see vermicelli noodles w/o broth on their menu! It was excellent quality at an excellent price. Currently, this is my vote for best asian restaurant in Madison!

I will absolutely be back to try the other menu options, most likely the Thai cuisine!"}
{"text":"OMG I love this place. It's in my neighborhood and easy to walk to. But even if you have to charter a jet it's worth it to stop by. I like a crowded restaurant and this one is always full. It's got a pretty traditional Vietnamese and Thai menu, but the recipes all seem to be one quality step up from what most places serve. In particular, the Tom Kha (coconut milk, chili paste, mushroom, galanga, lemongrass, kaffir lime leaves, lime juice, cilantro) is the best in the city. 

But THE BEST THING IS THE DESSERT.
Try the blueberry rangoon. I mean, seriously, if you thought crab rangoon was a good appetizer, then finish the meal with hot blueberry/cream cheese goodness."}
{"text":"Terrible service! Was told 20 minutes for a table, took an hour. Sat around 20 minutes at table waiting for server to even talk to us. I'd tell you how the food was but I may never get it...been here for 2 hours.

Food was good, I had the drunken noodles. Very tasty. Adding back one star, but honestly the service was just atrocious. Didn't even ask if we wanted drinks."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh- such a combination of delicious wonderment!
While visiting my daughter's family in Madison I know we learn about the best places appreciated by local families.
We had a curry with noodles, a beef and green bean dish, sticky rice with mangoes and a rice and pork dish. Will check on the names of these yummy delights on the menu but truly you should high tail it down to Ha Long Bay."}
{"text":"Favorite \"nice\" asian place in town. Love having both Vietnamese and Thai options and you'll get to see some great courses you won't find at the other Thai or Vietnamese places in town. Service has been not the best in the past, but not bad enough for me to rate down."}
{"text":"Walked in and every server just walked past us for like 10 minutes like we were not there. I understand they are busy but they should at least put us on the wait list. Tried talking to them but was just ignored that one time. All the 3-4 times we had food there we waited 30 minutes or more but they were decent."}
{"text":"I'm going to go out on a limb and just contend that in terms of price to quality this is the best restaurant in Madison. 

No where else can you get such an enormous, well-executed, delicious bowl of Pho for under $8. Man, I can't even think of another restaurant where you can get such a great _meal_ for under $8, let alone even a sandwich at a chain. 

Their menu is gigantic, though in truth it's because they take a single dish and offer 5-6 variations of that dish as different listings. If you have any familiarity with what they serve it's pretty easy to navigate. 

Their curry is also worth trying, as is their pad thai and house-made dumplings. 

They have some exciting lesser-known dishes as well; look closely at the menu and order something you've never tried. I've had a good time doing that at Ha Long Bay on multiple visits. Mak pa, fish wrapped and steamed in a banana leaf, is a notable choice.

Service is infamously slow, but I argue without irony or patronage that they're very nice and professional here. It just takes a little patience before one receives a bill."}
{"text":"I have been here on several occasions, but yesterday was the first time I ordered CARRY-OUT PHO (PH8, regular and large). I wasn't sure if this was a good idea -- but it was perfect, rainy pho-weather, and I didn't have the ingredients (or time) to whip up my own. The order was made around 6:40 pm and she said would take 20-25 minutes. We arrived a little after 7, and boy was I glad I ordered carry out. Even with the tsunami-like weather, the entry way was packed! I made my way to the register and the transaction was quick. My order was ready, nicely packed. 

When we got home, it was still warm enough to eat right away. The broth and meatballs were packed in a plastic container, scallions, noodles and other meats in a take-out box, veggie garnishing in a zip lock (bean sprouts, basil, jalapeño and lime), two small containers of hoisin and a packet of Sriracha sauce. Everything was placed into our bowls. We used to think the pho servings at restaurants were small and this proved us wrong. Our bowls were loaded! Broth was delicious, noodles and meats the perfect texture! We are definitely doing carry-out pho again -- but only if/when we're short on time. 

Other times we've been here, we've enjoyed many dishes. Their AP10 (Spring Roll with Egg Roll) has inspired me, and the LS7 (Nem Khao) is my favorite! I'm a spice-fanatic, and they not only have chili garlic oil on request, but freshly minced Thai chili, too! If your palette is accustomed to SE Asian flavors, you may not be a fan of their Larb or Papaya Salads.

They only con I have is that the sit-in service can be slow. There have been many times where I joked with my Hubs, \"Ha Long Bay\" is really \"How Long Bae?\" I get it though -- they get busy, have an extensive menu (Thai, Lao and Viet cuisine!), and a teensy kitchen to work with. So this hasn't deter us from returning."}
{"text":"Solid dining choice, consistent quality and service at good prices."}
{"text":"Best thai food in Madison, Wisconsin. Don't remember what the best dishes are but this place was absolutely fantastic."}
{"text":"Excellent food.  Excellent service.  This is one of the best restaurants Madison has.  Go there now.  Quit reading my review and leave.  Order anything.  Why are you still reading?  You could be eating tasty Thai food by now!"}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite restaurant in Madison. Nearly everything I've had here has been excellent, and the service is great, too. The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is that the rest of Madison seems to share my enthusiasm for the place, and they don't take reservations unless you have a party of 5 or more.

The street parking can be a bit tedious on weekends, but usually during the week it's not difficult to find a space. There's a (very) tiny waiting space when you're waiting for a table with a few outdated magazines and ancient copies of the Isthmus; it's often cramped and I believe there are only 2-3 chairs. Make sure you check in right away with the front counter to get on the waiting list if this is the situation with which you're confronted. As of yet, I don't think there's a way to grab a soda or beer from the case and have it added to your tab once you get a table, which would be a great idea. The booths are extremely comfortable (the tables, less so, since they are crowding a bunch of them into a tight space). The bathrooms are always clean and well-supplied, but since they are single-occupancy, you can count on a line for them on the weekends.

I've had the Crab Wonton, Goi Cuon Cha Giò, and Goi Cuon Chay as appetizers. While the Crab Wonton (served with a sweet & sour sauce) is nothing to write home about, the Goi Cuon Cha Giò is fantastic - it's a spring roll wrap over a Vietnamese egg roll, so it has a nice hearty warmth while still feeling light and refreshing. The rolls come with a delicious sauce with chunks of peanuts that I only wish was a bit thicker, since it tends to run everywhere. The Goi Cuon Chay is a great vegetarian spring roll.

For dinner, I've had Musamun Curry, Panaeng Curry, Red/Yellow/Green Curries, Pho Tái (you should definitely clarify with your server if you order this, since many of them mishear it as the Pad Thai), Gà Kho Gung, and Pad Thai. The Musamun Curry is better here than I've had it anywhere else - it's not too sweet (usually the downfall of Musamun Curry, in my opinion), and the mix of spices is perfect. I always order it with beef. The Panaeng Curry (usually ordered with chicken) is alright, but I had better when living in a Vietnamese neighborhood in SF. The Red/Yellow/Green Curries are all nice, but flavor-wise not terribly distinct from each other. On the other hand, the Pho Tái is freaking amazing - the best I've had since leaving SF. There's plenty of meat (though it could be rarer when it arrives, letting the broth cook it), they bring out tons of Thai basil/bean sprouts/lime wedges to add, and there are huge bottles of Hoisin and Sriracha at the tables to adjust everything to your personal palate. It's really filling, but it doesn't work well as takeout or leftovers (Pho Tái rarely does), and you'll probably feel a touch of hunger later as the broth leaves your stomach. The Gà Kho Gung is the PERFECT meal when sick. It has a ton of chicken and fresh ginger in a broth-like sauce, which the rice absorbs well. It's one of my favorite winter meals. The Pad Thai is pretty good, but not a standout dish like some of the others. A note about spice: I tend to like things spicier than the average Sconnie, but the difference between ** spiciness and *** spiciness is bizarre and sometimes wildly fluctuates from time to time. I can't taste any spice at the ** level, but the *** level means I'll have to pack most of it to go because my mouth is too on fire to eat much. I tend to find a happy medium by choosing the ** level and adding Sriracha. My Texan boyfriend is fine with the *** spice level, though. Another note: the portions are ENORMOUS; I can't remember a time when I didn't need a to-go box. They're easily shared between at least two people.

The Thai Iced tea does a great job of blunting the spiciness of some of the food, but I suggest requesting that it come out WITH the meal instead of before the meal, so that the ice doesn't melt too much, thinning it out. I've also quite enjoyed the Crabbie's alcoholic ginger beer, though it will not soothe spiciness and sometimes seems to exacerbate it. I've always been far too full to order dessert, so I can't speak to that. They do bring out lovely little candies with the check, though; I wish I knew what flavor they're supposed to be.

While I've always had a pleasant experience, I do think it's fair to mention that some good friends (who have also been huge fans of the place in the past) did have a bad experience a few months ago. One of them ordered a new dish and thought it tasted terrible. His fiancee verified that it was basically inedible, and they alerted their server after each taking only a bite or two of the dish. She was fairly unpleasant when they requested to send it back and replace it with something else, though she did finally do so after calling in other servers. However, I've never had a bad experience, and look forward to returning."}
{"text":"Very good! The squash curry- spot on. The tom yum- fresh and just the right flavor. There was a noodle dish with beef and tomato and that was also great. The wait was long-ish and the wait for the food was really long, however, we were behind a huge group so it was understandable. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"\"WHAT? We live THIS close to Ha Long Bay?\"

That's pretty much what I said when we pulled off our parking spot to head home after a SATISFYING dinner. 

We ended up here after a cold (literally) experience at another restaurant. This place has a nice, home-y feel that you can't help but feel relaxed in. It was a busy night so service was kind of all over the place, but not neglectful. 

The menu is completely overwhelming, even for someone like me who's used to the abundance of choices at Asian restaurants. Let alone for my boyfriend who hadn't tried about 99.9% of the menu. 

We started with the chicken egg rolls, which I passed on, so my boyfriend had both of them. \"The best egg rolls I've ever had,\" he said. 

My boyfriend had Pad See-Eew for the first time ever. Medium spiciness. He enjoyed it, although he said the noodles were too soft that it was \"slimy.\" Surprising coming from someone who likes soft noodles. 

I had the beef red curry fried rice. YUM! I want more, please. Mild spiciness because I can't handle Asian spicy sometimes (lame). I only wish there was more more more beef in the dish.

Both plates were pretty hefty, so we were able to take some home and enjoy leftovers the next day. Truthfully, I think they tasted even better the next day--but that's what I think of most dishes. Isn't that a good thing though?

We also had some sesame balls with red bean. He liked it and I brought one to work for my coworkers to share since I like to introduce them to Asian anything. Thumbs up from everyone. Now where I can find huge ones of those?!"}
{"text":"My favorite is the Tom Yum Noodle soup.  There is a choice of meats you can add, but I prefer the tofu.  It is served with a dish of sliced jalapenos, bean sprouts, lime leaves and a slice of lime, so you can adjust it to your liking.   It is hard for me to pull myself away from this soup, but when I do.  There are a couple of other favorites that we always get, no matter what else we choose.  This is a meal size bowl.  You can get it as an appetizer soup, much smaller and without the noodles.

Nem Khao Tod :
Crispy rice with minced sour sausage, chicken, onion, cilantro, mint, lime juice, topped with peanuts; served with lettuce for wrapping

and the 

 Laab
Your choice of meat mixed with galanga, lime leaves, garlic, onion, hot chili, mint, and cilantro; served with cucumber and lettuce

both perfect every time.  We have tried many other dishes over the years, and have never had one we didn't love."}
{"text":"We live four blocks from Ha Long Bay so we have gotten take-out from them many times in the last year. Oddly, we have never dined in, so I can't comment on the service. I'm not sure precisely when they opened, but I know in the fall of 2009 when we first started picking up food there were a few problems with mixed up orders and longish waits. However, those issues seem to have long cleared up. They have hired some good employees and generally seem well-organized and attentive. I haven't had to wait for my call-in order to be ready in a long time.  

They do have a ridiculously large menu, which is fun for us since we can leisurely look it over in the comfort of our home, but I can see how it's a little much for one restaurant. At the same time, I have liked most of the dishes we have gotten. Some of their Thai dishes do not meet the standard of my favorite divey Thai place in Milwaukee, but I think others are really good. 

I especially like the squash curry, the pad thai, and the spring rolls that have an egg roll inside them (sounds so ridiculous but it's actually good!) I am realizing that in order to get the food spicy enough for my husband and I that we have to order 4/4 stars, which seems a little strange, but whatever. I'm looking forward to trying the pho whenever we decide to dine in. 

Overall, I think this is very good Asian food for Madison, and I'm happy they are in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Ha Long Bay has a big menu with lots of great choices. The Chef's Special is a deliciously subtle lemongrass stir fry. The green tea is really flavorful. Beyond classic Thai and Vietnamese dishes, such as Pad Thai, curry, and Pho, Ha Long Bay offers a wide range of soups and a number of Laotian dishes."}
{"text":"Ha Long Bay intrigued me, and it wasn't just the waiter with unique tats running the length of his arms, nor the floor to ceiling window seating....although that helped....  

No, it was the Tom Yum Talay that had my attention.  So I'm in the mood for something spicy, and healing, and Tom Yum provides that medicine... trust...so I ask the waiter to be so kind as to serve me.  And he obliges, and he brings out this generous bowl of soup chock-full with prawn, enormous scallop, mussels, squid, fresh chunks of galangal, ginger, lime leaves, shards of lemon grass, visible red chili slices, and of all things... pineapple?  

Can't say I've ever had Tom Yum with pineapple before, was this some kind of fusion joke?...  But screw it, I put heaping spoonfuls into my bowl and delicately slurped..... Wow.... that broth. Enamored...  

I could write pages of my infatuation..."}
{"text":"Everything was delicious fresh tasting appealing to the eye the service was also up to par I will most definitely be back"}
{"text":"Just went here tonight for dinner. Authentic and delicious! The best egg rolls and crab wontons I've had."}
{"text":"Food is fantastic! But it can be a bit crowded, so I recommend going early. Even if it is crowded, it's definitely worth the wait."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place in town for curry. Great atmosphere, delicious food, and friendly service. Lots of vegetarian and vegan options. Prices are reasonable, especially for lunch. There's a reason the place is so crowded every night. Check it out!

For vegetarians/vegans: I recommend the mock duck with any curry dish."}
{"text":"I am absolutely IN LOVE with Ha Long Bay!

My dining partners and I began with the Crab Meat Wontons, which were the best crab rangoon that I have ever had- a great size and a perfect shape that ensures that every bite has a taste of the amazing cream cheese filling. 

For my entree, I had the Squash Curry with Chicken, my favorite. As always, it was absolutely delish and the spice level was perfect. Definitely a must try!

 Finally, we finished our meal with the Coconut Sticky Rice with Mango. If you've never tried this stuff, you need to right away! The tangy, soft sweetness of the fresh mango is the perfect contrast to the slightly chewy texture of the rice. It's actually my favorite food ever!

I would have given Ha Long Bay 5 stars if it hadn't been for the unreasonably long time that we spent sitting at our table without greetings or drinks. Having worked as a server in the past, I can understand when a server is busy, but the fact that as we waited for at least 10 minutes, many servers walked past us without even stopping. I would have appreciated at least a quick greeting!

Besides a few service mishaps, my experience at Ha Long Bay was amazing as always and I can't wait to return for more Mango Sticky Rice soon!"}
{"text":"Definitely one of the best Asian restaurants Madison has to offer.  I've been here several times, have gotten a different dish every time, and have been very satisfied with all of the dishes.  Their menu is vast, so there's plenty of reason to come here many times. If I had to narrow it down, my tip would be to try item V5, which is what a lot of my friends get every time they come.  It's a safe bet for those who don't want to browse the enormous menu.  Even though this enormous menu is overwhelming to some, it allows to get nearly anything your heart desires, and it makes you want to come back to try other dishes.

The only downside about this place is that it's very popular, so nearly every night from 6-7:30 there's going to be a wait for tables, and you can't call ahead or make reservations.  But once you get in, it's smooth sailing from there, as the food is always made fairly quickly, the prices are affordable, and the portions are generous. This is one of Madison's best."}
{"text":"This is my favorite asian restaurant in Madison,

Excellent portions, decent prices, packed with orgasmic flavors, with a heat level to your liking.

There menu is long (at least 6 pages). Would recommend looking it over on line to help with the decision making.

My favorites are Papaya Salad, Vietnamese Crepes (Sat & Sun only), Ap10 (egg roll inside a spring roll), LS7 Nem Khao Tod (crispy rice, sausage, chicken, mint, cilantro)

I don't understand people's problem with the wait. They don't take reservations for one thing and It's a happening place( = people like & come back). Also the wait for the food never seem too long. Just convers with the people your with. Cause once the food comes out. No one will say a word because of the food their chowing down on."}
{"text":"Delicious! Great service! The Pad Thai dish and peanut crusted chicken dish are hands down the best!! Their plum wine is very unique and delicious as well!"}
{"text":"I came to eat with a big group of people and the service was very good! Very friendly and a great place to eat at! The prices are decent and the food was very delicious! The portion was big for sharing in my opinion. It was very busy so call in and reserve a place if you are thinking to come in. We had a reservation for 5 we came at 4:30 and it has been very very busy ever since! In the end, I was really happy with this place and the food was delicious! Even though I couldn't eat things they had stuff that I could eat and they made everything fresh!!! For appetizers ask for spicy wonton and fresh spring rolls! HIGHLY RECCOMEND!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Fried chicken dumplings, fresh spring rolls with shrimp. probably best thai/lao appetizer selection in madison by far. apps get 5 stars

entrees get 3-4 depending on what you order, ive had hits and misses. Noodle dishes are always fantastic

UPDATE:  raising my review to 5 stars
went back to Ha Long for the first time in over a year last Saturday night and everything was awesome. Tom Yum soup was the best I have ever tasted and all the entrees were considerably better then what i remember."}
{"text":"Based on the glowing reviews on yelp, I was kind of expecting this place to be great, so I went here last night.

What I was not expecting was a 2 hour meal due to the fact that the servers were totally incompetent.  There were actually open tables, yet no one was being seated.  There didn't seem to be a host/hostess and people were walking in and staring around like they didn't know what to do, and weren't being greeted.  There really wasn't any reason I should have waited for an hour and a half for a table when the place wasn't all that busy, there were only 3 people ahead of me, and there were actually empty tables in the restaurant.

I think there was just a total lack of communication in the kitchen.  My water glass was empty and a waitress walked by with a pitcher of water, yet she only poured water for the tables she served.  

The food was okay.  It was certainly better than other restaurants in this town doing the same thing.  I think if I ever went back, I'd order take-out."}
{"text":"This was by far the best Asian food that I've ever had. I've never been out of the US, but I have eaten in Chinatowns across the US, and make a habit of frequenting the local Asian restaurants whenever I visit a new city. 

I ordered the peanut chicken stir-fry and crab Rangoon. Every ingredient POPPED, and tasted FRESH FRESH! (sauces were fresh and delicious - not cornstarchy) A person can tell that the cooks here take pride in the preparation, and don't cut corners. HLB has a new life-long patron!"}
{"text":"Their food is quite good, about as good as good SE Asian in Chicago, which is better than any other SE Asian here.  It almost but doesn't quite make up for how poorly managed the kitchen is.  Waits are long at a table, and with a party of four entrees will arrive as much as ten minutes apart.  Carry out reliably takes ten to fifteen minutes longer than they say it will on the phone, whether ordering to pick up or ordering ahead for a specified time.  We go back about every six months in the hopes that they've gotten more the ball.  Over the last couple of years they haven't, which is a shame.  The food is good, but not quite good enough to be consistently worth the delays."}
{"text":"Ate here for dinner. Service was really friendly and quick. Food came out quick and hot. Its always hard to find small authentic places to eat at."}
{"text":"I love Ha Long Bay! The service is excellent even when the place is hopping. I usually get pho with soft tendon and tripe. This place has fantastic broth. It's got a real savory flavor that leaves you craving more. For drinks I always get the thai iced tea it's very creamy and sweet."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Asian food restaurant. There a knock about the wait, but the food and service make it worth the wait. Staff is courteous and attentive. Most dishes offer levels of heat and that's nice."}
{"text":"This place is good. My co-worker and I went here because we thought it was still a New Orleans resturant but when we walked in we had noticed something different. Anyway, we ate here and were quite happy. I had a large bowl of delicious shrimp and eggroll bun, spring rolls and pot stickers. Alsothe beers were cheap (3.50). Go eat here it's good."}
{"text":"I have only eaten here once so far, but it was very good.  Service was very friendly as well.  Next time I am in town, I will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"I just moved to Madison and this was the first restaurant whose food I had the luxury to indulge in. My roommate's boyfriend recommended the curries and they definitely did not disappoint. I had the mango curry, 2-star (in spice-level), and it was a perfect combo of hot and yet sweet. Great, well-integrated flavors with tender and delicious vegetables. 

Quick pick-up, ready when we got there, and still hot and delicious when we got home. I'm excited to try the noodles and other goodies. As a new Madison resident, I have to say that Ha Long Bay has set the bar high."}
{"text":"Worth the wait.  Had the chefs special stir fry HS9 based on recommendation of another Yelper.  Amazing combo of flavor... Kaffir lime leaves, lemongrass, onion, pepper, crispy vegetables.  Want to come back and try the Vietnamese crepe (only avail on weekends).   About a 35-40 min wait for dinner on a week night.  Service hoping but slow due to how busy this place was."}
{"text":"This was my first visit...great atmosphere, nice decor,  great service.  I had Thai iced tea and pork laab. The laab was served with sticky rice.  I was a bit disappointed that it was not also served with lettuce leaves,  as I have had it served from other restaurants. The serving size was huge--a big mound of meat. My friends had the chefs special stir-fry and the pho, which they both enjoyed.  We also shared pork spring rolls that had fried pork inside.  These were very fresh and large.  I think I would try shrimp ones next time.  We also had the vegetables puffs, which were fried triangles with curried vegetable stuffing.  Not bad, but they were served with sweet and sour sauce,  which was a strange pairing. 

Overall,  nice experience. Moderate prices and gigantic menu containing Vietnamese, Laotian, and Thai dishes. I would definitely return to try more dishes."}
{"text":"I'm sitting here right now. I have time to write a review while at dinner because I've been here for an hour and haven't even ordered yet. 

Lets see if my ratings change when the food gets here.

Food came.  Not good.  Not sure why people like this place.  Maybe Madison doesn't know what good Thai food is."}
{"text":"Good food, large menu. I have always ordered take out so I can't comment on the dining service, but I will say that wait time for take out orders has been pretty bad every time. We have called ahead and given 20 mins of lead time and we still had to wait another 20 mins or more for the order. I think it's worth the wait but 40 minutes is unacceptable now matter how good the food is."}
{"text":"Our family LOVES Ha Long Bay!  There is usually a wait, and it gets crowded, but the food is delicious.

The one thing I wish they would change is to put an infant changing table in the bathroom.  This casual restaurant is otherwise very family-friendly, that little change would make a huge difference for the families who dine here."}
{"text":"This was a wonderful restaurant and we had a great meal here.  This place is constantly packed, so if you can, make a reservation.

I had the squash curray with chicken.  The flavor was great, as was the texture.

Why only 4 stars?  My wife's pad thai was nothing more than average.  And there were different prices on different menus around the table."}
{"text":"The food here was absolutely fantastic. Came here on a Wednesday afternoon, and the place was pretty packed. We got seated right away though - the restaurant overall was very nice, and had a great atmosphere. 

We shared a Spring Roll appetizer, which had a good peanut dipping sauce, but was okay otherwise. I ordered the Mango Curry with Chicken, and my girlfriend ordered the Pad Thai. The Mango Curry was amazing, by far the best curry dish I have ever eaten. And there was so much food as well! Usually, I don't bring home any leftovers, but had to here. The Pad Thai was delicious as well - it tasted slightly different than the typical Pad Thai, but was still great. While writing this review, I actually just got the rest of the leftovers out of the fridge, since I just needed more of it!!!

Definitely recommend =)"}
{"text":"Excellent pho, fried dumplings to die for and the Tom yum was yummy! Very slow service.  Very good food."}
{"text":"I got the Com Chiên (Vietnamese fried rice) with tofu, and it was yummy! I need to work on my adjectives, don't I? Savory. Palatable. Tasty. Luscious. This was the first time I had ever eaten at a sit-down restaurant with Vietnamese food (and not just Thai), and what an incredible introduction to the cuisine it was! 

I noticed that a lot of reviewers complained about the long wait and overall slow service. We did indeed have to wait maybe a little longer than usual for our food at Ha Long Bay, BUT there were not many other people dining at the time. The waitstaff was not particularly friendly and there was a little bit of a language barrier. True. BUT, the food is just SO good. My three dining companions (one of whom was Vietnamese) all gave shining gold stars to this place, too. 

 This food was delicious and well worth the long wait. Maybe if we had been in a huge hurry, I would be singing a different tune. But the food was delectable, and I'll certainly come back for a second go if I'm ever in this neck of the woods again!"}
{"text":"This was my first time trying Thai cuisine in Madison. And I was really happy with the food. The squash curry was simply amazing. Their overall presentation was also good."}
{"text":"The place was packed for a Saturday afternoon, so browsed the nearby shops! It was a short wait but worth it! 
Attentive service by a humorous waiter and a tasty lunch!  We had Tom Kha noodle soup, a wide noodle dish with seafood and pork dish with sweet Thai teas! Medium was sufficient heat for us. We would definitely return!"}
{"text":"Never had a bad experience in this restaurant.... my personal favorite is Red Curry Fried Rice. A great place to try something new and be sure that it will taste amazing. Had viatnamese crepe and thai noodle soup and they were fantastic. Be prepared  to wait though."}
{"text":"I'm very glad that I didn't write a review of Ha Long Bay after my first visit there, because it would not have been so positive.  While their first month or two in business might have been a bit shaky (looong waits for service, mixed up orders, etc.), I returned last night to find that they have vastly improved on all fronts.

We ordered the chicken dumplings, pho, and bun, and it was all excellent.  The bun was euphorically good: cold noodles, fresh herbs and vegetables, and wonderfully seasoned grilled pork with a thin, sweet sauce poured over it.  I highly recommend it.  The pho was great, too, but I'm not as much of a noodles and broth person.  I will say, though, that the beef and noodles in the broth were fresh and well prepared, and the sprouts, herbs, and chili peppers we got on the side of the dish were all fresh and flavorful, as well.  Together, they made a nice combination of flavors and textures in the dish.

And the service, which on my first visit had been phenomenally slow and had messed up both our order and our appetizer, definitely had their acts together last night.  My dining partner even spilled the bowl of pho on his lap, and our server was there in an instant with towels to clean up the mess.  She was very nicely attentive.

After a rocky start, Ha Long Bay has established itself as a great option for Vietnamese food in Madison.  Go, and get the bun."}
{"text":"Not a good experience for us at all - maybe we just went on an off day, but the food was not very good (neither of us wants to go back for it) and the service was pretty awful. We had pad thai and sweet and sour chicken. It did at least look pretty, but wasn't great."}
{"text":"Everytime I go-- I get a little sick. I wish it didn't have to be this way, Iove thai food but for some reason Ha Long Bay and I don't mix. Just not impressed. :/"}
{"text":"Usually I'm a bit suspicious of anyplace that has such a HUGE menu. But this one doesn't disappoint. Everything I've had had been so fresh and delicious. Appetizers- the Vietnam dumplings are amazing as well as the spicy wontons. The squash curry is my favorite but I've never had a curry that wasn't delicious. Haven't tried the pho yet but it looks great. 

Only downside - the wait gets long after 6pm. If you can squeeze in early it's a good idea. But worth the wait."}
{"text":"We were really happy with this restaurant.   The menu is huge making it difficult to decide on which dish to go with.  But with all the selections one is sure to find something they can enjoy.
The Chicken dumplings were excellent and delicious.  The Thai Tea was very good too.
I chose the Laan Chicken which was beautiful and well made.  But I personally found the dish had a very different flavor from what I enjoy.  I also ordered medium spice and I detected no spice in the dish.
We really enjoyed ourselves because we did not feel rushed at all and had a very relaxing time talking and dining.  The service was friendly and very helpful too.   Other dishes that were very good were Pad Thai and Curry Chicken."}
{"text":"Apart from the bad parking... not the restaurant's fault obviously...this is the place to go for Pad Thai.  The sesame Chicken is not good - too sweet."}
{"text":"Pretty standard food.  MANY reserved tables you will not get.  Potatoes in curry? Why bother?"}
{"text":"Drunken noodles were great! Will be returning. Maybe on a weeknight- long wait to be seated."}
{"text":"This is unquestionably the best Thai & Vietnamese food in Madison. I'm heartbroken to be leaving this city and not get to have one last meal here due to the construction. 

Honestly, the service isn't great and the place gets paaaaaacked. But it's really worth it and I think it's reasonably priced. I recommend going pre-dinner rush around 5 or after it around 8. 

I've never had a bad meal here. Appetizer highlights are spring rolls (get it with peanut sauce. Get everything with peanut sauce. It's probably the best condiment of all time), crab rangoon and chicken wings, while all of the tom yum and tom kha varieties are excellent. My recommendation is always one of the curries, but the pad se ew and peanut chicken are excellent, and the LS7 is to die for. Go here. Now."}
{"text":"As far as meals go, Ha Long Bay's Mango Currey Chicken tops my list as my all time favorite. I no longer live in Madison, but every time I go back I make a point to go to Ha Long Bay. Although I only ever order the Mango Currey, I've tried other people's dishes a number of times and they've all been very good. If you're looking for a place to take someone for a special occasion, this may not be the spot for you, as it's very casual and the atmosphere is nothing to write home about. But if you're looking for amazing food and a reasonable price-- you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I would have given Ha Long Bay 5 stars if not for the time I didn't get my food for over an hour. I am not sure what happened, if my waiter forgot to put in the order or what but plenty of people that ordered after me got their food a decent amount of time before us. In fact, one party that arrived after us, left before we even got our food. I have been to Ha Long Bay at least 10 times and I had only one bad service experience, so overall, I still love the place. Their curries, dumplings, and tons of other dishes are to die for. Not to mention, the guava candies they give you with the check. Because of my bad dining experience and the restaurants usual wait, I have begun to get take out instead of dine in. I haven't had any issues yet!"}
{"text":"One of the best pad thai I've had in a long time. Lots of flavor and right amount of sauce. So good! Chicken was tender and the portions were big. I came for lunch and still had plenty to take home. I really liked the soup (tom yum tofu soup) that came with the lunch it had chunks of mushroom that were cooked perfect. The appetizer I got was the veggie curry puffs the filling was delicious but the crust was not as flaky and crunchy as I hoped but still good. Prices were very reasonable. I got an appetizer, lunch entree which comes with either soup or cucumber salad and a glass of wine all for 18$. My server was nice got me everything I needed and personable. Big menu as well, lots of different choices for everyone."}
{"text":"I really enjoy dining here except when there's a long line waiting to be seated. Here's a great tip. Reserve and order your food ahead of time, and you'll be sure to get your food shortly after being seated. Otherwise another down side to service here is that it sometimes takes up to a half hour before you get your food.  Otherwise I love the food and the waitstaff is really nice."}
{"text":"I loved the atmosphere here: super cute with orange and green decor. We went on a Thursday night at 8:00 and we had to wait 30 mins, but it was well worth the wait! Everything was on point from the lengthy menu to the teeny lime slices in the water to the super clean, nice bathrooms! We shared the squash curry with chicken (we got it medium spicy, but we wished we had asked for it hotter!) and the chicken was super fresh and tender. We also got a notably delish beef vermicelli noodle dish which was chock full of fresh, crunchy veggies! Of course we got a couple Thai teas which were creamy, sweet and addictive. My food lovin' friends and I were impressed with this place.... See you soon again, Ha Long Bay!"}
{"text":"A friend at the UW brought me here last night.  I was really surprised at the 40 minute wait on a random Wednesday night.  After dinner I understood why.   Our dinner was just great: flavorful, perfectly spiced and fresh. We had 2 entries and split spring rolls and the bill was less than $30 - so a good value in addition to great Thai food.  I had lemongrass chicken - lots of chicken, and wonderful veggies and 2 varieties of mushrooms.  We have outrageous Thai food in LA - this is pretty dam close!"}
{"text":"Meh perfectly describes my feelings, but the Tom Yum soup saves the rating. Excellent flavor, very delicious. The spring rolls were also solid.

The Pad See Ew with Tofu was bland if anything. Medium spicy meant no spice at all. Tofu was not fried like I am typically used to. The noodles weren't tender. The Pad Thai with chicken was also bland, and the chicken was stringy. With so many other options in Madison, let alone within a few blocks, I don't think I'll be going back."}
{"text":"Since my first review we've gone here three more times.  On two occasions we got the table by the big bay window, and that was awesome!  We ordered what we usually order every time we go there, and it was outstanding.  Before I had mentioned how unimpressed I was with the longgggg wait time, however, we've discovered the secret!!  Don't go around the typical meal times!  *duhhhh!*"}
{"text":"One of my favorite Asian restaurants. Every time I'm in Madison I go here. Service is fast, good, and polite and the food is amazing. Great selection of dishes and very reasonably priced. The guava candies after dinner is a nice touch. I've been here probably a hundred times and never had a bad experience. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in Madison!
I knew I wanted some type of noodle dish but not the usual pad thai or drunken noodles.
The waiter recommended the Pad Lao with chicken (hot)--a rice noodle dish stir fried with veggies and delicious sauce and the vinaigrette-type sauce on the side. It truly hit the spot! The sauce had a delicious sweet-savory taste to it and the crushed peanuts on top tied the dish together. The chicken was tender and the noodles were cooked to the perfect consistency. I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking to get a noodle dish. My friend got the red curry--a delicious savory coconut-based curry that I would recommend! I hope to be back at Ha Long Bay soon!"}
{"text":"The good: 
-  Best Pho, should have just stuck with that. Without the Pho, this place would be a 2/3 star for me. 

The OK: 
- Shrimp spring rolls are good. 
- The service was decent, considering how busy they were (could probably stand to hire another server though). 

The bad:
- The Tom Yum is amazing the first few bites, very distinct flavor. But the taste gets old fast, and might leave you with a bit of a tummy ache.
- Expect long waits and crammed, loud ambiance.
- The menu is the size of a book. Take a look at it ahead of time if you can- and a lot of things look delicious, so decisions are hard to make! In my personal opinion, the menu can be done a lot better: get rid of some things, and simplify (if all dishes are the same but vary in only one ingredient, list the ingredient as an option, don't list them as separate dishes) 

P.S. Yes you can order for pick up!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Thai restaurant that I've been to, but they also serve great Vietnamese and Laotian food. Actually, Ha Long Bay is located in Vietnam, so perhaps they're primarily a Vietnamese restaurant. It's probably the best place to get Asian food in Madison. Most of the dishes I've had here were nothing short of incredible, but there's still so much on the menu that I haven't tried. I'm going to try and maintain a list of menu items that I've tried here and give my thoughts on them below. Hopefully, it helps people order something good from the menu.

AP8 Dumplings - I don't usually order dumplings when I go out to eat, but I gave these a try. I got pan-fried chicken dumplings. The ginger and onion really made the chicken's flavor something special; they were definitely important flavor components, but they were subtle. The dumpling itself was crispy with good flavor from the oil that they were fried in. The sauce gives it the saltiness that the dumplings are missing. They're fantastic.

VS1 Vietnamese Crepe - When this comes to your table, you know that you've ordered something special. Tons of fresh, crisp vegetables and meat are inside of a folded crispy (and slightly greasy) crepe and served with a side of sweet chili sauce and fresh Thai basil. This is the best version of this dish I've ever had. I like to have this with shrimp.

TN1 Pad Thai - I actually don't like their pad thai that much. It's too sweet and saucy for my preference. It's good, but it's not great.

TN5 Pad Lao - This is what you get if you like pad thai but you want something a new. It has a very similar flavor, but it's not as sweet and saucy, and it comes with a lot of egg. I definitely prefer this over the pad thai. I like to get shrimp with this one.

TS5 Tom Kha Noodle Soup - I'm not going to lie, I was a little disappointed by this. The concept is awesome: pho noodle souo except you swap the broth with the kaffir lime leafy, galangaly, and coconut milky goodness that is tom kha. Unfortunately, I found this tom kha broth to be too sweet and not savory enough. I would have also liked cilantro instead of the typical pho accompaniment of bean sprouts and basil.

TC1 Musaman - This curry is too sweet for my preference, but it's still a nice aromatic flavor. I like to get this with beef because I think it works nicely with the potatoes.

TC2 Panang - Again, this curry is too sweet for my preference, but it's still good. I love the pieces of Thai basil you find while you eat it.

TC6 Squash Curry - This is my favorite curry that I've tried so far. I like the squash more than I like potatoes, and the Thai egg plant is good too. I prefer to have this with chicken because I think it goes well with the squash.

HS1 Ga Xao Don - I got the chicken version of this, and it was pretty much like eating sweet sesame chicken with vegetables. I didn't like this.

HS8 Pad Ped - This is another great curry option. It's pretty similar to the squash curry.

HS9 Chef's Special Stir-Fry - Lemon grass, kaffir lime leaf, and Thai basil really make their presence known in this otherwise light meat and vegetable stir fry. It's flavorful and simple.

LS7 Nem Khao Tod - This is such a flavor experience! Crispy fried rice with fermented Chinese sausage, cilantro, lime, onion and peanut served lettuce wrap style. This dish has so many different flavors, and it will take your tongue for a ride. I like to get this one extra spicy. I highly recommend this one."}
{"text":"I usually love this place, but I placed a carry out order today for chicken satay and Tom kha soup because I'm sick, and I had to wait a full 30 minutes in the restaurant for 2 appetizer orders. They seem to have completely forgotten my order and the girl in front had to keep going back to the kitchen to check. When I got it home, the chicken was basically cold. I'll be pretty suspicious going forward when I think about what place to in town for Asian food."}
{"text":"Over an hour after ordering before our food arrived and it was cold...very disappointing. Maybe it was a fluke but there are too many other good restaurants in Madison to risk a return visit."}
{"text":"Amazing restaurant with amazing food. I've been here 20+ times and I've never been disappointed in any dish I've ordered. Order anything and you'll be happy. And I know what you're thinking, \"If you like to food so much and are such a big fan. Why give it only 4 stars?\" I'll tell you why. Service kinda sucks. I get that this place is a pretty big deal and there usually a 1 hr wait to get seated unless you're lucky. I've been here when it's busy and when it was slow and there's much to be desired from the staff. Also, the busier it gets the more the rules change. Come with a group of 4 on a decent time. Want separate checks? Yeah sure, whatever you want. Come here during the peak times? Nope. We've never done that before and it's policy that its only one check. Like for real? Good thing the food outweighs the staff.

P.S. This place is small. Don't come here with a group unless you have a reservation or are lucky enough to come at a time where they have time to push tables together."}
{"text":"My biggest regret is only trying Ha Long Bay for the first time during my final week in Madison. I have been missing out on the best Asian food in the city, no question. I made this my final meal in town before driving cross-country because their Tom Kha with tofu is that good. I love that they can veganize pretty much anything on the menu, including the pho, and you can tell that most of the dishes are prepared fresh. Highly recommended. Usually very busy, so if you don't want to wait, go at an off-peak time, and bring friends so you can try as much of the extensive and excellent menu as possible."}
{"text":"Feel semi bad about the low rating, however the service during our last visit was horrible. My husband and I come in regularly because we love the food and are never disappointed. Unfortunately our last visit for lunch with a friend who we wanted to introduce to the restaurant fell more than short. We were sat right away which was great since we normally have to wait about 15+ minutes for a table. After waiting for 30 minutes my husband finally went up to the host to ask if he could take our order since the wait staff never came, he was more than happy to help. Order was put in and he informed us that our waitress would bring the drinks out that we ordered... that never happened. Once again the host helped us out. Finally our food came out (delivered by the little older lady that is always there, I assume is the owner or manager) she is always so nice when we visit. I do not believe she normally takes care of tables but she is the only reason our lunch that day was remotely enjoyable. She could clearly tell that we were a little annoyed by the previous service so she took extra care to make sure that we were ok with our meals.
She is the reason we will be coming back in, besides the fact that we love the food."}
{"text":"This is always a favorite. I've never had a dish I didn't enjoy, and of course the Thai Iced Tea is amazing. The satay and curry puffs are always a good choice. Service can be slow at times but the staff is always very kind."}
{"text":"Every dish I've tried is full of flavor. Pad Thai, curries, bung bo... Never skip on ordering pork egg rolls! 

American level heat, so if you like spice you should order hot. 

Pleasant wait staff and good prices, especially at lunch."}
{"text":"My go to to-go. Their squash curry is the stuff of dreams. Though I have a hard time ordering anything but their curries, I have tried the other menu options ordered by my companions and they are consistently delicious. Even things as simple as chicken with vermicelli are flavorful and satisfying. 
Usually delivery wins out in life for the convenience factor. This is never true here. When I crave Ha Long Bay, nothing else will cut it."}
{"text":"Five stars! Never disappointed with the menu. My favorite is getting a curry dish with squash. The outside of the squash is green and soft. The broth with coconut milk and spices is very savory. Ginger tea hits the spot and end the meal with mango and warm sticky rice."}
{"text":"Ahhh, one of my favorite Thai restaurants in Madison! But be aware, this place gets busy quickly, and waiting for seating can take a long time as well. The waiters/waitresses are extremely nice, but the food can take a while sometimes, which is my only reason for minusing a star.

Their have the most ample menu in all of Madison, as in they have anything you could imagine from a Thai restaurant. 

You can't really be let down by the food! Some dishes may not be over the top, but almost all their dishes are better than average. The waiters/waitresses also give good suggestions to what you want to eat. My favorites are their curry, pad thai, soup curry, and Pho. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Summary: (+) Great, well prepared and seasoned food (-) A little too much on the menu, pare down (+) However, impressive authentic dishes like Banh Cuon. (+) Tastefully decorated (-) Paper place mats make me feel cheap (+) Good price. In all, Great Place!

I've been here a couple times and I have to say that Ha Long Bay is an excellent addition to the Madison area. Having been in areas with much more substantial vietnamese, thai and south-east asian populations, I thought that the food was great for Wisconsin, far superior to anything else that I've had in Madison. 

Before I comment on specific dishes, I have to make a general comment: their tofu is just fantastic. I might even claim that if you know someone that doesn't like tofu, this might convince them. Everything that I've had there with tofu in it has just been great. 

Food: Ha Long Bay has an impressive menu, although perhaps TOO impressive (i.e it is far too large) I think that they should scale back and find a central vision for their menu. All of their food is fantastic though, so if they stuck with what works or split off some of their items (like lunch specials) for a separate side menu, then it might make the menu more manageable. 

I've had several different dishes there and they have all been good. The pho is a welcome addition to Madison. I planned to be camped outside of this place all winter in order to fill myself with the delicious broth that is pho. Having been to more traditional pho places though, I would prefer if they're waiters understood that I might want to get more than one type of meat in a dish. For instance, I tend to get Pho Tai Bo Vien. When I ordered this the first time I was there, I did get this confused look. It might have just been that waiter though.

Last night, I took a very large party there and we all had a variety of dishes and no one had anything negative to say about their dishes. As a side note, they worked really well with us and had the table set up when we arrived and were very nice about splitting checks. A+ Back to business, we had crispy fried noodle, several types of curry (The mango curry and the roast duck curry were just so fantastic!), dumplings, pad thai, some pan fried noodles and several tofu dishes. It was all great and recommended.

One last note about food, although I haven't had it yet, I am very impressed by several of the more authentic dishes on the menu. They have Tom Rang Muoi, Banh Xeo, and (most impressive of all)  Banh Cuon. I will certainly go back to try these. 

Decor: The place is pretty well decorated, nothing too fancy but just enough to make you feel like the place is nice and taken care of. I appreciate their cute little window seat by the door. It gives it the kind of vibe that I expect from a Willy St. location. 

The tables: Considering the amount of condiments that they could have, I like that they have out just the necessities: hoisin sauce, sriracha, and soy sauce.  This is perhaps the area that needs the most improvements: they need to get rid of the paper place-mats. It ruins the otherwise classy feel of the joint. And, I know that it's Wisconsin, but I would appreciate receiving chopsticks with my silverware. Similarly, I think that most dishes should receive a separate plate to eat from. I don't know anyone for example that would (or could) eat an entire crispy fried noodle dish to themselves.

In all a great place to have here in Madison, and I think that we should support it to keep it here for a long while!"}
{"text":"Incredibly rude staff person decided to wait on the MAN standing behind me--even though I was first in line.  When I called her on this, she told me that she was multitasking--so therefore, it didn't take any longer taking care of both of us at the same time.  Of course, had I not spoken up and said I was there first, she probably would've just taken care of him.  And of course, it would've been quicker had she not been doing two things at once.  Plus, instead of apologizing and just doing the right thing, she wasted time justifying her acts.  In the end, she said I didn't need to come back.  I guess the customer isn't always right!"}
{"text":"The spring rolls are really good, Authentic and delicious. The staff are really helpful, quick, and have great attitudes!"}
{"text":"Always great food and friendly service!  Try the chicken wings app....sooooo good!  The mixed veggies are always good and full of flavor!  Always worth the drive from Beaver Dam!"}
{"text":"I can only echo what others have said about their amazing menu.  Every possible combination of Thai, Laotian and Vietnamese food must be available here.  Amazing!  Despite the variety I generally stick with vegetables and tofu in a ginger sauce.  Yum!  Hubby isn't much of an adventure eater but has taken a few chances here and has never been disappointed.

I have only been disappointed when I didn't know what I was ordering and didn't take the time to ask questions.  I once ordered and entrée that sounded delicious and had \"gà\" in the description.  I had no idea what \"gà\" was but wasn't too concerned because I'm not a particularly picky eater.  Turns out it was chicken which I don't care for in Asian food.  But I'm not the type to send food back because of my error so I still ate it and it was fine.

Couple things to keep in mind when going here -- you have to go early to have any chance of getting a table.  If you have to wait this isn't much of an issue on a nice summer day when you can wait outside and do some people watching on Willy Street.  In winter everyone is smashed inside which can also make it difficult to pay your bill or pick up carry-out trying to navigate around all the people waiting for their tables.

Another point to be aware of, it is quite loud in there.  We found ourselves having to repeat what we were saying to our dinner mates which got old quickly.  Unsure if the building has poor acoustics or just the fact that every table is filled."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the food here! 
I had the Panang curry and it was perfect. Everyone in my party enjoyed their food as well. I definitely would come back here, very authentic!"}
{"text":"Things I ate at Ha Long Bay (one night, 2 people)

Based on this evidence, it appears that everything at Ha Long Bay is amazing to eat"}
{"text":"2 stars for food and 1 extra for a pleasant service.

Don't get me wrong on the food front. The food is here is not bad but I've had much much better and authentic Thai and Vietnamese elsewhere. To start things off, we ordered a Beef Pho which was more cloudy than a traditional clear pho broth. The noodles too were chunkier than the thin noodles you expect.

Moving onto Mains, we ordered a Panang Curry (Chicken) and a portion of Crispy Egg Noodles (Beef, BBQ Pork, Chicken and Shrimp)....the Panang curry was loaded with big solid chunks of Potatoes and the cream in the curry had curdled a bit so not a good dish if you know what a traditional Panag curry tastes like. For the noodle dish, I'd asked the server to replace the Beef with Pork. I ended up getting Only Beef and Pork. Upon correction, the server apologized and brought a separate portion of Bbq Pork and Shrimp. Now, the noodles MINUS the proteins were great. The proteins screwed up the dish. The pork and beef were tough, the Bbq pork was uneatable as it was cooked to death. And there was No Chicken still!

All in all, it might have been a bad night since the place was packed. I'd be willing to give them another chance. Just not in the near future."}
{"text":"Food was good, nothing to complain about but also nothing to be very excited about. The service was pretty slow but still friendly. I would recommend bringing an extra sweater in the winter as my mom and I were pretty cold."}
{"text":"Driving from Wis Dells to Chicago, googled for Thai food in Madison. Saw reviews for Ha Long Bay and ended up there. Glad!  Party of 4 had to wait for 20 minutes at 8pm on Saturday. Had the best deep fried spring g rolls. Very fresh. Pho, Basil fried rice were very flavorful and the spice level (medium) was on the lighter side for southeast Asia food. Being used to Chicago prices, this place is a steal. Excellent portion sizes and low on prices. Thai iced coffee was not as sweet as I am used to and that is a good thing."}
{"text":"Ha Long Bay never fails.  No matter when I go or what \"newbie\" that I bring to try it out for the first time, the restaurant always delivers on extremely solid food.  Last night was no different..  
While the menu is packed full of gems, I went with my stand-bys....AP10 for an appetizer and LS7 for my entree.

The AP10 is a spring roll wrapped around a Vietnamese egg roll.  Served 2 per order, they are great to share.  Both soft and crunchy, they are flavor packed.

Moving on to the entree, I had my favorite...LS7....Nem Khao Tod.  This dish pairs up crispy rice with sour sausage (breakfast link sized, not that sour), chicken, onion, cilantro, mint, and lime juice served over a bed of lettuce.  I usually get it 3 or 4 stars (4 being the hottest).  Something about the spiciness of the dish, the coolness of the lettuce, the crunchiness of the rice makes it an unbelievable dish.  

And I am not alone on singing its praises.  The wait can be a tad long but you can wait or give them your number and saunter down to the Crystal Corner for a beer or two while waiting."}
{"text":"Average of four stars?

All of you are insane. The food here is amazing. I've never had to wait too long, but I also don't expect popular restaurants to instantly have a table for me no matter when I show up so maybe that's just me.

Try the curry puffs."}
{"text":"We have never gotten a dish that wasn't perfect.  I'd recommend the Thai dishes.  One of my favorite summer memory was coming home late from a meeting and my liver husband surprising me with their Pad Thai.  Their steamed dumpling have amazing texture and taste.  It's no secret in Madison that this is one of the best places to go for excellent food."}
{"text":"This place is by far one the best places around! Dumplings are so fresh and always on point! One thing... Don't wear anything u really like because you will leave Smelling like food"}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday afternoon at 3PM. We managed to get seats without a wait (after unsuccessful attempts before). I was really excited about this place since I've heard raving reviews. The Thai iced tea is very creamy (I've noticed this might just be a Wisconsin standard), but decent. I was surprised to see that they had Vietnamese, Thai, and Laotian food. Several others around us ordered Thai food and it looked excellent (both portion wise and looks wise. Tried both the pho and banh canh (a noodle soup) and was unfortunately pretty disappointed. The pho tasted like it was very thin with a lot of msg and the tendon was mostly fat unfortunately. The banh canh was very gelatinous and the shrimp was not to my liking. 

Overall I was very disappointed and won't come back for Vietnamese food/pho, but have hope for the other items."}
{"text":"I have lived here for four weeks and have been here 3 times already. 

Have not gotten a dish I haven't liked yet! My only complaint would be the service, which is slow and a little sloppy, yet redeemed by the servers having great attitudes and being very sweet. 

Nice decor, clean. Very reasonable price.

I was a little concerned about a bottled beer being out dated.... check those bottles, guys!"}
{"text":"The Pho...OMG.   I don't think I can get pho. Anywhere else is Madison and that's ok.  

The place is showing some wear, but it's ok..it is casual.   Staff is nice.

Food is always hot!"}
{"text":"This place is by far one of the most standout eateries in the city. Succulent delicious and amazing. Worth any inconvenience. If you have any objection to anything other than the food (which is impossible) then you should go away and stop trying to imagine you have a brain."}
{"text":"Finally, a great Thai restaurant in Madison! I've tried a few others around town and was disappointed in either the lack of flavor or the excessive heat (spice) that detracts from the food. I found neither of those things at this restaurant. It is a busy place, but with a cozy atmosphere and exceptional wait staff. The food is delicious and the portions extremely generous. Why not 5 stars? I'm a green curry fanatic, and though their's is very good, it wasn't the best I've had. If they had nailed that, it would be 5 stars all the way! Don't miss this place, it's worth it!"}
{"text":"Very, very impressed with Ha Long Bay. The one downside I noticed was the wait time - I arrived with a group of four (plus me) on a weekend night at around 7 or 7:30, and it was PACKED. We had to wait about 45 minutes for a table, which wasn't surprising, but still a bit of a bummer.

Once we were seated, though, everything was great. Service was quick and friendly (especially water refills - you will never go thirsty here). One of my fellow diners was a bit overwhelmed by the incredibly varied and expansive menu, but I'm a fan of having options, especially when it comes to cuisine and restaurants I'm not familiar with. Our food arrived surprisingly quickly, given the sheer amount we ordered -  at least three different appetizers, followed by five different entrees. Everything was delicious, from my mango curry to my friend's pad see-ew with tofu, and we had plenty of leftovers that were still tasty two or three days later. Major bonus for a non-leftover-lover like me!

Long story short: if you're here for a weekend dinner, be prepared to wait quite a while. But if you've got the time to spare, it's definitely worth it."}
{"text":"I lived in Madison for years and while I love that it's known for brew pubs, this place is my favorite. Get the Panang Curry. It is to die for. I literally want this as my last meal on earth. Love that they put potatoes in it. I cannot stress this enough, their food is fabulous. There is often a 30 min- hour long wait for dinner if you get there after 6 pm, but they do have a cooler of beer and Thai tea for you to purchase and drink while you wait."}
{"text":"Awesome food. Great service. Nice portion. The sticky rice with mango is twice the amount as most restaurants as for less price."}
{"text":"Reservations recommended. It was super crowded and loud inside with a long wait time. The menu had over 100 items to choose from - just a bit overwhelming.

We had reservations here, thankfully, as the place was completely packed inside with many parties waiting inside for tables. The entryway was completely jammed with people. 

Once inside and seated, this is your typical Thai/Southeast Asian menu with way too many food items. There are at least 100 different things to order here, which is overwhelming as a customer and must also be a nightmare for the kitchen. An entire medley of Pho varieties, every dish you could expect from a Thai restaurant and then a Vietnamese restaurant all rolled into one.

I went for the larb, Lao-style minced meat salad, and the portion was enormous but the flavor was solidly average. I tried my wife's drunken noodles, one of her favorite Thai dishes, and it was also in the \"okay\" range.

I think given the quality of food here and the overwhelmingly crowded atmosphere, I would hesitate to recommend it."}
{"text":"This is the BEST South East Asian food restaurant in town hands down! They have the best papaya salad and the pho is just amazing! The prices are very nice too so I always order extra to take home too!"}
{"text":"We get there early around 6pm on Saturday and get seated as soon as we enter the door. We are seated  right next to the door which is also next to the window so is pretty nice.

We get veggie curry puff for appetizer and duck curry, drunken noodle with shrimp for entree. Wow. l never know pumpkin in the curry is so delicious! The duck is not crispy as I like though. The drunken noodle is very yummy!

The server is very helpful and friendly.

Only one thing I dont like that much: the air conditioner is not strong enough and since the restaurant is full at dinner time with a lot of people waiting, we got really sweaty after our meal."}
{"text":"Now this place is a must GO TO if you are in Madison. I didn't expect it to be that good, that I actually wanted to come again before I leave! The waiters were great and got us situated very quickly. We did go during lunch hour so it was quite busy. However, the food was served in a very timely matter and the appetizers were amazing! We got the chicken dumplings and the stuffed crab meat wonton . Those are a must try, I really enjoyed it. Portion size is great. I ordered a chicken pad Thai and I couldn't even finish it (they have take out trays available). And I think that was the best pad Thai I love ever had! I would be  
Definitely returning back again."}
{"text":"It took a long time to get seated and to get our food, but given that it was a busy NYE it was understandable. Everything else was great! The Khao pad karee was delicious, the prices were good, and the service was friendly and attentive. They have a wonderful variety of Thai, Lao, and Vietnamese cuisine available.  I look forward to coming back."}
{"text":"I have the best meals here one of my Madison go to Asian restaurants.  I have tried several dishes, all very good, fresh veggies, great spices, great prices. Service friendly. The selections are overwhelming a huge mix of various cultures and flavors for a fantastic assortment to choose from. Good soups, apps, main dishes. So with that and most locals also aware of family run business this place is Busy. But worth any wait. On busy nights take out is 45 minutes. Waiting for tables similarly."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants in Madison. Don't ask me where I want to eat because we will inevitably end up here 100% of the time. The menu is extensive so I admittedly have not tried the majority of the food, but I always find myself craving for their amazing pho, wonton noodle soup, and vermicelli noodle dishes. They also have kickass egg rolls and spring rolls.

I swear they put crack in their food."}
{"text":"Absolutely my favorite restaurant in Madison!!!  I have tried multiple dishes and have loved every single one of them!  My favorite is TE1 with 4 stars.  Always made to perfection!!!  I also highly recommend their plum wine, a bit sweeter than usual, but it is fantastic.  I only live a half block away so we go here often or get take out.  I have never been disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"We carried out and thought the food was just okay.  I think I had high expectations because it's the favorite of many people I know and trust.  I prefer Lao on Atwood. At least on this one night.  

We had curry squash, pad Thai, and another noodle dish.  Spring rolls and chicken dumpling for apps.  All good, but nothing above average."}
{"text":"If you like Thai food, you should come here.
If you are curious about Thai or Vietnamese food, you should also come here.
If you are on the fence about these cuisines, what's wrong with you? It's delicious!
You need to try it one more time :)

Their menu is huge and diverse. I love a place you can try something new every time, repeat 100 times. 

A few faves:
Pad kee Mao
Pad see eew
Panang curry

I just realized that they take reservations, so if you can plan ahead, you can avoid the longer waits. Usually I just find myself on Willy st and then realize that I must have Thai food and will happily wait for it, so I have not taken advantage of this feature yet.

Pro tip: If you can't wait, just down the road, there is another fantastic Thai place, Bahn Thai.  I have never had a wait there and I like it slightly more than HLB."}
{"text":"This place is my go to for Thai/Viet food. It's where info to get a nice bowl of pho when I need comfort food and a great place to go with friends for lunch or dinner. 

Food: Everything I've had here is pretty amazing. Portions are LARGE. I mean three meals worth. I've never finished anything I've ordered because it was SO MUCH FOOD. Plus I always order appetizers. From fried tofu, crab Rangoon, spring rolls...you'll never go wrong with any appetizer. Life changer: spring roll with pork egg roll inside. Must get this...unless your vegetarian. The Pho is the perfect broth and good amount of meat. The pad see ew is great (I'd suggest getting medium spice). I wish they used chinese broccoli but not a lot of wholesale grocers sell it so it's understandable. The curry is perfection--every bite you want more and more. The egg noodles are the same. I can go on and on and on. 

Service: everyone is so nice. They are attentive to fill your water. Personable. Funny. Accommodating. It makes the meal more enjoyable too. 

Location/physical space: located on Willy St = street parking. The restaurant itself has about 6-8 booths with large tables and small tables and some window seating. It's busy at lunch and dinner. The wait on the weekend for dinner is at least 30-45 minutes. Worth the wait. Just put your name on the list, walk across the street to Gib's to grab a drink and then check back in and you'll be seated in 5-7 minutes. Amazing. 

Every bite is a great bite here. Lots of people also order for carry out which is also great. This is my favorite restaurant in Madison."}
{"text":"Service was good. However be aware that there was no AC in this place and it was so HOT!!! Hotter than the outside(85F). Make sure to put on your tank top and flip flops. I had sneakers and my feet were burning because it was so hot inside. Ordered the pork and shrimp spring roll, really liked it, was my favourite dish. Then I had the chicken Pad Thai at the extra spicy. The dish is very big. I can say the spicy level is at most a medium hot in Thai food standard. And the bad thing is that it is WAY too sweet. Almost like I am eating dessert. I got tired of the dish very fast. If you like sweet dish, give it a try. Overall I would give it a 3.5 stars. I will come back to try some of their other dish, but definitely on a cooler day."}
{"text":"My favorite spot for Thai food. Nice variety of Thai and Vietnamese food. Reasonable prices. My only issue: I sometimes get slow and inattentive service when it's not even that busy."}
{"text":"Amazing Thai food! I ordered chicken parang, my go-to Thai dish when traveling. I like it best without basil. Their curry sauce was rich and creamy--not soupy like most Thai restaurants in South Florida. It was so good I had to come back for more the very next day. It took a while for my food to be ready, but it was well worth the wait."}
{"text":"I love the all-inclusive (Vietnamese, Thai, Lao) menu and the decor, and when the place isn't busy the service is fast and friendly. We live down the street so we've eaten here a handful of times since they've opened and we've learned two things: 1) just because they ask you how spicy you want your dish and you say 4 stars, it doesn't mean it will have any actual spice (they forget?), and 2) if it's busy we go somewhere else. The main problem seems to be consistency, both with the service and care with which the food is made. Other than that, I'm happy with their food and have yet to have a dish I didn't like. The pad thai is fantastic; the bun lovely and cool when it's hot outside; the pho deliciously hot when it's cool outside. Most dishes range in the $9-15 mark for dinner and $7-8 for lunch."}
{"text":"Came here the second time yesterday and the food is still as fantastic as always!!

I forgot what I ordered the first time but this time, I tried their pho. Broth is a little bit on the sweet side but still delicious nevertheless! I would definitely come back here with family and friends! Customer service is very good!"}
{"text":"This place is always super busy and I don't really know what the fuss is about. We had the pho here which was not really good at all. It was not authentic and was definitely in the bottom bowls of pho I've had. Next time I come here I will have to try the Thai food because it did look quite a bit better. I will update my review if I ever do decide to come back here again."}
{"text":"Ha Long Bay is always super busy! Try to get here at like 6 and you might be okay to get a table quickly. But they are busy for a reason! Delicious food! One of the few places I actually get take out from. 

Mango curry. Delicious! 

Andrew Zimmern from Bizarre Foods America has been here. And has had the Nem Khao Tod, LS7 (under Laotioan Specialties) which is actually not bizarre and I recommend everyone to try it. The crisy rice in the dish is amazing, reminds of when you get Bi Bim Bap from a korean place and the rice is crisp at the bottom of the hot stone bowl. Well just think of the whole dish being made of that amazingness. 

Also the Vietnamese Beef Stew. Full of flavor. Definitely a nice change of pace from any beef stew I make at home."}
{"text":"I know people love this place, and I get hints of why when I drop by, but there are better places in town (Sala Thai, if you are looking for Thai; Saigon Noodles if you are seeking Vietnamese). 

If you go for lunch be sure to get the amazing soup when they ask soup or salad. I just can't get over how great it is, and generally it makes me all excited for the entree after eating it. Then the food arrives and it is always fairly good or ok, just not great. I've tried many of the things on the menu, and have yet to find one that in any way compares to the soup. So I guess if you go for dinner the answer is to get Tom Yum soup as your entree, and you'll be all set! 

And heads up: I like what would be considered Thai medium in usual Thai restaurants, only here I have to resort to extra hot to get that level of spice (or hot and add hot sauce). I know it is Madison, but that a bit much.. if my Midwest parents are adding hot sauce to things here, you might need to spice things up a bit..."}
{"text":"I love this place. everything I have ever gotten here has been awesome. The Tom kha Ga is my all time favorite. It is basically pho with coconut milk and mushrooms. Yum!"}
{"text":"Sorry folks, no pictures because I was too busy inhaling my food. I went to HLB at the suggestion of a friend who was craving something Asian. I haven't experimented a whole lot outside of your standard Chinese takeout, so the range of cuisines they offer made a good jumping off point for trying something new. 

The menu is vast and can be a lot to take in, but I eventually settled on the peanut chicken from the Thai section. I've had Thai two or three times, but have never managed to find what I tried at the last place on the next menu, so I don't really have a favorite thing to look for. The peanut chicken sounded pretty safe - rice, chicken, peanuts, pea pods, onions, and carrots. I went for two-star spice - I love a good kick but since there's no standardization I'd rather have it be a little too mild than eye-watering hot. 

Despite the dish's humble description, it was a really outstanding meal. The chicken was so tender, the vegetables fresh, and the peanuts added just the right amount of crunch. No idea what all was in the sauce, but I'm in. Next time I might bump my spice selection up a level, just to see - two stars was quite tasty but I think I might like just a bit more. I'm also going to have to try their sticky rice. I've had several friends live in or travel to Thailand and it always looks so delicious. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Ha Long Bay Rocks! Did the carry out tonight. Musamun Curry with Beef, Squash Curry with Chicken, and pan fried dumplings (chicken). Everything is a hit. I've never had a bad meal at Ha Long Bay. Squash Curry is by far my favorite item on the menu. The dumplings are actually made in house. The dipping sauce is a rich soy based sauce. I've been know to sip it off a spoon.  

From my perspective Ha Long Bay has the best curries in Madison. OK, I'll say it - best Squash Curry in North America. I order it medium spicy and like it with a splash of soy sauce and a few dots of so sriracha sauce. The curry itself if silky, the squash tender with a rich flavorful sense of heat. You get to choose your protein on the curries, tofu, chicken, beef or I believe shrimp. 

The menu is gigantic... Make your life simple, just go to the curry page and pick one out. 

Oh you say you don't like curry... It's because you haven't had the Squash Curry at Ha Long Bay. 

Eat local... Explore local eats when visiting Madison or anyplace else!"}
{"text":"I came here a year ago and had an amazing experience but I just went to visit last weekend and was completely unimpressed. For the Seafood Crispy Egg Noodles we ordered, while crispy, the noodles were definitely much less than before and the seafood was almost all completely awful. The shrimp was the only fresh thing about it but the scallops, mussels, and squid were all basically inedible due to the intense fishy flavor. The mussels were also beyond overcooked I think to make it safe for consumption. The squash curry that I normally love was also a little over seasoned with cinnamon. And the fried eggplant tasted stale--like they were just refrying a batch and the sauce was runny and overpowered. Our waitress while polite was incredibly busy and after we asked for a pair of chopsticks it took a good 10 mins for her to return with them. Tragic because I really loved this restaurant."}
{"text":"Best green curry I've had. Everyone at work raves about this place, and for a good reason."}
{"text":"The best Thai in Madison I'm sure and, after enjoying a fair amount of the best Thai Milwaukee had to offer for years, I feel confident saying this may very well be the best Thai food in the Midwest outside Chicago."}
{"text":"They get super busy. At dinner rush you might have to wait an hour or so before getting seated. I still don't know if you pay at the table or front.

5/5 (things you should definitely try): Chicken dumplings and spicy wonton soup.  These are the best chicken dumplings I've ever had. Get them pan fried rather than steamed. The spicy wonton soup is so delicious. The flavors are awesome. Try it.

4/5 (excellent dishes):  HT1 and the Thai red curry. The HT1 is a fried noodle in some gravy sauce with vegetables. I usually get it with chicken and non spicy.  The Thai red curry is more sweet than spicy. Love the creamy, sweet, salty flavors. Mm...

3/5 Good dishes: Pork and shrimp spring rolls. They're okay. I prefer roast pork in spring rolls but for some reason it's ground pork."}
{"text":"This restaurant may have my favorite food in Madison. It certainly is the best Thai/Vietnamese restaurant in Madison- and there are some other decent ones. This one takes the cake. Never disappointed in my order- even when I venture out of my usual. Get the noodle soups (insert salivating emoji)."}
{"text":"This review is for the service only, since after waiting more than 90 minutes for a table, I finally left the restaurant. 

Like other reviewers, I am happy to wait for a table at a popular restaurant on a Friday night. I went with two girlfriends and we had plenty of chatting to do, so I didn't think that our quoted 45 minute wait would be that big of a deal. 

First, while the restaurant is a good size, the area to wait in is not. You are crammed between the door and the counter, and are very close to an entire row of diners. This is awkward for you and also can't be enjoyable for the folks less than five feet from you trying to eat their meal. 

There doesn't seem to be any real system to taking names, keeping track of parties, or giving an accurate estimate of time to wait. We were told 45 minutes and as I said, I finally left after 90. During this time, no one ever checked in with us to give us an update, offer us water, or apologize for the unusually long wait. We were literally  crammed like sardines with our faces in the host's face, being banged in the back by new guests, and got zero interaction from him. The one or two times we did ask how much longer, the staff was rude and unresponsive. 

While we were there, two large parties arrived to be seated. They had reservations and were still told they would have to wait 30-45 minutes. Another woman waited almost 40 minutes for her takeout order. 

I've worked in restaurants as a server and a hostess. I understand busy weekend nights, large parties when you weren't expecting them, a server or cook calling in sick and you're just totally screwed. What I don't understand is why the restaurant never made any effort to communicate with us, apologize to us, anything. A simple update on the status of our table or an offer for a glass of water while we waited would have gone a long way. 

I'm sad that I didn't get to eat here because the food looked delicious, it really did. But I was just totally soured on the rude an inattentive service and the cramped and loud waiting area to ever want to give this place my money."}
{"text":"I've so far only had the basics here, but they have been good every time. I love the pad thai. 
I really like eating at Ha Long bay for more than just the food. It's just a nice place - the interior is nice, the staff is nice. Nice nice nice. Good good good."}
{"text":"Hungover on a Sunday morning? Get to Ha Long. Their pho will wake you up quick and quicken your recovery time with their rich broth and plentiful meats. I'll save you the trouble and tell you to get a PH8 large. Looking for a nice place for dinner? I guess this place works too. Most of the time I come here for dinner, I try to come early to escape the long line that usually starts around 6-7pm. The food is very tasty and hits the spot if you're looking for something very well done. Their squash curry is delicious, their vermicelli noodle dishes are refreshing and their pad thai is almost the best I've had. However, most people seem to come here for atmosphere and conversation. This adds to the wait times and mass crowding. Service is inconsistent, sometimes taking 15 minutes for your order, sometimes 30, but always friendly and courteous. They had everything I asked to accommodate my pho, such as fish sauce and chili paste. Come early to escape the wait or takeout to eat well at home. Come Sunday morning for the cure to your aching hangover."}
{"text":"This place is just OK. 

Parking is Willy St. style. 
Lunch service is fast enough. 
Wifi makes this place work. 
Dinner hour is standing room, wait for a table only and sadly it's not the kind of food to stand and wait for which made me take the crew to Nam's Noodle and found a whole new experience. One sorority sister really wanted Pha and the place on E. Wash is closed or should be listed as CLOSED as the doors never opened in the 90day visit one sister has had here. 

Anywhoo, Pho & apps have been enjoyed 2 out of 3 times. While the first visit, I had: a lunch chicken. 
Extra cilantro no problem. 
The crispy purse item and fried dumplings are good enough. 
Sauces on the table work. They're tasty. 
Booth set up = cute. 
Wifi password upon request. 

It's Pho. Nothing over the moon about the broth just as good as can be but doesn't touch this place in Charlotte, NC, that has shown me it (Pho via the broth) can be better as in great. 

So, you won't lose sleep about a waste of money as it's not bad just nothing spectacular. 

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Excellent Thai cuisine! Came here with my family and got the ginger tea, Veggie Curry and cucumber salad and loved it! I enjoyed that you could choose your spiciness (as I love hot food and my aunt does not) so everyone is happy! Would love to return next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"Expansive menu, traditional dishes, authentic flavors, and unpretentious + down-to-earth atmosphere. What more can you want? 

Ha Long Bay serves up awesome Asian dishes, from shrimp pad thai, to delicious noodle soups and excellent curries. There is really something for everyone here. Plus, the portions are generous for the price, so you are almost always guaranteed some leftovers!

My personal favorites include the Tom Yum and Tom Kha noodle soups, the spring rolls, and the battered chicken Gà Xào Dòn - wow!"}
{"text":"This place is one of my favorites.  The pho is amazing!  I have really enjoyed almost everything I have ordered.  Didn't love the dumplings or the eggplant (Too sweet and kind of heavy for my taste).  Have had a couple of occasions where the service was not great, but the food is so good it hasn't stopped us from coming back.  And there is a wait most of the time to get a table too.  My teenage kids love this place too, so it's a good spot for the whole family to go out together and everyone is happy!"}
{"text":"I came here because of the good reviews on yelp, but I'm disappointed. The food was very mediocre and the service is far from ok. I got here at 1:30 on a Monday afternoon, so it shouldn't be super busy, but I waited for my food for more than half an hour. The two tables that sat down way later than us got their food first. I asked a waitress if they forgot my order, and she said its impossible because all the order was sent to the kitchen in order. I asked, then how come those people got the food before us, and she pointed to a third table and said see they haven't got their food either. But the problem is, those people just sat down less than five minutes ago. That waitress's attitude was terrible. I won't come back to this place again."}
{"text":"This is definitely the best tasting Thai food in Madison."}
{"text":"Ha Long Bay, you're breaking my heart!

My first HLB visit was all pho, and it was cozy and succulent (if soup can be succulent). Last night, we decided to branch out: I ordered the \"bun\" with grilled pork and vermicelli, topped with cucumbers, basil, and mint. And Mr. G mixed it up with a Vietnamese version of phad see ew (egg noodles with beef and broccoli).

I was mildly disappointed because my dinner, a classic Vietnamese dish, wasn't warm at all! I can understand if the vermicelli noodles were cool or room temp--I think this is normal. But the noodles were all clumped together in a sad, chilly mess. And the grilled pork had clearly just been pulled from a tub in the walk-in cooler, already pre-sliced, because it was completely cold and dry. To top it all off, or not to top it off, there wasn't any mint. 

To be fair, we were one of the last tables of the night, and I could hear the kitchen cleaning up immediately after our entrees were served. But I don't pay any less than the person who ate during the dinner rush of 6:30pm, who most likely had a better \"bun\" with warm/hot grilled pork. Therefore, I deserve the same quality food. My advice? Just stick to the pho. 

P.S. It's pronounced \"fuh\" as in rhyming with \"duh\", not \"dough\"."}
{"text":"It's clear why this place receives a decent amount of stars, but I will say that's it's not due to timeliness or good service. Not seeing your server for 10 minutes is really bad. And it happens every time I go in. I've been in 20+ times.

Why go back if it's that bad? Because the food is awesome. Seriously good. Best soups. I love the red curry coconut with bamboo. I always get shrimp. It's a soup to die for.

Another thing is their hosts always look miserable. Yes, you're 17. Yes, you'd rather be out partying, but suck it up. You're lucky to have a job.

Lastly, they once added a credit card tip on a to go order I placed. I was shocked counting on the fact that I had left a cash tip. When I called to settle a woman who didn't speak English answered and eventually hung up on me. Oh well. What can I say? It was a one time thing.

Let's get it straight: in short, ha long bay is the ever famous ha long wait. I'll keep going back for soup, but not for service. Yeah, it's worth the shitty service."}
{"text":"My 10 year old son James LOVES Thai food and he said this is some of the best curry he had ever had!  The menu also has Pho and other yummy dishes.  Reasonably priced and packed on a Friday night.  This place Rocks!"}
{"text":"So after hearing some great things about Ha Long Bay, I finally went tonight and I'm glad I did! We were told it'd be a 40 min wait (there really isn't a good place to wait - everyone was hanging out on the sidewalk), but it turned amount to only be about 20 minutes. We started with some yummy spring rolls; and then ordered Thai Green Curry with 3 stars and Drunken Noodles. Everything was delicious! Service was very good and very fast - plus a nice (but casual) ambiance. I can't wait to try to Pha and everything else! This place definitely deserves all its accolades!"}
{"text":"I was in Madison during the past weekend for a conference. During the last day, we went to get good food after hearing reviews that this was the place for some good fusion Vietnamese & Thai cuisine. 

The menu was fairly extensive and consisted of dishes that ranged from a traditional Vietnamese crepe to Thai mango dessert. The prices looked a little pricey, since extra noodles or meat ranged from an extra $1.5-2. This is interesting, given we are based in the Midwest which typically carries a lower cost of living. Regardless, I was more looking forward to reviewing the food. 

One way to assess a restaurant, specifically Vietnamese, is to sample the Pho Dac Biet - the original pho broth that is used for other dishes. This is the umbrella dish and one that I was ready to try. Unfortunately, I was turned off by the wait times for my order. Pho is one of the fastest dishes to deliver, but it took roughly 30-35 minutes to receive my meal. The root cause is usually some sort of constraint that involves lack of resources or people traffic. However, we were one of the few parties inside the restaurant and staff seemed to be well allocated (family business). 

As mentioned, 35 minutes later, I am greeted with my bowl of pho. The initial taste test and I like it. How can a 300+ review restaurant mess up on pho. However, there was one flaw. The broth was a bit lukewarm and tasted like cold pizza. If the broth was hotter, I would have rated the pho with a 3.5/5. 

Ha Long Bay is a decent restaurant and I would return to try possibly their Thai dishes."}
{"text":"The menu at Ha Long Bay reads like a Southeast Asian version of the Encyclopedia Brittanica. It will keep you occupied for hours, but is utterly confusing, and I started to wonder if I was in Thailand, Laos, Vietnam or actually on Williamson Street in Madison. 

The atmosphere is fun and friendly, and the service was good. The food we ordered was on page 467 and 723 (I can't remember the specific names of the dishes), and, although it was tasty, it was extremely salty. 

We enjoyed the experience, but would prefer less salt and a Reader's Digest version of the menu the next time we go there."}
{"text":"I want to have a long, long, (Long) happy marriage with the squash curry. I left my heart at Ha Long Bay."}
{"text":"I loooove Thai food and have lived on Willy Street nearly my whole life and they've shut out every Thai food restaurant in my eyes.

I usually order the Pad Thai or Pad Lao and it has always been my go to. Their menu is ridiculously huge and you spend longer than you have to reading through but trust me these are the go to's!

Always great service whether it's over the phone or in person."}
{"text":"PROS: Delicious Thai cuisine, great value, good service, open on Sundays!
CONS: Long waiting times

You can tell that the food here is tasty by the sheer amount of people overflowing from the restaurant. The menu features an enormous selection of seemingly authentic Thai and Vietnamese dishes, from which you may have a difficult time picking, unless you enter knowing approximately what you want. I ended up defaulting to my usual Pad See Ew, which is almost always a safe bet at Thai restaurants, and it was great! There were plenty of vegetables -- something that many Asian restaurants choose to forget in their offerings. The waiting times were long (20 minutes to sit + 20 minutes post-ordering) but quite worth it!"}
{"text":"Food is great but as for take out they take forever.  The guy told me it will be 25 mins and it is taking about 45mins to hour"}
{"text":"the best pho (the one with all the meat, entree PH8) ive ever had!!! sucha  cute and authentic restaurant, service was good, also my friends got the mango curry which was DELICIOUS as well! for an app i had the pha goi (pork egg rolls) came out HOT and crunchy and sauce was so good!!! cant wait to go back!!!"}
{"text":"I'm sorry to give you only one star. However: we are visiting this restaurant many times. 
The service this time was completely unacceptable!!!

The server doesn't understand English!!!!!!

We asks for one dish with chicken and the other one with beef......
She wrote both with chicken.....
We ask container for the soup to take the left over home - she trash it!!  
And - when I tried to explain that I'm not happy with the service, she smile and say: \"I don't understand English\"....

It's the first visit in this restaurant that I did not tip - and I want to tip ( i.e.: I deserve good service)"}
{"text":"Well, when the joke's on you, you know it because everyone else is laughing.  In this case, they must have been doing so on the inside.  My original review should have been a clear warning not to make a second appearance, but apparently I'm a glutton for punishment.  The meal began with two narrow chicken egg rolls, whose flavor was reminiscent of a greasy snack from some carnival in downstate Illinois.  A generous bowl of hot and sour soup followed, which was hot enough, but the gelatinous consistency left me sour.  I looked around the full restaurant, where tony East siders' conversations created a din that could have woken a dead person.  The final assault on my culinary sensibility came in the form of a broth infused chicken dish.  I can only hope that the chicken got a full five minutes of sunlight before its existence was summarily cut short."}
{"text":"I ate lunch at Ha Long Bay yesterday.  I was craving Vietnamese spring rolls and bun.  

I've had much better spring rolles (Saigon Noodle), and the bun was mediocre.  My son had the Pad Thai and it was good, although the sweetness overpowered any of the other flavors.  Very little peanut, chili, or lime flavor.  

The vegetable dumplings were fabulous.  By far my favorite part of the meal.

Service was okay.  Our waitress got part of our order wrong, didn't bring us napkins, and didn't check up on us.   We ended up flagging down another server to get our to-go boxes and then went up front to request our check.  The other waiter in the place seemed much more efficient."}
{"text":"Yum yum and yum.  Food is excellent, service is excellent, my favorite!  Every dish I've ordered has been amazing.  Good service, expertly prepared food."}
{"text":"4.75 stars! Vietnamese owner who lived in Lao for sometime. Hit the lunch crowd which was not bad, but not the fastest service (but friendly). Can not talk about the rest of the menu, but do not sleep on the lao dishes...... Outstanding and very authentic. Mok gai and khao meo gai were top notch. Easily stop if in Madison."}
{"text":"I just ate there tonight and had the pad thai with shrimp.  The dish was great and the staff was fantastic.  They even went above and beyond to help me when I got stuck in the snow after dinner.  I love those guys!"}
{"text":"soooooo goood.. best vietnamese/thai restaurant in madison so far. the picture says it all. would have been all gone but it was enough food to fill up 4 grown men."}
{"text":"I really like the squash curry, and my wife likes the pad thai and drunken noodles. The thai iced tea is also good. It can get really busy at times, so prepare to wait for a table."}
{"text":"Great food just get it to go and avoid the crazyness that is dine in there. If you can even get a table."}
{"text":"Best Asian food go-to in Madison. Huge menu and delicious food. Pad Thai and fried rice are our main orders. You get lots of food for a reasonable price.
If you are ordering to-go, leave plenty of time because the wait can be long. The food is so worth it though!"}
{"text":"I read a ton of reviews on yelp, went there, and ordered almost all the dishes that were recommended on yelp. The taste was pretty good. I tried squash curry, mango curry, pad thai, spring rolls, fried rolls, Nem khao tod, Vietnamese crepe (only served in the weekend), all kinds of pho, Coconut sticky rice with mango and ice cream... OMG, I have such a big stomach. It must be a pig who is writing this review, lol Oh btw, chai iced tea is also worth trying. In one word, you can try anything you can find on the menu. I promise it will not fail you. It has a reason to be this POPULAR."}
{"text":"My colleague said all the good things about this place and so one day, we decided to hit this place up.  The place is as advertised.  The food quality is a top notch and they give you more for the price than anywhere else.  

My colleague had the house special #7, beef with asparagus and I had #8, green beans, squash, bamboo with chicken.  It was one of the best Thai dishes I have had in the States.  Of course, Thai people may say all Thai places in the States are not as authentic as places back in Thai but the dishes we had were as good as they get here in the States (especially in Madison).

We also had their shrimp and pork spring rolls with bean sprouts, cilantro and lettuce for appetizer ($3.99 for two pieces) and they were awesome and fresh.  

One thing we noticed though: there was a group of about 7-8 people waiting for a large table and they must have waited for almost 1 hour.  The place seemed to have enough tables for smaller parties but be sure to make a reservation if you are more than 4 people."}
{"text":"Wonderful eatery! The staff is always attentive and courtesies to specific requests. The pho is my favorite by far! It does get busy during lunch time, but if you can stick it out, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"So, do you like sterile suburban American chain restaurants with cookie-cutter decor and food? No? Good, me neither!  And if you're anything like me, you love small, authentic ethnic places that serve amazing food -- and that, preferably, are tucked away in off-the-beaten-path neighborhoods in funky college towns.  If any of this is remotely true about you, and you happen to be in Madison, you must try Ha Long Bay.

My husband and I tried the $7 lunch specials.  These started with cups of Tom Yum soup that were so good, I would have paid $7 for just the soup.  The broth was so deep -- sweeter than I've had before -- and came with cooked tofu and very fresh mushrooms.  My entree was fried eggplant in a spicy-sweet sesame sauce, served with stir fried veggies and rice.  OMG, I cannot tell you how scrumptious this was! If I have to eat at Panda Express anytime soon, I will cry.  My husband got the squash curry with chicken -- cooked perfectly, lots of fresh veggies, VERY spicy, and just awesome.  Did I mention that these mind-blowing lunch specials were SEVEN dollars?

My seafood loving daughter got a huge bowl of soup with seafood.  The seafood (mussels, octopus, scallops) was all cooked perfectly, and the spicy broth was even more flavorful than our appetizer soups.

On top of that, I loved the decor.  This beautiful place was built out of a refurbished industrial space, and it blends into the bohemian neighborhood.  The crowd was great too -- seriously, people from all walks of life gathered together for a perfect lunch. If I lived in Madison, I'd be in once a week."}
{"text":"It's actually a 4 star place, but unfortunately it was hit by a SUV sustained major damage and has been closed for several weeks."}
{"text":"Hands down our favorite restaurant in Madison! My husband loves their Pad Thai and I always get the HS5 - a stir fry with peanut sauce. I can't bring myself to try anything else. There's a wait every time we go - with good reason! Cozy atmosphere - great for a date night, or a fun night with friends or family."}
{"text":"This was a nice spot for a solo dinner. The staff were all genuinely friendly and polite. I had pho tai and spring rolls. As I guessed it would be, the beef was not rare. The only places I've had proper pho tai with rare beef are: Seoul, Chinatown & Queens in NY, and San Diego. The broth was okay."}
{"text":"Duck curry.   Oh my goodness.  
Also squash curry and anything curry. 
Also Tom kha soup.
Also dumplings.
Also their whole flipping menu!"}
{"text":"I waited too long for my egg rolls, and even longer for my Pho. The broth was watery, with only 3 leaves (NOT clusters) of Thai basil, two slices of jalapeno and only a small lime slice on the seasoning plate, which came out a full 35 minutes before I asked where my entree was. It came 5 minutes later, with 2 pho for the table that ordered maybe 10 minutes prior. I was getting ready to leave. Meat was minimal, I never did find the beef tendon, a low cost meat. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Pad si ew
Yellow curry with shrimp
Dumplings 
Cucumber salad
Shrimp and pork plate
Pad Thai seafood"}
{"text":"Enjoyed both the peanut curry and pad see eww. Best thai and Laotian food in Madison."}
{"text":"Easily one of the best places in town! Servings are huge, price is reasonable and it's awesome food all around! Don't be in a hurry if you go to Hong Long Bay. They are a smaller operation with limited staff; however, the wait is definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"This is absolutely the best Pho I've ever eaten. Would go back simply for that, but the sesame chicken my husband ordered along with the Tom Yum soup were stellar as well. We also got the chicken egg rolls, and were not disappointed. Overall, has replaced my previous go-to pho place, hands down. And I'm looking forward to trying the Pad Thai next time we go, which will be sooner rather than later."}
{"text":"The food at Ha Long Bay is very good!
I would give the Pho a 3.5 out of 5. It's good, but that is not what I go here for.
I LOVE their spring rolls. So fresh.
Also, try their TE1, Pra Ram Long Song. The chicken is perfectly grilled with a ginger rub and the peanut sauce is so fresh and delicious with perfectly cooked veggies.
I took away a star because consistency can be a little off sometimes. Although always delicious, there have been slight cooking variances to some of my dishes. Also, it is very crowded during evening and weekend hours, but they do the best they can!
I would definitely recommend eating here!"}
{"text":"LOVE THIS RESTAURANT. Probably one of the best restaurants in Madison. Ive been here maybe 20 times in the last 2 years and I have never had a bad meal here. Everything is always fresh and so delicious. I would reccomend the Veggie Curry Puffs, the dumblings, the yellow curry, the fried rice, pretty much everything. They always seat me pretty quickly, even when its busy. The food comes out hot and fast after you order it. The waitstaff is friendly and engaging. My only hang up would be that there Pho is not my most favorite in town and neither is the Thai Iced Tea but thats ok, I dont ever order those anymore."}
{"text":"Best pad Thai. Okay pho tai. Best curries you will get in town. Usually packed, be prepared to wait"}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite southeastern Asian food in madison.  The big menu can be a bit overwhelming, but that means TONS of choices. They can pretty much make any dish GF, which is good for my wife. Atmosphere isn't the greatest, but who cares the food makes up for it. 

This last visit I had the wonton soup...The broth is GREAT. Along with a noodle dish that I can't remember the name of. 

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Pretty decent Vietnamese/Thai cuisine, especially for Southern Wisconsin, which gives it sort of a \"because it's the only one\" pass on quality. I grew up in Hawaii and was lucky to be able to walk over to China Town and get the highest quality Pho for VERY cheap.  This is one of two places I'll ever go back to in Wisconsin with Pho on the menu.  I didn't give the extra star because the wait is always unbearable, and the restaurant could use a renovation."}
{"text":"So much selection! We've tried a lot already but there's more to try. Not sure if there's a bad entree, we have not come across it yet. The seafood selections can be pricey but worth it. There's always a wait for tables if you don't call ahead. Service can be slow sometimes. And parking is a pain."}
{"text":"Update: After getting this place for carryout (which I HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend) a few more times since my last review, I've updated my rating to 5 stars from 4 stars. The food is simply phenomenal. Again, I really only try their Thai dishes since I'm obsessed with Thai food, but they seem to get every dish right. They give such large portions too for their price point! If you're going to place an order around dinner time for carry out, order about 30 minutes in advance, though!"}
{"text":"Clarification: \"I'm a fan\" is a bit of over statement. But I'm willing to give it a second try. Why? Because their papaya salad - a must order item on my southeastern restaurant outing - was pretty good.

The interior of the restaurant is nice. Like, I'd feel good about taking a date out to a dinner here. However, I echo on other reviewer's take on the service. Slo~oow. So you might want to make sure that there are plenty of conversation topics between you and your friend(s). 

Despite of the slowness, my waiter was incredibly polite and pleasant. I appreciated the cordial smile and friendliness. The order of Tofu in pineapple-ginger sauce and squash curry were pretty good / decent. My squash curry obsessed friend thinks that LaoLao Xiang does the better job on the item than Ha Long Bay. And as I mentioned in the beginning, papaya salad was good, so I was in a good mood at the end of the meal."}
{"text":"Ah I love this place! Best pad thai in Madison hands down. I have only had the pad thai and pho, not too adventurous I know but I crave both fairly often and they are the best here of what I've tried in Madison so far. The menu is pretty extensive though so there are a lot of options for those who aren't creatures of habit like myself."}
{"text":"Ha Long Bay continues to be a standout favorite. Daughter and I had a great dinner here Thursday night as a sendoff before she left for two weeks traveling around the UK.
The food is uniformly great here every time, but the wait can be interminable, historically. We went in expecting this and didn't have a problem with it, as we knew we would fill the time by chatting up a storm.
Amazingly, even though it was super busy, we got seated right away, were served drinks quickly, and got our food in a normal amount of time. We were almost disappointed! Haha
The service was friendly as well, and l just love this place more and more. A true jewel of the east side."}
{"text":"Good duck pho! The atmosphere screams family and comfort, and I like that a lot. I got a lot of lunch served to me, so much that I got back to work late because I wanted to try to eat it all and not take any back but there was just so much great tender meat with nice, though at times a little bland broth. 

Service was ok and atmosphere seemed warm and familial. I even unconsciously censored myself while talking to coworkers, as though I wanted to not offend the paintings on the wall."}
{"text":"Awesome food, always fresh and delicious.  Service tends to be quick and you get your food quickly.  If only they delivered!  So happy to have them in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"I had the drunken noodles about a week ago and wasn't that impressed. We went back yesterday and I had the peanut chicken with rice. WOW! that meal was so darn tasty! Their iced Thai coffee was so good that I had two!"}
{"text":"FANTASTIC Thai in Madison! The Tom Kha noodles alone would make me rave about Ha Long Bay but everything else my group had was awesome as well-even something as simple as fried rice! My friend that brought us here loves their Pho and the others in our group were very happy with the noodle dishes they ordered. Much love for Ha Long Bay, definitely hope to return the next time I visit Madison!"}
{"text":"Place was good, food was good but I gotta take a star away because of the service.  Probably because of the huge crowds of people gathering.  It would be wise to go in at a earlier lunch hour before the crowd arrives.

I got myself the Red Curry Fried Rice with BBQ Pork as my meat in it. Sooooo good."}
{"text":"This place is amazing as long as it isn't too busy. The best pho I've had in Madison. Plenty of vegetarian options."}
{"text":"I came here on a whim because I was in the mood for some sort of Asian food (and I wasn't picky on what kind of Asian food it was). I stumbled onto this place after doing a search on yelp & it had fairly good reviews and from the pictures, the food looked good.

I ordered the wonton soup and pad see ew. The wonton soup came out fairly quickly and it was delicious. It was some of the best wonton soup I've ever had. The pad see ew then came out soon after and it was good (You were able to pick how spicy you want it). From what I've had before - which was salty and too much sauce - this was extremely good. I would highly recommend the pad see ew. 

Would I come here again? Absolutely! I would even bring my friends here too."}
{"text":"i'm pissy that this place doesn't exist in chicago."}
{"text":"It would be difficult to come up with anything that hasn't already been said here. I was introduced to Ha Long Bay on a double-date with some friends who live on the East-side of Madison. Because we live out past the far-west side of town we rarely make it to the Willey Street area. Wow! We were so impressed. Everything was delicious. I had the tastiest pad thai I've ever experienced and it was enough for three meals, for me. The spice level was perfect and the flavors were amazing. I introduced another friend only a few weeks later because I was craving more. I look forward to trying all kinds of new dishes from their vast menu. This is a restaurant we will visit again and again and again.

Yes, they can be very busy and they don't take reservations, but good food is worth the wait. I have found it to be a little louder than I prefer at times, but I do have a low tolerance for noise. The service has been great whenever I've been there, no matter how busy. I just can't get enough. In fact, writing this review is making me crave another trip across town..."}
{"text":"Gotten too big for their britches
Now that Ha Long has been discovered by everyone on the East Side the quality has suffered. Just had a curry that was a big disappointment, the Thai eggplant was not in the dish and the pork was beyond tough. Worse, the guy at the counter could not have cared less. This is the second subpar experience there in a few weeks. There are too many other good places around to bother trying them again. Sad, they used to be a favorite!"}
{"text":"Id give this place 3.5 meaning that it's pretty good. I hardly give out fives and the noise and the speed of service kept the overall experience from a 4 star review. The food was pretty great. I had the pho with meatballs and tripe and flank steak. I don't know I needed all that meat. Broth was good and the pho overall was good. I also got some wings which were a little over sauced but excellent. I LOVE wings and find most I eat at restaurants to be either awful or spectacular. These would be in the latter categories. We went on a Thursday and had to wait ten minutes to be seated. The service was kind of slow but they were clearly very busy so the speed was understandable. Would recommend and would go again."}
{"text":"It's good, middle of the road Vietnamese food. Gets busy at lunch, so come early!"}
{"text":"CASHIER: How was everything?
COREY: Delicious.
CASHIER: Looks like you're new to the area?
COREY: (internally...) Really? 
CASHIER: I mean that's the Chicago skyline on your credit card.
COREY: Oh right. Yeah, I'm from Chicago originally and I've been living in Tucson the past 6 years. I just made the move to Madison and I'm looking for an apartment. 
CASHIER: Oh yeah? Which area... this one is great.
COREY: I've noticed, I'm actually looking around here. 
CASHIER: If you lived close you'd never be far away from Ha Long Bay.

Truth. 

And I won't be. The spring roll sare enough to get me back, as are the mega lunch specials, all of them reasonably priced and served until 3. The staff is super friendly and they rhyme. Common."}
{"text":"Ha Long Bay? More like Ha Long BAE (so sorry for this terrible pun). Like a lot of other restaurants on Willy Street, I haven't prioritized going to here because of the evening and weekend lines but I would 100% recommend trying out Ha Long Bay at some time! I went during a Monday lunch and there was no wait, which automatically makes me so much happier when going to a restaurant. The inside of the place is bright and vivid, with a surprising amount of sunlight inside. All wonderful things for a great start.

Our waitress was very attentive and checked up on us multiple times during our meal, but was not interruptive. I ended up ordering Chicken Pad Thai from the Lunch Special menu since there were so many options! This comes with a choice of cucumber salad or Tom Yum Soup, all for $7.95. 

While I've eaten at other Vietnamese restaurants before, this is my first experience with Tom Yum Soup and it was absolutely delightful. It is a sour soup, but didn't have as much of a bite as normal Sweet & Sour Soup would have. There are mushrooms floating in the broth and they serve it at a perfect temperature for soup. The Chicken Pad Thai came out on a HUGE dish - I was shocked at the portions you get, especially for the price! (Perfect for leftovers.) The noodles were a good consistency, the peanuts were incorporated well into the dish, and it had a nice flavor overall. My only qualm was the actual chicken itself - the chunks were a strange size and it was a little rubbery. My friend ordered the Beef Pad Thai and this would be something I would suggest for others in the future.

We didn't stay for dessert or anything else, but there are a lot of great drink options for those that like Thai Tea, Thai Coffee, or any kind of Asian-flavored drink. This is definitely a place I'd love to come back to and explore the menu more! Thanks, Ha Long Bay!"}
{"text":"Best food + atmosphere for Thai in Madison!

I consider Ha Long Bay & Sai Bai Thong to be the two best Thai restaurants in Madison----however, Ha Long takes the cake when it comes to atmosphere. The place is always buzzing with people (sai bai tends to be mostly empty when we go), they have a young, hip waitstaff and a restaurant with a modern, fresh decor. Although the food is great at either place----the experience is better at Ha Long!

One note---I find their \"spice\" rating scale to be a bit more \"mild\" than the average thai place---so if you like something really hot try emphasizing that you want it *really* spicy instead of just \"five stars\"."}
{"text":"I am baffled at how this place got so many good reviews. We went at 4:45 on a Tuesday for an early dinner, and the place was doing business but not packed. Our waiter was great, but the rest of the dinner was pretty bad. It took a good 45 minutes to get our food (at 4:45!) and when they arrived, they were gross. I had the Hot & Spicy Lemongrass Chicken, which was not spicy in the least (had to douse it with chili paste to get it to taste like anything) and drowning in what tasted like cornstarch-thickened chicken stock. My husband had a tofu and pineapple dish that was so sweet it tasted like canned pie filling. It wasn't the absolute worst place I've ever eaten, but I will definitely never go back. Still on the hunt for decent Asian food in Madison...."}
{"text":"Yup, this place does it for me.

I was in Madison for just a day visiting the infamous Corey D, and we were absolutely starving for lunch. We stopped in with only about 45 minutes to spare, and Ha Long Bay ended up being a really excellent choice! Thai heaven happening here (as well as Vietnamese and Laotian.)

First of all, the menu is huge. You're going to need a good few minutes to decide what you're going to order. For the sake of time (and because it's my absolute favorite), I quickly decided on the yellow curry lunch special with a cucumber salad on the side. 

While we were waiting, there was a pair next to us that got their food extra spicy... we were coughing all the way from our table! That's really the only negative thing I have to say here... it was so, so smoky in there and my hair even smelled like curry for a while after I left. They definitely need to do something to improve ventilation! Regardless, our lunch happily went on.

My lunch was everything I wanted it to be -- the cucumber salad was excellent, and my yellow curry with chicken was perfectly spicy and full of flavor. I seriously didn't want to stop eating.

We paid our bill (which was so cheap - $16 and change for two lunch specials) and were on our way. This place is so good, and I'll be stopping in during my next visit to Madison!"}
{"text":"AMAZING!

Tom Kha soup is one of the best things I've ever eaten!

Pad see ew is so comforting and delicious!

Boyfriend loves the Pad Thai mostly because it's one of the only places he needs to ask for a to go box"}
{"text":"Seriously the best Thai food I've had.  I consider my self spoiled because I live in California near LA and we have tons of great food but this was bar far the best Thai food I've had in a long long time.  Can't go wrong with Pad Thai Chicken and that was on point.  I got the Mango Curry which sound delicious and it was.  When I'm back we're going again.  :)"}
{"text":"WOW. I came here with my Mom as we are both huge lovers of Vietnamese and Thai food. Delicious flavors and huge enough portions to share. In addition, their Thai iced tea is particularly delicious. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"The food here is so good! We sampled 6 entrees with a larger group and loved them all. Dumplings, crab Rangoon all excellent."}
{"text":"I have yet to come here and be disappointed. Even when they're packed, and there's a wait, it's absolutely worth it, because I know the food is going to satisfy. 

They hands down have the best crab meat wonton in Madison. No competition. Their spring rolls are always fresh, and the perfect texture. Their curry puffs are also worth noting. Tonight I tried the dumplings. I don't know what wrong I committed in my previous life that made me come here so often before, and only just learn of them tonight. It should be noted that everything I've listed are appetizers. They have other actual meals that are exactly as great as you'd expect based on your starters. 

I'm not going to do them a disservice by trying to name the dishes I've tried, I'd spell them wrong and we'd all be sad. I will say that if you like tofu, or are vegetarian/vegan, this is where you're going to want it from. The tofu is crispy and perfect. Great texture. (I can't do silken or soft, so your milage may vary) Any of the fried rices are good, and I remember being very fond of their pho. 

One of the most important things for me is how knowledgeable they are about their menu. I have yet to be accidentally served nuts, which when trying any kind of Thai cuisine can be a little tricky. 

I will never turn down eating here."}
{"text":"Food is very good. The reason I'm giving it three stars would be the service. I have waited for a long time just to get my drink order taken several times. I tried to understand that there was a lot of people a few times but then I went when there was not many customers at all and it still took forever for someone to come by our table. Other than very slow service it's a place with pretty good food."}
{"text":"As others have mentioned, Ha Long Bay has the best Tom Kha I've ever had. When I first moved to Madison, this was my go-to restaurant. Amidst all of the bar food here, HLB was like a breath of fresh air.

The wait can get a little ridiculous, especially after 7 on weekends, but you can't exactly blame them for having lots of customers. I would just try to get there as early as possible, especially with a large party. As for other noteworthy dishes, I'd order the curries. I've tried many of their noodle dishes, and they all seem to taste very similar with very few distinctions between them (typically just ingredients or type of noodle)-- Perhaps this is because they have a crazy amount of noodle dishes to choose from. 

But all in all, HLB is one of the best, if not the best, SE asian restaurants in Madison."}
{"text":"We just walked out of this place hungry.  We ordered a pho soup, the Nem Khao Tod, and a Thai coffee.  Took over 45min.  Everyone around us ordered, ate, and some even left.  Within that time we asked two servers about our food.  They said they'd check on it; nothing.  We finished or coffee, left hungry, and that was that.  Our server was Kristy,  Crissy, or Chris... what happened?  This is how you treat hungry customers?  I guess you guys don't want our business."}
{"text":"My father and I went to this place on a Sunday night. We had a bit of a wait because it was quite busy but it didn't take long to seat us. Service was fantastic, food was tasty and in large portions, and the price was great for the amount of food that we got. There were many menu choices that it was hard to pick just one. We will definitely be back to try some more things."}
{"text":"To begin with, I love coming here. I feel it's always hard to find a good Asian restaurant that has bounty of vegetarian options which I absolutely adore. 

Like the other reviews have mentioned, the menu is quite extensive and has many options from choose from. No matter what you get, you will enjoy it. I personally love their yellow curry with tofu and their pad Thai with tofu. My friend raves about the Pho the serve and gets it every time she goes here. In addition, they have lunch specials Monday through Friday from 11-3 PM. The lunch specials includes an appetizer so it is a great way to get a bang for your buck. 

The restaurant is cozy, yet it can get quite noisy when it is busy. That is the only complaint I have! The decorations and atmosphere is great. I love how the have a variety and tables and booths as well. 

Also, the service is impeccable. My friends and I always feel taken care of when we come in."}
{"text":"I've been here whenever I crave Vietnamese/Thai food and it's on point most of the time. The food is great (on average), the atmosphere is casual and pleasant, and the food is reasonably priced.

Their curries and the other Thai dishes that I tried so far were great. I had mixed success with their Pho, but hopefully this is a one-time issue. The restaurant does get busy during peak hours and a few times, I found the wait/service to be a bit intolerable. But, this is a popular place for many locals living around Willie street; they either dine here or order take-out. I think it's a great option for those who are in the area and craving Thai food and I would certainly visit again if I'm in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"I love this place. I have never gad a bad experience here. The food  is so good it hits every umami receptor.When food cravings hit you will find yourself returning again and again. Dare I say, it is un-pho-getable!"}
{"text":"One of our favorite ethnic restaurants!

We always end up coming to Ha Long Bay to eat with big groups of friends & I always order the same thing: the fried eggplant! It's a pretty indulgent meal, but it's so worth it.

I've also had bites of friends' Pad Thai & drunken noodles, which are also so good! The service is also friendly & mostly quick. The only time I've seen things go slowly is when we ask to split the bill."}
{"text":"Love this place service is unbelievable there is this one server Sammo that is literally the best server/captain I've ever encountered.  6 stars you need to go here!  Ask for sammo!  Food is so good literally the best!!"}
{"text":"Great Vietnamese. I had the Bun and it was very tasty and authentic. I'd prob eat here three times a week if I lived closer."}
{"text":"Visiting Madison from California, and it taste just like home. We got chicken pad Thai, Vietnamese shrimp fried rice, chicken eggs rolls (a little greasy but well worth it! So yummy), and spring roll. The shrimp fried rice was spectacular definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"My favorite Thai restaurant in Madison. All of their appetizers and soups are delicious. The wait staff is super nice. You also get a ton of food meaning leftovers for a few days."}
{"text":"Daaaayyyuuuuummmmmmm this place is good. 

So let me tell you what's up....

I got off work and I originally wanted chicken wings, but my girl don't eat meat. All cool, all cool right

BUT BAAMMM it hit me. Where can we both get food.

Ha Long Bay P.A.B

We order over the phone for pick up and the girl had no idea what fried tofu I was talking about and I had no idea what I was talking about so NOONE had any idea what we were talking about. So we just got Fried tofu and white rice. Some egg rolls, cause you know. Imma do me.

And I got chicken fried rice for me, OMG. This food was(what's the word these damn youngins use?) FLAME, that means spicy right?? Oh well

Sh*t was gooder as f^[k

Deff coming back

Peace out M town"}
{"text":"It's usually very busy and it sometimes takes a little time to get your food. That's the only negatives. The positives? The staff is very friendly, and the food is amazing. Very reasonable pricing, this is simply the best Thai / Vietnamese food I've ever had in a restaurant. I love restaurants like this that allow you to choose spiciness level as well, because I love spicy food. A \"4\" is noticeably spicy, a \"5\" might be too much for some. Overall I really can't say I've ever had something here that wasn't delicious. The menu is huge too. Highly recommend this establishment."}
{"text":"Ha long did it take me to write a review for this glorious place? Answer: too long.

When I want comfort food, this is where I go. The thing I always get is the yellow curry with tofu. The tofu is sliced up perfectly, the curry is seasoned so well and you can add the level of spice to your liking. I highly recommend this dish, it's delicious.

The curry puffs are a really good starter- they are a bit oily but burst with flavor. 

I've also gotten the pho from here. This is another super tasty dish from here. It's a pretty large serving and comes with all the classic fixings (jalepeno, sprouts, lime, etc).

I've dined in a couple times but I mainly do take out. It doesn't take very long to be ready and everything is neatly packaged. Even the pho is packaged really well!

I will always recommend this place and I'll keep coming back!"}
{"text":"I went with my family for dinner and got the Pork Wonton Egg Noodles. They came in a large bowl with lots of broth and some thai basil on the side to add to taste(I added all of it). The positives were the broth was excellent, full of flavor and boosted further when you add the thai basil. Second the \"Wontons\" although more like pot stickers were flavorful just as much as the broth. Lastly the egg noodles were cooked perfectly providing a good base for the rest of the components. My cons were the temperature and how hard it was to eat all the components of the dish together. I will say they when I did manage to get a piece of wonton with the noodles and the broth it was fantastic. In the end separately everything was good just hard to eat together as one bite.

P.S. The dish I described is also available with chicken or shrimp as the protein."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with Ha Long Bay.  Their menu is 500 pages long and their service is great.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Best Pad Thai in the Madison Area. They also prepare tofu very well- bite size pieces that are thin enough to pick up great flavor. They are pretty good with carry out but usually hard to get a table for dine-in service because they're so busy. I just wish they had more online ordering options."}
{"text":"I don't quite get the hype about this restaurant. I really wanted to love it but it is just sub-par. I've been here over 10 times and never have had something I've loved (I go with friends who are a fan). The first thing I try at thai restaurants are usually curry. Theirs is too thin and grainy for me. Bahn Thai has much better curry. Their stir-fry dishes are undercooked and too salty or too sweet. The Pad See Ew is okay, but the noodles are too soft and not caramelized properly. Their Pho is pretty good. If I go, this is what I usually end up ordering. Their fried rice dishes are also alright. 

Nevertheless, this place is insanely popular. There are usually long waits and it takes quite a while to get your food. If it were good food, I'd say the noise, the wait, and the crowdedness is all worth it but I honestly believe there are more under-rated and better quality restaurants on Willy Street (Bahn Thai, Monsoon Siam)."}
{"text":"I honestly don't think anything I might write will do this place justice. Every thing I've ever had here has been amazing. Sure, it's super crowded and you might have to wait a considerable amount of time for a table or your to go order, but I assure you, it's well worth it."}
{"text":"There are a few servers/hosts who are so remarkably rude- I am convinced that they do not want anyone to actually eat there. Yesterday I was served the worst meal ever (the sauce was broken and curdled) and before the meal was served the host cleared the empty appetizer plates by putting dirty plates from other customers on our table and then placed our plates on top. When I mentioned it- it was as if I had done something wrong. Some people take a big risk by going out to eat and it is usually worth it so that an hour can be spent with loved ones. This place was not worth it."}
{"text":"This was my third time visiting, first time reviewing. I've had a variety of dishes from rice noodle to curry to pho, and have loved everything I've had here.

On this trip, I had the pad see ew with chicken. The sauce was a perfect balance of sweet and salty, with lots of crunchy vegetables and perfectly cooked wide rice noodles. Did I mention this place serves Spotted Cow? You've got to love a Thai restaurant embracing Sconnie culture - win win for sure.

I will keep coming back, again and again, as this place just doesn't disappoint."}
{"text":"Without hesitation, I get the Tom Kha (sometimes Tom Yum) Soup and Duck Curry every time. The curry sauce is the best and you can get it at different spice levels, and comes with squash, green beans, and tomatoes. Only downside of this place is that it is ALWAYS packed, resulting in wait time even for lunch on a weekday. Hoping they can move into a bigger space soon!"}
{"text":"Pho on a cold dreary evening is such a perfect way to end the day.  My husband and in-laws walked to Ha Long Bay after a cold and wet walk.  We opened the door to a warm, cozy and deliciously fragrant room with the hustle and bustle of a great neighborhood place.  We ordered the chicken spring rolls, dumplings and green papaya salad to start-everything was just great!  Three of us ordered the pho and the steaming hot goodness lifted our spirits...the duck curry was generous and everyone agreed we'll need to come back soon.  The service was excellent-our host was friendly and our waitress was helpful and efficient.  Ha Long Bay has really made an impression-I cannot wait to return!"}
{"text":"It seems this restaurants it serves both Thai and Vietnamese food. The deco reflects such as well. Towards the front of the restaurant or some well lit tables with some large windows. Towards the back is more dimly lit tables for the more romantic atmosphere. 

There is a very large selection of foods from appetizer to entrées to desserts and even drinks. I had ordered the steam chinking dumplings. They were 6 of the biggest dumplings stuffed with a lot of meat. The grilled pork chops and lemongrass was very juicy and tender. One of the better ones I've had. I'm going to have to try the pho and Thai curry next time."}
{"text":"Amazingly large and diverse menu. I had one of their specialty dishes, a Vietnamese veggie mix with shrimp added, hot. Served with rice, it was amazing. Great service and ambience. Def need to get back here to sample more of their huge menu!"}
{"text":"It was the best of times, it was the worst of times.... Ha Long Bay has my favorite Thai food in Madison, but I never go in person anymore. I only ever order takeout and pick it up. I absolutely recommend this route, bc the food is great, but I can't recommend the restaurant to anyone without a warning: the service is so, soooooo slow. Long waits to get seated, zero space to wait in (more than ~3 people and you have to wait outside), and hideously slow service once you're seated. Not rude, not inaccurate (in my experience), just infuriatingly slow. DO NOT GO IF YOU'RE ON A TIGHT SCHEDULE!

And when you do manage to get your check at the end, go pay it at the register. You'll avoid another wait AND you can pick up a few of the lychee hard candies from the big bowl. Those things are delicious, and you deserve them."}
{"text":"This has always been my favorite place of having curry! They also make good pad thai."}
{"text":"Came on a Saturday expecting the delay we read about on reviews. While packed, we waited only ten minutes. We were a party of two.
The spring rolls were fantastic and I tried Pho for the first time. It was phenomenal! My wife says she will be coming here for take out at least once a week.
Do not worry about the possible wait...try this food!"}
{"text":"Delicious!!!! We've been here many times and try something new each trip and everything has been amazing. For appetizers, the curry puffs and dumplings are so flavorful! The pad Thai, or any curry are my favorite entrees. But you can't go wrong with whatever you order!"}
{"text":"I'm currently living in Tel-Aviv and I'm dreaming about this place. When back and forth between Madison, I've been known to go here 2 - 3x a week. Not bad for someone who finally went in for the first time in celebration of his 24th Birthday the previous December. I've had my fair share of Vietnamese and Thai in Madison/Chicago and Tel-Aviv (places like Sa-Bai Thong in Madison, Thai Bowl in Chicago, Fresh and Giraffe in Tel-Aviv, and Kim's Noodle in Madison's suburb of Monona come to mind), but nothing compares to Ha-Long Bay. This place is on the radar of many in the area, and seems to have lost its indie feeling quite quickly as many days of the week (especially at dinner/on the weekends), it can be quite packed. It's a family owned place, and you can see that the family really does take pride in the food, and recognizes the regulars. Anything on the menu will definitely make you happy."}
{"text":"I know what the problem is. I expected too much. Between the Yelp reviews and the locals recommending this place, my expectations were too high. 

RED CURRY FRIED RICE -
Ordered with tofu, no egg, no mushrooms, and level 5 spice (their highest spice level). I expected lots of flavor, especially with the addition of the red curry, but I was extremely disappointed with its lack of flavor.  It also lacked spice. If level 5 had no spice, I can't imagine what level 1 and 2 are like. 

MANGO CURRY (TC9) -
Ordered with tofu and spice level 5. Their tofu is too spongey for my liking. The flavor itself was just ok. I thought a mango curry would bring some exotic sabor, but it didn't... Aside from the pieces of fruit, it didn't stand out from a regular red curry. The spice was good in the curry though.

PAN FRIED DUMPLINGS -
Fried dumplings, filled with veggies and served with sweet & sour sauce. They were pretty good. 

CURRY PUFFS -
Now these were delicious!! Crispy pastry puffs filled with curried potatoes and served with sweet and sour sauce. They were the highlight of the meal, and the only item that I'd recommend. 

Aside from the Curry Puffs, this place just doesn't hold up to the hype. Nothing was extraordinary, flavor was lacking in all of the entrees that I ordered, and the service received from the hostess during my carry out process left much to be desired.  At this time, I just can't see myself wasting my time or money returning for mediocre food."}
{"text":"I have been to many Vietnamese restaurants and personally love curries and pad thais. Although I wasn't completely blown away by the my order, it was a pretty good Vietnamese place for Madison. I had the squash curry and their chicken pad thai after reading all the raves and reviews about it. I am not a huge squash fan, but I figured to try it anyways. The texture of the squash was not for me, but the sauce is spot on! I paired it with Roast Duck, and that was the highlight kf my meal!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times with friends and with my boyfriend just most recently and it's usually always crowded no matter what time of the day. Although coming right after work typically means no wait and being seated right away. 

There was a slight light situation where some of the light fixtures needed replacing but once the light was replaced, the place went from being a dimly light romantic restaurant to a slightly more light. 

The shrimp pho that I got was surprisingly topped with some baby bok-choy. Normally when I ask for no toppings of green onions, white onions or cilantro, it's always just plain noodles and meat with the broth but I do actually like veggies so I was happy that it was topped with some veggies! 

The waiter must be new because halfway through eating our meal, he just came and dropped off our check. Granted, we were in a rush to finish, but it always leaves a strange feeling when the waiter drops a check without saying no rush (as if there's a timer on the table and we have to leave soon). 

All in all, the food was still delicious and typically some of the more veteran waitresses are really nice so I enjoy coming by whenever we get the chance!"}
{"text":"Very good food but the service is terrible, they regularly forget you order, and you end up waiting no less than 45 minutes. The veggie dumplings are good enough that I used to go every now and then in spite of it all, but lately the service has gotten to be too unpleasant to justify it."}
{"text":"Ordered mango curry, curry fried rice and something similar to egg rolls. They were all really delicious and a lot more than we expected for the price. It was a little too crowded so we ordered take out. 
I would definitely want to give it 5 stars but our fried rice was a little burnt. Other than that, really delicious food!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were driving through Madison and we we're die hard pho fans so we stopped by and was so amazed at this place. Chris got Pho Tai and I got Pho with meatballs. They were crazy large portions, the soup was amazing, and the noodles were perfect. We also got Thai iced tea with cream and it was so good that Chris actually got another one to go. After 2 bowls of Pho, Spring rolls, and 3 Thai iced tea, the check only came up to $25.00! 

If you don't like Vietnamese food they had a large menu range for Thai food also. The service was amazing and the place was great. Most definitely going to go back!"}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong, there was nothing wrong with the chicken steamed dumplings or chicken pad thai I had. They were both tasty, just didn't blow me away as I had hoped. Of course, I understand that I probably ordered the most \"watered down\" options this menu had to offer, but I was traveling for work and had a serious craving for pad thai. This restaurant came highly recommended by the hotel concierge as well as my colleagues I was in town to meet. I got there at 9pm on a Wednesday and the line was out the door, seriously, out the door. That's a great sign. The photos on the wall were of the restaurant crew alongside Andrew Zimmerman (of bizzare foods and other notable foodcentric shows), another great sign. Hence my utter excitement to chow down on what was sure to be the world's best pad thai. I think that's where it went down a few notches. It was good, not the best in the world; but again, I completely take responsibility for the fact that my order was lame."}
{"text":"I'm writing this from MPLS. I miss The Bay (how devotees say it). This is the best Thai food in Madison and perhaps in the Midwest. I was literally addicted for 5 years ordering takeout almost every Sunday. 

Get the pad see ew, pad thai, green curry, any curry, and soup......"}
{"text":"Would rate a 0 if can. Had reservations and was seated right away but had to wait 30 mins just for drinks and over hr for food. service was horrible. restaurant wasn't even busy also."}
{"text":"Fresh ingredients friendly service. I'd describe it as delicious and perfect every visit!"}
{"text":"This is one of the busiest places to get Vietnamese, Lao, and Thai food, I do enjoy many different dishes that I try here except the service is always a hit or a miss for me.  I always say that if you have 2 hours to kill then you can go to Ha Long Bay because it gets very busy and it does take awhile to get your food. The food is usually very good but there are very few times that I've been here and gotten out within an hour and a half."}
{"text":"I have been going to Ha Long Bay for the last five years. Food is consistent. Service not so much. It's a very busy place at lunch hour and over the weekend. Be prepared to wait for a table, particularly on Friday and Saturday nights. Not uncommon if you wait over an hour. 

Servers will get it on the table don't expect pleasantries or being made to feel like your business matters. Food is ok better than average. Not amazing. 

Today is was there for lunch. Unfortunately I got the least interested server they have. With restaurant clear after lunch rush I waited for 20 minutes to have my order taken. It comes with soup. As I watched my server count money. He brought soup 15 minutes later. Lunch came out shortly thereafter. He got my order wrong. I ate it having only 10 minutes before I had to go back to work. He brought my bill before I was finished. I placed the money on the table. Now he moved quickly for the first time. He made change at the table and stood nearby waiting for a tip. I left 10% reluctantly. I had barely walked away when he immediately returned to the table to get my tip. I spoke to the owner as male server came over to listen to my concern. No understanding. Owner told me to ask for another server the next time I come in. 

This male server has been horrible on past visits as well. No apologies given. I was late getting back to work. 

Assuming I'll be back to ask for another server was a stretch. Service will leave a bad taste in your mouth"}
{"text":"First off, I'm from San Jose California and spent a number of years in Madison while my husband went to medical school. I was very disappointed in the Vietnamese food selection until Ha Long Bay opened. I felt right at home and then some. Not only did they have Vietnamese food but also other Asian fare that is sort of like Thai, Cambodian, etc. The flavors reminds me of home with a slight twist that is unique to this restaurant. Portion size is good for price and I love that they offer choices of chicken, shrimp, tofu, etc. for the same dish. The staff is wonderful. We go there twice a week and they eventually remembered us. They would give us complementary desserts or let us try something we don't usually order. I'm so glad they did because I would never have tried Nem Khao Tod on my own and now it's one of our favorites! Other dishes we love is the crispy noodles, shrimp fried rice which has a nice smoky aroma, ginger chicken and curries. Not everything is great. The thai ice tea is too sweet and the pho is OK (can't compared to San Jose, but good enough to satisfy my pho craving). Wanted to give it 4.5 star but that's not possible so decided on 5 stars. Why 5 stars if the pho is just OK? In context, it is the mid-west and it is the best Vietnamese/Asian restaurant in town, and when the dishes are good they are really good and some are better than in San Jose. Now that we've moved I really miss this restaurant. When we go back to visit, we're definitely stopping by."}
{"text":"Go off the beaten Pad Thai path and enter the world of some amazing curry. Fresh and amazing food that's perfectly prepared. I love their squash curry. Affordable and delicious every time."}
{"text":"Hire some staff!!

Good food if you can tolerate waiting 45-60 min. to get it after being seated, consistently wrong orders, part of the table being served 30 min. apart from the others, a 30-45 min. wait beyond the designated carry out time and no responsibility taking on the part of anyone who works there, ever. Go there for lunch if you want the experience, hope for a slow day because this has been going on like this FOR YEARS!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice now and I've gotten the same thing twice because I tend to get the same thing always if it is yummy.

I got pho, the one with the tendon. The broth is the best part of it. They are also very generous with the beef. The sprouts aren't the freshest, but they get the job done. 

My boyfriend ordered the Chicken Pad Thai with spiciness level of 4. The sauce was very spicy but also a little sweet. It was kind of like ketchup but not. The chicken was a little dry but I'm not an expert on chicken.

Do try the Thai Iced Tea. It tastes just like a milkshake. It's probably unhealthy, but hey, live a little. It's too cold out to go to the beach anyway, so eat everything."}
{"text":"I live just a few blocks from Ha Long Bay, and have been there several times.  I was there about a week ago with my boyfriend on a Sunday at 1:45pm, and the place was packed.  I thought our lunch might take a while, but it actually came super fast.  I can say with confidence that they serve the best pho in the willy street/downtown area by far.  The broth is savory, flavorful, and delicious.  The noodles are done well, and the meat is tender.  The service is always friendly and quick, and the prices are really affordable.  I love that my boyfriend and I can go for lunch, get 2 glasses of wine, two appetizers, and two entrees all for less than $35 dollars.  My only criticisms are that the pork and shrimp spring rolls are not the best I've had, and I don't understand the nuts? in them.  Also, they don't put chopsticks or fish sauce on the table unless you ask.  It's no problem asking for these items, but personally, I think they should be put on the table as staple items.  Aside from the tiny things I find wrong with Ha Long Bay, I think it's an awesome restaurant, and will dine there many more times in the future!"}
{"text":"So after a year hiatus due to the unfortunate experience we had, my wife and I started going back to Ha Long Bay.  Usually willpower for me would say otherwise, but the food here is just too good.  

Fortunately the service, while still agonizingly slow, has improved.  The waitstaff is much more pleasant to deal with, they've hired some new faces and everyone seems polite.  

So I'm upping them back to 4 stars, because simply put, they still have the best Asian cuisine in town and no one else really comes close.  During my hiatus I had a chance to try Bandung and Lao Laan-Xang, both of which are pretty good in their own right, but nothing in Madison IMO tops the Ha Long.  If you haven't been, hopefully you will make this an immediate life choice.  You won't regret it.

Just do not plan to be anywhere right after. . ."}
{"text":"The squash curry at Ha Long Bay is delightful. 

Once you've had a taste of this red curry sauce, there's no turning back. It's been known to convert non-curry fans into true curry addicts. This is truly a feel-good dish that's packed with flavors that will warm the soul. The gentle medley of spices will have you hooked at first bite and will leave you craving that flavor like no other. 

Within the curry is a great blend of zucchini, Thai eggplant, bamboo, basil and, of course, squash. Ha Long Bay incorporates both acorn and butternut squash into this dish, and these components are the star of the show. They retain their lovely flavor while also absorbing a good amount of the spices from the curry, which makes for a hearty yet healthy meal. 

Addicts beware."}
{"text":"Terrific wait staff equipped with excellent recommendations, amazing food and attentive care. I cannot wait to return to Ha Long Bay! Their signature dishes are truly memorable and delicious!"}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings for Ha Long Bay. As a Vietnamese woman who grew up in heavily-populated Vietnamese communities in Southern California and Houston, my sentiments for Vietnamese food comes from a very special place in my heart. That being said, Ha Long Bay is good, but not a 2-hour wait good. I want to support the Asian food scene that is growing in Madison, so I wouldn't deter anyone who wanted to come eat here.

Additionally, I find it strange that Ha Long Bay (named after one of Vietnam's natural wonders) is heavily known for their Thai food. My mind was boggled when I would hear peers say they went to a Vietnamese restaurant and ordered Thai food--two completely different cuisines. I just wish Ha Long Bay would highlight their Vietnamese roots more, but I digress."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in Madison!!! So many options, such amazing food! Can can't say enough good things about this place!"}
{"text":"This is probably the best or second best place to get Vietnamese/Thai food in Madison. They have a wonderfully diverse menu. I love the soups and anything involving peanut sauce. The Thai tea and coffee is also divine. Expect a wait almost always for dinner, but can be a good spot for lunch as it has shorter waits."}
{"text":"Went this past Saturday which was also Valentine's Day. Very packed. However the wait was well worth it. Thirty minutes easily turned into an hour and a half. 

The boy and I were famished by the time we got our table so we ordered two appetizers; the tofu pan fried dumplings and the chicken spring rolls. The dumplings were ok. The chicken spring rolls were phenomenal. I have never had such flavorful, tasty spring rolls from a restaurant before. I also loved the home made dipping sauce that came with them. And the spring rolls were a great value at two for 2.50. I also tried the Thai iced coffee. It was pretty good as well but you can't really mess that up. 

Now for the entrees. The boy ordered the chicken egg noodles birds nest and I ordered the chicken squash curry. Both dishes were amazing. We were both glad that this place was not stingy with their chicken by using more veggies. 

Our whole meal (two appetizers, one iced coffee, two entrees) came to 32.50. Back home that total is unheard of for such great quality for food. But, if they ever did raise their prices I'd definitely be back; as long as the food quality did not go down. 

One side note: with the popularity of this restaurant I'm surprised that they have not added on to it (second floor) or added another location. I'm sure either or both would be beneficial to the owners and patrons."}
{"text":"Food is great! Not authentic Asian, but still lots of flavor and variety. Service is good and steady. Wait times are really bad on the weekends, upto an hour sometimes. The estimates aren't really accurate, but if you're craving Asian and don't want to hop on a flight for 24 hours, this is a pretty good stand in."}
{"text":"Ha long bay needs to work on the service. The wait time (from waiting to be seated) until the food comes is longer than one hour!!!
Last night was the worst experience that I ever had in Ha Long Bay. While it was not weekends, this place was full and had a long line of queue. Okay, this is a good thing. The bad thing was that our waitress seemed to forget our order, which took him more than one hour to bring our food (note that I paid attention to other customers coming much later than us and they had the food earlier than us). I complained to the waitress by telling him politely that it took more than one hour for our food to come. He said sorry but that was it. He did not seem to care. He never had come back to refill our glasses. He never came back to even ask how our food was. Really? I am really sorry to say this but he needs to work on his attitude. 
I know this place has become a hit these days, but it doesn't mean they can treat their loyal customers for granted. 
I am so disappointed."}
{"text":"Ha Long Bay is a phenomenal restaurant. The food is consistently excellent.  I never knew food could taste this good. The recommendations from the staff were very helpful. Best Pad Thai I've ever had and the mango curry is to die for."}
{"text":"looks like this was the hottest asian restaurant on yelp for madison, so we had to check it out. when we walked in, the line was really long (a great sign), so we sat in the corner to wait a bit. together we ordered a pad thai, yellow curry, shrimp fried rice, and tom kha. pad thai seems to always be a safe option, and it was as good as expected. the yellow curry was not as sweet as i usually like it. and the tom kha ... well, it was my first time trying it. i wanted to be adventurous and try something i haven't tried for a change. a bunch of people here on yelp said it was good, so i went for it. turns out to not be quite my taste. it was a little sour. but i can't say it was bad, just not my thing. 

the menu was HUGE though ... and for now i give it 3 stars, but when i visit madison again, i may want to check it out again to try something different next time. i really wanted to try EVERYTHING on the menu, so im extremely hopeful that next time it might hit the spot."}
{"text":"OK food. Ambiance is what you would expect from a mid-tier asian restaurant. Don't get anything that goes beyond the obvious, we had misses every time. Pho not as good as Saigon Noodle."}
{"text":"all the dishes i've had here are excellent! it is a bit expensive & usually super busy so the wait is typically pretty long, hence the 4 rather than 5 star raiting."}
{"text":"I came here with local friends in the middle of a long day of work and activism. I ended up ordering quite a bit because I knew that I wasn't going to be leaving town until around 10 or 11 p.m. The papaya salad was the low point of the meal; it was a tiny bit bland and sweet for my taste, but it was still on the \"good\" side of what I was expecting. The egg rolls were great; I got to steal one from a friend, and the dumplings were some of the best I've had. The squash and chicken curry was amazing. I think it was the best curry I've ever had. The squash was sweet and was a perfect accompaniment to the curry sauce. 

Also, I think it's important to note that, post gallbladder surgery, I can't eat spicy foods without getting sick. Everything was cooked mild but was still flavorful, and it was the perfect heat level for what I can handle in my new reality of much more bland food than I used to eat. Our lunch group was three adults and a child, and all of our requests were followed to a \"t\". The prices were very reasonable, especially for the quality of the food. I left stuffed."}
{"text":"I think this is the best Thai in Madison. I love the pad thai with tofu and especially the pan fried chicken dumplings!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant of all time. The menu is huge and can be daunting but just go with an open mind and try new things. They blow all of the other Lao/Vietnamese places out of the water on quality and price. LS7 is my favorite."}
{"text":"Simply put, this place makes an excellent curry.  I mean, it was difficult to stop eating it, so be mindful with how much you order.  The atmosphere is okay, and if you go at a busy hour it can be really tight (with only two toilets, if that's a concern).  The service is unfrilled, and the beer selection is lacking, but make no mistake, you are going here for the curry!"}
{"text":"I solemnly swear that the food here is an extravagant trip of your tasting palette! I can't even begin describing the dishes and how delicious they are!

I am a crab rangoon lover since ever...and if I were to vote for the best crab rangoon the award would go to Ha Long Bay ! The curry puffs are also delicious!

The space is cute and the Asian servers are more polite than the American ones... not in the mood of being racist, its just a fact.

Is service slow? That depends on who is serving you but they got better with time for sure! Everybody is friendly and caring. Go there early! I will wait an hour to eat here any time

Extremely affordable and suits everyone! Try it for yourself!"}
{"text":"I don't know how I have lived in Madison this long and not visited this place!  This was the most amazing thai / vietnamese food I've had...period!  The spring rolls were so fresh and delicious, I'm still drooling!  My husband with with traditional chicken pad thai but it was the best we've ever had!  I had the Tom Kha Noodle Soup and it reminded me of Khao Soi but even better.  Way messy to eat but worth the splash.  We both ordered our heat at \"extra hot\" and it was perfect!  Already planning to take friends back!!!"}
{"text":"Best Thai in Madison. I love all the noodle dishes, especially the Pad See Eew. Lunch specials are an absolute steal under 8 bucks with an appetizer. Vegetarian dishes are great, I like the fried eggplant and the tofu is a good consistency. Unfortunately it can be a bit crowded and the service can slow down. However, if you like Thai food, this place is absolutely worth the wait."}
{"text":"I love their Tofu Pad Thai, especially when I add the chili paste."}
{"text":"I've eaten here once, due to a craving for yellow curry.  

The service was excellent, the decor was interesting, bright, cheery, the place was clean.  All good signs.

I  was hoping for more flavor, more spice in the curry, though.  I've had some excellent Thai in Milwaukee (specifically yellow curry, probably my favorite dish), but have yet to find anything comparable in Madison.  I ordered medium, which was extremely mild, and lacked any punch from any other spice, as well.

We will maybe give them another shot for pho or larb someday, but there are others higher on the list before Ha Long Bay, since I have my doubts it will live up to the reviews."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Thai food in Madison, but the wait for take out is crazy.  Many nights it's worth it, but you may wait an hour from ordering to pick up your dinner, and half that time will be waiting in the restaurant with 10 other people waiting for their take-out order, too.  Better to eat at the restaurant if you can get a table."}
{"text":"Okay you guys, if you haven't checked out Ha Long Bay yet, you are SERIOUSLY missing out. 

I love Thai food. This is probably the best Thai I have had in Madison. And it's not just Thai, either. As the name suggests, it's Vietnamese as well, and there is also a Laotian section offered too. 

Now, if you've ever driven by Ha Long Bay on a warm day at peak meal time, you have probably noticed a line out the door. It's common. Yesterday, on a brisk evening around 5:30pm, we were given a 40 minute wait time. This place is POPULAR. If you're not okay with waiting, I would suggest going at non-peak times, or ordering for pick up. I promise, though, the food is WORTH the wait. 

We started with AP10 - Gi Cun Ch Giò. They were spring rolls, with pork egg rolls inside. So yummy. The freshness of the spring roll paired perfectly with the crunch of the egg roll. 

We also ordered the AP4 - Crab Meat Wontons. Similar to Crab rangoon, but better! 

For my main, I went with the TN3 - Pad See Ew with chicken. I've had a lot of Pad See Ew in my day, and this was definitely toward the top of the list as far as taste and quality go. It was rich and flavorful, they didn't skimp on the egg (my favorite part) and the chicken was prepared really well. Since we started with appetizers, I got to take the majority of this dish home, so I get to make multiple meals of it. Yay! 

My friend who I was dining with went with one of the fried rice dishes. I can't recall what one it was, but it looked good! 

There were some folks sitting near us who had some curry that I was basically drooling over, it looked SO GOOD. I will be back soon to try that next. There are so many items on the menu I can't wait to try!"}
{"text":"Thinking about finding a new Madison Thai place. Ive been having to order 5 heat (hottest spice) the past three times I've been and it's still quite unspiced. 

I'm really not into SUPER heat. I buy hot salsa and Sriracha. Thats about it. So for me to want to pour hot sauce into your HOTTEST dish? Very disappointing. Also, unfortunately the other spices don't seem to be there either, not just the heat.

Im not sure. I keep wanted to love it as much as I used to but it's becoming more and more flavorle"}
{"text":"Oh my where do I start.. Love this place.. I really like the pan fried dumplings and their soup is delish.. The coconut curry with scallops is to die for.. Will be going their again to try more.. They have a huge menu .. Oh an btw they have the best ginger beer and FYI yes it has alcohol in it ,)"}
{"text":"We did a Friday lunch here and seating was immediate with some empty chairs too, which is a plus.  The menu is fabulous and there are pages of food to try at the degree of heat you want.  The spring rolls were a delight-fresh and crunchy,  and we both ended up choosing the yellow curry rice (T1) Ordering is easy if you are like me and aren't sure how to pronounce the meals-you order by letter/number combination next to your desired dish.

The food was great, I ordered mild and it had just enough heat to flavor it, but not make me chug water.  Service really wasn't good.  Our server was there barely just enough to give us a refill.  Another server who attended the table behind us left the serving tray holder up, so I had to maneuver myself around it to leave. 

The menu is huge and the restaurant has some fun character to it.  I'll be back to try more things."}
{"text":"Wish I could give 4.5 stars.  Best Thai in Madison.  Note that \"hot\" is midwestern hot,  also known as mild.  \"Very hot\" is \"hot\"

Parking is rough."}
{"text":"Again with the Tom Yum!  I know, I know, I keep getting the same thing every time, but when it's this damn good, how can I not??  I crave this stuff like crazy...."}
{"text":"Had lunch here and I have to say that the food is AMAZING!! Lunch specials are a great price! I had the Xao Thom Chicken which was FABULOUS!! This is a MUST try if you are in the area!!"}
{"text":"This place is great!!  The food is always excellent and staff is friendly!  I'm vegan and there are plenty of options and staff is knowledgable and helpful when it comes to vegan options!!  I could eat here everyday!!"}
{"text":"Spring roll with sauce is so nice. Tho noodle soup is great! The Vietnamese stir fry is good. Pad Thai is great! I went to Ha Long Bay 5 or 6 times. I was never disappointed."}
{"text":"Though the flavors were pretty good, everything we got was very oily and heavy. It was so overwhelming that we couldn't get through much of our food. Not sure if we'll go back. The atmosphere was fun on a Friday evening (~6?), but also VERY crowded. Sardine standing room only while waiting for a table. The people picking up their call-in orders knew what they were doing. Get takeout if you're wanting to try the food here."}
