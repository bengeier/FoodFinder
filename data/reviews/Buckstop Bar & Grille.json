{"text":"We live about 5 minutes from The Buck Stop.  We have lived there for 9 years and I believe this is the 4th restaurant in that building.  My wife and I call it the place where restaurants go to die.  Needless to say we didn't have high hopes for The Buck Stop.    Our first visit was the day that they opened.  Things were in a bit of a disarray and the food wasn't the greatest.  We waited quite a long time to go back and give it another try  and I am really glad that we did.    We originally went back because my wife wanted to try the Pho.  Since she was trying the Pho I decided to try the fried rice.  They were both amazing.  We have been back several times now and it is just as good every time.  We also really, really like their hot wings.    The theme of the bar and the food definitely don't go together.  I admit, I didn't really get the buckeye theme with Asian food, but I have to say that it all works together.  Mainly because the fried rice is so amazing.  It is clear that the owner takes pride in her food and makes the fried rice from scratch each time it is ordered.    So, if you don't mind a little rough around the edges, do yourself a favor and go here and get the best fried rice in town.  Maybe the best fried rice I have ever had."}
{"text":"I live in Chesterland.  When it became the Buck Stop I didn't give it a chance.  Heard from friends that don't even live close by about how nice of a place it is.  Went there and it was a great suprise.  I had the fried rice, egg role, and pot stickers...shared with a three other people.  The food was great, place was clean, staff was very nice.  I recommend this place completely!  I hope that they will keep up with what they are doing.  I feel  they did a poor job advertising the changes that the place needed."}
{"text":"Excellent authentic Pho, large portions. We loved the egg rolls. Very friendly staff as well."}
{"text":"Beautiful egg rolls and potstickers! Healthful Pho and fantastic fried rice. I haven't even gotten to the burgers and sweet potato fries, tho my husband reports the fish is delish! This place, tho not quite a looker, is Chesterland's best kept NOM NOM NOM secret. I'd like to think it would stay open so I can keep enjoying!"}
{"text":"Local sports bar with typical sports bar food options and some really good Vietnamese options: Really good homemade eggrolls, pho, fried rice and banh mi. Bartender is attentive, friendly and remembers everyone. Small but nice selection of draft beers. We love having this place near home."}
{"text":"Wonderful freshly prepared food.  Everything we ordered was wonderful with a twist that makes it unique.  My husband had the bang mi sandwich and I quote, \"I could eat that sandwich everyday.\"  The service was fabulous.  Our server Jeremy was helpful and personable.  This is one of my new favorite places."}
{"text":"Best egg roll I've ever had- trust me this place has it figured out- get an egg roll and bahn mi-"}
{"text":"Heard this American Tavern/ OSU Bar has good Asian food. Where else can you get American and Asian food in the same place? Stopped in Saturday evening with both Buckeyes and Indians games on. I ordered the PHO and my boyfriend the chicken fried rice, we each had egg rolls... everything was excellent! The bartender/ manager was so friendly and actually explained to us the correct way to eat the PHO and egg rolls, we found out later that she is actually the cook and prepares all the Asian food fresh each day ahead of the shift. She pays a lot of attention and knows her guests, she remembered a few ladies that came in and sat next to us, they said they  haven't been there in a few years, she remembered them, what they had to eat, drink and where they sat! We will return, great place!"}
{"text":"Really surprised to find Vietnamese food here, but it was really good.  Look forward to coming back"}
{"text":"Went on a Monday and Pho was not available.  Had 2nd choice, Banh Mi sanwich.  WOW!  One of the best Banh Mi sandwiches I have ever had.  Perfect in every way.  Ton of hot french fries to go with.   Came back Tuesday for the Pho and was pleasantly surprised by a huge bowl of Pho with plenty of bean sprouts, jalapeno slices, & cilantro to add to the soup.  Waddled away satisfied.   Bar needs help.  Asked for Wild Turkey American Honey, nope.  Tried for Jose Querva Gold and Amaretto de Sarona (4:1), no Amaretto de Sarona.  I didn't even try for Chambord.  I guess that you have to be a beer swiller to appreciate their selection...    Tuesday is $1 Egg Roll special.  You have to order at least 2, but you can't take any home with you,  that sucks."}
{"text":"I LOVE the food here! I have been here several times just for the egg rolls & chicken tenders. I have never had an egg roll so good. They are huge stuffed with ground pork & vegetables that melt in your mouth after biting into the crispy light spring roll wrapper....okay so maybe it's not really an egg roll per say but they are hand made. The chicken tenders are hand breaded & pounded thin. Very tender & good flavor. I am yet to try the pho that I have seen others order & looks delish & the bowl is full to the brim. Ohio State sports bar decor meets REAL fresh Vietnamese food done right. Keep up the good work Buckstop!"}
{"text":"Your average dive bar. But the food is very unique. The way they mix Vietnamese and American food is pretty cool."}
{"text":"Took the family here today and had a great surprise.  It is a Ohio state bar with some killer Vietnamese food.  I got egg rolls and pho and it was really great.   Waiter was on point and passionate about their food.   We will be back!!"}
{"text":"I got the mushroom Swiss burger. it was cocked to order and it was good. the fries are just regular fries. not bad, not great, just good regular fries. this is there soft opening. I will check out more items later. in any case Buck Stop will be my go to place when I want a burger and fries and im eating in Chesterland."}
{"text":"I ordered a well done cheddar bacon burger, when it was brought to me, I was impressed with the size, they are good sized burgers and I promise you will not leave hungry. It was cooked correctly and tasted very good, only thing was the cheese seemed a bit light, a bigger piece of cheese would make the burger perfect. The french fries were also pretty good. Sitting in the booths was a bit awkward as I almost felt like a child trying to reach, experience may vary, but I felt the table was too high up/seat was too low. I haven't had that problem at any other restaurants. Definitely try this place out soon!"}
{"text":"Go on tuesday all egg rolls 1 bu k and fried rice with chicken pork and shrimp are best i know of.nice friendly service and nice area."}
{"text":"Tonight we had a cheddar bacon burger and the Vietnamese Pho. Quite a find to have Vietnamese food in the outskirts of Cleveland. The spring rolls are fresh and amazing as in the Pho. I did have a French fry which I must say was yummy too. They only got 4 stars, however, because I used a ladies room before having dinner there were no paper products and that's just NOT cool."}
{"text":"I have one word: Pho. Wow. They say the best Pho in Cleveland is in some downtown restaurant... not for me. For me this here is the best Pho in town."}
{"text":"Outstanding food and probably one of the best long island iced teas anywhere. Had the egg rolls as a starter. So good we decided to stick with the Asian options and had the fried rice with shrimp, chicken,  and beef. Huge portion that was really fresh and tasty. My date had the perch and it was equally good. We sat at the bar and watched tons of takeout orders being prepared and picked up. No wonder the place was so busy. That's a great sign for a property that has seen its share of turnover. We will be back !"}
{"text":"Kind of a weird place actually. There is such a wide variety that you have to doubt it can do everything well. We had the egg rolls, and they were obviously home made and very good. We also ordered the pho, which was good, but not great. One thing that is consistent is that it is expensive and not very good value for money. Examples are: fried rice $12.99 , Pho $12.99. These are usually found in Asian restaurants for $8.99 or less, and usually better quality. One thing that really bothered me was a beer that I ordered listed at $5.75 (pretty pricey to start) was $6.75 on the bill. As said previously, OK but I won't be back"}
{"text":"This place is disgusting, I ordered a Pepsi at first and when it came out it tasted like bad well water mixed with sugar. Sent it back and got a water, still tasted like rust. For my meal I ordered a cheeseburger medium with american cheese. 35 minutes later it comes out and it's just the patty with a bun. No lettuce, tomatoes, or pickles like it said on the menu, had to ask for it seperatly. My cheeseburger was not good at all, tasted like a fish filet at McDonald's."}
{"text":"What a joke. We went for Happy Hour last week and ordered a couple of regular-sized Guinness's. When we got our check, we were shocked to see the price - $5.75 each - at the discounted, $1 off, happy hour price! That means that a regular-sized Guinness draft is normally $6.75. This place doesn't rate high enough to charge those premium prices. Dirty interior, lackluster service, so-so food. Uhmm, yeah, there's a whole bunch of better choices within a stone's throw, don't waste your money."}
{"text":"I've had some not so great food since my positive experience with the bahn mi sandwich. The fried rice is kind of bland and the batch I had was at least a day old - fried rice does not keep well even for a short time. The other bar food is so so. This place is a comfortable spot to watch a game, have a beer and some decent grub. But not much more than that."}
{"text":"We ordered the egg rolls as soon as we got in. They were fresh, hot and excellent. My husband ordered the hot wings & loved them. I ordered the chicken fried rice. It was hot, fresh & tasted great. We will definitely eat back. Reasonably priced also. Good value."}
{"text":"Driving by, this place looks like an unassuming roadside sports bar. Our first impression walking in was that it was just that...an unassuming sports bar that was extremely clean and well maintained, and that had Deschuttes Fresh Squeezed IPA on tap. But when the sweet owner served us, she recommended we try their Vietnamese food! We gave it a whirl and we're so glad... homemade from scratch, fresh and delicious. It's off the beaten path, but if you can get here you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Decent place for a quick dinner. Not much to do for kids, mostly good for adults. Their best thing are the homemade eggrolls. They have a few Asian items on the menu and I wasn't impressed with most but the eggrolls are very good!"}
{"text":"If you like good food and nice people, then look no further! The employees and the patrons are all super nice people. They have awesome Vietnamese food and Bells Two Hearted on tap! Swing by and check it out. Be sure to try an egg roll!"}
{"text":"I finally had a chance to try their Pho and it was great! Their egg rolls are pretty good too. I love that they are generous with the bean sprouts, so I didn't have to ask for extra. The noodles were very good, I must say much better then I expected at an American bar & grille, and the broth was tasty just the right amount of spice.  Although I know Pho isn't everyones cup of tea, I would strongly recommend trying it if you stop in to the Buckstop.   One additional note: their beer selection has gone down since their first days open. this is not a negative for many people, but it would be nice to see a few more options especially with all the great local breweries around Cleveland."}
