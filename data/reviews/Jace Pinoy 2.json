{"text":"This is my go to place for Filipino food. It's amazing!! The turon is the best!! Super crispy on the outside but super soft, sweet and delicious in the inside. It's the best. Their BBQ is also great!! And the chicken skin chicharon is so yummy. The Goto is a perfect blend of everything! The owner is so sweet, hospitable and friendly. Would definitely recommend this to all the Filipino food lovers!"}
{"text":"Restaurant is on the second floor of the oriental mall. Parking is free at this mall!

The food was delicious! I had the pansit, lugaw, peanuts and halo halo. 

Owner is super friendly and nice. Always giving away free samples. Today, she gave me a bowl of lugaw to taste, even though I ordered the pansit. I loved it so much i'll definitely order it next time.

I'm definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Almost instant food poisoning.  I had the beef with egg on garlic fried rice - can't remember actual dish name. Was not picture worthy or anything special, so never intended to write a review - however, the effects a couple hours later is what prompted this review. 

I suspect the mall just is not busy enough on weekdays so food sits out got longer, is older, and thus chances of getting sick are inevitably higher."}
{"text":"Well, now I'm sold. I'm a sucker for places where I get treated like family and get fed like family. I hate being called pet names by business people, but when the owner called me 'baby', I knew she wasn't just saying it. She meant it. And no, not 'baby' as in 'babe', but baby as in little one. 

The last time I came, my friends and I were offered samples of chicharon. This time, my mom and I were offered samples of pancit (stirfried vermicelli and veggies?), palabok (noodles with some kind of mild curry looking sauce with meat bits, hardboiled egg chunks, green onions, and chicharon bits), some kind of gingery chicken soup, some fried veggie and shrimp fritter, and chicharon. It was super generous of the owner, especially since all I had ordered up til then was a turon. We ended up buying lunch.

I was going to get a medium palabok ($5.99) and then get a bunch of small things on the side, but she said she could do a combo with palabok instead of rice, so we went with that. We ended up having laing (taro leaves stewed in coconut milk), more of that gingery chicken soup, and chorizo de cebu (round little sweet sausages). She insisted we have the gingery chicken soup with some rice, so she scooped us some rice on a banana leaf covered plate, and added some fried tofu and onions to the side. Then, she asked us if we wanted more rice than that. What hospitality! All the food was delicious, although the palabok and the laing...and chicharon...were my favorites among the savory things we had. The turon was delightful. It was incredibly crispy on the outside and the banana was nice and sweet without being too mushy. Although we couldn't finish our food and packed it to go, I still wanted the halo halo, so we got that. The ice in it was quite hard, and the owner saw me chipping away at it and felt bad, so she made me another cup of ice and drowned it in evaporated milk, then told me to take out the hard ice and replace it with the new cup. She had told me she would make me more ice and I had declined because I was stuffed, but she did it anyways. I'm now suffering from food coma, but not in a disgusting way. I'm just happy and sleepy. 

I can't wait to be back for more food."}
{"text":"Tried their turon .. mami's, two stalls over had more filling in their version .. was very disappointed .. I wouldn't go out of my for this place .. too bad I have had better elsewhere"}
{"text":"Have been here almost every weekend.  Their fried rinds (chicaron) keeps me coming back!  This place offers 3 different kinds - chicken skin, pork, and pork entrails. I'm not really a fan of entrails but deep fried with spicy vinegar, they are finger-licking great!!! These are not like the ones you buy from a package - these are fresh and taste SO much better!

For the adventurous newbie I would definitely recommend a combo of 2 of the following:
1) Laing - dried taro leaves with coconut milk (has a slight kick - nothing crazy spicy; just enough to make you want to keep eating). It has a little bit of pork thrown in for flavor - oh so yummy!
2) bicol express - pork stew with coconut milk - don't be turned off the color of the coconut milk - that's just the flavor and spices :) 
3) sisig - (I'm very picky about this dish but this place does it perfectly!) This one is made from a pig's head to make it flavorful and tender braised and fried for that nice texture seasoned with calamansi  (calamondin which is like a lime and a lemon's lovechild) and some chili flakes for flavor (not spicy)
4) pancit bihon - light noodles with veggies and chicken seasoned with calamansi 
5) sinigang - pork tamarind soup (sour and yummy)

End off the meal with a turon  (sweer plantain rolled inside a wonton wrapper and fried in caramelized sugar) and/or ginataan (sweet soup made of coconut milk with rice balls, sweet potato, tapioca, and jackfruit).  A definite must!!"}
{"text":"I like the lady at the counter. She was super nice and knows how to get customers. She offered my daughter and I some noodle and fried chicken skin to taste. It was good and we got some for take out."}
