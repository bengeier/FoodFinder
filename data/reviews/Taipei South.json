{"text":"Best Chinese bang for the buck in Charlotte area! Extremely attentive and quick service, sometimes overly so but you get used to it. Ginger chicken is the bomb and best hot sour soup I have had."}
{"text":"Just stopped in for my daughter's 15th birthday.  It is her birthday meal of choice year after year. Perhaps because she has been eating it since before she was born? 
Still consistently delicious, hot, fresh & fast.
Love any and all of their spiced brown sauces. The biggest problem can be which to choose.
We will definitely keep coming back!"}
{"text":"My wife and I have been going to this restaurant for over 7 years this is where we go when we want to go to Chinese. Standard menu not any specials but the food is good and plentiful. Excellent service by a smiling staff, full plate is approximately $10 per person I see no reason to go elsewhere. We recommend it."}
{"text":"Never again!  I have been ordering take-out and eating here for many years and it used to be ok for the price but the last 3 times we have eaten here it was absolutley horrible.  My husband and I and 2 children went inside to eat where they stuck us at a table in the back corner where the walls were greasy and filthy.  My husband would just assume not eating it and leaving but I am a little more forward and expect good food when I pay to go out so I went to the owner that usually stands in front of the restaurant and let her know very discretly and  nicely that all 4 of us were unhappy with the quality of food. She then told me that there is NO WAY that I could be unhappy because her food is the best and always fresh.  She very loudly walked to our table and stuck her hands in my sons chicken fried rice and ate it....agreed it was a little dry and would only give us our money back for the 2 cheapest meals although she could clearly see all 4 dishes were untouched.....UNACCEPTABLE and so so UNPROFESSIONAL!!!! Fried rice tasted like it had been sitting there for 10 days and you couldn't taste the difference in my husbands beef with garlic sauce and my hunan chicken.  The chicken wings use to be one of the highlights of going here. NOT ANYMORE.  I read today in south charlotte weekly that they recieved a grade of 90.  They also pulled out the booth right in front of us and were vaccuming as we were trying to taste our food.  VERY rude people and DISGUISTING food."}
{"text":"For \"cheap\" chinese this place is the best.  I will go out of my way to eat here.  The location is in a little strip mall but it is always packed.  A sign of a good restaurant.  I love how you pick a style then pick a meat.  Generally speaking, I never get chicken when doing cheap chinese because it is always strange mystery meat, but I love the beef.  I believe I get the beef with Garlic Sauce.  Oh yea... Real good.  Check them out.  You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Went there a couple of nights ago. This spring rolls came out too fast like one minute after we ordered them and they were cold. This is been our favorite Chinese restaurant for over 20 years. We used to have to wait at least 5 to 10 minutes for we could even touch the spring rolls they were so hot. Their fried rice was ho-hum flavorless. We did not recognize any of the staff. There may be a change of management or someone may be sick. Hopefully our next visit will be better."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places for take out. Their sweet and sour chicken is always delicious but know ahead of time it is not the usual dry deep fried nuggets. It is coated in their signature sauce that is the perfect balance of sweet and tangy. The portions are generous and the prices are great.
 The last time I was there I decided to eat there and that is the only reason why I would not give it 5 stars, the dining room could use a bit of an update, but as far as the food goes it is always spot on."}
{"text":"We just had some extremely flavorless Chinese food for dinner from here. It was fantastic the last time. Not sure why it was subpar tonight."}
{"text":"Simply put, This is the best Chinese-fare in the city.Served fast and hot by attentive Wait Staff."}
{"text":"Found this place one night and decided to try it... Wow what a great choice the food is great and the service is great as well. I will be ditching my go to takeout place and this is going to be my dine in and take out from now on. Don't be fooled by being in a shopping center at all...."}
{"text":"This is my go to Chinese place in Charlotte. The night I moved here I went with my parents, my mom is really picky about Chinese, and raved about it for a week after. I went again a few weeks later and ordered something different and again everything was amazing! Their hours are a little weird so make sure you look them up before heading over. My fav is the black pepper chicken. The chicken is perfectly cooked, seared not boiled like most Chinese and the veggies are perfectly tender with just the right amount if bite."}
{"text":"Taipei South was recommended to me from a friend. We usually dine at The Great Wall and I have to special order my Orange Peel Shrimp because it's not on the menu and sometimes they give me flack. I found my choice item on Taipei South's menu and boy was it cheaper! My meal was large in portion and even came with an egg roll. I must say I was well pleased with the taste of the food and I will be back!"}
{"text":"The food is very tasty and very reasonably priced. Unfortunately, the service has always been rude! I hate to say it, but for the entire experience there is one Chinese restaurant in particular in the area that blows this place out of the water!"}
{"text":"Reasonably priced Chinese food. Food tastes good, nothing special. They don't have a variety of sauces which probably helps to keep the prices lower than most places.
They also don't have a lunch special pricing like most Chinese places I've been to.
Dumplings are huge and tasty. 
Soups are great too but you get more in a to go order!
P.S...Don't ever get a mixed meat meal, I ordered scallops and chicken and ended up with TWO regular not jumbo scallops!!!...When I complained the lady told me it depends on the cook and size of the scallops?!!...don't do it!!...."}
{"text":"I 've been eating at Taipei South for 9 years, but hadn't been there in couple years.

Popped in for lunch this week and enjoyed a great lunch, at a good price.

Some people complain about being rushed by waitress bringing the bill while still eating. I actually prefer it, so that I don't have to wait and then ask for the bill. Perfect for lunch in the middle of the work day."}
{"text":"I've been a fan for over 20 years, though I've been recently tempted to find another go-to spot due to both the distance and inconsistency.  If you visit on the weekend, the quality is INCREDIBLY different than during the week.  The amount of oil, spices, meat/seafood added - ALL decrease on the weekend.  For two decades, I have sung their praises.  Until the issue of consistency has been addressed, I will not recommend them nor return."}
{"text":"Taipei is honestly the best Chinese food you can get in the ballantyne area. The seating is excellent, it has a much more traditional feel & the food never disappoints. Even a simple dish like sesame chicken tastes so much more flavorful than other take out places. Maybe I'm a little biased because I've been going here almost my whole life but I promise you will love it! Try the sesame chicken or kung pao tofu & you wont regret it, it is incredible."}
{"text":"Had lunch here today and had the best Orange Chicken I have ever had. It was crispy and perfectly seasoned! Orange chicken, rice and an egg roll was $6.95! I don't typically go here - it's a little out of my way but today reminded me to go back! Service was great!

Taipea South is located in the Food Lion strip shopping center behind Burger King and across the street from Lowes (Johnson Road near Highway 51)."}
{"text":"Great service, prices, and food. Ordered food for two on a Saturday and they didn't disappoint with the turnaround time and order accuracy. They were flooded with orders in the front which speaks volumes about the business. This will probably be my new Chinese takeout go to place!"}
{"text":"Very solid Chinese food.  Good quality ingredients.  Friendly staff. Ordered the food \"spicy\" but didn't have quite enough kick.  Still very good.  Will definitely return."}
{"text":"I was a loyal customer for many years, until one day the beef started to taste funny. Then I got food poisoning. Never Again."}
{"text":"I pick up food from here frequently. It is very good for the price point. I've had better chinese food but not for $6 a person. The egg drop soup is great!!"}
{"text":"I've been going here since my high school years, ten plus years, let's leave it at that. Quick, fresh, delish chinese that's so very affordable. You can get fried wings instead of egg rolls and the wings are so good! The severs works as a team, cups are never empty and food comes out hot."}
{"text":"I can't get excited enough to call it the best Chinese in Charlotte, but the food is consistently good.  The service is consistently above average.  The best thing I have noticed about this place is unlike many Chinese restaurants, they use the same menu for lunch and dinner.  I have never understood why I had to pay more for the same exact meal at 6:00pm in so many other Chinese places."}
{"text":"We ordered take away about 20 minutes before close on a Saturday night after choosing it on a whim. It's the favourite of a friend who is a long time resident of the area so we decided to give it a shot. 

The food was fantastic. Well and evenly spiced and quite a large portion for the price. The service was great as well. The man working the main counter was kind and pleasurable. Our food was ready by the time we returned from a quick walk down to the grocery store in the same shopping centre for dessert. Excellent!"}
{"text":"have loved all the House of Taipei's that have been in Charlotte since I moved here in '92. Food is always good, as far as some of the complaints about the service; c'mon this is a Chinese restaurant. Most of these folks speak no English or very little, and they are usually busy running around like mad so they don't stop by every 5 min's asking if everything is OK , which is fine by me, I don't come to a Chinese or ethnic restaurant for the banter w/the staff:)

Also one biggie for me; the prices have hardly changed in the last 5-6 years at the one I go to on park Rd. The New Tze chicken has been $5.95 as long as i can remember, a big plus since everywhere else you go prices have in a lot of cases almost doubled"}
{"text":"Best Chinese food I've had in nc since moving from NYC. I can at least eat it without saying omg I just wasted money"}
{"text":"Yummy and affordable Chinese food! I like to order takeout from TS because you are always full and happy with the food. You typically also can get the meal deal which includes egg roll with the entree. I like the steamed dumplings & cashew chicken.  Dining in is also fun if you are in the Park rd &51 area, good service!"}
{"text":"I haven't ate here - but wanted to ask a question. I popped in to check out the menu since I was really excited to find a restaurant with the word \"Taipei\" in the name. However, none of the dishes looked Taiwanese. The menu is typical Americanized Chinese food. Maybe there is a secret menu?

Can anyone who is familiar with Taiwanese food and not just standard Americanized Chinese food comment?

thanks!"}
{"text":"Their Sa Cha Chicken is excellent! The veggies and chicken always taste fresh. I go to several Chinese restaurants for take out and usually get the same thing. They are all good but I will say Taipei South wins for best flavored Sa Cha Chicken."}
{"text":"I have been looking forward to trying this place for quite some time now. My first visit was a bust because they were closed but this time was perfect....a rainy Saturday afternoon what could be better than Chinese food?!!?

I'm a little ashamed to say the reason I've been so anxious to try this place, it's for the chicken wings. Yep. I said chicken wings. They offer them as a side here!!!

 Say What!?!? 

The menu is simple, you chose a meat and then a sauce to accompany them. They have your pretty standard variety of meats: chicken, shrimp, beef, scallops, tofu etc. However, the selection of sauces is great. There are tons of options to tickle your tastebuds. 

I started with the vegetable soup. It was pretty standard. A really good broth and steamed crunchy veggies and tofu. The crackers that they served with the soup were very interesting. I'm used to the wonton strips; but these crackers were crispy  and blended well with the soup. 

For my meal I chose the Dual (two meats) with chicken and shrimp. I went with the steamed rice, chicken wings as my side (of course) and added an egg roll. I kept it simple and picked the spiced brown sauce with broccoli with a request to make it extra spicy. 

The food was out in no time. The brown sauce was really good, not as spicy as I hoped but still very tasty. The chicken and shrimp were plentiful. In every bite I had either a piece of chicken or shrimp and the broccoli was cooked perfectly. The egg roll was pretty standard, but still tasty. And those chicken wings that I had been waiting to try....were as great as I expected. Super crispy, cooked just the right way and they were actually seasoned really well. Totally worth the hype. 

Service was great and the prices were just right. I definitely recommend giving this place a try!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for some dinner and ordered the pork fried rice, four happiness and some dumplings. The dumplings are huge, and the flavor with the dipping sauce is good. The pork fried rice was ok, but was a little Blane. The entree was ok but not great. You get an egg roll with each item which is nice but they weren't very good. All in all the food is ok and if your in the area it's not bad for a quick bite."}
{"text":"I am a bit hesitant to give up my best kept secret of Taipei South. My husband and I visit pretty regularly for a fast, cheap, and delicious Chinese meal. This time I got the Wonton soup and he got beef and broccoli which comes with fried rice and an egg roll, which he shares with me :). There is plenty of food to share between 2 people. 

The service is spot on and very quick. I think after we ordered it probably came out in 5 minutes. After all was said and done, our check was less than $9, and we were both very satisfied."}
{"text":"1. $10 or less dinner prices
2. Garlic Beef with Eggplants
3. Chicken wings as a side item

..ENOUGH SAID!

This my go to place when I want good, cheap Chinese/Taiwanese food. I recommend getting anything with the garlic sauce. It's my favorite!"}
{"text":"We got food from there delivered and by far is the best value we've had since we moved to Charlotte. The portions are perfect for what you pay for. Recommend the new T chicken. Heck new T anything is probably good. We've had bad Chinese. This is solid"}
{"text":"Glad I discovered this place today. Came here for dinner. I would definitely recommend this place. Ordered a shrimp with Orange sauce it comes with a roll and rice. The portions are very generous for the price."}
{"text":"Best sweet and sour chicken I have ever had! I also enjoyed the crab rangoons. The service is fast and polite. Prices are great."}
{"text":"My go to chinese place!  Pork fried dumplings are amazing.  As is everything else I've tried.  Great food for a great price."}
{"text":"My friends and I were looking for a decent but relatively inexpensive Chinese restaurant and we found it in Taipei South.  We arrived around 730pm and while the place was bustling with patrons, we were promptly seated with no wait .  The service was extremely efficient, with appetizers and soups brought within a few minutes of ordering.  There was a bit of confusion when ordering some sweet and sour sauce and this took quite a while to figure out, but other than that the food was well worth the prices (ave of about 6 or 7 bucks per dinner!).  I'd definitely go back for some inexpensive, decent Chinese!"}
{"text":"I love this hidden gem and I go every time, I visit my friend in Charlotte. I go for lunch and it is amazing!I get the shrimp in garlic sauce extra spicy with no carrots add broccoli. I love it so much it is perfection.

I also love their hot and sour soup. My favorite part is the crispy noodles they have thicker noodles and they are very tasty in duck sauce."}
{"text":"A fellow passenger on us air recommended this restaruant, and after 2 visits,  its a good recommendation.  This is probably the best chinese food I have had in town, however I am only giving 3 stars because of the way they serve the food.

I think most people would experience chinese food as served family style.  In otherwords you may order a dish, but its pretty much a free for all when it gets to the table.  Thats how it works in my family anyway (disclaimer, I am not chinese)

If you haven't been here, its kind of hidden at the farthest north part of the parking lot."}
{"text":"The ladies are always nice and work together. The food is fast and delicious..... Inexpensive too! Potstickers are recommended."}
{"text":"The best American Chinese food in Charlotte! GIANT portions and delicious food all around!! Highly recommend!

Started with the chicken wings appetizer which were perfectly crunch and seasoned, and a bowl of egg drop wonton soup which was good. Had the seafood delight with an egg roll and it was so so good with large portions of shrimp and scallops. Definitely will be back!!"}
{"text":"This place has been here for years and it may be the best hidden gem in the city. Their garlic sauce is the best EVER, I get beef but I have tried chicken and I have  tried just vegetables and it's great everytime. You don't wait for anything unless it's packed lol. It's affordable and tastes great everytime. You have to come try and taste for yourself"}
{"text":"We eat here at least twice a week. You can't beat the low prices and good quality of food. I generally don't like Chinese....I prefer Thai but their food is so flavorful. I love the chicken with garlic sauce with chicken wings. I know it sounds crazy but the wings are good."}
{"text":"This place is a testament to the power of word-of-mouth. So much so that by writing this review I feel like just one more voice added to a cacophony of praise for this place. I've been familiar with Taipei South for about 8 years now and I've never once seen or heard any advertisement for the place anywhere. It's just not needed. Even with the terrible location the place thrives.

And for good reason. The food is always good and plentiful (best eggrolls in town). The service is always quick. The staff is back to fill your drink while it's still half full. And all this for the price of a fast food meal.

I left that part of town about 3 years ago but still go back probably once a month. I just haven't been able to find a Chinese restaurant in center city that lives up to it. They're all either not as good, more expensive or both. 

The only conceivable complaint I can see being made of this place is that the wait staff can be a bit terse and may make some feel rushed. I choose to interpret this as fast service as they do everything quickly but never make me feel pressed to leave if I linger in conversation after the bill has been paid. I think they just know that nearly all their customers are regulars and figure they know what they want almost as soon as they sit down."}
{"text":"Great lunch spot, food was excellent and the service was very great. Would highly recommend for a consistent great Chinese lunch!"}
{"text":"this is my favorite Chinese restaurant in charlotte, the food is delicious and comes to your table fresh and hot, amazing customer service and great prices"}
{"text":"I am a long time fan of this wildly popular south Charlotte Chinese restaurant that has occupied the same location for the past 20 or so years. It is known for its consistently good food, superb service and affordable prices. Anne, the manager, can be regularly seen walking for table to table, cheerfully checking on guests, most of whom are regulars.

Except for some minor price increases over the years, the simple menu has had few changes. All of the standard \"American\" Chinese fare is offered. Both lunch and dinner include your choice of steamed or fried rice AND egg roll, spring roll or chicken wing. Chicken wings are incommonly good and fried golden brown with the perfect crunch. Egg rolls and spring rolls are above average. The usual soups are tasty and, as of my last visit, run less than $2. Unfortunately, brown rice is not on the menu.

Portions are large for lunch or dinner with only a slight up-charge for dinner. The dining room is normally packed but don't let a wait scare you as they do a great job moving diners through. Dining room itself is attractive but showing its age somewhat. Sanitary rating is consistently in the low to mid-90s.

You can't go wrong here. At the risk of increasing my own waiting time, I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Really good fresh food. Will be the sole spot that I patron for Chinese & Taiwanese dishes. Thanx to my homie's recommendation.

My total for the 2 dishes I posted was $16.55 after taxes and honestly worth it. This was a 20 minute drive from my spot and one I am now inclined to make. Meat condition is huge for me and I had a really good experience. Highly favored and recommended!"}
{"text":"My favorite Chinese restaurant in Charlotte. We've been going here for over 10 years - the scallion chicken is my favorite. The food is always very good and very reasonably priced. I'm puzzled by others' comments on the service - We've always had good service."}
{"text":"This is definitely the best Chinese food in Charlotte and may be the best overall restaurant in town. Very inexpensive but quality Chinese food. I've had almost everything on the menu and loved it all. Your food will be out in 3 minutes and you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Tucked away in the strip mall is this gem. I Have tried many things on the menu & it's always fantastic. Try the Sa Cha Beef! Very affordable. Dinners are about 7-8$."}
{"text":"First of all, This review is only base on lunch time because I've never been there at dinner, HOWEVER this place been open for a LOOOOONG time as far as chinese restaurant goes in that area, this place is PACKED for lunch almost ALL the time in the weekdays but the service is incredibly fast and the food comes out quick too so the wait is usually minimal or none at all.  their lunch special is only around $6-$7 so very reasonable and its always delicious i've been there for probably over 30 times for lunch and i've never had a dish i dont like,  their meat, their sauces is very flavorful! if ur in the area and have a thing for some good ole chinese food for lunch, give this place a shot! u wont be disapointed!"}
{"text":"Our go-to Chinese food spot! The people are so nice and the food is always fresh, fast and delicious:) Also, super affordable prices make it a weekly stop for us!"}
{"text":"Best Chinese food in Charlotte!! Fast, cheap, delicious. Been eating here for decades :)"}
{"text":"My #1 go to spot for take-out and most of the time the dinning room is full too. I know why!! Do yourself a favor if you live in the area & support this place.. it was actually recommended to me by a local chef"}
{"text":"Delicious food. Reasonably priced. The ladies at the front desk are always so nice. Just wished they delivered for when we are feeling lazy. This is our new favorite Chinese spot for sure."}
{"text":"We've tried other Chinese restaurants in the area and none come close to the quality and value at Taipei South.  The food is good, great portions too.  The service is just excellent as well.  We were there this past weekend and we were amazed how fast we got our food when they packed.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"This place is great! Their food is delicious and very fresh! The take-out process was simple and quick too! The lady working the front desk was very nice. I am soo glad I found this place!"}
{"text":"In search of some fast grub, the fam and I stopped at Taipei South for some good ole' fashioned Chinese. Needless to say, this snobby Big Apple foodie wasn't keen about trying Chinese in Charlotte but I was overruled. Ok not overruled, just figured I'd save my bullets for another battle.

We get inside and the ambiance is simple--nice, clean and more spacious than I thought from the outside looking in. Waitresses--and a kind man who may be the owner--all greeted us and we were sat quickly. 

We hadn't even sat down when the lady asked us if we wanted drinks. Seriously. That kinda put me off but that turned out to be the only blip in what was a surprisingly good night. Food came out super fast which was also disturbing to me but it was actually good I thought to myself as I took my first few bites. Really good as I helped myself to a second plate.

20m later all 6 plates of food we were sharing family style had been devoured. Authentic Chinese? No, more like the American kind and although I'm more fond of the former, this one really hit the spot. Cheers."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a cheap chinese food fix for lunch, this place should do the trick. The menu is fairly simple, you pick a protein, sauce and a side (wings or egg roll). The food comes out quickly and again, it's a cheap fix so don't expect anything mind blowing but you will get a quick, cheap and solid meal."}
{"text":"Great Americanized Chinese food - quick and cheap...  Probably not as good as Great Wall south, BUT substantially cheaper, egg roll (or chicken wings substitution) is included.  AND fried rice is an included choice lunch or dinner!

For an order of wings I would still go to Great Wall, but as I said for speed and price you can't beat this place."}
{"text":"My favorite Chinese restaurant EVER!  I discovered this gem over 15 years ago and have been going here ever since.  Fast service and amazing food.  Everything is served nice and hot.  I've never had a bad meal here.  My favorite thing to get is the egg drop soup and the chicken and broccoli and garlic sauce extra spicy. You can get your entree and a drink for about ten dollars a person.  Each entree comes with either white or fried rice and your choice of an egg roll, spring roll, or chicken wings. I've been here with friends and family over the years and everyone is a returning customer. The only reason I don't give it five stars is because it's nothing fancy on the inside and the staff isn't very friendly.  It's always crowded but they get you in and out the door in a hurry.  It's worth a trip for the amazing food."}
{"text":"So far my favorite Chinese restaurant since moving to Charlotte. The staff is SUPER FRIENDLY and great every time I visit. I usually just get take out but I'm sure it would be the same dining in.  I go with the sesame chicken, rice, and spring roll. The chicken is always cooked well and no super over cooked like a lot of Chinese restaurants offer. It's always been clean and inviting, and the location is easy to find. Prices are great for the quality that you get!"}
{"text":"Food: So completely, totally meh. Pre-cooked meats, steamed vegetable, and poured over the top sauces.  Meh.

Decor: Moderatly interesting Asian art with a few too many happy Buddhas.

Service: Confused but trying to be helpful."}
{"text":"We haven't yet eaten in but have been getting takeout from Taipei South for a long time now.  As you'd expect from a takeout place, they have good portion sizes and is consistently pretty decent, though can be too oily at times.  The staff at the register are friendly.  Be careful the food goes straight from the wok to the styrofoam and sometimes melts through.   
This is our go to place for relatively cheap dinner after work."}
{"text":"Really solid Chinese food for a reasonable price. We have ordered takeout from here twice (on the recommendation of friends) and both times the food has been well done and FAST. We would definitely recommended trying Taipei South.

Ps - I substituted the chicken wings (2) for the egg roll and they were crispy and tasty (though slightly under seasoned). Nothing a pinch of salt can't fix."}
{"text":"This place Rocks! I order take-out from here once every month and they never fail me. The food is fresh, hot and tasty and the price is Great.  I always get either 4 happiness or the orange chicken, either one I am never disappointed."}
{"text":"Really cheap for the dining experience. Very good though, great portion sizes. Quick service!"}
{"text":"Best Chinese food in Charlotte, hands down! They always have fresh and delicious meals and the flavors surpass any Chinese restaurant in the area. We have to drive about 20 mins to get here, and pass a dozen other places but we will make the trip every time. Service is excellent for pick up or dine-in. Chicken and broccoli is my favorite, and my husband always gets the sesame chicken. Definitely deserves more than 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Best Chinese take out in Charlotte! Also,  the people who run this place are wonderful. Always pleasant and prompted."}
{"text":"This is a little restaurant at the end of a shopping center that sits down in a hole off Johnston Road... but you do need to locate it and go inside - the food is super tasty and the service is crazy fast.  It's a perfect lunch spot; get in, order, eat, get out and back to work on time!  They have a wide variety, delicious soups with the fried crunchies, and their eggrolls have shrimp in them - not the usual minuscule pork pieces that most of these little places use.  Yep - a hidden gem for sure!"}
{"text":"Taipei South does American Chinese food right. The food comes out hot, plentiful and tasty. I usually get it to go and the food is ready when I get there. My go to order is sweet and sour chicken with fried rice and egg rolls and it's usually $8 for a pile of food. The service is good and the dining area is clean. Their sweet tea is very good. If you're looking for good, fast American Chinese food in South Charlotte, then Taipei South is a good, fast and reasonably priced choice."}
{"text":"Neighbor told us about this place and we decided to go. Food was delicious and there are a lot of options for things to order. I was actually surprised about the prices of the food. We were there for dinner but I thought they might of given us the lunch menu by mistake. Prices are really good and you get a lot of food. Also ordered togo one time and it was packed nicely and it was also delicious! Wonton soup was good. Chicken wings were nice and crispy. Lomein noodles surprisingly comes with a side of rice lol which was a nice bonus. Eggrolls are good too!!"}
{"text":"If you are into American Chinese food, then Taipei South is probably the best place in Charlotte for that. Not only are you guaranteed to enjoy your food, you are guaranteed to be satisfied / hardly able to finish it all! Why, you ask? WELL:

1) All dinner combos come with a hearty entree, a big mound of rice, and a side item.
2) The combos cost anywhere from $7-10 bucks: affordable!
3) Customizable entrees: choose the sauce and the veggies!

I personally went with a spicy black bean sauce, and elected chinese eggplant as my vegetable of choice, served alongside the trio of beef, pork, and shrimp. It was delicious and I will definitely come back and try out different combinations!"}
{"text":"Easily my favorite Chinese place in all of Charlotte. 

The food here is amazing, and perfectly priced so you always feel like you are getting your money's worth and then some. Have been coming for years and it's always consistently delicious as well. Whether it's take out or dine in makes no difference on the taste or the portion size which I've seen vary greatly at other establishments. I will always recommend Taipai South to anyone and everyone. 

The only downside, and this is MINOR, is that the dine in service could use some work. They are always extremely friendly but there is an overall sense of being rushed through your meal and to pay your check and leave which is the only, and again a VERY MINOR, complaint I have to offer."}
{"text":"One of the best chinese I've ever had!! Always quick and delivered hot. I don't live in Charlotte anymore, but will always make a stop by Taipei when I am in town. This is a must visit."}
{"text":"Not authentic Chinese by any means, but definitely a great place for a decent, inexpensive meal. The huge, satisfying portions will run about $7-10 and they come with white or fried rice & a veggie roll, egg roll, or chicken wings! I have tried quite a few things over the years from veggie lo mein, steamed vegetables, and veggies & tofu in garlic sauce, but my favorite will always be the sesame tofu. There aren't any vegetables in it, but I add some for $1 extra. I also tried the steamed vegetable dumplings once. They were pretty good, & HUGE, but a weird seafoam green color, which was kind of off-putting. On my last visit, I tried the general tofu but it wasn't spicy at all so I just ate the dried chili peppers that were in the sauce. Some things seem like a good idea at the time but eventually you will find out it was actually a pretty shitty idea..

BF's go-to order is the general scallops with white rice & chicken wings. Both of our meals run about $20 including the tip which is a STEAL. For some reason, we usually end up here on Sundays and this place is packed! The ladies who work here are very sweet, but because it's so busy, they may be a little short with you, which I don't really mind, I'm not here to make friends. Service is quick & our drinks are constantly being refilled. 

If you like modestly priced, dinosaur-sized portions of non-crappy Americanized Chinese food, this is the place to be!"}
{"text":"Very good Chinese food!  At one time or another, I've probably tried everything on the menu.  My favorite is their Sesame Chicken that comes with fried rice and an egg roll for $7.50.  

This is a Family friendly environment and not anything fancy.  Meal prices run from $6-8.50ish. Food comes out hot, just like you order it and good size portions.  

A downfall to this restaurant is that the wait staff is on a mission to get your drink and food order in as soon as possible and very much in a hurry to rush you out of the door as soon as your food arrives at your table! 9 out of 10 times, I call ahead and I order my food to go.  I feel it's the best way to go - my order is usually ready in 10-15 minutes, even when they are busy!  Never had an issue there. 

If you're craving Chinese food, give 'em a try!"}
{"text":"Favorite quick Chinese spot. They give a good amount of food for a cheap price. All plates come with a spring roll, egg roll, or chicken wings.  Everything is fresh, cooked to order and fast. In and out in a half hour easy, even when they are packed. Crispy scallion chicken, honey chicken, garlic chicken, hunan shrimp, all are fantastic.  The house made duck sauce is a nice addition to all."}
{"text":"Great chicken wings! They are fried twice so super crispy. The fried rice was also very flavorful. Each meal comes with fried rice and an egg roll. It was so much food! The egg rolls were not that great. Definitely will be back for the wings."}
{"text":"Great Chinese food. Always go in for lunch. Fast, fresh and delicious. Plenty of seating and the tables turn fast. Inexpensive as well."}
{"text":"Food is delicious and served in large portions. Great value for the price. Convenient for both take out and eat in. 

Remember that they are closed from 3-5 between lunch and dinner. Went yesterday after work and there was a line at the door before 5."}
{"text":"Alright, I've got the same hangup most others have about this place. The food isn't bad, it's GOOD. They give you a lot for a good price. Don't expect genuine Chinese food, this is American Chinese food -- just like most Chinese restaurants in this country. 

Now here's the hangup I have with Taipei South. Customer service is lacking. The ladies that work the front aren't mean people at all, so let me make that point. But it's always a mixed bag. Sometimes orders are quickly placed, drinks always topped off, and food comes out quickly. But other times it can be the opposite. I'll use my last visit as an example:

The waitresses said little to nothing (which is the usual case). They did bring out a little jar of Dr Pepper so I could refill my cup faster, but the waitress at one point came by and took the jar and used it to refill another customers drink who didn't even know I had been using that jar... Then she put it back on my table. It was also past peak lunch hour (1:45 and 1/3 full) yet I waited 12 minutes by the time I got my check to when I got the receipt.

Really this place just needs to be more hospitable. It would go a LOOONG way. Maybe they're content with where they're at? I'm sure they do fine since they serve good food. But it's no secret friendly and unforgettable service creates a memorable experience for the customer, something that causes them to always come back. I would love Taipei South to figure this out."}
{"text":"The food and prices are decent but the service could use some work. I felt like this one waitress was very rude. Also, I ordered take out recently, picked it up myself, and payed with a credit card. I found out a couple of days later that they took it upon themselves to add gratuity. It was kind of shady business practice so I won't go back."}
{"text":"Consistently excellent food and fast efficient service.  Drinks are never empty and it literally takes at most 8 minutes for your food to come after ordering.  The place is always packed but they are so efficient you never have to wait long to sit."}
{"text":"Pretty disappointed. I was excited to try this place out for a late dinner, after reading all the previous reviews; just wanted to go and place a to-go order. Arrived at 9:35pm, and they told us the kitchen was closed. Most restaurants have to serve until their closing time (which was 10pm). Maybe it's just Chinese places that stop serving? I'm not sure. But I'm not used to walking into a place BEFORE they close and being sent away. They lost my business for good. I know I should have called beforehand. I normally wouldn't go to a restaurant that close to closing time, but when I do, they at least take my money!"}
{"text":"Exceptional customer service.  I've only had take out, but the order is always accurate, hot and ready quickly. The serving sizes are generous and the food is delicious."}
{"text":"Decent food.. there was too much sauce, but the vegetables were fresh.  The tofu was interesting- crisply, fried on the outside and soft on the inside.  Items are priced nicely, the food was ready when I got there and the staff was really nice.  I ordered take-out and paid for it, but ended up eating it there.. which they were cool with.  I would definitely go again for eat-in and/or take-out."}
{"text":"If you're looking for cheap, fast, Americanized, greasy Chinese food, then this is the best spot in the city. It's exactly what you'd expect, but has also improved on the inside since renovating within the last two years. The tofu is pretty good and filling and is best when ordered \"extra crispy\" since it's doused in sweet sauce on most dishes. 

I do mean all of that in the most complimentary way. Just know what to expect and you will like it!"}
{"text":"The best hole I. The wall Chinese place I've ever had. Great to. Pick up and take home. They are super fast getting your food together and my order is always right!"}
{"text":"After hearing great things about Taipei South, I was so excited to be in the area recently.
If you've seen my other Asian/Chinese reviews, I base places a lot on the Wonton Soup...so, with that said I of course had to start with Soup.
The broth was great, served with two very large wontons and scallions. Very good. And, I love they serve their soup with crispy chips...

As for my entree I unfortunately cannot remember the name of the dish, but it was Shrimp, Chicken, Pork and Beef with Mixed Vegetables in a brown sauce. Huge portions and the dish was great, the veggies were all cooked to perfection and the meats were all great. The meal comes with a Spring Roll or Egg Roll and my waitress recommended the Spring Roll, perfect choice.

Overall, Taipei is a great spot when your craving Chinese with great service and prices!"}
{"text":"The best Chinese I've had in Queen City! It's slightly hidden and is a gem find. Docked a staff because you cannot get any lo mien as a side-- they make you purchase it as an entree AND they have the same prices for lunch and dinner."}
{"text":"Good food for that price. Pepper chicken is amazing. Staff is mean but taste is good. Price is perfect"}
{"text":"This place is a good value for the amount of food you get. I love their hot and sour soup. I highly recommend it as a lunch spot but it wouldn't be the first on my list for dinner."}
