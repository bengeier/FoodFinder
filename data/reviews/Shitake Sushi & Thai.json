{"text":"I was very disappointed about practically everything. When it comes to going out for dinner, of course it is important to be patient when busy and waiting for food, but considering we were the ONLY people in the restaurant, it took 25 minutes to recieve THREE sushi rolls, where one was made completely wrong. Shortly after us came another couple whose food was coming to them in the blink of an eye, while we were sitting 25 minutes with zilch. One of the items we received sat on the counter for almost ten minutes and I was ready to go get it myself to bring to our table. This is where I slowly started losing my patience. The food was nothing great , their yummy tuna roll was phenomenal and the only good thing to come out of this experience.  I would understand if it was busy and the chefs were busy making all these different meals and the servers were running table to table, but there were a total of four people in the entire restaurant. The service was terrible and it truly turned me off from all you can eat sushi. First and definitely last."}
{"text":"Shitake is the shit but needs to make major changes if they ever want to stand out from all the other ace sushi places. There is a serious lack of variety on fish but what they do have is very good. For eating there on opening day and not having ingredients on your menu is pretty amateur. No sea-bass and they mixed up 2 orders, and if you don't have something let the customer know. They refill your drinks when they are at 75%, like if I want another drink I'll ask and they keep asking for your menu.  Staff is great and quick but could frequent the tables less and have better interaction with customers, recommend things, or even tell you what food they are bringing you. Food comes quick and the special/chef rolls are something else to be tried. Tip: send your menu in 1 page at a time as you can tear it apart. This saves paper and let's you order more in a timely manner as when I ordered desert with other things, the desert came first."}
{"text":"Food was very good, lots of options.  We found our food took awhile to come out once we confirmed our order.  Overall a good experience, we will be back"}
{"text":"Went for supper and the meal was OK. Seaweed salad and pepper steak sashimi were delicious, however the Pad Thai tasted like it was pre-packaged. The Tom Yum soup was good but all broth. The beef satay was not good at all. I wouldn't suggest it to a friend or go back."}
{"text":"This sushi place is decorated really nicely inside. Everytime we come we order the AYCE and I'm always satisfied. I love that they have kalbi (Korean short ribs) available during lunch hours as well as dinner. Sushi is always fresh and hot wuk items are usually tasty. 

Only downside as with most AYCE sushi places is the servers can sometimes be MIA when needing a drink refill. 

Overall a good sushi joint that I will be returning to."}
{"text":"Food was good. Service sucked. Waiter told us it was lunch menu still we ordered and when we got the bill they charged dinner price. When we told them about it they basically tried to tell us we miss understood and their waiter was sleeping they didn't want to wake him up to clarify. After 30 min of arguing we paid lunch price but extra for 3 items that was a dinner item. They woke up the waiter and of course he says he never told us it was lunch still. They are scam artists. Never going back there again service is pathetic."}
{"text":"This is a very roomy ayce mix asian food restaurant.  We went on a Sunday night and it was not too busy.  Ordering food is nice and quick with their ipad menu and all of our orders came out; some ayce places tends to leave your half your orders.  The restaurant is clean and the services was on par.  I like that this restaurant have a good mix of sushi, chinese, and thai food so it caters to everyone.  A tad bit pricier but imo well worth it."}
{"text":"This place has stepped up their game. My first visit left me unsure if I would ever return, due mostly to the service. My boyfriend convinced me to go back, and sure enough, both service and presentation improved. Their menu is nifty because all items are displayed on  ipads, so it's helpful to see things you want to try."}
{"text":"Love this place.  The food comes out crazy fast so if you want to enjoy as them to bring it out slowly.  Service is very good and it is all you can eat with a huge variety and you get to order off from tablets.  Definitely a go to."}
{"text":"My family and I have come here on multiple occasions from family day to birthdays to regular dinners out. This place has never disappointed us for AYCE sushi. The owner is very friendly as are the servers. The place looks very modern and the dark decor gives it a club/lounge vibe. They have an iPad ordering system and the food comes literally instantaneously - you have been warned! 

The sashimi are cut to a nice thickness and are not room temperature or warm but refreshingly cold, just the way I like it! The baked mussels and green salad are so addicting and always my favourite because of the concentrated carrot dressing as well as the creamy sauce they bake the mussels with. All the fried items are never too greasy and are very crispy. The specialty rolls section also have some interesting and creative rolls as well as a wide selection of stir fried rice and noodle dishes. They also feature one free lamb chop on Fri-Sun for each adult AYCE dinner diner but you need to ask your server for it. At the end of your meal, their desserts menu contains the typical green tea, red bean and mango ice creams as well as fried bananas, mango pudding, green tea jelly and my favourite, creme brulee! 

Overall, great for groups because of the spacious interior, fast service and great food! We usually come here on weekends and never have we had a bad experience with the food or management. 

PS- I'd recommend ordering in increments because the food you send in when confirming your order come out quicker than you can eat; the staff don't really take note of table size or help you space out the timing of when food should come but it's great if you're starving though.. which is often when going for a buffet!"}
{"text":"Horrible sushi and food!! Worst ayce sushi buffet in vaughan.  Don't waste your time here."}
{"text":"FOOD POISONING!!!! This was the worst place I have ever eaten. Everything was horrible! I called them to tell them that, I was really sick and they said it must've been something else I ate. I only wanted to let them know so that no one else would get sick. but the manager did not care. Beware of this place!"}
{"text":"This place is not terrible. God value for ok food. Second time here and went with sushi lunch special, not ayce. sushi isn't rolled tightly so it falls apart. Ridiculously small salad portions (they're just head lettuce leafs, owners could spare a bigger portion without cutting into the profit margins). Bit stingy on the ginger too, had to ask for more. Service isn't the quickest. Having said that, $10 for 24 rolls made of fresh ingredients along with soup and salad is a pretty good bang for the buck
*50% off on ur bday*"}
{"text":"Dont waste your time eating here its not good quality food and the waiter that served us was not friendly. She was very impatient and had no respect for me and my party."}
{"text":"In the land of Vaughan where Italian food rules supreme, a decent AYCE sushi joint is hard to come by. And a futuristic one is even harder to come by! 

I had seen Shiitake Sushi open its doors in vaughan near Pine Valley Drive and Hwy 7, several months ago while pulling into the same plaza to enjoy a calorie infused burger at Holy Chuck. It's been on my list since then and only recent did I remember to stop in.  

To begin the devote here is amazing. Very modern, almost club/lounge like. Fits within the Woodbridge culture perfectly. We were seated quickly for lunch. 

The innovation of having the iPad for ordering at every table makes for the lunch experience to be even quicker. No more waiting for your server to fly by and pick up your scrap of paper. 

The food was on par with most AYCE lunch offerings. But the selection went far beyond just rolls, maki and hot options. I gorged myself on massive Korean short ribs. Like massive. Had noodle dishes, a miso soup as well as the regular tempura, sushi, rolls, make etc offerings. 

Price for lunch was great $38 for two, tax and tip included. 

Id be back again to try dinner to rate them on their sashimi offerings. 

Eatcrest out"}
{"text":"As all the ayce the food here is alright,above average.But the service and the little detail they put on garnish really moved me.And the coffee jelly is just something I been looking for the whole time."}
{"text":"Garbage, complete utter garbage. Waited exactly 24 minutes for the 1st plate of sushi which eventually came and was only 2 rolls of green dragon. The second tray eventually came and it was completly wrong. After i told the server she was arguing with me saying this is what i ordered... since when is mango and salmon the same thing? You are a complete idiot. Will never return.... oh by the way, there was a total of 4 people in the entire resturaunt. 

Thanks!"}
{"text":"Big open place, nice clean decor, fast polite service. No complaints there. To start, the sushi rolls were really fresh and delicious for an ayce restaurant. The salmon and tuna weren't chopped, which I always hate. The butterfish was soft and delicious, the eel was nicely flavoured. Their salmon and eel sushi pizzas were also really good in comparison to most ayce pizzas I've had. Their Thai items, though, were less amazing. They were good in the traditional sense, but maybe just not standout good. But the fact that it was ayce sushi + Thai is something I'd never had before and something I absolutely cannot complain about, two of my favourite cuisines combined into one amazing ayce!"}
{"text":"This place was definitely not what I expected. After reading several reviews, I walked in thinking the food would be worth the money. However, the food wasn't as great as I thought it be. The maki rolls were pretty good and came in small portions which was nice for those who get full easily. Their non sushi items weren't too great though. Their mango chicken was very chewy and had an odd taste. Their general Tao chicken had lots of fatty pieces and was covered in too much cornstarch. One thing I did love though was the shrimp tempura. It was so crisp and tasted great. Food again wasn't as great as I thought it would be.
The service on the other hand was not that bad. I agree with other reviews that the servers usually come by far and put the plates on the table and run off without even talking to you. They were nice though and I personally didn't have a problem with them. Overall I don't think I'll be back here."}
{"text":"One of the better all you can eat sushi restaurants in a while. The sushi pizza is delicious and the food is brought out pretty fart. Very cool place as well with modern decorations and good music."}
{"text":"Location: 4401 Highway 7 W Vaughan, ON L4L
Price: $$$
Service: BOO (thumbs sideways)

I visited a couple of time and I'm not impressed. I am all about the costumer service and the visit today was disappointing. We were seated and there was a big sticky stain on the table, so I told the server and he  stated in a crude tone that it was just water and I should just wipe it off. However, it was actually dirty and I once again told him that, and he rudely said to me \"this is the only table we have...\" Honestly, I was not being a difficult customer, I only inform him so he can send a wet towel my way to clean it up. SOOOO ain't nobody want your rude attitude SIR! 

ANYWAYS on to the food. 
I feel like Shitake is a very generic AYCES place. Their sushi is decent, and they have a relatively large selection of other items (from dimsum to soups to crispy deep fried foods). They're sashimi selection was small, they had the typical sashimi like salmon, tuna, surf clam (to name a few). Overall, there are better place for AYCES around Vaughan. The one thing that makes this place very intriguing is the special during dinner, they offer lamb chops per person. If you like lamb chop, you will be pleasantly surprised. They also offer bubble tea as well, which I had and it's okay.

The atmosphere of the restaurant is very modern and lounge like. It is also innovate, since customers are able to oder the food items on an iPad. The orders came out very fast as well.

Verdict: lost a star for the rude service. BYE"}
{"text":"Decor is quite nice but my experience was just ok. 

The waiter who seemed to be the manager was very friendly and talkative to us when he took our drink orders. However, after that he was no where to be found. We didn't get refills on our pop and teas until close to finishing our desserts. We tried to ask the other wait staff for refills on our drinks but they said we have to ask our waiter...

Sashimi was presented nicely and tasted good. However, the fish in the rolls and sushi were all quite tasteless. The cooked foods were decent, but nothing to rave about. The mango pudding was quite tasteless. The waiters seem to be very hard working getting all the food orders out.

Not a bad place but wouldn't be interested in eating there again."}
{"text":"This place was beautiful! The decor was chic and food was also delicious. I came here on a Sunday afternoon and it was not busy at all."}
{"text":"Given the area, this is one of the better AYCE sushi/Asian restaurants.  It's clean, spacious, and has a nice decor and atmosphere, including more comfortable bench and booth seating options.  It also has a modernized iPad ordering system to replace those old pencil and paper slips that you had to wait to have picked up by a server before getting processed, so the wait times are better.  It also allows you to keep tabs on what you've ordered and what is yet to arrive, although, I have been shortchanged several times on certain items and end up having to keep upping with another order to get what I asked for the first time for sashimi and certain beef- or bacon- based appetizer items.

The food itself, well, it's Canadianized Asian food, and the quality of the ingredients is pretty good.  I find it awesome to be able to order creamy coconut milk based Thai curries along with the usual sushi suspects. You can also order bamboo-steamed dim sum items, although the selection of those is quite small.

The dessert menu has a number of items that are only available on the weekend to go along with the increased weekend pricing, and most of them come in tacky little plastic and paper cups so that your table looks like a dentist's supply sales convention.  A lot of these are the restaurant's attempts to approximate typical Canadian dessert favourites like cheesecake, so they're nothing worth going here for specifically, but I have to say that the chocolate ice cream here is a lot richer and better than a lot of western style restaurants!

In all honesty I'd have preferred to give a 3.5 but, again, given other factors (the other options in the area, the really nice atmosphere, decent service, nice quality of sashimi) I'll go with 4.  There's only one other restaurant in the area I bother with so this one ends up being a go-to place for us."}
{"text":"It was their grand opening weekend last week, so we went on Saturday night. The decor is impressive, very modern and upscale.  The servers were very good, very attentive. It was quite busy.  There is an all-you-can eat option which was $25 per person or you can order from an a la carte menu.  We did the all you can eat option.  We have been to many Japanese restaurants. The tempura was pretty much the same as every other place. The rolls were ok, not the best we've ever had but not the worst.  Some were a bit too dry. There are a lot of options on the menu.  We loved the cheese wontons, the beef terriyaki and the bacon and asparagus wraps.  We weren't fussy on the chicken fried rice.  Everything was pretty great until we ordered the chicken teppanyaki.  I took one bite and spit it out, which is something I would normally never do.  I wasn't sure, but it tasted \"off\", like the chicken was rancid.  After that I didn't enjoy much, it just turned me off. I had vanilla ice cream, which was safe, my husband had the creme brulee which was a joke.. a watery custard with sugar on top..like grains of sugar that hadn't been properly melted.  Overall it was ok, but if we are craving Japanese, we will go to one of our other favorite places instead."}
{"text":"Sushi -      3.5/5
Appetizers  4/5
Other food (fried rice, padthai, chicken, beef etc)  2/5
Service - 3/5   ( Depends who you get. The older guy is not that great.)
Atmosphere 5/5

Another Chinese owned AYCE sushi place. Price seems a little higher than other places $21.99 for dinner without drinks and the food doesn't really reflect to it. Sushi itself is decent but other dishes have the distinctive Taiwanese or Chinese herb taste to them.  Appetizers are pretty good though and I like the Ipad menu. 
But spend $4-5 more and choose Spoon and Forks if you like to have good AYCE Japanese/ Thai."}
{"text":"I'm not one to complain about service, but feel I must here.  This iPad menu gimmick seems cool but makes it so impersonal that the staff just simply ignore you.  Dump the dishes in your plate and rush off.  Walk by you without even looking at you.  I simply wanted some water and wasabi and ginger to go with my sushi.  Ten minutes later and I can't even get there attention.  Food is crap as well.  I left and walked across to Holy Chuck."}
{"text":"Pretty good as far as AYCE sushi places go, the staff are always nice and professional, the dishes are prepared well and arrive quickly, and they have a good variety of dishes. 
100% I always make sure to save room for the fried banana with ice cream!!! Sooo yummy! :)"}
{"text":"All you can eat sushi, the food was decent, the services were good and quick. Just one waitress was really strict with the eating rule. The first plate she took away, my table and I got scolded for the one salmon sushi that I ate but threw the rice behind. She had gave our table a warning and quite embarrassed us. 
In the end our table couldn't finish two full dishes but the manager was fine with throwing it away for us with no extra charges."}
{"text":"Best all you can eat shushi place, love this, go with friend more than 10 times there. Super friendly staff."}
{"text":"Pad Thai was just noodles and ketchup. Soup was cold. Rolls are ok. Wasabi had no taste. Service is good. Place is very nice."}
{"text":"Perfect Friday night bite with friends! Great options on the menu to choose from and service is excellent! The design and layout is very trendy and clean!"}
{"text":"This place used to be my go-to AYCE sushi spot. But over time the quality of the foods has not been at par. They still have some rolls that are really good, but I rarely come in to dine anymore. Their menu has a lot of variety, especially their dinner menu but if I were to recommend, I would recommend to someone who is a new to eating sushi."}
{"text":"VERY IMPRESSED!   Better than 168 Sushi!

Every table gets an iPad for easy ordering!

I have been to many All You Can East Sushi places, and I have to admit, Shitake Sushi is by far the best I have been to in a long time!

It is better than 168 Sushi and Spook & Fork.

The menu is very extensive including Sushi, Appetizers, Hot Thai and Chinese foods.

The wait staff is very friendly and the service is extremely quick!  From the moment you hit \"Order\" on the ipad, it is just a few minutes and the food is on the table.

Everything we ordered from the menu was very tasty and exceptional quality.

You will not be disappointed! Shitake Sushi can most liley be the best All You Can East in Vaughan, if not Toronto.

To top it off, the decor in the restaurant is outstanding.  THe nicely decorated enviroment resembles that of a high quality restaurant which just adds to the overall experience.

Top Notch!  A+++   10/10

Good job guys!"}
{"text":"If you are a fan of AYCE, Shitake is A-OK. You will find it very similar to other mainstream AYCE places:  a fairly big menu presented on an iPad with the integrated ordering system. Select the tabs and hit the \"+\" sign to ratchet up your order. Efficient and consistent, in a systems-based sort of way. 

I stopped in, bypassing my destination of Holy Chuck next door, thinking \"if it's AYCE Brazillian Churrasco tomorrow, I might want to skip red meat today\".

The sushi is as expected, fresh, with a ratio of about 90% rice to 10% fish. Of course I skipped the heinous \"white tuna\" mystery fish, but at least the Tuna Maki was red tuna. Tempura shrimp was crispy and hot. 

I tried a new dish, Kimchi Fried Rice, a combo I had not experienced before. $16.95 for the lunch, I got away with $18 before tip."}
{"text":"I've been on a mission to check out all of the All You Can Eat Sushi/Thai places in the area and I have to say Shitake surprised me by standing out among the crowd.

The interior of the place was a bit drab and the servers were a bit curt, but pretty much every single thing we ordered (and we ordered a LOT) was top notch.

As with most places in the area, the iPad app is easy to use to order a wide variety of Japanese and Thai dishes, though as usual I leaned way more into the Japanese side of the offerings.

I honestly don't have any real complaints. Food was fresh, served at right temperature, came quickly after ordering, and was really tasty. The servers made sure our beer was kept topped up and that we were always looked after well.

It wasn't perfect, one or two dishes were so-so and again I found the restaurant a bit drab, but I'll definitely be back here again."}
{"text":"Nice decor. Great quality hot food and sushi. Good, fast service. Prices are a little higher than my regular place (168) and the food is as good or better there. Wonton soup was bland otherwise all ok."}
{"text":"Always good quality. Out of the AYCE sushi places in the area, this is the best! Better than Spoon & Fork for sure, with a similar price. Their Japanese food shines more than their Thai, but that's what I go for and it doesn't disappoint."}
{"text":"Wow, absolute best !!!! Decor was modern & chic, staff were friendly & service was superb. & FOOD, where do I begin delicious. best sushi in Vaughan . Mouth watering pad Thai & soups, ( too many to chose from ) the variety here is endless. Really menu for every ones taste & appetite 
Must try!!!"}
{"text":"WORST
SUSHI
EVER!

SUPER
BAD
SERVICE!

The broccoli tastes like it had been washed in dirty toilet water.

The seaweed on the hand rolls was so dry and fishy tasting - in a bad way

They hardly put any fish on the sushi - super paper thin 

Their portions are EXTREMELY small and don't look like the pictures in the menu at ALL

To get a glass of water was like pulling teeth.  We had to ask three times for our drink order (which costs extra - you would THINK they want to sell!)

Every time the server came close to our table, we would ask for Wasabi and Ginger.  Every single time.  Not once did they bring it.  I ended up getting up myself to get it - and then they had the nerve to give me a dirty look!

Food was TERRIBLE.  So many competitive choices in the area that are WAY better!  DO NOT TRY THE CHICKEN - it was NASTY and tasted like rubber.  I'm not even sure if that was even chicken!

And the desserts.  O M G.  Can you say BARF!  They have such nice pictures in their menu, but then throw a 1\" x 1\" small square piece of cake in a small cup and call that dessert.  Not only was the sponge cake stale, the mousse was sour tasting, and the deep fried milk was yellow on the inside.  

We ate less than half of what they gave us and sent most of it back.

AVOID IF YOU CAN - SO MANY BETTER PLACES within a few minutes - I can't see this place lasting more than a few more months.

p.s. they need to \"splurge\" a bit and accept American Express - many businesses use Amex as their corporate cards - you lose a large market by not accepting Amex..."}
{"text":"Service was good, food was exceptional too. Menu was a bit limited but made up for in the dessert department. I would return."}
{"text":"We went there for lunch at 2:30pm. This is an all you can eat place. The service was atrocious! We arrived and the waiter gave us a long speech about how if we over order they will charge us. I understand that they dont want people to over in excess because its wasteful, but he couldve been nicer. Then the sushi comes to the table and its filled with panko bread. There is more panko bread than fish. It was disgusting! I guess they are trying to have their customers fill up with panko bread and rice. I am not from this area, maybe the restaurant is struggling. I will never come back again."}
{"text":"It's different that other the sushi places.. they got a very good Lam on weekends, Love the food..."}
{"text":"Cheap fast food quality for an expensive price. Really didn't like this place. I have been to other all you can eat sushi and Thai that were 100 times better than this place. Will definitely not be going back!"}
{"text":"Shitake is legitimately one of the best all you can eat sushi's I have ever had in the GTA. There is no compromise on freshness, quality, presentation or taste. I love the various options they have available as it suits to many peoples different tastes. So many AYCE places are so cookie cutter with poor quality and taste because quantities can be unlimited but I didn't feel that was the case at all here. Even if i'm not in the area I would
go out of my way to enjoy it again."}
{"text":"Nope nope nope. Flavorless. Inedible. Toronto and the Toronto area have way more to offer than this. The pad thai tastes like it's been marinating in lemons and the sushi was also flavorless. Was pretty sad that the natural flavor from the vegetables overwhelmed the incredibly bland flavors of the dishes. I advise you to look elsewhere for something delicious. Took a few bites and straight to the garbage it went. I tried to find any redeeming quality but for the sake of the patrons, please use more spices!"}
{"text":"This place is horrible. The waitress was rude AF along with the atrocious large sized sushi rolls. They were falling apart, chicken was cold, food quality was absolutely terrible. Do not go here it is a pure dump. The owner should invest little more on better staff than on the decor!"}
{"text":"Pretty good AYCE sushi place. The Ipad ordering system makes things simple and straightforward, the décor is quite nice, and the service level is good. The sushi items are pretty standard, but the incorporation of some Thai-style cuisine makes things a little more exciting. Don't come expecting top-notch sushi and authentic Thai cuisine, but it hits the spot when you're in the mood for some AYCE."}
{"text":"Hmm... I like the atmosphere, very much reminded me of another place I've been to in the Newmarket area of similar cuisine. Shiitake has great options if you have people in your group that don't like sushi. So, a place like this is great for us, since i love sushi, and my wife doesn't like fish at all.

As I mentioned, the atmosphere is pretty cool, and modern. ordering on the iPad's is pretty cool, and the food comes out in a reasonable amount of time, granted they were pretty quite on New Year's Eve when we were here. Most other place's had crazy wait times.

As far as AYCE sushi, I greatly prefer Masa for the rice to fish ratio in their rolls, and food quality, for the other non fish options, in the area I'd go to Spoon & Fork.  All in all, I don't think I'd be back here any time soon."}
{"text":"Its decent AYCE. Trust me, I've had worse. Service isn't that great... they're not too friendly and do not really greet you. But let's be real, you came here for unlimited sushi rolls and food (I hope) and not for smiley faces. I don't bother with rice or noodle dishes because I know it would be the same as all the other sushi AYCE spots in the area. Sub-par quality and likely tasteless (which it is). Portions are SUPER small for some odd reason.  A seaweed salad would come in a condiment dish and can be eaten in one bite (I am NOT exaggerating here). Average food, quality wouldnt be considered super fresh either, but the prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"Shiitake is one of the few AYCE Japanese restaurants in the Hwy 7 and Islington area. Located in a plaza, there is plenty of free parking.

The decor inside is more modern. Deeper colours add to the ambiance, and mirrored walls make the place seem larger than it is.

Not knowing how busy the place gets, I made a reservation, but by the end of the night realized I didn't need one. The place never hit full capacity, so either it's relatively new, the area is not interested in AYCE Japanese, or the food/service is terrible.

Well, I would lean towards the latter on this one. The food was not impressive at all. In fact most of the dishes were barely passable at 2,5 stars, and they were missing some key items, staples like Red Tuna and Salmon Roe.

However, there were a few things in their favor. 1: it's All You Can Eat (AYCE). 2: all their dishes are in really small portions. 3: they have an extensive selection despite missing a some of the staples. 4: Everything is ordered by picture via iPad.

So why 3 stars and not 2 stars? Well although the food was sub par for the most part, I felt that it had enough variety in their menu to conclude the it would be a good place for someone new to sushi to start. So rather then a discouraging 2 stars, I've decided on an encouraging 3 stars for the Newbie.

When I say the portions are small, I really mean it, they're even small for tapas. But that makes them perfect for sampling. Since its AYCE, if you like it, order more! If not, well then it's only a small portion to swallow.

Most dishes are probably between 2-3 stars. The sashimi is on the thin side but forgiven since it's AYCE. The Thai food, well it wasn't Thai, but it's a good place to start if trying something different. The desserts were hit and miss, and probably the weakest items they serve. The one thing they did do nicely for the most part was presentation, especially the sushi/sashimi.

Tonight I think we burned through at least 35 different menu items. See my pics, I've rated each item on each pic individually.

Would I come back? Probably not. Would I recommend? Only to someone I'd be introducing Japanese cuisine to. There is a good enough balance of cooked, raw, and vegetarian dishes to suit everyone, and the mild flavours will not shock a Newbie's palette. It would establish a base for the Newbie, and as they slowly expand their menu selections to determine which ones they like, when they venture to other Japanese restaurants, their experience would only heighten. With that said, I would also not recommend this place to anyone who already knows and enjoys foods from the land of the rising sun...

{"text":"Good food ... but the customer service is really bad .. i m very disappointed... servers were 2 guys on monday lunch time ... they treated us like we went there to eat for free ... server literally threw the foods on us thats how we felt. We wont ever go there again. He even didnt give me the bill he brought the debit machine with the amount of $38 few cents."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I just had a lovely meal at this establishment. We were seated immediately. Our food was brought out quickly. Everything was accurate. Nothing was left out. And everything was tasty. Never a disappointment at Shitake. Will always be back."}
{"text":"Went to Shitake for dinner AYCE.  They have a cash incentive so be sure to bring cash. Ordering of food is through an iPad, so it is very concenient and quick. The sashimi were thickly sliced.  They have some sushi specialty rolls that are innovative and can't be found at other restaurants.  Overall the food was delicious and will definitely return."}
{"text":"The service was not good. The person greeting us at the front wasn't very friendly. When he took us to our table he asked us if we want the buffet and we said yes and he set up our tablet and went away. Like imagine we had no idea what the setup was like.. at least tell us what to do. None of the servers made eye contact or said you're welcome any time we said thank you when they'd bring us our food. Even once the bill was paid (with a tip for this kind of service) he didn't even say thank you. Talk about really feeling like chopped liver! 
Anyways the sushi was good but just because we weren't happy with the service I would never come back.
PS. I don't know if one of the servers noticed people can actually see him but he was picking his nose in the mirror... Really grossed us out actually but at this point it was too late for us to get up and leave."}
