{"text":"Pleasant surprise,  great live music,  good food and awesome service.  Must come back!"}
{"text":"I know this closed down but just in case the owners still read these I wanted to leave my post.  As a latino raised on Puerto Rican cooking and other latino cuisine,  I was unimpressed.  Atmosphere was nice with a 2 man band singing many songs I grew up with.  Food was tasty but was very disappointed when the easiest thing to cook, rice, was not cooked from scratch.  It looked and tasted like the prepackaged Minute Rice you buy in a bag and heat in the microwave for 60 seconds.  Chinese fast food makes rice from scratch!"}
{"text":"I went here with my husband to find this place closed. I guess it closed  down because it had a sign. Was hoping to try a Cuban sandwich."}
{"text":"Food was really flavorful. I had the churrasco, it was nice size portion I couldn't finish it all."}
{"text":"I had a nice dinner here with my daughter. The food was good and the service was decent.  A man was playing guitar and singing which added a nice touch.   We started with the crispy yucca with creamy spinach dip. The portion size was good and both the dip and the yucca had a good flavor..   I had the bistro steak with Uruguayan chimichurri sauce which was cooked exactly as requested and was very delicious and tender.  The arroz congris was good if a bit plain but the sauteed veggies where very good.  All around a very satisfying meal especially considering the reasonable price.    My daughter had the Penne Past with Sofrito Sauce.  The sauce was out of the ordinary but was very good and the portion size was good.  It probably could have used a few more vegetables but overall it was very good.    We definitely will be dining here again."}
{"text":"Latin Fusion I would not recommend this place to know one for the following reasons: 1. Food was bland 2. Food was greasy 3.$13.95 and the portion was small. 4. My pork that I order was all fat.   Not worth your time."}
{"text":"Gordon Ramsay needs to fix this restaurant! I'm sad for whoever invested their money. Food service ingredients, jumbled menu with no focus, bland or over salted food... Avoid."}
{"text":"Bought a coupon at restaurant.com to go try out this place and when we got there it was closed with a sign in the door stating that the place was available to lease. They didn't last very long at all. It's the curse of that shopping center I assume and the fact that you are pulling into a shares parking lot with Little Caesar's Pizza and Wal Mart. Oh well on to the next new place"}
{"text":"Outstanding Latin food.  Ribs are to die for.  Shrimp and chicken dishes also excellent. Well seasoned, perfectly cooked. Bread is warm and fresh.  Nice atmosphere with live music.  Owner very cordial, and he visits each table.  Restaurant is spotlessly clean.  Waiter knowledgeable about food, was able to accurately describe dishes and make suggestions.  A little slow to take our dinner order after we ordered drinks, and mixed drinks were very weak. Two of our party had specialty drinks, neither of us thought there was any alcohol at all.  I only tasted the coconut and mint.  Food was delivered promptly.  Good size portions, reasonably priced.   Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The mojitos were outstanding!! The meal including appetizer was great. There were 15 in my party and everyone loved their entrees. The service was okay, very slow (to his defense it was Mother's Day)."}
{"text":"Order the Mahi-mahi tacos & was pleasantly surprised. Food was well seasoned & fresh flavors. My husband ordered the roasted pork with stir fried veggies. His food was also very well seasoned & the veggies had a delicious flavor. The kids ordered off the kids menu which provided standard choices. However, my son's Mac & cheese was homemade, not store brought powdered or processed. The sauce was really good. They used penne pasta, so he got full quickly. My only complaint was I needed one more taco to get full, lol. Two was not enough. The prices are reasonable, nothing over $15. Can't beat that!"}
{"text":"What a great addition LC 21 Latin Fusion Bar & Bistro is to the Charlotte dining scene and absolutely the best restaurant in the Crownpoint area! We  were in the area and stumbled on this restaurant Friday night and were so impressed,  we now look forward  to going back again and again.   The food is delicious, tthe presentation is impressive and the wait staff is very attentive, accommodating, and friendly!  The yuca chips with creamed spinach appetizer was amazing, the cerviche was deliciou,s and the roast chicken entree was outstanding! Looking around at what other tables ordered, everything here seems to be a winner!"}
{"text":"2.5 Stars ... unfortunately.  The restaurant is located in a former steak house, looks like almost nothing was changed. Place is clean and \"newish\" looking. Not fancy but not shabby either for a cheap restaurant.   $6 lunch special - Soup, 4 choices of meat, one side. It came with a \"spicy\" (not very) tortilla soup, not crazy about it. One meat option was Ropa Vieja but made with chicken instead of beef, a strange choice.Instead we chose the classic \"marinated overnight, slow cooked\" roast pork - which I'm sure was finished on the grill-  acceptable considering the price, and generic fries on the side   3 stars.  $10 lunch portion 8oz Churrasco steak with salad and a side. The presentation was nice but nothing else was. The tiny steak was neither Churrasco nor even a generic skirt steak - known as Fajita meat locally - I don't know what part of the cow they extracted that cut from but it was tough and totally lean (like rump or rumsteak). To boot the meat was cooked on low heat, it hadn't been seared and was the same shade of brown on the surface and in the middle - never mind I had asked for medium rare. Too bad because the marinade they had used tasted quite nice.   The side I chose was congri (rice and black beans) dry and tasteless, the salad was mainly lettuce, the description of the curry mango dressing sounded great but only had a vaguely sweet taste.    Dinner dishes with 2 sides are $14-20 which I think is absurdly overpriced considering the level of cooking. The owners claim to represent 21 Latin countries but to me everything tasted of heavily Americanized Mexican without any resemblance to the real thing.   There's such a dearth of decent restaurants in this area I was really hoping for better."}
{"text":"I wanted Latin Fusion LC21 to be better but this was really a middle-of-the-road meal. Items that were tasty: chicken empinada, roast pork, Don Ramon red wine. Food that was average included their mashed potatoes and cheese empinada. On the down side their side items were flavorless including the vegetables and Arroz Congris (beans & rice).  Service was good and friendly and 'live' music was fantastic. Doubtful that we will go back.  We preferred Los Paisas as their food was so delicious."}
{"text":"I purchased a groupon to try out LC21 since it's close to home and I'm all for the convenience of close by. We went around 7 last Friday to finally check it out (and my groupon was about to expire!)  I can't help but laugh when you walk in a restaurant and the host/hostess asks \"Do you have a reservation?\" and you look around and notice the place is practically dead! Really? No, I did not have reservations, but luckily they fit us in!   Our waiter, Eddie, promptly greeted us and brought waters. We decided on a wine and that came out quickly too. We started with the empanadas (one of each: beef, cheese & chicken) and we both ordered the Churrasco steak - I had the plantains and arroz congris (rice with black beans).   I set into this with mediocre expectations - after all it's in a Walmart shopping center, next to a Steak & Shake - plus some of the reviews I read were very meh. I have to say I was impressed with the food! The steak was truly delicious - and very reasonably priced at 13.99. I had enough left over for lunch the next day. The plantains and empanadas were also tasty - wish I had some of those left over too!  It was pretty slow for a Friday, less than 50% full, but it was pretty lively and they had live music. I guess with enough vino you can pretend you aren't in a Walmart shopping center but instead visiting one of the 21 countries they claim to offer cuisine from!  I would definitely check them out again!"}
{"text":"Great experience this evening. Enjoyed delicious drinks at the bar  with Kyle and good service. The live music was quiet enough to allow you to enjoy conversation while eating dinner, but definitely added a lot to the atmosphere.  The food was excellent, with great flavors and freshly prepared ingredients. Had the tostones, Cuban avacado salad, and Roasted Pork that was fall off the bone delicious!"}
{"text":"The empanadas were a bit dry, with too much potato but not bad. The main courses were very flavorful and good portions . Our waiter was very friendly and helpful , the young lady who refills water didn't seem like she was pleased to be there, she needs to smile it's not good frowning being that this is a new resturant . I would recommend this spot if you like Latin/Spanish flavors."}
{"text":"Cute restaurant. Service was friendly. Food was blah, half chicken and one side was a joke, more like half a pigeon with 3 slices of tostones. Steak was NOT churrasco, over cooked on the grill and tasteless. Lunch portions with upscale dinner prices which to me it can be worth it if you get the flavor and this was not the case. If you like water and fried yuca that's the place to go. Sticking with Viva Chicken for the best peruvian/latin food hands down in the Charlotte area."}
{"text":"Went for lunch a few days ago.  On the plus side: The staff was very friendly and helpful.  The Cuban sandwich was really good.  The ribeye steak was a little thin, but was cooked perfectly and a good deal for lunch.  It was very clean (it's new - hope they keep it up).  On the minus side: The empanadas weren't very good (seemed like frozen, prepackaged stuff).  The salad looked pretty beat up and the dressing didn't have much flavor.   Short story: A couple of tweaks and they'd be pretty good. They have feedback cards, so if you go, use them (politely, of course)."}
