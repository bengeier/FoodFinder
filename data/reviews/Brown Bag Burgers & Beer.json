{"text":"Great place to stop for s burger and Long Island ice tea. I suggest you build your own burger with garlic mayo."}
{"text":"Just came in was seated behind a wall with view of home depot parking lot.plenty of open seating in front.placed order only to find out later on another menu there were more options.waitress never let us know .been here before loved it however service today so far not so much!!"}
{"text":"The place looks nice. Service so so... The burgers were greasy and tasteless. My hubby and I ordered the same All American burgers. My burger meat was half thin than the other. I told the staff about it. They brought me another one. It was a bit bigger but still not the same...  Not worth the money."}
{"text":"You better like mayo on your sub. Limited selecttion of options for. Subs. Based on other reviews the burgers are inconsistent and possibly greasy.  IF BEER is your REAL INTEREST; it might. be your kind of place."}
{"text":"Great service. Food was delicious !!! Bartender was informative, friendly and helpful.  Josh was knowledgable regarding craft beers!!!!! Thanks. Spread the word"}
{"text":"This is a nice addition to Lorain- finally not another pizza place or massive chain restaurant! The servers are very nice here (yes there are servers), the restaurant is very clean all the time and the bar has a lot of different drafts on tap. The french onion soup here is so so good. I might actually like it better than anything else on the menu. The burgers are good and affordable. This is a cheap place to eat if you are looking to save some cash."}
{"text":"This is a great burger place! We ordered an All American burger and fries! Delicious.  Patio space is great and dog friendly! Beverages specials too!"}
{"text":"I love brown bag burgers. They're fresh and made to order and a great size.  Be careful when ordering fries, they give you a crazy amount! I like to enjoy a drink when i come here.  Nothing to fancy ,but a full bar service.  So not your typical fast food restaurant.  The wings are very good too. . My favorite is the garlic parm.  Tonight i found out they have servers most of the time ...other times I've ordered at the counter and when the food was done I've had to go get it. .so nice to be waited on"}
{"text":"Fast casual feel but not very fast!  Sunday afternoon @ 2 pm and the restaurant was not busy, majority of the tables were open, but we had to wait 10 minutes to be seated. Food is good, not great and is reasonably priced. The $5 kids meals include fries and a drink. My kids were happy. The bacon ranch grilled chicken sandwich ($5.99) was very good as was the grilled chicken salad (7.99). Food was served hot and fresh and our waitress did a nice job with refills etc....    I would recommend if you are in the area but it is not worth a special trip. It does have a nice selection of beer, which was a bonus and the restaurant was very clean.   Rated 4 stars due to the wait in the beginning. Seems like an easy fix."}
{"text":"Update: they contacted me and apologized for closing early and gave me a free meal for the inconvenience  (updated to correct spelling error)"}
{"text":"Awesome place! Great burgers, great fries and beer Fun atmosphere and a great casual place to hang out, get good food and catch a game if you want"}
{"text":"I want to like it and see it succeed but it is so poorly run, this is my last time, walked out last time after being ignored for 15 minutes in a less than half full restaurant  Waiting 25 minutes for a burger in a lightly filled restaurant while cooks hang around chatting with staff"}
{"text":"We love Brown Bag! Have been going since they opened and everything is always extremely fresh and delicious. We have done dine-in, carry out, and have placed a few large orders ahead of time and never have had a problem.  It's very family friendly and our kids love it as well. Love that they offer turkey burgers! Not many places offer them and know how to make them without drying out the meat completely. Their fresh fries are just as delicious.  There aren't ma t restaurants that are good and offer carry out. With two kids and a busy life it's nice to have that option."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this place for a while, the name kinda gave me pause. I feel so stupid that it did. You're greeted as if you're friends, seated quick, waitresses are attentive (plus she was an Alabama crimson tide fan I love that) portions are huge and filling, we (my husband) and I started with nachos and a bowl of chili, delicious!, I am a go to ribs girl and they are so good, the fries are huge in portion and delicious, I did the  cheese on top option sooo glad I did, hubby got a burger and loved it and he did plain fries and love those. Sooo coming by back soon!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome food! Very clean place with friendly staff.  If you are looking for a great tasting burger (and beer), then you found it right here."}
{"text":"We decided to try this place due to all the hype. The burgers we had were not bad but not the best. The meat was tender but needed more flavor. Our server was on point and the cooks were quick to make our order. The burgers are pricy but the good thing is they can be ordered in different sizes. Restaurant is clean and the atmosphere was pleasant. Would we go again? Maybe but it's not likely."}
{"text":"Burgers were Ok. Nothing to write home about. The toppings on burger were very tasty, but VERY skimpy. When I asked where the pico de gallo was on my burger, the \"manager\" was quite unfriendly. He told me the pico de gallo was on the burger. I recommended that for $6.99, there should be a little more. Lol, \"manager\" said I could buy extra for 90Â¢ more!! Food was tasty, but overpriced. I don't mind paying any price, but please give me my dollar's worth. Brown Bag was definitely lacking in hospitality,(maybe a class in hospitality) which is half the pleasure in dining out. So, for two of us, our bill came to $24. Burger, fries & drink. I don't think I'll be going back too soon. Come on Brown Bag, be more generous with those burger toppings!  I must say, the cook was friendly.  Fries are good..."}
{"text":"Amazing food alot of options for the build your own burger the bacon cheese fries are awesome"}
{"text":"I would not recommend this place to anyone. We sat at home trying to decide what to eat before we finally settled on brown bag. We had never been here before and we're excited to try something new. We were sat and 15 min later they take our drink order. Then we ended up sitting there for another hour and a half before anyone even came to us, even then we had to call the server over to us. They restaurant wasn't busy and we still had to wait a ridiculous amount of time. We ended up just leaving and not eating. Huge disappointment!!!!"}
{"text":"Happened upon Brown Bag Burgers and Beer after spending too much money at Rue 21, next door. Service here is friendly and attentive. The menu has so many burger, grilled chicken and veggie burger options. I opted for the Patty Melt with a side of sweet potato fries. We also ordered French fries topped with bacon, cheese and sour cream and an original burger. Yum. Single patty burger is $5.99. This is not a fast food restaurant by any means, and it isn't supposed to be. Kitchen is somewhat slow but I'm hopeful that with experience they will speed it up.  I will be returning."}
{"text":"I've always had a good experience here. The food has always been good and the service has been decent (no worse then you'll get most places and better then some places i have been). I like that this location opened up because it's much closer then their North Olmstead location.  I plan on going back here again. Good stuff."}
{"text":"With a name like Brown Bag Burgers, we weren't sure what to expect, but were super happy with our stop.   The atmosphere is very nice and the restaurant is clean.   You can sit at the bar, tables, or order take out.    We both started with a chocolate peanut butter milkshake and they were wonderful.   My husband had a patty melt and I had something called the Meatanator (or something like that), along with a medium fries.  The patty melt arrived on Texas toast and was nice and steamy hot.   The bread was fresh and the burger was good.   He wished he had gotten a double burger.    My sandwich was amazing.   A burger with ham, salami and maybe some other meat, and topped with Italian dressing and another sauce.  I opted for no banana peppers.   The flavors were great together.   The medium fries were way more than we needed.   They were super hot and just like fair fries.   Very good.  My only problem is the name.   Not a good name for a great burger place.   Brown bag makes me think of deli lunch meat.   We almost didn't stop because of the name."}
{"text":"Bad waitress this time. We wish they would go back to having no waitress.  Will go to the north Olmsted location from now on."}
{"text":"Went there for the first time I was not impressed. To me it's not a restaurant it's more like a pub. I feel that for the portion of food that my husband and I received it was okay it was very overpriced. The mail that I ordered was decent the only thing I really liked about my meal was the fries the burger was dry and it was not hot so with that being said I am not going to return."}
{"text":"Decent burger. Good fries. Great beer selection. Something for everyone on the menu. Chill atmosphere. The bartender was very friendly and attentive. It definitely made my list for a cool Saturday afternoon hangout spot to watch a game and kick back with above-average food and drink. Better than 5 Guys because it's a destination, not just eat-and-run. So long as the high quality and superior service is maintained we will return again and again."}
{"text":"I've only been here twice but both times were delicious.  The place is really clean and has a full service bar"}
{"text":"Great food and beer only thing was that I had to order it a second time before I received my beer..."}
{"text":"Who knew that a restaurant named Brown Bag would be so good! My wife and I were in the mood for a good hamburger and we were planning to drive to Rocky River to a burger place a friend recommended. However, we were starving and RR was a 30+ minute drive. I recalled someone mentioning the Brown Bag, which is much closer to our home, so we decided to give it a try. We were very happy that we decided to do so.  The restaurant is relatively small and a bit industrial in design. There is a small bar and the restaurant offers a nice selection of craft beer. We had some driving to do, so we opted to order a chocolate-peanut butter milk shake. It was delicious and highly recommend.   I ordered a patty melt and my wife a specialty burger called The Meatanater. She enjoyed her burger. Although the patty melt was supposed to involve a half pound hamburger, it seemed a bit thin to me. However, it did taste good. My trouble is that I compare all hamburgers to Five Guys, which is a very high standard to meet.   We split an order of fries, which was huge and very good.  We will definitely return in the future."}
{"text":"I liked the build your own burger on the menu and the fact that you can get a lettuce wrap rather than a bun.  Also that you can pick the items you want on it and I think you can choose eight which is huge.    Also a double burger if you are wanting a high protein low carb meal.  Food was great service was great!"}
{"text":"The food is really good but the kitchen can not keep up when there is volume in the room. 30 mins for a shrimp burger and some fries is a little ridiculous. our server alex was nice but a bit overwhelmed also. overall not a great choice on a busy night. guess ill try lunch next time."}
{"text":"This place is great! From the delicious smells wafting into the parking lot to the amazing burgers, our experience was terrific. They had a good selection of beer on tap and the service was excellent. We tried the Dubliner burger and the Godfather; both were mouth watering good. Huge portion of fries. Lorain needs a great place like this that's friendly and easy on the wallet. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Good value great food. I was at Walmart getting oil changes on 2 vehicles while on a long road trip. I was tired, hungry and grungy. The gals at Brown Bag treated me greatl. Service from the door to my table, from a drink to my meal order, from food to my check. Nothing was less than good. The food flavor was great and the meal size was large. My large order of one of their upgraded fries, around $8, was a serving almost too big for 2 guys, we split that and each had our own large burgers. We came in very hungry and left full."}
