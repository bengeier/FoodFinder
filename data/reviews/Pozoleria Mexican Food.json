{"text":"Unreal pozole. Making pozole is a generations old tradition in my wife's family, and this was some of the best we've ever had in a restaurant. Also incredibly rich and delicious taco de cabeza (not always easy to find, even in Phoenix) and delicious horchata. Every one is very kind and service is great."}
{"text":"It's hard 2 find a good Mexican Restaurant but I finally found 1. This little hole in the wall had one of the best GREEN pozole I've ever had. 4 sure going back to try the white pozole!"}
{"text":"This place has great posole, and it's all I order when I go there.  People are nice, and appreciate your business!  On my most recent visit I had the Green Posole and it was absolutely fantastic!  Rough area, they close early for a reason.  Not a good place to hang around after dark!  Look out for transients and pan handlers out front of other businesses next door!"}
{"text":"Service was great from an older waitress that was very attentive.  An younger waitress had like snappy attitude whenever we asked for anything.  If you are a fan of Guerrero pozole which is different than Jalisco traditional pozole, I could see you liking this.  Since I am a fan of the Jalisco varierty, did not hit the spot for me.  The spices were off or lack off, everything else was above average!  Would like to find a specialty Jalisco Pozole place that does this dish right.  The next I had my mom make the real thing at home, and she knock it out of the partk!!"}
{"text":"It's the real deal!  If you want authentic, home-made Mexican food this place delivers the goodness.  You'll think your Nana has cooked for you.  Their pozole soup is fantastic!"}
{"text":"Oh my goodness, the best food! Be sure to have the curry lentil soup, to die for! The food is made from scratch. The outdoors area is a nice place to dine but if the weather is to cool or to hot, the little cafe is beautifully appointed. I love it here."}
{"text":"The pozole was very tasty! However they didn't have chips and salsa and to me every Mexican spot needs to have that. Things seemed a bit pricey. They only had canned and bottled drinks. If you want good pozole get over there!!!"}
{"text":"Daaaaaaaaang gurl this was the best Pozole of my life. I ate fat then ordered 2 more to go! The service was good, the food was good, the mural on the wall was cute, and that's all that matters."}
{"text":"Pozoleria Guerrero is another little Mexican in the near-central Phoenix area.  Definitely not a bad experience and the atmosphere inside is a lot more pleasant than you would assume when driving by (think shady area).  Of course, this is the case with many of Phoenix's best Mexican spots.    The atmosphere inside was nice, the server was really friendly and helped out almost immediately.  Pozoleria Guerrero is open on Sundays which is nice as well.  The menu is fairly extensive, including the usual assortment of tacos, tortas, burritos, quesadillas, and of course pozole.  I decided to go with their specialty and got the pozole Rojo.  For those who don't know what pozole is, it's a type of pork stew that has little pieces of hominy blended in.  The spicing is excellent, and it left me with a runny nose.  A normal bowl will run you $7.25.  Other items on the menu were reasonable, with tacos ranging from a buck to $1.25.  The salsa was interesting and really spicy but good as well, although the chips were thin and left something to be desired.  All in all Pozoleria Guerrero #1 was a decent spot and I think it comes down to whether you want to get pozole.  In the future if I get a hankering I will definitely be returning.  I can't comment on the tacos, etc. yet, but plan to try them in the future!"}
{"text":"Good flavors and variety of Mexican food. Make sure you arrive early on weekends or you might have to wait for a bit (10-15min)."}
{"text":"Not one to usually complain, but wow.  Pretty terrible experience here.  Didn't even get to have the food because we had to wait so long.  First off, this place is in a pretty bad part of town.  Right across from a correctional facility.  We sat down and a server didn't come to take our drink order for 10 minutes.  Then when we placed our order, we waited another 15 minutes.  Wondering what happened to our order, we asked the waitress to check on it and she said the kitchen had lost it.  When we asked if they could just make ours now, she said there were other orders before ours. The pozole was already made...   So we just decided to leave. They didn't even offer to comp the drinks lol."}
{"text":"Really good food!!! Don't let the outside of the building fool you. Really good and nice service."}
{"text":"This is the best pozole spot in Phoenix!!  I have tried pozole in many different places (most way more expensive than this place) but this is still #1!!!  Keep coming back to it. Red pozole all the way!"}
{"text":"I went to a wedding the night before and I ate everything I could the next day at 3 different restaurants to shake the booze off...  The only thing that worked was the red pozole with chicharron. I was in heaven and fully functioning an hour later. The ladies that work here are very nice, recommended the red pozole and well, I'm definitely coming back. Luckily the serving was so plentiful, we had enough for breakfast the next day too."}
{"text":"Best pozole and menudo we ever had! Had to order some more menudo to-go to take back home."}
{"text":"Great food and a wonderful place to come eat!! Staff is super friendly and very prompt"}
{"text":"Ambiance: Small Mexican restaurant located in a strip mall in a rough part of Phoenix. Inside has 14 tables. Sparsely decorated but on par for your average Mexican restaurant. Has an hole-in-the-wall Mexican vibe which to me usually means authentic Mexican food will be served. Patrons are usually Latino with a token white dude for good measure (usually me).  Food: This is the place to get your Posole fix. Their red (spicy) and green Posole is amazingly good (never had their white Posole). The hominy in their Posole is the freshest and largest I've seen. The portions of the Posole is more than generous, I can rarely finish it. They also have other Mexican dishes. Their chili rellano is ok but nothing spectacular. Their Huarache is quite good.  Price: Very reasonable.  Service: Very friendly.  Overall: the place to go for Posole!"}
{"text":"The red pozole was wonderful! The neighborhood is a bit sketchy. I wouldn't go alone. But the restaurant felt safe and was clean. The service was very good and very fast. I'll be back to try everything on the menu."}
{"text":"No doubt best Mexican pozoleria and caldos are found in hole in the wall restaurants like this one. Caldo de res is the best in Phoenix and the guarache are delicious.   Kiss your hangovers good bye with their weekend morning sopas. Soup so good make you wanna go back to sleep."}
{"text":"Good service and great food. I had the pozole. It was fantastic but SUPER spicy. I'll definitely? go back and try other food on the menu."}
{"text":"Friendly service and more importantly, delicious Mexican food that is actually authentic. The pozole rojo is especially a standout with a deep, rich and complex flavor that is difficult to achieve with this dish. Fantastic."}
{"text":"Pozole is great. Slow service and took a time to acknowledge me. Location isn't the best spot, but food is worth the drive."}
{"text":"Best red and green pozole in town. Worth the drive! They have other food for little kids if they won't eat pozole."}
{"text":"This place is great. I really like they give you avocado, un chicharron, and all the other fixings for your pozole. They also hook you up with some free chips and salsa while you wait. The prices are very decent for pozole (7.50) and they have three  kinds (white, green, and red). At this point, I have eaten their pozole so much that I don;t think I will order it next time. Next time I will try their burritos or other dishes. The only feedback I would give is that sometimes they only have 1 or 2 people working which makes it hard to get someone's attention when you need something."}
{"text":"I woke up craving Pozole one day, and was able to find this gem with highly rated reviews! I ordered flautas de carne and pollo (a la Carte) topped with sour cream and lettuce and shared a Pozole rojo with my friend to try more variety. It got pretty packed for a Sunday around 11- 12p but the food came out pretty quickly.  The flautas were crispy and the hot sauce they provided was authentic! I would recommend the chicken over carne asada though. They charge $1.50 for pico de Gallo, but give plenty and for orders of tortilla as well.  The pozole was really good, best I've had in The Valley. I added lime, onions, and the hot chili. YUM.  Would definitely be back anytime I'm craving for Pozole!"}
{"text":"This is the best pozole place I know! Great service and very clean place. Had an amazing experience eating here. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"The red pozole is really good!!! It comes with a piece of chicharr√≥n on the side. The chilles rellenos are also really good. Authentic Mexican food is the best!!"}
{"text":"Food was good, came specially for the pazole and was pleased. Although the waitress had spilled drinks and stained my friends shirt when she had brought them out and didn't do anything about it or to make the situation better."}
{"text":"Yummy!  My friend and I got both the red and green pozole to try and share both. We both liked the red one since it seemed more flavorful but if you want a kick, oddly enough the green one was more spicy. Not extremely hot but a good kick. Huge portions.  Loved that it came with chicharron instead of chips. They even fry the chicharron in house. Will be back to try more!   When you enter, choose the door on the right with the food. Looks like you shouldn't enter that one but it's the right one. The one on the left is a hair salon. Definitely no pozole there. Lol."}
{"text":"This is the best place to get pozole in Arizona . It's real Mexican food and taste amazing . I live 40 minutes away and still make the trip out to eat here !"}
{"text":"Small clean fast pozoleria. We had a variety of Mexican and American breakfast and it was fantastic!"}
{"text":"Whole in the wall but oh so worth it!!! I had a sope & it was huge & delicious! Service was fast and the waitress is extremely nice! The gorditas are a good choice tooooo! Must try if u havent!"}
{"text":"Was searching around for some Pozole and came across this place in Phoenix. Kind of a dive, but in my experiences one of best places to eat and this place is no exception. Service was great place was clean. Pozole was outstanding, fresh and the carne was so tender I cut it with the spoon. With this place definitely don't judge a book by its cover."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Pozole in Phoenix!  It's next to a prison but I would risk my safety any day to eat here again!  Very nice service staff and clean restaurant."}
{"text":"Had lunch here with the kiddos. had a craving for some posole it was good up until my kid found a hair in his food. They didn't offer to make him another dish. When I got the bill they had charged me for half a plate of food my kid didn't even eat."}
{"text":"Aut√©ntico, r√°pido y delicioso. I felt a cold coming, achy body and all and the Caldo De Res bounced me back quick!"}
{"text":"Tasty, friendly, fast and authentic. I had the red pozole with bread on the side. It was hot, seasoned well and delicious. The other menu items like the chile relleno and the tortas look amazing. Coke products and Mexican drinks are your drink options."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place for their soups! Wow!! I actually stumbled across this place on the web feeling really sick and desperately seeking some authentic soup. When I discovered this place , I ordered the Caldo de Res and I was kinda skeptical at first about the take out portion. Boy was I absolutely wrong for thinking that! This is the first place I've been to where there not greedy about their portion sizes. I had chunks of meat,  Tons of vegetables and rich homemade broth all in one big ass cup! It was so delicious that It reminded me of my tatas caldo that he use to make me as a child. What a great experience this was for me. I will definitely be back to try their posole and their caldo de polo. Highly recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"This is a small restaurant, but the food there serve is actually very good, far better than what i thought i would get.  The plus side is that it's an actual Restuarant not one is the chain things they have in abundance or here. And what that means is that the food is all made to order and nor just heated up.  The prices are fair and service is always fast, while the service is not exactly memorable or is still friendly, and overall pretty good. It's not too far from home so for me that's a plus. There's only a small handful of restaurants that are close to me, and this is one of maybe three thati go to on a regular basis.   The rest are not really worth mentioning much less actually go to.  It is with checking out though"}
{"text":"The other day I had a craving for Pozole...I searched and found Pozoleria Guerrero...and not being a car owner, waited for the 3 bus...a half hour late, I got on the bus, hoping that my trip would be worthwhile. A smiling face greeted me from the cash register and I ordered the red, with additional \"heat\" to take out  A relatively short wait brought a large bag.  Another wait for the bus, and I arrived home. The package contained the soup, another some crunchy Chicharr√≥n, and another a lime, avocado, and chopped onion and lettuce. The portion of soup was large, with large pieces of pulled meat and lots of tender hominy.  Honestly, I was almost intoxicated...this was something special. All too often, Pozole and Menudo are often watery, greasy concoctions...decent, but I'd honestly never realized that this dish, in the right hands, could knock me off my feet. Not for spiciness, but for deep.rich flavor, offered with the perfect garnishes and substantial amounts of meat and hominy.  I just came back from my second trip tonight, where I brought a friend (I'd been raving to her about this place) who (not a pozole/menudo fan) was also stunned by how good it was...as was her mate. This is why Pozole is such a popular dish in Mexico...it's hearty, tasty, satisfying and a meal unto itself. This is the place where you get \"the good stuff\"...not messed around with, not tarted up and pricey. If you're lookng for atmosphere, brilliant presentations, or interpretations of Mexican cuisine...this isn't your place. People crabbing about the part of town it's in...I'm sure there's a Taco Bell, Chipotle  or some other chain restaurant near you...but some of the best restaurants can't afford the location and frills.  But, if your looking for food with heart and soul...take a trip to the real world and some wonderful Polozole...."}
{"text":"The pozole here is delicious and service is fast and friendly. We got our fair share of hot bowls during this winter, and each was as amazing as the last. One of the best hole in the walls Ive been to in a long time. They have red and white pozole, and a variety of other Mexican foods available. Havent tried many of the other options, but the pozole and caldos here are great. Highly recommend to anyone who appreciates homemade, tasty Mexican food."}
{"text":"I have absolutely nothing, but great things to say about this local restaurant. My party ordered the menudo, pozole, chile rellenos and mole rojo. All of the items were delicious and well prepared. I would highly recommend this place. Great customer service, great prices and great food!!!!   Thank you and God bless."}
{"text":"Very good posole served daily.. ! Love it to go early morning before work. The odd part is that they give it to you with a chicharon not bread. I love piggie but it's odd. The tacos are yummy aswell. Would go again yes and tell evryone. !"}
