{"text":"Yummy food prepared by a guy who obviously loves what he does! He kicks ass behind the counter 24/7 and always has a huge smile on his face. 
Absolutely recommend"}
{"text":"I give this place a 2 because the food isn't bad but it's not great. When you have \"BBQ\" in your title, that's what I hoped for/expected. This is probably one notch above Swiss Chalet...which isn't necessarily the best food for me. I would pass if you're hoping for great food...if you want a Swiss Chalet experience (minus Chalet sauce and homecut fried) but not really a fan of SC, then here's your spot. Rotisserie chicken and fries at your service"}
{"text":"Absolute garbage... I've never had food this disgusting... if you can even call this food.. Look at the pictures.... does this look like ribs to you? Chunks of meat in a Stew.... And the smell... wow... this place should go out of business... horrific... $70 down the drain."}
{"text":"Great ribs. This is my new favourite rib place.  The ribs I ordered had the sweet bbq sauce and had the perfect fall off the bone texture."}
{"text":"The chicken's not bad, it's well cooked and not dry, however.. having just got back from the states this ain't no bbq.  It's a good roasted chicken, but I was so excited to be driving by and saw BBQ I almost killed a few dozen people pulling over to park my car.

It's a take out place with limited seating, which was fine by me.

But once I saw him pull out a chicken from a warming box and stick it in the oven, I wanted to change my mind.  I asked him how long they smoked their chicken, and he replied, it's not smoked by roasted in the oven.  

Anyways.. what's done is done.. and went through with the order.  As I said, the chicken itself was not bad at all!  It's just not what I was looking for."}
{"text":"Stopped by this place after a friend recommended it to me. The place was very inviting and the smell alone would carry you in. I asked what was the best thing and was told everything!! So I ended up ordered the 1/4 chicken white meat, which comes
With fries and. A side of either macaroni, potatoes or coleslaw. (Went with macaroni..was pretty good)

Cut a long story short the meal was very delicious not only was the bbq chicken cooked to perfection but the serving size was perfect. 

Since than have been back a second time and have tried the bbq chicken sandwich. It wasn't too bad but the chicken dinner would definitely be the highlight!!"}
{"text":"This was terrible for us.  The meat was not freshly cooked for sure - it was dry and old tasting. 

We ordered
Sweet Potato Fries - they were good.  Greek Salad - was ok, Family Meal 
+ Whole Chicken - not good.
Rice, Coleslaw, Chicken Sauce: BBQ - ok
Full Rack Ribs - not good"}
{"text":"This review is based on a delivery order as I have never been into the restaurant. Ordered the half rack ribs + chicken with fries.

First off I was surprised there's only 4 reviews, perhaps the restaurant's name and decor is not very attractive.

I was pleasantly surprised with the order. Portions are large and delicious. Don't listen to the typical elitist BBQ reviewers, they complain too much. I too have been to the states and know how great they have it there, but the review is not a world comparison of BBQ restaurants, it is just this restaurant. The reality is there isn't any better BBQ in this area at all making George's the best.

It was tasty and filling and I hope my next order will be as good as the first! I hope the restaurant can get more customers as well so they can keep doing what they do.


edit: tried it again, was definitely very disappointing the second time..."}
