{"text":"Food is OK but way overpriced. \"Hot\" brisket sandwich was COLD. Chicken Parmesan sandwich was wrapped in tin foil. I had to pick foil out of the cheese.  I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Stopped there for lunch. Very disappointing. The sandwich was rather tasteless and a bit dry except for the one corner of the sandwich where all the mayonnaise seem to placed. Personally, I think I've had equally as good if not better sandwiches at Subway."}
{"text":"Hands down BEST BURRITO in the valley. Family owned and operated. I have been. Coming here for years. Just do it!"}
{"text":"Sandwich was ok, but the service was terrible...we stopped in an hour before close and the staff would not serve us anything from their hot sandwich menu. They were very unwelcoming even after hearing this was our first time in, I felt like ordering anything was just a bother to them. First and last time for us, there are plenty of other small restaurants in the area that actually appreciate their customers."}
{"text":"Great Italian sub, also the greek salad is good too.  Customer service not so great....  We do love supporting local businesses.  Restaurant was busy for lunch  but unkept, there were picture frames and extra stuff blocking tables and on tables, so we could barely squeeze into our table from boxes etc..."}
{"text":"Food is ok. Service sucks. Staff makes me feel like I should not ask for a sandwich. Girl was on her cell phone and did not hang up to take my order.  Is it too much to ask for service with a smile? They make sure you see their tip jar."}
{"text":"I so wanted to like this place.  When we went there was no one there.  That is never a good sign for a foodie.  Then the person at the counter acted like we bothered them.  our food was being made and someone took down some regular bread for one of the sandwiches ???  That's why you go to a deli for the bread.  When the food came it was pretty okay but nothing that really sent it over the edge.  I really hope they desire to fix some things cause it has potential but you are in Phoenix the eating out capital of the US.  You have to bring your A game and they did not."}
{"text":"We take the family once a month on a Saturday for the amazing breakfast burritos!!! Kids love it and it's slow enough that they can move around freely or we can sit outside when weather is nice :). We bring all our friends here to try the burritos and they say they are the best they have had!!"}
{"text":"This mouthy Dago needs a lesson in customer service. Plus he treats his help like crap. ( A true test of an asshle owner) You idiots that pass off this poor behavior as New York -ese  should go back there."}
{"text":"The place itself is nice. Subs are ok, all the pre-cooked food is dry and salty..the owner is  Rude ..! After about three visits no more."}
{"text":"Great for breakfast & lunch.  Their Mexicana burrito made with chorizo, egg, and potatoes if you like has a nice kick to it when you add their own salsa to it.

Their beef brisket sandwich for lunch is amazing!"}
{"text":"False advertising, they say they deliver & they do, but they do no tell you they only deliver to companies not residences!  THAT REALLY, REALLY SUCKS, EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED!!!!"}
{"text":"One of the favorites around my office.... Great subs... And believe it or not this Place also serves amazing breakfast! Great breakfast burritos and salsa! I like the Max Ham Breakfast Burrito"}
{"text":"There are better lunch spots in the area. I had their roast beef sandwhich with chips and a drink for about $11. The sandwhich consisted of meat piled on fresh bread (the bread was actually really good), but still relatively mediocre. It's just too expensive to eat here, you could get the same lunch at any of the other sandwhich shops in the area for half as much."}
{"text":"Do not order delivery from here. Wait times are incredibly long then the driver just drops the food off without making sure you get the food or even calling you to let you know it is here. Waited an hour and a half for a delivery then found out the driver just left all the breakfast we ordered on a table without calling the number on file. Food was cold and disappointing"}
{"text":"The past three times I've come through to renaldi's deli I've ordered a chicken cesar salad with bacon, and it USED to be fantastic. 

Well, the salad has been pitiful at best compared to the last times i've been here. Either quality control, or staffing has gone down hill. 

I'm not expecting much going out for a salad for lunch, but at least hook it up with some protein, I paid $10 for the following: http://imgur.com/LWpnFyo 

So I paid $10 for some over-priced wilted lettuce, 2 strips of bacon, and 1/8th of a chicken breast. WTF Rinaldi's !? 

You used to be quality, now you just outright price gouge and not offer a satisfying meal. For shame.

Edit: It get's worse, how hard is it to make a cesar salad ? My dressing was ranch :\"}
{"text":"We ordered for the office and they dropped off at the front desk with no phone call. After to calling to find order the Manager says talk to you front desk we don't have time to call. We have over 500 employees and this is how he treats us. The Owner yelled at me. And said\" do what you have to do\" Tough New Yorker. Obviously he does not appreciate his customers. We are sending a company email to take out business elsewhere based on this experience. 15 other 1 star ratings on this  first page, based on the rude behavior, you can see this is a common theme, shame on the owner. Ego is expensive."}
{"text":"Lunch was good! Made the mistake of asking what was in the Italian combo sandwich though... The reply in a strong NY accent: \"Don't ask questions like that when you come to a NY deli\" I laughed and ordered the Sandwich. He never told me what was in it but I had a good idea...

This is a nice location and has both inside and patio seating. I decided to sit inside because the patio was pretty crowded. Good buzz in this place. It was fun listening to the guy at the counter greet people.

My sandwich was good and really liked the bread. I will definitely go back and probably try the meatball sandwich next. As I was leaving, I saw the guy making one and it looked pretty good. Rinaldi's definitely has some big balls!?!?!?!!? Wait, That didn't come out right...

Give this place a shot... I don't think you'll be disappointed."}
{"text":"Rinaldi's never lets me down!

I love their turkey sandwiches with honey-mustard...it's delish. That's all I've ever had and all I'll ever get! :)"}
{"text":"This is one of the best deli's around!  Great sandwiches with fresh bread.  And don't forget about the breakfast burritos!  You won't be disappointed.  They make the salsa fresh with just the right amount of heat.  The owner is a character."}
{"text":"Service was good and quick but the burritos and deli sandwiches a little too lean for me. The amount of meat missing in the sandwich was ridiculous.  Was disappointed with counter help as it seemed it was a bother to order food. As for the burritos, the same thickness of a quesadilla. Don't think I'll be going back."}
{"text":"I ordered a breakfast burrito egg, bacon ,potato no cheese and I received a tortilla, a piece of an egg and a piece of bacon!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! REALLY I would never ever go here again, the owners daughter was to interested on watching cartoons on tv then customer service!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

ARE YOU KIDDING ME, YOU SHOULD NOT BE IN BUSINESS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

YOUR A THEIF!!!!"}
{"text":"UPDATE: I was bed-ridden all night with a brutal stomach ache. 

I ordered a turkey breast sandwich and when it arrived, it was covered in mayo. I hate to be THAT guy who sends food back, but mayo makes me cringe and I just couldn't eat it. I called in primarily to let them know they don't mention mayo anywhere on the site or the menu, just as a note so they'd mention it and avoid this happening to another anti-mayo customer. The owner was very apologetic and offered to make me a new sandwich free of charge. Typically I wouldn't take a restaurant up on this, but I was super hungry and the sandwich looked so good. It was ready when I arrived, and the owner was once again apologetic. The customer service alone warrants five stars in my book, but the sandwich earned this review on its own merits. Real Boar's Head meat, crunchy bacon, on a big kaiser roll. A big, filling, tasty sandwich worth every dime. I'll definitely be back to Rinaldi's in the near future."}
{"text":"Excellent, excellent food! But the owner berates his employees for their mistakes loudly in front of the customers which makes an uncomfortable environment while eating your food, which should be a relaxed environment. The owner should take his employees to the back for that kind of conversation. I didn't enjoy my lunch due to the environment."}
{"text":"I ordered lunch there a few times and the roast beef sub was okay, nothing special but worth returning when I crave this sort of thing.

So, I arrived one evening at 5:45 p.m.  They close at 6:00 p.m.  I walked in and they were obviously cleaning up the entire place.  So, I kindly asked if they were closed and the two employees just looked at each other.  They did not speak to me or each other and looked like they did not know what to say so I just walked out.  

Will never return.  I got a horrible vibe like they couldn't give two craps about customer service."}
{"text":"The best food in scottsdale, the Taylor Pork Roll is to die for ! The owner takes the time to invest his energy into every guest! The burritos are the best! The sandwiches are the biggest and best you will ever eat!! Rinaldi's is  a beautiful thing!"}
{"text":"There's nothing like the Max Breakfast burritos. I get one at least 3 times a week. Soooo good with their home made salsa. A must have."}
{"text":"This place has now become one of my favorite lunch spots. Awesome sandwiches! The pastrami with everything is my usual!"}
{"text":"Having this place close to where I work was a bonus, or so I thought!  We've ordered for delivery, plenty of times.  Food is decent, typical deli type food.  But, being a former New Yorker, I don't expect to get an attitude when you screw up my meal that I have had delivered.  They messed up my order and I was very nice about it and asked if they would just give me an IOU for a replacement next time I ordered.  They agreed.  So I took them up on their offer today.  When I called in, to have it delivered, since I am super busy, when I explained the situation, the girl on the phone was very nice and had to ask if they can accommodate me.  The man in the back said \"I don't have time to deliver it! Tell her if she wants it to come and get it!\"  So, reluctantly, I did.  When I picked it up, it was sitting on the counter and the man, who I take it as the owner, pretty much threw it at me. I very nicely said \"Thank you so much\"  Well, he said NOTHING and when I walked out, I said \"Thank you again and I will have a GREAT day too!\"  It's unfortunate that this is the only place in the Kierland Area who delivers salad, but I'm pretty much over this place and the New York Attitude."}
{"text":"We love the max bacon burrito. We love the Italian combo. Johnny is awesome. Who cares if you get a little attitude here and there. Get thicker skin people this isn't Disneyland."}
{"text":"Service wasn't over the top, just right to stop in for a breakfast burrito without being accosted by an over-caffeinated employee! Loved it and the cannolis that were on display were more than enough to bring me back for lunch!


*****This is an old review from about five years ago that never got posted."}
{"text":"My boys and I love this place for breakfast. We get the bagel sandwich with egg cheese and bacon or the breakfast burrito! Be careful if you order potatoes, twenty minutes later and they were still piping hot!
We have ordered delivery too."}
{"text":"Best breakfast burritos in town!! Order ahead on Yelp for super easy pick up or delivery."}
{"text":"A great place to grab a good bite to eat. Friendly service and good food. Prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"I've been here a number of times just because it's convenient. Never have been impressed with anything (especially not the service), but I never had much of a reason to complain. Until today...
I decided to give their chef salad a whirl. After the uncomfortable transaction with the lady at the register that refuses eye contact or even the slightest acknowledgment of your existence as a customer, I waited anxiously for the salad I so inconsiderately requested. When the time came, I shoved my way to the front of the line like a MAGA hat wearer at a Trump rally and clutched my prized salad with complete caution as I made my way back to my tiny, cramped table. Upon initial inspection, I felt like I had been done right by the bountiful portions of deli meat the Rinaldi's gods had bestowed upon me. After three bites I realized the roast beef was still bleeding. Like, bleeding.... I haven't seen that much raw meat since the first time I saw a Peter North film (see pic for meat reference). I didn't bother to complain or ask for a refund. I figure I'd be better off never going back and flushing the $40-50 a month I spend down an actual toilet would be better for me.  Long story short, if you need a reason to take a day off work to nurse your b-hole and don't mind feeling like one when you patronize small business, this is the place. But if you appreciate good gut-health and basic customer service skills, avoid this place like Walmart after 10 pm..."}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE!!!! I work right across the street where they deliver with no charge or min. The breakfast Max Burrito is the best as well as the Santa Fe Chicken Salad! THE BEST!!!! And the delivery guy is very nice."}
{"text":"First off, they had a signed picture of Young MC, which really started this place off on the right foot. I stopped in for a quick breakfast. I had an omelette, which was well priced for the size and the amount of vegetables and meat they used. The bread was lackluster for a deli. But the breakfast potatoes were great. A good place for a reasonable and quick breakfast."}
{"text":"I'm reviewing for the breakfast burritos. The max burritos are on point, no matter which one you get. the salsa makes the burritos. its fantastic garlic spicy awesome. Best place for bfast burritos in the area, hands down.  the owners are a bit gruff but don't let that faze you."}
{"text":"I am from Alberta, Canada and every year we come to Scottsdale for Arizona Bike Week. I LOVE this place...they make the BEST breakfast chorizo burrito around! While I am here I have to eat here at least 3 times if not more to get my fix. John the owner is such a friendly and outgoing guy, he always has a smile on his face and eager to help when you walk through the door. I have not tried anything else at this point as I am too addicted to the Chorizo Burrito.

I recommend you try this hidden gem!!"}
{"text":"Today was my last visit. The customer service is consistently poor and in a day and age where the average consumer has a multitude of meal options in front of them, what really sets places apart is how they interact with patrons. When a manager/owner is rude, abrupt and downright disrespectful to customers, what is to be assumed except that they don't value their business. 

I do wish them luck as a mom & pop shop. I think we need more family run eateries in the Phoenix/Scottsdale area...but Rinaldi's? It'll be an uphill battle if they choose to continue to treat their clientele in this fashion. It's too bad."}
{"text":"LOVE this place and the people who work here! I am an executive assistant at a local company and Rinaldi's is my go-to for a healthy, tasty lunch and reliable service. LOVE that you use Boars Head meats. Sandwich trays so generous with meat and really yummy potato and macaroni salad. You are always a hit with us!"}
{"text":"What a hidden gem!! This place is amazing. Fantastic food and service. Been coming here for years. The owner is committed to his business being the best...breakfast burritos are fantastic along with the rest of the menu. A must for everyone looking for an excellent meal."}
{"text":"I come here wkly for breakfast. It's pretty busy so sometimes there's a wait but it's worth it. This place is awesome. Both service and food."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a warm friendly place to eat breakfast/lunch with your family, just \"fuhgeddaboudit\" as you are in the wrong place. 

If you are looking for the best breakfast burrito in town and great Italian Combo than you've found the right spot!"}
{"text":"I order from them often since they are close to work and one of the places that delivers. Their food is decent. Their prices are ok for their lunch items. However I find a little expensive for a breakfast burrito that is pretty small. My biggest complaint is their delivery though. They are VERY slow. They do not start delivering until 8:00AM, however even if you pre-order for delivery it takes them most times an hour to over an hour to deliver. I am kind of tied up in having to choose delivery, wish I wasn't. They need to work on that aspect."}
{"text":"The best Cobb Salad I've ever had! Our office staff orders at least 3x weekly from here. Wonderful service as well!"}
{"text":"Rinaldi's has THE BEST bacon, egg and cheese breakfast sandwich I've ever had!!  It's light, yet filling and so delicious!  They also have Boars deli meat, awesome Italian meatballs and cannolis are fresh and delicious.  Whether you're looking for a quick take out lunch or want to sit and eat, I highly recommend trying it if you haven't already."}
{"text":"It was ok. Not great and not bad. Over priced, no lemons for ice tea, no homemade pasta or potato salads. There are so many other great delis."}
{"text":"Rinaldies Italian Deli Scottsdale is by far my favorite sandwich and breakfast burrito place in North Scottsdale & Scottsdale Air park. I work right down the street and for the last five years the food has been great. This italian New York deli is our office favorite  as well."}
{"text":"Great sammichez!  We also grab a few rice balls when they are available with some extra sauce.  Boom."}
{"text":"I love Rinaldi's deli. I feel at home here! Great place and great food. I recommend the max burro with sausage. The sausage and peppers is great as well! Can't go wrong with this place!"}
{"text":"I love Rinaldi's deli. I feel at home here! Great place and great food. I recommend the max burro with sausage. The sausage and peppers is great as well! Can't go wrong with this place!"}
{"text":"Pretty consistently good.

Try a hot brisket wedge with tomato and lettuce - skip the cheese. It's available Mon, Wed, Fri."}
{"text":"I used to love Rinaldi's Chicken Caesar Salad - it used to be big, the lettuce crispy and a nice portion of chicken. NOW, the salad is tiny, the chicken portion is still there, but parts of the chicken are hard and dry like it was left out, there is very little lettuce and what is there is wilted. When I brought it up to the person working the register, they said that the OWNER wanted smaller salads because that's the \"way it is at the Scottsdale location.\" Mind you I paid $8.00 for this salad, and the owner is going to cheese out on .50 of lettuce?? Add more lettuce - it's the cheapest ingredient! If this is how the owner is running it, then I won't be back for salad or anything else."}
{"text":"I work at Larson Air Conditioning where we have a team meeting every week and we ALWAYS order Rinaldi's breakfast burritos for every meeting. They are the best! The bacon is perfectly crispy and the salsa is to die for...we are all addicted. If you haven't tried Rinaldi's burritos, you're missing out!"}
{"text":"Started this morning off with the Best breakfast burrito in town. Rinaldi's Max. I've been all over the world and this is hands down the best."}
{"text":"Went to Rinaldi's today on 19th avenue.  Wanted a large Brisket deli sandwich.  Asked if they have au jus.  Answer:  NO.  My answer:  NO and walked out.  We're from Chandler visiting the CVT cardiac facility down the street.  I suggest Renaldies check out Miracle Mile Deli on 16th Ave and Indian School. Also, Check out the Chicago Hamburger Co on 38th street and Indian School, both of  which serve beef deli sandwiches and both of which serve ah jus. Go back to Chicago, Rinaldi and try again."}
{"text":"I ordered a sandwich here and asked for half corned beef and half pastrami. I got my sandwich.They charged me for TWO sandwiches! I wouldn't have been angry but I only got only enough meat for one sandwich and not for what I was charged for, What a rip-off! When I looked at my sandwich and the bill, I brought it to their attention of the \"manager\" and they refused to even discuss it. I was told I got what I paid for and was asked to leave. So much for customer service and making things right. 

As far as the meat quality, it's about average for what you'll get in the southwest, definitely not to New York standards. I guess I'll have to keep flying to Manhattan to get my Katz's fix... If I'm going to spend New York prices, I want a New York sandwich!"}
{"text":"Wow, always good but today I had an off menu item. Thursday is Philly Sandwich day so combined the Philly mix (brisket, onions and peppers) in an egg burrito. It was very tasty. Thanks John."}
{"text":"This is always our breakfast stop when visiting North Scottsdale. One of the best Chorizo breakfast burritos I've ever had (great homemade salsa too)! Friendly owner and staff. 
Do yourself a favor and skip the overpriced trendy breakfast spots and get some good quality food that won't cost you an arm and a leg."}
{"text":"This place was one of the better lunch options in the promenade.  The bread tastes freshly baked and they are generous with the meat.  Mortadella was good.  Heard good things about the pastrami.  Lots of other things to try including cannoli.  A good value too."}
{"text":"Love this place!  The owner and employees are sooo nice and helpful!  The sandwiches are great!! Don't miss getting breakfast there, it is awesome!!"}
{"text":"I order the same thing from here every time! Bacon egg and cheese on a croissant and it is by far the best breakfast sandwich I have ever had every time I get it! I've also ordered sandwiches from here for a memorial party I threw a few months back and they were delicious as well. I definitely recommend them!"}
{"text":"Always stop here for sandwiches after visiting the pen shop. Great little deli. Sandwiches are delicious. Great service."}
{"text":"First time here and had a recommended Freshly made Beef Brisket sub and it was amazing. Very family oriented business and everyone seems to know everyone. I'll definitely be making for stops at this place and I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"If you've ever lived or spent a lot of time out east it feels like you've flown 2000 miles upon walking in the door (and that's a good thing).  I just moved to town and this place is a favorite among my co-workers who brought me on my first day.  It is now one of my favorites as well.  In my weekly lunch rotation for sure now and will be spot  Great quality deli meat (Boar's Head), fast service.  Get the spicy mustard!"}
{"text":"I stop here for lunch every time I'm working in this area. They have the best Italian meatball sandwich I've had since. I moved here from Chicago. Excellent. Also their iced tea is always freshly made. I appreciate that."}
{"text":"I love it when my wife wants to go shopping on a Saturday afternoon. I get to go to Rinaldi's for an Italian combo. Great menu and a great sandwich."}
{"text":"Great chicken sandwich and friendly employees!!!  I will be back.  The chicken parmigiana sandwich had a good amount of chicken and sauce!  Very yummy!"}
{"text":"I really want to like this place but it's average-at-best better than Subway or anyone like that but still I had the Buffalo chicken sandwich the bread was decent have pretty good flavor didn't really like the shredded iceberg lettuce tomatoes onions and the buffalo chicken something you get at Fry's or someplace like that for double the price I mean 10 inch sub and a bottle of water and a cookie is about 13 bucks little pricey didn't try anything else may their meatball sandwich interest in my dad's a lot better than what I had was mediocre I wouldn't go back and try something else cut the counter was very nice and they get their food there really quick which is good"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely the best!  Every time we visit Scottsdale, we stop here every morning for the breakfast burritos and the delicious homemade salsa. Then we get their sub sandwiches to go for lunch. John the owner treats you like family. Amazing food and service. This place won't disappoint!"}
{"text":"Rude service mediocre food and slow delivery times. The breakfast burritos are good and they keep me coming back to this place. They do offer free delivery which is a plus. Most of the time the food is cold by the time it gets to you. Every time I try to get away from this place, they pull me back in. At the end of the day, the food is well priced, the delivery is free, and the burritos are still worth the wait. Why mess up a good thing? And that's that"}
{"text":"Great Chicken Parmesan sandwich. The lady was real friendly even though it was busy!"}
{"text":"Never again. Ordered the Greek salad and had to toss the entire thing in the trash. The didn't use Greek olives, they used black ones. HUGE difference and big mistake. It wasn't a couple either, it was like they dumped an entire can of chopped up black olives on the salad. The dressing wasn't even Greek dressing, it was a dark balsamic that had the consistency of jello. I almost vomited. This was my first time coming here and it's my last. Don't waste your money like I did."}
{"text":"Went to Rinaldi's for lunch mid-week with a few co-workers. The turkey ham and cheese was nothing special other than the fact that they use Boar's Head meats which is a bonus to any sandwich. After purchasing a drink and getting a generic bag of chips, the total came out to $10. I will definitely be making a trip back for one of the pastrami sandwiches that I should have chosen in the first place.

Overall: A good find if your looking for something other than Subway, Jimmy John's, or Port-O-Subs..."}
{"text":"This is not an Italian deli. I'm not sure why they've chosen to call it that. It's a regular sandwich shop with bland ingredients. The drive to DeFalco's or Guido's would be more worth your time."}
{"text":"Gross, don't eat here. This place has horrible food and it's dirty. Went in for a pastrami sandwich and was charged $10.05 for overly fatty meat full of gristle on a sub roll with spicy mustard and about a head of lettuce and half a tomato, a small bag of chips (snack size, not normal) and a small beverage...what the actual hell??? I couldn't even finish the food it was so gross. I will not be back anytime soon...

Who puts spicy mustard on a pastrami sandwich???"}
{"text":"I just stopped by for a quick breakfast sandwich.  It was pretty good. I got the ham and croissant.  I will defiantly give a shot again when I am up in the area."}
{"text":"Best breakfast burritos I've found.  The salsa is soooo good they jar and sell it (I buy it every time to bring home).  The word is getting out though (darn it!) Last visit they were out but John still sold us some in a carry container. 

John the owner has a presence here.  You just get the vibe he cares about his customers, his business and the details.  It shows!"}
{"text":"2.7/5 Average deli. Better than Subway for sure but nothing out of the ordinary, could have got the same ingrediants from the deli at Albertsons and made my own."}
{"text":"Delicious premium sandwiches. Meatball extra cheese and the Italian combo are the best! 

Don't forget to try the canoli as well!"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place! Best sandwiches and meatballs EVER! Always super clean and very nice service!"}
{"text":"Great little place to grab breakfast or a sandwich. It has a nice NYC feel with the owner greeting you like family. I've been here a few times and have left happy and full. Yep, you will pay a bit more for boars head meats but, overall it is deli prices. Good place for food and conversation..."}
{"text":"I order a pastrami sandwich on white bread. It was very skimpy on meat and what meat there was, was not very good. Every bite was gristle. I won't be back."}
{"text":"The service and quality of the food is very good. What I do not like is they play the TV at max volume. Today there was a 25 year old football game on the TV blasting as loud as it can go. You cannot even here the person you are with talking. Turn down the TV, better yet turn it off."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant.  Eat here two or three days a week. Breakfast is fresh, fast, and better than any other Scottsdale breakfast restaurant...purely delicious. Customer service is friendly and each visit is personable.

I recommend trying out this fantabulous deli!!"}
{"text":"Yummy sandwiches, good salads, quick service. Awesome croissant breakfast sandwiches! Love this place!"}
{"text":"Whenever I'm in town from Chicago I make it a point to swing by and get a sausage breakfast burrito with salsa. Great service. Great product. An Arizona staple!"}
{"text":"When I think of Scottsdale, the first things that come to mind are horses, golf, and rich folks.  The last thing that comes to mind is \"authentic Italian deli.\" But Scottsdale happens to have a couple of pleasant surprises in store for visitors to the area, and Rinaldi's is one of them.

This is AUTHENTIC, and it stands strong with the best Italian delis (including Bay Cities in Santa Monica) in terms of food quality. I loved the homey, local vibe (seemed like there were lots of regulars in there during the lunch hour). You can also tell that this is a true family-run business; the owner was a really nice Italian-American guy who made me feel right at home as a first-time diner from out of town. So the upshot is that you win twice by choosing RInaldi's: you support an amazing local business, and you leave with a full belly of authentically delicious Italian food.

My partner in crime and I split the baked ziti plate and Italian sandwich. Both were phenomenal and true to form for an authentic Italian deli. I will certainly be back during my next visit to the desert."}
{"text":"Has great food but they need to change ordering system instead of just yelling out the order, just write the order down for the sandwich maker. My order is messed up over half of the time."}
{"text":"Well as a former NYer, I can say that the way you get treated there is right on...New York style.  I had the chicken salad...it was okay.  The bread is very bad.  I would try the breakfast before I go back for lunch again.  One great thing is, they have Wise chips, a staple to any NY lunch."}
{"text":"I went to get a breakfast burrito for the first time as I've heard the restaurant had great sandwiches.  While I was pleased with my breakfast meal - the experience left a horrible taste in my mouth!

When a co-worker went to pay for her milk, advertised as $1.75, according to the sign in the cooler, the cashier informed us it would be $2.25.  We disagreed and showed her that the cost was less - albeit not by much - she was wrong or the sign was wrong.  Instead of apologizing for the pricing error, the owner shouted that $2.25 was the price that we must pay.  When we returned the milk back to the cooler, he stomped over to the cooler and proceeded to rip off the $1.75 price tag.  And again, snarled while saying, \"I don't give a BLEEP what the price tag says, they can go somewhere else\"  His reaction and behavior were not just rude, but also unprofessional and childish.

I will never give them my business and recommend you do the same."}
{"text":"This was one bad sandwich and not really an Italian Deli at all. They have a motto saying that they have \"the biggest and best sandwiches\", but what you get is exactly the opposite. The menu listed nothing Italian like Ziti, etc - it is just  a sandwich shop and not a good one at that. First problem on this Saturday was the cashier girl, who was new and did not know the answers to any questions we asked about the food. Who trained this individual? The next issue was the sandwich itself, but these 8 buck Wedge sandwiches are small, constructed poorly and somehow, the condiments of mayo, lettuce and tomato caused me alot of gas only 45 minutes later. This deli is a joke, not worth the money or the hype. The meat is Boars Head, but beyond that, some chains have better sandwiches than this place."}
{"text":"The Mexicana Burrito (chorizo) is one of the best breakfast burritos I've ever had. The salsa that comes with it is A+ as well. Will continue to go here for breakfast in the future."}
{"text":"It was love at first bite! The staff are very friendly and the food is GREAT. Whether its breakfast or lunch you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Ordered a max burrito with sausage.  I was given a ham burrito.  The burrito was tiny!  It cost about 6 bucks or so with a tip.  The burro had egg, ham, potato, and cheese.  It was very small and not very good.  The salsa was okay but overpowered with garlic.  

This will teach me to order a burro at an Italian deli!

Wont be back and dont recommend."}
{"text":"This deli is right next to Honeywell on 19th Ave & Deer Valley so it really gets busy at lunch! However, I have never had a bad meal here! And the Cobb salads are AWESOME! the only thing I would warn you about is during the week after the lunch rush they do run out of some items. I look at it as the food is definately fresh every day!"}
{"text":"Max Burrioto is a must have at Rinaldi's.  Max satisfaction guaranteed!!! The homemade salsa is amazing!! This place is tucked away in the FLW Plaza.  Had I not devoured my burrito this morning I would posted a yummy picture... There's always next time"}
{"text":"I had the house omelette , with substitute of ham for chicken . This costs me an extra $2.50. The omelette was served in a decent size portion. The English muffin was phenomenal! I said I was having it \"for here\" but they served it to me in a To go container, not sure if this was a norm. 

While eating in the restaurant, the tv channel was on a diet pill infomercial, then a testosterone replacement talk show."}
{"text":"Overpaid dramatically for the terrible sandwich I received. Really bad sandwiches in this dump. I hate giving money to people who don't deserve it. Not good for the money. Not my thing. No sir I would not like another."}
{"text":"Ok... that's all. We got the Italian combo. Take note deli's the bread is the most important part! Mine was semi stale. And the way they served it to us open faced, meat just laying on top minimal toppings it was difficult to close. Basic boars head meat. So no complaints there. But average at best. Jersey Mikes does a better Italian then this so called NY deli. Ate it, But wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"1. Rinaldi's has the best breakfast burritos in town, bar none. If you like potatoes, get the \"Max Burrito,\" as in \"Bacon Max,\" \"Sausage Max,\" or \"Chorizo Max.\" Literally life-changing.
2. If you get the burrito, dip it in the garlic salsa. You may need a breath mint afterwards, but sooooo worth it.
3. If you're in the mood for sandwiches, Rinaldi's uses nitrate-free Boar's Head meats, and the freshest rolls. Cannot be beat.
4. They also make a huge variety of delicious hot italian food, which I have personally brought home for dinner several times (including one very auspicious Christmas).
5. This is one of the last true home-town, locally-owned, non-chain businesses. They've always gone the extra mile, and they deserve our support! :)"}
{"text":"My whole family visits here often, we bring everyone and it is HANDS DOWN the best place to eat in the area!! I have had many items off their breakfast (BURRITOS!) and lunch menu. John is one of the nicest guys and he runs the joint. If you are ever near the deli, stop in and ask for the chicken parm sandwich - you will NOT be disappointed!! 

Cheers, Sara C."}
{"text":"Would give zero stars if I could! DO NOT ORDER DELIVERY from here! Ordered at 10:30 am for 11:35 am delivery. At 12:05 still not here! Very frustrating and staff were extremely unhelpful and rude, when I asked them to call and check on my order I was hung up on! Will never, ever order or eat here again and will tell all friends who live nearby to avoid the place. Just ridiculous, terrible customer service."}
{"text":"If you want an authentic NY-style deli in the desert, look no further. Everything about this family-run business is wonderful. The food (especially the breakfast burritos with homemade salsa) is incredible. The atmosphere is friendly and inviting. Mr. and Mrs. Rinaldi (who personally run the deli) are magnificent. This reminds me of everything I love about the great corner delis in New York. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"If you are hoping for breakfast delivery you might as well wait for lunch to come around. I have ordered numerous times and every single time they are 20-30 minutes later than their \"confirmed delivery time\"

Not terrible food but could probably find the same thing at the closest frys bakery."}
{"text":"Eh is was good but really expensive for the portion. My husband and ordered a large to split and paid $12 for the sandwich and two canned sodas. The sandwich was on a French roll that was maybe 8\" long... It was a meatball sandwich with 3 meatballs and some sauce. I would have expected a little more for a $10 sandwich."}
{"text":"I come here for breakfast whenever I'm close!! Best breakfast burritos in town by far. Owners are extremely friendly, food is amazing, and I definitely recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"Typical New York style AZ deli. Walk in and the walls are packed with NY memorabilia. I normally go on a brisket day (Wednesday). Their normal sandwiches are good, but the only thing that makes them special is the fact that they use Boar's Head meat and cheese. The bread isn't made fresh and the price is a little high for what you get in my opinion...$8ish for an 8\" sub (or thereabouts), cheap bag of plain chips, and a pickle wedge."}
{"text":"Great stop reminds me a NY Deli. Less of the Scottsdale -fluff more of a NYer deli easy to get a sandwich or a meal quick. Priced like a NYC Deli as well. Traditional Italian family from Tri-state has owned it for years. 
One of my favorite lunch places! 
On weekends and some weekdays they serve a delicious brisket!"}
{"text":"Three times ate there with my family three times went home vomiting!! Over priced!! Rude customer service .. Wow get real rinaldi deli!!"}
{"text":"BEST CHORIZO BURRITO - This side a town!!!
I only wish they'd come out with s Max XXL Chorizo burrito for the hearty appetite!"}
{"text":"First time here and last time here. When we first got there, no one was in sight. I think we waited about 4 minutes until we even saw anyone. Girl was in the bathroom the whole time. Then she said hi, took our order and was kinda blah and customer service. We decided to try the sandwich, looked like they had a lot of deli meat options, well not good at all. Not to mention is was $7.99 and tasted like you just thru some meat, cheese, slapped some mayo on dry bread in your own kitchen! For as Italian as this place looks, it was not good at all!  This location and place has so much potential but my lunch was horrible and I was super bummed. This place needs to pump up their customer service and make their sandwiches a lot more 'Italian' and unique! I felt like I ate a cafeteria pre-made sand which today."}
{"text":"Best Roast Beef around! Melts in your mouth! My new favorite lunch time place---- 

Hey you-- Deli Man, don't you EVER threaten to take my Rinaldi's Roast Beef away- I know where you work, bub."}
{"text":"This is the best place I've been too thus far in Arizona!. Being a Gal from Detroit and my boyfriend from Alabama, we're used to great food and this place makes us feel right at home. We order lunch from here for my entire staff often and even our friends from NY say how much they love this place. #1 the customer service is impeccable which is has been pretty hard to find in Arizona. The owners are such a beautiful and welcoming couple! We're always greeted and treated like family here. It really does feel like love from home. Now lets talk about the food.... I really don't know where to start. The entire menu is superb and inexpensive. The corned beef, pastas, and salads are my go to. Its soo delicious. You definitely want to make time to drop by and grab a delicious meal (they even have desserts) I'd give this place 10 stars if I could."}
{"text":"My favorite deli in Arizona.  Good deli meat and bread.  Even better meatballs and specialty sandwiches.  Love coming here even though the owner is a die hard New Yorker.  I am from Boston...."}
{"text":"Normally really good but it seems like since I have been referring people the service has gotten not good.  The delivery driver Cory is great but my manicotti the other day was swimming in water.  My sandwiches have had alot less meat.  The guy that answers the phone ask you over and over again to repeat what you said.  They usually have really good boars head meat but the other day it was dried up and looked like I got old stuff.  And not very much meat.  Service just hasn't been that great lately."}
{"text":"I've been to Rinaldi's several times now. To me, it's one of those places that after the first bite, I get annoyed at myself for not remembering how disappointing it was the last time and wonder why I'm back.

Let's cut to the chase. This place in essence is really no different than the deli counter at the low end food store down the street from wherever it is you live - and let's be honest, places like Safeway make a point of a good deli counter and put this place to shame - all at a lower cost.

Don't be fooled by the quintessential \"New York\" decor on the walls such as a photo of downtown NYC and a poster of Italian movie mobsters. I lived in New York and this is not a real NY deli. This place wouldn't make it through opening weekend.

2 slices of deli meat on a thin bed of shredded lettuce, and a layer of mayo on a crumbly hoagie roll does not transport me back to Mulberry St. 

The two stars are awarded to their breakfast burritos. It's pretty hard to mess up eggs."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I get breakfast here every weekend and it never disappoints. By far the best breakfast croissant I've ever had...and great service too!"}
{"text":"To the owner Johnny, 

You know, I order from here often multiple times a week, as do at least 10-15 other of my co-workers. I love their food, however the customer service has gotten so horrible, I'm considering no longer ordering from here. I always order 1 of 2 things ususally. However, 75% of the time they forget the dressing for my salad, to the point that now the very nice driver checks first knowing where it is being delivered. Then today, I order a salald, no onions, add olives, like I do 1 a week. My salad came with onions piled on it, and no olives. I call a couple hours later when I realize it, while on my lunch, since we placed a group order earlier today. While the lady who answered the phone offered to send me a new salad (I can't eat onions, nor do I want a salad that's going to taste completely like onions now), and gets my info. 15 minutes later I get a call from who I can only assume to be the chef to complain about why I'm ordereing a new salad when all that was missing was olives. He was extremely disrespectful, and insinuated I was lying due to the time lapse (I have the salad still sitting right here waiting for them to come). After explaining multiple times that I ordered a salad with no onions and got onion, he finally reluctantly agreed to make me a new salad which should be here in another 30 minutes or so. 

I am just horrified at this customer service. Considering that my office places proably at least 20-30 orders a week alone, and have been customers there since July on a consistant level, they really need to step it up a notch!!!!!!! Or at least, back up to the notch it was at before."}
{"text":"Awesome family business! The food is great, the service is great, by far the best deli in Scottsdale area! Mr. and Mrs Rinaldi are the best! Go check this place out!"}
{"text":"Great for breakfast and lunch, I order and the food was delivered in about 20min. My sandwich was piled high with delicious maple turkey on a fresh Kaiser roll. I think the price is fair for what you are receiving."}
{"text":"Absolutely love the breakfast burritos and egg white omelets here! And the service is always fast and friendly! Rinaldi's is also wonderful for catering company events and picnics!"}
{"text":"If you love breakfast burritos... Look no further. Fun, family atmosphere. The Rinaldi's are one of a kind. You will be hooked."}
{"text":"This is my favorite breakfast sandwich in Scottsdale. This is a real Italian deli that uses only the finest meats and cheeses.  Favorite lunch special is hands down the beef brisket. Make sure to ask for a side of au jous for some extra flavor.  Their classic Italian dishes like arancini and lasagna are among the best in the valley. There's so much more here that I need to try!"}
{"text":"It's a deli, maybe slightly better in quality than a Subway, and the whole interior is decorated like a 9/11 memorial. It feels kind of creepy. Let's take a brand spanking new delicatessen and make it a memorial for a tragic event that happened some 6 or 7 years ago. I could not think of a better setting for people to enjoy a sandwich. Huh?"}
{"text":"Came here when I was waiting for the Rack to open. Loved the NY decor because I am from Long Island. Delicious breakfast burrito and the owner was so nice!"}
{"text":"I HAVENT EVEN BEEN HERE YET AND ILL GIVE IT 5 STARS!!!

To find out that there is an Italian deli that carries breakfast sandwiches is AMAZING, here in AZ.
I grew up in NJ where every bagel shop, Italian deli, breakfast spot, serves and sells porkroll.
Porkroll is nonexistent in the US besides the tri state area.

This deli, selling PEC's, deserves the highest rating!!


Can't wait to come here TODAY!"}
{"text":"Let's start with the fact that they advertise soup and don't have any. From there we go to their meats. Boar's head is good but not the best. We had the italian combo and the pastrami total bill was $19.00 not worth it. I didn't know Lay's made a bag of potato chips so small. I think mine had 5 maybe 6 chips in it. Older person came out to clean tables (with soiled towel) after we moved twice for a fairly clean table. Will not be back. Prices and counter help don't warrant a second visit. Back to Miracle Mile."}
{"text":"The breakfast burritos are FANTABULOUS! I have been coming here every Friday for a max bacon for several years now!  The Owners are just the sweetest people and really care about their customers!  You've GOT to try this place!"}
{"text":"I've given this place two chances because I work nearby and want to support a locally owned deli instead of a chain, but I've had two poor customer service experiences here. Both times, they were slow and messed up my order. That happens, I understand. My problem with this place is that the employees were rude and argued with me about it. This time, the guy raised his voice at me and repeatedly insisted that I ordered something I would not have (I'm a vegetarian and it had meat on it). They never apologized either time. Mistakes happen, but you have to say sorry and try to make it up to the customer."}
{"text":"Rinaldi's is a great NYC style deli I wish we had back in NM.  They serve up awesome subs with Boarshead meats. I also really enjoyed there pasta salad. Prices are also pretty cheap. This place is well worth checking out. By the way be sure you know what you want to eat before stepping up to the counter. The workers have an attitude for people who are not ready to order."}
{"text":"The most amazing breakfast burrito ever! Staff is wonderful, food is consistently amazing, I highly recommend trying this place. My favorite deli by far. :)"}
{"text":"I walk in, the owners wife asks me if I'm ready to order. Yes, I reply.. She proceeds to unwrap whatever she's stocking, napkins I believe, and takes her time doing so. Ok, I'll wait. Literally 2 mintues. I've been to this establishment before as I work in the area and it's the only place open for food as early as I get it. I order my sandwich, the same one going on 4x now. Literally EVERY! SINGLE! TIME! 
A. They're super rude and 
B. Forget my bacon half the time. BUT today takes the cake. Anyway. 
She tells me the price. \"Um I always pay x, why is it y?\"
They charged me almost $3 more for the same sandwich, I called her out on it, and again, the rudest people to be in customer service, let alone own an establishment in this nice of an area. I will NEVER EVER COME BACK TO THIS SHOP- such a horrible damper on such a great day."}
{"text":"Finally found my lunch spot!

I recently started a new job in the area, and after spending some time trying out the local lunch spots, I have found my home.

I've only been here twice, but I was sold the first day. Their Chicken Parmesan Sandwich is probably one of the best in the business. They use almost like pulled jerk chicken rather than the whole breast, that has been marinated in a marinara sauce, tender and delicious. The price is decent, usually under $10 for a meal and drink.

My only complaint is the breads could be hotter and better quality, otherwise a great spot for lunch!"}
{"text":"Hubby and I have tried this place several times. We don't go often, but each time we have, we pray it will be a better experience... it never has been. This is such a shame because north Phoenix NEEDS a good deli - desperately needs a good deli!!!

They advertise soups, yet never have any when we go. Rice Balls are on the menu, but even the cashier said they have never had them!! How about that for current menu items!!??? Geez!!

I got the Italian Combo sub... it is just so-do. Maybe the fact they put the dressing on top of the meat and cheese and NOT on the lettuce, onion, and tomato. Really?? Seems that would be the logical placement.

Hubby got the Egg Salad Sandwich. This is his description: I like an egg salad that is made of all eggs, and tastes like eggs. There was some filler in this that had no flavor. 

He also got the Chicken Parmigiana dinner. Well, the breading had fallen off the chicken strips, sitting on the bottom. The colors of the sauce was brown, not red tomato, as I would expect. I did taste it after his urging, wish I had not. I don't know the flavor but it was not tomato sauce based.

I think we are done \"trying\" this place. I feel bad giving this honest review, but I have tried, I really have, to like this place."}
{"text":"This is my favorite sandwich shop, literally, BEST SUBS EVER!!!!

Today, not so much..... walked in at 5:10, place closes at 6:00. I was just told I cannot have a hot sub because they put everything away..

Normally 5+ stars, today a 2"}
{"text":"This is honestly the first online review I have ever done and the first time I have ordered from rinaldis. I ordered a breakfast burrito @ 9:15 a.m. and asked for salsa on the side. Estimated time for delivery was 30-60 minutes. After 80 minutes i called and they said they just received the order.  Girl on the phone was very rude. After 2 HOURS i received my breakfast burrito( they forgot the salsa). It was cold and  hard...imagine the great depression wrapped in a tortilla. I ordered through Eat24. They said (via online chat) that since i accepted the order they cannot give me a refund. The did offer me a coupon...Coupon Code: tmnt. I am never going to order there again."}
{"text":"What a little gem! The food was great but the company was what really made the experience memorable! The place is also littered with really cool NY memorabilia and the loitering New Yorkers really made it all very authentic-- I'll be back for sure! :)"}
{"text":"This is morning breakfast place of choice! I usually get the Mexicana Burrito, but I've started switching it up and EVERYTHING is great! I order from here daily! John the owner is THE BEST! They now deliver to my office and half of my department has jumped on the Rinaldi's bandwagon."}
{"text":"Walked in great service fantastic sandwich!  You've gotta try this place if you're are anywhere nearby. It's worth the drive!!!!!  This isn't like any other gas food place!!!!"}
{"text":"Best sub shop in the area.  Ingredients are fresh and it never disapoints.  WAY better than Subway or Port of Subs.  I recommend the buffalo chicken

Reading through some of the other posts I want to add that I have never had any of the staff be rude to me in the 10+ times I have been here."}
{"text":"Rude customer service.  Not only did I find a hair in my breakfast  burrito.

There was no one in there and I ordered a breakfast burrito.  15 minutes goes by still nothing.  I ask the owner when will it be ready and he looks at my shirt and says I don't know how long does a mortgage take? 

I'm like seriously?! It's a burrito, no one is here? Won't ever be back.

I'm good with sarcasm but the tone was just rude.


****just to be clear, I have co workers who were with me who can attest to this.  I can't respond to your comment below, but I wasn't treated well***"}
{"text":"Nice to have a deli that uses quality deli meats in North Phoenix. They serve quite a variety of Boar's Head meats which, in my opinion, is one of the best deli meats there is. I had turkey and ham on rye with jalapeños, tomatoes, lettuce, s&p and vinegar...yummy! I would give this place 5 stars myself, but my husband ordered the meatball sub which was a bit skimpy on the \"meatballs\" and he said was \"just ok\". 
But they have CANNOLIS! We of course had to split one. :)
The owner, or maybe he was the manager, was very friendly, which also made it a pleasant experience.
They have daily specials which rotate, so we definitely want to come back on a Thursday and try the Philly Cheese Steak!"}
{"text":"Such a great North Scottsdale gem.

Everything is delicious but especially breakfast. The breakfast burritos here -- uhh max burrito with bacon = eggs, potatoes, bacon is such a great hangover food. The croissant with ham or sausage and egg is greasy but oh so good. (It's really greasy, it soaks through the paper bag).

Love this place and the owner. If you're not from the East Coast, don't be offended when he's short. It comes off rude to us in the Southwest and West Coast but it's just his NY swagga."}
{"text":"Definitely one of the best places in the PHX/Scottsdale area for a sandwich. It's the closest you will find to a NY Style deli. That being said, the only thing keeping it from 5 stars is that the ordering can be a little clunky as, the best way to I can think to describe it is, it seems not everybody there knows exactly what a NY Deli is supposed to be and I feel I almost need to guide them sometimes on how I want my sandwich made which occasionally leads to some small mistakes. However, even those small mistakes are canceled out by quality ingredients and nice portion sizes. This is a place I visit at least once every few weeks. I recommend the hot pastrami."}
{"text":"Nothing special but located in Promenade so it's convenient.  They advertise Boar's Head deli meat & yes it's deli meat. I think of a NY style deli cooking corned beef & pastrami and either taking a large knife to it or slicing it in front of you.

Our pastrami sandwiches were kind of light for about $9.  While the pastrami tasted good there should enough to cover all of the bread. I wouldn't go out of the way to go here. The service is ok but again not anything special."}
{"text":"I can't believe I haven't reviewed this place yet! I eat breakfast here 2-3 times a month, sometimes more. They have the best breakfast burrito in town, hands down - The max burro. I usually get bacon in mine - their bacon is so delicious and crispy. It's served with a custom made salsa that is out of this world! I've tried other breakfast items, all quite tasty, but I tend to always go back to the max burro with bacon! I've also had a sub or two for lunch and have never been let down. You'll love the feel of this New York style deli."}
{"text":"Let me preface this by saying the sandwiches are very tasty. Today I had a very poor experience. I have been coming for many years and I have always ordered a half turkey and half ham. Never a problem. Today, the young girl at the register advised me this is not possible and I would have to pay for extra meat. This is unacceptable for a business. She was snotty about it and I told her for years I've gotten the same thing. She told me they shouldn't do that.  She advised me she had been working there for 3 years and never have done that. That's a bold face lie.

I'm extremely disappointed today and I'll have to reconsider my choice for sandwiches from now on."}
{"text":"My favorite deli in Scottsdale! Great family run restaurant! True Italian sandwiches.  A must try!"}
{"text":"I will definitely go back. My husband loved the pastrami, I liked the meatball sandwich, the meatballs are good, it could use a bit more sauce. 
friendly and quick."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch and spent $9.30 for a regular soda and a hot chicken parmasean sandwich. The meal was served with a small bag of chips. I was underwhelmed by the presentation and taste of the sandwich. I'm used to the bread being toasted. So the only part of the sandwich that was heated was the chicken and sauce. I left this place hungry and disappointed by the taste of the sandwich as well. Maybe this place should just stick to the deli side of the business."}
{"text":"This is a clean place with a few TV's around. You order your food and they call your number when it's ready. They have a pretty diverse menu, so there's probably something for everyone.

I had a late lunch and ordered one of the specials, Chicken Parmesan sandwich. It was okay, but nothing to write home about. I've been in there for breakfast as well. The breakfast sandwiches are good but can be a little pricey."}
{"text":"I've been going to Rinaldi's for years. My dad used to talk about their sauce, brisket, meatballs, and breakfast items when he lived on this side of town.

When I moved to Scottsdale I gave it a shot. I'm in almost every weekend now and cannot stay away. I am a big fan of their breakfast croissants but I also love their breakfast burritos with the homemade salsa.

I always bring my friends to Rinaldi's when they are in town. It's not unusual for them to tell me later that they miss those breakfast sandwiches after they return home."}
{"text":"The quality of ingredients makes the difference here. Love their bacon egg and cheese croissant. I love that they sell Martinelli's Apple juice, which is one of the best unless you are making your own fresh Apple juice. I took off one star because they don't consistently open on time. They are supposed to open at 7am and one day at 7:15 it still was not open. This was not a fluke. Happened several times. I stopped going for a while because of this. However the sandwiches are so good that I have returned, just not as frequently. My review is based on breakfast. Never been for lunch."}
{"text":"Love Rinaldi's! Great sandwiches and their Bacon Maxx Burrito's are killer and a great hangover cure. Let me tell you! Saved me many times. And John, the owner, amazing man! He treats everyone like family."}
{"text":"i love this place so much!! i come here with my friends every weekend and their breakfast burritos are our favorite!! it is now a tradition for us! They are always so nice when we come in and make great conversation. Can't forget about their salsa, it is the best!!"}
{"text":"Yes!!! True Italian Deli at its finest! The food is absolutely delicious, exactly what you would expect from a great Deli! Yum!!!"}
{"text":"I went in this morning and had a breakfast burrito. It was the best breakfast burrito I ever had. I have been ordering breakfast burritos from New York to Los Angeles for 35 years.

The staff was very friendly and accommodating. I am glad that I live so close."}
{"text":"I had not been here in more than 2 years. I am glad to see that the food here is still good. My Italian sub was made very quickly and was quite tasty.

a little over 3 years ago I met the owner and he talked with us about his business and how it was tough making a profit with the price of gas being so high. We had a good talk and he gave us free cannolis.

I'm glad to see he did not skimp on the quality of his ingredients. I hope business is improving with the price of gas going down."}
{"text":"This place is for people whose palate has yet to evolve beyond Spaghetti-Ohs.
Deli products are overpriced.
And the sandwiches are as disappointing as my effort in the bedroom. 
Not really.

Yeah...really.
[sigh]"}
{"text":"This place is a decent Italian Deli. I had the typical Italian meat sub. It wasn't anything special.The place is clean and the staff is friendly. The service is quick."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why they call themselves an Italian Deli. They don't offer many options that regular Italian delis offer, they're just a regular sandwich shop. I went in and ordered the salami sandwich with everything, and it was so bland that I threw half of it away. Definitely won't be back- it's worth it to make the drive to DeFalco's or Guido's or somewhere else. Also it's pretty weird that the sandwiches are served on basic hamburger buns- definitely not a fan."}
{"text":"A couple of things to know about this place.

One, never show up wearing Red Sox gear.  Two, get the breakfast burrito.  They are among the best you'll have."}
{"text":"Great go-to place for lunch.  The menu items are done well - mostly sandwiches and salads.  Owner is very friendly and takes an active role in the business. It seems like he runs the place well."}
{"text":"Max Mexicana burrito is the best in town for a chorizo! The salsa is really good too!! They also catered a lunch for me with amazing sandwiches and salads!"}
{"text":"Called order in ahead of time. Shorted order a sandwich had to wait. It was slapped together as I waited. ordered Canoli's, they were over cooked, the guy said no they were fresh this morning, but the crust was hard, crunchy and over cooked. I opted not to purchase the canolis.
I paid with cash and remainder pain by debit card. The girl ran the debit card twice, zapping my card for the entire purchase. My bank account is out of state. Gee thanks assholes. 
Looking at receipt I was stolen from in lue of being over charged. I called them , they offered a refund. Come on back I'll give your money back. Seriously ?  What a joke. spend my time and money again dealing with their screw up.
So they agreed to return funds back to the card. Oh yeah 3 to 5 business days. 
I wont be offering my money back here ever again."}
{"text":"This is a perfect sandwich with a little ny attitude.  It doesnt  get better for an east coaster. Only if Boston losses the world series.  Boreshead meat. This is how a sandwich is supposed to be"}
{"text":"I was stoked to hear about a new deli/sandwich shop in the area, so we popped in on the weekend for lunch. 

I ordered up a small egg-salad sandwich and Tera went with a small turkey sandwich. The deli proudly proclaims Boar's head meats with signage plastered all over.

Neither of us were particularly impressed. Tera's whole wheat roll was a bit firm, but my white roll was just fine. I enjoyed my sandwich, but it just didn't seem like that great of a value: $5.79 for my lil sandy, $5.79 for Tera's sandy, a bottle of Arizona iced tea, a small side of pasta salad and our total was about $20.

I dig that each sammich comes with a small bag of Wise potato chips (hailing from PA, where I grew up). 

I'll probably go back to try their veggie sandwich at some point, but I'm in no hurry. For many of the folks who work up in this area, I'm sure Rinaldi's is a welcome addition to the dining options in this locale."}
{"text":"In search of the perfect deli? Here it is!! I always get the maple honey turkey full sub with the works: lettuce, tomato, mayo and onion. It's $8 for that, some chips and a pickle. They slice the meat right in front of you it's so fresh! I love it. If you have any room left, go for the cannoli."}
{"text":"I had the house omelette. They have really big portions. Customer service wasn't super friendly, but food came out in about 8 minutes. Omelette came with salsa that tasted really good with it."}
{"text":"I got the small Italian sub and it is packed with thick cut meats and provolone. Comes with red onion lettuce and tomato and Italian dressing and a pickle and small bag of chips. I like when the meat is plentiful. Plus high quality. I didn't like the bread much. Bland and dry and no flavor."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a sandwich and they serve boars head meats. Got a club sandwich with some chips. It was cut fresh and made quickly. Was a good sandwich but price was high. I would go back but based on price it will not be that often."}
{"text":"Such a great deli!! There so much to choose from which makes it hard because I want everything lol but I highly recommend the brisket sandwich... it melts in your mouth and leaves you completely satisfied  Also recommend there breakfast burritos for a quick on the go taste completely homemade!"}
{"text":"The brisket sandwich is the best thing possible, there's sooo many good items to choose from but I always come back for that sandwich!!"}
{"text":"Love it.

I've always complained that you can't get a good deli sandwich in Phoenix then I found Rinaldis.  Great food, classy atmosphere, and old school attitude make this one of my favorite stops."}
{"text":"One of my favorite delis here in the valley. I would call it a hidden gem here in the valley. Great breakfast sandwiches and great customer service."}
{"text":"Have to agree with most of the reviews. Poor sandwich overall. It's sad because boars head deli meats are very good. The sandwich was built so poorly you couldn't really eat it. It doesn't come with mayo or mustard so you have dismantle the entire sandwich to spread condiments. Too much bread....too much lettuce. They will never shut down cause the Honeywell office located next door provides consistent customers who probably don't complain cause it's too easy to walk to and it's convenient. I won't be back."}
{"text":"I had baked ziti, meatballs, salad and a roll.  

The ziti noodles were mushy, the top was crispy due to being exposed all day (it's 1pm right now) the flavor was ok.

The meatballs were good.  A tad greasy but good. 

The salad was ok.  The lettuce, tomatoes and cucumber were good.  The dressing was prepackaged, but decent.

The roll was old.  It was stale yesterday.  Not good. 

Without a drink the total was 9 bucks.  For ok food. .. meh."}
{"text":"I'll eat here for lunch if I need sustenance.  I'm generally not a big fan of deli shops, but when you need food - you need food!  There's really nothing fancy about their sandwiches - either that or I ordered the wrong meal (CK Parm Sandwich).  Does Boar's Head own this joint...talk about loyalty to the brand.  Granted Boar's Head does make some yummy deli meats, but man where's your own identity!?  Aside from the picture frames of old New York and some sports memorabilia; there's nothing New York about this place.  The price like all deli joints around - I feel is over priced.  Again, I come for lunch not for fine dining.  Service, well they were pretty quick I might add, but I hope it doesn't take much time to make a sandwich anyways.... - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Rinaldi's Italian Deli is a very good place for lunch if your in this area and looking for something a little lighter than a burger and fries.  They are conveniently located near the corner on Deer Valley and 19th ave, next to Dunkin Donuts.  They are open for breakfast, lunch and an early dinner.  

I recommend going during breakfast or lunch if your interested in their \"Specials of the Day\" that are on their hot plates. These items don't look too appetizing if you go by in the late afternoon or evening. 

They offer homemade soups and fresh cut salads loaded with just about anything you could imagine.  They have a small selection of homemade pasta salads as well.  

I had their pastrami on rye with their spicey, nazzle opening, and horse radishy dressing.  The pastrami was very good but had to be heated in a micro-wave. My sandwich was assembled very well so props to the girl behind the counter!  Their Italian pasta salad was excellent. Their Cob salad was also very good, nothing fancy but a good balance of veggies, bacon, egg, tomato, blue cheese, avocado with grilled chicken.

Not one of the better deli's in Phoenix but loads better than any chain deli!  It's a nice alternative to burgers and fries."}
{"text":"Ahhhhh the sweet smell of home! Love this place! Only deli in Arizona that knows how to cook actual New York food!! Believe me I've looked everywhere.. ?"}
{"text":"All of the very freshest ingredients!!!  Great place to grab a quick bite to go or sit and relax inside.  Either way, you won't be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"Just disappointed, I tried their Italian Combo and was faced with a poorly assembled sandwich, dry bread, cold cuts that were sliced too thick and not fresh.   If I wanted a production line sandwich I'd go to subway and I never go to subway.  First and last visit."}
{"text":"Went to Rinaldi's for my usual Max burrito with ham. John the owner was there and persuaded me to try the homemade chorizo.... he was right it was awesome!! Thanks John my new favorite! It's a must try!!"}
{"text":"They have the best east coast style breakfast sandwich, you just have to order it with a fried egg instead of scrambled."}
{"text":"We had traveled all over the country by far this was the worst  food and service  we experienced, the eggplant  was 90% breading sauce  was very oily,the kid at the register  was obvious  to taking orders,after $20. and with this experience  will not be back or recommend  this  restaurant."}
{"text":"I ordered from this joke of a place on the eat24 page of Yelp. I placed my order at 9:45 am for a 10:45 am delivery, but did not receive my order until 11:30 am. When I opened my salad, there was no dressing on it and the extra dressing I ordered and paid $1.00 for was also missing. 

Update: After contacting eat24, they contacted the restaurant and had them send my dressing. When I ate my salad, the croutons were soggy and the salad wasn't anything special. Overpriced for it's quality. Not likely to eat here again in the future."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The freshest most delicious sandwich I've had!! I had an Italian sandwich and it was perfect.  The owner is friendly and the staff is excellent.  Don't pass up the cannoli!!"}
{"text":"Yesterday I needed to meet a client from North of the valley and I had other customers to visit in Deer Valley.  There are not many places in the area open for breakfast that are not chains so I picked here.  Getting there at 8 I probably missed most of the folks getting breakfast or picking up a sandwich to take with them for lunch. The guy who runs the place has almost an attitude but you warm up to him pretty quick.  

I ordered the Max burrito which comes with egg, potato, cheese and your choice of bacon, sausage or ham ($4.29). It was pretty tasty.  It is moderate sized.  Price per ounce is easily twice that of a similar burrito at most of the local Mexican fast food places.  Part of that cost is location (Deer Valley is not cheap) and employee cost.

While I was there there was a steady stream of folks coming in but never really busy.  It is hard sometimes to get in the parking area because of the backup for the Dunkin Donut located at the other end of the building.

I am sure I will go back again because it isn't a chain, the food was OK and the service was pleasant."}
{"text":"Chicken noodle soup was very salty! Rinaldi's needs to find a better way to secure the lids and/or provide the employees with rubber bands so that the lid is secure when you are taking it to go. Sadly, my soup went all over my car because the lid was not tight enough. The egg salad sandwich was delicious but was served rather messy when it was cut in half. I would only recommend Rinaldi's if you are really hungry and don't feel like going to a Subway."}
{"text":"This is a little gem tucked away in the shopping center up at Frank Lloyd Wright and Scottsdale Road. Had the hunger after shopping and decided to drop in here for a sandwich. The owner is a doll and has nice dimples and was really sweet to me and my friend. We ordered a sandwich and it was freshly made and at the counter in a jiffy. Delicious and nutritious and a generous portion. Got the wedge which is like kind of a submarine sandwich length maybe about 6 inches. And split it with my friend and it was ample for curbing our hunger. I would return again for sure when I visit Scottsdale :-)"}
{"text":"Great little lunch place I love that southwest wrap and the fact they have sprouts. great place to eat and I definitely will be going back. Boars head meat is the best we bring it home all the time."}
{"text":"Really disappointing.    I had heard good things about this place, but it was truly awful.  The \"hot\" sandwich was luke warm, no flavor, really bland.  For the price I expected something really good.  Remined me of getting a sandwich from the high school cafeteria, glad there wasn't a lunch lady there to force me to eat it.  

Eek! Methinks not indeed."}
{"text":"It was ok...Nothing special.  I ordered an italian sub, and it was served on a bun/roll...not the Italian bread that I'm used to.  I should have just gone to Jimmy Johns."}
{"text":"A little hard to find, but well worth it when you do!  Old school italian deli with gorgeous meats!"}
{"text":"Rinaldi's is right by my workplace and I have always wanted to try it. I finally did today, and will not be going back. 

The chicken parmesan sandwich I bought was awful. It looked and tasted like they put cheese, bread crumbs, and tomato sauce in a blender and squirted the mix on bread. You wouldn't think it was a chicken parm. sandwich. Where is the chicken?

It is also very expensive. If I did not have to rush back for work, I would have said something. 

Please, save yourself money and time. It is gross."}
{"text":"I have ordered several times from them and they always have amazing food. Love that they deliver."}
{"text":"I've stopped by this Deli for lunch and breakfast.  When I came for lunch, I ordered a 10\" Italian Sandwich ($6.79)
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/UkqdcwYv6_c-yW1JPCKlUA?select=FvhTfKVsGt5FXtfjL7dgEw
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/UkqdcwYv6_c-yW1JPCKlUA?select=qaOSRK-FMOUZgooSqY8R4w

The Sandwich was very difficult to eat because it was served open-faced with the Meat pushing the Bread open....very strange as it made it difficult to fold back over and hold.  Also, they douse the bread with the Oil/Vinegar, so it gets soggy and breaks apart....WTH?  The taste was pretty good, but the experience sucked.  You can see what I'm talking about in my pics.

The 2nd time I stopped here, it was to try their Breakfast Burritos.....since the Max Burro was priced at $4.29, I only ordered 1 because I thought it would be huge....I was wrong, it was just a Med sized Burrito.  It was pretty good....Eggs, Bacon, Cheese, wrapped in a Tortilla.
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/UkqdcwYv6_c-yW1JPCKlUA?select=8gpyTOcWz6BWYTxxTc-UnA
I was disappointed with the size though.....I was still hungry after I finished it....bummer.  I didn't think the $4.29 was worth it...I think $3.50 would be a more appropriate price for a Med sized Breakfast Burrito.

Overall, I think this place has potential....right now, it only gets 3 Stars from me.

Return Factor - 67%"}
{"text":"first time order a sandwich plattler for my company they were very nice, i called them second time to order the samething and honestly the girl who attended me before i had a bad attitude! telling me i need to order a day before, for her information i didnt know you have to order a day before she never told me when i ask her the first time and second i will not recommend anyone to this place REALLY BAD customer service, rather go to subway where they wont complain"}
{"text":"Love their breakfast burritos, croissants! All of their sandwiches are amazing! I normally just get a turkey sub from there but they have the freshest ingredients and I receive great customer service everytime! I'm currently craving a cannoli from there."}
{"text":"Pretty decor but employees look like he didnt wanted to be there.  I adked for a brisket small in white bread , small sandwich price is 7.49 and i see he entered 9.49 at register. I questioned him and then he said they have to charge a big sandwich price becase they didnt had white in small. THEN PLEASE ASK QUESTIONS, DONT CHARGE ME MORE WITHOUT MY CONSENT! Most meats where like the one I could buy in Walmart! Teach employees to smile, ask questions or explain before just charging anything if you want a happy customer. Nope, will not go again, not worth it"}
{"text":"Hands down, the best chorizo burrito I have ever eaten!  It comes with homemade salsa that is outstanding and adds to the spiciness of the chorizo. This place gets a lot of breakfast traffic, so don't think twice about coming in and ordering something. The owners are amazingly friendly and it's just like coming over to a family members house the way they greet you when you walk in. Don't think twice about it, eat here!"}
{"text":"Always a good choice for a quick breakfast! A company I used to work for would order from here all the time, and made me a huge fan of the Easy Burro. Every employee I've interacted with has been great, and the owners are fantastic. You can't go wrong with the portions and prices."}
{"text":"Best deli in town! Boars head meats and delicious bread. All ingredients are quality. I can't say enough about this place. I recommend it to everyone I know in Scottsdale. When my sister was grabbing me a sandwich last week I asked her where she was going her response \"duh.. the ONLY place to go!\" If u haven't been here try it. Little slice of New York here in the Valley. And don't get me started on their deserts.. yum!"}
{"text":"I go to this location all the time because I work at T-Mobile which is basically on the other side of the building. The food here is hands-down delicious. They have a great selection of both hot and cold foods sandwiches and dessert items. Not to mention the lovely ladies that take your order are so nice there Smiles are beautiful they gave great recommendations and they are absolutely a joy to talk to. The only reason it's four stars and not 5 stars is more personal the reason being is that I don't get a mall discount at Rinaldi's and all the other food places in the Promenade give Mall discounts to other Mall employees. Obviously if you don't work in the Promenade that shouldn't be a deal-breaker for you if you're reading my review however for me not really a deal-breaker either because I still go there all the time hence why I wish they would give me the damn discount."}
{"text":"Delicious Delicious Delicious !!!! Loved loved my Prosciutto Sandwich on a sub bread!! The customer service was so so kind. The owner treated and spoke to us as if we were family! Definitely going back !!"}
{"text":"I love to get the breakfast burrito. It is so good I recommend the Max Burro with bacon and you have to eat it with their salsa it takes the burrito to the next level! Very fast service and friendly owners."}
{"text":"Decided to try something, 'new', to me at least. I've passed by this spot on multiple occassions and it seems to have a steady flow of foot traffic, so I took the commitment of actually walking in and checking out their menu selection. 

The pricing is a bit odd, for the most part all their sandwiches are priced the same, but they had about 20+ sandwiches listed with 2 prices- based on size. I decided to keep it simple and got the pastrami with mustard and pickles. All their deli meats are Boars Head, which Is a pretty good brand overall. The sandwich was good but I was a lil disappointed that it wasn't hot, more less warm. They give you a small bag of Wise chips with the sandwich which are alright but not the greatest. After spending $9 on the sandwich and a drink I felt a lil cheated, don't think I got my moneys worth but it wasn't a bad sandwich."}
{"text":"Straight outta NY.  Get decent deli and all the attitude you would expect.  They use Boar's Head meat which is top quality, but the bread is in need of a change.  Hot pastrami is especially good if available as a daily special."}
{"text":"Food is over priced for what you get, you can go any where else in Arizona to get more for your money and have better tasting food. The owner is also something else extremely loud and incompetent."}
{"text":"If you are looking for legit and authentic Italian food, you have to visit Rinaldi's.  this place runs a tight ship, has great service and the food is to die for.  Amazing pasta, salads and sandwiches.  If you are a business rep that needs catering options for lunch meetings, give Rinaldi's a call."}
{"text":"We order from Rinaldi's on a regular basis, about 2 to 3 times a week at our office. The only thing that really keeps us ordering is their food is pretty good. However they always mess up the order, a girl at our office is highly algeric to cheese (something we tell them EVERYTIME) and she asks for Italian dressing they always give her blue cheese. They are always leaving something off the order, or putting something in that we requested it not to be in the food, and they take so long to deliver, typically an hour, and we are about 5 minutes up the road.

The most recent occasion that has finally made us draw the line with their terrible customer service was when we ordered lunch on Eat24, requested payment by cash and they charged the credit card on file. We told the delivery guy it was a mistake and it was supposed to be cash, so they said they would reverse the charge and we paid the driver cash. Well a week later and the charge is still on our account and when I spoke to the owner he was very rude and hostile with me when I was rightly frustrated that they were paid cash and didn't care to reverse the charge. He said he had to wait an hour to talk to his delivery guy, which I don't understand why over a week later this is just only now happening. I told him that I didn't appreciate the way they were treating us as customers who order from them at least 2 to 3 times a week. He didn't care at all. WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE."}

Didn't bother ordering."}
{"text":"We order these breakfast burritos to the office ALL THE TIME ! They are the best in town ! I'm not normally a breakfast eater but I sure eat these ! Flavorful , good soft crispy thin flour tortillas , excellent salsa .. And the delivery guy is always nice and smiley. They're all good but my fav is the Max Bacon ... Mmmm mmmmm good !"}
{"text":"My coworkers and I order from here constantly! We work at my sisters attic right across the street. I love their breakfast sandwiches as well as the cold cut sandwiches. The staff is always friendly and I've never been disappointed with my food."}

I'm a VERY picky eater, and I've yet to have a bad sandwich, salad or pasta meal. Everything is so fresh and all of their recipes are very obviously meticulously thought out, and all hold true to a born and bred New York deli/restaurant quality type of meal.  

The staff is always SO kind, patient and helpful to me and my aging boss.  We are so thankful that they deliver and are so close to our office (3 miles), and to boot, they're faster than Jimmy Johns.    Don't forget to try their cannoli's too!  gahh so yum!"}

--rolls are just right for these hoagies. flavorful and soak up whatever sauce goes with your meat.
--MEAN beef brisket
--meatballs and sauce. ooh the sauce.
--sausage and peppers. oh, which one to pick?

--trio salad of egg salad, chicken salad and tuna salad on a plate of lettuce. Italian dressing has mild vinegar.
--great deli salads. take your pick: broccoli and cashew, macaroni, potato, they're all tasty
--three fridges of beverages. all the flavors. take your pick.
--service with the kind of New York 'tude you'd expect from a place like this.
--casual and small dining area, some tables outside too, but not when it's summer.

It's worth the drive."}
{"text":"We had such a good lunch experience here, great quality food and super friendly owner. The deli sandwiches we ordered were so fresh and piled high. The ambiance kept the two year old busy with all of the sports paraphernalia, and he got to try a few slices of pepperoni on the house! The chocolate chip cookie topped it all off, We will be back!"}
{"text":"Not sure what's happened in the past few months but very disappointed every time. All I get are salads and lately the chicken is cold, rubbery and dry.. It didn't used to be this way before all these new faces showed up! After today, I've had it and won't be back."}
{"text":"The food is great here but I cannot say the same for service. 

I ordered a few things for my coworkers and I in the office and they told us it would take about 40 mins to deliver the food, which is a little long but we figured it could get busy there. Here we are an hour and a half later and still no food!

I called a few times to ask where they are and they said they would be on their way soon. 

We ordered this food for breakfast and we are receiving it for lunch time. Not happy."}

{"text":"Very rude girls at the counter and the owner is a horrible person. Countless problems the five times I went leading me to never go back and, instead, go to Chloe's Corner, not too far away, which has sandwiches full of meat. (Not an ounce, like on the sandwiches at Rinaldi's)."}
{"text":"Seriously, the best place to get breakfast! Any opportunity I get to stop here, I do!"}
{"text":"I think this is one of the best deli's in Phoenix.  I come here 3 to 4 times per week for my fried egg, bacon and cheese sandwich.  John and Bolivia treat you like you're family.

For lunch, the roast beef sandwich is some of the best roast beef I've ever had. Rare sliced, makes for the perfect sandwich.

If you're in the area, you must stop here for breakfast or lunch.

BTW..The staff is fantastic"}
{"text":"I moved from NJ to WY about 8 years ago. Which is just as long as I have been searching for an authentic Italian sandwich. THANK YOU \"Rinald's\" for finally, putting an end to my search!!!! The bread, the cheese and the meats, OUTSTANDING!!!!! You've made a Jersey girl, incredibly happy!"}
{"text":"A little taste of the home land!  New York Italian deli done right.  John and Bolivia make outstanding dishes and some tasty sandwiches.  Also, they have incredible breakfast burritos- made with Bolivia's own home made salsa.  You wouldn't expect a NY deli to do breakfast burritos but this place is legit. I like the \"Max\" bacon with eggs and potatoes personally.

Lunch is great.  They make home made hot brisket and corned beef different days of the week and you can't go wrong with one of those subs for lunch.

In a time when everything is a chain and corporate owned its nice to have a local spot like Rinaldi's still open and making great food.

Also, I had no idea they delivered and Ive been going there for years!  Perfect for office breakfast, have them bring over some burritos!"}
{"text":"Have come here twice while doing a bank run for work and I love their breakfast burritos! They hit the spot!  I have ordered their max burrito and their eggs, cheese, and potatoes burritos. They are pretty big and filling. 

Customer service is good really friendly atmosphere kind of feels like it's family owned and operated. They fix your order pretty fast as well. I did notice they also have sandwiches I've yet to try one. Maybe one day I will"}
{"text":"I have been here a few times.  Once for breakfast and the rest for lunch.  The 1st time I ate here I had the brisket sandwich and it was very bad.  The meat was beyond dry.  The other day I stopped in for breakfast and it was OK but nothing to write home about.  All and all I would say that this place is OK.  Some people that I work with like it a lot and some not so much.  I hope this helps."}
{"text":"Worst sausage and peppers sandwich ever.  I would not waste my money or time.  My son ordered a meatball sub that was served on a hamburger bun.  The service was far from friendly."}
{"text":"We tried Ronaldo's because it was around the corner from our office but now it is my  favorite deli in AZ by far. Super cozy with friendly service. Their corn beef sandwich is outstanding. Order it just they way they offer it."}
{"text":"I stopped in here at about 10:15am a couple days ago. I looked at the hot food section which consisted of sausage and peppers, chicken parm, ziti and a couple other things. It didn't look that good to me for so early in the morning. I tried maple ham on a wedge. Apparently they call a roll a \"wedge\" here.

The wedge wasn't cut right so when I got the sandwich the ham was just kind of piled on top of the bread. It tasted ok but it wasn't anything special. And for $11.20, that's too much for a ham sandwich and a drink!

The food was ok but there's too many places that have better food and I was hoping to be wowed when I saw this was an Italian deli."}
{"text":"I think I'll be kind and round up to 4, though I believe 3.5 is fair. This is a fine place - the prices are decent for the amount of food you get, it tastes pretty good, and the menu is quite vast for a deli. 

The lunch rush here can be absolutely crazy, largely because of the large Honeywell facility that it practically shares a parking lot with. The earlier the better, lest you have a long wait...I recommend pre-11:15am for lunch. 

I've had the sausage and peppers, as well as the Italian sub. Both were good...the bread left a bit to be desired though. The sausage and other meats were tasty, minus them obviously forgetting to remove the \"skin\" or wrapping from the pepperoni, which isn't something fun to discover mid-bite. 

The people here do seem quite authentic New York - they're OK, they get the job done, but are not overly friendly. Oh well..."}
{"text":"One of my favorite things about walking into some place is catching a vibe and all of the sudden you've walked into a whole different world. Welcome to New York or little Italy arizonan's! They have breakfast, and lunch items, from breakfast burritos, to a corned beef sandwich. You can even take meat home by the pound. I ordered a turkey and roastbeef sandwich, and and chicken parmesean sandwich! They ask if you want cheese, lettuce, tomato, and mayo- yes please all of the above, but don't stop there. Add jalepenos, green peppers, vinegar, oil, salt, and pepper and you've got it made. The bread is FRESH. not hard or containing any kinda rubber anything. Delicious! They have  great selection of chips, drinks, an"}
{"text":"Absolutely the best breakfast burrito you will ever eat! They make their own salsa and sell it by the jar also. I eat here at least once a week for breakfast. Seriously, you need to try the burritos if you are in this neighborhood for breakfast. Friendly people who own the place and work here. Just a cute little neighborhood joint."}
{"text":"I love Rinaldi's! The food is outstanding; a true gem in Phoenix. Not only is the food phenomenal, but they treat you like family. I moved to the valley from New York and I never thought I would find a true New York deli and I did! Thank you so much for the great food and service!!!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best breakfast burritos in town!!!! We drive from south Scottsdale to get them. Get either the bacon max or sausage max burrito, they are amazing... 

The portion size for the burrito is smaller than your Filibertos or \"filisquirtos\" but you won't feel disgusting and want to vomit when your done eating.

The reason for the 4 stars - the customer service is good if they like you, they can be a little cold if they don't or if they don't know you, but that's any New York deli especially if your back east. I love this place and whenever I want a want a burrito, I make the drive!"}
{"text":"What the hell? An Italian deli without a caprese sandwich or even a damn caprese salad??  I was shocked and disgusted.  Disgusted and shocked.  How could this happen?  What were they thinking?  My favorite thing on earth is that basil, mozzarella and tomato combo, and never have I set foot into an Italian restaurant or deli that didn't offer one. Hell, even freaking Greek restaurants offer one, so I truly was saddened by Rinaldi's caprese exclusion.

Rinaldi's also isn't the most vegetarian-friendly joint, but if you eat meat, you'll be in heaven.  They have thick slices of roast beef, turkey, ham, pastrami...you name it...on thick slices of bread.  They have an egg salad sandwich too- I didn't try it, but that's always an option for vegetarians.  I tried the eggplant parm sandwich and it was pretty tasty. 

The menu also has some pasta choices and a ton of salads.  And it's a pretty cute New York-style deli, but I just can't give it more than 3 stars for excluding the love of my life."}
{"text":"Ty for your understanding john I really do love your food and may have just gotten a bad example that day and will try again  in the near future"}
{"text":"I had a sandwich here a few months ago which was just okay.. I decided to go back and give it another chance. I was going to order a breakfast burrito before going into work.. I got to the counter and the lady was going to help me, but a man(seemed like the owner or manager??) was yelling at her about her bad work ethic and comparing to the other girls who worked there. I was standing there for almost a minute without being acknowledged at all and I couldn't believe he would talk to his employee like that in front of customers so I walked out and went to work hungry. I wish Someburros opened earlier!!!"}
{"text":"Order their breakfast burritos from work all the time and they are delish. They deliver which is great bc it's a pain in the butt to leave work. So much better then the City Market Deli in our building. Big portions and a good price. Their salsa is also delish, love this place!"}
{"text":"I've been a fan of this place for a while. I used to work nearby and we'd order delivery all the time! My boyfriend works close by and I got him hooked too! I sometimes order random surprise breakfasts for him, I'm basically obsessed with the fact that they deliver. 

Aside from that.. Their breakfast burritos are fantastic, and the salsa is so delicious and addicting! We came in today for a quick breakfast and we're wow'd! Great atmosphere, a true deli just like in New York. Wonderful customer service, very clean. 
Their delicious looking cannolis were starring me in the face the whole time. We can't wait to go back! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Just another typically Italian deli with Italian attitude. Can't have decent service or food when the owner is a cheapskate!

The guy behind the counter was putting the chicken into my chicken parmesan sandwich when the owner says, \"That's way too much take it off. What are you thinking?\". Uhhh, Hello I am standing right here. That sandwich was all cheese, marinara and 4 SMALL SMALL chunks of chicken...It should be called a cheese pizza sandwich instead!

Too many other italian delis to choose from to ever go back to this dump!"}
{"text":"I'd give it 2.5 stars overall. Boar's Head meats are a plus, but I'd prefer some imported stuff when it comes to soppresatas, mortadellas and capicollas capice?

Its clean, the selection is good. Staff seemed a bit lackadaisacal - but it was a slow Friday afternoon. The TV was not tuned in to a station - was on the menu of DirecTV. If the staff has nothing to do, since nobody is there - don't you think they would have picked SOMETHING to tune in on the big flat-panel? They did, after we were 1/2 done with our sandwiches.

Almost all the sandwiches here are the same price - and I think of that as the lazy businessman's answer to menu planning. Tuna and bologna just shouldn't be priced the same as mortadella!

The pickles that came with the sandwiches were cold and crisp, but not the best pickle ever. Still, cold and crisp is more than many places offer. The vinaigrette on the subs could have used more vinegar if you ask me. Perhaps a higher acid red wine vinegar, or a nice champagne vinegar...something to kick it up just a bit.

It's a nice place, probably worthy of 3 stars - but it just didn't \"feel\" like 3 stars - so I'm standing firm at 2.5."}
{"text":"Rinaldis Deli.  Is by far one on the greatest places you can get a sandwich my favorite are the Italian sausage,  meatball, and chicken parmesean.  There meats are the best Boars Head.  By the things I like most about Rinaldi's are that I am from Chicago and this is the closet and best sandwiches I can get in the valley.  The other is the family that owns it and takes pride in there customer service.  One last thing they have an amazing chorizo burrito for breakfast with his wife's homemade salsa to die for.  You should really check it out if not you are truly missing out"}
{"text":"Their meatball & chicken parmesan heros are phenomenal. $8 for a hearty sub that fills you very well is a great deal. A great New York style Italian deli in northern Phoenix makes me feel like I'm back on Long Island, can't miss."}
{"text":"Sub Par - For a samich shop. 

Bread was decent prolly from Sysco ? 
Boars Head meats is why a 3 Star not 2.
Very Clean interior (hope Kitchen just as clean)

They didnt Skimp on the Meat, but when i said, No tomatoes, but everyhting else... so I guess Everything else means Provolone, Lettuce and Mayo...... and 8 bucks plus some change..

I will give it one more try, and maybe order better,, didnt know that was my part to make sure onions, pickle, olives, jalepeno, peppers, salt, spinach etc etc need to be called out... 

1 more chance Rinaldi's ... Will see what you got... !"}
{"text":"I went to grub hub to place my order. Since I run an at home daycare I wanted some good breakfast food. I had a $20.00 order. I submitted it then almost instantly my phone rang. The owner was very rude and told me the ONLY reason he was delivering my food is because I pre-paid thru the site. That he only delivers to commercial businesses. For one grub hub doesn't say that and when I called them they were as shocked as I was since he has never stated this. I will not lie, I will never walk foot into his deli. I do have a business n since my name isn't pet smart or something he doesn't want my business. Your loss I use grub hub a lot!! Anyway food was good, but I lost ALL respect for you sir! Remember your a small business owner as well n karma is a b!"}
{"text":"The best customer service, food is fast, fresh, and delicious! Love Mr. Rinaldi, he always greets us by name!"}
{"text":"I'm born and raised in Chicago and frequent Italian deli's all the time in Chicago. Rinaldi's isn't Italian deli 
It's called a sandwich shop with salads and fountain drinks.
I stopped there for a egg sandwich and requested that they cook the egg over medium and cut the sandwich in half. 
I really wanted to two eggs but they charged $1.75 for extra egg. That's ridiculous!! 
I took a bite and the egg ran all over my shirt and the sandwich wasn't cut in half. The staff is very rude and cocky to customers. 

Personally I wouldn't return to Rinaldi's !!"}
{"text":"As many others have said this place is just outright disappointing. Overpriced for new low average food. Won't be back."}
{"text":"I decided to check this place out today for lunch with a friend and it was pretty good.  They have only Boar's Head meats and cheeses.  I was hoping for a bit more of a New York style deli.  I had the Pastrami and Corned Beef combo sandwich.  The meats weren't hot or fresh like at Miracle Mile so that's why I can't give it 4 or 5 stars.  It was a nice clean place though and seemed to have a decent size crowd from neighboring Honeywell.  The prices were a bit high over $10 for a sandwich chips and drink.  Overall 3/5"}
{"text":"Very good deli. They give you a nice fresh large deli sandwich. I had the beef brisket and it was tasty. Nice fresh roll. My daughter had a \"small\" ham and cheese sandwich and it was huge! Nice place!"}
{"text":"Their Max Burro Breakfast Burrito is BOMB!!!! So good! I always get the bacon one (or they have ham too I think) and the bacon is crispy! And thick! I don't like the paper thin kind some places offer. I'm picky. But seriously it's all about the SALSA!!! It's perfect salsa, I think. They sell it by the jar cause IT'S SO GOOD. Service is always nice and actually pretty fast too. I haven't eaten anything else from them but by far they have my favorite breakfast burrito in the valley! Oh, and did I mention it's less than $5?"}
{"text":"Hankering for a meatball sandwich, Rinaldi's deli was calling my name.  I had never been here before, but had passed it a few times while driving down 19th Ave.  I stopped in at about 2:15 and ordered a Large Meatball Sandwich, to go.  Total was $9.00.  Took about 5 minutes or so and my sandwich was ready.  Here is how it was..........

Meatball Sandwich-  Good news and bad news.  Good news is that the meatballs were delicious!  Bad news was that there were only 3 of them.  For a \"large\" sandwich, it was actually kind of small.  Filling enough, but an extra meatball thrown in there would provide for a better sandwich.  The roll they use is only about 8 or 9 inches (that's what she said!) long.  The bread was good though, the cheese was nice and melty and like I said before, the meatballs were very good.  The sauce was just ok.  The sandwich comes with a pickle spear and a tiny bag of Lay's potato chips.

Service was indifferent.  The 3 employees were standing there chatting..one was counting the register and the other 2 were sort of just hanging out.  I wasn't really greeted (didn't really bother me because they were counting money), and kind of just told her what I wanted.  Not sure if they were closing soon, or what?  Anyways.....will I be back?  Eh...maybe.  It was a good meatball sandwich, but for $9.00, I wasn't overly impressed."}
{"text":"They have the best breakfast burritos I have ever had! The max burro with bacon is amazing. And the cannolis are spot on."}
{"text":"Just passing by one morning and wanted breakfast. Saw Dunkin Donut's and this in one building. Chain vs. local business. Had to go with this place and glad I did. I had a breakfast burro (sausage, egg, and cheese that came with a small tub of salsa) which was $4.50. I must say, it was really good!! The burro was made with love lol. I recommend for others to try out their breakfast items!"}
{"text":"Italian sandwich - tasted good, but wow - way over priced.  It was basically a hamburger bun with meat and cheese on it.  This joint is small, but charming.  The guy behind the counter needs a lesson (several?) in customer service.  There's \"New York Style Schtick\" and then there's just plain asshole.  This guy was asshole with a capital ASS.  He seemed to be very rude with the kitchen guy and gal.  When a customer walks into a place, they should feel like they are welcomed .... not like they rudely interrupted someone's personal time.  That's what I felt like after I left there - like somehow I burdened them by ordering their tiny sandwich.  Oh well.  These types of places are a dime a dozen.  Good luck, Rinaldi's."}
{"text":"RANT STATUS: ENGAGED 

OKAY NEVER COMING HERE AGAIN. 
lets talk about this dreadful experience from the beginning just on the phone. 
1. After repeating my order 3 times, where it was consistently repeated back incorrectly, she seemed to FINALLY understand the 4 things I ordered and asked for my name. I said it was JESSICA somehow that was changed to Claudia and then Miranda... WHAT!?!?! 
When my friend went to go pick up our food for us... they were missing a whole burrito, still screwed up an order when I clearly said one of the burritos was with bacon ( they gave us sausage) AND I HAD TO WALK SOME GUY THROUGH THE ORDER AGAIN OVER THE PHONE BECAUSE IT STILL WAS INCORRECT
Seriously. Its like speaking to a two year old.  So irritating. 
So other than having to spend 20 minutes of my time to relay what 4 items off the menu I wanted we get out food...
4 minutes after my coworker was eating her food, she had to rush to the bathroom to throw up and had to be sent home early from work .
This is not the first time this has happened to a friend of ours but desperate times call for desperate measures and we were giving this place one more shot, and yup, they are terrible. 
DO NOT COME TO THIS LOCATION THEY SUCK. 
End of story."}
{"text":"I love this place. I always get the Max burro with bacon. It's a breakfast burrito and it is so good!! I crave them all time. They have super good food and the staff is really nice too."}
{"text":"A buddy of mine brought me here and boy am I glad.  I probably would have never found this hidden surprise otherwise, tucked away in a shopping center.  Have been here a couple times now and am working my way through the menu.

Sausage and peppers sandwich was terrific, the bread was soft and fresh just how I like it.  The Italian sandwich was also phenomenal.  I tend to find something I like and stick with it as my go to, but here I am going to keep ordering different things each time I go back, somehow I think it's safe to roll the dice at Rinaldi's.  My friend had the baked Ziti which of course I snuck a few bites, did I mention I LOVE baked ziti? 

I keep hearing about their breakfast burritos and salsa.... Next time."}
{"text":"This place is a true hidden gem! I don't even know that I could try a sandwich here because I'm just stuck on the chorizo burritos. Someone told me they were good here and I didn't believe them. Chorizo burrito at a deli?? Friends, this is hands down the best chorizo breakfast burrito I have encountered at any restaurant so far. Crispy potatoes, the chorizo is not overly greasy, and they'll even add bacon to it!! I took my family here just so they would believe me! My dad and I loved ours so much we decided to order another and split it!!
I'm assuming the owner was the one working that morning and he was so friendly and funny! He made he experience all the better! I am so glad to have found this place!"}
{"text":"I was super excited that another of the restaurants in the area delivers  since I work in a corporate building and can't often get out for lunch.  Unfortunately for my very FIRST experience, the order that I placed online at 9:30am to be delivered at 11:30am did not arrive until 12:10pm.  I had called and spoke to a woman who immediately began to make excuses that \"There was another catering order being delivered\" and that \"getting through the security gates takes time\".  I did not call for excuses.  I expect any business would provide good customer service.  In the event there was to be a delay, a simple phone call would have remedied the situation,  In addition, if the business were to make ANY type of effort to remedy the faux pas, there MAY be another order placed in the future.  Unfortunately that has not been the case.  It's amazing how quickly the word will spread in a company of 3000 people that all like to eat lunch and have events catered.  It's unfortunate too because the sandwich was actually pretty good."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times, maybe I'm ordering the wrong stuff but its like I just opened my fridge, slapped on some cold cuts between two piece of bread and that was it. The problem with this place is that its like a sandwich you could make at home or pick up in the supermarket for half the price."}
{"text":"I love coffee bean and luckily Rinaldi's was right next door. LOVE that it's not only family owned but operated. The food was amazing ... breakfast was fabulous. I ate an egg and bacon sandwich (nothing else fancy on it) and the flavor was amazing. One of my favorite things- aside from the delish food- was watching several customers come in and greeting the Owner, Mr Rinaldi. Including these folks kiddos. Not only has this deli and hidden breakfast spot stolen many locals hearts, but it's stolen mine (originally from Colorado)."}
{"text":"No \"hello, welcome to...\" when I walked in.
There was nobody else in the place.

Stood there about a minute while employees did other things and then 
\"C' I take your order?\"

Sausage and peppers sandwhich was ok.  The sausages looked re-heated.  Probably ordered wrong.  The Eggplant Parm looked better.

A cheesy bag of chips which are made back East.  

Walked out the door and was waiting for a \"Thank you for...\"
Nada."}
{"text":"I really liked the sandwich I had here, was very nice inside and the ingredients were very fresh. I really liked how nice the staff was to my wife. They treated her with respect we will be eating here often now."}
{"text":"Best breakfast burrito in town!

I only come here for the bacon or sausage max burrito (egg, meat, cheese and potatoes), so my 5 star is solely based on that. However, it is amazing. Perfect size, fabulous flavor and delicious tortilla. They serve it with a side of yummy salsa too. 

It's definitely worth a morning visit!"}
{"text":"I'm a glutton for punishment . High prices low qualiity and I keep coming back . Never again . Salad was horrible , all stocks of romaine lettuce and the avocado was brown . I've tapped out ."}
{"text":"Best deli west of the mason Dixon! Love the pastrami sandwich! Affordable and quality Burrito and Breakfast sandwiches are awesome! Must try"}
{"text":"Rinaldis is the best! Wether you want a delicious breakfast sandwich or burrito or a fresh meaty sub - this is the place to go! I always bring breakfast sandwiches to the office and to my clients and they love it. It's fresh, made right in front of you, and the customer service is always phenomenal. My favorite is the #2 breakfast sandwich! And any of the lunch subs are sure to satisfy."}
{"text":"I was working in the area for a few days and didn't know it at all. I was going in to DD and didn't feel like waiting. I came here and got a bacon egg and cheese on a roll. It was pretty good and got it fast but they were a bit over priced. At the end of the day i was satisfied after the meal."}
{"text":"The bread-delish!
The cockroaches still alive in the trap under the soda machine - on the kitchen counter? Umm...not so much."}
{"text":"The prices are very high for deli sandwiches.  You do not get much value for the cost. Customer service here reminds me of the Seinfeld Soup episode where the owners/workers are not very friendly, seem to not care if you return as a loyal customer, and I felt that my patronizing went unappreciated.  

I like to be appreciated as a customer, and valued. It would be nice to be greeted with a friendly hello, and a thank you when you leave, but that is not the case here on my experience.

I won't be visiting again. There are far less pricey sandwich shops and delis around with much friendlier customer service."}
{"text":"Maybe the best chicken Parmesan sandwich in the valley. That's literally all you need to know. You can get very good sandwiches here, for certain, and their breakfast burritos are awesome...but if you're here for lunch just get the chicken parm, then come back and get it again."}
{"text":"Best breakfast burritos ever!!!  I would recommend the max burro with bacon.  Their brisket is great, too, on the days they have it."}
{"text":"Our go-to weekly spot for the absolute BEST breakfast burrito's and homemade salsa!! Being from NY ourselves, we love the family oriented customer service and atmosphere. We bring all of our family/friends here- never disappoints!"}
