{"text":"Wow. The name is deceiving. Plaza is a little run down. But it's the best chinese takeout place in the dundas/kipling area by far.  Prices are REALLY low and the food is amazing. You get an overabundance of grub for under 10$ always.   2 ppl will get stuffed for 20.  And one of you won't be able to finish. You can call and your order is ready in 20 mins. Great if your coming home around midnight and looking for some good food."}
{"text":"This used to be one of our favorite Chinese Food Restaurants. We have been customers since they opened. We waited when they renovated from a fire and resumed business and were loyal. We found them to be a nice family oriented business.   After the fire they have not been very good and there food less than up to par. They have people answering the phone who are less than courteous and the food is not up to the same standard as it used to be. We miss items in an order. Food comes burnt or undercooked. We finally decided to bring it to there attention politely of course and after more than 15 years of being there customer we were told to go somewhere else if we didn't like how they gave us the food. Talk about shock. I once upon a Time would have raved and sent everyone there way and now I would suggest finding a better quality place to get your Chinese food from."}

{"text":"What makes it a five we'll I have not tried all the items that's why. Cops eat there so you know it's good, excellent snow peas and chicken!"}
{"text":"The best Chinese Food in Etobicoke. Their crispy ginger beef, Orange chicken and their rice with egg is just to die for. Prices are great too.  Staff is friendly and the kitchen looks very clean. It's a hidden gem!!!"}
{"text":"Can't believe this is the same place I ordered from a month ago. Just finished one of the worst , tasteless, vile, bland, undercooked and over cooked food I've had in years.   Etobicoke doesn't have the best restaurants so hoping to find a good Chinese food establishment is risky at best.  Just pure crap! I read the reviews and thought the CFG would be good and it was OK the first time, this is at the other end of the scale. A waste of money.  Sorry CFG you can't make up for it and I'm not coming back."}
{"text":"Try the Ginger Beef - you will be addicted. Delivery is quick - prices reasonable - really the best in the area."}
{"text":"The food taste great! I ordered the crispy beef, Chinese broccoli, and young chow fried rice, yummy!!!"}
{"text":"I've been ordering from Chinese Food Gallery for about 2 years now. It's been hit or miss, but mostly hit, and most things that I like are good, so it's the Chinese place I order from the most.   If you're like me, you like to sample the menu.. so I'll give a 'yay' or 'nay' based on what I've ordered from here. Hopefully it can help you decide.   Won Ton Soup: yay Egg Roll: nay -- very hard to find good egg rolls in Etob, Mandarin is the only one that passes for me Chow Mein (bean sprouts): yay Rice: yay, and the Pineapple Fried Rice a la Thai was better than I expected. (Lucky Garden makes even better rice IMHO) General Tso Chicken: nay, but everyone else seems to like it so ...  Moo Goo Gai Pan: yay Chicken in Black Bean Sauce: yay Beef and Broccoli: yay Lemon Chicken: yay, and they serve the sauce on the side so the chicken is crispy, not drenched! Noodles (Singapore, Cantonese Chow Mein, Lo Mein): nay, my biggest disappointment with this place :(   Also, if you order chow mein don't be deceived by their menu and web site. The section on \"Chop Suey and Chow Mein\" makes it look like 'chop suey' is the bean sprout version while 'chow mein' is the crispy noodles version. If you want the crispy noodle version of chow mein, you want to order the \"Cantonese style Chow Mein\" -- every other chow mein will come with bean sprouts."}
{"text":"We had a delivery last night from this restaurant. Not sure what everyone who is giving them a good review is talking about The worst Chinese food I have ever had. Greasy oily and tasteless. The wonton soup was like dishwater we through the whole thing out. I will never ever ordered from here again. We oredered there before they renovated and reopened, it was good then I don't know what happened"}
{"text":"Since I wrote a single review about how bad Ho Lee Chow was I figured it was only fair to write a review about a place that is great... this place has the best Chinese Food that I've ever had in the city. Plus it is very reasonably priced! If I am ever in the mood for Chinese... this is definitely the place."}
{"text":"Excellent take out joint - ordered enough food for a party of 15. Chicken balls were full of chicken, chicken chow mein also contained a good portion of meat and mixed vegetables. The crispy beef was some of the best I've tasted. Price was reasonable for the quantity and quality. Will make this a go-to spot!"}
{"text":"This used to always be our go-to for chinese tae out.  Since the fire the food has gone downhill and our last order was terrible."}
{"text":"This is really just a take out or delivery place. It's small and the decor is non existent so not a place to bring a date.   Having said that this is my go to place for Chinese take out. Always fast on the delivery, I think last time it took a little over 20 minutes from the time I hung up to having the delivery guy knock on my door.   The quality is always consistent and tasty. The portions are huge for most dishes. Almost every dish is good for two meals (and I eat a lot). It's also super cheap - about $10 for most dishes, cheaper if you get a veggie only dish.   Been ordering from here for two years now."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food in the area. Highly recommend crispy beef . Besides, they also make Thai food. The Pad Thai is even better than most Thai restaurant."}
{"text":"They handle money, phone then food :S After I complained that she handled cash then dug up tofu for my dish without washing hands...she told me \"it will get cooked, the heat will kill the germs\" :-0 ew!"}
{"text":"Take out and delivery only. Pretty good food, no complaints. Been ordering here for 3 or 4 years.  I like the sweet and sour spare ribs, House Special fried rice, Chicken Chow Mein. Sometimes it tastes better than other times. Guess it depends who\"s cooking."}
{"text":"Awesome staff.  Awesome food.  Discounts on pickup and cash payment.  We have yet to be disappointed with this place.  Great spring rolls, lemon chicken and crispy beef."}
{"text":"ordered on justeat.ca waited for 1hour and 30 mins food never arrived(I got my confirmation email) called them I informed them that I ordered from justeat.ca one of the lady answered said there's no order, no number. and I was like wtf? my credit card got charged fuck this restaurant ill never order from them again..horrible service and they sound like they dont wanna deliver food and the lady answered sounds really angry...shouldve closed your resto.   avoid ordering from them if you dont want a headache and waste of time."}
{"text":"When you see this place and hear the name \"Chinese Food Gallery\" it doesn't really inspire thoughts of gourmet food. Truthfully, I've been living literally across the street from CFG for over a year and have never even conceived of eating here. I always see the delivery guy in my building so I started to get intrigued.  Well they say don't judge a book by a cover... so after a long day at work and not feeling like cooking anything whatsoever, I decided to be adventurous and attempt this \"culinary delight.\"  I ordered General Tso Chicken solely based on the picture and the fact that I vaguely remember drunken nights in Chinatown having tried the stuff. IT WAS DELICIOUS! Perfectly cooked chicken in a delicious sauce with a nice portion of stir fried veggies. The whole lot cost me about $9.  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The name 'Chinese Food Gallery' didn't really get my mouth watering. But oh well. I didn't have a craving for anything specific, and my friends felt like chinese, so chinese we got.  It just a little take-out place, you can't go in there and sit down to eat. The menu is very extensive. There was another person waiting for their order when we got there, and when we left there were 3 more people ordering. The place seems pretty busy, which is a good sign. When the man behind the counter was really friendly and helpful. I ordered the beef with broccoli and cantonese noodles. The food came super quick, maybe 4 or 5 minutes later and it smelled so good!  I wasn't disappointed when I tried it either. Good beef, not fatty, yummy flavourful noodles too. It was a lot of food and i still have some for lunch today. I'd definitely go back again :)"}
{"text":"Although it's not the best looking place from outside, inside you can discover a fairly priced take away Chinese food and a wide range of dishes in the menu (100+ items)."}
{"text":"Our go to for Chinese takeout. Consistently yummy.  There is no where to sit in the restaurant, you literally order and take out (not sure if they have delivery?).  Food is very tasty and has never been overly greasy.  Our favourite things to order are lemon chicken, veggie chow mien, crispy beef, pineapple friend rice, and the crispy spring rolls."}
{"text":"Yuck.  Bad BBQ pork fried rice, Cashew chicken left me feeling 'stomach sick'.  Felt gross for hours after eating there, no eat in, only take out. Counter person was useless, had to over explain 2 items, I was the only customer and she couldn't remember what I was waiting for. Good riddance to this place, it blows!"}
{"text":"Glad to see this little gem is open again after the fire.  I discovered this place twenty years ago when I first moved to Etobicoke.  I have never been disappointed with food, delivery or p reordered pickups."}
{"text":"Good prices, ready when stated over phone and hot once we got it home!  Impressed so far!  The lemon chicken was the best I have in 51 years of loving that dish!  So many times the chicken is so overcooked you can't tell the difference between it and the breading, but here it was white and tender in a tasty covering!  The lemon sauce sent separately was delicious!  Tangy but not vinegary!  Lemony!  The rice was not overcooked, the chow mein was excellent as was the beef and snow peas!  Really pleased, the best in Etobicoke so far by far!!!  Well worth it!  I will be back!"}
{"text":"Hmmm can't believe how this place is still running?? Rice tasted plasticy and yes huge portions but what's the point when it doesn't taste anything like Chinese food"}
{"text":"This is the best Chinese food in West Toronto. The dishes are delicious, made with fresh veggies and great portions.  The owner is outstanding and really cares about delivering quality food."}
