{"text":"I had an amazing experience at the Anchorbar Square One location. My husband and 2 kids and I were greeted the minute we walked into the door by some kind hostesses. We then had a lovely server who consistently checked up on us and was so friendly. The food was amazing. My kids ordered from the kids menu and my husband got a single order of wings and I got the mac and cheese burger. All of it was delicious. We also ordered the dulce de leche cheesecake as it comes from the cheesecake factory. I was so thrilled to see that I didn't have to go all the way to Yorkdale mall or Buffalo to get some delicious Cheesecake. Staff was amazing, manager came to introduce herself, and overall an amazing experience. Anchorbar, we will be back!"}
{"text":"The curse of 10 Kingsbridge Garden Circle.  Living across the street for 12 years, we have seen eateries come and go from this location since Crocodile Rock unfortunately closed.   People would line up out the door to get into this place - there was life!
Since then, there have been 2 other restaurants/bars that have attempted to occupy this space but have failed due to out-pricing themselves in a  middle class and blue collar area.

Dear Anchor Bar: 
I plead with you to change some of your ways so that I can come over and watch a sports game with some beer and wings.  
My fiance and I came in opening weekend.  We were greeted and sat down in the bar area.  My fiance had the Single portion (8 wings) and I had the chicken tenders with fries.  First off both these dishes were the same price. I don't know why my fiance's wings didn't come with fries.  I find it hard to justify spending $15.99 on just 8 wings.  The other point to bring up is his plate came with only a sliver of celery.  No carrots.  Celery isn't that expensive, at least give him a stalk.  

There is no excuse for poor service on opening weekend (our food took 40 minutes to come out with only 12 tables seated in the entire restaurant).  
We briefly spoke with the owner about his ideas for the place.  He will have live entertainment and drink/food specials but not the wings.  Being a wing bar, you'd think you'd up your game from your competition. I don't know if you're aware, but there are over a handful of good wings bars that do offer discounted wing nights. 

1. You should have hit the ground running, had all of your staff trained and ready to go.  
2. Had a boatload of advertising.  You're right of Hurontario plus surrounded by at least 6 condos and local neighbourhoods. 
3. Your downfall will be relying on local regulars for your soft opening.  Especially when there are so many other options over the Highway in the Square One area. 

Sadly I drive by Anchorbar everyday coming home from work and late on weekends to see it dead empty.  I wish you all the best and hope you stay, but first impressions are everything."}
{"text":"Anchor Bar has newly opened in town. Having been to the buffalo NY  location ..I can say the wings are kept simple and tasty. .for my order I got a pound of wings in medium. . The wings tasted awesome and I would have ordered more had I  not  been trying out other spots across town to keep the variety flowing .
I saw other items on the menu but will stick with wings related combos for now. I'll be back sometime to order more wings."}
