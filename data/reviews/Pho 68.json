{"text":"We get their pho at least once a week. Everyone who works here is very friendly, especially the owner. Pho 68 also has the best pho broth in the east valley--I personally love #222 made spicy."}
{"text":"Excellent spot. Convenient location next to LeeLee's market, and this naturally ensures fresh ingredients in their food. For the money, this place never disappoints. Try the avocado tapioca smoothie!"}
{"text":"This place has really tasty food! But unfortunately I don't come here often because the prices are higher than normal Vietnamese restaurants in AZ and the portions also aren't that much. The owner is very nice and polite though. I would come more often but the portion to the price is not good for me unfortunately when I can find it just as good elsewhere. Definitely eat here though if u haven't already! Their Pho is Really good!!"}
{"text":"The service is so-so but they are good at what counts - the food.   I love their eggrolls and their fried rice is the best!"}
{"text":"The food deserves an A and should deserve a 5 star. The reason I gave it  3 star is because the price from the menu in front of the counter is different than the one from the menu for the customer. They try to charge you more (about 30 cents more per order) Therefore i gave them a 3 star instead."}
{"text":"I have tried several of their dishes, and this is an overall review.  Their beef with shrimp dish (#41) is amazing.  The meat is tender and not over cooked.  

I would not recommend the pho - the broth is lacking in flavor and complexity.  

The taro boba drinks are great if you like that type of stuff.  

I have also tried a noodle dish of theirs with meat and veggies, and it was good as well.

Overall, I would recommend this place if you stay away from the pho.  The server is very nice.  My bill always comes out correct, except once I think I was overcharged."}
{"text":"I love Pho's, the food is really wonderful and the owner is so nice. I am picky about my Vietnamese food and they have great spring rolls and noodle bowls. The atmosphere isn't all that great but it's all about the food to me and that is worth going for."}
{"text":"Trying to boost the reviews to this place. because this is by far one of the best pho places in the valley, that's if your looking for a clear broth with a little zip to it. i have been to a couple better pho places in Long Beach and New York, but for Arizona this one is the cream of the crop. The pho is tasty, the servers are friendly, and I enjoy the sometimes bizarre Vietnamese music videos that play in the back ground."}
{"text":"I have been going to Pho 68 for quite some time now, and I have tried many other Pho places in Phoenix and Mesa along the way and still I find myself putting them on the best Pho Place I've had that is in harmony to my taste buds. I love the broth seasoning and I don't add any extra flavors or siracha or hoison sauce at all! minus the Tripe (not a big fan of that but my parents loves it).  Their spring roll is yummy and definitely fresh (not chewy rice paper like I've had in some places) and my other favorite dish is the one with vermecilli noodles BBQ pork and Egg roll with fish sauce and everytime is consistent in everything."}
{"text":"Despite good food in a convenient location, a very unfortunate experience that I wish very much hadn't happened.

The food was good. The service acceptably friendly and quick. 
I ordered spring rolls and a noodle dish with beef.  I got egg rolls (fried) and the correct noodle dish. I also ordered a Thai hot coffee, which was ordinary, tasted like instant.

The sadness began when I got my bill. It seemed a bit high, that is, higher than the menu prices warranted. I did the math in my head. It didn't work out. My meal cost about $14 - high for noodles, egg rolls and coffee, amirite? - and the total I received, on an un-itemized bill, was almost $18, a shocking amount for 1 person's egg rolls, noodles and coffee.

I asked for assistance.  Nobody came.  I went to the counter and asked to speak to the manager. A man with a pony tail came to me. I explained I believed I was overcharged, and wanted to check it out.  He replied, \"The bill is correct,\" and began to walk away.  

Now I realized I was in the midst of a situation.  I replied, \"I don't think so.  May I see a menu please?\"  He didn't get me a menu despite 3 requests. He walked away from me twice, dawdling elsewhere, until I requested he come back. Suddenly everybody and everything else in the restaurant was more important than I was.

He wrote some numbers on my ticket. None of these numbers corresponded to the prices I saw on the menu; all were about $1 higher than menu prices. I mentioned this, and again I asked to see a menu. He did not provide a menu. Finally I grabbed one and opened it. He grimaced.

\"See the menu?  This is $4.28, this is $2.68 and this is $7.48,\" I said.  \"You overcharged me\".(by about $3). He never once agreed with nor denied what I was saying. He also did not offer to repay the difference. I had to demand he refund the money he overcharged me. It is my opinion that such behavior is several steps over the line into dishonesty.  He claimed what I ordered was different than what I had, and that those things (all) cost more. I pointed out another obvious fact: \"None of the prices you wrote on my ticket (after the fact) are anywhere to be found in your menu.\" He was making stuff up.

So I had to get loud and aggressive and say, \"What do I have to do to get you to refund the money you overcharged me? Call the police?\" He grabbed a dollar and some change from the till quickly and thrust them into my hands. This was still only about half the amount I was overcharged. 

Here are my tips for eating at Pho 68, if you must:
--Demand an itemized bill when you sit down.
--Check your tab against the menu if you must. 
--Contact staff for assistance before paying if there's a discrepancy.
--If there is a discrepancy, do not pay the bill until it has been addressed to your satisfaction, and a correct bill rendered."}
{"text":"I have never been disappointed with the quality of their pho.  They have always been consistent with their broth, it has depth in flavor.  The portion served is very filling.  Although the restaurant is not the prettiest, taste in my opinion is what really matters."}
{"text":"In short, I would never, ever drive from Phoenix for this. Really mediocre service and quality compared to Pho Thanh. 

Actually, really disappointing for being a part of this Vietnamese plaza of things. I'd rather just go to the dim sum or have Lee's sandwiches, despite a major pho craving."}
{"text":"walked in, got seated the table was still dirty/oily/sticky. Smelled like a mixture of cleaning products and old fish. My daughter was getting ill due to the smell so we left. Didnt order, and never will. We were really looking forward to a good bowl of pho. It was disappointing."}
{"text":"Completely rude!! I don't know if the guy that helped was just having a bad day or what. Never had I received that kind of service at any pho place. Will definitely NEVER go back!!! Didn't even mind paying for an appetizer I didn't even eat. 
Someone needs to learn how to conduct business. They surely have lost about 25 customers I normally take them... 

Had to give them one star just because I had to write a review.  Sadly they are just around  the corner from my house. But thankfully there's a couple more within 2 miles from me."}
{"text":"This place is not close!  Had lunch here I ordered Pho Ga and shrimp spring roll with peanut sauce. This place is not fancy. I just know that when I come here I know the food is good and the service is good. Some staff I believe does not speak good english, but dont worry their menu is simple. Read and point on the want you want to order and Bam! Delicious Pho coming your way...try this place its pretty good."}
{"text":"I stopped in because Pho Van is closed on Wednesdays. Very good portions, but was not blown away by the broth. Im a broth guy. Service was very good and the space is good. In the end, not bad...but not great."}
{"text":"This is our second here. I like this place. Place is ok small and looks pretty clean. I would recommended this place to my friends. Good customer service. Food is always good just like the first time I was here. Getting something different just to change the game up lol. Food porn!"}
{"text":"Really nice counter service for our to-go order, got a hodge podge of their menu.  Both spring and crispy rolls, a rice dish and a wonton pho soup.

The rice dish was charbroiled pork plus shrimp which were pretty small and sort of dried out looking (flash deep fried?).  They gave you romaine lettuce as the veggie accompanied instead of the typical picked veg, which was disappointing.

The different rolls came w/ 3 each which was nice surpise over the typical 2, spring roll was better than the crispy.  Pho was ok.  

Total $29, a little pricey though conveniently located to do shopping in LeeLee's afterwards."}
{"text":"I would be shocked if I don't get food poisoning after what I ate today. I took one bite of a fresh spring roll and it was obvious the meat was rancid. Never going there again!!"}
{"text":"I've been going to Pho 68 for at least four years now. Some long time ago, after shopping at Lee Lee's, I asked one of the people at the register which Vietnamese place they'd recommend. After some halting conversation, I got that while some of the other Vietnamese restaurants around may seem more popular, Pho 68 has been there the longest. So I tried it. Very glad I did.

The food is good and reliable. Their pho and pho ga is always spot on. My husband says that their egg rolls are the best he's ever had, anywhere. Their appetizers are well-sized and tasty. I've had nearly all of them, so it's hard to talk about any specific one.

They've upped their presentation in the last 6-8 months, which I like. Okay, small caveat - I've only ever gotten my food to-go. I prefer to eat at home, lazing in front of the TV, in my comfy recliner. 

The owner (I think... the kind gent who's always working the counter) is a great guy. He knows me by my voice over the phone, he remembers our conversations, and he actually seems to _care_ about me, which I find charming and most welcome. If I ask for food recommendations, he gives them happily, and tries to guide me towards what I'll like best (not what he thinks I'll like best).

The only thing I wish for occasionally is a larger menu selection. The Vietnamese restaurant a few doors down is a little fancier inside and has more things on the menu (beef short ribs, bahn xeo, some super tasty beef stew like thing, etc...). I think next time I go to Pho 68, I'll ask if they plan to expand their menu. The owner/counter guy is definitely cool enough that I feel comfortable asking.

While yes, there are a few things I'd like to see improve (okay, mostly just the menu offerings), this place has been consistently good for over four years that I'm quite confident in giving a 5-star rating.

Get thee to Pho 68!"}
{"text":"I really like this place a lot! Every time we eat here we always try something different and we've never been disappointed. The atmosphere is casual, yet inviting. The staff is very attentive and nice. I highly recommend trying this place out, especially if you're feeling bored with other kinds of food or feeling adventurous!"}
{"text":"Take out today.  Ordered one Chicken and one Beef Pho, along with spring rolls.  My soup was not what I'm used too.  The broth was not so good.  The take out container curiously didn't include any hoisin etc...  Only a watered down peanut sauce.  Just kind of disapointed as I was truly looking forward to some food."}
{"text":"It's good. Little bit on the oily side for the pho. Good broth though. Okay priced."}
{"text":"This place was nicely decoratated and we were greeted by the friendly waiter/cashier. We were the only ones there. I am Vietnamese and let me tell you, they had the worst non-authentic pho I have ever had....ever! There was no authentic aroma....that smell every authentic bowl of pho has. My husband, who is white, said \"this taste just like chicken broth\" and thats what it really was, chicken broth!!! I almost wanted to ask if they accidently put the wrong soup broth in our bowls it was so bad. we were so disappointed and it was pretty pricey. I now know why Asians don't come here."}
{"text":"My family and I decided to stop by after about an eight year hiatus. 


As I mentioned, we haven't been back to this place since about eight years ago.  The place has changed a lot.  I don't usually care about decor, as long as the place is clean and the food is good.  This place has an interesting vibe.  

The pho is pretty tasty.  The noodles I was served was a little al-dente-ish.  The portions were appropriate with the price. I really liked the broth. It tasted healthier because it wasn't nearly as salty and oily as some places I've tried.

The utensils were clean. At first glance, I thought I was going to hate the metal soup spoons, but they actually worked better than the thicker ones most fancier pho joints use.


I'm still upset at Pho Saigon for taking their \"Beef Stew (egg noodle) Soup\" off the menu, so I might be going here for a while until I find a spot that serves it. Please message me if you know a place that has it."}
{"text":"My wife and I eat here regularly - usually once per week - and we have always enjoyed it. Their spring rolls (#2) are always fresh and tasty. My wife likes the spicy noodle soup, and I enjoy the rice noodles with pork and shrimp (#31 to #33). The owner/operators are always friendly, courteous, and helpful. And the food is fresh, tasty, delicious, and healthy. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I'm not crazy about Pho. I've had it. It's
ok when it's cold outside but I'm more of 
a bun kinda guy. I do love it when Vietnamese 
restaurants get creative with the names though. 
Pholicious. Unphogettable. There's even a place 
in San Diego called Pho King. Somebody was 
clueless when that business name was being 
registered. Pho is pronounced fuh. But all that 
is neither here nor there because I come to this 
Vietnamese joint attached to Lee Lee's Supermarket 
for their varieties of bun cha. Google \"Bun Cha 
Obsession\" on the internets. Go ahead. I'm not 
that bad a case of OCD but I have cravings for it 
every so often. This is my favorite place near my 
workplace that has the Saigon style bun cha. They 
put it all in one bowl and you mix it up with 
fish sauce and hot sauce to taste. Different types 
of meat depending on which dish you chose but they're 
all about the same price. Service is usually decent
but sometimes can be slow depending on how crowded 
it is. They have a TV that usually blasts some 
Vietnamese pop music show. Parking is plentiful
as it is in the Lee Lee's mall."}
{"text":"My visit on Saturday afternoon was probably my third or fourth time to have eaten at this restaurant.  The food is good -- Pho broth is flavorful and fragrant.  The ponytailed gentleman has been in attendance every single time I've been in.  He is cordial but quiet.  My biggest caveat is not about the food or the service (service is very average).  I had suspected this before, but after having read similar concerns I now realize I wasn't crazy.  They routinely overcharge you here.  I paid close attention to the prices of what I ordered  -- 2 bowls of Pho, $7.28 each.  One spring roll appetizer, $4.28.  One soda ($2 maybe?)  My little charge slip says my total was $26.75.  My math tells me that's about $6 more than it should have been, even adding tax in.  This is unnaceptable.  I did not say anything - paid my bill and left a $5 tip.  Consider yourself warned."}
{"text":"I've had some wonderful meals here before, but they've been closed the last two times I've visited. 

They're closed today despite Google's listing having them open today. I will try one more time before assuming they are permanently closed."}
{"text":"This place is authentic Vietnamese! I will not lie about that, but the last couple of times they have chosen very bad pieces of meat in our dishes... It is quite disappointing."}
{"text":"As soon as I stepped out of my car to go into the place, a gentleman who worked there stepped out and was throwing rice on the ground for a huge gathering of pigeons. Yeah. Kinda annoying while I'm trying to go INSIDE to eat. I almost said something about how \"rice makes birds explode and how I just got my car washed and would not any bird poop on it, thank you\", but decided not to. Maybe the food is good..

Gentleman who was feeding the birds went inside and sat me at a table. Interesting enough, I see a door that connects to the Lee Lee's supermarket next door. Interesting. The waitress was extra nice in helping me decide what noodles were good and checked on me when my food arrived. Hmmm...that's good..considering that's something that rarely happens at pho joints. :)

Broth was a bit bland and oiler than I expected. Decor could have used more than 1 flatscreen tv for that huge dining area. Maybe just felt empty because I was the only customer at the time.

Beef pho noodle was around $7.50 and vietnamese iced coffee around $3.. pretty average price for Arizona pho. 

I still like Pho Van more (other pho place in the same shopping center), it feels more cozy there, and the menu has a lot more variety of rice platters, vermicelli, soups and drinks there.

OK food here, just not truly blown away.."}
{"text":"I was really craving some good pho on saturday and so my friend and I decided to try a place we'd never been before. We came here and while service and staff were great, the food was... lacking.

I am a huge pho fan, and was really surprised to see black pepper sprinkled on top of my food when I arrived. Then I tried the broth, it was like no pho broth I'd ever tasted before: it was bland and made me go \"what?\" With every bite I took, I kept hoping it would taste better, but alas, it was just as disappointing every time.

The reason for the lonely little star though? I love tripe in my pho. Love, love, love it. There was only a single piece, and it wasn't cleaned very well at all. I took a bite and immediately tasted everything you should not be tasting when eating tripe and thought I would vomit right there at the table.

I will definitely not be going back here. There is another pho place in the plaza which is a million times better, go there instead."}
{"text":"I understand that pho restaurants are usually not fancy but this place is pretty ghetto.  We were greeted by a Caucasian waiter and led to a table right next to the glass window overlooking the customers at Lee Lee's market.  It was pretty dark inside with only 5 customers on a Saturday night.

*Decor = dark, casual, no privacy...it's almost like eating in a food court.
*Price = on the high end for pho
*Service = the bare minimum
*Food:
-Spring rolls = ok....but it was mostly lettuce
-Rice dish with pork bbq = ok...but portions wise, not much
-Pho = the soup is VERY bland"}
{"text":"I have been eating pho for 25 years.  This is where I go in Phoenix for pho.  Clean broth taste with no msg.  Try the shrimp and pork loin dish in a pot with extra sauce for something different."}
{"text":"I get a cold quite often, and like most of you, I turn into a useless, slow, bathrobe-wearing, mucus-y whiny bitch. I can't think, I can't speak and I sure as hell can't assemble food together but I feel like I am dying and I demand food furiously.

No? Just me? Alright. I apologize

I knew I needed Pho. Only pho could take care of my cold-inflected grumpiness, my sore and phlegmy throat, my permanent frown on my face. Looking around Yelp, Pho 68 was the only one within a 2-3 block drive and that had decent reviews. I quickly call them, asking for a menu. They don't have one on their website (or I think they don't have a website at all), but they email me a soft copy. Oh Glory, the menu at my finger tips. I call them back immediately with my order and tell them I'm on my way.

I somehow manage to put on (what looks like) outside appropriate clothes and drive to Pho68. The gentleman at the counter explains to be how to assemble it: the meats are all raw and the veggies are separated. Heat up the broth until it is super boiling hot and quickly dump the meat in, followed by the noodles and veggies. Then, as I always do, dump 4-5 limes worth of juice to cut the fat in the broth and give it flavor. Then I dump everything in a serving bowl (you know, those huge ones that they usually use for decoration in your house) and I sit in front of the TV.

I may look like a small person, but I consumed what looked like a serving dish for 6 people in one sitting. The broth was BURSTING with flavor, the meat was tender (brisket ,meatball and eye round steak) and the veggies were crispy and fresh. Its not the best Pho in the world, but it definitely hit the spot, was high in quality and super affordable (about $7.50 for the large). I loved their customer service, their speed and their friendliness. Really, when you're that sick and moody, you become a hard person to satisfy. 

I was satisfied. I held my tummy full of pho and I took a nice, coma-induced nap."}
{"text":"Like Pho Nat in Tempe, this place used to be in business because of their convenient location, next to Lee Lee.  

As of some time middle of last year, I guess either there is a new boss or chef, but right now this is my go to place for Vietnamese Pho if I am in Chandler area.  Used to be Saigon down the road but that place is not consistent with their pho taste and portion, also they have too much msg-like things in them that you know is msg, cause U are swallowing gallons of water after U finish a bowl of pho at Saigon.  Okay back to this place, back when we were students and before Mekong open, Lee Lee is a weekend carpool thing with friends for groceries and then maybe some asian food.  So I am sure this is the same for any poor student that don't drive or drive a student car, your options are pretty limited, and you will have made the mistake of visiting Pho 68 like 3-5 years ago or earlier.  Chances are you will not go back again because the soup is bland, artifically sweet due to a lot of msg and the color of cloudy water with a few slices of meat.  

But like I mentioned, as of last year, a friend tipped us off on the change in chef or boss there and the pho is very good.  so, we trust our friend and she was right :)  She may not be vietnamese but she is in the food industry and shes right that it has come 180 from before.  So come here and order the Pho, with spring rolls and an ice coffee.  U will like it, your stomach will thank u for it and when you are done, go thru the sidedoor to lee lee and go buy some groceries that are foreign and whose name you cannot pronounce, but still are tempted to try anyway :)  Oh, the boss here is very laid back and friendly and will recognize u if he sees U for a second time that same week.  He is usually a one man operation and can be a little slow, but don't fret, its gonna get here, just keep your eyes on the tv in the middle and be confused at what they are singing about :)  Most of the soup noodles are pretty decent, I had tried several different ones, the regular pho, seafood broth ones, tomatoe broth one and the spicy hue style ones.  I don't know if the rice plates are good, but the spring rolls are decent too.  

So if u are in chandler and craving pho, u know where to go :)  let me know if u know of any place better, i am always interested to try ;)"}
{"text":"Well I thought that their spicy beef soup would be good, and it was except the beef was mostly fat and grizzle,  too bad, I had high hopes for this place"}
{"text":"I don't understand why the reviews are as low as they are here. I have never had anything bad here and have never been screwed by any pricing mistakes before. I've never seen someone working there with a cold sore and I thought the prices were a little higher than your typical fast food combo. I'm a regular here, they remember what I order, and my friends have raved about the food.

I have two gripes though. One is that they need more vegetarian options or make the yuba wrapped shrimp as a main dish. The second is when you order a soda and you only get a can. I would rather pay extra and get free refills. 

Sorry haters, I love this place. If I'm not having some bun here, I'm sneaking over for some boba, going for Chinese food, or shopping at Lee Lee's."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place for the food and service! The owners are such sweet people and know us by name because we frequent the spot often! Pho broth is difficult to satisfy every palate but for me it's just right. I love the meat portions in the pho because most Vietnamese pho shops are quite frugal with meat portions. I also love their combination rice plate with pork, egg cake, shredded pork, and fried shrimp cake...Super stuffing! Their spring rolls and peaknut sauce are stellar. I think I come here often because I walk out feeling appreciated. Sounds silly but makes a huge difference when there is so much competition! its a great mom and pops shop that deserves some appreciation. You have other yelpers talking about the broth being bland but it's better than being overdone! That's why we add spices and sauces to make it just right!"}
{"text":"I really don't understand the negative reviews for this place. I've had nothing but good experiences here and the pho is probably the best that I have found in the valley. It's not as good as the pho I've had in San Jose or Portland, but it's definitely close.

Also, they serve it with the correct sauces, which not everyone in the valley does, which is a huge turn off for me.  You should get sriracha, chili paste, and hoisin, along with a dish to mix them in and dip in to.  All you people who pour sriracha into your broth are ruining the best part of pho which is the delicate aroma and flavor of the broth.

The only bad thing I can say about this place is that the Vietnamese singing on the TV can get annoying after awhile, but this hardly changes how good the food is."}
{"text":"I usually go to the other pho place in this complex but I've been to Pho 68 twice now & I think it's my new favorite. The service is incredible, and they offer a 'large' pho which I love because I really like a lot of broth. 

Also, I don't use the sprouts/basil & instead use onions & cilantro (& I like A LOT of both) & they brought out an entire plate (other places I have to practically beg for extra onions/cilantro). 

Love the decor & the Asian performances on the tv too. This place is a winner. I will be back regularly."}
{"text":"Great pho soup and spring rolls and great service but interesting smell in the front reception area, possibly from the market next door?"}
{"text":"Very nice place! I've been there a few times now and the service has always been nice and food has been amazing. Our server was very friendly and helped us decide what we wanted to order and suggested his most popular dishes. Reasonably priced and a very good experience."}
{"text":"First time ...recommended by a friend. Wanted spicy seafood pho....could not find it on the menu. My waiter said they would fix me up. He said they have a lot of favorites not listed on the menu....so tell them what you like and they'll probably accommodate . The service was awesome and friendly... The seafood pho was off the hook! Seafood humor.....mussels, shrimp,squid very fresh. Two kinds of noodles in a med spicy broth. Plenty of condiments to season to your liking. 
This place is attached to Lee Lee Asian market. If you have never been there, you may be surprised by the fishy smell that comes from the live aquarium they have in the butcher dept. You get used to it after awhile....but it does bother some folk. NOT ME! I'll be back to PHO 68! Recommend ."}
{"text":"Try this place for a fun experience!

Walking in, they make it a point to greet you and seat you right away. The staff is super friendly and helpful! If it's busy, they have a cute lil' waiting area at the front. You can't help but take in the amusing decors of this place- it feels like you're in the jungle or somewhere exotic surrounded by lots of bamboo trees & plants. Watching the Vietnamese music videos on their flat screen is pretty entertaining- if not a great conversation starter.
 
Depending on the time and day, like any other popular location, lunch may take some time. Don't be afraid to ask for recommendations if you're not sure what to order. I really enjoy their Pho and they have many varieties to choose from. The broth is yummy and they don't skim on the meat. You have the option of having a small bowl or a big one. Even if you're hungry, a small bowl is more than enough food. 

Aside from Pho, they have a great menu selection of food to choose from. Everything is pretty much delicious! Be adventurous and try something new! ;) Their price is also very reasonable compared to other Vietnamese restaurant. The friends I bring here enjoy it a lot as well."}
{"text":"After the Mekong visit and my patience worn completely thin I decided to go somewhere where the wait wasnt an hour. So headed to LeeLee and decided to try the attached restaurant there. Whats funny is I passed 6 other Pho places along Dobson on my way.. it was a sign! 

Being in the mood for beef stew, I was told #48 was beef stew. So, ordered that to go. When I got it home I was shocked to see that it was pan cooked beef chunks with onions and sauce served over the top of lettuce and tomatoes. I was like fuck, that's gross! Well, I had to take a bite, then another, then another, then another.. it was really good! Not the Bo Ko I was craving but tasty none the less. The lettuce had wilted and was similar to a stew cause of all the moisture that was released.. a very good dish!

Ill have to go back to try the pho.. though with all the other pho options I think a tour is in order.. anyone wanna do a Dobson pho tour?"}
{"text":"We enjoyed eating hear the staff was pleasant the the food very good. They have closed. The new ownership is Nam Pho."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now and I don't understand the poor reviews. Both times my server has been fantastic. Without even looking at the menu, I ordered the seafood soup and asked for no crab meat. \"No problem.\" was the reply. I asked him if it came with egg noodles or the rice noodles. He said, \"You tell me what you want, and we'll make it happen.\" So I had the seafood noodle soup with the wide, flat, rice noodles and honestly, it was some of the best I've had in town. My partner got charbroiled pork over noodles the first time, and there were zero complaints. She got beef soup with the brisket the second time and all I kept hearing was how f*cking good the soup was! I've had Vietnamese food all over Phoenix, Tucson, Hawaii and Southeast Asia and this ranks with some of the best, at least as far as the soups go. We manage to get out of there for around $20 for the 2 of us, which is pretty average, so i'm not sure what all the griping about the prices is about. The staff is friendly, the food is good, the prices are good, and it's right next to LeeLee's so you can jump over and grab some Asian groceries, and the Boba Tea House."}
{"text":"I love this place! My friends and I have been going here for a few years now, and I never tire of it. The owners are incredibly nice, going so far as to make special dishes just to cater to my diet restrictions. I haven't found better Vietnamese food any where else, it's truly tasty. :d"}
{"text":"The service was great here. Every time we come, there's about 30 of us and they still get us our food in a timely manner.

The pho and vermicelli that I eat every time were ok. Nothing special but if you are in the neighborhood, you can stop by. Although there's another pho place in the same plaza. The pho soup there has intense flavors. Both are the same price just about.

Come here for the fast and warm service, not the food."}
{"text":"The environment is great (except for the biggest turn off - the incense smell).  Food is OK with good presentation."}
{"text":"Eh, nothing to rave about. Decent pho but Pho Van is better."}
{"text":"Wow - I have never been disappointed with the quality of their food and we eat here alot. The service is incredible and you are usually greeted by the owner or his wife. We would rate this as above average taste, with excellent price, parking, service - and very kid friendly, lemonade, smoothies/boba too. It is inside Lee Lee market and can smell like Lee Lee, however, it is always clean and food is presented well."}
{"text":"The food at Pho 68 is great!  Probably better than the other vietnamese place next door which I gave 5 stars.  The reason Pho 68 doesn't get 5 stars is because of ambience and service which are not as good."}
{"text":"Best Vietnamese fresh rolls anywhere in Arizona! We always have the barbecued pork fresh rolls and they are very tasty and good. Their Pho is good too. The only thing that bothered us was the fishy smell creeping in from the adjacent asian grocery store called Lee-Lee's. But worth the trip...

By the way, we love just about every dish they make, especially #47, beef with vegetables and pan fried wide noodles."}
{"text":"Dont eat here! Doesnt even taste like pho here! Horrible service!  They say their vietnamese but their pho is definately not vietnamese pho! I took a bite out of it and i just wanted to throw up! They need money soo bad that they wont let us change for something else."}
{"text":"Every time I come to town for business I have to come here. The Pho and Bun Bo Hue are very good. The special fried rice is great! I enjoy the friendly staff and the good location. I have tried most of the other Pho locations around the area and this place is still the best."}

I've eaten here a few times over the years.  Mom and I don't really care for the summer rolls (fresh, not fried, rolls of shrimp, pork, lettuce, rice noodles, and sprouts).  The peanut sauce that accompanies the rolls is good, however.  The bowls of pho and a few stir-fried meat over rice dishes we've had here were good.  The last three visits, however, were mainly for the ever-so-tasty durian shakes!  

If you've never had durian, well, you're in for a ride of sensory overload!  Durian's scent for the uninitiated will most-likely be UNPLEASANT.  So overpowering is the durian's scent that many Asian countries ban its transport in public trains, planes, and automobiles.  Some hotels also will not allow patrons to store durian in their rooms!  Oh, but don't let its pungent smell deter you from trying it in shake-form!

I suggest you ask for a second plastic glass and share this w/ a friend... Trust me-- it's too rich a drink to finish all by yourself!"}
{"text":"I really, really like this place, but I'm a little sore at the right now. Not sore enough to really dock a star, but sore nonetheless. 

Came here with my girlfriend for a nice pho dinner. We sat down to order, and when it came time to ordering drinks they were out of pickled plum soda. No sweat, I'll have a smoothie... eeeeexcept that the machine is broken. So I ordered an orange juice, and wasn't particular surprised to find out that it was absolutely DELICIOUS! 

So, we both ordered the Dac Biet Pho, because we're unoriginal and we know what we like. Our two bowls came out, and it was some damned fine pho! Hearty and satisfying, with a really nice flavor and conspicuous blobs of beefy broth fat dancing merrily upon the surface. They were a LITTLE light on the meats, but that's never too surprising with Dac Biet Pho- usually they give you just a few pieces of each different sort of meat.

The service was great- very attentive and friendly. The convenience is hard to beat- come here for a big meal and then you won't feel so obligated to buy everything you see when you go shopping next door at Lee Lee. Next time I come I'll try something different, I promise! It's just SO hard, when pho is always such a perfect meal..."}
{"text":"I'm writing about the restaurant attached to Lee Lee's Oriental Market. There is another free-standing restaurant with the same name in the complex. 

The pho here is yummy and the prices reasonable. Really hit the spot when I was craving pho. Even better, they also serve boba here. I went with my husband and sister. We got avocado, taro and custard fruit boba. All good. 

The only down side...we ordered fresh spring rolls and they served them with vinegar instead of peanut sauce. No worries though, we got peanut sauce as soon as we asked for it."}
{"text":"#44 is awesome.  I come here for that every time.  It is s metal bowl with rice around the inside and cooked to be crispy.  Then they add a stir fry meat and veg on top of that.  If is very good. I think the thing that makes it better than most is the sauce. I would normally call it a white sauce similar to Moo Goo Gi Pan, but it is lighter than that. I'm not sure what the 68 means but I'm guessing it's because it's not as good as 69"}
{"text":"Try no.22! It's been a while, I came back & the flavors still awesome!"}
{"text":"If you come here, try to get a table by the TV so you can watch the pretty Vietnamese women sing Vietnamese songs. I found it very cultural, cool and interesting! At least it wasn't kareoke (thank goodness!)... 

Me and my mom came in at the right time. It wasn't too busy in the afternoon. Service was great. Ordered their spring rolls - I thought they were going to be deep fried, but the ones they brought out were the fresh, soft kind that had veggies, shrimp and bbq pork, served with a peanut butter sauce. I was pleasantly surprised by how good it was. They were to die for!! 

The pho was good - perfectly portioned. I finished the whole thing! I was kind of surprised that they served the soup in smaller portions. Normally at other pho places, I can barely finish my bowl. Maybe it's because I'm used to restaurants that serve \"American\" sized portions...

Otherwise I had a good first experience and would come back again!"}
{"text":"Food was good and service was pretty quick. Would recommend giving it a try."}
{"text":"Apparently, I'm crazy... but I think Pho68 has delicious broth. It's fragrant and clean, not oily. The owner knows me, my fiancé and even my work buddies that I've converted from pho-confused to pho-lovers. The service is fun and friendly. The food is worth, at LEAST four \"nom\"s when verbalized.

A Vietnamese food n00b friend of mine is gluten-intolerant and they made huge strides to guarantee her food was safe. She didn't feel yucky after the meal and thought it was delicious. 

Granted, it takes a little while to get the food out but you have to take into consideration the amount staff working, never seems like more than 3 or 4 people. Just take a long lunch and let it... simmer in... how awesome their food is."}
{"text":"Your waitress took an accusatory tone and was rude with us when she screwed up our order, even after we tried to behave in a polite and understanding way with her when she did, and all you could do as manager was reinforce her negative behavior with similar behavior of your own when I brought this to your attention. If she can't behave professionally, why the hell is she waiting tables there in the first place? By the way, I was there earlier on other days and was the only customer and she had the same attitude, like she didn't want to be bothered doing her job then too. Guess seeing your attitude allowing this shit I can see why."}
{"text":"The ponytail guy who runs this place seems totally cool and you get the feeling that this place is totally white friendly. When you order though, you realize it is past white friendly and any self respecting Vietnamese person would be ashamed by this place. 

My nem nuong quon was brought by some cold sore yielding individual who overcharged me by about 50 cents for my rolls, and the \"nice\" guy who seemed like he owned the restaurant acted like a dick when I ordered."}
{"text":"I ate here because the other restaurant in the complex was closed (I always seem to forget that Pho Van is closed on Wednesday).

My Experience:

Walked in to a funky smell.. decided to risk eating here despite the fishy stench.

Seated. Water Delivered.. at this time my wife and I knew what we wanted, so we ordered. Wife gets chicken pho.. I order the Bun Bo Hue, and our waiter tells me they are out of pork blood. We also order spring rolls.

5 minutes later another couple is seated near us. Their order is taken.

5 minutes later that other couple gets their food delivered.

5 minutes later, our food is delivered! 

I find it odd that the other couple received their food before my wife and I. The quality of meat in my soup was questionable (color of the meat not what I have experienced before..almost a greenish color). The broth was decent though. My wife liked her pho, but mentioned that it was not as good as our other 2 preferred soup spots.

-1 for the smell
-1 for playing favorites
-1 for weird meat"}
{"text":"Excellent Pho!  I had a small chicken with rice noodles, and the broth was delicious.  Very filling.  My friend had an upset stomach when we got there, and the waitress brought her sliced ginger without even being asked.  Great customer service!  I will be back!"}
{"text":"The best Pho in PHX, hands down!

The owners are super nice and  totally amenable to subsitutions and changes. I love it!"}
{"text":"After spending a few hours perusing the aisles of Lee Lee, I decided to stop into the attached restaurant for a quick bite.

They give you A TON of food, and will tailor dishes to your liking. But I didn't feel like the food had much flavor. Everything was on the bland side. 

I have, other, favorites spots for PHO/Vietnamese in the East Valley (and we have some GREAT spots)...The owner was super accommodating, which is why I am little sad writing this review."}
{"text":"The service was terrible. The manager was boorish. We highly not recommend this place for any vegan/ vegetarian  friends"}
{"text":"I love the pho here, very good and satisfying. The portions were enough for 2 meals for myself. I would give them 5 stars but I have gone there to get some Pho a few times and they were closed when it was stated they were open on Google."}
{"text":"Dear Owner, why did you stop at 68? I suggest you adding one more number.  As we all know, the pho business is quite competitive, especially in this Asian mecca of town.  Survive on cheesy and perverted marketing, I say! ;-)

Please redeem yourself, it's just embarrassing! Restore honor in the name of the Pho# community, which extends all the way to SoCal.  

It was this 2-star recipe that I observed:

1) Adding a dash of Black Pepper before my pho bowl arrives. Who does that? Trust me, nobody in my pho eating career have I seen this.  You either: a) believed your broth lacked flavors b) thought it was cool and tried to be different? If needed, we can use the shakers that was already sitting on the table. Clearly, a Pho Faux Pas.

It threw everything off.  Slurp after slurp was quite painful.  The identity of the broth was more evident once I added the hoisin and siracha: bland-ish.  Hence the BP? *face palm*

2) Empty Tables and Chairs.  Clearly, this was a dead giveaway but I was semi hopeful that the Pho Gods would bring me good tasting fortunes on this great Sunday afternoon. *face palm*

3) SERVICE was so SLOOOOW, I thought at several points TIME itself had STOPPED.  In comparison to some legendary Viet places I know, I get my cup of water the second I sit down or atleast within reasonable time.  10 minutes before taking order, 10 more minutes for beverage to arrive. *face palm*

If you are truly a Pho place, it shouldn't take you more than 10 minutes to deliver a bowl of Pho.  In fact, the vegetables took just as long to come out.  The anti-freshness did not help either! You would think being directly linked to an Asian Grocery would help in that regard.  *face palm*

No excuse for slowness when the place is half full.

Another thing, please invest in better Rooster and Hoisin sauces, not your mysterious, generic bottle.  *face palm*

All of this face palming has caused my face to go numb! The only way I would return is if a ONE was added to the restaurant number.  By then I would expect an enhancement in the food and possibly a scandalous atmosphere. ;-)

Sorry, not worth the 7 bones and something cents.  For now on, I will decide whether to risk my appetite by Factor #2. Sigh. Heed. Epic Fail. The End."}
{"text":"Went there yesterday for lunch, and it was pretty tasty! I got the #22, and my god, it was SO HUGE I really couldn't finish it even though I wanted to. My only complaint was that we had to wait around a while for the check, but the place was pretty busy as it was lunchtime. Didn't see any dirty people, no cold sores, no price mishaps - just a tasty lunch that took a little longer than usual."}
{"text":"Words can't explain how great I think their food is. It's small and maybe not the best location, but they make up for everything else in their food."}
{"text":"I want to give Pho 68  all 5 stars. I really do. But with Pho seemingly the hot thing in the Chandler area, I just can't. It's got a lot of competition, and most of it's far better. Which is odd, because when you look at the clientele you'd expect Pho 68 to be the best there is....most of the people eating there are Asian, as opposed to places like Cyclo where the clientele is mostly people who wish they were in Scottsdale. But I digress...

Here's the deal: I've been to Pho 68 about 5 times. It's connected to Lee Lee Asian Market, and used to have a different name. They completely rebranded a few months ago, I think to try to take advantage of that Pho boom I mentioned earlier. They went from being kind of dingy and dirty looking and having stark white walls to having rich red and gold tones, black furniture, and fake bamboo plants skirting the dining area. The cosmetic changes were very welcome. One of the things that kept me away before they made the switch was the nagging fear that if the dining area looked that wretched the kitchen was probably bad beyond comprehension.

Anyhow, my husband loves Pho (we're talking we eat Vietnamese food 3 times a week most weeks), and he always wants to go to Pho 68. Usually we get Pho to Go, but this time we decided to dine in with another guest and our 9 month old. 

First, we had to ask for a high chair. This should be standard, I'd think, to offer to a couple with a young child. 

Second, they seated us and as soon as I was sitting down, I was overcome with a horrid smell. Mind you, I hate fish and the place REEKS of fish upon entry, but this smelled like urine. I came to realize it must have been ammonia from cleaning, but it should not be that strong. 

The waiter came to get our order, but we told him we were waiting for the last member of our party. Well, a few other tables were seated and then our final member showed. Annnnd...we waited a good 10 more minutes for him to come get our order. He was not so busy that it should have taken that long. And after we ordered,  we noticed another table had to go ask someone to take their order after waiting without so much as glasses of water for over 10 minutes. 

Once he took our order, it was 10 more minutes before I got my soda. And then our spring rolls came out 5 minutes later, followed almost immediately by our main courses. 

I ordered tofu stir fry with rice noodles. Let me stip for a minute and point something out: this meal was nowhere on the menu.  Nor were the tofu spring rolls we ordered. They make them, but they do not include them on the menu. I found that odd. Regardless, the spring rolls were fabulous and very large, and the peanut dipping sauce was yummy. The stir fry was also good, although I would have preferred more veggies and less noodles, as well as less pepper. 

My husband ordered some Pho with beef, and he loved it. Our other dining guest ordered chicken soup, and she said it was quite good. 

If you're ordering Pho soup, there are 2 sizes, which is a nice feature. And most of the meals are $6-9, which is less expensive that some other places. All told, our bill was $28 before tip, which was not bad for 3 people. 

The bad news for me with Pho 68, in addition to the wait and the smell, always comes about 15 minutes after I leave. For some reason, the food never fails to leave me with a gurgly belly. It's this that brings it from what would be 3.5 stars to just 3. And with Anise across the street, Cyclo 2 miles south, and a new place opening on the same corner as Pho 68, they need to step up their game....painting the walls alone won't cut it."}
