{"text":"This place is easily my favourite pizza place in Toronto. We're talking New York-style, gooey cheese, flavourful sauce, crispy yet chewy crust, and fresh toppings. Great quality and superb service."}
{"text":"The pizza here has just gotten better (when they first opened the dough and sauce was a little bland but it's still pizza yanno) and they still have awesome prices.  Every time we go here the pizza tastes better, and their homemade sauces are AWESOME. Ask for extra, for sure."}
{"text":"Simply good food. Very good clean pizza, I recommend the chicken tikka. Good fried chicken, good drink selection, good biryani, great prices, good burgers too... Just a very good place! Enough said!"}
{"text":"Came here around noon and it wasn't busy. It has seating and the service is good. Everything is pretty much average at this place. Average tastes and average prices."}
{"text":"We love this place. It's a 5 minute walk so it's always nice and hot when we get it home. Never had delivery so I can't comment on that. We usually get the medium pizza any 3 topping special or the chicken & fries. Always good, never a complaint. They also have a few tables so you can eat in if you like."}
{"text":"I recently checked this place out. We got the large pizza deal with wings and garlic bread. The pizza and wings were very good, the garlic bread wasn't too exciting.  It's a small family business so it's better to pick up than get delivery. They are very affordable and give you bang for your buck. I will be back."}
{"text":"I'll leave notes from my experience so others can learn from my misfortune.  I placed my delivery order over the phone. I had to lead the conversation (e.g. provide my phone number, ask for a price, ask to customize the combo etc.) because the person on the other line did not know what to do.  I forgot to customize some things so I was given default items, e.g. Coke, without being contacted afterwards.  The driver got lost so he knocked on the door of a random business and asked *them* to call me. Very odd!  The delivery took 1 hour and 10 minutes to arrive. My apartment is a 12 minute walk away. Everything was cold.  The pineapple on my family's pizza was so expired that it tasted like alchohol.  The crust was hard and chewy. Completely inedible.  They have two types of dip: garlic and house-made garlic.  Cash only."}
