{"text":"First time in the Charlotte area so I wanted to try something local instead of a chain. The hostess walked us through the menu and was very helpful and welcoming. I picked the pulled pork platter with sides of sweet potato casserole and collard greens. My daughter had a side to spare so I had her select the banana pudding. All I can say is Wow! Everything tasted delicious! Not a big collard greens fan but heard these were to die for. Yep. They were. Sweet potato casserole was fresh out of the oven (hot!). Pork was tender and juicy although a might warm, not hot. Corn bread was awesome as well even though I prefer mine a little bit sweeter. Topped off with banana puddin' that was just like my moms used to make with a 'Nilla wafer on top. Sweet tea of course to wash it all down. I will definitely be going back there next time I cime around. Yum."}
{"text":"One of the best bbq places around!  I work in Matthews and this has become a favorite lunch spot for our office.  I order the smoked chicken sandwich, which always comes Bama style with slaw and their signature white sauce, and it's delicious!  The sides change daily but they always have banana pudding, it's different but I like it.  The jalapeno cheese grits are good and the mac and cheese was good but nothing special.  They have a great lunch special, a sandwich, side and drink for $8."}
{"text":"I went to a 4th of July party this year, and our hosts had this food that was really really good. We got the name of the place before we left, and it was Moe's BBQ. I was in the area so I decided to make a trip there. I picked up a large rib platter to go with corn bread and mac n' cheese and banana pudding as my sides. They didn't put excessive amounts of sauce on the ribs but provided an extra container of sauce, which I prefer. I'm also not a big melted cheese fan, but their mac n' cheese has the perfect amount of cheese. And the banana pudding was great too. I don't live super close to Moe's, but it was definitely worth the trip. I'll be back and will recommend to others!"}
{"text":"Well , I've been here twice , both times I got the BBQ sandwich, first time I didn't know they put pickles on it, that's all I could taste, so the next time I asked for no pickles , put it just didn't still taste good, it doesn't even taste like pork, beans had all kinds of things in it that I'm not sure should of been in it! Cornbread dry... Son got smoked wings...they didn't taste smoked and I thought they were not good, how they run out of food ... They maybe are just saying that . I will never ever go back."}
{"text":"Great BBQ!!!  Truly like that I grew up on in Alabama and Georgia!  The variety and quality of the sides add to the experience all the more.  I just wish they had the amazing peach cobbler everytime I visit!  It's as close to Grandma's as your going to get!  :-)"}
{"text":"This place serves small portions and charges for large portions. We tried it several times and won't go back."}
{"text":"Probably not the best place for those hardcore barbecue aficionados, but the food is very, very good! (Think Midwood Smokehouse, rather than Bill Spoons.) Of course, you can't go wrong with the pulled pork, but my two favorites are the brisket and the wings. Do not come to this place without trying the wings! Holy smoked, crispy goodness, they are good!!! The ribs are hit or miss, as another (overly harsh) reviewer noted - not my favorite. All of the sides are great and they have unique options to choose from every day. Lots of NC microbrews on tap as well. The staff are all very friendly and gracious, and the place is always clean. Give them a shot!"}
{"text":"Best BBQ around. Nice local beer selection too. Right in the heart of the little downtown Matthews area."}
{"text":"Hey, y'all!  Visiting NC and wanted some BBQ!  We tried the pulled pork, greens, ribs and butter beans.  So good!  The greens were good, but not the best I've had, a tad undercooked, everything else, very good! I'm stuffed.  Loved the Fat Tire Amber!"}
{"text":"They are open late on Sunday till 8 now! I had the pulled pork sandwich with baked beans and some banana pudding and it was all excellent. Pork was well seasoned and moist and the BBQ sauce was very good too. I recommend the home made chocolate chip cookies too."}
{"text":"Good luck getting what you want. I've been twice for turkey and they were out both times. The service here is slow and it appears that they're more interested in serving beer than BBQ."}
{"text":"This place is great. I love it! Its closer to Memphis style BBQ though and some native North Carolinans might not understand it as they are used to NC style BBQ.    For those of us from other places, with an appreciation for different types of BBQ, this place is fantastic!  The sides are the best.  I've had the baked beans, collards, sweet potato casserole, mac and cheese and its all delicious.   The BBQ is even better. Its got just the right amount of smokey flavor without that overpowering vinegar taste you get from most BBQ in this town.  The BBQ sauce is great too.  Service is extremely friendly and its just a comfortable place to hang out and have a meal.  Plus the prices are pretty good and the servings really fill you up. If you want some fantastic BBQ this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"This place is fabulous! By far the best bbq that I've had in a long time.  Great smoky flavor and not mushy like so many places.The jalape√±o cheese grits and Brunswick stew were equally delicious. Home run! We will be back!"}
{"text":"I rate this spot as the BEST BB-Q joint of the USA eastern hemisphere!!! Food was SUPERB!!! Every dish we tasted and I mean \"EVERY!\" dish scored 5 stars!!!. The service was also great from the waiter to the owner. So, if you are looking for good food and a hip atmosphere, you GOTTA check it out! !!"}
{"text":"A great fast-casual BBQ joint in the friendly and charming town of Matthews. Excellent BBQ for the price, tons of sides and craft beers to choose from. My only complaint would be the limited choices of sauces available. The vinegar-based sauce is fantastic but what if I'm in a ketchup or mustard-based kind of mood?"}
{"text":"OH WOW!!! This place was such a surprise!  We stopped in not expecting much. We had the BRISKET which were super moist and tender. My wife had the RIBS which were basically fall off the bone. The biggest surprise was that the service was exceptional, they were so nice and patient with us, and they had one of the best CRAFT BEER selections in the area.  We may have had a lot of questions, but they helped us out on everything, and check in on us.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great food and location. One of my favorite places to eat. The wings are awesome!"}
{"text":"Great food.   Wide variety of sides.  Good service.   Always a treat.  We got the chicken sandwich and turkey sandwich.   Brunswick stew is a hit.  Neat environment.   Very popular tonight."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for Moe's from the minute I walked in the door. It features Alabama style barbeque, which I had experienced on several long drives down to the Gulf . Their way does not beat our way , but its just as good. Moe's features some really good pork barbeque, smoked chicken , turkey, and outstanding fried catfish . The catfish is a select, delicious lightly fried, crispy bit of goodness. Don't miss it. The smoked chicken is also one of my favorites, though as a true Carolinian, I will bring it home and cook it another 30 minutes . I like my bird to fall apart when I pick up the fork. The sides will vary from day to day, which is a really good thing. Lots of options ranging from squash casserole, mac n cheese, collards, succotash, beans of all persuasions, and their signature Mud Pie dessert.  We have returned to Moe's 8 times since they opened a month ago. Don't miss this place !!! I particularly like the fact that the meals include a drink. My only knock is that their tends to be a little too much portion control(especially with the sides) for a true Southern downhome style eating establishment... and we do not call it a \"po boy\" if its in a small hamburger bun. We call that a slider..."}
{"text":"The food is good, I like the catfish. I think that the smoked turkey is salt couldn't eat it had to send it back. I feel that the portion sizes are small for the expensive price that you pay.  They have great service friendly atmosphere. LOOOOOOVE the banana pudding and collard queens!"}
{"text":"Wow this meal was a southern delight! Veggies change daily and local farm where they were purchased is displayed at the register.  The ribs are so succulent and seasoned to perfection.  Today they had fried corn, black eyed peas and snaps, macaroni and cheese, squash casserole, cornbread dressing with cranberry, to die for baked beans and the best corn bread I've ever had! What are you waiting for oh yes I know it's the banana pudding! Average entree is priced around $10.  Lots of meat choices most all smoked.  Yum yum!!!"}
{"text":"Food was very bland! No flavor at all! Had to add tons of salt and pepper to the Mac n cheese to give it some sort of flavor! They also need to figure out a way to move the line faster."}
{"text":"Food is really tasty, but the serving size is tiny for an $11 lunch. They put your 2 side items in the little cups that are meant for salad dressing and the sandwich is a very average size (but delicious)"}
{"text":"First time here... Drew and his staff were excellent!  Best BBQ in the area. Definitely will be coming back."}
{"text":"Food is good but the service is terrible.  I have been there a few times and the same women is working. She has a super pissy attitude and acts like ever question you ask her us the worst thing ever. I wont go back because of the ladies who work there."}
{"text":"the pulled pork sandwich was dry out of this world! I just didn't understand , how dry it was. Will never go again . The mac n cheese was like regular mac n cheese . Prices are pretty good , but that's about it . bread gets soggy fast, love the customer service though"}
{"text":"Love me some Moe's!!  Meat is always fresh and flavorful.  Their homemade sides, though, are fantastic.  Their collards are the best ever.  But you can't go wrong with any of their standard sides or their rotating daily sides.  While not a regular menu item, if they have the \"egg rolls\", order them!  OMG. One more thing:  the cornbread.  Buttery and yummy.    Whenever I need take food home to the family, most of the time it is Moe's."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious. I'm an out-of-towner who was looking for some good BBQ. Checked out other reviews and figured I'd stop in and check out Moe's. I'm beyond happy I did. It had great street appeal and you could smell the pit from the parking lot. Once inside, I was pleased with how cute everything was. And they had the ACC and Big XII basketball games playing. What more can you ask for? The pulled pork platter did not disappoint. Also had the baked beans, potato salad, cornbread, and banana pudding. I was impressed. Definitely will be coming back next time I'm in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"I went to school at Auburn and Moe's was a great place for quality food and good drinks...plus people watching if the weather was nice and the garage doors were open!  This location...is disappointing.  Service is a 2 at best and saddest thing is, if you go to a bbq place and the highlight of the meal is the sides?!?!  Go elsewhere because none of these sides are memorable, maybe...but only to forget the poor entree's.  Been here several times, had brisket once and it was solid, next time coming here there was nothing special or terrible but tonight...ordered a pulled pork plate and it was like chewing a cotton ball with sauce.  Not one person came to ask how the food was or if we needed anything.  Sorry but with all the great food choices here...I just can't convince myself to let this place ride on the AU locations goodwill!!"}
{"text":"Great BBQ in a quaint side of town.  I had their pulled pork plate with sides of Brunswick stew and delicious slaw, complimented with one of the varied local craft beers they have on tap."}
{"text":"One of my top 2 favorite BBQ restaurant in the Charlotte area! Love their Brisket sandwich done \"Bama Style\" it's fricken delicious! The fried green tomatoes are the second best I've ever had. Losing out to The Cajun Queens legendary fried green tomatoes! But still they are amazing and they really need to make them a permanent menu item!!! All other sides are really good. Banana Pudding is good, but has an odd spice in it that taste a little like clove, which really should not be in it, but it's still pretty tasty. Good service usually. I have eaten here almost weekly for the past 3 years and I never get sick of it!"}
{"text":"Very tasty sides. The collards are excellent and good mac and cheese.  The wings are must!!! I was very impressed with everything."}
{"text":"I thought the Q here was pretty darn good, I thought that the pricing versus food quantity was appropriate and thought that the food was quite tasty. The Pulled pork was solid, the sauce was good too with just the right amount of kick. The cornbread tasted like a properly executed cornbread should. I did think that the fried green tomatoes were pretty weak, it isn't hard to make some really top notch fried green tomatoes with a mild amount of effort. I once again loved the beer selection as well as the layout with garage doors that opened up for when the weather is nice. I left here stuffed from the platter so that is all I have to say about that! I was slightly irritated though that they have a space for a tip when you order at the counter and they simply bring the food out when it is ready, and there are signs that tell you to bus your own tables, sort of tacky but some places roll like that. I'd certainly come back again."}
{"text":"Delicious pulled pork sandwich; meat was very moist and flavorful. Sides tasted homemade and were also fantastic. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Traveled from downtown Charlotte to downtown Matthews for some highly recommended smoked wings.  Parked right across street.  Pedestrian friendly crossing to restaurant."}
{"text":"What a disappointment. 13 dollars for three slices of tough brisket, grainy grits and undercooked greens. Will not darken your doors again."}
{"text":"We went in for lunch on Saturday - got in just about noon and beat the rush.  My wife and I ordered one sandwich plate and another sandwich and split the sides. Plenty of food for the two of us.   Pork was excellent - large portions and the meat was very lean.  Sauce had just the right bite to it."}
{"text":"As I was walking around downtown Matthews I stumbled across this place they have brisket  so I had to come in the food was great it reminds me of a restaurant that I worked at in Wilmington called mission BBQ. The only thing advice I could give you it make better if to check back on your guess never leave them sitting there alone even if they don't won't to be bother you never know they might want or need something other than that great job guys love your place"}
{"text":"Been here a week ago, had the ribs, baked beans,potatoes salad and corn bread and I must say this is some of the best I've ever tasted. The ribs had the perfect tug ,well seasoned and super succulent. The sides were pretty much as good as it could be. Tons of other stuff on the menu, hopefully I will go pig out sometime in the near future. I was visiting from Florida."}
{"text":"Not worth the hassle.  Seating capacity says 135 inside and 30 outside. No parking. Drove around for 10minutes looking for a parking spot. Saw numerous signs for towing but no spots for Moe's. Finally found a spot. Stood in line another 10 minutes to order. $10.28 for a BBQ sand, two sides and a drink. Sandwich was the size of a slider. Expected larger portion for price. Not a good value or convienient for lunch."}
{"text":"Again, another very good experience at Moe's. We're a family of four and it seems we can agree on this place more than most. My son and I like the catfish or smoked wings while the girls like the pork. The sides all always interesting. The beer selection is top notch with something for most beer drinkers. It can get noisy at times especially when young kids are in large quantity. I'm always impressed with the consistent quality and would recommend this place to anyone visiting Matthews."}
{"text":"First off. It's a BBQ joint, not a fancy sit-down chain restaurant with hot girls in short-shorts and tight t-shirts. Most BBQ places are order-at-the-counter, eat off of paper plates and baskets. (The great ones anyway.) Not ever gonna' throw down cuz a BBQ or Chicken place doesn't behave like a sit-down restaurant. Don't even care if they don't have tables. These places concentrate on one thing: Food. And my friends, Moe's has got that food part down-pat! It's dayamn good!!! You can tell all the sides were cooked with \"love\" (butter & pork fat) and you won't care. So so so SO super yummy! I had Mac & Chz that was perfection and my friend had some squash casserole that was so good she couldn't stop making yummy noises. And this is the 1st establishment that I've found that actually rivals my collards. That is no small feat. (I make some mean collards.) And the BBQ?? AMAZING. Tender and sweet and tangy! YummO! Well done!! Will definitely be back. Again and again. Wanna' try EVERYTHING!!!"}
{"text":"Have been here a few time with my kids. Great spot to grab a quick bite in a nice environment."}
{"text":"Went with my son's to check out the place. Had been there when it was Pure Taco. Inside is nice.  The +'s ... The pulled pork was moist and had a good flavor, not the best ever, but good. The sauces were tasty, but not traditional NC vinegar based. The sides were ok. The Mac and cheese were good, the beans were better. Overall, I would give the food 4 stars.  The -'s ... Portion size and price. You can tell it's a franchise when the food comes. Not your typical BBQ joint large tray. The pork was about as much as you would get in a good sandwich and the sides came in small cups like some places use for ketchup, well a little bigger maybe. For $10 and change, not a lot of food. Oh, yea, I wanted to try the brisket, but they only make it 2 days a week? What's up with that?  So if you need a Q fix, it'll do, but expect to pay for your jones!"}
{"text":"I am definitely not an avid \"yelper\" but felt inclined to write a review to negate all the negative reviews. This place is our favorite BBQ joint. Well priced, lots of side options, and great atmosphere. The meat is always lean and perfectly cooked. The wings are some of our favorite in all of Charlotte. I can't say enough about this place! Yummy!"}
{"text":"Fun place to eat, order at the counter and quickly delivered are some delicious meats with sides.  Corn puuding, white beans, banana pudding, baked beans were tasty.  Ribs flavorful but only one sauce option.  Cuban pork available as a special was tasty.  Has outside dining and some craft beers and beers on tap.  Only desert were a couple cookies in a case today.  However, banana pudding as a side sufficed."}
{"text":"Very tasty food, fast service, nice location. The pulled pork sandwich, fried shrimp moe boy, baked beans, Mac n cheese, spicy corn sides all good. Good portion sizes, filled is up. Sandwiches run $9.50 bit come with 2 sides and drink, so that's not bad. The do catering as well. They have a lot of craft beers on tap. I ordered the pulled pork sandwich \"bama style\" with pickles, slaw, bbq sauce and white sauce. Awesome!!"}
{"text":"We absolutely love this place. The owners and staff are incredible, the food is amazing and the price is right. We make Friday visits a routine as they make brisket only on Tuesdays and Fridays. Apparently brisket takes a lot of time and they do it only twice a week to make sure they do it right. We have sampled everything on the regular side menu and it's all delicious. The sweet potato casserole, the jalapeno cheese grits, red beans and rice, potato salad and collards are to die for. The least of our favorites on the regular side menu are the mac and cheese and the banana pudding. Everyday they offer different specials. The redneck nachos are a must, I had a Thanksgiving type turkey sandwich with cranberries, gravy, dressing that was literally one of the best things I have ever eaten. The southern fried catfish and the shrimp moe boy are incredible!!! If they are serving their peanut butter pie, you better go early because it goes fast.  Unbelievable craft beer selection on tap. Great price, delicious food and awesome people! We love to start the evening with a craft beer at Carolina Beer Temple and walk down for dinner at Moe's."}
{"text":"We've been to Moe's Original BBQ a few times now (not to be confused with Moe's Southwest Grill where you get burritos).  It's a chain restaurant, yet it doesn't feel like one.  There are plenty of food options on the menu and every reasonably priced item comes with sides and a drink.    On my first visit, I randomly ordered the Smokey Turkey sandwich.  It was so good that I ordered it on the 2nd visit, too.  It has big pieces of flavorful smoked turkey.   Get it \"'Bama Style\" and they'll smother it in sauce.  My 3rd visit, I ordered the Fried Shrimp Moe Boy.  I naturally assumed it would be their version of a Po Boy on a long hoagie bun, but I was wrong.   It's more like a shrimp sandwich than a Po Boy.  It was on a hamburger bun with a few scattered shrimp.  It was just okay, and I wouldn't order it again.  I'll stick to their BBQ sandwiches or platters from now on.  Along with the sandwiches, you get not one, but two side item choices, and there's a good variety of choices -- cold items, hot items, and even desserts.  My favorite side items so far have been the side salad and mac & cheese.  The side items are served in little plastic cups which make them look really tiny on your plate.  If you dump them out, though, there's really quite a lot in there, and I think Moe's is doing themselves a disservice with this deceptive appearance.    I'd also like to note that when I ordered the above Fried Shrimp Moe Boy, it looked like there were tiny hairs throughout my sandwich.  It looked pretty gross.  I questioned this with one of the workers and they looked into it.  Apparently, fried corn cobs was one of the sides of the day and the corn silk was getting into the fryer, getting singed so it looked like human hair, and then attached itself to my fried shrimp.  It was an acceptable excuse, and I ate the sandwich, but its appearance throughout my shrimp sandwich made me enjoy the fake Po Boy even less.  Note to Moe's: don't fry corn cobs with your other foods.  I can't be the only person who thought there was human hair in my food.  And, corn silk or not, it's not very appetizing in appearance.  Moe's has ample seating inside, with garage door windows that can be opened, depending on the weather.  I recommend a visit for a quick, tasty, filling BBQ meal."}
{"text":"Aww damn. I had another place as my best wings. I think Moe' s is now my new favoritest smoked wings. The fried corn on the cob, sweet potato casserole with corn flakes is Dee-licious! The pinto beans were yummy. Collard greens even yummier. The customer service from staff was awesome. The barbecue sauce was great. The dipping sauce for the wings. Family eating ribs were pleased with flavor and texture and bone to meat connection. If you are in the Charlotte area ease stop on by. I will be back with some more folk."}
{"text":"Moe's BBQ in Matthews for those who don't know 14 beer taps...from my memory they are as of yesterday and they have daily $3 specials and their ice tea is perfect too if you don't care from beer.  DFH 90 minute Foothills Jade Olde Hickory Imperial Stout Founders Porter NoDa Hop, Drop 'n Roll NoDa Gordgeous Birdsong and a few more I can't recall.  The food is awesome!! Love the BBQ but the fried chicken on Wednesday is really good, and the shrimp \"Mo boy\" sandwich is incredible! (had it twice this week) Their sides are all fresh homemade with some being everyday and some daily specials. All have been GREAT so far with the succotash and jalapeno cheese grits being my favorite so far! My wife got the sweat potato casserole as a dessert and it too was amazing...topped with toasted corn flakes I think the only thing it needed was a little whip cream!!! The only disappointment so far has been the banana pudding...it has no bananas.  On our first visit we sorta gripped about the serving sizes of the sides, but for $10 you get a sandwich, 2 sides, and a drink and we have not left hungry. The building is nice with roll up bay doors, screens, and 2 outdoor patios."}
{"text":"Moe's!!! Stopped here on a Business Trip w/ some Customers and it could not have gone better! Customers couldn't stop talking about amazing BBQ and great service! The owner Drew stopped by our table and was super friendly. Can't wait to go back! Smoked Wings are a MUST!"}
{"text":"Smoked wings:awesome! Smoky yet tender. MUST try redneck totchos-for those newbies totchos are tater tot nachos. Pulled pork, beans, queso cheese. Wow. Awesome local beers on draft help wash it down. Order at the counter and food comes fast. I prefer to sit at the bar. I am 2/2 here"}
{"text":"I was offered a chance to review this restaurant for my blog. This restaurant is a gem that I may have overlooked otherwise!  I usually check out the menu of any new restaurant I visit online before heading over. So when I saw the menu below on their website I was pretty underwhelmed. Even though I wasn't excited about the menu I was very excited about the restaurant's location. The restaurants location is a bright, open space on a main street the the quaint, downtown Matthews area with a great outdoor seating area.  Upon entering the restaurant we were greeted a chalkboard listing the side specials of the day. My husband and I were both excited to see these extra options. I am the picky eater of the two of us, and my husband would have been all over the collards and creamed spinach if it wasn't for me.  After a not so quick conversation to decide what entrees and sides we wanted we walked up to the counter to order. Ultimately we ended up with 2 entrees, 4 sides and an add-on of wings to each entree.  While my husband picked out our seats while I checked out the rest of the space. I was excited to learn that there are 12 local and regional beers on tap, including one of B's local favorites, Triple C.  The food was brought to our table and looked amazing. Any hesitations I originally had about what I thought was a limited menu were totally gone. One plate included: pulled pork with sauce, jalapeno cornbread, skillet corn, Brunswick stew, and smoked wings. The other included: shrimp \"Moe\" boy, squash casserole, mac 'n cheese, and smoked wings.  Simply said, the food was delicious, some more so then others. Although everything we tried was flavorful, the skillet corn and Brunswick stew were overshadowed by the other items on our plates.  The two items that I was most impressed with and surprised by was the shrimp \"Moe\" boy and the smoked wings.  I am a huge fan of shrimp po boys thanks to B's family. Although this one was different than many po boys that I have had, B and I agree that it was one of the best. We are used to po boys served on French bread with tartar sauce, lettuce and tomato while Moe's serves theirs on a hamburger bun with their marinated slaw and what appeared to be a house sauce.  The smoked wings were also impressive. I rarely go outside my box with smoked foods. I usually limit myself to smoked pork. I just don't like the smoky, wood flavor in my food (same with oaky wines, not my fave), especially poultry; but when the cashier recommended the wings I decided to branch out and give them a try and I am so glad a did. They had all of the flavor you look for in a wing without all of the saucy mess. They came with celery and what I think was BBQ ranch, however they were so fantastic on their own that I never even opened the sauce. After a conversation with the chef I learned that they are brined, smoked, and then flash fried. Amazing.  The only reason there was anything left on the plate was because the portions were so generous!  If you like BBQ (or even if you don't) add Moe's to your list to try. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Pleasant surprise! Good quality food for the price. BBQ sandwich came with pickles and buttered bun- really good sides. I'd go back for dinner too and get a bbq plate."}
{"text":"This is the best BBQ I have found so far in the Charlotte area. I'm from Kansas City and I'm pretty picky about my meat. This place is consistently good and I love the variety of sides. The staff is friendly and professional and the vibe is nice. I feel really lucky to live so close."}
{"text":"First time here, not the last.  Good stuff.  Smoked wings on Saturday night $0.75 each, great dipping sauce.  Sides are awesome.  Lots to pick from on the menu.  Downtown Matthews walk around before and after."}
{"text":"After my one lunch I'm giving this 4 stars. I had the BBQ sandwich special which included a MacDonalds-cheeseburger-size BBQ sandwich and two sides. I got collards and Jalepeno grtis. The food was very good; I'll be back for more. The service was great. So why not 5? I need to try other items on the menu. The lunch special was $9.25 w/o tax. It includes a drink. I had the sweet tea which was spot -on for how I like it. Not to sweet like you find at many restaurants. I'm a native Charlottean but I probably like my tea less-sweet than other southern folks. Nonetheless, good BBQ in Charlotte is sparse but I would say these guys are heading in the right direction with the pork BBQ.  If you like pork BBQ, this is worth your time and money for a try."}
{"text":"Nice location, Very Tasty Food and Fast Service! They have a good selection of sides! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"The service was pretty good for the most part. Not overly friendly but somewhat attentive. My order was put in the computer wrong but they brought me the right thing without any questions asked.  As previously mentioned by others, this is way overpriced for what you get. The quality of barbecue is highly disappointing for something that is being served in NC. The BBQ isn't smoky and the sauce is bland. The amount of meat we got (pork) was shabby. The sides are really small and I think the size of a large Jell-O shot is accurate. The cobbler was disappointing as were the baked beans. The red beans and rice were yucky. The Mac and cheese was ok. The cornbread was eh. I wouldn't go back. There are way better BBQ places all over the Charlotte metro area."}
{"text":"Underwhelming. Have been meaning to try this place for some time now. Was hoping for something unique or at least something that would compel me to come back. It's not that it's bad or terrible it's just nothing special and as such we probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Great food! Had the pulled pork plate and green beans and Mac and cheese. There was plenty of food to fill me up. The cornbread wasn't my favorite but overall a cool atmosphere and quality food!"}
{"text":"I consider myself a BBQ snob as I eat Q at least once a week and I have a nice smoker and do a few events each year...BBQ and Blues is my favorite here in CLT. Enough about me...I have been to Moe's on three occasions and feel this guys do a decent job with their Q.  They do pulled pork, smoked turkey, chicken, brisket and ribs.  The side are very good and sometimes a little over creative.  The mac and cheese could use some help but the sweet potatoes and greens are very good along with a few others.  These guys know their stuff and smoke their meat using fruit wood or a combination of with hickory.  I would rate this guys above the joints uptown Charlotte and a little better than Macs on south blvd  The portions are a good size, for example a meat with two sides and a drink is $10.00 for a platter. You can add another meat for $3.00.  The beer selection is not bad either.  Give this place a try, you won't regret it one bit....Keep on Smok'n"}
{"text":"Hands down the BEST smoked wings I have ever had.  Didn't need the dipping sauce because they were super juicy and just perfect on their own."}
{"text":"No smoke flavor  in the pork bbq and sides(collards and black eyed peas) were devoid of flavor. Subpar bbq all the way"}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday evening it was nice because they were not busy. You place your order, pay and when food is ready they take it to your table. Ice and lemonade on the soda machine was not working but I told one of the workers and they took care of it right away. The restaurant is in a nice area. Food was very good."}
{"text":"Loved this place.  I had the pulled pork sandwich, piled very high plus sweet potato casserole which was awesome and banana pudding. Yum! Husband had Mahi Mahi sandwich which he said unbelievable.  Lima beans good too.  Plus easy casual atmosphere. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Best wings in the city. They aren't deep fried or covered in sauce, just grilled, juicy, and full of flavor. Come on wing night when they are 75 cents each (tuesdays and Saturday). I also hate banana pudding but love it here. Put that Alabama white sauce on everything!!!"}
{"text":"Great small town atmosphere and very inviting. Ordered the pork platter with baked beans and slaw. Wonderful meal and the corn bread was perfect!"}
{"text":"The food here is absolutely fantastic! We could not be more pleased with how wonderful everything tasted, and the fast service here. Totally worth the trip if you're in the area."}
{"text":"The service was great and the location is nice. The low rating is for two things: the amount of food for your money and the food simply not being up my alley. A small group of is were in the mood for BBQ and kept being told about Mose's by our neighbors. We figured we'd check it out. If you rose a platter (BBQ sandwich with two sides) it'll cost you almost $10. That $10 gets you a small sandwich with a small amount of sauce and two small side portions. Your side portions are the size of large Jell-O shots.   After requesting no pickles on the sandwich, I ended up with pickles. I wasn't too irked by it until I tasted the sandwich and realized the BBQ sauce, what little there was, has a strong pickle flavor. My system and pickles do not get along so I was unable to eat much of the sandwich and, instead, delved into the mac & cheese side. It was tasty but a small portion and the cheese mostly hung on the side of the container in a mass.   Despite my dislike of the flavor, I still would not go back as there are so many other places to get BBQ and they give you a decent sized (and much tastier) sandwich for your money."}
{"text":"Always stopping but for a great and affordable pint of Brunswick Stew. My favorite in Charlotte/Matthews and surrounding areas.   The sides are really tasty too. I like the jalape√±o grits, creamed corn, skillet corn and collards.   Also, the bonus of cornbread is a good thing.  Employees are friendly and really nice.  I love the music that is usually playing...laid back grooves."}
{"text":"This place is counter service with a nice seating area where they will bring your food after you place your order. The pulled chicken was really moist and flavorful. Pulled pork also very good. Catfish sandwich was very good. Sides: baked beans were sweet with a little bit of heat, the sweet potato casserole was really very sweet topped with a lot of crunchy corn flakes, broccoli slaw I was very good with just rice wine vinegar. Banana pudding was very good. Prices were reasonable. I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Bought two pulled pork sandwiches from Moe's. The sauce is alright but the sandwiches were awesome. It's cool how they bring a bucket that has napkins and the sauce in it so you can put however amount of sauce you want on your sandwich. Spent 21 dollars for two pulled pork sandwiches, two drinks, and four sides! Great deal. Will be back.."}
{"text":"The building itself is so neat! There are art installations in the front and the restaurant is breezy with big garage doors that open. The menu appears to change regularly which is really nice. The special of the day was the Thanksgiving Sandwich, which I got. My boyfriend got the pulled pork plate. My sandwich was so good and so were the fried sweet potato spears that i got for my side. The Brunswick stew was bland and generic. My boyfriends pulled pork was just good. Nothing crazy. I wasn't a fan of how they only had one barbecue sauce. I would've thought they'd have a bunch. My boyfriend never got his cornbread that came with the plate and when he asked the counter lady for it, she still never brought it. That kind of bothered me but the atmosphere and my food made up for the blunder."}
{"text":"The smoked turkey is very good. However if you are picky eater, I would recommend getting your slaw on the side as well as the white sauce which is mayo based.  Macaroni is very good, baked beans contain green peppers, but still good. Their sweet potato casserole is home style, and delicious. If your a southern and love banana puddin, you need to try Moe's.   Overall the food is good. Pricey, average $20 for two people. The staff are very nice."}
{"text":"As usual, I am going to be the dissenter on the overwhelming WOW's of a new place.  As a disclaimer, I don't think there is anything fundamentally wrong with any of the food - I just didn't care for any of it.  From the sea of 4's and 5's this place has gotten, I see that very few had the ribs or BBQ, which is what I had.  The chicken seems to be a fan favorite, but I am not going to get chicken at a BBQ joint.    After visiting the folks, I found myself in Matthews and starving at 5:00 on a Thursday.  I thought I could mark off a bookmark by heading over to Moe's.  Neat brick restaurant (in a building just next to Kristopher's, and on the same street as the library) that looks very nice outside and inside.  As expected, there was no one in the place except for the employees at the early dinner time, who all seemed to be working hard tidying up the place for the Matthews Alive foot traffic starting the next day.  Including, a diligent young lady who was dragging chairs across the concrete floor (that's a pleasant noise) and using a metal cleaner to de-streak the metal stands on the tables.  Great smell from 5' away while I am trying to eat.  That was paired with Willie Nelson music being jacked up and down in volume.    Concrete floors, some roll-up windowed garage doors for a covered open patio effect with ceiling fans moving the air through (the doors were down though - it is summer in NC - 90 degrees with a possible storm at any minute).  There is also some outdoor seating.  I loved the concrete pig bench just inside the doors - very cute.    You order at the counter (be sure to checkout the special/sides on the chalk board at the entrance and the chalk board next to where you order) and are given a number to put on your table, food is brought to you.  I headed around the corner to get my drink and saw a sign above plastic squirt bottles of a dark sauce stating they only have one BBQ sauce.  You had best like it, because that is what goes on your meats.  I didn't like it.  I prefer a sweeter western style; this was a thicker sauce, but more vinegar than sweet and very strong.  Bleh.    The food: I wanted to try a little bit of everything, so an order of 6 ribs, 3 oz. of pulled pork, skillet corn (one of the side specials), mac and cheese, banana pudding (it's a side) and a piece of cornbread (and a drink) was just over $20.    The ribs: Meh.  Fine in size.  They said the meat is smoked, but that isn't what I tasted.  They tasted similar to the ribs I do in my oven.  Meaty, but with fatty veins, and drizzled with the BBQ sauce that I didn't like.  I like ribs that can stand on their own without the sauce, these would not to me.  Meat was tender though. The pulled pork:  The pork was vinegary, though cooked well and tender.  Covered in the BBQ sauce that I didn't like.  Again, I wasn't tasting the smoked flavor, just vinegar this time. Skillet corn:  Excellent.  A mixture of tender corn, red peppers, celery and maybe some onion (?), and a couple of small pieces of sausage/kielbasa.  Well flavored and a good side.  Corn shouldn't be the favorite dish at a BBQ joint. Mac and cheese:  Meh.  I believe it was baked at some point and then crammed into the plastic containers that the sides come in, which it then molded to the cup.  Lukewarm.  Congealed cheese.  No. Banana pudding:  Wafer on top, wafer on the bottom, thick and creamy pudding between.  Nothing earth shattering, but not neon yellow or jaw-clenching sweet, this was my #2 favorite of the meal behind the skillet corn.  Cornbread:  Maybe I am not accustomed to the flavors of wherever this recipe for cornbread came from, but never in my 38 years have I had cornbread that was finished on the grill.  I think there were pieces of jalapeno in it - dry, crumbly and grilled.  Nope.  I ate all of the sides and pulled pork and took most of the ribs and cornbread to my mom for her to try before she schleps my dad over there.  She wasn't a fan either.    This was not a meal worthy of $20 in quality, though the portions were fine.  The young man that took my order was a typical ambivalent teen, the young lady that brought my food was pleasant (that is the only interaction you will have with staff - you order with them and they drop off the food at your table - you get your own drinks, condiments, BBQ sauce, etc., and bus your table yourself).  I didn't like the BBQ sauce at all.  And though I was the only diner in the place, it would have been nice to not have to listen to Willie at full blast (and then silent, and then full blast again) and have the chemical-spraying cleaning crew scuttling about.  I like chains, I don't knock them as there is something to be said about reliable consistency of a brand, but this tastes like chain BBQ to me.    \"I ain't going back.\" - Pawpaw C."}
{"text":"Finally, a legit bbq spot. The atmosphere was great for families, as well as a bunch of friends for a get together. You order at the bar as soon as you come in through the front door. You take a number , sit wherever  you want, and the food comes to you. It's pretty fast for a bbq joint. The glass garage doors all around are a pretty cool touch. I'm sure it's a nice place to be in the spring or fall when the weather is on point. The 6 rib platter is bomb.com! I got 2 sides of mac n cheese and some cornbread. I also enjoyed their mississippi mud pie, too! Excellent customer service, plus, the employees hustle to make sure your order/experience is a great one. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Great food!  My husband had the smoked wings plate, everything on the plate had the best flavor good quality and price was right. The slaw, Mac and cheese and corn bread was the best I have had in the south. I had a smoked turkey sandwich it was perfect. The place is clean and nice family place."}
{"text":"Love this place!!! We had a BBQ sandwich with baked beans/mac-n-cheese and BBQ plate with baked beans, slaw and cornbread respectively. The slaw was slightly sweet and crunchy with hand shredded cabbage. In my opinion a perfect combination. The baked beans were perfectly cooked, slightly sweet with a hint of pepper and you could still tell you where eating beans and not mash! Mac-n-cheese appears to have white cheddar giving it a light cheesy taste not too heavy. Yum! We chose the pulled pork BBQ with a sweet sauce. The pork was cooked to perfection with just enough 'juice' to keep it from being dry and just enough sauce to enhance the already delicious taste of fresh cooked BBQ. These guys don't play! They know their BBQ!!!  Every dish above leans to the sweet side of BBQ and is delicious!!! Already making plans to go back!"}
{"text":"Food is amazing. Good beers on draft. Although the way the restaurant is run is ridiculous. I've been here a few times now so I can't say it was just one experience.  The one poor girl who is up front has ALL the responsibility of service. She's (whoever it shall be any day) has the responsibility of taking the order of all the food for everyone walking in the door right at the counter (which you're supposed to tip before you're even served your food). She's also the bartender at the decent sized bar pouring all the drinks herself. She's also the server that has to go to the kitchen and get the food and bring it out to your table vacating her other positions. Today I witnessed a manager, I'm assuming, smart mouthed his employee because she had to do all these other tasks while he had to explain the awkward ordering, seating, and food ordering situation to customers that standing around looking confused. The manager obviously is very proud of his food, which, no doubt, is great. But until the setup of this place is organized better I think I'll grab my food elsewhere because I hate to see employees talked down to that are doing 3 times the jobs as the manager who's walking around with his pride in tact."}
{"text":"Very pricey. This is going to sound crazy - went to BBQ place but we ordered catfish sandwich & shrimp 'mo-boy. Lived in Houston & miss my po-boys.   When I called I asked if it was large enough to share & was told it was. NO! It was a reg sz hamburger bun. Also I ordered both with the sauce on the side, that didn't happen. The fish/shrimp cooked great & great flavor but lettuce, pickle, sauce & green peppers (thought that last one was odd) overpowered. Mac n cheese was bland & needed seasoning. Other guest got BBQ pork sandwich - didn't try meat, but sauce was good. Cornbread was dry & lacked flavor. Sweet tater casserole was good & flavorful.   It was $35 for 3 of us to eat. Don't think I will be going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing. Best place to eat in the Matthews/Indian Trail area, hands down!!!!! Great BBQ, Mac and cheese on fleek, banana pudding to die for!!! Two words; Baked potato. Awesome beer selection to go with the wonderful food!"}
{"text":"Won't be coming back....  city bbq is a better place and better priced food. Wings are ok but way over priced."}
{"text":"Give me a moment to get up all in your grill to talk about how great Moe's BBQ actually is.   I got a beef brisket plate and had no regrets about it. Meat as tender and delightful as they should be when done right, baked potato perfect to where you can dig in no problem with a plastic spoon, and very-cheesy Mac and cheese.   Pulled pork sandwich was also well done and greatly amplified when adding the BBQ sauce that is at every table.   On top of the great food, the guy at the register was very personable and had a quick chat with us about our day plans and even gave some useful recommendations. Friendly people & good food! I recommend putting this place at the top of your barbecue list!"}
{"text":"I had the catfish sandwich. It was so good that taking that last bite made me sad. The Mac and Cheese was delish and the watermelon/cucumber salad was good - unusual. My husband had the smoked turkey sandwich  Alabama style and collard greens. He said that everything was very good. I'm excited to go back!!!"}
{"text":"Normally when I'm checking out a chain BBQ joint, I make sure to not get my hopes up too much.  But with a friend of mine recommending that I give it a shot, I decided \"why not?\"  And I usually don't write reviews after the first visit, but I decided to after this experience.  As I walked up to the door, I could smell the smoke, and the sight of logs out back gave me hope.  I walked up to the counter and ordered a smoked chicken sandwich \"Alabama style\" (which means they add slaw and Alabama white sauce) with potato salad and banana pudding as my sides (more on that later).  The total (with a $2 tip) was just under $12.  The price may seem a bit steep, but the price included my beverage.  First off, the chicken on the smoked chicken sandwich was a mixture of white and dark meat and was smoked quite nicely.  The sandwich was sauced just right, with just the right amount of slaw.    And for the sides...  they're served in small plastic cups and could be construed as being a bit on the small side.  The banana pudding I ordered was actually the color of bananas (and not that neon yellow that you often see), with a vanilla wafer on top and on bottom.  Not overly sugary and adequately pleasing.  And for the potato salad... well, I never got to taste it.  When I first received my meal, I discovered a hair in my potato salad.  I asked for a replacement, only for that replacement to also have a hair in it.  Frustrated, I asked for a completely different side (baked beans).  I was brought out an order of baked beans (which had a bold, tangy flavor that I prefer).  A few minutes later, the manager came over with a $10 gift card and apologized for the potato salad incident (and also let me know that they trashed that batch of potato salad).  Before leaving, she also gave me a second batch of banana pudding.    This was an excellent example of customer service, and I'll definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"All 4 stars are for the food only. The BBQ is really good, so are the sides. This BBQ isn't as good as you'll find in some of the NC Mountain towns (Woodlands) but it's better than everything else in Charlotte.   My main question is, why no waiters? Ordering food here is challenging and confusing. You order from the bar computer and find a seat. This restaurant needs waiters, it's not setup to order food and find a place to sit.   Secondly I ordered a catering pack for \"5 or 6\" people and we got banana pudding as one of the sides. They only gave us 4 small cups and said 5 or 6 on the website is just an estimate and the banana pudding didn't come in catering sizes. Well I was feeding 6 people, that's why I ordered it, so I had to order 2 extra ones separately, they should have just given them to me.   We've been here quite a few times but sitting and eating is not a good experience. The food however is excellent."}
{"text":"Delicious, let's just get that out there first. Had 6 wings while I was waiting for a pile of food to bring home and let me tell you the wings are smoked, delicious, and big. The 6 wings weren't even gone before the two large brown bags of delicious smoked meat showed up. From the moment I got there to the last bite, it was nothing short of awesome! Sorta makes me want to visit the family in the summer so I can sit on the patio with some smoked wings and work through the local beers on tap."}
{"text":"For people who like to eat out but close to home, this place is perfect. The prices are reasonable, the food is delicious and they have specials every day. The sides they offer are great and I could make a meal off of just them but I always have to get the BBQ. Makes my mouth water just thinking about it. Bama style is the best way for the sandwiches.  They have desserts too but the BBQ and sides are usually more than we can eat so we never have any room. If you love BBQ this is the place for you."}
{"text":"Best ribs you won't regret. Me and my family were surprised we had to serve ourselves though and the table could have been a lot cleaner. But a good meal is a good meal"}
{"text":"Excellent BBQ (I had the chicken on all three visits). Clean restaurant (including the restroom!); friendly staff, ample seating, delicious food."}
{"text":"Best BBQ in the Charlotte area, hands down.  The sides are better than any you'll find anywhere else, and they've always got a great beer selection on tap. Cheerwine is always on the fountain too!"}
{"text":"this was my 4th  visit to Moe's.  I originally learned of this restaurant via a birthday party I attended where their wings were served.  I have tried whole chicken, wings, pulled pork and catfish.  On my first three visits, I ordered and came in to pick up and go.  Let me say..the chicken is absolutely the best ever. However, customer service is horrendous.  When visiting each time as a carry out customer, I was never treated warmly nor acknowledged.  I figured they are busy and the service must be better as a dine in customer.  NOT.  I came in for lunch with my husband just today.  No one was at the front. After a minute or so, a young man appeared and queried if we had dined here before.  I advised we had but as carry out. He looked at me with a blank stare and said \"whenever you are ready.\" Assuming this was our signal to order, we ordered and seated ourselves.  Our food was prepared and brought out in reasonable time, the food was cooked well, he temperature was good and portions reasonable.  During our meal, no one and I mean no one checked in on us. After we finished eating, my husband and I continued to talk and was approached by an employee inquiring if we were finished, so she could take our plates. Both my husband and I noted the service, finished our conversation and used the restroom before leaving.  The restrooms were in decent order.  Kinda felt as if we were not welcomed. As we exited, the young man attending the bar with no customers, said nothing.  The young lady who cleared our plates yelled \"thank you and have a great day!\" Customer service is huge to me. So huge that your food could be outstanding but your service is poor and I would never return.  Well that is the case here.  Our family will never spend coin here again.  Great food but just about THE WORST service I have experienced in a long while."}
{"text":"Worst BBQ in Charlotte.  The ribs and pulled pork had no flavor.  The mac and cheese and potato salad were bland.  McDonalds could do a better job with their McRib sandwich.  Will never go back again.  Will always go to Midwood Smokehouse for BBQ - best in Charlotte."}
{"text":"First off all the kids running this place were absolutely great, unfortunately this food is making me think that the excellence of Southern cooking is a legend in their own mind.   Wednesday special AWSOME fried chicken w/2 sides. $10 The chicken was basically OK although 2 out 3 pieces weren't cooked as thoroughly as I like - chicken is the ONLY thing I like well done, nothing else.  2.5 stars a side of ribs: 3 pieces for $3 not a bad value, but the ribs meh! The primary flavor was salt with a vague smoky aftertaste, and wazzup with pickles? I would never order it again 2 stars Corn bread, the worse I ever had.  0 stars Baked beans, exact same corn syrup sweet stuff your neighbors serve at every bbq.  2 stars Potato salad : where the hell did they get the idea that using lots of pickled jalapeno would make a potato salad taste good? Crap  1 star.   The meal cost me $18 including a beer, I can live with the price but with the food, no. It's a 1.5 star meal rounded up to 2 stars because the help was a pleasure to deal with."}
{"text":"Food was great. Flavorful. Staff was attentive and caring. Will definitely return. Love the feel of historic Matthews. We ate on the little patio outside."}
{"text":"Kind of middle of the pack fare & pricing run away if you're not careful. The family meal is a good deal.  Don't go if you're ravenous. A good choice, if you're trying not to pack on the poundage.  Will agree with other writers that the tea is A.+  You'd think that tea might not be so hard to get right. A lot of joints don't, but Moe's is spot on."}
{"text":"The best wings ever- and I know my wings Brisket is melt in your mouth - slap your mom kind of good!  Sides from collard greens to jalape√±o cornbread. Did I mention the amazing local craft beer selection- will wet the most discriminating palate One of my favorite go to spots"}
{"text":"Meh. That's the best way to describe Moes. I've had the original from Alabama and this one doesn't really compare. The flavoring isn't there."}
{"text":"For lunch,  I got the smoked chicken sandwich plate and spent 10.45.  Big price,  small portions.  The taste was pretty good...  Chicken,  baked beans and coleslaw,  just small for the price.  Not splurge worthy."}
{"text":"We tried the BBQ at lunch a week ago. It was good for local BBQ. But for the record none in the area is worthy of the \"Lexington \" area style title! Just not impressed with any BBQ in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Great portions for the pricing. Nice set up and super friendly staff. Definitely some of the best bbq in Charlotte area."}
{"text":"Went here first day they were open, as I have been patiently awaiting their arrival, and they were definitely worth the wait.  I got the smoked chicken sandwich and the meat was SOOOO juicy and tender, my wife had the smoked turkey and it was equally as good.  For my sides I got watermelon salad and collard greens.  The collards were amazing, they had chunks of sausage mixed in!! And I can't even explain how great the watermelon salad was, went back to get a bulk amount for a fathers day BBQ and they were out, I was a sad boy!  The aroma is amazing the smokey smell of roasting meat fills the air and you can smell it even before opening the front door.  On top of all of this they have a great beer selection, the draught list included local gems like OMB, Mother Earth, and Highlands.  I'm very excited about this place for the rest of summer, and while craft beer prices did seem to be a little pricey, the food is cheap enough to balance it out.  Can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"Happy Cinco de Mayo!!! So my mom and I went and ate here today for Cinco de Mayo. We had the pork and brisket tacos. They were amazing!! If you're looking for a place to celebrate Cinco de Mayo come here they have a lot of beer on draft. And good redneck nachos. The staff are very friendly to come on out."}
{"text":"We are just finishing a GREAT lunch at Moe's. Some of the tastiest ribs. Pulled pork, greens, slaw (both kinds), cornbread and Brunswick stew to be found anywhere.   Do not even pause when considering eating here. Great ambiance and range of beers too."}
{"text":"We stopped at Moe's today for lunch.  My wife had the pulled pork sandwich with sides of sweet potato casserole and Cole slaw and I had a shrimp sandwich with sides of mac 'n cheese and black eyed pea salad.  Our meals were both good.  Service was very good."}
{"text":"This is a over priced so called \" Tap Room\" all they want to do is sell beer not their \"so called BBQ\" And the prices are forgetabout it\" They think that if it is in Matthews people will pay anything."}
{"text":"Yummy! Excellent food. From the brisket to sweet potatoes casserole super tasty! Everything was perfect, prepared to order, hot and well seasoned. My husband enjoyed his Mac and cheese but especially enjoyed the corn bread. I absolutely loved my food too.   My only concern is no printed allergy menu, but to the cashier listened and knew what had been prepared with eggs and able to make suggestions of foods to avoid or to try.  Still not a fan of Carolina style bbq sauce, but next time I will bring along a bottle of sweet baby rays."}
{"text":"I had heard of Moe's and decided to try. As we walked in, slightly confused as no hostess to serve us, but the bar tender directed us to other end. He explained the menu and how to order at the counter. With decisions to be made while standing, it felt slightly overwelming, however he was very patient with us. I tried the wings and a couple of ribs. I was taken back when he said there were no sauce choices for wings, but that they were smoked and he assured me that they are great with the flavor that comes with it, slight hot and slight sweet. He was right, they tasted great. The ribs were good but overcooked as they were too tender. Atmosphere was comfortable and our service was friendly and fast Will return."}
{"text":"This food is sooooo good. I had the \"Redneck Nachos\" which were delicious. Our kids inhaled their smoked chicken and sides and my husband ate all of his yummy ribs. We enjoy the rotation of sides and specials and the homemade everyday sides and desserts, all made with local ingredients."}
{"text":"We tried this place for dinner on a week night. We sat at the bar and realized you order at the counter (no waiter service). The bartender was friendly and they had a good selection of drafts (including some charlotte brews). There are also tables outside on the patio.  They have your usual bbq meats available in sandwich form or platter form, and they come with 2 sides. I had the smoked chicken sandwich with gumbo and a side salad. My husband had the pulled pork sandwich with side salad and mac & cheese. The sandwiches can be served \"Bama\" style - red sauce, white sauce and slaw or plain. All the food was solid, not life changing, but really good. My personal preference is smokier flavor, I really didn't notice the smoky smoky goodness in my chicken, so I would kick that up a little.   Overall, we liked it and would definitely go back for lunch when in the mood for some good Q!"}
{"text":"I don't make it to Matthews all that much.  It's just a little further out than I generally travel.  However, I have always enjoyed its small town feel.  I was in town for a meeting that ran a little over and put me in that traffic \"nightmare\" portion of the day.  Instead of braving the traffic and trekking home I thought I deserved a little reward for a good days work.   Moe's was just across from my meeting spot at the coffee shop so I asked them their opinion. They seemed to agree on everything being spot on from the brisket to the collards with one exception.  One of them absolutely loved their coleslaw and the other said it was no better than Brussels Sprouts.  Well, I do hate Brussels Sprouts, but I absolutely love coleslaw, so I thought I'd be the tie-breaker and a take look see.    I ventured over and gave the menu a once over. Elijah, who was behind the bar area, came over and asked me for my order.  I asked him about the coleslaw and he told me it was a marinated vinegar-based slaw with onions, peppers and celery seeds.  \"Sounds great.  I'll take a pint and a beer while I wait.\"    Elijah headed to the kitchen and wasn't gone all that long when I started perusing the menu more.  He brought my order out and placed it by my side just as I realized that they had Jalape√±o Cheese Grits.  \"I'd like to place another order.\"  He smiled and I proceeded to order a pint of the grits.  He asked if there was anything else I desired to which I thanked him and told him that I was golden.  Once again he headed towards the kitchen and I continued drinking my beer and digesting the rest of the menu.  He was probably only gone a minute when I realized that my eyes had missed their Holy Grail.  Moe's has a White BBQ Sauce.  \"Get out of town!\"  I'm from Lower Alabama (LA) and everybody in Alabama knows that Northern Alabama is the birthplace of white BBQ sauce: just about the only good thing to come out of Northern Alabama by the way, but I digress,  Now white sauce is a mayonnaise-based sauce, made tangy with the addition of vinegar, horseradish, and mustard.  You can use it as a basting sauce, topping, or even a dipping sauce with chips.  It's a redneck ambrosia.  Once you've gone white sauce, you'll never go red again.    I placed an order for a BBQ sandwich with their delectable white sauce.  It didn't take the pit long to prepare the sandwich   When he brought it out, it was packed full of meat: a bit more than I had expected actually.  Elijah threw in a side of the white sauce for me to use with my meal as well.  I took it all to go.  It took me another several hours to finally make it home.  I figured the cole slaw would survive, but I was a bit concerned that the sandwich and grits would have kicked the bucket by then.  To my amazement, the grits held their own and were easy to resuscitate. The sandwich tasted just fine.  In fact, I ate it all in a single sitting and used the extra White sauce for dipping purposes.  I guess I was a little surprised at the quality of the white sauce.  I half expected it to be a cheap knock-off of the real deal.  It turns the founders of Moe's had attended school at Tuscaloosa before entering the BBQ business.  I suppose one of them had brought the recipe for the sauce along.  It was very authentic and much better than bottled varieties you can buy in the store.  All in all, Moe's is something special.  I have not had a full meal, but what I have had was delicious.  The cole slaw was good.  It definitely had a vinegar taste and wasn't all that heavy.  That's a good thing when you're eating BBQ.  Need to save room for the good stuff.    Five Stars for service; Five Stars for the White BBQ Sauce; Five Stars for the Sandwich and grits; Four stars for the Cole Slaw.    Kudos --"}
{"text":"I stopped there yesterday. I was served terrible food.  Old, mushy baked beans.  The \"marinated slaw\"  hadn't been stirred so I received unmarinated slaw.  The chicken was smoked to the point where all I could taste was the acrid fresh smoke of newly lit wood.  And no mayonnaise sauce on the sandwich, like I asked for.  Service was half committed to something else but not me, the customer.  The worst part about this kind of food and service is that the owner knows what is going on and is deliberately putting out bad product with a who-give-a-hoot attitude."}
{"text":"If I needed a reason to live, I would go to Moe's and order a smoked chicken sandwich... And order one of their many craft beers, or some delicious Mac and cheeeeeeeese. It's really nice to have a restaurant of this quality and laid back feel in  downtown Matthews. I will be back, especially to get some more collards...."}
{"text":"Best barbecue around. Real wood smoke pit in the back. They have different specials each day: Monday is Mahi Mahi Sandwich, Tuesdays and Fridays is Beef Brisket, Wednesday is Southern Fried Chicken and Thursday is Thanksgiving Day Sandwiches. Everything is amazing. The best thing I've had is the Pulled Pork Egg Rolls. They don't have it on the regular menu so it's a real treat when they have it on the board. To top it off, they have awesome craft beer selection- 12 taps and great can/bottle selection. I eat here at least once a week!"}
{"text":"I would like to start by saying why?  Why does this place only have 4 stars?  This is hands down the best BBQ around in my opinion!  This is our go to place.  We love trying new places but there are some that stand out and Moe's tops our list.    You walk in and know that you are about to have an amazing meal.  The smell of real wood pit smoked BBQ greets you.  The cool, relaxed vibe with the garage doors and outside seating calms you.  The board with all of the specials of the day is always on point!  This is not your typical BBQ joint with plain old mac and cheese and baked beans.  They have all of the things you want and love but each of them have their own unique twist.  Everything is innovative and  made in house.  There is always something new and delicious to try.  We have been here so many times and have never once been disappointed .  Try the wings!  But I will warn you...it might ruin wings for you forever anywhere else!  They have a small but good selection of beer on tap which is great also.    All around this is our favorite place to go.  If I could give it 6 stars I would!"}
{"text":"The pulled pork was excellent however the portion was very small. Even the sides were small. For a ten dollar plate all portions where small. But what I did get was very tastey."}
{"text":"Man this place is great. Good service, great food, beer on tap, basically everything you'd want at a good BBQ joint. They have several tvs and lots of seating. Meals are a little pricy but you do get a good portion size. My girlfriend and I have been about a dozen times and we'll keep coming back."}
{"text":"This tasty BBQ joint in downtown Matthews has a fantastic beer selection, good food and a fun, laid-back vibe. I only wish it hadn't taken so long to enjoy our meal. Without table service, guests order food from a single register at the counter, and getting through the line took close to 20 minutes during our recent visit. Plates are delivered to your table, but they leave it to you to clean up afterward. I wish I could say this was reflected in the price, but Moe's is no less expensive then other comparable BBQ joints -- although you do save on tips. There's ample seating inside, as well as a smattering of tables on the street.   The food was solid, from the delicious wings we shared as an appetizer, to the succulent pulled pork I ordered for my entree. The Mac n' Cheese and baked bean sides were decent, but both could've used more flavor. Honestly, having heard how great the food was here, I was expecting a bit more.  The beer selection, however, is the real highlight. Craft brews from Charlotte and other parts of NC are prominently featured, but there were also some interesting choices from other parts of the U.S. On our visit, I enjoyed two delicious pints of Wicked Weed's Pernicious IPA, which isn't the easiest brew to find on tap.   I wanted to like this place more, but it just took WAY to long to place our order the night we were there. If Moe's wants to keep its counter ordering system in place, it needs to have more than one register going at a time."}
{"text":"I ordered the pulled pork platter with greens and Mac-n-cheese.  Service was excellent, restaurant full of patrons, and the entire restaurant was very clean.   The location is excellent.  I really don't have any complaints about this place.  I would recommend it and I'd definitely go back."}
{"text":"Good food. Nice selection of BBQ and sides.  This is an 'order at the counter and have it brought to your table place'. Which was great for what we wanted."}
{"text":"Finally got a chance to check out Moe's after passing by it many times. We had a party of seven and were able to sit together at a large round table.  Ordered at the counter and food was brought to the table quickly.  I had the smoked half chicken with the mac and cheese and baked beans. It was a big meal and a good value. The chicken was delicious and so were the sides. I can't remember what everyone else had but they all enjoyed their meals. No complaints.  I'm not one who analyzes the elements of the meal. It was just good food in nice surroundings and very clean including the bathroom which is always a good sign.  Will definitely return soon."}
{"text":"This is by far the best BBQ I have had in the Carolinas. The food and service are both excellent! Every item on the menu is excellent... I would definitely recommend this restaurant. You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times in the past few months and get something different every time. I like that they try and keep things local (I know for a fact that collard greens sold here are grown by local farmers in Matthews). The BBQ is delicious. The dry rub/spices that they put on the ribs are delicious! The corn bread is to die for!! The Mac & cheese is my favorite side and super yummy. The banana pudding has a hint of nutmeg and possibly cinnamon too, which is good. I really enjoy the atmosphere and the service/workers are great!  They get stars short because of the sauce. BBQ sauce is super important in a BBQ place, but the sauce here is just not very flavorful. Also the baked beans are very, very sweet. I don't get beans often, so different batches can possibly vary, but it's been too much on the sweet side opposed to other baked beans I've had from other places before."}
{"text":"I love this place! The open air dining is a nice treat on a Saturday afternoon. The food is reasonably priced, great portion sizes and delicious!  We ordered wings, smoked turkey sandwich, Mac and cheese, potato salad and fried green tomatoes. Everything was amazing, I especially enjoyed the wings and will come back JUST to eat those. Their dipping sauce is bomb and all the BBQ sauces had excellent flavor! So happy to have found this gem in Matthews."}
{"text":"Solid BBQ joint in DT Matthews.  I used to think it was a local spot until i saw one in Denver.  With that said, for a franchise, it has a nice local feel!  My go to is the pulled pork sandwich combo \"Bama style\", meaning it comes with a white BBQ sauce.  I really like to get Mac and Cheese and dip it into their really good BBQ sauce.    They run daily side specials.  If they have the sweet potato casserole, definitely try that out!   Tried the wings one time and from what i can remember, they were pretty good.  They also have local brews on tap, but most importantly, Solid Sweet tea and Cheerwine on tap!"}
{"text":"Excellent, consistently good food. (Clean & well-managed restaurant which is soooo important to me!) Food is usually out quickly even when they're very busy. Franchise with a decidedly local feel that fits perfectly in the Matthews community. Not to mention, they always have a killer craft beer selection on tap."}
{"text":"Love it! Pulled pork was excellent and good portions too! I will be going back to try the catfish, and the brisket they seem to be popular items and they had run out when we got there. Good service, quick and casual def a family place.  Just two lil reasons why I didn't give them the extra star; they could really benefit of an extra cash register to take orders, while in line to place our order, people were trying to pay their tabs to leave, the poor kid taking orders was getting overwhelmed, don't get me wrong he was pleasant and handled the moment as best as he could.  Last item, the hanging lamps are right in front of the TVs ;(  Other than that it was a good experience, we are half we stopped by!"}
{"text":"The location of this, uh, location? Stellar. It's prominently featured right on Main Street. Which is to say, Trade Street, since Matthews doesn't actually have a Main Street in the middle of town. It's also at the front of Matthews Station. That means just about whichever way you are headed, you can enjoy whatever they offer - unless you are stuck at the train (do trains still go through Matthews? I assume so - in that case, you might be on the wrong side, and then you're out of luck).  Assuming you do make it in, then it's a nice building, and the roll-up/slide-up/whatever doors are also nice, if the weather should cooperate. And if it doesn't, then they can stay down, providing a bit of shelter. The staff, though they are mostly what you would find at other fast food joints, are generally friendly as well.  Unfortunately where the wheels start to fall off is that the food just isn't that great. It isn't that it's bad, exactly, but if you've had some real BBQ, or even Midwood or Queen City Q (which isn't to say they are bad, but they are a bit more sanitized than a few others), then this is milder still. Put simply, there are better options out there, especially when one of their advertised methods of serving (\"Bama Style\" I think?) is to drown the meat in sauce. That is probably a sign to run the other way."}
{"text":"BBQ that is consistent and tasty.  Nice atmosphere and beer menu.  Best in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Good BBQ is one of my favorite foods, and I love the usual sides as well. That said, I don't really feel the love for Moe's. I wish it was more consistent but it's pretty hit or miss. They're usually out of a few sides and they're just okay. I do like the sweet potato casserole. The meats are very hit or miss, as is the temperature of the meat. Sometimes they're fantastic, other times I wonder if I'm eating the last of the day (at noon).   I've been around 8 times with my family so I think it's a pretty fair review. The service is okay but the way the place is set up leads to long lines at the register. Also, you clean up after yourself, which is usually fine - but I think it's a little pricey to be so casual."}
{"text":"Overall,the food was good. I had the pulled pork sandwich with a side of Mac n cheese and the fried green tomatoes. I do not have anything bad to say about the restaurant, it's just not my favorite BBQ in the area. I am more of a fan of the tomato/molasses BBQ sauce and they only had vinegar based. The sauce, to me, is what really makes the BBQ sandwich and it just wasn't my favorite. I would still recommend this restaurant to anyone in the area."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere!  Lunch was busy but fast service. Recommended the pulled pork and Mac n cheese always. Today I tried the Brunswick stew and that was full of flavor with a little kick. All the flavors married well together. Great place! Type of place I would expect to see on diners, drive ins and dives."}
{"text":"Found the place almost empty last night around 8:30 (Saturday night), which is sad considering that the food is really good.  I liked the variety of BBQ (beef, pork, chicken)  and the variety of sides (about 8 expected and on a chalklboard, another 5-6 more original/unique).  Service was fast and friendly.  Good selection of tap and bottle beer.    Portions were good size.  Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Been to moe's several times and the one thing that they nail everytime is consistency. Everytime I come here I know exactly what I'm getting, which can seem so hard for some restaurants to get the hang of. While their BBQ isn't my all time favorite it's still pretty dang good. I also like the style of ordering they use. Walk up to the counter/bar and start ordering. Sides have all been pretty decent and never have had a problem with service."}
{"text":"We tried moes for the first time back in September. Funny story, it was after a beer festival and we were just looking for a quick bite. I fell in love. My boyfriend was skeptical. We went back recently and I made him a believer. The pulled pork is delicious. The mac and cheese is amazing. The daily sides are always incredible. The craft beer choices are also on point. Some people are disgruntled by the minimal service but that's just the way the place is designed and those people who whine about it are just lazy. What they've got works. This is one of our favorite spots in Matthews."}
{"text":"Awesome BBQ, huge selection of sides, and local craft beer offerings. Completely rethinks the idea of homemade BBQ and makes it slightly more \"of the times\" - we will be back for more! Try the slaw, macaroni and cheese, and pulled pork BBQ sandwich."}
{"text":"Went on a Friday night. Had the ribs,collards and smoked cabbage. Was really impressed with the food. Ribs were competition worthy. Not fall of the bone but really tender and good. House made BBQ sauce was spot on."}
{"text":"We absolutely love Moe's!! The food is cooked and seasoned to perfection...all of it. From the BBQ (lots of variety!) down to the banana pudding and everything in between (tons of sides to chose from). They've got good craft beers on top and great beer specials. Kids eat free on Mon off of the regular menu :)  Moe's is impeccably clean inside and the food is ultra fresh. This restaurant has a lovely staff who will go above and beyond to make sure you feel at home.   The decor is tasteful with a light bright open feel to the interior. Excellent outdoor seating w/ a nice view as well.  We love you Moe's Original, keep up the good work!!"}
{"text":"Downtown Matthews on the main drag in front of the library area. I had the chicken platter which was smoked and has this great dipping sauce. The cole slaw was of the vinegar variety which I usually don't like but was crunchy and sweet with mustard seeds throughout. Very good! My other side was potato salad that was tasty but was 1/2 frozen! (how so they do that or not realize that before they serve it).  My husband had  the catfish sandwich that he loved, topped with pickles and slaw. Lots of unique local beers and a full bar.   Wait staff was not overly friendly and one of the waitress was huffy. Oh well-the bartender was nice. They had all the SEC games on the multiple tv's.   Casual dress, good food, plentiful portions, and average prices. We will go here again when we are in downtown Matthews and looking for BBQ."}
{"text":"Great BBQ, great sides, cute interior.  If they have beer braised cabbage... get it!!!"}
{"text":"We've been here a couple of times, it is a little expensive, like everybody says on their reviews, but I think the taste for barbecue is all over the place, people love 12 bones not a fan, Briggs in Shelby is old school, we have eaten at plenty more, but I can say moe is pretty taste and the sides seem small but that because of what they are served in, corn bread is different so people have problems with it, I would recommend it to anyone and let them decide... Pork it on"}
{"text":"My first time here! I travel and finding this place has made my day! I'm hard to please when it comes to BBQ and the pulled pork sandwich had me licking my fingers! The meat, oh so good and the sides were rib-sticking. Now mentioning this to my wife, we will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Got the Triple wide plus ribs for two, beans, slaw, mac & cheese, cornbread, and banana pudding.  Unfortunately for Moe's I'd eaten at Smokey's in Raleigh two days ago. Smokey's is great, Moe's was just another chain BBQ place serving commercial food.  By the way forget about ordering the Banana pudding, it tastes like paste.  Moe's did score high on friendly fast service."}
{"text":"Never again. Will only go to Asheville location.  Pork was bland and dry. The cornbread was dry, tasted freezer burnt and cold too...Have been to most bbq places around here by now, Moe's in Asheville is by far the best. Everything is fresh, hot and flavored perfectly.  With the exception of maybe Midwood, we are done wasting our money on bbq..I don't get all of the rave reviews over some of these mediocre bbq places. Dry food isn't ok. Bland food isn't normal. Will bbq at home until I get back to Asheville. Best coleslaw ever there too. No complaints about them at all, they do it right and they are the only place that seems to have really high standards and it shows. I cannot tell you how many places the pork is dry and the beans could've come out of a can...MOES in Asheville,  trust me!"}
{"text":"I don't know why I waited so long to come here for a lunch destination.   Yes, you North Carolina barbecue snobs can argue that this is a chain restaurant and therefore the food must not be authentic. I will tell you this, for under nine bucks, I was able to get a pulled pork sandwich side of collards and a drink and left satisfied.   The collards had big chunks of sausage in them and there was a sign saying what local farm they came from today.   Order your sandwich \"Bama style\" and they will throw coleslaw and a pickle on top.   The only disappointing part about this meal is when it was all gone.   The atmosphere is relaxed but the service was still good as well as the food. My last name is Bacon so I know good pork. Fact."}
{"text":"Happened to pass by when leaving a wedding.  Since it's my desire to try every BBQ establishment in Charlotte,  I thought this was the perfect opportunity.  Wasn't disappointed.  The food was reasonably priced  and they had the basic menu selections you'd expect to find at a BBQ spot.  While I found nothing out of the box spectacular,  everything was tasty.  I got the pulled pork,  Mac and cheese,  collards and the pulled pork egg rolls.  The egg rolls were my favorite (and not because they gave me a double order by mistake).  They were stuffed full and the peach dipping sauce was the perfect compliment.  If I'm ever in the neighborhood again I will go back.  This time to try the smoked wings!"}
{"text":"Used to come here for lunch .. it's was quick and good. Stopped by for quick dinner . Ordered 3 basic pulled pork sandwich platters .. took 35 min for them to bring our order .. food was cold .. I was so disappointed and since we were staving we just didn't have the energy to resolve it ... no management in house, just bunch of high school kids in kitchen ... we were promised a dessert on house for our long wait ... never saw it .. I usually never leave terrible reviews especially about my little towns joint .. but this is I had to post .. just so so disappointed. Food is bland and tasteless .. I wonder if management changed !!! But I sure won't be back to find out ."}
{"text":"Place was pretty clean which is always good. The staff seem to be pretty nice and attentive. Food was ok and they give you a pretty good helping. They also have a bar if you want to grab a drink. Prices are reasonable. Didn't seem to be a long wait."}
{"text":"STRANGE place, unique form of BBQ (I'd consider myself well traveled) and know HOW MANY differences BBQ has across our Nation. First: The set up is quite different...you leave your order at the 'bar'/check out/cashier. That same person is also the waiter, bartender, cashier and when the place is busy...well it is confusing then.  Second:The food~quite pricey for a BBQ joint. I had a wing plate for $11. (to go) this time. The wings were big, cooked well, but no visable BBQ sauce on them. I'm not sure, but there was a teeny cup of something white that might have been some ranchy dsg, but I don't like ranch so I didn't try it. With the platter I chose side of slaw. Sides are also in the same teeny portions as the sauce (I'm disappointed). There was a LARGE brick style piece of cornbread, but the texture was not your usual cornbread density, but more like a sponge and on the dry, tastless side. I think there were jalapenos in it but it was too dry to care about. Unique slaw...with more than enough green pepper & strings of red onion throughout it. It really wasn't a vinegary slaw and absolutely wasn't mayo-based either...their own style I suppose.  Lastly: Their location is right on the main drag in Matthews. BUT where it is situated you can't park at the restaurant, you park in a lot or on the street and walk to the place. NO drive thru available at all, either. I cannot say the food was bad, just not like ANY other BBQ I have ever eaten in any state. For the $$ and the odd way to order/wait...I won't be back any time soon. The young man running the whole show was polite and nice enough, I just think he needs some helpers AND/OR they need a different way to handle busy times."}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time a few months back and had the Catfish strips and corn on the cob and it was DELISH!!! And for dessert I topped it off with the cobbler that was amazing. I cannot wait to go back and eat there again!"}
{"text":"Wow. Really delicious smoked meats and sides. They probably had the best smoked turkey that I've ever eaten. Extremely flavorful and juicy. Pulled pork was good. The marinated slaw was awesome! The baked beans were average though. I thought they were a little too thick and sweet. I'd definitely recommend coming here to eat if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Love this place, great pulled pork. And I honestly love the mac and cheese. Great beer selection and awesome customer service. The banana pudding is on point too. Even if it's a little drive it's one of the best"}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME! Between the food quality and the great quality of local craft beers available , I'm a true fan!! Props to Rebecca and Tiffany for taking care of me every time I visit!!"}
