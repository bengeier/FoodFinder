{"text":"Good Service, great looking restaurant and the food is not bad, on the pricy side but that's totally expected. I would likely go there again."}
{"text":"The four stars are mostly for atmosphere, great patio. Food was all right, good presentation for the arancini. Gnocchi was all right, nothing special. The server was a bit off, she confused my gay guy friend for a girl and was pretty slow with bringing serving utensils, bread, etc. I'd come back maybe to try some of the other dishes."}
{"text":"Me and a friend went for their first Sunday brunch. Besides a few hiccups at the beginning everything was great. The food was fresh and delicious as well as reasonably priced. I had a pizza and my friend had a prosciutto sandwich both were good sized portions and tasted great. Even though there were some mistakes made by the servers you could tell they were doing their best trying to figure out their new roles and were extremely positive, energetic and apologetic. As a former server I know how crazy opening a new restaurant can be while all the kinks are being worked out but you could see everyone working together to do their best. At the end of our meal I'm assuming someone who was the manager or owner came to our table and others around ours asking if everything was ok apologized for any mistakes and asked what we thought of everything. Over all its a great spot and I'd go back again."}
{"text":"The ambience is nice, decor beautiful. But the beer list is pretty much non existent and they only had 2 beers available the night we were there. The food was decent, but portions were quite small and prices high for what it was. Probably won't be returning here..."}
{"text":"Visited this place for dinner with a few friends and we all loved the atmosphere and the decor. Some of my friends are very indecisive so they asked the waitress what they would recommend and she was really thorough and very helpful. I ordered the Risotto Al Funghi ($22) - the presentation was beautiful, very flavourful. I had to eat it really slowly because the dish was fairly small compared to other pasta dishes and I was getting really sad that my dish was ending relatively fast. The Linguine Mare was also very delicious. 

However, be wary that the price you pay may not reflect the portion you get - might have to spend a little more to get full.

Check this place out if you enjoy beautiful decor and food presentation."}
{"text":"The food was passable and the staff was friendly, but why go here? You cannot communicate even with your closest seat mate.

Here is another new restaurant built for no living person. The inept architect paid no heed to sound. The entire place is wrapped in concrete and glass with not a smidgeon of sound attenuation.

The sound level at 7 pm, long before the restaurant was filled, was so high that our own Ontario Department of Labour would allow the workers only 4 h exposure per 24 h.

The manager was very cooperative and, eventually, turned down the sound system a notch, but even that was not enough. 

Most every diner around us sat blankly staring at each other or struggled greatly to talk to each other.

Don't waste your time and money, go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Came here last night for a friends birthday. There was only 5 of us. The food came out at different times. So one of my friends pizza went cold while we waited for everyone else to be served.
The waitress forgot to bring out one of the appetisers, so I had it after my main once I reminded her. She spilt water on the table, ok everyone makes mistakes but it was one thing after another. The pasta was small portions and I didn't see the quality of food as outstanding in comparison to the high prices. The atmosphere was the best part unfortunately the service for the price of food needs improving."}
{"text":"4/5! Great pizzas, salads and apps! Cute place that's near the core but recommend making a reso to guarantee a spot. Enjoy"}
{"text":"My partner and I use to enjoy Citta, but they have recently changed a few things that have completely ruined the restaurant for us. 

We use to go to Citta for the decent wine selection and good dessert, since they have changed management recently they have done away with most of their wine selection and minimized the menu, taking away a lot of the good food. What kind of Italian place sells a cheeseburger?

The music is way too loud and very inappropriate for the type of restaurant, the service was horribly slow, it was a busy Sunday night and there was only one waiter serving everyone.

The food is okay, nothing great, and definitely not worth the price, for a better, slightly more casual experience head to the chain restaurant \"Famoso\" on Bloor, at least there you get better food for a lower price."}
{"text":"Solid edition to the neighborhood! 
Beautiful open space, tables not too small or close together which is kinda rare in this city. 
Ordered a nice valpolicella $60, suggested by our knowledgeable server and was delicious.
She described many dishes in great detail and made some good suggestions. We ordered the artichoke and fried mozzarella appetizers and 2 pizza's. All were pretty good! I wasn't in love with my pizza, it was perfectly cooked and nice crust, but bland.
Service from everyone efficient and attentive but unobtrusive. 
One of my only suggestions would be to have a sampler type meat and cheese plate. You have a ton of good options, but at $7 per choice, im reluctant to try as many as id like. What about a small/large chefs choice option for a set price?
regardless, we will be back!"}
{"text":"amazing food! it opened up right near my house and i go there all the time. pizza and the gnocci are FAB!"}
{"text":"I live in Cityplace and Citta is now officially my new favourite brunch spot. I had the Duck Eggs Benedict which were delicious and also tried a bite of the Margherita pizza which was also good but could have used a bit more cheese in my opinion. I love how you can order coffee for 2 and it comes in a french press! We thought the Caesars were a little pricey but then later found out that they were actually doubles (no wonder we left there in a good mood!) The decor and atmosphere are very cute and inviting and I personally love the round tables because they make for better conversation when you're brunching with friends. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Finally had a chance to try this restaurant near my area. So first of all, the proximity to my place wins points especially in this cold weather. The place was pretty packed, I wonder if they all live around here. It was very noisy, very hard to hold a conversation across the table. We were seated in a round table between the 4 of us, I was only able to hear the person next to me talk. It was like playing telephone, the next person had to pass the message to the next in order for all of us to know what is going on.

Now for the food, we got the arugula salad with fig, pear and hazelnuts. It was pretty good but very small portion. We also got the squash fritter - it was fried squash mixed with some other things that I couldn't identified. I didn't really taste much of the squash and it was pretty blend without the chilli sauce.

For the main, I got the papardelle con funghi - mushroom pasta. The portion was ok, expected a bit more for the price. I don't know if it is because winter and the dish gets cold faster but my pasta got cold after a first few bites.  It must have been the chanterelle mushroom, I don't think I have had it before, but it has this sweet / sour taste to it that made it awkward taste to the pasta. It was still pretty good but not worth the price I paid. I will try another dish next time. They have a few daily special menu that they change every few weeks on top of the regular menu. So there are new things to try.

Overall, the service was good, the food was so-so, price is typical downtown prices - my pasta was $18, mid-range . The atmosphere is dark/romantic and noisy, not a place to go if you have a lot of venting to do. I might try for brunch next time."}
{"text":"it's a nice new place. i went on june 27/15 and their patio wasn't open yet b/c it was still being constructed. the hostess told us their \"real\" opening date would be the first week of july, so it should be ready now. it will be a very nice spot to sit outside and eat--it's set back from the road, but you can watch people going by and see all around the neighbourhood.
we had warm olives as an appetizer, and tried 3 different pizzas for our mains (2 white and 1 red sauce). everything tasted very fresh and the flavours were good. 
nice atmosphere. it was early evening and we had a baby with us--they happily brought us a high chair and there wasn't any attitude about it (and this baby is just starting to talk, so she babbled the whole time we were there, but people seemed cool with it).
if in the neighbourhood, i'd definitely go back."}
{"text":"Oh Citta, your taste is great but your combinations mystify me.  Came to Citta for brunch and ordered  Egg's Benedict.

Good Hollandaise sauce, good tomato focaccia bread that could easily be eaten on its own. Okay, great start. The two together however with runny eggs and roasted red peppers thrown in, completely disguises any of the Hollandaise flavour. It ends up as a mushy mess in your mouth. If you're a senior who has lost your ability to chew or are just plain lazy then this is the meal for you, otherwise skip brunch.

Also not a big fan of the Sunday brunch playlist.  Nirvana's \"Smells like teen spirit\" followed by Backstreet Boys' \"Everybody\"?  Hey don't get me wrong, I like a little Kurt Cobain and boy band music as much as the next person, but again I'm not sure this is the combination mix that goes with a relaxing Sunday brunch at a restaurant attempting to create a 'chic' environment.  

Will I come back for brunch? No Citta, I will stay away from your strange mixtures of both food and music."}
{"text":"Just 6 weeks ago, Città opened in the up-and-coming neighbourhood of CityPlace between Spadina Ave. and Bathurst St. on Fort York Blvd.  Nestled on the main floor of one of the many highrise buildings, this may just become the community's favourite brunch spot on the weekends or a lunch and dinner spot on weeknights!

Stepping into the new Southern Italian restaurant, you'll be greeted by an energetic atmosphere that is open but inviting. There are two wood-fire pizza ovens behind the pastries counter where you'll drool over the bombolini, cannoli, biscotti and muffins that are freshly baked in-house daily.  Also, you'll love the floor-to-ceiling windows take up a good chunk of the entire restaurant that provide natural light during brunch hour!

When they brought out the zucchini muffins, I almost died because I love them and can't have them often unless they're baked at home - there are so many places that sell banana bread but never zucchini for some reason. Now, my prayers have been answered and I can come to Città for my zucchini bread cravings!

What an amazing brunch experience I had at this new spot in Cityplace (the great company helped too)! The staff was very knowledgeable of the restaurant's menu, the space is inviting and beautifully designed and the food was outstanding. I love traditional brunch menu items but it was great to have a not-so-conventional one. My personal favourites: Duck Egg Benedict and Burrata Crostini.

Oh, and I will have to go back soon for the pistachio bombolini  and zucchini olive oil muffins!"}
{"text":"I went here with my boyfriend for a casual Friday night dinner. I loved the atmosphere and decor (very cozy). The staff were all very friendly too. Perfect place for a nice glass of wine and a good meal. I recommend trying one of the pizzas!"}
{"text":"We tried Citta on a whim tonight and were very impressed. The food is original and both our dishes were very good. The atmosphere was calm, the music was good and the server was friendly. No complaints. We only had a pasta dish each so next time we'll try an appetizer and maybe pizza and dessert. Very good addition to the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Went to brunch today and had a great meal. Staff was very friendly and accommodating. Food was deeelish. Shout out to Victoria and Celeste, see you next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"Pizza are thin, crispy and delish. The pepperoncini  relish on the side was a really nice touch an tasted amazing. Service was good. Portions for apps and salads a bit in the small side but everything tasted fresh and cooked to order."}
{"text":"Positive: Well decorated space, and have a good vibe

Negative; The portion is very small and over priced, flavor is bland and dull, the server gives you an attitude if you don't order appetizer and dessert."}
{"text":"I recently attended a blogger brunch to sample some of Chef Heaton's novel menu offerings. To begin, an abundance of freshly baked goods were presented family style, including deliciously moist, fresh zucchini olive oil muffins and  savoury formaggio speck scones. What followed was a seemingly simplistic burrata crostini with wood roasted tomatoes and onion agrodolce, but the flavours were anything but! The crispy textures of the bread, made in house, along with the creamy burrata cheese and sweet and sour agrodolce made this dish a favourite of mine. 

The second course featured succulent duck eggs Benedict with tomato and peperonata on foccacia drizzled with velvety hollandaise sauce, a brunch favourite. Eaten with a side of thick house cured pancetta rashers, the combination was impeccably savoury. I also sampled the mouthwatering baked eggs braciole with tomato, pancetta, gremolata, and short ribs, which was well layered and irresistible. The robust, meaty flavours enhanced that of the baked eggs and it was divine.  
The wood fired patate alla carbonara pizza is a heavier dish with potato, guanciale, eggs, pecorino and bechamel sauce. Contrasting textures of the crispy guanciale and the delicate eggs made the pizza a scrumptious and flavoursome choice. 
A rustic Italian meal would not be complete without a pasta course and the buffalo mozzarella agnolotti did not disappoint, with its rich and tasty sauce topped with freshly grated cheese.

My sweet tooth was satisfied with a delightful assortment of pastries and Italian cookies. The home style cannoli with light, fluffy ricotta filling was pleasantly sweet and enrobed in a crisp outer shell. With hazelnut and chocolatey goodness, the Nutella bomboloni will please any palate, as the delectable doughnuts are freshly baked in house daily. What a way to end the bountiful brunch!
The restaurant features large floor-to-ceiling windows that let in natural light, which floods the elegant and open, airy space. Unique country style patterned serving dishes perfectly reflect the rustic theme of the restaurant. Service is professional, prompt, and I was never left without a drink, be it a Bellini or a spicy Caesar.  
After feasting and enjoying Chef Heaton's innovative brunch menu, I know that Città is well on its way to becoming a neighbourhood gem with its simple, yet appetizing rustic Italian cuisine.

{"text":"Absolutely terrible. I had to change my 5 stars to a 1 star and they're lucky to even get that! This place is under new management as of 2 weeks ago. I originally came here and ate brunch with a few clients/family members. It was horrible. I called and spoke to the manager, Victoria, she said sorry, talked on and on, and finally issued me a gift card for $150.00. I went last night with a colleague of mine and we had dinner. This place is terrible. Food was worse than the brunch food. Service TERRIBLE. Victoria came to my my table once in the beginning and was nonchalant and didn't see to care that I was back for a better dining experience. She mentioned they are changing to a \"pizza bar\". Good luck. I ordered a pepperoni pizza. Horrible. Soggy. Just not good pizza at all. You need to have exceptional pizza if you're gonna specialize in that! I am absolutely dissatisfied with this place. Never going back. The patio is the only thing that is cool."}
{"text":"Expensive price considering the ordinary quality and tiny portion. And service is unprofessional."}
{"text":"I went today for dinner with my friends around 530pm. We were the only ones in the restaurant. The waiter was trying to be nice, but not really, he explained the food when we asked but that was it, very bla service.

We got some starters they were nice, mushroom arancini and calamary.

We got pizzas and one order of pasta, very dispointing flavors for an italian place, plus they were so heavy, so much oil eshh. Not worth the money. Very pretty place but food, sorry guys not good.

I am definately not coming back.

Oh something that I really love was the washroom, super nice and very clean."}
{"text":"Dined during the opening week. I had the pizza which was delicious. The cheese appetizer was very good quality but small portion. This place had a very nice interior decor. The pricing is a bit above average. 20 dollars for the pizza. Server was very nice even though she was just starting out at the restaurant. Overall I will give this place 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"Spelling mistakes on the Italian menu, and apps that are mostly over priced.  8 dollars for 2 crostini? Our $19  pizza was missing Gorgonzola.  They cheese they did bring as a side dish was of lower quality than expected for an Ink establishment.   This place needs better management.   The space and atmosphere is wonderful though."}
{"text":"The food is very disappointing. Very small portions. You can do way better on King West."}
{"text":"A brand new Italian restaurant situated by Spadina, with phenononal service and good food! I understand it literally opened 3 weeks ago and we were very impressed with the ambience, cleanliness and vibe of the place. Great mood and music!

SERVICE
Our plates were cleared and reset between each course and the staff was extremely attentive and professional. The meals came in a very timely manner. Expect VIP treatment when you come!

OVERALL - 
Presentation of food was beautiful. Appetizer portions are somewhat small but not unexpected for fine dining. All food was served with chili oil sauce which was delicious and added a nice kick to the appetizers and entrees. However, with regards to the entrees I found the food a bit bland was was adding the chili oil sauce to appetizers and entrees quite a bit. Nice to go if this place is convenient for you (by Cityplace) but I probably wouldn't go out of my way to come here. 

PRIX FIXE MENU: 
Because we were such a large group, the menu was set to the Prix Fixe Menu (our organizer chose the Option A) so we didn't have much choice in the way of what we could pick from the menu.   How it worked for our group was we had to share the appetizers, and two entrees with another person.   However dessert was individual.  I don't particularly eat very much, so I felt quite full by the end, but I imagine if you were someone that likes larger servings, I probably wouldn't recommend doing the Prix Fixe Menu if this was to be shared between two people with large appetites - you would likely till be hungry afterwards.

APPETIZERS - 
Appetizers we tried included the Beef Crudo (raw beef), Barrata Crostini, and Argula Salad shared between two people. The Beef Crudo was my favourite although there was very little provided on the plate (see my picture attached).

ENTREES - PIZZA - 
Because there were at least four of us, we got to try two pizzas instead of one. We ordered the Di Donata pizza and Consenza pizza. The pizza was good, but not the best that I've had so far in Toronto. I would have liked to try different pizza flavours but again we were limited to the Di Donata and Consenza choices only on the Prix Fixe. But based on the two pizzas I got to sample, I found the taste slightly bland and was having to add some chili sauce on to to give it more flavour.  I probably prefer the flavours from Famoso Neapolitan Pizzeria on Bloor or Pizzeria Libretto on University.

ENTREES - PASTA - 
Because the pair across from us were willing to share, we got try both the the Tagliatelle alla bolognese (traditional meat ragu) and Ricotta gnocchi
(alla pomodoro fresco) and these were okay in terms of taste. Again I put lots of chili oil on it to add a bit more flavour. I preferred the taste of the meat ragu as it was slightly more flavourful. 

DESSERT - Gingerbread Olive Oil Cake:
I prefer sweeter cakes with mousse or icing. This was the only dessert option on the Prix Fix Menu so we didn't have much choice to pick anything else. This tasted like a \"Muffin in Cake form\", if you prefer a bit more bran tasting dessert then this would be a good choice for you.


Downsides:
Downsides, we didn't realize that flat water and bread would charge extra. When I asked for bread for the table, I had to clarify if this was an extra charge - and it was so we declined. This came as a bit of a surprise on the bill with regards to the water. 

- This place is pretty pricey, and we were surprised the Priix Fix Menu required sharing of our meals (although with two entrees this meant we got more variety). I've had better tasting food at lower price venues. It was a neat experience in terms of service and ambience, however it is a new restaurant (having only opened 3 weeks ago at time of writing) and hopefully taste will improve with time and feedback"}
{"text":"Went to Citta recently for my birthday, we were a total of 6. 

I booked a table online, I got a confirmation quite fast and at the time I desired. 

VENUE 4/5

Nice atmosphere, huge space, lots of tables and pleasant decor. I liked that part of the kitchen was open. The music selection was good and not too loud, so it was possible to talk at a normal tone. 

COCKTAILS - WINE 4/5 

They do offer a adequate selection of drinks. Before ordering the food, I tried the 14th Yard, the Corzo Venezia and the Veloce Veloce. All were properly executed and tasty. With my meal, I opted for a glass of Cormons - Pinot Grigio 

FOOD 3/5 

I opted for the Calamari on the daily special menu. It was served with a tomato and olive salsa. Very flavorful, cooked perfectly and OK portion. To go with it I ordered the broccoli that was nicely spiced but a little too tough to chew. 

All of my friends were pleased with the food quality and the presentation. The only thing is that some dishes portions are SMALL for the price. One ordered the daily pasta special (24$) and the size was the one of a appetizer. 

SERVICE 2/5 

Even if we were greeted and seated promptly, there was some issues with the service. We all felt some attitude when we declined to have appetizers or desserts. We all had several drinks and bottles of wine, but we felt in the attitude of the waiters that it wasn't enough. We found it a little unpleasant. 

The manager came to greet us, and was a little awkward in wishing me happy birthday, it felt borderline awkward, like he wasn't too sure how to say it or just couldn't care less. If you don't feel like wishing me happy birthday, that's totally cool with me, pleased don't force yourself. 

Overall, it's a nice addition in City Place. I might go again with a smaller party to give it another chance."}
{"text":"i went for lunch on monday and it was a pleasant experience. 

the décor is very nice. the room is bright and spacious. i like their choice of music and when i went it wasn't too loud. my server (erica i believe) was friendly and knowledgeable. 

i had a wide selection of food and it was all delicious. no complaints about anything really. fresh ingredients, properly seasoned, well cooked... you can't really go wrong if you do that. 

if i had to rank città on food against other \"chains\". it's better than libretto, mercatto and terroni (but città is a bit more expensive). worse than buca (but buca is more expensive and their service bugs me)."}
{"text":"If you are craving authentic Italian and live near Cityplace, then give this place a chance. Although a little on the pricey side, the pizzas here are fresh and unique, and they also have some great pasta dishes as well. Service is good and they have a solid drink and beer menu. It's owned by the same guys who own the Fox and Fiddle just down the street.  You can expect to pay about $80.00 for two including a couple of drinks. If they dropped their prices on their pizzas I would definitely come here more often."}
{"text":"I rarely leave bad reviews but this place was very disappointing. Here's the breakdown: 
1. Service was slow and it was not a busy night.
2. The food was not good. My boyfriend and I both ordered pizza and they were both flavourless and runny towards the centre.
3. The price is way too high for the caliber of the food. Way, way too high.

I will state that the patio is quite nice and surrounded by glass so if it windy there's no impact to your life or hair to sit on the patio. The drinks are also pretty good so my recommendation is grab a drink there before grabbing dinner across the way at hunters landing."}
