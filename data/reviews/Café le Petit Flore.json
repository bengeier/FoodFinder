{"text":"I went for breakfast so I can't comment on supper. It took a while for our orders to be taken down. Then we were asked to change table. When we got our orders, they were wrong but at that point we were starving. My girlfriend's bagels were burned. Service was bad, trying to get a water refill was impossible. They took our food away before we were finished, didn't even ask if we were done. To be honest, the food wasn't good, it was edible but not French. You can get much better food and service elsewhere. The bathroom however, is very nice. Did I leave a tip? Yes, learn how to treat your customers, pay attention when they order and ask before taking their food away."}

{"text":"Très bon bistro de quartier. Cuisine française/fusion. Service toujours impeccable et rapport qualité-prix excellent. Puisque je travaille dans le secteur, j'y vais régulièrement. Table d'hôte du midi abordable et service rapide. Menu variable quotidiennement. Table d'hôte du soir également intéressante. Belle ambiance, surtout depuis des récentes rénovations. Il faudrait afficher des photos plus récentes de l'endroit...
J'adore cet endroit et le recommande régulièrement à des amis et clients. Croyez-moi, certains restos du centre-ville peuvent aller se rhabiller si on compare!!!"}
{"text":"The food was ordinary. I had eggsbdnedict. They were good but nothing special. Only amazing part was the sauce. Small plate. No toast or potatoes only fruits. 
The service was very good but getting our plates took about 1 hour. Mind you it was packed. 
Ps the waiter are super charming."}
{"text":"Lovely ambiance in the evenings. Nice for a neighbourhood date night. This café offers espressos, croissants and paninis and great French fare later in the evenings."}

{"text":"Poutine au canard est excellente. 
Joli style de restaurant. 
On a réservé pour un groupe de 14 et le service a été quand même rapide pour un dimanche bien bondé."}
{"text":"A fancy neighbourhood bistro that's just perfect for a romantic date! Last time we went for dinner, we had the salmon tartare, and the presentation was on point: the plate looked like a work of art! Wish I had taken a picture... My compliments to the chef! I also enjoyed their cake selection. The service was brisk and courteous too. All in all, it made for a very reasonably priced birthday supper, in a fine bistro that feels a lot fancier than its price point. Pottage + salmon tartare + slice of cake + coffee = $35 per person, tax & tip included."}
{"text":"J'aime la deco , le soir les lumieres doivent etre belles, café avec grand choix des vins. Bcp de tables , agreable some toute."}
