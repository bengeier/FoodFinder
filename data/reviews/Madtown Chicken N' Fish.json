{"text":"Super disappointed yet again with a small business local eatery. (My last review was Mr. Tortas on Cottage Grove Road.) 

It's a toss up on whether this place should be 1 or 2 stars.  The food is edible- though bland- so 2 stars it is.

I had the large shrimp meal.  The menu says the meal includes soda, bread, and coleslaw. I thought it sounded good. The guy brought my food out.  I opened up the container to add ketchup, etc., and noticed he had not included the bread or coleslaw. I asked for it and he gave them to me. He seemed surprised that I wanted what was on the menu. The bread was a plain slice of white bread. Not even a dinner roll? The coleslaw smelled funky and I wasn't sure how old it was so I actually tasted it and did not finish the whole thing. The meal basically consisted of a bunch of fried popcorn shrimp plus some french fries. Shrimp was bland and did not even really taste like shrimp. This place does not even want to pay for brand-name sodas: it has Faygo generic sodas. 

There is nothing special nor tasty about this place. They just set up a kitchen, have a food service provider, and serve you cooked food from the food service company. Nothing distinctive nor tasty about this place. If you want to start a food restaurant business carry out place in Madison, at least put some effort into it to make it seem original or interesting or tasty."}
