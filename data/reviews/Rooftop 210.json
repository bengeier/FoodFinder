{"text":"The DJ sucks so hard, great bar location but the worst dj in America.  He is also there for Alive after 5 so be careful because he sucks."}
{"text":"This review only concerns their New Year's Eve party.   I was completely hussled out of the $78 I paid for my ticket. Line to get in took at least 30 minutes, closer to an hour if you came later than the start time. People without tickets rushed in at one point. Coat check was $5 extra once inside and they quickly ran out of hangers. \"Top Shelf Open Bar\" turned out to be bottom shelf liquors. The several bars were constantly out of sprite, tonic, various liquors, etc. Venue was way overcrowded. Bartenders were rude and lied about what was available. Bathroom lines were insane and became utter chaos until bouncers got involved near midnight. Avoid this place."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! My friends and I went on a Friday evening around 5pm and it was fantastic, service was great, DEENA is awesome. She is fun and energetic and she ensures you have the best service. I am a lover of rooftops and this place has a great view of the city! Drinks are also reasonably  priced."}
{"text":"Lousy and rude service. My friends and visited during a recent event they held. While there, one of the bartenders served us a round of tequila instead of the lemon drops we had ordered. When questioned about it, the bartender became rude and defensive instead of admitting and correcting her error. She also proceeded to charge us for the premium liquor she used.   I brought this issue to Rick on their management team. He did not respond to my complaint until days later, after I had already made a secondary follow up to my initial email and phone call.  You will get terrible service here. You will be trusted off and rudely disregarded. I recommend you spend your money and time anywhere else."}
{"text":"I went here for Alive after 5. Being from out of town, the younger and open environment made it easy to get to know people. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I'd be interested in seeing what this place is like on a normal evening. The New Years Eve party left a bit to be desired. It was OVERCROWDED and there were ZERO seating areas to be seen. Sad to say there were not enough staff on hand to service the restrooms and monitor the crowd, bars, or zippers in the tents. People were sneaking in without tickets. The photo booth was a terrific edition to the evening with fun props to use provided. Another plus was once you were finally able to get s drink, it was not weak :)"}
{"text":"This review is for the NYE event only. I had a college friend coming to town to ring in the New Year and we were excited to find the $80 VIP all inclusive event on Groupon. Unfortunately the deal that seemed too good to be true ended up being just that.  The night started off well with us taking advantage of the VIP early entry. I tried to order a Makers on the rocks, but was told I had to mix it (I believe they were trying to avoid allowing people to have shots). No biggie I actually get what they were trying to do, though later in the night I saw a bartender serving shots to the scantily clad. My boyfriend and visiting friend ordered vodka redbulls (which later in the night cost them a $2 upcharge) and we went to stake out a table in the VIP area. At this point major disappointment set in, since the chairs along the sides (with small coffee tables) were just for those who paid the VIP table price. At this point I was glad we got half priced tickets because if we had paid full price and the only \"VIP area\" was the little buffet (standing room only) area they set up I would have been pretty livid.  As the night wore on it became harder to get drinks, and the quality of the drinks available was rapidly declining. I had the unfortunate experience of needing to use the restroom, which was more like a mosh pit of teenagers trying to shove their way to Justin Bieber. Seriously, the women behind me were shoving and those in front were shoving back or yelling about being shoved. I really should have found an alternative option at that point because by the time I finally got inside the restroom I found a wet and puke covered floor.  I came back to find my boyfriend fuming because the bartender flipped him off after he politely requested service after waiting for the bartender to serve several waves of women. Since it was close to midnight we decided to stick it out, and I had to chase down a manager to find out where to get our promised champagne toast - unfortunately at the crowded bar. I managed to work my way through to the bar to bring back some for the group unfortunately missing midnight. We raised a belated toast and drank...moscato.  In the end the company completely failed to live up to what the ticket was supposed to provide. The top shelf liquor disappeared early in the night (as did mixers, like cranberry juice). The champagne toast was not what was promised for those who were able to hunt some down."}
{"text":"New Years Eve here was a major disappointment. The tickets we purchased indicated that we would be served top shelf liquor with this all inclusive ticket, but we were served some no-name vodka, and the Crown Royal ran out within 30 minutes of being there. There was also no fruit to go with any of the cocktails.  The bathrooms were absolutely atrocious. Honestly, I have never seen anything like it, and I hope I never do again. Generally speaking, it was poorly executed and a colossal waste of money for my group of 15. I won't be back."}
{"text":"I love love love the layout of this place and the view is spectacular. Several bars, pumping music, big screen tvs. This is definitely a one stop shop!!! Oh and did I mention the view...breathtaking!!"}
{"text":"Attended 2015 New Years Eve Bash, and I was extremely disappointed.  A group of friends and I thru in for a VIP table for 1k, and our hostess Haley was great, on point the whole night, she made the night bearable; but that is unfortunately we're my praise stops. The event was advertised to include top shelf liquor and hors d'oeuvre, this was a blatant lie.  They served watered down well liquor drinks, and the food was horrendous, topped with a DJ that screwed up the count down (didn't even know we were counting till it was to late), as well as a couple bumbles during the night.  Now I need to make a point about the restrooms; any establishment in the food and beverage industry is judged on four points, food, drinks, service and restrooms.  The restrooms where absolutely disgusting, crap and puke everywhere, with no thought to organization, or servicing to control the crowd.  Actually watch a brawl almost take place twice.  Which brings me to my last point, rather then enjoying my self, I worried every time my wife went to the restroom.  If you pay that much money safety should not be a concern.  I truly hope the event planner reads these reviews, because this needs to change, things need to be classed up for events such as this.  Thanks for your time."}
{"text":"The only good thing about this spot is IT IS FREE, but you wonder why? The music sucks! We tried requesting a song that everyone could dance to and got denied. Like really? The DJ is supposed to be good to the crowd? But anyways, this place is whack. If your low budget, then its ok.  But if your looking for a good popping time, not the best place to go"}
{"text":"The bar was fine.  Spacious and not overly crowded.  There were a good number of people there, but just didn't seem like much going on, not incredibly lively for what I was expecting.    However, BE WARE THIEVES!!!  My phone and wallet were stolen here.  I was hoping they were simply misplaced, but two weeks after my phone and wallet disappeared, \"Find my iPhone\" informed me my phone was FINALLY turned on in Shijiazhuang, Hebei.  In case you don't know, that's right outside of BEIJING.  Not Charlotte.  Not NC.  Not even America.  BEIJING.    So yeah, if you go there, guard your belongings with your life.  I contacted them immediately to see if my wallet/phone were somehow still there and it took them several days to verify they weren't with the bathroom attendant.  Little frustrating as I had no wallet or phone during that time period in hopes they still had it and I didn't have to replace everything.  I was not a priority.  I get I'm not super important to them, but the customer service on lost belongings left something to be desired."}
{"text":"My first visit to Rooftop 210 was on the 4th of July. It was a great experience! Friendly service, great crowd, and good music. There is a fun dance environment of people in their early 30's.   This might make me really sound like a \"small town girl\", but I also just loved the idea of having a club on top of a roof! It's such a great environment that makes you really feel like you are in a big city.  If you are wanting to have a fun \"club like\" setting, then this is definitely a place for you. Not too crazy, or loud, just fun and a great environment.   The only thing that was kind of off putting was the fact that prices of drinks weren't listed anywhere! No menus, or prices of any sort. The prices are pretty average, so it's not the biggest deal. But just an FYI!"}
{"text":"After getting out of a late movie at SMG, we stopped in for a drink, met a few people and played some cornhole. This was the first time I've been back here in a while. I forget what they called it previously, but the new management/ layout seems to be working for them- or at least better than I remember it. It was pretty packed here on a Saturday night.   The interior/ main bar setup has a friendly wait staff- quick to get you a drink, even on a busy night. There are both tables & seating at the bar, and a few TV's.   Outside you have a lot going on. Quite a few lawn games set up, stage, outdoor bar, etc. It really is a good spot to have a drink, late night, on a fair weather night, play games, meet new people/ socialize.   Other than that, it's a pretty average bar that has a great location uptown- in the middle of Epicentre, on a rooftop. Can't beat that."}
{"text":"I have been here and have seen the lack of respect for patrons. Do not go here for your own safety."}
{"text":"Abby Crowe at Rooftop 210 has been a pleasure to deal with.  She has gone out of her way to fix  problems that were not caused by her or her establishment.   Amazing to see this type of hospitality.   Thank you for a great experience."}
{"text":"Down for a friend's bachelor party. Was told to go to Epicentre, place to be in Charlotte. They weren't wrong! Lots of bars, bowling, food and drinks. We went into Rooftop last night around 1030. Atmosphere is great, cornhole, outside tables, open space. My only complaint was the drink prices, ordered 2 rounds of draft beer, PBR was $4 and Corona Light was $6. A little expensive compared to other places in Epicentre. They also don't carry Budweiser products yet the stage the DJ was on had a backdrop of Bud Light.  We will definitely return on our next visit to Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Great location! The crowd that it attracts on Fridays are mainly those in their mid 20s to 30s, so I really enjoy the setting. Would rate 5 stars except the last time I found out that their piña coladas were $9 instead of $6 that I paid the first time I went. Because prices are not listed anywhere, I'm not sure if they are truly $9 or if my bartender charged me incorrectly. Ended up buying two for myself and one for a friend that 2nd visit, so it was kind of a disappointment when the $6 piña coladas I had been raving about to my friends ended up being $9 the week later."}
{"text":"I wish I could rate this place zero stars. Came here on a Thursday night while visiting the Charlotte area with my bf. This place has great potential because it's on the roof with a good amount of space and they play decent music but that's about where anything good stops. Upon walking up to the bar my bf and I saw that there were approximately 8 girls working behind the bar so we obviously tried to flag one of them down. One girl was making drinks directly in front of us and we tried to get her attention and she walked right away. Two other girls looked directly at us as we tried to flag them down and again, they walked away to help someone else who had just walked up to the bar. Not one of them had a smile on their face and they looked miserable to be there. We finally got one girl's attention who seemed nicer to make us drinks. They were just OK, tasted a bit watered down to me (we got tequila pineapples). I'm not sure if it's because my bf is black and I'm white that we were not served for so long or what but it really killed my mood. We quickly drank our drinks and left to go to Howl which was right across from this place & had MUCH better service. I wouldn't return here or recommend this place."}
{"text":"Rooftop 210 recently started a series of silent disco but don't be mislead by the title, it's not silent at all. We arrived and entry was very unorganized. Tables were not set up in an orderly fashion. If you need to ID, wavier then give headphones then line it up that way. We finally got to the point of receiving headphones one person out of our group of 4 didn't get one, apparently they were out. One of the 3 headphones we were given were broken but you had to sign a waiver that you would pay $60 for broken or lost headphones. We start listening to the stations and well there is only 2, there were suppose to be 3. When we first arrived there was only one DJ on stage, he was play SLOW rap. Then at the SILENT DISCO there was loud music playing which was also the Green Station... mhmmm I thought this was a silent thing?! The staff behind the bar was very nice and we received great service. The people organizing this were not friendly and were very unorganized. I asked multiples times for more upbeat music to be played because it was ALL 80s music when we arrived and very mainstream the rest of the time. I think they need to re-evaluate the term Silent Disco!  We have also been to the venue to alive after 5 which has been fine but underwhelming. I would honestly stay away from here! It's a tourist trap!!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty cool to check out on a weekend night.. Good views and they play a fun variety of music. They have a dance floor if you feel like dancing. They have corn hole too.Not too keen on the mixed drinks... Expensive and small.   Not too bad of a place to sit down and have a drink surrounded by the city skyline"}
{"text":"Pro: it's free, Con: you get what you (don't) pay for. The music is pretty dull and you can't really request anything good. The servers at the bar are incredibly rude and the drinks are subpar. The scenery is great but the actual dance floor is deteriorating. Many floor tiles were missing and it caused already drunk people to trip. Not worth it. Pay the 15 to go to Suite."}
{"text":"Came here for the cider fest, and for the price that we paid it was totally worth it. The bar had a ton of floor space for people to mingle or dance, and there was live music for a few hours. Bathroom was clean (yay) and had lots of stalls so never had to wait!"}
{"text":"Nice bar at the top of the Epicenter! Just discovered this place not too long ago at Alive After Five. The drinks are sort of pricey(not anymore than a nice restaurant) with not a ton of options but the music is fun and the views are awesome. There aren't a lot of tables but most people stand and just hangout anyways if they aren't on the dance floor or the bar.   Great place to go after dinner, movie, or just hanging out downtown. Only reason I don't go more is because of having to pay for parking! Definitely worth giving a try."}
{"text":"Overpriced drinks and I was physically grabbed by a female bartender because she thought I didn't tip her. She told me to \"get the fuck out if I'm not gonna tip\" the worst part is that I tipped her a decent amount."}
{"text":"I had such a wonderful time here. The music was fun to dance to and the service (even though busy) was FANTASTIC! I went to the same part of the bar where Victory served me and she was wonderful. Overall a very fantastic experience and (being from Charleston, SC) I would very much love to come party here again. I would recommend!"}
{"text":"An alright spot to go to, with not much of a rooftop view. The space is pretty big, with a mix of random music being played, haha.   I ordered a specialty cocktail but they were out of cucumbers ('eh) so just opted for their gin 'n tonic!"}
{"text":"Bouncer almost cost the owner a lot of money. Good thing he was punk enough to give his crappy apology. Hopefully they will find better workers in the future. Needless to say I will no longer patronize the establishment. At least he isn't on welfare I suppose. MAGA. Ps bouncer. Go to school get an education and do something with your life instead of being a PAB. Let me see you outside of work."}
{"text":"I went last night for a Lil Boosie concert I was working VIP check in for Rooftop 210. The dance floor and bathrooms are very spacious. I had a lot of fun and will be back in the future. Great job Rooftop 210!"}
{"text":"Now this is more like it! We had come to this busy little area of downtown to enjoy a drink somewhere, and we were a bit surprised by all of the security and the lines to get into places. We aren't the velvet rope type of people, and we don't generally dress up to get a drink somewhere. Rooftop 210 was just what we needed.  It's a laid back environment, games of cornhole being played on one side, and a number of benches and tables on the other for outdoor seating on a nice evening. The beer selection isn't great by any stretch, but they will probably have something to suit your tastes. Bartenders were busy but friendly."}
{"text":"We've all been there, an accidental misplacement if a wallet or a purse.  What goes into a situation like this? Shoot I'm an idiot? Yes. However in my case Robert Kerr JR exemplifies honesty integrity and sincerity. I lost my wallet and while I wasn't frantically panicking (in my mind I lost it) he calmly addressed the situation which ultimately led to me finding it.  Most of the other bouncers at clubs were just brushing me off. I got really lucky. This place is a five star for music, drinks and especially Robert Kerr (no relationship to Golden State Warriors head coach Steve Kerr although with his greatness you'd think that)!"}
{"text":"No seats. Poor service. And owners who don't care about your well being. (Many stories going around about patrons being roofied and thieves.). Do yourself a favor and just avoid."}
{"text":"We were one of FOUR people in the bar area.  There were more bartenders behind the bar than there were customers.  I sat there for a GOOD 10 minutes (likely more) with absolutely NO ATTENTION from any of the [at least] 6 girls behind the bar \"working.\"  They stood there, LITERALLY, twirling their hair and eating snacks...while, what looked to be, management walked around, allowing it to go on.  VERY DISAPPOINTING.  We paid our tab (AFTER FLAGGING SOMEONE DOWN TO ASK FOR IT) and moved to Howl at the Moon and got much better service, all night long."}
{"text":"One of my friends was DJing at rooftop last night for their Silent Disco, so I decided to go check it out. It was a blast! They were well organized and had a great process in place for the pick up and return of the headphones. The view from the rooftop is beautiful- you are out in the open and able to see the skyscrapers surrounding you. The headphones were on a \"one in one out\" return policy so the place was full, but there was still plenty of room for hundreds of people to move around. It never took longer than 1-2 minutes to get a drink when going to the bar. Highly recommend that you check out the silent disco they host!"}
{"text":"Went to a silent disco here and had so much fun! I love how big the space is.  Def going back."}
{"text":"I love going to RoofTop 210, I went to Alive After 5 on Thursday. This is one of my FAVORITE events!! Great Music as always! The weather was impeccable!! Thank goodness.  I loved the bands!! Unfortunately, the music Legend Prince passed away. The band played several hits as everyone sung along. There's always a good crowd here, which I love.  Word of advice--dress to impress when you come here. Everyone is typically dresses to the NINE!! This isn't your regular Nine to Five attire. Dressy Casual. This may work in your favor considering most of the nightclubs have a dress code.  Parking-- $10 at the EpiCentre. I typically park at the Charlotte school of law, normally $5. Short distance away--however, Ladies bring your fold-away slippers.   Charlotte Heating up everyone! Make sure you check this place out--the Triple Tequila Sunrise is my drink of choice!!"}
{"text":"Seems like a great place, probably lots of fun. Been in town for a week and they have ruined my stay at the Omni Hotel, DO NOT stay here. You will have to listen and feel the bass from your favorite 70's, 80's, 90's, 00's, and 10's."}
{"text":"Gets points for atmosphere. Really the only saving grace.   Drinks are ridiculously over priced and come in small plastic cups. Selection is also terribly limited so you're stuck paying $8 for a small plastic cup of jack & coke (beer selection is basic too).   Music varies from decent to awful. Over-loud and the \"DJ\" is usually just hitting play from iTunes.   I understand it's the Epicentre and you get what you get but is it so hard to put a little effort in? We should expect better from our bars.   Yes the atmosphere is amazing. It's a GIANT rooftop in the heart of the city and the views are spectacular. In a city of covers, it's nice they don't charge one and the tables are nice. Just sucks the drinks are such an awful value and the vibe is nothing different than you'd expect at Suite or Bubble"}
{"text":"Spacious with live music, fun bar and a chill vibe...  That's Rooftop 210.    I like that the bar area is covered.  Of course, this gets packed and if you come after the music starts it might be hard to get a drink.  The bartenders were nice and having fun themselves.    Nearby bathrooms were clean.  A nice beginning, middle or ending to any visit to the Epicentre."}

{"text":"This is a good venue. I've been twice.   One just happened to have a silent disco which was new to me and very fun!  The second was for a special charity show featuring Little Big Town. That seemed to be a let down for many people due to the length of the show and the stage position. It was also a complete disaster trying to get into this event! Up here, nope can't go here. Down the stairs, Up the stairs, in part of Whisky River, up the stairs through another venue, check in and get wristbands inside another bar, outside, cross the bridge and boom finally into the private event... Say what?  Cool spot in the \"Epic Center\" that also comes with cool views of the concrete jungle known as Uptown Charlotte."}
{"text":"The rooftop idea is awesome and the venue itself is really cool. There isn't too much of a view just because it's right in the middle of the city so the skyscrapers surround it. It's located near a few others bars in the Epicentre which is nice.  However, the staff was horrible. A friend of mine and I ordered the same drink- a Long Island iced tea for $8. We ended up with two very different drinks from two different bartenders. Mine was in a large cup and my friends was in a small cup. Hers was essentially all coke and mine was a true LIT. After I brought the discrepancy to one of the bartender's attention, he told me he was \"too busy to remake a drink that he didn't make\". It wasn't that busy. He had two people waiting in his corner of the bar, at most. It would've taken a minute to remake the drink and he just refused. It was rude and left me with a bad impression of the place. Additionally, we witnessed two bouncers drag a guy on the ground out of the bar. His head was just dragged along the concrete. It really was not okay. Yes, he needed to be removed, but this was not the way to do it. I don't think we will ever return here."}
{"text":"The Pavillion got a facelift, new name and concept.  You've probably ventured here for things like Alive After Five, the Elevate Awards, Silent Disco, etc. However, it's more than just an place for events... it's now a regular uptown bar as well.  Full bar, tvs and a great view of the city. Even better: the people watching at the EpiCentre. This may be better than people watching at the airport.   Things you should know: parking here is expensive. Plan to pay a minimum of $10. I recommend light rail or parking a block away at the Fitzgerald's/Wake Forest deck. East walk from there. It's usually only $5.   I used this space to throw a baby shower a couple months ago. We hung paper lanterns and just did some simple decorations. It was gorgeous and the pictures turned out fabulous.  If you're out and about uptown looking for a patio to enjoy a cold drink... stop by here."}
{"text":"Very big floor . More bar available . Good song collections. Good place to chill and dance. I had a good time."}
{"text":"I throughly enjoyed my experience last night at Rooftop 210. My sisters and I attended the  Rick Ross party that was held during the CIAA tournament week and the professionalism of all of the staff members at Rooftop 210 exceeded our expectations. Everyone was extremely courteous and friendly. We did not have to wait in line at all. The bartenders were amazing and the drinks were made perfectly. I would most definitely attend another event here. My overall experience at this venue was outstanding! Much different than some of the other venues I have gone to for parties during CIAA. Keep up the great customer service!"}
{"text":"Nice rooftop location with reasonably priced drinks. Very busy but missing something that I can't put my finger on. Maybe too big and impersonal which is okay if you are in group but not so good if you are on your own."}
{"text":"New Years Eve here couldn't have been any worse here.    The tickets we purchased indicated VIP, with passed apps and buffet early in the night (which I couldn't find), liquor was cheap and barely mixed into drinks (if you were even able to make it to the bar to order).  We arrived about 9:30pm with a group of 10, after standing in a line that wrapped around the upstairs on the Epiccenter.  They didn't even ID us when we walked into the covered area.  They sold way to many tickets and there was barely any STANDING ROOM.  The bathroom was disgusting and had a bunch of 21 year old girls falling all over themselves and getting sick.  Poorly executed and a definite waste of money.   We left by 10:00pm to find somewhere more enjoyable to spend NYE.  Would not recommend going here and I will never be back."}
{"text":"Really like this place! Located on the top floor of Epicentre, this is a open air venue with music and a few high top tables to sit (great for taking a break from your heels girls). They do have one stationary bar and another mobile one but essentially there is no indoor feature to this place (something to consider with the weather). If you like the option of music, good views of Charlotte and what seemed to be a little more sophisticated crowd, more likely would love this place. I did."}
{"text":"I know a bit about rooftops. I live in a building with the best view of the skyline and the coolest restaurant, and I work in the tallest building in the city. But I didn't know there's such a nice spot to get tipsy and dance with friends! So, there IS a nice outdoor rooftop with a bar and a DJ here in Charlotte. Awesome. Now, go! Rooftop 210 is a pretty cool place."}
{"text":"I have been four times now and every time the bathrooms were very dirty and the dj was awful. Drinks are overpriced. The music was all over the place like he was trying to please everyone which is simply impossible. The bouncers were unnecessarily rude and completely unprofessional. The actual venue is great which is why I think people go, but there need to be major changes made."}
{"text":"This place is extremely unorganized and dirty. We went here at the beginning of the bar crawl and it's was disgusting. I was extremely disappointed with this bar."}
{"text":"Want to get ripped off and disrespected? Then come to Rooftop 210!! The prices for drinks have raised and gotten outrageous. $6 for a bud light can is a complete rip off. The bathrooms are always disgusting, dirty, and not stocked although a bathroom attendant sits there all night. The men"}
{"text":"Go to spot to get your groove on! Silent disco is one of my favorite events to look forward to, nothing like putting on some headphones and zoning out to your kind of music."}
{"text":"Great view and booze. Love going here on weekends for a drink with friends. Alive After 5 is always a must when it's going on. Staff is super friendly and environment is always clean. I also recommend going to any events that they have going on from time to time such as beer fest or cider fest!"}
{"text":"I feel like this is the place that advertises events that sound really awesome and end up being just mediocre. I've been there for cider fest twice now and they mostly have cider from national brands. There were a handful of craft ciders there, but it didn't feel like a local event. It was also very loud and crowded. We were also there for wing fest which was a little bit of a better experience. There were more local restaurants represented at it, but it was still loud and crowded. Overall, I think the large events like this are much better at Symphony Park in South Park or in South End. I probably won't come back again."}
{"text":"Very nice venue in a great location. I came to the CLT s'macdown here yesterday. Although it got very packed toward the end, it seemed to easily hold a huge group of people. It was great that it was outside, yet provided tents and heaters since it was a little chilly. There were several TVs in the bar area playing various football games. It also had awesome views of downtown Charlotte. Bathrooms were large and clean. If I was looking for a place to host an event downtown I would definitely consider Rooftop 210!"}
{"text":"The  EPiCentre is a beautiful place, but like most of the other areas in Charlotte, NC it is full of racism. Rooftop 210 dress policy is ridiculous for a club that advertises for the college crowd, no holes in your jeans policy really? I was turned away from this dry club.  The clubs in the EPi Centre are over price for starters. The clubs have policies which they can change at will to keep anyone who they don't like out. This issue mostly being the case for Black and Brown people. When it is Speed street week, the clubs want you to dress like you're on a commercial for GAP, AF, American Eagle. When they are having the NAACP tournament, you can dress like your on a P. Diddy video in the 90's in getting in everywhere.   I need for the EPiCentre to just to put a White only sign up when they only want white people to come, then put a  #Colors only sign up when its okay to come party."}

{"text":"We are pretty new to Charlotte and we had visited this place the previous Saturday. We enjoyed ourselves so much the first time that we decided to go here this Saturday as well. However, we were turned away at the door for dress code this Saturday and nothing was even wrong with our dress. We dressed respectfully in button up shirts and pants. However, the man at the door was very rude and said I can't let you in like this.   This business lost my business for life. I will never attend a place that openly discriminates on people's appearance. As a manager of my own restaurant I would expect my employees to not be rude and demeaning like the door man was at this place. Like I said, we had been here before and just wanted to enjoy ourselves and support a business that we liked.  Everyone was dressed exactly like we were which infuriates me. After we got turned down, me and my partner watched as many people dressed EXACTLY the same got let in. It was completely disrespectful.   From here on out, I will tell everyone how horrible this place is. This is the worst experience I've ever had at a business in my life and I will not be coming back."}
