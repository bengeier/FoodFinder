{"text":"Had a horrible experience! It all made sense why it has a bad reputation. I will never step into this restaurant again as long as I am breathing!"}
{"text":"Brought my dad here during his visit because I had a coupon.  I've been here before and it has always been good and a nice atmosphere.  I always get the orange chicken and it is always good.  My dad got the sesame shrimp and it was out of this world!  I'm changing to this dish from now on !  In fact, this dinner is all he talked about during his visit.  We had Mai Tai for drinks and they were excellent."}
{"text":"Server immediately walked back to our table to challenge the 15% tip my mom left. Spoke to everyone at the table about it until my brother stood up and told him to go away. 

After our family said goodnight following the Fathers Day celebration our inattentive server attempted to ruin, I walked back in. Found server, asked him to get his manager, the three of us talked about the disrespectful and inhospitable behavior. 

Lame response from manager, no regrets or apology from server. Truly sad because the food (and other staff)) are wonderful. 

Go somewhere that they demonstrate respect for their guests - this is not the place."}
{"text":"We have been here a few times. The buffet lunch is excellent compared to any other chinese resteraunts. Good choices without too much of the oily taste."}
{"text":"I love this place, i have been coming here scince i was a little girl with my parents, and know i bring my son here, he loves the food here!! i will continue to come as long as they are here!friendlyy staff and the manager is awesome!!"}
{"text":"I have been going here for many, many years but on my last visit, the food was terrible.  The crispy shrimp was soggy and the egg rolls had a horrible taste and smell.  I was told by the lady at the front desk they were homemade but that was incorrect.  I have had fresh, homemade egg rolls and when you bite into them, you see the fresh cabbage inside.  What Great Wall of China South serves is cheap, frozen egg rolls.  I won't be back."}
{"text":"Went for dinner - large portions for the price
We ordered vegetarian dishes and both dishes had a lot and I mean a lot of oil. The eggplant in garlic sauce was flavorless and not at all spicy even though we asked for spice.
The mixed veg in garlic sauce was decent - actually tasted the garlic.
Waiters were constantly walking around and refilling water and making sure we didn't need anything.

Also they serve these fried wonton strips with 2 sauces as soon as you sit down, which was nice and unexpected."}
{"text":"We've been loyal customers here for years and were always happy about the food and service here. But our recent experience made me hesitated to come back again. The bill come with the tip amount pre-written for us. We have only two people and I don't think it's common for restaurant in the US to tell you how much tips you should pay. This is not respectful."}
{"text":"Love love love this place and the food.  Have yet to get a bad meal. Yummmm. HAPPY family and wonton soup the best!"}
{"text":"Sweet and sour chicken was not edible. First bite left a mound of wet flour in my mouth and two bites after were the same. The meal hit the trash. Crab Rangoon over fried and not good at all. Very dissapointed."}
{"text":"Food was decent, service not so much. If you like having the waiter challenge you on the tips you will love it here. This is the same thing many people have stated in their reviews

What they need to understand is that they get tipped for the service not in spite of it."}
{"text":"Haven't been there in about 5 years and man has it changed. Egg drop soup which used to be the best in Charlotte was nothing but dish water and noodles. The egg rolls were were microwaved soggy somethings and the Mu Shu was the worst I have ever had. The Fantasy Shrimp was very good. The only meal saver. We won't go back. There are much better Chinese places around..."}
{"text":"My family has enjoyed eating here since 1986 when we moved to Charlotte. The kids now request to eat there when they come home to visit. We love it...great cold noodles and dumplings!  It gets a 5 Yelp rating from me!"}
{"text":"After much searching, we settled on Great Wall as our favorite  place for a basic Chinese meal.  The food is good, service is reliable and from visit to visit its consistent.  The setting is pedestrian but pleasant enough.  We do a lot of take-out and they make it easy.  Try the House Special noodles and the Sesame Shrimp."}
{"text":"Ok
So we haven't eaten here in a long time. We used to eat here once a week because they had the best Chinese food around. Well we are here tonight and I have to say that it will be a very long time before I come back. The egg rolls were over cooked and old, the dough inside was yellow which indicates that they were old. The chicken was not very good either. Maybe they changed their chef but they need to do something ASAP. I can tell you not sure if I am coming back"}
{"text":"We went on Sunday night after buying Groupon Deal. The food is ok and no so great and veg lo mein was only thing that tasted good. 

The negative part is wait staff never came to ask how's the food and he was more interested in getting the tip since his shift ended at 9.00. They charged us 18% tip on the total bill (food +tax) plus 18 percent gratuity which makes no sense when waitor can't ask you how's the food or do we need anything else. It would have been better without a groupon deal and just to try. 

While leaving the owner was standing and never even said thanks for coming. We will not go to this restaurent again nor will recommend to our friends."}
{"text":"Gone downhill.  Service was awful.  Ordered soup, their \"special\" shrimp dish and pork fried rice.  The soup was served and that was the last we saw of our waiter for 45 minutes.  People who arrived well after us were served and left.  When finally the entree arrived it was relatively without taste.  Once we'd finished, we sat watching for our waiter, who never showed, before I got up, went of the cashier and asked for a check.  This has been one of our regular neighborhood go to restaurants for take out and dine in.  NEVER AGAIN!"}
{"text":"Our rehersal dinner served good food and service.  The mongolian beef was served with a rice bun (like bow) which was tasty.  The beef was a bit tough but flavor was good.  The steamed whole fish with scallions and soy sauce was very good. I plan to return to check out their lunch specials."}
{"text":"I had a Groupon so I check this place out. It was just 'ok'. I don't think I would go back even with savings from a Groupon. The rice was burnt and the beef and broccoli was very salty."}
{"text":"This is the Real Deal. Classic American Chinese food served fresh and hot with excellent service. I can't believe that I had never eaten here until I got a Groupon. I even suffered severe\" Groupon Guilt\" when the meal was over and the check came. To be completely honest I could not bring myself to use it on my first visit. The food had been too wonderful. The wait staff was too good.  I ordered 3 entrees that day...figuring I would take home the leftovers. I had scallion chicken made with dark meat chicken (your choice)  , fresh vegetables with tofu ( medium spicy) and chicken and broccoli . All were outstanding.. 
The atmosphere is hard to find anymore. Three large aquariums dominate the two levels of dining area. I chose a booth in the bar area that is right next to one of the tanks.It is soo relaxing to just watch the fish swim. You understand why Drs offices always had aquariums back in the 1900s.

If you are looking for a Chinese food \"fix\" this is the place. I am tired of the little dingy take-out joints that are  in every strip mall. This place is an escape to a more sophisticated era of Chinese restaurants in Charlotte. I also tried the lunch buffet and it was excellent. Enjoy."}
{"text":"This place has been here for a LONG time and I'd never been! Went for a quick lunch with a friend - used the Groupon currently online. Food was good, standard Chinese, nothing to write home about, but it was served hot and fast. I had the shrimp and broccoli with a spring roll, and there was more shrimp than broccoli! That's a first! It wasn't a HUGE lunch portion but it was filling and I took half of it home. Quiet atmosphere, secluded on the side of a shopping center, lots of parking. A good option for Chinese in the area."}
{"text":"Best Chinese takeout in Pineville/south Charlotte area.  They've been here forever (I've been coming here since I was a kid). Busy for dinner on weekends so I always get takeout. Very friendly."}
{"text":"Blah. Poor service and okay food.  Nothing special to write about. If they didn't have half price Groupons, I would never eat here."}
{"text":"By far, my favorite Chinese restaurant in Charlotte.  

Have been going to Great Wall for the past 12 years and no Chinese place in Charlotte has come close to replacing it.

Food has always been good and is always consistent.  From the egg drop soup to the spring rolls to the entrees, everything is great.  I highly recommend the Shrimp and Broccoli, but really everything there is worth trying.

Wait staff is very attentive, bordering on too attentive at times.  Food comes out fast and hot.  The owner is friendly and enjoys chatting.

Good with large parties, there are two rooms in the back of the restaurant that can be joined or separated depending on the size of your party."}
{"text":"I can only comment on carry out. 

I have ordered carry out food from here a number of times and am always impressed. I typically get a shrimp or chicken dish, and soup. It is definitely above average Chinese food. I guess that's why its more expensive than most Chinese places."}
{"text":"Very average Chinese... It's your typical asian flare with nothing special or bad. Alex is the owner who is there every day so he ensures good good and service."}
{"text":"ASK FOR THEIR SECRET CHINESE MENU FOR CHINESE. IF YOU ORDER ORANGE CHICKEN & EGG ROLL AND COMPLAIN, WELL FUCK YOU.
That being said, the beef in chili oil is gorgeous, string bean with pork is fantastic, special recommendation goes to wontom in hot oil. The staff is very friendly and knowledgable. This place is native Chinese foodie approved!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure if the folks are reviewing the same restaurant that I have enjoyed since 1985. I live in Florida now but come back to Charlotte 4-5 times a year and the Great Wall is always a must destination. 
My order is always the same and it is always delicious- Great Wall Special Trio; spicy, no vegetables. Fried Rice and Hot & Sour soup.
We have not been able to find good Chinese in North Florida. We would be so happy if we could get Chinese food the caliber of Great Wall!"}
{"text":"This place is bad! The service is bad, the food is bad and the prices are high! With our party of 4, we had a similar experience as Christina L. Where different waiters/waitresses would come by and awkwardly take our order, then someone else would bring out that order and then someone else would arrive to help us further.. The crab rangoons were very small and tasted generic, like something I could buy frozen at food lion and the shrimp in our meals ALSO were not deveined... And every dish we ordered was flavorless and bland... The only thing I enjoyed was the wonton soup! And then at the end of our meal, around 9:45pm we stayed at the table to chat.. Being cautious that the restaurant hours printed on the door said they close at 11pm.. A waitress came to us at 10pm and said that they were closing and they needed us to pay now... O_o  So we got up to pay and leave and the cashier man ( looked like the manager ) was so cold.. He never asked how the food was or anything, just \"this how much!\" And swiped the cards... Such a waste of money and time.. Worst Chinese food ever!"}
{"text":"Reading other reviews, I haven't experienced any inconsistancy in service or food quality, to me, it's always excellent. However, I always get the same dishes. I will say that their weekend buffet is nowhere as good as their regular entrees, so I no longer go for the buffet. Special Trio is one of the best dishes I've ever had, spicy and flavorful. Still one of the best Chinese places in town."}
{"text":"This is apparently not the best Chinese food I've got in my life compared to the ones in California or from my parents, but it tops my list of Chinese food in Charlotte. 

Just for the food, I'll give a 4 star considering it's in Charlotte. (I'm referring to the authentic Chinese food menu.) The Jiang Ya (marinated duck) is my favorite. La zi Ji is also  decent. 

The service was great for my experience. The waitress paid attention to what is left over on the table and asked why we didn't eat it and then exchanged a new one after we told her we simply didn't really like the flavor of the pork. 

I'm giving five star here because I believe this place deserves more positive comments than It has now."}
{"text":"I think this place is perpetually on Groupon, which to me is not a good thing. I have dined here twice, both on a Groupon. 

I went on a Sunday Buffet and my experience was good. I mean who doesn't like Chinese Buffet?? Especially because you are not expecting a high caliber of food, you are just expecting to eat a lot of the common Chinese food.

The next time I went was for a lunch on Saturday. And honestly there is nothing special here. The service was lacking, the check was dropped off right after the food. The place did seem busy, which I think is because of the groupon.

The food is seriously lacking. It had a small menu with the classic \"Chinese-American\" fare. When the food came out I was unimpressed. My hot and sour soup was terrible in flavor. The shrimp in my dish were the really small cheap shrimp. It is essentially just fast food in a sit down restaurant. There was not one thing that I would even recommend to anyone. It was all so blah. They bring out these dishes in the beginning of fried won-ton pieces. First, that is so cheap, but also it made me nervous about the cleanliness of the restaurant... Do they wash the bowls, or just refill the bowls? 

Also, the place is kind of dark, I think it needs a good overall cleaning."}
{"text":"The won ton soup the hot and sour soup was the best I've ever had. Even better then Chicago. I tried something new the special beef  delicious will order again but the great server said to order it less sweet. Two thumbs up you have to go and they also have traditional..."}
{"text":"The food was well prepared, had good taste and the aquarium was beautiful whit Nemo and Dory."}
{"text":"Great for large groups! They have rooms with tables that can accomodate up to 12 at one table equipped with a large lazy susan. Food is also usually fast. I say usually as one dinner trip, it took us close to 45 min to be served and tables that came in after us were served before us and we saw one couple leave after waiting for a while. Service is a hit or miss, really depends on the day and who serves you. We have seen bad and we have seen great but keep in mind it isn't a five star French restaurant when setting expectations. Decor is a bit dark and dated. Not a big deal for us, we will continue to visit as we heart their mapo tofu. Mangolian beef with the soft wraps and chinese broccoli with oyster sauce are also on our reg list. 
Often comes up on Groupon, we usually buy one our two."}
{"text":"I'm only writing this to save someone else from wasting money. If you grew up on the west coast or somewhere that has a large china town you will be severely disappointed as you have been with all Chinese food you've tried in Charlotte. 

I'm not even sure where to start, I'm still mourning the 30 dollars I just threw away. I ordered several things. I'll start with the beef chow mien. It was very soupy and did not have any noodles? Very strange. Moving on to the veggie spring rolls. Since when do veggie spring rolls include shrimp? New to me. The onion pancake was incredibly dry. I've always just bought these frozen from the Asian market and fried in a pan but have never had one that was dry. Remaining items, pot stickers, generals chicken, and white rice were incredibly bland and rice was so dry it was pretty much inedible.  

Maybe I hit this place on an off night, but if you're looking for a new good Chinese place I say keep walkin' don't bother."}
{"text":"Been searching for my goto chinese restaurant in Charlotte- Found it!  perfect flavors, huge portions, friendly prompt service - What more can you ask?"}
{"text":"We came here after a living social deal.  We wanted to come here anyways as we live close and it is one of the last places in the shopping center we need to try.

We were immediately seated.  Took a few minutes to get someone to us for a drink order, but after that service was fast.

We both ordered egg rolls and two entrees (sesame chicken and some other pork meal).  The rolls were okay, but they had shrimp in them, I'm not a fan of shrimp, wish I had known!!  Aside from that, the entrees were HUGE!  We both had leftovers, and a huge plus that it was still good for two more nights!  Such great flavored food!  We will be back for more!

My only other complaint is they added gratuity for the two of us, not sure if it was because of the living social deal or if that is normal, but we like to tip what we want.  Unfortunately our server got less than what we would haven given."}
{"text":"During the first seven years I lived in Charlotte, I had lunch here at least three times a month.  The food and service has always been steady.  I always left feeling as though I received good value"}
{"text":"We had some friends out shopping and told them about this good Chinese place. It was big, but mostly empty...  which isn't a good sign to me at 12:00 noon on a weekday.  The ladies went ahead and I parked the car. The hostess told me that there were not three ladies sitting together. I know they just walked in ahead of me. I spotted them in the corner.

First impression: the place is old and in need of some updates. It was really dark inside. There were far too many employees on staff for a restaurant with so few patrons.   

They sat us at a booth in the corner.  Our table was served the traditional bowls of watered down hot mustard and pink duck sauce...  the fried noodles were too done almost burnt, a disappointment.  

We had four people at our table. I ordered Hot and spicy scallops, fried rice and an egg roll.  Two people in our party ordered chicken broccoli with fried rice and egg rolls. One ordered chicken with cashews fried rice and an egg roll. The hot and sour soup was delicious and just the right temperature. 

When the food arrived, the portion sizes seemed correct and the fried rice was tasty with egg, peas and pork pieces in it.  I'm sad to say that the rice was the best part of our plates. One person got white rice instead of fried rice as ordered. The waitress did offer to get the fried rice.  My scallops were undercooked and stringy and mushy, I could tell they were almost done but just barely edible. It tasted very much like the brown sauce was burnt.  The egg rolls were overcooked and almost burnt.  

The aquarium was nice and we enjoyed it for a few minutes on the way out. I had eaten here before and it was much better in the past. So they Great Wall is not so great. Maybe just have some soup for lunch. Sad to say I won't take friends here again."}
{"text":"This is by far the best american style Chinese food you will find in Charlotte. You will pay a bit more but its well worth it because of the taste. They also have non American Chinese food but its off the menu and you just need to ask. I get this great noodle soup with veggies and chicken and its great. Taste like right from hong Kong"}
{"text":"Good Chinese food, typical flavors but consistently good. I like their lunch can specials, including soup and egg roll. For take out I like general tso chicken, cold sesame noodles, and steamed dumplings are wonderful!! The dinner time is crowded so go early or order to go."}
{"text":"Love ordering take out from here. The staff is super fast and friendly. Food is delicious. I enjoy the shrimp lo mein, General Tso's chicken, beef and broccoli and egg rolls. The Sunday buffet is also excellent."}
{"text":"The food is ok and  can be pricey, the staff is not very friendly and they seem upset all the time, maybe it's their personality. I had the ribs they were very dry, I will never have them again. The General Chicken is ok. I found this place to be average and expensive. The best time to go is on Sunday, they have a good buffett worth the money."}
{"text":"I've been in Charlotte for just over 4 years and I can tell you that Great Wall is the BEST I've had. Delicious food, hot and fresh ingredients. Try the Sesame Tofu, it's the best ever!!!! I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I came here with my in-laws to celebrate Father's Day. My Mother-In-Law called ahead and was told we could reserve the private room in the back. When we got there we were told that her name was mixed up with another woman, and that we would have to be seated in the main dining room. Not a big deal, but when you're told one thing and get another it's not the best way to start a meal. 

We ordered the crispy scallion pancakes, which were very good as an appetizer, and you get crispy noodles and sweet sauce for the table. I got the chicken lo mein for my dinner. Everyone else's food including mine, looked great, except for my sister-in-law. She was trying to be healthy and ordered tofu. Thinking she would get some vegetables, she didn't ask what else it came with. Let me tell you, it was only tofu, in some sort of brown sauce. It did not look very appetizing. 

I thought for the  amount people that were there, it took a little long to get our food, but once it came out I was more than happy. We were also able to use a restaurant.com gift card, but also know that the tip is added before you pay when you use one. 

Another great family dinner with the in-laws."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch, they have a pretty good lunch menu with comes Ruth steamed it fried rice and a spring or egg roll...

I tried the trio with shrimp, chicken and beef and they make it spicy! The food was hot when it arrived at the table and that extra spicy sauce really added to the flavor, I chose the steamed rice which was also very delicious and a perfect combination with the trio!

Everything was good enough to make me want to return and try something else!"}
{"text":"Service is awful, will only do take out from now on.
The food is ok, owners don't care at all about poor service"}
{"text":"Came here with some co-workers to try this place out.  The decor inside is very nice, with fish tanks and even an ivory tusk.  Since this is no cheap buffet place, we were seated to a table and had two menus, one for lunch and the other specials.  I choose the special, which was spicy shredded meat (forgot name) with celery and carrots with pork fried rice and egg roll.  The table with provided with complimentary bowl of crisps with sweat sauce and mustard sauce; they were not stale, so kudos there.  I also ordered a sweat tea (came with lemon), it was sweat and not watered down.

The meal itself was indeed spicy, but not too overpowering since I didn't sweat.  The fried pork rice was very good and the shredded meat with veggies complimented one another.  The egg roll was fat and yummy.  Overall, it was all very good and was able to clean the plate.

The menu and prices provided during lunch is what you would find at many other Chinese restaurants in the area, so there is nothing unique.  However, the flavors and how its prepared is definitely better than some in the area; this place is worth another visit."}
{"text":"This chinese food is the best in Charlotte. Always fresh and never leaves you feeling crappy like other chinese foods can. It's a little more pricey than other chinese food places but I think it's worth it since it's so good."}
{"text":"We purchased a Groupon to try our lunch at this place on a saturday afternoon. It was dead in there! No wonder they are on groupon! It doesn't seem like they even care if they get any business or not, as every single employee we encountered was cold and acted like they didn't want to be there. Very unfriendly. My husband and I both worked in the restaurant business during college and know about good customer service. For the food: My husband had some sort of beef dish with peppers and onions and I had the chicken and broccoli. Both dishes were very hot which was the only redeeming quality, but were incredibly generic. Nothing stood out about them whatsoever. The spring roll served with the meal was probably the worst Ive had so far. Very bready and not fresh tasting like you would expect a spring roll to be. Wont be back. Theres too many other places with great food and good customer service!"}
{"text":"Great service and the food is awesome! One of the best Chinese restaurants I've been to in Charlotte! The Cantonese lobster is a must try!"}
{"text":"I just walked in and told the the hostess I just wanted wonton soup, she seated me, a waitress came over and I ordered. She then rudely said I had to order at least $10 of food if I wanted to stay and eat in the restaurant. There were only maybe 3 tables with anyone at all in the place so it's not like they were busy and they have never said this to me before on the couple of other ocassions where I just came for their soup. I will never go here again."}
{"text":"Based on current horrible report for sanitation, I will stop my 2 to 3 visits per month"}
{"text":"It's my second time here. This experience is much better than last time. The sweet and sour shrimp is a must try! Just can't stop eating them"}
{"text":"This is not your typical take-out Chinese restaurant, but worth it.  The restaurant is clean and has a mellow vibe. Food wise, i would recommend the crispy shrimp and crispy scallops. For the price you get good quality Chinese food and not to mention, their portions are generous."}
{"text":"If you have a cold ... This is the place to get egg drop soup ! Best in Charlotte!!! Never disappoints ! Some things you just can't mess with and their egg drop soup is one of the best ever! Really really good Chinese !"}
{"text":"I use to love this restaurant until my last visit when reaches was at my table. The manager said I can take 20% off of your bill!! Thanks but no thanks! I have not been back."}
{"text":"Went back yesterday after passing over for several years.  Used to be one of my favorite places.  Food is what it is, no surprises, average Chinese at very reasonable prices.  Service was exceptionally bad, was made to feel not only unwelcome but a bother that we ate there.  Will admit beverage glasses were kept full, but nor a single pleasant gesture.  Also 18% gratuity was added to bill and only two of us, not mentioned by the server.  Again not a real problem just one part of the entire experience.   Next time it will be take out!"}
{"text":"Very good Chinese food. We've had several meals here and all have been good. The wait staff does a good job explaining the menu. There's no cocktail menu but just tell them the ingredients & they aim to please. Going a little before rush 5pm makes for quicker service. Orders can be called in & picked up. Not sure about delivery since we live out of the Pineville area. 

Nice for couple and family meals. We usually request additional chili to be brought to add to our meals. Efficient and not rushed during our meals. 

FYI - There is a private room for special events if needed."}
{"text":"Excellent choice.  Food was tasty.  Portions were plentiful.  Service was attentive, but not overly so.

We enjoyed Hot 'n Sour Soup, Lettuce Wraps appetizer, Beef in Garlic Sauce and Hunan Chicken.

Meats were tender and cooked to perfection.  Sauces were delicious--not overpowering or drowning the food like you find in some restaurants.

The Lettuce Wraps were delicious and were easily a meal for two, all by themselves.  A great choice for a night out or with the family."}
{"text":"Great food! Great service! 
We always enjoy our dinners here :) 
They're also on restaurant.com so you can get a great deal as well!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible experience. We were seated and drink order was taken by that person. Few mins later drinks were dropped off by a different person who said waitress would be over to take our order. Then 10 mins later someone came over and asked us if we wanted appetizers which we did and ordered Crab Rangoons and Spare Ribs. This person said someone would be back to take our order. Never happened. The apps came out and the guy said again someone would come take our order. So we ate our apps and still no one. No one even acknowledged us, I had to flag someone down and I said \"I think our waitress has forgotten about us...\" The man says \"what you want\" ummm to order? Hes like \"Yes, what you want just staring at us, no smile or apology. So we ordered and got our food about 10 mins later. Had to wait forever for our check. I think we had a different server every time someone stopped by. The Crab Rangoons were simply not Crab Rangoons. There was no cream cheese flavor whatsoever. I am not sure what they were, but not what I was expecting. The Shrimp Fried Rice tasted ok but the Shrimps were full of poo. Not deveined and completely packed with poo. Just disgusting. Wonton soup flavor was good but the actual wontons must have had a teaspoon of ginger in them. Strong and not really what I was expecting in a wonton...Whole dinner sucked. To top it off there was vomit all over the womens bathroom floor. No idea why this place was full. Many great chinese restaurants around, this is not one."}
{"text":"No go. Bought the Groupon despite the other reviews and decided to give this place a try. The location, atmosphere, and service were all good so no complaints there. The food however was not. I ordered the general chicken with brown rice and an egg roll. The chicken was all slimy dark meat and the flavor was nothing like general sauce but rather 100% strong garlic. I wasn't able to even eat hardly any of it because of the brown slimy meat. My husband ordered the garlic beef and he did not like the sauce at all. It had zero garlic taste, was way too thick, and overall wasn't very good. The egg roll was soft and mushy and is a shrimp roll so not your typical chicken/cabbage type. The place was super busy and I had high hopes, but ultimately the food itself was not good and we will not be back."}
{"text":"I ordered the House Special Fried Rice...it was okay, but nothing to write home about. I will try a spicy dish next time."}
{"text":"Five years ago we first experienced Great Wall and it was excellent.  Then it entered the land of yuck and for four years we have not returned until a couple of our neighbors invited us to join them.  We really did not want to eat at Great Wall, but did, just to be neighborly.

And are we glad we did!

The Charlotte Observer food critic had mentioned that they had a new chef and kitchen crew and it shows.  We both raved at how wonderful the food was.  Portions were very large, more for sharing than for one person.  Flavors were back with each bite bringing yet another certain spice or tang or texture.  I usually order the combinations like one of their two specials shrimp, beef and chicken and another variety of different meats.  Excellent!

The service was prompt and the waiter very authentic being a bit hard to understand but he accommodated all of our unique requests.  As to spicy, it was not, so if you are like us who prefer a kick to our food, we think you need to specifically go for extra spicy.  Their normal spice level was not detectable, but the food still was good.

Thank you for bringing back the excellent Chinese food and dishes from five years ago.  For those of you who have or had kissed off the Great Wall...come back and be pleasantly surprised.  I am holding my breath for a return visit hoping that our recent experience was not a fluke.  Oh I certainly hope not."}
{"text":"Been here a couple times and the food has always been really good.  It helps persuade me to come here when Groupon nudges me.

Sa Cha Chicken and the Hot & Spicy Pork were on our plates today.  Both were delicious.  Their lunch specials are around $7 and come with rice and either an egg roll or spring roll.  Their sauces are good and their vegetables are fresh... that is what I crave when I am there.

I also had the hot & sour soup - very good. Some places have a weird version of it - but not here.  Worth a try.  Yum."}
{"text":"If there is a 0 star id rate this place. The owner is very ignorant. When I tried to order food, he literally told me that \"he is way too busy to deal with me\".  What a joke.  I liked the place before but they will never have my money no more."}
{"text":"My family has been coming here for over 20 years and I've always had a great meal. Great specials, diversity, and service. I think this is the best Chinese restaurant in the Charlotte area. The best egg drop soup I've ever had."}
{"text":"Pineville,  NC Is loaded with several very good Asian restaurants and the Great Wall of China is one of them. It has been a favorite neighborhood restaurant for nearly 30 years. Lunch is very affordable and dinners, although a little more expensive, easily feed 2 - 3 people. The food is consistently tasty and service is okay although sometimes a little moody.

Dining area is a little dark yet roomy. A more authentic Chinese menu is also available, intended for its Asian guests but can be requested by anyone. 

You can be comfortable ordering anything as everything is good. Request table beside aquarium if available. I find their spring rolls very greasy. This place is. . Not a Gotta Try but
close."}
{"text":"We really appreciated the fast and friendly service from the staff.  Also, the owners came to the table to make sure everything was good.  They took the time to chat for a minute.The food we ordered was so delicious.  My favorite is the beef with broccoli and the wonton soup.  This is the perfect place for a large group of people.  There are rooms in the back where you can have privacy, and the main dining area is also very nice, with a really beautiful aquarium. My family and I always enjoy coming here for Chinese food."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for many years. All good things must come to an end. The food and service is not the same.Other  then the beautiful salt water fish tank there is nothing to say nice about the place."}
{"text":"Called to place a pick up order for some of the ladies at work. We got shrimp and Broccoli was spicy, General chicken spicy as well. Both came out pretty well. I asked if they had malgolian chicken and I was told that's only for dinner. I will probably try a new Chinese restaurant before I go back."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service! If you're black, do not expect to be acknowledged!  After my boyfriend and i walked into this disgraceful establishment, we were not acknowledged by the host, who was reading his newspaper, until after a white woman entered. She was waited on before us and no apology was given. Never have experienced anything like this before! Will not be going back to give them any of my money!"}
{"text":"It's relatively empty for a Sunday afternoon. I think that there are 4 tables altogether with diners. I ordered a spring roll, and an egg roll. They were fairly tasteless and warm. I think Chef Mike is at work. The spareribs were nice and hot and meaty. We saved the bones for the dogs. Our waitress gave us a small bag to put them in. 
Well our entrees arrived and we had both ordered orange beef. Hers was mild and mine was supposed to be hot and spicy. Mine was not spicy at all, what a shame. The orange sauce was nice but there was very little rind present. The meat was very chewy. Overall I really don't think that we'll be coming back again. Three stars for the wonderful aquariums and our waitress,  the food was a complete miss."}
{"text":"For Chinese food this place gets a three (3 yelp stars) from me.  I love the Chinese Cabbage and that was about it.  The Beef Dish I ordered was too salty and the Beef was over cooked though I do not think that was the determining factor   it tasted too plain  for my dish I rate it 2.55 yelp stars.  The Pineapple Fritters were perhaps made exactly as they were supposed to be though I did not like them.  The batter was too thick, some were overcooked and some were undercooked (batter gooey on the inside) 1 yelp star.  The service was A-OK as in 3 yelp stars.  

The Fish Tanks, Lighted Tree, Red Display Cases with carved tusks and Ceiling in the Bar show some potential in Decorating!  

They had a good Monday night crowd for a Monday night and were doing a lot of takeout.  Not much concern that I only took one bite of my HUGE Dessert, nor when I told them I did not care for it and no offer to comp it!  It would NOT have helped me rate the dine any higher though.  I would eat here again if Charlotte did not offer any better Restaurant choices!"}
{"text":"Ordered egg roll, cold and overcooked to the point you could not cut the wrapper, sent back but the next one was not much better.  Won ton soup lukewarm and lacking taste.

Ordered chicken with cashews and pork fried rice.  Neither had any taste, left hungry.  Will not return."}
{"text":"Decided to take the family here for our weekly Takeout Tuesday. I've orders takeout from  here years and years ago but never dined in. The Groupon was only for dine in. The food was really good. I sampled some of everybody's which is why I don't know what I had an allergic to. Ughhhhh. About 30 minutes to an hour later once I reached home I started itching profusely and then came the welps and bumps. Luckily I had some Benadryl on hand(life of a Mom). Hopefully I'm not getting any food allergies in my \"old\" age. But overall imtge food was good. Family loved it. It was really empty tonight, maybe about 10 people including my 4 but hey it's a Tuesday right??!!!! And Tuesday's are all about Tacos...maybe next Tuesday I'll stick to Tacos"}
{"text":"Won't be back. Below average food. Great service. Shrimp was tough and tasteless. Cashews were stale."}
{"text":"I went on a saturday night and was quite surprised that there wasn't anybody in there. The waiter wasn't exactly friendly but he wasn't rude either. My friend and I started with the egg rolls, and those were on point!!! I dipped it into the homemade duck sauce and that was good. It also came with some yellow sauce and that was horrible!

I ordered the beef and broccoli and that was pretty good. Would I come here again? Not quite sure because I don't live in the quail hollow area. Just know that I wouldn't come out of my way to get here."}
{"text":"We have eaten here for years. The food and service are both excellent.  They've ruined Chinese for me, because I can not find food this good elsewhere."}
{"text":"I called about 930 and the nice man ordered my food as the last order. I was starving Marvin and they were the only place to stay open and take my order. Such great people. And even better food. Must eat"}
{"text":"Best Chinese food in Charlotte.  The egg rolls are the best anywhere, especially the homemade wasabi mustard.  Yumm."}
{"text":"I've been going to this place for the past 15 years and it's definitely gone downhill recently. I used to rave about the food and service to all my friends, but recently my experiences have been pretty terrible. The owner and his waitstaff look as if they have just given up, there's never a smile on anyone's face, they all just look depressed. The food used to be amazing, but it seems as if they must have changed chefs because now everything usually ends up coming out either over done, or just drenched in way too much sauce. If you complain about the food, the waitstaff just acknowledge the complaint with a nod, walk away, and do nothing about it. I hate to write a bad review because I know how great it used to be, but it just seems as if owner stopped caring."}
{"text":"Great Wall of China is a nice place. The food and service is consistently good. There is outdoor seating and there are large aquariums inside with some cool fish. It's not expensive, but it's more than a \"china wok\" kind of place obviously (food's a lot better too). High quality veggies, so don't pass them up."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here and the food is amazing!  We also got the scallion pancakes, egg roll and spring roll not pictured here and it was delicious!  The pictures include chicken and broccoli and the Four Happiness with brown rice.  These were some of the best Chinese food around Charlotte.  I will definitely come back for more!"}
{"text":"I've been going to this Chinese restaurant for longer than I came remember. In that time, I've had a one or two minor issues. My favorite is the sesame chicken. There is amble parking but it does it crowded on the weekends."}
{"text":"Bleh. I just came from lunch with coworkers here. Ordered the shrimp and mixed vegetables, was served the shrimp and broccoli. Probably all the same sauce anyway. 

Shrimp and broccoli both tasted like freezer. Broccoli was.. chewy? Did not realize that the fried rice would come with pieces of pork, but it did, so watch out my non-carnivorous friends. 

Also, apparently, in this part of the country, an egg roll is just a super fried version of a spring roll. Had no idea, I was imagining those spring rolls you get at Viet places, wrapped in rice paper, fresh. 

Food took quite a while to come out, and no one brought us fortune cookies. If I'm going to have Americanized Chinese food, I want my fortune cookie. and now I'm craving fortune cookie. Dang it!

I suppose this is a great place for lunch, but only if you aren't familiar with real, good, Chinese food. I'm so sad right now."}
{"text":"Our friends invited us here for dinner  as they have been patronizing this restaurant for 11 years and really enjoyed the Chinese food.
 We were greeted by a friendly hostess and  the restaurant has a nice atmosphere.
 The waiter we had didn't crack a smile and was very serious throughout the whole dinner service,  never asking if we enjoyed our food or if needed anything else. He was not friendly at all as were all the other servers we noted.
 However the owner of the restaurant came and greeted our friends and seemed very friendly and happy.
The menu is very nice with typical Chinese dishes and also chef's specialties
Vegetarian, healthy dishes and   childs plates also are included in the menu.
 The portions are very adequate, prices moderate and the food came out hot and plated very nicely 
All  of what we ordered was very tasty.
 Our orders included , egg drop soup , hot and sour soup,  wonton soup. 
Our main courses were the kings tofu dish   a mixture of tofu,  chicken   shrimp and mushrooms,  a great wall  triple delight,  with chicken and seafood and a  spicy  curry chicken .
 We also ordered brown rice instead of white rice and an eggroll as an appetizer for one.
Soups were standard basic recipe as well as the egg roll but the dinners really very good  as far as sauces and seasonings.
Fried rice would cost extra if desired
We would certainly return to try other dishes and hope to get a friendly server next time."}
{"text":"Great Wall has become our go-to for takeout. We have tried quite a few dishes on multiple occasions and not yet been disappointed. But still we get the crab Rangoon every time. Still haven't made it inside for a sit down dinner though."}
{"text":"I had checked out the reviews on Great Wall south, and decided to try it. Walking in at 3:45 PM, there were maybe 3 tables occupied. The decor was inviting. I loved the huge fish tank they had on display. From there, sadly, it began to go downhill. 

A lady at the bar waved me to the dining room, and a waiter sauntered over to ask what I wanted to drink. Also he asked me if I wanted a menu......strange. After getting settled with the menu, I ordered 2 egg rolls, hoping that since it was between mealtimes I would get freshly fried ones. Nope, not to be. Cold, hard and greasy. So back they went, with a request for fresh ones, told the waiter I didn't mind waiting for them.

I ordered Sa Cha Scallops as an entree, with a small pork fried rice. The new egg rolls came out at the same time as the entree. I could deal with that, no probs. BUT....egg rolls were NOT fresh, they were warmer, and just as hard. Scallops were good and plentiful, presentation was good, fried rice was good also. The egg rolls were the turnoff. 

I'm giving it 2 Yelp stars, but if you love good egg rolls, don't come here expecting to find them. Panda's Den in north Charlotte puts this place to shame."}
{"text":"Been coming here for years. Alex, Tiffany, Cathy and all the staff make me feel welcome. The food is always consistent and good. I generally take out but when dining in, the experience is always good. One thing you must do is spend some time looking at their salt water fish tanks. These tanks are incredible and worth visiting the restaurant just to enjoy them."}
{"text":"My husband and I went this past Saturday for dinner. I saw a few Chinese people there eating and thought to myself this food will be great. Because I usually judge a restaurant for being authentic if their own people go. I was wrong. The wait staff leaves a lot to be desired, the hosts are great. However, the gentleman passed by me literally 8 times and did not refill my water for a good 15 minutes. I basically had to flag him down and tell him to please refill it. We ordered the sesame cold noodles. Which I love the peanut sauce but way too much soy in there so it came off extremely salty. Also we order the favorite shrimp (which is that sweet mayo shrimp) and sesame chicken. Okay the favorite shrimp was disgusting. The sauce tasted old and I couldn't even stomach to eat it. The side of broccoli was just drizzle with soysauce and salty!  the sesame chicken was average however I did enjoy how they didn't soak it in sauce. I asked for extra vegetables and we were charged more for it but got literally just a spoon full of vegetables. Jade Asian Fusion and Dim Sum tastes so much better"}
{"text":"Not a bad chinese place. They had a buffet on Sunday which looked good although I choose not to go that route. The staff was very friendly and the place looked clean. I wonder about the bar area though. How long has some of those bottles been up there? 
Sesame Chicken- below average
Egg roll - Above average"}
{"text":"1/1/18, first review of the new year.  Everyone's homes all tucked up eating collards and whatever.  Where am I?  Eating Chinese Food....typical.
I've been to Great Wall a few times.  I like the atmosphere since it beings me back to the days of my upbringing.  Instead of a \"take out\" place with a few tables and chairs, Great Wall is more of a \"sit down\" place so I can eat without people trasping in and out.  My dear Daughter was with me and we were both pretty hungry.  They gave us a typical lunch menu with the combinations which include rice and an egg / spring roll.  
I ordered the Beef and Broccoli, fried rice and an egg roll.  The Beef and Broccoli was typical and tasted great.  The egg roll was really tasty, not sure what was different about it, but tasted great.  My daughter has celiac and needs special accommodations and the waitress was very understanding and we were able to create a special meal for her.  
Great Wall does a great job and we've not had a bad meal there.  I recommend it."}
{"text":"We have been coming here for several years and the service and food varies to the day of the week and server. Week days are best, quick and attentive service. Shrimp in chili sauce is one of our favorite but the spiciness varies each time. Flower chicken is good if you like more on the bland side. Pork fried rice is consistently good just wish they could add spouts. Overall this is a fine restaurant"}
{"text":"We didn't eat the food here because we arrived, ordered, and saw a cockroach crawling around the bowl of the crunchy noodles that they serve as a table item. When we attempted several times to flag down a waiter - who apparently wasn't OUR waiter - he ignored us. Our waitress came to apologize that he was ignoring us because our table isn't in his area. So we still have a cockroach hanging out at our table. The manager came out to ask about the situation and did not apologize and did not offer any compensation. We left and recommend you not patronize this place."}
{"text":"Been there couple of times, some times the food is good, sometimes are not. It's odd that their chef couldn't keep a stable level:("}
{"text":"I've been coming to Great Wall since they opened, when I was 3!  Even though I've moved away, we still come back 2-4 times a year, and always on my birthday and our anniversary.  My husband didn't grow up with them, but he loves them just as much, and my kids love going on Sundays for the buffet.  Thank you for being a perfect family favorite!"}
{"text":"I called at 9PM TO MAKE A TAKE OUT ORDER. the owner asked me my name and advised me that it will be ready in 20min. 

After 20min I went to the restaurant and paid for my order. To find out that they haven't even started making my order. I guess they was waiting to get payment first before they started making the food. And if that is the case they should have told me that in the first hand. 

Needless to say that I had to wait another 20min for my food to be ready. 

I haven't even tasted the food yet so I will update this review after I eat."}
{"text":"Ok the 4 stars is purely for the food, because honestly, I think the service here kind of sucks. But what can you say, generally at Asian establishments, lacking service is usually the trend. However, if you are craving AUTHENTIC Cantonese food, this place is it!! This is a hidden gem that you do not know about this place. Sure you can order the regular Americanized Chinese food. But why when you can get pea sprouts, steamed fish, steamed chicken, Chinese ribs with bean paste sauce etc?
A pretty cool aquarium inside with live reef.
The only downer is our waiter never bothered to come refill over beverages. She kind of took our order, dropped down our food and peaced out;. I think this place is definitely short staffed, the owner ended up coming out to bring out our checks."}
{"text":"This has been my favorite Chinese restaurant anywhere in the country for 30 years. Are there last night, and something tastes slightly different with the flavors. Still excellent, but you can tell that something slight has changed. Curious if maybe a main chef retired? Anyway, still excellent."}
{"text":"I have been going to Great Wall since 1983. It has always been great and it's the restaurant by which I judge all other Chinese restaurants. It is consistent, reasonably prices, good services and delicious food. The staff is very courteous and I am always well served. If I ever do have a problem, they are more than compliant. Great place."}
{"text":"I honestly dislike writing this review... I have always loved Great Wall for their quality of food.. The service is always hit or miss. Tonight.. I received abrasive service while picking up my order. 

This is the reason for a 3 instead of 5. I generally leave a tip for services, however when there is an abrasive attitude given because I am clarifying whether an ingredient I am allergic to is in the food, there will not be a tip. 

The food is fresh and tasteful.. Temperature perfect.. Service not consistent."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a way to avoid the lines of Easter Brunch, head to a Chinese Restaurant.  We showed up at the Great Wall sometime around noon and there were about four tables taken up.  Sweet.

They had a Sunday Buffet - I think they do this every Sunday, not just for Easeter.  I'm not sure if you can order off the menu or not.  Frankly, I don't think that I would.  Since the Great Wall doesn't typically do a buffet, but instead puts a variety of their typical dishes out on a jury-rigged affair, it's like getting a family-style selection of meals, rather than your normal Chinese buffet.

While you don't have the selection of some buffets, where you'll have three, four or even five buffet lines to choose from, the food is overall much fresher, and the experience much better.  The problem, such as it is, is that if they were busier, the lines would be difficult to navigate.  As it is, the process wasn't a problem at all.

The bar had two soups, half a dozen different meats, a couple of rices (one white, one brown), lo mein, some vegetable options and a dessert.  Decent selection, and the food itself was certainly the star.  Where some buffets will be too heavy on the sauce, so that it can survive hours on the warming tray, the food here was almost like a large portion that you'd get had your table ordered it yourself.

Thus, you were able to really enjoy.  The beef and broccoli was my personal favorite, but all of the dishes were quite good.  Staff was attentive, and even the price was good, considering that we were there for a Sunday afternoon brunch."}
{"text":"I have been here several times and it's always been good. I've come here before for the sunday buffet and they actually have a lot of options. Egg rolls are so good and fat. Chicken wings are huge and crispy!! My favorite is the house special lo mein noodles. It has that smoky flavor and the put a lot of meat in it! Boyfriend loves their chicken and broccoli. I've also ordered from their Chinese menu. I tried the fish in the spicy oil sauce. It was good and light. staff is always friendly and I love when they seat us near the huge aquarium."}
{"text":"The very best Chinese in Charlotte maybe NC.  Alex the owner was born in Tapai.  He lived in San Francisco for years and started his business and family in Charlotte back in the 80s.  His brown sauce is a secret recipe and only he makes it each day.  Absolutely the best."}
{"text":"We were looking for a good Chinese place and I saw the reviews for Great Wall of China.  We decided to try it on Sunday after church. It  looked like it might be crowded with all the cars in the parking lot but when we got in the restaurant was bigger than it looks and it didn't feel cramped at all. Another surprise is apparently Sunday's they just do a buffet.  

The inside was your typical American-Chinese restaurant look with the brass bars, and large fish tanks and a bit of flair from the 80's.  One thing that stuck out like a sore thumb is the absence of sound. It honestly felt like family dinner time after report cards came out. Besides the occasional cough and banging of fork on the plate that was it. My wife and I actually felt uncomfortable holding a conversation above a faint whisper. Don't know what the deal was with that maybe the other customers were regulars and were used to the \"no talking while you eat\".

The food was average. It was a relatively small buffet, featuring two types of rice, some noodles, sesame chicken, beef and broccoli, egg rolls, chicken wings, and about 5 variations of chicken, cashews, and sauce.  I will say the egg rolls were the size of hot pockets and tasted like had been either fried way to long or they were using old oil. The sesame chicken was crispy which was nice but the sauce tasted like it was just poured out of a drum. Nothing to write home about.  At least the service was good. I noticed on someone else's review, they mentioned the service is a little over bearing at times. I couldn't take a sip of tea with out him trying to refill it.  All in all it was a very bland an QUIET lunch. Maybe since it was on a Sunday the food was a little below par, I'll have to try it again and order off the menu and see how it goes."}
{"text":"The BEST Chinese in charlotte. My boyfriend and I are regulars there. The food is amazing and the fish tanks are beautiful. If you are a vegetarian like myself they have plenty of option. I get the mixed veggies in brown sauce, SO GOOD!"}
{"text":"Last night I had couple of sakis, pot stickers, won ton soup and the shrimp and scallops special. Delicious food and a wonderful attentive waiter. 
Only down fall was a floor manager who was very loud talking about his own personal business, he reached over my sake (his tie touched it) to check my wife's tea. No excuse me etc. Additionally, he hovered in a bad way.
Regardless, my waiter was awesome. The rest of the staff seemed good also. Tasty food."}
{"text":"I don't know what happened today, always used to enjoy the food here! My chicken dish was so spicy it was not edible and I wasn't asked about how spicy. I mentioned it to the waiter and he brought me xtra sauce that was less spicy. This did not help the already drenched in sauce chicken. The Egg roll tasted really old....about an hour and a half later I got violently ill. I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Been coming to the GW for almost thirty years!  Back in 1982 it was one of the few places to eat in the Carmel Commons area.  (Other than Little Ceasars, Mamma Rosas in Pineville & Chucky Cheese).  Yah, I'm old.  I remember when Winn-Dixie was still in Carmel Commons.    

Family owned.  SUPER FRIENDLY managers.  Gets busy on weekends.  VERY fast take-out service.

Once bumped into Jim & Tammy Baker during lunch. 

Standard \"American\" Chinese food.  Poo Poo platter fun with the flaming sterno cauldron.  THEY DO HAVE A REAL CHINESE MENU, but you'll need to ask for it.  

Bar Area waiting.  Kids love the multiple fish tanks.  Fun place to people watch.  Don't worry if your kid spills fried rice all over the floor.  They won't fret about it.  

Always ask for the house made mustard and duck sauce if you're getting take-out.  

Bummed Baskin Robbins closed. . .as for years we'd stuff outselves on Beef & Brocoli and then waddle down for a pint of Mint Choc Chip.

BE CAREFUL about drinking and driving.  CMPD and even Pineville patrol the area on a regular basis.  Better to get a cab than put yourself in that situation."}
{"text":"Really good food and really really fast. Good choice for standard chinese in the South Charlotte area. Full bar and open for lunch."}
{"text":"Nope, not a fan. Crab Ragoon and chicken wings was overcooked, rice was refried with oil taste that you get when it's old. Service was friendly, seating was good but sadly the food wasn't enough for us to come back."}
{"text":"The food here is good. For an appetizer I tried the crab rangoon and the pork dumplings, fried.  They were very flavorful and perfectly cooked.  The dumplings come with plenty to share.  Prices are good.  Service is very attentive. I will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I do not give bad reviews often, but this one is one of them unforutnately.  My husband is from the west coast and he is picky about his Chinese food.  He thought he found a good place once on his lunch break and wanted me to try it for dinner, so we went.  It was aweful.  How can you mess up wonton soup and vegetable spring rolls.  The sesame chicken was terrible.  The shrimp with garlic sauce just ok.  And the waiter was MIA after we got our food...we wanted to get some extra white rice at least and then our check at the end took forever, it was bad.  We also returned that wonton soup back to the kitchen since it was so bad.  Lastly, I did not think a tip was deserved so I made that known...and the owner was pissed off and made sure to tell my husband about it, but honestly I do not care.  YOU NEED TO DO BETTER, CHINESE FOOD IN CHARLOTTE OFFICIALLY HAS A BAD NAME!"}
{"text":"Awesome Sesame Tofu, Drab place, terrible service!!! Not going back!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Friendly staff and they put your food in your box for you, I, definitely coming back. Check out their groupon deal too"}
{"text":"I was so excited to  try this new place since I work near it and my daughter is moving 5 minutes away. I had not seen it before but though it looked very quiet. So I only ordered lunch. I went to the restroom while I waited for them to cook it. I got an egg roll and soup. I came out and she was all ready. I said wow, that was fast. Usually and egg roll takes a minute or two to cook. When I got back to the office I found out why. First no spoon or soy Sauce. then the egg roll was soggy. They did not even cook it fresh. Yuck. It was so bad. The egg drop soup had no flavor either. I woudl pass this place by in a heart beat. Had they been busy I woudl say, oh they are busy, but there was no one in the place. Learn that lunch people are the same people who come back for dinner people. yikes"}
{"text":"After reading about some recent reviews, I decided to stop by to check out the lunch specials. Unfortunately I went on a Sunday, when they only offer the buffet. So, after reviewing the buffet options, and noticing it was $9.50, I figured why not. The Sunday buffet offers two soups, wings, two rices (brown & white) and 9 entrees, including beef with broccoli, sweet and sour chicken and shrimp, beef with peppers, seafood with cashews among a few. 
I started with the egg drop soup and wasn't thrilled, a little luke warm. However, the fried chicken wings were good. As for the entrees, I tried the beef with broccoli, which was the first to go, and the cashew seafood, general tso's chicken and sweet and sour chicken. All were good, but overall I prefer fresh meals, served hot and fresh. Although they seemed to fill the trays often, they seemed to go pretty quickly and those that remained definitely lacked in heat. 
Overall everything was good & servers seem to be all around to assist with anything. I am just not a buffet person, but will return on a weekday to check out a preferred dish only."}
{"text":"I've recently visited this place again because i did like the food. And the food was still ferocious. They don't skim on the sauce or meat. The sauce is very flavorful. I did takeout. So not sure about the service. But the sanitation grade has improved to 96. I'll return again. It's worth it. I'm glad I gave them a second chance."}
{"text":"It seems like this restaurant has been here as long as I've lived here and probably longer. They have some of the most outstanding Chinese food in the area.
The restaurant is pleasantly decorated and it kind a whisk you away like you're in another world or on vacation. I love that when I get to go out to eat - - the feeling of being somewhere exotic.

The place is always clean and the staff is always very friendly. Another one of our favorite go to places for big family events and birthdays etc."}
{"text":"Been coming here once a week for 10+ years. Always great. Staple of my diet. Best Chinese in South Charlotte."}
{"text":"I was greatly surprised at how friendly the service was and how good the food tasted. I have eaten at many many Chinese places for lunch and this is tied for top spot. They give you Chinese chip things before your meal with sweet sauce and hot sauce. They also have large fish tanks with exotic tropics fish. Overall great experience."}
{"text":"This is the BEST Chinese restaurant in Charlotte and maybe in the US.   The egg drop soup is fantastic, the service is great, and we've never had a bad meal there.   Anything you eat there will be the best you've ever tasted.  We eat there at least once a week.  I do carry out and my family looks forward to it!"}
{"text":"I've been going to The Great wall of China South for quite a while. The owner Alex and the staff always accommodate to your liking. I am a pescatarian so I don't know how their meats are however I can tell you about a few of their dishes. My all time favorite dish is one of their specialties the \"Crispy Scallops\". The portion size is very generous & the scallops are sweet. This does not come with any vegetables. I recommend ordering the mixed vegetables with brown sauce. I always tell them to make the sauce spicy :) For appetizers the \"Steamed Veggie Dumplings\" are amazing with a sweet soy sauce. The \"Crab Rangoon\" is okay. The \"Spring Rolls\" are greasy but good. Make sure to have extra napkins. Also I've tried the \"Sa Cha Scallops\" during lunch and definitely a yummy dish! Although I like it very spicy. The restaurant is always clean and they have stayed consistent on everything for many years. Love this place!! Always keeps me coming back"}
{"text":"Since 1985 Great wall has focused on quality and great food. I live about 30 min away now and still come here to eat. Passing at least 10 other Chinese restaurants."}
