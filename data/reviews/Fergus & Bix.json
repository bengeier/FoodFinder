{"text":"Have been here twice for dinner and brunch now and I'll admit this is the only location I've been to and certainly hope their other locations are better.   I don't know what it is but the service is below par here. Servers are sloooooow, not friendly, and don't pay attention to their customers.   The food, well it's a bit pricier than OJ's, but portions are smaller and the quality is meh...  By meh I mean my pulled pork sandwich is extremely messy and left a puddle of oil and juices on the plate and fries are uber soggy and looked like they were frozen and not fresh cut fries.   Oh and another thing that really bugs me about F&B is the ladies \"book club\" special only for ladies??? Pssssh!"}
{"text":"Went one weekday afternoon and had lunch and the beer sampler. Was surprised at how good the food was, even a vegatarian pasta was tasty and well cooked, unlike some more pricier places. The beer sampler is a hoot and allows you to try different beers for a low price. Fast efficient service as well. Would recommend this place to everyone."}
{"text":"My hubby and I received a gift card for Fergus & Bix so decided to give it a try.  The food was pretty good and the hot wings were probably the best I have had in a while.  I should not have ordered the fish and chips though - way too heavy and way too much deep fried goodness.  Mark had the pulled pork sandwich which he said was good but didn't come close to Palomino.  The place overall has good ambiance and gets pretty loud once it fills up, but to be expected in a brew house.    Would I go Back?  Only if I happened to be in the neighborhood, otherwise it is too out of the way for me to just drop by (especially with all the construction)."}
{"text":"Food always seems to be fresh. Decent beer on tap, though can sometimes taste a bit stale or as if the lines aren't maintained properly (would have got 5 stars from me if this weren't the case). Staff is always friendly, and in fact I recently had the best service I've had in years by a newer brunette waitress."}
{"text":"Met some friends here for a bite and drink. It's a cool place, and was nicely hopping for a Wednesday night in the deep western suburbs.  It is a great pub/restaurant for all age groups. The food is quite good with the usual pub food but more sophisticated salads and appetizers. All round great place to meet friends or have a date (by date for me I mean a beer with my hubby)."}
{"text":"Always busy and sometimes you have to wait to get a table, particularly if you go on the weekend. It sure beats other pubs in the neighborhood in terms of quality, though that is also reflected in their prices.  I enjoyed their burgers and salads, though their best dish for me is the \"beer board\". It's a platter with meat, potato salad and pretzel bread and is designed to go with any of their beers. What I liked most about the beer board is that it is original and unexpected. The food is fresh and not pre-packaged (at least, not that we could tell.) Have yet to find anything similar elsewhere.  It's also pretty loud in there, which usually annoys the crap out of me in a restaurant, but there's something about this place that makes you want to overlook the noise levels. This place is A-OK and definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"The best of the 2 Fergus & Bix!!! I come here even if it's out of my way!! Amazing staff ans service is top notch!!!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times. The 1st time I went I was expecting a nice restaurant with restaurant food. Got a pub with pub food   But pub food is okay, right? Sometimes?"}
{"text":"We had a nice Monday evening at Fergus & Bix two weeks ago. Our server was friendly (and prompt, despite also bartending). My friends' wine selections were mediocre but my craft beer flight really hit the spot; the restaurant also had a featured charity brew which was a delicious part of my flight! All three of us ordered the burgers, which are on special on Monday nights (the veggie burger, too!), but as Americans we were a bit sad to learn that beef must be cooked well-done in Alberta. The burgers were still flavorful but my mashed potato side was the star on my plate. My companion loved her sweet potato fries. All in all, a nice relaxed place to enjoy a Monday meal - though next time, I'd try another entree!"}
{"text":"Really disappointed that this restaurant has chosen to make up their own rules in regards to when Minors are allowed. They have excluded a large demographic of consumers in this rural Neighbourhood by not allowing minors during the week."}
{"text":"This is no regular pub fare. The food here is awesome! I've eaten here twice in the last two weeks and the food was fantastic both times. Asian lettuce wraps and Beef Tacones were soooo yummy!"}
{"text":"Ok...ate here before as its in the neighborhood and the fish and chips were so big it was too filling...we were glad to see they had 1 piece halibut or cod fish and chips offered for 15 bucks..wow..so we were surprised by the small size..the battered fish was tasty but the quantity of frozen fries under them were small and the tartar sauce tasted of horseradish Ick. .and the coleslaw in a tiny bowl tasted of curry  so odd...it will be a while before we return..that's for sure ..certainly not worth 15 bucks..."}
{"text":"A pleasant surprise.  A few co-workers met there for lunch.  The services was excellent and the food was quite good.  I had a blackened chicken Caesar salad. It was fresh and quite large.   Others had the chop salad, which also looked quite good.     The decor is good and the restaurant is clean.  I will definitely try it again."}
{"text":"Consistently good food and service. It's a nice space, clean, and has good prices for this neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Ordered the basil pasta, which was offered to be veggie friendly, and the Caprese Pizza. Wow these hit the right taste buds, we both loved both dishes. Service was great and the staff was relatable and cordial. Wine was a little pricey. I've been looking for an opportunity to go back, it's just what McKenzie Towne needed."}
{"text":"Fergus & Bix will impress you. The craft beer selection is fantastic and the food is exceptional. I ordered the beer board the other night and the platter that came out was awesome - from the presentation, to the quality of meats and cheeses - all around delicious. The pizza is also fantastic. The food is a little pricey to me, but I haven't been let down yet! I would definitely recommend going here or bringing a date to this classy establishment. The owner is there often and he's very friendly and cool. The staff are just as friendly and they are great!"}
{"text":"I realize that this is the suburbs and people lack both perspective and options but I remain baffled as to how anyone can rate F&B so highly. The food is average at best but the prices are outrageous. I am more than happy to pay $25 for my entree at a good restaurant but never at a mediocre pub in the suburbs. Drop your prices by a significant amount and I may be willing to return but until then I will warn others off wasting their time and money here."}
{"text":"My fav is the Montreal Smoked Meat Sandwich.  You cannot go wrong.  Beer is always cold and service is excellent.  The noise level can get out of hand tho.  The sandwich makes up for it."}
{"text":"I really was excited to have a new place in a mckenzie towne but this one is a bit of a fail so far. Been there 3x so far and each time, the service was painful and the food wasn't so bad although in my experience a hit and miss. Martini's and some of the other drinks are heavily overpriced for what you get. I don't need to go into why the service was so poor, I'm sure you all know what that looks like. Major improvement please."}
{"text":"Added by a star but almost took it away because they serve the worst tap water ever!! Tuesday nights half $ . Food is good here! Add another star for the food and service!!"}
{"text":"New in the neighbourhood and have gone there 4 times. Always yummy food. Nice to bring the kids out to. Breakfast menu is amazing."}
{"text":"It was your typical restaurant ok burgers & ok serves not anything special more or less over priced & the waitresses are some what oblivious to what they need to do"}
{"text":"I love how pubs these days are not just burgers and fries. Love their seafood linguine! Lots of very unique food options and fusion flavours.  Great neighbourhood pub!"}
{"text":"I decided to come here to meet up with my best friends. Such a random place to be going to since none of us lived close by.  The food was good. I had a chicken wrap that came with garlic mashed potatoes that drop kicked my hunger into oblivion. They also didn't have Keith's on tap but the waitress was awesome enough to recommend a refreshing alternative. Prices were average to most gastro pubs which meant $30 bucks will get you 2 pints and an entree.  I would guess that the crowd the must frequent this place on average is 25+ and maybe a bit more older. Nothing wrong with that. The service was great and attentive, of course we were a table full of handsome young men that any woman couldn't resist so I couldn't blame our waitress :P"}
{"text":"First of all, I really prefer when places take reservations...but I also understand why some places don't (ie. a place with a good patio in the summer months, a brunch spot on a Saturday morning.) I initially called Fergus to ask to book a table for two for dinner on a Friday night. I was told that they did not take reservations on Fridays, unless it was for a large party. Fair. Then I asked how busy it would be on a Friday night. I was told that there should \"be no issue finding a seat if you arrive before 7:00.\" Alrighty. My dad and I showed up at 6:30 to very little parking and an approximately 5 minute wait. It ended up being more like 10. I was told no wait. Alas, when we were sat, out waitress was WONDERFUL and our food arrived very quickly. The food itself, could have been prepared better, but the efficiency was great. I'm not entirely sure why, being as it was quite early in the evening, but the music and bar ambience was incredibly loud.  Very unnecessary. Crowds, I understand, you can't control, but the volume of the music/TVs... that's adjustable. Our bill also took forever to be settled. In a nutshell, service was wonderful.. there were just a few little housekeeping things that seemed a bit off. May try again to see if maybe I would have a better experience."}
{"text":"I give this place only 3 stars but feel an upgrade could be in order once I have more then one dish. I went here, not very hungry, but looking for a place to sit and chat. We ordered the lettuce wraps and there are quite a few easy fixes that could be done in order to make this dish so much better. The lettuce was very dry and warmish making it less then crispy, everything in the mix was cut very small so although it cooks very quickly it also all tastes the same. And the sauce just needed a little something to make it taste less bland. Another level to the sauce perhaps would make it stand out more. The service was good, the place was very nice looking, and quite full. Based on the atmosphere I will be going back to try more food on the menu."}
{"text":"Went here last Sunday morning for breakfast! It was delicious. Unfortunately on Sundays they only have beer as specials which is a little too bad because most other restaurants or pubs will also have Cesar's on special or mimosas on Sundays.  I got the breakfast pizza which was huge and delicious but a little bit sticky because they put syrup on it which give the pizza great flavour so it is worth it. They also have Eggs Benedict such as a traditional which other people t my table got and they said it was delicious.  I will definitely go back here on another day besides Sunday to see how it is. They didn't have a typical menu that shows the different specials everyday and I wish they did."}
{"text":"Great food with lots of selection for a fair price.  Initially when I arrived at Fergus & Bix, I didn't know what to make of it. It was still pretty early in the day, so when my friends suggested it I thought it was more of a breakfast place. Walking into a pub when I was expecting breakfast was kind of surprising. We were quickly informed that we may sit wherever we liked and were given menus. The menus have a crazy number of different items. From wonton soup to noodle bowls to tuna salads to beef dips and steaks. You're sure to find something you want to eat. I wasn't convinced that it was a good place when looking at the prices as they seemed quite steep. After tasting the food though, I knew that the price was worth it. I had the first bite of my beef dip and was amazed at how fresh and delicious the bun and the beef were. Great food paired with good service has made me like this place, but I can't give it 5 stars for those prices.  Plenty of beers (20 on tap) and even more food choices available."}
{"text":"Great beer pub atmosphere with excellent food. It's your traditional pub fair with burgers and sausages. Happy hour has beer, wine and bar drinks, with an excellent selection of small plates. My friends and I tried one of each of the sliders, the cheese plate and the potstickers. All were great! The pulled pork was the favorite of the sliders. The cheese plate was well portioned with 4 varieties of cheese, a local ham, fruit, nuts, olives and garlic. The pepper jam was a perfect side. The potstickers were full of delicious sausage and veggies. House red wine was decent for a happy hour. Price was about $25 each, but we had enough food and drink to cover dinner. Would sit on the patio again and relax at Happy hour."}
{"text":"Great little gastro Pub.  Ordered food here to go, and surprisingly it was very good. The pub itself was very busy and seems popular. Would like to actually dine in some time again."}
{"text":"This is a great place to eat. We went after work and it was delicious. We ordered a huge plate of nachos. The four of us had a hard time getting it all down. The burgers are huge. The atmosphere is nice and its not overly loud. It has a real pub feeling to it. We got great service and one of the manager/supervisors gave us some great attention. He was hilarious. Overall, this is a great pub experience. Worth going here with girlfriends. Not the place for business though."}
{"text":"Had lunch there today and it was a great experience. Never tried the craft beer but the food and service was great. We will visit again."}
{"text":"It's always nice to have a new place to go in the south so I was happy to see Fergus & Bix open in McKenzie Towne, I had been to the one in Marda Loop previously and remembered it as being pretty decent. We stopped in on a Saturday night around 5 PM so a bit before the early dinner rush. There were a few booths of people but the place was mostly empty. The menu and drink specials looked pretty good, although I had been working since 4:30 AM so stuck with water. We ordered the gyoza off their happy hour specials to start and I ordered a thai noodle salad and hubs ordered the crispy chicken burger. The food took a little while to come out, the gyoza was okay but the batter was really thick for my liking and it was more of a bready coating than what you usually get if that makes sense. Overall it was okay just not to my preference. Hubs said his burger was good and had no issues with his meal. My salad was only okay, the veggies and dressing were good however all the noodles (which were about half the salad) tasted stale and dried out, like they had been pre-cooked and just dumped into the bowl (what it tasted like to me anyways). They are new so maybe the kitchen is just getting used to the new menu, I'd give them another shot in the future once they've been open a bit longer."}
{"text":"For almost a year now, this is the place that my wife and I celebrate our Fridays, with Guinness an good food. Many times, family and friends join us there. Happy place, great atmosphere and top notch service."}
{"text":"This used to be our go to in the neighbourhood. The servers are awesome and the beer selection is great. Lately the kitchen has not paid the proper attention to food unless it is deep fried. In three separate instances we have had food that is improperly cooked (burnt brownie, slimy chicken wings, overcooked steak). The servers have always rectified the issue properly but the kitchen seems to be making their job difficult. Hoping that this issue gets sorted out because we used to love going here. Final concern - the menu could use an update."}
{"text":"I read the reviews and as we were looking for new place to try we ended up here. Physical space is great with lots of seating inside and a large patio outdoors. The nice choice here for seating is that they let you select your seat and follow up with menus. We chose the patio which has that later day sun and overlooks the road into the residential area so one can keep entertained by the driving habits of some and the parade of new cars driving by. The service here was good with numerous servers who refill drinks, bring napkins and check on your experience. This was a positive as there always someone in the area - it appears to be more of a team service concept. The food. My choice was somewhat disappointing as the Sicilian pizza suffered from the salami and italian meat leakage. Sometime with lesser quality italian style meats cooking releases the grease (not natural fats) which ends up in/on the pizza. Too bad as the pizza looked and smelled great. Chicken wing app. was good and flavourful while the salad main had a fair amount of chicken - lettuce could have been picked of curled and browned pieces. So, overall value - $52 including grat for pizza, main course salad, chicken wings and two soft drinks. Wee too expensive given the sweaty pizza. I hear another location is opening soon in Marda Loop on 33rd Ave. S.W."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been to the new location in mcKenzie town. We have been here 4 times and we absolutely love it! Every time we come we are greeted with smiles and 5 star service. The food is fantastic, the beers frosty cold and the food prepared at the perfect temperature. Everything  we have tried on the menu has been wonderful. We highly recommend this spot for great food and great times. Where's the 6 star smash button?!"}
{"text":"Great lettuce wraps, and ahi tuna appetizers,micro brew beers and always great service. It's a favourite place for business lunches or getting together with friends."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend for dinner and was pleasantly surprised!  This isn't your old dingy bar which the whole place reeks of wood floor soaked beer!  This is what I consider to be a yuppie pub!  A very strong selection of local and micro brewed beers on tap!  I had the fish and chips (halibut).  It came out with a nice two pieces of wonderfully crisp but moist in the middle fish!  My friend ordered the Fergus and Bix burger and it came out this behemoth burger!  He seemed quite satisfied.  Nice place!  Service was attentive and good!"}
{"text":"I can often be found here weekly. Food is consistently great, the burger being one of my favorites. Have sampled a wide variety on their menu and it is solid all around. The pizzas are a close second on my list. It is close to my home, but would be worth the drive even if it weren't."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good and they have a lot of menu options, but the atmosphere is lacking. The tables are oddly large and the noise level is quite loud. It can be pretty crowded most of the time. We come here because there aren't too many options near by, otherwise we would go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Awesome pizza.  Great casual place, good food, good beer,   A bit too loud.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Fergus continues to be a good place to go for a drink and pub style dinner. There are reasonably good micro-brews on tap, and the food options I have tried have been good. My go to continues to be the Tuna appetizer. Its never failed to dissapoint. Still think it would be good to have a few more good micro-brews to taste."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place!!!    The food is fantastic, we have been a number of times and never been disappointed."}
{"text":"They officially opened last night when they got their liquor license at 5pm, though you could go try their food since last Monday.  My wife and I arrived around 6:30 tonight and the place was about 2/3 full. Not long after, things filled up almost completely.  The service was good. There were a couple of hostesses to greet us though we were told we could sit anywhere. Our server was prompt after we had a chance to look at the drink menu and therein after.   The kitchen was a little slow. I don't have the most scientific method, but usually I get half way through my first beer when my food arrives. Tonight the food came just as I finished my beer and the server said for a second time that she would check on what was taking so long. The table next to us got their food before us though they arrived 10 minutes later.  The wait was worth it though. I went with the Steak Sarnie. It's a steak sandwich on sourdough with horseradish and arugula. The steak was perfectly cooked and piled high on the bread. The sourdough  was good but I don't think it really adds anything. The flavours from the crispy onions, arugula, and horseradish mix well but drown out the sourdough. For sides I had a Caesar salad (nothing to write home about) and the fingerling potatoes. The potatoes were simple but excellent. They were nicely roasted on the outside and tender inside.  For desert my wife and I split the key lime pie which comes with raspberry sorbet. The pie filling is more mousse-like; not as dense as your average slice. The crust though is very coconut heavy. I don't mind a little in graham crusts, but this one was a little overkill. The raspberry sorbet almost stole the show. It was nice and tart and super smooth.  What I'm liking here is that their beer list is completely craft. Unlike other bars/restaurants where they dabble, but play it safe with having Bud and other garbage, these guys are all in with more than 20 taps. Even their house brews are made by Wild Rose.   Great to have this place in the neighbourhood. I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"I came for lunch today and was quite impressed.  My dining partner and I were both intrigued by the Tacones. Unfortunately they don't let you mix and match between the beef and tuna so I order the tuna and him, the beef, so that we could try both. The Tacone is F&B's hybrid of a taco. If you've had a fish taco before (a good fish taco I might add, not the crap they serve at OJ's), then you can expect something similar.  The tacones were excellent. The seared tuna reminded me of the best fish taco I've ever had (http://www.yelp.ca/biz/pacific-beach-fish-shop-san-diego#hrid:2cqLQnUk6sG5GYQ91uVo9g). F&B's version was great, but but not quite as good as PB Fish Shop, but I'll take theirs any day since they're only across town and not the continent. The short rib Tacone was really flavourful and the meat was extremely tender.   At the end of our meal our waitress asked which Tacone we liked the best. Neither of us could choose as they were both equally excellent in their own rights.  When I have more time to hang out I'd like to come back and sample their tasty looking beer menu."}
{"text":"The burger was not very good. I hate that they required it to be cooked well done.The Caesar was way overdressed.  Service was very good. Overall, I would probably not recommend."}
{"text":"We just moved into the area of Aspen, and figured we'd try out the local watering hole - Fergus & Bix.   The place is quite similar to Original Joe's in its decor and clientele so it was hard not to direct compare when there is an OJs also in Aspen Landing.  The food selection isn't ranging in a whole lot of choices besides your typical pub fare, but they do these menu items very well.  I had the Italian Burger and thought it was just amazing.  Half pork / Half beef patty with cheese and marinara, it was super yummy.    So in food quality and taste, it beats OJs, for selection OJs wins.  In beer choices, they had SOME good beers on tap, but didn't get any winter seasonals in which was quite disappointing.   If you are going to call yourself a Beer place, you need to keep your taps rotating to fit the seasonal brews from craft breweries.    Overall, it was a good dinner, but not the most memorable, we will likely stick to OJ's instead."}
