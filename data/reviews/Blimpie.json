{"text":"Always fresh ingredients, clean store, friendly staff, excellent 5 dollar lunch choices.  Doesn't get much better than that!"}
{"text":"Amazing sandwich, exceptional service! All the staff was so kind and the owner was so friendly. I was even able to purchase a jar of the awesome sweet/hot peppers to take home. They are so good on salads and sandwiches. I wish there were more Blimpies around, but it's worth my 25 minute drive to this particular shop to enjoy a great sandwhich with great company!! Thank you!"}
{"text":"We are regulars at this particular Blimpie! Best sandwiches in the entire area hands down.  The owners are an adorable husband and wife team from India and they always know exactly what your order is.  Saillu is the best at the sandwich making and she always has such a big smile on her face and she really cares about her customers.  We wish they had a better way to advertise this gem of a place because they deserve all the business they can get.  So go here and tell your friends! They even have catering which is nice."}
{"text":"All Blmpies are not created equal. This is a franchise so the owner, management, and staff play a big part in quality and service levels. Having said that this is by far my favorite location. The staff is always great, and the sandwiches are not lacking in content and quality (I can't say that for others I have visited). I wish I could remember the owners name, but he and his staff are always friendly and accommodating. I believe he also owns the one on Hayden and Via de Ventura, unless they moved to this location. The icing on the cake is that they now serve eegee's! If you have never had one you need to. People who have lived or been to Tuscon will appreciate that they serve these. My suggestion is half strawberry and half lemon."}
{"text":"If you have never been to a Blimpie, then I suggest you drop everything and head over to one now. This has been to only sub shop I have ever enjoyed. Their Blimpie Best should be an award winner. Also, the customer service at this location is phenomenal! They are so we welcoming and kind. This will be my regular location for now on!"}
{"text":"They never get anything right and it smells like a pet store.  I would go into further detail but enough said."}
{"text":"I am new to Yelp and decided my first review would be on one of the jewels I have discovered near my home in north Scottsdale/Phoenix.  Several months ago I was on my way to Fry's foods at 64th Street and Greenway and discovered the shopping center had a Blimpie. I have frequented many sub shops over the years such as Jersey Mike's, Quiznos, Jimmy Johns, and when desperate Subway, but never have I been so impressed with my food and the accompanying service as I am everytime I go into this Blimpie.  Over the past few months I think I have tried every sub they have except the tuna (I can't stand tuna lol!) The meats they use are the freshest I've ever tasted. At other sub shops I have often felt that kind of burning of indigestion afterward, but NEVER have I had that sensation after eating at this Blimpie.  My favorites would definitely include their \"Chicken Cheddar Bacon Ranch\", the \"Buffalo Chicken\", the \"Sicilian\" and the \"Club\". And their ciabatta bread is to die for! The bread is always so fresh. Many times when I have eaten there the oven is full of freshly baking bread.  I have read all of the previous reviews and know that there has been some comments about the owners at this Blimpie. I have been fortunate enough to have been able to visit India, and compared to the food establishments I visited there Prasad and Sailu are like angels sent from heaven.   When I order my sandwich Sailu always remembers the sub that I have been eating lately right down to the condiments. And many times when it has been slower I have seen Prasad diligently cleaning their establishment. This is the cleanest sub shop I have ever seen!  I am so thankful I found this place right in my neighborhood!"}
{"text":"I work across the street from the Capitol and decided to go eat here for the first time. When I walked in I decided to order from the Samurai Sam's menu... Bad idea . I ordered the chicken peel bowl with brown rice. The chicken was gross. It had a lot of nerves and when I went to try the rice there was a huge white-blondish hair. Very disappointing. Wasted my lunch hour and my $9 . the food isn't even cheap so I thought maybe it would be good but I guess not. The place was empty and I went in at about 1 pm. That should have been a good enough hint but oh well. Just wanted to warn you people"}
{"text":"This place closed for awhile, as the previous owners went out of business.  Just reopened under new ownership, who made some nice improvements to the interior.    The staff is A LOT friendlier than their predecessors, though not quite as fast. I'll chalk that up to being new.  Also noticed that prices are slightly higher, but not much.  Spent $6.70 on a 6\" Blimpie Best, chips, and drink.    Altogether a good sandwich, decent value, and pleasant experience.  The people are great...you can tell they are trying hard.  If you play your cards right, they may offer you a free cookie."}
{"text":"I sent my son to pick up a veggie sandwich from Blimpie thinking it will be like the subway sandwich. When I opened it, the bun was soggy and the only veggies on it were tomato and lettuce with some pickles. The bun was also very thin on top and the bottom very thick and the top broken in couple of places. On the whole I was very disappointed with the whole soggy mess."}
{"text":"My favorite Blimpie in the valley! Owner is super nice and all the meats and vegatables are fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"Great customer service, wonderful sandwiches (they don't skimp on the meat like a lot of other sandwich shops.)  I eat lunch at this particular shop about once a week and I have to make a 25 minute drive to do so.  Plus they make the way I like it with no complaints (I have very specific wants for my sandwiches.)  The only regret I have is they aren't open late enough!  If you love sub sandwiches you can't do better than this Blimpies in Gilbert."}
{"text":"This place rocks.. best customer service smiley friendly people, awesome bread and tasty meats to top it off. . Great place to come for,a cold sandwich"}
{"text":"Never having eaten from a Blimpie's I was excited to try them out and really surprised. I expected something like Subway, but they are blowing Subway AND Jimmy John's right out of the water. If I have my way, I'll NEVER GO BACK TO SUBWAY OR JIMMY JOHN'S AGAIN!  My boss bought me a sandwich-the Ultimate Club-which is one of their warm subs, so I can't speak to the price. But boy oh boy was my sandwich good. No sooner had he laid it down in front of me and it was GONE! The bread was great, they didn't skimp on the meat, the bacon was real and not that floppy chewy stuff-it had a nice crunch to it, but wasn't overdone and I really love their peppercorn sauce!  My boss goes there all the time so they must have good service and decent prices.  I recommend you check it out!"}
{"text":"I work in the Pavillion Talking Stick Shopping center and find my self eating at Blimpies quite often. Their price is very affordable and their food is always fresh and delicious. I think it is the manager that has helped me out but he is very nice! He knows I work in the shopping center so automatically gives me a 10% discount. He also engages in conversations and tells me suggestions to get on my sub since I usually get the same thing every time. The manager of this place is what keeps me coming back and they will have my business!"}
{"text":"If I could rate 0 stars, I would.  I don't eat sandwiches as often as I'd like since bread is not technically part of a healthy lifestyle for me.  However, we were getting ready for vacation, things were hectic and I didn't really care!  Although my first preference for subs is Jersey Mikes, Which Wich & even Subway on occasion; I've had Blimpie in the past and have had good experiences.  They are just not conveniently located where I'm at most of the time and I do prefer the ones mentioned above in that order.    It had been awhile since I had one & my husband picked it up for me since it was in the area he was running an errand.  Let me say that I am completely appalled that I had to pay ANY money for what I received let alone $6.  I had a 12 in club sub. I'd rather pay $6 for a 6 inch sub that was higher quality.  One very, thinner than paper, layer of each: turkey, ham, & cheese.  Completely disgusted & not at all satisfying.  If I wanted only a bread and veggies sub, I would go to Subway & order their veggie sub, much more satisfying.  But in a time where I'm following an eating plan that is all about protein, I've become a protein lover.  However, even a non meat lover would expect more than what I received!  From now on I will stick with the other previously mentioned places when I want to \"treat\" myself to a sandwich w/ bread! See picture of just how pathetic my sub was!"}
{"text":"Simple subs. I have always liked blimpe subs they taste great. Simple assembly line style sub making."}
{"text":"My brother and I went to this Blimpie's tonight. We had some trouble finding it, so my brother called the store twice to demand directions. The first phone call went like this:  Blimp-man: Hello? My Brother: yes, where are you located? We're trying really hard to find you... (Etc.) After not finding it and my brother getting increasingly frustrated, this conversation happened: Same Blimp Representative: Hello? My Brother: yes, we can't find you! Where are you again? We really want to get a Blimpie from you!  (Etc.) Upon finding it, finally, we were greeted by a very friendly blimpie-maker. We told him about our hike to Squaw Peak, and he told us about his nephew's tennis tournament. We had trouble remembering everything for the sandwich that we were ordering since it was for our step-grandpa, but riley remembered the jalapeño cheddar bread and oil/vinegar, and I remembered the tomato, onions, and banana peppers.  At the end of it all, it was a good Blimpie experience! Our step-grandpa will definitely want us to get him a sandwich from there again."}
{"text":"My favorite stop. It is what you would expect all blimpie to be but unfortunately you can't expect this service or sandwich art at any other blimpie location. They are always generous with the condiments and veggies so much so I CRAVE these sandwiches. Always recommend to a friend."}
{"text":"If there was an option for no stars, this Blimpie would take the cake. I really, truly feel this Blimpie establishment is just a shame to the name. It's almost offensive to me because of what I EXPECT from Blimpie to go in here and feel like you're being lied to. I say this because when I sat down with my sandwich I was disappointed ( Ima girl, hard to please-I get it) BUT this was hardly a sandwich. I opened it and there were literally maybe 12 shreds of lettuce, 4 olive pieces and no tomato which I asked for no peppers which I asked for and no pickles which I asked for. When I asked why I didn't get them- the owner told me \"the turkey doesn't come with any of that\"....WTF. My sandwich has always had whatever the shit i wanted On it. Ok-so he says I can give them to you this time but normally I charge. Again, I questioned him. At this point I was so over the experience entirely. This is a SHAME SHAME SHAME SHAME SHAME to BLIMPIE everywhere. No customer service not clean and can't make a sandwich for shit. I have a picture of my sandwich here and from the Blimpie on 20th st. You make your choice :)"}
{"text":"Best Blimpie in the country all thanks to Kal!!! Haven't been here in over 5 years and he still remembers me!"}
{"text":"This is a great Blimpies. Great owenership and they make great, tasty sandwiches. I visit this sandwich shop weekly. Thanks for the great sanwiches! Definitely beats subway and jimmy johns that are down the street."}
{"text":"Fantastic sandwich shop all Blimpies are suppose to be the same but this one stands out the best out of all of the Blimpie's. Mike and his staff has the best customer service and the soup what can i say but the soup is by far the best. The attention to detail it's just all the little things they do that make them stand out. Five stars all the way"}
{"text":"Food is excellent and the staff is great!!! Love the soft bread, i make sure to pop up atleast once a week"}
{"text":"It was recently found out that yelp removed my review from 7/12 as \"unrecommended\". I want to review again because this is the 3rd time in 3 weeks that i have been here (I've been coming once a week for several years) and yet again a wonderful experience. Great sandwich with the time put into making it perfect for me, and I didn't pay a fortune for it. Full of toppings and the perfect amount of meat and cheese to balance out the fresh bread. I will be back next week for sure and will always recommend it to others looking for a great sandwich at a great price."}
{"text":"I would choose this store over any subway any day I've been going here for many years and was Never disappointed they're bread is so much better than subway and the owner is a great guy ! People use the internet to complain and the people who complained on here are normally hard to please people anyways 5 stars to this Blimpie!!!"}
{"text":"Had a wonderful experience at this location tonight. Family owned friendly place with fresh great sandwiches!! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"\"Who Yelps about a Blimpie\", right? This guy. This location of a moderately big chain of shops is awesome. The staff is super friendly. I'm sure that the sandwich making itself is standardized but I've been to several other Blimpies and subs just taste better here. Even other patrons here seem magically friendly. I don't get it but it's true. My office lunch crew thinks the same.   Between injury and vacation, I have not been here in awhile. I will certainly have to remedy that. A Club w/all the veggies, a New Times and chit-chat with pals sounds good.  Oh.  Map to the right is wrong, btw.  The shop is on the NW corner of Via De Ventura and Hayden.  ^_-  Update: So I went today.  It was great!  What is it with this place?!  The sandwich was yummy.  The people behind the counter were friendly.  Everyone in the looong line seemed so pleasant.  Like they knew the secret too.  The young boy and husband of the young lady behind the register came in.  Heck, even the kid was really cute and the husband seemed like a good guy.  Is this place on a ley line or something?  How does this insta-sub shop do it?!"}
{"text":"I love this place!!! They have amazing panini subs, and they also cater!!!!  The family who runs the business is so friendly!!! I would recommend to any friends or family!!"}
{"text":"So honestly, if we were just going based off of service, quality, and cleanliness, I would give this place 5 stars for a casual, quick sandwich shop. The loss of a star is nothing personal about this location, it's more about the chain.   I have been here a couple times now since they opened, as a break from a regular Subway sandwich. The family that owns this place is seriously so sweet. I want to eat here more just to support them.  The sandwiches I have had from here are pretty good. They take their time putting your sandwich together and you can tell they take pride in what they put out there. I definitely feel like the veggies are fresh and are a higher quality than Subway. I do wish that you could see the veggie area so you could know what your choices are. There also is not a list or pictures of what the veggie options are. While I appreciate that they are able to close the veggie area and keep it more sanitary and away from flies, etc... consumers have definitely grown accustom to seeing what you are putting together for them. This is nothing on the owner's, it seems like it is just the setup the chain has decided on.  Also, you should know to look at the menu item you are ordering closely- if it doesn't say turkey+provolone as an example and says turkey, that means it's literally just the meat, you have to pay to add cheese. Considering the cheese is a pretty modest amount, it would be nice if all the sandwiches just came with cheese. Also, they offer a lot of bread options but half of them you have to pay extra for. Again, these are not things specific to this location, if you have not been to a Blimpies before though, they are what to expect from the chain.   Anyway, if you are looking for a quick bite, but are sick of Subway as the only quick sandwich option like I was, give this place a try. It's a bit more expensive but if you take what I said into consideration and order on standard bread (which I like better than the pretzel bread upgrade) and order something that already comes with cheese, hopefully you will be pleased."}
{"text":"Disappointed in Blimpie. Love their sandwiches but I wanted to use a buy one get one deal (equal or lesser value) and I was told I can only get a footling and 6\" with that deal. I kindly explained to the Blimpie person that if one sandwich is $7 and the other one is $5, I will pay the $7 and get the $5 for free. I was told no - you only get one footlong and one six inch. I explained that 'equal or lesser' value means that since I am getting two footling and each is $5, I will only pay $5. I was told no again. Then the Blimpie person said I need to buy a drink to use the coupon. Ok - that's fine, but if we go by that and I buy a drink, why don't I get to use the 'equal' thing from the coupon too. I know it's not a big deal but that was the reason I went there - to use the coupon. Lame!"}
{"text":"I live within walking distance of this Blimpie's. I love this place. The food is great and the service is too. They have a great selection of breads, meats, condiments, and chips.   The Blimpie's Best sandwich is my favorite, prepared as toasted bread/melted cheese/heated meat.   When I first moved to PHX last fall I avoided this place because I thought it was fast food and probably like Subway, but I kept seeing tons of people going in there so I decided to give it a try. So glad I did!"}
{"text":"Excellent subs.. they don't skimp like other places.. very fresh. . Happy customer. ."}
{"text":"Just left the bargain movie at Bell Canyon Theater and decided to take Bell home instead of the 101.  Approaching 19th and Bell I saw this small Blimpe sign under the Chevron sign.  I've never had a Blimpe's but I was hungry so I decided to pull in and give it a try.  Ordered a Blimpe's Best on white bread with lettuce, tomato, onions, oregano and oil and vinegar dressing.  Now I've had Jersey Mikes's, Subway and Jimmy Johns all along Bell but I must admit this sub was better than all those and only $5.00 for a foot long,  The bread was so soft and warm, plenty of meats and cheese could be tasted with every bite.  The spices were perfect with the oregano being a real hit with me,  This location will be on my list of go too's after every show I go to at Bell Canyon.     PS: Went to another Tuesday $1.50 show at Bell Canyon today and stopped by this location to buy lunch for the wife and I.  Bought the wife a roast beef and provalone and I got the Blimpe Best again.  Wife enjoyed her beef great lunch at a great price"}
{"text":"Not the cleanest or most welcoming environment. Family owned. Decent subs, tops subway for sure."}
{"text":"Nice friendly location. Could work on the cleanliness of the place but not too bad!   Try the Sicilian- with slow-cured ham, prosciuttini, pepperoni, provolone, roasted red peppers and creamy Italian dressing. It's a great panini.  The Club-Slow-cured ham, oven-roasted turkey, Swiss with tomatoes, lettuce, onion, vinegar, oil and oregano but don't forget to add bacon!   The staff here is friendly and the food is mediocre.   Still smells better than subway."}
{"text":"This place is awesome, great food and great service! Neal and Cal  have owned and managed this location since I was a kid."}
{"text":"Had the temporarily available \"HOBOKEN\" sandwich.  East coast girl goes for East Coast italian sandwiches.  The meats were freshly sliced before my eyes and true to form I picked all the add-on's.  But first I had to pick the bread.  Lots of choices nowadays at these sandwich shops.  I picked Ciabatta because it is a rustic kind of bread that goes fantastically well with italian cold cuts.  Well, when I sunk my teeth into the ciabatta bread at home, it was not quite what I expected in the bread.  Ciabatta is rustic, with holes in it, crunchy on the outside, resistant to the tooth(a little bit).  This was not your typical ciabatta.  I imagine they made it at Blimpie so it is not the same as baked in a bakery.  Just don't call it Ciabatta--called it Italian bread or something but when you say Ciabatta you raise your customers' expectations.  Other than that I was happy with my 6\" Hoboken at under $5.  Can't be beat.  Service was quick and easy."}
{"text":"The staff is friendly and the store seemed clean. There weren't many other customers that I saw there during my visit but that may have been because I went during lunch and dinner time. The sandwiches weren't bad but they sort of remind me of a subway type quality. The layout is similar as well where they have the toppings layer out on the other side of a glass wall. I did like how they slice up the meat in front of you. Not a gourmet sandwich place but good for a quick bite if in a rush."}
{"text":"Fast, friendly service. Good value. As a NYC/NJ immigrant I'm all too familiar with the Blimpie brand and have been to the original Blimpie Base in Hoboken which is what brought me into this location today. On a sign in the window was advertised the new Hoboken Hero with salami, pepperoni, prosciuttini and provolone. I requested double meat and double cheese as I used to back east and the sandwich maker proceeded to quickly build my hero. I was pleased to see that Blimpie still slices most meats to order unlike many sandwich shops where it's unknown how long ago ingredients were prepped. (Have you ever seen a slicer at Subway? I sure haven't.) Parmesan bread was fresh and baked perfectly. One aspect of the older Blimpie stores back east is they tend to be shabby and unkempt however this shop is in ship shape; immaculately clean and bright with large almost floor to ceiling windows running the full length of the store. Customer service was on point and delivered with a smile. One bit of irony is I was helped by, and I kid you not, Jared! My sandwich was wrapped as requested, half to eat there and half to go, and we both had a good chuckle about the irony of his name."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a Saturday for a quick lunch. Looked for another one, but this location was on the way. Having been here once before and having had an unpleasant experience, we were a bit reluctant to stop again.   Ordered two subs, chips and a drink. Sandwiches were good. Bread was very fresh. Lots of veggies. Smaller selection of veggies than most places and no lite or low calorie condiments available.   The problem with this location (and why we won't be back) is the manager. The same lady was there as on the previous visit. She is unpleasant. Doesn't make you feel welcome.   Will not be back....."}
{"text":"So glad there is an eegee's here, service was great, store is clean and we'll be back!"}
{"text":"I very much enjoyed my sandwich. The service was excellent. They sliced the meat and even gave me samples as well. The bread is less chewie than subway. The prices are the same as subway. It is a family owned business so i choose to support that any day. Five stars on every level."}
{"text":"It's hard to not compare a place like Blimpie to Subway because...well they serve the same thing. This was my first visit to a Blimpie and I was not at all impressed.   Food:  The sandwhich was not bad but it was not as good as a subway sandwich. Why can't I see what vegetables I want to add?? You have to ask me on every item? Gets annoying. It's hard to mess up a sandwich and in this situation they didn't.   Service:  The staff was friendly but there is only two customers in the store. I stood there for 10 minutes waiting to order while 1 guy was slicing meat and the other guy taking his time with the other customer. No bueno.   Environment:  This Blimpie is EMPTY.   Price:  Paid $9 for what looks to be smaller than a 6\" sub with chips and a drink. Pretty pricey for what it is.   Food: 3 Service: 2 Environment: 2 Price: 2"}

{"text":"This place is a PHENOMENAL go to for a sub!!!  This location has been selling many of their subs at a discounted price of $5 for a 12 inch. THe bread is ALWAYS fresh, and so are the ingredients....  I always get the veggie and cheese and get ALL the fixings pretty much as far as veg, with oil and vinegar an' a touch of mayo. It's great with the parmesan bread.  Staff is always friendly and so is the owner I've talked with him several times.  Enjoyable!!"}
{"text":"BE VERY CAREFUL. THe other reviews on this business are fraudulent from the owner trying to keep his star rating HIGH. The one star ratings on the business give the REAL picture. Here was my experience....  First of all.... I would like to preface this by saying I think Blimpie sandwiches are good(as you can see I've reviewed another GOOD location and gave it 5 stars!) However this location does not deserve your business.  Here was my experience...  I walked in and a small lady was to take my order(mind you, you cannot even see your sandwich being made because they've blocked their sandwich window with a metal cover.) So don't be anticipating seeing if you want more or less of something on your sandwich because they've decided you shouldn't have that privilege.....  --As I was trying to order a man in back was clearly in a argument and raising his voice with someone on the phone. (Found out he was the owner, and that's about as unprofessional as it gets for someone running a business)--  Back to the sandwich... I simply ordered a veggie and cheese. Asked for all the veggies on it but like two things. (They have probably 8-10 toppings.) What I later found out I received: cheese, lettuce, tomato and a couple olives. WHAT?!!?  ......... The owner proceeds to end his argument on the phone to ring up my sandwich, attempts to charge me $2 more for the cheese on it(mind you, the same amount I get at my other location). When I tell him 'no' (instead of honoring it and giving good customer service) he has the lady remove two slices of cheese(that certainly he'll throw away) and takes the $2 charge off! He also tells me that he is going to report the other location I went to for years to CORPORATE because they don't do things the way he does. WHO DOES THAT??  ......END RESULT..... I received a very empty sandwich at a regular price. Poor service. And a bad energy and taste in my mouth for a place the doesn't deserve your business!! Go to a different Blimpie and don't give him the pleasure of your income.   Apologies for such a long review but I feel the depth is needed on such an experience that should have never gone so wrong for a simple sandy!! =)"}
{"text":"1. Quick place to grab a bite during lunch. 2. decent service. 3. decently clean place.   Just OK"}
{"text":"As a kid, I would go to Blimpie's with my mom and it was delicious every time! When you think of Blimpie you think of soft fluffy bread and sandwiches that melt in your mouth. When I arrived at this location, it was dead. We ordered our sandwiches and as soon as I got it, I looked at my boyfriend and said \"why does it look like this?\" The sandwiches were smushed down and toasted which we didn't ask for. Still thinking the sandwich was fine, we started eating the sandwiches and were instantly disgusted. The bread was stale and had a weird taste almost like play doh. I'm assuming they \"toasted\" it so it seems like it's supposed to be like that. The drink even tasted off. I would highly recommended to not go to this location. Blimpie is great, just go to a different location."}
{"text":"No Blimpies in Cali, so we never leave AZ without grabbing one of their delicious fresh subs.  We go out of our way to find them.  They have the tastiest, freshest sliced ham, I get the ham and swiss every time and you can taste the quality of the meats and cheses, the portion is very generous for the price.  The finely shredded lettuce, veggies and simple oil and vinegar hits the spot everytime.  My bf loves the BLT, extra B.  Why can't every sandwich shop offer simple tasty fresh sandwiches that don't bust the gut or bank?  Blimpie how I wish you were still in Cali, someday maybe, but these sandwich wars don't seem to be letting up and cheap junk like Subway still exist , along with over the top in portion and price Jersey Mikes and Firehouse.  Blimpie serves up quality, freshness, and good value everyday.  Mountain Dew on tap, kind folks running the shop, they knew their clients well, it was pretty neat."}
{"text":"Employee brought out bathroom cleaning supplies with toilet brush-placed in visible sink washed hands and asked me what I would like to order.  I said nothing and walked out.  Called manager over 6 weeks ago to discuss the idea of bringing toilet brushes in the food area and I haven't heard back from them."}
{"text":"I tried blimpie for the first time and all was going well with my veggie pattie footlong on jalapeno cheddar bread until I found a bug in my sandwhich. I showed it to the worker and she just took my name and number and said the manager would call me back. I spent $11 and only ate less than half the sandwhich cause after the bug I couldn't eat anymore of it l. I wonder what the food grade letter is for this store. It definentely shouldnt be an A or anywhere close to it. She offered to make me another sandwich but that would probably just have another bug in it. Stay away from this place unless you want to eat bugs."}
{"text":"I'm only giving two stars because the owner was polite and the place was clean.  The food on the other hand was not up to par, the sandwich meat was microwaved and the bacon was forgotten. The soup was not hot and also had to be microwaved and in turn got too hot and runny.  Like I said the owner was polite but he seemed very unorganized and kind of all over the place.  There was also a new employee which could have added to this.   Overall I just don't see the value when my food wasn't that great and I paid nearly ten dollars for a small sandwich and a large cup of soup...  Just stick to the cold subs and you should be fine."}
{"text":"Not a great lunch. Yeah, they slice the meats, but they must be the poorest quality meat in all the land by the looks of the turkey that was being sliced for the overweight woman in front of me. They were also slapping fresh microwaved bacon on her sandwich and the young sandwich maker had trouble handling the stuff because it was nuked too much. Staying away from the crappy meats saved me a bunch of heartburn, but the safe veggie choice was equally a failure. I guess the zesty parmesan bread was good enough, but all the cheese was processed slices and the lettuce was wet and all the other veggies just didn't have any excitement. Not even \"The Blimpie Way\" of a an oil and vinegar bath helped. The dirty rag that was used to clean the prep area was also kind of unappetizing. Only positive factory was the price of 5 bucks for a 12 inch sub. Probably should have bailed, but hadn't been to a Blimpie in decades and now I won't ever feel the urge to go back again."}
{"text":"It's a Blimpie.  What can you say?  Well, for one thing, you can say that the meat is sliced fresh - unlike other places named for underground trains and whose meat was sliced and packaged in a factory somewhere.  The staff is friendly, the place is clean and the food is good.  They have some good $5 specials now for either a footlong sandwich or a 6\" sandwich meal.  Get yo' Blimpie on!  Oh, and don't forget the sweet peppers.  Those bad boys rock!"}
{"text":"Clean. Prompt and courteous staff. Great subs toasted or regular. I love the toasted ultimate club on ciabatta bread. Definitely try the Eegee's slushee/ icee stuff. I usually don't get that kind of thing but they gave me a sample and now I'm hooked. Tucked between YC's and the theatre it's a little hard to see from the entrance to this strip mall area."}
{"text":"Blimpie is the best franchise sandwich shop around, especially this location. The couple that own this store are consistently pleasant and provide wonderful, friendly service. If you're looking for a great sandwich without emptying your whole wallet, Blimpie is a must! I wish there were more of these around the valley."}
{"text":"This location closed early tonight, 8/2/16. There was a hand written sign saying \" closed early due to an emergency \".  This isn't the first time this has happened to me at this same location! It was just shy of 6:45pm...when most people would be coming to get dinner for the night. I first went to another Blimpie on Arizona Ave & Guadalupe in Mesa. The employee didn't know how to make the chicken Caesar wrap and asked me what was on it. I was not very happy with this level of service after having to wait for him to come over to the service area and waiting for him.   Poor service and quality at both locations."}
{"text":"Very nice family runs this place. I have been coming here for years and they have always been nice to me. They slice the meat instead of serving pre-measured. They know practically everyone that comes in."}
{"text":"This is my favorite sandwich shop hands down! I love the food, I love the owners. They are sweet, kind and so nice to my kids. They remember their names, what they like to eat etc etc etc. I drive out of my way to come here. I have come here since 2007! Love it! Oh and the sandwiches are great too. Love the spinach wrap and my boys love the pretzel bread!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times for lunch as I work right next door in Costco. Decent food, nothing to rave about, usually have a good lunch special each day. They did just remodel the interior while being closed about two weeks. Inside is very nice now, more inviting and modern. It was really starting to look dated so the refreshed look is great. The manager is fantastic as well, always asking if you need anything, just making sure you're taken care of. Some days I just don't feel like coming here and I'm not quite sure why, but when I have gone in it's been okay. Nice to have that other option so close just in case nothing else sounds appealing that day."}
{"text":"By far the best sandwich shop in the north PV area. Bread, meat and veggies always fresh, and service is always exceptional. This is the type of place where th owners and employees know your name and sandwich! They always go above and beyond to make sure that you leave with a smile on your face. Almost forgot about the Eegees! A great summer treat if you've never tried it. Blimpie is one of the few places you can get eegees outside of Tucson. Neil the owner is a great person and really cares about his customers. Make sure you give this Blimpie a shot, if you haven't tried it in a long time, it's definitely worth it."}
{"text":"I read good reviews online for gluten free options at Blimpie.  My kids wanted sandwiches, so I thought I'd try it.  The employees didn't seem to know what was gluten free and what wasn't.  The menu only listed two salad options - the pictures didn't match the list.  I asked for what was in the picture, she made me something else, when I told her, she got angry and whispered something to the other employee and took my salad in the back.  She made another one, still not what I asked for.  It was $6 and totally unsatisfying.  The dressing came in cups, so no way to check if it was gluten free.  I thought her attitude would get worse if I asked her to change her gloves or wipe down the meat slicer.  I am not giving blimpie my money, even for my kids."}
{"text":"I love blimp is but this one is a joke. First off I've been here about 3 times prior and every time after 10 which is when they are supposed to open they are closed. This time they were actually open. I was the only one in there and it took 11 minutes to make my foot long turkey sandwich. When it came to toppings I had to repeat myself 4 times and she still got it wrong.  I was going to grab some chips to go with my meal but noticed that most chips expired June 20, which makes them 10 days expired. This place needs to get it together.... after opening my sandwich the lettuce was pink and there was only 1 slice of turkey on my sandwich and the bread was stale. Didn't even eat the sandwich. This place needs to be shut down asap. Calling the food inspector asap"}
{"text":"ciabatta roll was great but, just like subway, 1 thin slice of cheese and 2 really thin slices of ham. probably won't be going back."}
{"text":"I came here recently for lunch and thought I had walked in on a dinner theater production, or an episode of Seinfeld.  I was standing in line when the owner started yelling at a customer.  At first, I thought they knew each other, but soon I realized it wasn't an act.  To make matters interesting, he then decided not to honor anothers Blimpie card -- because it was stamped from another location: \"I get nothing from this!\"  \"Go away!\"  I guess there was no sandwich for him, or soup!  During these outbursts, some of the customers walked out in confusion.  I just took my sub and left.   In contrast, the employees all seem very nice and friendly.  But, I'll take a pass in the future and skip the drama.   Sorry!"}
{"text":"The service is excellent, the food is consistently good, and the place is clean. What more could you ask for? How about Eegee's!!!!! We stopped in tonight and we're thrilled to find out they now have Eegee's.  I always seem to order the same thing when I go to Blimpies. Turkey and provolone on white bread with lots and lots of pickles. The bread is fresh and soft and the pickles add the perfect tang to the sandwich. Over the years we have tried all sorts of different sandwiches but I always go back to my favorite. Tonight we had the added treat of Eegee's. We ordered a strawberry, lemon, and a watermelon and it was the perfect summer treat.  Sandwiches are a bit pricey but when you compare them to places like Subway it's worth it for what you get."}
{"text":"This Blimpies is quite a distance out of the way but they have Eegee's which it makes it worth the occasional trek across town and gives them 5 stars. The sandwiches are pretty good too!  I always get the turkey and provolone on Italian bread with extra pickles and it is consistently good. I don't know what difference it makes but they slice the meat when you order the sandwich. The toppings are always fresh, and the offer fast friendly service. My son always enjoys the meatball.  The star of the show here is the Eegee's. It's not just a summer treat. They always have the basic flavors; strawberry, lemon, and pina colada. They also have the flavor of the month. This month was lime. You can also get the party packs here.  The store is small but clean. There also have outdoor seating if the weather is nice. There is only one bathroom but it's fairly clean."}
{"text":"Great customer service.  The people who work here are genuinely nice. The place is clean, including the bathroom (which is a huge plus)."}
{"text":"Two stars at best.  This store is weird and maybe it's the Blimpie's process that is weird.  Their prices for the sandwiches are higher than other competitors, but maybe it is due to their sandwiches being bigger.  Their large sandwich is 14 inches as opposed to 12 inches.  But although their bread is good, they fill their sandwiches with the protein in a somewhat skimpy manner.  Also, this location the condiment area is hidden from customers' view, so you cannot see the veggies and condiments.  So you don't know what they have and what they don't have.  It is a game to garnish your sandwich -- you got olives? No.  What about cucumbers?  No.  Jalapenos? Yes.  Lettuce and tomato?  Yes.  Red onions? No, but we have white onions, etc. etc. etc.  And they got the salt and pepper packets behind the counter --- I guess for cost control purposes.  So I ask and the guy gives me two packets each of salt and pepper.  One each of the packets are empty...WTH???  Unfortunately, I did not really enjoy my lunch so I don't think I will be going back."}
{"text":"I base my rating mostly on the yumminess of the food, the overall cleanliness of the store and the friendliness of the woman who is part owner.  The loss of a few stars is all based on the man who also owns the store. What an unfriendly, downright unpleasant man. I don't know what his problem is, but he wouldn't know good customer service if it bit him. If this store goes under - I would blame it on how he makes customers feel.     I do know his hygiene is sorely lacking though. I've seen him outside smoking, then come in and NOT wash his hands and go back to making food. Same thing with riding his bike to the store, bringing the bike inside and going straight to handling food.   I think he thinks because he puts on those paper thin plastic gloves that he's ok not washing his hands. I don't think so - I also think that is against the rules in a restaurant environment.  Not to mention he will put on and take off the same pair of gloves repeatedly just to save a dime!  I've also seen his hands without gloves on and his nails are a bit long and DIRTY.  Plain gross.  The saving grace is the taste of the food and the woman.  Just steer clear of the man."}
{"text":"Clean and fast! The owners are kind and hard working. They know I have a limited time on my lunch break, so after I had been in a few times they memorized my order and now they start making it for me right as they see me coming in the door so I can get back to work on time. That is the kind of attention to detail that you don't see in every restaurant you go into. :)"}
{"text":"Sort of lost touch with Blimpies over the years. I've not always lived in an area where they had a store, but always had a warm place in my heart for them.   I recently moved into the area and found this location. WOW, nothing has changed and I mean that from a good stand point. The BB (Blimpies Best) and their Club is really very good and certainly as good as anything the Subways folks have at their place. I never understood how two similar chains could grow at different paces.    I would go out of my way for Blimpies, but I couldn't see myself doing that for Subways."}
{"text":"Blimpie's makes a good sandwich.  This was the first sub chain I ever ate in back when I was in college.  Then, it was either Blimpie or Subways.  I will not give in to temptation to list all the choices available today and within driving distance of this location, but obviously times have changed.  I come here twice a month, usually when I have coupons which might tell you something.  The Blimpie's Best is their tastiest and includes: ham, salami, cappacola, prosciuttini, provolone along with veggies.  Other Blimpie subs are: Roast Beef and Provolone, Ham and Swiss, and The Club.  I've tried them all over the years, but continue to come back to their BB.  Now the question you've been waiting for, are they better then Subways.  Well, at times yes.    Are they better then Jimmy Johns, Jersey Mile's, Capriotti's or Quiznos, etc.  No!"}
{"text":"Mark and his crew provide great service always friendly and kind even when packed with customers.  Best blimpie I've been to. Also they have eegee's which is a plus. Great customer service compared to other establishments in the area. My goto for lunch atleast once a week."}
{"text":"Amazing service. Restroom was really dirty and the Philly cheesesteak was really chewy.. tough to swallow."}
{"text":"Blimpies still exist? I was looking for something different from my usual work lunch stops so landed here. The place is kind of depressing (as are the owners), the ingredients for my veggie sub (I didn't trust the processed meat) were minimal and didn't look super fresh. The bread is very thick and takes away from what there is to enjoy of the sub. A poor man's Subway for sure, that will teach me to stray from the standards."}
{"text":"My favorite sub shop.  Great sandwiches friendly staff.  We stop there a couple times a week."}
{"text":"My first and last experience here was anything but satisfying. I ordered using their online ordering feature, and planned to pick up about an hour after ordering. I ordered a Turkey/American cheese sub with a variety of extra ingredients (including extra cheese and bacon which come at an ADDITIONAL charge). Pick up my sandwich and return back to work to find that the only things on my sub were provolone cheese, turkey, and mayo. I drove from work on my dinner break to get food so by the time I figured this out, it was too late to go back and have it changed. I basically got a turkey and cheese sandwich for $13. Attached are pictures of what I ordered vs what I got. Not impressed. 0/10 would not recommend."}
{"text":"Holy nostalgia! After a Yelp search to find lunch since I now work in an area I'm unfamiliar with I chose Blimpie. When I was a kid there was a Blimpie in Downtown Palm Springs and it was my favorite sandwich shop for years until it closed.  This location is very clean, the vegetables all seemed super fresh and tasty and the staff was friendly. My sandwich was delicious, nice solid BLT and it was prepared quickly. I chose to eat in the restaurant as a nice break from my workday. There's a decent amount of seating and everything was clean. The walls are covered with classic Blimpie storefronts which is super cool.  The only drawback is the parking, it's a very busy shopping center with limited parking. They do offer an order ahead option so I would just call them next time to prepare my order."}
{"text":"I used to love this Blimpie location. The couple the owned it previously was always very friendly and remembered my order.. even though I wasn't in there super often. They have recently undergone new ownership at this location and so far I am not overly impressed. When I walked in there was literally no one in there.. I waited for about 5 min before someone finally came out from the back to take my order. They apologized for the wait, which was appreciated. When I got home the bread was stale. Hope they can do better next time."}
{"text":"I go here about once every 6 months.  That's about how long it takes me to forget how lame it is and I start to think \"it couldn't have been that bad\".  As I sit here, eating my sub which inspired me to write this review, thinking about how I need to make better choices in life when it comes to choosing where to eat, I have to agree with pretty much everyone.  The people working aren't friendly.  The person making my sandwich had to keep looking at the board to see what was on it, only to find out that oh no, she wasn't new, the next person down the assembly line was actually new and being trained.  I'd go so far as to assume the owners take great joy in punishing the public at large, one sandwich at a time.  If I was a wizard, I would put a curse of eternal failure on the store, its staff and owners.  Really I just hope they'd go out of business already so a Subway could go in there."}
{"text":"I have been going to this Blimpies off and on for over 15 years.  They truly have the freshest bread and ingredients.    However, I am a simple man.  I will take me an ham and cheese sandwich with lettuce, tomato and mayonnaise on white bread and I am a happy camper.  A simple sub shop with simple ingredients for a simple man.  Look, if you want all the different varieties that Subway offers then Blimpies is not for you.  However, if you want a simple old school sandwich like the ham and cheese or even the roast beef with spicy mustard then you can not go wrong here.  You can even score a $5 foot long on select sandwiches and you can even make your sandwich a combo meal just like at the other places.  You remember the commerical ?  Simply Blimpie For Fresh Slice Subs !"}
{"text":"Went into the location and waited minutes for someone to appear to ask us for our order and even after we said Hello they didn't acknowledge us. Had to repeat order several times. It was very frustrating how nothing seemed to be in stock, no philly cheese steak nor soup was available. I heard someone as I was leaving being told some type of bread wasn't available (which is actually understandable, condiments and bread sometimes run out or need to be retrieved/baked).   Felt like we were being rushed and just didn't feel like a clean place. Will not go back."}
{"text":"I have given this place a several tries over the past year and a half. It is a franchise location that is run by an unhappy couple. In my 3-4 visits to the store I have never seen either one of them smile at customers. My trip today put the final nail in the coffin so to speak. As the man handed me my change he sharply said \"did I give you 3 or 4 dollars?\" As I stopped to look down at how many dollar bills he had handed me, he reached out and grabbed the other dollar which sent the coins flying out of my hand. I was kind of shocked at that point and walked away without saying anything. I will not be back.  Additionally, they are the only sandwich shop I have seen that charges an extra fee for using a debit/credit card."}
{"text":"I like that Blimpie has 5.00 large subs and they really pack on the veggies. I also really like their bread choices and that they carry some veggies that Subway doesn't. It's also better that they shave the meat as your Order the sandwich. That being said, the employees that work at this one aren't very friendly. Their lettuce was extremely wilted and brown and she put the vinegar all over my bread so it was immediately a soggy mess when I bit into it. It fell apart instantly. Bummer."}
{"text":"I love coming to this Blimpie location about once a week. I drive from Monroe and Central on my lunch hour because I love this place. They know my order now, and I like seeing the friendly & familiar faces! The place is also so clean...spotless, really.  Highly recommend it for a tasty, affordable and quick lunch."}
{"text":"This place is terrible, I just waited 25 minutes for a sandwich....tip for this Blimpie....get more employees"}
{"text":"Very good.  Not all blimp is are created equal and this one is the best.  Meat sliced fresh and bread always fresh.  They pile on the extras too."}
{"text":"Ok so from now on when there is one around I am going to go to Blimpie over Subway and Quiznos.  Why?  Because this place was awesome!  Advantages over the other two chains:  Marble Rye Bread is amazing.  Much larger variety of chips to choose from including my favorite Baked Cheetos!  Fresh sliced meats.  The owners at this particular location are great, very helpful and friendly.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"This was not the same place I remembered as a teen in California. Menu was completely different and has a bad attempt of being like a subway. On a good note the bread was fresh, but sadly I won't hit it up again."}
{"text":"Went with co-worker to grab him some lunch. I got just a soda, but his lunch was made fast and fresh. Very friendly workers there. Pretty accessible location. Decent place."}
{"text":"I LOVE Blimpie - a toasted blimpie best is amazing! Bright clean store, super friendly staff. This is my quick go-to lunch spot."}
{"text":"If you want the best BLT ever, come to Blimpie! The bacon is AMAZING...crispy, not chewy, and LOTS of it! I always get it on the parmesan bread...it's fantastic. I don't get other sandwiches there because the BLT is so darn good, but I've seen them make other kinds and they always slice the meats and cheeses fresh.  This particular store is not the closest to my house, but I drive the extra couple of miles because the one on Tatum and Shea isn't dependable. This one on 64th and Greenway never opens late or closes early. They are quick, polite, and affordable.   The only reason I don't give 5 stars is that frankly, I understand the opinions of the previous Yelpers about the owners' personalities. (Forgive me if I butcher the spellings, but Prasad and Sailu are the owners. They are Indian and they do have accents as such so you'll know if that's who you're talking to. At least one of them is there at all times. I have only ever seen 1 other person on shift at a time with them.   Personally, I am always relieved when Sailu is working as she is much friendlier to me than her husband is and she has great customer service skills. She always remembers what I want...even down to asking if I'm going to get \"regular mayo or chipotle mayo this time\". I love it. It makes me feel like she really cares about her customers. I love that she wraps my foot long as 2-6 inch sandwiches. This makes it easy for me to eat half right away and save the other half for later if I wish. Prasad...well...I think maybe it's a cultural thing about women that causes him to come across as kind of unfriendly to me. My ex bf and I used to go in a lot and those two men got along famously...but I see a completely different side of  Prasad if I go in now on my own. He makes my sandwich well enough, but he doesn't really speak to me and it's slightly uncomfortable. I'll still go in either way though because the BLT is THAT good.  PS: They have Pepsi products so I'm an even bigger fan. I don't normally get a soda, but if I do, I want it to be Pepsi. :)"}
{"text":"Best sub shop ever! Staff is always friendly and attentive, location is remodeled and clean and the food is an awesome value for your money. Get a panini on ciabatta or anything on pretzel bread and you won't be disappointed. Plus they have eegee's frozen drinks!"}
{"text":"This is a remodeled Blimpie that has awesome staff and service. I LOVE Blimpie paninis on ciabatta bread and the pretzel bread is amazing, too. Everything about a Blimpie sub is better - value, quality, taste, etc. This location serves breakfast also and now even has eegee's! eegee's at Blimpie = awesome!"}
{"text":"The guy was nice but the sub looked gross and old. It had an off smell. Ended up throwing it away and not eating lunch as my lunch break was over."}
{"text":"The window advertising is misleading and the staff has no idea what they are doing. The sandwich was made wrong and when asking for corrections  and/ or a  refund we had to wait ten mins to explain it over and over. I now know why Blimpie has only a few places left in AZ.   Don't go here. ."}
{"text":"I love the fresh veggies, ingredients fresh meats and the awesome customer service! The place always spotless clean. My favorite part,  the piña colada eegee's"}
{"text":"This is my favorite \"hero\" place of all time.  Some like Subway's better, but the combination of bread, with their trademark sweet peppers make this the place for me.  Try their Blimpie Best or Blimpie Super if you like cold cut subs, but their hot subs are just as good...  I go here at least twice a month for lunch..."}
{"text":"This Blimpie Subs location has very low quality of ingredients and the restaurant was filthy and I saw a dirty rag on the counter that they had been \"cleaning\" with, pretty sure it was a health violation. I believe it's owned and operated by a couple from India (the wife made my sandwich and the husband went in the back). I'm not being racist so put the cards away, it's a much different culture here in the U.S. though. It was the worst sandwich I've had in a long time. There was hardly any meat (two maybe three slices very thinly sliced) and a couple of thin slices of cheese and lettuce that was starting to brown and tomatoes that were starting to wilt. Also, the bread was too thick and spongy so it was basically all bread when you bit into it. I have pictures that I will add. I also didn't feel too great after eating it either, but I was starving at the time. I will definitely not be back and I would suggest avoiding this Blimpie Subs location."}
{"text":"Noon and I'm starving!   hadn't eaten since the night before... i could feel my stomach slowly eating itself! after picking up some stuff on my way back to work i saw Blimpies... as usual... seen it a million times but never stopped in.   there were a few folks inside... looked cozy enough..   the lady behind the counter wasn't very social... just what do you want.. and that was it... :(   i had a toasted 6in with roast beef/ turkey/ cheddar...  They didn't have very many veggies to choose from..... not even pickles...   for some reason the sandwich was really small and was not filling at all... i was still hungry...   It left me wishing i had chosen subway instead...   and just for that dinky sub i spent $4.75...   Not worth it in my book..."}
{"text":"This is the sub that even brought my wife into my recent sub kick! The bread is the difference-maker! This was my first Blimpie sub and it absolutely won't be my last! The aptly named Blimpies Best is a great place to start. Double meat for $1.50 is nice too. Some mayo, oil and vinegar (heavy on the latter), and some pickles and this was an unforgettable sub!!!"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of food available at this gas station location. The hours aren't as flexible as some other nearby locations but the food quality is there. The bread is as soft and fresh as ever. Some meats might be pre-cut and prepared in quick-to-access portions. My expectation is that this would be done fairly recently, although it does take away somewhat from the fresh-sliced feature."}
{"text":"Good fresh sliced quality meats and cheese. They also serve Eegees slushes. What could be better?"}
{"text":"First time at this location. Interested in purchasing an inexpensive sandwich. I was recognized as a first time customer with warmth but then allowed to purchase a sandwich on a upgraded bread without being told an extra charge would incur. My cheap tuna sub was over $7.00 dollars. It was a mess also and I will not be back."}
{"text":"Man this place sucks. Long long lines, one guy at the register. Took forever to order and get the food. To be fair I was behind five women who had it seemed had never been to a sub place in their lives, but when you have a line that long you need more than one guy. Out of a lot of chip varieties, no lids for the soda. Just go to subway, it isn't fancy but at least the line moves."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for years and have always had great experiences. The owners and staff are always friendly and all know my name and how I like my sub. I see the same with other people who come in, and there is definitely a very nice atmosphere.  My subs are always great and have lots of meat and cheese. The owners take pride in quality and I would recommend 100 percent."}
{"text":"This is the best sandwich shop, far surpasses Subway. They slice all the meat and cheeses fresh for every sandwich. They also offer Eegee's frozen drinks which are awesome!  The staff has always been super friendly and I can tell they truly appreciate my business. Keep up the great work!!"}
{"text":"I was on my way to school running  little late and I needed something healthy and quick. So I stopped by this location and gentlemen greeted me right away and with in a few minutes I was out of that store as a happy customer. My sandwich was good. Bread was fresh and soft. I will start stopping by more often before class now and I'm sure I'll tell my friends about this locations as well."}
{"text":"When I want a sandwich, this is where I want it from.   Soft flavorful bread (you are already ahead of the game because Subway and Jimmy John have hard and/or bland bread). Fresh sliced meats, cheeses and veggies (sorry but S & JJ have slimy meat and that's a HUGE turn-off), and when you take a bite of your sandwich and all of the mayo/mustard/vinegar/oregano have magically melded together...you'll be a believer too. Prices are slightly higher than Subway, pretty similar to Jimmy John, but the quality leaves them in the dust. My only suggestion would be for them to start a delivery service or subscribe to Grubhub.com or something like that so I could order it for our lunch meetings.   Oh and the service is always done with a smile. Great job guys!"}
{"text":"Not impressed. $14 for a buffalo chicken sub. That's the cost of just a large sub. The \"fresh baked\" bread had the texture and firmness of a cement block. I got the order to go but unfortunately found out about this rip off 10 minutes after getting home. The positive part of my first experience here is that I now know to never go back to this location. I'll stick with Jimmy Johns up the road. Hope this review is helpful to others.  Bon appétit bitches"}
{"text":"Just got home from picking up a delicious sandwich, from about the nicest people ever.   The facility is always very clean and the staff is always so accommodating. It's a special treat when you're waited on by any of the family that owns it.  They're charming and kind and make you feel like they've invited you into your home.   They always remember the usual orders for each of the 5 members of my family.  I was laughing as I read one of the earlier reviews because I ask for extra sweet peppers every time and they always accommodate me - happily.  I highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"It's been years since I've had Blimpie's Subs.  I was very happy to hear they opened a new joint in Scottsdale a few months ago.  Since they opened, I've dropped in here for lunch a few times.  My favorite Sandwich is the 12\" Blimpie's Best, $7.49.  I also get some Jalapeno Chips to go with it.

{"text":"very nice people, quick service to get me by comfortably on my 30 min lunch break from work. i love that they can press your sandwiches panini style, idk anywhere else that does that! since i go there 3 days a week, i signed up for the spendgo thing where i get $5 off for every 50 i spend.  i wish they had avocado, and i wish they made their sandwiches on a deli paper so that when they're throwing the ingredients on the bread, they dont fall out and eventually get thrown away. i hate seeing my lettuce, spinach, and olive get swept into the trash because its so hard to keep everything between two pieces of bread. plus, it should just be on paper for sanitary reasons, am i right?"}
{"text":"Just went there for the first time in years, probably will not be going back after the service and product I was given. I ordered a regular sandwich (5.99) ended up coming out to 9.03 after tax .A large sandwich of the same sandwich is ($9.99)  I asked for cucumbers and spinach on my sandwich which he said they were out of. And then when I asked why so expensive he said there was a $1.00 upcharge for the bread which does not say that on the menu ."}
{"text":"This had to be the worst sandwich I had in a long time. The white bread was so dry you needed to drop it in water to get any moisture in my mouth after biting into it. And we're the beef?  You think paying almost $8.00 for a sandwich you'd have more then a thin layer of meat on the dryed out bun and coniments Really lettuce is a free food in my book. Do your self a favor check your sandwich before you leave."}
{"text":"What's wrong with this store??? It's a beautiful 73° outside and it's 80° in the dining room. The woman that doesn't want to work here is making my sandwich.  Please train your employees. Customer service and good attitude is a simple request. I'm sitting in the restaurant now and she is right in front of me filling a drink, heated and yelling about something to her co-worker who is in the back kitchen. I don't speak Spanish, so I don't know what the problem is. Just silly to see the lack of SERVICE skills and lack of management to stop this nonsense."}
{"text":"Every time I eat blimpie's it is delicious and made with care. I love this chain! The sandwiches are big and fresh tasting! I love the selection of chips also and the frozen drink option!"}
{"text":"Pros - Right near my work. The customer service there is outstanding and friendly. The food is made very well. The store is clean and never looks cluttered. They are quick to make your sandwich as well.   Cons - The parking lot is shared with I believe two other agencies over there thus making it difficult to find parking without the fear of being towed.   Five stars keep up the good work!!"}
{"text":"Love this Blimpie!  They have very friendly and talented staff and a terrific menu.  As a creature of habit, I always manage to get the same sandwich so I can't comment on the many different subs and how they taste, but they will all be made with the same care and same fresh ingredients as my turkey on wheat.  The only downside to their subs, no matter which one you get, is that at some point, the great taste has to end."}
{"text":"Now look, I've been to a lot of Blimpies, and they're all pretty standard, but this really is a great one! It is always very clean and the couple who own it are very kind. The food, of course, is great and well worth the price. I highly recommend this one for all of your Blimpie cravings. You won't leave disappointed!"}
{"text":"Exactly what I expected from past experiences at other Blimpies. Lettuce was a little brown but didn't bother me. Sandwich was great and exactly what I expected."}
{"text":"Wow. Talk about some harsh reviews! Honestly, I'm not entirely sure what people were expecting when coming to a sub shop that seems to have taken the Quiznos route of just simply not caring anymore.  Although most people probably aren't aware, Blimpie is a Scottsdale-based company. Although considering they've been through numerous ownerships over the years, don't confuse that with supporting a \"local\" business, because it's still a chain - even if it's not one that's really popular anymore.  In some ways, I'd consider them to be a poor man's Subway - not that Subway is worth a damn to begin with. You can opt for the \"Blimpie Way\" on your sandwhiches, which is essentially the same as \"Mike's Way\" at the slightly superior Jersey Mike's.  I ordered a basic Blimpie Best. This consists of ham, salami, capicola, and proscuitinni. Throw on some provolone cheese and all of the other additions and you'll be in and out of there within minutes.  Although nothing was overtly wrong with the sub itself, I just found the flavor and quality to be lacking. Despite only ordering a six inch, I only ate half and gave the remaining contents to my dog, who quickly devoured the overly-processed meats. The cookie I ordered for dessert was on par with what all of these places serve.  Despite living very close to the plaza, I've only visited once. The place almost seems invisible. The restaurant is always empty and the workers clearly lack motivation, although unlike everyone else, I didn't have a problem with them.   Would I ever go back? Unlikely. And even though I've never been fond of fast food-level subs, I'd say you're better off visiting Firehouse.  Don't bother."}
{"text":"I really like their bread.  Always soft inside and not too thick or hard on the outside.  I like their fresh cut deli meats, but my favorite is always the TUNA, which is never soggy with mayo.  They do limit their toppings, but with great meat and bread all those toppings the competitors offer are not required.    They're always friendly and quick and the owner/manager is always there making sandwiches too.  Why buy a $10 sandwich at WholeFoods when you can get a better one at Blimpie's?"}
{"text":"This is a great place to eat! The sandwich maker was friendly and was very skilled at putting together my turkey and provolone sandwich. The gent that rang me up was courteous and thanked me for my business. The atmosphere is cool, fresh and clean. The sandwich and fresh baked oatmeal cookie was delicious! I highly recommend that you eat here."}
{"text":"This place is the best. They will make a sub to your liking and always, always exhibit a good vibe and attitude. Yeah it's just a sandwich shop but chit like that matters if you're ever going to have repeat business."}
{"text":"WORST experience at a blimpies. I ordered a simple turkey and provolone sub on white bread and asked for extra sweet peppers. The owner had the audacity to tell his worker to put a very little amount of peppers on my sub as \"they don't normally add peppers to this type of sub\". WTF?! Get out of here guy you're cheap and offer the worst customer service. No one else was in the restaurant so I don't understand why they both had attitudes. Not to mention the place is dirty as the owner uses several of the tables as his office area with paperwork all over and recipes throughout the floor.    Edit: Received a message from a user named \"Mike S\" over yelp calling me names and liking the multiple pictures I uploaded on yelp. HOW FUNNY THE OWNERS NAME IS \"MIKE S\"!  Wow then to top it off. There is a review uploaded to Yelp that directly mentions my review from a user, \"Kim W\" who created an account the same day the review was left. Just like the three other reviews left the same day from new yelpers with only one review (this place).  Seems to me Mike, the owner of the blimpies, is not happy with my review, calls me names then creates fake accounts to leave himself better reviews to increase his ratings on yelp.  L M A O you are pathetic Mike LOLLOL"}
{"text":"The customer service here makes this location unique. I've been coming here over the past year and the guys who work the early evening shift are the best! They are always friendly and go the extra mile. Just today they gave my family a whirl at trying their new eegee's frozen treats on the house! The store is always clean and they take pride in making great subs. I will continue to be a frequent customer!"}
{"text":"Wish I could give this one star. I wasn't expecting much other than a sandwich/sub...unfortunately it was the most boring, limp and flavorless sub I think I've ever had. I'll definitely avoid Blimpies going forward in my travels."}
{"text":"This is my favorite sub sandwich place around. Their ingredients are always fresh. Nice employees, make you laugh when you get to know them"}
{"text":"I'm a total blimpie head so of course I loved this. The blimpie employee here treated me like a regular customer and put extra mayonnaise on my blimpie as long as I wouldn't tell. So happy with my blimpie experience and am ready for whenever i get a blimpie craving again."}
{"text":"Those are are my friends and use yelp mobile know, J and I LOVE us some Blimpie!  Mike and Kathy, the owners, really go above and beyond when it comes to customer service.  Never does a visit pass where I walk through the door and I hear Mike say, \"HEY JILL!!!!\"  Or have Kathy ask how Little C is doing.  :)    Fresh product.  Like seriously fresh.  J and I always get the Blimpie Best, the Blimpie Way, with hot and sweet peppers added.  Seriously, so good!!  We get Little C a meatball sandwich, hold the bread.  He gobbles the meatballs down.  C is all about flavor, nothing bland for that kid.  So you know they have to be good meatballs!  :)  I'll never step foot into another Subway again.  If you have yet to try Blimpie's yet, what are you waiting for!?!?"}
{"text":"This is the best blimpie in the valley- they are nice and consistent. I've been coming for years and order the same ham and Swiss on pretzel bread- they always ask if I want it warm and toasted - I've gone to others and they never ask or get confused when I ask.  So when I'm in the area this is my go to sandwich place"}
{"text":"For lunch time during the week,.this place is not busy. I ordered the turkey and provolone. She wasn't skimpy on the toppings like some other sub shops(Subway)! Overall a tasty and filling lunch."}
{"text":"I was very pleased with my meal. I had never been to a Blimpie before and i can say i have been converted! Subway in the past and Blimpie in the future!"}
{"text":"The subs here are pretty great and so yeah... want a sandwich? Make it a Blimpie!  BUT. BUT. You guys. They have Eegees! The perfect combo is all three, just like Eegees itself. I think there has been a location to actually pop up in Phoenix, but when Blimpie subs is 1.5 miles from your house and you NEED an Eegees, this will do.  Great location, clean and Eegees!!!"}
{"text":"Better than Subway and the owners are very nice people. We came in after they closed, but the guy was still willing to make us a sandwich. We just got back in town after a long drive back from San Diego. We were hungry, but didn't want to get typical burger fast food. We walked in because the door was open and the Open sign was still on, but I think he was about to come lock the door. We asked if it was OK, he said no problem and made two sandwiches.  I usually come here for lunch every other week and it's always a nice treat."}
{"text":"This Blimpie location is the best I've experienced. For the past 17 years I have grown to love this place. The other locations I've checked out have been overshadowed by the service and quality of this one. I will continue to make quick lunch trips from time to time. The same lunch staff seems like they have been here forever. Truly a staple at Tatum and Shea!"}
{"text":"Well the Capitol has made an upgrade of sorts.  They got rid of the cafe in the basement last year and installed a Surf City Squeeze / Blimpie / Samurai Sam's Teriyaki Grill food counter.  I say \"counter\" because that's the only thing that has changed.  I wouldn't consider the food as better, but I think the name will pull in a larger crowd.  Last time I asked, the hours were from 7:00 AM to 4:00 PM, but they may close earlier on eves of majors holidays.  For break-y, Blimpie and Sam's serve typical foods like sausage, bagels, muffins, omelets, pancakes, bacon, hashed browns, yogurt parfait, oats & berries, etc.  Lunch bowls offered by Sam's: steak, chicken (breast or dark meat), shrimp, chicken & steak, veggies, or salmon.  Whatever you order will be slathered in some sort of sauce and paired  with veggies, rice, noodles, or tortilla.  They have a kid's bowl too.  Lunch at Blimpie is what it is.  I'll let you be the judge of quality.  They sell subs: hot, cold, wrapped, and panini style.  Also you can pick up burgers and fries, or go for a salad.  Not to be outdone by Sam's, they serve a kid's sub.  Surf City Squeeze offers a variety of popular smoothie flavors like strawberry/banana, orange, mango/banana, pineapple/coconut, peanut butter/banana, oreo/peanut butter/chocolate, et al.  They also give the option to create your own concoction.  And if you're one of those people who tricks yourself into eating \"healthy\", ask for the optional supplemental additives like whey, bee pollen, brewers yeast, wheatgrass, etc.   Want real juice?  Then ask for a 12 oz or 20 oz serving of fresh squeezed lemonade.  This is most likely a sell out in the summer!"}
{"text":"What?  am I really FTR on this?  huh.  weird.  Anyways, this blimpie's is in the shopping center near my office.  I come here from time to time because I actually get hungry on lunch!  Today was one of those days.  The good side of this place is that there's hardly ever a wait.  Even with a line, things move quickly and efficiently.  Menu selection is decent, prices are fair, and there's plenty of indoor seating.  They have a nice bread selection here, which I like as well.  Downside?  I kinda find Blimpie's subs to be...well, mediocure.  Its by far 10 million times better then Subway any day..but not enough to really impress my tastebuds.  Anyways, if your in the area, and want a halfway decent sub, swing by and pick one up!"}
{"text":"Stopped in today for a sandwich and an eegees....Nancy helped us,,she was very helpful and nice-the bread was fresh and delicious and the pina colada eegees was wonderful....."}
{"text":"I've eaten all kinds of processed monstrosities from convenience stores and never gotten sick, but this place takes the proverbial cake. I'm generally fine with Blimpies, but this particular location is not up to standard. The cheese tastes tainted or expired, and has a strange consistency. When I ordered a sub on pretzel bread, it had a large ring of green mold on the inside, which the employee did eventually discard, but their hesitation was disconcerting. I'm really not sure how the bread could have been stored for that long without being tossed earlier. If you want a decent sandwich in the Capitol area, try the DES cafeteria or Olde Station Subs instead."}
{"text":"The guys that work at this place are super friendly. I work next door at so I come over occasionally for a sub. They have a deal that if you come after 4pm you get any foot long for $5. It's super cheap and a lot better than Subway. They actually slice the meat in front of you. The subs are still kinda mediocre, but for the price you can't beat it."}
{"text":"The managers there are so sweet. They take pride in their lil establishment. The prices are on point! $4.99 for a sandwich, chips and drink. Kinda absurd if you ask me.   The bread is fresh, the veggies crisp, and the meat is sliced in store. 50 cent cookies too. Great spot, I highly recommend."}
{"text":"I've been going to this place since it opened.  I go frequently.  The bread is always fresh as is all the toppings no matter what time of day I do.  The people who work there are really nice and some of them I have gotten to know and always ask how my business is doing.  THe prices are great too!  I always get their $5 special...a 6\" sub, drink and chips.  You can't get any better than that!"}
{"text":"Absolutely awful, ham had a bad smell, opened sandwich and ham was discolored and bad!"}
{"text":"Located in a new shopping center in NW Phoenix.  I had the Blimpie Best Combo and the food was good, staff was fast and friendly... overall it was a good lunch."}
{"text":"What a delightfully friendly couple that own this place. I'm not going to talk about Blimpie's food quality, you all know what they have and what it tastes like. The owners, however, are very nice people that like to converse with their regulars and treat everyone like they are a friend.   If you're looking for fast food in this area, you should try this Blimpie over Taco Bell, KFC, etc."}
{"text":"Had a super duper high level kind of meeting and was hungry so I decided to come down stairs to this Blimpie for a bite.    This place was quite clean, service was pretty fast, the staffs were pretty friendly, and the soup I got tasted like progresso canned soup.  And on top of that, they nuked it in the microwave way too long, burned my hand trying to take the lid off, and burned my mouth eating it.  I ordered their largest bowl and they only gave me three things of crackers.. I need more than just three!!  That's like ordering 20 piece chicken McNuggets, and getting two little things of sauce..  WTH!  The soup was way overpriced so don't go cheap on the crackers now!    Overall a decent experience, nothing good to say about this place, and no real complains either.  I might come back... might...... if I ever had another super duper high level kind of meeting again around here."}
{"text":"This location is phenomenal! The family run location is always a bright spot in my week!  I was in the restaurant recently and a man was there complaining about a sandwich they already ate, which made no sense at all!  The employees stopped at nothing to make him happy, which seemed to be impossible!  As a life long Blimpie customer, I'd say the best sandwich is the Turkey Provolone on Parmesan bread, and don't forget the sweet peppers!  I always look forward to going back!"}
{"text":"They have yummy subs at an affordable price. I do love their Italian bread, but got the sourdough this time. It was pretty thick and didn't compliment the sandwich like I was expecting. Communication at thus location leaves a but to be desired, but it isn't terrible."}
{"text":"First visit to a Blimpie location. I've had hundreds of Subway and Togo's sandwiches. This Blimpie did a very good job and is now one of my top locations.  The sandwich portions and generous and the price is competitive with Subway's. Pepsi products is a plus for me too."}
{"text":"\"The bomb.com\" - that's what the fella who takes my order with a smile usually says.  The regular sized blimpies best super stacked (double meat & cheese) with most of the fixings is one hell of a good sandwhich coming in shy of $7!  Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"I had the BEST sandwich today. Got one each for my boyfriend and I. Both on the jalepaño bread, which was the softest bread EVER. Brought it home to eat and first thing my boyfriend says is \"this is a dang good sandwich!\" Highly recommend this place to anyone who wants a good sandwich.:)"}
{"text":"Yay!!! I second the first review!  Blimpie's is bomb and I will never walk in Subway ever again because I hate walking out smelling like bread!!!!  The guys who work here are all super sweet.. and even the women are too... shocking for me to say!  Much cheaper than Jersey Mike's too!"}
{"text":"Meh. Popped in for lunch today.   Nothing special about the customer service. The area behind the counter where the bread is could be a lot cleaner. It seems pretty disorganized.  The sandwich was pretty good but pricey at over $8 for a 12 inch/large. I like the fact that they offer sweet peppers!"}
{"text":"As a Tucson native and former Eegees employee, I cannot tell you how happy I am you all serve them here now!! Always get a turkey and provolone sandwich, which is very good, as well. Staff here are polite and friendly so every trip is enjoyable!! Highly recommend"}
{"text":"They carry Eegee's!!!!!!!  I love Eegee's but am rarely in Tuscon. Finally I have a place to go satisfy my cravings without having to drive 90 min.   Their subs are pretty good too :)"}
{"text":"Spent $16 on Blimpie sandwich combo. My chips were old, sugar cookie was rock hard and the lettuce on my sandwich was pink and brown. Never again will I go to this location. You cant even see them make your sandwich. If I would have saw that lettuce I would have left instantly."}
{"text":"What's not to like, clean, friendly staff, great sandwiches  and they have EEGEES!!!!"}
{"text":"I saw a flag on the side of the road on the way home from work and since I was starving I decided to pull over.  It's off the road a but and I never would have known it was there except for the flag/banner. Being that it was after one in the afternoon the place wasn't busy at all.  I got my sandwich to go expecting stale bread.  I was very pleasantly surprised!  My roast beef and provolone on parmesan bread was very good!  I would give five stars but I think the location isn't located in a prime and memorable spot and while Yummmy so pricey for a sandwich!"}
{"text":"This is the best Blimpie there is in the Valley! The owner is so friendly, helpful and he has my order memorized! The customer service here is great. And of course their sandwiches are so good, with fresh sliced meat and fresh toppings! The buffalo chicken is the best, I get it every time. Plus they have Pepsi products so I can feed my Mt. Dew addiction!  I would highly recommend this sandwich shop and specifically this location!"}
{"text":"For the price the large italian on white was excellent (Blimpie's Best). Service was friendly, prompt and professional. Didn't eat there but it looked clean to me.  Nice place for what is. Went again and place is solid...solid service, super friendly and clean.  Consistency is what makes winners and losers and this place be a winner!!! Adding another star for consistency...from 4 to 5."}
{"text":"Again. Owner is like a mom to me. She was closed on Easter and when I was staring through the window while she was just doing check up on the store and making a minor private order she saw me and told me they are closed. As I was getting in my car she ran to the window and psst me to come in and order  real quick while she was still closed. That alone is a million stars."}
{"text":"I always prefer Blimpies over subway and was on my lunch break I went on over. The man behind the counter was very nice and welcoming. The sand which was perfect!"}
{"text":"Would give ZERO stars if that was an option. The employees here are very unfriendly and rude. Restaurant was a disaster, none of the tables were cleaned off. Sandwich was awful and ended up making me sick as a dog for 2 days. Will NEVER go here again."}
{"text":"This is a solid location.  Restaurant was clean, service was good, and the sandwich was tasty."}
{"text":"The best sub sandwich I've had in a long time. Better than any other place around. Spicy cheese bread was great. And a big sub, chips and a drink for $5?? Great meal price. I live across the street and I will be back! Thank you!"}
{"text":"Great sandwich and very friendly staff. I wish they sold Coke products. I think this retail center needs better signage"}
{"text":"I was excited to see this place when I first walked in. It actually has Japanese food....that was a mistake.   First, all sodas were water down and it didn't even taste like soda anymore. We complained to the cashier and he didn't believe us. He walked over to the machine, took a drink, changed something on it and charge us on the warm sodas that we ordered from a bottle. Fine. Hopefully the food would be great. We both ordered a chicken noodle bowl in hopes that the food might make up for it. The chicken was so tough and the sauce was so sweet... we both ended up eating some veggie with the noodles. Didn't end up eating anything on it.   Save your money and go somewhere else. This place is awful. Bad service. Terrible food. I hate this place. No wonder their rating is so bad"}
{"text":"The employees here are amazing. I got fast and friendly service. Love how the bread is so soft. The meat is freshly cut and made to order. And they have eegee's the best ever!!!!"}
