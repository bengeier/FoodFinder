{"text":"When I feel like indulging in food that will surely clog up my arteries and sabotage my diet..I say this is the place to be. The amount of food they give you is ridiculous...it's enough to feed two people. The dining area is greasy just like the food, but who cares really when your in fried seafood heaven. The service is always great..the southern hospitality and great fried food is what brought us back twice. I will soon visit this place when the time comes to indulge in greasy food."}
{"text":"Nice service, more food than you can eat, great price. One of those places where you know it's going to be good food as you walk in the door. It's been there forever and keeps a steady business. Try it,  you'll like it!"}
{"text":"Very busy but worth it!! Local favorite.  Awesome catfish and shrimp!!! worth slippin off I-85 for!!"}
{"text":"Super delicious fried seafood. Wife and I stopped in had an order of the best fried oysters we have ever had ordered the green shrimp platter and the perch platter both delicious very reasonably priced definitely the best seafood on this side of Gastonia. If you haven't tried it then go! You will definitely be happy you did."}
{"text":"Easily the best seafood around. The shrimp jammers are unbelievably awesome. My favorite. They have something called stuffed flounder which is flounder stuffed with the devil crab and it is amazing too. My family of 4 always leaves with 4 to go boxes completely full. It's the best!"}
{"text":"Best seafood in Gaston County! You will not go home hungry. Great prices and plenty of leftovers to take home. Filet of flounder and shrimp my favorites!"}
{"text":"The staff is always friendly. The portions are always huge. Don't let the packed parking lot scare you, they move fast. Their chicken will satisfy any landlubber. The decor isn't going to impress anyone but the food certainly will. The best feel good food around, not heavy and saturated with grease. Yes it's fried but they mastered it."}
{"text":"As my husband and I sat in the crowded dining room of the Long Creek Fish Fry, all I could think of was that Talking Heads song...  \"...You may ask yourself, well, how did I get here?\" It was a surreal experience.   The answer?  By going to Hickory, NC to buy a car.    Sure, we could have bought a vehicle in Charlotte, but I was fed up with other dealers, and on a recommendation, decided to make the 45 minute trek to Hickory to save some $. On our way, we passed through Dallas, NC, and since the entire parking lot, and then some of the LCFF was packed, we knew we would have to find it on our return trip back to Charlotte and check it out.   You can smell the grease before you walk in, and boy, does the sight of all these people lined up outside get your tummy excited.  We knew we were on to something when we saw all kinds of people from all walks of life stream through the doors and patiently wait to be seated.   We ended up getting the small portion of perch, whole flounder and some shrimp.  MY GOD the small portion was enormous!  Add in our sweet potato and fries, and it was a huge meal fit for three or four!   The fish was flaky and moist on the inside, the fried batter on the outside crisp.  The shrimp too was fresh and hit the spot. Not over salted, seasoned just right.   Is most of it fried?  Definitely. But there are items like boiled shimp or steak and chicken that are not deep fried.   Note: something funny is the amount of Country Crock Spread (or other brand of vegetable spread, I don't remember) you're given for your baked potato or sweet potato.  We were able to make a small fort out of it!    Overall, it's a hike from Charlotte, yes, but it's an experience to be had.  It's a community restaurant...no, gathering place where couples and big families alike convene for a good meal."}
{"text":"Best fish camp in Gaston County. The fish and chicken are great! The small portions are extremely large."}
{"text":"The best fish seafood restaurant in Gaston county area. Everything is always fresh and good. The portions are plentiful. I also like that fact that they have a car side service now at their new location  My only downside is that the seafood platters are pricey."}
{"text":"Venue: Long Creek Fish Fry  Decor:   Pretty hold, a notch above hole in the wall  Service:  Prompt, quick, friendly   Environment:   old school. No really, like old school.  People of all ages but the old folk seem to love it.  When you're older, you're wiser (in most cases)  Food: Seafood City!!!    Prices: The best thing yet about this place  Debbie Downers: The lack of parking but that comes with the territory    Conclusion:   Let me tell you Yelp!  To the folk of Gaston County.  Southern North Carolina.  You have a Yelp Gem on your hands.  Like really, you have a yelp Gem!  Establishment been around in since forever. Seafood city baby!  Where do i start, where do i start?  The Parking is limited and if you come nights or weekends, just be prepared to be dropped off.  The establishment is not large but not terribly small. It is broken off into two seperate dining areas.  Oh, before I forget, this place has GREAT TEA! Digress.....  Fried seafood at your knees and it is down with TeamPortions!  The Lunch portion is big as most dinner portions if not more.  The dinner portions literally takes you two full days to consume. Unbelievable.  That's what I'm talking about.  They don't make it like that no more.  As far as the items all fish come with either baked potato or fries.  a gang of hush puppies and slaw.  All that was bangin!  Long Creek has perch, catfish, croaker, flounder, chicken (liver, tenders) fan tail shrimp, green shrimp, oysters, BBQ plates and seafood comes in waves of platters!!!  The lunch specials are under $10.  You get $17 worth of food by the volume for half the price. Done! Sold! Game, set, match!  The service was great, seats were pretty cramped but great food will offset that. if you are a seafood lover and live in the area (or visiting), you have got to go to this place like ASAP!  Overall: A++++++++++++++++++"}
{"text":"05/28/2014 Tuesday, Read all the reviews and decided to go today around 5:00 PM.  Called ahead for a carry out order, they said it would be ready in 15 minutes. I got the seafood platter, which includes, tarter sauce, slaw, fries, hush puppies, perch, butterfly shrimp, deviled crab and fried oysters. I also got a side of extra fried oysters.  Everything was packed in super thick paper bags so even though I was a few minutes late and still had a drive home time around 15 minutes it was still warm.  There is a carry out entrance into the kitchen, the fellow thanked me three times using my last name which was given for the pick up. Saying please return.  I'm 59 years old and been around and have had lots of fried fish. Lived in Maine, Chicago, had catfish in Kentucky, these folks are for real and they have excellent food. Even the fries had a different tasty taste! The hush puppies had an onion taste for part of the hush puppy seasoning.  Any bad reviewers have to be amateur spammers. I have a picture of the amount of food, which I swear is enough for four adults! I'll get the pic up when I figure it out.  Location is 5 minutes off I-85 at New Hope Road, Gastonia."}
{"text":"This is an OMG place providing you like and can tolerate fried food.  Fish?  Fried.  Oysters?  Fried. Hush Puppies?  Fried.  Only thing not fried?  Slaw, butter, ice tea, and tartar sauce.  One of the most unusual of local joints.  Parking scarce.  People had parked along highway.  In people's yards. And behind cars in adjacent home car ports.  The dual dining rooms would seat 150-200 or more diners. The crowds streamed in the full 1-hour we were there. There was always a line checking out and coming in.  This was on a Thursday night.  A local said, \"If you think this was something, you should try to get in on the weekend.\"  No thanks.  The outside line for carry out orders stayed backed up.  Food portions were gigantic.  We ordered half orders of perch and oysters.  There were 18 LARGE oysters and two full dinners of perch. There were enough french fries on one order for two hungry people.   Sweet tea was served at the tables in half-gallon pitchers.  Out the door, carry out went with a plastic 1-gallon jug of tea.   Everything was served in throw-away paper and plastic. While everything was fried, we didn't get anything that was 'greasy.'  These people know how to do fried food.  Service was incredible. A staff of close to 20 floor servers were like sharks - always in motion - but it didn't interview with their personable, friendly attitudes.  Prices were considered cheap for the amount of food.  Would not recommend Long Creek for people with an aversion to fried foods.  But once every 6 months, it was a surprising treat."}
{"text":"I had the croaker  and I promise I thought my grandma was in the back cooking me dinner . Our service was great even though the place was crowded from door to door. I will be back."}
{"text":"Delicious fresh fish, tender yummy hushpuppies and friendly staff.  The inside is a kind of worn & shabby but, hey, it's been there since 1948 - kind of adds to the charm.  Looking forward to visiting again when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"If you love seafood this is where you need to be. It is a friendly place and good food and you get a lot for your money. And it is always packed with people. It is a down home place to eat ."}
{"text":"We had a pretty nice experience here with our group of 7. My family has been here before on several occasions, but a first for my wife and I.  The wait wasn't bad, it wasn't too busy on a Wednesday night. We had a large group so I expected a wait, but it came out pretty quick. Everything was hot and fresh. I had the Perch and Flounder in a platter. My favorite were the hush puppies. I must have eaten a dozen or so and maybe a few more...who's counting?  Overall, I would recommend this place for a good fish camp experience. After living in Montana the last few years, I'd sadly forgotten how good a place like this can be."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good, and you did get a big portion.  That said, it was total chaos, we were sat at a table that had a tip still left on it and a half drank pitcher of tea. It took at least 20 minutes before we got our drinks. It was about an hour and ten minutes before we got our food. This was on a THURSDAY at 7pm.  Look, I get it, it was busy, but we had no idea that we were going to a didning experience as opposed to grabbing a quick bite at a fish camp.  If they had simply brought us some hugh puppies, or SOMETHING to tide us over, it would have probably been fine.   Also, I didn't get my perch with my meal. We also didn't get any tarter or cocktail sauce, and by the time I tracked the server down for the sauce I was worried the food was going to be cold. It was very difficult getting anythign except the bare minimum service.  When I told the guy at the checkout I didn't get my perch he asked me if I told me waitress. I told him no, that she barely came by the table because she was so busy, and he just charged me full price anyway.  Bottom line for me: The food was pretty decent, but let's be honest, it isn't exactly cheap, and it's not rocket science to deep fry fish, shrimp, and oysters and make them taste good. I'm sure the folks who have been going there for 30 years will keep them in business. (Same ones who STARED ME DOWN by the way when I came in wearing a suit. Sorry, I came straight from work to Gaston County to look at some land, straight there). That said, I don't think there was anything good enough there to merit me coming back unless I had an invitation and a reason to go."}
{"text":"This place is a legend! Great service and more food on one plate then two people can eat. It gets packed early on weekends so go early if you don't like to wait! If your looking for a quiet place to eat, this is not for you. The tradition here goes back 50 years so if your expectations are for a high end eating place you will be disappointed! If you like meeting new people of all walks of life, go here and experience great southern food and good talks!"}
{"text":"This is a great local legend fish camp! They previously had sit down seating but had to move due to family issues. Large quantities of food and fast service! More of a calabash style if that's what you want"}
{"text":"This fish fry location was just a big disappointment for me. If I was just coming here for the hush puppies then I would be somewhat satisfied but the croaker that I ordered was horrible. I couldn't even finish it. Personally, it was a waste of time but maybe my standards are just different. I appreciated the customer service and that's why I gave them at least 2 stars."}
{"text":"Best fish camp around! Food is delicious and very plentiful and service is always plentiful. My place to go for seafood!"}
{"text":"I don't understand how so many people think this is such a great place to eat.  I guess they just don't know better.  The food is greasy and the place is filthy.  They may have large portions but the food is grotesque.  I promise you if you try Catawba Fish Camp in Fort Lawn, SC just once - you will never go back to Long Creek again."}
{"text":"This is the best damm seafood place around these parts. YES I would not lie and worth the wait. CALL AHEAD.FOR TAKE OUT. This stukk will make your rongue beat your lips to death.Really its that good. IF you do not like fried food then get you some chicken   fries at BK"}
{"text":"More fish than u can handle. 1 dinner is plenty for 2 or 3. Keep this in mind when ordering. Sharing is caring. We were out of towners welcomed by the locals. Glad we stopped by. Servers were nice place was packed and the fish was good."}
{"text":"Cheap eats and they pile on the food!  Got the lunch special for $8.  Hush puppies, fries, cole slaw, and a mountain of perch fish that I could have eaten on for 2 days - SERIOUSLY!  Friendly customer service.  Would definitely return!"}
{"text":"I was craving some outstanding fried seafood on a wet Friday in January, with a torrential rain pouring down. There are some \"good\" seafood restaurants or fish camps locally near the Hickory area, but the granddaddy of all fish camps in the area is Long Creek Fish Fry, which has been open since 1948 and little Harry Truman was president.   It took me forty-five minutes of white knuckle, slick road / idiotic high speed wet road drivers, multiple wrecked cars in the median, driving to get there safely. As I was about a mile from the location, out of the corner of my eye I spotted a sign for Long Creek Seafood in a heretofore unknown location. With a Dodge Ram pickup truck tailgating me......I couldn't slow down or stop.   I went to the \"old\" location and turned around and then I was faced with the intermittedable, damnedable, unending, ill timed, solid stream of cars coming from first one direction and then the other. It took me a good ten minutes to pull back out onto the two lane highway, and by the time that I was able to retrace my travels.......I was not a happy camper.   So, I pulled up to the \"new\" Long Creek Seafood location, and luckily I found a spot right next to the front door.   I went in to enjoy some fine fried seafood, only to be slapped in the face with the realization that there was no seating. There were enough employees in the kitchen area to feed an army platoon of diners, but not ONE damned table, chair, or stool. I asked the cashier the blatantly obvious question, \"is this now just a takeout only restaurant?\" Answer: \"Yes.\" My reply, \"oh, hell.\"  So my options are: (a) get takeout and drive back to Hickory, whereupon it will be cold upon arrival. I am unusual in that I actually like cold leftover seafood, but that's the next day, not when I want some piping hot fresh seafood now. (b) Eat in one's car and have one's vehicle smelling like fried fish for the next two weeks, and probably ruining my pants and shirt with fish grease. Ummmm, no thank you to that option. (You can pretreat a fish grease stain all you want with Shout / Oxiclean / Tide to Go or whatever, but it will not completely come out of clothing.)  Sadly, the ONLY remaining option is to find a new sit down seafood restaurant elsewhere.   HISTORY OF THIS TRAGIC MOVE  It seems that even though this restaurant has been a Gaston county fixture since 1948, no one had the foresight to buy the land or the building that housed the restaurant. This is just plain stupid, paying rent for seventy years. Rule #1: own the property that your business sits on. That is why McDonald's is the largest real estate holder in the USA. You didn't know that did you?  When the grandmother who owned the business passed away, three new family members took possession of the business, and they couldn't reach an agreement with the property owner. A property owner who is now getting $0 rent on a vacant property that is permanently impregnated with the smell of fried fish grease.....a brain surgeon they're not.   So, ultimately, I can no longer have lunch here. I can no longer enjoy a sit down meal. I can no longer come here at all. This really saddens me. People who have enjoyed dining here will know what I mean.   I hope that the local community continues to support the restaurant, because Hickory area diners cannot. My only hope is that the new owners have the \"balls\" to build a new, LARGE, modern sitdown restaurant nearer highway 321 in Dallas. This has been a wildly popular business for seventy years, so I would assume that having or borrowing the money would not be a factor. I can't imagine a bank balking at a loan for a business that has been open continuously since 1948.  I will restore my rating to four or five stars.......when and if they ever move to a new location.  All of the details of this move can be found on Long Creek Fish Fry's Facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/longcreekfishfry  https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/long-creek-fish-fry-dallas?select=x6ovk2rL5-9oQgM3ar-G1w  RIP Long Creek Fish Fry. You will be missed.  ;o("}
{"text":"Awesome! It was a great people watching spot!! The food was good.. It's a flour base, I was confused when the server asked me about salt and pepper seasoning ... The portions were huge.  Sharing is a good option"}
{"text":"When you walk the first thing you will notice is that it's PACKED and poorly decorated. Don't let that deter you from eating! The place shows its age and is need of a makeover but the majority of the food remains timeless. The menu is diverse & what I would expect in a southern fish camp. Catfish, frog legs, perch, oysters, shrimp and more but I can't recall. I am not a huge fried fish person but I can for sure appreciate it.  Plus, you get so much it's literally insane! For 15 bucks you can feed a family of 4 and feed them well!!We ordered chicken, popcorn shrimp, and whitefish and it was amazing! Fried perfectly and came out hot. It didn't take long either which shocked me due the sheer volume of people that were there. People we packed in waiting for tables to open up. The Hush puppies were great. They had a crisp shell and a soft outer shell. Southerners need to get hip to malt vinegar with hush puppies at fish places though! I will need to start bringing my own!! The coleslaw was definitely an after thought to the meal. It was shocking how bad it was compared to the rest of the food. Tasted like straight vinegar and mushy cabbage. I was really disappointed in it.   Our waitress was super friendly and very informative when I had no clue what half the menu was. She helped me narrow my selection down on a vague list of taste and textures I wasn't fond of! She was right on the money too.   This place, while giving you an enormous amount of food, charges for every little thing .80 cents for a small thing of tarter, and .26 cents for WATER!!! They don't do math very well either. My bill was off by over 5 bucks!! The waitress tried to say it was taxes but I am pretty good at math so I knew that was not even possible. I checked it with my calculator to be sure.  Which if it had gone unnoticed. and done often could be a significant profit margin for the owners.   When I informed the little old man behind the counter he literally almost had a heart attack and had to step away. My bill was adjusted and it was blamed on a nameless person who \"writes the tickets\". It could have been a mistake or it could be a way for owners to make extra money... Either way check your bill.  I will be back though food was to damn good!"}
{"text":"This has gastonia written all over it. Lots of food  big helpings and fried. Southern food on a budget. Don't go here if you want to keep your waistline  and eat healthy. Cut off jeans kind of place"}
{"text":"Long Creek Fish Camp is arguably the best Fish Camp in the area. Even if you aren't a fan of seafood, you'll definitely find something great to eat here. And talk about portions!! As many people say, if you leave here hungry, something's wrong!!"}
{"text":"My rating is 3.5 stars. The portion sizes are wonderful, absolutely wonderful. It's just that the fish was a bit bland compared to fried fish I've had at other places. Friendly service. Good overall experience. I'd definitely go back."}
{"text":"The food is delicious and the portions are huge. I have never left here without a to go box holding lunch and another dinner.  Go hungry!"}
{"text":"If you like greasy fish this is your place. It was a lot of people there when we went so somebody likes it however the fish was so greasy that I felt sick after eating there. My friend went with me and she felt sick too. I don't know if it was the type of grease or what. The staff was friendly and they had huge portions but I didn't like the taste or the grease."}
{"text":"Nice people, huge portions but what's up with all the grease? The flounder was good but my plate had grease dripping on it. Not really a fan of this place. I don't see what the big hype is really, and until they recently moved locations the traffic in front was ridiculous. I'd much rather go to Riverside"}
{"text":"Place an order that was on the spot and at a time they were super busy, in the evening, and on a Thursday, after a pay day!  Food was as expected! Good Staff was excellent and they put our order together and into a box for transporting!  They do care!"}
