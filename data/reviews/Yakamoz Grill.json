{"text":"Decent chicken Shawarma. Disappointing runny, thin, watery lentil soup. Nice people."}
{"text":"I was hungry. I was desperate. I prepared a lunch for myself, but ruined it due to a faulty pepper shaker. I had to leave and find something nearby.

It was about 11 in the morning and this spot was open. I came in, not sure what I wanted and the lady recommended the chicken shawarma, as it'd be quick. It was quick. It was also kind of cold. Which.. wasn't good. They also didn't have the pickled turnips I really like. Despite the cold meat, the sauce in the shawarma really stood out. It was very flavourful and a bit curry-like in flavour. I might return to try something different next time."}
{"text":"Terrible food, please DO NOT eat here! one of the worst places I've ever eaten in my life, the place and the food had a horrible smell, I will never ever go to this nasty place again, I had to throw away all the food because I was afraid to get sick !"}
{"text":"By far they have the best Babaganoush in the city and I have tried many. The shwarma is amazing.  We go at least 2x a month.  They have just been taken over by new owners....I am hopeful the quality will remain consistent."}
