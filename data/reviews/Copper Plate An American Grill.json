{"text":"Pathetic service......Food pretty uninspiring...Staff indifferent and surly... Wow...what a waste of time and money.
This place is more of a place to drink..
If you want to drink before your flight this is a great place."}
{"text":"I was flying out of terminal 2 in Phoenix on 12/18, and we decided to have breakfast at airport Copper Plate.  Upon sitting down we ordered a tea and coffee.  We were told that they have been out of tea bags for a couple of weeks, which floored us.  We ordered water and I got my coffee, which was undrinkable.  We saw where this was going and decided to leave. When leaving, the lady asked us why and I told her.  She then snapped back, that everyone loves their coffee and huffed away.  Needless to say, it will be the last time we visit you site.  We live in Phoenix and fly out of terminal 2 a lot, so will stop at Paridise bakery first.."}
{"text":"Breakfast:
Food was comparable to a pathetic hotel continental breakfast. Very artificial and unsatisfying. It would have tasted better had the waitress brought the plate back in the kitchen for the cook to fart into! Same goes for the coffee."}
{"text":"Update: Had an awful delay going to Oakland to visit my son, the staff always remembers me and gives me the best service, I was so hungry I ate a green chili burger and a kids tenders and even washed it down with a malt!, great prices as always, only complaint was that it was a little hot in the restaurant maybe that was just my breathe from the green chili burger ;) anyways 10/10 would recommend just not the most reliable airlines but since your gonna be delayed anyway might as well eat at the cooper plate"}
{"text":"I didn't expect much for this spot being in the airport, but I was pleasantly surprised! I ordered the veggie burger with sweet potato fries.  The food was good and packaged nicely to go with all the fixins.  Furthermore, the portions are large and the employees are friendly."}
{"text":"On my recent flight to South Bend, IN, I flew through this Mesa Airport.  I stopped by this place because I wanted a sit-down meal and perhaps a glass of wine.

The gals attending there were friendly and attentive and quick, they did not have that same airport worker drone attitude that big airport service employees have.. .which was a pleasant treat.

I was even more impressed with the delicious and lush Rex-Goliath PN they served me in a beautiful, clean, sleek wine glass.  The spinach salad was huge, colorful and plentiful with chicken, goat cheese, pecans, and a tasty vinaigrette dressing.  Very impressed for an \"airport\" establishment when this type of quality is usually not the case: Friendly staff, bright and fresh salad with plenty of ingredients, great wine!

Too bad there isn't one of these in Terminal 4 or Terminal 2 :("}
{"text":"Not your typical airport fast fare. Great, real char - grilled burger with fresh quality toppings. Pleasant staff that were quick to serve. Worth the stop if you're hungry before you fly out. :)"}
{"text":"TIP #1 to Mesa-Gateway fliers: This is the ONLY bar at the airport, so live it-love it. 
Food is great. The burgers can be made low-carb - especially great this gurl! 
TIP #2: Food can be ordered to go..."}
{"text":"This casual bar/restuarant is located inside the Gateway Phoenix Mesa Airport in the southeast valley.  My father and I dropped into the bar for some pre flight drinks midday on a Thursday.  The bartender was incredibly attentive, quick, social and made fantastic drinks for us (bloody mary and glenlevit on the rocks.)  Their house vodka is Svedka and they also have several beers on tap.

We left the bar very happy people, but suprisingly wound back up there in their restaurant an hour later ordering a couple of Budwisers and Stella Artois on tap.  Somehow our flight got turned around on an Allegiant airplane due to a \"panel\" issue.  We pleasantly enjoyed our second time around in a booth with beers and shared a delightful ceasar salad and the soup of the day-brocolli cheddar :)

I can't complain about this little airport bar/resturant since their staff was so quick, friendly, and the food was pretty tasty.  I recommend swinging through here if you end up flying out of this quaint, clean, and affordable little airport in the valley."}
{"text":"I ate lunch at the terminal 2 location. I ordered the bacon cheddar burger and it came with a 2-inch piece of bacon and invisible cheese that the waitress swore was there. You definitely don't get what you pay for here."}
{"text":"We ordered the \"Good Morning\" breakfast with bacon instead of sausage, don't do that, the bacon could not have been served as bacon bits in a salad, it was very over cooked. The toast is fried bread WHAT ! Don't order what we ordered anyways, Brutal."}
{"text":"The food is alright; veggie burger is quite decent, but half and half (potato and sweet potato fries) were half cooked!  Staff is not that great - no eye contact or smile and messed up the order twice.  A few wait staffs look like drug addicts; if they hired recovering addicts or disabled, then hats off to them; but if not, then shame on them.  The only bar at Terminal 2, so the only place with beer, no choice!"}
{"text":"the food was very good and the service was very fast and friendly the cooks were very friendly and the patty melt was to die for, you will not be disappointed look at this patty melt wowzas!!!"}
{"text":"Wasn't expecting food as good as this from a little airport bar/grill. I got the breakfast tacos and for less than $7, they were a huge bang for your buck. Lots of protein and big serving. The menu has something for everyone. The icing on the cake was the host Kristoffer. What a friendly, funny guy. Will make sure I'm hungry before flights here."}
{"text":"Had pretty bad service. I understand it's near the end of the day, I'm sure the staff has been here all day, but I received no friendliness from the waitress. They messed up the order, she forgot to put in one of our meals, then We had to wait quite a long time to finally pay, and she didn't even properly ring up the price. Extremely disappointed. Food was average nothing great, fine for the price"}
{"text":"Best value I've had at an airport...the breakfast tacos were really good...I can't stand airport food and almost didn't buy but I think because it's a smaller restaurant they may work a little harder at quality than others. The five star is not because it's five star dining...it's because the value is five star worthy and the food is actually pretty good."}
{"text":"Food is worse than the cafeteria at a hospital and the staff is friendly but there is a lack of maturity and professionalism. Lack of clean tables to sit at and staff yelling and cussing at each other made it hard to relax. 

The staff needs an adult manager. The female cashier would not stop whining yelling and teasing her coworkers. I almost asked her to lower her voice. 

They were pretty obnoxious to be around and as it was the only food place open, i didnt have a choice. Maybe try to play music so the patrons dont need to hear the teenaged staff's inappropriate and loud conversations. 

Also people were smoking just feet from the entrance at the outdoor patio and the staff did nothing. Yuck."}
{"text":"Good heavens, it's a holiday weekend and both the service and the food are atrocious. At least three tables have had to have their food packaged to go because of the wait. Wendy's is a better bet if you are in terminal 2 at PHX."}
{"text":"Never got checked on, they were out of ranch, no salad dressings at all, and they had no idea how to make a good mixed drink. What a waste."}
{"text":"For an airport restaurant/bar, this is a lucky find. Varied menu, salads are fresh and large size, burgers are served hot with interesting toppings. Margaritas are tasty and tall, wine selection is tolerable, beer on tap, 2 TVs to pass the time.  Not bad for such a \"small airport\" kitchen and pub."}
{"text":"NEEDS brand new staff. Not friendly, no eye contact, not approachable, horrible vibe. Please make some changes!!!! Nobody greets you, and no sense of urgency."}
{"text":"Sure, some may say that Copper Plate is just an Airport Restaurant....but, our Service here today was impeccable.  The salads were fresh, tasty and plentiful.  What a nice surprise, while waiting for our flight.  Gabriella took our order with efficiency, in a very pleasant manner.  Torres came all the way out of the kitchen to offer to package up my salad personally, rather than having me attempt it, as he noticed me hurrying a little bit to get in line for the flight.
The only Restaurant/Bar available to fliers near the Gates, they all went the extra mile to give us great service... which they didn't need to do!"}
{"text":"5/11/18 12-4pm

Was greeted by an unhappy cashier and cook that we're eating in the lobby before taking our order and preparing it. 

The chipotle burger was delicious! Not spicy and the burger cooked perfectly, not flattened to cook quicker. I put mayonnaise on it and the bun was soft. 

The chopped salad WASNT good, the chicken cubes were tasteless and everything else from blue cheese to the bacon very cold and flat."}
{"text":"Good IPA in a bottle and 2 tasty burgers, one with hot and crispy fries and one with a side salad that had fresh greens and no iceberg.  We weren't disappointed!"}
