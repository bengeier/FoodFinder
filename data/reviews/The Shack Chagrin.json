{"text":"I ordered  a Polish boy and mild wings with Bleu  cheese. I didn't know that they forgot my dip until I got home. The food was absolutely delicious but I had to go back and get the blue cheese which was inconvenient but I don't eat wings without it. I understand that people make mistakes.. my plan was  to give this a 5 star rating. Had the lady apologized for her mistake I would have but the fact that she didn't really seem to care in fact, seemed a little annoyed that I came back for it. I really should give it a three-star but the food was good enough that I'll go back I just know to check my order. On top of that I did pre pay her and gave her a $2 tip on an $8 order which is over 20%."}
{"text":"Burger was delicious and cooked to order with choice of pretzel or ciabatta bun.  Fries good too.  Pulled pork was a little too drenched in BBQ sauce for my taste but was good as well.  Fried chicken is made fresh and seasoned perfectly.  They were out of mashed potatoes which was disappointing but cole slaw was creamy and satisfying.  Biscuit that came with chicken was probably reheated in microwave because it was tough and wirinkled on top sopping in butter on the bottom.  Chicken wings were large and very tasty with the variety of sauces available.  Smoky BBQ was superb.  Two ladies behind counter were friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"Okay, so I have only been once, and I will be going back.  They have a pretty extensive menu for burgers, salads and wraps.  But they also do Fried Chicken and some BBQ.  I am going to speak to the Chicken.

First, on the menu is a family pack.  If you are flying solo, just let them know and they will do a few pieces and a side.  The side I picked was coleslaw.  It was very, very good.  If you are a creamy slaw kind of person.  The chicken...well, do not be in a hurry.  Why...because they make it fresh to order.  So you get it HOT, crispy and juicy.  It is as homemade as you are going to get outside of the home.  Just a hint of Cajun seasoning.  Not spicy though.  This also came with a biscuit.  Unfortunately, it was rather old BUT you could tell in its prime it would have been great.

And lastly, the two ladies working the place were fantastic.  Very friendly, helpful and will carry on a conversation.  Nice to see."}
{"text":"Definitely call ahead to order food to go. Waited almost 20 minutes. All homemade food was much appreciated & very friendly staff. Food was mediocre. I like the way the Mac & cheese tasted but  it was like eating leftovers...not fresh or creamy. Place has lots of potential. I'm sure if they had more business the food would turn quicker & be more fresh."}
{"text":"Tried it for the first time. Good food at a reasonable price. Everything seems fresh. Larger menu than you might expect. Great place to call in and take out. Probably a good place for a quick lunch."}
{"text":"Great little place in the Bainbridge/Chagrin Falls area that I will definitely go back to. Prices are very reasonable, especially considering the quality and size of the portions. The staff were very friendly and helpful with our kiddo when she wanted to order something. I had the Cajun burger and it was excellent. It was cooked exactly as requested (med rare) and had fresh jalepenos that added a really nice spicy kick. My child had the pretzel bites and she loved them!"}
{"text":"Gotta say, this place was outstanding. The fried chicken was made to order. Piping hot and pure. The two sides we chose were the mashed potatoes (holy Jesus the flavor!) and the Mac/cheese (my kids are Mac/cheese snobs and loved it). We are excited to have this little treasure in our backyard. Definitely worth your time and money. Wish they delivered though."}
{"text":"Cooked to order. All is take out. Had the fried shrimp. Very good. Not over cooked. Substituted coleslaw for fries. Hush puppies were moist and tasty. The counter lady said that the subs are very popular. Must try the fried chicken."}
