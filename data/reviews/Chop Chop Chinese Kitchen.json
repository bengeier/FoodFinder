{"text":"I drove by because I happened to be hungry, and it was there. When I walked in , it reminded me a lot of Panda Express, except, I'd rather had eaten at Panda. The place was clean and quite, but I think I may have gone on a not so good day. I had the orange chicken, and it was a little chewy and rubbery as if it had been sitting under that lamp for too long. The egg roll had a weird taste, then again, when I went, I was pretty much given the scraps that were left. IF, I decide to go back, hopefully it will be better."}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch today with my son.  He likes chinese food, and he likes this place.  So instead of going to subway (my first choice) I decided to take him where he likes.

We've eaten here more than a few times.  Once was even close to closing time, and they happily made fresh items as they were out of a few things.  Today when we get there, they were not busy at all and as usual for a slow time, not all the items were full.  No biggie, I know they'll make more if need be, but it's always kind of weird to see a huge pan only half/quarter full of items.

My son had the Orange chicken with chow mein and I had Orange chicken, kung pao and fried rice.

The rice and chow mein were good.  My kung pao chicken had something burnt in it. I couldn't tell want was burnt, but I could taste it.  I finished my orange chicken, which seemed really dry this time, and took a bite of my son's.  I had to spit the whole piece out, it still had a huge section of bone in it.  The sweet and sour sauce seemed watered down.

As we were finishing up eating, my 11 y/o son looks at me and says \"dang dad, chop chop has really gone down hill\", I had to agree with him.

I'm not sure if this was just an off day for them, or if it was just the slow lunch hour, but I'll likely think twice before I spend money here again."}
{"text":"We went in with a coupon for a buy one get one half off.  I  asked if I could use the cuopon for fried rice she said I could.  Then charged us full price.  I asked if this was half price and she assured me that it was.  I thought that $14 or $15 dollars for fried rice was pretty steep and the prices were not posted.  I found the menu online and it appears she did not give me the discount for the coupon and lied to me about it.  I guess they do not really want our business.  Have not gone back and do not plan to we can go to the Rice Garden right across the street in Bashas. . ."}
{"text":"Did not order food we looked at the food in the display and it appeared old. So we decided not to eat there."}
{"text":"Went to pick up dinner and the are CLOSED!!!  Really liked this place for the amount of great food at a fair price. Please come back!"}
{"text":"The chop chop chicken is really good too! It's grilled with lots of char and teriyaki sauce added if you want."}
{"text":"This place is like a cheap version of panda express and the food is on display which makes the taste even worse. The taste of the food is horrible an theres another Chinese restaurant across the street called tasty asian kitchen that serves food way better than chop chop. I recommend tasty asian kitchen."}
{"text":"I recommend this of restaurants to everyone, they make the food fresh for you. I love their sweet-and-sour pork and their fried rice. :)"}
{"text":"ChopChop easily beats Panda Express. They cook all their food fresh and the portions are huge. I go there a couple of times a week and the customer service is always great."}
{"text":"I really love this place. The food is really good and priced very well. I know its cool to like Panda but when you try this place you will completely forget about eating somewhere else just cause its cool. I have gone to Chop Chop many many times and have never left unhappy. Also anyone I have brought to this place has loved it. Give it a try and you will be a Chop Chop fan."}
{"text":"Rather nondescript. You can find this place all over the country but it might be called something else. You know the place you go to that serves generic Chinese foods that won't kill you, but will not thrill you either. If one is just too hungry to drive another mile down the road, this is the place for you. aYUP it is ok, just ok."}
{"text":"CHOP CHOP

is a Panda type Chinese fast food, cafeteria style place. It seemed like the same types of food. Same type of plates/bowls/combos etc. 

It might be the same people working, you know \"we all look the same\" 

I had Chop Chop kids meal, (saving $ and fat) it was like a grilled chicken breast with Chinese BBQ sauce on it. It came with fried rice, spring roll and a drink. $5.40 with an \"adult\" sized drink. There was plenty of food for a lunch and it was good. 

I have nothing funny or cool to say about Chop Chop. It is what it is."}
{"text":"Reminds me a lot of Panda Express.  It was decent food, the service was good, and I would go back.  They are set up like panda, they have a lot of the similar items, unfortunately no brown rice.  The restaurant it's self is very clean.  It's in a great location too, lots of stuff in the immediate area.  Check it out!"}
{"text":"+Good price for portions
+Nice and clean interior for dining in
+Military discount
+Friendly service
-Selection of entrees a little small"}
{"text":"Well I wasn't expecting much but was hoping it might be at least as good as Panda Express . Well it wasn't . The chicken salad was very unimpressive . The combo platter was disappointing . I do like Tasty Asian kitchen across the street. Should have gone there instead. Cheaper and a ton better for lunch."}
{"text":"Well I figured I would try this place because it was closer then my usual Chinese spot.  The food is luke warm, flavorless, and mushy.  But that's what happens when your food sits out for two hours and then you sell it. With that being said there staff is friendly not bad prices and they have military discount."}
{"text":"The orange chicken had neither orange or chicken.  This place is worse than any other Chinese food restaurant at which I have ever eaten.  Don't bother."}
{"text":"Decent Chinese food if you are in a hurry. Dining room is clean and very industrial looking like Chipotle with lots of stainless steel. Prices are reasonable, service is quick, and the employees seem helpful. Good variety of Chinese favorites similar to a Panda Express, nothing exotic, food was hot and fresh. I got a large Mongolian beef for lunch and it was more than enough food for one person, added a little soy sauce and it was a good meal. I will eat here again."}
{"text":"Not good. Clearly a copy cat of Panda Express. Many empty pans so I wasn't sure what I could order.  Once our orders were half fixed a call for a take out order was called in. The owner took the call while our food sat there. What happened to taking care of the money in front of your face? The copy of orange chicken is bad. The \"chop chop chicken\" is a chicken breast that had been sitting under a cover for too long. The crab Rangoon are a joke, only cream cheese at best. Spider webs under chairs should of been our clue. We are really in a loosing stretch lately.  We will stick to Panda Express when we are seeking Chinese fast food."}
