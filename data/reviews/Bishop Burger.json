{"text":"Everything was fantastic! The burgers were freshly made while we waited. I had the veggie burger which was nice and juicy.  My boyfriend had the beef burger and loved it too. The fries were great too - nice and crispy.  However my favorite thing was the Mac and cheese bites!! Definitely a must try!! The guy working there was also very friendly and provided excellent customer service:) The only thing missing was a liquor licence (as of right now). Great place - will definitely go back!!! :)"}
{"text":"I've heard a few good things about this restaurant so I decided to try it. I have to say that I'm quite disappointed. First, the service was bad. There were only two employees present and it took far too long for orders to be received by customers. I for one ordered a chicken strip combo; simple enough. I waited for over 20 mins and nothing. I saw people come in after and order burgers and other items and still nothing. Finally, I asked one of the employees when I should expect my food, to find out that they hadn't even started making it! They took my money and I didn't receive what I paid for. Almost half an hour I was still waiting for my meal. Regardless of how the food may have tasted, this was not a good first impression and I don't think I'll come back and eat here again. Poor form, Bishop; very poor."}
{"text":"Don't come here. Even if you're really hungry go elsewhere. The fries are mall priced but the portions are sample sized. The burgers taste like something you'd cook up at home on a whim, but take 20 mins longer. The raw smell hit me as soon as I came in. Making my appetite lessen each step I took. I came here with a friend to find that her fries were not even COOKED. Considering that they practically dumped them frozen in the deep fryer, I'd expect them to be cooked at least. The owner is a nice person but it doesn't excuse the hilarious prices and disappointing quality."}
{"text":"I live close by and I decided to try this place and I'm sorry to say that others didn't have as good of an experience as I did! I thought everything was cooked to perfection.. the fries are great (REAL POTATOES) and the owner and chef, Jeff is really nice! Nothing here is frozen and he literally preps everything daily so as it is cooked fresh! I'm all about the burger joints and I have to give this place 4 stars I'd give it 5 if they were open later hours! I ordered the 6oz bishop burger combo with a strawberry milkshake and everything was delicious!"}
{"text":"Was visiting the area and came across Bishop Burger and was greeted by a nice woman. Ordered the Bishop Burger combo and they cooked it right in front of me which was great. Loved the food and the price was good for what you get. 3 women were all working there which was also nice to see."}
