{"text":"I seriously can't get enough of the pho here, I particularly love the vegetable and tofu option. The edamame is a great starter with a glass of wine. Many healthy and delicious spring rolls to select from. The staff is friendly, the service is prompt and the atmosphere is pleasant. I love coming here regularly."}
{"text":"Poor service is the status quo at this place.  I came in and sat myself after standing in the door way for a couple of minutes. I wasn't sure if I was supposed to seat myself because no one was their nor was their any signage  to direct people.  I sat at the table and waited for 10 mins and one had even said hello or made any eye contact.  There was a person at the table next to me that was having the same issue."}
{"text":"Went in around 9pm on a Saturday, was not crowded. Maybe 2 other tables. We were seated promptly, and given menus and cucumber water.   We then waited for 15 minutes for a server to appear. Which they never did. It appeared most of the staff was yukking it up at the bar. So we just left. Too many other good places close by to put up with nonsense."}
{"text":"I went to Rice Paper for the first time last night, and I had the best experience !  The food was fantastic!  I travel a lot and I have had my share of dining at various Vietnamese restaurants, but this is by far my favorite.  The spring rolls are made to order and extremely fresh.  The fresh veggies, and dipping sauces that accompany the spring rolls just round out the flavor profile. I also had the Pho. The Pho was fantastic  and very fresh.  I really liked how the beef was tender and a lot of fresh veggies. I had their lychee martini which the friendly bartender recommended  and it was chilled to perfection.  They used actual lychees to infuse the vodka and it tasted great.  The restaurant is cozy and their entire staff was very friendly and accommodating. Every time I come to Phoenix you know where to find me!"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner on recommendations from a friend and a giftcard from my sister.  We didn't have to deal with the parking nightmare so many people are complaining about because we have legs and can park a block away.  Didn't have to wait for a table, although if we would have shown up about ten minutes later...  The place filled up quick!  And I can see why.  We had the firecracker shrimp appetizer which we thought was very good, we ate all of it including the lettuce that was underneath, just to get some more of the spicy wing style sauce.  We shared a spring roll, I forget which one, it had imitation crab, some noodles, lettuce and something else?  My girlfriend really liked it, it was just a little too much (not meat and cheese) for my liking, I will say it tasted very fresh, just not my thing.  For the entree she had the beef pho soup and really enjoyed the hell out of it.  I had the (I think it was called) Shaking Beef?  Little cut pieces of beef on a hot iron with onions and some really good garlic sauce and white rice, very much approved and much more my style!  The waitstaff was very friendly and quick with water, always a plus!"}
{"text":"I was really excited to see a Vietnamese restaurant coming to Central Phoenix and have been watching for the opening and a chance to check it out.   I went for lunch on a Friday and the place was packed. I was dining alone so I sat at the bar. One of the two sisters who owns the place greeted me and got me some water.  I ordered a Tuna Fresh Spring Roll, the Firecracker Shrimp and at the last minute, when I spotted them neatly lined up on the counter, a Vietnamese Iced Coffee.  The Tuna Fresh Spring Roll was decent and the mango dipping sauce was good too. I had to go looking for the tuna though. I don't expect a whole lot of fish in one of those, but I shouldn't have to go hunting for the one thin little slice that was in each half. A little more would have made a more balanced roll worth the $4.  The Firecracker Shrimp was pretty good too. It was lightly battered and nicely spicy.  I like that the tails were off so it was easier (and neater) to eat.  My last minute decision to get the Iced Coffee was the best one. It was strong and rich and luscious! I highly recommend that item in particular!   Now for the reason I only gave this place 2 stars...The food arrived promptly, but no one - not even the owner who was mixing drinks in front of me most of the time I was eating - ever asked how it was. But the biggest reason for my rating however is that all through my lunch, the servers were piling dirty glasses from bussing tables less than a foot from my plate - repeatedly. The owner was mixing drinks on the bar ledge with dirty half filled glasses side by side.  I can totally see a barely touched iced tea refill mistakenly going back out to someone else's table like that when it's busy. So gross!!  They took my water glass by mistake because it was so close to the dirty cups.  I won't ever eat at the bar again. I might try a table and see how the Pho is.... maybe. I will probably stop in for an Iced Coffee to go - but that's about it. I really want to like this place, but they've gotta clean up their act."}
{"text":"We went after reading many good reviews about this place. I love the decor, creative use of the space.  It's modern yet welcoming. I mostly like the sink. They use round bottom cooking pans (these are the common pans used in Asian countries, I guess). It's a brilliant idea.  This place is not a good place to bring your babies nor toddlers, for sure. The space inside is pretty small and pack. The tables in the main dining room are all high top tables. Maybe if the weather is nice, you can bring your kids along and sit outside.  The food was great. We ordered a few spring rolls (Buddha - w/shitake, Enlighten Me - w/tofu, Spider - w/ soft shell crab, and Salmon). Each roll came with different sauce which I couldn't remember what goes with what.  The rolls were very light and refreshing.  There was no pretending, the ingredients simply spoke for itself.  I just feel it needed a little sauce inside to make it more unique in taste.   Then, I ordered the Grilled Chicken Banh Mi and my husband ordered the Shaking Beef. My Grilled Chicken Banh Mi was good but I've had better. It was a little dry, I wished for a little sauce or au jus. The chicken itself was pretty tasty. If you don't like fish sauce that much, you probably won't like this chicken because you can smell the fish sauce right away when they sit the plate down in front of you. I chose the garlic fries for the side. It was delish....LOVE it! I think they sprinkled some Parmesan cheese that make it very tasty. They served the plate with ketchup and spicy  mayo (I think) on the side. I loved the spicy mayo a lot, I asked for some to go.  My husband's Shaking Beef was served in a hot sizzling plate with rice and shitake mushrooms. I only tasted the sauce but didn't try the beef itself. The sauce reminded me of Teriyaki sauce. My husband said that the beef were pink inside, which he loved.   Service was good, staffs were friendly. We didn't really chat with our server because we were too occupied by our 17 months old. In our next visit, we're leaving her with her sitter.  Great place for night out!"}
{"text":"I'm a regular here. There was a time when I was frequenting this joint 2 or 3 times a week! The spring roll selection is varied and offers many options for veg-heads and carnivorous folk alike. I love their pho (specifically the pho tai with rare beef slices) which is super-flavorful. The staff here are very friendly. Parking can be a challenge, particularly during peak service time (weekends, peak dinner hour/happy hour) but fear not, there are alternative places to park and the staff are happy to point out where you can do so. This makes a great spot for a date or for a small group. Happy hour boasts great drink and appetizer specials. The restaurant is on the smaller side so you may have to wait for a table but it will be worth the wait for sure!"}
{"text":"Really enjoy the food. Service needs work. If you're a patient person like me, you'll enjoy yourself."}
{"text":"So many little things done wrong all added up to very disappointing meal. The spring roll was so-so, but they didn't bring any sauce or anything for it. My wife's pho was so-so at best. Doesn't hold a candle to da vang. My banh mi sandwich was, you guessed it, so-so.   The bartender refused to put in our happy hour drink order (even though the computer accepted our happy hour food order). The waiter got mad at us for canceling our non-happy hour drinks and got increasingly snippy at us as the meal went on.   I considered adding a second star for the nice decor, but honestly who cares what it looks like if the food isn't good and the staff are downright rude?!"}
{"text":"I had the Pho Chay and the Asian spring rolls!! It was exactly what I wanted and I'm now a very pleased  human! James was the best server I had in a while.. He helped me choose what I wanted  and I was very happy with it all! I will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"The spring rolls kick ass.  (Get the spider and put grandma sauce on it.)    They did a lot with the very little space that they had.  Although the place is small, digs are nice enough for a date night.    Pho is decent and it is nice to be able to introduce pho (even though it is a bit whiteyfied) to others who might not be able to get past the parking lot at places like Pho Thanh.    Going at happy hour is a good way to get to sample the menu.    I'm definitely a fan but here are a few gripes:  1.  My bill is always a little bit higher than what I expect.  (minor gripe)  It is just soup after all. 2.  What is up with the television?  Some days it feels like a sports bar.  Definitely kills the sexy vibe and turns complaint #1 into a major gripe.   3.  Servers could be a little less formal.  It is just soup after all, and you do have a television."}
{"text":"I find Rice Paper to be the standard that is on this section of 7th St, it's overpriced, and leaves me regretting my decision to try something new. I tried the spring rolls which were ok, although over priced. The true disappointment was un the Beef Pho. I swear, they used Steak-ums, or some other pre processed steak.  It tasted frozen. The frozen taste overwhelmed the whole bowl of pho. Nasty."}
{"text":"The food was good and we were happy to have vegetarian options. But, the seating and service were less than desirable. We called ahead to arrange for a table that would accommodate a person in a wheelchair. We were told that they were too small to take reservations, but that they had handicapped seating inside and outside. When we arrived, we were forced to sit outside because we could not get the wheelchair through the interior to a table that would have been okay for the wheelchair. There were three problems with sitting outside: 1) poor service; 2) flies; 3) the heat."}
{"text":"So I've been back to Rice Paper, and I have no major complaints with the food itself. But that's about it. The service is laughable. I actually said to my dining companions on my last visit (as we were walking to the entrance), \"Okay, so we'll order some appetizers which won't come until after the main course, one of the entrees will be incorrect, and they'll rush us out the door like it's a jiffy lube.\" It was as if I'd written the script for our dining experience. I'm officially done. Which is sad, because the food is pretty good. But i can't take the incompetence. Plus it's really loud. Still."}
{"text":"Love this place! Best Pho in Downtown Phoenix! I eat here at least once a week. Parking could be better but that the price you pay for dining downtown."}
{"text":"If there were such thing as a Vietnamese American restaurant, this would be it. The staff is friendly enough and ensures you are well tended to. While the interior has a mod, homey, startup feel to it, zero effort was put into the food prep. I ordered the pho ga, which had a generous portion of white chicken 'chunks' with fresh veggie accompaniments. Unfortunately, it's the broth that really makes the Vietnamese pho so iconic. The broth from this restaurant has the distinctive taste of 'instant soup base' a total injustice to the dish itself let alone being served in a restaurant. There are plenty of other Vietnamese restaurants in the vicinity that may not have the chic feel, but capable of preparing quality food in the kitchen."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants in Phoenix. When I lived close by It became a near obsession. I constantly crave their fire cracker shrimp with garlic noodles, phenomenal, must eat. Spider roll & enlighten me are my favorite rolls, the Asian pesto & grandma sauce are delish. The vegetarian pho and ban mi or bun salad (steak, rice noodles, veggies) I think it's called is great. I ask for some broth on the side and pour it in. I've turned my sister and her friends on too.   I will say its a bit pricey so try to go during happy hour if you want the shrimp or rolls. I've also heard the chicken wings are bomb.  One thing, this is not what I would consider authentic Vietnamese, it's more what I call chic-namese so don't go expecting that. If you want a great date place with delicious food with a Vietnamese flair, this is your spot."}
{"text":"Ok, I usually write longer more intricate reviews about a restaurant but for this new establishment I will summerize.  1.  Great decor and ambience; would be better minus the flat screens 2.  Friendly service; but needs more training with food and knowledge of  3.  Timing of Kitchen; if a table has two or more persons, food should come out at the same time or around the same time.  Especially when they are not sharing. 4.  Food; if you specialize in spring rolls, please make sure they are rolled up proficiently.  It needs to be tight, not loose:) Flavors are good, but there could be a variation of sauce for the spring rolls.  4 rotating flavors for over 20 rolls is not a good ratio. 5.  Pricing is not bad for some items, but I do agree with other reviews that for most items, the pricing is a little high for the neighborhood biz and the quality of food offered.  Overall, nice place to hang with friends for a drink and nibble before the actual dinner somewhere else. I will give it a few more months for an update.  This place has potential, but not well executed. When opening a restaurant, you should be ready and able to.  If you are not, you should wait til the staff is well trained.   I believe the owner or chef is inexperience.  Hopefully, it will improve... Get to work guys!!"}
{"text":"Interesting, but unauthentic.  I was looking forward to coming here.  I have become a foodie. My wife and I love to try new places and support local restaurants.  Rice Paper was on my list of places to try.  The place looks like a converted residential home turned restaurant.  The place was clean and trendy.  Service was great and friendly.  The server even brought our dogs some water to drink out side.  However the food didn't fulfill my expectations for a truly Vietnamese meal experience.  There was a lacking of authentic flavor in our dishes.  I believe the Pho was lacking in taste and substance as the meal was very humble and seems shy in the true taste of Pho.  \"Enlighten me\" spring roll was interesting as well.  I did like the crunch from the fried wonton skins in the roll however the jalapeno was a bit overpowering for me.  Salads were forgettable too.   Ratio of authenticity (ROA)  #Ethnic Patrons/Total # Patrons 0.1 (includes my party).  Although not very authentic in Vietnamese cuisine, it did show potential in some of their originality in their spring rolls.   Price was high as it is rare to have the price of pho at a whopping $10.    There are plenty of other Vietnamese restaurants which is worth the experience at half the cost.  (You may have to put up with poor service, but at least your stomach will be satisfied.)  If you find this review funny, cool or useful please check below."}
{"text":"A hip little eatery that embraces the intricacies of what Vietnamese cuisine possesses when conveyed at its best.The restaurant's sleek, modern and stylish lines match the food. Service was mediocre at best, but at least they weren't rude. Dessert was good, not amazing, but the meal more than made up for it."}
{"text":"We were here for happy hour and enjoyed a few of their spring rolls. We very much enjoyed a couple of them! One or two were just okay. But, at the happy hour prices, we were able to eat a good number without breaking the bank! Cute location and nice atmosphere. Really liked the laid back feel!"}
{"text":"Ordered the pho and pork spring rolls to go. The phone order was a little difficult but the employee stepped outside to get it correctly. My food was ready when I arrived and even though I've had pho many times growing up in Seattle. He still very politely walked me through the process of how to put it all together when I got home. Pho was great, spring roll was large and tasty and fresh. Excellent service, nice atmosphere, very friendly. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Great Atmosphere. Well prices. Original list off spring rolls and the pho was outstanding."}
{"text":"So absolutley fantastic. Went on a date there and it was our first time. The owner came over and chatted with us then we let him pick and choose what to bring and it was amazing. I wish I remembered the names of our dishes. Guess I will have to go again so I can give you more specifics."}
{"text":"Moved to the area, tried to go twice...  This is the place pretentious hipsters go to wait in long lines (around the building), deal with the same pretentious attitude from the servers, and pay double for a bowl of Pho. It's a tiny converted house in central Phoenix that they squeeze people into like sardines. No one in there was smiling or even came close to it (but most were hipsters... Soooo). Also, be prepared to park in the ghetto several hundred yards away from the building, then walk back through that same ghetto with your family to stand in line for hours.  Look I get it, the broth is real and hearty but this should not make a bowl of pho cost twice what everyone around you is charging.  The nested rice noodles were over cooked when they arrived at the table, the greens were only so/so, and the variety of add ins was very sparse.   You can't dress up a pig and call it a super model. You can't charge 12 bucks for pho in central Phoenix. There are 5 authentic Thai places that come up when you search \"pho\" in yelp. Choose anything but this place and you will get fast service, dirt cheap prices, and no pretentious BS disguised as a unique experience with a depressing indie rock soundtrack.  Don't do it. Stay authentic."}
{"text":"I work couple of miles from this place, and love their food spl pho, one of the best. The place is usually full at noon so I try to reach there at 1PM when it is less crowded."}
{"text":"We'll start by saying the food was great, well above average (coming from some food snobs), but read the rest of the review to see why they only deserve 2 stars... if that.   As others have said, the service was horrendous. We walked in and sat at the bar, and they acted as though we were interrupting them. As soon as we sat down, one of the waiters proceeded to restock the condiments right next to us, so close we almost bumped elbows. Then the fun began. The waiter with the shaggy light brown hair, gauged earrings, and beard was by far the most offensive employee I've ever encountered.   Regardless of appearance, he was flat out rude. He was blowing his e-cig at us the entire time while jotting down notes CONSTANTLY, to what I am sure will be the next New York Times best seller... disregarding his work to be done, of course. As though he wasn't offensive enough at that point, he slammed down a bucket of silverware next to us, in the middle of the bar with paying customers on both sides, and proceeded to wipe down the utensils with his unwashed hands... because I'm sure there was no better place to do that.    This guys was also the one serving food to the table... no hand washing... and chain smoking his vapor cig as though it were a race to the cancer finish line, which he was clearly winning.   I sincerely hope the business owner reads this because the food is really exceptional, but the service, the previously referenced employee in particular, will almost single handedly steer us away in the future. It's an absolute shame to trump such a culinary gift."}
{"text":"This would be 4.5 stars. Having lived in Jacksonville I have been starved for solid Vietnamese food, and this met some of that need. The spring rolls-both fresh and fried- were spot on and delicious. They have several varieties of fresh, and we ordered the spider with tempura crab, fresh mango and avocado.  It was amazing, oh my goodness.  The fried pork spring Rolls were perfect.  The grilled pork bun Mi was lacking, but a good base to build off of. The chicken in the noodle salad didn't do it for me, and it needed about twice the amount of noodles. The firecracker shrimp were tasty and the happy hour offers really good deals, well worth a visit!"}
{"text":"This is a small, cozy restaurant that is unique. The food is fresh and tasty. The sandwiches, salad, and spring rolls are very good. It is a little expensive for what it is but I will definitely go back and try dinner options."}
{"text":"I was excited to try Rice Paper, so I dragged the partner and our usual dining companions out for dinner on a Monday night. First impressions: Entrance not clearly marked, awkward parking, and empty boxes/trash littering the perimeter of the building. I realize it's the back of the restaurant, but that's the main parking area and thus the first thing you see. Anyway...once I walked in, all that was forgotten. The place looks amazing! Reclaimed wood tabletops, exposed brick,  intricately stenciled wall, custom dual sinks...the place looks great! Our server brought over the paper menu (see photos) and reviewed some highlights. He left us with pencils to mark up the menu. I guess the spring roll part is like a sushi menu (with boxes to mark off) but the majority of the menu is not. You can circle or otherwise mark what you want, but then you end up giving your whole order to the server anyway, so I think they need to work out the kinks on that one. Partner and I ordered two appetizers (shrimp and calamari), one fresh spring roll, one fried roll, and one banh mi.  The appetizers were delicious! Shrimp was plump and seasoned well with just a little bit of spicy kick. Calimari was lightly breaded and fried, served with a cool basil aioli. Fried + basil + aioli = can't go wrong. Fresh spring roll came next. We got the chicken/basil roll. It was good - not outstanding, but a good spring roll. The fried roll came next and to be honest I don't remember which one we ordered. I didn't eat all of it as it was just too mushy/greasy/soft on the inside for me. Others at the table ate the fried rolls, so this may just be a personal preference. I don't like fried-on-the-outside, mush-on-the-inside. Teh consistency reminded me of those cheap egg rolls you get with a lunch combo at a bad Chinese takeout. Better ingredients here, but same result. We got the braised pork banh mi. It was also good. Again, not outstanding, but good. Partner thought the pork was too dry, though he tends to find a lot of meat \"dry\" when I think it's just fine. The bread on the banh mi was crisp and light, though I think they could probably kick that up a notch. I really really like fresh baguette...this was close, but lacked that chewiness of a GREAT banh mi. None of the flavors really \"popped\". Now I'm trying to remember if there was any chili on the sandwich. I remember carrot/daikon with light flavor. hmm.  So that's why I give Rice Paper 3 stars. It was \"A-OK\". I do plan to come back (they were out of Pho and haven't started serving the steamed buns that are on their menu), so hopefully I can bump it up another star after my second visit.  After dinner, the owner came by and asked for our thoughts and her enthusiasm was amazing! The neighborhood is lucky to have her - I think she's off to a great start with a solid foundation. If she doesn't wear herself out staying up all night making that Pho, I think she'll do a great job of refining the place, listening to the patrons and modifying things to get it right.  (Sidenote: the place is tiny. One wall serves as the bar and has a half dozen stools. There are two large tv's hung above the bar. Maybe it's just because I'm not a sports fan, but I think the tv's over the bar took away from the ambience of the place. I'm sure she's hoping to attract some happy hour neighborhood sports fans with this, and that's fine...just not my taste and in such a small space, I think it detracts from the overall experience. Having said that, tv's are pretty ubiquitous these days, so not a deal-killer)"}
{"text":"I love the food here, don't get me wrong, but the service is another story. I've come here on three separate occasions and have experienced some of the worst service of my life. Being a former server myself, I know what is expected of employees and how to properly care for guests. I shouldn't be the one asking if I can order a drink or food. Pay attention to your customers. No one likes sitting at a table trying to get their server's attention because they haven't come by in 15 minutes."}
{"text":"This place has the best Pho in town. Clean, spicy (my preference), rich in flavors, and a cozy place. A Must have in downtown Phoenix."}
{"text":"I came with my friends who are highly enthusiastic about this place.  It's a cool vibe; I love how they transformed the house.  We had ok service.  It seems better than what some people have reported.  I agree with some of the other writiers.  $3.50-$4.50 for ONE spring roll is overpriced.  In my opinion, the biggest flaw is flavor.  I know Vietnamese food is not Thai; I know the food is not spicy.  I also know the flavors that should be in Vietnamese food, even \"Americanized\" Vietnamese.  But, the smoked salmon salad and surf and turf spring roll I had were not flavorful enough by a long shot.  My friends thought their food was fantastic."}
{"text":"I don't claim to be any kind of Pho expert but I do know that I like my Pho spicy so I appreciate the three sauces they bring out along with sliced peppers so you can tailor your soup to your own tastes.  The big bowls are pretty massive while the smaller bowls I'd say are still very decent sized too.  The Pho itself is a nice ratio of lots of broth with just enough noodles/meats/etc. - the perfect pick me up on a rainy day here in Phoenix.  This restaurant itself is in an old converted house (like many of the other restaurants in this area) so it's not the biggest place but the wait's usually not too bad if there is one. Parking lot is tiny - you've been warned."}
{"text":"I was looking for my new Pho place and came across Rice Paper...I will not be returning. I walked in and I was sat in the front of the place and there was a foul smell. Not sure if they had a back up in plumbing or if it was the result of mopping with an old mop but it was pretty foul. Ordered the Pho and was not good...way oily..very bland...didn't finish it as it was not edible.. Paid and left...gross..."}
{"text":"I've been to this place a couple of times because I  love Vietnamese food, however each time the food has been subpar.  The bahminh is served on stale bread and when I ordered a side dish that they were apparently out of, I wasn't informed and when I told the server they gave me the wrong side instead of offering to exchange it for something else he leaves it on the table when I specifically told him I didn't want it.  Needless to say I will NEVER go back there again."}
{"text":"Picked up my vegetarian pho to go and drove 15 minutes home to find two large chunks of beef along with my tofu and veggies. I've been a vegetarian since birth. I'm glad that I got it to go and didn't find the meat in my broth after eating half of the soup. Won't be going back to rice paper."}
{"text":"Most amazing service! The food is common pho and buns but the main attraction is what drew me in it's not your typical Vietnamese restaurant it's a SPRING ROLL BAR!! Fantastic drinks! Great addition"}
{"text":"I have eaten here three times.  The food was OK.  Service was inconsistent.  I guess I like traditional Vietnamese flavors over the \"modernized\" flavors.  I can get better Vietnamese food for half the price about 5 miles away at an authentic restaurant.  Of course, the authentic restaurant is a dive and has no bar.  The atmosphere, bar and nice vibe elevate this from a 2-star to a 3-star.  Getting service to be more consistent is really their #1 issue here."}
{"text":"Dad had a stroke and you're feeling blue? Heartbroken over the loss of a lover?  Then Rice Paper is the place to go.  My friend and I were having a bad day and wanted good food and drink.  We're both from out of town and found Rice Paper on Yelp.  The specialty drinks were amazing especially the Vietnamese Spiced Punch.  The calamari and spring rolls were scrumptious and they have reverse happy hour at 10PM.  The great food and service definitely put smiles on our sad faces.  I live on the ocean and the fish was exceptionally fresh, especially since it was Phoenix in the middle of the summer.  The only down side was that they could turn up the heat on the spicy dishes and drinks."}
{"text":"Service sucks! Will never come here again! If they make a mistake they make you pay for it! Really small. No parking."}
{"text":"The BEST Edamame I've EVER had! Pho was delicious n ambiance was perfect. When I got the bill...I was floored in the most amazing way. This place is my new love."}
{"text":"It's always tough being Vietnamese and reviewing a \"Vietnamese\" restaurant. Rice Paper Modern Vietnamese Cuisine is like an oxymoron since a lot of Vietnamese food that I've had seems to call themselves traditional. That said, I went to Rice Paper today for their happy hour which included $6 appetizers and $1 off spring rolls. I ordered the Fire Cracker Shrimp, Edamame, Spicy Asian Roll, Spider Roll, and the Chicken Cha Gio (Crispy Spring Roll). The Fire Cracker Shrimp and the Edamame were phenomenal! So full of flavor I couldn't get enough of it!  Now, where Rice Paper gets three stars is on their rolls and prices. For $4.50, $3.50 (hh prices), you get one roll that is cut in half making it look like you get two pieces. In any other traditional Vietnamese restaurant you would get two full spring rolls for about the same price, so that was very disappointing. The two spring rolls were decent. It's definitely something you don't get at a traditional restaurant. Cha gio was good but the nuoc mam (fish sauce) that it came with was very salty. Overall, everything I enjoyed about this place had nothing to do with Vietnamese cuisine so in the future  I will probably to stick to the more traditional Vietnamese restaurants like Pho 43 or Da Vang which give me the biggest bang for my buck!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with my wife. Should have known to avoid this restaurant when I read \"trendy\" in the reviews. Usually trendy means \"Americanized\" when talking about ethnic eats. I would agree that it was indeed trendy and indeed Americanized. I ordered a bowl of pho, a Vietnamese staple, it came out luke warm and bland. A no no for any pho aficionado. I would not come here again. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone who wanted an unauthentic experience with bland food but a trendy atmosphere.  If you want good Vietnamese food head to Tempe or Mesa. Pholicous or Pho Ao Sen. The reviews for these places on Yelp are pretty spot on."}
{"text":"This was my second time here, and the one thing that's consistent is horrible service!  The food is good, but I can't say the service is worth the wait."}
{"text":"I love Vietnamese food and I've been waiting in excited anticipation for the grand opening of Rice Paper just down the street from my house... But it was a total disappointment.  The restaurant is located in an unassuming remodeled historic home. The interior is modern and hip with a large bar. We were greeted by one of the owners who seated us and quickly moved on to chat up the male clientele.   The menu is \"sushi style,\" in that you mark your order on the menu. As vegetarians, we had very few options (2 fresh rolls, 1 fried roll, 1 sandwich, 1 salad & 1 entree). It doesn't seem like the menu was well thought out for the neighborhood, in which most restaurants try to cater to the large local vegetarian crowd.  We tried all the vegetarian menu items except for the curry entree:  The Vegetarian Tempura Roll was filled with vermicelli noodles, tempura asparagus, and fresh mango, served with a basil-based dip. Alone it was a little bland but tasted great with some Sriracha sauce mixed in the dip.  The Buddha Roll was mediocre. Again, it was bland. I had to smother it with plum sauce and Sriracha sauce for it to have any flavor.   The Saigon Bun Salad was horrible. It was literally a big bowl of plain vermicelli noodles, romaine lettuce and fried tofu with some roasted peanuts sprinkled on top - no herbs, no spices. The dressing (served on the side) tasted like it was made with rice vinegar, fish sauce and grated carrots, period. Really??? Ew! I had to make my own sauce by mixing plum sauce, Sriracha sauce, and some of the peanut sauce left over from the Buddha Roll for it to even be edible.   The Tofu and Shitake Mushroom Vietnamese Sandwich was made on a pleasantly flaky baguette, with cucumber, tons of shitake mushrooms, carrot, and a little cilantro. There was some sort of mystery brown sauce that again had no flavor. The one saving grace was the side of scrumptious sweet potato fries. The fries were hot, crispy, flavorful and came with a spicy homemade mayo.  The nonalcoholic beverage options were limited to soda, iced tea, fresh squeezed orange and grapefruit juice and Vietnamese iced coffee. The iced coffee was delicious but I wish they offered more options that would go with the food like coconut water, cucumber water, or even Thai iced tea, even though I know its not Vietnamese.  Honestly, everything on the menu could be excellent if they just added more fresh herbs: cilantro, mint, or basil. Most items had maybe a leaf or two but not enough to taste.  Also the sauces and dips were boring and tasteless.   Our waitress was friendly and helpful. Rice Paper may be a good first taste of Vietnamese food for people that are averse to trying new flavors. It seemed very Americanized rather than authentic, which is confusing since the owners are supposedly Vietnamese.   Mostly I was disappointed because I feel the place has so much potential. They use lots of fresh veggies and everything seems made-to-order. The atmosphere is cozy and inviting and I love to support local independent businesses. However, I don't see myself returning unless they overcome their fear of herbs and spices. For now I'll sacrifice atmosphere for flavor and drive the extra distance to Maxim's or Pho Avina - now that's my kind of Vietnamese!"}
{"text":"My family of 4 had dinner at Rice Paper after it was recommended by a friend.  We were there at happy hour.  We thought the pricing was great.  We had 4 alcoholic drinks and 3 non alcoholic and all were tasty.  We enjoyed the calamari, beef pho, several fresh spring and crispy rolls, a sandwich and garlic fries.  We were disappointed dessert wasn't available as everything up to that point was scrumptious.  Seating for 4 was tricky since most of the low tables seat 2.  We pulled some tables together and they were a little uneven but the quality of the food overcame all obstacles!"}
{"text":"This was a nice little Vietnamese place.  Had a couple Spring Rolls for starters that were really good and the Veggie Pho which was excellent.  The service was super friendly (we stayed forever after we had paid our bill and they kept refilling our waters and didn't rush us out).  I would come back again."}
{"text":"Hmmm... This is an interesting place. On one hand it feels hipsterish and trendy but we were seated in a high booth and the seats in many spots were splitting and pealing. The bathrooms do not have sinks and you must wash your hands in the hallway which is awkward.   The place was virtually empty when we arrived for lunch and the staff were very friendly.  They have interesting cocktails. My friends and I agreed they were tasty.  I ordered the grilled chicken bohn mi. It was... good. NOT a bohn mi in ay traditional sense except it was served on french bread and had a very small amount of \"pickled\" carrots and diakon. I would have preferred more to it. The chicken itself was very tasty. The garlic fries were excellent. I guess I was expecting something more traditional.   All in all, everyone was satisfied with their meal and I would probably go back if I was in town again."}
{"text":"Rice Paper's menu made it tricky to pick what I wanted to eat. I used my usual \"under-pressure-just-choose-something!\" method and went with two types of spring rolls. (Of which, they have over 10 different types. The waiter mentioned that Rice Paper can actually be considered a 'spring roll bar' rather than restaurant.) I had the traditional (pork and shrimp) and \"Buddha\" roll. My friends and I also had an order of edamame (without the spicy sauce). They ordered the vegetarian pho and two fish-type spring rolls. My friend with the pho really loved it. The two of us who had ordered spring rolls felt slightly, but only slightly, disappointed with them. I mean, they were good - but I wasn't blown away. The Buddha roll included mushrooms that made the roll a little too slimy - it wouldn't stay together while I was eating it!  I will be going back to try a few other things though, especially the bahn mi. The service was very good - we were well attended to and the waiter was patient to answer all of our questions. Rice Paper is a great addition to the 7th St restaurants."}
{"text":"Food is delicious and the place is really nice. the staff is also very friendly.  sometimes you can wait a little  while but its totally worth it.  Pho done right."}
{"text":"Hidden gem so stay away because I love this place and don't want no scrubs. This place is sushi grade Len the artisan from nhatrang Vietnam the first female sushi chef in Phoenix hand rolls authentic fresh reinterpretations reminiscent of her home flavors that she's known inherently and delivered then to our palettes."}
{"text":"What a great place to eat. They have so many rolls to choose from. One of my favorites in the veggie roll and shrimp roll. Great atmosphere but a little small so beat the crowd and get there early. Dessert there is only one but its always good. Creme boule. Its not very expensive but what I like most. Its fresh and very healthy. There sauces they make are great as well."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is intimate and cozy, the service outstanding, the Pho merely good, but the the prices were rather high which is why they are only getting three stars.    I would certainly go again, it's close to where my daughter lives so the convenience factor outweighs the higher price for the Pho than most other places charge.  The peanut sauce is so good I was tempted to drink it.    The Pho was missing the depth of the broth served at the Viet Kitchen, but was better than I've had at Pho Thang.  I am looking forward to going back and trying something else, maybe at Happy Hour so I can try some of their expensive specialty drinks."}
{"text":"Best vietnamese spring rolls I've ever had. Some include fresh fruits and the sauces are to die for. Had a boozy Thai coffee and was very satisfied. Haven't tried any other dishes but can definitely recommend the drinks and the speciality spring rolls."}
{"text":"I'd really like to write more positive reviews. But I gotta find some positive places first.  Our group of 6 shows up for lunch at 11:30. Tiny parking lot already full. Inside of restaurant only half-full (as everybody in Phoenix drives one to a car), but patrons are seated in such a manner as to spread them out as thinly as possible in the very small interior space, meaning there's noplace for a party of 6 except outside in the alley - I mean patio. We go outside as instructed, told a waiter'd be right with us.  We sit down and are completely ignored for the next 20 minutes. We go inside twice to ask for wait help. A waiter comes finally, he says he just arrived. Another 10 mins for water and to take our order. Food comes out   s  l  o  w  l  y,  one and two plates at a time.   It was pho and bun and banh mi, but the pho came with brown and withered basil leaves, brown-tipped bean sprouts, and not much else. I'm accustomed to seeing scallions and cilantro and lettuce with pho, but not here, not today, not even for $10.  Another diner's spring roll order was one spring roll - 5\" by 2\" diameter, and it cost $4. I thought this totally failed the bang-for-the-buck test.   My saigon bun (salad) was ok, pretty much what you'd expect, and fresh enough. It had no basil or cilantro though. The dressing tasted of nothing but straight fish sauce - far too fish-saucy for me. Co-diners complained about the strong odor of it. I've had fish sauce preparations in other Viet places and they were never this potent.   The Viet coffee I ordered at the beginning of service came out at the end of the meal, after our plates had been removed, this after the waiter promised on at least 3 previous occasions that it would be served immediately.   The interior design is pleasant. They need to learn not to seat a party of 2 at a 6-top at the beginning of lunch - you might just get a party of 6. The service was tense, frantic and way too slow for an urban work lunch - we were there for just under 2 hours. It was difficult getting out of the crowded lot because, well, because it's really too crowded for cars. I recommend parachuting in.  This place merits 1 1/2 stars, but I'm weary of writing one-star reviews."}
{"text":"If you go during happy hour, you'll get a TON of good food at a good price! The owner is awesome! This place is very dear to our hearts, especially as part of the local community.  The place can get a little cramped at times, (and hot) but other than that, we drive 45 minutes to eat there when we can."}
{"text":"Nice modern place, good food :) Will definitely go back for more! The beef pho tasted authentic, I am a fan."}
{"text":"Great, just what I need, another place that I am getting hooked on like it was crack that does take out.  I have to be super careful about Asian food because of the amount of fish and/or chicken that is traditionally used in this sort of cooking. This whole thing about getting fish in my food makes me nervous as I am unwilling to move onto the next level of consciousness with my karma in the current state of shambles that it is now.  This fear of fish makes me very hesitant to try new places. However, last week my GF and her esteemed friend talked me into going here for dinner. And DAMN AM I GLAD THEY DID!  Rice Paper is the business. So good, in fact, that we've had take out already since just eating there last Friday. So good, that I suspect, they're slipping in \"fat kid crack\" into the food.   I will absolutely be going back. Great food, good cocktails.   However, on a side note, be ready to wait for a bit. Its small, and has a funky layout. We hit it just right on Friday and walked into a table. However, for everyone that came after us, this was not the case. This goes double for parking.   Come patient, come hungry, and you'll be a happy camper."}
{"text":"Great experience at Rice Paper. Very cool interior and a nice patio. We sat inside and had a great server (Sorry I can't remember your name!). My wife and I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Rice paper! Cool name huh? Anyways I don't know about the bad reviews here on yelp but u gotta check this place out. It's hip modern and chill. Went there on a Friday night around 9, and was on a date with the most beautiful woman I have ever met (name was Sofi and won't give out the last name sorry) ..... My server recommend the spicy Asian rolls which were nice. Also recommend the Vietnamese beer which was good . Finally I'm all about places like this one. Small quick service and good music. Slightly stoopid played like 5 times I was is heaven!"}
{"text":"Delicious, quick without feeling rushed, and good for late night meals. Try the pho and the rolls."}
{"text":"Really good!  I highly recommend the braised pork banh mi sandwich.  Nice chunks of meat, well seasoned and not covered in a sauce; soft bread; lots of spice and pickled veggies.  The side salad  was quite nice, too.  Not just some iceberg shavings.  We had two rolls two, a spider and one other.  They had more delicate flavoring, and nice dipping sauce.  My husband wasn't quite as crazy about his beef pho.  Beautiful decor, super cheerful staff, and soccer on the TV, which will keep us there for a good long time.  We will definitely be back!   Oh, so your friend's soup doesn't arrive at the same as the rolls.  Big deal.  It was all tasty, and I'd rather have well made freshly prepared food than food that arrives all at the same time.   I didn't find it too pricey either - I mean, compared to sushi restaurants?"}
{"text":"We love this place. Been back a 3-4 times now and the only reason it is not a five star is due to the spotty service. I'll get to that in a second.   The food: We almost always start with a set of rolls and we've yet to be disappointed. Also the fire cracker shrimp and calamari are tops. We then either get and entree and salad to split family style or split a sandwich and salad. Either way, you can't go wrong. Their grilled pork is very good and goes well on the sandwich and/or salad.   Drinks: Plenty on tap and the bar tender will make just about anything you toss at him. They have Camelback Brewery's IPA which is one of the best local beers. With $2.50 pints during happy hour, you will not be disappointed.   Service: This is why Rice Paper doesn't get 5 stars, yet. They have lots of people working in the small house but the waitstaff we've had has almost consistently disappointed. This last time we had our rolls on the table while our drinks languished at the bar. Our server seemed a little overwhelmed. This was our experience with a different server on another night. The bus staff outnumber the wait staff and they are always trying to take plates away, which can get annoying when eating family style.   To summarize, definitely try Rice Paper and support this great new local business. If they could just get their service delivery down we would probably go back even more."}
{"text":"Not recommended. The server was amazing, she gets 5 stars. However,  the chef obviously doesn't taste his/her food. I ordered Pho,  the broth was horribly bland and one of the key ingredients (tripe) was omitted.  I also ordered traditional a spring roll. The spring roll wasn't too bad but the peanut sauce didn't even have any peanuts in it. Nice atmosphere,  great service,  but horrible Pho! If you enjoy Pho....do not choose Rice Paper."}
{"text":"We LOVE Rice Paper!!! If you want Pho, this is honestly the only place in the valley I trust. The quality is great. You really can't go wrong with anything you order."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was nice and quaint although a little too dim for my liking.  Nice thick real wood tables, lots of floral arrangements and art. Mellow alternative music playing in the background.  For starters we had breaded fried calamari. It tasted like beer batter or hush puppy batter. I found the heavy, battery squid ended up tasting like breaded cod from an English pub. But my wife loved it. It was redeemed by the sriracha aioli dip, which was good. The meat within was cooked expertly, not chewy at all. I just don't know about the cook's choice of batter. Why not use a panko batter?   The selection of spring rolls was impressive and daring. I liked that they were still built in the traditional style but with non traditional ingredients. The smoked salmon and cream cheese was very good, as was the one with crab, avocado, and mango. Generous helpings of green leaf lettuce poured out the ends of the rolls. The rolls were expertly wrapped and the curried dipping sauce was very good.   As far as phó goes, I'm a purist. I like the cuts of beef that most Americans shy away from. I had the phó dac biet. The phó here was okay. I enjoyed the well seasoned scratch made broth, and the basil, sprouts and lime were very fresh, but the meats are a different story. I was disappointed at the lack of tripe and tendon in my soup (only 2 pieces of each), and what little it did have was chewier and not as well seasoned as it could have been. Tendon should melt in your mouth when cooked properly, and it should be cut into little ribbons, not big chunks. Tripe should be very well trimmed so that it does not contain any off flavors. It did have lots of meatballs. My wife, who has never liked Vietnamese meatballs, liked them, as I suspected she would, since I did not think they tasted traditional at all. They tasted store bought, like something you would pick up at Costco.  The thinly sliced brisket tasted not too fresh, like it had been in the refrigerator for half a week. However, it was the nice shade of pink as it should be when blanched.  My wife's soup meat was better than mine. She had phó mignon. The steak quality was very good, if you're into having non traditional phó.  All that said, I have to give huge compliments to the chef for the painstakingly beautiful presentations of every dish I saw. I suspect the chef here has had a lot of formal training in French food and steak. But he may not be a fan of tripe or tendon himself and therefore he may not fully understand how it should taste. As far as value, I feel a little cheated. $13 for a bowl of phó is ridiculous when you can go to other Vietnamese restaurants in town and have phó just as good, if not better, for $7. The spring rolls here are $7, ($5 during happy hour), and were it not for the adventurous flavor combos, I would say they are overpriced as well. Don't waste your money trying the plain spring rolls here.  Be adventurous, it's worth the extra buck or two.  All in all, I would return here for a late night spring roll when I'm downtown, but that's about all worth writing home about."}
{"text":"Nothing to write home about.  The traditional spring rolls were dry and didn't have much taste to them.  The combination sandwich was decent but odd combination to have a side of fries or sweet potato fries with it. The Saigon Bun was okay - the dressing was tasty but too many dry noodles, needed a little more meat in it.  The prices ranged from being decent to overpriced.  The spring rolls were moderately priced, the sandwich was overpriced.  The small cup of orange juice was ridiculously over priced.  The actual restaurant is very modern and clean appearing - no nod to it's Vietnamese origins.  The service was okay.  Not impressed.  There are other more authentic Vietnamese restaurants in the Valley."}
{"text":"really good Pho  and great spring rolls, great happy hour prices, even my mom liked it."}
{"text":"Debated on going 3 or 4 stars for the review. I would say that the firecracker shrimp, garlic noodles, selection of fresh spring rolls, and shaken beef deserve a 4 but pho is maybe a 3 and their crispy spring rolls is probably a 2.   Spring rolls: They have a great selection of some traditional and some really Americanized spring rolls, but nevertheless, their spring rolls are great. My grandmothers and Vietnamese restaurant-owning relatives probably wouldn't recognize half of the spring rolls they sell here, but they're tasty. My favorites? The Spicy Asian (Chinese sausage, imitation crab, sriracha, jalapeno, some sort of crunchy stick) and the Enlighten me (this one's vegetarian).   Pho: Average. This would not be the reason to come here, although I do get it from time to time. It's not the best, it's not the worst I've ever had. The broth is so-so, unremarkable. Also, I don't get cilantro with my veggie plate, which I think is really weird.   Drinks: They have a great selection of fun cocktails.   Starters: Get the firecracker shrimp with the garlic noodles. They go great together!   Service: Hit and miss. Sometimes, things can be really slow, but lately, things have been pretty good."}
{"text":"Rice Paper in my opinion is one of the best Vietnamese restaurants in the Valley. My wife and her family are Vietnamese and they agree. I've tried the pho, egg rolls, and spring rolls and really enjoyed them.  I also like the modern interior, and the staff are friendly.  Well worth a visit."}
{"text":"I just moved back to AZ from LA and I've been dying for some GOOD pho. There are not many places here like there are in LA and when I found this place I was super excited because it was nice, not dingy, and looked clean and well kept. I got chicken pho and it was very fresh and delicious! I can't wait to show my boyfriend  my new find ;) he loves pho too! I will be back soon!"}
{"text":"We've been going to Rice Paper on 7th St for years and have enjoyed it, however, the food, service, and cleanliness has declined rapidly.   We loved their fresh spring rolls, not anymore.  They tasted like they had been prepared the day before and were dry.   Our cocktail order was wrong although the server asked us twice what we wanted.  We sat at a table that was not clean and flies were ever present on the windows.  Rice Paper on 7th St is now off our list of restaurants."}
{"text":"delicious and fresh!! I wish it was closer to my house"}
{"text":"The spring rolls are cheap and tasty. My favorite is the Spider Roll, which has soft shell crab. They have Pho, sandwiches and salads. They also have a bar."}
{"text":"Doesn't even deserve one star. This is the worst Pho In the country. Horrible. Bad food. Bad service. Appetizers came out after entrees and even after complaining they did. Itching about it. Cold Pho. Barely any chicken. Nasty flavor. Dirty restaurant. Store dirty dishes next to the bathrooms. Hot and cold kitchen don't talk.  WHAT???? The restaurant is all of 15 feet wide. On and thank for the tip about getting happy hour orders in.  Guess you missed out entirely cuz we stick to water after that. AVOID THIS PLACE LIKE THE PLAGUE!!!!"}
{"text":"After just returning to the Valley of the Sun from San Francisco, it was great to find a really fantastic, fresh, Vietnamese fusion option! They mean fusion, so don't expect $3 Pho, but be happy to find a smorgasbord of spring roll options, as well as a pho for every eater in your group.   We'll be back soon for their fantastic happy hour deals!"}
{"text":"Yummmooo.  The caramelized salmon served in a clay pot was amazing. The actual spring rolls were a bit on the plain side, but the sweet dip that comes with the rolls is a great compliment. This was my first experience with Vietnamese cuisine, and I was very pleasantly surprised. I've thanked my good friend who referred me!"}
{"text":"I will be coming back!  Rice Paper was featured on a news clip recently and because I enjoy going to new places and it happens to be close to my work I decided to try it. A coworker and I had a short amount of time to grab something to eat before a meeting which was close by so we decided to try Rice Paper.   Note to future patrons, there is very limited parking, but my coworker and I did find a space and were pleased that we could be seated right away. As soon as we walked in we were greeted by friendly staff and all around people were seeming to have a great time. After being seated for a moment and ordering drinks we waited a bit to place our food order (remember we had a tight schedule).   Once our food arrived we were both surprised at how good the fresh spring roll was. We got a tuna spring roll and it was amazing! These rolls are big and split in two ( I will be coming back to order just spring rolls), a great deal for the money. I ordered the tofu Bahn Mi and it was so tasty. I expected the roll to be very crunchy as most bahn mi's do come that way but the bread was toasted and surprisingly soft. The flavor was spot on for my craving that day...I will order again. My co-worker ordered a tuna salad and we both were in awe of how much salad she got. We mentioned many times during our meal that we would be back.   I do have to say because the building is small, they pack a lot of tables and patrons in tiny spaces. The day I went there it was not as busy as I expected so when we waited a good 5-10 minutes after finishing eating to then ask our waiter for our check we were slightly disappointed. However, this little issue will not prevent me from going back, I will just not go when I have a short amount of time to eat.   Rice Paper Eatery was great!"}
{"text":"Rice Paper is a great place near downtown to get great tasting and fairly authentic V food. I ordered the Bun with pork, which is my favorite V dish. It was great and the helping of grilled pork was substantial - I wasn't left hungry and craving meat after my meal. The bartender was great - she was always present and asking if we needed anything. For being such a small restaurant, there was a great selection of beer and spirits (though I didn't partake, because I had to make it back to work). I was in and out in less than an hour, which is great for a lunch spot. My only complaint is that there isn't a lot of parking. I had to park down the street on a side street. But I guess the fact that the place was full and that there wasn't any parking is a good sign..."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a must try if you love delicious Vietnamese food! Don't get me wrong the food is amazing but that is not what makes this restaurant stand out compared to other local spots in Phoenix...it was my charming server named Kapono. Wow! I can honestly say it was truly a gift being served by him while my friend and I enjoyed our meal. The service  was top notch - knowledgeable, quick, and courteous. His outgoing, cheerful, and fun spirit really shined really through as he helped us every step of the way. In addition to his wonderful personality I couldn't help but notice his well groomed mustache! Excellent and unique!   I also really couldn't help but overtip Kapono because I really like to support hard working individuals like this who really are an example to other servers at restaurants around the world. He was what my friend says, 'on that next level!'   I will definitely be bringing friends and family here in the future but only if Kapono is our server! I will probably call in advance to make sure he is working! I wouldn't want to show up and not get to have such an incredible dining experience like last time.  Be sure to check out this restaurant...the spring rolls and Pho are great! You really can't go wrong. And you can't miss Kapono...he's the handsome server with the stash! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Been out of town for the summer but seems like they have added a new addition of staffs. But the service was wonderful still. The food is great as always especially my favorite firecracker shrimp and my garlice noodles. To die for. You can actually make a meal out of this. And was the spicy Asian yummy as always. Thank you for staying in business as this area still needs restaurants like yours. Excellent job as always."}
{"text":"The place is small and super cute.  The staff is nice.  Good vibe.  The food is average, americanized versions of Vietnamese food.  Good for someone new to the cuisine.  Very fun selection of spring rolls."}
{"text":"Start the car and head to 7th St.  Might be the first and only Vietnamese Fresh Roll Bar that I have ever been to. Cool decor, great food, and friendly staff.   Two visits. Both included Pho Ga (Chicken Pho) and a mix of rolls. All very darn tasty..."}
{"text":"I find myself here about once a week.  The Pho is yummy.  The spring rolls are good too.  The service is friendly and prompt.  When I want a more upscale pho experience, I come to this place.  Parking can be a nightmare, and the restaurant is very small.  But my main complaint is the price.  $12 for a bowl of pho? Come on."}
{"text":"Truly this isn't a vietnamese restaurant... Not an asian person on staff. Sure for your urban folks this is how they tolerate eating asian food but to anyone who knows asian cuisine this is not the place to go.. First the service was nice - slow but the workers were friendly enough.. Second, I don't know how they could charge what they do for their appetizers.. $4.75 for 2 eggrolls sliced in half - RIPOFF. The fish sauce wasn't authentic at all. Ordered Phoa and wasn't impressed at all... $8 for a half a bowl of phoa is a ripoff as well. Total for 2 diners $26.60.. Come on folks - normally it's $16 for 2 including appetizer, phoa and drinks.... I wouldn't even mind paying if it were truly authentic and the best Phoa in AZ... Will not be vising again.."}
{"text":"Good food and service is what you'll find here, this place has some of the best fresh rolls I've had.   This place is what I'll call a intimate spot as the seating is really close, this is a old house turned restaurant. Parking is intimate as well, the food comes out hot, fast and good.      Give it a try. I think you'll like it too."}
{"text":"A neighborhood favorite! Then again, I love Pho.   When you come in, I suggest you get a seat with a good view of all the other seats. Watching people eat noodles is incredibly fun! Get a drink, any drink will do. They actually have a \"Surprise Me\" option on their bar menu. I think the bartenders are psychic and showing off, because they bring you what you really want deep down inside.   Unless you're an expert on Vietnamese food, it takes a few tries to figure out what is \"your dish\". The first couple of times I came here, I was always satisfied with my food - but I would see what someone else was ordering and transform into a bulimic goblin/wizard wanting to change my order after the fact. After a strict rehab - I can now happily say, I even know what hot sauce mixture I want in my pho. TAKE THAT GOLEM!!!   Now keep in mind, this is historic Phoenix we're talking about here. Most of these restaurants are old houses that have been renovated to be the wonderful restaurants they are. It can get cramped/cozy/claustrophobic/small/youhavetogetthepointbynow. That's part of the appeal.   I'll end saying this. If you want comparable Pho, go to LA or Vietnam."}
{"text":"Super fresh & tasty Vietnamese food in the desert. Fresh rolls and food so, so good. Not for the faint of heat(spice) hearted."}
{"text":"10/10 would eat again - Words from my daughter! We had firecracker shrimp, chicken breast spring roll, chicken pho and shaken beef! All were delicious.   Cute restaurant! Awfully minimal parking!"}
{"text":"We come here often, probably once or twice a month. I don't know what some of the bad reviews are about! We came in tonight and saw an empty table that hadn't been bussed but preferred the back area as opposed to the front. Initially, the server seemed stressed by that but told us it was ok. He rushed over to buss and wipe the table.   We always start with the spicy edamame yum!!! I ordered the pho with filet mignon and it was as delicious as always. My boyfriend ordered the pho with beef, tripe, tendon etc. I strongly recommend googling what tripe is before ordering... (yuck) my bf enjoyed the pho but ended up taking out the tripe.  Often times we get the same server and I always forget to ask his name but he's sweet and a hard worker! Apparently a busser didn't show up for his shift which explained his stress upon when we sat down. I've worked as a waitress and I understand situations like that. I also think customers should be more understanding and kind. We all do our best after all..  I love rice paper and will be back (of course!)"}
{"text":"Heed the negative reviews.  This restaurant can be summed up in two words: mediocre & overpriced. I wish I had gone with my instinct and given more weight to the negative reviews. The positive reviews of the spring rolls lured me in, however, much to my disappointment. One spring roll is $4.50, although we fortunately went for the happy hour and only paid $3.50, which was still too much, in my opinion. They were stuffed mostly with lettuce and had little to no flavor., and we tried 3 different kinds. The peanut sauce was overly thick and cloyingly sweet and added nothing positive to the rolls.  I had the Lemon Grass Chicken for dinner. The chicken was overcooked and dry and absolutely flavorless and the noodles were overly sweet. I couldn't detect even a hint of the lemon grass. The presentation was unappetizing, with the overcooked chicken just slapped on to the side of the noodles.  I'm not going to speak for my companions as they were there at my invitation and probably didn't want to be negative, but neither of them made any positive comments about their food.   As I said, pay attention to the negative reviews. If you like bland, overpriced food, you may like this place, but otherwise I can't see anyone going back for more."}
{"text":"Excellent service!  Good food, nice atmosphere and how refreshing to see an ethnic restaurant that is not Mexican near the downtown area.  I recommend you give this place a try!"}
{"text":"I love this place!  The spring rolls come in many different varieties and are all delicious.  I recomend the one with pork and mint.  Lisa, the owner, is always a riot behind the bar.  I need to go back and try the Pho, as everyone I know who has tried it rave about it.  The atmosphere is bright and airy, even in such a small space.  This is one place I like to take my out-of-town guests to because I know it will not dissappoint.  Their ginger creme brulee topped with fresh mango is to die for.  Eat a little early for happy hour discounts on their rolls."}
{"text":"I read other reviews and many people said the same thing...why is the place empty?  I hope that more people try this place because the food is good.  I had a very good experience when I went with a relative.  We both had one of the spring rolls and a salad.  The food was fresh and light.  The atmosphere of the restaurant matches the food."}
{"text":"Been multiple times and love all the rolls we've tried and the firecracker shrimp is so addictive. The owners are a hoot and so friendly. Definitely try a vodka-soaked lychee...so good. Parking is very limited in back so you may have to get creative with where you park. I love the restroom sinks made out of woks and the music is soothing and a great compliment to the atmosphere that allows for easy conversation."}
{"text":"Rice paper is within walking distance of our house. They have happy hour and drink specials daily (which is great, as their cocktails are delicious and on the pricey side: $9-$13).  Their rolls, sandwiches, pho, and salads are great. Be prepared to spend at least $20 each if you are getting drinks but it is worth it."}
{"text":"We went there twice. The first time it was short staffed, friendly but bad service. The second time lots of service. We had at least 4 different people waiting on our table. Unfortunately the food is mediocre. Their signature dish \"firecracker shrimp\" tastes like nothing with some hot sauce and the consistency of a wad of cardboard tough shrimp. No shrimp flavor. The calamari was cut into squares it was overcooked, rubbery and fishy smelling. The pho was hardly flavored. On the plus side they had Kirin on tap. The staff hypes the firecracker shrimp but is not good."}
{"text":"What's all the fuss about? Mediocre, dumbed-down versions of Vietnamese. Bland and boring, and WAY overpriced. Way too much attitude, too. As others have noted, the service is crummy. We had to keep signaling for silverware, water, the check - in such a small place, you'd think you could find your server. It took forever for food to arrive and once they banged it down on the table, poof - server disappears.  If you're not a fan of sitting at hightops, be warned that there are very few regular-height tables and they get snapped up first. Also, the place is small, so if you're unlucky enough to be seated by a door, as we were, and it's chilly out, you get a blast of cold air every time someone goes in or out. And leave the door ajar.  Yeah, thanks."}
{"text":"I admit I was a little wary about deviating from my usual pho joint which is extremely authentic yet lacks ambiance. However, I was bewildered by the level of pleasure their pho ga induced. BEWILDERED BY PLEASURE. The broth itself was complex, the herbs and vegetables so fresh and the chicken had an amazing flavor. No slime meat here!   I also ordered the veggie tempura spring rolls but was a bit disappointed to find only one fried mystery vegetable hidden in a sea of lettuce. Please provide more tempura! PLEASE! Fried vegetable lovers unite for the cause for a better tempura ratio in these baby boys. Overall, it's kind of pricey for the portion, maybe not so authentic yet I'll gladly split the difference to lovingly slurp soup and nosh on spring rolls in my neighborhood."}
{"text":"Went and had lunch there on a Wednesday and loved the spring rolls, I had a tofu sandwich and the bread was like eating marble. Oh we'll, everything else was great."}
{"text":"I love Rice Paper. My go-to order includes some crispy pork spring rolls, a small chicken pho, and a glass of wine. Delicious! This is increasingly becoming one of my favorite spots to dine Downtown."}
{"text":"Ambiance: 5 stars (for a Vietnamese restaurant, that is, not a steak house) Food: 1.5 stars  Service: 2.5 stars  So after hearing how great this place was from a friend, I finally tried it out, and was shocked.  The food was not tasty - I think it was the chicken in the Pho that tasted bad.  The rest was just bland.  Never been back."}
{"text":"All day I'd dreamt about a bowl of awesome Pho. When it came time to finally go (7:30p) my boyfriend and I left on our quest to find a rad Viet diggs to get some legit food. He'd never had Vietnamese food and was curious and I was super psyched to get the bowl of pho I'd been dreaming of. We first went to VaDang, nothing- \"we are crosed\" at 8p on the DOT on a Saturday the chefs has already been long gone and they were shooing everyone out.  We called Pho Tahn at 8p, they close at 8:30p but even then they tried to convince us to not come because they were closing...WHAT?!?  We tried to go and squeeze in and order \"to go\" but because the little old guy at the register was telling us to hurry I became upset and decided to leave that damn place. What the hell is up with these lazy Vietnamese food places?!?! We then saw that Rice Paper was open until midnight and went there despite it having less favorable reviews and because it was next obvious choice. Reluctantly we went, the s server was nice but forgot my extra limes for the bland bowl of pho, my boyfriend had the Shaking Beef or whatever it's called and although I didn't want any (not because it didn't look good) I decided to not ask for any since the \"entree\" platter was so tiny!! $9/bowl of underwhelming bowl of Pho does not garner recommendation. At Rice Paper you are paying for the view of the hipster waitstaff, and cute chandelliers, not the food :(. I am unsure if Rice Paper satisfies my itch for Pho and I'm ok with it or if it only fanned the flames for me to continue my quest In search for good pho in my area.  I might have to cave and plan a road trip to Little Saigon in Glendizzy for the pho I so desire."}
{"text":"Went for a late lunch, had never been there before. Moderately price, definitely thought the food was worth it. Had the calamari, shaking beef and garlic noodles! Will definitely come here again!"}
{"text":"I was delighted to find this gem, located near downtown Phoenix. I personally had a good dining experience and an attentive server both times I dined here, and I enjoyed the flavors. Most important, the ambience makes this a good stop for a casual or friendly business lunch in the area. They also had some tasty healthy options. This will definitely become one of my go-tos."}
{"text":"We have been to this place many times and only had one bad experience. The waiter was very impatient when we saw the menu for the first time. He kept coming back almost every 10 or 15 min. if we were ready. That was the only very annoying experience we had. We came a different day and noticed that same waiter was not there. This time we had a more patient, and very friendly and polite waiter. The food was great and we didn't feel like we had to rush to order this time. Spring rolls and the crispy spring rolls are our favorites so far. And the Fire Cracker shrimp and garlic noodles was delicious! The bartender specials were great tasting. I rarely order those. But since it was my birthday it was a fun night out."}
{"text":"I really like their pho! It's not that it's super authentic, if you're looking for that go elsewhere. It just tastes really good, especially when you're sick."}
{"text":"Great spring rolls, they are big. Three of us shared a couple spring rolls and an entree and we were good to go. The drinks were good as well."}
{"text":"I had a chicken sandwich and it was good but very different with lots of veggies. The sweet potato fries were top notch. The edamame was very different and spicy we loved it. They did not provide engh ice with our iced tea!"}
{"text":"I went here for lunch a few weeks back and think it's worth writing about. This place is more of a spring roll bar rather than a full Vietnamese restaurant which is great since the spring rolls are really good. The place is really tiny but my coworker and I managed to snag a table quickly despite the lunch hour. The challenge worth noting is the tiny parking lot which may cause some patrons a bit of a headache. Overall, a cute spot that I will probably go back to if that's where the coworkers want to lunch or if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Went to Rice Paper for dinner on a Saturday night.  The place was slammed so we sat at the bar.  It's a great atmosphere with a good selection of drinks.  Our spring rolls were quite tasty and fresh (we had the traditional and the spider) Unfortunately our dinners left something to be desired.  My lemongrass chicken dish lacked at semblance of lemongrass.  There was simply none in there!  It still was decent. The pho was lacking depth and without much flavor.  Really liked the atmosphere and they seem to be capitalizing on folks without much experience eating Vietnamese.  Nice place but I hope the food improves..."}
{"text":"I recently went to Rice Paper with a friend. I'd never been there before, but thought about going in quite a few times. We were greeted warmly by the staff and sat at the bar where we ordered wine and a few appetizer's...garlic noodles and spicy asian rolls. The noodles would have made my italian grandmother stand up and take notice. Good sized bowl of noodles mixed thoroughly with a sweet/hot garlic sauce. It's a good thing I'm single! The spicy asian rolls were full of asian sausage, imitation crab meat, siracha and jalapeno peppers wrapped in heaven! My only complaint was that there were only two!! Now that I know what kind of fare Rice Paper has to offer, I'll be back to try their Pho...I'm sure I won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I went to Rice Paper once. It was different. i liked the smallness of this place, and for that they totally owns their cuisine. With that said, it is a bit different for the neophyte to the characteristics of the Vietnamese kitchen. It has different smalls, suttle tastes and sometimes present consistencies that the Western eater aren't ready for.   But this shouldn't discourage the adventurer. The food is good, and it isn't that hard to stay on a meat free path. The service have room to improve, but I shouldn't venture there.. I seem to be a privately owned business, so I should let them run this place as they see fit. But even so, I wasn't blown away - however, I will return and give this place a second chance.   .. und das ist nach der kritiker"}
{"text":"Great food always fresh....3rd time there and always a great meal......The noodles were awesome !!!"}
{"text":"I've never been a huge Vietnamese fan, but Rice Paper has shown me the light! This little joint is run by two sassy sisters who are a hoot to be around and make delicious food.   The spring rolls here are amazing - I think its the best thing on their menu - and they are so cheap that you can order several of them, tapas style!  They are always made with fresh ingredients and are packed with flavor.  I also love the vegetarian pho.  It may seem expensive but it is HUGE and comes with a number of ingredients - tofu, lime, mint, jalapenos, sprouts, onions.  Whenever I am in a soup mood I turn to that pho."}
{"text":"vegetarian pho made with beef broth. that's not vegetarian. try again."}
{"text":"We stopped by Rice Paper a few months ago for a quick bite to eat before seeing a movie at the Phoenix Film Bar. Looking for something exotic, inexpensive, fast and within a 10 minute drive to our final destination, we brought up Yelp! on my phone and searched for nearby restaurants.   I love Vietnamese food. So much so, that when I lived in California and I would go back east to visit my family, I would drive an hour in rush hour traffic in Arlington, VA to go to my absolute favorite Vietnamese place called Cafe Dalat. Anyone familiar with traffic in the DC area knows this restaurant must have been amazing to suffer a voluntary 2 hour commute and it was. Alas, Cafe Dalat has since closed and that is a different story for a different day.  Pulled over on the side of the road and huddled over the phone, we saw that there was a new, modern Vietnamese place within a few minutes drive and that had great reviews and our minds were made up.   The restaurant is a small but well designed coverted store front house on 7th Street in downtown Phoenix.  Although they specialize in spring rolls and fresh rice paper rolls, they also offer a selection of pho (soup), goi (salad), bahn-mi (sandwiches) as well as a few mini entrees. If you get 2-3 rolls per person and share a soup or mini entree, you'll be full by the time you leave. The service is pleasant, knowlegable and efficient. The bathrooms are unisex. The seating is cozy and intimate- think party of 2 or 4 rather than 6-8 although if you get there early enough, there is a bar style table in the middle of the restaurant that can seat around 6 people.   As for the rolls, my favorite were the crispy \"Budda\" and the fresh veggie tempura soft rice paper roll. If you are looking for a meat filled roll, try a traditional pork or grilled chicken with basil roll served with hoisin sauce.   The last time we went, I think we ordered crispy calimari and lemon grass chicken with garlic noodles; both great. We were sitting next to a woman and her daughter who were both eating Pho and the fragrance of it was so amazing that I had to ask them how it was. The mother said that it was some of the best Pho in town and if it wasn't 115 in August, we probably would have ventured to try some.   At around $15-20 per person including a cocktail (they have great HH prices too), this was definitely a modern take on some Vietnamese classics."}
{"text":"I just started eating pho and have gone to over 8 in phoenix so far and it keeps getting better until this place.  The vegetarian pho is phenomenal..mushrooms, asparagus, baby corn oh its a sweet symphony of sweet, savory, tart, spicy and earthy!!! The broth is a perfect balance of delicate vegetables and herbs.  Spiced just right! The tofu was done to perfection, not too soft or chewy.  To finish the meal, my friend and I shared the creme brulee.  It was just crispy burnt enough to balance the creamy delightness.  It was topped with fresh mango and mint. The absolute best way to end the meal.  The service and atmosphere was exceptional, attentive and friendly.  Very hip and modern but inviting and down home."}
{"text":"i love coming to this place,good firecrackers appetizer to die for!i also suggest to try the salmon caramelized ahhhhh thats my favorite!this is my good spot for dinner."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I love this place!  Their pho is amazing, atmosphere is great, and their fresh spring roll selection is the best I've ever seen.  I recommend this place to anyone looking for good Vietnamese...but I always recommend with an asterisk...service is only okay and it's pretty slow.  It took nearly 30 minutes for me to get my pho at lunchtime.  The girl apologized saying it was a computer error but never offered anything complimentary.  If she had known how much we frequent the place and recommend it, maybe she would have done something differently???  When I told my husband about it that night, he said the same thing has happened to him twice there.  So, it is a yummy Vietnamese place but don't expect \"knock your socks off\" service and make sure you have some time..."}
{"text":"Wanted to try a new place closer to home for pho and I prefer this quaint little place over anywhere else I've been in the past. I have to say Rice Paper scores big points on location, cleanliness and decor. Friendly staff and good quality food are big things when I give a review.  When I try a place for the first time I don't get too adventurous so I stuck with traditional summer rolls and pho with beef. The summer rolls are your basic with shrimp, vermicelli noodles, etc and served with peanut sauce. Very crisp,rolled a bit loose but great.  Pho had great broth and tasted very clean compared to previous restaurants I've tried. The toppings that arrived with my soup were very fresh and the Thai basil was the most fragrant I've ever smelled.  I loved the water,spa water like with cucumber and the staff did many circles to refill our glasses.  Our server Dom was very attentive and accommodating to my picky gf without being too pushy or annoying. He had a friendly demeanor and was easy going. 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Only open for 5 days, but most of the bugs already worked out and already busy! Beautiful modern decor in a vintage home turned retaurant. Friendly ownership and wait staff made the meal a very pleasant experience. Moderately priced with substantial portions. The shaking beef entree was the best item on the menu, though the tofu curry in the hot pot had outstanding flavor. The zucchini was marinated in terriyaki barbeque sauce and grilled to perfection. The spring roll menu is inventive, and a novel way to use sushi chefs. The ahi tuna with mango and avocado was fresh and tasty, and I particularly liked the spicy asian roll. They have not yet rolled out their entire menu, but I look forward to returning for the ginger creme brulee and banana spring rolls when available next week!!  Overall, a great beginning for a new neighborhood restaurant that is worthy of support from the local community. The energetic and friendly staff and ownership seem eager to assure that everyone is satisfied. Our glasses rarely were empty. We will return frequently. Good luck!"}
{"text":"I am in the middle of my Vietnamese kick as of late and this place makes a great attempt at good food!  The location is rather small and parking is a bit of a challenge but you can maneuver through this and try this place out.  The food we ordered was very good, the quality of the product is definitely worthy of the price which is a bit higher than your average spot.  Clearly one of the areas that they strived on was their service, our server was very attentive and constantly would check in with us making us very comfortable.  Try the crispy spring rolls, they are winners but the big one that left me looking for more was my PHO.  The PHO was very bland in taste and the meat and veggies were very scarce.  I almost felt like I had the last scoop from the pot because there was little for us to enjoy.    To me PHO is the staple to the Vietnamese shop just like Pizza is to the italian restaurant.  If you have good antipasti but have a lack luster attempt at pizza you would not give them the praise even if their service was great.  After my experience and visits to Rice Paper, I felt they missed the spot."}
{"text":"Small space with huge flavor. I definitely recommend coming here. The tuna spring roll was amazing and so are the sandwiches. Must try. Only giving 4 stars due to space, but what the heck, love thy neighbor."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying this place is very hyped. I understand why though, there isn't many Pho places in Phoenix... let alone good. This is pretty much as close as it gets, BUT for me this is okay Pho. I been to Seattle and now live here so I am kinda spoiled. Pho is amazing here.   Rice Paper isn't bad, but it's not really the best. I ate here because I LOVE Pho and it's honestly hard to find a good place without driving super far.   The problem with Rice Paper for me is how small it is, I LOVED the vibe... it's it's super small and parking is a PAIN. Especially during lunch hour. It also gets packed at random times so you just never know.   It also takes a while for them to bring you your food. Even when there are barely any people in the place. Last time I was there, my waiter was so stoned. He smelled of weed bad. It didn't bother me... BUT that is highly unprofessional and shouldn't be tolerated as an employee. He was also very forgetful ironically...   Another problem I had was when you sit by the door in the front there is a FLY problem BIG time! I HATE flies, especially around when I am trying to eat. They have a huge problem with flies, and I'm not really sure how they can fix it but they should do so and fast!"}
{"text":"I have to say, we were so underwhelmed by the food here. The lemongrass chicken with garlic noodles fell short.  Where was the lemongrass flavor?  It was full of brown salty sauce.    As to the service, it was eh.... It was mediocre.    Maybe I should have tried the Pho."}
{"text":"I was really excited to try Rice Paper. I had lunch there yesterday and was very disappointed. I started with a chicken spring roll, and the chicken was so over-cooked (fried) that it was leathery and even crunchy. Not a good texture with a spring roll, which fell apart as I tried to pry off bites. My bowl of chicken pho took 30 minutes to come and the restaurant was less than half full. Pho was okay, but on the salty side. Ambience was not enough. Found myself craving Maxim's."}
{"text":"This place deserves negative stars if possible! My buddies and I rolled in and was told they are closed despite the actual operating business hours, false advertising! The excuse given by their employee was the place was slow that night, I didn't know good customer service and profitability was a negative thing! Finally, I saw a \"guy\" pissing on the wall in the parking lot...I was shocked and scared, so we left and vowed never to return!"}
{"text":"Yum. I just finished a nice bowl of Veggie Pho with Shiitake mushrooms, Asparagus, Bean Sprouts, Jalapenos and Basil. The broth was very Goldilocks-jussst right. Before the soup came I had a very tasty spring roll called the \"Enlighten Me\" with jalapeno, jicama, asparagus, rice noodles and sriracha. Though these were very similar ingredients to the Pho, this Spring Roll had it's own unique flavor experience. Everything had great heat.  The restaurant itself is a converted old house on 7th Street and a little small. My girlfriend and I went at 2:00 pm and the place was pretty full, so I can't imagine what a weekend dinner there might be like. The service was friendly and took good care of us.  Is this the greatest Vietnamese restaurant, ever? No, but it was friendly, fresh and delicious enough to put it in my restaurant rotation. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I stopped in here the other day after flying into Sky Harbor because it was so close to the Airport. The restaurant is really small and cute. It must have someone's house in a prior life. It was happy hour for drinks (11am-6pm) but their food specials didn't start until 3. Their unique variations on the classic fresh spring roll definitely intrigued me. We had the one with tuna, avocado and mango with a miso dipping sauce in addition to the traditional spring roll. They were both awesome but you only get one roll for the price (I'm used to getting two with an order for close to the same price). We also split the beef pho and ahi salad. Both were fresh and tasty. I wouldn't say the pho was more exceptional than any I've had before but it was good and the beef seemed to be a bit higher quality than I've had in other places. The ahi salad dressing was the same dipping sauce we had with the spring roll so I was a bit tired of it towards the end and let my fiance finish it off. My only two complaints were that the sinks for the restrooms were out in the common area... a little weird and that we had empty water glasses fairly frequently. Otherwise... if I lived in the area I would definitely be back to try some more spring rolls!"}
{"text":"This would not be my first choice for Vietnamese but I wanted to try it out. First time was mediocre and over priced but I liked the idea of lots of fresh spring roll options. Second and third time they were out of spring rolls, salads, and sandwiches. That's over half their menu. Definitely won't be a fourth time!"}
{"text":"Didn't really know what to expect at a Modern Vietnamese restaurant. The word \"Modern\" really just means we're going to jack the prices up a little, fancy up the decor and have non immigrants serve you....because really the food is exactly the same as non modern Vietnamese restaurants.   Food:  Pho - No complaints. No specific praises. It was 105 degrees out and my Asian genes told me to get me some pho. It hit the spot.  Spring rolls - The skin was fairly hard. Did not taste as fresh as I am use to. 1 order only comes with 1 roll cut into 2.   Service:  Decent service. Lunch appear to be semi busy but the staff is attentive enough to work through it.   Environment:  Seriously this place is in a pretty crappy looking area. Parking lot is small but they have extra parking 2 houses down. Once you walk in, it is a completely different vibe. Looks much nicer inside than surrounding area.  Price:  Pricey for the type of food, though you can easily make any type of food pricey by repackaging it. I just see it as a premium I am paying because I have limited options.   Food: 3 Service: 4 Environment: 3 Price: 2"}
{"text":"We have been here a number of times and the service on each consecutive visit was in a serious downward spiral.  The last time we were there, (and it truly will be the last time) the restaurant was not busy but the wait staff were all too busy conversing among themselves in the kitchen.  We had 4 people and one of the entrees never made it us.  It took 20 minutes to get our drinks because the bartender was busy on the phone with the owner. (or so we were told)  What happened to the customer comes first?    And BTW, the parking is a disaster.  Not enough spaces and cars get log jammed in the lot.    Unfortunate for this place and we gave it many tries, but the last visit was the end for us."}
{"text":"I REALLY wanted to love this place but lo and behold, I find myself wishing I had decided on another destination for dinner. When my boyfriend and I arrived, we were quickly welcomed and seated in what was a perfectly quaint little corner of the restaurant. Unfortunately, that was about the only thing that was done in a timely manner during our visit.   We took a few minutes to decide what we wanted, ordered, and then hung out for about 15 to 20 minutes. During that time, two other parties were seated, orders were taken and their starters were brought out before ours! Did I mention that our waiter had to come back and ask us what we ordered because he forgot? We finally got our spring rolls but then had to wait another 20minutes for our dinner to arrive. I'm all about waiting for a meal that is cooked to order, but what really put the nail in the coffin was the fact that our food came out lukewarm (if that).  The food itself wasn't terrible, but its not something that I'll ever go out of my way to get. We got the tuna and salmon spring rolls and they were great. The cuts of fish could have been bigger but overall, they were the shinning star of a poorly cast ensemble. My boyfriend ordered the tofu and shiitake mushroom sandwich and said it was \"good enough\". Now, he isn't nearly as picky of an eater as I am, so \"good enough\" is as good as...well, bad. I ordered the chicken pho. The broth tasted like soapy water and the chicken looked like it was wadded up and boiled. Parts of the chicken didn't even seem fully cooked.  I wish we had a better experience at Rice Paper, but sadly I don't think we'll be back."}
{"text":"Salty to the point you can't taste anything else. Dead on a Saturday @ 6:30-we should have known. The waitress showed her face 2 times total & had someone else do all the rest of her work. Appetizers came out well after our actual food. Bad service- horrible food."}
{"text":"When this place opened the food was great but the service was pretty sad. I've been back for dinner many times in the last few weeks and the service has been exceptional! They also have the best calamari I have EVER eaten!"}
{"text":"Great food. Good service. Good for small groups. I enjoyed the lemongrass chicken with ginger tea."}
{"text":"Probably my fav spot in Coronado. I get pho every time - relatively cheap and so good! The fish sauce wings smell terrible, as fish sauce does, but taste wonderful. I also like the space and find it very comfortable in the main room."}
{"text":"I love this place!  The atmosphere, staff, food absolutely FANTASTIC.  I introduced a friend to Pho today for the first time and the Pho here was excellent as always!!!  I will continue to frequent Rice Paper anytime I am in the area!"}
{"text":"Loved the food and loved the vibe. Super cute and the staff was amazing! Totally exceeded by expectations and went above and beyond to give amazing service. Will go back soon!"}
{"text":"Where are the owners? When was the last time you have been in your restaurant? You are failing big time and here's why...  This is the 5th time I have reluctantly been to your establishment due to my love of pho however it will be my last. First off when you arrive to the parking lot there is trash and broken down heaters piled up for all to see. This is your first impression to rice paper...trash. You walk in and there is a leaking ac unit in the entrance where water is standing which speaks to another issue I will mention shortly. You walk in and your not greeted you are ignored by an obviously  untrained wait staff who appear to have better shit to deal with then customers who pay their salaries. We sat at the bar while the bartender talked endlessly to her friends and texted. Looking around the dining room you see junk everywhere. You have things on shelves that have no purpose nor appear to have been used or cleaned in years. The place is just dirty. You have wait staff bussing to the bar right were we are sitting. Putting dirty dishes next to where I'm eating is gross and unprofessional. Also get rid of the televisions if your not going to have something worth looking at on. It would be cute if you had romantic movies playing or something of that regard. Infomercials or sports is not the way to go if you considering your self fine dining. Further if you are going to be this run down and not care then lower your prices so that we are paying for what we're getting. I have experienced bugs at your location twice. A small roach walked out on the counter once while I was eating. Absolutely disgusting. This place needs an overhaul.   If your the owner I challenge you to eat at your restaurant and consider this feedback. Clean it up and start caring about the customer experience. There is no sense of urgency to the customer experiance. I asked for my pho to be hot, super hot as it is always Luke warm. Sure enough it came out Luke warm which makes me think that you guys just have soup stock sitting to which you add ingredients into.   Take the message not the tone. Clean it up. Train your staff."}
{"text":"Let me start this review by  saying I've never been a fan of spring rolls.  You know, those fired, stale tasting, bland things you get as a side with your chines takeout.  Rice Paper DOES IT DIFFERENT AND DOES IT WELL! Its like sushi meets a burrito is the best way I can describe it, I could have ordered one of everything off the fresh spring roll menu.  Stopped in here on a whim and tried some fried tofu and a glass of beer. Okay, things went well, taste was good so on to the spring rolls. The rolls had great texture and were full of fresh ingredients with tasty dipping sauce.  Great place to eat (additional parking to the north) and the bill for two was under $20.  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I herd about this place form a friend and he told me to check it out. I was a bit skeptical about it because of the location but as soon as I got there I was excited! The restaurant is well layed out and the waiting service is great. I have never eaten Viennese food before so I didn't know what to expect. The food me and my boyfriend ordered was fabulous and at a really decent price. I will definitely recommend this place to someone else."}
{"text":"Great service from greeting to leaving?  check! Super killer yummy food?  check! Am I bummed this restaurant is not in Portland where I live?  check!  veggie pho was killer, firecracker shrimp appetizer was OMG good, ginger creme brulee was killer.  our server was great, the greeter dude was awesome.  Loved loved loved loved this place.  I am self proclaimed foodie, I love Vietnamese food, and this place was killer. next time I am in Phoenix I will be back!!!"}
{"text":"Go to here.  Seriously, I haven't had a bad bite at this place.  I was with a large (8-10 people) group, and everyone ordered something a little different and there was forks flying all over as people were trying everyone elses food.  And it was all amazing.  Beware the Leche Balls.  Just beware."}
{"text":"good pho but could be a little meatier and have more veggies. wraps are really good. service is ok."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to get pho in the downtown Phx area.  The atmosphere is very modern and they always have great music.  I feel the servers put forth quite the effort to make it a good experience for the customers.  My favorite time to go is during happy hour, which is on for the majority of the day.  Ends at 6:30pm, but all draft beers are $2.75 for a pint.  They recently have decided to try and promote local breweries and all of the tap beers are local and yummy.  There are quite a few places to get pho in Phx, but this one is the best if you're wanting to pair with a beer and chill atmosphere."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is really nice and it's a cute little restaurant. The staff is always friendly and helpful. I love their crispy pork eggrolls!"}
{"text":"Ok. So, the food, specifically pho is amazing.  The food, decor, and service are not the food.    Now the story begins.  We arrived to Rice Paper, and were promptly greeted and sat by a server.  Immediately, I was attacked!  I was attacked by this horrible smell that completely assaulted my senses.  A smell that no one else seemed to mind or be bothered by, except me.  WTH.  I know it is not me.  So I sit down and enjoy my beef pot, which is AMAZING.  The best damn beef pot I have had since leaving Seattle.    I had a greatly meal and so did my wife; however, my nose was not as lucky as my taste buds.  Last, compliment, it was HOT...HOT AS HELL.  Hot like the A/c was broken in my house a few weeks ago.  So I eat my hot good soup in a HOT and smelly restaurant.    Meh.  SMH.  Ya.  SMH.  The food was good but yeah.  I prolly will not go back because of the smell, unless I sit outside."}
{"text":"Food decent. Spring rolls great. Pho, have had better. Service was not great.  Everyone was on their phones when we arrived.  Overcharged for one entree. Probably will not come back."}
{"text":"We have loved everything we've ordered there.  I order the Veggie Pho almost weekly.  I would say it is a little overpriced but to my disappointment, I haven't found another real vegetarian Pho in the area.  Odd thing is that they don't always answer the phone.  Food is great and I really like the decor.  Very small and additional parking is about 2 \"houses\" north."}
{"text":"First time here with my family. Was greeted right away. Very small and cute place. Lovely house turned into restaurant."}
{"text":"I never tried pho before, and a friend wanted to help me expand my horizons.  Got to Rice Paper on a weekday evening, and grabbed a table on the indoor patio area. The place was cute, but it took over five minutes of staring at the bartender (who was chatting with other employees) to ask what the seating situation was. Do I sit anywhere? Hostess seating? Who knows- there's no signage so I guess choose your own adventure.  Found my table and was greeted by a nice server named Dominic. My friend ordered pho, and some other things for the table. The food was good, the prices were fair, and the service was very good. I would come back to this place for sure."}
{"text":"Oh Rice paper. This a great place and the people make it great. The prices are great and the happy hour is one the best. It is close by, so I visit a lot. Yet, if I move or relocate it will be sorely missed and visited monthly.  RL"}
{"text":"The food is avg but the environment and service are great.  No matter what happens DO NOT eat any white lump on a  toothpick looking stick. I meet friends there for drinks and every time - at some point - they roll around offering this and damn of it doesn't taste like something a dragon vomited up.   It's soaked in some kind of nasty hard harsh liquor and no matter what they tell ya - it sucks. There are many more tasty alcoholic offerings.  The pho is avg, but hits the spot. Located in a renovated 1930's bungalow, the place is intimate and great fun for meeting a group.  Last tip:    Parking lot is small so carpool of you can."}
{"text":"I love Pho and trust me when I say I have tried many Pho restaurants here in the valley. In addition, I have also tried Pho soups in my own country, Vietnam. While the Pho is edible and passes for a meal, it is not authenticated. This place is very Americanized and the prices is a bit high. But, by all means, go ahead and try it for yourself."}
{"text":"My boyfriend I tried out this place last night because our usual Pho place was closed... First of all, it took 10 minutes to be greeted by our waiter and to get drinks. My boyfriend asked for a Dr. Pepper and the waiter told him that it was unavailable. Ok- so we both had a green tea. We ordered the crispy spring rolls with pork and were told that they were out of pork. Ok- so we ordered the chicken... Our appetizer came out but it wasn't what we ordered... We were served the fresh spring rolls. Which were ok tasting but not what we ordered. We each had Pho... Probably the most boring least flavorful Pho I've ever had. Once I added the chili and Hoisin sauce it was decent but nothing more than average. Let's talk about the smell in the restaurant now... Someone used the restroom at one point in time and decided to leave the door open. We were seated right next to the restroom so let's just say that the smell was pretty awful while we tried to eat our food. I asked for a to go container for the remainder of my Pho and it was put into a plastic container where the lid wasn't shut and it leaked all over... We weren't offered a bag for transportation of course so that was a disaster. On a positive note, we liked the atmosphere... It was very hipster. But unfortunately that doesn't outweigh all the negatives so...  All and all we won't be back."}
{"text":"The great thing about this place is the food, which is why we keep going back.  The Pho is really quite good especially with the grandma sauce, the rolls are very fresh as well. The not so great thing here is the parking and the service is severely lacking.  This place is small, so even when it is busy, it shouldnt be un-manageable. Yet, we wait to get our order taken, the servers forget you are there, forget you ordered a drink, need more water or even a spoon! Will we go back, yes but we already expect poor service."}
{"text":"So far the BEST vietnamese I've found in the States.  Thats saying a lot- even though I still need to hit up some more places in LA.  I was questionable of this place at first because the atmosphere is a little trendy and hip and our waiter was white.  When I find a really good vietnamese its usually in a sketchy place with waiters who barely speak english.  We got the spider spring rolls as suggested by the server which were AWESOME.  Then we both got pho- one chicken one beef.  The pho was some of the best I've ever had.  The broth had amazing flavor.  They had a special spicy \"grandmas\" sauce (which resembled the red pepper flake oil stuff you usually get a vietnamese places) but this spicy stuff was extra special and sooooo good.  I love spicy.  Its a little pricier than the typical vietnamese spot, but worth it.  Everything still tasted authentic regardless of the atmosphere.  Cant wait to go again!"}
{"text":"Been to this place twice... it is in the category of BOMB. Great spring rolls, good sandwiches, good pho. I recommend if you like Vietnamese food + good vibes.  You will like this. That is all. :)"}
{"text":"Walked in dirty tables everywhere.  Pork was unforgivably dry and sauce was not tasty.  Pho was just okay.  The worst though-my partner got sick the next day."}
{"text":"This place is just amazing! I first found myself here on a late night seriously craving Pho & a buzz, & my oh my, they do it right! I have since become a regular...   The staff is entertaining & fun, the drinks are awesome, the food is fun & delicious! Great place for a date, to hang out, to have get to-gethers, to come alone & end up w/ good conversation & new friends & a satisfied tummy.   Wide variety of spring rolls & appetizers. The main thing, PHO, is to swoon over. I've had the beef, the chicken & the vegan, all 3 are satisfying. Ask for the Grandma Sauce, but be warned, be sparing in adding this to your Pho.  The Firecracker Shimp is a personal favorite as well.   Safe place for Vegans & meat-heads alike!   I've seen some reviews where others say they feel RP is too expensive & you can get good Pho much cheaper at the other Vietnamese places... true, however, this is \"Modern Vietnamese\" ... Great food, Great place to hang out for a few hours, Great environment!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has excellent food, a fantastic happy hour and an interesting clientele. I went there for lunch - I will be back. There isn't a lot of seating once the lunch hour hits so get there before noon. They have additional parking 2 blocks north - worth the walk."}
{"text":"Terrible Service!!! Consistently has horrible service!  They seat you at dirty tables, ignore you for 10 min while you sit at a table with dirty plates.  IF you manage to place an order, the server forgets to place it for you, must of been too busy bussing and resetting tables...   After all this the server still has the most to charge us for extra veggies and fries... First class service!  Ohh and the restaurant smells like they haven't cleaned their grease traps in a decade.   Save yourself the grief the food does not justify the terrible service and employees."}
{"text":"I seriously wanted to write a 5 star review after the garlic butter wings appetizer came out. Good flavor, crispy texture, juicy meat and plenty of sauce if you like them with more. Ordered pho, bbq banh mi, and ahi tuna green salad.  The pho came out room temperature. I'm not bagging on them but this is the second time in two months this happened, so I'm confused why the broth isn't the temperature of the sun. It slightly concerns me that it's not hot enough to cook the raw meat as it was intended.  Sent it back, they warmed it and everything was fine. You would think the token flagship dish of vietnamese food in a vietnamese restaurant would be bulletproof. Next the banh mi. Ugh. Insert sigh here. Again second attempt....I'm trying to be fair and give two attempt before writing it down for the world to see. First thought....WTF.  The supposed pickled vegetables came out limp and soaked in rice wine (both times). I'm pretty sure it's rice wine vinegar that was supposed to be used with sugar and other spices. # disappointed. It killed the sandwich. The overwhelming taste of alcohol from the cooking wine ruined it. Peeled veggies off for the second time and dipped it in the wing sauce to mask the tadte on the bread.  And finally, the salad was great. Nice presentation, good portion, and the citrus miso dressing was a nice touch. The ahi was fresh and we all know you can easily tell if it's not.  I've been told Saigon Kitchen in Surprise is a sister restaurant....go there....it's worth the drive. Never ever been disappointed there."}
{"text":"Third and final time at this establishment.  I sat at the empty bar and waited almost five minutes till the young bartender came to serve me. After pointing out that my glass was chipped the gentleman behind the bar decided to switch glasses instead of pouring a fresh beverage.  His excuse for the problematic glass was, \"this happens alot.\"  Wow... Pho was as warm as an indoor pool and owner just as warm. She sat next to me and offered terrible and ruble banter as I attempted to enjoy my night. At the end I thought the bartender redeemed himself by comping my drink, but instead he forgot to ad it to my tab. Don't worry folks he corrected his mistake when he charged my bill."}
{"text":"I've been coming to rice paper for about a year now. They have -- Great staff ! Great food ! The best happy hour with $2.75 drafts everyday. I will most definitely be a long time costumer"}
{"text":"I had heard good things about this place but was really disappointed. We had 5 servers, and still somehow they managed to forget bring us two different things we ordered, despite asking multiple times. Just never even came. The pho was totally mediocre, which suck. I wouldn't  recommend this place at all."}
{"text":"Stopped by today and picked up some beef pho to-go for lunch.  It was quite a large bowl of soup, tasty and filling.  I would have liked to have seen a little more beef and a little more herbs, but I will definitely order it again.   I chatted with the wait staff while ordering.  They encouraged me to call ahead for a to-go order, and their number is 602-252-3326 (it's not yet posted and their web site isn't up yet either).  In any case, I didn't have a long wait.  While waiting, I checked out the place and it really is cool looking.  The staff was very nice and I can't wait to go back to try many of the other things on the menu."}
{"text":"I have eaten at Rice Paper a few times and love the fresh spring rolls.  They are light and healthy and perfect for lunch.  There are so many choices and I love all of the sauces served with the rolls.  Rice Paper also has a nice selection of Pho as well as a nice menu of modern Vietnamese food items.  Since the place is so small, it can be difficult to find parking or a table during the lunch hour on a busy day.  I would agree with some of the other posters that service needs work.  There is no sense of urgency among the staff."}
{"text":"First time here, I've been to my fair share of pho restaurants. I ordered the pho ga (chicken pho) I'm more of a brisket pho person, esp since I can't have raw meat being pregnant, there was no brisket on the menu. There was a cubed mignon beef selection but didn't appeal to me. The broth was very delicious, not the best I've had but close. The veggies were fresh and clean, staff was so nice and attentive. I would def come back and recommend this place."}
{"text":"Went to Rice Paper on a whim, really enjoyed the food, service was great; even though my pho was accidentally take to another table...will have to go back to try the spring rolls!!!"}
{"text":"While we were there the owner came in and chatted with us. She is an awesone personality and has the cutest dog ever. The food here is out of this world. Unbelievably awesome pho. Great rolls. Ginger creme brulee. Great drinks. Mojitos. Saki bombs. Go. Be happy. This place is great."}
{"text":"good food, good service but overly social roaches ruined our dining experience.  My wife had to leave after seeing one and I also lost my appetite after seeing a 2nd and 3rd climbing up the walls and across the floor.  Exterminator recommended."}
{"text":"Great little place to grab some delicious Asian food. The spring rolls are excellent in this warm Arizona weather! Light, crispy and refreshing. When the weather warms up I love coming in for their Pho. The staff is always welcoming and friendly and I never fail to meet some nice people as the customers are always very friendly and welcoming!"}
{"text":"Always on the hunt for new places to eat with my veg-head wife. Tried it out on my own 1st and LOVED it! Had the Pho and a spring roll. Both very tasty and the combo filled me up, and I'm a big eater. Brought the wife there and she most definitely agreed.  The negatives which werent TOO horrible: Parking absolutely SUCKS, Definitely at least a $$$ place (sorry, the only benefit to eating veg is that it is usually cheaper. Not the case here! LOL!) and the staff can be a bit...... how shall I say........ snarky???? Then again, hipsters just annoy me in general, lol. But like I said, none of the negatives would keep me away."}
{"text":"I've been here often enough to feel almost like a regular, and I can say with confidence that Rice Paper rocks!  It's an urban, hip take on Vietnamese food that includes a few fusion-esque menu options to keep things interesting.  But most importantly, the quality of the food is great.  The Firecracker Shrimp are obscenely good and the rolls are excellent as well.  There's always a few good craft beers on rotation, and happy hour runs late even on the weekends.  Service is top notch and very attentive."}
{"text":"Went for the 1st time with my wife who always wanted to go. The filet Mignon salad was killer the firecracker shrimp awesome but spicy overall great service the waiter was very cool and nice. We will be back."}
{"text":"This is one of my favs in the Valley. All the food is stellar- you can't go wrong on their menu. Period. The drinks they serve are unique as well. This is a very popular place, so be prepared for this. I've had their spring rolls, amazing! I want to go back and try the shaking beef.  Negative: Parking is a nightmare."}
{"text":"I loved the food at this place. Their vegetarian Pho is great as are the spring rolls. They have a decent selection of local beers as well. Will have to come again sometime."}
{"text":"I went to Rice Paper for the first time this weekend- on the recommendation of a trusted \"foodie\" friend, but I was really disappointed. I find Vietnamese cuisine is generally accommodating to vegetarian diets, but this was not the case.   From the start the service was really bad (had to ask for water, then silverware, then the check, you get it). When we finally got service, the food was very boring (bland fresh rolls, overly spicy curry) and just not that tasty....  We sat outside and, although the night was fine and the atmosphere was pleasant, the bench seating was dirty which distracted me from the decent ambiance. It wasn't a horrible experience but definitely not worth revisiting.   Have fun if you go, though!"}
{"text":"It was a gloomy MLK day and I was craving Pho but also had my dog in tow. Rice Paper saved the day, having both Pho and a lovely patio! The restaurant feels as if it is in a (small) old house. Super quaint and cute. Their patio is just as cute with adorable chair coverings and quite a bit of seating. I ordered the Surf 'n' Turf Spring Rolls (shrimp & grilled pork --- TO DIE FOR). I could eat them all day, every day! They were so fresh and delicious! Next, the Pho Ga (Chicken), of course! I added veggies to it as well, however, I was surprised to see that their veggies were a little different than what is usually served in Pho. They served it with asparagus, baby corn, and mushrooms. I wished there would have been broccoli and bok choy, but oh well! I also removed the mushrooms because they were a bit slimy for my liking. The prices were a little higher than other Pho places that i've been to but all in all, my craving was fulfilled and I left with a happy tummy!  Oh and I can't forget to mention, the warm ginger tea was SO yum!!! Perfect if you're feeling a bit under the weather! :)"}
{"text":"Will definitely have to go back for another try.  We hit it on a Tuesday...they were packed and not prepared for the crowd.  One waiter for both inside and outside.  The misters outside were pooling on my table.  The food was AMAZING.  We had the Shaking Beef and I tried everyone's spring rolls and pho.  The Lychee mojito yummy.  It was a good sign to be so busy...but...hope they learn by their mistakes.  I would love to go back and sit inside.  It was so cute in there.  Have a feeling I could rate it 5 stars if I could sit inside.  PS:  We had to park across 7th St...their private lot in the back was full and a cab blocked our way to get through it."}
{"text":"A girlfriend and I came here for lunch and I had pretty high expectations. It has been on my to-eat list for a while now and I had heard some great things about it. Let me tell you though, I was not disappointed! The parking was a little difficult due to the small parking lot but after creating my own VIP spot, the rest of the outing was a complete success!   They had a cute little outdoor patio with comfortable seating. The staff was extremely pleasant and knowledgeable about the menu. They were very helpful in helping us find a good menu match for our mood.    We ended up splitting the Buddha/Chay (tofu and mushroom) spring rolls and the Shrimp/Tom spring rolls and they were both awesome! I was surprised that I liked the tofu spring rolls the most because I am not always a big tofu fan, but when dipping in the peanut sauce it was A-MAZ-ING! We also shared the Saigon/Bun salad with chicken and they were kind enough to split it for us without even asking.  The salad had a great light dressing and a perfect texture combining the chicken, sprouts, cucumber and lettuce. The crispy shallots and nuts were a perfect way to top it off!    We were very pleased with the whole experience and even started planning our next trip to go back before we left the restaurant. I can't wait to try the soup on my next visit."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time for my 23rd B-day w/ my family. It was AWESOME! we got spring rolls and Pho and some very  tasty drinks.  It was January so we had to sit inside but they do have a nice outside patio.  We all loved our food and have been back many times. If you like Vietnamese food this is one place you really should try. The service was great and have to say that the bathrooms are cool. haha :) If you are going to be w/ a large group i would call ahead and have a table ready for you."}
{"text":"Everything about the service and food of this place was mediocre. Our waters were never refilled and I felt like we were ignored the entire time. We got sat right away, but waited for quite awhile for our food to come out. I wouldn't mind waiting, but there was barely anyone in the place.  My mother had the noodle salad which was decent and fresh. I ordered a beef pho and it was terrible. The broth was bland and the noodles weren't even cooked all the way. PLEASE try Pho Thanh or other great pho places in the area if you think the pho here is actually good. This place is over-priced and over-rated for what it actually is."}
{"text":"Went Friday at 6 p.m. to catch the tail-end of Happy Hour which has reasonable discounts on drinks. The bar has a good selection of liquor and beer.  This was my fourth time and the service has always been consistent and attentive. Had the Garlic Fries as a shared appetizer which was tasty and disappeared quickly. The four of us stayed with Pho - Mignon (with tender chunks of Filet), Tom (with tender shrimp), and Ga (with plentiful chiken breast). Bowls were plentiful, the herbs were fresh and the flavors varied.   All-in-all and enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"This place is adorable! I was very excited to try it after hearing great reviews. Went in for lunch yesterday and ordered almost a lil of everything on the menu. Started with the wings ($9) in fish sauce. OMGGGGG best thing I ever ate. I would come here alone just for the wings. MUST ORDER. they were crisp and flavorful and made to order. Ordered spring rolls fried and not fried one with ahi tuna, mango, avo and other with chix and basil. Loved the tuna one more. Husband ordered the banh mi pork sandwich we were stuffed at this point. Huge sandwich $9 comes with choice of fries or ...We got the garlic fries. This place is fab I will be back to try their soups and other spring rolls."}
{"text":"We have been there twice.  Nice ambiance, super energy.  Food was  presented beautifully and tasted great.  The happy hour is from 11-6  and includes both food and drinks.  Coronado is lucky to have this addition to the growing number of great restaurants in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Despite all the comments about a smelly restaurant we decided that people tend to exaggerate and we would give it a chance. There is no exaggeration this place smells like a sewer and has flys everywhere.  We could not stay to sample the food the odor was unbearable."}
{"text":"Update: I used to love this place, but the quality has gone so far down hill, in all aspects. I don't recommend you waste your time here. -------- By far my absolute favorite restaurant in Arizona!!! It was by luck I found this little gem, I was actually headed down 7th Street with my boyfriend to try out a new taco shop we had heard about... long story short we passed a sign that read \"Rice Paper- Modern Vietnamese\"... a girl like Mr couldn't resist. I whipped the car around and the rest is history.  Enviorment- let me just say this restaurant is located in the cutest most cozy part of Phoenix I would say just about 5 minutes away from downtown Phoenix. I loved how laid back it was, what I was wearing was felt irrelevant but I would suggest leaving your sweats at home. In terms of decor this restaurant hit the spot!  I love that the actual building was very old and they kept  the character of that building by leaving the exposed brick walls as is.  Service- Awesome! We had a great server who was knowledgeable about the menu as well as very attentive.  Food- FLAVOR HEAVEN!!!  Do not live in Arizona or visit Arizona without trying these wings! They give you a choice of two flavors: fish sauce and butter garlic my boyfriend and I couldn't decide which one we preferred so we had them split 50/50....and let me tell you both the fish sauce although it may sound weird and the butter garlic were out of this world! And to top it off these wings were perfectly crispy and I can't say that about any other wings I've had. We also had crispy pork rolls, which were just as amazing.  For entrees my boyfriend had mignon pho which we both loved and I had the braised pork sandwich. I'll speak on the sandwich more so because I only had a bite of my boyfriend pho.  My sandwich was the gift that kept on giving, every single time I took a bite, I bit into a new flavor; from the freshly baked bread to the moist pork to the carrots, the jalapenos, the homemade mayonnaise....everything on this sandwich was absolutely perfect I still crave it till this day!  Price-  appx. $42.00 before tip Overall- I highly recommend Rice Paper!!!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place.  The ambiance and food are outstanding! The Saigon Salad with chicken is my favorite! This is a local establishment at its finest."}
{"text":"Literally walked in and was overwhelmed by the large amount of flies and the sewage/portapotty type stink.  Even at that thought ok let's sit outside where the air is fresh...... Wrong! Shit smell was even worse outside!! We left immediately and honestly unless this place burned down and was rebuilt I doubt I would even consider it again. Quite a shame. For all of the sewage comments you would think they would have done something by now.."}
{"text":"Rice Paper is a trendy modern spot, meaning more American friendly. Nestled in a crappy side of Phoenix, the parking is challenging so be prepared for a hike if you aren't fortunate enough to park at the actual restaurant. It is tiny but I like cozy so avoid claustrophobia during lunch rush. I recommend the Surf and Turf spring rolls for sure. The pho is good but if you are an Asian foodie, you may snub it as there are more authentic spots out there. Staff is friendly but you may have to wait for attention when they are slammed. I'm just happy there's a pho spot when I have to frequent that side of town for meetings :)"}
{"text":"Great little spot it central Phx to grab a light meal, and maybe splurge a bit with a Vietnamese coffee and dessert. But what made this experience memorable wasn't the great cuisine. It was fantastic (among lots of little treasures in the same area) it was our server. David. Wonderful suggestions, excellent knowledge on the menu. And what a personality. Its rare you find a server anymore who isn't just going through the motions. Great asset to an already winning establishment. Something like that IS the decision maker when you and your friends are deciding where to go."}
{"text":"Absolutely unimpressive. Went here for lunch yesterday with a couple of workmates. Which was a Tuesday - a day on which, inexplicably, all other Vietnamese restaurants in the area are CLOSED - so at least this was an initial point in their favour. If you've read my other Vietnamese restaurant reviews you'll know that I only ever eat pho (dac biet) and was planning to order that here. Eyes popped out of my head when I saw that they charge $10 for a bowl! There also weren't different sizes for the dish, so I guessed (correctly, as it turns out) that they only had a small size. Still, I decided to give it a shot. I also noticed that their menu was extremely limited - there were almost more varieties of spring roll, which I HATE, than pretty much any other food category. The waiter told us that they were famous for their rolls.. whatever. I got the pho.  It was a small size. Of course.  In fact, the amount of pho in the bowl was positively pissant. Within maybe five minutes I had finished it off completely and was still quite hungry. And just like Saigon Kitchen in Surprise, they served a small fistful of bean sprouts, some pathetic wilted basil, and a couple of tiny slices of lime. Basically a kids-meal-sized amount of garnish. Oh, and a tiny dish with nothing on it (arguably to contain sauce, though there was no sriracha or anything else on the table). The broth was almost tasteless and there were no tendon pieces at all. Trust me, I looked hard. I spent the next ten minutes fishing forlornly, and mostly unsuccessfully, for strands of noodles at the bottom of the broth.  They had a telly showing the Olympics above the bar. Unfortunately, half the communal dining benches face the opposite direction so I had to watch Sally Pearson take gold in the women's 100m hurdles in an ornate mirror. That was the high point of the experience.  They then gave us the wrong bill, which was presented as a receipt pinned to a small block with a cheap wooden clothespeg. Might as well have printed it on a sheet of sh1tter paper too.  Won't be going back. Barely got two stars. I'm happy to wait out the \"Vietnamese weekend\" - ie Tuesday - in future, and grab a bowl of pho that's twice the size and thrice the flavour for three bucks cheaper at Pho Thanh, Da Vang, Maxim or 43rd Express. If you like spring rolls, knock yourself out. If you like pho, freakin' avoid this place like the plague. Remember, New India Bazaar is a couple hundred yards down the road, and THEY have all you can eat - and all the flavour you need - for $8. I couldn't agree more with Matthew K - the value IS way out of line."}
{"text":"Just found out about this spot and went there on a date on Friday and had a great time. Atmosphere was cool, sorta hip type place. Food was great and service was outstanding (I don't typically use the word outstanding). We got the edamame, buddha spring roll, veggie pho, and salmon entree and it was all great. I think all of that was under $40 too..will be back."}
{"text":"If you give me beer for $2.75 and some small dishes for a fair price, I will be back for more and more. Everything was good from the spring rolls to the pork sandwich. To end it off, we had some coffee THEIR way and OMG I love strong ice coffee but wow that was crack. I love it so much I got some to-go. See ya soon girls."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, a bad experience. Bad service. Spring rolls not well wrapped which made a mess. The bread for the banh mi was stale. I ordered a coke, which they served me...and it was completely flat. When I brought this to the waiters attention, he said yeah...the carbonation in their machine was broken. So you served me a bad drink knowingly? And they were out of their Vietnamese coffee at 2 pm. Overall, disappointed in this place."}
{"text":"I visited Rice Paper last week. I was promptly greeted but the one thing I noticed in the bar/dining area was a putrid smell. I was really hungry so I moved to the sitting area closest to the door where it was fine. The service was extremely slow considering it wasn't even lunch time. The food was just okay. I've had better Pho and spring rolls for half the price I paid at Rice Paper. In addition the chicken Pho made both my guest and I sick later that evening. With that said, we should have followed our guts and left but it was a painful learning experience. We will not me back again."}
{"text":"So, like others have mentioned, I too was super excited about the addition of a Vietnamese joint here in Phoenix. Similarily, like others, I was let down a little bit by Rice Paper. I love love the look of the place and am hoping they can adjust a few things about the food. I have worked at Dragonfly Vietnamese Kitchen in Mesa and KNOW good Vietnamese food when I see it. I'd have to suggest that  1- The wait staff know the cuisine a little better as we ordered a pho tai by its name and she didnt know what it was 2- the spring rolls have more flavor and meat, less rice noodle, rolled more tightly, and maye some marinated carrots and daikon in them all . It was super filled with rice noodle, too much  3- the pho be more fragrant and less salty 4- PRICES need to be lowered for the soup at least.   parking was also an issue but it can be like that in the city so nothin can really be done bout that, just be forwarned.  That being said, I do think that it has potential. I will try again perhaps in a few months to check out any changes that have been made.  I love the freshness of Vietnamese eating, and hope to be in love with rice paper eventually since it is so close to home!"}
{"text":"Not that good . Average at best.. No Bok Choy and Pho was served warm  this was first.Spring rolls were good but $3.50 per roll are overpriced. Very limited menu for my liking - Pho Dalat in Tempe off Elliott Rd is preferred , much better food  , better menu options and price is more favorable. I could not recommend  the Rice Paper , I am about the food !!!"}
{"text":"Place smelled like a porto-potty, flys everywhere, all veggies were old brown and wilted, filthy floors, overpriced mediocre food, poor service, drinking glasses were dirty, just the WORST dining experience. I think this place needs to be shut down by the health department.  Please don't waste your money here!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed the vegetarian pho.  I didn't love sitting at the community table but it was an experience.  Great service!"}
{"text":"Awful service and non-existent management.  For the sake of full disclosure my partner and I are REGULARS at Rice Paper's sister house Bonjour Vietnam. The differences in service and quality could not have been more painfully obvious. I have also met the owner, Lon, and will be forwarding a copy of this directly to her.  My partner was in the mood for Pho and we had not tried Rice Paper and as we are locals and love Bonjour we decided to make the trip. It was Friday night and moderately busy, but not packed. Let the nightmare begin!  Our server was quickly at our table but seemed oddly aloof.  He also did not introduce himself which is generally the custom in most restaurants.  We ordered two Happy Buddha beers, bottled sake, and a Tuna spring roll.  The sake comes out but no beer.  Okay. I finally call the server over and at just that moment he brings over three spring rolls, the one we ordered and two more that had the name  \"Buddha\" in them!  It didn't occur to him to clarify what should have immediately struck him as an odd order because he was totally disengaged from what he was supposed to be doing.  Order sake but no beer and order three orders of spring rolls as an appetizer for two people?  Really?  I pooh-poohed it away and just had him bring the beer and take the rolls away. No biggie.  I order the lemongrass chicken and she orders \"Ga\" which is basically chicken Pho. Now listen carefully. My entrée is served a full seven minutes before hers. My entrée was unpalatable as the chicken had the consistency of medallions of hockey puck and the garlic noodles had hardened  into the consistency of guitar strings. The Pho was okay.  Meanwhile our server is standing at the bar, looking forlorn, staring up at the TV, while waiting for a drink for another table (or perhaps for himself?). My rage was palpable at this point. I call the server to our table and say \" you're not the least bit interested in whether or not we're enjoying this meal.\"  His response?  \"I was just coming over to check.\"  We were done eating at that point. He had stopped by once to toss a tray of undescribed condiments on the table. I call for the manager, who doubled as a bartender.  Two minutes with her told me she was a bartender doubling as a manager. She removed the Pho from our check because it was later (and cheaper?) than my entrée.  The sum of her excuses?  It was busy.  As anyone who knows anything about this business knows; when the house is busy the efficiency triples because every server and staff member is engaged. Not so with Rice Paper.  Lame bordering on contemptuous service, food of stunning mediocrity or worse."}
{"text":"Great fresh food. The rolls on the front of the menu are excellent!! I've only had the vegetable pho (veghead) and that was really delicious too!  Great selection of drinks at the bar and a very friendly staff.    I will definitely return and will recommend to friends."}
{"text":"i've become a major fan of rice paper. sit is trustin's section and you'll have an amazing experience.  i'm a big fan of the fire cracker shrimp and the pho."}
{"text":"I tried getting into this place a couple of times only to be denied by lack of parking and a packed house. However, I was finally able to get in and ordered a few of the spring rolls. The spicy spring roll with the fried pork was fantastic! So spicy I almost passed out. Now that's my kinda nummy.  I also ordered the veggie Pho but asked to add meat to it. I need my meat. It was a very good bowl of Pho...Pho sure. I will definitely go back.  Update: I rode my bike with a friend over to Rice Paper on Saturday and I had a blast! I sat outside with the owner and we all spent about 20 minutes chatting, drinking and having a good ole time.   We ordered a lot of food and spent a lot of money. We loved the calamari so much that we got 2 orders. We had a few drinks, sat out on the patio, which is new and has great plans ahead for it. The owner tells me that they will be putting in a fireplace outside and everything.  I am definitely going to be a regular at this joint. Great food, great staff and friendly owner!  As for parking. You can park next door and across the street. You can also park up against the building next to the establishment right in the driveway. Just make sure you leave room for others to get by and for more cars to park. I have a feeling this place is going to be the talk of the town.  The only negative thing I have to say is that I believe if you come in during happy hour you should get happy hour prices the whole time you're there. I've been to a lot of places that do this, some don't...I wish they all would though."}
{"text":"Great restaurant in the Sheridan Square neighborhood!  We sat outside and enjoyed the beautiful night with misters.  The service was friendly and helpful, the atmosphere was nice and the food was good.  I started with the pork spring rolls and followed it with the lemongrass chicken.  Both were very fresh, flavorful and tasty!"}
{"text":"Their phone number doesn't even work, so don't even try to call in."}
{"text":"I give rice paper five stars because the food is delicious and the restaurant is clean and pretty. It's gourmet Vietnamese food. The service is always great. There is a large selection of spring rolls and the edamame is spicy and sooo good."}
{"text":"Great experience! Super friendly staff and very helpful offering suggestions on ordering since it was our first time in. Food was soo good. My new favorite! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Had the Pho Mignon and it hit the spot for this cold weather! Ordered the large because the prix and size makes more sense. Also had the edamame and it was seasoned just right! Our server was a bit slow but the bus girl made up for it. Overall, it was a good experience :)"}
{"text":"Cute place great for lunch. Get the chicken wings with fish sauce and the pork spring rolls."}
{"text":"I continue to have wonderful dining experiences at Rice Paper.  I highly recommend"}
{"text":"There are many options for good pho in the valley. Rice Paper is not just good, it's great! I've been eating pho for years and this is by far the best in Phoenix! Ben our waiter made us feel like we were guests in his home. Warm and friendly environment."}
{"text":"we love love this place!!  Found by fluke on yelp if course... Not wanting to drive back to Scottsdale to our former fav pho place.. Looking for one closer to our neighborhood.   Rice paper was a wonderful surprise!  Cute lil old house turned into restaurant.. Atmosphere is awesome casual.  Full bar w interesting drink menu (although I haven't tried any cuz I don't think to drink besides water w my pho!) appetizers awesome.  Pho amazing and the service too. Wahoooo. Dominick was sup sweet & attentive the 2nd visit.. But since then James has become out regular server and we adore him!!  Thx James n see you soon!!"}
{"text":"Last night was AWESOME! We celebrated Binnie's birthday at Rice Paper on 7th Street and had great food, great beer and - of course, great company.  Started with Fire Cracker Shrimp, Crispy Calamari and Wings as appetizers (the wings were DEFINITELY my favorite, though all were great) then moved on to the spring rolls filled with Tuna, Soft-Shelled Crab and Shrimp. GOD, YUMMMM! From there, we did the Pho (which gets REALLY spicy with a big dollop of \"the red stuff\") and finished everything with cupcakes that they let us bring in from Urban Cookies.  If you haven't been there yet, GO! It's small, but WAY cool and Derrick, our waiter was THE BEST! Since none of us were really used to ordering Vietnamese food, he was really helpful and SO friendly. This spot for me is a definite repeat, despite some of the comments about service and prices on Yelp. 7 of us ate till we were STUFFED and 6 of us had beers. Total bill was $122 (plus tip). So, I don't think that was bad at all..  SO MUCH FUN, and Happy Birthday Binnie!!!!"}
{"text":"Great ambiance, good location, decent food and mediocre parking.   Down town had been lacking a trendy nuvo take on Vietnamese food, and this nicely fills the void.  The menu is full of rolls $4-$5  Bhan Mi's $8-10 and Pho` .   I opted for the vegetarian bhan mi with tofu and shitake mushrooms. $8 it came with a side of sweet potato fries.  I like the idea however in practice the sandwich was a bit dry, I  mostly got bread flavor and it would have been nice if they cut it in to two smaller hand sized pieces instead of one long roll. The fries were done well which can be hard for sweet potato fries and came with a aoli and ketchup. Really its 3.5 stars.  There also is a nice bar and they do have a hppy hour where rolls are $1 off."}
{"text":"I will work for Vietnamese food! I am hooked on it! :)  Another great addition to the Coronado area and a very trendy and chill environment.  Their spring rolls are completely amazing!! I usually get chicken with their delicious peanut sauce. I can eat like 10 of them, but that's just a starter for me. Their sandwiches with sweet potato fries or garlic are very good. The sandwich bread seems a little too hard, so make sure to ask them not to toast the bread so long. They have great toppings, like carrots, cucumbers, etc. If you opt for one of their soups, their chicken noodle is quite good, although it isn't at the top of my list for chicken noodle soups.   The ambiance here is just right and everyone is very friendly!"}
{"text":"I loved this place! Visited 10-13, the food was very good, lots of vegetarian options. Read reviews after I ate there about funky smells and insect problems, glad I didn't before, probably would have been scared off. The restaurant was cute, looked and smelled clean. The server and assistant (pink hair) were awesome. He handled our party of six with ease and she kept our drinks full with a smile. Best service I've had in a long time, thanks, we'll be back!"}
{"text":"The food is phenomenal; however, the service is so horrible it's almost a joke. You will wait at least 20 minutes for everything, be it your drink, chop sticks, and/or dressing for your salad. Whatever my husband and I needed, I had to get up and more or less get it myself. I like drawn out dinners but this place is to the point of ridiculous. The service is unapologetically slow which is a shame because the food is good, you'll just be incredibly annoyed at the incompetence required to get something as simple as a glass of water. Please, get it together, Rice Paper is a small restaurant and there is no excuse for the utter deficient service."}
{"text":"New spot. One of those great small finds, we will be coming again. Good food and service. I got pho soup as did my boyfriend. Got a little less meat than we usually do in our pho soups, but still a great taste!"}
{"text":"Calling Rice Paper a Vietnamese restaurant is like calling Panda Express a Chinese Restaurant. Enough said."}
{"text":"This place is good but the parking is very difficult. Highly recommended go when not busy for finding parking. Food is great especially the sweet potato fries. The spring rolls very fresh. Happy chow"}
{"text":"I should have taken my own advice and stayed far away from this place. Our most recent visit ended hastily when I was served rotten tuna and got barely a \"sorry\" from the staff. I could smell that the fish had gone horribly, horribly off when the ahi tuna salad was put before me by the waiter, and I'm shocked that the kitchen actually thought they'd get away with sending it out. The waiter disappeared so quickly from my table that I had to go hunt him down to point out the bad smell at my table was coming from the food, and he took my plate back to the kitchen and five minutes later came back to say, \"okay, we all smelled it and there's definitely something wrong there.\"  Seriously? You had to go pass it around to confirm that I'm not crazy when you can clearly tell within ten seconds that this is not how raw fish should smell? After all this, their solution was to comp an appetizer, not the salad, and eventually gave me a new salad to go, which I decided not to eat just to be on the safe side.   Look, I'm not scared to eat week old leftovers or sushi at a divey joint and I don't really get freaked out by the cleanliness of restaurants, but this could have been dangerous.  I have absolutely warned off all my coworkers and friends against this place, and now I'm warning all of Yelp. It could have been handled in a way that left me confident that it was just another new restaurant kink, but the awful service made it clear that's not the case and I shudder to think of what new low they'll sink to."}
{"text":"THE ABSOLUTE BEST AND FRESHEST VIETNAMESE food in the valley. I f you have tried other Vietnamese restaurants and have been dissapointed, give this a try. You will be very glad you did. The restaurant is a quaint historical building with a clean and crisp decor. Cocktails are fab!"}
{"text":"The food is fresh and beautiful here but once again my complaint is that they don't season anything.  I had the seared ahi tuna salad which I don't think actually touched a pan and had nothing on it. No sesame seed crust, nothing!   They serve it with  a very small amount of ginger dressing that could also use some zip. Just because you bring a trio of hot sauces to the table doesn't mean the cook can't do some seasoning before the food reaches the table.   The pho looks good maybe you should try it. It comes with a generous side of basil, green onions and jalapeños.   I won't be back."}
{"text":"Just what my friend and I needed post-work/pre-flight. We found it on yelp after striking out at about four different places. I'm glad we found it - it turned out to be PERFECTOOO!  We both ordered some spring rolls (I had the traditional, she had tempura fried shrimp in hers, two different sauces but we both preferred the traditional peanut sauce)  I had a vietnamese sandwich that was delicious (pulled pork, veggies, LOTS of cilantro per my request, on a big baguette) My friend had a singapore salad that was ENORMO and yummy.  Nice decor, nice waiter - we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves!"}
{"text":"First time trying Vietnamese food, had the chicken phó, and it was really good, and I don't think you really need to get a drink because the cucumber water is really refreshing!"}
{"text":"My husband and I frequent Rice Paper for happy hour and have never been disappointed. The service has always been great. The firecracker shrimp is addictive. Happy hour menu has lots to choose from. We have sampled quite a few of the spring rolls and have never been disappointed. Awesome atmosphere too."}
{"text":"This place does spring rolls right and at a happy hour price! I can successfully say Ive never eatin one I didn't enjoy. However, their braised pork bahn mi lacked the authentic taste I've come to expect from the veit sandwich"}
{"text":"Fist thing first, We Immediately had a good feeling when someone was pulling out of a parking spot just as we were pulling in. SCORE.  So we go in, sit down, order Appetizers, Drinks, And eventually Pho. The highlight of the meal was the surf and turf spring roll this thing is gangster, it has this teriyaki pork thing going on with fresh shrimp and a Thai Peanut dipping sauce, Gangster.   Our water then arrives, and i love cucumber water so I was pumped, WAS. I looked over and there was a bug the size of a fingernail in my water. After I noticed this I flagged down our waitress and received a new water. and they comp'ed an appetizer to try and make it right.   Our server was just ok.  The food as a whole was alright, Appetizers are the best thing this place has to offer.  I would go back for a vodka cilantro press, and Surf and turf spring rolls."}
{"text":"Amazing spring rolls! Can't wait to try their soup;) perfect lunch date place"}
{"text":"Parking is a huge issue, which is understandable, because of this small-house-converted-into-a-restaurant...but service is another issue...just plain HOR-RI-BLE for it being such a small place!!! It took a long time for the wait staff to notice me, then it was even an excessive wait to get my draft beer!!...the spring roll only had fillers of rice noodles, with the exception of a tiny piece o' shrimp hiding for dear life within the forest of lettuce. The pho was their saving grace, but I can get a more authentic experience for 1/3 the price. The waitress was kind, apologizing that I came during a hectic time...but shouldn't you be prepared to make a great first impression?"}
{"text":"Miss Saigon meets Brooklyn but in a good and non reproachable way. An inventive and expansive take on the Vietnamese classics that we've grown to love.  Good portions that satisfy your appetite without weighing down your afternoon.  Yet another win for the Coronado area."}
{"text":"The food is amazing. Shaking beef with garlic noodles are always a go to and worth the price (23$ range) the happy hour is awesome.. Good beer specials and the chicken spring rolls yum. Cherè is one of the bartenders and is awesome.. So personable and makes you feel welcome the whole time you're there. If she leaves, I won't come back.. Just sayin..."}
{"text":"Well, my wife and I went back to Rice Paper for another try at the PHO.  We love Pho and other vietnamese food so much.  This time the PHO was much better tasting, they figured out the recipe or had a different cook that night.  I would like a little more comfortable seat for my old butt, but I guess I will have to deal with the cheap seats.  Thanks for improving the PHO, just add more noodles and we are going to increase this rating next time!"}
{"text":"The shaking beef was ok but the pho was really bad. The noodles were over cooked and old. The rare meat was freeze dried. The meatballs were rotten and gave me a horrible stomach ache. It felt like the bowl was pre-made and the just added broth. The broth was bland at best. It could have used more spices like ginger star anise, cinnamon, cloves, coriander, etc..."}
{"text":"INCREDIBLE food: amazingly fresh and delicous spring rolls, light and flavorful pho, scrumptious firecracker shrimp, generous salads...    My husband and I have been here more times than we can count - we are basically regulars, depite never living less than 25 minutes away.  The food is THAT GOOD.  Between the two of us and the friends we've brought here, we've tried everything on the menu, and it's all remarkable.   This healthy version of Vietnamese food will knock your socks off - don't get me wrong, there are also amazing garlic fries.  And if you saved room for dessert, the creme brulee is wonderful.  The service is top notch - a rare combination of super competent and genuinely warm.  The place itself is small and cozy, and the decor is neat mixture of bamboo, Budha and modern.  We've come here on dates, with friends, for business meetings, for birthdays, with house guests from all over the country -  and every single person we've brought has loved it."}
{"text":"Was in North Phoenix and the wifey wants Pho, the closest place to grab it was at Rice Paper. She places the order and I head there to pick it up. Fist off who builds a door that walks right into the toilet washroom. It was awkward to enter the building and dodge a woman coming out of the bathroom to wash her hands. The waitstaff were all hanging around the bar gleaming over the one seated table, and the welcome was less than enthusiastic. Our food was waiting for us on the bar and I paid and left as quickly as possible. We ordered the following: combo pho minus the tripe, veggie pho, chicken pho and some spring rolls. Now my wife is vegan and is very attentive to what she orders. Rice Paper claimed the broth to be vegitarian, however when we got into mixing our soup we noticed that it was the same broth as the other soups we ordered. The broth was overly salted and didn't have the nice fragrant smell like other places that don't suck. My brother ordered the Pho without tripe and guess what? They gave him tripe. My chicken Pho was mediocre and with enough lime juice and Sriracha tasted fine. Had the soup been descent, had the experience picking up my food been pleasant the prices are not so bad. All in all we spent $40 bucks for the experience to cross this restaurant off the list. Next time the wifey wants Pho, I'll spend the extra gas to get to Tempe."}
{"text":"Great happy hour!!!!!! Amazing spring rolls. Just what Phoenix needed"}
{"text":"Go for the drinks, unique spring rolls and fire cracker shrimp. Happy hour is pretty decent. Pho was mediocre, and more expensive than most Vietnamese restaurants I've been to.  Service has been hit or miss- one night we had a great server and the next time just so-so.   The decor is cute and nice atmosphere, although I have had better pho in some of the more \"hole in the wall\" no frills restaurants. Just depends on what you are looking for."}
{"text":"We stopped in for dinner, didn't really have any formal plans and definitely didn't even know about this gem. Like many of those cute bungalow house restaurants along 7th, I was pleasantly surprised with the menu and the vibe of the place. Cute modern and casual decor; indoor and outdoor patio seating areas which provide great options for parties of all sizes. Our server was super friendly, offered great menu suggestions, paid attention to our drink levels, was attentive without hovering. Now: the food. I had a theory that all Vietnamese is the same and I was proven wrong. Excellent tuna spring roll- mango and this really great sauce; the salmon entree was superb. I split the spring roll and enter with my friend. We both felt like we had plenty of food without feeling over full. And the best part- local produce and ingredients- clean, good, healthy food. Next time I'm in the neighborhood I'm there!"}
{"text":"This is my place for pho and spring rolls since they have the best selection that I've been to in Phoenix. I have been to many pho places in CA and Az and this place never disappoints. I hate people that complain about \"authenticity\". If you want \"authentic \" have your mother make it. Every place I've been to does something different and that's good. They are trying new things while giving you great favors. Anyway, I drive from Verrado just to go to this place. Love it!"}
{"text":"Although it is the most expensive pho place I have been- it's really good. The broth has so much flavor. I'm not crazy about the meat, but I really enjoyed the shrimp pho. The service is also very good- and the ambiance works too.   It's very small and cozy- I would probably avoid the place if it were packed, but it never has been when I have visited.  Also, if you can't find a parking spot- they have additionally parking in a parking lot a couple buildings north of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Came here last week late one evening when the bf was craving pho but all our usual places close before then. They didn't have thai tea :(  Ordered 2spring rolls, one traditional and the other was a vegetarian something with tempura asparagus.  The pork in the traditional was very tough. The veggie one was great. A little pricey/small compared to your typical pho joint though, as the traditional was 3.75 and the veggie 3.25 (I think I usually pay, like, 3 bucks for the same thing, but slightly bigger). They both were (described to me as) one roll cut in half. Sauces were tasty, especially the pesto stuff for the veggie one. Ben got the combination soup with meatballs, tripe, and tendon at $10 a bowl (usually we'd pay less than 6 bucks for the same thing....) He loved it, as usual. I got the chicken banh mi and the garlic fries. The meat in the sandwich tasted like your dark meat chicken (i describe it as a little funky. Not off-putting, just funky). And that's ok, but I'd prefer higher priced meat in my $8 sandwich. But the fries were Deeeelicious!   I'll be back for the fries."}
{"text":"I never would have thought a Vietnamese restaurant would put me in the holiday mood, but it did! I will get to my reasoning, but first let me say why I'm giving Rice Paper five stars. It's because they have an adorable restaurant with a perfect atmosphere, they have delicious food and they have friendly staff.   Rice Paper is situated on a busy Phoenix road but once inside the adorable little historic house, it feels like you've been transformed into a home away from home. They restored a historic house and adapted it into a restaurant that can accommodate those looking for a meal or those looking for some cocktails alike. The atmosphere is very modern zen-like with each table places perfectly apart from each other, quaint light fixtures warming up the restaurant and a long bar with seating and plenty of drinks to choose from.  Most importantly is the food. The food here is delicious. It's the perfect combination of filling yet light. We started with the spring rolls and here I must warn you that if you order one that has \"spice\" mentioned at all in the description, be warned that they do not go light on the Sriracha. The spring roll was delicious but so spicy, my mouth burned for a good 20 minutes following. I think I also made the mistake of drinking diet coke in attempt to ease the burning but it really only made it worse. The burn from Sriracha seems to only disappear if you power through it.   Rice Paper is know for their Pho so it's a must to order it! I went with the chicken Pho and this is where I entered into the holiday spirit. The Pho is warm and filled with wintry spices that remind me of Christmas with each warm sip. If I closed my eyes I could have imagined looking outside to see a crisp snow-filled day (instead of busy 7th street on a 70 degree day). I actually ordered the vegetarian Pho and added chicken in order to get all the vegetables. It was the perfect meal. It was filling but felt light and didn't put me into an afternoon food coma.   I can see Rice Paper being the perfect spot for a date night or lunchtime meeting. It's great to stop by for an appetizer and cocktails before heading out for the night, or making this your main stop for the night and staying for a meal."}
{"text":"this was our first visit here. we arrived just at the end of happy hour, so our really cool server kept saying \"ok, you have about 2 minutes before happy hour is over\" and we were able to get a couple of drinks and rolls ordered.   the amount of fresh rolls they offer is amazing! we're use to the standard fried veggie rolls, but at Rice Paper, we had many more options. for my main dish, i opted for the curry. it was spicy, but not so hot i had trouble eating it.   the food was excellent, the prices were more than reasonable. the service staff was top notch and friendly. and the atmosphere is super cute."}
{"text":"Came in here for lunch with co-workers.  So glad we did! We shared the edamame which were done perfectly - just enough kick but not too much.  We shared some rolls - a shrimp (which I could not eat) and pork.  I couldn't get over how fresh everything tasted so far.  Then I had the braised pork banh mi.  The bread was a tad overpowering, however it was made up for with some amazing flavor. I had the garlic fries as my side which came with a delicious chipotle mayo dipper.  The fries were to die for as well.  Service was amazing.  We were in a time crunch, and he was attentitive, super helpful with the menu and quick - bringing our check out while were were still eating so we could up and go.    Loved the minimal modern decor with pops of color.   All around great experience and I can't wait to head back again!"}
{"text":"This was my first time here & it will probably be my only time. The fresh spring rolls were good, the Pho was OK but the service was really bad. There were only a few people there but they still managed to forget our coffee. Not a good first impression at all."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places for pho and spring rolls! I've been coming here for a while and I'm always delighted with the food and service! The place is also very tastefully decorated!"}
{"text":"Came back and gave it another shot.   Once we came in, every server walked past us but one guy found the time to tell us to sit where we wanted to.  We had menus placed and it was a good ten minutes before anyone came and orders were taken. They had to ask if anyone took care of us.. Got our waters shortly after. Also, I've been making eye contact with the staff to let them know we were ready but everyone seems to be in a hurry.  They have a very small menu. One whole page is spring rolls and egg rolls, which, considering my last experience, I avoided. The back half is pho and a handful of select entrees.   I had a small pho and SO had Shaking Beef. Shaking Beef was prettily presented. It's also a small portion with an even smaller portion of rice for 20 dollars. SO finished in five minutes and was just waiting on me.   I had the small mignon pho. Broth was clear but pretty indistinguishable. The mignon was still tender after floating in the hot broth for a while tho, so a small plus.   So two entrees sans drinks/apps/dessert plus tip came to $40.   Now... If you went to any other Vietnamese restaurant with two entrees, which likely will be much more filling, I guarantee your total is under 20.   Is Vietnamese fusion skimping on ingredients and jacking prices up? I'll let you guys decide but I would not recommend this place for a first timer at viet food.   Lack of stars is for shoddy service, small menu, and a pretty big disconnect between price and quality.   Also the place closes at midnight, at least on the day we went, but the kitchens closed at 10pm.. 2 hours early so be forewarned if you're looking for a late dinner."}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday night! Amazing shrimp spring rolls- their peanut sauce is probably the best I have had in a long time. Also had their chicken pho soup- it was delish! The bartender was able to make me a mixed cocktail using their green tea- very creative and refreshing."}
{"text":"I would visit this place every day just for the hospitality! The staff was genuinely nice, funny, and helpful. The food was delicious. Prices were very reasonable, and at happy hour they're even better!"}
{"text":"This little converted house is very cozy and the decor is fresh and hip.  Yes, it's trendy, so if you are into dives or prefer pub food, this isn't for you, but the food is delicious and the staff is very friendly and helpful. Their spicy edamame is the best I have ever had.  I am not a fan of the salmon salad, so I would definitely skip that next time, but the rolls are all delicious and fresh - you can't go wrong there.  My friend has the pho and she loved it. The wait staff is very friendly and on the ball.  And they have a nice and affordable wine list...which, as anyone who has read my reviews knows, is really what it's all about for me.  This place is on 7th Street near Thomas so very centrally-located.  Nice for dinner OR lunch."}
{"text":"Completely unbelievable. I ordered one chicken and one cube filet pho. The pho is usually very good but the order we got wasn't even cooked it was fully raw! They should be completely shut down for serving raw meat and on top of that they mixed both the filet and the chicken. They had so much time to cook and get this order right but they failed and it's disgusting. Also they forgot the jalapeños. Beware of what you eat here."}
{"text":"Pho has slowly been gaining steam, but will never take the place of Chinese or Sushi in American diets. The rest of the menu on a \"real\" Vietnamese restaurant is not ready to be presented to the masses.  Rice Paper makes a mediocre attempt to bring the popular dishes to the forefront. The spring roll selection is impressive, but not too flavorful. The pho is decent, but overpriced, like everything else.  I have not been able to sample the remaining house dishes and will most likely not return to experience.  The cocktails were poorly made, but the service was very friendly. If you're a food newbie, this is a great place to start your culinary adventures. If you're already an adventurous foodie, look elsewhere (Da Vang)."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar eating lunch and a cockroach walked around. Escaped before it could be killed. Yuck"}
{"text":"I came into this charming little establishment with a friend. We were sat pretty promptly and had drink orders taken. I had the iced green tea and she had water which was garnished with a slice of cucumber. I thought that was a nice touch.   We both started with spring rolls - she had the salmon, I had the barbecue pork. Both looked good and mine was tasty. Then we had both had a bowl of chicken pho. It was really tasty, however expensive for pho at $10/bowl.  That said,  the food was good. Not the best Vietnamese food I've ever had, but yummy just the same.   My only gripes were the little things. I've worked in the back of the house for a long time. So I know how much it costs to put this food together.  I just felt like everything was expensive for what it was. This is not a high end restaurant. Its a teensy little hipsterish Vietnamese place with minimal decor. Its a lunch spot essentially. My menu was printed on paper which is pretty commonplace these days so no big whoop. Unfortunately the menu looked like it had been used about 50 times. I understand re-using menus. Its totally common. To NOT do so would be environmentally irresponsible. It just looked really, really used and abused. Also, my dipping sauce ramekin had a huge chip in it. To be fair, I am hyper critical of EVERYTHING when it comes to service just because I come from a restaurant background.   Rice Paper gets 3 stars from me. It was eh... Luckily I had good company. I probably won't come here again though."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant.  Everything on the menu is very affordable. I've eaten here at least 6 times, I always bring new people here, it's a very relaxed place, cool music, seat yourself, a really good date or small group place. I always feel good after I eat here, it's all relatively healthy with tons of fresh veggies, and I know my food is always fresh. As far as the food goes, I love it, but if you're looking for authentic Vietnamese food this probably isn't the place to go. My favorite dish is the shrimp pho!"}
{"text":"I can't wait to go back to Rice Paper. The restaurant is simply adorable with. Nice patio and a very modern and chic inside.  we started with their spicy edamame. the edamame was coated with a spicy coating with soy and molasses and hot sauce. We tried their Bo Luc Lac which was simply fabulous with tender pieces of beef seasoned perfectly, their tuna salad with ginger dressing and their pho which was deliciously flavored. The spring rolls and bahn mi sandwiches looked delicious too"}
{"text":"We took my mom here while she visiting from Oregon.  We are recent transplants from Portland and always love a new Vietnamese restaurant!  We really liked the cute bungalow it was housed in and thought the inside decor had a nice & hip vibe to it.  Sort of reminded us of places in Portland.  We ended up ordering 3 of the fresh rolls as a starter.  They were really fabulous!  We tried the spider, buddha and another with mango.  No complaints with these!  My mom had the shaken beef and it was very flavorful and the meat was very tender.  My husband had the lemongrass chicken and also enjoyed it.  I had the Saigon salad with chicken.  This item fell flat for me.  The sauce was much too fishy and the chicken has a little gristly.  Our server was a very pleasant young man, but I felt like he might have had too many tables to deal with, as the service felt a bit frenetic at times.  However, it was slammed with people for a Sunday night and this could have been a mere staffing oversight.  We did talk with the owner for a bit.  Her name is Lan and she was a delight.  We had all travelled to Vietnam last year, so it was fun to ask her where she was from etc...So, all in all a very good experience here and we look forward to coming again."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of Vietnamese food and decided to come here during my lunch hour. The restaurant is built inside a house and is super adorable, even with a walkway to the front door! I walked in and was immediately greeted and was told to sit anywhere. I chose the bar and was immediately given a glass of water and a menu. Service was very friendly and helpful, since this was my first time in I had no idea what to order (other than Pho). I ordered an Ahi tuna spring roll and it was so fresh and fabulous! The miso ginger sauce is really tasty and a great way to start off a meal.   Next was a half bowl of pho ga and came out really quickly. I've had pho from many places and this one while not being the best, was still tasty. It was the right amount, but could have done with more meat! I decided to give this place a real test and ordered dessert, since I can't drink on the clock. The only dessert they had was a ginger crème Brule, which I wasn't super into but decided to order anyways. The Brule part was very overdone and the crème was a little too gingery for my liking. For $7, not worth it.  I left full and will return when I get another craving!"}
{"text":"This place needs a total makeover, with particular attention to the waitstaff. They are remarkably rude and lack basic listening skills. Cleanliness is clearly an issue in this establishment, too. Dine at your own risk!"}
{"text":"I was vey skeptical of this place thinking it would be over priced and not that good. I was pleasantly surprised by the new twist on one of my favorite things in the world (fresh rolls). The sauces are to die for and the even stock export 33 beer from Vietnam! The two ladies running this shop are fun inviting and cute to boot. This may be my new happy hour hangout."}
{"text":"We came here last night with a larger group, about 12-15; we called ahead and they said they don't take reservations, but they were very accommodating and jerry-rigged some tables on the patio for us.  Service wasn't exactly super speedy but our server was really wonderful and super attentive.  In fact, all of the wait staff was incredibly nice and friendly.  Food was absolutely terrific but a bit overpriced in my opinion.  I tried the firecracker shrimp and was a little let down that they weren't spicier....with a name like firecracker...but apparently I'm now told you can order them in different degrees of spiciness.  I will definitely come back to this place, its a real hidden gem!"}
{"text":"I went to rice paper about 2 weeks ago and ordered the pho with chicken, it was delicious, so delicious I knew I had to go back. I went back for my second visit this week and decided to order a spring roll and the chicken pho again, man such a disappointment. The spring roll meat was very chewy and unappealing to look at, and my pho was nothing compared to the previous time. The chicken seemed over boiled and lacked any type of flavor. I asked to add veggies to my pho but there was none on there.  Usually after eating pho I can't wait to eat it again. I left leaving very unsatisfied and don't believe I will be returning for a long while"}
{"text":"It's rare that I have a date with my husband on a Monday afternoon/evening, but this past Memorial Day, we did just that.  After a quick visit to the Science Center (the Van Gogh alive exhibit is a must-see by the way), we were hungry so we headed over to Rice Paper.  Neither of us had ever been before, and we were pleased with our experience.  It was a tad bit too hot to sit outside, although they do have a covered patio with misters.  We walked in and were seated and greeted promptly by Al, our server.  He's quite the character.  He made us laugh quite a bit in addition to being attentive and making some recommendations.  We enjoyed the stylish renovated house / hip colorful atmosphere as well.  We ended up ordering a few things and sharing.  Highlights included the firecracker shrimp. a spider roll, a shrimp roll, and a zen salad.  Everything was light and tasted fresh.  We really enjoyed the dipping sauces that came with the spring rolls.  They've got such a huge selection of the spring rolls, that I can't wait to return to try some of the others.  They don't have a huge selection of Vietnamese entrees, but it appears that they will custom create a bit upon request.  I highly recommend going for the \"food happy hour.\"  It's from 3pm - 6:30pm and includes $6 appetizers & $1 off all spring rolls.  Such a deal!  We didn't take advantage of it, but the \"drinks happy hour\" is actually 11am - 6:30pm and specialty drinks are $6, house wine by the glass is $5, well drinks are $4, and draft beer is just $2.75.  If only Rice Paper was a tad bit closer to home, I could see myself being a regular... Instead, I'll keep it high on my list of spots to return to when I find myself heading downtown!"}
{"text":"Over rated! Prices are jacked up and the food is Americanized. Not authentic Vietnamese food. There was also flys everywhere where we sat inside and there was this sewer smell."}
{"text":"Tried this new downtown Vietnamese eatery today. It was a little over-priced and the service logistics are still being worked out but the food was good. I think it will be a nice addition to CenPho lunch spots. We had the seared Ahi tuna spring roll ($4.50) which would have been better with more tuna in it but the sauce was quite tasty. The pho (noodle soup) was very good (beef or chicken pho is $9 a bowl). The aroma of the spices in the soup when they first sit the bowl in front of you made my mouth water. The place was busy but there were tables available. Still, it took quite a long time to get our food and the waiter - though very friendly and helpful - seemed overwhelmed with cleaning other tables, etc. contributing to the slow service. Luckily, however, we were in no rush. The ambiance was great - they have really done a lot to turn that small, mid-century building in to a hip downtown food spot. I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Went here for appetizers and drinks last night with my hubby and my bestie. Since the bestie had been there before, we asked for his guidance. He highly recommended the crispy wings.    First things first, I ordered 3 \"Surprise Me\" drinks (yes, they were all for me. no I didn't order all 3 at once...stop judging) while my boys drank beers.  Each mystery drink was more delicious than the last. I was very pleased.  We ordered: Canh Ga Chien (Wings) w/ the fish sauce reduction, Tom Chien (Saigon) fresh spring roll,  Ca Thu (Tuna) fresh spring roll, Cua (Crab) crispy spring roll, and the Bo Luc Lac (Shaking Beef) entree.   The BEST was the crab crispy spring roll which comes with mint and lettuce. I also got a side of the peanut hoisin sauce (phenomenal!) I wish it was bigger...because I could probably eat 6 or 7 of those.  Everything was very tasty. The sauce that the wings come in/with is incredible. I don't even think the wings needed to be there.   The fresh spring rolls were very good, but difficult to share amongst 3 people (they come in 2 LARGE pieces). I cut them with the butter knife provided at the table, but my share ended up looking more like a salad than a spring roll. But it didn't matter, it was still delicious."}
{"text":"This visit was deff a 5 star!  Got the banh mi, and it was amazing!  For anyone who has never tried it, its a Vietnamese sandwich served on a baguette.  It is an absolute must, especially on the days it's too hot to eat pho.    Service was awesome - Esteban is super friendly and cool.  Once again, I had a great visit with excellent food and drinks and will return soon!"}
{"text":"Ridiculously overpriced. OK I get they are hip and modern but banh mi sandwiches typically range from 3-5 bucks! I bought one for 8 dollars....why?? I get that there aren't much places around that make them, but that is cruel and unusual punishment just to be able to have one. I haven't even tried it but I really do hope it's the BEST banh mi I've ever tasted. It certainly is the most expensive I've ever paid for one."}
{"text":"Best pho soup I ever had! It's a bit expensive but totally worth it! The crab rolls are so delicious as well! Seriously, don't hesitate coming here just do it! You'll absolutely love it! The staff is amazing as well!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch, based on various reviews of the place. My waiter/waitress seemed distracted. The place is small, but well kept, and seemed very busy. There's some outdoor seating, with coverings to provide shade from the Arizona sun.   I sat outside and ordered the beef pho. The chicken pho that arrived a bit later was a generous portion of pho, with very large chunks of chicken. I thought about sending it back, but decided chicken would be a nice change of pace. The broth was OK. Not super, but decent. There was some chopped scallions in it, and a generous portion of noodles, which were slightly overdone.  I added some fresh basil and bean sprouts (both provided as usual on the side), and also added a dollop of both the dark and light red chili paste, and several of Sriracha, which they don't serve in the bottle, but in one of the same style dish as the chili paste. But even with all that, it wasn't at all spicy. Got a little warm, but then I was sitting out in Arizona on a 95+ degree F afternoon.  Not the best pho experience, but OK."}
{"text":"The lemon chicken was super good and it came with garlic noodles, my favorite!! The spring rolls were ok and pho was good as well."}
{"text":"Fireracker Shrimp + Garlic Noodles + IPA = The Perfect Meal  Great happy hour!"}
{"text":"I was so excited to see a hip Vietnamese place open (no MORE dirty tables and bad service when I feel like Vietnamese food).  This place has been bookmarked on my Yelp for months now.  M and I got there we were seated in the house but in the near the front door (a lot of flies and a bee visited us during our lunch).  I like the decor and the CLEAN look.  =)  We order a ton of food:  Crispy Tofu (Tossed is salt and pepper seasoning served with peanut hoisin) - Those little fried tofu squares were piping HOT!!  I liked the sauce with it.  YUM!  Crispy Spring Rolls with Pork (Minced pork, carrots, onions, saifun noodles, and mushrooms served with Vietnamese vinaigrette dip) -  These are the long, very skinny, and crispy.  The taste was not really there or maybe it is so skinny I could not taste the flavors.  The Vietnamese vinaigrette dip (AKA fish sauce) was too sweet not enough fish flavor.    Chicken Noodle Soup Pho (Chicken Breast) - Loved the soup base flavor but the soup was not HOT enough.  The chicken and pho was good.  Saigon Salad with grilled pork (Rice vermicelli with shredded lettuce, sprouts, cucumbers, mint, crispy shallots, and peanuts in a Vietnamese vinaigrette dressing) - The pork was too dry and not flavorful.  Not enough noodles.  All the other ingredients were ok.  We know this is Americanized Vietnamese food so we weren't look for authenticity or anything but great and very flavorful food."}
{"text":"90-ish year old small house turned into a wonderfully inviting small restaurant.  We weren't too hungry so shared 3 appetizers - a smoked salmon spring roll, firecracker shrimp and crispy calamari, and finished sharing a ginger creme brulee.  Everything delicious - even the geezers sitting at the next table cackling over an Arpaio-inspired silent auction of pink underwear while we watched Ireland and Estonia square off in a soccer match from the bar.  Only in a city.  It's nice that downtown is starting to feel like one."}
{"text":"I frequent Rice Paper for lunch.  The food is awesome and the staff and owner are friendly and helpful. My favorites are firecracker shrimp, garlic noodles and their crab rolls are delicious.  A friend of mine loves their giant bowl of Pho. I have a tradition that when we introduce a new diner to RP we end our lunch with a vodka soaked lychee.  I love Rice Paper and am sure you will love it too."}
{"text":"Nice small intimate location.  Come for the happy hour drinks and appetizers.  The spring rolls are great.  The pork entree I had was a little dry, but the broth it was it was perfect.  Staff is friendly, great date night place.  One detractor, there is little lighting in the parking in back, a little spooky."}
{"text":"Rice Paper is a cute little cafe off 7th Street.  The restaurant is super tiny, so parking is a challenge!    The service is with a smile; the servers are usually very friendly.  I have dined in and ordered to-go food.  The pho is good but not the best, if you usually go to Vietnamese restaurants."}
{"text":"Too small seating is weird but food was great. The ship here so bomb love the ship and the alcohol drinks"}
{"text":"My wife and I have been coming to Rice Paper since they opened.  We have never been disappointed with the food, sometimes the service, but that seems to have been handled as of lately.  Vietnamese restaurants get a bad wrap for being dirty or unkempt, Rice Paper breaks that mold and provides a clean, sleek and modern feel.  I would definitely recommend the wings with the fish sauce reduction, a different taste and probably some of the most flavorful nontraditional wings I've tasted.  You will not be disappointed with any of the Banh Mi's, and the Pho's are very tasty as well.  What they are famous for is in their name, spring rolls rolled in rice paper.  I enjoy the Spicy Asian and the Spider, but try them all, or a couple at a time.  The fried pork spring rolls are our favorite as well as the fire cracker shrimp.    Parking can be limited so if your going with a big party maybe think about carpooling.  Happy hour is seven days a week and ends at 6:30.  Give it a try and enjoy."}
{"text":"Well my third visit here and I finally sit to review. Every time seems under par but it has always been someone else's decision to come here. Let's try it again!   The service was friendly and warned us not to sit outside because of a bee situation they apparently have.   Happy hour was $1 off rolls and $2 off apps We got:  Crispy tofu- tasty with the salt sprinkled in top; the dipping sauce for this was the best out of the three we had the whole day. There were two fries in our bowl which points out a lack of attention to detail.    The vegetarian tempura- was full of lettuce with one piece of over cooked chewy asparagus, a smear of avocado and once slice of mango with a miso sauce that was off point.   The enlighten me- was ok and also packed with lettuce. Couldn't find he jicima or avocado  It seemed that the spring rolls were both premade because the bottoms were chewy and dry which made me miss out on my last two bites.   We were going to order another appetizer but the server kinda turned us away from it.   Probably won't be coming back"}
{"text":"Its okay.  the food is good the service ok.  Although I do like their outside porch and dine in area."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to come here ever since it opened and finally my aunt and uncle were willing to try it also.  We came here on a Saturday night around 6:15 (place was half full of people, but keep in mind that this place is TEENY)  Our waiter immediately informs us that we have 15 minutes before happy hour is over so we were happy that he told us so we got a chance to save couple bucks on drinks and spring rolls.  We got a pork, soft shell crab, and some other spring rolls (came in pairs of 2, but humongous so there was enough to share)...we all thought they were delicious so we were getting excited for dinner!  We decided to get the salmon, filet, and chicken entrees, however my salmon was extremely overcooked, the filet was decent, but the chicken came out 10 minutes after my uncle and I got our meals and her chicken was so overcooked that we needed to wash it down with water to get it down our throats. I would say that should not be part of a dining experience. The salmon and chicken did have wonderful flavor, but it was just overcooked sadly. We did inform the waiter and he thanked us. A free dessert would have been exciting, but overall, I was definitely a bit disappointed that I got my hopes up for an out of this world dining experience...I do hope that it was just an OFF night and they do well, because clearly we missed out on other reviewers' amazing experiences."}
{"text":"meh. maybe i got the wrong thing. Everyone loves this place so ignore this review haha"}
{"text":"Thit Heo Nuong is Amazing! Great Happy Hour!"}
{"text":"my friend john and i went to this place just yesterday at 245 and there was one other table sat with two people. the bartender had a bad attitdue the minute we showed up. i asked for a sample of a beer and he rolled his eyes like a little school girl and then brought my sample. we sat for another ten minutes mind you people are showing up and he continues to help them so i walk up to the bar and ask if we could get a drink. he then precedds to yell out why didn't you order it here at the bar meanwhile my friend and i are sitting on the other side of the place. he walks over and i tell him that he is a horrible server and then he precceds to yell. in the meantime this bartender has no right yelling at me to order drinks at the bar when we chose to sit at a table and him rolling his eyes is a bad service. the place was empty. this place isn't even that great but to be treated badly for no reason in the middle of the day when a plave is empty?!. i know this is a low blow but no wonder why the dude works at a hole in the wall at his age as a bartender, he needs an attitude adjusment. place is a joke and so is the bartender."}
{"text":"I was thoroughly impressed with this place! Took me by surprise from the very beginning! I have always wanted to eat here and after dragging my husband, kicking and screaming I did and neither of us regretted it! Where to begin??  The Service: Excellent! When we walked into this place, it was dead (which was worrisome), but our waiter greeted us with a smile and sat us down, explained to us that it was happy hour (double like) and showed us the drink menu and the roll menu. Every question we had about the beverages and food the waiter had an answer and even provided great suggestions!  The Food: So at Rice Paper the apps are $6, highly recommend the Fire Cracker shrimp (especially if you like something with a spicy kick to it). The calamari with the dipping sauce is delicious as well! The rolls are $1 off and we ate the Spicy Asian, Surf n Turf and the Salmon roll which were all delicious! We also had the chicken noodle pho to top everything off and that was yummy, the broth was really really good!   The ambiance rocks, love how the place is decorated, very warm, inviting, and modern. My husband and I are definitely returning to this place!!"}
{"text":"It was completely slammed while we were there but the service wasn't bad considering.  As is the case with most restaurants converted from old homes, the accoustics were awful and it was very hard to carry on a conversation.  However, the food was excellent!  I ordered a tofu and mushroom banh mi and it was so flavorful and full of different textures that it was just amazing.  Everyone I was with really enjoyed their food.  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I am ecstatic about Rice Paper. Finally, a place near downtown that serves Vietnamese spring rolls, pho, noodles and sandwiches with a bar as well. It is not a hole-in-the-wall type of establishment like some of those Vietnamese restaurants on the west side that you get hustled in and out before you know it. Yes, those places are utilitarian, authentic and cheap but they are not FUN to eat or be at for more than 20 minutes. Rice Paper is place to meet up with friends, have a few drinks, sample various delicious menu items and just hang out. The structure it is in has been attractively renovated and designed in an old bungalow, clean, modern yet warm so you feel inclined to sit and enjoy the atmosphere.  The menu at Rice Paper is sushi style in that you are given it with a pencil and check off the items you want. If you go with a few people, you can mix and match the different items and have a Vietnamese meal tapas-style which I love because I enjoy the variety. The items I have tasted (a few of the spring rolls, the garlic noodles, shrimp appetizer, salad) were all fresh, prepared immediately after I ordered them and tasted delicious. The prices are not dirt cheap but reasonable as are the beverages. The servers and hostess were very hospitable, helpful and cared about the needs of their patrons. The food was brought out in a timely fashion (not rushed but not slow). I have been there twice in the 10 days since it has opened and am surprised at how functionally operational Rice Paper is and doesn't seem to be filled with the typical glitches that new restaurants have.  The decor at Rice Paper is modern and clean (like the food). It is small and if what I see there continues, it won't be easy getting a table there during the lunch rush or weekend evenings. But I am absolutely thrilled to have Rice Paper to frequent, hopefully for a long time to come."}
{"text":"More like a 2.5 I guess...  Very cute hipster ambiance. Loved that. But be prepared to get cozy with total strangers. It is a very tight space.  Also there is very limited parking. If you have a larger car/ truck/SUV, don't even try.  I ordered the chicken pho and traditional spring roll. The food left a lot to be desired. When I go to a Vietnamese place for the first time, I see if they can nail the basics before I venture to the other items on the menu. I'd say this place is catering to an American palate, so I thought it was bland and not as well executed as I thought it should be.  I thought $15 was expensive for what I got. I can pay $6.95 for some seriously good authentic pho at that hole in the wall place across from MCC, but hey, I guess you pay extra for the atmosphere and location (just don't expect the food quality to match the price point).  Service could be better. I wanted to order another drink mid meal and try a desert but was never asked if I wanted anything else. The servers were rushed and it was difficult to get their attention.  So all in all, it's not great, it's not terrible. I'd probably return for a happy hour, otherwise I'll stick to the authentic places."}
{"text":"I love Rice Paper. The wait staff is great, super-friendly.  The food?  STELLAR. So,  speaking of, the chicken pho is my personal fave, but my fiancé has had their filet mignon one and also a pork sandwich, both of which he loved.  The spring rolls are so incredibly yummy, but you only get one per order.  So,  maybe order them during happy hour instead since they're like $4.75 regularly.  :) You won't be disappointed!  Oh,  and Rice Paper is a small,  historic home.  So,  look closely,  or you'll miss it.  The sign is simple and easy-to-read!"}
{"text":"One of the best if not the bet Pho I've had so far. I also ordered the Lemongrass chicken which was spectacular...great green tea as well. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Being in the mood for a Vietnamese  and wanting to try somethings out of our usual zip codes, Peg and I made the maiden voyage to this wonderful mom and pop  (actually, sis and sis) restaurant on Saturday. Being in the mood to try different things, we noshed our way through the Crispy Calamari/Muc Chien Don,  Fire Cracker Shrimp/Tom Chien Don, continuing with tasty fresh spring rolls (Tuna/Ca Thu, Spider/Cua Chien, and  Chicken/Ga Nuong) . The freshness is palpable! We split one of their luscious salads (Saigon/Bun - Rice vermicelli with shredded lettuce, sprouts, cucumbers, mint, crispy shallots, and peanuts in a Vietnamese vinaigrette dressing with shitake mushrooms and chose grilled pork with it).  Sarah was our server and was an absolute delight. My addiction to  iced tea can be a challenge to some servers, but not to the attentive people here. While likely a destination stop for a lot of diners, this place is worth the drive!   Dr. B"}
{"text":"Really good, healthy food.  Owner is super friendly. Would definitely recommend. :)"}
{"text":"This place is so amazing! My pho is veggie, no meat broth  and is so cute and the staff is awesome. When I come back to Phoenix I will come here again!"}
{"text":"I walked into Rice Paper one day and was astounded at the community-feeling that overwhelmed me. At least 8 friendly people were laughing and chatting while sitting at the bar while the rest of the small space remained vacant.  One of the owners walked over and greeted me with a big smile and handed me a  menu I could take home to mull over.   I came back a week later to a jam-packed restaurant. The servers were utilizing their agility and quick speeds to be as attentive-as-possible on a busy Saturday night. I was seated right away, surprisingly enough, and started off with their sake-- a lemongrass and coconut blend that both smelled and tasted intoxicating! I don't often drink my sake like juice, so I had to be careful with this one!  Meh: I ordered two fresh seafood spring rolls: One shrimp and the other was the spider. To only receive one per order is a bit disappointing. However, the ingredients are really fresh. The hoisin sauce, as others have pointed out, is what the sauce resembles--moreso than peanut (as claimed). As a lover of peanut sauce, I was also slightly disappointed here. My friend ordered the ahi tuna salad and complained that the salad was lacking much flavor.   Yay: Onto the meal! I ordered the Curry Tofu and wanted to make babies with it. Good tofu is hard to find (like a man). The crispness stands out and really soaks up the flavor. It's an amazing blend of fresh stir fry veggies and the curry is light and flavorful, with the perfect blend of sweet and filled with spice, but not too spicy! Just how I like my relationships...  I'll be back to try their pho soon!"}
{"text":"the one star is for the atmosphere.  i had a very similar experience as Sally M.  ordered the chicken saigon bun and the meat smelled ROTTEN. i had the server take it back and switch the chicken with pork. the pork was under cooked and fatty. sadly, they still charged for the dish. i ended up with an aching tummy all nite and bad case of d. if u want me to make a recommendation, go to any of the standard dive-y vietnamese restaurants."}
{"text":"Great little place! Not sure why people keep ripping on the staff for service, we had great service and the food was amazing. We will definitely be frequenting rice paper from here on out.   I would definitely recommend the pho mignon. The meat was extremely tender and perfectly prepared. Excellent flavor overall."}
{"text":"Just writing a quick one to say, \"Stop taking down a restaurant that just opened with nit picky and whiny reviews.\"  Rice Paper does a good job of serving Vietnamese favorites in a fun, hip environment.   The thing that is 5 stars about this place is that they serve quality sandwiches.  Theirs are better than all of the other (like 3) that I've tried in Phoenix.  Celebrate the Bahn Mi, the best sandwich in the world."}
{"text":"I was disappointed that this place lived up to the hype of trendy restaurants. Trends don't usually last long."}
{"text":"Was trying to decide where to go to lunch with a friend and I recited a list of close places (courtesy of the Yelp app of course). I named Rice Paper and he immediately said let's go. He had tried on two different occasions and couldn't find parking. So he left without going in.  This was possibly his chance and I always up for a new Vietnamese joint.   When we got there just after 11 am, there were a few spots available. It is a small place and the main dining area was fairly packed. So we chose the front room that had no one else in it.   Service was average. The hostess (?) was pleasant. Our server was not pleasant, not unpleasant. He was simply there. For some reason he continually walked into the front room, looked straight at the for door for a few seconds and would walk back.  So there and a bit strange.   The menu is not truly Vietnamese. It's the way I envision P.F. Chang's would develop an urban hipster Vietnamese place. I went with a chicken sandwich. Frankly I was hit with sticker shock when I saw the $8 price. I'm used to $4 sandwiches from the more \"traditional\" places. And to through in a plot twist I went with the staple of Vietnamese side dishes, garlic fries.  BUT, I must say that the food was very good. The sandwich was over twice the size of the $4 snack sandwiches I was used to and they actually put a decent amount of chicken in it. The jalapeños were fresh. The garlic fries were fantastic. The best I have had. They weren't soggy like most places. They were crispy without an overpowering amount of garlic. A+ for the food.   So overall the food is fantastic, but the parking (it took us a while to maneuver out way out after some creative parking from others) and service aren't. I may also be biased by what I perceive to be an attempt by restaurant owners to create buzz by setting up shop in tiny downtown houses with inadequate parking. You know that whole Yogism, \"No one goes there anymore, it's too crowded.\""}
{"text":"Finally, a Vietnamese place that gets pretty close to Pho Avina's. This is a first!  Went here with a friend for lunch Sunday and really loved it. The menu items were decently-priced and service was snappy. I started with a spring roll. It was quite large and unlike many Vietnamese places, not at all dry, sticky or flavorless. The peanut sauce was perfect! I had some type of pork salad as my entree (I can't recall the name!) and it was very tasty as well. Serving size was quite large and the dressing was very good. The pork was cooked perfectly with a nice crisp to it. Overall, VERY satisfied and pleased to finally find a Vietnamese place near me that isn't mediocre.  Only tiny complaint is I didn't care for the bathroom setup. Seemed overly hipster-ish and pointless. Sinks were separate from the bathroom and in the open. Kinda awkward? There was a chair and 3 cushions in the bathroom...in case I wanted to sit down and watch someone? Lol."}
{"text":"Cute little spot. Came here twice for lunch and dinner. The first time was for dinner it was great. We ordered Pho and springrolls . Both were delicious. Came back for lunch and ordered vermicelli.  The fishsauce wasn't great.   It was plain fish sauce straight from the bottle. I'm not sure if I came in at the wrong time."}
{"text":"I went with a friend today for lunch. We each ordered a spring roll and a sandwich. Then we waited. And waited. Then waited some more. The waiter was very nice and apologized for the wait. We finally got our spring rolls and were very happy. By this time we had been there for about 40 minutes. As we were finishing our rolls our waiter came to our table and announced that the kitchen had run out of the bread for our sandwiches. Really? The kitchen didn't know that when we put in our order 40 minutes before. He asked if we wanted to order something else but by this point we had no time to wait another 40 minutes. Hungry and disappointed we explained we had no time for a new order to be started. He again apologized, and then had the gall to present us with the check for our two spring rolls!!  I think with this kind of customer service this place is not going to be around long. Too bad."}
{"text":"The location, perfectly poised patio and converted-house-into-restaurant earn definite points. Their food is good and it's not too pricey. I have had the pho, Vietnamese sandwiches, and spring rolls. The Vegetarian Tempura roll is delicious and is made with such fun accents as tempura asparagus (who knew) and mango. Mango anything is an automatic win in my book. The sandwiches come with a side of salad, sweet potato or garlic fries and you have the option to order a half pho if you don't feel like ingesting a kiddie pool's worth of soup. There are times when copious amounts of soup are definitely welcome but it's nice to have the option. The chicken Vietnamese sandwich was savory and not too big. Parking is not always easiest though they do have an overflow lot a little ways down on 7th Street. They lost points for having some notably aggressive flies in the windows by our table. I hate flies."}
{"text":"I went to Rice Paper last night for a friends birthday dinner and we had a great time!!  Happy hour was still going on, which was a nice surprise to us!  We took advantage of the deal and ordered a bunch of spring rolls and apps-yummy! Drinks were really good too, hand crafted by the bar tender!  He even gave us a birthday round of sake bombs on the house.  David was our waiter and had lots of great recommendations.  I am planning to bring my husband back to try the pho!     Two reasons why I didn't give them 5 stars: parking is extremely limited and they only have one dessert available per season and I like choices!"}
{"text":"Fist time to Rice Paper today.  The broth is good!  We sampled an assortment of Spring rolls; Buddha, Tuna, & Traditional which were fresh, good sized rolls.  Along with those, the fried crab wontons rolls.  Pho tai was tasty well balanced with meat, noodles and broth. The Thai basil, bean sprouts, limes, & mint were all very fresh. I presume they grow the herbs themselves.  They have a Grandma sauce which is ground chili in oil with garlic. It is spicy and flavorful.  A tip: they have \"happy hour\" & the drinks are very affordable. They also take a dollar off the appetizers and spring rolls which are similar to a sushi/tapas menu allowing you to try a variety of rolls. The service was friendly and prompt. In all it was a great meal with good value and decent service.  I will be back!"}
{"text":"Good salad rolls and a very cozy, trendy vietnamese restaurant.  Just not that blown away with the menu options."}
{"text":"This place is over priced and under sized. The wait staff doesn't seem to know what a Pho restaurant is.  I was in a hurry, so I sat at the bar and gave my entire order. The waiter goes into the kitchen comes back and starts texting and chatting with me. Fifteen minutes later, neither my appetizer or Pho had arrived. I asked what was going on and that I had a time limit. He went back in the kitchen then came back out, punched in my order. I'm sitting three feet from the screen, I can see. The waiter told me the food runner took the food to another table. There was only one other couple there and they had already eaten  no food came out of the kitchen, it's a small restaurant I can see. The cook comes out of the kitchen and prepares my spring roll. Start to finish my spring roll took three minutes. I ate the roll and it was ok.  45 minutes after I ordered my pho had not arrived. Any other pho restaurant, all your food is ready in ten minutes or less. I told the guy I need to leave soon, he tells me that the cook is cooking the steak. IDIOT ALERT!! You serve the steak sliced and raw in hot broth. I had had enough. I was late. I dropped $10 for ONE ROLL and told the waiter that I was leaving for a movie. He said that he could make the order to go. I told him I couldn't take it because of the movie and left.  The worst part. I was told very loudly, \"Don't come back\". Don't worry, I'm not."}
{"text":"I am never one to write a review, but as a restaurant industry professional and one who frequents restaurants in the valley I feel I had to share my comments.   First, I must say that I live in the downtown area and support my local restaurants and local owed owed establishments. I am also a lover Viatenemse food so I was so happy when Rice Paper opened a couple years back. I must say however, that the food is okay but the service is horrible. The last couple of times I have been there the same guy seems to be running the place. I never see a manager, but maybe the young red headed bartender in charge?  Drinking while he is working (yes I saw him downing a beer), taking way to many tables, and the slowest service ever had; wondering who is in charge? Also, wondering if the owners know what is happening?  I write this cause I really want to see this place succeed, as I could be a huge fan. Please get some better service in place!"}
{"text":"Started with the spicy edamame and fresh spring rolls,  selected from a variety of fresh and fried spring roll choices. We had the pho Tai and shaking beef, and would return again for more.  Happy Hour until 6:30 means good prices on drinks and food."}
{"text":"Advice to the owner: Creativity in your food is something that a lot of chef's aspire towards, but not a lot are able to execute. Case in point? Rice paper.  All of the staple food items are absolutely phenomenal. This includes the Pho, Firecracker Shrimp (addictive!) and most of the rolls. Here's where things get weird...  There was a roll I ordered (called the Buddha) that had the most foul smelling mushrooms I have ever eaten. I couldn't get through one bite without feeling nauseous. As a vegetarian, I have to put up with a lot of mushroom and strangely interesting food, but this took the cake. So bad tasting, I sent it back and ordered the other vegetarian roll (tempure asparagus) whick rocked.  The lady next to me attempted to also step outside her boundaries, ordered a jalapeno drink that was meant to have a tiny hint of spice. She couldn't get through one sip without her throat burning, and I could smell the peppers in her supposedly \"sweet\" margarita drink from my table.  So, stick with what you know and what you're good at, and keep the \"culinary concoctions\" off the menu."}
{"text":"This place was okay. The service wasn't very good at all so I won't be coming back. It took more than 10 minutes to get drinks and all we ordered was water."}
{"text":"I got two types of spring rolls here: tofu and shrimp. Delicious! However the peanut sauce was disappointing so I round it to 3.5 stars.  I do want to come back and try some different things on the menu, then I'll reconsider my rating."}
{"text":"Creative ideas as well as delicious! Spring rolls are so good especially the non traditional ones, such as soft shell crab. The appetizer shrimp fire cracker is also good especially the sauce. Last but not least you should save room for dessert, ginger cream brûlée. Yummy!"}
{"text":"This is clearly a very \"beginner friendlly\" Vietnamese restaurant. The ambiance was excellent (an old, renovated house that was decorated nicely). The service was pretty good (young college-aged people).  If you're going to charge premium prices ($9-$15) for traditional Vietnamese fare (pho, grilled steak with rice, egg rolls), at least spice it up with premium ingredients.  I was hijacked for $7 on egg rolls, for what arrived as two egg rolls sliced diagonally in an attempt to substitute presentation for value. Typically for $5-$6, you get 5-6 egg rolls. The ingredients \ end product I received was nothing special.  The pho was mediocre at best. The noodles were fresh, the beef (all 4 pieces of it) was pretty thick. The broth was lackluster. The bowl it was served in was definitely nice. For the $9 it cost, it was definitely lacking in both volume and quality.  If you are looking for an intimate, seemingly adventurous place to take a date, this place would be decent. If you're looking for authentic, delicious Vietnamese place, it should be a last resort."}
{"text":"Good staff. The ice tea and iced coffee were very good. The spring rolls were lacking. Was there in the late lunch time and it was quiet. Not my cup of tea."}
{"text":"I just moved to the area & this place is a Great Little Spot. Very quaint & cute. We had both fried & fresh pork spring rolls & the beef sliced pho. DELICIOUS. Our waitress Ashley was extremely nice as well. Definitely a place I will be returning to."}
{"text":"I had a date on a Saturday night in September and I choose this restaurant. The food was light and very flavorful, the waitstaff were nice and polite, and the decor was pleasing and calm. Parking is limited because they share a lot with a family next door? I didn't have problems finding parking but my date had to move his truck. Great spot to sit, eat, and have conversation!"}
{"text":"I was excited when Rice Paper opened in my neighborhood, notably because my boyfriend and I are huge Pho fans. This quaint little eatery did not disappoint on its most-popular dish. The beef broth was flavorful, the side veggies crisp and the thin slices of beef melt in your mouth.  The Pho here is a bit more pricey than other Vietnamese places I've been to in Tempe or throughout the Valley, however, the quality makes it worth it. A couple could easily share one order of Pho and some spring rolls and be satisfied.  Where my disappointment set in was with the curry tofu dish. I realize the Vietnamese aren't known for curry, but I was expecting a bit more based on the delicious-tasting spring roll I had just enjoyed. The tofu was dry and the curry lacked depth, overpowered by spices.  Service gets an A-. Waiter was great, but a bit pushy on menu items."}
{"text":"This restaurant is cute and I loved the ambience here. However, having been to other Vietnamese places, I would say that the food here is definitely over-priced.   First of all, there are very few items on the menu(entrees). We had the salmon spring roll for starters which was good, but not great. The accompanying hoisin sauce didn't complement the salmon well.  For entrees we had their caramelized salmon and the lemongrass chicken. The salmon, served with white rice was passable, I just wish it had been a bit more spicy. The lemongrass chicken was the best among the two. The chicken was cooked okay and went well with the garlic noodles.  For desert, they served us the ginger creme brulee(more like flan with caramelized ginger coating on the top). This was worth tasting as I had never had ginger creme brulee before.  I wouldn't come here again if I had other better options. Maybe I would give this place another try if they included more choices on the menu and decreased the prices. I didn't feel that the meal was worth every penny.   I would give this place 4 stars for the calm ambience, and 3 stars for the food. The service was okay, not that great."}
{"text":"I love this place...aside from the service and the poor air conditioning in the summer. The firecracker shrimp is AMAZING! I really like the Pho. The portions are large and very filling."}
{"text":"I can't believe some of the things I've been seeing people NAG about in their reviews for this new restaurant! I set my standards pretty high for Rice Paper and they did not disappoint!   I took my wife on a date here last night because she really loves beef pho, and had been waiting for this place to open up! The atmosphere was very bright and welcoming, as well was our server! He sat down with us and quickly went over what was good and what was popular with most patrons so far. We took him up on a few of his suggestions and started with the fried calamari. I'm not sure what they bread it with but it was delicious, and the squid was perfect; not too soft, not too chewy!  For our main course I ordered the Shaking Beef, which was cubed filet mignon served over onions on a sizzling platter in a special sauce, with a side of rice and grilled zuchinni... again on the suggestion of my server! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND! My wife got the beef pho... at first I was a bit iffy on it because the broth looked very clear as if it were going to be somewhat watery... but it was VERY well seasoned! Our server told us that the broth stews for at least 12 hours allowing it to achieve the best flavor from the pho spices! VERY IMPRESSED!   Yes, it is much pricier than your average pho joint, but I'd rather pay a bit extra for a nice, clean and slightly upscale atmosphere! And the quality of the food is MUCH higher than the mystery meat you'll get in your bowl of pho at some other places!   Well done Rice Paper, we WILL be back!"}
{"text":"Rice Paper is a modern, trendy take on Vietnamese cuisine. On the outside, it doesn't look like a restaurant at all - mostly because it is actually a renovated house. On the inside, it was an intimate restaurant space with a full bar, complete with a big dispenser of lychee vodka on the counter. It's mostly filled with tables for two, so you'd probably have to make a reservation if you wanted to bring in a large party. However, the atmosphere is great, somehow fusing modern and rustic. It really is a fashionable place - being served water with a slice of cucumber is one of your first indicators.  I would have liked to try their pho, but I only had room for a snack. I really wanted to try their specialty rice paper rolls. These are expensive snacks, though. The rolls are $3.75-4.75 each. I had two: Tuna (seared ahi, jicama, avocado, mango) and Spider (tempura soft shell crab, mango, avocado). At least they're pretty big (thank goodness).  Both rolls were nicely presented and come with a ginger-miso dipping sauce, which was delicious. The saltiness of the miso was complemented by tart and sweet flavors, but I think using too much sauce would be overwhelming. The rolls were fresh and unique, with the mango offering a tart freshness I'd never experienced in a summer roll. The tuna was by far the better choice, since it wasn't as salty as the spider and had a nice crunch from the jicama. The crab's flavor was a little lost in the tempura batter, I think. And I wished that the rolls were prepared a little tighter because they were falling apart as I ate them. Quite a bit of the shredded lettuce fell out, and I had to look around furtively wondering if anyone realized what a hot mess I was.  I also sampled the pho broth to get an idea of what an actual pho experience here would be like. It was noteworthy because it was nice and clear, but somehow tasted a little heavy. Actually, maybe \"rich\" is a more accurate descriptor, along with \"savory\" and \"meaty.\" I guess I'd give it 4 out of 5.  I was resolved to ask some questions of Rice Paper's (non-Asian) staff. It's been open for two years now, and the owner is a Vietnamese lady from my hometown, San Diego. How about that? Apparently, she had a successful shop in San Diego which she sold before moving to Phoenix. She also owns Bonjour Vietnam, a French-infused contemporary Vietnamese restaurant attached to the famous Hotel San Carlos. I was only a little wishful that I'd stopped by there instead, as my Rice Paper experience was enjoyable.  $10.29 for two summer rolls though? Yikes. I thought, In what world? Is this the future we're heading toward?  Read more about my phoventures at www.phoacrossamerica.com"}
{"text":"Best Vietnamese food I've had in years!! Totally legit.  Tons of selection on springs rolls, pho, and entrees - the firecracker shrimp were awesome and loved the fresh spring rolls.   We sat at the counter and I tried one of the house made vodka infused cherries - whew, that'll put hair on your chest ladies and gentlemen! This isn't a large restaurant, I don't really see how they can accommodate parties of more than 4, but maybe I missed something.   Definitely worth going to - I wish we had this place in San Diego!"}
{"text":"I love pho. I am a self proclaimed pho-natic. I love eating lunch. Lunching is good. I lunch here at Rice Paper regularly. This review is bound to suck hog balls. I like Rice Paper. It is an upscale, americanized, hipsteresq version of Vietnamese dining. The phood is yummy. I have tried lots on the menu. The servers are cute, and nice. Both the boys and the girls.  They take as long as most hipster eateries do. Uh yeah, so expect a bit of a wait. To be seated, to have your order taken, to be served. I don't know what it is. Even when the place is only moderately full, there is a wait. I can't complain about the grub though. It's not bad, not the best Vietnamese I've ever had, but I wouldn't turn my nose up at it either. Get it... Rice Paper, because, Vietnamese... Ha."}
{"text":"This place has a fun atmosphere and a big selection of spring rolls (which are very tasty!)  The food is pricey compared to other Vietnamese restaurants in the valley - pho is almost twice the cost but it tastes good and the meat is very lean, whereas the other places tend to have a good bit of gristle.  They were also nice enough to split a bowl for us since we were sharing a various selection of things off the menu.  I stuck with a 3 star rating because I did not have a good service experience and also because, like I said, it's quite pricey.  But, I do recommend trying this place out, it's something a little different and we enjoyed our food :)"}
{"text":"If I could give it zero stars, I would.   I don't like writing negative reviews, but this deserves one.   One of my co-worker recommended this place to me so me and my boyfriend decided to give it a try. We were having one of those lazy Saturday evenings watching DVDs and thought it would be great to do take out at this place. WE WERE WRONG!  When I called in the make the order the manager answered. Before I could ask what the total was, he hung up the phone on me. (+_+)?    What we ordered 1. Shaking beef 2. Ahi summer roll  3. Buddha spring roll 4. Rock shrimp   Boyfriend went inside to pick up the food. He said the manager pretty much grabbed the containers in a plastic bag and tossed it on the bar and walked away. There was no \"thank you for your business\" type attitude. All after he paid 10% tip for take out...  I wish he never gave him that tip!!!  When we opened the bags there was no spring rolls! I called and notified him but he simply said \"nopeeee. That's so weird. I put it in myself\"  Well, dear mister manager, If you put spring rolls in my bag, we wouldn't be having this conversation! I mean why would I lie about  not having spring roll?   He just said he can't do anything and he'll give me free rolls next time... No apology, nothing.   Look, I don't want free rolls. I just want the one I paid for.    the food itself was mediocre. Horrible experience. Never going back!"}
{"text":"Mouths will water at Rice Paper. The restaurant thrives on it's mastery of adding unique twists to traditional Vietnamese dishes to create quality, specialty dishes.  Rice Paper's menu offers an array of delicious noshes catering to all eaters, carnivores and vegans alike. The house-turned-restaurant offers comfortable seating outside at lounges and long tables or at high tops and tables inside. The restaurant is fairly small and dimly lit for a trendy, modern feel. It is a perfect place for a romantic date or group dinner party.  Start off the night with one of Rice Paper's signature cocktails with lychee-infused vodka or a seasonal craft beer on tap. Pair drinks with one or two of the 17 different types of spring rolls, deep-fried or wrapped in rice paper. Meat lovers will also love the crispy chicken wings battered in a fish sauce reduction for an appetizer.  The main course is the real deal. Bypass the banh mi sandwich (Vietnamese style cold cuts served in French baguettes) and Pho (traditional Vietnamese broth with vegetables and meatt) and go straight for the good stuff.   Order the firecracker shrimp from the appetizer menu and the garlic noodles from the side dishes. The server will know exactly what you are talking about and will combine the two upon request.  Don't let the \"appetizer\" and \"side dish\" titles confuse you, this is a large portion of food that will leave you feeling fully satisfied. Smaller appetites should consider splitting this dish and getting a couple of spring rolls along side.  The firecracker shrimp and garlic noodles combo has become my Rice Paper creed and to be frank, there is just no point in going to the restaurant and not ordering these two dishes.   The shrimp is plump and juicy on the inside, while the crackling battered skin on the outside offers the most satisfying crunch when you bite into it. It is covered in a delicious, tangy, creamy sauce with a sprinkling of black and white sesame seeds. Then, the shrimp is topped off with a boost of slivers of iceberg lettuce to give it that extra freshness and crunch.  This dish, combined with the garlic noodles is absolutely divine. The thinly tangled noodles ooze with a buttery warmth and garlicky goodness. Swivel the noodles up with your chopsticks and pick up a shrimp to assemble the perfect bite.   Let your taste buds tingle with excitement as they take in foodie sensation heaven, exactly what you've been wanting and the perfect way to end the week. Wait about 20-30 seconds before you take your next bite to really savor the moment.   Additional Details: Parking can be limiting so consider carpooling if you plan to go with a big party. Happy hour is seven days a week 11a.m. until 6 p.m."}
{"text":"This is a very typical American Vietnamese restaurant.   Pro's: The decorations are charming.  Service was nice. Cons: Overpriced and below average food quality.  I ordered the Salmon and Cream Cheese roll as an appetizer and we ordered the Salmon and Sizzling Beef dish as entrees.  The appetizer is far better than the main entree yet lacked flavor.  I order my beef medium and it came out on a sizzling platter and looked very appetizing. To my dismay, the beef was extremely tough and not very flavorful and the Salmon is a bit pungent."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely fantastic. The menu is blossoming with beautifully executed meals including jaw dropping mouth watering appetizers. I actually go for the appetizers almost every time. The serving sizes are very generous and the food is fresh. My favorite are the spring roles. I've never had one before coming here and I'm addicted. This is my secret spot I share with my mother. One of my favorite places hands down. Only down fall is the restrooms and the small size of the restaurant but it is more then worth it. I will eat here as long as I'm breathing and need food. If I could give 10 stars I would."}
{"text":"I've had the chance to try several dishes at Rice Paper, with mixed results, but overall this place has solid food and is an overall good experience.  On my first visit, I tried the caramelized salmon in a clay pot.  OMG if I had reviewed this place after that one dish I would have given them 10 stars.  The salmon was cooked perfectly (not overcooked like so many places do) and I wanted to lick the sweet reduction right out of the pot.  I also tried a few of the many choices of spring rolls and, to be honest, I don't think you could go wrong with any of them.  On my last visit, I tried the braised pork banh mi (sandwich).  It was disappointingly dry and not very flavorful.  The sweet potato fries that came with it were cold.  My friend tried the pho with chicken and liked it, but didn't rave about it.  This trip knocked them down to 4 stars.  The service is attentive, and friendly (even though they messed up my drink order, they fixed it right away).  The interior is small but comfortable and I love the beautiful brick wall behind the bar.    I'll definitely go back.  Maybe I'll try the pho next time."}
{"text":"Awesome!  My first experience of Vietnamese food.  We tried three different rolls... and all three were light and tasty and a cornucopia of flavor.  Ambience is lovely.  The staff was all over us with attention and detailed service. Very friendly as well.    Highly recommend."}
{"text":"YES! This place is LEGIT! Those of you claiming its not authentic....wah-wah. Very delicious food and priced very appropriately. The wifey and I have been in here a couple of times now and have sampled a large section of the menu.   The first time we were in our server referred to the restaurant as \"a spring roll bar\" and all of the spring rolls we have tried have been very good. That miso ginger sauce for dippin is freakin awesome.   The shaking beef might be the most expensive thing on the menu (at $15) but it also might be the most delicious thing I've ever eaten. And while the pho may not be the best in Phoenix, it is easily top 5. Happy Hour pricing is awesome: 2 people, with a cocktail or a beer, and full bellies for less than $30. The food is delicious and the people are very nice.  Definitely check this place out if you're in the area, I know I will continue to come back here."}
{"text":"Came for happy hour after much anticipation to try this place. Ordered a gin cocktail, similar to a mojito but better than most. Also had an Asian Passion cocktail, it was sweet but very tasty. We shared the firecracker shrimp and chicken crispy spring rolls, both very good. I have heard great things about their Pho so I will be back for that. Service was a bit slow as they got busy and they were a bit short staffed but our waitress was nice and offered great suggestions. It is not on the greatest street and parking is a bit sketchy but I would highly recommend Rice Paper!"}
{"text":"I ordered the fire cracker shrimp and the smoked salmon salad.  The shrimp was absolutely amazing; the salad was a bit light on the avocado, but the dressing was on-point and everything else was great. I would recommend this place to just about anyone looking to eat in a casual, cool spot."}
{"text":"I give Rice Paper 2 stars because the food is good. I have been here before, and I don't think I had much of a problem, the wait staff usually acts as if you are a bother but whatever. Tonight was ridiculous. My husband and I ordered appetizers and he got a sandwich and I got the mignon Pho. The spring rolls came out fairly quick and then about 15 minutes later my husband's entree came out. The second appetizer was still not out and neither was my Pho. After about 10 minutes the second appetizer came out. I told my husband to start eating his food or it was going to be cold. 15 minutes later my pho arrives with no spoon Or sauce. The waitress said she would go get me what I needed. I waited about 10 minutes watching her walk around like she had nothing to do and talking with other tables. I ended up going to the bar and asking for what I needed. I was told the spoons were being washed and would be out shortly. Seriously? I finally got a spoon, and my husband was done eating. The worst part is no one even came by to apologize or anything. I'm pretty understanding but when the wait staff acts like the problem isn't happening, it's very rude. I ate my food and it's good for them my husband was paying because if it were me they wouldn't have received a tip."}
{"text":"Highly recommended! Rice Paper is not your hole-in-the-wall type Vietnamese restaurant. Its urban, chic, clean, modern...great for a date, business lunch, or fun with friends. They specialize in hand rolls, not the deep fried kind, but wonderful fresh, light and tasty rice paper concoctions. We tried 3...a seared Ahi Tuna, a Shrimp and asparagus and a tempura soft-shell crab. All delicious. The vodka based Mandarin Ginger Fizz was a worthy cocktail accompaniment. Finished off with a large Ginger Creme Brûlée which was sublime. Happy Hour is from 11 to 6:30 and its very busy at lunch. Fast, friendly service starts when one of the lovely owners greet you on arrival. Most tables are for two but there is a large communal table in the middle for a larger crowd. Nice bar area too."}
{"text":"I think the biggest draw about this place is the creative and tasty expanse of spring rolls that they offer.  If you're looking for real, down and dirty Vietnamese this is not the place.    The place was a cute, converted home on 7th street.  We went on a Saturday night and had some difficulty parking in the small lot but no problem getting a table outside on the patio.  I loved the flower baskets and all the interesting flowers they had on the patio.    They have a decent bar menu and apparently they make their own lychee vodka; my friend ordered the lycheeijito and it was yummy.  We all got banh mi's with grilled or braised pork, which had great flavor.  All of their banh mi's are served with a side of sweet potato or garlic fries, which is very American (obviously) but they were really crispy and yummy."}
{"text":"Really small place, no parking.   I know some people might think a small crammed place is \"cute\" or \"cozy\" but its not.  Anyway the food was just okay.  I honestly don't think it was better than other restaurants with similar menus.  If your in area, perhaps try it but its not worth going out of your for."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been dying to try out this place for awhile since it opened.  Finally went two weeks ago with some friends on a Thursday afternoon.  The restaurant was definitely done on a budget but is very cool !!  Especially like the wok hand sinks!!  We tried 4 or five rice paper rolls, the chicken wings with fish sauce reduction, beef pho, crispy crab rolls, and crispy pork rolls...We enjoyed it all !!    I especially liked the wings!!  Fun place and our server (sorry dude, forgot your name) made our day!  He even stayed after his shift ended to make sure we were taken care of.  He burned the s**t out of his arm serving us the wings and didn't drop it or miss a beat!"}
{"text":"Alright people here's the \"low-down\"... If your easily impressed by a fresh coat of paint... Then good for you. Savor that paint while you chew on this! As for me... If I want ethnic food, I don't want it \"white-washed\"... I came here for authentic Vietnamese spring rolls & pho soup... Pretty main stream for Vietnamese table food. It's way over priced & under portioned for what you get. It's tasteless like a test kitchen gone wrong. Frankly-Francine, its a very clique-ish meeting ground for the gay/lesbian community... That's great but if your straight, your deffinately out numbered here - not balanced (not 1 straight worker in the place)! Back to the food... I recommend King Egg roll in Avondale for a more authentic, volumous (3 full size spring rolls vs. 1 cut in 1/2 here & large bowls of soup... Are large & overflowing with fixings vs. a taste test of the fixings here... Not to mention all for 1/2 the price you'll pay here), less pricey, enjoyable Vietnamese dinning experience at King Eggroll!"}
{"text":"Cute surroundings and atmosphere, well draped in hipster design and high end cocktails, hide the home of the worst pho I have ever had.   We hit up Rice Paper based on a late night craving for pho, and not really knowing the area we had just moved into, we pulled up the Yelp and saw the reviews. We should have walked away when we saw the prices for pho (anything over $7 is a dead giveaway that your in a faux-pho situation), but we were hungry, had literally just moved into a new apartment, and didn't want to keep searching.   One would think that moving hunger makes all food taste that much better. And it does! Which makes the pho I had that much worse. The broth was bland, the noodles haphazardly balled up at the bottom of the bowl, and the umami bomb that I expect from really rich, beautiful pho, was instead a tepid, flaccid cousin of Top Ramen. I take that back. Top Ramen puts this pho to shame. (Is it okay to compare instant Maruchan and pho? Yeah, in this case, I think it's the only fair comparison.)  Being from Seattle, I get that my pho standards are a little high. But dang, at least send your chef out to a real Vietnamese restaurant to get an understanding of what broth should taste like (there are about 6-10 solid pho restaurants in every major hood in Seattle, well worth the trip).   So why 2 stars? Service was decent (my wife had a nasty hair in her pho and it was comped- that wouldn't happen in a pho joint), and the decor was great. But really, that should have been the first warning- no great pho ever came from a gilded cage."}
{"text":"A few weeks ago, we decided to have lunch at Rice Paper.   I've past it a few times before it opened and was looking forward to trying it out.   It's located conveniently on 7th Street North of McDowell.  Parking is in the back and entrance on the side & front.  When we first walked it, it is a charming Old House converted into restaurant.  Not a new concept in Phoenix but it never gets old.  Especially when they get it right.  It's a charming atmosphere with intimate tables and also a long \"Tapas-style\" bar (which is where we sat).  There is also seating up in front facing 7th Street.  It's a nice, clean light colored contemporary  decor.  One side of the main room has a full bar.  Good to know for dinners.  I tried the Chicken Pho and we had the Vietnamese spring rolls.  The Pho was in a huge bowl and it was really tasty!  The rolls were pretty good too.  Service was very attentive and friendly and in fact from more than just our server, everyone seemed pretty nice.     All around I think if you like Vietnamese food, give it a try, I don't think you will be disappointed."}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere  of this place. The service is great to. The food is good but expensive. It seem that ever thing on the menu were rolls which were very good but small. The rolls were individual sides and not very fulling. But they all tasted great. So I would go for appetizer and then somewhere else for dinner."}
{"text":"This place was one of the cleanest places I've eaten at in a long time! It was also pretty darn good! Rice Paper is known for their assorted spring and summer rolls. I really like the soft shell crab roll. We also had the beef cubes...SO good. There's no old dirty oil taste that you get from most Vietnamese places in NYC. Wish they'd open one in NYC!"}
{"text":"Modern setting for Vietnamese however lacked in taste for me.  I went with another yelper for a weekly lunch meet up in Phoenix.  Really nice setting with the wooden tables and flowers on each table.  We were greeted and seated immediately.  We ordered a few dishes.   -Crispy tofu-good, really hot. -Crispy Spring Rolls- these were cut to create long skinny pieces which I think hurts the dish.  The inside gets cold plus the insides fall into the sauce.  Sauce, wasn't great in taste.  I ordered the bun (pronounced bung) with pork.   Usually this dish found in every Vietnamese restaurant is huge and full of noodles with the hot pork on the top.  This on the other hand, had a huge amount of lettuce (not really shredded well, it was a lot of huge pieces), huge chunks of cucumbers, very little noodles, and the pork was cold, full of fat and tough.  And for $10 a plate.  It doesn't live up to the dish's reputation.   I get it that they are probably trying to please a bigger demographic by introducing these dishes to the Downtown and Central foodies, however, it lacked in the tastes.   Thats what makes me want to drag myself and friends to other local Vietnamese restaurants which yes, less attractive decor but the food is what brings me back!  I would recommend on working on the food a bit more and you will have repeat foodies."}
{"text":"I really wanted to give four stars but the waitress was sooo wrong that I just couldn't do it. She is not the kind of server you would expect for a little restaurant like this. She seemed dazed and confused. When our entrees came out before our appetizers she said the kitchen is screwed up. Well, isn't that what waitstaff is for? Hold on to the entree until we get the appetizers. She was also very loud and shrill. Not a good start. Now, for the food: We ordered the shrimp tempura and asparagus roll with ginger sauce that was really outstanding. The traditional rice paper roll was bland and the peanut dipping sauce had a strong chocolate taste. The Ban Mi braised pork sandwich was delicious. Sweet and savory on a perfect french roll. It came with sweet potato fries that were the most perfectly cooked I've ever eaten. The ioli served with it was great. My friend's Bun was fine, but ultimately disappointing considering it it double, that's right, double what it would cost you in most authentic Viet restaurants in town. She ordered hers with chicken (which was unusual), however, it was seasoned very well. Would I go back? Maybe, probably. But if I have a hankering for Vietnamese food, this is not the place to go. But if I do, I will call ahead to ask if the waitress we had is working that day, so I know whether to go or not."}
{"text":"I really want to like this place because it's so close to my house. The pho prices are ridiculous for what you get though. Especially with places like pho thanh and da vang are only a ten minute drive away for half the price. You really are paying for the atmosphere here. The service has been pretty hit miss as well. Both male bartenders I've been served by were very aloof/not friendly. Whenever I've sat at a table I've always gotten great service though. The happy hour isn't too bad. Stick to the spring rolls and fire cracker shrimp. The pho will  leave you disappointed."}
{"text":"I fell in love with Rice Paper the minute I walked in. It is a small historic house converted in to a quaint and hip dining area. There is a large patio in back that I am sure will be heavily used come cooler weather.  Our servers name was Derek and he was funny, attentive and personable even though the place was packed.   The food was amazing, and to name a few favorites:  Firecracker Shrimp - Lightly breaded and tossed in a spicy aioli sauce Enlighten Me Roll - Tofu, asparagus, jalapenos, jicama, crispy rolls, and sriracha served with peanut hoisin sauce Shaking Beef - Holy deliciousness! Fillet mignon seared with soy, garlic, and onions served sizzling with steamed rice that was topped with mushrooms (see pics). Curry Tofu - Tofu, asparagus, shitake mushrooms, baby corn, and onions. We ordered it spicy and it was phenomenal.  I also had the Ginger Fizz drink and it was pretty tasty. I can't wait to go back and try the pho!~"}
{"text":"Although our server was very cordial and apologetic, service as a whole was still pretty atrocious during our experience. My friend had ordered the shrimp from the appetizer menu as her entree and ordered a side of rice to go along with it, and I ordered the braised pork which already comes with the rice. 20 minutes or so pass by and our waiter brings my friend's shrimp to the table, no rice, at this time my waiter finally remembers to bring me my beer order. We inquire about my friend's missing rice, he brings it over, then shortly after I too get my entree... no rice. I get our waiter's attention once again to inquire about my rice, about 10 minutes later my rice finally makes it to the table, but at this time my entree is no longer hot. Our food was tasty, it was a nice intimate atmosphere, they had a tiny but decent beer selection, but If you're planning on dining here better take a lot of patience with you, (probably not worth a second trip in my opinion) unless they perhaps, get a clue from other yelpers and improve on what seems to be some major communication issues within their staff?"}
{"text":"I think the steak pho here is excellent - very large serving. But it is also pretty expensive - relatively speaking - for pho.  Good ambiance though and recommend if you love pho like me!"}
{"text":"First off, let me start by saying the food was amazing. We had the firecracker shrimp appetizer, and four of the spring rolls. Unfortunately, our service was horrendous. We sat on the patio because the tiny interior was full. Our drinks and appetizer came out quickly and provided great hope, but the joy stopped there. We had to ask twice for forks, napkins, and plates. Beverage refills didn't happen unless we asked, and we had to remind our server we were missing a roll.   Before we left I asked for a to go order on a separate check. I even clarified my order to ensure it was correct. I'm sad to say I was not at all surprised to discover when I arrived home that I had not been given what I ordered.  This will definitely be an experience my friends and I talk about for some time to come. Thank goodness the food was delicious."}
{"text":"Disliked the calamari...way too heavy on the deep fry. With mayo? I like traditional asian calamari. The spring rolls were great :)"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place.  The food is awesome and the owner genuinely cares about downtown PHX and giving her customers an awesome choice for dining.  I live nearby and eat here often.  Try the Pho- you won't regret it.  Spring Rolls are fantastic- I love the variety and splitting several w/my husband. Ambiance is awesome- not your run of the mill chain restaurant drab beige interior, as they've made over an eyesore of a historic home into a chic and welcoming spot you'd be proud to take a date... and you must take anyone who thinks the Phoenix food scene is lacking in character and hipness ;)"}
{"text":"This was our first time here. It is a relatively small place with seating for probably less than 30 or so inside. Our server was friendly and prompt. My wife had the beef Pho and I the Bo Luc Lac (Shaking Beef). We also shared and order of Tom Va Heo (Surf N Turf Fresg Spring Rolls. The food is a solid 3.5 stars. Neither I nor my wife had any complaints about the taste or seasoning of the dishes we ordered. Although the Beef Pho was just ok, our problem with Rice Paper was the portion sizes versus the cost. An \"order\" of fresh spring rolls in every Vietnamese restaurant I have ever been to is two spring rolls. Here, it is only one spring roll that they cut in half to make two pieces. At $4.75, its half the food for more than the going price elsewhere. The Shaking Beef I had was again, very tasty, but quite small as far as portion sizes go. Also, on the menu, it is described as \"cubed fillet mignon\" but I am highly suspicious as to whether the meat I had was indeed filet mignon. If it was, it was one of the worst cuts I have ever experienced. My suspicion is that it was probably a decent sirloin cut instead. You can see the portion size by the photo I have posted. Also, not a very good value for your money at $15. All in all, it wasn't a bad experience, but we will probably not be returning."}
{"text":"Holy selection of spring rolls! You like tofu? Check! Veggies? Check! Pork, chicken, and mint together? Check! You can get 'em fried or traditional Vietnamese style (er, not fried). And they're all tasty. I especially recommend the Enlighten Me.  Their salads are fantastic, too. Get the one with the vermicelli. Good stuff. Also, their entree portions are huge and pretty affordable. Definitely a good bang for your buck. I went for lunch and the food was plentiful.  My friend seemed happy with the pork sandwich, but apparently, the sweet potato fries aren't the best. Oh well, the \"Surprise Me\" cocktail made up for the average fries. So, yes to booze and all things Vietnamese; maybe pass on the American fries."}
{"text":"Firecracker Shrimp and Garlic noodles is an awesome duo to start your night. We visit at least once a month and order the same thing every time. Can't wander off the combination we have become accustom too. Service is sometimes a little slow but worth every minute."}
{"text":"A friend wanted pho so we had dinner here the other evening. I didn't know what to expect from the food to the service, to the whole look of rice paper.   I ordered the Asian passion martini and it was delicious. My friend ordered the \"up to the bartender\" drink which is sometimes dangerous but hers came out yumzo as well. I hadn't had pho before but I have had ramen and once our bowls came out, we were in love. The pho was filled with so many different flavors, I had the chicken soup and my friend had the beef. :)   The service was very nice and tentative. We pretty much had two servers as we sat outside. The inside is a nice house turned restaurant, it's a little small but very nice.   I have no complaints about this place and will dine here soon periodically."}
{"text":"Spring rolls are great! Nice variety and nice dipping sauces matching. Pho noodle soups are perfect on a cold day.  I love the atmosphere. Parking is always difficult. Even at 9pm."}
{"text":"Neighborhood Pho? Sure, why not? Look, this place is going to give you exactly what you are looking for, it's going to 'hit the spot'. It's by no means the game changing, blow you out of your chair amazeballs but it's solid. I went with the traditional Spring roll and Chicken Pho. It was exceptional. I will be back!"}
{"text":"I went for lunch. After reading some of the earlier reviews, I went early (11:30) anticipating parking issues and limited table availability. I was able to park on a side street with no problem and just a short walk across 7th. The private tables indoors were all taken, but there was availability at a community table as well as the bar.   I sat at the bar and was helped right away. The entire staff was very friendly. I ordered the Pho Tai and it was very good. A little spicy, but that's the way I prefer my food. I also had the iced coffee that I had read about in a review, very tasty. Good atmosphere, good food and good service."}
{"text":"Stumbled on this restaurant for lunch today.    The atmosphere was awesome.  The food was fresh and delicious..even better the prices for lunch were really reasonable.  Definitely going back to try more things off the menu.  I was looking for Seafood noodle soup.  I tried the Vegetarian instead and was not disappointed at all. I really reccommend this place."}
{"text":"Really modern feel, clean and simple. authentic Vietnamese cuisine. loved it expect to pay about at least 20 dollars. pho and the crispy egg rolls are my recommendation. service was always on point and friendly."}
{"text":"We went to Rice Paper on a Wednesday around 2:30. They have all day happy hour so we both had Sapporo's and ordered Beef Pho and a Chicken Sandwich. They only serve on trays AFTER 4pm. Our server was great. The Pho we both Loved and we are picky. The sandwich was OK, honestly I wouldn't order that again. The bread was tough, the chicken had great flavor but there wasn't much of it, they also put fresh cucumber and carrots with it. The Garlic fries were delicious and came with a Great Dipping Sauce. The decor is very modern, definitely a surprise. It is small so I'm not sure we will head there for dinner anytime soon. But for lunch it's a great spot. It is pricier then other Vietnamese Places we have been to but I'd rather pay more for a clean place to eat. They seemed to constantly be cleaning, and I love seeing that!"}
{"text":"Been here a handful of times, its hit or miss. The place is VERY pretencious and hipster-ish but on a normal day you can get a good bowl of pho. It is over priced compared to other more authentic places but the quality of  sliced beef in the pho is better then most places. They do pride them self on the variety of spring rolls they offer, which I found to be nothing special but not bad. So all in all its OKAY, plain and simple."}
{"text":"Small place....awesome spring rolls!"}
{"text":"(Lyrics - Bruno Mars - When I Was Your Man)  Same roll but it feels just a little modern now Our food on the menu but it don't sound the same When we Yelp and talk about you, all it does is makes me hungry now Cause my stomach growls a little when I smell your dish  It all just sounds like oooooorrrhh.... Mmm, too hungry, too thirsty to realize That I should've bought me eggrolls And ate some Pho Should've had some spring rolls When I had the chance Take my friends to your restaurant Cause all we wanted to do was make our appetite's dance Now my belly's full And I don't intend to eat anymore....  I was a tad bit skeptical of Rice Paper after hearing about their food and what it was.  It's definitely not your traditional Vietnamese restaurant by any means.   Very modern and artsy with an Americanize menu.    My expectations weren't high needless to say, but I had to try with an open mind and stomach.  In the end, I was pretty blown away.  I really appreciate the food play here with different ingredients added to traditional cuisine.  It was bold and playful at the same time.  Apparently, this is a spring and eggroll kind of restaurant so I ordered their spider and tuna spring roll with a traditional pork eggroll.    Overall, I LOVE SPIDERS!  I don't say that much cause truthfully the creep me out!  The crispiness of the tempura soft shell crab was a perfect combination to my soft and delicate mango, avocado, and vermicelli noodles!  Served with a miso ginger sauce this roll was bangin'!  My tuna spring roll was okay, but definitely sticking to the Spider.  My traditional eggroll was decent nothing to spectacular.    In the end, if you're looking for traditional old school Vietnamese food -- go elsewhere cause Rice Papers new school with some ass kicking springs ready to rock and pop your palates! - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"We tried 2 of the spring rolls and then each got the Beef Pho- we loved it! From the ambiance, to the crowd, to the friendly owners who frequently (but not obnoxiously) checked in on us throughout the meal- this place was awesome. We are always looking for new, fun independent places to grab a bite, and this is a new favorite of ours. We would take friends from out of town here in a heart beat- which speaks volumes! While their prices weren't cheap, I believe the quality of the food was well worth it. Looking forward to going back!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice since this review. The food doesn't disapoint. I've tried a chicken soup and carmalized salmon dinner. I was satisfied with both. The service is very good and personal. The place is quite intimate. I think the guy filled my glass of water a dozen times or so during the night... you won't go thirsty. I think the idea of turning a house into a resaraunt is a very interesting idea and it certainly works well at Rice Paper. It's definately worth checking out. I'm sure I will return again in the near future..."}
{"text":"the pho is tasty and servers are friendly.  it's a new restaurant and will be crowded for the next few weeks. give it a chance to get its bearings!"}
{"text":"If you're a hipster and couldn't care less about the value of the dining experience you're getting, then this is your place.  The bar area and the cozy ambience (being a former Coronado house spruced up with some modern touches) fit the urban hip look.  However, there are 3 things that really stood out right off the bat during our dinner tonight.  PARKING - If you think Churn/Windsor have limited parking, wait till you try driving here.  I'm still wondering why the city keeps signing off all these places that will definitely cause some traffic and parking issues.  PRICE - My family of 3 ordered a salad, a banh mi sandwich (which I actually liked) and a chicken entree with just 3 glasses of water (no paid drinks).  Our total bill was $35 + tip.  I don't know about you guys but I've been to most Vietnamese places here in the Valley (both dives and restos that have the same ambience as this place) and I barely hit $25 with the same food that we ordered.  Again, I think the target market are hipsters since they put MODERN in their cuisine name.  SERVICE - There are only limited seating in this restaurant so imagine when people start coming in groups of 8, then a group of 5, etc.  Our food didn't arrived at the same time (the chicken took a long time) so I'm quite irritated when the servers kept looking at us.  That look that says \"can you guys hurry up so we can sit this big group that just came in\".  Yes, that kind of look.  I wish we can leave too but the chicken hasn't arrived yet.  We pretty much gobbled our food in 10 minutes, paid the bill and left in a hurry.  I don't think we will be coming back.  There's a lot of other Vietnamese joints in the Valley that have stood the test of time."}
{"text":"If only they would have put the same amount of time and energy into training the servers, and working on the food itself, as they did on the styling of the restaurant, this place could have been great.    Value is way out of line. $4.50 for ONE below average spring roll. We tried three types and all had only one sliver of the ingredients listed.  We were given only  one menu when we were seated, WTF?  Another table near by saw that we had not been helped after about 5-10 minutes and notified the manager who was working the bar, and he didn't do much at just send some kid over to us. Was not given a drink menu until I asked for one AFTER we ordered food. WTF?  Summary: Super trendy/hip/stylish place with a least double overpriced food, inexperienced  wait staff, and  management who doesn't have a clue about customer service."}
{"text":"We decided to try Rice Paper out after we couldn't find parking across the street at Green. Parking at Rice Paper wasn't much better (it was the weekend after all), but we  managed to find a spot. :)   We were seated immediately in a mostly full restaurant. The decor was nice, very modern looking, but calming. I ordered the lemon grass chicken and my friend ordered the shrimp pho and a traditional spring roll. I was not a fan of my lemon grass chicken, and embarrassingly sent it back for the shrimp pho. I say *embarrassingly* because I NEVER send stuff back, but the dish was just too sweet for my liking.   On the other hand, our server James was great!! He took my dish back, no problem, and brought out the pho in only a few minutes time. He was polite and attentive! Nice work, James! :)  The Pho was REALLY good, I even got some to go for my boyfriend, and he loved it as well! I tried some of the traditional spring roll, and it was also delicious."}
{"text":"Amazing, amazing! I went twice while visiting Phoenix and I know once I move there, this will be a favorite for sure.  The spring rolls are super fresh and delicious and the pho tai is my favorite.  Huge and filling and so flavorful!  The location is small but has super cute outdoor seating and its very nice inside."}
{"text":"Anyone who tells you this place isn't amazing is cu cu for coco puffs. The owners are equally amazing. They will remember you and tell you amazing stories and the cocktails are always amazing. My favorite is the lychejito made from lychee infused vodka made in house. The spring roll bar is amazing and they always change it up for me if I ask for substitutions. There really isn't anything on the menu that isn't good they offer everything from Vietnamese sammies to amazing clay pots. I always go for the soup but that hasn't stopped me from trying everything else. Everything is always fresh and delicious. Their happy hour is awesome as well."}
{"text":"Vietnamese food for rich white people.  The Pho is boring and $10 a bowl. Same goes for the cocktails. The fusion spring rolls are inspired, but expensive.  Been here three times because I live close and love Pho, but I'd still rather drive several miles away for decent pho at a decent price.    I have two words of advice: STAR ANISE."}
{"text":"Cute little spot across the street from Nami, tried their tofu sandwich, I would want to come again and try more things to judge the food but the sandwich I had was pretty good."}
{"text":"I've always liked the food here. Tonight's review is about the service.  Our house was robbed today while I was out running errands with my two small kids. We arrived home to find our house trashed, valuables stolen, and our sense of security violated. After dealing with the police, the fingerprint dusting, and trying to figure out what is gone, I couldn't imagine cooking dinner and just wanted comfort food.   I found myself at Rice Paper. The tall redheaded bartender and his coworkers kept me entertained and made me smile after a rough day.   And the pho really hit the spot!"}
{"text":"I was headed to the Firehouse for firebreathing Show and a great dj but dropped in Rice Paper to burn some time and have a drink. I ended up staying at Rice Paper till almost midnight hanging out with the owners Lan and Hue who are extraordinary funny sisters I will call Hue Hollywood from here on out! Service is perfect, feels like family, food is dead on, I ordered the shaking beef, which was Cubes of Filet Mignon sauteed in this super \" I could die for this sauce\" with a nice plate of steamed rice with a  side with grilled zucchini. Hue also makes a mean Grey Goose with a splash of Pineapple!!!!! \"Picture her splashing pinneaplle juice many times here\" I also ordered the traditional Summer Rolls, they were heavenly. I can't wait to go back !!!"}
{"text":"Pho My Goodness! The place is cute, service quick and friendly, and the Pho Tai was delicious! A new favorite around this area - I will be back :)"}
{"text":"You know what I hate about Rice Paper? Absolutely nothing.  The vegetarian pho(with Grandma's sauce) is my absolute favorite and the ambiance is great. Definitely one of my favorite spots for happy hour!"}
{"text":"Excellent service! There firecracker shrimp is AMAZING! Cute little place! Everyone is super friendly and they take very good care of you!"}
{"text":"This IKEA based metro, so called Vietnamese, \"restaurant\" is the most unauthentic Vietnamese food I've ever had the displeasure of eating.  I usually don't even write reviews but after $42.00 and  having to ask for hot sauce and Hoison sauce - seriously, you've got be kidding me is this for real.  This attempt at trying to make Vietnamese an upmarket \"shi shi\" experience will prove to be a huge disappointment to anyone who has had real, good, Vietnamese Pho.  It just comes across as being an overpriced faux experience (pun intended).  It's like a white guy from Peoria's attempt at making Vietnamese food - epic fail.  By the way the people in the white Prius with the handicap license plate who parked in the HANDICAPPED spot - who then jumped out of their car and ran inside (losers!) - should give you a good indication of the kind of place and people you'll be dealing with.  Please save yourself about $20.00 and find a real Vietnamese restaurant - unless your really that afraid to go outside of your comfort zone or try anything new.  I will give them a one star for their decor, which is completely antiseptic, just like their food and service.  Scathing, yes, do they deserve a scathing review, without a doubt.  I guess I'm the only one in Phoenix who has ever been to a real Vietnamese restaurant in LA or S.F.?    Regards and happy hunting for a real Vietnamese.   Jack"}
{"text":"Terrible first experience.  We were so fired up for this place, but dinner was a total letdown.  1) One person's dinner showed up a half hour after everyone else's.  Inexcusable. 2) No Pho.  \"We ran out.\"  Whaaaaaaat? 3) Overpriced.  Significantly. 4) Out of way too many items on the food/drink menu.  Positives: really cute place, great menu with lots of variety.  Some fine-tuning might be able to fix the problems.  Good luck, Rice Paper."}
{"text":"Went here on the advice of a friend.  Great service great prices, and a menu that is great for the healthy eater. Can't imagine what restaurant the neg reviewers went to, but I thought this place was great and will definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"Earlier this month, we tried banh mi, which was okay. Today, we tried pho. The beef pho was pretty good. I thought the broth was flavorful even without ngo gai. We will go back for pho."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is cozy at Rice Paper since it was previously a home.Its a nice place. The food is well preoared and presented. Its small, but if you just want a cozy dinner with really good food this is the place. I had the fried tofu with peanut sauce as an appetizer and then spring rolls with the tempura vegetables and then Curry tofu. All of it was really excellent and fresh!"}
{"text":"I was at church this Sunday morning when I had a craving for Pho. I went on my yelp app and put it pho near South Phoenix. About 4 miles away was Rice Paper.  It's always scary to try something new but after checking out a few reviews, I figured it was worth trying and I even brought 6 other friends who also loved it (some never had Vietnamese before).  My order: - Traditional bowl of Pho                   - Pork Crispy Spring Rolls  My friends ordered: Banh Mi (viet sandwiches)   Here is the review.  Pros: - Pho was tasty and cleaner than most Pho places            - Decor of the place was very chic            - There is a bar (for you drinkers)            - The banh mi were HUGE and came with garlic or sweet potato fries            - Nice outdoor patio for when its cooler outside            - The head server was very helpful  Cons: - Price was a little more than most pho places (Pho: $10 / Rolls $3.50-$5),             - Spring rolls were pricey for one spring roll or two cut up fried pieces to make four.             - Parking lot was small...about 12 spaces             - The restaurant is about the size of a house so even though we had a group of 7, I don't know if i'd bring that big of a group next time.              Conclusion: Check this place out. It's intimate and I'm glad they're open later than most restaurants. Pricey, but hey, sometimes you gotta pay to have something nicer."}
{"text":"I'm going to give the benefit of the doubt and go with three stars instead of two. I've had food from here on two separate occasions; the first time was take out and a coworker picked it up and the most recent time was a rainy and cold Sunday evening. On both times the food was great. I had pho both times, first chicken, then beef as well as shrimp spring rolls and spicy edamame. While I have nothing to complain about regarding the food, I've had better. Don't get me wrong, its very good, but maybe not as authentic as it could be? Still easily a 4 star rating. I would have to say that service was 2 stars. You can walk in from the front (7th St side) or the back (parking lot side). Regardless of which entry you use, there is no host stand and no clear place to stand. It was a busy night and I felt that no matter where I stood, I was in someone's way or was close to having my ass in a customer's face.  I had to ask what the seating arrangements were after being ignored for about 5+ minutes. Do we seat ourselves? Do we wait to be seated? We were told there was a 15 minute wait because of how busy they were. Well, no one else was waiting and they were clearing off two two-seater tables (these were the only open tables in the restaurant and there was only two of us). We did happen to get seated within just a couple minutes though.Our server was less than patient with us and it was clear he was frazzled. Up ordering, we were informed they were out of chicken. With each table that ordered after us, they were out of something different. First chicken, then beef, then glasses, then small pho bowls. I don't know if that's a norm, or if it was just them being ill-prepared for a busy weekend, but it felt like something I would expect from a brand new restaurant with completely new staff and management. At least the food was good."}
{"text":"Holy spring rolls! Even as time was running out and I was leaving the US for good, I had to make one last stop at this place. It was almost like \"what do you want as your last meal?\" sort of thing. The garlic noodles were fantastic, although not what I expected. It definitely had garlic, but it was more on the sweeter side of things, in my taste. Maybe that's the real Vietnamese garlic noodles? I don't know. I'm only Filipino, not Vietnamese. Their edamame was really good and spicy, lots of bite, and its leftover sauce was perfect on top of my rice. And what sealed the deal for the 5th star? It would have to be the pork crispy spring rolls. I can't have enough of that addictive sauce. Whoever sold their soul for this recipe, really should go to heaven."}
{"text":"Pretty good Pho - only place I've had it so I don't have much to compare to. The spring rolls are great. The asparagus in my Pho was hard to chew and I had to spit it out, wasn't cool with that. But the flavor is good, the green tea is perfect, been a few times and I'll go back from time to time."}
{"text":"Make sure you check your bill....Called the owner to discuss about the incorrect bill was told she never there and had to keep trying..make sure you check your bill.."}
{"text":"Awful service! I took my mom to this place recently. We were seated promptly and that was the only prompt service we received after that. A server NEVER came to greet us or take our order. After about 15 min or so I approached the host who seated us if the waiter could please come by our table to take our order and we waited and waited....we eventually just left.  Never again will I be back."}
{"text":"From an actual Vietnamese person:  So we were in the mood for pho/vietnamese food so we decided to check this place out since it was recommended. Looked like a small home from the outside and pretty modern looking when we went in. For appetizers we ordered the fried spring rolls which were actually very small (bascially 2 rolls) and just meh. I ordered the pork banh mi and it was terrible. Probably the worst banh mi I've had, and I've had some bad ones. Tiny bit of pickled vegetables when it needed way more and the pork was poorly cooked and seasoned. Didnt taste like banh mi at all. My friend ordered the pho tai which was okay, definitely order the larger portion which just seemed like normal size. Don't know how small the small size must be.   Service was also poor, Not a lot of people there and they took their sweet time, seriously just talking to each other at the bar. It was hard to get their attention with the way the restaurant was set up.  If you have never tried pho before, definitely don't go here as there are many other good places in the phoenix area like pho thanh"}
{"text":"Great food!! Small & limited seating if outdoor patio not open. But worth the wait! Clean food, vegan, vegetarian options ! Great flavor! Pho soup yummy & fresh rolls! I will be back!"}
{"text":"Not authentic. Lacking any fusion. Just poorly made food. Pho Thanh is the place to go."}
{"text":"Went for lunch.  It's still within two months of opening and it's doing well from the size of the crowd.  Parking is a bit of a challenge and you may have to park across the street (or in Amigo's Appliances lot as I did...not suggested).    The atmosphere is a nice change from most Pho places.  It has a modern, slightly contemporary feel to it with all the amenities of a social meeting locale (good bar, few small TV's in the corners above the bar).  Walls are exposed brick and it has the now required community table.  Had the Pho and it was outstanding.  Tough to find good Pho generally in Phoenix but their's is impressive.  Fun, upbeat staff.  Only hit was that it did take a little time to get the food but nothing too lengthy.  Try it out!"}
{"text":"This place is consistent. Their spring rolls are really good and the pho is as decent (good price too) as you can find in the valley. My girlfriend was sick recently and she ate here and felt a lot better. She loves this place."}
{"text":"You know, I was worried about riding halfway across town from Mesa to go to this restaurant. I am always a bit anxious when it comes to food I haven't tried before - and no one in our group had been to the Rice Paper either.  What we found was a restaurant off 7th St, in an older part of Phoenix, inside a repurposed old house. The decor was charming - the patio was inviting, but we chose to sit inside.  Five of us - we walked in & were immediately greeted & seated. Greg was our server. These folks took the time to explain the menu, how things worked, that they had a full bar & more.  We did the family style routine, which they seem to accommodate rather well. Three siblings, plus my sister's husband & my daughter... needless to say, we have no worry about sharing food.  We ordered most of the huge selection of spring rolls - I just learned tonight that I love spring rolls. Three different kinds of shrimp, pork, veggie, you name it, I think we had it. Greens that looked like they came straight from the garden - the presentation was beautiful. Sauces that were so good, I wanted to take some home. Ordered some bowls of pho - Vietnamese soup, for the uninitiated, but that's okay - they tell you what everything is. The combination, with meatballs, tripe, beef and more was worth the trip all by itself.  For dessert, we had their ginger crème brûlée. Talk about decadent... and perfectly prepared.  Several bottles of wine and a sampled some of their nice selection of  beers in their rack - when we asked if something was good, they brought us a sample, a very nice touch. They have a light cream ale that has me making room in the fridge for another favorite.  But with as delectable as the food was, the service was out of this world. I've eaten at some of the nicer establishments and I was wowed. My brother, who works in some of the nicer restaurants in SoCal, was amazed. Exceptionally attentive without being overbearing - not once were we asked how is everything, timed for when we have mouths full of food.  Be prepared for a surprise is you need to use the facilities - left side is men. Right side is women. Sliding doors into the private areas - but the sinks are in an open, shared area.  We felt welcomed, had a great time and I would not hesitate to go again. And again. And again.  To Greg and the rest of the good people at the Rice Paper, I thank you and cannot recommend you enough.  My only complaint is that it is a drive from the East Valley - but more than worth every mile. Parking is tight, so carpool & bring lots of friends, family - even your enemies... if you bring them here, they can't stay your enemy."}
{"text":"Another fantastic place in the Coronado.  The ambiance is great and what you expect from a converted home built 100 years ago.  We sat at the bar and got great service.  I saw what looked to be an awesome patio for when it cools off in a few months.   We went during happy hour when the prices were low and the food was delicious.  I ordered the Spicy Asian spring roll and didn't really think it was that spicy based on what the ingredients were.  It was very delicious and I added red chili sauce to it so I could get the face burn I was hoping for.  My friend ordered the hot wings and those must have been hot.  He was sweating bullets.  I also ordered the Crispy Pork spring roll to share with my friend and didn't want to share.  Take a leaf off the mint and place it on the spring roll and dip it into the sauce and place it in your mouth in order to experience flavor heaven.   They also have my favorite vodka here.  Vodka is a great reason to go anywhere."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a couple times  while in the area. The summer rolls are fantastic. They make them to order and there is a wide array of them to choose from.  My favorite is the seared ahi tuna with jicama and mango-YuMMMMO!  It's one of my favorite things to eat when it's this hot out.  They also have the best edamame in town!  I know what you're thinking, it's just edamame....this is different because they are rolled in a secret recipe of homemade chill sauce. Beware, the heat will creep up on you :) The wings are good too...messy, but good.  I like them extra crispy! The beef entree is to die for.  Very tender and full of flavor.  So is the salmon!  Both come sizzling hot on a cast iron skillet.  The flavors are very robust, but tolerable even for the not so brave.  It's a good intro to Vietnamese flavors, and without the food poisoning hehe.  The staff is very nice and the crowd is an eclectic mix-very casual and fun. This is an extremely small renovated house-turned-restaurant.  Get there early, or you will sadly have to go somewhere else. If there's no parking left, there's a strong chance you won't be eating."}
{"text":"This is quickly becoming my favorite place. The pho is excellent. I favor the chicken. The service is usually good and the servers are very friendly. The prices are excellent."}
{"text":"Literally the reason I'm moving to Phoenix. I visited and ended up here randomly. I made some friends and our server even welcomed me and my girlfriend to the city with a free drink. And the food??? Wow. Too good. If you don't visit this place while in Phoenix then you're blowing it. Believe me."}
{"text":"This place is the best when it's cold, but I've had it on a hot summer night and it hits the spot just the same. The crispy chicken rolls are where it's at for appetizers and the half order of pho is generous! Over everything the ambiance here is really chill and relaxing, perfect place for a date or hey pretty much anything else"}
{"text":"Has this place changed hands?  Service isn't as good as it used to be, there are insect traps visible at the bar, and the last time I was there, every time the kitchen door opened up it smelled like death.  Disgusting. Edit:  Blech.  Just reviewed the latest inspection report for this place.  I'm not going back. No way, no how.  http://www.maricopa.gov/EnvSvc/OnlineApplication/EnvironmentalHealth/FoodInspection?p=FD-33297&i=3898115"}
{"text":"Went here last week with three couples , we had a bunch of spring rolls as apps very good! My fav was the spider roll! Great service and drinks deffenitly will go back!"}
{"text":"We loved it here! It's Set in a cute house, it's very cozy yet trendy. We ordered an assortment of spring rolls, the sizzling steak, and pho. It was all so amazing, and bursting with flavor. The service was also great and they were very accommodating (we brought in our baby)."}
{"text":"If you like spring rolls, you have to go to Rice Paper. For those of you who don't know, spring rolls are the non deep-fried type, rather, they have fresh lettuce, mint, cilantro and such inside a rice paper shell. Think of it as a Vietnamese Burrito. At Rice Paper they have it set up almost like a sushi bar. You have your choice of about 20 different spring rolls (all priced under $4). You check what you want and they make it in front of you. The spring rolls come in all types from sushi grade tuna, to fried crab, to shrimp and vietnamese sausage. Each comes with a special dipping sauce catered to the roll. If you don't like spring rolls, I recommend the Bahn Mi, which is a Vietnamese sandwich that you'll never forget served with sweet potato fries. Or try the Pho noodle soup, or even (I can't believe I'm saying this since I hate salads) the salads are great. They make cocktails infused with lychee fruit like the Lycheejito (a twist on the mojito). You can't go wrong here, and the great thing is is that everything is so refreshing and healthy, you feel great afterwords, especially on a hot Phoenix summer day."}
{"text":"SO GLAD I CAN GET PHO ON MY LUNCH NOW!!! YAY Rice Paper! They do get busy around lunch time but I have never had a problem with my pick-up orders not being ready when they said they would. I have had the Pho without meat though so I can't comment on that but the Pho in general is fantastic and they add in extra noodles and veggies if you skip the meat. your common pho prices that you see around this area so I can't really bitch about the price. Cute but small inside and yes like others have said.. parking sucks baallzzzzz.  Other than that definitely  a great place for to grab so Pho."}
{"text":"2 stars for food but me and my friends who have never been to been rice paper didn't have a great experience. The owner or manager on duty pulled all the employees into the back (which is 5ft away from where we were sitting) and yelled at them. She was so loud and cursing left and right. How embarrassing for her. Worst part was I bragged to my friends how good this place was... I ate those words that day..."}
{"text":"The dishes at Rice Paper (overall) are fresh, tasty, and healthy. The sauces are exceptional. It's hard to choose between the ginger miso and peanut hoisin, but either one is good enough to eat with a spoon... however, lick-worthy dips can't quite bring a place back from the depths of intolerable service.  Holy hell, the service... not just bad, but weird. Really weird. In three visits, not one has been free of something bizarre and unacceptable.  The first time I came to Rice Paper was when it first opened. The food was good! The atmosphere was pleasant! The guy talking to us the entire time was not! I don't know if he worked there or partially owns the place, but he had some kind of authority and some nerve not to let us chew in peace. Maybe I'm just mildly antisocial towards strangers while in the middle of eating a soft shell crab salad and can't appreciate those kinds of interactions, but regardless, it didn't deter me from trying again.  The second time I went, a gluten-free friend was amongst my companions. The waiter claimed a bunch of things were gluten-free, then kept going back to the kitchen to check, and it repeatedly turned out that they weren't. When the waiter finally figured out something gluten-free for our friend to order, everything was fine. Until he became violently ill later that day. Lesson: if it's not gluten-free, it's better not to lie.  The most recent time I visited Rice Paper was on a date. We sat in the only free spot, next to a boisterously loud couple who appeared to be talking with an owner. After a cilia-damaging cackle emerged from the table, I turned around with a rather blank, dismayed expression. Then I turned back to my date and said, \"Should we find another table?\" The owner approached us, grabbing my shoulder, and said \"Do you have something to complain about, too?\" I was shocked and can't remember the rest of the conversation, other than that she grabbed my shoulder and squeezed it twice more. She better have been drunk... I mean, WHAT THE ACTUAL F$%&. I almost left right then, and if it weren't for the peanut hoisin sauce, I probably would have."}
{"text":"Stopped by on a Sunday to try the place out. Ordered the shrimp app which was overcooked, chewy and tasteless.   The other two chicken dishes were the same. Will probably not try this place again"}
{"text":"Have been going ever since it opened and WTF has happened to the service????? The last 3-4 times I have gone it seems like the service gets more horrible each time.  Love the dishes although they need some kind of different specials now & then...Will give it another chance but between being/feeling ignored by the wait staff and having out orders either screwed up or come out at a agonizing slow pace I feel like my love affair with Rice Paper is coming to an unfortunate end.  (Sigh)"}
{"text":"My mom took me here for dinner when I was in town. The decor is really quite awesome and the food is pretty good. I just have a hard time with expensive pho. After growing up in Seattle if a bowl of pho costs more that $5 and doesn't come with a cream puff it's hard to feel great about it. As it is, this was delicious and I bet you'd be hard pressed to find better pho in Phoenix. My stepfather had some sort of braised pork and rice thing and said it was delicious.  Come here for their exceptional happy hour. It's everyday from 11-6:30. They're crazy!"}
{"text":"I am so disappointed.   We went to Rice Paper for lunch today and we waited for a table, then one of the waiters told us there was something open on the patio.   It's 90 degrees outside in Arizona right now. Wait there's shade. Ok, we'll eat on the patio. Oh what? All the tables are on the patio and you have 3 people. . . ok wait for us to move something together.   Are you all seated? Oh wait I forgot to tell you that our computers are down and we can't put in any food orders. No we can't write them on paper. Why? My manager said no. No. I don't know how long they will be down for. You can wait as long as you would like.   WHAT THE F*CK?! You could have told us this before we wasted 25 minutes of our lunch break in your stupid renovated not very good food house diner.   Rice Paper is officially off the menu."}
{"text":"I've came here for lunch a couple times. I tried their beef pho and some of their rice paper rolls. The rolls are big and flavorful. On the other hand, the pho broth tastes pretty good but lacked the beef compared to other places I've eaten pho at. It's a cute little spot but get there early for lunch since they have limited parking in the back."}
{"text":"Was one of the few places opened late on a Monday Night. Found through yelp actually, and was glad I did baby. Full bar. Pho. Shared bathroom concept was in effect with an organic twist. The place seemed like all my cool hip freak-a-zoids be at. Food was pretty good baby."}
{"text":"Best Dine-in or take-away pho in dwntwn PHX. Vegetarian options are a plenty & I can't say that I've managed to find a bad item on any of my many visits. My take-away has always been expertly packaged and just as tasty of an experience.  This adorably renovated house turned to restaurant is quaint and a good spot for a date or happy hour with friends. Full bar and exotic mixed drinks have never failed to impress my friends that I've introduced to Rice Paper. Patio seating is available too. A big plus is I can bike and securely store my bike right in front."}
{"text":"Went here with my family for my daughters 26th  birthday.  What a great place !  It is a converted old house.  Looks like this area of 7th street is becoming it's own Restaurant Row...  Rice Paper has a Very cool, young and hip vibe.  Kilt Lifter on tap !    really good Pho and really tasty, original and creative rolls.   Very reasonable prices.  We ate inside at the long wooden table.  good lighting, comfortable chair.  Outside patio looked really  nice as well with the long padded bench seating.   Saigon Dan was a very tasty dish as well.  Just depends on whether you like the soup or the salad.. better yet.. try them both.. Crunchy Ahi rolls were tasty and had a great sauce with them.   Many rolls to choose from.   The Bahn Mi Sandwiches looked tasty but didn't try them.  Looking forward to going back here again soon."}
{"text":"BEST PEANUT SAUCE I HAE EVER HAD!  I am a spring roll fanatic and I'm always in search of great spring rolls and sauce.. And this place takes the medal for the best peanut sauce. I have had 100's of different sauce in my time due to my boyfriend being Vietnamese and always taking me to different hole in the wall mom and pop shops. Their pho is pretty good but the best out of what I had was their peanut sauce! Yummy"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I just love in the Coronado neighborhood and literally come 2-3 times a week at night. All I can say is the food is pretty amazing (shaking beef, lemongrass chicken, any spring or crunch roll). On top of that, we have met some really awesome people like Chere and Tucker who work there and really know what they are doing, as well as always making us feel super welcome every time we walk into the door. We love this place and will continue to come back multiple times a week as long as none of this changes."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why everyone raves about this place...I went with a friend yesterday, and the place was packed! We barely got a parking spot. She had never had pho before, so I wanted to take her to a place that got high reviews so she would have a good experience. The restaurant is very cute, it is in an old house, and is very 'trendy' looking. We were seated and given water and then proceeded to wait for a long period of time before the waiter came around to take our order. When he (finally) did, he was nice enough. We ordered the pork spring roll to share and we each ordered pho ga. I have had fresh rolls before (a lot of them), and this one was just not that great. It was mainly comprised of lettuce, with a little bit of chewy pork bits and a few noodles. Other (more hole in the wall type places...aka authentic) places fill the roll with more of a balance of ingredients. Also, the ends of the fresh roll had very thing rice paper, making it hard to chew and swallow and felt like a piece of rubber in my mouth. Not awesome. So our pho comes out and it looks weird because the broth is clear....almost like water. I have never experienced this before(and I have eaten, and made, a lot of pho). All of the toppings were fresh, but they didn't add enough flavor to save the bland broth. Additionally, the noodles used are thicker, more spaghetti-like noodles than the typical thin rice noodles found in pho. The whole thing was just not flavorful. It felt like the broth was not homemade, and if it was, was missing all of the spices that give it such a unique flavor. To top it off, this place is WAY overpriced. We paid 23$ for lunch, and it wasn't good. I would recommend finding a little whole in the wall pho place in which the employees speak little-to-no English and trying their food. Skip this pretentious 'trendy' spot."}
{"text":"Amazing spring rolls, great beer and wine selection and amazing staff. We have become regulars here and the service is always outstanding.  I love the spring rolls and if you are vegetarian or pescetarian this place has you covered.  The Pho is quite authentic but leans toward the healthy side without losing the great taste.  Seriously best vietnamese spring rolls anywhere. This is our favorite restaurant in Phoenix."}
{"text":"New favorite place!  Great service.  Firecracker Shrimp was amazing as was the fried tofu... Pho was terrific.  Definitely going back.  SOOO good."}
{"text":"Ugh. Where do I even begin? This is NOT an authentic Vietnamese restaurant. It's not even an 'Asian fusion' restaurant. It's really just a hipster hideaway where they pretend to know how to make Vietnamese food and fail.   The food is super overpriced, the service is horrible, and the pho was cooked all wrong. I honestly should have known to stay away when I realized no one there was Vietnamese or, you know, not a teenage hipster.   For starters, the service was lacking. It's a hipster seat yourself anywhere deal but the issue with that is the elusive and ever-not-present server/hostess doesn't realize or care who just sat down. She ignored us for a couple minutes before asking for our drink orders and then forgetting for 15 minutes to actually bring them. The orders took forever to come which is impressive because the orders were for pho. Finally, the place smells like a cross between an airplane bathroom and a port-a-potty.   The crispy calamari appetizer was chewy and the accompanying crackers were old so they had the texture of styrofoam. The entree was two orders of pho dac biet which were actually fairly large but, otherwise, totally inadequate. For pho that expensive you should get amazing pho but not at this place. The pho broth wasn't hot enough so the tai didn't cook properly and was super chewy as was all of the meat in the pho dac biet. The broth was so bland and not nearly hot enough. I had to put a ton of hoisin sauce in it to make it taste like something and, even then, I had to ask an elusive waiter for the sauces.   An wholly dismal experience that has made me extremely grateful to live in a state where  Vietnamese restaurants serve actual Vietnamese food."}
{"text":"Oh no... No no no- all wrong here. I'm pretty sure this place had a busy night before but tonight they seem to not know how to operate and handle a full house. Took forever to get served, food did come out quick but they forgot the utensils..took forever to flag down a server for that too. My Pho noodles were uncooked and hard. The meat was very chewy and hard. Giving this place 2 stars because the broth was good though. But don't come here for Pho- go to a legit pho, hole in the wall place! #EpicFail"}
{"text":"We seemed to walk in right at the dinner rush, so they were very busy but, we found a seat right away. Immediately out server came over and said he would be right with us.  He came by and dropped off menus. When he got back we ordered drinks, spring rolls & garlic noodles. Everything we ordered was fresh. We got the grilled chicken, ahi tuna and saigon spring rolls. The sauce that came with the saigon and ahi was okay but a little too sweet so we used the curry hoisin sauce that came with the chicken spring roll on everything.  We liked all the food and drinks.  The service was a little slow since it was busy, but not overly slow. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Rice Paper was one of my fave places to eat downtown Phoenix. It was also a place I conducted business lunches with clients. Unfortunately, today was not a good experience at all. Actually, it was downright disgusting. I took a client to lunch today at 11am. I ordered my usual- garlic noodles, fresh Buddha spring roll, and an iced green tea. My business client ordered the same but with the fresh chicken spring roll instead.  We received our food pretty quickly after ordering.  I ate through half of my garlic noodles when I noticed something dark in color. I moved my garlic noodles around with chop sticks and ... IT WAS A ROACH!  A ROACH IN MY GARLIC NOODLES THAT I WAS EATING-- antennas, legs, full bodied ROACH!!!  My client grabbed my plate bc she didn't believe me and threw her hands up in disgust. We immediately stopped eating and called our server over to the table. To make sure we did not cause a scene or disturb others eating lunch, I calmly asked the gentleman to look in my dish. He jumped backed and gasped in horror. He immediately walked away with the noodles and took it to the back. We immediately let him know we were done. He ensured that he will take care of it. A few minutes later a manager (im assuming bc she did not identify or introduce herself) quickly came to our table and apologized profusely stating that our bill will be comped.  Although we appreciate the apologies, the damage was done.  I'm sick to my stomach and mentally stunned by this horrible experience. The manager immediately stated that they were inspected recently with no problems and also the restaurant was  sprayed, in which I understood it was for pests.   She also stated \"this is the first time this has ever happened. We always watch our food and look at it before it is served.\"  Even though it has been a few hours I'm still in shock and am very queasy.  My business client called me as well stating she was nauseous too and can't get over the situation. We  will never go back... Ever.  I will also ensure anyone I know doesn't go back. I am fully aware of what has and can happen in the restaurant business as I was a former State Health Inspector years ago.  I have witnessed quite a bit of unhealthy, disgusting, filthy things but it is a completely different story being the person behind the actual experience.   Sorry Rice Paper, you have lost a very loyal customer along with anyone who associates with me."}
{"text":"Definitley one of my favorite places for Pho in the valley. I know people say its trendy hipster spot but I dont mind. The spring rolls are all tasty(spider and spicy asian are my fave) the pho is good and a few months ago I discovered grandmas spicy chili that is now an add on to everything I eat there and I love it. The pho broth is good. Chicken slices are big so I cut them up. Same with the jalapenos I cut those up to. I do love there beef steak dish as well. I forget what its called but its filet slices in a light glaze. The sandwiches are also great but never room for soup and sandwich. Generous portions fair prices and full bar. I went this last week and really didnt see any of the same faces working there but new bartender was friendly even if she charged us an extra $1 for veggies lol.   Parking kinda sucks it can be hit or miss. Sometimes we end up parking a few doors down behind church."}
{"text":"Incredible traditional taste with a twist of contemporaries and the ambiance was lovely"}
{"text":"This was third visit to Rice Paper, and with each visit, my experience got worse and worse.  I was super excited to have Pho so close to my home, and I loved my experience the first time, which was definitely due to the server. My second experience involved me having to ask for actual iced tea since the one they served me was so watered down it looked like dirty water.  Today, however, was the final straw. Not only did it take 5 minutes to be brought drinks, but the waiter/bartender/guy with the Sanford & Son mustache was awful. We were the only table in the restaurant, and he still gave poor service. He ran his busser ragged once it began to get busier, and when he noticed we tipped his busser and said \"this is for you, and only you,\" he came up and threw the ticket down on the table in front of us.   I also didn't mention I had to get up and ask for Hoisin sauce, and when the busboy took it to be boxed up, I heard comments about how I used too much sauce in my broth, or some nonsense.  Between this and the Ikea catalog vomiting into the interior, I would stay away."}
{"text":"Waitress was attentive and helpful, food was good and portioned appropriately. The tables are nice and the seats comfortable. The music is really good too.  Unfortunately, they brought us the wrong spring rolls, brought out the correct roll,  then charged us for their mistake. Just felt kind crappy to pay for a 50 dollar meal and then get stuck paying for something we did not order.   We have eaten at this place before and liked it, but unfortunately this will be our last time visiting this establishment."}
{"text":"When I ordered a beef sandwich, I was instead brought out a chicken sandwich.  Obviously, surprised I asked the waitress and she replied, \"we'll, I hope you like the surprise!\"  I can't make this up!   Haven't been back since.  Need some wait staff training."}
{"text":"I'm going to try to sound as professional and as objective as possible.  + Luke Warm Broth: \"Ohhhh hell naw!\" + Brown Sprouts and Wrinkly Basil Leaves: \"You're kidding, right?!\" + Stale Rice Noodles: \"Can my lunch get any worse?\" + Dried up Lime that had no more Juice: \"Definitely ohh hell naw!!!\" + Wait time for the Pho: \"Beyond ridiculous.\"  Hi Owner, I hope you are reading this.  Pho at any V-nese is absolutely the numero uno dish that must have no flaws if you want a repeat customer as myself.  I'm sorry, but the dried up lime was just blatant! There's no excuse for not having fresh limes on hand! I've had my share of cutting up limes and I know how much juice I can extract.  The standard for broth temperature should always be hotter than the sun! I should be able to finish my pho with some hot soup remaining.  Brown sprouts and wrinkly basil leaves?! Inexcusable.  Considering the place was below half full, the time for Pho to come out should be fairly quick, not 30 minutes that felt like an eternity.  Its a big time shame.  Your awesome decor can never make up for the quality of food I had last time here.  Its by far the most modern, trendiest V-nese joint I've stepped foot it in.  I respect your Crate and Barrel-like furnishings and high-end bar with TVs, but at the end of the day, it comes down to the food that I expected to shine if we are going to pay a leg and arm for.  $10 Pho?   Enough said."}
{"text":"My husband and I just had the best dinner in a long time here.    The service was top notch.   Our host and server Derrick (I'm awful with names but I *think* that was he said his name was) was informative, attentive and extremely friendly.  He didn't even flinch when I took one look at the uber-busy dining room and asked if we could sit outside instead (I shy away from crowded places) and he went out of his way to take great care of us tonight.  He gave us great service, and I am very critical about service standards.  (I mystery shopped for several years, it's to be expected from me...lol!)  The food was wonderful and because we were both new to the dish of Pho, Derrick was very informative, instructing us on the proper way to season our soups and how it's eaten.  The spring rolls were very good, I got the seared tuna roll and my husband got the vegetarian Buddha roll.    And the ginger creme brulee we split for dessert was delicious!   The ginger flavor was really intriguing and the sugar crust was perfect.  Dinner with my husband made it extra special! :-)  The one and only drawback to this place is the stucktastic parking situation.  They really need to move to a bigger place where they'll have more parking.  It is hard to even get a spot here.    So, other than having to park across the street and walk over, we had a wonderful dinner and I highly recommend this place for a nice dinner.     Note to self:  I'll have to check it out for lunch sometime!"}
{"text":"My absolutely favorite dishes at rice paper are the firecracker shrimp and the garlic noodles. You must must must order these two things when you go there!!! The rest of the food is just ok and the pho is not the best I've had or even close to it, but these shrimp and noodles are to die for. Seriously, eat them and thank me for it later. You're welcome."}
