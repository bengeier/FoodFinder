{"text":"This place is awesome!!!! My folks are always raving about Iqbal Kebab and I finally got to see why. The food is *so* quality and the portions are huge! Proper authentic Desi food, for a decent price. The service was fast and friendly, and I really loved the laid-back down-home Desi atmosphere.

I was there with two other people, for the whole table we got bhel puri, chicken tikka masala, chicken biryani, daal makhani, bhindi curry, a plate of plain basmati rice, sesame naans, sweet AND salty lassis,  soft drinks, and 2 rasmalai for dessert (YUP we came *ready* to eat!) It came up to under $70 for everything. And let me tell you, EVERYTHING was delicious and these are some generous portions! Suffice it to say that we had a LOT of leftovers.

My recommendation is the chicken biryani (and the portion is enormous! love it!) or the chicken tikka masala (if you get the masala make sure to get yourself some of that sesame naan and you're good to go).

The only complaint I have is that the rasmalai is all \"ras\" and not enough \"malai\" -- Either put less of the liquid or make the malai ball bigger. But that's not worth docking them a star because they were still delish and Iqbal Kebab just made our night so awesome :)"}
{"text":"So i went there after i had done my groceries at Iqbal's so i thought i should check this one out. Ordered Chicken biryani which they have boneless on the menu and beef wrap.
biryani rice was good, flavored but not too much and one thing good about it was that they didn't put whole spices on top of it which i really don't like coming in my mouth. Boneless pieces were of leg part of the chicken which were in good amount. They served it with tiny cup of raita which was good and salad which had nice big onion rings and lettuce.
Beef kabab wrap had 2 beef seekh they tasted good covered with some onion and lettuce and i kind of liked the bread which was nice and soft. 
So overall it was nice
Will try other things that they have on the menu in the future."}
{"text":"Feeling a little nostalgic, I decided to go for a Halwa-Puri breakfast served here on Saturday+Sunday mornings from 11am to 3pm. I'm glad to report these guys did a fine job of taking me back! 
For those unacquainted with this breakfast treat, a puri is a deep fried thin flat bread which is pretty difficult to get right. Halwa, as it's used here, refers to a sweet, gooey semolina confection. 
For $11.99, you get the breakfast combo consisting of two (large!) puris, a side of halwa, plus sides of curried potatoes and chickpeas. The puris are made fresh to order and are easily the best part of this meal. The rest of the sides were made well too, but I was a little disappointed at the lukewarm temperature they were served at from the buffet behind a glass display. All 3000 calories are served in a large, compartmentalized stainless steel tray with plasticware to assist the use of hands (no getting away with not using hands...). Seriously though, getting your hands dirty is part of the experience. 
Bon Apetit!"}
{"text":"The food is awesome! Loved the chicken biryani, naan and kabobs. The restaurant is clean too. Totally recommend this for a family night dinner!!"}
{"text":"My favourite Indian restaurant. Butter chicken and Bhiryani is very good. Been going here for over 5 years and never dissapointed"}
{"text":"Oh mama. I don't know why it's taken me so long to write a review for this place. This place has revamped itself in the nick of time. Previously, the Indian cuisine hut was literally that: A rather old, battered and tired looking space in dire need of some help. The food made up for what it lacked in appearance. But now, I can safely say that the renovations and the food are cream of the crop. 

My boyfriend and I (both of us oriental asian) come here to enjoy ourselves, and usually are not in a rush when we come. By no means are they slow, they are just not fast. The employees know us by face now, and are no strangers to the amount that we can eat. 

Our usual:
Chicken biryani 
2 kebobs
2 drinks
2 naans
1 tikka masala/ gosht curry/ butter chicken (if we're feeling adventurous, other curry dishes)

If you've ever experienced the super gross and dare instigating butter chicken, you will find justice here. The butter chicken here is the best I've had thus far, and is not topped with super thick layer of oil. The tikka masala is immersed in a rich, thick sauce that is not hard on the tongue or stomach. Their curry simply marries itself to my naan, and this naan is a dream. The consistency is just right, the combination of crispiness, taste, chewyness is absolutely incredible. 

The chicken biryani is well balanced, the right amount of chicken:spice:rice. Do be aware though, that when you are shoveling heaping spoonfuls of this mouth-watering goodness that you may be ambushed with fig seeds. But that would be your fault for not noticing. 

The sweets counter is well lit, and although it doesn't tell you what it is, the people here are helpful and give you an idea of what they are. We come every week, every two weeks at the longest and could not bare anything longer. We take our time here, but I'm sure that if you're pressed for time, a small order or calling ahead would not be a problem."}
{"text":"A few weeks ago, my friend and I stumbled upon a restaurant called Iqbal Kabob and since then, we have been returning almost every weekend. If you are not looking for a meal, drop by and try the Mango Lassi, a mango and yogurt drink. It's now my favourite beverage! 

The Butter Chicken is the best I have ever had. The chicken pieces are tender and delicious. The sauce is remarkable; creamy, savoury and full of spices. The Garlic Naan smelled wonderful and tasted great. Even though the regular Tandoori Naan (no oil and butter) is a healthier choice, it tasted just as good as the Garlic Naan. They also offer a large variety of sweets that we intend to try in the near future. 

The downside is we are never sure if we are supposed to wait for the food near the counter or at our table. The bell rings but they rarely mention the order number. As a result, they end up bringing the food to us because everyone seems confused about the process as well. Nevertheless, the staff are really friendly and helpful making you feel welcomed."}
{"text":"Had an excellent biryani rice - fresh and full of flavor, looking forward to going back to give the Karahis and BBQ a try. A nice, tidy place, friendly.  Handy that it's near Bamiyan as well b/c the latter is often so busy that it's good to have a couple of choices in the 'hood - especially if you've come on a food pilgrimage from afar by car / TTC."}
{"text":"A Very decent halal place with reasonable prices , their Tandoori Bass fish served with really well made Indian Basmati rice and Naan is a very delicious choice , accompanied by a small salad and 3 different sauces to add even more flavor. The sizzling beef and chicken platters served in twos are other flavorful and popular choices, make sure you also custom order your Naan . They have a decent selection of Indian treats and the Indian tea is a must to complete your meal at Iqbal.  Indulge eating at this place after a great grocery shopping experience at Iqbal grocery and food store :-)"}
{"text":"The food is quite flavourful and I recommend getting items of the BBQ menu, the Biryani look good too.  The food is authentic East African cuisine.  The atmosphere is simple and casual."}
{"text":"I actually learned about this place from a taxi driver!  lol. Very tasty food at reasonable prices. My wife loves the butter chicken with garlic naan bread. My favourite is the lamb briyani. It is incredibly delicious and a major meal on its own.   They renovated the place about a year ago so it has a nicer more modern decor. But I usually get take out."}
{"text":"That was the worst experience  if my life food was tasteless and the service  was wirst and at the end when we asked  to pack  the remaining  food the person who  took aour order just gave the boxes and said do it by yourself rediculous i never go back"}
{"text":"I have always liked Iqbals, especially since I moved away from home and was looking for some home cooked Pakistani meals.  The food tastes pretty much like home cooked - fresh and tasty.  I usually order nihari, kebabs, keema naan, biryani.  The butter chicken is also tasty.  The samosa's are also quite good."}
{"text":"Downtown prices (without the location or the quality). You're much better off going to Bamiyan Kebab down the street. Also, the place was filthy. At the beginning of suppertime half the tables had been left uncleared when we arrived. Ugh."}
{"text":"Eating here was a spur of the moment decision. 
This place is located next to a grocery store and apparently generates traffic this way.
There is a menu with pictures so it makes it easier to choose stuff.
I ordered chicken biryani and a chicken kebab roll as I was going to be sharing with another person.
The portion for the biryani is huge and can fulfill quite and appetite. The roll is more like small size sandwich.
Taste wise the roll was very bland. One can adjust the spice level as there are 3 kind of condiments available for use. 
The Biryani was actually quite decent. Lotsa meat and spiced well.
This is more like a fast food place so don't be expecting anything exotic."}
{"text":"Love this place. I drop by at least once a month. Usually get both beef and chicken kebabs, daal, chicken biriyani, tikka and naan. They have a great family deal for $35. Which includes a lot of food for 3-4 people. Their naan is huge and probably the best I've ever had. Daal is excellent with a pinch of cilantro. The kebabs are always very good but I prefer the chicken over beef since the beef tends to be a bit on the dry side. Portion sizes are decent especially the biriyani which is massive and loaded with lots of big chicken pieces. 
If you haven't been here before, it's a must try."}
{"text":"My favourite restaurant in town very good quality food always fresh and delicious must try the chicken Biryaniee best of the best worth every penny"}
{"text":"So if you're lucky then you'll get fresh cooked food, otherwise microwave:-(. I like their lamb paya but again if it's fresh. Biryani is good too. It's a little pricy. I wish they prepared fresh cooked food everyday"}
{"text":"This place charge you so much for small portion sizes. You can probably pay little less for a bigger portion at some other restaurants. Food is just OK taste wise.  I would rather drive a little farther down to Shaheen Tikka if I really wanna spend my buck."}
{"text":"I've always passed by this place on my way to work so I decided to check it out on a weeknight to grab a quick bite. I ordered a chicken tikka roll which was wrapped in a very nice chewy naan, I really liked how tender the chicken was. They don't offer the yogurt sauce for this but be sure to ask for some, it makes a difference when combined. Prices are pretty average but considering the portion size, it's a tad higher than the other restaurants in the city. This place is worth checking out if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Service is so so. Environment is family but fast food (Styrofoam and plastic dinnerware) But the food is worth it! Naan is the BEST in the city as far as I know. 
Bon apetite!"}
{"text":"Love the Saturday Sunday breakfast!! if you want to enjoy good food sit and eat there.  Naan taste much better sitting there, and Halwa puri, nihari breakfast.  the staff is very stubborn and thinks that it's our first time eating Desi food.  I don't like that type of customer service.  If something is bad, it's bad!! but if the cook himself didn't talk to us I would have given this 2 star.  3 Nihari, 5 Halwa/puri Breakfast, and 6 Naan cost around $90.  Trust me you want to sit there and eat!!"}
{"text":"The food here was ok...we ordered the chicken biryani and Haleem. The chicken biryani portion was large (enough for 3 people). The taste was average. The haleem was very disappointing, not even one piece of meat in there, not to mention very spicy. We  wanted rusmalai for dessert, but the lady at the counter wasn't sure if they had it--- how do you not know if you don't have something?? Also, $2 for 1 piece seems very pricy! I'm used to very good Pakistani food in my area and was hoping this was comparable."}
{"text":"I only go here for the palak paneer and the butter chicken. If you like palak paneer - this is probably one of the best I've ever had at this location. Spices are right. Extremely flavourful though portion sizes are small. One of the best Pakistani places I've been to. If you have kids, they serve decent portion size kebab with fries for about $4.50+tax I believe. Great alternative to fast food and it will fill them up if they're under 13. I was surprised the fries weren't just regular cut fries. The skin of the fries have a kind of crunchy look to them and tasted good. Service was great too, though we waited 15 mins for our food. Friday nights after 8pm seem to be less busy."}
{"text":"The best lamb curry and butter chicken curry I've had in all my 33 years of living in Toronto.
Lamb was melt-in-your mouth.  Will definitely go back.  Will recommend this place to
anyone and everyone who enjoys curry!"}
{"text":"Decided to be spontaneous and go to Iqbals for their halwa puri with chana.  Tucked in the Thorncliffe neighborhood in East York Iqbal's has served the ever changing demographics of this neighborhood.  Its spacious, and clean environment, along with two partioned booths for family who prefer to eat in privacy provides a classic Pakistani/ indian breakfast/ brunch menu.  I had their Halwa puri with chana, and potato curry.  We also ordered their Payal curry, and lamb curry served with a huge pizza sized naan.  Taste, flavor was bang on! however $9 per bowl of curry was quite pricey however good food doesnt have a price tag.  :) overall great place to come try and eat."}
{"text":"Great takeout and eat in Indian. Quality can vary but naans are good, and most curries ok. Butter chicken is consistently good. Call ahead - they can be slow when busy if picking up."}
{"text":"It's pretty good.  My wife and I go for the Halwa Puri breakfast sometimes.  They open pretty early (9am) for brown people.  The only thing I don't like is peppercorns in my channa masala!  Especially if it's in the morning with the Halwa Puri combo."}
{"text":"Definitely a good spot Indian food and among my favourites. Alhough it's not the most convenient location (imo), the food is well worth the trip. It's a neat, clean restaurant with plenty of seating inside. Not quite as fancy as The Host or as rough-around-the-edges as Lahore Tikka House. Price wise it's somewhere in the middle as well, and the portion sizes are great. 

Recommended: Lamb chops, chicken or lamb biryani, butter chicken, Ras Malai and all their sauces!
Meh: Kebabs (surprising given the name of the restaurant but I prefer the kebabs at Lahore Tikka House). 

The food is flavourful without being overly spicy or greasy. Their indian sweets are supposedly very good...I dont have much of a sweet tooth but I do enjoy their rus malai...the only item I have tried. 

Hope this helps!"}
{"text":"I had takeout. I ordered: butter chicken ($10), palak paneer ($7.50), and two naans with no oil ($1.50 each).

Value/Portion Sizes: The portion sizes were tiny. The two naans were quite little for $1.50. Also, $10 and $7.50 for the two dishes?! You can get more for your money at other places. This would be okay if they came with a salad, rice, or something to make up for the very small amount of food I got. However, that must all be purchased separately. If only the portion sizes were reasonable for how much I paid, I would give this restaurant a better rating.

Butter Chicken: This was very tasty, and it was the \"sweeter\" kind of butter chicken which I am a big fan of. It was, however, a little too oily. However, it was without a doubt one of the most delicious butter chickens I have ever tasted. But please, go easy on the oil next time.

Palak Paneer: Just like the butter chicken, this one was very delicious. However, this one did not have an excessive amount of oil, which is great! It was perfect really. In fact, it's the most delicious palak paneer I have ever tasted...so far. Creamy, full of flavour, and a good amount of paneer (cheese) was in it.

Naan: Delicious, and not oily, like the restaurant claims.

OVERALL: The food is delicious, it's just a shame that the portion sizes are too small for what you pay!

Note: I want to try the buffet; I think it'll be a much better deal."}
{"text":"I've been driving past this place for a few years and never had an excuse to go in. I forgot about it for a while. Then my friend S started telling me we needed to go to ... I thought she called it \"Eight-Ball\". So we drove down there and I was like, \"Ohhhh IQBAL. Yes, I've wanted to go here for a while.\"

She's Bengali and she said the curry here would not be like the Indian food I'm used to. I'm always up for new curry. The place looks a bit fast-foody but is bright and roomy, with lots of seating. There are little private curtained rooms for families if women want to take off their hijab. The place was deserted at 9 pm on a Wednesday, and they close at 10:30. 

So, S was right about the curry. I've never had anything called butter chicken that tasted like this. The chicken was coloured red and swimming in a thick pinkish sauce that was loaded with herbs. This is not the tomato-soupy stuff you get in food courts, this is a real sensory overload experience. If you like butter chicken you'll probably like this, and may not be able to go back. The biryani was a huge heap of golden-brown rice studded with cilantro and veggies, and underneath it all there were big chunks of falling-apart chicken.

Those two things, plus an order of naan and two drinks, set us back about thirty bucks. We were pretty stuffed for having just had a late evening snack meal. The only problem was I ordered a lassi and it never showed up, either on the table or on the bill. I'll try again next time, because there will definitely be a next time."}
{"text":"I regularly step in to Iqbal Kebab and Sweets, as it's just next door to a supermarket I frequent. The place itself is really well maintained but experiences extreme shifts as far as how busy it gets. There are times when I've walked in to find all of one person in the entire place, other times I can never get a seat (mainly in the late evening). 

The prices are actually $2 - $3 more expensive than haandi or bamiyan which are within 2 minutes walk, but i suppose you're paying for the ambiance and dining experience. The only real gripe I have, is that there are times when the meat tastes off, as if it was marinated and left in the fridge for a couple of days longer than it should have been. I know it's common practice for kabab houses to leave the seasoned raw meat in the fridge overnight and it will last a few days, but anything longer and it will have a strong and distinct smell/taste.

Overall, it's a decent place though from time to time there are quality and freshness issues. I just wished that they were more competitive."}
{"text":"a must try lamb biryani here.The service is drastically poor n heating too.but They make good food n naans"}
{"text":"Food: I was disappointed in their beef ribs. They looked thick and juicy in the picture up on the wall, but in reality, they turned out to be thin and dry. Not cool :(

Their chicken biryani and daal makhani was a different story. Both were extremely tasty. I wish the chicken they serve was organic, 'cause I bet you they use conventional chicken to save $$. Whether it's Halal or not makes no difference. I hope to see more restaurants being transparent about what kind of animal products (organic or conventional) go into the preparation of meals. So far, I'm not really seeing any restaurants in Toronto proactively being transparent about their choices of animal products.

Service: Nothing really to complain about."}
{"text":"3.5
it is an ok Pakistani bbq fast food. prices are not that cheap (compared to more fancy places where rice and/or salad are often included in the price for most meat items... not here), but the food is really really fresh and served super hot, out of the oven. hence, why not..."}
