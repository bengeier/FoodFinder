{"text":"My girlfriend and I treated ourselves to the 2pm tea and had such a lovely time.  The service was very friendly but is not fast.  The whole experience should be Savored and not rushed so I'd attend with someone you enjoy talking to!  The food was excellent and we tried 5 different teas in total.  We had a crazy time parking due to an event at the hotel but the server was so kind about it and gave us some tea to take home for our \"trouble\".  I thought this was above & beyond and was surprised by the gesture.  I'd recommend it and would love to go again soon!"}
{"text":"Ordered food from my room for direct pick-up at Frank & Albert's in the hotel lobby and received excellent customer service.  Very friendly staff and excellent food.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Stole my iPod!! I was staying in a villa with my bestfriend that was getting married at the biltmore, had my iPod plugged in with the cord. We checked into a different room, still at the biltmore! Called the front desk literally within an hour of leaving the villa and ask to go back and get the iPod and they said they would send someone to pick it up and  bring it to me. Surpise they returned the cable cord but said they didn't see an iPod. I filed a report with their security and after 2 weeks of calling and calling with no one returning my calls they say their insurance has denied the claim... Is that my problem? You think you pay for a luxury hotel and this is the service you get, beware!"}
{"text":"My husband and I held our wedding at the Arizona Biltmore on April 2nd, 2011. The catering staff was amazing, and everything was provided to us to our satisfaction. We stayed in one of the villas for our wedding night and the room was absolutely amazing. They had chilled champagne and chocolates waiting for us when we arrived, and the whirlpool tub was absolutely what we needed after a very long day. We ordered room service in the morning and it was excellent. Great hotel, beautiful property, and great staff."}
{"text":"The resort is by far one of the absolute best.  It has a feel of old school Hollywood to it, with all the modern amenities.  I cannot give it five stars because of the front desk.  The clerk was surprised when we asked how to get to our room, as though she could not be bothered.  At no time did she welcome us, offer a map of the resort or assistance - extremely disappointing."}
{"text":"I recently held an event for 250 in the Grand Ballroom. The staff from start to finish went beyond the call of duty. The tables were set before the time expected. Which is always nice when your the event planner and your worried whether things are being taken care of. We went with a plated meal and the food was served hot and presented well. Everything with the valet went very smooth.   We had several A/V needs. Swank Audio Visuals hit a home run! Ashley, Dirk, and and Paul know there trade and bring a wonderful level of customer service."}
{"text":"I am here for a conference stayed one night and am looking for another hotel.  Rooms are nice, bed is very comfortable, but they are nothing special. No in-room coffee maker.    The staff is another story.  So far they have been unhelpful and some down right rude. When I drove up there were several Bell man, but no one came to help me.  I had to go to the bell desk and ask for help.  (I should add that I have a broken ankle and leg in a boot) During check-in I specifically asked for a room with a view.  I was given a room with a view of the front roof. I could seriously ONLY see the roof of the front overhand.  I called down to change rooms and no one answered the phone ever. I had to walk back down to the Lobby.  When I changed rooms I left something back in the other room and needed to have security let me in.  He was so rude it was shocking.  I said something apologizing for the inconvenience and he literally turned his head and did not say one word. I repeated myself b/c I thought he must not have heard me and he did the same thing.  No smile, no that's okay ma'am, nothing. No handicap accessible self-parking. Self-parking garage was full due to a prom at the hotel and several hundred yards away. VERY disappointed."}
{"text":"I wanted to be fair and give an update to the review I wrote last week. I received a call from a manager at the hotel, Beth, and she was really receptive to my feedback and extremeley apologetic. She treated me with the respect and sincere concern that EACH guest deserves on EVERY visit. It is just as I suspected and the Ocatilla section was full that evening. We both agreed that an honest explanation, given initially before lying to me,  would've been the most appropriate way to handle the situation. I was able to voice my issues and I received an appropriate apology. Thank you Beth for the follow up.   I would hope that no one else has the experience that I had, but I know that things happen. Accountability, humility, and respect for guests is what keeps a hotel in business.  I know for a fact that the Biltmore doesn't want to be considered just another hotel, so perhaps they will step it up in customer service consistency. They have a rich history behind them so they really need to go above and beyond and live up to their Waldorf Astoria backing. While talking to Beth, I agreed to give the hotel another chance to make things right and I'm confident the next time will be better.  But if not, you all will hear about it. :-)"}
{"text":"Don't bother.  Visit the grounds and stay somewhere else... So called upgraded rooms are tired.  I have stayed at the Waldorf Astoria in NYC and this is considered one of their Premiere Properties..  From the outside and grounds maybe from the standard or upgraded rooms in the Villas  .. no way."}
{"text":"It's a pretty cool place but I just couldn't give in that extra star due to the rooms I was staying it.  I felt that sections of the rooms I was in haven't been updated sense Nancy and Ronald Reagan had their honeymoon there.  My room didn't even have a coffee maker but it did have  scale (weird)."}
{"text":"I was very excited to stay at here being an architectural fan. I did love the building and the grounds.  However, the service and overall stay was horrible from start to finish. This started with the bell service who forgot to bring my bags to my room. After they pointed me in the wrong direction for parking the car and walking back to the lobby in 100 plus degree heat to check in I had to walk back to the bell desk out front to ask them to bring my bags up after they never showed up in my room. The room was hot and the AC turned up full blast was completely inadequate. The shower somehow only got extremly hot water, which is not fun when the AC doesn't work. Later that night, before going out to dinner, I put a card out for breakfast in the morning. When we returned from diner I noticed the card had not been picked up. I went to the lobby to tell the front desk. The front desk took my room number and insiste they would send someone right up to get it and not to worry because my breakfast would be there in the morning. When we woke up the card was still on the door and no breakfast was delivered.   Although the grounds and building are beatiful you don't need to stay here to see that. I was so excited to stay here and in the end I couldn't wait to leave. HORRIBLE!"}
{"text":"Just checked in and this is not a 5 star waldorf hotel by hilton standards or by any hotel standards.  Highly disappointing. The valet/bell service was excellent but the front desk is a 2 star. We have stayed at several hiltons as diamond members and every hilton made great efforts to help make our stay better. The front reception here made no effort to make our stay more amenable to why we came here in the first place.  We were given the farthest possible room in the back of the ground in a very shoddily landscaped area of the resort grounds when we requested (at booking) to be near the conference rooms where the tournament our kids are here playing in. The grounds are large. Its a long hike from any parking or lobby in 110 degree heat. The rooms are gray, bare bones and facing a concrete building. Any request was cut short with no effort to help us find a resolution. Highly do not recommend staying here.Its not a Waldorf quality hotel. Barely a 2 star. There are much better hilton resorts in the phoenix area that loyal hilton members would find has better trained front desk/customer service and better rooms."}
{"text":"I agree with Linda and Nathan.  There were some aspects of this resort that are so amazing.  But the missing 1 star is because the lobby staff / customer service could use improvement.  We came as a group and had multiple rooms.   The resort itself has potential to be 5 stars.  Waiting until customers post 1 star reviews before responding is poor strategy."}
{"text":"I'm an architect, and learned about this place when I was in school. It was wonderful to finally get a chance to stay here. The design is wonderful, from the overall planning down to the smallest details - anyone who appreciates good architecture should stay here at least once in their life.  The services at this resort were also excellent, and I thought were very reasonably priced. I was happily surprised that it was so child-friendly, as this did not seem to be emphasized on their website. They have a great little water slide, plenty of organized kids activities, and even movies at the main pool on weekends. There's also a kids room, with sporting equipment, games, and the like. My kids had a blast, and begged to stay longer!  The adult services are also excellent, with adult classes every day, organized activities, and a very nice spa. They even bring you a nice glass of sweet tea after a workout. Of course you pay for classes, massages, and the like, but the spa is fee. And everything can by paid by room number, which is of course convenient when ordering a beer in the pool.  The only downside is that the restaurants on site are quite expensive, given the quality of the food. We didn't eat in the fanciest one, which looked like you actually needed to get dressed up for, both the others spots, including the cafe, were really overpriced. The one meal that I wished we'd had was the Sunday brunch - it looked amazing.  Anyway, we stayed in the north-most building, which was a bid secluded from the center of activity, and had it's own nice little pool and hot tub. It was of course cheaper, due to the schlep, but not unreasonable. And it meant we had to stop for s'mores every night on the way to the pool!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately I think the bad outweighs the good with this older property.  I was there for a work conference and had the bad luck of getting a room with a broken AC on the roof.  The AC worked but it made such a loud noise that I couldn't sleep.  The workers that came to fix it charged into my room while I was in bed taking a nap.  The door was fully locked, but the latch lock was also broken!  Needless to say that was terrifying.  I reported it to management and they were not very sympathetic.  They said I would be compensated and they haven't done it even after several follow-ups.  Very disappointing on so many levels."}
{"text":"I want to classify I normally stay at Hampton Inn's but have also stayed in very nice hotels all over the world.  I choose to stay here because of the history of architecture.  I will say I have stayed at other Waldorf and RItz Carlton properties and this doesn't even come close to the upscale hotel you would expect. (but I didn't pay the price of those either)  I stayed in a hampton inn down the street for 2 nights before and the bed and pillows were actually much more comfortable at the hampton inn.  The pool area had broken chairs which I thought was weird because you have to pay a $resort fee each night to stay there.  If you are expecting old world charm and great architecture, stay here.  If you are expected to be pampered and have great amenities pass this place up because it won't meet your expectations.  It is worth a one night stay just to say you have been there and look at this history of the hotel."}
{"text":"The Biltmore is a really cool hotel, although I have to admit I never actually stayed here. We came to hang out at the gorgeous pool(s)-- which by the way, has the coolest water slide that people of all ages can go down! I can act like a kid! So we got there relatively early morning/afternoon but already the chairs had those blue towels on them (aka, those chairs are reserved). It took a good twenty minutes to find a family who was leaving to get three empty chairs. And it's not like there were actually people there-- it was not busy at all, but we realized that people just wake up early, throw their towels on chairs to save them, then come back whenever they feel like it. Luckily, the staff eventually noticed this and went around collecting the towels to free up some chairs.  We got some drinks and appetizers at the poolside bar. The service was not great; there was one woman working the bar and about 7 or 8 people just waiting around for her to take their order. Our three drinks and chips/salsa took at least 20 minutes to get. Even after she gave our drinks, it took her another 10 minutes to run our credit card and give us the tab. They should really have at least 2 people working the bar. On the plus side, they do go around the pool area and take orders from people so you don't even really need to move...  We also came one evening to the restaurant/bar where all those huge fire pits are. Not busy at all, good service (though a little pricey), and the fire was a nice way to keep warm and enhance the atmosphere. We got to take a look at one of the cottages but I wasn't that impressed. Guess I had a high expectation because it's the Biltmore, but the room was like any other hotel room, nothing special. I'm sure there's nicer rooms though.  All in all, I would return here for both the pool and the bar... but not necessarily the poolside bar."}
{"text":"The Biltmore has the bones to be a great hotel, something many modern hotels with crimped lobbies will never have.  The Frank Lloyd Wright inspired architecture has a distincitve look and feel that brings a smile to most people with a sense of creativity.  A cozy bar with indoor / outdoor seating, excellent breakfasts at Frank & Alberts, clean pool with attentive service.  Cannot give it 5 stars for several reasons.  The room was large and clean but none of the outlets worked well, an inexpensive repair that should have been fixed.  AC was feeble and the hotel nickels & dimes you on things like water bottles.  I would stay again and hope the mgmt reads these reviews and makes small changes to lift one of the most distinctive properties around back into the top ranks."}
{"text":"I am staying here now and the holiday decor is beautiful. This is a lovely historic hotel. Christmas trees in rows elaborate gingerbread houses. Just a great place to get into the Christmas spirit."}
{"text":"This is a nice historic hotel, though I'm not sure if if it lives up to the \"five star\" status.    The hotel has a very \"Frank Llyod Wright\" feel to it.  It is a big hotel with lots of history behind it.  Most presidents have been here, per their wall right by Frank and Alberts.  The grounds were impeccable, it took us forever to walk to our room.  They have so many wings, and walking to your room is eerie at night, since the grounds are not well lit at all.  They had some nice pools that we didn't take advantage of.  All in all, it's a very nice hotel, but it's not a 5-star property.  Stay only if rate is reasonable."}
{"text":"Upon entering the lobby, your first impression is: wow. It's beautiful here, you have arrived. The receptionist and valet were professional and attentive. The courtyard was impressive with mountain view in the background and is one of a kind.  The room was spacious and the decor in the room made it feel relaxing and comfortable. We would definitely come back. Didn't have time to try the restaurants here."}
{"text":"Nice, but not on my top ten list of finer resorts in the Phoenix area.  This hotel is quickly becoming very dated.  The rooms are not at all modern.  They are quite the contrary; old, including the room furniture and room decor.  While this may have been stylish location 15+ years ago, time has passed the Biltmore by.    Our room was large, but it was also dark; not enough lamps in the room to provide more lighting.  The closet ceiling light operated with a pull chain, which if you're shorter than 5'5\" tall, good luck reaching it.  The bed was extremely soft and saggy, and the pillows were like bricks.  Carpeting could have used some cleaning as well.  In addition, our room do not have a full length mirror.   Even a room at a Fairfield Inn comes with a full length mirror.  While the grounds are quite wonderful, beware of the scorpions.  We had such a visitor in our room one afternoon.  Thankful we saw him as he saw us.   Food and drinks are grossly overpriced, so I would recommend dining off this location.    If you require Wi-Fi srrvice, their complimentary service is more miss, than hit.  However, their pay for Wi-Fi works just fine.  Just another overpriced service and fee they can nail you into paying if you require Internet access.  I believe there are far better options in this price range in the Phoenix area.  This location is not on my return list."}
{"text":"While facilities are nice the course itself is lack luster. Open layout, tee boxes are fine, fairways and rough are fine as well.   The bad part! The greens! Unplayable. I felt like I was back in 1940. No point of getting it on the green when the insane length of the greens won't give you a chance. Pass. Played my 18 holes and got out!!"}
{"text":"We were there for a conference in 2011 and it was by far the best hotel I have ever stayed in.  The staff is amazing and the property is astounding.  Their attention to detail goes above and beyond anything you could expect.  It feels like you have stepped back into a different era."}
{"text":"Always a good time here whether I'm chillin or hoppin.  Free wi-fi w/a room."}
{"text":"I am reviewing a visit that has impressed me so much that weeks after we had tea it stands in my mind as a notable experience.   My wife and I travel often. We enjoy fine foods, great service, and class. We were very impressed with the fabulous host of the Arizona Biltmore High Tea Service when we were there for our anniversary. Kevin was absolutely wonderful, friendly, warm, gracious, and an utter professional. This kind of service can only be found at the finest restaurants. It is akin to the high level service we had at Mugaritz in San Sebastián. Kevin is a rare treat. It was an absolute surprise to have this kind of attention to detail for tea. All teas were served and paired wonderfully well. All of our inquiries into everything from the service, tea history, pairing recommendations, preferences, and such received warm explanation and conversation. It was so wonderful to meet someone who it is evident from their enthusiasm and attention cares and loves doing the job they do so well. I wish we had service by Kevin everywhere we go. This service is truly world class. We will definitely return."}
{"text":"I'm writing the review for the high tea. I would not recommend this to anyone. We had attended friend's wedding there, we had stayed there couple of times, we love the services, the hotel grounds, facilities and restaurant. But as for the tea service, it was a total disappointment. I think the afternoon tea at Phoenician is a MUCH better choice than having tea at Biltmore. First, they messed up our reservation, my husband made a reservation for us, my parents and also my 4 yrs old son, total of 5. Turned out Kelvin said there was only a reservation of 2. No big deal, so we waited at the lobby at least 15 mins for him to set up the table. But he didn't acknowledged us when the table was ready until my husband went to ask him and he said it was ready. He didn't even probably seat us, just simply pointed at the table and said it was ready. I mean this is a 5 star hotel and that was just simply ridiculous. We sat down and waited and waited, Kelvin never came by our table to greet us. he seemed very busy entertaining other customers, but to my expectation, at least he should show some courtesy to let us know he would be right with us. I don't mind his slow service, i don't mind the reservation was messed up, but we all felt that we were treated poorly. We sat there for another 10 mins watching him chit-chatting with other customers, then we decided to leave. This was the first time ever we've ever done this. It was not the slow service, but the quality of the service was very poor. I can't rate for the food, but according to my friends, they said their expectation was higher than received on the food. I would say if you're willing to pay $50 on tea, go Phoenician. They have much better services and those sandwiches and sweets are so wonderful there!"}
{"text":"We decided to take advantage of a December $99 special to have a night at the Arizona Biltmore before Christmas. What a disappointment! When we checked in, they asked us where we wanted to stay on the property. They DID NOT offer any explanation of what was avilable, where it was located, etc. We just needed to read their mind, apparently! As it was raining,we choose to stay in the main building. They gave us a room but when we went up to the floor, housekeeping was still in the room! We went back downstairs and were given another roo - by a very disgruntled desk clerk (with a lovely -not- view of the roof). We got settled and then realized we had no heat - (it was an unusually cold, rainy day in AZ) and a light burned out in the bathroom. Maybe we were in a Super 8! We called the desk and they said they would get someone up to look at it. ONE HOUR LATER, a man finally showed up. By now the room was freezing and very uncomfortable.  We wanted to take a walk around the property and asked if there was a guide or map available. They gave us - I kid you not  - a map on basically a 3x3 card. You could see buildings but certainly none of the labels. At this point, we were beginning to think that the $99 deal is no deal. You can stay there but don't expect ANY service or friendliness. Trying to shake off our disappointment, we decide to go get something to eat. We ate at Frank and Albert's - another mistake. Soup ordered was barely warm. Very little on the menu for vegetarians, lackluster service, VERY noisy restaurant. All in all, we won't be back.  We have stayed at The Boulders in Cave Creek before and our experience there was what you would expect of a Waldorf Astoria property. Beautiful facility - friendly, helpful staff. The Biltmore was the exact opposite. Staff was cold and unfriendly, the accommodations were hugely disappointing. We will never return and we will never recommend this facility to any of our guests."}
{"text":"My wife and I had friends visiting from California, so booked some spa appointments about a month out and planned to spend the day at the pool.  Luckily (we thought) my wife called to confirm the appointments the week before and found that they had both the times and the treatments wrong.  The spa representative corrected them and we thought all was well.  As we were driving up to the hotel at about 1:10 for our 2:00 appointments, the telephone rang, asking where we were and why we weren't there yet.  We explained the earlier mixup and that our appointments were actually at 2:00.  The reply was \"sorry, there is nothing we can do now.\" We asked to see the manager and got a \"really sorry, we don't have any openings.\"  Apparently the Biltmore is not responsible for their own ineptitude.  Half our group ended up getting no spa treatments at all.  Guess what they offered us in compensation....they covered the spa gratuity...gee, thanks.  After ruining our day, you covered the gratuity for your own employees.  No discount, no promise of future compensation, nada.  I'd like to mention that all areas of the spa have the styling of a high school locker room crossed with a Motel 6.  Sad.      We wandered over to the pool to use the cabana we had rented for the day for about $250.  The last time the cabanas were renovated was about 1986 based on the condition and the decor.  I'm not sure how they were able to acquire the frost-filled fridge from my college dorm room, but there it was, right along with the 20 year old tube TV! The interior was in bad need of painting, as there was peeling and mildew in many areas.  It really takes away from the whole experience.  Sorry Biltmore, you are a shade of your former self.        My advice is to drive a few miles to Montelucia where you will find an elegant, up to date spa with great therapists, for the same price.  The pool and cabanas there are absolutely beautiful."}
{"text":"Spring Break - another weekend at the pool. Scott, Nick and their crew have done a great job, all with a smile and a thank-you. The water is crystal clear, the weather is nice and we're having a great time. Thank you  :)"}
{"text":"I recently stayed here with my wife during New Year's Eve.  We were in town for a wedding at the Biltmore and had a great rate.  The place is fantastic, but the room was a bit disappointing.  The TV had many stations scrambled.  We didn't plan to stay in our room for too long because we wanted to do stuff, but a scrambled channels at The Biltmore is a big negative.  Our shower had trouble draining.  We were only staying two nights so we didn't contact the front desk about it.  The maid didn't come to clean our room until 4:45.  We had wanted to get ready for the 6:30 wedding around that time, so we had to wait nearly 20 mins while she cleaned our room.  We just stayed in the room while she cleaned; awesome.  The next morning, the maid knocked on our around 9:30.  We weren't exactly pleased about that.    All told, a nice place to stay but we were a bit disappointed in a few areas.  I was expecting to be overwhelmed by the venue and service.  I guess my expectations were too high."}
{"text":"Sadly, I can only give the Biltmore 3 stars. The architecture and the grounds were lovely, however the service was lacking. For the most part, the staff were indifferent, uninformed, and unhelpful. Go for the pools, the building itself, and outdoor life-size chess/checker board."}
{"text":"Is this place gay?? Its tottaly color cordinated from the decorations to the guests. I love the various retail outlets located on the lower plaza level. I never realized they had a panda express there too. A little commercial for my taste, but still has a unique feel. The landscaping is well maintained and the cooking class is original. Cheers!"}
{"text":"A beautiful, sprawling resort with lush landscaping and stately architecture. So luxurious, you'll forget that you're in the desert. Make time for afternoon tea during your stay. Definitely one of the most decadent tea services ever."}
{"text":"If you get a room in the main hotel it is very noisy due to the atrium. We suffered until after 12:30am and also called the front desk to complain. Bad nights sleep."}
{"text":"Overall, our stay was lovely. We had a rough start at the beginning, mostly because the self parking is way off to the side of the property, and despite verbal directions and a map, we got so lost trying to find our way back that a very friendly hotel staff member picked us (and our luggage) up in her cart and drove us to the right place. Once there, it felt like a ghost town, the pool was out of service, and the whole environment was a far cry from the opulence of the lobby. Luckily we ran into some family members (we were there for a wedding) and realized we were in a remote building. A quick call to the front desk, and we were promptly moved to the building near the pool and all the other guests. From then on, everything was fantastic. Our rooms (we had two) were both very nice. Dinner at Wrights was out of this world. Service was outstanding. The wedding reception was held at the hotel, and the staff and the food were great. And as I was walking from the room to the reception, I saw a fire pit out on the grounds with an elegant, staffed table nearby with (how fun is this?) marshmallows and marshmallow forks for roasting! I so wished I could have taken even ten minutes to enjoy it! Breakfast at the second on-site restaurant, Frank and Albert's, was also spot on. The french toast prompted everyone to pull out phones for pictures, and the service was truly splendid. I could go on and on, from the beautiful architecture to the poolside service (how can they be so pleasant in the July heat and a hundred guests needing attention?) to the sheer beauty of the grounds and the fact that they have on-site, all organic gardens for the restaurants, to \"dive-in\" movies at the pool on Saturday nights, to...to....well...you'll just have to go and see for yourself. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Be warned...if you get a room in the main building, you will not be allowed to sleep until 11PM on Thursday night, as they have a loud lounge singer in the lobby. Our goal of a good night's sleep before an early flight were shattered as I was awoke to \"I'm leavin on a jet plane\" booming throughout my room. A great vacation is ruined, as we lay here waiting for this noise to end.  Last time I make this mistake."}
{"text":"Beautiful grounds and exciting architecture are not supported by great service or accommodations.  Service in particular was lacking in several ways.  Greeting and farewell at front desk were not particularly warm or gracious. Attention to detail by restaurant staff in preparing a private party was lacking and we needed to follow up with them several times to make sure they delivered as promised. Unlike other top resort hotels, service is not polished or personal.    The rooms in the Ocatilla building are fine but not particularly well designed. The shower door, bathroom door, and door to the toilet all collided. Our patio was very small and practically useless. The lounge for the Ocatilla building was pretty nice but very far from our room. Strangely,the concierge for the lounge didn't recognize us on our third day. It kind of epitomizes the level of service at the Biltmore.    When we checked out, I noticed we had been charged for 6 days of Internet services for a four day stay.  As the registration desk person removed two of the charges, he said that Internet was actually complimentary but since I had agreed to be charged, I was stuck with the charges.   On the plus side, the hotel is a architectural treasure and the food we had in the restaurants was above average.    I'd like to say we'd stay here again, but I'm afraid there are just too many alternatives in Phoenix that are providing a much higher level of customer service."}
{"text":"10 of us hired a limo and made a reservation for the High Tea at the Arizona Biltmore.  The only thing that was pleasant was the limo ride.  After arriving and making our way to the tea, there was no one at the desk to seat us.  We finally had to go to inside and flag down a server to find out where everyone was.  After a few minutes, we were seated.  The 10 of us waited for over 10 minutes before we were recognized by a server.  After another 15 minutes, we had the tea delivered and plopped on the table.  We were left to serve the tea ourselves.  When the food came, 20 minutes later, the scones were good, but everything else was at best mediocre.  The sandwiches were dry and basically not eatable.  The server indicated that we could have as much as we wanted, but failed to return to the table to replenish our tea, water, and food.    The only thing they got right was the automatic 18% gratuity charged along with our $418 bill.  Our group has been to 4 teas at different establishments in Phoenix and the tea at the Biltmore was by FAR the worst.   If you're thinking of going I would strongly advise against it.  RL Phoenix"}
{"text":"I stayed at this hotel on June 3 to June 5.  While the architecture, and the fact that it is tightly linked with the genius that is Frank Lloyd Wright, is worth at least a night's stay, the overall experience is somewhat confusing and a mish-mash forcing one to ponder whether one has experienced an elite bastion of resort history or a dying emblem of what might have been.   I stayed at the Ocatilla -- the \"hotel within a hotel.\"  The room was well-appointed and delightfully lush compared with my friends' off-the-rack accommodations which appeared somewhat worn and needing refurbishment.    As part of the Ocatilla, one is promised amenities such as a shoe-shine and pressing service.  None of which was ever offered, nor seemed realistically obtainable.    The Ocatilla executive club room was tightly guarded. Indeed, when my room key would not open the club room door, I was asked for my name and room number and I was somewhat humbled that I just might have entered under dubious circumstances.  The offerings for breakfast were carbohydrates only, with an exception for yogurt in a martini glass.  And I did see at least two gusts bring in their own cereal.   The swimming pool near my room, one of several on the property, was delightful.  As I'm not much for Phoenix sunlight, we reveled in the salt water pool at night.  With few people present, it was a great deal of fun and was by far the most fun I've had in a while.   The spa was not so delightful.  The men's locker room was eery, with lockers being close to the door.  To walk into such a small area with retiree genitalia flailing may be entertaining to some, but can be somewhat disturbing for those with higher expectations.  The attendants that were on staff ranged from over-reaching (acceptable) to a too-young apprentice who I overheard talking with a loud-mouthed receptionist about the horrors of toilet paper remnants lodged in women's pubic hair.  While anyone able to afford the high prices should be strong, who among us should be that strong?   The spa's manicurist was terrific.  I just wished there would have been a more private area in which to have my hooves trimmed.  Passersby were gawking through the windows and it reminded me of a cheap Asian nail establishment in the Indianapolis mall.   My overall experience memory stems from my initial check-in experience.  The Waldorf sent an E-mail after I had made my reservation that said that, if available, when I checked in I could spend an additional  $20 to be upgraded.  When I mentioned this to the desk clerk she had no idea what I wa talking about and said: \"Well, you already have an Ocatilla executive room.\"  Though I was silent, my reply should have been: \"Honey, if you told me I could have something a little better for twenty bucks, then make it happen.\"  Oversold.  Under-delivered.   That I was with friends a week after my mother's death was cool.  But the physical experience was lacking.  My opinion only, but I think this property was built for a timeless level of service that time and numbed expectations will deny her."}
{"text":"Okay. Let's go. Spa - yes. Horseback riding - yes. Oldschool - oh yes.  I feel like Rita Hayworth when I come here. I don't really know why. I just do. Perhaps a clandestine meeting with Orson? A bite at the pharmacy like grill? Is that me in that cowboy hat? Might just be.  Truly am surprised to see negative reviews of this place. It's so utterly charming. From the lovely pinkness of it, to the tiled pools, to the excellent staff. I really love it.  You can get several different kinds of massage at the spa. I'm a Swedish girl, all the way. And after an hour long massage they practically had to mop me up and wring me into bed. It was just that good.  Walking around here can be a little iffy. I saw a rattler once. But it's still just so lovely. So don't be hating on the Biltmore. It's an original and there are very few places like it in this land of ours. That, and, feeling like Rita Hayworth is priceless."}
{"text":"Horrible! I've been coming here 6 years and this year was the pro bowl and our hallway smelled very strong of weed and it went into our room. Got a horrible headache and walk in the hallway and all they do is spray. Went to tell the front desk and all they said was ya we had a lot of complaints..... so all they care about is their football guests not everyone else who  goes there every year.. cutomer service?  Very disappointed  going to try and have the company party at a different  resort next year.."}
{"text":"Such a beautiful property. Its so relaxing and peaceful. The Frank Loyd Wright architecture is majestic and succeeds at complimenting the natural surroundings by creating a serene atmosphere. The rooms are big, the pool is huge and gorgeous and the lobby ceiling is rumored to still be covered in gold leaf. For all the history this place has been home to, its sad to see that it hasn't been maintained better. There seems to be a theme among classic, old hotels of their owners not being able to take care of them."}
{"text":"I have no idea how anyone could rtae this place anything besides a 5-star. It is incredible. From the quality of the upkeep of the grounds to the history of the guests who have stayed there, this place is a gem in the desert!"}
{"text":"Horrible accommodation system. I tried to book massages and spend alot of money there. They wouldn't allow just me by myself to wait at the pool while my wife and sister received massages.....they told me that i could eat at the restaurant or wait in the parking lot for them!.....go to the Phoenician where you can get wristbands and enjoy their pool all day with a massage purchase"}
{"text":"Great Resort!  Friendly and hardworking staff, updated/clean rooms, comfortable bed, and plenty to do.  I was here on business so I did not get to enjoy all the amenities.  The gym was one of the best that I've been to in any hotel.  The grounds are well maintained; every morning I would see the staff hard at work cleaning the pool, walkways, etc... There are tennis courts, basketball courts, pools throughout the property, a water slide at the main pool, activity center, etc...   I was here in the off season and the rates were very reasonable, same rate as an average hotel.  If you are in the area, I strongly suggest trying this resort for a great experience.  I just wish my family could have been with me, they would have really enjoyed it here."}
{"text":"I travel full time in my job and stay in a lot of different hotels every year.  I want to congratulate the Arizona Biltmore for winning the Worst Bed of the Year award for 2013.  This bed is like jelly, and offers no back support.  Clearly this venerable hotel has not upgraded their bedrooms in years, this is pathetic, and awful for the price paid.  Unfortunately, I can't check out, I have a meeting here in the morning."}
{"text":"Had an excellent 2 night stay here this last 4th of July weekend for my boyfriend's birthday. Can't complain about a thing!  We stayed in the new Ocatilla wing, and were totally spoiled for normal hotel rooms from here on out. The new wing offers a sort of VIP lounge for those staying in the wing. Was very helpful when we wanted to relax and read, etc, but had had our fill of blistering sun by the pool. Nice couches, chair area to relax, computers with internet available, a nice patio with firepit (which thank goodness wasn't lit, too hottt!!!) TVs with news or games on, and always cold drinks available. Coffee, tea, iced tea, sodas, water, and snacks. In the morning they offered a great continental breakfast spread, then from 5-9 beers and wine. very lovely. excellent attentive service. Now...there's also appetizers and light fare served from 5-6:30, which is not MEANT FOR DINNER FOR YOUR WHOLE FAMLIY! How trashy people were, lined up like pigs, walking away with BOWLS full of sliders. Hey lady, those aren't meant to feed your kids alone! Sheesh. So we only partook in the drinks, and watched the madness of people flocking to free food like i'm sure they swarm to samples at Costco.  Anyway, the whole hotel was beautiful and well kept, despite the fact that they were probably more busy than usual with the holiday weekend. The pools were all beautiful. Drinks at the pool were steep enough to convince us we didn't need to drink out in the sun, but i suppose we were also spoiled for cocktails since we had free ones available in our lounge in the evening.  Will definitely go back. This is now our go-to place to get out of town for the weekend. Loved it.  OH! almost forgot. in the ocatilla wing you just call them up and someone will come up to your room to draw you a hot bath with sea salts. and a hotel room with a french press?? i'm sold."}
{"text":"In a very upscale hotel like the Arizona Biltmore, I expect high standards.  But when I stepped into the shower on Monday morning, 11/19/12, I was stung by a large scorpion.  My friend was able to kill the scorpion and call the front desk.  They sent security with insect sting wipes and got some basic information but I never heard from anyone in the hotel again, even to see if I was alive.  As a result, I was incapacitated for 2 of the 4 days I stayed at the property and unable to walk.  When I checked out on 11/21/12 I asked the front desk clerk if he was aware of my problem and he was not.  He comped a $29 meal charge and said he would have the manager call me later that day.  I have yet to be contacted by anyone. I understand that \"it's the desert\" and \"you have to watch out for scorpions\" but I have never even seen a scorpion before and certainly did not expect to see one in the 3rd floor shower stall of a pricey resort. (We had even upgraded to the Ocatillo.)  I am appalled at the lack of concern by hotel staff.  It was a completely ruined vacation and I would never stay at this property again.  To make matters worse, you have to walk miles to get anywhere on the grounds and it's like a maze to figure out where things are.  Not sure how they get around ADA requirements."}
{"text":"The quality of service here doesn't match the premium price for this hotel.   Expect to pay: 30 valet 30 resort fee 20 lodging fee  In addition to your room charges.   The service at the pool was horrible. You have to chase down someone to place an order. And they close down the slide early and whenever they feel they need a break.  Also, the bed smelled bad and there were bed bugs. I am sure of it.   On top of all that you have to hike to get to your room. In 100+ degree weather (with a toddler) wasn't ideal.   Some people will love the property but I found it less enjoyable due to the above factors."}
{"text":"My husband and I received a generous gift card from a group at our church and reserved a room at the Biltmore for my birthday. Upon check-out, we were told that our gift card had no value and were accused of having stolen the card! When I asked for an apology and suggested that perhaps there could be another explanation (i.e. YOUR HOTEL STAFF MESSED UP and didn't activate this card when our friend purchased it!!!), I was told that there was no other explanation except that the card must have been stolen. I demanded to speak with a manager who essentially fed me the exact same insults. After 10 minutes of very frustrating conversation with the manager, I was able to get him to admit that it was POSSIBLE that this had been a mistake on the part of hotel staff at the time our gift card was purchased. We left after being asked to pay for our entire bill in full and then the next nightmare began....  The woman from our church who purchased our gift card was appalled that we were treated so horribly and luckily she had her receipt from her online purchase. When she called the hotel, she was assured that everything would be taken care of promptly and that we would be credited back the amount of our gift card immediately. One week passed....no word. I called the Biltmore and was connected to a voice mail box for Sarah, the staff member responsible for gift cards. No return call. I called again two days later and was again connected to the same voice mail. No return call.  I called a third time. No return call. Three weeks had now passed since our stay at the hotel and I called AGAIN. I was about to be connected to the same voice mailbox when I said, \"NO, I do not want Sarah's extension. I want to talk to someone NOW.\" At long last I was connected to Beth, a manager of some kind.  Beth informed me that the finance department had recently approved our refund, and said we would just need to allow some time for it to appear on our credit card statement. When I asked why NO ONE HAD EVER CONTACTED US, she said that Sarah (my friend with FOUR messages from me on her voice mail) had been told numerous times to call me and Beth was surprised to hear that she hadn't done so. When I asked Beth if she knew our entire situation--that we'd been accused of stealing a gift card, she said yes, she'd heard of our experience and was shocked. She apologized and assured me that the staff members we'd dealt with had been \"spoken to\", but I was irritated that I had to bring up our extremely insulting situation and she didn't offer an apology outright. If I hadn't asked her about it, she would not have even mentioned it.   Beth offered us a \"great deal\" if we wanted to return to the hotel. I had to laugh. Was she serious? As if we would ever think of staying at this hotel again!   We did eventually receive our refund, as well as a letter of apology from the hotel. I can't believe that an upscale establishment would treat its clients so poorly. Why in the world would they jump to the conclusion that we were thieves, instead of immediately apologizing for our inconvenience at having received an invalid gift card? Why would they demand payment from us in full, instead of graciously letting us leave and then following up on the purchase history of our gift card? They had our credit card on file and could have billed us later if in fact there was any issue or amount due. Why would they refuse to communicate with us to assure us that our situation was being dealt with?   Customer service is nonexistent at this hotel. The grounds are beautiful, but you can stroll around and have a cup of coffee without staying overnight. Do not give your money to this place."}
{"text":"Absolutely beautiful Frank Lloyd Wright  inspired hotel where every President since Herbert Hoover has stayed (Obama has yet to make an appearance). We chose to stay in the Octavilla building. Yes, it's far from the parking lot (hence the minus one star) but the rooms are new and spacious - accented with the signature Biltmore blocks in the bathroom and in the headboard. Breakfast at Frank & Alberts was delicious with  organic, locally grown ingredients included on the menu.  Definitely take the time to explore the grounds and the buildings and ask the concierge to sign you up for the historical tour where you can learn about all the amazing architecture and well-known guests and traditions at the Biltmore. To think that the piano in the lobby has been played by the likes of Frank Sinatra, Billy Joel, and Bono! Tip: carry a map of the hotel with you - it's very easy to get lost!"}
{"text":"Beautiful place in a very nice area. Nice people. Good place for a secluded room. The maid service was fantastic, very nice people and they did a great job each day. Great A/C with a fan in the room.  Apartment style buildings where it's a 10-15 min outdoor walk to your room if you're on the far end away from the main building and conference center. The water sprinklers will always get you on the sidewalk. The bellhops are nice but they'll drive right by in the golf cart without offering a ride, every time. Never stay here in the 126 degree summers.  Room was fine but not for the price of the room. Good bathroom, good shower/water pressure, great TV. Beds were pretty bad, lumpy, used, very worn. No outlets by the bed to charge your phone and any other electrical outlet around the room is so used that in no way will your plug stay in the wall. Bring electrical tape.   I travel for conferences, with lots of electronics to charge. I prefer the short walk to the elevator down to the conference room and back up and that I can charge my phone by the bed."}
{"text":"I was eager to enjoy the historic Arizona Biiltmore Hotel on my recent stay in Phoenix. I chose the hotel for its reputation and connection to the Frank Lloyd Wright. Unfortunately, I was not impressed at all, other than the opulent lobby, the hotel has seen better days. I was \"upgraded\" to a Villa and did not feel it was an upgrade. The furniture was dirty and threadbare, the appointments were old, even the two TVs were bulbous variety in cabinets. The staff was pleasant enough, but was disappointed with their efforts, the pool staff was non-existent. All in all, I wouldn't select this property again until it is remodeled."}
{"text":"After my brother-in-law wrote to the hotel they promptly responded with an offer to make up for the average meal.  I am now giving them 4 stars for customer service.  Even at my favorite restaurants, I sometimes get a disappointing meal.  I will give these guys another shot and let you know if the other reviewers were right."}
{"text":"Unsure why this resort is rated at 5 stars on Expedia.  Perhaps Expedia is just nostalgic- since the best days of this \"grande dame\" as they refer to themselves - have probably long passed.  First, what's good: the architecture, the layout, the expansive rooms, all amazing.  Really and truly amazing.  Next.. what's not good: the property is run down.  A Waldorf Astoria should be in excellent condition.  The elevator was broken in our 4- story wing on Thursday when we checked in... still broken on Sunday when I checked out.  Holes in the walls and ceilings in the main lobby area and public hallways.  The carpet was stained and was in bad repair (see photos) and the wifi never worked even after several requests to have it checked. The icing on the cake was on the day I checked out.  I had a brunch reservation and asked to check out at 2PM since I would be in THEIR restaurant and wanted a few minutes to collect everything and change clothes before traveling home.  I was told no by the front desk, so I spoke to Jessica the manager and plead my case - explaining that I would be spending $300 or more on brunch so I hoped that she could accommodate this request.  Again, no. But she offered to hold my bags for me... little did I know they would be stacked outside in the 110 degree summer. When I went to check out, I had been charged both self parking and valet parking for each night.  Plus a mini bar charge for bottled water that I never used. As I paid the $360.00 for brunch all I could think of is what a shame.  Skip this frumpy, mean old lady- a gracious grande dame she is not."}
{"text":"We stayed here in June for our 49th anniversary. The room was not a king as we had reserved. The front desk clerk didn't know where the ice machine was and said they would bring us the ice...they didn't bring it, we had to call FOUR times to get ice and the rude person on the phone acted like it was our fault. We tried to make dinner reservations in the restaurant and were transferred several times, finally told to call back after 5:00, we did, again transferred several times, finally got to a real person who told us the restaurant was closed. We went to the coffee shop and nobody waited on us so we took our business away from the property. Breakfast the next day was good but the sever was rude, never once asked us how our meal was, didn't bring our bill, so we went to the hostess and the server got all upset and basically threw the bill at us. We called to check out and the phone rang multiple times, when someone finally answered I told him that and he said \"well, ma'am, I am the only one here\" as if it were my fault.  Letters to management have gone unanswered. Clearly they don't care about service any more than the staff does. A huge disappointment, we had looked forward to a memorable, pleasant experience and have nothing positive to say about the Biltmore and will never go there again."}
{"text":"Gorgeous room, gorgeous property. Front desk was warm & friendly and check in/check out was quick.   Here's why it lost a few stars for me:  -The parking: I called ahead of time and was told self parking was free. Parking was limited and finding a spot was basically like adult musical chairs. And then at check out I'm told parking is NOT free and was charged 12.00.  -The pool experience: It took me 15 minutes to get towels at the main pool. There was a couple ahead of me making arrangements for their cabana. To my surprise, the guy behind the counter was also the person who walked them to their cabana and got them situated. There was NO one else behind the counter on a Saturday afternoon. I watched him walk back with no urgency, which added to my irritation. There were also not enough shaded chairs. My husband and I eventually left to go find a smaller, less crowded pool (try the Ocotilla pool if you're fine getting your own drinks). -The room service: Their in-room menus say they will be happy to accommodate gluten-free meal requests, but when I asked what *WAS* gluten free, the guy I spoke to had no idea. He said, \"I THINK the huevos rancheros, but I'm not really sure.\" When I asked if he could check the ingredient list for the tortillas, he said there was none. We ordered the food anyway, and when the guy showed up with our order, he said he DID check the label that suddenly existed and saw the tortillas did have gluten. I don't understand why he didn't call back to ask us if we wanted something else, because that's what ended up happening anyway, and as a result, I waited about 45 minutes longer than I needed to.   Basically... this is a gorgeous place to stay. If you live in Phoenix, check for staycation deals during the summer. But don't expect all of their services to be attentive and top notch."}
{"text":"This hotel has been going down a long and deep hole during the past few years when management changed.   DO NOT spend your money here.  Management are 25-30 something nothings with no human skills! PLEASE JOIN ME IN BOYCOTTING THIS HOTEL for cancelling long held memberships for no logical reason.  This city has been taken by young power-hungry people without brains in the field of management--whether it be hotels or apartments.  Please be wary. My parents, in their 90's, have been members of the 'spa,' previously called the 'tennis club' for over 60 years.  I had a membership as their daughter. They have cancelled my membership for the following reasons:  speaking out when vilified and cursed at by a woman there for spa treatments who was mad that I placed my hand in a community pretzel jar;  staff COMPLETELY OVERREACTING by calling security--no reason--Staff continued to blame me for days, constantly calling me at home 'to meet with them.'  Enough of this culture of adult children, narcissists, completely paranoid and incapable of problem-solving for decades-long members who pay a huge fee every month."}
{"text":"Erin A's review is hysterical.  This is a first class resort not a swarmy singles hangout where the pool in filled with filthy strippers. Stay classy."}
{"text":"I took five little girls and their mom's to the Arizona Biltmore's High Tea a couple of weeks ago.  We had a fabulous time!  What a way to spend an afternoon!  Great food, great service (kudos to Lindsay and Kevin) and the girls are still talking about all the fun they had. The price is really affordable (little ones five and under eat free) and the seating is comfortable.  We are going back in two weeks. If you want to treat a little girl or a friend to an experience they will always remember, take them to the High Tea at the Biltmore."}
{"text":"Wow! What a beautiful historic hotel in gorgeous surroundings. The grounds are stunning and estates surrounding the property are spectacular. Visited during a famous antique car auction which wS an added surprise. Another Frank Lloyd Wright masterpiece. A must see."}
{"text":"First of all, I'm writing to review the restaurant, Frank & Albert's.  I was in Phoenix this past weekend and was curious to see the hotel because (a) I'm an architecture buff, and (b) the hotel is listed in the Book \"1,000 Things to do Before you Die.\"  So -- check one off for me on that list!  Was it worth it?  YES!  We made a reservation for lunch at noon, but arrived 30 minutes early to walk the grounds.  The hotel and surrounding gardens/pool/etc. are extraordinary.  The architect studied under Frank Lloyd Wright, plus there are stained glass windows and sculptures by the master himself.  The food at Frank & Alberts was delicious.  Their menu highlights local foods and produce - everything was delicious, the service was very helpful and unhurried, and the prices were reasonable.  I highly recommend the pork carnitas.  To top it all off, the valet parking was free.  I had read reviews on Yelp that said you had to pay for parking, but that rule applies to hotel guests (go figure?).    P.S.  We stayed at the Royal Palms Hotel, which was nearby, much smaller and truly one of the great hotels in the world.  It belongs on the list of 1,000 Things to do before you die!"}
{"text":"Read the negative reviews; I wish I would have ahead of time.  They are all true.  Then you'll see a response from Shiela about how sorry they are.  With so many beautiful properties in Scottsdale that have staff trained to run a 4 or 5 star property, there is no need for us to ever come back here.  I have no problem spending a few bucks for a nice resort; I understand the hidden fees, marginal food that's overpriced and a small bottle of sparkling water costing $6.50.  What gets me is when I pay those kinds of prices , the service is bad and the staff isn't trained for this level.  We don't spend money at a property when service is bad and the staff is inconsistent (ie no spa and we go off site for the rest of our meals).  I expected exceptional service,zero disappointments, few frustrations and the ability to relax for a few days with my kids and unfortunately we haven't had that here and we have 2 more days to go! I would love to check out and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"The afternoon tea was FABULOUS!!!  Our servers took great care of us and even made my mom's day when they double-checked with me to ensure that yes, she really is the age I said she was.  We were celebrating my mom's birthday and I treated her to an evening stay at the Biltmore.  I must say that the AZ employee's rate is great and is what prompted us to stay! The staff was incredibly helpful and friendly!  We asked for more towels and ended up with enough for us, the neighbors and maybe the entire hotel!  A couple of downsides however -- 1.  I was expecting more luxury.  The AZ Biltmore is touted around here for being luxurious.  The stay was no more great than a stay at a Hilton (which they are owned by).  The property is old and is in a noticeable state of repair.  It needs work.  The rooms are cold and drafty, the wallpaper is peeling, and there is obvious wear and tear in the lobby.  2.  Frank and Alberts = thumbs down.  The server disappeared for many minutes at a time and only refilled my water when asked.  The food was okay, but not worth the price.  That being said, we had a wonderful stay!  If you have not been, you must go, and take the time to go to the 3rd floor and check out the history room!"}
{"text":"My husband and I stayed here for 4 nights on a work related trip. It was wonderful. The staff was very nice and attentive. The property is just gorgeous. Our room was very comfortable. We hope to come back again someday."}
{"text":"The front desk service was really interesting. On a recent trip there after we checked out my girlfriend discovered she'd left her iPhone in the room.  The front desk refused to allow her to go back to look for it. The desk called up to the room where presumably housekeeping was working.  Nope, nobody had seen it.  Then my girlfriend persisted. Front desk still refused to get more involved and appeared to gather around joking that my girlfriend would make such a request.  Until we asked for the manager.  Then they actually had a bellman go with her up to the room. Long story short the bellman found the maid who had \"cleaned\" the room. While my girlfriend was standing there the maid produced an iPhone from her pocket."}
{"text":"Haven't stayed over-nite - yet. Grounds are gorgeous Drinks at the the bar posh (along with prices obviosuly) spa is very professional, massage was nice convienent area to shops, dinning, everything."}
{"text":"I'm a frequent traveler and stay in Hiltons whenever I can.  I decided to stay at the Biltmore because of the great rates in the summer.  I have stayed at Waldorfs before and have enjoyed the comforts and amnemities they offer.    Walking into the building was unexpected because it was very dark and you had to find your way to the front desk which was not near the front entrance.  Once your eyes adjusted, the architect is wonderful.  I wish that the lighting was brighter to fully enjoy the it.  Wright was a genius in design.  Once at the desk, there was only one person and a long line of people.  I'm a Hilton Diamond member and use to not waiting.  In the other Waldorfs there is a separate area for Hilton Honor members and they have everything ready for your arrival.  So after waiting in line for 30 minutes it was my turn to check in.  The desk attendant was friendly and helpful.  She gave me a map of the property and instructions on where to park my car and how to get to my room.  This is where the hotel gets my 2 star rating.  I like to park in self parking since as I said before I don't like to wait.  Sometimes valet service can be busy.  Well, the self parking lot was a distance from my room.  I had a room in the Terrace building which is in the far back of the hotel.  There is no parking anywhere but in the front of the hotel for valet and the self parking.  Walking from the parking lot to my room in 110 degree weather was not my idea of fun or relaxing.  The map that I was given has all the buildings but it doesn't have the walkways.  The signs on the property are not very helpful.  Walkways split and they don't always have signs where to go.  If you choose the wrong direction you end up at a deadend.  These are not deadends in which you can just walk across the grass to get on another path.  They are deadends that come to a side of a building, fence or ravine.  The whole time I'm walking around, I never see a hotel staff member.  I finally find my building and get on the elevator.  The elevator has no air conditioning and I have just entered an oven.  Now I'm thinking, why didn't I just stay at the Hampton Inn.  The room was ok.  Nothing special, not any different than a Hampton.  The furniture was old but everything was neat and appeared clean.  I go to plug in my Ipad and computer to find that there are very few electrical plugs and many of them don't even work.  Thank goodness I travel with an extension cord (frequent traveler).  The air conditioner control is one of the old kind and I could never get it set so the room was a comfortable temperature.  It was either too cold or too warm.  I was constantly getting up to adjusted it.  The bed was comfortable but when I woke in the morning, the first thing I see is an ant crawling across the sheet.  Ok, its just an ant, it could be worse.  I go into the bathroom to find more ants (call to front desk).  The shower doesn't drain correctly and minor housekeeping issues creep up.    One thing I did like was the food.  It was very good.  I'm not a food person, I eat because I have too so I'm very picky.  But the food was great.  I recommend the Mega Grilled Cheese.  Its a heart attack waiting to happen but it was great.  UPDATE:  I guess it depends on when you order food.  I had the Mega Grilled Cheese for lunch and it was awful.  The bacon wasn't cooked and the cheese wasn't heated enough to even melt.    If I was paying regular winter rates I would of checked out.  The grounds, pool and food are great but the inconveniences, lack of service and bad upkeep of the rooms will keep me from returning."}
{"text":"After a disappointing experience at the Enchantment in Sedona, we reserved a Villa at the Arizona Biltmore and we truly enjoyed our stay there. The Biltmore is old world luxury with modern twists. The front desk staff are friendly and accommodating, the room service staff takes care of all hunger needs, and the hotel and its grounds (and many pools) are all well maintained and impressive. We'll come back here again."}
{"text":"A must see on anyone's tour of Phoenix. The hotel is a gem. If you live in Arizona this is a great place to bring guests. The grounds are stunning with the backdrop of the mountains highlighting the lush landscaping, sculpture and fountains. The structure itself is truly one of a kind. The interior boast beautiful fixtures and some amazing murals and architechural treatments. Snoop around a little to see all the hidden treasures! The hotel facade and grill are currently undergoing construction so you might want to call ahead - even with the work going on it is still beautiful."}
{"text":"I stayed here for the past couple nights and thoroughly enjoyed myself. Initially, I found the entrance to be a little hard to find but once you step into the property, it's as if you have come out of the city and gone into an oasis. The property is absolutely gorgeous, very unique architecture and just beautiful all around. I used valet and since it's such a large property I would never self park because it would probably take a while to lug around bags and get to the room.   All of the staff that we encountered were great, very pleasant and helpful. We especially loved Priscilla, a cocktail server at one of the bars. She recommended several different fun things for us to do, what a great employee you have there. The pool was amazing as were the bartenders, bellmen, and room service. Guy was our server at Frank and Alberts for dinner one night and he is fantastic server as well. Overall a wonderful stay and I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Old school fist class. Stayed in the Ocatilla building. Happy hour drinks and snacks were excellent. Our kids are a bit older and loved all of the pools and activities. Mini golf, croquet, hiking, shopping- almost anything you could want.   Service and relaxation!"}
{"text":"I love the Biltmore. Even getting into the fundraiser/gala season when every single non-profit and corporate America company hosts every function imaginable here, I never get sick of this place.   Do yourself a favor and talk with a willing staffer about the history of this place, I think they may do tours but I'm not sure.  I worked here for about 3 minutes in early college years and the best part of that experience was the history lesson.  They had a speakeasy!   What I love most is going to the lobby bar and ordering something special depending on time of day and company; on a recent Saturday afternoon with a girlfriend we shared a bottle of wine (from the cafe) and last winter it ranged from a Manhattan to a decadent dessert and cup of coffee or glass of Port.  Then, I go out back to the courtyard.  (This is best on a chilly evening when the fires are all lit.)  And I just sit, relax, watch all the pretty people and pretend like I'm on vacation."}
{"text":"I have to say 4 stars for the massage  3 stars for the amenities. Could be stunning with a remodel, also there was only cold H20 in the lounge not near the lockers. The massage was great, especially with the heated pillow, heated eye mask and warm oil! Total relaxation. Great way to unwind from a flight! Not to mention the robes felt incredible!"}
{"text":"The night we got here the service was on the bad side and our room smelled like vomit (No joke). However after we got our new room everything was good from then on. The service got a little better and there was so much to do. 6 pools! 6! Real life-sized chess board, restaurants, and shops are just some of the amazing things. But the sports court is pretty underwhelming just saying. But the reason I gave this place 3 stars instead of 4 was because of just how bad the first night was."}
{"text":"We have stayed here many times, but this Easter weekend was troubling. Thursday night at around 8pm, my party and I were hungry and went into Frank and Alberts to be told the kitchen could not take anymore food orders for 35 minutes. The hotel was booked at 50% capacity, not many folks in the restaurant.  Last meal there last night, most Easter visitors had checked out. My brother went to make reservations for 8 people for 7:30. He was told they couldn't do a party of 8 at one table. My brother asked for two tables of four and they said sure...what???? It doesn't make any sense. They messed up my order and the server was very defensive. Had to go find her twice. This is not five star service. The bathrooms in the main lobby has gone from using folded towels to dry your hands to paper c-fold towels, again not five star. Glasses and plates left for extended periods of time on the tables in the hallways in common areas.  I could go on. This has changed just recently. Maybe it's the new ownership We were disappointed. Next year, our party of 18 will go to Coronado CA instead."}
{"text":"My husband and I were in Phoenix attending our granddaughters graduation and decided to bring our dogs with us. Like most pet lovers, we were concerned about finding a hotel that would accommodate our dogs and be a great experience for us too. The Arizona Biltmore far exceeded our expectations. The grounds were beautiful and our room in one of the cottages was wonderful. We even had a fenced yard where the dogs could enjoy being off leash!  I look forward to going back and thank the management for accommodating dogs in such a beautiful setting."}
{"text":"I stay at Hilton Brand hotels 60+ nights a year and this has become my favorite.  Rooms are well appointed and very clean, the grounds are like walking through a museum, and the landscaping is very refreshing.  Staff was courteous and professional. This is a premier hotel and so far my favorite Waldorf as I have also stayed in Chicago and NYC.  A great resort and a must visit!"}
{"text":"All Waldorf Astoria......My wife and I stay here 4-5 times a year and have never had a problem. Everyone is so nice. Frank and Alberts is excellent, We have a great time on the putting green.......great times!!!!!"}
{"text":"Currently under construction and sadly not very organized. The internet wasn't great in the location we were at. The building we were in had a very musty Oder and a broken elevator. The room was nice still had a past smoked in Oder or musty mold cover smell. The pool slide and accompanying pool wasn't available because of renovations. Lots of items in the gym were out of order. The males sauna was also out of order. The reason I'm giving the hotel two stars is for the architecture (gorgeous), valets (very friendly and apologetic) and last but not least the Sprites (Supposedly six of them on property; I only found 5). Great spot for history, I would love to come back and see it organized fixed up and not under construction."}
{"text":"So I was traveling on biz and decided to stay here and use my points for 2 days.  What a disappointment. Grounds are gorgeous - don't get me wrong- but considering you are at a resort- they need to work on the food, service and amenities.  I look at the little things. Like they give you a Keurig and coffee but no little creamers? Powder creamer? Really?  I'm a Diamond member- didn't even give me a bottle of water when I checked in.  Went to the pool today and had to flag down a waiter. Food was mediocre. Had what was called a chopped wedge. It was nothing more than lettuce with croutons and egg. Didn't see an ounce of blue cheese. Then, I had to go find the guy to get my check.  The most annoying thing was a worker outside at 6:15 am hammering away at something. Are you kidding me?  At least I was up The only good part was the facial at the spa. She did a good job. Not worth 155 bucks but at least my skin looks good   Ladies locker smelled awful, too Room is nice. Air conditioning is good.  They need to step up their game. I wouldn't return.  I've stayed at Hilton Garden Inn's with better food and service"}
{"text":"Stayed here over the Memorial Day weekend to celebrate our anniversary. We had booked one of the cottages, but were told that there was a flood, so they put us in what they call a \"villa\", a very long walk from the main building. We were disappointed, as we were interested in the more historical aspects of the cottages. The villas are like staying in any run of the mill condominium. I believe that they seriously impair the historical charm of the place. Furthermore the wife was disappointed in that the bathtub in the villa was broken. The food at Wrights was just OK. Frank and Alberts was like eating at Denny's. Unless you're an avid golfer, I wouldn't recommend staying here. It no longer lives up to the classic Biltmore/Waldorf standards. For the high prices, there are much nicer places to stay with better service."}
{"text":"Great hotel with a lot of character and attentive staff.  But, AVOID if the hotel is hosting a major conference.  We were there last weekend while there was a medical device sales conference happening.   Hundreds of attendees that literally took over the hotel.  This is the only hotel I've seen that holds conference events in the main part of the hotel.  In this case, massive dinners in the main quad that overflowed into the main lobby bar and lobby area both Friday and Saturday night.   Hundreds of conference attendees getting heavily boozed up smoking cigars ... there was literally no place to sit either night.  Clearly the medical co is paying for this access, but the fact that the hotel does not provide a better alternative location in the hotel to host these massive events is also a dis to the leisure guests who unfortunately booked the same weekend.  Bottom line: if you are going to this hotel and are not with a conference, call ahead to see what he hotel is hosting.  My guess is there is likely a major conference event every weekend during peak season."}
{"text":"I booked 3 rooms for 3 nights each and was sorely disappointed. They have me $100 vouchers that was told to use upon check out. Wrong. So I'm out $300 worth of stuff I bought assuming the vouchers would cover it. My room was in the Golf Villas which means a nice 15 minute walk to the room from the lobby and even farther to the convention center. They have golf carts that can pick you up / drop you off, but that's assuming they're charged (50/50) on my experience. And of course you are expected to tip. Called for more toiletries on the third day, never received them. Never received their towel cards on check-in so I had to fight as to why I wasn't going to pay for not returning them on check out. Place was beautiful. Just a pain in the *** to stay here. I won't be back. Not for this price at this service level."}
{"text":"Really liked this resort.  The front desk associates are so friendly and helpful it makes coming to this place like heading to friends house.    The rooms are fantastic, the typical long walk at a resort but that's okay.    The only part of the stay that could have been better was the coffee shop.  Those people were not friendly or particularly helpful.  Almost seemed as though I was putting them out to have them give me a cup for coffee...  There were several people working so no one was overly busy, but they were not friendly.  They could use some customer service training...  Mainly learning how to smile, how to be friendly, how to be attentive..."}
{"text":"Come here on vacation to what is supposed to be a longstanding high end hotel - Waldorf Astoria even, and was woken up at 8 am by a drilling/sanding noise coming from right under my room. I call down to the front desk and spoke to what is supposedly a manager and get nowhere.  She tells me that maintenance had scheduled a \"restoration\" and it was on the schedule. At 8 am?? At a hotel that is a resort? I thought resorts were somewhere you relax and to relax and sleep in?? I guess not at the Arizona Biltmore.... Anything goes."}
{"text":"i went to phoenix for a quick vacation and stayed at the biltmore.  front desk staff was quite gracious at check in. room and grounds were beautiful.  heres why 2 stars.  it was 120 degrees i was walking from my room to the pool on the grass as i was barefoot and the sidewalk was scorching. imbedded in the grass was a green painted metal thing about the 5 inches across and 3 inches tall. i didnt see it as it was painted the same color as the grass and it just blended in. i stubbed and broke my toe on it.   i asked the bartender by the pool for some bandaids as i was bleeding. she obliged but that was it.   i went to tell the front desk about it cause its dangerous. they gave me $75 credit. i didnt ask for a credit but thought to myself broken toe is worth way more than $75 dollars. i also didnt express my displeasure cause i was on vacation and didnt want to deal with it. unfortunately my vacation was ruined cause i wasnt able to walk around or do anything i wanted to do."}
{"text":"After staying here three times I feel I can sufficiently review this hotel. Let's go from best to worst in remarks- best: rooms especially the villas are great if you have your kids with you and even if you don't, these are spacious and beautiful. Best: room service- the food is always delicious and the service has been too notch with the delivery person going above and beyond. Best- pool options- u have options. The main pool with the slide is great and the service also, but there are two other pools you can hang out at if you prefer something more low key, and at. It's these other options you can get food and beverage service also. The only \"worst\" comments in Involve check in and in person check out- this process is the most time consuming and I'm not sure what the hold up is? Even when not under renovation they were very slow:/ hopefully after renovation they will keep more on staff to keep this process running more smoothly and quickly. We tried to get a digital key to avoid the check in wait but it would not work :/ otherwise a great place to stay."}
{"text":"I have never stayed at the hotel but the property is amazing. What I want to highly recommend is the \"high tea\" that is served. It is a bit pricey but very much worth it for a special occasion. Delicious teas, finger foods and wonderful and decedent deserts."}
{"text":"A lot of history has taken place here. Even if you don't stay here touring the property is a must!"}
{"text":"I recently stayed a week for business event going on there and was impressed with the size of the grounds and the beauty of the lobby. The hotel has a rather long history, i think and they've done a great job restoring the architectural details. The staff is friendly and the outside lounge/firepit area was my favorite spot to sit and read or have a drink. I stayed in a room located in one of the cottages and that is where I think the hotel lost some points from me. I thought it was a nice feature to have rooms available in smaller cottages like they do, but the room I happen to get was located in the back corner of one of the cottages so it felt very dark. The one window I had in the room opened to a the view of a cement wall so I had practically no natural light at all. The placement of the TV was located strangely...it was facing a direction that was not facing the bed at all, so everyday I constantly had to turn the TV so I could see it. The TV was not a HUGE deal but just something I found annoying. Overall, the room was tidy and clean...but just really dark. The event staff was very friendly and always ready to help. The food served at the event I attended was decent, but what can you really expect from food that is cooked in very large quantities. I didn't play any golf but the views of the course are very picturesque and I thought it was really nice that they had walking/running trails for people to exercise on. Overall, I had a nice stay at the hotel...personally I like to stay in places a little more modern but I can see it being a nice place to hold weddings or events. If you do stay there and choose to stay in a cottage, make sure it's a room with a window not facing a cement wall."}
{"text":"Grounds and main buiding are 5-star; beautiful building and grounds that hearken back to a byegone era: the late 1920s and early 1930s.  Some of the rooms hearken back to an era that occasions less nostalgia: the late 80s/early 90s, which is when i think my room was last renovated.  But the thing that causes me to post this is that THE INTERNET ACCESS IN THE ROOMS IS INCREDIBLY UNRELIABLE.  I haven't had such a bad connection since the early days of dial-up.  I've been at this hotel for three days for business and my internet access has crashed on me at least three times every day, twice nearly blowing a deadline as I've been unable to send a document to my home office.  The front desk was no help at all: first they dropped me while supposedly transfering me to tech support, and then simply didn't answer the phone (it rang over 50 times, which simply shouldn't happen at a front desk).    On my last night here, I gave up and walked from my \"cottage\" to the lobby. Internet access is working passably so far here -- at least for now."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this 5 star resort (came for an onsite conference), but it was quite the cluster from the moment I arrived. GPS takes you to the back entrance, but there are no signs there saying it's an entrance. You wind your way around to the front and all the signs say \"Do Not Enter\", there's no where to go. I finally figured out that one lane was two way (no lane divider) and parked and dragged my luggage in to check in almost walking into the glass door as it did not slide open and no one opened it for me (the \"lobby\" is in another building due to construction, but it's very make-shift from what I could tell). I then was given a very nice room way in the back in the Ocatilla building, but had to drag my luggage back to the car and follow someone in a golf cart about a half mile away. The room was nice, quiet, clean. The bed was a nightmare. Like sleeping on a marshmallow and not in a good way. (I later found out another building had the same beds). Signage is lacking walking around the huge grounds. You'll see a sign to your building, but then 5 feet later there is a fork in the path and you have no idea which way to go. Frustrating. They have golf carts that take you all over, but a lot of it is walkable once you figure out the layout and shortcuts. I think they had one or two restaurants on premises open, but nothing else is walkable from there. Thankfully I had a car and ate every meal out. Even the room numbers make no sense. My room was on the ground floor, but started with a 6 and a friend's was on the 4th floor of another building, but started with a 3. The pools were fine (I think I only found two, but maybe the Paradise pool counts as more than one?). The staff were nice (although when checking in, the concierge could sense my frustration and said she would have something sweet sent to my room, I never got anything. The attempt at \"service recovery\" fails miserably if you don't deliver... Would I recommend? Possibly, depends what you're looking for, but mostly no. Would I ever stay here again? NO. Never."}
{"text":"Just returned from vacation with my wife and son. Loved this hotel. Food was terrific.  Beautiful spot. Great service."}
{"text":"Beautiful property and friendly staff! What more could you ask for? Ok, maybe more dining options.."}
{"text":"If I could give them no stars, I would. I attended a BBB awards ceremony on Wednesday, April 6, 2016 at the conference Center. The valet service was not in front of the conference center but rather in front of the hotel. After the event ended, I started to walk to the area where the parking valets were located. IT WAS PITCH BLACK WITH NO LIGHTS MARKING THE WALKWAY. Due to the lack of light, I was totally unable to see the curb and fell soundly onto the concrete walkway. I fell onto my left hip and left hand. I also struck the left side of my head on the concrete and the inside part of my left ankle. After I got up WITHOUT ASSISTANCE FROM ANY STAFF WHO WERE OBLIVIOUS TO MY FALL, I went to the valet desk and reported the incident. There were random comments made about the lights and that they should have been on...that did not alter the fact that there were not! I had given them my card to retrieve my car which was brought up to the front...on the far side of the driveway. After about 5 minutes, it was brought to the curb where I was standing and I painfully got into my car. At this point a person who identified himself as head of security came to my car door and asked me what happened. I explained the foregoing to him and now noted that lights had been turned on lighting the walkway; THIS WAS MORE THAN TEN MINUTES LATER. He kept asking me exactly where I fell and I explained this to him several times. I was in severe pain with my head pounding and my ears ringing. After about 5-10 minutes of his asking how the accident occurred, he gave me a form to fill out detailing the incident with my personal information, including my phone number. He offered a \"hand-size\", small ice pack, which I placed on my ankle as it was throbbing. It is now Friday afternoon and I HAVE NOT BEEN CONTACTED BY ANYONE FROM THE ARIZONA BILTMORE. The pain persists in the injured areas! I am appalled at the lack of concern from this facility!"}

{"text":"Gotta' love Frank Lloyd Wright's architecture, but the knock-off guest rooms don't do the trick.    I stayed here while on a business trip and was pleasantly surprised by the speed of the Internet access.  On the other hand, I suspect I was one of 10 people in the place that may have been concerned about high-speed Internet.  Everyone else was retired.  Not that there is anything wrong with retirees, but they aren't exactly a 20-something's preferred crowd.    The service was not too hot, either.  The front desk messed up my reservation twice and was extremely slow at checking guests into their rooms.    The beauty of Frank Lloyd Wright's prowess is the only thing that distinguishes the joint."}
{"text":"This is a review of the pool only. Went to the pool over Memorial Day holiday and it was awful. I arrived at 9:00 am Sunday morning, and it was already packed. Thankfully, my friend who was staying there arrived at 7:30 am to get the last 2 open lounge chairs. The pool is very small in relation to some of the other newer resorts in the area. Normally, I like a crowded and bustling pool scene, but when the crowd consists of 75% children squirting their water guns my direction, I'll pass. The bar didn't open until 11am, which doesn't score them any points, either, especially considering that I had to put up with 100+ screaming 8 year olds ruining my tan. As the day progressed and the sun intensified, my friend asked for an umbrella no fewer than 3 times before getting someone to move one her direction. This would have been expected, except that there was a closed umbrella about 15 feet away from her that simply needed to be transplanted into the stand nearby. The food wasn't bad at all, and the drinks were tolerable...when we were finally able to flag down a waitress sometime around noon. A little music might have helped, too. Sadly, the Biltmore seems long overdue for an update."}
{"text":"Amazing hotel filled with history and amazing architecture. Desk and bell staff were helpful. The food was great at Frank & Albert's, and the service was great too there! Amazing patio! If you're holding an event here, double check the catering food however, not so hot. :("}
{"text":"The Biltmore is beautiful and exudes wealth and glamor. The grounds are expansive and impeccably maintained and the lobby is truly grand. The swimming pools are spectacular and the gym is wonderful (be sure to arrive early for fresh squeezed complimentary orange juice, coffee, tea, and apples). I didn't find the spa's amenities until the last day--be sure to take advantage of them starting upon arrival.   Despite what much of the literature suggests, this is not a Frank Lloyd Wright building... its design is based on his ideas with some input from him, but most of his recommendations went unused. Be sure to take one of the free bi-weekly history tours to learn more about this historical gem.  The employees were incredibly kind and helpful. If you asked where to find a room or pool, they would always walk with you until you found it. In the bars, the wait staff was very friendly and eager to make your experience perfect.  For athletes, the Biltmore is a godsend! They have granny bikes for check-out, tennis and basketball courts on-site, and they lead local hikes. Triathletes will be in their element with a richly-appointed weights and cardio area in the gym. They will also love:  Swimming: The 20-meter Ocatilla pool is good for lap swimming and usually empty during typical lap swim hours. The other pools are either busy, awkwardly-shaped or awkwardly-distanced, or there is no room for flip turns.  Running: Just outside the front doors is the nearly 70-mile long Arizona Canal Path. I ran 16 miles (8 out and 8 back) on this perfectly maintained canal-hugging dirt path. There is no water until the five mile mark so be sure to fill your bottles on your way back--it will be hot and the bellmen won't have water.  Cycling: While cycling is allowed on the Arizona Canal Path, it is dirt so limited to use by mountain bikes and hybrids. For cycling, the path is more suited for transportation. Instead, pull out that road or tri bike and head out to Carefree (yes, that's really the name of the town) and Bartlett Lake. From the Biltmore, it's 100 miles roundtrip with a generous 5,550' of climbing. If you have time, kick off your cycling shoes and enjoy a quick swim in the lake before your return.  There are vast options on-site for hanging out and talking with friends, laying around while relaxing in the sun, or putting on a wedding or conference event. We were there for a conference and it ran exceedingly well. The catered food was delicious (just say \"Yes!\" to gelato) and the rooms and tables were well-adorned. I especially liked the tables that had fire pits in the middle (it was cold outside and I could warm my hands). The area surrounding the resort is also nice. It's a hotspot for foodies and a great place to shop and saunter along as the sun sets.    I give the Biltmore four stars instead of five for several reasons.   1.) I liked our room a lot, but our view was terrible... we overlooked a rooftop.  2.) My husband (who tends to always be hot) and his colleagues were freezing during conference meetings. He had to wear a coat to all lectures.  3.) I've stayed in many five star hotels out of the country and find them to have a panache uncommon in US hotels. At five-star hotels, I've come to expect bellhops to greet me with a cool, lavender hand towel, cold drink, and a simple process of checking in (e.g., seamlessly moving me from the car to the registration desk and my luggage from the car to my room).  4.) Like what I found in the gym in the mornings, I've come to expect fruit-infused water, tea, and coffee in the lobby and snacks or fruit sitting around for guests. I'm used to these being ubiquitous (they were only in the gym at the Biltmore and only available in the mornings). 4.) I hated having to carry my key everywhere. They had a new key system allowing guests to unlock doors with their phones, but none of the staff were able to make it work with our phones."}
{"text":"My goodness this place has gone downhill. Yeesh."}
{"text":"a grand old oasis in the middle of the desert that is phoenix. the rooms won't wow you-- they are reminiscent of a 1980s las vegas hotel-- but the property itself sprawls with amenities. from the grand pool to the championship 18-hole putting green to impeccably manicured gardens, this place is truly a resort. franklin lloyd wright-inspired architecture is noteworthy.  lots of great restaurants too. we got a great deal on our room-- $150, and that's a grand bargain for a grand hotel."}
{"text":"I had the privilege of staying at the Biltmore last week while a Phi Kappa Psi national meeting was taking place. I was the Granny Nanny for my 6 month old grandson while my son in law and daughter attended several meetings and banquets. I completely enjoyed my stay! I had a wonderful room in the Ocatilla building. I had a number of excellent dining experiences,in the restaraunt, poolside and room service! While it was ridiculously HOT my room was always comfortable especially during my grandson's nap time. I learned to appreciate the amazing designs of Frank Lloyd Wright and loved the architect and designer's ability to weave his distinct style into the entire facility. I will happily recommends this facility to anyone heading to the Phoenix area in the future! My visit was a pleasure from start to finish!"}
{"text":"Retro is the word.  Looks like it got a great face lift about 1971 but hasn't changed much since.  Fantastic spot for a conference, but for a destination resort probably not your best bet.  Service definitely did not follow the \"customer is king\" philosophy.  Great omeltte though."}
{"text":"I was here with my family on a corporate conference and we were impressed. The grounds  are gorgeous and we'll kept. There are beautiful flowers, fruit trees, hummingbirds and rabbits running around the grounds. The staff is friendly and everything was clean and comfortable. The food given for our events which lasted over 3 days was better than average bit they had a tough time keeping things warm when we had an outdoor receptions.  The pool was big and nice with the temperature just right (could be that the weather was perfect to begin with) overall the most beautiful thing about this hotel were the grounds and architecture..the overall ambience day or night was first class."}
{"text":"I stayed at the Arizona Biltmore on business and had a top-of-the-line experience. The property's history is fascinating: The architecture was inspired by Frank Lloyd Wright and Marilyn Monroe frequented the Catalina Pool. Also, the Tequila Sunrise cocktail was supposedly invented here. I really enjoyed the resort grounds and mountain views - highly recommend!"}
{"text":"My husband hosted a mid-week corporate event for 100 in May 2016.  I was delighted to be able to join him for 2 nights, having stayed at the Biltmore several times but not in the last 8 years.   OF NOTE: -The public areas of the hotel and the grounds are spectacular and are being properly maintained.  Everywhere you look, the eye peacefully rests on something beautiful of organic form or origin (with the possible exception of the main pool, see below). -Multiple low-key areas for lounging inside and out (with shade) -Tastefully appointed, updated room, not trendy or overdone -Restful, historic Catalina pool with walled-off shallow section for little ones -The 18 hole putting course is a blast!  Sadly we did not have time for a round of golf so I can't comment on the course.   - The onsite retail shops have a wide selection of fashionable and useful items for both men and women.   - Location is convenient to the airport, nearby shopping and all Scottsdale has to offer.  NEEDS IMPROVEMENT: - The main pool has an awkward layout and the afternoon social scene (during a concomitant CPA convention!) reminded me of a Vegas party pool.  We actually had to walk through the gated pool area behind a tarped-off ice machine and service area to reach the front door of our villa.  From the historic photos of the property, you can see that the perimeters of this pool area have been maxed out to accommodate the private cabanas - are those really such a big thing? - bar and dining area.  One morning there was a huge pile of ice melting on the walkway we had to pass through.   - Food inconsistencies: The roasted vegetables served at the event banquet I attended on the lawn were fabulous.  The lunch food at Frank and Albert's was just so-so.  We did not have an opportunity to dine in the main restaurant. - Service inconsistencies - Banquet and bell service excellent.  Exceptional yoga instructor on the morning I attended.  However....pool towels seem to only be available at the main pool - you have to pick them up there and schlep to the Catalina pool.  Table service in the restaurant lagging during a slow lunch hour.  Housekeeping staff failed to re-stock coffee bar. Cocktail waitress promised several times to light our table firebowl but kept \"forgetting\".  When queried, recreation staff failed to inform me that nature walk had to be \"pre-booked\" - and walk had already departed when I showed up 10 min early.   - Spa overpriced.  My 90 min facial came to over $450 with \"automatic\" gratuity but the value was not there.   - Water pressure in our room was anemic.   This resort deserves 6 stars for the stunning architecture and grounds.  If they can address some of the areas noted, it could easily garner a 5-star rating."}
{"text":"My father was an architect.  I grew up being aware of design, both interior and exterior, and of famous architects and architecture.  Even lived in a Mies Van Der Rohe designed community in Detroit... So, it had ALWAYS been on my list of places to stay if I travelled to Phoenix...  I absolutely loved staying here.  My room was huge.  mid-century... great design... great textures and fabrics and bathroom big enough to hold a yoga class in...  However if I was to stay again I would definitely spring for one of the cottages.  What they have done with sculptured concrete block and geometric stained glass resonated with me on a deep level.  Tip of the hat to you, Dad, for giving me love and appreciation of the finer things."}
{"text":"For several years, I've gone to high tea at the Biltmore Hotel in Phoenix. It was always amazing...Villeroy and Bach china, Tea Forte teas, fabulous tea sandwiches - some with caviar - very fresh bread and the desserts were fabulous. Let me tell you...things have gone downhill. I took my husband and son today because they had never been and my son's girlfriend to celebrate her birthday. The tea service was abysmal. Kevin Doyle, the tea sommelier was still there and entertaining as always, and we tried several types of Tea Forte but the food offerings were, for the most part, bite-sized at best. What used to be larger than small, tea sandwiches were less than an inch in size. The bread was hard and dry. No salmon mouse, no caviar. The scone and pound cake were good served with preserves and there was also a bite-sized cinnamon roll which was divine. The  Devonshire Cream and Lemon curd were good but rather thick and dry and the desserts were awful (mostly cookie types). Everything was about sugar and flour. The desserts we used to get were very large and varied...mousse, chocolates, cakes, etc. These desserts weren't any better than you could find in a grocery store and some not even as good as that. And this place is NOT cheap. It's $42 a person plus an 18% gratuity on the whole bill.  In the past when my ladies used to go, if you left hungry it was your own fault. We were constantly asked, \"Would you like more,\" and everything was so good, we said \"yes\" always. They would even send us home with more of their incredible foods.   Today, we got one of everything and that was it. No asking us if we wanted more. Granted we got all the tea we could drink and it was excellent...my favorite was the Swiss Apple and I came home and promptly ordered a canister for myself and one for my son and his girlfriend. The kids had a good time, but next time I will either go back to the Ritz Carlton or try the Phoenician. I will not return to the Biltmore...it was not an enriching experience.  View this video here...it shows the size things used to be...not what they were today:  http://www.arizonabiltmore.com/restaurants-and-dining/high-tea/  In years past, I've written amazing reviews of the high tea but I won't be doing that again unless things go back to the way they used to be."}
{"text":"My husband and I had afternoon tea and loved the experience. Kevin is so knowledgable, warm, friendly, and accommodating. I highly recommend having tea at the Arizona Biltmore. It was a memorable experience that we will continue to enjoy again and again. Many more teas to try. Thank you Kevin!"}
{"text":"I am a Trip Advisor top contributor and have the 5th most likes to my reviews in NYC. The reason why I want to highlight this is because i want to emphasize that I visit a lot of hotels every year especially hiltons because I have a card with them.  In my 20 odd years of travelling, this is by far the worst hotel I have ever come across.  We booked an Ocatilla room through Southwest Airlines. When we arrived Carlton Stokes (who is apparently the manager there) gave us a regular room. When I inquired why I did not get an Ocatilla lounge, (superior room) I was then told that they never got info from the airlines that I have a superior room. Now thats a lie. I showed him my confirmation email and then he said all he has is a superior 'accessible' room and he gave me that. That room had torn furniture, no tub and was completely out of order. I asked if I could be changed to a superior room, and was told that there are no rooms available. BIG LIE!   I was travelling with toddlers and specifically took the superior rooms for their comfort. Next morning I spoke to the manager (Nick) and he changed us to a superior room. Was not sure how suddenly they got a room available for the length of my stay. Nick was acting as if he was doing me a favor while doing the swap. I paid for the superior room and its not my problem if their system is wrong. I showed them the proof and emailed it to them too.  Now the super pricey room (Ocatilla) comes with the following add ons as per their website and the piece of paper they give you...  1. Complimentary beer, wine & refreshments: This was the only saving grace along with the old white guy and the lady in the Ocatilla lobby who were very helpful.  2. Complimentary continental breakfast - This is just a few sweet puffs, fruits and yogurt. This is no breakfast. And they dont ensure its available all the times during breakfast. They say that this is available from 6:30AM but it aint available by around 7:15 AM.  3. Personal Ocatilla Concierge - to arrange your visit and tend to your needs - This is a joke. Never seen my personal concierge. I asked for the concierge and nobody knew of anything like that  4. Personalized \"morning start\" - coffee, tea or orange juice to your room upon request - Big Lie. Nobody gets them to your room. They did on day 1 and told us that they are not obligated to do so.  5. Therapeutic turndown bath - a hot bath drawn with soothing sea salts - Bigger lie. I asked them some 4-5 times and nobody knew what I was talking about. When I showed them the piece of paper on which it said about it, they said its not available anymore.  6. Pre-departure services arranged by your Ocatilla Concierge - airport transportation, printing airline boarding passes, shipping needs and rental car returns - OMG...an even bigger joke. There are a couple of computers there and you need to take care of yourself. Nobody knows nothing around there  7. Two-hour pressing service - guaranteed to keep your clothing fresh and crisp daily - Another joke. The staff of this hotel did not clean the dishes we left by the room entrance for two days. And they are promising on their website that they have a 2 hour service.  Added to the lies above, what makes this an even terrible hotel is the following...  - We head out one of the days and on our way out at around 9 AM, we specifically informed 3 staff personnel to clean our room by around 2PM. When we arrived to our surprise, nobody did nothing. I called up the manager and he said that they will clean by 430PM as per their contract with the service company. I have never heard an answer like that. After calling them again and again, they finally cleaned the room at 3:30PM.  - We asked the house keeping to send us some plates and they said they wont send them. We asked the guy at the Ocatilla lobby and this chap was the rudest ever saying that they dont give plates.  - I called the manager (Nick) asking him for the timings of the pool. His answer was 'we have 8 pools on property and everyone is open 24x7'. I go to the main pool and the slides are closed. The staff there told me that they open at 9AM. Thats how well he knows his hotel.  The Ocatilla wing is farthest from the parking lot and it takes a good 10 mins to walk and they do offer a ride on the goft carts but you have to call them and wait.  All in all I do not recommend this hotel to anyone.   The staff at this hotel do not do their job properly. They are more interested in pushing the work to someone else or giving you some random answer than helping you out.   You will basically ruin your vacation if you end up choosing this hotel.  I would rather stay in a motel on the street than come back or recommend this hotel. I wish Hilton hotels look into this nonsense and strip them off the Waldorf brand...  I should never have a reason to call the manager in a luxury brand hotel. unfortunately in this nonsense hotel, I had to speak to the manager every day"}
{"text":"i loved everything about my experience here! the staff is so welcoming and accommodating, it's in a great location so you don't have to travel too far to get where you need to be, the room was gorgeous and i love love LOVE that the pools are open 24/7. there is a little something there for"}
{"text":"I really love this hotel and the grounds. The rooms are so quiet and the beds really comfortable. Really unique architecture. I stay here when I can in the off season when prices are lower."}
{"text":"*In all my years of travel, never have I dealt with such a lack of caring or service *I was stung twice by a scorpion in bed at 4:30am, I trapped it on a glass, called the front desk, they sent up security and he was non chalant about it and handed me some anti itch cream *I proceeded to inform the front desk, concierge and the front desk at check out only to receive no real response or caring about the situation.  I almost feel like this is a common occurrence and they didnt want to admit to it, no offer for a comp room, no letter from the GM all the while my shoulder and arm were ON FIRE and I was in Pain for an entire day with horrible swelling.  Unbelievable. *Lastly, I had PTSD the second night and barely slept a wink.  All I wanted to do was leave this property.  I worked in the hotel business for many years, matter of fact I rain front desks and have a degree from one of the best Hotel Schools in the world, its not that this type of thing happens, IT IS HOW YOU DEAL with it and I give this staff a resounding F grade."}
{"text":"While visiting a relative staying at the biltmore I made an appointment to get my eyebrows waxed.  I paid $40 for something I could of done with tweezers and my right hand.  And Im a lefty.  Better off with the $7 nail salon special, trust me.    I would have only given 1 star, but I really liked the wax they use.  No soreness or messy red bumps after.  Earned them an extra star.  Maybe they can just tell me where to get the wax from?"}
{"text":"Four and half stars. Very beautiful older property built in the twenties and thirties. I stayed in one of the one bedroom cottages well-appointed spacious equipped with its own patio. Lunch at Frank and Alberts was good and reasonably priced for a 4 star establishment. Dinner menu was on the high side as far as pricing since there are so many wonderful restaurants in the area to choose from. Note: this is a dog friendly hotel."}
{"text":"I'd go back to this Hotel, guaranteed. Excellent service. Everyone was very helpful. If you asked anyone with a Biltmore name tag for directions, they'll walk you through until you get there. That's an extra step that makes a big difference.   My room was ultra clean. Housekeepers were very nice. Front desk very helpful.   One of the most comfortable lobbies I've been to. You'd actually enjoy sitting there and working on your laptop. Just the right noise level, lighting and temp was pretty comfy."}
{"text":"When my AC busted a few weeks ago I found myself staying in a suite here for the weekend.  Ok, so it's not how I usually roll, but luckily some out-of-town friends scored a suite here and my bad luck met with perfect timing to equal an over-the-top silver lining for the weekend.  The Arizona Biltmore pools alone warrant five stars, but the service and suite were nothing to look past either. The two room suite was comfortable, spacious and tastefully decorated. The living room and bedrooms had a subtle Southwestern decor that I surprisingly didn't hate.    The architecture and landscaping of the grounds was just as legendary as you would expect. Calling for extra towels was a cinch and took only a few minutes for them to arrive. The housekeeper we flagged down in the hallway gladly took photos of us on the balcony and repeatedly tried to refuse our $5 tip for his trouble. We weren't having it.  Finally, the pool experience was second to none. Like giddy school kids, the Biltmore waterslide became a 20-something playground for an hour. From what I could tell the poolside was a mix of locals and tourists as I recognized some people (incl. JohnJay from KISS 104.7).  The best part of swimming on a Saturday afternoon at the Biltmore?   * The salsa demonstration (with a dozen or so salsas and chips prepared by the sous chef) was so extensive it was our lunch!   * Swim up to the bar (or sneak your own drinks and pass it off like you bought it) and buy a $10 margarita.   * Score a cabana rental if at all possible.  You get your own private shower, bathroom, AC'ed room, umbrellas, TV, patio chairs and server.  And it is well worth it.  And....I just spilled the beans to a perfect afternoon at the Biltmore."}
{"text":"The Biltmore has seen better days.  It still has all of the amenities one would expect from a nice resort, but the facility itself is simply getting a bit too dated.  I guess I expected more from a Waldorf property.    I stayed for a week as a part of a large conference. The meeting lunches and break food were very good overall, and the main ballroom was transformed into a beautiful party space that rivals the best clubs in Vegas.  The gym is spacious with great equipments, and there are several pools and tennis courts.   But the bedrooms can use an update.  My room was fine but again a bit dated; some cracks in the paint on the ceiling, wallpaper tearing at the edges.  A few of my colleagues ran into problems.  One stayed in a building where the furnace broke on a freezing night.  (Yes, below 32 in Phoenix!). One was briefly trapped in her room because the door handle fell off.   The lobby was under construction. Hopefully  they will rebuild more at Biltmore...."}
{"text":"I am a Hilton Honors member and was told as part of my membership I could request late checkout. I asked and was told hotel was full and my room was needed. I went online I noticed the exact same room and many others were wide open. Shame on Arizona Biltmore for lying. Won't be back and I'll spread the word to all my golf partners."}
{"text":"Stay at this hotel if you enjoy antique cars.  They're both similar: beautiful and timeless, but not as slick, efficient and polished as the their more cutting edge counterparts.  The hotel's architecture is fabulous as are the well manicured, flowered grounds.  In terms of the rooms, well, think of the antique cars.  WiFi & flat screen TVs but pretty much everything else (including the room's air conditioning) could be updated which is either annoying or part of the charm depending on what your frame of mind is.    Service at the hotel was mixed but overall pretty good.  I took 2 golf lessons which were relatively easy to schedule at the last minute and thought the pro was above average.  In terms of location, the hotel is pretty centrally located within easy reach of shopping and the airport.  That said, if you stay here, I suggest you rent a car for your stay in order to get around town."}
{"text":"Designed by Frank Lloyd Wright of course the 5 stars is for the architecture.  Although I don't particularly like his low ceilings all the fabulous detail work in the cement and glass have a timeless feel that is of a time all it's own.   Definitely worth a look if you're in the area. Heck even worth a drive out of the way  just to have a drink and just chill and take it all in."}
{"text":"We received complimentary gift and a bottle of wine today. I bumped the star to two stars because it tells me that they care. I am hoping they are doing well and getting better after the renovation, right now everything seems un-organized and messy.  The pool  policy a bit strange: you received towel card when you check in, then to get pool towel you have to walk all the way to the main pool exchange your towel card with a towel and at the end of the day you need to bring the towel back to get you towel card back, this is not a resort feeling/experience to me because pool is all the way at the Golf View Villa and there is no complementary cold water at this pool, it's 100+++ outside!! Anyway it's a strange pool towel policy. I wonder if people are stealing the pool towels that's why they have this policy?? But who would steal a hotel pool towel??? Strange!"}
{"text":"First of all many of you are WRONG!! This is not a Frank Lloyd Wright building! It was designed by Albert Chase McArthur, who was also a great architect of that time. However, there are some pieces of work by Frank Lloyd Wright inside the building (most notably the glass window in the entryway titled 'Saguaros'). Anyway this place is beautiful and great for any formal occasion. I went there recently for High Tea and it was fabulous. As many other reviews have said, this place is quite 'swanky' and many reviewers have commented variably on the service. This is not the soft, warming service of a place such as a Kimpton Resort; it has a more proper sense of service. Regardless they are very respectful and anything you ask of them is accommodated. You really can't go wrong at the Biltmore; the building and landscape are gorgeous, service is great, and the food is good!"}
{"text":"We had our wedding reception in the Aztec  room. Carrie Lage and her team gave us the wedding day of our dreams. Planning was easy and everything was taken care of as planned. My bridal suite and my families' rooms had a beautiful mountain and garden view.  What a view to wake up to on my wedding day!  The food and service and room decor were elegant and exceptional. My husband and I were treated with such kindness and genuine cheer by staff, we felt like a king and queen that day.  Several guests said that ours was the nicest wedding they have ever attended and one guest now wants to have her wedding at this luxurious resort. We will definitely have another event at the AZ Biltmore."}
{"text":"This is a beautiful property. The main hotel is historic and they give an overview of the history and tour to groups that have an interest.   We stayed in the Catalina Pool Villas which was a short walking distance from the main hotel. The room was spacious enough, clean, had a nice patio overlooking the pool and a two sink bathroom which I appreciated. This property is very spread out so depending on where you are staying and where your meeting is (assuming you are there on business), you may have a bit of a hike ahead of you.   I really enjoyed the comfortable lounge seating and fire pits in the back of the main hotel. What I did not enjoy is paying $9 for a bagel and coffee at The Cafe. Sorry, but that's just absurd.   Overall, this is a great resort but I would go off property for the meals I couldn't expense."}
{"text":"Had a drink in in the bar area...$18 for a martini.  That's pretty steep. Granted I know it's the famous Biltmore but I was kinda over it after walking around 5 minutes.  There's a lot of history there which is cool to hear about, but I'd spend my hard earned dollars elsewhere.   The pool area had a DJ and it was like some high school/college kids back yard party."}
{"text":"What a conundrum! I stayed here for four days while attending a conference at their convention center. Here's my issue: the rooms are in desperate need of loving repair, but the service and food are excellent! How do you rate such a place?  Immediately upon arrival, I was greeted with a line of luxury cars; Aston Martins, Ferraris, and even a Rolls Royce. I was excited to see my room after envisioning what it must be to attract such patrons!  At the check in counter, I was notified of an upgrade due to my Honors status - sweet!  Weary, hungry, and downright exhausted, it took me more than 30 min to find my room as nobody had explained that the SECOND number in the room number was the floor number, and not the FIRST number. Not to mention, the compound is a veritable maze! The paths are all outdoors in the Arizona sun and are not well-lit at night. Bring water and/or a taser for any trek outside!  I finally found my room, only to open my door to a flood, due to a faulty room fridge. The hotel was sold out, so all my clean towels became devoted to the impromptu entryway kiddie pool. The front desk offered a housekeeping/maintenance resolution in 90 min, but I was too tired, so I opted for a soggy floor with sopping wet towels, and my head on the pillow.  The next morning, I called and asked the front desk to execute on the previous night's resolution, which was to dry the carpet and replace the fridge. I hopped into the shower to get ready for the conference and I noticed a severely rusty air vent. As I wondered how something like that would rust in Arizona, I was suddenly standing in pool #2. The shower was clogged and rapidly flooding. Gross.  I hurried my shower to avoid a tsunami, then went through the path labyrinth to my conference. Eventually, I came back to the room, expecting all to be resolved; apparently, my expectations were way too high.  I returned to a note above the broken fridge that said, \"I unplugged it. Call front desk if you want a new one.\" Ummmmm.... didn't I do that already? Twice?  On the very positive side, all the food was absolutely delicious! And even though the staff couldn't seem to get it together for the fridge, housekeeping did dry the carpet and the people were just as nice as can be! No airs, no pretentiousness; just a sincere willingness to help make my stay as pleasant as they could in an old, worn out hotel.   I keep bouncing between two and three stars, but the bottom line is that I wouldn't stay here again by choice, based on the sub standard room for a premium price.  Although, proximity (only 3.5 miles) to Camelback mountain and gorgeous hiking is pretty darned attractive.  Update: I forgot to mention that exhaust was pouring from the AC vent for the first day.  I just checked out of the room and the front desk compensated me for my troubles; once again - SUPER nice people!  Breakfast was bomb... ok, three stars."}
{"text":"Booked a week long stay for Spring Break with family and was deeply disappointed.  The website states spring break and March has a band at the pool and movie night for the family in the main pool.  Nope.  Food is marginal at best and not kid friendly.  Service is a 3 out of 5.  Poolside Dining is scant and the pool frequently runs out of towels.  Not a five star hotel but rather 3 star but at 5 star pricing.   Bikes for bike rental are in poor condition.   Buyer Beware."}
{"text":"I got to stay here for work and had the best time! They have so many pools. I would spend my afternoons in the smaller pools and have the pool all to myself. It was great! They let me send free postcards which was fun, too. My room was beautiful. It was large and had great amenities.   Food was disgusting though. I didn't have access to a car so I was pretty limited to eating hotel food for a week. Everything I ordered was gross and I tried it ALL!  I thought customer service was fine--not great, just adequate."}
{"text":"Scorpions in the bed, no privacy on the patio, construction in the quiet zone of the spa and a general over rated faux Frank Lloyd Wright building!   Nice gym good food, but I left here feeling not rested."}
{"text":"This was the worst week of my life staying at this  historic hotel instead it turned out to be the biggest waste of money.  We had 4 rooms 9 people and paid big bucks for the quality of service you would expect from a motel 6 . The front desk managers (David & Auda) need to take refresher courses in guest relations but more importantly that all import guest 5 star service. Never will we return I suggest the same to all who look at spending their hard earned money on Nothing special!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This one amazing resort if the history and the grounds didn't keep you here the service and the amenities will. We came to celebrate our first wedding anniversary for a little staycation. Check in was a breeze, the gentleman checked me in early. I booked a king but only queens were available I didn't mind and he booked me into a queen room with a balcony in the terrace court. So no complaints. When I get to my room there's actually a maintenance person in the room fixing something's getting something's in order so I peak my head in and ask if I could drop my stuff off there must have been some confusion. The guy his name was Joe was very apologetic and kept telling me he was sorry. I didn't think anything of it I was going to go workout regardless so it didn't bother me. He let me change in the bathroom and i went on my way. Went to the gym which is very nice attached to the spa and the equipment is up to date which is awesome but I guess you can afford new gym equipment for how much guest pay here. But anyways get back to my room and Joe had left a note saying that he had given us a credit to Frank and Alberts. I wasn't expecting that and it wasn't his fault but very appreciative for the gesture. We went to Frank & Alberts and just had some drinks, pretzel bites, and a pizza it was delicious. This was all Friday night. Saturday we hung out by the pool made a few friends. It was a great way to spend our anniversary. The resort made it amazing. The staff was very friendly everyone you meet is in a good mood or smiling and will say hello to you. The beds are nice pillowtop mattresses and the pillows have a lot of support. The room itself is simple and elegant. The TV channels offered are good. They give you an assortment of movie channels which is pretty cool. I would definitely stay here again and would recommend that anyone that has an appreciation for architecture take the tour provided by the hotel!"}
{"text":"Amazing hotel - everything you need. I felt like a 50's movie star there, very weird. Was there for work, but would return for enjoyment anytime."}
{"text":"We specifically went to the hotel last night to listen to some jazz in the lobby hotel--knew the drinks were expensive but in the past --it has been great to listen music in that setting.  The website lists the music.  When we got there and asked the waiter when the music would start--they said--they hadn't had music for 8 months.  It would have been nice to have known up front that the music was no longer happening.  Please change your website to be more accurate in its representation."}
{"text":"The Biltmore used to be one of our favorite luxury hotels in the Valley of the Sun. So when we needed to go for a last-minute family event (a funeral), we made a reservation there. Though the room was nice, the service and the parking were not. In fact, they were so bad I don't think I will recommend it any more. What a shame... it used to set the bar...  Details: the self-parking is as far as possible from the rooms, and we were very uncomfortable finding our way there (poor signage) in 116 degree heat. When we asked for a late checkout, the front desk manager just said no. There was no care or concern for what our needs may have been. He didn't even ask how late we needed! Just no."}
{"text":"The Biltmore is an incredible resort and even nicer than many other properties I have seen in my 7 years of travel experience through the Caribbean, Mexico and even Hawaii.  This resort is large, with beautiful impressive landscaping, fabulous Frank Lloyd Wright architecture, multiple pools, and an amazing golf course.    I opted for the Octallia rooms, which are in a newer section with upgraded in room amenities along with access to the Concierge area where you can get free drinks, snacks, breakfast and access to someone to assist with dinner reservations, business center, etc.  Our room was spacious and luxurious.  I realllllly liked our room. I am big into having a comfortable place to sleep, cuddle with my honey and nap when the weather turns sour. I don't understand people who don't like nice rooms, b/c you really do spend a lot of time in there.  I looooved the bathroom which had a deep oversized tub (my fave) and I appreciated the small touches like the sea salt and nice bath products.    The pools are busy if you choose one of the two main pool options, but the staff around them was easily accessible, friendly and honest.  We had no issues and the day we rented the cabana at the pool ($150 for partial sun/$200 for all day sun) we received outstanding service.  The cabana had a nice little room, TV and it's own bathroom along with an outdoor table and two lounge chairs.  If you prefer to have a pool to yourself, the Octallia area is deserted as well as a couple of other smaller pools but they ALSO do not have poolside service.  Chairs by the pools are first come, first serve and on the weekends, it did appear to be difficult to score a good chair so get down there early.  This resort is also incredibly family friendly.  We were there at the tail-end of spring break which was obvious as there were tons of families in the pool and running around the property.  This didn't bother us at all but I was a little surprised.  The main pool did offer a slide but it wasn't operating.  Anyway - the point is, a great luxury family friendly option for those with kiddos!  The spa was incredible.  We got 80 minute Dream Maker massages and it was AWESOME (but expensive).  I felt pampered and relaxed after.  Well worth it but oh so pricey.  The reason I am not going to give this place 5 stars is b/c everything is CRAZY expensive.  I mean, everything is literally double what it would be anywhere else and room service carried a $4 delivery charge along with a 23% surcharge tax on top of the already crazy 14% \"tourism\" tax which we paid at every hotel in the city. . RIDICULOUS.  So please keep in mind, everything is on the pricier side. This is not a \"budget\" friendly place.   But it is a luxury resort in a fabulous location with beautiful areas to dine outdoors and enjoy a drink with the ones you love.  If you are comfortable with the price, upgrade to the Octallia rooms - it's all in the details."}
{"text":"Very nice resort but very confusing.  I went for a conference and spent 20 minutes driving around the grounds.  I had a hard time finding an employee to ask.  I found a restaurant and gold course on property but both were locked.  Finally, I found an employee who gave me incorrect directions, which lead me into a neighborhood.   Once I found the ballroom, I was impressed.  The facility was large and very nice.  They served us breakfast which was very tasty."}
{"text":"The Arizona Biltmore has definitely seen its day. A now old and venerable resort property. A visual scan detects efforts to modernize and update the sprawling facility. However, the property is still clinging on the history that made it posh. Look deeper into the cracks and omissions masonry work that's missing and cracked or heavily damaged. Woodwork that is faded and dirty. The pool is very dated, and packed. Not a comfortable environment to relax and enjoy the blazing sun. In the evening, only one touchier worked above the pool slide, and while walking the property, it exposed many burned out lighting fixtures. I came upon an entryway that had it automatic door falling off its hinges. It's an OK facility however not the 5 star resort it once was. Sad Mr. Frank Lloyd Wright, it aged but the Hiltons couldn't keep up."}
{"text":"This is the second time I have been here at the Biltmore for an event in the last month. Both times the self parking gate was not working, creating an incredibly long backup and delay to get out. We have now been sitting here for 30 minutes and have not moved. Biltmore management- spend the money and fix the damn gate or take the gate down! Pathetic customer service."}
{"text":"What a nice hotel! My fiance and I enjoyed every bit of our stay. The grounds are very well manicured and the architecture is something to look at. Even in July with the hot weather, the hotel was pretty crowded. Lots of families with money to burn.   There are 8 pools spread around the property and they each seem to have a different atmosphere. The two pools we went to were the large ones right in the middle of the property with the slide and the swim-up bar. If you have some extra cash, get yourself an $8 beer (!) in the bottle. Otherwise, bring your own. The slide is fun. It doesn't go as fast as I'd like but it's something to do at the pool. The big downside at the pools is that the hot weather heats them up so much that they should actually be cooled off. They were probably 90 degrees... bath water. Not as refreshing as you'd like them to be.  The buildings and rooms are very nice, clean, spacious, neat and comfortable. I could have taken a nap all day in our room. One drawback is that some buildings and rooms are far from the parking lot. You have quite a ways to walk if you don't valet.  With the recession and hot weather, rates are pretty low right now for this excellent hotel. Give it a shot."}
{"text":"No complaints -- had a great stay here.  Beautiful estate and admirable architecture.  Decent restaurants inside and a swanky bar that satisfied all drink yearnings.  Good golf course too.  Service was exemplary, room was nice, all around good vibes and positive energy.  Great to walk around the property and check out all the history and architecture.  Life size chess set was fun to play with as well."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my night stay at the biltmore the monday after the superbowl.  As a diamond member for over 8 years I live in Hiltons and this one was one of the better ones when it came to the layout and the property.  I was so impressed with the layout and grounds.  it was just great looking.  The front desk was great and with a little coaching we got two rooms facing the pool with a walk out deck.  The bed was one of the best I have slept in and really enjoyed the main circle eating area with drinks.  Our waitress was great and the only problem I would point out was the lack of service when my mom was asking for a sandwich to be ready to go in the morning and everyone we asked just kept pushing it to the next person.  At a biltmore they should be a little more in tune with when a customer asks for something make it happen and don't make them work to spend money at your place.  also they need to clean the porches off between visits (there were a couple cigarette butts on the patio but overall I was impressed and would return no doubt"}
{"text":"Beautiful grounds & rooms, but a few fatal flaws.  PROS: -The gorgeous lush green grounds  -The Terrace room was newly remodeled, very clean and spacious (the bathroom especially--even a separate shower and standalone bathtub!) -Onsite dining was delicious from the walk-in cafe to the sit-down restaurants -High tea served in the afternoons   CONS: -All 3 pools were small and unimpressive without enough seating (very dated)  -NO bathrooms at the pool. You have to trek back to your room..... hmmm, who wants to bet that some guests opt to pee elsewhere.....? -Self parking is very far from the hotel -The grounds are very large, and much walking in the hot AZ heat is required  OVERALL, this hotel is a historic gem and probably worthy of a visit, but there are many other lush hotels to choose from in the area if you plan to spend a lot of time poolside and you want to skip a lot of walking in the scorching heat."}
{"text":"For the price?  ...hell yes I've experienced better!  Place is alright but not work the price.  If you're big on golfing and too lazy to drive or 90 years old, this is your spot! Enjoy it."}
{"text":"I love this place, but stay in the newer part for better air conditioning."}
{"text":"Had the nachos since nothing else appealed to me.  I have had better nacho cheese at a Football game.  Pretty bad."}
{"text":"It does not get any better than this!  This place is STUNNING. One of the most beautiful hotels I have ever stayed in. I stayed in a villa and only one night. The pools are beautiful and the Villas have their own private pool. One that I know of had a water slide. It is very spacious in the inside, I had my own fireplace, full on kitchen, dining, and living room with a huge patio. Wifi is free, which is fabulous, soft beds, office area, full walk in closet, bathroom with two sinks, a shower and separate tub. I ordered breakfast which was great, but the fruit bowl tasted funny there was some sort of seasoning on it that I am not used to. There are no elevators but it is only two levels, so the bell boy helped me with my bags. The service was very fast, whenever I called and needed something I did wait long at all, they where fast with everything. Also there was a scorpion in my room that crawled up under the sink in the kitchen, I am from the east coast and I have never seen one before so I was terrified! They sent security over to catch him and they stayed there until they did. Then they offered me free services, or food, and a different room. I thought it was nice of them to ask that and surprised because I hear scorpions are common out there. I believe this place is top notch, the staff was very helpful and friendly with any questions, beautiful place and my only disappointment is that I could not stay longer! I hope to be back soon!"}
{"text":"Got a good rate compared to others for the Mr's 30th High School reunion. Alas with the good rate also goes the \"priceline\" location.  If you use priceline you know what I am talking about- the room next to the stairs or ice machine with a view of roof air conditioners.  In this case we did not use priceline- just a group code so we were in the very corner of the terrace building with a view of the street.  The room was nice and the bed very comfortable, there were quite a few stains on the carpet though and my standard bathtub at home is larger than the tub in the room.  I think priceline and the rooms at the local casinos have spoiled me! For 1/3 of the price we paid here you get waay better there. I would not pay full price to stay here, especially now that I can cross it off my list of places to see.  The terrace building kind of reminds me of the old melrose place show, it has it's own little pool.  There are a lot of pools on the property, I thought the Catalina pool which is all tile was the coolest, it has a fountain that separates the kid's side which is shallow (think 50's).  The front desk said they call it the Marilyn Monroe pool because she always said that it was her favorite pool in the whole world.  Other posters mentioned tours but we were not advised of one.  We went to the concierge and told them we wanted to learn more about this fabulous property so gave us a map and told us to wander, they even let us go into the \"history room\" which is a 2 story meeting room located on the 3rd floor with all of the history of the building of the property we thought that was the coolest!   The reunion was on the golf course next to the pro shop.  All I have to say about the food is YUCK-O!  They had green salad with 3 dressings and cold mushy penne pasta with red sauce.   Dis Gus TING!!  The reunion was supposed to go to 11pm and they shut the bar down at 10pm.  That actually was a smart thing to get the laggers moving on.  I don't get other yelpers complaining about \"pool-hoppers\" or non-paying guests at \"their\" pools.  I didn't see over crowding at any of the pools nor as a guest was I told that we could only use the pool in our area.  Do you really think people are going to pay $28 to park on property to pool hop?  What you guys are saying seems weird to me."}
{"text":"My parents stayed at this hotel years ago and they thought it was awesome. However our experience was a little different. We had two scorpions in our room of which we killed both and called the front desk for some assistance and to move us.  They moved us to the fourth floor. The next night we accidentally took the service elevator of which there were tons of scorpions on the fourth floor where they store all of their rollaway beds. Although we did not have scorpions on our fourth floor room we had terrible bug bites. This property is beautiful however they need to take the time to fumigate everything and try to solve their bug problem.  I would recommend  staying at a different hotel until this is resolved."}
{"text":"What a wonderful way to end our visit to Phoenix and Sedona. We were treated to magnificent new rooms that walk out into the pool area. We started the morning with a glorious hot tub followed by a delicious breakfast outside on the patio.   After a day of visiting Frank Lloyd Wrights home Taliesin West and local Zen Gardens we came home to a beautiful spread including 8 assorted fruits, seeds and nuts and a full bottle of my beloveds favorite wine. I don't know how it could get better than this!"}
{"text":"besides being the set for a ricky martin music video (or christina agulera, not sure) this place is SICK. you must hit up the wetbar in the pool, which is right next to one of the best waterslides in a private hotel in phoenix.  this place is classy classy, and your bill will show it, but it is just all around a great hotel."}
{"text":"Gorgeous hotel that may or may not have been the work of Frank Lloyd Wright. It's undisputed that Frank Lloyd Wright came out to Arizona to work on the Biltmore, but how much did he contribute? The Arizona Biltmore won't tell. They're coy about it. A bit high priced. It's been thru several owners since the economic meltdown, but the new ownership group is supposed to be pumping money into it for a much needed refurbishment. A nice experience."}
{"text":"Great place to stay for fans of Frank Lloyd Weight or Art Deco Architecture. The grounds are beautiful and there are many restaurants on the campus and nearby. There are many different types of rooms with differing views and styles and prices. I've eaten at the restaurants which I've liked as well."}
{"text":"What a mess.  We booked our 30th anniversary trip after considering a number of 4-5 star resorts (Cloisters, Boca Club, others) and decided on the Biltmore.  I wanted my wife to experience the old world charm of a turn-of-the-century charmer.  NOT!  The historic lobby, which is the soul of the complex was UNDER CONSTRUCTION. That would have been good to know - but NEVER on the website or in any communication was this called out.  The entire place was a \"work-around\", with this not in service and that in service.  This alone was a severe disappointment.  Second - this is definitely ONLY a Hilton in resort garb.  The wait service was spotty.  Restaurant service was generally \"okay\" but at the bars we seemed invisible.  At poolside (two times) we had to wait 20 minutes then go to the pool bar to get attention, only to hear - it's early in the season so we are not fully staffed. Uh, what??  A resort claiming 4 or 5 stars is NEVER understaffed, rather it should feel overstaffed.  Our housekeeping was spotty as well.  And, outside our bungalow - for three days - sat light bulbs from overheads that needed changing as well as wine glasses, cocktail glasses and other room service items that sat on a planter wall the entire time.  Might as well be living in West Las Vegas for all I could see.   Then, there were the little things.  Like toilet paper you'd expect at a truck stop.  And we weren't the only ones.  At breakfast one day, we met a sales director who'd brought 150 of his team to the Biltmore and was shocked - SHOCKED - that he had not been informed of the renovation and construction.  This is bad business practice. But, mainly, the bottom line is that the BIltmore seems to have irrevocably fallen into mediocrity.  We would have chosen a different place for an important celebration - and we certainly will not go back."}
{"text":"This hotel is beautiful and amazing.  The service was outstanding. We attended the Easter Brunch today.  It was quite something and even the $95 per person seemed worth it (buffet style).    Then our bill came.  My understanding was the $95 included the champagne.   It did not.  Then the automatic tip was added, which I'm sure with buffet style presentation most wouldn't tip 18% (we would have).    Then below the tip and meal charges was a \"service fee\" of an additional 18%.  Now, I will admit I would have still gone.  But these surprise additions brought the total to over $135 per person.    So take my review as it is. Ask a lot of questions."}
{"text":"AZ Biltmore Resort ....Always classic. Always classy."}
{"text":"Service sub par, bed sheets were not clean, I expected more."}
{"text":"Overall a beautiful hotel with stunning scenery and good food/drinks.  The concern that we had was with the following:  1) Internet was SO slow and half of the time it didn't even work.  When I called the front desk for help, they gave me some random 800 number to call.  You'd think they would have this figured out being that they charge an arm and a leg? 2) House keeping:  We would get a knock at around 8/830 and we'd yell to come back about 10 times.  Then once while my boyfriend was in the bathroom and someone just entered without knocking to refill the mini bar!  It was a total invasion of privacy. 3) Noise - our cottage was right outside a putting area so we'd have kids screaming right outside our balcony all day long.  Also, the person who trims the hedges came at 730 AM and stayed for what seemed like hours. 4) Concierge takes forever to get a hold of.  I mean we're talking 15-20 minutes. 5) Cost for extra activities - why in the world would it cost $30 to play tennis for an hour when all of the courts are empty?  Crazy.  I'd say scenery/resort/amenities are good, but service/noise/value for money are average to below."}
{"text":"Spa week is just ending.   Quite a few spas run specials for this event.   My friend and I went to the Biltmore for facials and massages.   The services were fine but the facility is not.   It got the creeps in the shower.   What exactly was that in the grout?   The locker room is the worst.  I am 5' 3\" and the receptionist gave me an upper locker.   I couldn't even see the floor of the locker much less reach any of the hooks.  What were they thinking?  Maybe women were taller when they built this?   I am a spa girl and this is crossed off the list of \"want to go backs\".  The Biltmore itself it spectacular.   We had fun at the pool.  We had a lovely lunch and went in the pool    We were the only adults on the water slide but who cares.     So services were fine, the property is spectacular, but the spa facility needs an extreme makeover soon.  (I think it may be coming)"}
{"text":"Having previously stayed at the original Waldorf and most recently at the Waldorf in Berlin, I feel comfortable judging the level of Waldorf service. I am also a frequent business guest with Hilton and a gold level member of their rewards program. When I checked-in for my stay here, admittedly early with the understanding that I would have access to my room as soon as it was ready, or by check in time at 4. I tried checking on my room later around 2 pm--not ready yet--no problem, I'll grab a bite to eat and try at 4. Final attempt, after 4pm--room is still not ready. My question to the desk agent, \"isn't check-in at 4?\".  \"Yes\", was the terse reply--no apology, no explanation. Needless to say, not meeting the level of traditional Waldorf service.   Disappointing--I'm glad I didn't bring my spouse and I suppose I will cross this Waldorf off my list for a repeat stay."}
{"text":"I couldn't agree more with Fly I. The front-end experience leaves a lot to be desired. It's Hilton-managed and Morgan-Stanley owned, so one should expect more, or perhaps not. It's not Kimpton service, that's for sure:  Our room was robbed. The management reaction was professional (i.e., what had to be done was done), and that's it--no high-touch, no check-in a day later to see if everything was OK, no offer to replace stolen goods (\"we need to hear back from our insurance company\").  The wait staff at Frank & Alberts was great, but the maitre d's were pretty clueless--one night, they didn't want to seat us in the garden because they \"had just seated 50 people.\" We insisted, but they kept wanting to seat us in the stuffy bar--somehow, that would work better.... Finally, they gave in, and sat us in the back. Our waitron said she had four tables, and didn't know what the front was talking about. That pretty much sums up the disconnect at Ariz. Biltmore.  The happy hour at F&A's is great, if uneven--one night the mojito is weak, the next night it's wicked strong. I ordered a vodka gimlet and got a vodka lemonade.... But if you don't like the drink, the wait-staff will happily have a new one made. High concept: you want to overtip the staff, and short-change the hotel.  The setting is beautiful, and this place could be an absolute must-return visit. But right now, it's off our short list.  Follow-up: after posting this, I read through other Yelp-ers reviews--there are at least two other theft stories here, and that's just Yelpers: Arizona Biltmore-get your act together!"}
{"text":"The coolness factor is off the charts.  The challenge is it gets a lot of use and it shows in certain areas.  The arm rests on the club chairs in the lobby bar where worn and dirty.  The shower faucet was basically worn out.  I will start by saying I am a pillow snob, but still the pillows are embarrassment.   We stayed in  a cottage that was very spacious and comfortable with a great view. The diner at Frank and Alberts was fantastic."}
{"text":"Recently spent 5 nights at the Arizona Biltmore and have nothing but GREAT things to say about it.   It's a beautiful, incredibly well kept resort with a rich history.   My wife and I enjoyed the all-inclusive package which I HIGHLY recommend. With your room, you also get $50 voucher for breakfast, $50 voucher for lunch, and a $96 voucher for dinner. Let's just say we ate REALLY well this week!!! We ate 15 meals at Frank & Alberts. It's without a doubt one of the best restaurants we've ever been to. And we strive to only eat the best!   Beautiful hotel, tremendous staff, highly recommend it!!"}
{"text":"Hotel grounds are beautiful and the history is very interesting. One of our days was spent at the spa with 4 girlfriends. Staff was wonderful especially Leslie the manager who went beyond our expectations of customer service.   Looking forward to booking another get a way at the Biltmore."}
{"text":"Not a service oriented property.  We were over charged on check out and despite how I fought it they would not remove the charges.  The Ocotillo rooms are very small and the property is crowded.  The structure build by Wright is beautiful.  They don't know how to run it."}
{"text":"We recently stayed at this gorgeous property for six glorious days. We stayed in the Ocatilla building which was beautiful, and a short walk from the Ocatilla pool and the main pool. All the staff was very kind and helpful throughout our stay.   The main pool was packed on Saturday (which is to be expected) and there were no seats available. The pool manager was so kind and helpful and assisted us in purchasing a cabana for the day- quite honestly, best money ever spent.   We had a package that included all three meals at the property's restaurants. Frank and Albert's is amazing for all meals. Their waffles for breakfast were my absolute favorite. For lunch and dinner, we were a little picky when it came to the menu but there was no hesitation in changing and adapting it to our wants and needs. What kept us coming back even more than the food was the amazing wait staff, they were all so kind and friendly and took the time to speak with you, not just take your order and rush away.   We left the resort saying \"we can't wait to plan our next stay here!\""}
{"text":"What a fantastic place!  Spent the weekend there for a girls trip, great service from the front desk, restaurants and spa.  Susan in the Octatilla Club was absolutely amazing greeted us by name everyday, made sure our wine glass was always full and snacks were readily available.  Sonia in the spa gave me one of the best massages I've ever received.    Great architecture, beautiful grounds and wonderful seating outside with fire pits  This is a must stay if your in Phoenix for a beautiful relaxing vacation."}
{"text":"Came here for a company conference and enjoyed the old feel (everything in Phoenix feels new) except for the lack of air conditioning in elevators and other parts.   From the concierge to the valets to the beautiful rooms and nice restaurant I had a great time with great service.   To the tall people of this world- be prepared to duck a lot; his hotel was made with fashionably short ceilings to help keep cooling costs low back in the day. Good thing I'm short. ;)"}
{"text":"I was here for a business conference, Thursday-Saturday.  We arrived early (around 11am) and they were able to check us in without any hassle at all.  I think their normal check-in time is 4pm.  The service was great, very helpful in pointing out where everything was on the map.  This was a plus because the Arizona Biltmore has many separate buildings on their massive grounds.    The lobby was nice and airy with lots of places to sit.  I also noticed a restaurant and a bar.  Walking outside, there are lounge chairs and cabanas for those who didn't mind the heat.  For being in the desert, the AB was definitely very green.  Lots of grass, palm trees and shrubbery to highlight the beautiful resort grounds.  The architecture here is also amazing.  Definitely look at the details in the stones, glass, walkways, doorways, and almost everywhere else.  It's quite entrancing.    We took the short trek to our room (it was a trek because the weather was about 100 degrees and rising).  I opened the door to my room and was pleasantly surprised by the size.  It's larger than the usual hotel rooms but with all the nice amenities (flat screen, internet, king size bed with lots of thread count sheets, etc...).  Typical hotel room decor -- just lots of open space (enough for me to do a cartwheel).  The bathroom was equally nice and roomy as well.  They have a separate shower and bathtub.  There are 2 sinks and I liked the stone tiles on the ground.  The towels were very soft and the robe was a nice touch (even though it dwarf me with the sleeves hanging past my fingertips and the length practically dragging on the ground...).  I was sad I didn't have much time to enjoy the \"resort\" part of the hotel though.  Their golf course/putting greens was beautifully manicured (although I don't play golf); the pool areas were all very inviting and kept beckoning me to just jump in -- business suit and all.  And I probably would have, if not for the fact that I can't swim.  Darn.  I did get to enjoy the food and bar though.  The food for the conference was surprisingly good.  We even had a petite filet mignon dish that was very nicely cooked and flavored.  The bar was nice -- but expensive.  Mixed drinks were about $12 - $14.  Room service was impeccable, the concierge was knowledgeable and courteous, and the conference went well.  I truly enjoyed my stay here -- sans the scorching temperature of course.   That I could have done without just fine."}
{"text":"One of the best pools in the valley in my opinion! {& delicious cocktails too!} They have great deals on cabanas and summer room specials! #staycation"}
{"text":"Very neat place.  Stayed here for a company meeting and yes I would consider coming back to this place.  Nice rooms. The property is nice and we really like the courtyard. Nice bar overall and experience great."}
{"text":"Less than great experience this weekend.  Booked a villa as well as an additional room with a fire pit for my family.  The room had damage to the wall from where the previous guest had hit the corner of the wall and caused damage, the front panel of the drawer in the master bath had been pulled off and there was still room service buckets, plates and dishes from the previous guest when we checked in.  In addition, the additional room I booked for my family was supposed to include a fire pit, but there wasnt.  When we asked about it, we were discounted.  Moments after check in, we called hotel front desk to report damage, the hotel security questioned us as if we had caused the damage.  Hotel front desk said it was all they had...sad face..."}
{"text":"The Arizona Biltmore is an amazingly beautiful hotel rich in both its history and design. Located on a stunning piece of property littered with fresh fruit trees and 8 day-dream inducing pools, the hotel offers various lodging options for any need spanning from your standard queen suite, to an ivy entwined glass casita destined to make the most well-known disney princess swoon. Both hotel restaurants (Frank & Alberts + Wright's At The Biltmore) give ode to the buildings Architect Consultant* - commonly misconcepted as the Biltmore's actual architect - Frank Lloyd Wright. We utilized the hotel's on-site bicycles and explored the fancy private neighborhood surrounding the hotel which I would highly recommend.  The hotel was an all around experience that I give ten stars! Would recommend!"}
{"text":"My wife and I stayed here last night. This place falls short on just about every level possible. The staff is seemingly careless about customer service. The fee, wow the fees. I was aware this place is expensive but they nickel and dime you for anything and everything. 33% of our bill was extra fees."}
{"text":"The grounds are nice.  Wright's is lovely and the food is fantastic.  The bar is a lovely place for a drink and cozy conversation.  My only complaint is the spa.  Not the service, but the product they sell.  I loved my facial even though is was far more expensive than what I generally spend.  However, they recommended for me to purchase the $200 Clarisonic facial brush.  I am still dealing with the issues of a defective product a month after my vacation.  They have sent me a replacement that is also defective and I am up to my eyeballs in boxes and return labels.  DO NOT buy expensive products from spas on vacation!  Otherwise the stay was lovely and the staff wonderful and helpful.  A cabana is a great idea for an afternoon by the pool.  It is worth the price."}
{"text":"Outside Architecture = Stunning. The inside of the rooms is nothing special. For the high price you can find better hotels in the area.  I stayed in a cottage house. They're almost 100 years old and express unique, aesthetically pleasing architecture. The age shows when you come inside. I had to waste an hour getting the door unlocked several time because either my plastic or physical key weren't working. This hassle with no upgrade is what really drove my dissatisfaction.  The pools here are expansive and feature multiple Jacuzzi's. The SPA is fantastic, i ordered a 80minute full body massaged and mud wrap to reward myself for the hard work of writing mba essay applications and feel completely relaxed.  My favorite thing about staying here was the mountain bike ride i took with my guide chip. We went super-fast for three hours down rocky ravines. It was exhilarating. If it's your first time doing it though you're bound to get bruised. Only go if you've Mt. biked a few times before as you'll find the course technically challenging.  Restaurants are solid. Go for the fine dining restaurant Wright if you get the chance. Lobby beer selection is acceptable with four microbrews on tap but needs more high gravity selections. DO NOT order food delivered to your room. There is a ridiculous $10 fee and the restaurant is a 2 minute walk. I paid $25 for Scrambled eggs... ridiculous.  I had a great time, thanks Landauer & IDN conference. I would not comeback here on my own unless extensive room upgrades were made."}
{"text":"I love these historic grand hotels.  So, yes, I have a bias.  The architecture is excellent as it was designed by Frank Lloyd Wright.  The lobby is nice, good choice of restaurants, the grounds are excellent and good pools.  My room is well appointed, nice workstation, nice bathroom with lots of room and a comfortable bed.  I've stayed here before and look forward to doing so again."}
{"text":"For all the pomp this place fails to meet some minimum expectations like clean bathrooms in the guestroom. Also, make sure you check your bill before you leave, apparently you get charged for looking at the minibar. More properly called the Arizona Billmore."}
{"text":"I stayed here for a work conference, and it was overall okay. It wasn't my favorite hotel - everything seemed really low in terms of ceilings, but that seems to be standard for all the Frank Lloyd Wright things that I've seen. The resort is huge - I don't think I walked the entire thing. If you bring a water bottle with you, you can refill it with the water they have sitting outside.   My hotel room was in the main building - it seemed clean, but it didn't really have a great view. If you're outside of the main building, I'm sure you can get better views and rooms, but I know that some of my coworkers who upgraded out of the main area were complaining about the scorpions that had made it into their rooms.  The staff at the hotel was super nice - I have a chocolate allergy and they went out of their way to find a dessert I could eat with the provided meals. There's a bus that takes you to the mall around the corner - the people who drove the bus were always really friendly. It picks you up between the burger place and Blanco's.  I probably wouldn't stay here again on my own, but it was a nice overall experience for me."}
{"text":"There were so many things wrong with our visit, I wish I had stayed at home.  Staying here was my idea, which is a decision that has caused four days of arguments with my wife... Not something that any family wants to deal with on a vacation.  An earlier draft of this review outlined each of the issues.  It was so long, it seemed that I was embellishing... Even though I wasn't. So, I deleted it and replaced it with this one.  Sure, the hotel credited us some money back, but a family vacation isn't about the money... It's about the experience.  This experience sucked.  I will never stay here again - so your offer to \"take care of me next time\" won't be needed.  I don't need to take that chance.  When writing most of my negative reviews I think,\"I hope you improve.\" But I really don't care if you do or don't.  Seriously, anything would be an improvement... But again, it's a non-issue because I won't be back."}
{"text":"My friend's wedding was held in the Aztec Room at the Arizona Biltmore and was incredible.   Everything from the service, grounds, food and other amenities were out of this world. I'm not often impressed by resorts (many boast similar qualities). However, this one stood out (perhaps it being in Phoenix) and has some incredible history behind it as well.   Also, if you don't want to stay there, you can also just visit for a day trip and get pampered and eat at some great restaurants like Frank and Alberts (among others)"}
{"text":"I haven't yet stayed at this resort, but I've been to many events here. I recently met one of my girlfriends there for HH. We started in Wright's for a drink and then moved into Frank and Albert's for their HH. They have some great HH specials there and the HH menu is pretty fun. It features small plates/tastings of various items. As expected, the food is phenom. We ended up ordering dinner as well. Make sure you save room for dessert. There signature dessert item is a salted butterscotch pudding. Believe me when I say \"2 Die 4!\"  Atmosphere has a cool buzz, not at all pretentious as some might expect."}
{"text":"I was here just one night for a business event so did not have much time to enjoy the grounds and pools.  I don't golf either so the place is a bit wasted on me but I can appreciate that this is a historic property and a luxurious resort.  The architecture does not really try to integrate with the Phoenix area; unlike say the JW Marriott or the Phoenician this resort is lush with lots of green spaces and trees; not the hardscapes and desert plans that feature so prominently at other properties in the area.  The building themselves feel almost Mesopotamian in design; the bricks and construction conjured to mind images of ziggurats of Babylonia.  It's beautiful but not like the pueblo themed lodgings I've seen elsewhere.  The common space was pleasant, the service attentive, and the bar area quite nice.  The catered food for our business advisory board was fairly mediocre.  Certainly not bad but nothing that stood out as special either.  A nice place to stay overall.  Would return although I tend to prefer spaces that blend a bit more with the local environment (and likely consume less water in the desert)."}
{"text":"An acceptable property but certainly not a Waldorf=Astoria property.  The property is more like a Sheraton with a nice outdoor area with firepits.  Upon checking in, i was told they had moved my room to a nicer room because i did not have my service dog with me (i am under the impression that they violate law by charging you for a service animal or a regular animal- they are treated all the same and charge an outrageous fee when they shouldn't be charging for a service dog ... I said great thanks. Upon checking out apparently they charged me for that upgraded room $40 per night without telling me.  I was not informed at check in that there would be an additional charge.   That was a bit uncouth and not expected. I am now arguing with the hotel to get that additional fee removed. I received a call today from a lady who spoke very softly, and very quietly with a rehearsed monotone voice; she kept cutting me off every time i tried to explain the situation; which is a sales tactic that is taught to throw the \"complainer\" off their game so that they are confused and move on.  Not this complainer - thankfully I have a staff of sales people,I wrote the book on sales calling.  The way I was treated by this individual was not acceptable and was not warranted.  Seems like I am going to have to call American Express and have them deal with this hotel and contest the entire bill as i was not satisfied. The mattresses in the rooms were rock hard and not comfortable - the pillows we were provided (3 plus a spare we had to take from the closet) was so flat we had to crumple them up to sleep. Any luxury hotel knows that maintenance should be done but not seen.  This property had maintenance carts sitting in the lobby of the Ocotilla building that you had to walk around to even access the elevator (only two)  The pool space was quite nice and the bartender by the Ocotilla pool was extremely pleasant, and helpful.  Our drinks and our food came out quite fast.  No complaints here.  We went to the spa and did a 50 minute spa pedicure. I had asked for a reflexology treatment - they said this was as close as they had.  We paid over $200 for 2 pedicures.  Now, i live in Beverly Hills - i am use to tourist prices but thats a bit extreme - none the less we were happy with the service, so again, no complaints here.  Valet had the car upfront when we asked them to, again no complaints.  My main complaint was the fact that they did not ask me if i wanted to pay the upgrade fee, and just took it upon themselves to upgrade. Maybe they saw my car, my branded luggage or amex card, but thats just not acceptable.  I would be willing to update my review if they take responsibility for this and correct this charge in a timely manner.    They also have two birds in one cage with limited food and the same rotting piece of lettuce on the bottom of the cage from the day we checked in to the day we checked out.  They had maybe two things for the birds to play with.  someone should look into this."}
{"text":"Beautiful place - large campus - pricey - but it is a Biltmore"}
{"text":"What brings me to the Biltmore once a year is the \"Hell City\" tattoo expo. So if your visiting on that particular weekend, be prepared for some low brow meets high brow juxtapositions. I chuckle a little at the sight of the yuppie golfers and high maintenance housewives being outnumbered by the extreme body modification crowd. Like Jorge Casulties' mohawk, the grounds are immaculately maintained, and taking in the architecture is an experience in itself. I had fun discovering the plethora of fruit trees around campus. Unfortunately, the oranges were inedible, but look around and you'll find kumquats, limes, and pomegranate. But you probably aren't going to the Biltmore for it's foraging opportunities. The restaurant also has delicious offerings, but you will pay an average of $35 for an entree. All of the staff from landscapers to servers to desk reception do a great job of appearing happy and friendly, and that helps us to feel that all is right in the world during our stay. The rooms are spacious and clean, but the fixtures might show minor signs of their age. The fridge is stocked with goods priced four times over their market value. Throw them in a drawer, and use the refrigerator for the drinks and snacks you thought to buy ahead on your way in.  What I don't like about staying here is that the campus is so secluded from town. It is a 2 mile walk to outside restaurants and stores. But if you aren't wearing bottom beaded moccasins, stroll south to East Camelback road, and you will find a variety of eateries to suit anyone's taste. On the east side of the campus, there is a pedestrian / bike trail that takes you halfway there. I personally enjoyed Revo Burrito and True Food's fresh juices and their gluten free conscious menu. Neither place delivered, but they should consider doing so.  Also, you may want to know that you can navigate a bus ride from the airport for $6 or less. A cab will cost $40 - $60. Consult www.valleymetro.org to plan your route, and be prepared to walk about a mile from the stop to the reception desk. Once there, you can rent a bike at the Biltmore, but it will cost $15 per hour or $50 per day.  One of my colleagues inquired how much a massage at the spa would be. Upon hearing the price, he replied, \"Thank you, I'll massage myself!\" We laughed.  As you may have suspected, my normal state of being is in jeans, T shirt and a pony tail. I bought a colorful maxidress and had my hair done did, and It felt right for my weekend stay at the Biltmore. I didn't look like the glamour models on the website, but, heck, not too many people do. If you are there for the tattoo expo, say hi to the crazy lady picking the kumquats in the morning (that's me)!  Lastly, the pillows get 5 stars. I wanted to steal one, but I didn't... because I have class."}
{"text":"The Biltmore is certainly an Arizona icon and for good reason - absolutely stunning architecture for this lovely 1929 resort!  We stayed with our dog in one of the cottages and really enjoyed the experience - comfortable bed, nice windows to the lawn, spacious bathroom and access to the amazing club lounge.  This conveniently located resort is a nice respite from the bustling city and offers all of the conveniences you can imagine."}
{"text":"Hello, AZ Biltmore! When I heard my husband's cousin was having her wedding reception here, I was thrilled!  It's a beautiful resort! I love the architecture from Frank Lloyd Wright. The multiple fire pits make for a cozy and enjoyable visit with friends.   The ballroom was perfect! Nice sized dance floor, the wedding party was set up on a stage so everyone could have a view of the bride and groom. The dining service was excellent.   The Biltmore has it down and executes catering to parties seamless and smooth. The staff is very friendly, helpful, and respectful. I felt like a VIP the entire night."}
{"text":"What a beautiful and relaxing hotel! We were here Thursday to Sunday. I immediately felt like I was on vacation as I walked through to get to our room.   Staff was very friendly and detailed. We were out by the pool often and I saw them go around wiping the tables down as well as scrubbing the lounge chair.   The rooms were nice and spacious. Beware of scorpions! We heard several people got hit with it being on their bed, under their pillow, and in their shoes! The shower pressure was good and I was able to get my hot showers unlike some other hotels we have been to.   The gym was open 24 hours which was great. It was a bit cluttered in there but there is more than enough equipment so you can get a proper workout in.  We only had the chance to eat at the Cabana Club and enjoyed it the two times we were there. Decent food.  Overall, we really enjoyed our stay here. We oils be back!"}
{"text":"My Fiancé and I stayed here for our staycation and we had a great time! The rooms have been remodeled and the shuttles were very helpful in getting us around to eat and drinks. We had a great time around the pool!"}
{"text":"I stayed here for a recent business conference during September. The resort was definitely a nice experience. Upon check in I had a room in the Ocatilla. The room was well appointed, spacious and clean - clearly a recent renovation that was well done.   Due to some mobility issues, I asked to be moved to a room closer to the location of the majority of my events I had to attend and I was quickly transferred to  a private cottage near the Frank Lloyd Wright ballroom. The cottage was not nearly as nice as the room in the Ocatilla. The cottage was dated and even smelled that way. However, it was clean, quiet and definitely closer to where I needed to be.   The room was okay for working. There was a small desk with wired internet access. However, in order to plug in my computer I had to drop down on my hands and knees and find the outlet. Outlets were also available next to one of the nighstands which is great since I use my phone as my alarm clock.  The staff was quite kind and would pick me up on a golf cart and transfer me around the property as needed (I understand that this service is always available and you need only call the front desk to request it).  Front desk staff, concierge and bell hops were all professional, eager and willing to assist, and happy to answer questions.  The restaurants, Frank & Albert's, was exceptional - both in quality of food and service. I dined there for lunch one day and breakfast on another. Both times I was very pleased with the taste of the food (excellent mid-western menu) and the friendliness and professionalism of the servers. Never once did we have to ask for anything and on both occasions the server thought ahead to prepare to go drinks for once we moved outside of the restaurant and onto the patio.  The grounds of the hotel are fantastic. There are tons of chair/tables for you to sit at and chat with colleagues/friends and the atmosphere is warm and inviting. The bar was as impressive as the restaurant. The meeting facilities are also nice though spread out a bit.  I definitely recommend the Arizona Biltmore and would happily stay there again."}
{"text":"I'm so so so bummed to be giving this resort 2 stars...really, I am but if I'm not an honest reviewer, what's the point?    Arrived at 4 PM and had booked a \"resort king\" and having stayed her many times over the past 20 years I knew precisely what that was...well...4 PM and my room isn't ready.  What?  We awoke at the crack of dawn to see the sunrise over the Grand Canyon and had driven a long way...making stops to ensure that we arrived at a time when we could check in, get a drink and lounge by the pool.  But this was not to be...(read many many reviews and you'll see the same.)  The very nice Jon helped us at the desk -- and acted as if we were getting some \"upgraded\" room and gave us keys to go look...at rooms that were ready.  Ugh.  Spent LITERALLY an hour going back and forth across a huge property looking at rooms that were NOT RESORT KING rooms.    We ended up, after an hour, taking a first floor (yuck) dark room w 2 queens in the Valley wing.  Whatever.  I wanted to be in the resort rooms back by the Catalina pool...but guess what?  They were under renovation! As WAS HALF OF THE MAIN POOL!  So there were literally less than 1/3 of the main pool and chairs available!  This is not listed anywhere on the site, so we did NOT know this when booking -- which is totally unacceptable and disappointing. See the photos with the yellow tape closing off the pool, and all the sun.  Ugh.  Dumb.    Bartender at the pool looked miserable -- although the server was very nice, friendly.    Bar in lobby has been re-done and was nice, but really miss the piano player-- that MADE the Biltmore and oozed class.  Now its a place for BIG conferences and that's who they care about--   The restaurant was closed for a wine pairing event the night we arrived, great, for $120 per person we could've gone.  Uh, no thanks.  So the other option was the casual restaurant, nah.  We ordered pizza!  The concierge staff was very nice and helpful to me but my daughter saw them being dismissive to others.  Sad to hear.  Yes, I gave them my feedback -- and they sent a bottle of champagne and some chocolates to us at 2 PM (!) on our last day.  Sort of strange, but we appreciated the effort.  Hope they get it together, but not sure I'll spend the 1k next time to see...."}
{"text":"I have always wanted to stay here but we often opt for the younger Phoenician in Scottsdale. My room was in the newer Paradise villa and was large and bright.      Pool is amazing! Food and Beverage options are great but not cheap. I was not charged for parking as some have said, there is a $13 room fee, but Internet was free and without complication. The staff were awesome, the meeting facilities were good though the food and service was not to the caliber of the hotel. Maybe it was my group but the hotel was a 5 and the meeting food and service was a 3 at best.    The Spa was nice and service was good, but for the price the are asking it's just not worth the services. Skip the massage, use the gym for free and there will be no disappointments."}
{"text":"The Biltmore is a great hotel. The grounds and staff are definitely 5 stars, however the rooms are more on the level of 3.5 or 4 stars.  We stayed in the Valley building with a great view of one of the pools. The room was quiet but the beds were not as comfortable as I expected. Being a Waldorf Astoria resort and part of the Hilton family, I expected a bed as comfy as one finds in a Hilton. My bed was definitely not that soft. The room size was larger than average and the tv was new. The bathroom showed signs of age, peeling paint on ceiling and scuffs on the door. While rather minor complaints, I expected better from a 5 star resort.  The main pool was great and never got too crowded. The staff, including front desk, lobby bar, pool bar, and coffee shop were all very friendly and accommodating.  I would definitely return here but hope management will make some changes to the rooms."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed staying at this hotel. The grounds were gorgeous and well-kept. The architecture is beautiful. This is definitely one of the better hotels I have stayed at in Arizona. The rooms were beautiful and the beds were comfortable. I will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Well, you could have knocked me over with a paper towel, triple-ply, when I discovered this luxurious, circa 1929 hotel is not a Frank Lloyd Wright-designed masterpiece. The architect of record is Albert Chase McArthur, who was once one of Wright's draftsmen and obviously he was heavily influenced by his employer and mentor. In fact, Wright consulted McArthur for a few months in the textile block construction which is one of the hotel's architectural trademarks. But let's get real. As talented as McArthur was, the owners knew Wright was the one with the marquee name and have played up the connection big time ever since its construction.  To reinforce the same misconception I had, they added a signature Wright-designed stained glass in the lobby (photo: http://bit.ly/2wOrfC5) and the familiar Japanese-influenced stone sprites from Wright's Midway Gardens project in Chicago (photo: http://bit.ly/2fpJ7AJ), as well as naming the three onsite restaurants after Wright, including one that celebrates the actual architect, Frank & Albert's - even though poor McArthur gets second billing (photo: http://bit.ly/2horLVx). Driving here at night from Camelback, I couldn't tell how close I was getting to the hotel until I saw a small sign at a creek crossing (photo: http://bit.ly/2xBj9kg).  The entrance was designed in the familiar prairie style accented by intricately designed blocks (photo: http://bit.ly/2ylbQu6). The low ceiling of the expansive lobby is covered completely in gold leaf, and the lamps, rugs and couches are all typically Wright in their angular and orb-focused design (photo: http://bit.ly/2xoc6Mi). Strolling outside to the back terrace, I saw more sprites and sat on a Morris chair that served nicely as a lounge seat. The hotel has changed hands a number of times and is now part of the high-end Waldorf-Astoria collection. Hell, I didn't stay here but rates start at $265 per night for a standard guest room to around $800 for a villa. Well worth a stop and a stroll even if you're not a guest."}
{"text":"I stayed here in late January for a business meeting. The resort is beautiful and the grounds are gorgeous. The resort has been around for years however they have done a great job of keeping things up to date. I used the Hilton Honors app to unlock my room which was cool."}
{"text":"Dear Arizona Biltmore Resort and Spa,  Thank you for letting me swim quietly and nudely in your pool after midnight on any number of occasions.   Yours, most sincerely,   A bunch of hot, drunk, bored Phoenicians"}
{"text":"OMG -- if you are a Frank Lloyd Wright fan.  Every detail of this hotel showcases his great work, and to me this is a grander example than even Taliesin West to see in fine detail a grand design.  I did not sample the food but just being there was a feast for the eyes."}
{"text":"Stayed here for the 2nd time in recent years and took advantage of the summer special that was offered to us that include the room and vouchers for 3 meals per day! We had 2 rooms, one of the rooms was located in the Paradise section and was updated and nicely appointed. Not sure why they stuck us (the parents) in the older section of the hotel. The A/C was very loud and the tub did not drain properly, we called the front desk and they got someone to fix the drainage issue, but the bathtub faucet dripped the entire time we stayed there. The bed was very comfortable and the amenities of the hotel were very nice. Also, apart from the rather grouchy and unwielding check in clerk, all the staff couldn't be nicer and more professional. A shout out to the manager on duty David, who straightened out some issues for us and also Aaron at the Cabana Club pool bar--who couldn't be nicer and more accomodating..did I mention I was traveling with 4 teenage boys????? The grounds for this hotel are great and this time I did use the spa and treated myself and my man to a couples massage. The spa and the adjoining workout area were nicely appointed and well staff. I would definitely come back. The summer special was a great value and the weather this weekend cooperated and was beautiful!"}
{"text":"I'm staying in the Ocatilla wing on business for 5 nights and this is my first experience here.  When I got to my second floor room, because I was wearing dress shoes I didn't immediately realize that the carpet in my room had just been shampooed.  The good news (I guess) is that my carpet is clean.  The bad news is that I can't walk in my room without getting my shoes, socks or feet wet.  I finally realized that my shoes were wet when I took a serious slip on the polished bathroom floor tile - wow!  I took off my shoes thinking that the soles were just too smooth for the tile, but then my socks got immediately soaked!  That's when I figured out my carpet was just shampooed.  I called down to the desk and she offered to connect me with housekeeping \"to see if there is anything they can do.\"  Here's what I expected from the front desk: can we relocate you to a room with dry carpet? I had higher customer service expectations from the front desk at the Biltmore.  I grabbed dinner and a couple of beers at the lounge and it was okay - nothing special with pretty good service.  The mosquitoes were eating me alive, and I saw several people move inside as a result.  That's really not the Biltmore's fault, though.  Nothing they can do about that, I think.  So far, high expectations but just, meh...   I'll update as my stay progresses.  Update: At about 7:10pm somebody attempted to enter my room using a keycard.  Luckily I had the security clasp in place to prevent the door from being opened.  My guess is that the front desk clerk mistakenly checked-in another guest to my room.  Am I in a Motel 6, jeez...?"}
{"text":"Such a beautiful venue but such poor uncaring service.  My elderly mom got food poisoning at Frank Albert and the most care we got was the operator .. They could use help"}
{"text":"Lovely place. Nice room. Just don't come expecting to eat anything. Limited dining options. Main restaurant booked; casual- dining menu doesn't appeal; and room service doesn't pick up the phone.   Perhaps this is a weight- loss clinic in disguise?"}
{"text":"What a shame. As my high school counselor once told me, \"so much potential, but....\"  ;)  The Frank Lloyd Wright design is just beautiful. But in the same way you just don't need to sleep in a Ferrari, you don't need to stay here either. Come visit for lunch or dinner and check out the beautiful property, because the Frank & Albert's restaurant is great, and now that i mention it, the BREAKFAST there was fantastic. The kindest, smartest, nicest wait staff in the morning, and the food is just so creative and different, yet so tasty. But i digress.  The problem is that it's an old building. And with old buildings, come problems, even though it's been remodeled. The walls are thin, so you can hear your neighbors getting into arguments or getting it on with perfect clarity, neither one of which you really want to hear while on vacation. And you can hear the drunk people walking and yelling down the halls at 2am, 3am, and even 4am. I'm not making any of this up as I lived through it, all in 1 night. And the a/c units are loud, because again, it's an old building and that's just the way it is.  The rooms are a good size, around 500 square feet, and well designed and furnished. Which makes it even more of a shame that you can't really enjoy it.  And if you're thinking about staying at the Ocatilla building, that's where I stayed. So you can't escape the riff raff by staying there either.  As another guest correctly points out, the Ocatilla side is not worth the extra dollars. That definitely over promises and under delivers. The pool is not exclusive to Ocatilla guests, as no one monitors the area, so you have people who pool hop who shouldn't be there. You can't find a server to save your life to get a drink at the pool either, so you have to walk out to get your own.   The Ocatilla concierge folks are extremely nice as can be, but their niceness doesn't walk the hallways and pick up trash or room service trays that sit out in the hallways all day long without being picked up. The \"free\" breakfast is simply bagels, muffins, fruit, juice and coffee. Puts the con in continental breakfast, if you ask me.  And one of the strangest parts is that if you drive yourself there (I rented a car from the airport), the parking is like Star Wars and is far far away. Even valet doesn't help because the Ocatilla building is in the back of the property with no parking near it, which doesn't seem like a big deal except when it's 108 degrees outside. AND they charge $12 extra for even self parking. That's bad, especially when the parking is so inconvenient.  And the $28 resort fee on top of paying extra for the Ocatilla rooms? While having \"free\" wifi by the pool was nice, i don't know what the other $18 difference is for since you still have to tip people and tip the maid. I've stayed at other resorts with \"resort fees\" that include tips for everyone, so i get it and like it since i don't have to carry cash for deliveries and doormen and concierge, but i think the Biltmore doesn't quite realize that resort fees weren't designed to get more money from guests: it was originally intended to make our lives easier so that we don't have to worry about tipping and carrying money!  So i'll stop being a downer. The staff was extremely friendly, the rooms were well designed and super clean, and the property is beautiful. I stayed for 6 nights and ate at Frank & Alberts 5 times (1x dinner, 2x breakfast, 2x lunch). 4 out of 5 of the meals were fantastic, so that's a pretty great batting average for any restaurant. As mentioned in the beginning, go there to eat, hang out, get a drink, and enjoy the beautiful property. Heck, even stay there in a non-Ocatilla room for a few nights, but make sure your room is far far away from the elevator."}
{"text":"I'm doing an event here in July so I came here last week for a site visit. SUCH a beautiful property! I can't wait to be onsite for a week and really getting to experience the service level more. The views could not be better! Definitely a great stay!"}
{"text":"What a gem!  Service, Grounds and Banquets all top notch.  I have been on property about a dozen times with one overnighter under my belt an I have always found everything as close to perfect as it gets for such a large hotel  At every turn, every visit The Biltmore is amazing.   My last event was a 1 n 10 Event and our table of 10 had a wonderful time. it's nice to revisit this Grand Dame!"}
{"text":"Been here twice and not sure if i'll return.  The first time I came here was for a massage.  The second for a facial.  The massage was ok, however, the facial was not.  The facilities were decent with a good fitness center but I noticed on my second trip that the jacuzzi was so filthy that the foam was brown and the scum on the side walls looked like it hadn't been cleaned in awhile.  Overall, it was not as a relaxing experience as expected.    The general lounge/waiting area was co-ed and a little cramped. While i can appreciate couples wanting to spend time together it is a little uneasy to be sitting 3 to a couch half naked with wet hair and red-faced in an oversized robe.   But the real disappointments were the relatively inexperienced facialist and the scars left on my face. It was going ok until she tried extracting the same places several times with each time more painful than the last.  Even after 50 minutes my face was still bleeding.   I haven't had a spa facial since then."}
{"text":"Not Impressed....  The staff was really nice... The lobby smelled and looked amazing... We stayed in the main building, maybe because it was the oldest part of resort, but I was not impressed. Towels run down..... nothing special in the rooms...... not impressed at all.... This was a business trip as my husband works for the Federal Government and were here on Government rate.... I think it is quite sad if the Biltmore puts Government Employees in the not so nice parts of the hotel because of their Government Rate Fare.... Not impressed... Embassy Suites next time... they have much more to offer for those who serve this country....."}
{"text":"Nice property. Not well kept. When checked in I had to switch rooms. Bathroom in the first room was filthy. Towels were dirty. Toilet filthy. Shower sink dirty. Moved to the second room. Hair everywhere on the bathroom. Toilet lid had a big yellow stain."}
{"text":"Nice place to spend for Giants Spring Training weekend getaway!  Room by the main pool was a dream becoming reality within few steps from pool and all resort happenings!  Only drawback. ... the high price ($360 + 28 resort fees)."}
{"text":"I've stayed at the Biltmore twice, once was a five star experience, and the other was about a three, so I'll split the difference and give them a four.   The first time I stayed here was in a super cute cottage. We had fabulous service from everyone. The only complaint I had with this trip was that housekeeping knocked at 9 AM (which they did on my second trip too). I realize nine is not ungodly, but it's a little early to be hustled out of your room so someone can make your bed, that you would have never left if you didn't have to stop the persistent knocking from the other side of the door. So that sucked. But besides that it was a great experience.  This last time was okay. We got a great deal on the room and they let us check in super early, which was awesome. The air wasn't working when we first got to the room, but I'll let them off the hook for that because they quickly fixed it and the room was cool before the 4:00 check-in time, so for all I know that was their plan the whole time. My boyfriend spent the morning golfing and even though it was miserably hot,  had a great time. The bartenders at the pool were nice enough, and we were pretty obnoxious, so nice enough is pretty much all we could hope for.  One of the sinks in the bathroom didn't drain and the cosmetic mirror in the bathroom was broken (not the mirror the little thing that kept it stable in the wall), so that was a minor inconvenience that I wouldn't normally expect from resorts of this caliber.  We also got a couple in room massages, which were great, but then due to a misunderstanding with the credit cards on file (I used mine for the room, my boyfriend used his for the massages), I got charged for both the room AND the massages. And, god bless my boyfriend, but I really can't rationalize spending $400 on a couple 55 minute backrubs unless that back rub comes with, say, an iPod. I called Biltmore and they said they could reverse the charges and put them on another card, but it might be easier to just ask him for the cash. So he paid me back but I obviously wish I could have avoided it all together. I mean, that's awkward right? To have someone do a nice gesture for you and then you end up accidentally paying for the nice gesture so you have to awkwardly bring up that while the gesture was nice, you kind of can't pay for it and omg I already feel like I'm on an episode of Curb Your Enthusiasm so I'll just stop right there and hope you get the point. It was very stressful for me.  Assuming you don't share my social etiquette neurosis, I'm sure you'll have a great  time at the Biltmore. The summer rates are unbeatable, and if you can stay at a Cottage do so because they are just adorable, especially by the little putt putt holes. Just make sure to double check your room upon check in and double check your folio upon check out and you'll be fine."}
{"text":"**There are two different listings for this property.  Also search Arizona Biltmore Resort and Spa to see the other listings.  The first time I stayed here was 6 years ago and I had a great visit so when I found myself back in Phoenix I knew exactly where I would stay.  I am sad to say that my experience this time was horrible.    I got to the hotel around 8;30 pm and still had to eat and had work to do.  I got to my room and I started sweating.  It was 100 degrees outside and even hotter in the room.  I called down to the front desk and got the response that there are dials on the air conditioning I can turn it up.  When I asked to speak to the manager he said there wasn't a manager there.  His solution was to have me follow a bell man from room to room until I found one that would work for me.  I immediately hung up the phone and went to the front desk.  At the front desk I talked to a woman who got the manager right away.  I explained the situation and told him that I was going to dinner and that when I returned I expected my luggage in a room that was at a habitable temperature.   My room was changed and the air conditioner did work in the new room but my experience left a bad taste in my mouth.  I understand that the guy I talked to was very young (it was the same guy that checked me in) but there are major training issues here.   The second issue that I faced was that I was charged $26.80 after I checked out for the mini bar.  I never touched the mini bar!  (I did have free Waldorf Astoria branded water coupons of which I did take and I did leave the coupon for). Are you kidding me? It was a good thing I went online and checked the bill they posted which is something that I never do but this hotel was just off. I got the same manager that helped me with my room issue.  He said he would reverse the charges. No apology.   The third thing that happened is I accidentally left the do not disturb sign on the door so I had to call housekeeping to have my room made up. I was in the room while the housekeepers were there.  I was working on my computer and making phone calls since and no one came on the first phone call I made to housekeeping.  The second call an hour and a half later after I returned from lunch is what brought someone to my room.  I asked for an extra bag of coffee which they gave me. I also asked for extra lotion since my skin was not used to the hot dry Arizona weather.  They went to the cart and said they didn't have anymore.  Sorry.  I literary looked at them like they were at another planet.  They went to walk away and I said, \"You don't have any in the entire hotel?\" To which one of the ladies replied we'll have to go get it and stared at me.  OK was my response.  When she returned she handed over one little bottle of lotion to which I thanked her.  I was very surprised with my experience here.  I would have gotten better service at any of the other Hilton Brands.  This is not the way the Hilton runs hotels and I sincerely hope they can turn this hotel around.  The Waldorf Astoria properties are among my favorite and to see this happen is horrible. The Arizona Biltmore used to be such a great place.  The grounds are beautiful, the restaurants on the property had good food and I feel in love with the Salvatore Ferragamo Tuscan Soul scent of products they use.  It's just a shame."}
{"text":"My review is based solely on the hotel room, service, and pools.  I did not get a spa treatment.  Keep in mind that this is rated a 5-star hotel, people!  Lobby - smelled super super musty....but it is a historic hotel.  Architecturally beautiful!!  The rooms - just ok, average...no better than a 3 star hotel.  In fact, the bathroom had some chipped tiles.  No in room coffee machine!!  So, we skipped room service coffee because it was so expensive!  The pools - salt water heaven!  Yay, no chlorine!  We loved the Marilyn pool...soo pretty!  The service - just ok...pool side service was horrible!!  Every stinkin' time, I had to physically walk up to the bar area and order!!  Geez...definately NOT 5-star.  But I do miss my Biltmore Cobb salad - yum!  So, for me, it was definitely not 5-star quality....didn't even get free bottled water upon arrival and it was a freakin' 115 degrees!  (got free water at the Hilton Flagstaff). Hey...isn't Waldorf and Hilton the same chain???  YES!"}
{"text":"Absolutely stunning architecture and design. We stopped by on our way out of town just to see the pool. Well worth it and I can't wait to come back to golf"}
{"text":"This hotel was absolutely incredible. The rooms, the service, and the food and drink were all top notch.   The rooms were huge and the beds were comfortable. Housekeeping does a turn-down service multiple times a day so it always looks like you're just checking in every time you enter the room.  If you forget anything (or just want some new clothing) there are stores on the grounds where you can find everything from a toothbrush to an entirely new outfit.   Waking up with the sunrise over the mountains every morning make this hotel worth the costs of staying there."}
{"text":"Nice, not as high end as I'd expect a Waldorf Astoria brand to be, but nice. The terrace court suites are newer. Separate shower and tub and toilet. A makeup area, long mirrors on the closet which is nice as its inside the bathroom. Bar area, office desk, 60in LG TV built into the wall and Bose clock radio for iPhone input. Beds were super comfy as were the pillows. Nice balcony with two chairs and a table and room for more. Very spacious. Four could stay comfortably in a double queen room easily. Bathroom is huge as is the room and the balcony. Various places to eat and the food is good all around. Some shopping and several pools! A tennis and basketball court. A really nice big gym with everything you can imagine. Valet or self parking are good.  Golf course looks just ok. Houses in the community are super posh."}
{"text":"Short Version: Dude, this place rocks.  Long Version: This is, by far, the most amazing resort I've ever visited. The grounds, the service, the food, the accommodations, everything is top of the line. And I think the attribute that should be mentioned above all else is the architecture. The facilities are gorgeous and inspiring, which is not something you can say often about architecture. It is second-to-none. In a way, it's almost pointless to go into depth describing this place because it is simply the best. I want to go on, but you can read all the other reviews. If you're in town and you have the means to stay there, do it. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"We Came here for a 3 night work event that included about 700 people. The grounds are very cool to walk and explore.  The hotel lobby and patio bars were entertaining.  The events at the hotel were first class. We were booked in a garden room.  The room is terrible!!! The a/c doesn't work. It is only 81 deg here now, there is no way they could rent this room in the summer. The place is old and not clean.  A few other couples complained as soon as the got to their garden rooms and were relocated to much newer and more well appointed rooms.  We didn't ask to be moved we just sucked it up and stayed in this s#%* hole for three days!  If we would of been booked into a new room this review would be ***.  But we didn't, so The Arizona Biltmore gets 2 stars.  If you do come be sure to book a new room that actually has a/c."}
{"text":"The Arizona Biltmore is outstanding.  Frank Lloyd Wright designed!  Beautiful views! Pools are awesome!  Beds are comfortable.  It was a hot place to stay for July, but it worked!  The only negative - scorpions in the room, not once, but twice.  However, I am still giving this place 4 stars because it's awesome!"}
{"text":"Local taking a 4th of July trip here. The grounds are absolutely stunning. The landscape is well kept and this is a one of a kind property. Its a massive aztec oasis nestled in the Biltmore district of Phoenix. The rooms are extremely clean and big (500 sq ft)."}
{"text":"We have stayed at the Biltmore for several years. Prior to this last visit, we were there in February 2015. We stayed for five nights over Easter weekend. Things have definitely changed, and not for the better. If you try to follow up on requests (like dishes for your condo or a rollaway bed, the phones rings off the hook........no matter who you call).  The waiters/waitress, at the restaurant, are rude, and they are often seen huddling together talking rather than serving guests. Service at the lobby bar was slow. Poolside service took forever and some orders were missed. Dirty dishes were often outside our condo for a day or two. Whatever is going on with the hotel's management is not good. There is no welcoming attitude by the employess. In fact, they seem resigned to having to work there. I would not recommend staying at this resort until new policies re service have been put in place."}
{"text":"Went for a convention and had dinner in the restaurant. So this is my limited review!  Did a lot of walking to get from place to place.  Convention facilities were above average.  Food in the restaurant was excellent.  Service left much to be desired, seemed we were in the way and a bother!  I love the Biltmore grounds and landscaping was soothing and enjoyed walking the areas!"}
{"text":"Lame customer service experience.  When checking out from a mandatory work conference, I asked for a copy of my receipt at checkout (needed for expense report).  I was informed that it wasn't possible to print at the time of checkout but I was assured that it would be emailed to me that day. It wasn't.  I called the next week and was navigated into a voicemail box for accounting. I clearly gave my phone and email info in the voicemail and awaited a mandatory form that this property requires (they can't just provide a receipt? ok...)  No response back via phone or email.... I've not wasted a ridiculous amount of time trying to get a receipt that should have been provided at checkout.   I left a second voicemail one week later with the same result. Nothing.  Finally, I called again and pressed \"1\" to book a room (I figured this would actually get me to a live person. It did.) I explained the situation and was finally able to get a copy of the bill.   Overall, it's a pretty nice place, but too spread out over an enormous estate for my taste. Anytime I need a map to get from the front desk to the building where my room is.... it's a bit much.   With the hassle of trying to get a copy of a receipt where an authorization form is required (probably handy if you're up to something shady, but annoying since I was not), I'll recommend to our events team that we checkout a Marriott property on the next national meeting."}
{"text":"My girlfriends and I had a staycation this weekend at The Biltmore. I have never stayed at the Biltmore and had a nice experience. When we checked in the front desk offered us two options: an older room in the main building or a newly updated room with a patio. Ummm....the newly decorated room, please. The room was beautiful and the beds were awesome. I am very picky when it comes to beds in hotels and they were extremely comfortable. We drank and ate poolside at the Ocotillo pool. BILTMORE MANAGEMENT, you must know that Eric, the bartender, made our visit!! He was so sweet and attentive to our needs and others at the pool. He was suppose to be off at 4pm, but stayed longer to continue servicing the busy pool. He was still there at 5pm when we left the pool, but he didn't seem to mind staying late. Smile on his face and sincerity in his voice he continued to service the pool guests. This is how all of your employees should be. We returned to our room later in the evening to find a bottle of prosecco and a card from Eric thanking us for visiting the pool! It made our day knowing that he enjoyed our company as much as we enjoyed his! He went above and beyond to make us feel special. Thank you Eric!"}
{"text":"Has a grand entrance and lobby, some excellent service by bell men and concierge and cleaning crews. Also, the gym is rather good. But the rooms themselves are rather pedestrian, with chips in the sink, dirty plates and silverware in kitchen, 1980ish televisions with no DVD players, no chest of drawers at all to put clothes in, and an overall outdated feel. I hear the place is undergoing renovation. Well, it would be nice if the yet-to-be renovated rooms went for a lower rate. Unfortunately, they did not. What a shame."}
{"text":"This is High Tea as it should be: delicious and unusual teas presented by a well-versed, knowledgeable and very personable tea sommelier, Kevin Michael Doyle and the equally pleasant and attentive Julie. Add in delicacies that taste like angels were in the kitchen preparing them and the 1929 ambiance of the Biltmore and you enjoy a relaxing and entertaining experience befitting royalty. I could go on, believe me, but Rachel C.'s Yelp review dated 4/7/2013 expresses my feelings so accurately, it is not necessary for me to be redundant. Thank you for helping to make my beloved uncle's 80th birthday a special day indeed."}
{"text":"Our annual December getaway !  Staff are friendly !  Food is excellent !  Nostalgia at its finest !  Oh the white robe does it for my wife, me, I just play golf"}
{"text":"Stayed here while attending a conference that was also held here. The resort is very nice, but the first day or two I was very confused on where to go, because it is so spread out and all of the \"wings\" look the same.   Once I got my bearings, though, the resort seemed to \"shrink,\" and it was easy to find my way around.  The conference center and ballrooms are great, with a ton of space for many different needs. The catered food was just okay, with some things being better than others. The logistics/people moving aspects could be better, especially when there are a thousand attendees all trying to get lunch at the same time.   My room was VERY comfortable, and the bathroom was also nice. The fitness facility is really quite large--larger than I was expecting, and all of the equipment was relatively new. I thought the a/c could have been set a couple degrees cooler, though.  The pool is quite large, and there were plenty of lounge chairs. I'm sure the pool must get quite full in the summer months, but even bring October, the weather was definitely warm enough to enjoy being out there, and it wasn't crowded with too many people.  Every employee I ran into was so cordial, friendly, and helpful, and that speaks volumes."}
{"text":"This hotel was once amazing but that was in the 90s and it hadn't been renovated since. :( The prices are high for an upper end hotel in this area and what you get for your money may be the least impressive of anything on its level.  I checked in and requested a room close to the main building and was given what was unquestionably one of the farthest rooms. I called and was then moved to a closer room but I was brought there via many service entrances and nasty back end corridors clearly for staff only.  The room was acceptable but not on par with the price point and level of this hotel. Guests I spoke with however made me think my room with dirty Starbucks cups on the balcony was one of the higher end rooms bc I was told of peeling wallpaper and insect infestation in other rooms.  Basically this hotel earned it's reputation a few decades ago and is still thriving off it bc what it is currently is hardly what one would equate with Waldorf Astoria name."}
{"text":"I love this place. my favorite is the Baltimore Suite or the Villa which is about $550-$1,600 per night depending on season.  Very professional and very clean. I always stay here for business and baseball tournaments. There are several pools and great food. The cost is well worth the service and clean rooms and comfortable beds. If you like being pampered, clean rooms and clean bathrooms with marble and granite, then this is the place for you. Money is well spent here."}
{"text":"Great service, comfortable rooms and public spaces, and beautiful grounds make this hotel worth a visit.  The restaurants and bars on the property make it easy to stay right here, but the central location makes it easy to explore the city.  I can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Don't let the \"Waldorf Astoria\" and \"Biltmore\" fool you.  This is a tired Hilton.  The Frank Lloyd Wright architecture is amazing and the grounds fantastic, but the hotel itself is pretty dated and nothing special.  Bed was so uncomfortable (like a taco sagging in the middle), the room and furniture dinged around the edges, windows from 1975 that couldn't block the sound of a gardener trimming bushes at 7 am...."}
{"text":"\"The Arizona Biltmore Resort & Spa is nestled on 39 acres at the foot of the Phoenix Mountain Preserve. Considered one of the most spectacular resorts in the world, the Biltmore features 738 guest accommodations, including 78 one- and two-bedroom villas, eight swimming pools, seven tennis courts, an 18-hole putting course, and a full-service European spa, salon, and fitness center. \"  All of the above is true, but it doesn't capture the essence of this historically interesting and aethetically pleasing resort.  Frank Lloyd Wright designed the resort as an oasis.  He succeeded.  As you stroll through the lobby and hallways, pictures showing presidents and hollywood royalty grace the walls.  Anyone who is anyone has stayed here, and if these walls could talk, I'm sure they would have many stories to tell. The rooms at the Biltmore are ridiculously large and sumptuous.  If you have the opportunity to stay, press for a room in one of more historical buildings.  The large outdoor patios are totally worth it.  Or, if you are traveling with a larger group, go for one of the amazing condos.  With a full kitchen, gorgeous furniture and separate living room and bedroom, you won't feel cramped. The spa at the Biltmore is a bit small, but this in no way takes away from the wonderful spa experience.  The whirlpool in the ladies locker room is continuously cleaned and fresh towels are laid out by thoughtful attendents.  Cucumber water and fresh fruit await your fingertips before you try out the steamroom.  The services are wonderful as well.  Try the lavender massage if you want a deeply relaxing experience.  The pampering here is doesn't stop: there is always someone anticipating your every need.  A total must in Arizona!"}
{"text":"What a beautiful hotel.  The Frank Lloyd Wright-inspired architecture was the first thing that struck me about this historic landmark.  The place was apparently designed by Wright's protege, with his consultation and guidance.  Every US President has stayed here since it's construction along with the elite of Old Hollywood.  The bartender told me that Marilyn Monroe would stay here for three months at a time.    As for the hotel itself, the rooms are very spacious with balconies, the grounds are immaculate, and the pool(s) are incredible.  This place has a waterslide!  Not to mention two golf courses, a put-put course, tennis courts, a full gym, spa, and fire pits outside the bar which are always crowded with people gathered around drinking, smoking cigars and the like.  My one gripe about this place is that it is difficult to get ice!  You'd think this would be very simple but the ice machines were nearly always locked in housekeeping closets.  Instead you either have to call room service for ice or trek all the way down to the bar and ask for a bucket.  Slightly annoying, but overall, what a place!  PS--the bars are quite expensive, but you can find $5 wines and beers at the Frank & Albert's bar during their happy hour from 5-7, and the food was delicious."}
{"text":"This review is based on a one night business stay.  The Biltmore is 15 minutes from PHX airport.  The resort is huge and sprawling with beautiful landscaping, lots of greenery and sculptures.  It sort of stops there, since it's an older property the rooms are dated and in need of some renovation. This can be noticed from the furniture to the bathroom fixtures. There is no coffee maker in the rooms. The conference rooms are large and spacious which is great for events. The breakfast and lunch catered by the hotel was good.  Also be prepared to do a lot of walking if you get a room in one of the back buildings. This hotel may have been a five star property back in the day but not so much now in my non-humble opinion."}
{"text":"I fell for another cheap trick, \"$50 Spa Week.\"  This is a promo that allows people to take the opportunity to visit participating \"top spas\" in and around their neigborhoods for $50 selected treatments.    I chose to visit the AZ Biltmore Spa for an aromatherapy facial and even after I read some negative reviews on Yelp about it, I went anyway.  I figured that I'd make my own consumer decision.    Once I got passed the road sign that indicated where to go, there were no more signage so I was left clueless. THIS PLACE IS HARD TO FIND. I parked my car and headed in the wrong direction.  After walking for a few minutes, a young man who worked there asked me if I was lost and then told me I needed to head back in the other direction.  However, he was nice enough to let me ride back with him on his golf cart.  It's a good thing that I came early.  Let me just say that, if this guy did not find me in time, I wouldn't have found this place.  IT WAS LOCATED BEHIND THE TENNIS COURT WITH NO SIGNS SAYING SO.  My final thoughts: I had a great facial massage by Anne but just like one Yelp Naysayer had said, \"it's not your mama's spa. It's your grandmama's spa.\" It wasn't hot, trendy or that much inviting.  It felt old and cold. So, I ended up paying $77 for the facial.  Why I paid that much for a $50 treatment? Because $27 was the gratuity that was included.  That's more than the 20% I was willing to pay.    That's the reason why I said Spa Week is a cheap trick because if I wanted to pay regular price for a facial, I wouldn't participate in Spa Week. Tomorrow is the last day of this \"special deal,\" so if you haven't sign up on their web site: www.spaweek.com, DON'T."}
{"text":"If you have to be in Phoenix this is the place to be. I didn't fall in love with Phoenix, but the hotel was lovely. Frank Lloyd Wright hotel, with that beautiful art deco vibe. Several pools with one main one that has a swim up bar. Fitness area, great local hiking trails and Frank and Alberts restaurant in the hotel was amazing.   We stayed at the terrace section of the hotel and we had a little pool right down stairs. If you want to go somewhere hot and mostly stay and enjoy the hotel this is a very good option."}
{"text":"My husband and I purchased a package that included a night's accommodations and dinner for two at Frank & Albert's at a charity auction last year.  But just like Groupon, the voucher was about to expire so we stayed in June.  Did we get a $350 stay?  No, but it was for charity.  While the grounds are gorgeous and you cannot deny the impressive architecture, there are too many misses to for a luxury hotel.  First off, parking.  If I'm going to pay to self-park a half mile away in 110 degree heat, I might as well fork out a few extra dollars and pay the ridiculous $27/night for valet.  I understand parking fees in a city where space is at a premium, but this is Arizona.  This hotel, in particular, does not appear to be short on it.  Second, luggage handling and bell service.  We did not need these services, however, upon exiting our vehicle, it appeared the entire entrance was a chaotic mess.  Third, water.  Okay, charge me for Voss or Fiji, but you can't cough up a free bottle of your hotel branded water to guests that might be on the verge of heat exhaustion after making the trek from their car?  Even Holiday Inn Express gives me a free bottle, not to mention other Waldorf Astoria hotels I've stayed at.  Fourth,  while the restaurant prices seemed reasonable, the cafe prices were worse than any airport.  I suppose the restaurants are looking to draw in locals, but the cafe is only used by guests.    As for the rooms, ours was spacious and the bathroom had been remodeled relatively recently.  But it was odd that certain fixtures (faucets and towel racks) had been replaced, but others were not (bathroom tissue holder).  The rest of the room, however, was in dire need of an update.  The furnishings were tired and worn.  The bed was comfy, however.  I was also disappointed that the balcony wall was so high you could not see the gardens below from the room at all or from the balcony itself unless you were standing.  While I would possibly stay again, in a different building, I'm not sure.  I got the impression this is a party hotel of sorts.  We encountered more than one group of drunken guests that fell into this category.  Maybe next time, I'll be the drunken guest and have a whole new perspective."}
{"text":"The property is beautiful.  The lobby is very nice and so are the grounds.  That is where the great impressions ended...  We stayed in the Garden wing and our room was very dated and disappointing.  The bathroom was huge but very uninviting as There was 1 mirror for 2 separated sinks so one sink had no mirror.  The bathroom was poorly lit and there was even some mold in the tub.  As many other reviews mentioned it is crazy that there is no thermostat, rather there is an old heater/air knob system which is annoying.   We ate at 3 property restaurants  and had a great experience overall.  It is disappointing that they allow cigar smoking on the wright bar patio as the smoke drove us inside.  The pool was nice and had plenty of seating."}
{"text":"Wow, I am shocked by the negative reviews of the Biltmore. It was and to me is THE hotel of Phoenix. If you want more information about it, just click on the weblink and read all about it. The history of the Biltmore is amazing. Sure it's old but that only adds to its charm.   The Jewel of the Desert ...  http://www.arizonabiltmore.com/?WT/srch=1  You could never had a hotel like this built today because of all the land it's on. The grounds for parking alone are huge, bigger than most hotels are. Quite amazing.  Just park your car and walk around inside and around the grounds. It's magnificent. We stayed recently on the other side of town for baseball games, none near here but if I was coming to Phoenix for sightseeing, my first choice to stay would be the Biltmore."}
{"text":"This review is for the Thanksgiving dinner buffet served in the Gold Room at the Arizona Biltmore on Thursday November 26th. We had 1:30 reservations and arrived 5 minutes early. For some reason we were seated outside on the patio, surrounded by empty tables as  everyone else was seated inside. I thought it was odd at first but the weather was beautiful and I thought better to be outside with the garden view than inside with all the crowds of people.   Within 30 seconds our server was at our table. She said her name was Nic, like Nic at night. She welcomed us and made us feel like we were her only guests. Offered us complementary champagne and showed us inside to the unbelievable buffet.   We started with the small plates, crab & avocado, herb poached shrimp, truffle lobster medallions, seriously good food. We then hit the cheese and fruit station filled with imported cheeses, meats, olives and assorted breads. The entrees were also incredible as they featured a carving station with roasted tom turkey, prime rib & maple glazed ham. Other entrees & sides included coriander dusted sea bass with lemon cream, Lavender glazed chicken, baked cauliflower with walnuts, sage sourdough stuffing, garlic mashed potatoes and of course gravy.   Our server Nic continued to keep our champagne glasses full while all the time making sure we had everything we needed, replacing cloth napkins and silverware as needed.   In the end, even though I did not think I could eat another bite, I managed to try the cherries jubilee made fresh with a splash of Grand Mariner and scoop of vanilla bean ice cream.   Yes, it was a pricey meal but definitely worth it and an eating experience I will not soon forget. Oh and nic if you are reading this, thank you for making our thanksgiving dinner extra special!"}
{"text":"This iconic hotel that I believe dates back to the 1920's is a must in my book. I believe every President has stayed here. Steeped in history that is an interesting read. It is a beautifully restored resort with gorgeous architecture.  It is laid out on a huge piece of property. With that in mind, there will be walking involved. More than you might imagine. If this is a concern for you, you may want to stay in the main building. There are many buildings. The grounds are well manicured, maintained and are stunning. It is impressive upon arrival.   Check in was smooth  We had to walk quite a ways to our room. Like I felt like I was on a hike. Had it been raining I'm not sure what we would have done because the entire journey was uncovered. I know rainfall is low here, but a woman thinks about these things.  The room was outdated and was in a one level structure that had about 4 rooms. Strange. We called to make a change which was granted. The room we were moved to was fabulous. Modern, quite large, french doors leading out to a wonderful patio. May I move in? I opened my french doors one morning while relaxing over coffee and birds flew in!!!  Wouldn't you have liked to be a fly on the wall as I screamed in hysteria.  The resort has a beautiful spa, full sized gym, pools, miniature golf/putting and bike rentals.  Oh it even has a life sized chess board. The restaurants are lovely and delicious. There are fire pits and couches on patios with communal seating off the main lobby. I did not even need to leave here. The entire experience was luxurious. Understated quiet refined luxury."}
{"text":"I'm an architecture moron. I have no knowledge about it and can't appreciate it when I see it, unless you count my pointing at a building while saying, \"That's pretty!\" as \"appreciation\".  A few months ago I attended a seminar at the Biltmore. About an hour into it, I leaned over to a friend sitting next to me and whispered that the conference room we were in was \"really cool\". Not sure why, not sure how, but somehow my diminished-capacity brain for architecture detected something, I guess, extraordinarily \"pretty\". Some time later, and I swear this is true and I'm not making it up, another equally diminished-capacity friend (we're all lawyers, 'nuff said) sitting on my other side leaned over to tell me, \"Hey, this room is pretty amazing isn't it?\" He hadn't heard me say anything to my other friend. The room was so amazing that even two architecture morons' dog-like instincts for pretty buildings were setting off alarm bells in their thick skulls, completely independent of each other.   Only after we finished the seminar did we learn that the conference room was, of course, designed by the late, great Frank Lloyd Wright circa 1929. I am unable to explain the intangible details of why it was so incredible, other than to say that while sitting inside it, everything felt perfectly balanced, perfectly in tune, and perfectly pretty.  I've been to the Biltmore on other occasions, to meet friends at the bar for a drink, and to have tea with guests who were staying there. So I've experienced as much of it as one can without ever actually spending a full night there. It is fabulous. And very pretty."}
{"text":"I've written about the grounds, I've written about the rooms and I've written about the restaurants. Now it's time to write about the blissful and majestic spa on the grounds of the Arizona Biltmore. Oh I could very easily get used to doing a spa day every day. However, until that heavenly day comes, I will be content with doing a relaxing spa day here and there when my pocket books lets me.   This spa excels in customer service, amenities and services. First of all, the customer service is sublime. They aren't pushy but they are always available. They keep a smile on their face and aim to please without being overly aggressive or coming off sarcastic. The amenities are state of the art. During a spa day, you have access to the tennis courts which are right outside the gym doors, the gym and their equipment that's perfect (especially their treadmills with personal tvs), a jacuzzi, sauna, resort pool and more. You can also partake in a group hike, group bike ride or several other daily activities they offer.   Now let's talk about the services. I've visited their hair salon and most recently, the actual spa. I got my hair done in the salon for my sister's wedding years ago and they did a fabulous job. On my most recent visit, I got a Swedish massage. During my massage, my massage therapist was amazing and gave me one of the best massages I've had. In addition, she was extremely friendly (but not chatty which I appreciate because I don't like talking during a massage).   This spa offers specials every month, including a Tranquil Tuesday special where you can get a facial or massage for just $75 on Tuesdays between 2-8 PM. Now you know where I will be during the summer!"}
{"text":"Supposedly, this is the nicest resort in the area. If this is true, next time I'll stay in a different area! I came in for a few days for a business trip. First off, if you choose not to pay for valet, you have to park very far away (10 minute walk) in the parking garage. This wouldn't be so bad, however once you get to the garage, they provide NO signs showing you the way back to the hotel. I had to ask two different employees where to go as I was heaving my luggage along.  Finally I made it to the front desk (dripping in sweat from the exercise in my business suit in the hot AZ sun), and I was anxious to check in so that I could rest in the king sized bed that I had reserved. The lady at the front told me that they only had 3 kings left, as if I wasn't important enough to occupy one. This was strike two. Making it up to my room, there were several other details that I found to be disappointing. First, my room was blazing hot and it took a good 20 minutes to cool down. This was highly frustrating given my arduous journey from the parking lot. Next, I found pubic hairs in the bathtub. I'm not necessarily one to take baths in hotels anyway, but it was still disgusting to see.  Crawling into bed, I noticed a browned splotch of blood in my sheets. The last and final complaint I have about this  very disappointing experience is the fact that when I left the parking garage in the morning, I realized that I had to pay for it. I'll say it again, I HAD TO PAY TO PARK 10 MINUTES AWAY. Are you kidding me, Biltmore? To anyone reading this post, take my advice and stay at the Ritz! By the way, I never post about anything. I was truly so angry about my experience that I felt the need to warn others."}
{"text":"Highly recommended.  Beautiful resort with great pools and hot tubs, convenient poolside service, clean rooms, a nice outdoor area with fire pits to lounge by at night, a great breakfast buffet, and cute shops on site. But the best part was the friendly staff. Everyone who works there is so friendly and courteous, which made our stay all the more better.  Couldn't have asked for a better vacation.  Hope to go back soon."}
{"text":"A picturesque historic resort property ideal for a small- to mid-sized business meeting or retreat. The rooms are nicely kept up and the décor of the property is consistent throughout--from the bricks on the outside of the façade to the meeting rooms and lobbies. The only thing that deviates is the new \"Frank and Albert's\" restaurant that looks less like the property as a hole.  If you're ever there, it might be worth asking the staff about the \"secret room\" used during Prohibition--if you're a nerd like me, they might even show it to you! While what it is now is TOTALLY disappointing, the story itself is fascinating.   When you visit, be sure to have a cocktail out on the patio (Wright Bar) and say hello to the Biltmore's feral cat, Simba. I'm going to stop myself now--they call this thing a FERAL cat. It lives at the freakin' Biltmore. The thing looks immaculately groomed and VERY well fed. It is NOT feral."}
{"text":"The high tea was extraordinary!  Mr. Kevin and his assistant provide an exquisite experience.  The depth of knowledge that Mr. Kevin has about every aspect of the tea service is incredible.  He is more than willing to share the intricacies of the entire meal.  He was professional, attentive and downright extraordinary!  Don't miss the experience!"}
{"text":"SUMMARY:  biggest problem at this hotel is no thermostats in the room.  Read on...  First, this historic hotel has 3 different Yelp listings, all with their own set of reviews.  Not sure why that is, but make sure you read all of them.  Yelp really should consolidate them, but for now, make sure you go to the other Arizona Biltmore listings on Yelp and check out the reviews there too....  I've spent many Christmas Eve's on the Biltmore's patio because I have family that lives just a mile away and we love the atmo.  This year I decided to splurge and rent a room at Christmas.  Everything you read about the \"fallen on hard times\" aspect of the guest rooms is true.  It's obvious that Hilton (aka Waldorf Astoria) has decided to not sink any more money into this property for upkeep and they're relying on the majesty of the architecture and main lobby etc. to pull them through.  The result is generally disappointing but then they're offering pretty good deals for rooms (and you can understand why since the guest rooms are somewhat run down or falling apart).  The reason we loved our stay: the pet policy.  You can bring Fido and Fifi with you on your vacation.  That was the big upside.  The downside:  1)  NO THERMOSTATS IN THE FREAKING ROOM!  Ok, Waldorf Astoria WTF?  It's cold in Arizona in the winter.  We needed to use the heater.  Guess what?  It doesn't turn off on its own once it reaches a certain/any temperature.  It just keeps on blowing.  So you have to get out of bed multiple times during the night to continuously turn on/off the mother-bleeping heater.  After it gets too hot, jump out of bed to turn it off, then an hour later, it's cold again and you have to jump out of bed again to turn it back on.  NO - it wasn't broken.  We had engineering to our room twice.  Each time the guys just shrugged and explained that there was no thermostat.  Considering that thermostats cost all of $30, it's a travesty that GM of this hotel hasn't ordered thermostats for the guest rooms.  2)  Clueless, absolutely clueless front desk personnel.  The front desk personnel are mostly under 30 and maybe even under 25.   Let's just say that you get what you pay for.  They don't know about their own property, give out lots of wrong information and don't know themselves that there are NO THERMOSTATS IN THE GUEST ROOMS!  If they knew, they wouldn't have to send engineering over to tell us.  Our final bill was wrong and I had to explain to the person that checked us out how the debit/credit columns worked on the receipt I was given, explaining that we weren't credited for something we'd already paid for.  They also didn't know how the bike rentals worked.  3)  Severely understaffed.  We had to call the front desk (or \"0\") many times during our stay and there were times when the phone rang over 5 minutes before ANYONE picked up, even the operator.  4)  Noisy spa.  Forget about that \"renewal\" and \"rejuvenation\" that the pretty brochure promises.  I went to the spa 3 times and each time there were annoying chattering women dittering away about nonsense, their voices echoing against the tile, each freaking time.  Some of those times it was spa personnel speaking in their loud \"stage\" voice.  Unbelievable.  Imagine trying to relax when that dittering female chatter is in Hebrew (probably the ugliest language on the planet next to German) and understand that it is no place to go if you want some peace and quiet -- no one enforces the \"quiet\" zones and there are no signs or verbal prompts to please keep quiet from staff.  5)  Dirty premises.  We saw a room service tray lying on the ground for two whole days outside the door of the room next to us and no one came to pick it up.  We walked by it each time we went in/out of our room.  Another time we waited all day for our room to be serviced and no one came, even 4 hours after we put in a request for it.  Our stay wasn't a total disaster, but want to realistically explain to wide-eyed potential guests that, as romantic as the premises are, the hotel is not being well managed and it is sorely in need of some repair and upgrades, and possibly a whole lot of re-training of personnel too.  We'll still probably come back, but only if they get some freaking $30 thermostats installed into the guest rooms.  3 Stars are for Frank Lloyd Wright's vision and subtract two stars for some shoddy management."}
{"text":"This is probably the worst run resort I have ever stayed in.  (Correction - it is definitely the worst run resort I have ever stayed in.  See update below.)  It is virtually impossible to get anyone on the phone at the front desk, the spa, or the manager's office.  The people at the spa don't know what their own services entail.  The prices are difficult to find, and are ridiculously overpriced even by resort standards.  No one ever responded to the email we sent to the spa to book an appointment.  The amount of the service charge and delivery charge for room service are not specified on the menu (and there is no explanation why there are two charges added for room service).  The signs on the large property are few and far between.  We were told the pool is open 24 hrs but the materials in the room state it is open only until 11:00 pm.  A groundskeeper started working with a leafblower outside our room at 8:45 am on a Saturday morning.  We booked a room with a patio, but there was only one chair on the patio.  The coffee maker in the room didn't work correctly.  One of the reading lamps on the bed was missing.  We've been here less than 12 hours and these are only some of the issues we've encountered.  Stay anywhere else but here until the current managers are removed or retrained.  Update - I received a text message from the hotel asking me to rate my stay so far.  I responded with a 4 on a scale of 1 to 10.  Hotel sends me a response saying they are sorry and asking what is the problem.  I send a list to them.  Four hours later, still no response.  I doubt I will be coming back to this place.  It doesn't even deserve one star."}
{"text":"Spent the weekend here in the Ocatilla section of the hotel. It is a nice upgrade, and includes a club area that serves complimentary happy hour drinks, finger food, and a continental breakfast.  There are plenty of pools here to find whatever level of excitement you are looking for. The grounds are perfect. The rooms still have that retro feel to them, which is nice. You feel like you are stepping into a different time warp.  Service around the property was very good, from the room to the pool to the restaurant (Wright's, where the meal was also very good.)  My only complaint with the property is that there are no-smoking signs all over the property, but nobody seems to care, which is a shame. The smell of smoke could be found pretty much everywhere outside. I would definitely return, especially since it is close to home. In fact. we already have another weekend planned later in the year for a long weekend."}
{"text":"Ok, let's start with what this hotel IS NOT:  It was officially NOT designed by Frank Lloyd Wright. The architect of record is Albert McArthur, though he sought advice from FLW on the \"block system\" that was stylishly used on the place to great effect.   But...there are obvious FLW influences throughout the property (especially in the main building lobby), and  (because FLW was a true ****) he said in public that this is McArthur's design while privately trying to take credit. That being said, I am an FLW fan and was lucky enough to spend a lot of time in one of his Paradise Valley homes...and this place has just enough \"vibe\" to it to make anyone seeking the FLW feel be happy. Ok, I digress...  If you are looking for a sparkly clean, no cracks, built in 2012, all amenities resort...don't come here. This property is old school charm and elegance to the max. The thing it doesn't (and shouldn't) have is that extra \"something\" preferred by 30-ish middle America d-bags that only comes with a hip spa that paints \"your lady's\" toenails with American flags. Gross.   This property is for anyone who appreciates old school luxury. The main building's \"classic rooms\" are throwbacks. They aren't huge, the windows aren't perfectly sealed, you can hear a bit of your posh neighbors' conversations...but in this setting, wouldn't you want to?  The grounds are stunning and gorgeous and the staff was impeccable.   I checked in and, after being asked twice if I was there for a special occasion, was given a free upgrade (to my already discounted December rate) to a suite overlooking the hills with a near private swimming pool. Problem was: it was TOO BIG for the two of us and we didn't want to be by the lovely tennis courts...we wanted the action. So they seamlessly transitioned us into one of the much smaller main building rooms. Bliss.   Within an hour of checking in to our new room, a knock came...behind the knock was a man delivering a bottle of sparkling wine, two flutes and a plate of six huge chocolate covered strawberries. Also on the tray was a note from the front desk guy (Frankie - you rock!) congratulating us on our celebration and expressing his hope that we liked the new room. Come on, that's a class move.   Anyway, we immediately went downstairs, ordered a Monte Carlo and a perfect Manhattan, sat by the fire pit and watched the sun go down behind the gorgeous Camelback Mountain - all the time feeling more and more like Spencer Tracey and Katherine Hepburn than a regular LA couple out to visit the 'rents.   Old school luxe, charm and hospitality...low d-bag quotient. I love you, Biltmore, even if Frank Lloyd Wright wasn't your principal architect..."}
{"text":"Beautiful Arizona resort!  The overall resort experience and central location makes it a top recommendation for out of town guests.The distinctive Frank Lloyd Wright architecture and views make it one of the most beautiful spots in Phoenix, even for locals it's great for a weekend retreat or just an afternoon or evening walking around and having a great meal or grabbing a drink!"}
{"text":"Great food. Awesome view of the entire city. This is where you go to be treated like a king.  Fantastic beverage selection top rate service."}
{"text":"I won't be coming back.  I came here for a conference in April 2012. The hotel itself is a little run down.  Several people I talked to had problems with their rooms needing repairs. The grounds are attractive as long as you don't look to close. The property has the square block style of Frank Lloyd Wright design, and many of the blocks and mortar are in need of repair.   On our first night here we walked with our two young kids to one of the restaurants on the property. We were seated immediately, then left after 20 minutes when nobody came by our table. Went back to the room and ordered room service (young kids getting very hungry and cranky by this time) and we were told 45 minutes for the order. Ok. It took an hour and a half. I told them we have four people eating but they only sent settings and drinks for two. Fine - we'll take it at this point.  The next morning we were awakened by a maintenance worker in our room. \"You have a problem with your bathroom light?\" uhhhh....no and why did you let yourself in to our room without knocking? No apology, he just left. Strange.  There are some nice things about this place. For kids, it is great. They have an awesome water slide and countless pools. There is a shaded play area for kids that rivals many community parks. For the grown ups, there is a swim up bar. There are also several putting areas, a croquet game, and one of those giant chess sets that nobody uses.  For the price and claimed prestige of this hotel, i found it to be a big let down."}
{"text":"Horrible. On 2 separate occasions I tried to order food from my room at the Biltmore.  BIG MISTAKE.  I tried to order a burger but was told they have NO HOT FOOD available at 11pm.  I tried to order a chicken quesadilla at 2:00am but was told they have NO HOT FOOD available.  I asked how long it wold take to make hot food and they said 20min, but when I called back 20 min later, they said 25 - 30 min.    Please note, the Late Night dining menu says food will be available from 11pm - 5am.  This is a complete LIE, there is no food available during these hours.   I will never stay here again, nor will I recommend anyone I know to this hotel.  Stale, outdated, very far from parking, inconsiderate, unhelpful employees, and worse."}
{"text":"After reading some of the reviews here and on Flyertalk, I was fearful that the Biltmore had really gone downhill. We stayed last weekend, and I have to report that it is still as wonderful as always. Very pleasant service, friendly staff. I asked to be in the Villa area and was asked which section! Love the Frank Lloyd Wright architecture. We'll b back."}
{"text":"Avoid! I flew in for a conference and was severely underwhelmed by my experience here.   Decor: meh, old, dated, not really kept up well  Room amenities: no coffee maker? Yes, they've got a tv and the room doesn't feature much else that feels modern  Staff: first impression was the blonde front desk girl telling me how she wanted to leave her job. Then she proceeded to charge me incorrectly.   Food: good.   Setup: running far behind and unaware of the small details. They grasped the large ones, just not the small ones.   Overall, I didn't like it. I've stayed at other flagship properties of this hotel group and found myself wondering where the supposed luxury was. I didn't see it at any point during my stay.   You can do better."}
{"text":"I'd heard a lot about the Arizona Biltmore, but hadn't stayed there until this weekend - it was really cool!  You arrive to a unique-looking hotel that's unlike most architecture you'd ever seen.  Frank Lloyd Wright-inspired design, fixtures and art are definitely noticeable throughout the hotel, but especially in the main lobby - check-out the Gold Room (one of the main ballrooms) and see some amazing design as well as cool tapestries.    My room was great (a King Bed Resort) and had a lot of space (about 500 square feet - bigger than my first San Francisco studio) and included a balcony that looked out over a perfectly manicured garden courtyard.  I was located near the second pool, which was great since no one else was really there.  The main pool was also amazing and even has a cool slide.  The hotel's fitness center was pretty good and had all the equipment you'd need for a proper workout.    Overall, everything was so well-taken care of and the staff were all very friendly and pleasant.  I really had a great time and enjoyed my stay.  It's one of those resort hotels where they really do have everything there - you don't have to leave the grounds and can have a great and relaxing time."}
{"text":"One of my favorite resort for staycation. I've stayed here several times always in the summer for staycation.  My recent stay here was in July and enjoyed spacious room at one of their one bedroom villa with kitchen.  Living room with high ceiling makes you feel really open and spacious. Room also has a laundry room, ideal for long stay. Bedroom gets really dark should you choose to sleep in in the morning.   I enjoyed staying at Ocatilla building with lounge access several years ago. I think they don't allow kids there and ideal room type to choose if you want to be away from crowds. Their bathtub is huge, enjoyed relaxing there.  Their main pool gets busy and pool side service could get slow sometimes. I like to hangout by their pool and have a few cocktails.  They have small water slide and kids of all ages enjoyed sliding down. Cabana looks inviting, thought about renting one for birthday party someday.  I always admire their architecture design influenced by Frank Lloyd Write. First time when I stayed here over 15 years ago I thought property was dated but with some remodeling done in the past 10 years, inside bedroom is new and clean. Lobby was under remodeling last month, looking forward to coming back when it is all completed."}
{"text":"The Biltmore is superbly impressive from the moment you drive up and keeps your eyes dancing throughout your stay.  So much history and so much charm, this place is part Playboy Mansion, part Neverland Ranch and part Palace of Versailles.  Life size chess sets on the perfectly manicured lawn, fountains at every turn, an undeveloped mountain range as its backdrop, and poolside cabanas fit for Marilyn Monroe (she called the Biltmore her favorite pool).  Indeed, the halls are lined with photographic history of famous guests spanning the resort's opening in 1929 to present day.  (I didn't take a star off for the picture of our current prez who's a repeat guest, but I was tempted).  It makes you feel like royalty to just be there, even if you're an average Joe like me.  I give an enthusiastic A+ to the SERVICE, landscaping, feather-topped bed, and aesthetic appeal/charm of the grounds.  I was most impressed with the service.  With rooms running $600 a night, you don't want to find out that only half of the staff got the five star customer service training.  Biltmore has it down from the front desk to groundskeepers.  A special mention of the 24/7 town cars waiting to pick you up any time you're ready  to step out.  I give an A to the spa which could use a face lift, but nonetheless awarded me the best massage and facial that I've had this millennium.  Also to the in-room dining which was kinda yummy, but lickety-split, the fastest room service I ever had.  I give an A- to the room decor.  They are going for that Mission-style rustic chic, but it looked a little too Hilton and could use less of the \"standardized theme\" decor.  But, the rooms were very well kept and sparkling clean.  I stayed in, and highly recommend, a \"resort deluxe\" room and think it's worth every extra penny to wake up to coffee on your private balcony with a view of the mountains.    If I hadn't stayed there in the middle of winter I could have played at one of their eight pools. (I'd def hang at the one with the waterslide AND the swim up bar.)  On the flip side, it was nice to have the resort virtually to myself; I had no problem getting room service in less than 1/2 an hour or a couple same-day reservations at the spa.  *psst* It's Frank Lloyd Wright \"inspired.\"  The actual architect was a student of his, but the big guy didn't actual design the hotel.  Darn good knock-off though!"}
{"text":"Great location and history here.  Overall a nice place but has really never blown me away."}
{"text":"I had pre-read about the Biltmore before I showed up and stayed at this historic masterpiece. There is so much to like about this place that you would be awestruck in when you visit the grounds. It being a Frank Lloyd Wright inspired architectural masterpiece is a reason alone to come stay in this landmark.  The gardens and grounds of the Biltmore Waldorf Astoria were well manicured with the fountains and statues sprinkled throughout the grounds.  The highlight of my stay here was the free history tour that was 90 minutes. The on site historian gave an exclusive history lesson on how the Biltmore came to be. He went into a lot of detail about how Wrigley yes the chewing gum Gent, bought the Biltmore during the great depression because they had ran out of money. Then it makes sense that the Wrigley mansion is right across the street from the Waldorf Astoria hotel. The historian also told us details about all the statues the architectural work and a little history on Hilton itself.  The location of this hotel is perfect! It's not too far from the airport and close enough to many gyms and it has a walking trail right outside of the grounds where you can walk upwards of 5 miles one way."}
{"text":"11-29-14 My daughter took me for High Tea for my birthday.  Selection of teas was excellent and Julie and Kevin were knowlegeable about the teas.  I was rather disappointed with the table setting.  Silverplated pieces were tarnished, scones were dry and pastries were really not what you would expect served for High Tea.  Example of pastries:  mini loaf of pumpkin bread and sugar coated cinnamon roll. The devonshire cream, lemon curd and preserves were very dry, apparently had not been covered before placing in refrigerator.  There was no music and other tables in the room were not set.  There was no ambiance and not the type of setting you would expect from the Arizona Biltmore and the high price you pay.  I have been to \"High Tea\" in England, the Hackett House in Tempe and other places in the states and all really exceptional.  I did mention my observations and recommendations to Julie and what other \"High Tea\" places are doing.  In order to compete, same changes definitely need to be done.  Service was good and Julie really made up for the short comings by offering us different teas, bringing out a nice cupcake with a candle and offering me a box of tea to take home.  At this time, I would not recommend this place for \"High Tea\".  I would only recommend it as a place to taste different teas since Kevin Doyle and Julie do have a good knowledge of teas.  With improvements, this tea place can compete with the other well established \"High Tea\" rooms."}
{"text":"1) Requested the birthday package three times.  It was my Fiances birthday and was looking forward to surprising him.   a. Called when I made the reservation b. Called the day before arrival c. Asked at front desk - He had no idea which room had it but assured me one of the rooms had the birthday package d. no birthday package in either room :( 2) Dirty Linens a. Pulled of the top cover to find it stained and dirty.  The sheets were clean so I just slept under the flat sheet.   4) USED Condom wrapper at front door a. Pointed it out to bell hop and assured me that he would send someone immediately to pick it up.  b. It was still there when I checked out the following day 5) Cigar ash all over patio a.

{"text":"Beautiful resort, but remarkably sub-par accommodations. I spent 3 nights here for a conference, and was taken in by how unique the architecture was and how well-designed the features were. Beyond aesthetics, this resort did nothing but disappoint.  The beauty seemed to serve as a mere distraction to the massive nickel-and-dime operation going on here. I found that water bottles were not complimentary - no, instead they came at a highly convenient $8 dollars each! The tap water was barely drinkable either. The in-resort cafe was uninspired and similarly overpriced, but overpricing seemed to be the pastime at the Biltmore. For over $6, you can get a poorly made drink that they call a \"mocha\" too!   During my stay, the bathroom light did not work at all, so I was left to use the restroom in the dark, using my phone flashlight to see in the dark. I thought it fitting for a resort in the dark ages of accommodations. It's clear that the best days of the Arizona Biltmore are long past."}
{"text":"Thank you the Arizona Biltmore.  Our stay has been wonderful so far.  The room is beautiful, the grounds are are Immacualte.  We love our view from the third floor.  We had a small problem with the A/C and maintenance was \"Johnny on the spot fast\" to fix it.    Chip, thank you for the hike up Squaw Peak.  You were a pleasure to be with and did a great making my wife feel comfortable with the accent.  The excursion was well worth the money.  You did an excellent job.    Julie, your service at Frank and Albert's was over the top wonderful.  We had a great dinner and loved your recommendations.  We'll come back to see you before we leave.  You make the Biltmore something special."}
{"text":"Overall, great experience.  Wonderful scenery and helpful staff. Be prepared to pay an arm and a leg for everything though, even to breath!  Beds are way too soft though and the room air is pretty dry. A little ridiculous you have to pay for the water in the fridge. But, it is a very nice place."}
{"text":"Chose The Biltmore for our July 4th Staycation with friends. The check in process was orderly and efficient. Our upgraded from was not disappointing. So far, so good. The service at the Ocatilla pool was fantastic. The bar attendants took very good care of us. The problem we ran into was at the lobby bar. It was a busy holiday evening to be certain, but the service at the lobby bar was horrible. The four of us sat down and were not even acknowledged for more than 15 minutes and even then we had to physically track a server. After that, service continued to lack for the rest of the evening. Drink prices are exceptionally high, and for those prices we expected good service. Not so.  The property itself is beautiful and historic and we would consider coming back, but they need to step it up considerably in their main bar."}
{"text":"We stayed at Ocatilla Biltmore over Memorial Day.  Pros: 1 - great grounds- beautiful 2 - restaurants are good 3 - pools are nice  Cons: - pooljumpers everywhere - these nonpaying guests were smoking IN the pool and occupied a paid cabana without paying - kinda loud and very obvious from their conversation they were not paid guests. When I mention to lounge attendant was basically told nothing could be done about it - two times!!!! I don't understand that - I paid over $300 a night for an exclusive pool and people sneak in without paying and I am told \"nothing could be done about it\".  - We saw a young couple (non-Ocatilla residents) almost procreate in the pool. She truly was acting like a stripper and NO employee said or did a thing- and there were kids there- not to mention everyone else trying to enjoy their afternoon. - No exclusivity for the Ocatilla pool. They didn't monitor who used the pool even though we paid extra for the exclusivity. Rumor around the pool was that due to the rush of Memorial Day, the resort opened up all pools to all guests. Then why did they market the exclusivity of the pool to us and we paid for it?  - With Ocatilla we were told we would have unlimited beer/wine in the Executive Lounge. Arrive to Ocatilla to find it is only from 5pm to line 8pm. And it wasn't just us that were basically misinformed. WE met at least four other couples/groups that were told the same thing or at least extended hours for the free unlimited beer and wine. Someone was misinforming numerous guests either on purpose or by mistake- either way, big mistake. - The on duty manager comp'd us $120 to our room to make up for the above, but for the amount we were paying, that honestly didn't make too much of a difference. $120 bucks didn't make up for a ruined pool experience.   When I called to discuss with the manager later before posting this review (and I advised I would be posting this review), his assistant and I had a long discussion and she understood my issues and concerns. However, I still have not heard from the manager regarding these complaints.  It is a shame because it is a beautiful place that is worth checking out BUT DO NOT PAY FOR THE EXCLUSIVITY OF OCATILLA!  Thanks"}
{"text":"They gave me a complimentary night so I updated my review to a 3. The gesture is very kind of them but that horrid experience still happened. I'll keep ya'll updated with our next stay there ;)"}
{"text":"This is the 3rd time we've stayed here in three years for New Year's Eve. Last year our room was in the main building over the outdoor fire pit bar and was extremely noisy past midnight. Calls to front desk failed to quiet them. This year we are in a wing off main hotel. Much quieter but woke up to a lively scorpion on bathroom floor.  Our friend's balcony was littered with cigarette butts and it took forever to get glasses delivered to the room to celebrate an anniversary.  Chicken fingers for friends 11 yr old were actually raw at one end.  Short staffed?? And two small bottles of water with the Biltmore name in our room are $5.50 EACH."}
{"text":"Oh Biltmore. I don't suppose your half hearted service would wow the likes of Frank Lloyd Wright or McArthur (the architect of note)...the two men you push so hard in a desperate grasp for elitist street cred.   Your grounds are breathtaking...I mean wow. But your campus is filled to the brim with those who would rather rub shit in the wounds of drowning penguins than help with their whole heart.  While at the bar, your bartender Alex was remotely friendly, as he watched the clock, desperate to check out. His short sentences and constant asides as he graciously served your expiring seafood buffet to his coworkers via to-go boxes. Hush hush of course. And on the Q-T. Quite underwhelming considering I'm supposedly at a 5 Star Hotel.  I didn't appreciate the restaurant hall monitor asking me if I had paid for the said seafood buffet either. Real amateur hour here.  The front desk avoided my questions regarding the numerous placards in the room describing what to do if stung by a scorpion...which seems quite common here.   Didn't like parking in a structure a mile away, and fudging for payment each time I entered and exited...to avoid a retarded $27 valet charge. Give me a break.  The parking is more suited to a ghetto hotel in South CHICAGO.  Frank and Alberts buffet breakfast ($25)...if you've smelled feces a few times you know how it tasted.  I could go on and on. But I'll sum it up.  Wonderful grounds. Service that you may find at a Motel 6. Hilton owns this you know."}
{"text":"Beautiful property-but the compliments stop there. Expensive - as you would expect with the Waldorf brand, but the service SUCKS. Especially the front desk. My experience here leaves much to be desired. Would rather stay somewhere where they pamper you for the $$."}
{"text":"Stayed here with my girlfriend for a Radiohead show and a get away weekend from work.  Got the hotel for the amenities which were great, we played tennis, enjoyed the fantastic people watching at the pool, great cocktails to include the Tequila Sunrise, and some light putt putt outside our cottage.  The room was not ready when we got there so we got a cottage which was supposed to be an upgrade with a semi private patio.  The room was actually very nice and had a great tv which we might have watched for a grand total of 30 minutes in 4 days.  Our room was made up between 4-5 each day that we planned to stay there and then on the day we plan to check out, they came by at 8:30....not sure what the problem was there.  We also had to call about our A/C after we sweated the first night but it was fixed and no problems after that so maybe it was just a glitch which happens.  You are probably wondering what if anything was wrong, the only issue we had was the concierge.....nightmare, no help whatsoever.  Called several times, both girlfriend and I and got the reply on two separate occasions to just check google.  I have stayed at less nice hotels and had much better service with concierge, this hotel should realize what their clients might be interested in and do some research.    All in all, great trip and a nice and above par stay.  I would certainly stay here again if I can get my girl to go with me!"}
{"text":"If I could give this 6 stars I would. I stay at this resort once a year for a work related event and it never disappoints. The grounds are elegant and understated. The food at Frank and Alberts and the Wright Bar is fresh and delicious but to me the service is the thing that sets this place apart . Every staff member went out of their way to make us feel welcome , ensuring any request is met. Julie at the patio bar went out of her way to meet a special request and remembered our preferences! Hector in the cafe is a welcome face year after year and is always so friendly.  The beds are sooooo comfortable . My only critique is the spa and locker rooms need updating. Very worn. I can't wait to return next May."}
{"text":"Well manicured grounds and interesting architecture are the high points for this hotel.  Beautiful flowers and rolling grass lawns are a welcome contrast to the desert sandstone colored exterior. The rooms, however, feature outdated furniture and appointments, and the age of the hotel definitely shows in most of the interior spaces.   Another drawback was inattentive poolside service.  After a few minutes seated by the pool, we had to go find menus ourselves, at which point we also told a server that we'd like to order soon.  Back at our chairs, we waited about ten minutes for someone to come by before getting up and ordering at the bar.  Meanwhile, some of the employees were standing around doing nothing.   There was also an unacceptable level of daily maintenance for a hotel of this price point. Many of the trash cans that I saw on the grounds were filled to overflowing, attracting pigeons and other birds which were spreading the trash around as they picked at it.  Patio tables at one of the restaurants were left uncleared, causing the same unwanted avian infestation.   If management can bring up the standards of cleanliness and service, and implement a little modernization, this hotel can return to its former glory as a high class resort."}
{"text":"Me and the wife stayed a few days for work related business.  Room was clean and comfortable and staff did a good housekeeping job everyday.  The ballroom and halls where business seminars were held were impressive.  The food and drinks  that the resort provided was incredible.  Many pools around the resort. Decent gym center.  Due to heat, didn't experience their recreation activities or venture out of room much.  Summer is brutal in phoenix.  I thought their food prices at their cafe and the restaurant was outrageous so I just drove a mile or so to restaurants in the area for much cheaper.  Not sure if any rooms had kitchenettes but that would be a plus.  I would recommend putting shade on the free parking lots.  The cars are extremely hot in the daytime if you need to drive."}
{"text":"Beautiful beautiful property. Now for the sad bad news.  Apparently, they think with such a big name, beautiful property they can rest on their laurels.  The service was non-existent.  They didn't seem to know they  were at work to take care of the guests.  I most certainly won't be back (not that they'll notice or care)."}
{"text":"Good facilities let down by mediocre service. Kind of feel like everyone is on dope as they're total space cadets. Loads of little problems that just make for a disappointing experience. Ditzy check in, no heat in room, all power lost in room, painfully slow restaurant service which isn't very good. Topper was had a FedEx delivered two days ago, but package handling outsourced to FedEx and they guy with the key isn't here. Wouldn't come back, let alone bring a group back here. Aspires to 5 stars. Deserves 3. Long way to go.  Adding more as we stay - again let down by service. Big group dinner in Frank & Alberts. 2 hours + to serve preordered salads and pizzas. Waitress working hard but has to serve and clear a table of 18 herself. One busboy in the entire restaurant. Wtf."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Phoenix and wasn't certain what to expect from a \"historic\" hotel in AZ.  WOW. I loved the history of the place and the architectual influences of Frank Loyd Wright.  Very large property.  My husband and I stayed in the Villas - nice with a private bedroom feel and outdoor patio. If I were to return I would reserve a room overlooking the Garden or the Cottage Rooms. Both are packed with history.  Definitely a beautiful-unique \"historic\" hotel in AZ.    On the minus....No in room coffee/maker is unacceptable - particularly given the room service coffee will run you close to $15 w/ surcharges.  Patios and furniture in the resort section were not worthy 5-Star Hotel.  Grounds around the resort rooms/patios also need luxury spruce-up.   Late check-out resulted in 3 different housekeeping staff walking into my room while I was trying to get dress/pack.  All in All - still worth the stay..for the history and beauty of the hotel."}
{"text":"Arizona Biltmore is a classy sophisticated  Frank Lloyd Wright resort. The resort is gorgeous; the villas are elegant! The food is amazing as well! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I recently had the opportunity to stay at this world class resort, but was startled awake at 6am on a Sunday when they drove 50 antique cars past our window and onto the grass 10 feet from our door. I then realized our room was full of exhaust fumes and could barely breathe due to my asthma. They then proceeded to rev engines and test their PA with loud music and \"test, test\". About 1000 people attended this event just outside our door until 3 pm. As it turns out the Concours d' Elegance car show was that weekend.   This is where the Biltmore failed. When we checked in, instead of saying, \"good choice of room,\" they should have told us what would be going on outside our room at 6 am the next morning and offered to move us. It was well known due to blizzards in the east that although they were sold out, there were many rooms unoccupied at that time and perhaps someone affiliated with the car show would prefer a front row experience.  The worst part of this is they attempted to compensated us with two free drinks. Seriously??!!! By this time I had left and went to my home where I could breathe better and left my husband alone at his work event.   I am disgusted with the Arizona Biltmore. I no longer have any respect for this establishment. You should be ashamed of yourselves!"}
{"text":"We have stayed here twice now, and will return.  My husband and I recently booked an \"all inclusive\" weekend at the Ocatila and it was fantastic. The perfect couples getaway. Although, the resort in general is great for families, the Ocatila Executive Suites are perfect for a quiet, relaxing stay. With a huge comfortable bed, and spacious bathroom I was in heaven. Need I mention CLEAN. We also enjoyed the complimentary wine and hors d'oeuvres  every evening.  We had fantastic spa services in the mornings. My husband said it was the best massage he's ever had. Our days consisted of lounging by the pool. If you go ask for Jamee to be your pool side server. She was amazing, we never had an empty glass.  In the afternoons we had fun putting around the free putting course located within the resort.   We tried both the hotel restaurants, but highly recommend Frank & Albert's. Much better value and friendlier service than the other."}
{"text":"Jeez!! Lots of complaining. Been coming here since 2003 for business and pleasure, not sure what all the bitchin' is about! This place has character and history. It is looking a bit tired, but not dated. I suspect that new management will continue to chase down these areas to maintain the allure of the property.   I am not a Biltmore apologist, and see some areas that have changed over time; but there are a few complaints that i see as frivolous.   Parking lot too far? Try the valet!  Valet Too expensive? Try the walk! Parking lot too far? Again, What in the hell is wrong with walking a hundred yards or so? I know I need the exercise, and I just finished an Ironman (which is why I am celebrating here!) Too hot? Walk inside the conference lobbies. What do you really expect for Phoenix?  A scorpion sighting? Shock! You are in the desert and we are out-numbered by a Wide margin. Can't comment on the spa.  People here generally aim to please--i try to make it easy for them to do that.  This place remains a fantastic value; having reasonable expectations is important--which I find to be helpful in life as well ;-)"}
{"text":"Went for a 2 day work event with my family of 4 (a fun working vacation is what I imagined).   My room had a 19\" TUBE tv... Seriously?! Do those even exist still? Especially in a resort? I haven't owned one of those since the 90's.   The beds only had 2 pillows a piece.... Don't hotels usually come with 4 pillows per bed? That's a rhetorical question as I travel frequently and every hotel I've stayed in does... Except for this resort.   The bathtub and shower was something out of a low rent apartment - $300 a month low rent apartment, but here I am paying $300 a night at a resort.   Here's the kicker - there were 140 people in my group and the ones I was able to connect with all were blown away with their rooms. I was the only one traveling with my family; my colleagues were alone. They took videos and photos of their rooms cause they were so impressed. I'm looking at rooms that had HUGE flat screen tvs, living rooms with couches and arm chairs, beds with 5 pillows, one room had a bath tub so large 3 adults could fit in it. FOR ONE PERSON. Why they would put my family of 4 in literally the smallest, crappiest room they had, I have no idea... But there was a huge, discriminatory difference between the room my family of 4 were put in and my singular colleagues were put in.   Also, my daughter forgot her iPad and iPhone chargers, and when I called to see if they could send it to us, the person I spoke to took 15 minutes to tell me they found a Samsung charger in a room that wasn't even mine. Wow, great for that customer, how about me?  I ended up just ending the call without resolution, frustrated. I would rather buy new chargers than listen to list of the stuff they found that belonged to other customers.   I was VERY excited to come to this resort, and was VERY disappointed with the experience. Just way too bad. Bad news gets around way faster than good news, and I plan on sharing this bad news for years to come, at every work event as a horror story, and at family events as a cautionary tale."}
{"text":"Beautiful hotel, friendly staff and lovely room.  I had some really bad luck with a bad TV and  a shower that wouldn't drain but I doubt that applies to the entire hotel.  Free wifi was a surprise given this is a Hilton property, but I was disappointed that they charged me $12 to self park my car in a lot far from the hotel."}
{"text":"Nice hotel that offers all the great history and ambiance of a time past.  Many of the rooms have been renovated, but always make sure you ask for one, as the others are old and dated.  Love the feel of the place."}
{"text":"Great Resort.  Kind of out in the boonies... but I think Phoenix is pretty spread out over all.  I loved the green grass and palm trees in the middle of winter.  It has a great view of some mountain... that when the sun sets is totally stunning especially with the manicured lawn in the foreground.  I had a room in one of the cabins.  It was very very quiet and relaxing.  Over all great stay!"}
{"text":"First, let me say I have traveled for over 10 years and have stayed in numerous hotels. I have even stayed at this location before and found the hotel to be just OK but I feel like I stayed somewhere else as reflect back. The service and accommodations for this stay are well below the Waldorf Astoria and Hilton standards.   I originally checked into a room in the older part of the hotel which turned out to be excessively loud because of some unknown noise. The front desk offered to send Engineering up to inspect the problem but no one ever showed up. Next, I went downstairs and kindly requested a new room as no one seemed to want to address the issues. I was directed to the far side of hotel called the Terrace Court.  The rooms in this part of the hotel are very dated and seem more like an old Hampton inn rather than a Waldorf Astoria.   As a gold member with Hilton I am extremely disappointed with the service and particularly the rooms. I do not recommend risking a stay at this particular hotel until it's renovated and the staff realize the level of service that is expected from this type of hotel."}
{"text":"Last weekend I went to the Biltmore to check out the pool in order to do a little bit of resort pool crashing. (shhhhh) Let's just say I was not disappointed. The water slide is fun. You exit underneath a beautiful waterfall. Pretty cool, even for big kids.  I was disappointed in the poolside menu. The portions are gigantic and over priced (higher than any resort at which I have had the fortune to crash)- way, way, way too big for somebody like me who just wants a quick bite to eat. Who wants to stuff themself when they're in public in their bathing suit (teeny bikini)? And there's no point asking for a to-go box because the leftovers would spoil in the sun and heat. So I ordered a \"cooked poolside\" taco for $5 and a fruit bowl for $5 (reasonably priced). I was stuffed after that.  I talked with a lady who said the room rates are great, but then they add on a $25 parking fee and many other fees. Plus she said you have to walk far from your room to get to the pool.  All in all, it was a beautiful day and I'll be back. (shhhhh)  UPDATE: 6/30/2013 I went back with a friend today. It was really hot out so there were pitchers of ice water available all day. Great idea and thank you! The tacos kiosk was moved to a shady area, but that pool guy must have roasted while serving us! I saw the front of the hotel for the first time today. It looks like  a prison built over 50 years ago."}
{"text":"Over the past few years we've been to this property dozens of times for charity events and galas.  There are a handful of hotels that host a majority of these events and this is one of them.  One of the main reasons is because they offer high quality service in their banquet facilities.  They also have a separate building that houses a large ballroom and on some occasions they have valet service at that building, which makes it easy to get in/out.  Whenever we get invited to an event here, we look forward to it.  If you're looking for a nice place to stage an event, I recommend that you take a look at this place.  Return Factor - 100%"}
{"text":"Great comfy place to stay, idk why I wait so long to review but this place has an awesome pool slide w drinks server poolside (in) pool. I came here when the weather was over 100 degrees.    My massage sessions were awesome here, I highly recommend the spa. Great room service wheeled in all my champagne and alcohol that I brought w me lol.    Great grounds, so lovely. They recommended a great steak house as well."}
{"text":"5 stars because of a one person experience. Nitza Rubenstein exceeded above and beyond our expectations. We had a 5 day catered event in the MacArthur room, she skillfully and quietly performed her job and serviced everyone's needs. You wouldn't have even known she was there except that at every turn things were taken care of. She literally worked the room. We had an individual with very specific dietary needs, Nitza went to great lengths to accommodate her, ending the week with a parting gift of a huge bag of organic, New Zealand plums. Over the top! Well done Nitza!"}
{"text":"Horrible accounting person to talk too, front desk who checked me out adjusted a bill because we ended up paying parking fee which is supposed to be included in my package. After few days the adjusted amount got taken out from my account again. Talked to accounting told me that parking is not under their company so they have nothing to do with it.  That's why they can't adjust the parking fee. She told me we have so many  credit that they took care from the restaurant already. I told her of course because I bought the room with the summer  package. Breakfast, lunch and dinner are included. Even parking should be included, but no one explained to us how we are  able to get use the free parking. First time  hotel I stayed that I had confrontation. Servers was awesome. But will never stay here again...  I'm in hotel industry too, if it's our fault we usually take care of it and not tell to our guest awe! I'm sorry by the way parking is different company, we have nothing to do with it. But it's in your property... so sad!!!!"}
{"text":"Nice course.  Not overly difficult.  Wide fairways.  Average green speed   Not many traps.  Very little water.  Some small greens.  Nice people. Good service"}
{"text":"Typically, for the 4th of July, most people hang out with friends at a bbq and cool down by a pool. My family, on the other hand, decides to  travel to a city with a historical average temperature for that weekend of 100+ degrees.  Smart one.  Luckily, the parents chose a fancy-smancy hotel for us to stay at for our long weekend away: The Arizona Biltmore. It's a gorgeous hotel in the middle of Phoenix whose claim to fame is that every US President since its opening in the 1920s has, at one point in time, stayed at the Biltmore. The hotel spans a huge area with 8 pools scattered across its grounds, the largest of which is right next to the lobby.   I was prepared to spend my weekend lying by the pool and studying for my exams. Instead, I discover my room is in the furthest corner of the Biltmore complex and I'd have to walk through 103 degree weather to get to the pool. I make the trek anyway (the thought of pina coladas and mojitos spur me forward), only to find out the pool is filled with little kids. I finally find an empty chair below a beach umbrella, plop myself down and order my drink from the waitress (while the little twins sitting in the chair next to me start dripping over my books). The drink arrives and...I can't taste a drop of rum in my mojito.  ...There goes my perfect weekend.  Other than my disappointment by the pool, the rooms were nice and, most importantly, the A/C worked. Plus, at night when the temperature cooled down a bit, it was nice to walk around the Biltmore and admire the architecture.  Four stars overall."}
{"text":"Known as \"The Jewel of the Desert\" and the \"Grand Dame,\" this beautiful hotel is the only one in the world with a Frank Lloyd Wright-influenced design.  The architect was a man named Albert Chase McArthur, who had studied under Frank Lloyd Wright.  Hence, the main restaurant's name is \"Frank and Albert's.\"  Celebrating its 80th birthday this year, this unique art-deco resort is rich in history.  Dozens of presidents have golfed here, Marilyn Monroe splashed around in one of the 8 on-site pools, and many more celebrities and industry magnates have called this their temporary home.  When visiting here, it is important to note that on-site parking is costly.  A self parking fee of $12 is imposed even on its guests, and the self parking lot is often located some distance from the hotel entrance.  For those not wanting to bother with parking the car themselves, the price is$27 to valet.  The package I purchased luckily had the self-parking included, but the car was delivered to the valet nonetheless.  I was sure to speak to a hotel manager about how ridiculous it is to ask a hotel guest to pay for parking, and he happily credited our room for the valet fee.  So, my first experience was our dinner at \"Frank and Albert's\", formerly known as the \"Biltmore Grill.\"  Local purveyors provide the ingredients for nearly all of its organic dishes.  From Queen Creek Olive Oil to Shriner's Sausage, Mesa Ranch Goat Cheese to Biltmore grown Rosemary, one can taste the difference.  The menu provided a range of selections from salads, pizzas, and flatbreads, to rotisserie and classic comfort foods.  The wood stone baked filet of salmon was flavorful, tender, and full of tender feelings. I recommend their \"bloody rose\" cocktail.  I snicker as I write these words, because bloody marys are my least favorite cocktail.  However, this unique blend is made with crop organic tomato vodka and juice, fresh biltmore grown rosemary and spices.  Service was attentive and timely, waiter was very knowledgeable, and we were very impressed with the quality and flavor of the food.    Next, it was on to the newly added wing of the resort, the Ocatilla.  The Ocatilla is essentially a new boutique hotel situated on the Biltmore property.  It has its own pool, a concierge, and an executive lounge which offers daily complimentary breakfasts, a light evening fare, beer and wine, desserts, as well as coffee and soft drinks.Our package included a room on the third floor of this location, as well as access to its executive lounge.    Although our stomachs were full from dinner, we made room for chocolate covered cheesecake, choc. covered strawberries, fudge brownies, tarts, and chocolate chunk cookies.  We swallowed it all down with some prosecco, and headed up to our room.  The room was at least 500sq feet, and I believe that the rest of the hote has fairly sizeable rooms, as well.  The decor was a blend of art deco and southwestern.  The bathroom with its granite countertops, boasted a tub with sea salts and candle, in which we submerged ourselves comfortably up to our chins.  Two plush robes were there for us to lounge around in.  A snack bar was provided, although a package of nuts and dried fruit was $7.  Biggest disappointment was that that there was no wetbar.  I always look forward to these in any hotel room, especially to use them for storing leftovers from dinner.  The king bed was etremely comfortable, with its pillow-top mattress and feather pillows, as well as the high thread count sheets.  Silky soft...  We enjoyed peace and quiet all night, and were not disturbed in the morning by housekeeping.  The next day were were early to rise to enjoy the lavish continental breakfast spread in the lounge.  Granola with local pecans and yogurt parfait croissans with spinach and boursin, ham and cheese, small danishes, assortmnt of fresh fruits and juices gave us the perfect start to our day.  We grabbed some bottled waters and cokes and headed to the pool.  We had an appointment at the spa an hour later, for seaweed wraps and massages, and it was wonderful, the service excellent and very personalized.  Recommendations: go to biltmore's website directly to book a room. you will find incredible packages. our package was $200 and included dinner for two, lunch for two, 50% off at the spa, and access to the executive lounge at the ocatilla.  if you live locally, they will shuttle you - saves the parking headache.  About Ocatilla: basically an upgrade with your stay. For an additional $75-$100/day, these are the following amenities you will receive: complimentary beverages, wine, beer, breakfast, light evening fare, and desserts in the lounge business center (computers, internet, printers) Wii rentals  pressing service and shoe shine therapeutic turn down bath neck and shoulder massages every thursday personal concierge"}
{"text":"If you're trying to relax, look some place else. The pools are was overcrowded and when you pay for the upgrade for the kid free pool it's a complete lie. Children everywhere! Room was great, clean and cool. Beautifully decorated, just very poor execution with the pools etc"}
{"text":"I'm a Hilton Honors Diamond member, so I'm obviously super loyal to the brand.  However the Biltmore isn't right for everyone.  If you know what to expect, you can have a fantastic stay, but if you expect the Waldorf=Astoria experience, you will most likely be disappointed. Pros: - the public areas are incredible; the stunning lobby is worth a half hour sit to take it in - the pools areas are some of the best in Arizona (which have some of the best in the world) - most of the staff seems to be 4 star trained, which is hard to find in the relaxed Arizona resort row - the history of the hotel is unmatched in the state. You'll find cool touches in unexpected places (e.g. there's a Nancy and Ronald Reagan registration card with notes about their honeymoon in the room service menu). FLW is everywhere you look. - the fitness center is one of the best I've ever seen at a hotel, and it was free. Cons: - MAN are these rooms shabby!  I've stayed several times and toured 4 suites in preparation for a meeting.  All rooms are worn down, but this review is of the last stay in 2126 - the carpets are worse than frayed, there's actually a crease running the length of the room - the two nightstands, table, desk, and TV stand all are warped and peeling motel 6 style - the bathtub is worn and needs be glazed or resurfaced - the outdated leather headboard had had holes in it - every surface is scuffed - even the ceiling! - there was one front desk clerk for much of the stay.  Very difficult to get them to answer the phone and/or help with anything - no in room coffee.  This a resort practice of the PAST.  High end resorts used to feel fresh coffee brewed from the kitchen was compulsory as single serve coffee makers were brewing substandard watered down cups. Starbucks, Wolfgang Puck, and Lavaza are great brands that the Biltmore should look into..  Basically, if you'll be out of your room the entire stay, this place is great.  If you want a nice room, go down the road to Starwood Luxury Collection's Phoenician: much nicer iconic resort for the same rates."}
{"text":"No complaints here. I was there on business and there were clean, comfortable beds - the restaurants had great food. The aforementioned speedy Internet was great and there were lots of people who could still move without walkers nestled around the fire pits drinking (and smoking cigars) until bedtime ....  good times.   Just checking out the Frank Lloyd Wright architecture amused me for at least a day. The man had an amazing touch, and this is the only Wright hotel in the country. Amazing stonework and beautiful stained glass. It's a place to go if you just want to relax (cause there's nothing much to do here). No fast pace; no rush; not much to do but veg. If you play golf there's a very popular golf course and a nice spa."}
{"text":"Thank you for another amazing visit!! We rented one of your poolside cabanas for two days.....birthday celebration. Your manager Zach was so attentive to us...and a couple of issues that occurred. He is an excellent manager ....friendly, engaging and he is genuinely interested in his guests. We had the wonderful Eric on Friday and the delightful Megan yesterday, taking care of our food and refreshment needs, they were both lots of fun....very engaging and took excellent care of us all. We enjoyed our many interactions with them both. The gentleman with the hawk....wow!! We had several informative conversations with him over the two days, we learned a lot. Such a magnificent and beautiful bird..... We will hopefully be back soon, to enjoy your 5* resort. Thank you again!"}
{"text":"Tied with the Camelback Inn for my favorite resort/ hotel in greater Phoenix. I spent many a hot summer day here as I swam for the Biltmore's team until I was eight or nine, and since have returned periodically for events or other random occasions.  Since then, many things have happened at the Biltmore. It has continued to refine and improve upon its \"desert oasis\" accommodations by turning the pool area into a full-fledged water park for adults, equipped with bars and lounge chairs by the dozen.   The rooms are comfortable and elegant but manage not to overwhelm. It captures that which I try to convey to non-Phoenicians as all that is great about growing up in a desert, even in the summer months when it is most difficult to do so."}
{"text":"During the summer, we like to take a mini staycation. This year it was extra special as we also got engaged. Our stay at the Biltmore was just fantastic. The service exceptional, the food amazing- it was great at the pool, Wrights and also at Frank and Alberts. The only reason I am not giving it a full 5 stars is the 'upgraded' room was just a nice basic room. Though it was certainly nice, it wasnt what I expected for being the Biltmore. However, everything else certainly lived up to that expectation."}
{"text":"I visited this hotel after hearing good things about it's long history and beautiful grounds. The grounds are very beautiful and well maintained with very unique architecture. It makes for great pictures with the large manicured lawns and fountains. I did not stay in the hotel overnight though so I can't comment on the rooms. There is a self park garage on site too if you want to avoid the valet parking though it may be a walk to your room"}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to do a staycation weekend . First, the positives : 1. Our waitresses at Frank and Alberts were wonderful! Actually the entire staff is very friendly. 2. I've read others complain that the staff at the spa were not welcoming or attentive . That was not my experience. Lisa showed me around and made sure I was all set. My massage therapist was a lot of fun and did a great job. 3 The Bell/Valet staff were very friendly and helpful . 4 The room was clean and spacious. Plenty of pillows and a comfortable bed.   The reason for three stars :  1. The food is overpriced . It was good not great. The brownie for dessert was dry. The chicken was kind of thrown on the side of the Caesar salad and just didn't taste good . The Cosmo was so strong I had to pour water into it in order to drink it. The margarita was strong , cloying sweetness to it . For the price expectations are high. We didn't bother with brunch because our so so dinners cost over $300 so we weren't in the mood to pay another $88+ for brunch .  2. The Spa: other reviewers are right about the lounge : it is exactly like a doctors office waiting room. It is way too small and coed is not my thing. I advise if you go you do so first thing in the morning . It is brightly lit and you hear the staff interacting loudly. Not their fault, it is not physically set up to be relaxing . My attendant had issues finding my sandal size because they are crammed Willy nilly in empty lockers. Um: you're a resort. Go to Ikea and get some organizers. My biggest issue: unsanitary conditions. The benches in the locker room where bare private parts make contact are upholstered with velour material . FYI they have stains on them : pale yellow stains . There's a similar bench near the jacuzzi where wet bottoms sit . It's gross . This furniture should be washable and washed frequently throughout the day. There are quotes from the spa manager on the web and printed materials talking about health and wellness : word to the wise, someone is going to get MRSA . The jacuzzi only has two lounge chairs and the aforementioned velour bench for seating . It is a very small area . Again , go early or prepare to be very annoyed . There are only three restroom stalls so it gets crowded . I expected more from a spa bearing names like Waldorf, Astoria and Hilton.  I am also used to a heated, soft massage table and warm linens . Cold linens are not relaxing .  There is history here and we appreciated that. I know I'm supposed to be wowed by the architecture but it reminds me of my community college back home . The gardens were pretty . But not gorgeous. There was a fountain with brown stagnant water. Again, you're a resort.  The Paradise pool area has music and a cafe . It's lively and fun. The pool right down the path from there is more conducive to relaxing and has wait service available .  We don't plan to return as there are so many other resorts in the area to explore ."}
{"text":"Flawless check-in: Front desk staff greeted me promptly, told me my room was ready and I was given vouchers for breakfast, welcome letters from the manager, and directions with a little map on how to navigate the grounds.  I had also forgotten my phone charger at home, so I got directions to the closest Verizon store (but not before the concierge checked to see if he had an extra charger in the stash of chargers people left behind in their hotel rooms).  The common courtyard/garden is spectacular- there are tables & chairs that surround one side, fire pits at night, adirondack chairs on the edges, all overlooking a showcase water fountain, grass, palm trees & flowers.  Great landscaping!  There are also little nooks between hotel & villa/cottage buildings- I stumbled across a giant lawn chess set as I was trying to get to the parking lot one day- very cool.  Room service rides around the property on big tricycles- very cool.  When I was here, there were lots of families and older folks- there was a golf tournament & Passover event so I'm guessing those are the drivers of the weekend demographics.  Hotel room was very standard and almost a disappointment if I didn't read it already in the other Yelp reviews.  I got a good deal too so I wasn't too bummed...just know that the rooms are a little dated and don't really match the Wright style of design that dominates the exterior and the common areas.  The A/C is also very loud- I ran it during the day while I wasn't in the room and turned it off at night so I could sleep in peace.  Bed is alright- mattress is a little too springy for me, has a cushy feather bed on top and a good amount of pillows- but Westin bed it ain't.  On my last night, there was a giant and bright full moon, which I enjoyed by opening my curtains and letting the moonlight shine into my room.  There are quite a few options in different price ranges- the cottages look fun and have patios where you can sit outside...I'm guessing those cost quite a bit more.  Huge con- parking.  Valet costs $20+ a night, and Self Parking is $12...there's definitely not enough space for self parking so you're left to stalk guests who are leaving, or suck it up and park in the valet.  It's also quite a trek if you end up parking at the far end of the lot...I didn't mind since I could use the exercise, but if you have luggage or can't walk that far, be prepared to valet or be dropped off at the front entrance.    Another con that I ended up being happy about- their spa was completely booked for Spa Week and they couldn't possibly fit in another treatment, even for a paying guest like myself.  It ended up OK, b/c I spent the day at another resort and spa, which i liked even better.  I took a stroll though the spa area- it was attached to the main pool area which was very loud, and didn't seem as lush or pleasant as the spa I ended up going to.  The pool areas get very full- try checking out the multiple pools they have on property to see which best fits your style.  Cheap thin small pool towels too- you'll need at least 2 to cover your chair.  Really convenient- near Biltmore Fashion Park for shopping & restaurants, and not far from the highway and airport.    All in all, it was a nice place to stay with beautiful ground and great service- I'll probably go check out another hotel the next time I'm in town, but if I find an incredible deal to the AZ Biltmore, I wouldn't hesitate to take advantage."}
{"text":"Sprawling neo classical property that was swarming with people when we arrived on February 14 for our Valentines getaway weekend. Like many of the large Phoenix hotels, their bread and butter is the convention crowd and as we threaded our way from the tiny parking lot to our room passing through at least 3 crowded pools we passed a large outdoor space all set up for some big reception. Not quite the romantic retreat I was hoping for and to make matters worse for the past month I was convinced we were staying at the boulders (another Waldorf Astoria property-who knew there were two), and we even drove all the way up there 45 min north of Phoenix before realizing our mistake. Unlike this Waldorf with long lines and a bustling lobby full of people, the Boulders has two quiet reception desks where you sat down and were made to feel special right from the start.  This Waldorf looks like just another convention hotel with generic, slightly aging rooms and no where to plug in your electronics.  Next time I need to be much more careful on the Hilton Website !  This property features frank Lloyd wright style architecture throughout and it just wasn't working for me. There are several buildings scattered around the sprawling property with one that looks like a cross between a dormitory and a minimum security prison.  The grounds are festooned with bring flowers in contrast to the gray concrete of the structures.   As for the rooms, our king room, way back in a 4-story \"wing\" was quite large with mission style furniture and an  uninspiring sandstone color tone.  This is an older property that has gotten a face-lift but it's not hard to notice outdated aspects like the difficulty in locating an electrical outlet, the old style A/C controls and bathroom fixtures and the less than soundproofed walls.  Great for the average convention hotel but can't recommend for your romantic getaway."}
{"text":"I give this a 4 stars based on the uniqueness of the resort. It is tucked away behind some mansions and has beautiful historic grounds. This may have made my expectations sky high while staying here. The rest of the resort was okay. The rooms are older and need some renovating and the service is solid. Not a bad place, but what's inside doesn't compare to what is outside."}
{"text":"Love the property!  Centrally located and gorgeous grounds, friendly staff and I love Frank Lloyd Weight architecture.   We have stayed in the villas several times. Standard rooms once or twice. In the villas it is best to request that you stay in a renovated property in order that you get the true Waldorf Astoria experience. Older villas can be a bit disappointing, but staff is always happy to get us into a renovated room upon request.  Life happens and even when small issues come up the Biltmore staff is happy and prompt to help make the stay enjoyable. Bring your family and enjoy!"}
{"text":"The only reason this hotel got a 3 instead of a 1 or 2 star is because the lobby and hotel architecture are beautiful! Come here for dinner or drinks to check it out but don't stay here. I booked my room online and choose a builtmore suit from their website. The actual room looks nothing what so ever like the photos. Not the same floor plan not even close to the same furniture what so ever. When i asked the fount desk why i didn't get the room i booked they just blamed it on their marketing team and said they dont think they even have a room that looks like the pic. The room was large but outdated and dark. Also my first night there i saw 2 cockroaches they reluctantly switched me to a higher floor and gave me a coupon for 20% off dining. This is an iconic hotel designed by FLW so hopefully they put some thought into updating the rooms in a nicer way and fixing the incorrect pics on their site.  Update: Changed my review to a 2 star instead of 3 because while reading though the other  reviews i saw someone posted pics of the room i should have gotten (the one pictured when i booked) So that room does exist the guy at the front desk either has no idea what is going on or just fully lied."}
{"text":"I'm torn because the property is gorgeous and well-maintained, but we were not impressed by the service overall.  It's our first experience with a Hilton resort and we didn't feel like we were valued as hotel guests (and apparently being a \"diamond\" member doesn't make any difference).  And paying the premium to stay in the Ocatilla building with its lounge is debatable; they ran out of food way before they were supposed to close down the service and the breakfast was the same every morning, with pastries, cereal, hard-boiled eggs and mini-bagels (i.e., no hot food or variation aside from changing the pastries).  Some minor nits include the privacy sign for the door that flew off EVERY time you opened the door, the rather slovenly and lackadaisical girls monitoring the water slide (although I must say the pools, Jacuzzis and slide were all excellent), phone calls to front desk took extremely long time to be picked up no matter what time we called, and the toilet paper was quite rough.  However, my husband was enthralled with the size of the flatscreen TV!"}
{"text":"To be honest I have not stayed at this location as of yet. My reservation is not until June of this year. I have to say though that when I called to inquire about room I was assisted by a gentleman named Pat, and he was very professional, kind and proficient in his assistance. Once I stay at this location I will promptly yelp the amenities and the room it's self. I am looking forward to my stay. If you ever need in-house assistance, Rest assured, Pat is your man for service indeed. Thank you Pat!  : )"}
{"text":"Loved this hotel!  Stayed here three days over a marathon weekend. Very upscale, as  is expected from a Woldorf Astoria property.  We stayed in the Paradise wing.  Rooms were roomy and comfortable, but dated.  Walls between rooms were paper thin...I'll say no more about that.  It's past time for our wing to be remodeled. Also, it would have been perfect to have a coffee maker in our room. The staff is extremely accommodating and friendly.  Over the top service! Catering at our group dinners was excellent.  Food was good, staff was (again) over the top. Pools are beautiful and grounds are perfectly maintained. Getting there was no easy adventure without GPS."}
{"text":"Great place. My dad was an architect and Frank Loyd Wright was his favorite. They don't take the time to design them like this anymore. The grounds are great there is history everywhere. Every room is unique. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Pricey, but worth it.  Grounds are immaculate.   Pools are clean and not crowded.  Seems like a lot of wealthy eccentrics (dogs in strollers) and a nice absence of white trash make for a pleasant stay.  Roast some marshmallows at Frank and Alberts."}
{"text":"When they said they were a \"historical luxury resort\", I must've misinterpreted it. What they probably meant was that they used to be a luxury resort and not a luxury resort with history.  PROPERTY Lobby is beautiful with FLW-inspired architecture and the fire pits were great. It's really noticeable that the rest of the property needs to be maintained better from the chipped paint to the beat up elevators. In fact, one elevator kept taking us to the wrong floor.   ROOMS Surprisingly not the luxury it was touted to be or even the \"old school\" luxury that you'd expect. Mattress was saggy and definitely needed replacing. It was hard to adjust the thermostat. Either the room was broiling hot or freezing and the clicking noise from the air vent kept waking me up at night. Scuffed up furniture, broken wooden hangers, peeling wallpapers...this place needs to be overhauled for it to be called a luxury resort.  SERVICE With the exception of the restaurant, service met expectations. Friendly & prompt. The way it should be for a place like this.  FRANK & ALBERT Food is what you'd expect at a nice restaurant. Good food, nice wine selection, warm ambience. Our server was charming but only if she showed up. The place wasn't that busy and we noticed how long it took her to come over and take our order. She was supposed to come back with a new wine glass and we wound up dumping our water and pouring the wine into there. We wanted dessert but wound up skipping because it took too long for her to come back and get the order.  FITNESS CENTER Nice fitness center with alot of equipment to choose from. I was surprised at how small and cramped the women's locker room was. The shower looked dated (not in a good way) and the shower products they offered were of cheap quality. But the women working there were working their butts off to keep up with all the women going in and out of there.  If I'm in the area again I might stop by for drinks or meet friends for dinner. But to stay? Probably not."}
{"text":"We had a small wedding there and were very satisfied.  The planning went well, and the wedding came off beautifully."}
{"text":"Checked-in with great staff but they don't care if you're a Diamond member. I only spend a 1/3 of my life at Hilton. Just got a normal room and used all of my Hilton points. I'm not a celebrity and also shouldn't be treated like one... But would've loved at least some amenities for my loyalty."}
{"text":"You know what?  I love the Biltmore.  Yes, it's old and a little run down some might say, but I think it's fabulously old 30s glam and I adore it.  The perfectly, intricately Art Deco sculpted buildings.  The perfectly manicured grounds.  The overall vibe.  I just adore it.  The fabulous weather this time of year doesn't hurt either - when the sun is shining and you can smell orange blossoms and you know it's raining back in SF, it just doesn't get much better.  If you're there for pleasure and not work anyway.  The staff is friendly and accommodating.  They ride silly bikes.  They smile and say hello.  You get free high speed internet in your room. So why oh why does a hotel with such attention to detail fail miserably in the area of room service? Room service: where 30 minutes is 45, medium well is bloody on all but the very outside surface of your burger, the burger comes completely nude - no lettuce, tomato, nothin', your server asks if you want that stuff and that he thought it was weird it wasn't on there, heads down to pick it up for you as your uncovered burger sits out looking all expectant and embarrassed while some bird shrieks its snacky intent through the open door while eyeballing your lunch and salivating, your server comes back several minutes later with a saran wrapped plate featuring one giant lettuce leaf, a slice of red onion, a small tomato, a pickle spear and a fruit fly.  Really?  Did the person wrapping that up NOT notice the fly, drowning in pickle juice right on top of the heap as they wrapped it?  Ew.  I was really looking forward to that pickle too.  No, it's not the end of the world, but it's a lack of attention to detail which I find frustrating at \"high end\" hotels.  I wasn't the only one with a woeful room service experience so I don't think it was a fluke. The interiors (sleeping and meeting rooms and hallway) really could use some sprucing, much as I try to focus on the charm and overlook the wrinkles.  The architecture is still as amazing as ever though.  I hear they're redoing the lobby soon, but I thought the lobby was fine.  Word on the streets is that you might not want one of those rooms attached to said lobby if you're looking for a good night's sleep by the way. While our attendees had a great time and the staff was very friendly, and the grounds amazing, I don't think I would plan another meeting here.  They nickle and dimed us, did not mention that our meeting space was not wheelchair accessible (luckily it wasn't an issue this time) and they could not have put us in more inconvenient \"four corners of the earth\" type meeting space. I would definitely come back for a weekend retreat if I could find a good deal, or to get married if I suddenly came into money or a fiance, but otherwise I think it may be off the list."}
{"text":"For our last day in Phoenix, we chose to get a cabana after a half-day of work, in order to relax and drink by the pool. After some research and calls, we chose the Biltmore because the website said that pool service was available until sunset.   \"Your own private Pool Concierge and cocktail servers will be at your service from 11 am - sunset.\"  We weren't able to arrive until around 12:30 or 1ish, but planned to spend the late afternoon and early evening. We were escorted over to cabana but had to wait for 20 minutes for anyone to show up. My husband actually had to go ask for a waiter. The first guy they sent over informed us that the pool bar and cafe closed at 4pm, so service would end then. We were very surprised and disappointed at this last minute discovery.  Our waitress, Kate, then took over the food/drink service, and was very courteous and prompt. We asked for the manager to inquire about the 4pm time and inform him that the website said otherwise. He apologized and said Anthony would take care of us after 4pm by going back and worth to the hotel restaurant. Anthony was great as well. These two servers saved what might otherwise have been a wasted day. Kudos to them!  With the bar, cafe and pool slide closed at 4pm, many families and guests left in the late afternoon, which was pleasant as well since it cooled off and got quieter."}
{"text":"My daughter and I went to Spa Biltmore for her birthday. Both of us got a massage, express facial and a pedicure. The massages that we received were one of the best that both of us has ever had. I had Robert and my daughter had Sandra. Robert really listened to what I wanted from my massage. I also shared with him some problem areas that I was having. Not only did he give me an amazing massage he identified why I was having certain aches and pains. Robert showed me some stretches, that I can do on my own, to help relieve those problems. Thank you Robert! All of the staff that we encountered were top notch, professional, helpful and warm. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Dear Yelpters-I wanted to follow up my earlier comments on our experience at The Arizona Biltmore.  Senior staff members of The Biltmore reached out to me and took responsibility for the errors. More so, they indicated that the events I described will be used as a training tool for their staff in the future.  No organization is perfect and I think it's a good assumption that no-one on staff at The Biltmore gets out of bed each morning with the intent of aggravating a guest.  In this situation, the staff members who we interacted with, while believing that they were doing their jobs, simply failed to exercise common sense.    The executive staff of The Biltmore recognized this quickly, reached out to us, and have satisfied my concern that these events not be repeated for future guests.  Kudos to them for acting quickly and decisively."}
{"text":"Absolutely stunning architecture on the property. The details and history were incredible - every president since Hoover has stayed there! Just being there was relaxing since the scenery was so pretty and calming.   We stayed in one of the cottages and had our own private patio with fire pit. It was wonderful to sit out at night- very quite and cozy! I always felt like the air conditioning never was quite as cold as I would have liked, but we were only in the room to sleep and shower!  The pool was laid out so that the water slide and many of the children were at one pool and the cabanas and ample chairs were at the other end- it was great to be able to choose a quiet or lively setting at the pool. The pool servers came by quite frequently and we always had full beverages!  The workout facilities were top notch. The spa was slightly outdated looking but had all the necessary amenities. I'd recommend another spa, since there are so many to choose from in Phx/Scottsdale.   Valet was always quick to get our car or if was already waiting when we called ahead for it!"}
{"text":"I stayed here for four nights (5/14- 5/17) at the recommendation of a friend.  I guess it has been awhile since she has stayed there because it seems that the Arizona Biltmore is not what it once was.  I had a great experiance making the reservation so I had high hopes.  At check-in I was informed my room was not ready even though check-in is at four pm and I arrived about ten minutes after four pm.  The girl at the front kindly offered an \"upgrade\" although I suspect she just put me in a different room then intended because this room seemed exactly like the one described to me when I made my reservation.  I paid $369 per night but after taxes and resort fees the total really is more like $470 a night- mind you that includes the depost/fee for my dog to come along.  So anyways this is not a cheap place to stay and I didn't want to stay somewhere cheap- I wanted to stay somewhere NICE.  My husband and I were visiting our in-laws in Phoenix while on our babymoon so this was like my last chance to be somewhere and feel pampered.  I can tell you the difference between here and other five star or five diamond resorts and one is that at check-in my dog generally gets a toy.  That isn't a big deal but it's the little things.  The room was nice enough, the bed cozy and the shower nice, and it was pretty clean, but the toilet paper was HORRENDOUS.  I mean so terrible that it crumbled away in my fingertips anytime I had to go pee which is a TON because I am 7 months pregnant.  So that was pretty annoying.  Why should I leave my house to pay these prices just to downgrade basic items?  The other thing is that the toilet ran on it's own about every 3- 40 minutes.  The front desk was kind enough to send Dimitry out to try to fix it but to no avail.  Dimitry explained all the utilities are from the 1950's and parts that they once used are discontinued.  Dimitry was great- he really is!  For the last three nights we slept with both bathroom doors closed but it was still annoying.  Another nuicance was that the hotel could not provide us with a working safe.  I called and the front desk connected me to security.  Security in so many words told me \"too bad.\"  Security said parts are on order, people leave with keys, and that it could not be fixed but they would call me back later.  Security never called back so I called the front desk and told them politely that it is imperative we get a lock box for our room and that most lower-end hotels provide this.  The front desk, after calling security themselves, said that parts are on order and this is an issue in many rooms and that perhaps we could use the lockbox that their manager is in charge of.  That was nice of them but I should not have to explain to them why a lockbox is imperative to us and having one in our room.  My husband is in law enforcement and he is not going to just hand them over his gun and badge and credentials!  UM NOOOO.  This became an issue the entire stay that we couldn't let housekeeping in the room on one day or had to keep items elsewhere for our stay.  I'd like to say also that the first place I went to after my bags were delivered to my room was to the Illy Cafe.  The Asian girl was incredibly rude and so I never went back to the cafe during my stay.  I gave her $1 tip just in case I was going to go back to hopefully improve her attitude should I see her again.  First off when I walked in a light did not work, which is fine, but when she has her back turned away from the door and is on her phone or a calculator it really gives the impression that they are closed at 5pm rather then 6pm as the front desk told me.  I had to ask for her attention since she ignored me walking in and looking around.  I noticed three people who came in decided to leave while I was there by the way so obviously she is losing sales left and right because she can't even greet people.  I asked her for a half-caf and she asked rudely if that meant half-coffee.  I know this isn't Starbucks.  Actually Illy is supposed to be BETTER then Starbucks and I know this because we have a few in Vegas and they are my favorite coffee shops!  Even though this was a terrible first impression almost everyone else at the resort was very kind.  Front desk was polite and I loved Sherri at Frank & Albert's.  Sherri really knows how to take care of people and she is very sweet.  She served us breakfest twice during our stay here.  I absolutely won't be back again because it just isn't worth the money when a resort that is supposed to be the crem de la crem can't accomodate you with a lockbox or a toilet that doesn't stop running and they didn't even TRY to make up for these issues.  That is what kills me."}
{"text":"The Biltmore in Phoenix is magical, how can you possibly experience the architecture from Frank Loyd Wright? It looks Egyptian to the unassuming eye. It looks like a castle to a child's eye. The holiday cheer, Christmas joy is absolutely gorgeous. Fell in love @ the Phoenix Biltmore!"}
{"text":"Exquisite hotel experience while traveling with 2 small dogs.  Prepare to step back in time; built in 1929 this hotel exudes character, luxury and a level of panache not to be expected at this price point (during the summer months).    39 acres of spectacularly groomed gardens, lawns, pools, sitting areas and putting greens greet you at every corner.  With a 20,000 sf Spa/Fitness Center, Multiple Restaurants, Boutique shops, Market Café/coffee shop; this resort appeals to families, couples looking for romance, and/or the experienced and disseminating traveler.  Next time I will:  1.  Spend a little time picnic'ing on the magnificent lawn (star gazing) and 2.  Visit in Winter and book the Cottage with the Fire Pits."}
{"text":"in summary:  worthwhile, but NOT a 5-star hospitality experience.  in detail:  a belated birthday celebration for my mom, a huge FLW fan, i agonized over whether to book in the original rooms, or spring for the chi-chi ocatilla experience.  i went with the latter in the end, and am not convinced it was necessarily a better choice.  the 'club'/lounge was the usual for the hilton group - posh enough, varied places to sit, attentive staff, yummy choices.  it was nice, and for that, worth the upgrade.    the room and the hallways though - meh.  it felt like any old hilton just with nice historic photos on the walls and slightly-stylized furnishings.  a lot of the reviews i read mentioned the original rooms being run down - well, i would say ocatilla was no better.    right when we walked in i noticed the doorstop was actually pushed in through the drywall - classy!  the door shut and locked but in a remarkably loose manner that my mom was nervous about.  then there was the HVAC issue.  every time the air cycled on or off, it made this horrible crashing/clunking sound - literally like part of the duct was loose and making serious contact with another part of the duct.  my mom's a light sleeper so though while it was late - 11ish - and i figured they'd say there was nothing they could do about it, or move us, i rang, and the facilities guys arrived shortly thereafter.  and guess what?  yep - the shrug/'nothing we can do about it' response, and of course i couldn't get it to make the noise when they were there.  we were both so tired we managed to sleep through it.   when i mentioned it politely at checkout (i hate complaining), the lady at the desk was super cool about it and took off the resort charge and/or parking, i forget - anyway, at least there was something.  that said, it shouldn't have that many issues in a newer structure at a '5-star' resort.  a 5-star experience is, when you ring for room service, 'good evening, miss [your last name], what can i get for you?' not just 'room service; what would you like?'....which of course is better than a curt 'what?!' but again, 5-star it is not quite.     at dusk or so, we walked around the resort and through the original structure and then took a dip in the pools - THAT part was all very nice.  the grounds are impeccable.  the pools very clean and tidy.  the staff polite.  there's an amazing history room, though i don't think that's what it's called, but it was awesome - like walking into a records vault.  it's also nice that they have the historic photos up and that there's all the architecture/FLW books in the rooms - appropriate; considering the history they shouldn't do any less.    all that said, the night we were there, i think just about every single event space they had was booked - it was a hugely busy time - so in that light, in the end, we were glad to be in the 'outbuilding' that is ocatilla.   next time we'll try the original rooms, though suspending any sort of 5-star expectation."}
{"text":"The hotel has some drawbacks for sure, but we had a wonderful stay here and I would absolutely return.  As mentioned in other reviews, this hotel loves conventions and weddings and in the weekend we stayed we witnessed 2 weddings, one huge convention and multiple other meetings. But all that said I never felt crowded or that it was too busy. The property is huge and spread out amongst many buildings. This helped it feel like less of a huge convention center type hotel.   Rooms were clean but nothing special. Decor was outdated at least in the valley building but we hardly spent any time in the room so it wasn't a big deal. I found it really obnoxious that they charged $5-$10 for a bottle of water. This is arizona and its hot! But bottled water was readily avail for free around the resort and the concierge gave us a few bottles for our hike. So why the huge in room and cafe charge??   Food was delicious. We dined at frank and Alberts numerous times and at wrights and I was very happy. Service was wonderful and food was fresh.   The pool is where we felt the crowds. It was impossible to get good chairs under umbrellas but we also got out there on the later end. Big big fan of the waterside and salt pool.  The spa left a lot to be desired. The common areas and locker room were nice but minimal. My treatments were so so and not really worth it. I'm not sure I would bother again.   Overall I found it a relaxing stay for a girls weekend and its probably a great family vacation. It's not super trendy but a classic place for a little getaway."}
{"text":"The accommodations are lovely; the service terrible.   We have always loved the villa suites. Perfect for a family, they are roomy and comfortable. The kitchens are fully stocked, bathrooms are large and the bedrooms are spacious. Fairly overpriced in season, but really affordable in their off months.   The front desk seems flustered each and every time we check in. We've had varied experiences and been given a room that hadn't been cleaned; one that was already occupied; and one that did not have the bed quantity we had specified in our reservation. Frequently overbooked, they seem to be poorly managed for a high-end Hilton.   The restaurants are tasty, service typically on par, even when busy. Staff friendly and engaging, seasoned rather than the early 20 somethings at the front desk.   A beautiful historic property that needs to get its act together!"}
{"text":"I don't understand the 4-stars folks.  Yes, the outside is pretty, yes, FLW did a great job on the design.  But you can come for lunch and see all that.  There's no reason to actually stay here.  The rooms are completely falling apart.  I had to move from my first one because the a/c sounded like a jack hammer AND the toilet didn't work.   The second one's carpet was soaking wet and the toilet worked...sometimes.  But after waiting an HOUR for the bellman to bring my key for the first move (when they originally said 10-15 minutes) I just sucked it up and stayed in the second broken room so I wouldn't be late for my meeting.  Some of the food is pretty good and there are some creative options (the Ranch Stack at breakfast, the duck-fat poached fries at lunch).  But the service varied widely.  At Frank & Albert's, I had a bartender make me a to-go order who was so friendly and helpful.  The next day at brunch the waiter totally forgot about me and I couldn't get a refill and eventually had to ask someone else to bring me my check.  Plus, the room service took forever.   I also had a few spa treatments.  The massage was so good that I sought out a comment card to let her manager know.  I believe her name was Katie.  The facial was very mediocre and only lasted 38 minutes  (rather than 50 as advertised).  I wouldn't say my skin was in great condition afterward.  And the facialist was also trying to sell me some cleansing brush and products.  Not my favorite relaxing experience.    Overall, 2 stars for being pretty, the good massage, and because customer service wasn't consistently terrible.  But  I don't think I'll return next time I'm in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Could have been better.   Room was great. Food service and bartenders did a great job. What needs improvement is pick-up service via golf cart to the room. This property is huge and since we went in July and the weather was about 112 degrees walking from our room to the hotel lobby is about a 7-10 min walk. Every time we called the front desk and ask for an attendant to pick us up, they said \"we will send one, right away\" we waited up to 15 min outside every time waiting on an attendant. Communication was poor."}
{"text":"We were here with a corporate event, I can tell didn't come cheap at all. You expect a name like Waldorf Astoria, to have a reputation of polite and friendly staff, towards people who are respectful back at least.  Well, it wasn't the case here. During the week I had heard of multiple complaints about how the ballroom staff who is supposed to take care of the event was unfriendly or just didn't show up in a timely manner to offer their assistance. I thought maybe some people are a bit more demanding than others.  Until I had my own encounter with the 'friendliness' of the ballroom staff. A hotel staff member called Alfred replied to a request I made during our break down, with an attitude like no other. Rude at least, like he didn't care what I had to say about the mistake They made. I was not impressed to say the least, considering I didn't address him with a tone of voice. But I sure got a reply with major attitude.  Anyways, this put a real negative feel on the whole thing.  The Hotel building is nice as are the rooms.  The hotel staff I met outside of the ballroom area was very nice and always helpful"}
{"text":"I admit that this is a nice hotel.  The gardens are impeccable and serene.  But the service is an embarrassment to a hotel of this caliber.  The employees are supercilious, and this attitude also runs throughout management.  In short, the employees make this gorgeous hotel an unpleasant place to stay.  The Ritz Carlton has dated decor, but has much better service."}
{"text":"Generally I feel this place is over rated.  Service is very lacking.  (I actually unloaded my car myself while 4 bellmen stood in shade 10 feet from me at the main entrance at check in).  Some area of the property need updating.  My room was \"OK\" but would like to see others.  Seemed over priced even during the off season.  The deck off my room was filthy with bird droppings, basically unusable.  Pools were nice but not clean. Rarely saw pool attendants. Pool towels available only at the main pool, with eight pools on property this seemed weird. Last day there I was asked to switch rooms as they had reserved my room for another quest.  Sorry not my problem, I had been there for a week!  Interestingly some people seemed to have bashed the spa here, I didn't think it was that bad., I would give it 4 stars.    The high end restaurant in the place (can't remember name) is good but VERY pricey and with strange decor (I understand that is subjective, some people are really into the Frank Loyd look).  Anyhow, stayed a week and wouldn't return, too many option in this area at these prices."}
{"text":"No AC on 112 degrees day = Minus points big time Free Cigars by the fountain outside = Plus mad points (Free as in On the House, not like i stole them or someone hooked me up.) Super clean bathroom and overall coolness = Plus points  Final score = Plus points wins.  Take it as you wish."}
{"text":"A great place to pose with friends. I've been for a number of events to this venue and each time, I have to respect the great service and detail that they deliver.  Whether it is for a Hispanic celebration or a Valley Leadership event, or charitable function, this venue pulls it all off without a hitch."}
{"text":"Best hotel in all of Arizona! Always amazing customer service. We checked in today for my wife's birthday... they send us a bottle of champagne on ice and chocolates. We love it here and we will always come back!"}
{"text":"I love this place. I've reviewed for the Spa but I finally stayed at the hotel last weekend. Don't you just love cheap summer rates?  Our room was enormous and the bed was insanely comfortable.  We slept til 11 each day because they were so amazingly comfortable and the room was a batcave with it's darkness.  Wow.    Love the Salvatore Ferragamo toiletries; nice touch.    The sprinkling of chairs to sit around the property and such were nice as well.    The resort fee, like most, is bogus.  Um, I didn't use the putt putt or the large on ground chess game, can I get my $28 a day back?  Come on now.    The pools here are wonderful and we were excited to learn about the fact that they show movies at the main pool on weekends. We got to float and watch Toy STory and Toy Story 2!   The dings here for the the nonsense resort fee and the fac tthat the pool bathrooms are disgusting. It's shocking how bad the bathroom is at the main pool.  In all though this is one of my favorite properties."}
{"text":"We are Hilton Honors members and try to go to all Hilton properties.  We were really excited to be going to the Biltmore, as our previous trip here had been great.  This time, however, the check in desk was backed up and took us 30 minutes to check in.  We finally found our room - which was quite a feat and then the key didn't work.  30 minutes later we got that taken care of.  Then we went to the pool.  We were disappointed that the slide wasn't working and the pool cafe was closed.  Then we decided to get some ice and lo and behold, there is no ice.  Our room is moldy and being allergic to mold, I'm hoping I can sleep o.k.  This place is under construction and a remodel, which I understand, but they could make it a little better experience.  The only guy that was really helpful was the engineer, whom we ran in to while wandering around looking for our room."}
{"text":"What a great place to be for a work conference. I was just at the AZ Biltmore for a 4 day conference. I have a 5 month old son, so my husband and son came with me. We  were pleasantly surprised by the atmosphere, amenities, and architecture. I didn't do much research into where we were staying before we got there, so I was really excited when we pulled up. Our room was in one of the cottages, perfectly located, close to the lobby and restaurants, and not far from the ballrooms and conference meeting rooms.  The only drawback was the price of food. Sodas were $4, a cup of coffee was nearly $5, and a hamburger $15. The conference provided most our meals, so this wasn't a big deal for us, but if I were there on vacation, I might have been a little peeved. Definitely BYO snack and drinks. The staff was incredibly friendly and accommodating. We wished we could have stayed longer and just enjoyed the amazingly peaceful setting.  We'll be back for an AZ vacay when my son is old enough to enjoy the waterslide."}
{"text":"Vivid, grand, and oh- so- lovely. You can literally spend half the day just perusing the property and sitting at every possible seating area. It's that scenic.  So much detail and so much open space... I also love the elite, carefree vibe that the crowd gives off.  There are a lot of privileged families and businessfolk that stay here, so most people are left alone to do as they wish.  ...Roast marshmallows, splash a beachball around in the pool, drink wine by the fire, or be on a laptop while watching the sun set...  There's a strong sense of freedom and enjoyment that runs throughout the hotel. You can visit for yourself and see what I mean, but please, be respectful and keep the Biltmore tasteful. This place is a dream."}
{"text":"I had a wonderful experience.It is a beautiful property and the staff are wonderfully competent and professional. I was there on 8/14/15, when it was 115 degrees. Everyone from the front desk (Brianna) to the cleaning staff made sure you were staying hydrated and they even extended pool hours. I can't say enough great things about this place. I only wish I could spend more than 1 night. Definitely a place to unwind."}
{"text":"Its frustrating that a place that prides itself on customer service can't figure out how to charge a room stay. We stayed here for one night and had an all inclusive package that included breakfast, lunch and dinner. At checkout we found out that we were supposed to be given vouchers for these meals. So we were charged for the meals that were supposed to be inclusive. We were then told that these charges would be taken off and all would be fixed. A few days later and we are still being overcharged. I've called multiple times and have yet to get a call back to receive this issue. I keep getting transferred and hung out to dry for someone else to resolve a problem they should have fixed already. Never staying here again. The level of incompetence is astounding."}
{"text":"This is hands down probably the worst experience I have had at a hotel at the Waldorf-Astoria caliber (I used to live at the Ritz Carlton in PR, I'm an architect, and a FLW enthusiast)   While visiting Scottsdale, I decided to go to dinner there tonight at the most expensive restaurant at the hotel, Wright's. To start off the horrible experience, I had to find parking. I was directed (and I use that word very loosely) to self park in a parking garage in about the farthest location away from the hotel lobby possible, back behind the two giant convention centers and behind the service entrances where cart loads of supplies are hulled across the streets to access the parking garage, and was nearly impossible to find. The parking garage is about a 30 minute walk to the hotel (and it's the only place you are allowed to park outside of valet), and when going to a fancy dinner, dressed up and wearing dress shoes and high heels, is a nightmare walk. I should have called an Uber to the lobby. My mother had to stop and sit down about 4 times on the walk over because she couldn't make it the whole way. And we had to walk through two events going on, looking like two weddings. Then to avoid it, we had to walk in the street the rest of the way with no sidewalks and the sides of the streets were lined with cars, so we had to walk in the middle of the road, dodging cars in the dark. Absolutely ridiculous!   Once finally arriving at the lobby, this old historic hotel from the 1920s has been remodeled inside to look like a brand new Hilton hotel, apparently just a year or two ago. Funky Vegas style contemporary furnishings mashing up with old Frank Lloyd Wright style architecture, looking like they are trying to subdue the original character of the hotel as much as possible so it doesn't look 'old' (which is the whole point of it). Flat screen TVs have been mounted onto the lobby walls, drilling huge holes into the lobby's original concrete blocks to mount them, doing permanent damage to the historic structure. New imitation wood flooring covers the lobby, looking like a contemporary tract home inside. The bar has now expanded to fill pretty much the entire original lobby, cluttered and crowded with awful furnishings, it was not an enjoyable relaxing space for a drink.   The restaurant is also newly furnished in loud blond wood furnishings (the hotel was originally done in a dark walnut color wood) with contemporary furnishings looking like every other basic modern hotel restaurant. While the service at the restaurant and food was good, the unique style and ambiance I was paying the big money for was totally g.   Sadly the beautiful historic charm of this famous hotel has been completely lost, and they have done just about everything possible to erase the history of the hotel and turn it into something new and contemporary. It looks like every other boring modern hotel out there.   I was absolutely heart broken to see what they had turned this hotel into. It is over built with too many new hotel room wings, and the original hotel lobby can CLEARLY not support the over building they have done to it. While I thought this hotel was one of the most beautiful and historic hotels in the world, they have ruined it. I will never return to this hotel again. Shame on you Waldorf Astoria, you have no expertise and no care or concern for historic architecture. So sad.      Thanks for your response Sheila, however I asked two attendants 'directing traffic' where parking was for the restaurant Wright's, and they both told me the parking garage. I asked twice because I didn't believe it the first time since the lobby building was nothing but a faint glimmer off in the distance. When I booked the reservation over the phone for dinner, they did not mention that parking was through valet (although they asked if it was a special occasion). How are people supposed to know to go to valet for the restaurant if you don't tell them that? Maybe when they book dinner at the restaurant say \"and valet is free at the restaurant until 9pm\". But if it's only free until 9, after that you have to either pay for valet parking or walk the 5 miles to the garage? Isn't the restaurant open until midnight? This is not being hospitable, this is being cheap, and inconveniencing your guests."}
{"text":"My stay started off very well. The front desk was very helpful. My room was not ready so she upgraded me to a much larger and nicer room. The problem is that the room probably is considered to be in another county. It was quite a walk. We went in Frank and Alberts for lunch. This was an odd experience. Four of us had meals with very small portions, and the other two meals were way too big of portions. The grilled cheese is an embarrassment to food, period. It is also a bit pricey for what you get.   The room is nice but slightly dated. It had a 90's feel to it. This is OK in most hotels, but in a place like the Biltmore you can not let your rooms get that far behind. My room was huge. I had a full kitchen and living room area.   There are several pools through out the property. The pool by my room was great because it was in a low traffic area. I was able to swim in peace any time of day.   Parking can be a pain. I would recommend using the valet, but if your room is where mine was you have to walk over a 1/4 mile to get to the valet.   There were some renovation taking place, so hopefully that will update the overall look of the rooms. The area as a whole is nice. There are some very good views."}
{"text":"Awesome off season hotel.  This Historical hotel is one of my favorite in the US.  it compares with the HGV in Carlsbad, CA, The Hilton in Waikiki and the Waldorf in Rome.  (disclaimer, if I ever win the lottery I will be living at the WA in Rome for at least 30 days.... yes, it is that good)!  This hotel is big, expensive, but very accommodating to the guests.  I have been here several times and each time it get's better and better.  Rooms are clean and well above other hotels in the area, the staff (all departments) are awesome and the restaurants they have on property are all worth a try."}
{"text":"My husband had a customer to attend to in Phoenix, and it just worked out that my daughter and I could tag along for the weekend to enjoy the sun.  We used to live in Phoenix, and in the area of the Biltmore, so it was very special to be \"home\" for a few days and visit our old haunts and friends.  We have seen the Biltmore during the tough times of the recession, and so was VERY happy to see the area going strong!   Even the community around the Biltmore is thriving- new building, refurbishments, etc... it was absolutely fantastic to see. We were in the Terrace building in a suite, so we had a separate King bedroom with a living room.  Our daughter stayed on the pull out couch and was quite happy.  We had two patios, one with a 4 seat dining table and one with four lounger chairs- perfect views of the court yard (check out my photos).  The room was beautifully upgraded in tones of Gray/Greens that were super soothing.  The bed was out of this world comfortable (I was counting sheets so I can re-build this at home..lol);  great master bath with a soaker tub and big shower, double sinks and a makeup counter/mirror.   We had a second  1/2 bath that made it so nice traveling with a teenager      Katie and Cherish- personal concierge's at the hotel took AMAZING care of us.  Make sure you introduce yourself! We were given access to the Ocatilla exec lounge as I am a Diamond Honors member and am very impressed by the offering.  We had breakfast there several times (continental), and iced tea and cold water/snacks are available thru-out the day.  They do offer snacks in the early evening but we were SO busy, we didn't quite make it back for that;  however, we did enjoy wine/happy hour past 8 pm each evening which we loved.  There is a separate fire pit off the patio, so you can enjoy the cool AZ nites with your wine   They brought in the most amazing desserts at this time as well- again, see my photos. My daughter and I visited two of the pools on different days;  if you want quiet comfort- then go for the Ocatilla pool;  if you want great current music, dancing, and food/drink services, hit up the main pool- very lively.  My daughter is 13 and she loved BOTH experiences.  You just cannot beat the Arizona sun in February.   We had a turkey wrap and drinks and arrived in about five mins time.  Great service for a busy pool day. My husband and I did \"full\" breakfast at Frank and Albert's one morning;  and Adobe grill another.  We have great memories at both of these locations and simply could not resist a visit.  Frank and Albert's has been expanded it appears and the ambiance is wonderful.  Fireplaces and firepits scattered around to keep you warm, and the service was friendly and efficient.   Adobe grill holds a special place in our memories as we visited almost every Saturday when we lived in Arizona-  the menu and the restaurant has been VERY nicely redone and you cannot improve these views.  Food was wonderful- try the Big AZ Burrito with chorizo.  Fantastic. Your evenings absolutely have to be spent outdoors around the courtyard 'somewhere'... whether that's on the Ocatilla patio, or by the main building fire pits- it's the perfect Arizona evening.  Grab a glass of wine from the bar and sit under those stars. Also, if you want a local spot to visit (where only the locals go) check out Rokerij on 16th street and order the Chicken Chimayo-  you won't be disappointed. I'm so sad to be leaving...  until next time..."}
{"text":"Just spent three nights at the Biltmore and can't wait to go back! We were checked in by Assistant Manager Jonathon and taken care of by the manager and they were awesome. What a class act. The grounds are magnificent, the rooms are quite spacious and we felt like it was a great family hotel. All needs were met. From the valet service to the poolside servers you can't go wrong with the Biltmore. I personally want to thank 99 percent of the staff for making it an outstanding example of Arizona hospitality. Although it was quite toasty we had a blast.  A few suggestions...  Any meals you eat are great. Prices are quite reasonable. If you eat at the pool or room service expect a 40.00 tab. The buffet in the morning is quite good and expect 20.00 per head. If you can swing it go valet, we parked in the structure and it was a bit of a walk but all out luggage has wheels so not an issue. Take the shuttle to the local shopping center and enjoy the local eateries. We ate at the burger restaurant and it was awesome. Can't wait to get back."}
{"text":"This place has a magnificent and upscale property. Lush gardens and greenery. The staff are always smiling and saying hello.   Our room was a King suite in the Valley wing and walking distance to the pool just off our small porch.   It was a good size room but I felt the bathroom could have been more grand.   The bedding and robes were very nice but we had to request our robes as they forgot to leave us any...no big deal.   I would have rated this a 5 star but the walls are so thin. We could hear everything going on next to us. The TV next door and even the toilet lid slamming down. It was too much.   We originally booked a cottage and \"upgraded\" but I think we should have stuck to the cottage so we had less common walls and reduced noise.   That was the only disappointing factor.   This made sleep difficult if you wanted to sleep past 7am.   There are a few shops on property and they are adorable. You're under a mile from the Biltmore shops on 24th and I actually walked there because the weather was great.   We dined at Frank&Albert's and it was good.   I got a breakfast wrap from the cafe in the morning and didn't realize it would just be a reheated deal. They did have a great selection of deserts and gelato which was impressive. (Talenti brand)  We may Stay again but would think twice about that room style.  The lobby was so relaxing and inviting we spent time here having drinks.   The outside areas were beautiful and there were fire pits everywhere to enjoy."}
{"text":"The grounds are so amazing at this resort. With Architecture by Frank Lloyd Wright you can't help but love it here. At one stay my friends and I visited every pool on the property...there are seven. The Biltmore is an amazing piece of history for Phoenix, and it makes a memorable stay for any out of towner or Phoenicians.  Most amazing architecture on Villas I have seen anywhere."}
{"text":"We come here to hang at the bar some nights for a drink. This resort is so beautiful and unique that its always fun (but a bit expensive) to come and sit by the fire pits or walk around the lobby and look at the old pictures.  We have been here for brunch before as well and that was delicious! One day I hope I can do a stay-cation here and get the full effect because we love to ride our bikes and hang out on the grounds!"}
{"text":"Went there recently for the 2 pm seating for tea. Kevin Michael Doyle was our waiter and he was great with this presentation etc, but he was the only waiter 12 plus tables!!  He had one lady helping him which was not enough at all.  You could tell everyone was highly annoyed by the length of time everything was taking.  The entire tea experience took 2 hours 45 min and that was with us asking for our check ASAP to speed things along.  Our tea was also not poured for us once by the staff; which is usually done at least once during tea.  The food was ok--first course did have some good sandwiches but the ones with bread were totally dry.  The warm scones were good but took 40 min to get to us and that was asking the waiter twice for them. The chocolate pound cake which was totally \"talked up\" was fair (dry with not a lot of flavor).  We really do enjoy going to tea but this is not the first time we have gone there and had a bad experience.  It is pretty expensive at $36-46 per person which I would not mind paying if it was actually worth the money!  Will be checking out the Ritz or the Phoenician next time."}
{"text":"**Hotel room had a faulty Iron, destroyed my shirt, and they did not refund me or do anything about except replace my iron with a working one.  Worst customer care of all time"}
{"text":"We had the pleasure of spending a few days here - a welcome break from this winter's brutal weather in the Northeast.  The property is expansive - 29 acres - including everything -- golf courses (2), pools (8), meeting halls (3), restaurants (2 - one casual one fine dining) a deli and winding paths snaking their way among the residence options. Want a ground floor suite with a patio fire pit - they have it ready for you.   The resort offers homes, condos, hotel rooms, suites and bungalows. Any shape or size your heart desires. Just outside is a well kept walking/running/biking trail running along both sides of the canal that meanders through the city.  Wrigley Museum (yup, gum) is literally across the street. Shopping and the rest of Phoenix are a short Lyft or Uber ride away.  We were upgraded to a slightly larger room with a small balcony - courtesy of Hilton Honors as this is a Hilton property. Our room was spacious, clean and updated. The obligatory overpriced minibar included. The balcony was not private as it runs the length of the building and the view was cooling towers, parking lot and tennis, so check your location on the map at check-in!   We found the staff friendly and helpful, with knowledgable, and capable restaurant staff.    The manicured grounds kept in pristine condition, seating options abound. One of the big draws is the monstrous great lawn and patio, dotted with benches, tables, fire pits, rocking chairs, fountains, ponds, fruit trees..   Yes we had a great stay and enjoyed all of the above. Looks very child friendly too.   Why not 5 stars? Bird control seems a bit of an issue, especially at Frank & Alberts, the casual restaurant. The pools are overcrowded...expect chaise wars. The \"spa\" is priced at the high end of luxurious spas, but the locker rooms were second rate. Spa staff was in la-la land. Seating consists of 8 chaises outside in a  \"busy\" courtyard, adjacent to the noisy pool (with live band).   In summary, a very nice family resort, and relaxing venue."}
{"text":"Truly an amazing property. The grounds are immaculate and the staff is so professional and nice. Did not have one problem while I stayed there. The food and drink were incredible also. Perfect resort!!!"}
{"text":"We went to The Biltmore to watch fireworks this year.... BAD Idea!! We've lived here for many many years.... even got married at The Biltmore! For a world class resort they should be ashamed and embarrased.  Their fireworks display was ridiculous and just stupid.  A total waste of time & energy.  We couldn't figure out why they even called it a 'Firework Show' because all it was, was 10 minutes of someone shooting up 2 different bottle rockets (same thing over & over again) and some loud music to go with the 'bottle rocket show'.  Absolutely horrendous! VERY disappointed with The Biltmore!! Unfortunately we had a bad dinner to boot just before that at Frank & Alberts (located inside resort).  Needless to say we won't be going back any time soon."}
{"text":"For an old hotel this is a beautiful one. Our rooms were amazing and the beds were top notch.  The swimming pools were incredible with a nice 92' slide for the kids.. and adults.  Yes, i went once.  Frank & Alberts is here and has some of the best food Ive eaten in the valley.  So that alone gets the stars up.  My only beef was that because this is an old hotel, there lacks a few things. When you go into your rooms, the hallways are incredibly hot.  You'll break a sweat with no problem in the elevators too.  Also the elevator near our room was broken the entire weekend, so we had to walk a good distance to go to our room (waaahh.. yeah yeah).  I still gave this three stars because it's a good place for us when we did Hell City this past weekend."}
{"text":"This once was the premier property in the Phoenix area. While still very nice, it has lost a bit of its luster. They do, however, appear to be refurbishing some of the accommodations. Except for one snooty front desk clerk at check in, virtually every staff member we met was as friendly, courteous and helpful as they could be. And we met a lot of them over our three night stay where we never left the property in search of a relaxing R&R.  Things got off to a rather rough start when we were shoehorned into one of the smallest rooms on the property. Supposedly \"upgraded\" to the newly refurbished Paradise Wing with a \"balcony and pool view\", due to our having achieved the highest level of the Hilton chain customer loyalty program, this \"upgrade\" was anything but. The three foot wide balcony was shared lengthwise with several other rooms, requiring us to close the curtains for privacy. The pool view was there if you leaned way over the balcony and looked far, far to your right where you could see something that looked like water. The W/C was very interesting with a toilet barely at the 14 inch minimum height off of the floor, if it was indeed that tall. We literally had to \"visit\" restrooms in other public areas of the property. On the positive side, we only had to call maintenance (very nice maintenance man) once to fix the slow drainage in our sinks. We spent two very enjoyable days lounging by the pool, utilizing one of their cabanas. We highly recommend this practice. Though a bit pricey, it's worth it. When not in the pool or sunning nearby we could keep up with the basketball games on the HD TV in the cabana. Plus, each cabana has their own restroom (see issue above). The poolside staff was just as nice and accommodating as they could possibly be. We spent some time at the bar prior to dining each night and even ate at the bar one night. Again, outstanding service. In case you are wondering, when we complained directly to the General Manager of the hotel (she did not bother to respond directly) the first afternoon, the next day a very nice representative offered to move us to another room (the property had plenty of nice rooms available for upgrades). As we had already unpacked and had decided we were going to be by the pool most of the stay anyway, we elected not to move. They instead waived the fee for the cabana for one of the days. Had the \"less than friendly\" front desk clerk we encountered when we check in had bothered to see if there was something she could do in the form of a \"real\" upgrade at the time we checked in, the stay would have been much more pleasant."}
{"text":"I have never stayed at the Biltmore but I recently went here for a conference (1 day only) and I was blown away by how beautiful it was.  The grounds are meticulously kept a brilliant green and the gorgeous flower beds made my heart smile just walking around.  I loved the architecture of the buildings (even though I am not a FLW fan).  The stonework and also the outdoor statuary gave the place a very Native Latin American feeling without that cheesy \"southwest\" decor.  Even the lobby was gorgeous... the restaurants and bar had such a classy feel to them.  I was surprised by how many pools this place has, each with a different vibe to it.  You could go to a different one every day depending on your mood.  Between those and the shops, restaurants, outdoor games, and golf courses it seems like this is truly a place you could just stay at without leaving for the entire trip.  I hope someday, I will. ;0)"}
{"text":"Housekeeping - they are wonderful. Cleaned my room every night and made my bed. What really made them stand out was that they put my aligned my shoes nicely and even placed a jogging map next to my running shoes.   Hotel - I stayed in the main hotel building so it was quite older than the remodeled rooms outside. I got a noisy part of the hotel where I could hear the employees working and dumping stuff. I was disappointed in the bathroom. I couldn't sit on the toilet and really close the door. The door would always snag on the rug too. The tub actually leaked on the floor I noticed.  Restaurants - I've only been to Frank&Alberts because everything else was catered. The service at Frank's was great though!  Service was quite good overall at the hotel. My company did a lot of catering and had our conference there so they were always fast to take away dishes and empty glasses.  Gym - this is important for the people who really do weights. There is a bench bar with an actual bar. This stoked me beyond belief so I was able to do my lifts, both benching and deadlifts at the gym! I had some coworkers actually lift the bar for me to squat too! The only downside is that it gets super hot inside as there is no where for the air to go :(  Pools/hot-tub - great! They are open 24/7 and there are different ones around the resort. There is a heated pool as well as a salt water pool too! If you have a chance, hit up the slide! It is also heated :)"}
{"text":"The rooms are old, conventional and totally ordinary, but the entire resort (i should say compound, this place is huge) is beautiful.  I would stay here again as long as the rooms cost less then $200."}
{"text":"Susan was my bar tender and she is absolutely a living doll. Bought a cigar and had some ice cold beer on tap. I got here just as the kitchen closed so I will have to come back and check that out."}
{"text":"Don't fret if anybody walks into the lobby with a shoulder holster and weapon. It's totally cool here, and it goes fashionably with a nine iron.  I do like this place, but I don't love this place.  I like the history of this hotel, and find the aesthetics and the architecture appealing.  They maintain the grounds well.  Croquet anybody?  I appreciate the fact that they take the history of this hotel into account when updating and remodeling.  I've had nothing but good experiences with the customer service.  I love the box of chocolates you get in your room.  French Press coffee for the win!  The rooms are well appointed, and I do love the large showers.  There are several pools to choose from.  There are nice, but overpriced, restaurants and bars.  Is it just me who has trouble with the layout? I do nothing but walk around in circles trying to get to my car.  They have the two parking areas, and neither is very convenient to the rooms I have stayed in.  I sometimes have to attend to my accounts for night shift work, and wandering around a deserted property at midnight is not super awesome.  And they won't let you use the parking lot right by the entrance unless you valet.  Boo! I don't know, there really isn't anything I don't like about this place...I mean, it's nice...but nothing really differentiates The Biltmore from other Hilton Resorts in Phoenix, other than the history and because \"Waiting to Exhale\" was filmed here.  Maybe my expectations are too high or I need to stay in a villa."}
{"text":"To start with this a hotel is located in the center of a HUGE resort.  On arrival the hotel is the definition of luxury.  The lobby is beautiful and surrounded by people there to assist you.  The front desk was somewhat of a disappointment.  The gentleman that checked me in, really didn't tell me anything more than my room number.  I asked about a view, and he told me I have a garden view, which meant I was staring at another building.  Once I got to the room, the amenities and layout was phenominal.  There was a 55\" TV integrated in the wall and the bed was AMAZING.  It was incredibly soft, but at the same time supportive.  Truly laying in the bed was like sleeping in a bed of feathers.  The bathroom was also very nice, with a huge walk in shower and granite sink.  The other amenities of the resort including the multiple pools, tennis courts, golf course, and restaurants could truly keep someone busy for a whole week.  I was attending a conference there and I have to say every meal was spectacular.  Everything from the breakfast burrito with churrizo to the fresh burgers and hot dogs for lunch.  Even the steak dinner for the reception was perfectly cooked for the 200 people that were there.  Overall, an excellent resort, although make sure you get a renovated room and ask for a room with a view.  Can't wait to go back again with the family."}
{"text":"Spent a little time here the week of July 4. I found it to be a very smooth and pleasant experience overall. I requested a room with a mountain view and got one in the main building with an amazing vista over the back lawn towards Piestawa Peak. I could have stared at it for hours. The room itself was compact but not oppressively so. It was a little tight where the corners of the desk, bed and ottoman came together, so watch your shins there if you have a main building room. The bed was super comfortable and the Frank Lloyd Wright influence of the design carries over to the room, especially in the headboard and lamps. The bathroom is pretty plain, like something at a Marriott convention hotel. My only real complaint about the rooms is that they really could use a little more attention to the dusting, especially on the clock radio and picture frame surfaces. Bathroom was spotless, though.   The lobby is very soothing architecturally and really defines a sense of something special. There are vintage photos of the hotel spread throughout the rooms and public areas, so you get a real sense of the history of this place. The two main restaurants, Frank & Albert's and Wright, are at the end of the lobby, with Wright's lounge occupying a large block of space just outside Wright's restaurant. F&A's had a nice happy hour, with a few appetizers and drink specials at a good rate. The pulled barbecued pork taco was yummy.   The grounds are gorgeous desert landscaping, with FLW's sprite statues punctuating the plantings. The main pool was a little meh to me, so I chose to hang out at the quieter Catalina Pool, where Marilyn Monroe swam and which is lined with Catalina tiles. It had fewer people, but a few noisy pre-teens who were splashing about. So keep in mind, it's billed as a \"quiet pool\", not an \"adults-only pool\".   Service throughout was gracious and very efficient. I was able to check in at 10:30 am and an early check-in will always make me very pleased. Also, the A/C was set to 68 degrees when I went in my room. Usually, they turn it up higher and you have to cool it down. Prices in the convenience store were high even by resort standards ($3 for a can of Diet Coke?) and the TV channel selection was limited (no HGTV?! Barbarous!). But overall, I'd go back and maybe try out one of the casita lodgings."}
{"text":"So I will say this is definitely a 3 star hotel in every sense of the word. I will preface to say I love Frank Lloyd wright architecture, having been to several of his houses. The design of this resort is really beautiful. The exterior of the resort and the main buildings are lovely. I had high hopes before I got to my cottage. My hopes were dashed severely. The room smelled musty, the carpets were stained and it was generally outdated. I shrugged off my concerns and hoped the restaurant made up for this particular disappointment. It didn't. The food was mediocre at best but ridiculously expensive for what it was. The little coffee cafe had good coffee but I unfortunately got curdled milk during one purchase. Walking through the dimly light courtyard one night I was literally chased by cockroaches. This happened more than once. The upstairs cottages had a little patio which was unswept and missing chairs. Having stayed at other resorts, this one definitely missed the mark on luxury. I appreciate the staff more than anything. They were extremely helpful and courteous during our stay. I would skip this resort next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Stayed at the biltmore for a national work conference for a few days. I was so impressed with the accommodations, the service, and our stay overall. They were hosting at least three other conferences during our stay and somehow managed to keep everything perfectly organized and set up for us each day. And the food! We ate every meal here being that it was a work conference and the food was so well prepared every single meal and the variety was really great. There was always something for everybody. I have only great things to say about the biltmore and would love to stay here again for a little vacation!"}
{"text":"Conference food is horrible. Rubber chicken every time. The service is good but for the price I wish they would serve a nice fresh meal instead of covering rubber chicken up with heavy sauces."}
{"text":"Bugs - bugs. They don't tell you expect to get bitten. They do have anti-itch cream for the welts you get.  Bugged - Housekeeping sucks. No, no vacuums. No clean room. Even though I received $100 credit, Arizona Biltmore isn't as upscale. We hadn't had our room cleaned and it was after 3:30. I like walking into a clean fresh place. Don't stay if you expect turnt up service clean towels fresh soap. Would I return? No to the Hell no. Was I adequately COMP'd for being overlooked? NO! I was fortunate enough to be billed for at least 4 days of Valet or self park. Our stay was 2 days.  This had to be a missing episode of the Twilight Zone. It is Marathon Weekend. ENOUGH SAID  My wife reminded me that the elevator had an out of order sign and it was working. All weekend it was hit or miss on elevator. Thank God no handicapped people in my crowd.  The real straw breaker - I get a generic apology from a real person? Not robot.  I could stay pissed but no one willing to reach out. Chiggers CHIGGERS- GOOGLE dat. Small bugs related to spiders"}
{"text":"The Biltmore resort is overpriced, outdated, and dirty.  I was here for training.  My room had what appeared to be blood stains on the floor  and the shower had mildew growing on tile.  The food at Frank and Alberta was overpriced and disgusting.  You pay $11.55 for nachos covered in cheese whiz and something they called beef.  Their $15 burger had less flavor than a burger at a food chain restaurant.  I would never recommend this resort unless you are forced for work."}
{"text":"I love the Biltmore.  It's architecture, intimate feeling though large and friendliness of staff.  It is not pretentious, but very nice.  Great for a week on your own or with family.  Beyond golf, tennis, hiking and biking it is a great location with access to many things, restaurants that you can walk to and stay fit!    Suggestions would be to update its spa facilities and please add healthy options to all of its menus.  Whole wheat pastas, whole grain breads, tofu and more vegetarian options other than fatty options would be great!  Hilton may also want to educate the room service staff as to what Grass Fed Beef is, as the woman tonight told me she would have no idea what the beef ate- ha!ha!  I am not kidding.  These are things that can easily be taught, an updated menu might help the employees health too!"}
{"text":"We booked an overnight \"Staycation\" to celebrate our wedding Anniversary. We normally staycation at another hotel which was booked. This was our first time at the Arizona Biltmore. We didn't realize how huge the grounds were and they were. Check in was easy, we were graciously upgraded from a standard room to a 3rd floor suite which was very clean, updated and beautiful. I couldn't ask for more: the suite was beautiful, the bed was clean and comfy, there were plenty of outlets to recharge our phones. There was a mini refrigerator along with a Keurig coffee machine. The bathroom/shower amenities down to the Salvatore Ferragamo products were wonderful. The only complaint I would have to bring up is the self parking or rather the lack of spaces for self parking.  We will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"My wife and i stayed there for our anniversary and had a great time.  little dissappointed in the cottage we stayed in.  i know the place is old but you have to update and remodel every once in awhile (century).  I want to give 4 stars but i also think that the price was a little steep for a summer rate.  Now, i know that i should expect to pay alot for the biltmore but i am not the ritzy type of person.  I am sure my wife would give it 5 stars."}
{"text":"This is suppose to be a grand hotel, in the book \"1000 Places to visit Before You Die\"... I was intrigued by the history and, yes, it has cool architecture... but why does the restrooms in the public areas dispense that cheap pink liquid soap, reminiscent of Sweetheart dishwashing soap from the 80's???  Eeew... not Posh."}
{"text":"Beautiful hotel/resort in Phoenix. Located near excellent hiking spots, my husband and I absolutely love staying here. I am writing this after my third time staying at this resort...that's how much I love it! The first two times, I stayed in the \"regular\" King bedrooms. All the rooms are quite nice, but this time, I upgraded to the Ocatilla rooms. The Ocatilla is a separate block of rooms in the resort with an all inclusive feel. For a slightly upgraded rate (tip, go in the summer like we did and the upgraded rate was only $161 per night for a gorgeous room in Ocatilla) you get complimentary breakfast, snacks all day, coffee/tea/lemonade/soda/water bottles all day, happy hour food (cheese, crackers, fruit etc), and complimentary beer and wine from 5-9pm! Much better deal than the overpriced food at the other restaurants at the resort.  Only reason for 4 stars is the service. Although the concierge at the Ocatilla was wonderful, we sat out at both the private Ocatilla pool and main pool and had service issues. At the Ocatilla pool, we never saw one person there to take a food/drink order (even though menus were sitting out) and the main pool had service that was very slow (even though the resort was almost empty). Oh well.   The pools are great (although a little hot) and ask maintained. Lots of tennis courts, golf courses, and walking trials. We will keep coming back for years!"}
{"text":"I was really excited to have an opportunity to spend some time in this historic hotel and I mean the original hotel vs one of the newer buildings. When I walked the halls, surrounded by the cement brick construction and arts and crafts meets the Southwest decor, I could helped but wish I could have seen this grand old lady in her hay day.  The rooms are appointed with REAL Stickley furniture, it doesn't get much cooler than that for me! The bed was extremely comfortable. So comfortable, in fact,  that I woke up in the morning with the lights on and the tv blaring. A sign of a true good night's sleep in my books...  And the rate? Wow! $95 bucks. Of course, it was three million degrees outside but what do you expect? It's Arizona!"}
{"text":"Just wow. Stopped in for a pre-dinner drink and ended up staying for dinner.  The lobby is jaw dropping as are the grounds. It was a little too cold for us to sit outside in November but we wandered around the lobby before settling in for a martini.  Cocktail onions were good and crunchy.   Never had the chance/need to stay here but would recommend that you pop in if you're in the area.   Contrary to popular belief, Frank Lloyd wright didn't design the hotel and is not the architect of record, but he did consult on the project for a few months."}
{"text":"Classic historic hotel.  Service is outstanding.  Had my jogging shoes out and the maid left a map of area walking paths."}
{"text":"Our stay was great. We loved being able to walk throughout the shady resort with our little ones. There were 8 pools throughout the resort and we loved that. At one point we had a pool to ourselves for the evening. The rooms were clean except for a huge yellow stain on the cloth headboard and on the cloth on the chair in the room. (We might have just gotten one of the older rooms) Parking was also horrible but I think that was because the State Bar was being held while we were there. We had to park at the parking garage which was a little bit of a long walk, but on the same grounds as the resort.  Those were the only negative things I noticed...this hotel is also pet friendly which was awesome."}
{"text":"Was here for a West Coast Swing dance competition over the 4th of July holiday weekend.  http://www.gpsdc.com/July4thMenu.htm We would only be able to afford it during the sweltering summer with the temperature hitting 116 degrees.  $109 convention rate with 2, $5 off drink tix when you check in.  Internet in rooms free.  Free parking, paid by our convention, limited parking near the hotel rooms, but a large parking structure near the Frank Lloyd Wright Ballroom.   30% off a la carte spa treatments.  15% onsite restaurants.  I had a 1pm spa treatment that they moved to 3:00pm on Friday, will go into details of the spa in a separate review.  http://www.yelp.com/biz/hDMTdd4_YWcuSlWnVyMLkw#hrid:0hBSzjOpU8kZGfhe82VLbg   Checked in around 6:30pm on Friday and was helped immediately, no lines and the interior of the lobby was so nice and cool with its carved rock columns.  My room was originally in bumf**k, the Golf View rooms, since my friends checked in on Thursday, they moved my rooms to the Paradise Wing, off of the main Paradise pool where our cabana and the water slide was located.  The hotel room in the Paradise Wing was average but must admit the bathtub is longer then the standard size.  There is a mini bar fridge in the room and they will charge you $25 to have it emptied for your use for your own things.  The carpets are a little worn and the bed was a little too soft for me, must have been the feather bed.  AC was fine.  We rented a cabana for 3 days, around $200 each day, you get a bathroom, shower, table for 4, fridge, two covered chaise lounges near the pool.  Free water and pitchers of ice.  Misters.  We brought our own snacks and kept them in our little ante room.  They don't allow you to decorate your cabana, food service stops at 6pm and the cabana closes at 10pm but you have access to it.  Well worth the rental in that heat and ours was right next to the steps, so very convenient to the pool.  Ordered lunch one day, had the hamburger and teriyaki chicken salad, both were good, around $14 each.  The staff is very busy, so you have to flag them down for service.  Friday night was smore making night at the large bonfire at the Squaw Creek Lawn, too hot for me but during the fall and winter, should be wonderful.    Saturday night at 8pm, they had a poolside movie where you can watch from  inner tubes and floaties in the pool or lounges along the pool.  They played Madagascar our night and it was great fun.  Some complained of mosquitos but I didn't get bit until Sunday night at 2am at the pool, then I got around 8 bites.  Sunday day, near the pool was a fresh salsa making demo, so plenty and chips and salsa and cinnamon crispies to knosh on at the cabana.  The FLW ballroom was icy cold and the bathrooms were nearby and neat.    And ample room with a 5000 sq. ft. dance floor, tables and seating for 1000 dancers from across the US, Canada, UK, New Zealand and Australia.  Had a bit of a snafu on Sunday night, the hotel needed some of our ballroom, so were breaking down the ballroom floor while we were late night dancing but we all worked it nonetheless.  There isn't anything within walking distance so you need a car but a couple of miles away is a large mall with restaurants and a movie theater across the street.  Around 20 minutes from the airport.  A couple of complaints are the distance of walking from the sleeping rooms to the FLR ballroom, overcharge on my bill and the mosquitos at night.  The mosquitos are really bad, the hotel was telling people that they were spraying but with them watering all the lawns at night and the ponds, they were infested, even in the rooms.  So take insect repellent.  We would call the jutneys to take us from our hotel room to the ballroom and visa versa, so that was a nice work around.  When I saw the cabana overcharge, they fixed it at the front desk.  The staff was friendly even though overworked and overwhelmed by all of us dancers there.  The grounds are beautiful and lush and green.  The food was pricey but good and the spa was great.  A must go to if you can get a great hotel rate."}
{"text":"I love this place.  I've stayed here several times since moving to Arizona, and I have enjoyed it every time.  This past time was particularly memorable.  I got a Travelzoo deal for a night for $100, and so me and some girlfriends did a staycation.  I assumed that with that deal, we'd have one of the older rooms, but, instead, we had one of the newly remodeled rooms right in the middle of everything!  We spent the day at the Ocatillo pool.  I believe it's reserved for the Ocatillo wing guests, but we didn't realize that.  It was just the closest pool to us.  The bartender, Eric, was fantastic.  Even though he was the only one out there, he was extremely attentive and friendly.  You might assume that because we were a group of girls that he was flirty in order to get a good tip, but that was not the case.  He was just very nice and made sure that we enjoyed our time.  To top it off, when we returned to our room later that night, he had sent a bottle of champagne to our room with a note thanking us for coming to the pool.  If that's not good service, I don't know what is!  I will definitely be heading back there as soon as I can, and, thank you again to Eric."}
{"text":"Beautiful hotel  and property with very pleasant staff and nice room. Pools, coffee shops, shopping, restaurants all around the large pretty property. Close to shopping, restaurants and Scottsdale as well."}
{"text":"Granted - we received the gift certificate from a golf tourney but the heat was terrible! We have been here almost two hours and the room us no cooler and maintenance says there's nothing they can do! I'm fairly certain that they ONLY give this room to people who they give the certificates to! I love the heat but this is ridiculous.so I'm not important enough to you?!"}
{"text":"This place was just lovely in spring in desert. Service was excellent; peaceful, loved the design of the building and my room was very large and comfortable."}
{"text":"I got my room for $150 a night.  I get how ppl complain if they are paying x2 or 3 times what I did.  Great hotel for the 100 to 200 a night price range.  Ridiculous pool coffee shop swim up bar lounge golf course etc... with a ton of history.  But do not compare it to New York  Waldorf or other ritz Carlton's which I've stayed at.  It's a true 4 star Hyatt or Hilton with flair.  I will return."}
{"text":"I like the Arizona Biltmore. It is looking a little run down right now - like they are down their maintenance supervisor - but overall I am a fan.  The Biltmore is a historic and artsy place. It has beautiful grounds and pools, firepits, coffee shop and clothing retail.   The regular (classic) rooms run around $400 a night plus a $28 a night resort fee. Ubers are abundant so you can forgo the car rental. There are golf courses on site if you are into that.  They also have an onsite spa- $150 for a 50 min massage.  The Biltmore is a Hilton Waldorf Astoria. They have some more modern rooms now which I stayed in as well as cottages and suites.   I will be back!"}
{"text":"This is such a beautiful resort! Everyone is so nice, from the girl at the check in to John our bellboy and the sweet lady  at the concierge desk - our room is gorgeous and may be one of the nicest rooms I've stayed in - I'm looking forward to exploring the property over the next few days - excellent staff and excellent accommodations 5 stars for sure! Zach a waiter in the restaurant was wonderful  also room 7132 is the best room! You get afternoon sun on your private back porch :)"}
{"text":"Great resort with a livley pool. Came here randomly and had lunch by the pool, they were very friendly as i wasnt a hotel guest and just wandered in. I look forward to comming back and it was very family friendly."}
{"text":"This weekend my husband and I stayed at the historic Arizona Biltmore for a summer staycation to celebrate our 34th anniversary. We made an excellent choice! From arrival to departure, the entire staff provided top notch 5 star service. We were treated the way you could imagine the movie stars and presidents were treated that have stayed here over the years. The accommodations, the meals and the service were all over the top! Make sure you take the tour that is provided during your stay. It was enthralling to hear all the history. I wish I could have been there the night Frank Sinatra and Sammy Davis Jr., after playing a concert in Phoenix, continued their concert in the lobby at 1am or when Billy Joel took over the piano one night during his stay. Sunday brunch at Wright's is superb and the dining at Frank and Albert's is also top notch. You are missing out if you don't experience this lovely hotel."}
{"text":"The grounds were really nice and the architecture fabulous; however, this place is so poorly managed that I would NEVER recommend this place. The service so inadequate and deplorable I cannot see how this place ever gets more than two stars. Sat by the pool for three hours and never got service. No one was attending the towel station, and worse yet, no water in 108 degree weather.  The furniture in my bedroom the veneer on the furniture was bubbling, my room was never serviced before 3 PM, and the vents were black with dust. My shower had hair in the drain when I checked in."}
{"text":"In my opinion the best hotel in Phoenix. The property's Frank Lloyed Wright architecture really works well in the desert. Service is great and what you would expect from a 5 star hotel. I recommend that you book at Ocatilla as that is the nicest building with their own concierge."}
{"text":"Very disappointed!!! For an elite brand of Hilton, hotel and rooms look and feel like a cheap motel.  Lots of bugs in room including a small scorpion which crawled out under the collar of my shirt that was hanging up in the closet and a huge cockroach on the floor in the bathroom. Might be because the one inch gap under the door.  Room temp set at 65 degrees but temp never got below 79 degrees!  Room smelled like mold. There was constant construction on the grounds to fix water drainage issues. Sprinklers at night leave puddles of water in front of your door.  Some of the water even seeped under the door. Very disappointed!"}
{"text":"Room was ok. Curtain torn and A/C made a really annoying clicking sound every 15 seconds, which interrupted my sleep somewhat. Bathroom ok but slightly dated. Lovely venue for wedding reception though, with a truely superb backdrop."}
{"text":"History is so important to a place. The Arizona Biltmore has a unique history and lots of it. Plus, they have managed to keep their sight on the future and are continuously updating and tweaking the property so that each guest has a relaxing and memorable experience.   I have been there for a number of events and have always been impressed with the staff and the service. Never had a bad experience, nor even a slightly questionable one.  If you want to learn more about the incredible history and architecture, you most definitely should take the Biltmore History Tour. It is available several times a week and lasts about 1.5 hrs. Worth every minute. Call 602-955-6600 and get on the list for the next one, or when you will be in town.  Did you know that Irving Berlin composed \"White Christmas\" in 1942 in the desert? At the Arizona Biltmore? (some place in CA claims it too, but my guardian angel tells me it really was at the Biltmore . . . and she should know!)"}
{"text":"Beautiful location.  We had a nice time walking through the gardens and touring the property.  The staff is incredibly friendly.  We stayed in the Octilla, but didn't do the executive lounge, there were too many time places to eat and drink.  The rooms were gorgeous and spacious.  There was a pool and hot tub closer to our building but spent most of the second day at the Cabana Club which is closer to the spa.  Drinks here are weak and probably not worth it.  But the hot tub is large and the waterfall slide is another fun option. We enjoyed the happy hour at Frank and Albert, $5 martini's.  My favorite was the Apple Spice (nothing like those sickly sweet green appletini's).  We sat near the fire pits in the main garden area.  Dinner at Wright's was amazing and I recommend it."}
{"text":"Pros: Hilton Honors status got me an upgrade to a golf villa which was large and secluded Adjacent golf course was beautiful, excellent PING rental clubs (not owned/operated by hotel) Tennis courts well maintained, had an excellent (last minute) lesson with Jason Weather in October was lovely (90s) Friendly/helpful staff  Cons: Upon returning home, I noticed a billing discrepancy in my folio and COULD NOT FOR THE LIFE OF ME get in touch with a human being to resolve the issue. Called  multiple times. I believe the billing department tried to contact me once but they did not leave a message or call back number. The menu directs you to leave a message so there is no way to speak to a human being and the front desk says they cannot assist in billing matters. This is really unacceptable customer service!"}
{"text":"First off the grounds of the Biltmore are gorgeous, and the staff is AMAZING. Everyone went out of their way to help and accommodate us. I do however have a few complaints that made this a 4 star review instead  of a 5 star.  #1 we stayed in the \"A\" cottages, and our mini fridge had a bad seal and was leaking.  We informed the concierge and they sent maintenance. We had a note saying it is was fixed, but not so much, the seal was still bad and it still leaked.  #2, the seal under the front door was a little wide so we would wake every morning to an infestation of pill bugs that continued throughout the day. The Sunday morning we were to check out I was greeted by a large cockroach standing between me and the bathroom. Once it ran under the vanity I turned on all the lights and kept a diligent watch for it.  I would stay here again just not so sure if I'd stay in the cottages.  *Update July 3, 2015* We had done some shopping at the Wright's Studio and had bought a gift for a friend there. Today they opened it and the box was empty. I called the store and talked to Samantha, the sweet clerk who helped us the day we stayed there and she apologized and said she'd ship one out to us. Again I'll say it, AMAZING staff!! I'm giving them 4 3/4 stars now!"}
{"text":"I have always wanted to stay at the Biltmore, and thanks to a great deal this Labor Day weekend (and my boyfriend's Hotels.com points) I finally was able to make it happen. It was a mix of highs and lows, but overall, I would give it 4 stars.  Checking was a pain. The lady who helped us wasn't friendly and seemed annoyed. She also didn't give us very good directions to our room. After checking in, we attempted to self-park. Unfortunately, there were absolutely zero parking spots free. We ended up back at valet, which we were not aware costs $27/night.  Although it was a pain finding our room, at least we had the beautiful grounds to admire while we looked. Once we got into the room, I was definitely happy with the accommodations. We had a 4th floor room with a large balcony and a view of a Camelback Mountain. The room itself was large, and the bed was super comfy. The only thing that was kind of weird is there was a large empty space in the room that would have been perfect for a couch or anything really. Maybe the Biltmore just wanted us to have more room for activities?  We ventured to one of the smaller pools to avoid the crowds at the main pool. The servers still make the rounds at the small pool, and our waitress was quick and checked in plenty of times to see if we needed anything. Of course, the drink prices are ridiculous, but we did see quiet a few people with their own alcohol (note to self for next time).  That night we ate dinner at the Wright Bar, which was just okay, mostly do to the service (the waitress spilled a glass of red wine on my boyfriend's white shirt but still charged us full price for everything). We spent the rest of the night back at the pool, which is open 24 hours. After a great night's sleep, we woke to a bill under the door for an additional $60 for valet parking and the resort fee. I figured there might be a resort fee, but when we checked in, we specifically asked and were told we had already prepaid for everything and the credit card was just for incidentals. My boyfriend spoke to a manager and explained the situation. The manager was great and took care of the fees and even let us have a 2 p.m. check out.  Overall, the grounds are immaculate, and it's neat to stay somewhere so full of history--our room had a picture of Ronald Reagan's registration card from when he stayed here for his honeymoon. Although there were some misses in customer service, I would definitely love to stay here again!"}
{"text":"I love the Biltmore! The rooms are really nice and big and they have great ammenities. The pool was a lot of fun! They have a water slide that is extremely fast and the staff is very laid back and nice. We had a group of 6 and they let us go down the slide how ever we wanted! There wasn't a crazy line so all of us went a million times! We even went in pairs and even a group of 5 down the slide! So much fun! They also have a giant chess board where the pieces go up to your knees! The landscaping is beautiful and I liked that the room had a big balcony! I want to come back again soon since it is so close by!"}
{"text":"I've never actually stayed at the Biltmore, but I've had many dinners here, as well as attended many wine tastings and alcohol conventions. All were fabulous.  The hotel is impressive, from the attentive and helpful staff to the modern decor.  I have also had a few massages at the spa and they've all been amazing.  Everyone is so professional and they cater to your every desire.  The pool area looks great- I always see people out there relaxing with a tropical drink.  I've never heard of anyone having a bad experience while staying here and it's in a good location. If you are looking for a nice hotel to stay at, definitely check this one out!"}
{"text":"One of the best resort we have been to in a long time.  The service and staff exceeded our expectations.  The golf course was exceptional and the kids pool was great for the little one.  We will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Thus is such a classic place to stay - love the architecture and the great service!  Rooms, closets and bathrooms are big by today's standards. Definitely a place to stay, especially in the summer months when the rates are very reasonable!!"}
{"text":"Frank Lloyd Wright design is really cool to see in person. I loved the nostalgic feel of the hotel.  Service was good, our first  room was hot due to a/c issues and they got us a new room quickly.  After a nights stay I picked up a towel from the bathroom counter and out came a scorpion. I told the guy at the front desk and he was like yeah we have been dealing with that for awhile, thanks for letting me know. WTF! How about you should have let me know about it at check in! That's why I can't give it a higher rating."}
{"text":"Always a pleasure staying at the Biltmore  I stay at the Biltmore about four times a year for work. While the drive in is circuitous and a bit confusing, the property and staff are top-notch. It's rich with history and architecture, surrounded by nice homes and many premier shopping and dining options.  My greatest love of the hotel is due to the Frank Lloyd Wright architecture. Taliesin West isn't far from the hotel, but the Biltmore is something of an architectural museum in itself. The narrow-to-large progression of space in the main lobby is classic FLW. Wright's restaurant is a modernized re-conception of something he'd do and comes off well. The rooms are large and modern. The meeting spaces take you back to the original designs, while the conference spaces walk towards contemporary. And the main courtyard and many pools on the property bring it all together superbly.  Staff has always been friendly and have a routine of texting you periodically to make sure everything is going to your preference. And when my little girls come with for a trip, they love the Biltmore, pools, and Phoenix/Scottsdale area."}
{"text":"A beautiful spot and the rooms are nice. I have eaten at 2 of their restaurants and had a great breakfast and an ok dinner. Service has been very good and I'd stay here again while in the area."}
{"text":"Beautiful resort!  We loved all the little touches like the garden chess games, and the fire pits.  Perfect place for a family reunion.  A few pools available, so it kept the kids interests. They loved the 92' curly slide under the waterfall, which is staffed with a lifeguard, but not consistently open.  Most of the staff was friendly and helpful.  Once on the resort one doesn't have to leave...the mall is a very short car drive away.  We didn't take the shuttle though heard it runs once an hour."}
{"text":"An idol of my youth whose best times are probably behind it, sadly.  I've been there so many times for special occasions. It's always seemed like the real core of the Valley to me. The grounds and main halls are still beautiful and are maintained with a reverence that is befitting a national landmark.  But as a place to stay . . . . ya know. . . there's a newer Hilton not so far away. And the Marriott Buttes are really nice. Out in North Scottsdale and Carefree they have some really great places, too.  Your experience of the Biltmore will depend entirely on two factors: How much you have to spend, and in which section your room resides.  The newer casita section is nice and feels modern and premium. The rooms that were built-up in the 50's and 60's are less so, but still nice in their modernist way. The rooms in the main building would seem to be the real catch, but only for those with an historical interest. The world does hotel rooms differently now than they did in the 1920's, and there are some elements of the layout that can't be changed--like needing to walk a block or so (partially through a carpeted lobby)  to get to the pool.  Also, if you happen to get a deal on the rooms at their Summertime rate (which can be a great savings) keep in mind that you'll also be paying over $12 for a plain bagel and plain coffee at the on-site Starbucks. Unlike at many other hotels, there's no way to just pop across the street to get something more reasonable. You'll likely need to drive a mile or so to get to the slightly less-expensive Biltmore Fashion Park or the businesses along Camelback Road. And it can get tiring if you decide to self-park instead of availing yourself of the valet parking (which rings in at a modest $20 per day plus gratuity), because the self-parking areas can be a real hike.   So if you have the dosh to hang with the elite crowd--or just a really fat expense account and an understanding boss or controller--then I'm sure it can be a suitably swank experience. And you know Clark Gable and Rita Hayworth and the Reagans and all of them stayed there. However, at that level of $wank, there are other choices that are a bit more accommodating."}
{"text":"Old school luxury - This is a Frank Lloyd Wright hotel from the 30's through and through and the staff are nothing short of gracious. We requested pool side, which we got, but it was the wrong pool... Ha! Make sure you request the \"main pool\" which is the one with the swim-up bar, slide, etc... Unfortunately the Sunday Brunch (which is famous) was closed due to remodeling. Either way, we loved the overall experience and will be back."}
{"text":"We love going to the Arizona Biltmore, whether to eat or enjoy the patio off of the Wright Bar. The Frank Lloyd Wright design still blows me away with his detail. I don't know of too many lobbies that have a more beautiful seating area.   The hotel's new Hollywood and Wine Events was a great find for us. On specified weekends the hotel hosts either comedy or musical acts in one of their rooms. We went to the Comedy show last weekend and had an amazing time. $10 for the tickets (show lasted 2 hours) and the well drinks were only $5 (includes martinis). I was paying $19 at the Wright Bar just 100 yards away. Great comics and overall show.   The Biltmore is worth just visiting or spending a few days to enjoy the spa and golf. Glad we live right there to enjoy it year round."}
{"text":"I had the luxury to have a  week stay here last August , the grounds here are green and  flawless , my room was very modern with a comfortable bed, down pillows and a huge flat screen TVs to veg-out  too - great for  avoiding the Arizona heat. The view out of  my room was of one of the many Baltimore's  pools where you could see people throughout the day ordering drinks and laying out and soaking up the rays where one can only imagine the famous past of the Baltimore's guest of yesterdays. The main pool has classic views all around of \"Wright\" iconic architecture -it even has a water slide for kids and adults to enjoy. The staff was polite to the point that i became embarrassed after a week's stay. The food at the Wright Bar was great - best duck I have ever come cross to date. If you have a chance sign up for the mountain bike ride that takes you through some fun and scary Arizona trails. The gym facilities need some updating but the locker room area are of spa quality - plenty of Bumble & Bumble for your hair."}
{"text":"I love this property. Very unique with surprises, like huge chessboards, around every corner. Every time I stay here the staff and management go out of their way to accommodate any request I have. I travel a lot for work and I used to be a Starwood person. I'm seriously thinking about switching to Hilton just so I can accumulate points to take my family here annually."}
{"text":"Was headed to Phoenix for a few days and the Biltmore is a great name at a fab price:  $99/night.  So we stayed.  Pros: Nice rooms.  Comfortable.  Air conditioning blew like a $2.00 whore.  Cons: Parking: what a mess!  $12 to self-park and it takes forever to get to the garage or other lot. Lighting:  They're doing some construction, and at night it's downright dangerous since all the lights are off.  Nearly tripped several times. Location of room relative to hotel: The property is huge!  My room was all the way in the back.  I should have packed a small meal; I almost went missing on my walk from the parking lot back to the room.  Without exaggeration, it's easily 1/4 mile.  A nice hotel for the price, but I went to relax, not go on a hike a few times a day (pool to room!)"}
{"text":"Just had the worst experience with the reservations department and won't be returning.  I stay here for staycations and book a bloc of rooms annually for a convention. That ends today.  Something new must be going on, or someone in management is getting lazy when it comes to training."}
{"text":"While the food, staff,and rooms were nice I will never stay there again. I left the hotel after 2 nights due to bites all over my body. I have over 25 massive, itchy, red bug bites. I noticed them after the first night. And thought nothing of it. But then I woke up at 3 am on the 2nd night and felt them happening. After shaking out to sheets I found nothing!! They are so bad I have to keep itch cream on them at all times. I told the front desk, they comped one night but I had to share. I'll never go there again just to be eaten alive by bed bugs or whatever these horrible bugs were"}
{"text":"A beautiful sunset it was.  A visit to the outdoor patio for drinks left a memorable image of a wedding going on in the background while sitting on huge comfortable lounge chairs.  Sitting in these comfortable chairs, you could veg out after a stiff drink.  You'll really feel relaxed in this Frank Lloyd Wright architectural environment and the Arizona heat.  There is a serenest about this place."}
{"text":"Won an auction certificate for a free night here, really appreciated them extending it as had a baby and there were two dates on the certificate. I reached out ahead of time to figure out the logistics referred to Stephanie who forwarded me to Jennifer. I thought everything was taken care of as they mentioned having an extension letter at the front desk. The GPS doesn't work in this area so we got lost for about 20 mins so upon arrival was hoping for a smooth transition only to find out there was no extension letter, I mentioned Stephanie and Jennifer the front desk was skeptical, their response was oh yeah there is a Stephanie that works here, both front staff went to look for the person to approve it, I ended up having to find the email and you would think if you read an email from a hotel employee who stated the gift certificate would be honored, it would be ok, but the front staff person took my phone without asking went off and I waited around to find out if it would get approved when in reality could have gone to JW just a little ways away where we treat their platinum members great (which is what I should have done) the facility looks great but when you can't find it (basic customer expectation) and simple processes are broken not great for a hotel that's supposed to be on the higher end. Could be because I'm not dressed up enough to be considered as valued customer (in typical mom wear of yoga pants and a long sleeve Henley). An ideal experience would have been able to check in with no issues, being asked if we wanted to drop off our baggage as self parking is a ways away (esp when I mentioned we have a sleeping baby) or at least offered a golf cart pick up or even a bottle of water which was offered to the guests after me #biltmorefail  When I thought everything had settled I find a yellowish scorpion by the shower as I'm about to lay down my shower mat really great for me esp as I have a walking baby #biltmorenotfamilyfriendly  And on top of all this I have to speak to them about bedbugs as my daughter got bit"}
{"text":"Did not live up to my expectations. Went there for drinks and apps on a Sunday afternoon. Service was not 5-Star, as one would expect at such a 'prestigious\" resort. However, Margaritas were on point. Great people watching, if you are into that :) The pool was overly crowded and loud, I did not go in because I was not staying there as a guest. Landscaping was nice but Groundskeeping was lacking, there was trash and food debris in some areas."}
{"text":"Wow. This is my new favorite hotel. Absolutely, stunningly, gorgeous. I want to live here.  Built in 1928 in collaboration with Frank Lloyd Wright, the Arizona Biltmore is a historic work of art, where attention is paid to every little detail. The grounds are magnificent. The resort is sprawling. The service, impeccable. Its 8 pools and multiple gardens, interconnected by perfectly manicured and dimly lit pathways, cast you into an almost-dreamlike state. At night, cozy your way into a comfy Adirondack chair on the Squaw Peak Lawn, sipping a stiff drink under the soft moonlight, while staring at the twinkling stars that shine above the dry, desert mountainscape. This is how the good life is lived.  The saddest part of my experience was that I was only here on business, and could only barely take advantage of everything the Arizona Biltmore has to offer. Apparently if you like golf, which I don't, then this is one of the best places to get your game on. All of the food on the property was also pretty magnificent -- and that's saying a lot for a work-related event. But then again, the Arizona Biltmore is part of the Waldorf-Astoria collection of hotels, a brand built around exceeding expectations.   What I do know is that I will be back. And when I come back, it will be for fun and leisure, and hopefully with friends. Time is suspended here. Most of the hotel amenities are open around the clock. Whether you like kicking it around the outdoor fireplace into the wee hours of the night, or want to sip mimosas poolside before the sun starts to rise, you're on your own clock here. There are few rules holding you back from having the time of your life. So take a moment to stop and smell the roses and treat yourself to this art deco desert gem."}
{"text":"The hotel grounds are stunning with beautiful architecture and landscaping. Perfect valley location. The pools are fun for kids and the other activities available make this a great stay for families (and pets!). Three stars for it being an overpriced 4 star hotel, horrible service, AC in room didn't work,  and the bedding is less than sub-par. Would only come back for the low rates in summer to enjoy the pool and landscaping. Not worth the cost during peak season."}
{"text":"The place is nice--no doubt.  It is very clean and perfectly maintained.  I was here for a work conference that did not afford any down time.  I walked the grounds as much as I could, but never even  went into the pool. NOTE--Frank Lloyd Wright did not design this place.  He advised one of his studends and it does have a FLW vibe--sort of like if you went to FLWworld at Epcot.  I overate at numerous breakfast, lunch and dinner sessions for 150 people--none of which was bad, but it was certainly not special.  On depature day, i went to the carry out cafe for a go-cup of coffee--$4.06. I have never been to a quality hotel anywhere in the world that did not offer complimentary coffee to guests.  Also, they did not have used laundry bags in the room.I had a room facing the front that had a balcony.  One day, another group had a cocktail party 12 inches from my hotel door.  The day i was leaving, the staff was setting up a lunch on my patio!!  This is the place you go for a prepaid work event.  My company spent a fortune here--I would not recomend it to anyone on their own dime"}
{"text":"If you like nostalgia/Old Hollywood/Palm Springs, then you will love the Biltmore. I stayed here for Spring break back in the mid-2000s and loved it. It's on beauitful grounds, and my sister and I got a kick out of the croquet fields. The hotel's architecture was consulted by Frank Lloyd Wright, and everything from the block design to the spacious lobby carries the Wright style. Great pool as well, though you might have to get there at the crack of dawn to get a poolside spot. Overall, a great vacation spot, and centrally located near downtown Phoenix and Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I stayed here for a couple of days in November with my two adult daughters. The rooms were nice, the grounds were beautiful and our service was excellent. We are all three fans of Frank Lloyd Wright and, though he is not the architect for the buildings, and there have been several extensions, the architectural style is heavily influenced by his teachings and what remains of the original buildings has such history!   One of my daughters expressed interest to Stephanie (at the front desk) seeing the original structures (as opposed to the more recent additions such as the one we were staying in).  She went out of her way to arrange a tour of the historic buildings and then went above and beyond by sending a gift bag to my daughter containing a Frank Lloyd Wright book! We couldn't be more pleased. I noticed other reviewers mentioned the vouchers and the parking.   Vouchers: We had AMEX credit for use in the restaurants and gift shop so we splurged for fine dining.  The fine print says to present them at the time of use, which we didn't see at the time of use.  But when we realized it and asked at the front desk the day we were going to check out, they had no problem crediting them. Parking: Yes, the non-valet parking is a hike. We didn't have a problem with walking, especially since the grounds are beautiful.   In all, it was a very nice stay."}
{"text":"We had a very disappointing stay at this property, but more disappointing has been the blatant lack of follow up. Rather than come to Yelp first, I sent 3 private messages on Facebook. A week later I got an email asking about my stay. On June 24th, I finally got an email from Joseph. I wrote back on June 26th with the details of the problems during our stay... and heard nothing back. I followed up with another email to him July 1st and sent another private message on FB the same day... Nothing from either channel.  I am completely shocked at our experience and the follow customer service. This is not the experience I've come to expect. In fact, I went from a fan who wanted to share about my poor experience to feeling like I never want to book at one of your properties again -- your lack of communication did that.   In the hopes that this might reach someone there, here is the email I sent to Joseph:   \"Hi Joseph, Thanks for your email. I hate to complain, but we experienced a few disappointing issues, and I appreciate the opportunity to share. Since becoming Hilton members we've made the effort to choose Hilton properties, including on our staycation. We've generally had good experiences and were surprised at our stay.  I booked 2 rooms for 2 nights, checking in on Father's day to celebrate with my husband, dad and kids. We were impressed that our early check in was accommodated, we were very grateful in fact. Unfortunately, I kind of wish we were told to come back - we had maintenance people turn up looking for a mystery issue they couldn't identify, and while my son was undressed and using the bathroom, a maid came by wanting to take inventory of the mini-bar. I asked if she could please come back a little later, that we needed privacy, and she refused. I was really take back at her refusal to return.  Generally speaking, the property just seemed in rough shape. We get that it's off season, and as locals we are able to take advantage of great rates, but it almost seems that there is an attitude that no one is around to see the mess. But we were :( We stayed in Ocatilla, and the entrance to Cottage K, which we saw every time we came in and out, was full of boxes and trash. The hallways were full of visitors' dishes and trash. On our first afternoon, we came in around lunchtime and used dishes were still sitting in the hallway over night. There was a plate of half eaten food on the ground next to the elevator that sat for our entire visit - it became a joke with the kids wondering if it would still be there the next time we walked by... and every time it was :( The scale in my dad's room didn't work, the shower constantly dripped (more like streaming) and his remote was dead.  One of the days we visited the pool - my dad saw a bat that had fallen into the pool and was swimming around, and alerted a maintenance person. The man who came to help didn't know what to do, so he scooped it up in a cup and dumped it out on the ground. We were concerned about a child or pet getting bitten, but didn't know what else to do :(  On our last day, we asked to check our bags so we could check out on time and visit the pool. We specifically did that so our bags wouldn't sit in our hot car all afternoon. When we were ready to leave, we went to the desk to get our bags and were sent to the bell desk -- outside. Our clothes, 2 laptops, my makeup, and food were sitting out side in the 100+ degree heat for a half day, and where anyone could've walked off with it all :( It seemed like common sense that you wouldn't leave luggage out in the heat all afternoon, in fact it seemed very inconsiderate.   The experience had the effect on my husband that he wanted to stop spending money when he felt it was no longer a value, and overall, the visit was not relaxing or very enjoyable. This is my second time staying at your property - the first time was so nice, I really wanted to share that experience with my family but this fell very, very short of our anticipation :(  I know your property has a very good reputation, and again, we usually enjoy and are loyal to Hilton. I thought you'd want to know about our experience, thanks for your time.\"  Buyer beware."}
{"text":"This is a pleasant nice hotel. Me Kelly and Joe stayed here, our nanny Shirley watched Morris and Lala.We got a nice room.There are some snacks and water out in the room and if you eat or drink it you have to pay like 25 dollars. The next morning  me and Joe went downstairs.They have a nice  garden. Joe spotted  Lawn chess so we played a round of chess .Joe won. Then we went in the pool and down the waterside .Then we got in the hot tub .they had no lights in the hot tub.then we did it over and over. It was nice."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite hotels.  It's known as one of the most spectacular resorts in the world.  With Frank Lloyd Wright inspired architecture, they have great rooms esp. the cottages with private patios, sprawling lush landscaping, and 8...yes 8 swimming pools (one with a slide!).  I've never seen another hotel with so many activities.  Croquet and life size chess, 18-hole putting course, an adjacent golf course, fitness center, tennis, hikes, bicycle rides, cooking classes, yoga, golf, board games, arts and crafts, sporting activities, a Kids Korral (play equipment includes arack ride, floating stones, a bowed ladder, tunnel spiral slide, curly climber, snake pole, triple slide, chain net climber, arched bridge, loop climber, super rider and corkscrew), and a spa where you can get a massage outdoors in a tent next to the pool.  The pool and jacuzzi are open 24/7.  The style of the rooms is mission with textiles in desert palettes.  The room service is great, the food is tasty -- it's the perfect place to unwind."}
{"text":"Should have read the reviews before booking!  This is definitely not the level of service we expected for a 5-star hotel.  We had less than a five minute wait at the front desk, but it took the front desk over 20 min to check us in, then we were given poor directions to Paradise.  Upon entering our room we found dirty dishes on the floor, but the room had been cleaned, so I believe it was an oversight by the housekeeper.  The room was a king room with a balcony, however we were hard pressed to find a place to sit or put our luggage!  The reservation said marble bath, I guess they were talking about the vanity, because there was no bath, only a shower.  Immediately upon entry we telephoned guest services for champagne flutes and an ice bucket as we were celebrating and wanted to have a glass and get to the pool while the sun was still shining...30 min later I had to call again, and again we waited.  Finally after almost 45 min we received the champagne flutes and two \"plastic beer cups\" for the pool.  At this level of service could they not provide plastic champagne flutes for the pool; I mean we weren't exactly drinking Cold Duck?!   Looking for an elegant and celebratory dining experience for the evening, and not wanting to leave the premises, we attempted to make dinner reservations at the resort's upscale restaurant, Wright's, only to be told they are not open on Sunday evenings.  Are you kidding me?  The concierge made a few suggestions and made a dinner reservation at a restaurant offsite, however we ended up canceling opting instead for room service; which I can say was pretty decent, but then again we had brought our own champagne and wine.  Arriving at the pool we were told we needed to go to another area to retrieve pool towels, the look on my face must have said it all because the bar manager said, \"hold on,\" and promptly came back with four fresh towels and did not ask for our pool towel cards.  The Paradise pool was nice, and I liked the fact it had an \"adults only\" section, however the jacuzzi was dirty and the jets were not functioning.  The bed was comfortable, but we were on the top floor and you would have thought there was a room above us running the shower all evening.  I have no idea what the sound was, but I had a fitful night's sleep; the sound was deafening.  This morning we had an early flight and needed to check out at 4:30 a.m. We called down for the car so as not to wait, and yes...we waited.  The bellman apologized profusely telling us he was the only attendant on duty!  If you have not visited this resort to say it is HUGE is an understatement!  This resort is significantly understaffed, and lacks the professionalism and quality touches an establishment at this level should have.   Management did attempt to extend the olive branch by sending up a fruit plate and two bottles of water.  While the gesture was appreciated it hardly made up for the lack of attention to the details.    Bottom line:  At close to $500 for one night (including taxes and resort fees), you should definitely be getting something more than what you receive!!  I guess it goes to show that it's the company you keep that makes the occasion and I am blessed to have been with someone special, so in spite of the disappointments the only thing that mattered was who I was with and that made the evening enjoyable."}
{"text":"For the last weekend of summer rates, my honey and I stayed at the Biltmore and purchased the Ocatilla package. It was a separate building that had a separate lounge that offered different amenities during the day. It is also included GC's to Frank and Albert's and Wright's.  Pros: -Easy to check in and out -Allowed for early check in -Self parking -Food @ Wright's (lamb and tartare was delish) -Pool open 24 hours  Cons: -Guest rep at check in was asked to book the reservation for our dinner @ Wright's...didn't do it -The food and drink options were limited and average at the Ocatilla lounge -The chairs against the tile in the lounge sounded horrific -customer service was so below average t the Ocatilla lounge. No skim milk, no real \"Full continental breakfast\" -Dinner @ Wrights, my guy had a scorpion crawl up his leg and killed it right before dessert. The server and manager made excuses, was sorry but not REALLY sorry. They comped the souffle but was a little uneasy with their response -elevator in Ocatilla building was a hot box - felt like a thousand degrees -Could not accommodate late check out  Based on the list above...I would not have another staycation here."}
{"text":"Beautiful area. nice staff. we stayed in the new rooms so pretty sure thats why we had some issues with the shower and some other things. nice lounge areas and delicious though pricey food in their restaurants"}
{"text":"Eh. Not the Waldorf's best effort by a long shot. Pros: grounds are beautiful,  ocatilla room is nice, and shuttle service to the fashion mall is helpful. Cons: hit or miss valet staff,  abrupt front desk service, and an incredibly rude sedan driver. Visits to other WA properties may have spoiled us.  Details lacking so the Biltmore too lacks that \"wow\" factor.  Disappointed to have decided to spend our anniversary getaway here."}
{"text":"The Odd Couple. Resort style. Upon checking in with my hardcore, partying restaurant kin for a manager/chef retreat, we discovered the resort was saturated with over 1,000 (yes, that's 1,000) families for a church conference. Agnes of God! Seriously, I thought? How will this pan out? Well, Rickie and I had a gorgeous second story cottage. Which was a large, beautiful suite overlooking fountains, flowers and fanatics. First jab at the religious folks. We spent the afternoon poolside drinking mojitos, pina coladas, and Dos XX. Anytime the swarm of God's children splashed or came to us in the pool, we chanted \"Too closey, no splashy.\" They did some sort of sign of the cross thing and off they swam. Jab number two. The poolside service was outstanding...thank you, er um, God Bless you Brian, our quick witted, Atheist server. The grounds were impeccable. Front desk service was professional. And our room's lil fridge was stocked to the gills. Anyone who knows me, knows I'm a huge FLW nut, and love all of his architecture and those that he inspired. You truly feel his spirit here at the Biltmore. Especially after boozing it up in the afternoon sun. As we sat in the spa today, awaiting our masseuses, we noticed front page news in the AZ Republic, announcing a $300 million Biltmore renovation. And. Well. It's a good thing. Cracked paint. Buckled ceilings and dated furniture. Though badly needed. Did not mar the ambiance, energy and joy we experienced for our retreat. Standing in line for our $6 bagel and $8 smoothie, we overheard the church goers behind us actually praying for lower prices. Wow. Does that work? Jab number three. I didn't stick around to find out. We headed back to our suite. And actually ended up watching Bruce Almighty. Coincidence? I think not."}
{"text":"This hotel was amazing to stay at. My boyfriend was there for a conference and I was able to enjoy the many luxuries of the property in the day. We stayed in a suite overlooking the Catalina Pool. There isn't one bad thing I can say. The suite was spotless, the employees were all very friendly and helpful and the pool was a blast!"}
{"text":"Just spent a beautiful weekend at the Biltmore and stayed in the newly renovated Ocatilla Wing. Very nicely appointed rooms with Frank Lloyd Wright inspired design. Simple and very elegant. We loved the private concierge service with a great breakfast, cocktails and appetizers for the guests. All included in the price of the room."}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to our stay until reading many of the previous yelps. I then prepared myself to be disappointed. I was not. I was actually surprised at how nice the property actually is. Is it old and a bit worn down? Yes, but it definitely makes up for this in charm and beautiful grounds. The furnishings are a bit worn but this is quickly forgotten while relaxing on the patio with a glass of wine.  The garden suites are old but we love the feel of privacy.  The main pool is where all the action is but the Catalina pool is only steps away and serviced well by the wait staff and much quieter.  There is a small cafe to grab some pastry and coffee on the run. If you need a bloody mary to get your day started try the Frank and Alberts bar. Its the only place early in the morning.  This is not your typical cookie cutter big chain resort. Go with an open mind, an appreciation of yesteryear and you will be delighted."}
{"text":"I stayed at the Arizona Biltmore for a conference last week. It as a nice enough hotel. It's very big and perfect for a conference. The hotel seemed to be very accommodating to the conference in terms of food service, the conference rooms for our meetings, etc. The hotel itself is rather old and it seems to have a lot of history. However, with it being somewhat old, it also was a little rundown. The hotel and the hotel rooms look nice, but then you start to notice little things. For example, the outlets were really loose. The things I plugged in seemed to slip out so easily. I had to get the plugs situated just right for things like my cell phone charger and light to work. There was also a crack in the sink - it didn't leak, but it just didn't look good. And the air conditioner was so loud and the phone handset didn't plug into the phone receiver correctly, so I could only use the phone on speakerphone. However, the food was very good. And the staff were very accommodating and nice. Overall my stay was good at this hotel."}
{"text":"Beautiful historic hotel, lovely grounds, delightful service, good food.  What's not to like?  We will be back!"}
{"text":"This is a beautiful, historic property and it is sad to see it being so poorly run.  Any hotelier who knows what he/she is doing knows that local business is important for resort hotels especially in the off-season. Recent management changes have resulted in this hotel being considerably less welcoming to local visitors.  Although we have spent thousands here over the years on restaurants and other services, our enthusiasm for this wonderful property has waned as it has become more focused on profits than on people."}
{"text":"Beautiful setting and if the Waldorf-Astoria Management can succeed at building a staff to match this could be a wonderful place. The sour attitude of the Concierge attendees and the unfriendly waitresses outside at the Squaw Peak Terrace dampened any good impression we were going to take away. My advice is that there are so many other wonderful hotels in Scottsdale and Phoenix, go there and come here for dinner only to experience the setting"}
{"text":"We have been twice in summer. It is great for families. Movies at the pool, waterslide, and food. Be sure to book all inclusive in the summer. I recommend only staying in the Ocatilla wing. Their is a private concierge, breakfast, appetizers, and dessert included. Stretch your Monet and go in summer."}
{"text":"This is a \"bucket list\" hotel...seriously. You should try to stay at the Biltmore at least once in your life. This is probably my favorite hotel anywhere, and I have traveled a lot.   I love the architecture. I know...FLW didn't really design it, but you can see his influence in the place.  I love just sitting in the lobby and looking at it...total class. These are some of the loveliest and best-maintained grounds of any hotel you will ever see.   The rooms can be small or as big as you can afford, but no matter the size, they are all well appointed and always immaculately clean.   The lobby bar is a perfect hangout.  The bartenders are always responsive and friendly.  The Frank and Albert's bar service is also excellent...one of the best Bloody Marys to be had anywhere. The food at Frank and Albert's is very, very good.   The staff is superlative. I have never encountered anything other than top-of-the-line service."}
{"text":"I stayed here for a week due to a work event so can't comment on the price (thanks work) but can on the atmosphere and service.   This place is beautiful! It's a little more rustic than my usual style but still very classy. They also have little shops near the lobby which makes it truly feel like a resort since you're so closed off. The service was attentive and our room was huge and beautiful! We had a walk out balcony looking at the mountains in the backdrop which was stunning. We also rented a private cabana at the pool and was easily the best experience we had. Although they could probably use a little cleaning - I definitely had no intention on sitting on the couch inside.   The location of our hotel room though was pretty far from everything else. I guess with how large this place is, it's hard to to accommodate everyone in terms of location. But it would have made more sense to have our very large event in at least one area - we were completely spread out and there were easily 400 of us. The restaurants were pretty good but a little overpriced.   Not the Biltmore's fault but it was miserably hot when we were here. Arizona is not really for me, I do better in snow. I was also constantly fearful of scorpions nearby even though I never saw one. Also, you guys have some really creepy looking birds that like to attack leftover food. No thanks! I'll stick to Chicago where we just have bad drivers and cold weather.  I'm docking it in stars because of the customer service. I didn't read the charges until I returned (it was emailed after checkout) because it was a long week of working but realized I was overcharged on some things. When I called, I kept getting voicemails and to leave my information. But no one called me back for 2 days! Finally I had to pressure a guy at the front desk to answer my questions since billing wouldn't. He corrected the issue and sent me a new bill immediately but for such a nice hotel AND for such a large group that just dropped a load of money on your resort, ignoring someone for two days is not acceptable."}
{"text":"Went out of curiosity to see what the place was about. A hotel from the old days, before chains existed.  Cool, art-Deco architecture and decor.  Frank Lloyd Wright-inspired design, with lovely Terrace to sit and have an (expensive) alcoholic beverage.  Apparently, this was where the original Tequila Sunrise was invented, so that's what I got.  It was good.  The terrace overlooks an expansive green, with a large fountain, and twinkle lights on the bordering trees.  Great atmosphere.  Food was so-so.  Service was eh.  Glad I went, if only to experience a step back in time.  Check it out!"}
{"text":"I'm so bad. I've been here more than a handful of times. And this is the first time I've gotten around to writing a review.  HOH NO.  No bueno Irene.  Big spots for Me?  Frank & Alberts \"High Five\" Happy Hour.  Wait, you're not shocked right? There's major food and booze involved in my review.   Yes, yes. There's the pool And I'll DEFINITELY GET TO THAT.   The bathrooms have wonderful showers and the beds are like heaven sighed. Even if you stay near an elevator you'll never hear it. Room service is impeccable. (And they will go out of their way to deliver something special for birthdays.) The main lobby area is a special place to come for a fancy evening cocktail. You can come casual or dressed to the nines.   So...right. Happy Hour. 'Cause I like to drink and eat.   Uh...tucked right into the cutest bar you'll find a hub bub of activity come happy hour. Guest flock here. Locals flock here.   Five bucks buys you a CORNUCOPIA of blessings. - Glass of house red or white wine - Four \"bar bites\" (really delish restaurant food) - Domestic beers - Some fruity cocktails (honestly you'd have to pull the menu for that. All I hear is mwah mwah mwah :) .... and appetizers are half off.   NO JOKE!   If calories were no issue (or if I could exercise forever) I would eat here ALL.THE.TIME.  I'll come back and write an entire review on Frank & Albert's one day. Just know this is a special treat should you visit the Biltmore.  Before POOL TALK a shout out must go to Keri Christian.   Who is this? My favorite Concierge.  YOU CAN HAVE ONE? Yep. I'm sure they're all wonderful. This one has a sense of humor. And carries a supply of bandaids.  Ok. So the pool area. Bring a floppy hat 'cause you're never going to leave.   Eh. I suppose that could be the review. But then I wouldn't be fair to explain how much FUN this place can be.   Check it. They will pull in DJs to rock out tunes. On Sundays in July and August the music is full on party mode. AND there are Happy Hour prices at the bar.   (Just be sure to (a) ask for the happy hour pricing menu and (b) remind the bartender to give you the pricing each time you place an order. So as an example, draft beer is $3. But ask for it! Otherwise it will cost you eight bucks.)  Although I've been told there is an \"adult\" pool. I'm not entirely sure where that is. All three pools in the Paradise Pool area were sprinkled with adults, families, kids ... and everyone seemed a-ok with the wild amount of booze. Hey, works for me!  If you're a local, this is a great place to have a staycation. If you're visiting, heck ya. This is spaceballs amazing. You'll never forget it. COME HERE!"}
{"text":"When I woke up, my first morning at the Biltmore, I didn't have hot water. Not even warm water. After a brief icy shower (the coldest of my life), I hurried to the front desk to complain before I had to go to my meetings that day. The receptionist wrote down my room number on a Post-It and assured me that I would have hot water the next time I took a shower. I rushed off to my meetings, glad they were on the case. However, I came back to my room on lunch, around 2pm, and found that though it was clear someone had been there (they left the TV and lights on), I still had no hot water. So I went to complain again before my afternoon meetings began. Once again, the receptionist wrote down my room number on a Post-It, and assured me they would get the hot water working. After the day's meetings, I checked my room again and still: no hot water. When I complained this third time, the receptionist once again pulled out the Post-It's and wrote down my room number. I was like, \"Whatever you're doing by writing down my room number isn't working. I need a new solution.\" So they found me a new room and it did have hot water. Yay. Now I'd like to take you back in time again to the first time I arrived. There was a Fiji bottle of water sitting next to the ice bucket! Huzzah, I cried! Wow, this place is fancy to just give those away, I thought! But no, when I was located to my next room I discovered that in THIS room, the bottle had an $8 price tag on it. They had left that off of the first room (shameful omission!). Not only that, but when whoever it was that had been in my room earlier, they had taken my half-drunk bottle of Fiji water and disposed of it! All well and good if the water is free, but if you charge $8 for it, you cannot toss it from your customer's room! So, anyway, the grounds are rather striking to see, especially for architecture buffs, but the interiors of both rooms left me a little bit shocked at how much disrepair the place had fallen into. The cabinet housing my first room's fridge appeared to have a rotting floor. Chips, cracks, and peeling wallpaper was abundant. The place could use a good tune-up to bring it back to a level of quality that befits its legacy. The staff in general were amazingly attentive and great to deal with and for their extremely good face they bump this awful two-night's stay up to a \"3\". They even removed the $8 charge for the price-tag-less bottle of Fiji water without letting me finish my sentence of complaint."}
{"text":"I had a conference here and was charmed by the location, the grounds and the service.  The buildings are beautiful and the layout of the campus gives you the opportunity to admire the landscaping, the mountains and the architecture.  Everywhere I went, service was stellar.     My room was clean and comfortable and had a nice view of a pool along with a little balcony.  The main building is just breathtaking and I loved exploring it to admire the design.  Service in the bars and restaurants was terrific.  Drinks are a little pricey but when you're sitting around a fire pit on a cool evening enjoying the view, it's worth every penny.  It's located right along the canal so if you want to get a run in, you just need to walk out the door.    I'm a fan."}
{"text":"Gorgeous hotel, despite the dry heat which I almost couldn't stand. Went for a conference and stayed with someone who had Hilton Honors, so we had a lovely large room in the Ocatilla building, which has a concierge lounge, which offered a continental breakfast, appetizers and drinks in the evening. They are open until about 8 or 9 each night with water, iced tea, soft drinks, coffee and tea all day. This was great and saved us a lot of money.  Bathroom was nice, had a shower, huge tub, and toilet closet. Hotel overall was very clean."}
{"text":"The property is beautiful and clean.  Restaurant's were great.  The problem is the front desk snobs.  No personality.  They messed up my reservations, made me and my family find our own hotel for the night that they messed up?  They didn't even try to get us another room, despite me paying any price.  After a long day of travel with an infant, toddler and wife, the last thing I want to do is look for another hotel at 11 PM, only to come back the next day.  The attitude of the front desk is sad and horrible."}
{"text":"Cawabanga! This is where Frank Lloyd Wright groupies drool in abject admiration while perambulating through the corridors, lobbies, bars, and conference spaces of this venerable institution of Phoenix.  Frank Lloyd Wright disowned the authorship of this project since there was disagreement in the design concept between him and the owner. This project was not allowed to be discussed at Taliesin there after the disagreement. When Frank died, the owner wanted an addition to the project. Taliesin Associates agreed to provide the design services, under the leadership of Oligivana Wright. This project then became reassociated with FLLW.  Despite the design disagreements, this project is still a great place to see FLLW designs."}
{"text":"This is a must see!  We went just for the Frank Lloyd Wright architecture.  It is gorgeous!  And to think it was made back in in 1929!  We also had lunch at frank and Alberts."}
{"text":"The Biltmore is a beautiful resort and I would definitely reccomend this place! Beautiful landscaping and nightly or daily activities for adults and children. The pools are gorgeous and the decorative flowers make this place amazing. I would say that the rooms are average but the beds are comfy. Definitely reccomended!"}
{"text":"the water slide and poolside cabanas teased me to come play.  the spa's subtle aroma of massage oil and massage beds peeking out from the outdoor treatment rooms wooed me to put my feet up.  the bustling lobby bar and shaded outdoor patio tried to sweet talk me into having a drink.  ... and all would have come to fruition if i didn't happen to be here for work.  nonetheless....  the front desk staff did very efficiently and warmly welcome me into my very comfortable room.  the historical and luxe charm of the resort did inspire me to take long walks at night around the property to ooh and ahh at their croquet field, life size chess board, and rolling golf course.  their room service very patiently waited for me every morning as i rushed out of the shower to greet my breakfast at the door and unveiled my morning goodies.  and the arizona sun feathered me out of bed every morning - orange, hot, and inviting - making me wish that i was here on vacation instead."}
{"text":"A wonderful stay. Attentive service with going beyond the expected. Delivered champagne at no charge, drawn bubble bath with rose petals and strawberries, club lounge and amazing amenities. The Octallio within the Biltmore was an amazing experience."}
{"text":"The place is amazing and truly beautiful! Our room was a bit dirty, we were greeted to a spider web (with a spider) in our shower, the made our bed even worse than our 11 year old makes hers. Car valets were great btw."}
{"text":"Stayed here last week and it was a very nice hotel.  I really liked the architecture.  My room was very good.  Used the meeting and conference facilities while here and they were very good as well.  Really liked the service at the fire pits at night when I was allowed to bring my own wine down to drink it with friends.  Lunch at the pool was very good.  I would stay here again."}
{"text":"Transferred from another hotel to Waldorf. I can't express enough how much they turned our weekend around! Stayed in June for our kids end of year celebration and I would stay here a million times over. All ages were welcome and accommodated but I never felt like I was tripping over small children or disturbing older couples trying to relax. There truly is a place for everyone here!! Thank you Waldorf for saving our vacation!!!!"}
{"text":"The five stars is for just being a Frank Lloyd Wright inspired building- it echoes the same principles of harmonizing with the environment and echoing those elements into the interior- and harnessing natural light to its full efficacy...I was here during a conference- but wished I could have stayed and taken advantage of the resort- golf, spa, dining and pool...wonderful place!"}
{"text":"Great place to stay!   The staff was incredibly friendly, and a special shout out to the housekeepers--every time I passed someone in the hall I got a friendly \"good morning\"--and they left the rooms spotless. If I inevitably left my stuff out (sorry housekeepers!), I came back with it all lined up nicely.   The only reason for four stars vs five is the pool situation. I wish there was a pool designated for children (and those with kid-free areas). We tried the swim-up bar but left pretty quickly because kids in floaties kept bumping into us and splashing."}
{"text":"True as other Yelpers point out, it's a little run-down.  It was built in 1928, so come on, what do you expect?  As far as architecture, it's a beautiful building.  I was here for work and chose it because it was really cheap.  The staff is very friendly and helpful.  The rooms are what you expect for the price.  The pool is very nice and the gym is by far one of the best hotel gyms I've ever seen.  You get free weights and lots of machines.  Reynaldo, the hotel gym employee was very friendly and helpful.  So was the concierge.  I do have one gripe, I think the locals come and use the pool.  There were a lot of rowdy teens in the pool.  You don't need a room key to use the pool, so that may be the reason.  I couldn't get into the hot tub because couples were taking turns in there doing what they do.  But all in all, it was comfortable and clean.  Free wifi.  I would stay here again if I have to go back to this apocalyptic city of heat and brimstone (it was 120 degrees when I was there)."}
{"text":"The historic Biltmore has a wonderful tour (free for its guest) which is available Tues, Thurs, and Sat at 10am. I highly recommend it if you have an hour and a half and you'd like to know of the hotel's significance among American society in days gone-by! The Gold Ballroom has Gold leafing on the ceiling, among other facts and beautiful details. Robert E Claire was our tour guide and he did an outstanding job, as he previously managed many events and fine dining functions there!  What a treat to stay at the Biltmore. Courteous staff! There was no microwave in our Valley Wing upgraded room and the in-room coffee wasn't to my liking (Keurig), but the free shuttle to the fashion park as well as the 8 pools and delicious meals made for a special stay! Again, it has lovely grounds and is iconic among the Arizonan desert!"}
{"text":"Elegant and modern and the grounds are beautiful. Frank Llyod wright fans will love the architecture its stunning."}
{"text":"We enjoyed our stay at the Biltmore.  We stayed in the Ocatilla building, which offers you the concierge lounge.  This is really a great feature.  We hung out in there each day, and enjoyed the snacks and drinks.  Also the staff is outstanding and very helpful.  My only complaint was breakfast.  It was definitely continental style and didn't offer much.  This is definitely a Waldorf Hotel.  I have said this before, and I will say it again, its old.  But the grounds are beautiful.  The architecture is amazing.  You have to stay here if you are a Frank Lloyd Wright fan.  The overall design wouldn't be my choice, but it is unique.  We liked our hotel room.  Spacious with a fridge, robes, a great tub and shower, and the bed was heaven.  We LOVED the pool.  Again, great service, nice atmosphere, clean, and lots of clean towels.  We self parked, and its a bit of a hike.  We didn't mind it, but when it is 105 outside, you are sweating by the time you reach your car.  We had a happy hour of sorts at the Wright Bar.  They don't really have happy hour here, but they do serve some smaller dishes that are options at the restaurants on site.  It was good.  They do have a car service at the hotel.  We definitely took advantage of this, as it was only 10 bucks to get to the Biltmore Mall, so we could enjoy our evening out at Capital Grille with our wine and get back safely."}
{"text":"What a place!  Love this hotel for so many reasons.  The people that work here are always always so pleasant and seem to truly care about customer service.  The pool is so relaxing and has a swim up bar, and you cant beat the smores!!  They do run specials so keep an eye out for the more affordable times.  They have also updated the rooms and every time I come here, I feel like its is new and refreshing.  The spa services are all also out of this world!"}
{"text":"just got back from a weekend here......and loved it.  the resort itself is huge and beautiful.  our room was nice and new, however the bathroom still needs a makeover.  the resort itself is very expensive (as all resorts are)....and you get hit with a ton of charges...but i still loved laying by the paradise pool with a margarita..pure heaven.    i also visited the spa and while my massage was good (minus my chatty masseuse) the locker room really needs a makeover. the shower was all rusted...yuck."}
{"text":"I am reviewing Sunday Brunch at Wrights. LOVELY and Outstanding ! James our server was a dear, the food was delish! I wish I had more room for all those wonderful desserts, Very unique menu, Veal Stroganoff. Vanilla Bean Soaked infused fruit salad with Pineapple.  Banana Cream and Caramel Brule. The cold buffet included all the standards like shrimp, italian ham, Caprese, Muffins, Scones, and Breads. Loved the Zucchini bread.  The hot menu upgrade included Lobster Eggs Benedict, Lavender Infused Waffles, Flapjacks, Organic Tortilla Chicken. It was delightful! The resort is so beautiful. Looks like a type of old school, European Castle. The lobby  is gorgeous! Parking is not that great here though. This was a lovely day treat!"}
{"text":"This is an average Hilton property at best. Old worn out fixtures and furniture. Dark, poorly lit rooms. Very old tech."}
{"text":"You can't beat this place in the summer!  The price for what you get is the best.  The rooms are clean and sharp, and the food is AMAZING.  They have a shuttle/golf cart service to get you around because it can take a while and you could get lost as things aren't labeled perfectly.  Finding some of the conference rooms can be quite difficult as they are almost hidden, but the food makes up for it.  I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"much can be said about the Biltmore...so i'll leave that to others.  i'm a fan of their sunday brunches. OMG what a treat. it was worth every penny i spent. memosas FTW!!!"}
{"text":"We were on the grounds for six days with two kids, a very family friendly resort. It was grand and lively, and comfortable. The pools were great. The keepers of the hotel were kind, and helpful, and it was 4 stars all the way. So many favorite spots- and all of which were easily accessible! The fire pits, the fountain, the lobby & hot dining spots- all beautiful. It was not a pretentious resort, it was homey. Surrounded by the beauty of the desert, it is as they say, a jewel.  The restaurants all had four star dining, and the prices were reasonable. Suggest bringing Snacks and H20- so you can spurge on other things... the husband took a yoga class and said it was great. I would have liked to, but next time.  I rarely feel at ease anywhere. Here, I felt so relaxed. We hated to leave."}
