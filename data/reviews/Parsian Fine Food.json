{"text":"My go-to take-out place! Great kabob. Perfect amount of juicy and well-done. 
Order about 15 minutes ahead, so it'll be ready by the time you get there and don't have to wait in there (not the nicest grocery store). 
Take some salad olivieh if you know what's good for you. And the olives."}
{"text":"Slightly pricey but clean, organized and great customer service. A very nice selection of Iranian junk food (like Pofak Namake) and distilled flavored waters (orange, mint, rose, etc) that are hard to find elsewhere. I would avoid the meat counter as they did not want to cut or make our ground beef  finer (necessary to make kabab). The food available for take out is delicious!"}
{"text":"Horrible persian groceries i would never come back here again. The only reason i give it a two star is cuz they have a good bakery but their variety is super expensive and you get ripped off while you can buy the same stuff from another persian grocery store which is not too far for a lot cheaper than that and the staff wont give you attitude either."}
{"text":"Friendly service. Warm and delicious food ready for takeout. I don't really do my grocery shopping there though."}
{"text":"Great customer service and friendly employees! The food is great to take out. Their fresh bread is one of the best. They also have a meat shop, very clean and fresh meat. They have fresh fruits and vegetables. Fresh juice, ice cream, nuts and pastry. Fair price and great quality! Love to go there because they make me feel valued as a customer."}
{"text":"Best Ice Cream!! I love their coffee ice cream. Pistachio ice cream is the best!! They have the best selection of nuts and snacks. No ice cream or gelato can top their ice cream. Love it!!"}
{"text":"yummmy food, fresh bread and ice cream too!.. cashiers are ACTUALLY nice here wowww. The cashier was great (she really was, nice cashiers in Persian place apparently blow my mind!?) Always good, recently it's been A++."}
{"text":"Parsian Fine Food is north of Steeles for those in that Neighbourhood.
Square Footage is relatively smaller than south of Steeles counterparts.
Newer shop to those meant its more organized and visually pleasant.
The small real-estate means no oven for fresh Barbari Breads.
There is the standard Take-out Kabob/Polo section of every Super.
Plenty of Butcher Meats and Persian Food Staples provided.

Bonus: Parking is much easier than those Supers of the south."}
{"text":"Came here on recommendation from a persian coworker.  Just came for the marinated meats to BBQ at home.  Was looking for tenderloin, sadly they were out, but had some nice looking lambchops which the friendly butcher recommended.  He was not wrong, my friends really enjoyed it.  Was full of flavour and importantly was not gamey at all.  I threw in some pork belly slices into the left over marinade juices and they turned out really good as well.   Was a little hesitant to go in at first, but everyone from the butcher to the cashier were friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"This place by far is the best take out ever compared to other Persian places. I agree that everything is pricey. I just don't check the prices :)
The best authentic Persian meals. 
I have been coming here for years and they always keep the standards high. I don't go anywhere else despite the long drive for me."}
{"text":"I've gone to a fair share of markets and snagged me some tachin, (look it up if you dunno what it is but its awesome). I've mostly had great experiences in kabob and tachin in these markets I've gone to.... This one, sooooo tastless, needed like more of everything, tasted like old, cold chicken with rice. No hint of saffron taste or yogurt, and that's what I need to be tasting in tachin..... Grrrrr what a disappointment."}
{"text":"The produce is not fresh , Breads are at least a few days old plus the prices are not the best compared to other supermarkets."}
{"text":"Do yourself a favour and enjoy the experience of shopping here.  Iranian locals helped me with my choice of pistachio nuts, there were so many different kinds to choose from.  For the first time, they had \"sour\" pistachios - I didn't know what they would be like, but they were recommended to me.  I asked the shopper who welcomed me to try one if he worked there, and he said no, but go ahead, it's our tradition, just taste whatever you like.  I tasted one, it was outstanding and different to the regular salted pistachios, so now I have a new favourite, sour.  These are also salted - I was also told they go really well with beer!  I have always been a wine drinker but since late 2010, I now and then like a beer as well.  Great combination!  Then, the store owner offered my a taste of freshly squeezed juices, the pomegranate is unbelievable, I have had many different pomegranate products, and grew up in South Africa where we had our own wild pomegranate trees.  The juice was so fresh, where else would I see a juicer designed specifically for juicing pomegranates.  I bought a large container which I consumed within two days!  No, I am not a glutton, I am 80% of the fitness of an athlete, and since cooking has been my passion since my childhood, and ingredients to me are a veritable gift that I respect with my heart and soul, I recognize great quality.  I know they must have wondered what I do with the array of nuts, including three different almonds, roasted unsalted, roasted salted, finely sliced, nibbed, well the answer is I use them in many Spanish style dishes, desserts and cakes, and quality is of paramount importance, it is worth seeking out the best available otherwise there is no point in labouring.  I use almonds in many Moroccan dishes, and also make my own hand rolled couscous, so I am very into immersifying myself in the whole experience of cooking which begins, for me, from the time one sets out to search for the ingredients and if you hit the right store, the inspiration soars and the results are heavenly.  I've been to this store once, at the end of January, and I've recommended it to friends. I noticed too that they had three different types of fresh soup, I didn't try any soup, but suggested this to a friend whom I think would benefit from this for health reasons (he always buys canned stuff which I think is full of chemicals and unhealth), these freshly made soups may just be great!  I will try them next time.  But don't go there an not walk out with great bread and pomegranate juice!  Take time to drop into this store...my hairdresser actually recommended it to me, we always discuss food and share wine  and salads made with home grown vegetables and herbs...they have had some pretty good lunches from this little store...I can't wait to tell them at my next appointment what fun I had.  The hairdressing salon recently relocated here - Axcess Salon, best hairdresser in Toronto!"}
{"text":"This is my mom's go to persian takeout place. Thanks to her, I've been feed by Parsian almost every night. Literally. So I take it upon myself to warn others that this place soaks their food in oil. Almost every soup, spaghetti and chicken dish they offer has a greasy shine to it and not in a good way.

But this place has got its good and bad. Good being they offer an interesting variety of ice cream from pomegranate to coffee. (who puts raisins in coffee ice cream though?!) Their selection of persian patisseries is decent and the supermarket is relatively clean. They offer a variety of persian goods that you wouldn't find in a typical Canadian franchise. Parking is easy to find here."}
{"text":"Rotten produce & horrible service. Purchased a bag of carrots clearly labeled $2.49 after choosing from the least rotten bag (no other grocery stores were open). At checkout, they tried to charge me $3.99! And proceeded to argue. Paid $2.49 to get home & open bag, every carrot was 80% rotten with white mold. I do no recommend this place. Dirty & Disgusting!"}
{"text":"friendly and welcoming staff, the best takeout food, pastries and freshly squeezed fruit juices."}
{"text":"I am no habitu√© of Persian supermarkets but I was running some errands here and thought I would put in my two cents. I was very intrigued by their layout. They have used the limited space quite well. The meat shop in the back seems to be the main attraction but they also have a takeout station, fruits/veggies, a juice bar, pastries, and a couple of aisles of non-perishable products from Iran. As a side note, I don't understand why anyone would want to buy Iranian shampoos but if you're going for the Andre Agassi look, they're there for you! 

Overall, they keep the place quite clean and tidy and you have space to walk around the place without concerns about bumping into people or things. I was very impressed by their small selection of fruits. I found these pluots and other hybrid fruits, which were quite ripe and delicious. Their juice bar is also very good. They juice the fruits/veggies in front of you, then bottle it and seal it to take home. I was very tempted to try the celery juice!"}
{"text":"Though Parsian Fine Food is no Super Khorak http://www.yelp.ca/biz/super-khorak-north-york#hrid:6VizCavFOIc14UlkjIY5JQ/src:self ... but I really enjoyed shopping here a lot more.

Everything here is clean, organized.. and you can find whatever you need and more in terms of Persian grocery.

Hours may be limited since they are not open 24/7.. but most nights it is open till at least 10:30 pm.

They also have a cooked food take out section and a sweet section, prices are compatible to other takeout places I been to.

But the reason why I enjoyed my experience here because of the friendly staffs.. How often that I was offered a taste of a few of their Persian ice cream without asking?? That's what I call friendly service!! And I love their drinks and ice cream section.. even their drinks, they let you sample before you buy!!"}
