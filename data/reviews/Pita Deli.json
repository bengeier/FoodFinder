{"text":"The last time I checked Arabic's don't microwave chicken........sure its packed look at the quality of the people that live in whitby hicks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I have no idea why this place is getting such high reviews. This is not shawarma. The meat is just grilled chicken breast that is microwaved. It lacked any sort of flavour.   The girl making our pita filled the whole wrap with lettuce. Like the wrap was overstuffed, falling apart and watery because of how much lettuce was in it.   I can't say anything about the owner as he barely talked to us. But the food wasn't good. Plain and simple."}
{"text":"Was a pretty disappointing visit. Place was recommended to me. Won't be back. Chicken shawarma was not really shawarma. The industry standard is for the chicken to come right off the roaster skewer. Chicken here was re-heated and microwaved in tupperware-like dish that must have been used 1000 times. That can't be good. Microwaved plastic?? Anyways, a little chicken and a pound of lettuce does not a good Shawarma make.   Friendly service though just not my cup of tea."}
{"text":"Microwaved shawarma meat... is this your best effort?  Seriously.  What proud Arabic person nukes shawarma meat and serves it to the customers?   Yes, as everyone said, the portion is giant here.  More so than anyone should be eating.  But then again, it might be twice the size, it is also twice the price.  Most pita sandwiches here are around the $8 mark, or about twice the price of a typical shawarma.  Oh, here is the kicker too.  50 cents extra for hummus?  50 cents extra for garlic sauce? 75 cents extra for baba ganoush?  This place is geared for the hicky white folks.  Surely only they would not be upset at this.  Unless, you know, they walked into a burger joint and the people there charged them 50 cents extra for relish.  And 50 cents extra for grainy mustard.  More proof of it being geared to the local population.  You can even order a falafel with honey mustard if you want.  And next to it all, you can order a pita with ham and bacon.. in a middle eastern restaurant, run by middle eastern people.  Again, what gives?  This is madness."}
{"text":"This place is awesome and price effective! You definitely get your money's worth. They don't skimp on a servings! Get your Middle Eastern favs ( shwarma, gyros, fatoush, falafel and more!) plus your deli staples (turkey, corn beef, Montreal smoke meat, egg salad, garlic chicken!"}
{"text":"One of my favourite fast food joints in Durham! This is the place to go when you feel like eating something the size of a small baby. The pitas are enormous and come in one size so bring your appetite and stretchy pants.   My go to is the Montreal smoked meat. It's kept warm and sliced fresh. Their homemade hot sauce is hot. This is someone who often thinks restaurant suicide wings are more of a medium. If you're a bit of a baby, ask for mild. Don't scoff at the measly amount they put on. If you are a seasoned chili head, ask for it hot (or medium to test it out) be prepared for face punching heat with really nice flavour. Fresh garlic sauce, fatoush and your favourite toppings and you are set!   The food would keep me coming back alone, but the owners/staff make it extra special. It's like walking into a nonalcoholic Cheers. They are friendly and one even manages to remember my husband's order every time. I am here maybe once or twice a month. That's pretty impressive!"}
{"text":"High quality home cooking with fresh ingredients, pita built to order.  The beef shawarma is addictive - cooked with spices, quickly warmed so your pita has piping hot meat & all the fresh ingredients you can handle.  I get a brown pita, beef shawarma, ask to add in the homemade baba ganoush, fattoush (salad with pita chips), extra parsley, and top it off with homemade tahini sauce.  Totally delishious!  Filling without being ridiculous.  This family owned restaurant delivers great, fresh, homemade options quickly & with great service.  It will take a few times & then they get to know your typical order.  My go to place for a tasty lunch!"}
{"text":"I was told of this Whitby hotspot that suggested I get off the 401 before heading back West into the city.  Boy am I ever glad I listened. This place had a double line of 20 ppl inside the store and 8 or so outside the door waiting to get in.  Now if this was Subway, good luck getting your lunch within your 'break'! I was out the door tho in under 5 mins!!!  I really wanted a Chicken pita, but when I saw the way they microwaved the chicken for 40 seconds I said no way. Thankfully however the freshly heated Montreal Smoked Meat saved the day.  I witnessed first hand the Montreal Smoked Meat as the meat slicer quickly ate away at the meat slab.  Stuffed into a pita and then packed w Humus, Pickles, Fresh lettuce, tomatoes, olives and cucumbers. What a dream.  $10 w a water. The pita was huge!!!!! \"that's what she said...\" but seriously, it was 3x's the size of any pita I've ever seen!  \"that's what she said...\" haha.  A must go, but not too close to your diner. Seriously, this is the measuring stick for all pita joints."}
{"text":"Was visiting from out of town and had heard some hype about this \"shawarma joint\". Seeing all the good reviews on Google, I was looking forward to trying this place.  Red flag: They place a plastic container of whichever meat you had ordered in one of the two microwaves they have at the front. At this point it's not like we could have retracted our orders but this is definitely not what I had expected.  I had ordered the chicken shawarma - which was more like just plain, unseasoned, chicken breast. My boyfriend got the gyro which actually had some flavour to it. They offer your standard toppings, but they charge extra for even hummus or garlic sauce if you choose those. They pretty much stuff the pita with their salad mix or lettuce so it ends up being huge and makes you feel like you're getting some crazy portion size.  At ~$7 for a pita, it is fairly inexpensive and it will fill you up but if you are looking for an actual shawarma, THIS IS NOT IT. I couldn't even finish mine because it ended up being pretty much just full bites of lettuce or dry chicken even though I had paid extra for the sauces. Service was typical, they pretty much just rush through your topping selections and making your pita. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"First time there and will be last time. Line up to the door???? Well you get that when you're place is the size of a washroom I see the microwave being used A LOT!!!!!! that's not fresh food at all. That old pr#$k is a rude a$% h@%e. My first time in there and the guy acts like he knows me. Get that old idiot out of there and try to learn to make fresh food, your place is a joke. The menu is to be expected...... Shit!!!!!! If you think for one minute their food is fantastic? Stop eating from your dogs dish because anything will taste good after that. DO NOT EAT HERE, go to McDonald's. Barley enough room to stand and order, if your sitting? your going to have peoples asses in your face. What a dive! Do not support this place, drive them out of business. So all in all what I'm trying to say? I really don't care for this place lol  DOWN WITH PITA DELI!!!!!!!!!!!! YOUR A JOKE!!!!!!!!!! YOUR FOOD IS CRAP!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time today for lunch and returned for dinner. Food was excellent. Service fantastic. Pricing very good. What's not to like?"}
{"text":"The best pita around! Get the garlic sauce and be cautious with the hot, but a little is a nice touch! The garlic chicken with fattoush is my go to. Their salads are also awesome and big."}
{"text":"Amazing service, fast, friendly and informative! Food is always fresh and tastes great!"}
{"text":"I judge a place on taste, value and quality. I really think I have found the perfect pita. I've visited this gem about a dozen or so times and live nowhere near Whitby.   DON'T pay attention to the poster that claims the chicken is simply microwaved. I'm not sure where she gets her hateorade but the chicken is warmed and it is incredibly tender and slow cooked beforehand.   The place is family owed, the people friendly and the tastes are incredible. Homemade sauces and the hot sauce although tasty will make you suffer as if you were with your least favourite ex. At least the sauce hurts so good.   I'm partial to the garlic chicken, but the chicken Caesar is a winner and the shawarma is a nice treat.   Worth the drive and the value is still incredible."}
{"text":"For years, I've heard how awesome Pita Deli is. It's time for me to give it a shot. Hope you're hungry, because this is no wussy pita. Thought you would have a small pita? They just don't do small. Going for the large pita? Heehee. Good luck!   Pita Deli is a locally owned, family run shop. It has some seating, but it's more of a take-out place.    I love this place. The people that work there are fun and know their pitas. When they say the hot sauce is HOT, believe them!! All of the toppings are fresh and full of flavour. The prices are very reasonable. It's perfect for lunch or supper and you will NOT be hungry after. Saving room for dessert is not an option."}
{"text":"I'm ashamed at how many times I've eaten here out of convenience. If it weren't located in the same building as my office, I would never eat here. But when lunch time creeps up on you and you suddenly are aware of the grumble in your tummy, a quick pita lunch seems like the only option. Lunchtime line ups fill the entire place but it moves pretty quickly. The proportion is unreasonably large, there's no reason to stuff the pita with that much salad in my opinion. My coworker recently mentioned that he asks for half portion and pays half price, which is something I will definitely ask for next time.   The meat is microwaved. In a plastic container. Need I say more?  The salad is worth a try though. There's something crunchy and salty in there which is something I haven't tasted in other salads and makes the salad interesting.   The staff is friendly though. The first time I ordered here I wasn't aware of all the extra costs of the toppings (see Claudia's review on the over pricing of toppings) and added on pretty much every extra sauce there was. My bill gave me a shock. When I told the server that I didn't know about the extra cost, he reduced the price to the base price and let me have the pita anyway, which was nice. But they should advertise the cost of the top toppings better.   I wouldn't recommend this place to anybody who doesn't work in the same building as Pita Deli."}
{"text":"This place is just as awesome as it was 12 yrs ago when i was a regular there.. Popped by today since i was in town and im glad i did! This place is run by a great , friendly family who are always hospitable when u walk thru their door... I recommend this place to everyone!"}
{"text":"Indeed a huge value... A monster handful of flavour! Tons of fresh ingredients and loaded with garlic with hot sauce that is indeed hot. All fresh real breast meat and plenty of it.  Have only had the chicken shawarma but it's an experience in itself and definitely one you do not want to try to eat on the run. Both hands and several napkins required.  Family staff is hugely friendly and owner Jimmy a legend of sorts... makes this a nice experience rather than a grab and go.   Limited seating but have always found one when I've been in."}
{"text":"Always good food and good service. Like to go here for work lunch breaks sometimes with colleagues from the office. Definitely fills you up. Pitas are about the size of a small newborn baby!"}
{"text":"I went here today and tried a smoked turkey pita, I have also tried the Falafel pita quite often on other occasions.   The pita's are monstrous and if were being rated on size and value would be close to 5 stars. More on that below.   The ingredients are nothing special and are what you would expect to find in a pita shop, with with an Arabic twist comprising the Shwarma component.   In the toppings selection, the item they serve the most is this pre mixed salad with a hint of sesame, tomatoes, some greens variation. But it also contained these oily deep fried bits of I don't know what, which was kind of a let down as one sort of chooses to go to a pita shop to eat healthy, not to be surprised with little deep fried pieces of something that are chilled and hiding the salad.   My biggest issue with the food was that even though I had gotten mine with no sauce, in today's experience my pita exploded and started leaking large amounts of liquid all over my lap when I wasn't even half way through it. I can understand that when making it if you want to just open the thing and stuff all sorts of stuff into it in a disorganized way, but I was stumped as to where the actual fluid came from.   I was also charged 70 cents for the beets I got on the pita and was given no warning or indicator that was an additional cost.  In my opinion, the ingredients are pretty standard and nothing special, I am pretty sure the majority if not all items come pre-made. The one area they excel in is value; but when you have to throw out one quarter of your meal because it exploded in your lap then that sort of rules out that component as a value proposition."}
{"text":"Ignore the last review. The owner and his son are great. Family run. A local haunt for the police department so quantity and quality rank high. Laughing while I ordered as the staff is funny. A giant falafal. I mean giant. I'm a big guy and it did me for two meals. The hit sauce is almost too hot. Ask for mild not medium. There is not hot hot sauce. Fresh veggies. Home made everything. Tiny. Only a few tables. Go. Trust me."}
{"text":"This place is the best. Could eat there 7days a week. Very fresh. Made in less than 60 seconds. The customer service is awesome and the food is delicious. Very busy all the time but it never takes more than a couple minutes in total to be handed your pita. They're good at what they do! Say hi to jimmy for me!"}
{"text":"This is my first 5 star review. I have been eating here for years. Every person I have suggested this spot too loves it. Beef shawarma is the best on the planet !! Hit it with there home made hot sauce (not to much) and load it up with everything including the zingy pickles. Bam you have a football sized pita made with love. Awesome family business and friendly service. Fill you up good !!"}
{"text":"This one of Whitby's treasures and well worth stopping into anytime you drive by on the 401 as it's right off the Thickson Rd. Exit. at NE the corner of Thickson and Champlain beside Don Cherry's.  Family owned and operated by the Zahid family, this small lunch counter Pita shop has VERY FRESH ingredients everyday and is a HUGE value. I eat here often as it is close to work and while often busy at prime times, the atmosphere is friendly, fun and worth a few minutes wait.  Chicken and Beef Shwarma, Falafel, Fatoush, assorted coldcut combo's, chicken and tuna salad all of which are HUGE and range from $5-$7 it's a bargain.  Yes I am giving this place a rave review as everytime I go here I am treated first class, as a person and as a friend, which is not what you get at the fast food dumps our society has sprung up at every major intersection and who are only interested in Corporate profits.  Final thing - If you like Hot sauce try theirs, but be warned it's VERY hot.  Cheers."}
{"text":"I miss this place but anytime I'm in the neighbourhood I always try to stop by for a pita. This is probably in my opinion one of the best spots in Durham region. Make sure you stop by the Montreal smoked meat pita is one of my favourites."}
{"text":"Love their huge portion & yummy sauce!  I just can't get enough ! Ask them to cut your sandwich in half so you can save one for later ! Their salad is huge & filling. I also, bought a bag of fattoush ($5) Again huge bagful of goodies for me !"}
{"text":"Was introduced to this family run spot about 5 years ago and it's a must visit anytime I am in town  So fresh and delicious and worth every penny ...but not expensive!!! Friendly service even when they are lined out the door"}
