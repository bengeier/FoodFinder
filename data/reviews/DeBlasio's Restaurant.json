{"text":"It took a few minutes for the host to come up to seat us (It wasn't busy, either), but once we were seated, we were served fairly quickly. The place was a little more on the expensive side, so I was thankful I had a $10 off coupon. Our waitress was friendly enough, and we just beat the dinner rush, so in general, it was a good experience."}
{"text":"Unassuming looks on the outside, but there's a reason why they're packed night after night and in business for many years. Some traditional Italian fare, reasonable prices and some creastive twists on the nightly specials menu. Pepper corn Steak, Diablo Pasta, fresh bread and try their house dressing on your salad. Grandma has to be back in that kitchen somewhere, and she knows how to cook!"}
{"text":"My family and I tried the restaurant for lunch, after having been there for dinner many times. Very disappointing. Slow service, and my grandaughter's pizza was not made right the first time (the waitress said it did not \"set\", whatever that means). We had to wait another 20 minutes for the little girl's pizza, with no compensation or real apology. Of course, by the time it came, she could not eat it, and we ended up throwing it away. No a pleasant experience for lunch. Sandwiches had a lot of bread, then served with fries, it was just too much carbs.  Not that tasty."}
{"text":"I love this place. Great Italian. Generous portions. The penne Mona Lisa is delicious. Waitstaff is lovely."}
{"text":"I live nearby, on any given day this is my top 5 italian place to eat. I am in boycott as of july 3rd, when don deblasio treated us great disrespect. He triple booked our table. Basically made an effort to run us out. Haven't been back since"}
{"text":"Not sure if we went on a \"off\" night but I wont be going back. I really wanted to try this place and like it. The service was very slow. We ordered the stuffed breadsticks, everyone said they were great, Im not a huge cheese person and there was a ton of cheese. I also got a soup and salad, the wedding soup was bland, I love wedding soup, but I didnt even finish it here. The dressings dont seem to be homemade either which bummed me out. I had the chicken Milense and it was a nice portion and pretty good. If I had to come back I would order that again, but skip everything else."}
{"text":"Surprised this place got such good reviews.It just seemed like bland, lukewarm food and tasteless sauce to me. The ambience left alot to the imagination too. Server seemed to have too many tables to keep up with. I feel like Olive Garden has more flavor than the food I had here."}
{"text":"If you're above the age of 70 or can't bear the thought of opening a can of jarred spaghetti sauce and boil a few frozen raviolis, then this place will do. Otherwise, do yourself a favor and avoid. In dire needs of modernization, food and decor wise.  I don't understand all the great reviews."}
{"text":"First and presumably last visit. Late afternoon lunch, slow service to greet& serve food. Lunch special fried pork hop and mash potatoes. Ugh. Stiff instant potatoes and bland chop. Salt alone was a great improvement. Chicken&sausage over pasta dinner was limp and lifeless. Again salt was a step in a better direction but it could/should have had peppers, garlic, sundried tomatoes to bring some life into a big bowl of spinach and old pasta. Maybe it works for the seniors who seem to be the biggest part of the clientele but not for us."}
{"text":"We have been going there for years and years and it is consistently one of the best restaurants in Pittsburgh. They have an excellent chef. You will never be disappointed with the food. The soup is delicious,too."}
{"text":"This is an aged Italian place in a strip mall that has its dedicated regulars, but leaves new customers baffled as to the loyalty. The place was packed on a Friday night but we were able to get a table for four. Note: there is no printed kids menu but they have the usual fair.
After we were seated we sat. And sat. About 10-15 minutes goes by without a server stopping by. The hostess who seated us noticed that we hadn't had a server yet and said she's get someone to is ASAP but we still sat. Finally our waitress comes. She didn't give her name but was friendly to our two kids. 
Note about the seating- hope for a booth because the tables are THISCLOSE to one another. My husband got bumped by servers all night (none of whom apologizes) and I could hear every word of the tables conversation next to us as I was practically in their laps. 
The bread was fair- kind of dried out. The wedding soup was a disappointment - which is a travesty for an old school red sauce joint. Funky taste and bland. My husband's salad was a decent size.
For our entrees, the kids both had spaghetti and meatballs. They ran out of milk, which isn't realize excusable when there is a Giant Eagle in the same plaza. The kids portions were generous but expensive. My husband had chicken Parmesan, a huge serving. He had roasted potatoes as a side (other sides were pasta or veggies), which were served in a small applesauce sized dish and were not very good. I had the homemade ravioli. The dough was heavy and gummy, and slightly undercooked. The sauce was typical red sauce.
Took forever to get our check, of course. There was a manager walking around but not stopping at any tables.
I would go here again if someone really wanted to go here, but I won't be hurrying back. The price point is too high for fair food, sitting in the lap of our neighbor, and this price point."}
{"text":"I never give one star and really tried to give it two but... Ohh where to begin...

Ordering: our waitress seemed less than enthused to take our order. We gave very specific instructions on how to split the bill from the very beginning as we were traveling for business. We put our entire order in at the beginning because we were very hungry. 

Appetizer: the only reason I really really wanted to give this more than one star. The stuffed breadsticks are HUGE; I wouldn't call them fantastic...They are good, more pepperoni and a little less cheese would make them great. The breadstick bread had a Zeppoli flavor to it. Def worth trying. 

This is where everything just goes wrong... 

Our drinks ran dry... Salads took over 25 minutes to come out. Mind you... We put our entire order in when we got there. When we were done with our salads the bread came. Call me crazy but when you go to an Italian restaurant isn't this like the first thing that comes??!?! Just sayin. 

And we sat... And sat. People who came in after us had finished eating, paid and left. We asked to speak to someone. Our waitress comes over 10 minutes later to explain that they have a new computer system and out of the whole restaurant our order was the only one to not make it to the back. It wasn't terribly busy so how this went unnoticed is beyond me. A manager later comes to reiterate what the waitress had said. He apologized and then said our order is on a rush. 

1 hour plus into sitting...Our main course: 
Two stuffed lobster tails: small portion, flavor was just okay. 

Chicken Deblasio: in one word- bland. I asked about this when ordering because I was stuck between this and veal. Being a fan of Marsala sauces I decided to go this route. There was no Marsala, not even a hint of it. Tasted like boiled chicken with flavorless brown gravy, a few mushrooms and one slice of sandwich sized cheese cut in four draped on top. Defiantly not worth the price. 

They gave us two desserts on the house. I will say this they do shine in this department the chocolate and raspberry cheesecake were very good. 

Paying: as expected the whole bill was on one check and not two as requested. In an ever so painful decision to dummy down the payment process and avoid further confusion/mistake we made one payment on each card at separate times to ensure they were appropriately portioned as requested. 

I would say: It is safe to go there for coffee and cake... Maybe even a drink. But for dinner I would check somewhere else out. Perhaps my experience was a total fluke and it was just their worst night ever with a new computer system. And maybe the chef downed a scalding hot drink yielding his tastebuds useless and unable to realize that the food had no flavor? Who knows??!?! But you have been warned."}
{"text":"Its all our YELPER'S parents restaurant. Great Italian food. Do yourself a favor and sit in bar area. A very older crowd who looks like they are getting ready to head out to a Sinatra concert. Order yourself a manhattan or highball....sit back and enjoy the scene. Quite entertaining."}
{"text":"Chicken DeBlasio is unbelievable!!!!!  The stuff breadsticks are from scratch and the service is extremely extremely professional!!!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! I would suggest making reservations on the weekend though. There is for sure an older crowd there, but please do not let that discourage you- they know good food! There wedding soup is very chunky if you're into that. I, for one, like a mkre broth based soup but if you love a lot if your soup then you'll love it! The flavor is great. I got a special they had on this particular day- filet and lobster Romano! IT WAS AMAZING. I have truly never had lobster this great in my life. I would recommend it to anyone- although it was a special, I would call and ask when they have it, it's to die for. All and all, this place has great, authentic food. I am very Italian so I don't like chain Italian restaurants, so let me tell you this is the real deal!!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed myself here,  tried it for the first time.  The whole staff is so friendly and work together and help each other out. I had a steak very good. I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Thanks for the Christmas Eve food poisoning!  Been throwing up and...other...since getting home from dinner."}
{"text":"I'll start with a disclaimer:  My father-in-law is a friend of Donny  (the owner) and the last time we were there for Sunday dinner, Donny plied us with free booze.  But I won't let that and the \"make you an offer you can't refuse\" look of the place sway my judgement.

Let's make this simple:  I eat there at least once a month, sometimes as many as four times per month.  I took my wife on our first date there, where I serenaded her with \"Hotel California\" on the way back from a scrumptious meal.  But anyone who's read my reviews knows that I wouldn't keep going back for nostalgia alone.  No, siree Bobby, the place has to be good.

And it is.

Awesome pepperoni rolls, best I've ever had.  Crispy outside, chewy oowey goodness inside, and hot pepperoni oil dripping down your fingers leaving a trail of second degree burns down to you knuckles.  Breaded zuchini that makes you want to cry tears of joy.  Wedding soup that would make you leave your wife on your wedding day.  And entrees that range from decent to \"oh, god, YES\" ogasmically good.

If you go, tell Donny that I sent you.  Otherwise he'll break my legs the next time he sees me."}
{"text":"I gave this three stars only b/c they do not offer a gluten free menu and there is not much to eat here. I ordered a pittsburgh salad and I couldn't even get the fries b/c they had a flour coating...the fries make the salad. 

They have decent stuffed hot peppers, their steaks arent bad. 

Decently priced, if you go for lunch expect to have a long lunch. They are fairly slow."}
{"text":"Less than a mile from our house, sometimes my wife and I like to have weekend date nights at DeBlasio's.

Our first time there, about six years ago, we unknowingly sat next to Marc-Andre Fleury and his date. This was long before I knew who he was or even cared about hockey, and I think our waiter was amused by how star struck we weren't.

It's a little dressier than a lot of places around here, where blue jeans and Steelers jerseys are a year-round affliction for the local bros ... and some women.

Our most recent trip was Valentine's Day 2014, and we've spent other occasions there as well. New Year's Eve a few years ago with a group of about 10 friends stands out, for example. 

The food and service at DeBlasio's are both better than most of the Italian restaurants I've tried between NE Ohio and SW Pennsylvania. The decor makes me nostalgic for my grandparents house in Youngstown during the late 70s or early 80s, and the dining rooms are always kept clean, even on busy Friday and Saturday nights.

Thing is, for occasions like Valentines Day and New Year's Eve, the menu is (understandably, but disappointingly) limited. This helps the kitchen and waitstaff keep turning tables over -- I get it -- but DeBlasio's regular menu features a much greater variety of excellent fare.

Something I always try to order is the greens & beans with hot sausage appetizer. I can't really overstate how much I love it. I also recommend checking the board on the way in, because the daily features are often home to my favorites, like the Osso Bucco.

I'd really like to go on a weeknight sometime soon, maybe try a few different glasses of wine. Maybe get a steak. Buon appetito!"}
{"text":"I have be going to DeBlasio's for at least 15 years.  Quality of food and service is consistent.  No surprises.  Prices are reasonable and daily specials are a value.  Can't give the restaurant a four or five as I believe the interior needs a serious makeover.  Too dark and rather dated."}
{"text":"Don't let the strip mall setting fool you (or the mostly senior crowd). Deblasio's offers good food and excellent service. The inside is a little crowded but nicely decorated.

Our waiter was excellent - my friend doesn't eat the crust on her bread, when the waiter brought more bread he brought her 2 pieces with the crust already cut off.
He also overheard me saying that I expected  the sauce on my pasta to be a bit thicker and looked at it. He said it normally was thicker and offered to take it back to have them thicken it.

You can choose what type of noodle you want with any pasta dish. I would recommend getting any pasta dish with their fettuccine.  The fettuccine definitely had the best texture and flavor over the penne and angel hair.

We tried the

-fettuccine alfredo with shrimp - Cheesy, creamy and smooth
-Chicken Romano, with a side of angel hair - Tood Romano and eggy flavor in the chicken. 
-prime rib with roasted potatoes - Tender, juicy, huge portion. It has a lot of black pepper.
-shrimp and lobster florentine- Excellent, lots of shrimp and probably a 3 Oz lobster tail on top.

We didn't get the fried zucchini, but almost every table around us did. It looked really think, lightly breaded, and perfectly fried. I would definitely try it next time."}
{"text":"This place is famous in the s hills and it was PACKED when we arrived without a reservation, but they were able to see this immediately anyway. The tables are really packed together in the dining room was a bit loud but this is to be expected of a very popular restaurant. The interior was cute it looks like how my grandmother would decorate her house with Christmas lights and refund the walls it wasn't tacky but it's definitely geared towards an older crowd.  don't bring a hot date here, but do bring your grandma here for dinner.. The service was very slow and I think the prices are just a little bit pricey,u do get excellent food

. My bf had chicken parmigiana and I had the chicken Milanese. We came here because we had an enjoyable coupon and I'm really glad we did because the food was outstanding. If I go back which I certainly will probably get the chicken parmigiana it was to die for! I just like the chicken Milanese though as it was light and lemony. I recommend this place and I've said it before I'll say it again I have read new respect for strip mall restaurants!"}
{"text":"Unbelievably disappointing.  My dad and I drove from the city out here because he used to love DeBlasio's.  This meal was awful, and the service was worse.

The bread that started the meal was good.  We both got wedding soup, which was acceptable as well.  We ordered fried zucchini to start, which was huge and not bad but nothing special.  

I ordered the manicotti, and my dad ordered stuffed shrimp with a side of pasta.  However, I hate half of a tube of manicotti and threw the rest away when I got home.  The sauce was DISGUSTING.  Too much pepper and no real taste.  My dad ate a bit of the pasta and threw it away as well.  He said the shrimp was rubbery and there was no crab in the stuffing.  At close to $20 a plate, this place sucked.

On top of all of this, our waitress was rude and nasty.  She was unpleasant through the entire meal, refused to refill our waters, and didn't ask when both meals went untouched.  She boxed the meals without asking if we wanted them, and made passive aggressive comments throughout the meal.

This place is awful.  If you are going to insist on coming, order a fried zucchini and go somewhere else for dinner.  This is a step below an Olive Garden.  The only people in here are senior citizens that have been coming for years.  Avoid."}
{"text":"I've never eaten at the restaurant, however, we have ordered delivery a few times and can't say that I'm too likely to dine in. The Italian calzone was pretty average, very soggy upon delivery, but heated up nicely in the oven the next day. Same with the stuffed breadsticks, pretty greasy, but tasty. By far the most disappointing dish that we have experienced here, were the greens and beans. My Girlfriend is a Gn'B freak, having ordered them from numerous Local Italian restaurants, and the ones offered from DeBlasio's are egregiously terrible. I took one bite and spit them out. The beans have no flavor and turn to mush when bitten, as is the case with the onions and banana peppers. The greens are slimy and bitter, and the sausage is dry and exceedingly mediocre. At first she thought she could fix them, but after a few more bites she conceded and we threw them away. Pittsburgh has a plethora of Italian restaurants, some good, many bad, and I would put DeBlasio's in the lower echelon."}
{"text":"The food here is excellent!!! However the employees over in the lounge area are FAR from friendly!The server Colleen is simply terrible SO ignorant , if I had a dollar for every time she rolled her eyes I'd be quite rich. I have never felt more unwelcome at a restaurant my entire life. I was the head server in a country club and her actions made me cringe. Foods great but not worth how uncomfortable I felt eating it due to COLLEEN. She should not be in this industry, at ALL!  Tip to all sit in the restaurant NOT the lounge!!"}
{"text":"In an unassuming strip mall, sits this family owned gem. Best manicotti I've had in years.. fabulous wedding soup. Anything I've tried at this Italian restaurant has always been top notch. Good service, great prices. GO GO GO."}
{"text":"The stuffed breadsticks were phenomenal and HUGE! I wish I could find stuffed crust pizza around Pittsburgh that isn't a chain, but this fit the bill! We could have made a meal out of the breadsticks alone. The wedding soup was awesome too. I had the shrimp and lobster tail florentine for my entree, and loved it. Dessert was a snowball cake that was very good with whipped cream icing which I prefer over buttercream. All in all, a great meal with big portions ( I had to take half of my food home) and nice service. Loved this place."}
{"text":"I grew up very nearby and for whatever reason we've only been here a few times.

During a recent trip home we were looking for a casual dinner and were craving Italian food. 

We were treated to a delicious, homemade feast. The \"famous\" stuffed breadsticks are glorious. They are HUGE, almost like stromboli. The marinara for dipping was chunky and fresh.

I really enjoy wedding soup and theirs did not disappoint. Very classic.

For dinner I had the cheese ravioli. The portion was excellent and each ravioli was plump. 

The cost was incredibly reasonable for three of us for dinner.

The restaurant is in the old Virginia Manor shopping center next to the Giant Eagle. The decor is not fancy (suspended ceiling, murals on the walls), but it's extremely comfortable and has a family/locals atmosphere. The bar has several well-placed flat screen TVs and was filled.

Our service was a little slow, but it was friendly. 

I can't believe I wasted so many years in Scott Township not eating here."}
{"text":"From the outside, DeBlasio's doesn't look all that special, but don't let looks deceive you!  It's much, much bigger on the insdie than it seems and the wait without reservations on a friday night is completely reasonable (15-20 minutes)- and you can wait next door at the bar for your table.  The food is excellent- I highly recommend the appetizers! Prices are also reasonable- a spaghetti dinner is under $18- and the portion is large enough that you will have left overs for two meals to take home!"}
{"text":"Started off the meal with fried zucchini which was great.  Lightly breaded, perfectly fried, not greasy at all.  It definitely tantalized my appetite and made me excited for what was next.  All entrees come with soup or salad, and I went for the salad option with the house made Italian dressing.  It was good, not like oh.my.god good, but it was your average house salad. I skipped out on the bread to save room for dinner.

Turns out I should have eaten the bread.  I heard it was great and my food was...eh.  I ordered veal parmigiana.  Huggeeee piece of veal, pounded nice and thin, just how I like it, and thinly breaded.  However, there was basically no sauce on it, though there was a generous portion of cheese.  The side of pasta was absolutely bad.  It tasted how pasta tastes in a chafing dish after 3-4 hours, dry, pasty, with gelatinous sauce.  Way too much oregano in the sauce as well.  If you have the slightest hint of heartburn, I guarantee that oregano is gonna talk back to you.  We ordered a chocolate mousse cheesecake, but found out they were out of it.  Ordered Limoncello cake, which was light and fluffy, but basically tasted like something you could buy at Sam's Club.

Decor was dated.  They could not fit one more table or chair in there if the wanted.  It was clean and had that \"hometown\" feel to it, but it definitely didn't serve up any sort of remarkable ambiance.  The biggest saving grace was our server.  He had been there forever and knew the history of the place, got our large group's orders correct, and never seemed to sweat it when it got busy.

Overall, I don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"When I think of Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin and the rest of the Rat Pack sitting in a private room of a restaurant after a performance, I think of DeBlasio's. Dark paneled walls, large paintings of Italy , dimly lit, and veal dishes out the ying yang. I come here when I want to indulge in cooking like grandma cooked. Here, frying is not bad like say a large order of fries at the O in Oakland. I had a dish of veal, lightly sauteed in a little olive oil after dusted with a little flour, lightly seasoned, and served still sizzling. The only added touch by me was a squeeze of fresh lemon and the dish was complete. This is the only way to eat veal. Please never let me hear of anyone slathering veal with sauce and cheese. A side of green beans and a salad and my meal was complete."}
{"text":"Great italian food! Don't be discouraged by the location-this place has great food and a unique italian restaurant feel inside."}
{"text":"Food was absolutely fantastic. I had spaghetti with homemade marinara and a hot sausage link that was the special. We also had the stuffed breadsticks that were quite possibly the best pepperoni roll I'd ever had. You could tell it was a 30 year old Italian restaurant with the classic decor and white table cloths. Fantastic experience for both myself and my wife. Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Simply divine, I almost cant put into words how wonderful the food is.  Great atmosphere, though the murals of Italy on the wall are just a tad cliche.  Seriously great food, I ate way more than I normally would simply because the food was so good.  I started with the homemade wedding soup, it was chock full of spinach, nice healthy green spinach not gross wilted stuff.  Not too salty like commercially produced soups, everything in it was so fresh.  For my entree I had the Veal Milanese, it was simple and elegant.  They actually had quit e a few veal entrees on the menu so I am assuming it is one of their specialties.  I topped it all off with Tiramisu and I was in heaven.  I felt like I was going to burst and probably ate a whole weeks worth of calories, but it was so worth it.

Service could have used a little work, I was in a party of 7 and either the waitress or kitchen staff lost an order.  Otherwise everything was excellent."}
{"text":"I returned to DeBlasio's after an absence of more than three years and I am glad I did.  I wish the restaurant served pizza in the dining room during dinner, but unless it is slow, one must go to the bar for it.  That turned out to be fine and it enabled me and my significant other to avail ourselves of delicious food at bargain happy hour prices: $2.50 for draft beers, $5.00 for a delicious and ample order of fried zucchini, and one of the best pizzas in the area, $13.99 for a twelve-cut large and just $1.00 for each excellent topping.  The restaurant was very generous with the toppings.  The high-priced item that we enjoyed was a Pittsburgh tradition, the pecan ball.  It was $6.99, but it was scrumptious and enormous, plenty for two.  We shall return!  Bravo!"}
{"text":"Nice neighborhood place. A little dated. Older crowd. Food is excellent. Bartender was nice.
Had the salad named for owner. Very tasty. Good

Stopped in for a third time, bar was half full, nobody behind the bar. Older crowd gossiping. Waited 5 minutes, then left. Poor, actually no service. Not going back."}
{"text":"Our tale of two Italian restaurants concludes with a trip to the South Hills for a lesson in tradition. 

A weeknight stop at the Virginia Manor Giant Eagle gave us a blessed opportunity to try DeBlasio's, its durable shopping plaza neighbor, for the first time.

DeBlasio's is one of those decades-old suburban restaurants that is taken for granted by area residents and is almost unknown to outsiders. To dismiss it for that reason or for appealing to more mature patrons is folly as Deblasio's serves up classic dishes made by and for the most ardent of gastronomers. 

Our starter, entrees, and desserts were all so nourishing and rewarding that I will ignore the extraneous: A dry baked potato and a somewhat limp salad dressed with a timorous vinaigrette. 

With those small gaffes kicked away, I shall concentrate on what made this meal legitimate and noteworthy. 

Beginning this festival was a pair or DeBlasio's \"Famous\" Stuffed Breadsticks, and if I had been dining alone and short on funds, this appetizer, a salad, and dessert would have made for an ample supper. As large as tipstaves, and loaded with deli-style pepperoni and impossibly gooey and stringy provolone cheese, the crust of each \"stick\" was akin to a savory funnel cake, crackling on the outside until our teeth hit the meaty, molten, milky core. An aromatic and profoundly aperitive marinara sauce was provided as a condiment. 

Feeling kingly, I treated myself to The Neptune Platter, a quintet of seafood delicacies presented to me in a broiling, aged, seasoned metal plate.

A Roll Call is in Order: Broiled Lobster Tail, Broiled Shrimp, Broiled Crabcake, Baked Sole, and Steamed Little Neck Clams.

The lobster tail was impeccably cooked with little shrinkage, no rubbery texture, and nothing but bovine mouthfeel and pelagic essence left behind, all of it complimented, illuminated by the presence of that liquid sunshine. The shrimp worked much the same sorcery. Plump, they popped when met with incisors and canines, making for the lobster's perfect partner.  Resembling tiny flowers, the diminutive size of the clams belied large, coastal flavors. The Crabcake was a big, fat clinic in making such a thing greatly satisfying and wealthy without the use of jumbo lump, the fibrous backfin or special (?) being put to terrific use with hardly any filler to be found. The tame, flaky, dainty, and chameleonic sole absorbed the vim of the other items splendidly and held an amazing surprise when lacerated with my fork: More of that sumptuous, unctuous, scrumptious crabmeat. 

The homemade dessert were so ornate, DeBlasio's might do well to open a bakery as a side business. Our deft, uptown, veteran server, one who obviously hails proudly from The Old School and has likely seen all there is to see and more, brought to us a tray of allurement. One look at that wedge of Triple Chocolate Cake made me forget about all else, including tiramisu. 

Buttercream, ganache, mousse, a moist cocoa batter, fudge, salt, sugar, whipped cream to reduce the decadence a notch -- it was all here in spades, the Ace of Spades that is. This manner of cake is nothing new to me, but DeBlasio's take may well be its apex. 

Kay opted for the more angelic Snowball Cake which concealed its dark foundation with winter-white whipped cream and coconut shavings. Finishing this for Kay was soul-cleansing after dancing with Belial. 

Finished with our meals, we basked in the afterglow of a monumental chowdown, gazing at the Christmas lights and paintings of Italian villages on the walls, pondering the whist preciousness of a humble, off-the-perimeter, family-oriented, long-standing, surf-and-turf ethnic establishment in the face of so much change, fashion, and new blood in the Pittsburgh metro area's food scene."}
{"text":"My coworker and I have frequented since we moved our office near DeBlasio's around two years ago.  We have had mostly great experiences, especially when sitting down to eat.  

Takeout, however is always a disaster.  About a year ago we ordered a Caeser Salad with shrimp to-go, and it was served with the dressing. When we called to let them know, we received a lot of attitude and were told \"it's always served dressed.\"  To-Go salads should always have the dressing served on the side.  You don't know if someone is planning on eating it right away.  

Today, we ordered the same salad and were charged $7.95 for the shrimp on top of the $8.50 for the salad.  Again I called and explained that the online to-go menu showed $11.95 TOTAL for the Shrimp Caesar Salad and was told (with attitude again) that they have new menus.  I suggested that they make sure that the online menus are updated, because they are obviously wrong.  Again, with attitude I was told \"they are in the process of updating them.\"  This is the age of the internet, that should be put up simultaneously with the roll out of in-house menus.  

Additionally, I did not receive a side of fries with my sandwich, which the online menu clearly stated.  When I noted this on the phone, I didn't receive an apology, just an \"ok.\"

We will NOT be making to-go orders in the future, but I will commend the ladies in the bar area for their excellent service whenever we do eat-in."}
{"text":"We love this place.  Their food is wonderful, and the service is great. The interior is charming, even if it hasn't been updated in a while.  The bar is a total hoot at lunchtime, with the local characters.  The eggplant Parmesan is a favorite."}
