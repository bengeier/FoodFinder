{"text":"Went back with friends for Taco Happy Hour (3-5pm on weekdays) and we order and share 18 T's in total, 2 Hot Chocs, 1 Alfajor and 1 juice for a total of...$43. Pretty sweet deal:  1.- Tacos al Pastor (Marinated Porc + Pinapple)= Solid 8.5 out of 10.   2.- Tongue Tacos (Marinated beef tongue)= Pretty safe bet, over & over. The only place I know in Mtl where you can get them 9.5/10.  3.- Tacos de Suadero (Beef from the intermediate part of the cow between the belly and the leg)= Great discovery, crunchy, but juicy, just perfect 10/10.  Overall great service, fast & reliable!"}
{"text":"good tacos, good ppl, authentic touch, fan of the burrito and chilaquiles, pretty good prices too"}
{"text":"I found it pricely and not real mexican tacos, but I recognize that Mexican ingredients are not easy to find here. So it's just another option from my perspective."}
{"text":"Very delicious food and great service too! Their guacamole is amazing and their tacos are really good."}
{"text":"un restaurant sympa et sans prétentions, une cuisine savoureuse, généreuse et peu dispendieuse. Le service est  rapide, la nourriture est bien cuisinée et fraiche, par contre, le cadre fait très cantine et ne donne pas envie de s'éterniser d'autant qu'il y a toujours beaucoup de monde. On y va pour un repas authentique sans chichi donc une adresse à retenir."}
{"text":"Très bon restaurant mexcain! Seul côté négatif c'est le prix un bon exagéré juste pour 2 petit tacos mais le gout est la! En plus il font la livraison!"}
{"text":"Le service sur la terrasse est long et la serveuse oublie tout. Mais une fois le repas arrivé, c'était vraiment très bon!"}
{"text":"Very spacious restaurant/grocery store. It offers authentic Mexican cuisine. Ordered the beef taco. Disappointed I couldn't mix and match tacos to be able to try different flavours. Price in terms of quality/value isn't that great. Did enjoy the complimentary nacho's with the three different sauces, the waiter warned me that 911 sauce was very spicy, but to me tabasco sauce is spicier. Also had their churros, they only had plain but it tasted good.  L. John Dory Twitter: @LJohnDory"}
{"text":"After 1h 53 min waiting for my order, my cold tacos arrived. Small disgusting overpriced dishes. Don't waste your time and money here.   Basura de comida."}
{"text":"Typique restaurant mexicain sans flafla! Miam!"}
{"text":"So strange and disappointing. After reading such great reviews, we were super excited to try this place. I had high hopes because I don't mind if places aren't really fancy. Things started off well enough. The guacamole was tasty but came with maybe 12 nacho chips... Our meals came and maybe it was just a bad night but our meals were really salty. Also the tamales arrived about 5 minutes or more before our daughter's quesadilla so we just sat there waiting. We never got water either, and my hopes that this was going to be a cheap, tasty night out were dashed with a $50 bill. We'll give it another shot but might just stay away from the tamales and guacamole. I'm willing to give it the benefit of the doubt that it was just an off night."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place based on a recommendation but it didn't really live up to the hopeful expectation.  It's practically around the corner from Jean-Talon market. It's sort of an expanded hole in wall, indoor taco stand, and mini grocery store all in one. They have quite a familiar menu of items like tacos, burritos and even pozole.   I was gonna go for the tacos al pastor but I decided to try the gordita instead. I'll start with the sides first: the rice was not a traditional arroz rojo, it was yellow and had more of a saffron flavor. The beans were (canned) black refried beans - nothing special. The guacamole had too much lime and although I do prefer a good pico the gallo in the guac it appeared to have sour cream mixed in there as well.   The gordita: it was not a typical chicharron prensado gordita, instead it was stuffed with shredded pork along with lettuce, sour cream, onion, etc., and then doused with more sour cream on top. Typically some of the flavor comes from the chicharron prensado in this case I struggled to find it.   We had a large party so they gave us two small chip baskets but no refills. I ordered an Horchata with my meal but they never brought it out. They finally remembered to ask if I still wanted it after all the plates had been cleared but at that point it was too late.   I would like to go back and try the tacos - maybe that'll be a better experience -overall but as a first timer it was rather disappointing."}
{"text":"Great mexican restaurant in jean talon market. Great service too. Our waiter forgot to bring us guacamole, and when we reminded him, he apologized, brought it, and then brought us churros on the house."}
{"text":"Le resto demeure très abordable mais la qualité de la nourriture est clairement en baisse. La guacamole est moins bonne que l'an passée et le porc des tacos all pastor goûtait un peu le brûlé. Il existe de meilleur option ailleurs en ville."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in Montreal for sure!  Real deal! Loved the little market inside :)"}
{"text":"Un bon petit boui-boui mexicain sans prétention, mais qui sert d'excellents plats bien mijotés, goûteux et peu coûteux. Pour à peu près 15$, vous mangerez à votre faim, avec un dessert mexicain typique et un café.  Les entrées / amuse-gueules nacho 3 couleurs nous font patienter...et transpirer la langue avec 3 sauces : douce, forte et extra forte! - pas de medium! :-)  Grande variété de tacos  - ils en servent un délicieux avec de la langue de boeuf!"}
{"text":"Restaurant mexicain-latinos, face au marché Jean Talon. Accueil sympas, service agréable, plats excellents et assez copieux. Les prix sont raisonnables, tout est fait devant vous à la minute. A essayer sans hésitation."}
{"text":"A lucky find thanks to yelp! Delicious food. Waitstaff did not speak a lot of English but certainly tried to help and were very friendly. Cheap and surprisingly good food. Would certainly go again if I was in the area."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Wasn't able to stop eating. Never had such an authentic Mexican  food ever in my life. Not to be missed at all"}
{"text":"Good wholesome Mexican food near the Jean Talon market. I tried the fish ceviche which was fresh and cool, perfect on a hot day, a little spicier would have made it even better but then again it was a hot day. The quesadillas are very good with perfectly caramelized onions and peppers and just the right amount of cheese to meat ratio. My husband had the lamb tacos which were equally great. This place is not a fancy place but a great stop for lunch after shopping or even just to pick up a quick taco or 2. We really enjoy this little gem near the market. They don't serve any \"cervezas\" there but will let you go next door to the SAQ and bring a can over... Definitely worth a try!!!"}
{"text":"I was really glad to discover this restaurant while browsing in the lovely Jean Talon market on a lazy saturday morning. The restaurant is on the north side of the market, just across the street.  There were four of us and the restaurant wasn't quite busy. So we sat at a table by the street and the friendly waitress went over the menu. It was a nice break from French and I struggled to revive my Spanish.  We got four different dishes, I ordered the plate of the day (see picture) and it did remind me of eating at roadside comida corridas in Mexico city. A mix of three meats (pork, chicken, beef), sauteed vegetables, salad, beans, rice and assorted tortilla chips with mild, medium and spicy salsa. We washed it down with a glass of agua jamaica.  I'd certainly recommend eating here. :-)"}
{"text":"Fresh, authentic, delicious! When I visited from New York this past July, this was my absolute favorite place to eat. A short metro ride from Mont-Royal where I was stayed, this was really a treat! I have family from Mexico and i've somehow developed a standard to \"authentic\" Mexican food. From the homemade salsa picante to the excellent guacamole...just fantastic. The food was not greasy at all, the portions were just right and the prices were very reasonable considering the area. I was with a large group of friends and called ahead for a group of 10 at their busiest hour (and they get BUSY), about 12 -1pm and despite the hour, they were extremely friendly and accommodating. They take pride in cleanliness and really care about your experience. The location was fabulous too, right after dinner we check out the Marche and got some fresh fruits for the hotel :) I'd highly recommend !"}
{"text":"J'ai regretté d'y être entré. J'avais froid et je suis entré parce que j'avais le goût de manger de la nourriture d'Amérique latine pour réconforter un moment de solitude. Les enchiladas n'étaient pas mauvais, mais le service trop cavalier laissait à désirer. J'ai senti qu'on me manquait de respect sans raison apparente. Je ne fais de misère à personne au restaurant, d'habitude. Je ne fais que commander, manger et partir. Parfois j'aime échanger avec les personnes qui travaillent, mais ce n'est pas une nécessité ni toujours convenable.  Caballeros que trabajaban ayer. No se imaginen que no se entiende el español, aunque solo venimos para comer, hablando les con otro idioma. ¿Qué sirve hablar con la gente con un tono amable si el secundó siguiente se llena la cocina del contrario? Faltaban al servicio madurez, respeto, mentes abiertas, humildad. Afortunadamente para Us, estos se consiguen."}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong, the food is really good and this was my to go to place for tacos in my hood but they really need to get it together and I'll have to go elsewhere. Every single time there's something wrong: - Terrible service - Main dishes sometimes served with sides (rice and salad) but sometimes not (why?!?) - Got an order delivered last night and only had 3 tacos in my plate instead of the 4 promised; how can a cook make a mistake like that? Blows my mind   It goes on and on; hopefully they'll make some adjustments in order to improve consistency of the service."}
{"text":"Really good and authentic, I love this place, I'm Mexican."}
{"text":"Je préfère plutôt les sandwichs !  Mais j'y vais de temps en temps"}
{"text":"Ordered 4 things: tortilla soup, steak tacos, burritos, and a taco bowl.  The tortilla soup was chicken stock with too much taco seasoning in it. Not even close to any sort of tortilla soup. One point for it actually being soup, though.   If you REALLY love steak fajitas, this is your place. Why? Because the other 3 dishes were steak fajitas displayed slightly differently on the plate. \"Tacos\" were basically pre-loaded fajitas. The burritos were fajitas with the same shells tucked slightly under. The taco bowl was a taco shell bowl full of fajitas.  But the absolute worst thing?! I requested extra hot sauce and not only did they not give extra, they didn't send any at all! Instead, they sent guacamole covered in MOZZARELLA cheese and sour cream. Are we Italian tacos now?  Soup was inedible. Other 3 fajitas dishes were ok but has zero spice. I added my own and some salsa. That helped.   Mexican: i don't think that word means what you think it means."}
{"text":"Fantastic food. My wife and I have tried just about everything on the menu and we have never been disappointed. The service is quick and friendly. There is also a large variety of grocery items you can purchase as well as fresh salsas and other sauces. We come as often as we can and travel all the way from ile perrot."}
{"text":"The Taco King is king!  I stopped in for take-out on a whim and was served some of the best Mexican food I've had in years.  Fresh grilled chicken and veggies with a spicy mix of lime and cilantro... yum!    As for the atmosphere, it's like a jumbled bodega where everyone seems to be in a good mood.    I'll be back, and next time I'm taking home some of that homemade salsa verde too!"}
{"text":"I lived in the U.S. in teh great south west where there were many many first generation Mexicanos.  This place is good by any standard.  Home made salsas and tacos that are a little unusual to get outside of Mexico such as taco di cabesa and taco di lingua.  Only minus was I think they don't make their own tortillas."}
{"text":"Well this is it guys, after years of trying to find authentic Mexican restaurants, this is the one. As a Mexican who's part of a family that harasses my grandmother to cook way more than we probably should to fulfill our never ending need for delicious Mexican food, we can now tell her to relax. This is the absolute real deal. As someone who grew up eating this food and has been to Mexico more than 6 times I can confirm to you that this is the best of authentic Mexican food. I felt like I was eating my grandmothers food in her colorful kitchen as my whole family has been doing since they immigrated here over 50 years ago. I ordered way too much out of excitement; horchata, tacos al pastor, huarache, tortas, churros etc... and every single thing that came out was the best I've had in Montreal. Honestly, if you like REAL Mexican food, stop everything you're doing right now and go to this place.  El Rey del Taco, thank you for restoring my faith in Montreal's lack of authentic Mexican restaurants, I love you."}
{"text":"Nourriture typiquement mexicaine. Rien à voir avec les restaurants mexicains plus commercial, on est ici dans l'authentique.  Ce restaurant aurait très bien pu se trouver directement à Mexico! Par contre, comme c'est habituel la-bas, pas vraiment de décor ni d'ambiance, on y passe pour manger mais on ne s'y éternise pas  Note importante: pas d'alcool disponible sur place!"}
{"text":"Wow! That's a fun and delicious place! Right next to the Marché, you get a good spot to drop your bags and enjoy super tasty food.   Good juices, great service, and very Yummy tacos.   Really worth a stop if you're around."}
{"text":"I went a long time ago and remember it being awesome. My girlfriend and I where in the area and decided to go for lunch. It was packed but the staff was extremely accommodating and efficient. Quick service and the food was excellent. After 2 meals , 2 drinks and a churro we left extremely satisfied and it came out to only 30$ for two. I recommend to anyone who likes authentic Mexican ."}
{"text":"Food is fairly good but service can be really slow during busy summer days. Long lines to pay sometimes. However I like this place for their terrasse, friendly staff and awesome choice of products in the grocery section. They could improve cleanliness, decor and upgrade the plastic glasses for real glasses. I prefer to go to Super Taco if I don't have time to wait for service."}
{"text":"Best mexican restaurant in mtl! I always come here, for their tortilla soup thats so delicious!! Everything on the menu is good, the brunch is delicious also! They have churros that are so yummy! Always the best choice"}
{"text":"El Ray Del Taco is a place that is,unappealing to the eye. Absolutely delicious every single bite. Please do not be turned off by it's poor decorations. You will regret not eating there.  This is not at all an Americanized taste of Mexico. This is the same taste you will receive from a home cooked meal, being completely fresh and homemade.  El Ray del Taco meals are loaded with flavour(Low in salt!) but fresh! Everything is made in front of the restaurant to which your can see, upon you ordering it. Every bite you take will be loaded with flavour, a low or high amount of heat(Up to you!) and pure comfort to your stomach along with a big smile on your face. Each time I've been here, I ask myself the same thing. When I'm I coming back. It never disappoints. Service from my own experience has been flawless. Fast, professional and very kind. Once the meals were ordered, they've arrived 15 minutes later. On a very busy sunny Saturday lunch hour.  One drawback to which I think it can be fixed. Is the payment method. You stand in line on a very narrow and crowded hallway. While the waiters, and clients also pass by you. You feel you are in the way. Which honestly, you are!  Many times I've seen 7-9 people in a line wanting to pay at the same time. Waiters asking for you to move. Move where?! There is no where else to go! If this is my only complaint, well I will certainly tough it out in order to have yet of thrice delicious meals again.  I will be honest. It does get busy, loud, and crowded. Do keep that in mind if that is not your cup of tea.  Also do keep in mind. Their guacamole is out of this world! Loaded with flavour!"}
{"text":"Délicieux!!! Les plats sont très  bons,  le prix abordable et le service courtois ainsi que rapide! La guacamole est la meilleure que j'ai mangé, ils la font pour apporter...maintenant nous allons toujours l'acheter là, plus moyen de la faire maison quand tu goûtes à celle-ci!"}
{"text":"I've read so many excellent reviews for this restaurant so we've had high expectations. I ordered the enchiladas rojas, it was okay. The rice tasted like uncle ben's rice, the enchiladas were not that tasty the bean sauce was really good but it shouldn't be the big hype of the plate. I felt like 3 amigos' enchiladas are better then this. My boyfriend ordered the carne tacos (beef) which were completely tasteless, the meat was not marinated nor had any spices on it. We were both very disappointed. Anyway, the staff was really nice the service was fast, the restaurant looks nice and cute but let's be real the most important thing has to be the food and they just couldn't give us what we expected"}
{"text":"REALLY good food. Very casual atmosphere (plastic chairs, TV showing the soccer game) full of people with happy bellies. Fast, cheerful service in three languages (English, français, español).  My husband had the chicken & veggie tacos, which were really good. I had the lamb tacos, which were amazing. Serving size was perfect for lunch. If we were there in the evening I might order a starter to fill me up, or try something else on the menu which comes with rice/beans/salad. Everything on the menu (and on the tables around us) looked so good.  They have real Mexican cheeses (for sale as a grocery item as well as in your meal) if that floats your boat. There are plenty of choices if you are a vegetarian, or if you can't have diary or gluten.  We will be back again and again. Perhaps even every time we go to the Marché Jean-Talon (right outside the back door)."}
{"text":"I loved it , the food was tasty price reasonable and the service fast. The waitress was welcoming and smiling ! I recommend it"}
{"text":"My friend and I were seated promptly upon arrival. The restaurant has a good amount of the dining tables. Upon being seated, we were briefly served nachos with three different types of sauces. The waitress who served us was really friendly and the menu offered a great variety of Latin American/Mexican food. Service was swift and the food was amazing. It was our first time there but definitely won't be our last. This place currently made one of my top restaurants in Montreal.  I ordered a Quesadilla and the Mixte Plate with five meat, rice, beans and salad :)"}
{"text":"I was taken there by a Mexican friend. It is said to be one of the most authentic Mexican restos in Montreal. There are lots of choices on the menu, you prob be lost for a while. Food is great, drinks are cheap and refreshing. Too bad they sold out of churros that day :( I love the idea that after a meal you can get some \"grocery\" back home :)"}
{"text":"My first Mexican experience was tacos made by my mommy when my tastes buds were just developing as i go older I had the chichi's experience and after eating stale food served by non Mexicans my outlook on Mexican food wasn't that great ..after exploring and hanging out with my friends i tried the three amigos experience, after inducing vomiting and a week of sitting on the thrown getting very close to the charmen, i was set to never eat Mexican again ... but then i came across this joint and instantly made a friend with Chef Jarvier Munoz (Mexican) and his wonderful family who brings out piping hot authentic Mexican food . the meal are beyond good the explosion of flavors go off the moment walk in the door the aromas are so thick you can taste them in the air and once that plate hit the table and the wave of freshness wheels you closer to the place the intoxication makes your belly rubble with great intensity . i suggest you fast for 5 days drink nothing but water and head directly to the market and check this guy out he will not let you down"}
{"text":"Amazing food!!!! the kitchen is open and you see the cooks working hard! The place gets packed quick and the food is really cheap. The staff is always super nice and welcoming. Really good place and is a must try!  During summer,i love to sit on their huge terrasse which faces marche jean-talon! Very good vibe."}
{"text":"The only thing that's coming to mind about this restaurant is: omg. Literally, it's that good. I can't even form words. I've been twice so far, and every time the food has been fresh, flavourful, and all-around delicious (bonus points for their amazing tortilla chips + super spicy salsa). If it's your first time going, you might be tempted to play it safe and go for the guacamole and/or tacos. Go for it. They're above and beyond amazing. But if you want to branch out, I recommend trying the tamale or their \"nopales\" appetizer. Or their tortilla soup. You know what, forget it, no matter what you get you're most likely going to leave happy. Seriously.   Their location is pretty awesome, too. They're not too far away from Jean-Talon metro, and right in the Jean-Talon Market, so it's really easy to get to and really cool if you're down to eat on their terrasse. All in all, if you're thinking about going, do yourself a favour and just go for it."}
{"text":"Une bonne expérience ! J'ai pris un plat Huarache qui était vraiment bien fournie par rapport au plat de quesadilla que mon compagnon a prise.  Tout est bon et frais. Il y a des jus frais à disposition.  Le service est sympa. Il y a beaucoup de choix, voir trop, on met longtemps à choisir finalement.  J'ai adoré le guacamole!"}
{"text":"Après avoir écouté Miam sur Yoopa avec les enfants, nous sommes parti à la recherche du Roi du Tacos et nous l'avons trouvé. Nous y avons été 2 ou 3 fois.  Ça rencontre mon critère: ça goûte la bouffe maison. Tout est frais. Il y a plusieurs ingrédients qu'ils font maison alors que nous avons l'habitude de manger ceux provenant du commerce.  Les ingrédients sont de bonne qualité. J'ai mangé un burritos et le barbacoa la fois suivante, qui semblerait-il est l'incontournable pour un mexicain (un ami). Ils ont fait des drinks sur la terrasse un jour. C'était bon et ça donnait un atmosphère très festif pour un dimanche midi.  Le seul défaut c'est que la nourriture est fade un peu et il y a trop de sel."}
{"text":"Mexican food for \"gringos\". If you're craving Mexican food, this will do the trick, but manage your expectations. In the words of my mother, a Oaxaca  woman with a knack for cooking, the sauces were either too spicy or not flavorful enough, and the green sauce used for the chilaquiles probably had one too many tomatillos because it was a bit too sour. Definitely not the best Mexican food we've had. Service was fine."}
{"text":"Ordered the plate of the day which was delicious, price was reasonable just wished the portions were larger. They also have soft drinks in bottles! The guacamole is very fresh and the head chef was very friendly. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"After trips to Mexico , i was looking for a real mexican treat , glad I found el rey ! Fresh, authentic and  sooooo tasty !"}
{"text":"This place USED to be amazing. Sometime since I last came here they got a new menu, changed their quesadillas and burritos completely and everything just plain sucks now. My whole family was disappointed and shocked at how bad the food has become.   They used to have amazing quesadillas with cheese and grilled veggies and your choice of meat, however today they gave us a quesadilla that was drenched in sauce and I can't even tell you what was IN it because all I remember is the crazy amount of sauce.   They used to serve two small burritos on a plate with sides which were delicious. Not anymore. Now they serve what the waitress called a \"big\" burrito which was just a big mess that they folded in a way to make it look big but it really was pretty empty inside and just tasted horrible compared to how their burritos used to be.   Oh yeah and their horchata is extremely watered down and not great either!  This place just isn't worth it anymore which is disappointing for me to say because it used to be my favorite Mexican restaurant. I'm never coming back here. The food now sucks AND it's expensive compared to other Mexican restaurants. They really sell 4 tacos for $9, when you can get 4 much better tacos for $5 at other restaurants, what a joke! You can easily find better food than this guys, don't waste your time and money here."}
{"text":"Their service is really superb. Along with their fresh and really outstanding GUACAMOLE! I could go in and order a large Guac and that would satisfy me. Aside from that, their tacos are really tasty. Make this your Mexican Go-To!"}
{"text":"just what you want in a mexican restaurant.   reminded me of Texas and s. california eateries.  simple and GOOD"}
{"text":"Got a little addicted when I found this place. Really good inexpensive food. Set in a store/service restaurant. No beer but they let you bring your own (tip- there's a microbeer shop on the other side of the market). Ingredients are super fresh which is the best part of any restaurant. Run by authentic Mexicans."}
{"text":"104 avis déjà...4* as-t-on besoin d'ajouter un 105ième avis? OUIII! Alors, j'ai adoré...tellement que je suis allé 2 fois en 10 jours...! Les assiettes tournent autour de 11 à 14$ pour la majorité..bien-sûre il y en a des plus fancy et plus dispendieuses...et des assiettes de tacos seulement moins cher! La place est simple et coloré et c'est tant mieux comme ça! Il y a un petit marché dans le resto avec des produits mexicains. On retrouve aussi 3 pâtisseries à la caisse...entre autre des Churros...que j'ai trouvé so so..les deux fois...mais ça reste bon et fullll de dulce de leche.   Je vous conseille la Sopa de tortilla. Peut-être pas la meilleur au monde...mais du moins une des bonnes à Mtl. La première fois, j'ai pris le plat du jour qui était tostada de ceviche..yummy le plat à 11$. La deuxième fois, j'ai pris des crevettes à l'ail. Excellent choix. Presque toutes les assiettes viennent avec du guacamole, du riz et de la salade. Ahhh et on vous apporte des tortillas  colorées avec 3 sortes de sauces en attendant le plat. Le service est très rapide et ils ont une terrasse avec la vue sur le marché Jean-Talon."}
{"text":"Great place for authentic Mexican food. Whenever I make my bi-weekly schlep to Jean Talon, I have to make a stop here.   Fantastic food, great prices, and great staff. Go for the chilaquiles!"}
{"text":"Food tasted good at the time of consumption but the part of being sick after made my review go from 5 to 2.  Not sure I would recommend it. Would have to try it again to see if me being sick was a one time fluke"}
{"text":"We went here after the awesome Yelp Spring Fling, and had a sampling of a number of menu items. The \"ambience\", if one can use that term here, was part taco joint, part Mexican food store, and part Mexico City bus station replete with a tv showing telenovelas. We were dying for tequila or at least a nice cerveza, but alas, no liquor licence. However, they do have some \"drink if you dare\" Mexican sodas, which contain twice the legal limit of sugar and food coloring of normal soda (which I generally don't drink anyway, unless it's mixed with something). Don't expect too much in any regard here. They do tacos, fairly well, and that's what I'd recommend ordering here, although something possessed me to order the tamales too (more on that in a sec). We started off with guacamole. Having lived a good 10 years in Texas, and traveled a lot to Mexico for work, it was, well, really odd. They mix iceberg lettuce and tomato in with the avocado, and there's nary a hint of garlic or lime. The result is a bit gloopy and fairly unpleasant, especially if you're expecting a beautifully dense unctuous avocado forward, garlic, lime, salt, and cilantro based dip. Oh well. The tortilla chips though, which seemed homemade, were light and crisp, and we even bought a bag to take home. The salsas were equally good, with the tomato based one being the standout. The tomato salsa was served warm, and had bay leaf and celery in it - a flavor combo I've never had in Mexico, but one which really worked. We also bought some salsa to take home. We had beef tacos and tacos al pastor. The beef tacos were pretty good, but too much char on the meat, and the overall flavor was bland. The tacos al pastor were just as they should have been though, nicely cooked meat and great tang from the pineapple. Big marks also for serving everything with soft corn tortillas. The tamales though were pretty bad. I am a big tamale fan. These were mealy and dry, and the filling was cloyingly sweet and unpleasant. This place does tacos, and they do them pretty well. I'd come back for the tacos al pastor and chips and salsa, and the telenovelas of course. Hasta pronto."}
{"text":"Great place for a casual cheap eat. It tastes like the mexican i ate in california which was pretty authentic. I recommend the place."}
{"text":"First time there, might not be the last, but...  Typical free entree at a mexican restaurant...tortillas and salsa! It was good! Had 3 different salsa sauce provided with different levels of spicy! Good!  Ordered the nachos supreme thinking its the typical nachos. We were wrong. It was a platter with rice, guacamole on the side and then nachos submerged in sauce and cheese, or should I say soup... the nachos underneath were all soggy, it was not good. The meet that came with the platter were chewy.  Then ordered tacos. One order is 4 tacos and is 9$. Actually great price! I tried the porc and pineapple one, it was good. Also ordered the lamb one. This one was rather dry. Had to pour the whole salsa dip they gave us at the beginning... most not forget to menton how the tacos were served. It was literally 4 tortilla on the plate and then the topping just on too everywhere. How are we suppose to eat this without making a mess?"}
{"text":"This is a very nice place to grab some nice authentic food. They have a pretty friendly staff. I enjoy making a stop at this place before I shop around the market. If I forget to eat before I do my shopping I end up with $50 worth of stuff I certainly don't need. :P"}
{"text":"I had been looking for an authentic Mexican restaurant in Montreal for sometime. 3 amigos just doesn't cut it for me. Luckily, I came across El Rey Del Taco and it was everything I wanted and more. They serve up traditional Mexican food at a low cost. I loved that they provided us with tortilla chips with 3 different types of salsa varying in heat (high, medium and light). Tacos are served on a soft tortilla which was nice compare to the hard shell you get at most places. I got the pork tortilla topped with pineapple and my boyfriend got the vegetarian plate. They have quite a few veggie options if you don't eat meat. The only disappointment were the churros. They were hard and tasted a bit stale, but even at that they weren't too bad.  The place itself has a nice vibe; with beautiful Mexican photography on the wall. And colourful decor really lit up the place. They also have tons of speciality Mexican food products on display.  The kitchen is semi open concept, therefore if you want you could watch the cooks prepare your food.   There's a lovely terrace outside which overlooks the Jean-Talon market.   I can't wait to return and try their other specialties!"}
{"text":"Here's the deal. I've been to El Rey Del Taco twice, and these are probably the best tacos you'll get in Montreal, especially the best for the price. But I'm a Texas girl, I like my tacos and I like them spicy and delicious. I have high standards for my guacamole and while El Rey is the closest I'll come to authentic this far north, in the words of Shania Twain... \"That don't impress me much.\" The Horchata is the greatest thing ever! Creamy, cinnamon goodness in a glass, sometimes that's all I need on a winter day. They even sell it to go by the liter! They always give you plenty of house-made chips and three salsa, all fairly mild. My go to are the enchiladas and the lamb tacos (they're halal). Just a tip, order them by the pound, they are cheaper and more filling that way. Also go with friends, and SHARE! The portions are large and you get the most bang for your buck if you're sharing. Plenty of room for large groups, although they close pretty early. Not the swankiest spot in Montreal but pretty close to Jean Talon and Park Jarry, oh and Juliette et Chocolate, so make an evening of it!"}
{"text":"After going three times with consistently awesome results, I decided to bring my mom there (who is a chef). It was a HUGE disappointment. Her refried beans were burnt, the rice was dry and her dish was a bit on teh sorry side. Plus, the waitress didn't bring her water (it wasn't a super busy day either). The waitress also was prepping some food between handing money and serving customers without washing her hands. Very unimpressive. I hate that this place was so inconsistent."}
{"text":"I came here expecting excellent food but was disappointed. The food arrived and was not even hot. We had the mixed grilled meats and they were not fresh. And the tamale was average compared to when I was in Mexico which were Served hot and fresh. Would never come back sorry"}
{"text":"I came here for the first time with my boyfriend a couple days ago, and I immediately knew I was going to have the Gringas. I snacked on the trio of delicious house salsas and waited for him to make up his mind. He picked the Enchiladas Rojas with chicken. We enjoyed the outdoor seating and when the food arrived he tried a couple bites and said it was too saucy. So I switched plates with him without even getting a bite myself. That's love. However, I really liked the enchiladas, the sauce was slightly spicy and the chicken was well seasoned. The refried beans were creamy, a good counter to the spicy rojas sauce. I got to eat the guacamole that came with the gringas, I like that it was full of coriander and zesty from lime juice. I'm sure we'll be back again...."}
{"text":"What I like most about this place is that it serves very good food, and relatively fast, for a very affordable price.  They would even serve nachos and three kinds of salsa with the menu before you order, just to get you started.  The food choices are very diverse - any kind of Mexican dish seems to be on the menu.  I have had the pleasure of having the carnitas (wow) and the tamales (whooo hhaaa!). The veg nachos are also very nice - comes with veggies, frijoles, rice and guacamole.  Service is quick and at this place they actually bother to check if you are happy with your dish. What I don't appreciate as much is the waitress asking for the tip to be left on the table instead of being paid together with the bill inside (makes you wonder if the owner is dipping into the tip jar, or if they are just avoiding taxes). In any case, the prices are on the lower scale of the $$ category. If you are down for some good Mexican in this part of town - that's where you want to head to."}
{"text":"Situé dans le marché Jean-Talon ce restaurant est une des meilleurs place à tacos et autres plats typiquement mexicain de la ville.  C'est sans prétention, le décors ne paie de mine mais la bouffe est authentique et excellente et c'est ce qui compte!!  La présent station des plats peu peut-être laisser à désirer, mais les portions généreuses et la bonne bouffe compense amplement.  Ce n'est pas seulement un restaurant, c'est aussi un endroit pour acheter quelques spécialité mexicaine tel que nachos, salsa tortillas et autre.  D'ailleurs, dès que l'on est aussi, on se fait servir un bol de nachos avec trois sauces (douce, moyenne et forte)."}
{"text":"Great location adjacent to Jean Talon market. Great price and Mexican food. The burritos are a good choice. The three spiced level salsa are served as side dishes with coloured nachos. It get crowdy fast during lunches and dinners."}
{"text":"I finally had the chance to try out this popular mexican resto located in the jean talon market and truly loved the tacos!  The resto decor is quite festive and colorful. The resto itself is small and they do have an outdoor terrace which is great for summer!  The service is super-friendly and very welcoming. We tried the chicken and steak tacos which were very light and super tasty!  Loved every bite! Definately do leave room for dessert! Their churros were delicious and yummy!  A sweet-lovers dream come true !   We also tried their hibicus ice tea whch was unlike traditonal ice tea which is usually packed with sugar.Their tea was less sweet but super tasty and refreshing ...great sumnertime drink. I would definately recommend this place...great for a quick bite to eat or family supper. Great quality food and not expensive. They also sell latino products including tacos and sauces which is great!"}
{"text":"So, I went to this place because of the high ratings on Yelp. Maybe it's because we showed up about 30 minutes before closing, or maybe we just ordered the wrong dishes. Either way, the experience was far from great.  Firstly, the place was pretty dead (only one other party), so it wasn't cool that the server spent much more time shooting the breeze with his coworkers than serving us. We waited too long. Secondly, the floor was filthy. I ordered an enchilada with a mole sauce. It came inundated with the sauce and it simply wasn't that good.  Again, with such high ratings, I was surprised with my experience. Maybe I'll go back, but it's far from a priority."}
{"text":"Very authentic mexican, great service and lots of great stuff to take out too."}
{"text":"First off, the signage outside obeys language laws so you will be going into Le Roi du Tacos; I think the only time I saw \"El Rey\" was on the credit-card slip.  I might be spoiled by the awesome Mexican we have here in Providence, but  this was as good, not better, than a couple of our local spots, and certainly pricier (montreal vs. little rhody, natch).  But, it's a nice spot to grab some lunch after working up an appetite at the market. They have attentive service, pitchers of Horchata and well-prepared, succulent tacos, so how could you not like it? My favorite Mex in Mtl."}
{"text":"While at the Marche Jean-Talon, my boyfriend and I we looked for a place to get dinner. After a 6/7 hour drive from NY for our vacation in Montréal, we wanted something relatively quick. We decided to try one of our favorite cuisines: Mexican. And we landed on El Rey del Taco. We ordered a gordita and two different types of tacos. Steak and pork tacos. How else can you tell if a Mexican place is good or not?  The service was pretty fast after we sat down. It took them a few minutes to acknowledge our existence after we walked in though.  The gordita tasted okay. I felt it was lacking a bit of flavor. It's a corn flour dough stuffed with chicken, cheese, cilantro, lettuce and topped off with mayo.  The tacos were good. The steak tacos were a little over cooked to my liking. They came with with peppers, onions, cilantro, red salsa in corn tortillas with a side of lime.   The pork tacos were delish, moist and tender, with some fat. The pork tacos came with onions, cilantro, red salsa in corn tortillas with a side of lime.  This place also carried dessert which we didn't have since the meal filled us up. But looked really good. Overall is recommend this place if you're looking for something quick and not too expensive."}
{"text":"Without any doubt, this is one of the few restaurants with authentic Mexican food. You cannot only find quality but variety: you can find meat, pork, fish and seafood.   Don't judge a book for its cover (and in this case either for its interior), the place is more like a ministore with a couple of tables improvising a restaurant, but hey! you are in for the food right?  As opposed to many other \"real\" Mexican places, most of the ingredients do not come out of a can and that alone improves greatly the flavor of the meals.  If you miss them, you can have tacos al pastor and carnitas michoacanas, they are superb.  They will also offer you a small plate with nachos and real, no-tostitos-or-el-paso sauce (Ask if they are hot or no, in my experience there is people very senstive to even the slightest amount of hot peppers). And if sauces are too hot you can also ask a jar of horchata, tamarindo or jamaica drinks.  Warning: Do not expect anything like taco bell, 3 amigos or Carlos N Pepes, this IS authentic Mexican food."}
{"text":"Great place, full of mexicain flavors, ver authentic.  I had a great time here, and the bill is not very expensive.   There are definitely more \"high end\" tacos places in Montreal, but ElRey Del Taco will suit your purist needs."}
{"text":"Solid reasonably priced Mexican restaurant with great salsas, chips, and outdoor seating. The pastor tacos were very good, heavy on the pineapple which was great (could use a bit more spice to go with it), and the chilaquiles with eggs, chicken, guacamole, and beans were a killer deal for 12 bucks. Really enjoyed this place."}
{"text":"I've heard great things from this place from many different people who've actually lived in Mexico for a while but somehow, it did not deliver for me.   We ordered to share three types of taco meat (you choose the meat and they give you all the other toppings) - carnitas, lamb and beef. All three came rather dry and lacking flavour: we had to put copious amount of salsa to make up for how dry the meat was. Otherwise, the taco shells were authentic shells made out of corn and the three types of salsa (different heat level) were quite good.   After my meal, I almost felt like we ordered the wrong thing, how can somewhere so well known and claimed fail so miserably? I will definitely come back and give this place another shot one day."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a late lunch today and really enjoyed it!  Very busy spot, service is brisk, not overly polite but fine.  Complimentary chips and salsas to start - ole!  I enjoyed the chicken tamales, smothered in salsa verde with a side of rice and beans - so freaking tasty!!  My main squeeze ordered shredded pork tamales and I can attest - they were awesome!!  Great place to enjoy a tasty bite near the Jean Talon market!!"}
{"text":"Llegué al lugar con hambre pero sin tantas expectativas, pedi las enmoladas rellenas de barbacoa y la verdad es que me quedé sorprendida! Todo era muy sabroso, la carne tenía buen sazón y el mole les quedó delicioso, igualito como en México! Estoy muy contenta con ese lugar, los meseros atienden bien y en general me gusto todo, hasta una tiendita hay por si se les antoja comprar algo ya hecho, o ingredientes básicos para su casa! Lo recomiendo!"}
{"text":"My wife and I dined here for lunch after walking around Marche Jean-Talon.There were plenty of seating and the staff was very attentive.   I got the beef soup and the 'fish' buffer. Boo Boo got the chicken fajita thing. The taste was there but we've definitely had better. My fish taco were more veggie than fish. There was a lot of sauteed onions and carrots and a small morsel of fish in each tacos.  The churros were stale. like its been sitting out for a few days.   My expectations were not high so a 3 stars is fair. Its like eating at the subway next to the world trade center.   American cc accepted. Tip your wait staff in cash."}
{"text":"Based on the food alone this is a four star place; however, I have subtracted a star for poor service from the staff. I went with a group and we had orders that were not correct when they arrived. The waitor acted very annoyed and pissy. Would have been nice if he confirmed the orders before leaving and not coming back for several minutes. The coffee service was less than desirable as well. All that said the food when it did come was fantastically delicious.  I hope to fo back and find the service has improved, but we shall see."}
{"text":"The food wasn't terrible by any means, but the rice we got was waaaaay too salty. As for the food, it was pretty damn salty too. I cannot recommend the food from that place. As for pre-packaged food (drinks for example), they were genuinely from Mexico.  All in in all, it was a disappointing experience. Service was good, except for the fact that the cashier charged us extra for stuff we didn't even order. That got rectified once we went back."}
{"text":"I got tacos al pastor.  They were very good.  The staff and cooks are Mexican and speak Spanish, which was a welcome change from the French I'd been inundated by.  My dish was cooked, seasoned, and served perfectly.  Loved it.  We all did.  The place also has a small market area with several Hispanic items for sale."}
{"text":"We stumbled upon this Mexican restaurant on our way to the market. I'm glad we did!   I've had Mexican twice while visiting Montreal both times it's been very good! We actually had breakfast here, we shared the Pozole and chicken enchildas. Both were very good! It wasn't too salty and the best thing is you can taste the different flavours on the plate. The tortilla chip that came with the soup was fresh and crispy. I would definitely go back again.  Who knew Montreal had such good Mexican food."}
{"text":"Good Mexican food with local and authentic dishes. The atmosphere is casual and the service good. Bring cash for tips."}
{"text":"A very nice Mexican dining experience. I had the El Rey burrito with horchata with my boyfriend. Pretty filling and my boyfriend bought me a churro afterwards; super sweet and tasty! Perfect place to visit after Marche Jean Talon."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Mexican place North of the border. Its a hole-in-the-wall meets Mexican Grocery meets awesome food. If you are lookin for a place with good decor, you will be disappointed.  But what this place promises is some great food.  Also very light on your wallet. Conveniently located just outside Jean Talon market.  Service is friendly. Most of the servers are fluent in Spanish / French & English. Except the one at the cash register.        If you are a group of 4 or more, I'd recommend Tacos by the kilo.   40 bucks for chicken / beef / fish/ sausage tacos. You can try half and half for 50 bucks. Still cheaper than ordering individual dishes.      Their  Tamales are great too.  Free nachos and sauce. 3 diffrent types of sauces. Also you can buy these sauces and almost everything else at their grocery store.   So :   Food - Great Service - Freindly Ambience - Meh Worth the money - Awww Yeeaaahh"}
{"text":"People were nice. Chips and salsa was the highlight. Had the mole enchiladas which were bad. Tortilla couldn't be cut with knife tasted reheated."}
{"text":"Overall positive experience. It took a little while to get served at the table with water, but the waitresses were nice and friendly once they swung by. The menu is in French and English, as well as super descriptive, which made ordering really easy.   I ordered the enchiladas suesas and was pleasantly surprised by how good it was. I am by no means an expert in knowing what \"good\" Mexican cuisine is - I don't eat much of it aside from Taco Bell back in the U.S. - but this was delicious. The chicken was tender, the enchilada sauce was the perfect degree of spicy, and the Swiss and Oaxaca was a great combination. Paired with the black beans and rice, it was near perfect for my tastes."}
{"text":"Dommage je suis allé manger récemment et le service client était des plus mauvais. Mon taco arrive froid et il n'ont pas mis de poivrons et les onions comme j'avais demandé à la place il me donne une assiette avec des onions et des poivrons que je dois moi même mettre dans mon tacos?lol"}
{"text":"About a 2-2.5: El Rey del Taco is a small little tortilla factory that also carries some supermarket goods as well as a small little eatery.  The menu offers breakfast platters, appetizers (such as salsa and chips), tacos, and other Mexican specialties.  The hubs and I shared a Carne Asada as well as the Al Pastro tacos.  Both came with 4 corn tortillas (not double-layered), topped with a generous amount of filling.  The Carne Asada didn't really have much flavor, but I did appreciate the copious amount of sauteed veggies on top; I wasn't a fan of the sweeter salsa sauce that was on both); the Al Pastor had cubed pineapples and onions, also topped with a sweeter salsa sauce (I wasn't a fan of this dish, as the pork also was not flavorful).  The hubs thought both tasted different from the typical tacos we've had in the past; I agree, but I wasn't a fan of the taste of either of them.  The corn tortillas also weren't lightly fried or anything, and it didn't soak up any of the juices from the meats/sauce. I also read that they make their horchata in-house; this was extremely watered down and had an off-taste to it; this was just sipped and pushed off to the side. Service was super friendly, and once you're done, you just go up to the cashier to pay.  +watery horchata T___T +underwhelming tacos +'sweet salsa' automatic on the tacos +friendly staff +around the corner from the Jean-Talon Market"}
{"text":"Really nice and helpful people.   Authentic Mexican food with lots of options. Definitely recommended."}
{"text":"I am such a happy camper! This place was amazing! Their tortilla chips are so colourful and yummy, and their salsas were so tasty I bought some to take home, along with my left over guacamole.   Trying to figure out where to go for lunch, I demanded (oh yes demanded) that we should have tacos, or something authentic Mexican, and my friend said this was his go to taco place and I was not disappointed! There was tons of choice on the menu for so many dishes, but the second I saw Fish Tacos, I was won over. He got the chicken tamales and of course I had to try some of his.   Their Black Beans were out of this world! Rice was really tasty, the dressing on the side salad was very zippy, and of course my fish tacos killed. This was the second time I had tamales, (just a bite of course) but I wasn't a big fan, but it could be that I wasn't a big fan of tamales. We also ordered guacamole, and that too, was super delicious!!  All in all, check the place out if you have a chance, my face was happy."}
{"text":"i had two tamales and they came with beans and rice........ uhhh sooo good!! but maybe i'm deprived of good mexican food living in the plateau. this was like two months ago but i'm making my review now because i cant stop daydreaming about this place"}
{"text":"Endoit sympathique dans la petite italie pour manger des mets mexicain et sud américain. Les tacos sont petits et servis sans accompagnement donc is vous avez une grosse faim je vous conseille de prendre un plat avec un accompagnement. La qualité est au rendez vous. Au niveau du service vous allez pouvoir pratiquer votre espagnol car la plupart des serveurs le parlent, voir certains que espagnol ;) Si je suis dans le coin et que je ressens une envie de mexicain je pourrais passer sans trop de soucis."}
{"text":"J'adore ce Resto! Le décor est pourri, mais en cuisine tout est authentique. Tout ce que j'ai goûté la bas me fait réellement voyager au Mexique. Top!"}
{"text":"Bon service chaleureux. Nourriture mexicaine authentique.  Par contre j'ai trouvé que pour 9$ j'avais une très petite portion. J'ai mangé en 2 min. Le restaurant est cool mais je ne prévoit pas y retourner."}
{"text":"Best Mexican restaurant in Montreal. The portions are amazing, the food is authentic, and the service is great. I would recommend the traditional nachos. They're nothing like the cheesy nachos your used to, definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"On the north side of Jean Talon with entrances from both Place du Marche and Jean Talon, El Rey del Taco is definitely the best place I've found in the area for Mexican. The pork tacos are spicy and delicious, the mixed meat plate is a yummy mountain, piled with steak, sausage, pork, rice, spicy meat sauce, sour cream and more. The nachos are tasty but at 15$ they are overpriced and out of synch with the rest of the pricing on the menu. The staff are super funny and nice and they have a sign up declaring their intention to be a business with happy customers that's a great place to work (a-dorable.)   El Rey is too brightly lit for me to love eating-in here for dinner so we usually do takeout, although as an afternoon stop during market shopping it's excellent. The resto doubles as a specialty shop full of Mexican products - foods, shampoos and other imported brands. They also sell homemade salsa and guacamole from a fridge in the back - the verde is insanely firey and delicious."}
{"text":"This is the kind of place I would say to stop for a light lunch. The flavors are there, and there is a lot of spice on some dishes while others fall flat. The quesadillas were great but the lamb tacos had no flavor. Some menu items priced below value while others are overcharged. I'll have to go by again to make sense of this place."}
{"text":"Dropped by when we came to the jean talon market. This is a really special restaurant. It got a small grocery shop section where you could buy some salsa and stuffs. this place has a authentic Mexican feel. Their food is good too! I got the lamb taco, and it was great! Also the churro was large and tasty too. Furthermore, their prices are fair. Most of their dishes cost under $10. I will definitely come back for more!"}
{"text":"En me promenant dans au Marché Jean-Talon, je me suis retrouvée devant ce petit restaurant mexicain. Depuis plusieurs années, je me posais la question Pourquoi Montréal n'a pas de typique restaurant mexicain. Jamais je n'aurais pensé en trouver un sans même le chercher. Je le nommerais plutôt casse-croute. Je me suis installée sur la terrasse. Comme amuse-gueule, ils servent des nachos de différentes couleurs avec une salsa douce et une épicée. La serveuse donnait également en dégustation un genre de margharita (sans alcool) à la menthe, hmmm délicieux et désaltérant. J'ai commandé les tacos Al pastor. Les tortillas sont fait sur place je crois et n'ont rien à voir avec ceux que l'on mange dans les Tex-mex du centre-ville (you know who you are). J'ai aimé mon plat, mais je n'ai pas adoré. Le mélange du porc mariné et la fraicheur de l'ananas et de la coriandre était parfait. Profitez de la vue du marché à même la terrasse est une chose, mais la panoplie de mouches et l'odeur d'ordures en est une autre. Ce n'est pas la faute du resto mais je devais le souligner. Ce n'est qu'en allant payer que j'ai remarqué qu'il y a la possibilité de manger à l'intérieur. De plus, c'est là que l'action se passe, on échange la vue sur le marché à une vue direct sur le chef qui prépare les plats dans une cuisine à air ouverte. Avoir su? Il y a également un petit marché avec différents produits mexicains. Finalement à la caisse, je me laisse tenter par un churros au Dolce de leche. Hmmmm parfait!  Jusqu'à la réception de ma facture à ma table, je donnais 3 étoiles mais tout à changer quand j'ai vu ce qui se passe à l'intérieur et que j'ai quitté, churro à la main, pour continuer mes emplettes."}
{"text":"Very authentic Mexican here. After you finish your Jean Talon shopping come and have some Mexican food. Different sauces for the chips are awesome. Loaded Nachos and Churro completed the meal"}
{"text":"El Rey Del Taco is a true Mexican restaurant that would make any gringo or amigo happy!    I came by here by chance because my usual Mexican Bottega was shut down for Victoria Day and I was in a hankering for some salsa.  Sooooo I picked up some of their guacamole and a pico de gallo.  Pricing was a bit on the higher side compared to my regular place Tortilleria Maya but hey \"change is good\"!  The PDG I picked up was the mild variety nice and fresh and lots of flavour!  The guac was awesome.  A bit salty but had some great big chunks of avocado with tomato and onion plus cilantro.     As I was waiting in line to pay my mouth was watering watching them bring out delicious looking plate after plate of what looked to be amazing authentic looking Mexican food.  Although I came here for salsa, I'm coming back for the real experience!  More to come after I get to try a real deal meal!"}
{"text":"Petit resto mexicain qui vend également des produits typiques.  On ne mange pas dans un décors de dingue mais c'est très bon. Un vrai guacamole, des tacos, de la purée de haricots... Rien n'est resté dans les assiettes !"}
{"text":"The El Rey del Taco restaurant serves Mexican cuisine. (In case you cant tell from the name) The restaurant is located next to the Marché Jean-Talon. They have an entrance in the front on Rue Jean-Talon and also in the back where the outdoor sitting is situated next to the market.  Seat yourself, and the staff will bring the menu, chips, and three kinds of salsa.  The food is reasonably priced, and we enjoyed our meal. Beef tacos were great. Definitely, a place to visit if you want to try something different."}
{"text":"Une bonne collation ou un petit souper de semaine à la mexicaine!  Bonne variété de plats typiques.  Situé au Marché Jean Talon."}
{"text":"I eat there at least once a week. It's a great casual eatery with a wide range of Mexican dishes at a very reasonable price. The service is super quick and the food is authentic and delicious. Of course you should try their tacos. In summer, they have a pleasant terrasse by the market."}
{"text":"Comida y precios maravillosos! It's good to see the Mexican community really put such heart into their food."}
{"text":"The King of Tacos doesn't look like much, but the food is great! In fact, when I have been, the place was stuffed from the front to the back terrasse. The poor waitress was everywhere at once! A popular dosh is a bowl made of tacos, and filled with basically everything in the kitchen: veggies, meats, guacamole etc..etc.. I had the cactus salad, it was good, it tasted unlike anything I knew, but needs more cactus!  The huarache is pretty tasty as well, but I'd steer clear of the quesadillas, not enough cheese (to my taste). The guacamole always tends to be cold. odd. Regardless, any dish will plaster your stomach for the day. Go crazy with the desserts, fried coconut donuts, massive churros, snacks on sale by the cashier's desk.. Aaall delicious. In fact, go crazy with everything, El Rey let's you buy guacamole by the gallon, multicoloured nachos, cacti (oh yeah!) and more (like lucha libre masks), while watching mexican Tv. We have a winner!"}
{"text":"I was recommended this place by a mexican professor so I was a little disappointed regarding the authenticity, but I must say it was still very tasty. Undeniably good food, perhaps just lacking a punch of some sort. Hibiscus juice was very nice and refreshing. The staff is super charming and welcoming, get ready to break out your high school Spanish to truly enjoy the experience.   There is also a small boutique selling mexican cuisine products."}
{"text":"Ça fait 3 ans que je voulais y aller, je voyais tjs pleins de monde dedans je me disais ça doit être bon alors !!!  Ça yest j'y suis allée hier et c'était vraiment vraiment super bon ! Je comprends pourquoi y'a tjs autant de monde Le service est sympa, les prix vraiment attractifs, le choix très vaste  C'est top ! Je le conseille vivement"}
{"text":"911 is fantastic, it's so hot, love it. The white snake sold at cashier is nice. It's not sweet as I like, but I think it's perfect."}
{"text":"Best Mexican restaurant I'be been to in Montreal so far. They have food that tastes almost like it does in Mexico. Good and fast service and it was pretty packed. Its prices are OK for Montreal and they sell all kinds of Mexican candy, salsas, chips and other stuff from Mexico."}
{"text":"Yum.  Great place to grab something \"different,\" from your typical farmers market (i.e. gourmet/speciality foods, fruits, meats & cheeses).  No frills dinning indoors or alfresco.  Fast made to order food for takeout or dine-in."}
{"text":"My fiancé is Mexican, so you can imagine, we *had* to try El Rey Del Taco when we first discovered it 6 months ago. Located on Jean-Talon, it's unremarkable from the outside and even more unremarkable when you step inside; let's face it, it's one of the ugliest restaurant I've ever eaten at. The owners don't even try to make it look nice. But you know what? We don't care, because the food is delicious!  As a vegetarian, I was very pleased with the vegetarian plate which is both good and fulling. Thanks to them I discovered nopalitos (diced cactus) and I'm so hooked that now I regularly buy them fresh and cook them at home too. My Mexican partner is a meat eater and he loves the place too, claims it's probably the most authentic Mexican restaurant Montreal has. I noticed he's a big fan of the carnitas and tacos al pastor.  Free nachos and sauce (real sauce, not tostitos sauce) are served on all tables. I highly recommend ordering one of their juices too, jamaica or tamarindo; both are delicious. Before going out, make sure to try one of their warm churros; a star-shaped cylindrical Mexican dessert filled with dulce de leche. Three words: Om nom nom."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch today, after hearing a lot of good things. I was pleasantly greeted by the hostess and she handed me a menu because I was taking out for lunch. Anyway I took the el Rey burrito, as I waited I tried there chips and variety of salsa, the spicy one was my favourite, and there guac is fantastic! A hint of spice I'll be dreaming about that tonight!   The service is A1, very friendly. What I love he most is you get to see what here cooking up in he kitchen in front of you, pretty cool! They also sell a variety of Mexican delights! From taco shells to salsa, fajitas presses. Also a little bakery section with churros and cookies, looked amazing!  The burrito had chicken and all the fixings in it, topped with a cream and a side of pure beans and rice. Very filling. It was fantastic! A definite must of your craving Mexican! Like Arnold always says,  I'LL BE BACK"}
{"text":"Une belle place à découvrir pour la nourriture mexicaine authentique. J'ai pris le plat du jour (agneau). 12$ pour une grosse portion.  Le resto était plein, mais service a été rapide et la serveuse était souriante et sympathique."}
{"text":"Went there on the weekend afternoon.  The restaurant is spacious. There are two big rooms. The one with open kitchen can be a little noisy and full of smoky smell.  I had a taco with the sliced meat and pineapple and my husband had a plate which I forgot the name. They both very tasty but still I drizzled some spicy sauce coming with the complimentary chips. The complimentary chips with three sauces I like the middle spicy one. The green one was too much to handle. There were homemade drinks, and I tasted all three (two floral ones and one rice water) and chose the sunflower one. Highly recommend to try the sauces and buy one home. Good value."}
{"text":"J'aime beaucoup ce restaurant style épicerie dans le marché jean talon. Il n'est pas particulièrement jolie mais la nourriture y est délicieuse est fraîche. Nous prenons souvent le fajitas qui est grillé comme un panini. C'est un repas complet franchement le fajitas est généreusement garni. Si vous voulez faire différent du poulet ou boeuf essayez l'agneau il est excellent et le goût n'est pas trop fort. Service rapide et familier. On aime prendre le temps de se promener dans le restaurant et découvrir de nouveaux produits d'épicerie afin de pimenter nos repas :)"}
{"text":"All of this was pretty unexpected.  Mexican place around the corner from the Jean-Talon market where we'd gone earlier in the day on a frigid Montreal weekend.  Really weren't sure if we should be going back but it was totally worth it.  It's half grocery store half restaurant.  Service was fast, the food was excellent -- large portions, very good nachos with tasty sauces, I had tacos which were great.  Very good and friendly service as well."}
{"text":"I have eaten here 3 times in the last week. I love this place with my whole heart. Best authentic Mexican restaurant in Montreal. Nothing fancy or hipster about it, so If you're looking for some boojie fish tacos, you won't find it here ! Here you will find classic Mexican dishes full of flavour. It reminds me of the Mexican restaurants in LA. So happy to have found this place."}
{"text":"This is the perfect (big) hole-in-the-wall for a snack/lunch after or before the market rush.  No fuss. No flare. Just tacos and things. They also have a grocery section that you can pick up tortillas, guac, queso, etc.  Although I've tasted other things there I always end up taking the menudo soup (tripes) and the lengua tacos (beef tongue) and they are always delicious. Honestly, just go."}
{"text":"My first time here, i ordered the taco salad which was delicious many choices inexpensive. Service was ok"}
{"text":"I'll start going there again as the nice weather is finally coming. I went to Mexico this year for my first time and went in those street place where you get the authentic stuff and let me tell you, this place lives up to the standard. I must try all their stuff. In my opinion, their Burrito del Rey vs another pork burritos is not to my expectation. The wrap are more an interpretation or a North americain wrap with a Mexican twist. The Chori Queso is very good and pretty cheap if you're just looking for a bite. The Taco dishes are serve by the weight and it is pretty decent. I have to go back soon and try all the stuff I ate in Mexico and try to compare.   It's a good place to eat a lunch, even when it's packed, it's very easy with 30-40 minutes to get order, get serve and eat.   If you're an average eater, calculate max 10-20$ per person."}
{"text":"Real taco for just a minute. I didn't realize Lana el Rey was such a good cook. That was a fantastic burrito and she should be proud. That burrito could go triple platinum in Europe.   I also like her horchata. It's sweet and Lana el Rey should be really proud of that too."}
{"text":"We had a late breakfast at El Rey Del Taco on my birthday.   We walked in and were told to sit wherever we like. We sat and were brought waters and tortilla chips with salsa immediately. The waitress explained the heat level of the three salsas and then left us to look at the menus.  We ordered 3 dishes and they were delivered very quickly.  My husband had the beef tongue tacos and he thought they were very tender and delicious. He had to order some guacamole on the side as they needed something. He also used some of the salsa from the chips.  Our son had the carne tacos which were also very good. He also needed to order some sour cream as they needed something.  I had the pork sopes and they were great. They were served with rice, which was also good and guacamole which was made exactly the way I like it with lots of flavour and nice and chunky.  If we lived in the area, we'd definitely return to El Rey Del Taco. Good food for a good price and friendly service."}
{"text":"I don't think I've had a better taco salad (you know the one with the crispy tortilla shell) ever in my life. Obviously, a taco salad is representative of authentic mexican, but it still warms that spot in my heart where Tex-Mex should be. It's worth it and they deliver to certain parts of the Plateau/Mile End/Little Italy."}
{"text":"Excellent, service courtois, prix raisonnables je le recommande fortement pour une experience authentique"}
{"text":"Hola amigo, you can't afford a plane ticket to try authentic tacos? That's fine, there's a portal to Mexico at El Rey del Taco. When you walk into the restaurant you'll instinctively search your pockets for your Spanish phrase book but don't worry, you won't need it. I can tell that the staffs are quite friendly but they appeared to be all over the place during one of my visits. Must be because it was a holiday where El Rey del Taco was one of the few restaurants that was open. Props to them.   Just like the time when I ate in Mexico, tortilla chips with various dipping sauce will be your bread and butter. How about the tacos? I'll tell you that it brought me right back to Mexico with that supple tortilla and that very Mexican cilantro, onion and lime trio.   If you're a big eater then an order of taco wouldn't be enough, at least that's how it was for me. Or was that because I was hungry for more?"}
{"text":"Very basic mediocre quality of Mexican food,  I lived in Los Angeles for 17 years with amount of Mexican population in Los Angeles you find the best  Mexican restaurants out of Mexico , I've eaten some of the best Mexican restaurants  and also the food trucks who sells Mexican food in Los angels, so  when I visited EL REY DEL TACOS past weekend obviously I started to compare the food with the one iam use to having in Los Angeles well I was making a big mistake i should not compare because the food I had at REY DEL TACOS was very bad, it has no taste at all specially the burritos It was swimming in the sauce it was so soggy and the quality of the meat they use was very very bad , tacos was okey I mean just okey we did not enjoy it at all we won't go back. But this is just us  if you are not use to having  original good quality Mexican food this restaurant will do the job after all this is MONTREAL where you will find minimum amount of Mexicans not many Mexican restaurants ."}
{"text":"This is conveniently located in Marche Jean Talon and is always filled with people waiting to try their mexican food. They welcome you with some nachos and three difference salsas to try with a jug of water. The menu consists of different mexican plates. I usually order the Tacos Al Pastor. Their tacos are pretty good...however i've had better ones around Montreal. My boyfriend usually takes the mixed platter with different meats and you get quite a bit for the price. The service is good and the waiters ask for the tips in cash if possible. Overall, the food is good, but doesn't live up to my standards for mexican food (once you've been to California for mexican, it's hard to find a good mexican place in Montreal!)"}
{"text":"I was visiting Montreal & decided to yelp some restaurants near the Jean Talon Market for my friends and I to go to. As soon as I read that there was a Mexican spot (being Mexican myself) so close by, I convinced them to dine here. Let me say that I've been to plenty of Mexican restaurants in New York, & no place in the 5 boroughs has food as flavorful & authentic as Rey del Taco (I'm extremely picky about Mexican food). This place is a total gem in my book! The four of us tried a little of each other's plates: gringas, sopes, Plato del dia, & a quesadilla de pollo. All of these items did not disappoint, and the meat-- especially the Pastor-- was AMAZING. Can't wait for my next visit to Canada & el Rey del Taco!"}
{"text":"Après mon voyage au Mexique, c est la seule place où j ai réellement eu l'impression de retrouver la merveilleuse nourriture que je venais de découvrir dans les rues de Mexico !  Un gros plus pour Le guacamole, débordant de coriandre pour mon plus grand plaisir ! #corianderforever"}
{"text":"So far this is my favourite Mexican place in town. Deliciousssssss food. Real Mexican waiters speaking Spanish with us, which brings the experience to a totally new level.   The place and decorations are very simple, but who cares. The second you step your feet inside this places, the smell of the food will make you crave instantly.  Price are fare and dishes are very well served. I don't recommend to share one order for two, in case you are very hungry. (I'm always VERY hungry).   Usually I go for the chef's choice, but since I'll never be able to decide if I want beef, pork or chicken, I ask for a mix.    Totally worth trying. I've been there a few times (and I finally got to review it) and I always recommend this place to my friends."}
{"text":"The tacos here are so tasty! This is my go-to tacos place now!  The price is all right. I guess it would be better to go on their happy hours."}
{"text":"Spring is finally upon us in Montreal which means my regular excursions to Jean Talon Market are occurring once more. Outside of the wonderful produce available to us at the market, there are some very interested options for anyone looking for a good meal. One of these is El Rey del Taco, a Mexican grocery store with a terrasse space overlooking the market and dishing out some south american food. With the recent rise of tacos in the city with Grumman 78, Icehouse and Mais amongst others, El Rey del Taco can get overlooked as a worthwhile option but I am here to tell you that would be a disservice.  Over the last month, I went for a quick lunch twice. As soon as you sit down, you are greeted with complementary tortilla chips with 3 different salsas, one mild, one spicy and one salsa verde. All 3 are enjoyable - the salsa verde in particular packs a pretty good punch.  To cool down from the heat, I ordered a glass of horchata. For the uninitiated, horchata is a rice based beverage which I absolutely love. Nice hints of vanilla and cinnamon within this cold drink. Great refreshing beverage to balance nicely the heat of the dishes. One of my favorite summer non-alcoholic drinks.  First up, I ordered the cheese quesadilla with guacamole. The guacamole has a nice thick consistency with the right hints of coriander, lime and tomato with the avocado. The quesadilla was quite good as well. The tortillas had the right crispness to them on the outside without becoming too brittle in general. The cheese in the middle was perfectly melted and had the right tang to it.  As a main, I chose to go with the chorizo tacos. The chorizo was broken down and cooked perfectly well with the natural spiciness of the sausage coming out very well. The little sauce added to the mix further enhanced that flavor. Topped with some coriander and onion to add some freshness and sweetness, these were very nice balanced tacos.  On the second visit, I went for the lamb tacos. In contrast to the spicy chorizo, the lamb was mild in flavor but had a more tender consistency and a much fattier taste as well. Topped with the same onions and coriander as the previous tacos, these tacos were quite tasty as well. I could have easily eaten the lamb by itself as a meal. Juicy, tender and falls apart without any effort. Just a wonderful cooking job there.  El Rey del Taco is a great option for anyone looking for a good taqueria in Montreal. Service is a little up and down but the price is reasonable and the quantity are plentiful. If you come to Jean Talon Market with any regularity, you need to stop by at least one and enjoy a good meal.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"I have been there only once ... and is hard to make an honest review with only one visit.... The menu is pretty big and diversified ...tacos were pretty good and so was the nopales salad that i had ... Again the cantina like decor... and the dépanneur style restaurant throw me off.    But if tacos and fast Mexican cuisine is your thing ... than is worth visiting especially if you are already at the Jean Talon market"}
{"text":"I love this place! The food is good and the menu is varied. It reminds me of some of the more casual restaurants in the Mission in San Francisco. The fish tacos are good and the portions are decent without being overly large . As a plus they sell items as a grocery store too."}
{"text":"I stumbled into this place one evening as I was wandering Jean Talon on a quite empty stomach.  Two empty stomachs entered, two very satisfied and full stomachs walked out that night.    We each ordered the chili con carne taco bowl, and we both thought it was very good.  The chili con carne actually had steak strips in it, and was seasoned well.  The taco bowl was crunchy and big enough to hold all of the veggies that were piled in. Served with rice, all for about 8$   Tidbits:  ++ Chips and two awesome, authentic salsas arrived immediately after we ordered  + Pitcher of water   *  Plastic rubbermaid style plates and water pitcher -- not the most beautiful set, but effective  -- Disposable cups (BOOO)  All in all:  authentic, delicious and filling food."}
