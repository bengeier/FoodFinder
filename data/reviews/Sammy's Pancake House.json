{"text":"food was good but when the owner started yelling at the waitress that's when I said i'm not coming back.  NEVER NEVER NEVER do that in front of your guests.  Actually, yelling rarely gets you anywhere with people.  She wasn't at fault.  sad sad place.  I've put this on here before but for some reason, my review was taken off.  wonder why or  how???"}
{"text":"Excellent place for good coffee, eggs done exactly right, crisp bacon, and mouth watering French toast and pancakes.  Fast service from the kitchen and the service staff.  Marie is the best server/waitress in the business.  She is quick, efficient, organized, and accurate.  But, when she smiles, she lights up the room.  She is quiet, not trying to be your firend or part of your conversation, but she sees what is happening on your table top.  Nothing misses her eagle-eyed assessment of your needs or your preferences.  I was incredibly impressed with the efficiency she displayed this morning as she served her customers, yet had us in her peripheral vision.  She finished her current task, then turned her full attention to our needs, settled us and was on to her next detail.  Try Sammy's Pancake House and be amazed by Marie, the consummate waitress."}
{"text":"Even though this is a \"pancake house\" I've never had their pancakes so can't review on those.  However, they have really awesome omelet breakfasts.  I love that you can choose from several on the menu or pick from a list of ingredients to build your own.  They serve them with potatoes and toast and it is always a ton of food.    The service has always been exceptional, especially Rosie.  She is friendly and fast without seeming overwhelmed.  She is probably the best server I've ever had anywhere."}
{"text":"Great breakfast place! I've been here about a dozen times and each time their food and service are great."}
{"text":"Very good breakfast. Service is exceptional. Kid friendly.  Coffee is disappointing."}
{"text":"My fav breakfast place. Amazing pancakes. Great staff. Consistent food.  Little pricy. Also homemade soups are great here. The staff is always very welcoming and is consistent. Usually very crowded after 10;30am on weekend FYI."}
{"text":"Good quick service and reasonably priced. I had a Denver skillet with cheddar cheese and over-easy eggs and it was delicious!"}
{"text":"The best place for breakfast in Champaign /Ubana  area  and lunch is great also, also very clean and great service."}
{"text":"One of the better local breakfast places. The pricing is pretty good and there is a pretty decent sized menu. I have only had breakfast items, so I cannot really attest to the lunch menu. This restaurant does close in the afternoon so it is not a dinner option.  Overall, the various items that I have tried have been above average and combined with the cost lead me to give it 4 stars!"}
{"text":"We LOVE Sammy's. They have the best skillets and pancakes in town. We came here the first time because Original Pancake house had a long wait and have been going to  Sammy's since. The wait on Sunday morning has never exceeded 10 minutes.  My go to is the Mexican skillet. Highly recommend Sammy's."}
{"text":"Needed to find a place to eat before leaving town so we tried this local spot hoping it would be a great discovery. Overall, it was just OK. The portions were large if that is your priority.  Our server wasn't particularly attentive even though there was no crowd. The \"Fresh\" strawberry pancakes were smothered with syrupy canned fruit which ruined the experience. Your visit may be better but I am unlikely to return."}
{"text":"Came on a Sunday morning and this place was packed. Friendly and efficient staff made the wait very short. The portions were gargantuan and well worth the price. I cleaned my plate and hurt myself in the process. Excellent!"}
{"text":"Had breakfast here with my wife on a Saturday morning. I went against my best instincts and had the Three Cheese Omelet instead of one of the Mexican Style breakfasts. My wife had the Vegetarian Omelet. The omelets were okay, as were the potatoes and pancakes that came with them. Coffee was fine. Service was excellent. The bill, with tax and tip, came out to about $25. I dunno -- it just seemed like that was a lot to pay for a breakfast that was not beyond ordinary."}
{"text":"waited for 10 mins and heard them arguing about whose table we were.   if the workers are that lazy to bus tables i can only imagine what the food is like..."}
{"text":"Best place for breakfast in Champaign. A friendly staff, good food, reasonable prices."}
{"text":"I love coffee.  I love Sammie's coffee.  It's always really fresh.  They also have all different flavors of non-dairy creamer.    The service was just alright.  My breakfast was virtually grease-free:)  Two things really bothered me about my meal....the cheese on my eggs (a partially melted slab of cheddar placed on top of scrambled).  I prefer my cheese melted and mixed in.  My oatmeal came out luke warm.    I love the interior.  It reminds me of a trolley diner."}
{"text":"Had breakfast here with family on a Sunday before the Church crowd came in and it was crowded! Not a long wait to get seated however. Food took a while since there were only two waitresses tending tables but the food was worth the wait. Had a Hawaiian Omelette that was to die for. Not in a bad location but the area seems a little run down. Think Waffle House type locations."}
{"text":"I really liked the place.  My son in law and I went with the Mexican breakfast fare and it was great (clearly their specialty - I assume from the guy at the cash register that it might be a family owned Mexican business and the folks in the back know what they are doing with those dishes).  The coffee was good, and the younger kids with us liked the pancakes, etc.  The waitress, whose name I cannot remember, was one of those great experienced midwestern or southern waitress types with lots of advice, lots of entertaining things to say, etc., that can make a meal memorable."}
{"text":"This used to be our favorite breakfast spot. Unfortunately, the last two times we have been it has been less than satisfactory. Bad service and bad food. Our table was dirty for 10 minutes while we waited for coffee and water. They weren't even busy. If you're considering Sammy's I would go elsewhere. (Don't get their lunch, it was gross)"}
{"text":"AVOID THIS PLACE!!!   CHANGE OF RATING DUE TO A RUDE, DISRESPECTFUL OWNER/MANAGER/HOST.   This was once my favorite place for breakfast.  I've been going to Sammy's since it was in the strip mall on Duncan and Kirby.  I've regularly brought my family there for breakfast (ten of us).  Never again.  I do crossword puzzles and bring a book into a restaurant to work on while I await my food.  Occasionally, between bites, I'll fill in a word.  I never dally over the puzzle, especially if a restaurant is busy.  I have been in many crowded restaurants and was able to eat and do my puzzle without incident.  This morning, I was half way through my meal and chewing on my food when I stopped to write in a word.  The owner came to me and said he had customers waiting and I should hurry.  Sorry, but I like to chew my food between bites.  Had he bothered to notice, he would have seen that I did not, at any time, sit there filling out the puzzle while ignoring my food.  He said nothing to other tables that were dallying over conversations after already finishing their food while I still had most of my meal to eat.  No.  I was a senior dining alone, so fair game for his arrogance.  What I should have done was say, \"Screw you!\" and take my time, have more coffee, relax, but I was taken by surprise and lost my appetite.  I went to pay and told him I did not appreciate his actions.  He was completely unapologetic, very dismissive, quite arrogant, and basically said I should take my business elsewhere.  Huh?  Okay, I shall.  So should you.  You may be the next table asked to gobble down your food to make room for someone else."}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast- Western omelette is a favorite. Friendly staff. Split a meal for $1 extra, large portions."}
{"text":"Maybe it's because I'm from the Chicagoland area and I was expecting more, but this place was average at best.  My standards are pretty high for breakfast (See Red apple Pancake House in Carol Stream). I went here for lunch on a Saturday afternoon, and there was about 5 other people in the restaurant, including the staff.  First off, why can't you sub fruit for hash browns? I understand an upcharge, but saying you \"can't\" do it? Come on. So, I ended up paying 3 extra dollars for fruit, and I didn't get hash browns, because there's nothing good about them unless their doused in ketchup.  My egg beater omelet with broc, mushroom, tomato, and avocado was very good. The salsa on the side was an excellent compliment. If I was rating on just the omelete (sans price), I would give a 5. But charging different amounts for different ingredients really grinded my gears.  I also ordered a short stack of multigrain cakes with banana. Those were decent, but kind of small.  Two meals, with all the upcharges, plus coffee, for 28 bucks. MERCY! I will probably not return because I'm not in the area that often. I will go elsewhere in Champaign for some bfast"}
{"text":"Me and my husband came here at 6:30am one morning and waited nearly 10 minutes at the door to be seated, there was only one other person in the restaurant. When we were finally seated we ordered and our food arrived fairly quickly. I ordered French toast which was not even warm, tasted like it had been in a refrigerator and then set out for 5-10 minutes before it was served to me. It tasted good but was not warm at all so i could barely enjoy it. My husband's food wasn't bad, he enjoyed it. We weren't going to say anything until we got our bill and realized that we had been charged $8.25 for our meals instead of $7.75 as advertised on the menu. I asked the waitress, \"I don't think this price is right. Both of ours were supposed to be $7.75.\" And she said \"no, that's right.\" I said, \"I'm pretty sure it's supposed to be cheaper.\" She just shook her head and then swiped my card. Very sketchy...will not be returning."}
{"text":"The food was not that great with the exception of cinnamon toast. Biscuits and gravy had partially stale biscuits. Hollandaise sauce seemed as if it were canned before serving and scrambled eggs came out cold. Will not be returning, but I can totally see how this place can become locals' favorite given the atmosphere."}
{"text":"It's hard to screw up breakfast but these guys managed to do it. I start with coffee and it had to have been the cheapest brand they were able to get it was awful. I mention this to the waitress and she didn't charge me for it. Then my breakfast came I ordered two eggs, bacon, hashbrowns and wheat toast. The potatoes must've been a week old they were also terrible. Instead of two eggs I got four eggs. The eggs are cooked correctly. The manager was to my right and complained about his weekend the whole time I was there. Customers don't want to hear this. My friend told me this place was mediocre. I think he was being a little generous. The only reason I gave them two stars because the waitress there did a nice job. There's too many other places that do breakfast better for you to waste your money here. Go to one of those places."}
{"text":"Amazing breakfast! French toast was phenomenal and so was the western omelette !  We will definitely be back :-)"}
{"text":"On a fluke, we went here on Easter morning for a quick breakfast before hitting the road to visit out of town relatives.  It was our first visit.  Even though we have lived in town for over twenty years, we never stopped in because it's not in the best neighborhood.  With that being said, we were very pleasantly surprised.  The interior was very clean and homey in a diner sort of way.  All the staff we encountered were so friendly and attentive.  We all enjoyed our breakfast, and there were many choices on the menu.  I would much rather go here than Denny's or OHOP-no wait and similar food.  Sammy's, you have a group of new customers!"}
{"text":"This is my first visit to Sammie's.  Very very pleasant place. Very nice hostess/server greeted me inside the door and promptly took me to my table.  The table set (see picture) is just lovely.  Everything seems to be done with taste at Sammie's. I'm hoping the food here is just as tasty.  The food arrived piping hot within 5 minutes of the order being placed. I surprised how quickly as a matter of fact.   my standard breakfast food is a ham and cheese omelette. this one did not disappoint in the least. Light and fluffy egg with my choice of american, swiss, or cheddar cheese. I elected cheddar. I think this is the only time I've been given a choice for the cheese in an omelette .. ever. Omelettes I make at home most always have cheddar in them too!  The steamy potatoes were excellent. The pancakes followed suit.  I took a picture of my breakfast before I devoured it.  This was a totally delightful experience. Will definitely be back.  5 stars."}
{"text":"Definitely my favorite breakfast spot in CU.  Great, busy place.  Staff always friendly. Omelettes are amazing.  Claim best B&G's in town, but don't meet my B&G taste buds. Found that if you want to beat the Saturday morning crowd arrive between 815-830. We were seated right away. By time we were done eating, standing at door waiting for a table.  Definitely worth the wait and trip."}
{"text":"Had lunch at Sammys restaurant today on North Mattis and enjoying my meal when a family comes in and sits down at the booth next to me and immediately this waitress comes over and starts raising hell with the woman about some personal issue...(she seemed to know her personally). The customer walks up to tell the manager and he does absolutely nothing about it. She walks back to her family and says \"Let's go somewhere else....that bitch ain't gonna talk to me like that!\" As they was leaving the manager asked why they were leaving...I didnt hear her response but I was thinking....Uhhh it's pretty obvious!! You let your staff yell at customers at your place of business and don't do anything about it!! VERY UNPROFESSIONAL!! I couldn't believe the manager didn't reprimand the waitress .... he just sat up at the cash register while the waitress is in the back bitching loudly. Quality place ya got there Sammys!! I won't be back!!"}
{"text":"I'll be honest, I went into this expecting nothing spectacular because let's be honest from the outside it looks a little sketchy. As soon as I walked in I was greeted kindly and sat by a middle aged gentleman. The menu is pretty big, good selection of breakfast foods. I went for scrambled eggs, bacon, hash browns and pancakes. Eggs and bacon were great, hard to mess those up. I was pleasantly surprised with the hash browns which were a unique shape kind of like a mix between American style and shredded. The pancakes were also really good! Very hot and fluffy. Wait staff is very kind, would recommend for a simple delicious breakfast."}
{"text":"Incredibly stingy pricing for what you get. The menu kind of made my eyes pop out, and I'm from a larger city with higher prices (but there, at least you usually get what you pay for.) I noticed a listing for a plain waffle, no extras, no egg on the side or anything, for 7 dollars. Really.  I got the Champaign special with \"fresh\" apple cinnamon pancakes - regular buttermilk pancakes that they top with some canned apple pie filling and a squirt of Reddi Whip. This was almost $10.   I ordered a hot tea. Folks, I never thought I'd wax nostalgic for Bob Evans chain restaurant. At BE, they hook you up. A selection of QUALITY teas, lemon slice, fresh mint, honey if you want, and for about 2 or 3 bucks.  At Sammy's, you get... Lukewarm water and one Lipton tea bag. For 2.05 plus tax. They'll bring you more \"hot\" water, no problem. I must say, our server was lovely. She's sweet and cheerful and a credit to the business. She was the best part of our experience.  That having been said, if you're going to charge as much as a box of tea for one stingy Lipton bag and THEN upcharge for another ONE bag of cheap Lipton, you should probably disclose that this tea will cost you a higher percentage upcharge than if the place bought ten dollar bottles of wine and served it for $20 a glass. I was charged over 4 dollars for 2 cheap Lipton tea bags. Pretty stingy and shabby compared to every other place I've been. We inquired as to what the upcharge was, since it was never disclosed. We then politely paid and quietly left.  This restaurant has the right and prerogative to set their prices as they please. We have the right and prerogative to never visit them again."}
{"text":"Food out in less than 10 minutes Pancakes and French toast rock Really good breakfast food. Not too sweet, using quality ingredients. May be a tad expensive, but quality is superb."}
{"text":"I love my favorite Steak Burrito at Sammy's! We've been coming here for over ten years since they were at their prior location. Always excellent food, prices and service."}
{"text":"Every time I visit Sammy's Pancake House, it's always packed with customers!  Many of the students from the U of I or even the locals love to have breakfast or brunch, and it is one of the must go places.  Their breakfast menus are great and it comes in large portions :)  The staffs are very friendly and kind, and they'll do everything to make sure you're satisfied with your food and overall experiences.  Make sure to stop by at least once while you're in CU."}
{"text":"I just wanted to update my review to give some more information about the food at Sammie's. Some other reviewers have mentioned high prices. Sammie's is not a cheap breakfast, but the portions are big, the quality of ingredients is high, and the preparation is excellent. The quality of food is consistently delicious.  Although the owner is a Mexican American and the menu includes a fair number of foods that are Mexican, the owner worked for his earlier career in Greek-American food in Chicago, so those items are there, as well as more basic Midwestern cuisine. All are equally good. One of the best menu items is the banana bread french toast. To die for. The haystack and sausage gravy is also super. I have not had a bad meal at Sammie's, and we've been going for many years, from an earlier location to the present.  Can't recommend this place enough."}
{"text":"I had the western omelette and it was delicious! The boy had some French toast with a side of Bacon&sausage, and he loved it:)"}
{"text":"Finally tried their biscuits and gravy and they aren't lying they are the best in town.  It's also everything a diner should be: big portions, fast service by friendly waitresses that call everyone sugar or hun. I just wish they had better coffee then this place would be perfect."}
{"text":"What a great local joint right off of I-57. I live in Paxton, Illinois where the breakfast  is limited to bars, Arcade Pancake House, and Country Garden Restaurant. So Champaign is the breakfast location. Tried Original Pancake House last week, so it was Sammie's Pancake this week!  A lot of Mexican items (due to the Mexican owners) so that was unique. Build your omelet was the option that I would decide on this trip. I wish I could have subbed fruit for potatoes/Greek Toast. I also took an up charge on multi grain pancakes. I don't get the penalty for being \"healthier\" in this country, but then again I understand it comes down to the bottom line...hell ya capitalism.  Pancakes were good...asked for fresh blueberries but got glaze instead. I even mentioned when I ordered \"fresh blueberries please\". The waitress didn't seem to have a lot of intelligence (that's mean of me) but why not tell me you don't have fresh blueberries...before I get my pancakes, not when you bring them out.  A little pricey, especially since the whole blueberry fiasco. I didn't mind much because I was hungry.  I will go back for sure. This waitress was very nice and prompt, but please don't keep secrets from me. I promise if you want this relationship to work out that we have to be upfront with each other. I am not asking you how many sexual partners you had. Fresh or glaze babe. That's all."}
{"text":"Worst breakfast food I have ever tasted. Microwaved fake lumpy sausage and rubber eggs. They also claim to have the best biscuits in town but pancake house has way better! Their pancakes were ok I guess. Service was also terrible and all staff very quiet and not friendly. Overpriced, nasty food! I don't know how they have good reviews."}
{"text":"A great place to get breakfast as evidenced by how busy this place gets on the weekends.  Portions are large; I typically get an omelette and end up taking half of it home. Its true you'll pay about $12-15 per person, but for me, you end up getting breakfast and lunch out of it.   I am almost exclusively an egg/meat/potato/toast breakfast eater, but the pancakes are so good that I order them from time to time. My friends LOVE the french toast as well.   Get there before 9:30 for a short wait."}
{"text":"We found Sammy's a bit off campus and were seated quickly for a Sunday Brunch. The menu is expansive and has plenty of options to choose from, such as several different skillets to cinnamon pancakes and more. The waitress was attentive and checked in on us numerous times throughout our stay. The food came out in a fair amount of time and was hot and delicious. We both ordered skillets, which came with either toast or pancakes (your choice). The skillets (Country Skillet & Vegetarian Skillet) were delicious! Overall very pleased with the visit for numerous reasons which offers delicious food for a reasonable price. The bang for your buck is tremendous!"}
{"text":"Just went once the pancakes had uncooked batter powder in them and the other food was just so-so. Can get much better at le peep, pancake house, or SNS for that matter. Avoid."}
{"text":"Sammy's is pretty good. There's nothing wrong with it here, but it would probably be the third or fourth place I'd choose to go in town. I haven't had anything that I'd consider above-average when compared to other local breakfast places, but I also haven't had anything that I'd consider below-average."}
{"text":"I wanted to \"eat local\" during my weekend in U/C and my friend happened to live nearby and liked this place. There aren't a lot of seats so the wait appeared to be longer than quoted to us; we were sat within ~10 minutes. Surprising since this was the Sunday post-church/brunch crowd. The coffee was poured immediately as we sat down, and it was hot, tasty and strong. She gave us as much time as we needed to order - both of us got skillets with pancakes [I got the Denver, sub sausage for ham]. Definitely a lot of good food for a good price. I wish I had more space in my stomach for more of my pancakes - I couldn't stop eating the skillet [even though it didn't have a lot of cheese on it]. Definitely worth a stop if I return to the area!"}
{"text":"Easily the best breakfast in CU.  buy one egg. Get one free.  Large portions.  Good prices.  Fast service.    According to my out of state buddy, best creamer selection too.     Omlettes are amazing.  Cinnamon roll French toast is second to none.  Eggs properly cooked. Bacon your way.      Locally owned. No chain food here.  Well worth the stop.  Location is easy to get to as well. Just about a mile north of 72 and mattis."}
{"text":"No wait. Quick service. Good food. I had the veggie skillet with a side of pancakes. I'm normally skeptical about pancakes but these were fluffy and tasty."}
{"text":"Nice, local breakfast place on a commercial strip (great parking, no wait early on a Sunday morning). The servers are friendly and efficient, and there are a lot of breakfast choices on the menu, mostly combinations of eggs, French toast, and pancakes. Husband enjoyed his Mexican skillet, which included delicious chorizo. Will definitely stop here again en route through Champaign."}
{"text":"I've been here twice. The first time was so good I couldn't wait to go back. The second time the service was awful the waiter couldn't answer questions about the menu and when we got our food it was completely bland. It was a horrible experience and I unfortunately won't be back. For their prices I would expect great every time."}
{"text":"Went on a holiday for a (VERY) late brunch. We both had the biscuits and gravy. It truly is the best in town. The only place I've been that properly seasons the gravy with an ample amount of black pepper, and nothing unexpected like a bunch of rosemary or shit like that. The biscuits are kind of flat, but they have a good flavor and aren't too hard. Good coffee, glass of tomato juice that wasn't the size of a thimble. Service was on point. This place isn't fancy, but you can get a damn good breakfast that won't break the bank."}
{"text":"Food was great! Coffee delishes! Lemon water mmmmm.....french toast yum yum and best biscuits in town!"}
{"text":"I got the \"Hillbilly Skillet\". I felt kind of awkward ordering it because it was called hillbilly, but it looked good on the menu. It was really good, and I switched my pancakes for French creeps, which were really good. There was SO MUCH FOOD! It was well worth the price. I only wish the waitress had let me look at the menu for a moment before making me order a beverage - I would have had juice instead of soda. I will go back again, but I think I'll order an entree with less potatoes."}
{"text":"The service was okay but the food was slow   I was surprised it took so long to get a breakfast when only 3 people were in the building. I'll look for somewhere else next time in Champaign"}
