{"text":"Tragically bad overpriced food. Avoid avoid avoid. Well known in ste Anne's that this place keeps switching owners and staff. Go anywhere else on the boardwalk."}
{"text":"En résumé : mauvais service , mauvaise nourriture.  À éviter (il y a de bien meilleures alternatives toutes proches).

Nous y sommes allés pour le souper avec les enfants - le menu pour enfants est affiché sur le napperon à 7.99$ avec breuvage et dessert.  Toutefois, une fois les commandes passées, voyant que les enfants ne recevaient pas de breuvages, la serveuse nous apprend que le menu pour enfant à été change 'cet été' (nous sommes maintenant en septembre), et que le breuvage est maintenant .99$, le dessert 1.99$... Un peu tard pour nous en aviser!  On demande à voir le gérant (je pense que c'est le proprio qui vient)-- il ne trouve qu'à hausser les épaules...  
Malheureusement, la qualité de la nourriture n'a pas du tout compensé pour cette déception- trop froid, cuisson imparfaite, portion inégales...  Bref, ceci fut notre dernière visite. 
On aurait dû regarder les avis Yelp avant d'y aller, ça nous apprendra! ;)"}
{"text":"Great food and great service.   Thank you Darrell you made our experience fantastic

Order was fish and chips and the butcher burger which was awesome.  The atmosphere was friendly as everyone from the staff greets you."}
{"text":"Je ne sais pas pourquoi il est impossible de trouver une bonne place sur la promenade de St. Anne de Bellevue.  Il doit y avoir 15 restaurants et bars face à l'eau mais tout ceux que j'ai essayés sont médiocres.  C'est le cas de klondike.  Bien situé sur le bord l'eau, avec un intérieur  pas trop mal.  Il y avait même la bière Cobra que j'ai essayée pour la première fois, pas mal.  Mais la bouffe!  Vraiment pas.  Nous sommes allés pour des nachos et ailes de poulet, un beau dimanche après-midi.  Les chips étaient vielles.  Les nachos étaient servis dans un bol étroit, chips dans le fond et fromage sur le dessus.  Donc seulement quelques chips avaient du fromage. Le reste était sec.  De plus je jurerais que c'était de la sauce tomate italienne et non de la salsa mexicaine.  Les ailes de poulet, un peu perdues dans une grade assiette sont venues avec la sauce à côté, sauce BBQ, pas d'autre choix, et rien d'autre.  Le service: moche."}
{"text":"Worst ever, lunch menu includes soup, which was the most liquid cream of tomato soup, tasted ok.  Salad bar included salad greens old and wilted from last night the worst was the mold on the baguette, i returned the bread and they brought back cold ciabata.... Ordered from the lunch menu pasta which was half cold/hot we returned it and asked for the chicken tortilla wasn't bad but you had to look for the chicken.  The comment from the server was i guess it wasn't your day ... We will never go there again  and never recommend it.u"}
{"text":"Nous avons attendu 15 minutes pour notre facture.   Les vèrre etais salle et glace fondu alors qui met en doute combien de temp il etais sur place. Les ordis ne marchaient pas on n'a meme pas été désommagé. Au lieu les commande on etait mis écris sur papier a main dechirer."}
{"text":"Malpropre et trop cher!
C'était ridicule! Pire restaurant que j'ai connue et je suis serveuse...."}
{"text":"I went there with my best friend once and we pretended we were an obviously gay couple just for the heck of it. (Weird friendship, I know. I've known the prick since I'm 7)

Everyone saw through our game and tagged along, asking me if he was on his period when he went to the bathroom and telling me I should upgrade if he's not good enough. VERY VERY VERY friendly staff, love them! The only girl that didn't tag along was a newbie that didn't quite get it and was stressed out by the job.

Prices were pretty decent. They also have a student 12$ per meal menu which is quite worth it in my opinion. The fish and chip and snails were delicious, the service was impeccable and the best I ever received in my life.

The greeter also told my friend I'll be wearing the pants in the relationship since I ordered dry vodka martinis and he orders lychee martinis. Very funny people, decent prices (drinks were a bit expensive but it was to be expected with martinis and liquid cocaine), INCREDIBLY good looking restaurant, quiet and clean.

I love it!"}
{"text":"Waaaay over priced and horrible service take it off you places to eat. I ordered ribs and what I got was refrigerated ribs (still cold) with a ton of Luke warm BBQ sauce with way too much herb seasoning they did however deliver an ample amount of attitude in the so called \"customer service\". 

One is the lowest I can go otherwise it would be zero."}
{"text":"Everything was bland and dry. The waitress got my order wrong and never offered to replace my meal or even apologize. The service was horrible so was the food. DO NOT GO THERE."}
{"text":"went here with few friends for a sunday lunch.
the location is superb. it's right next to a river with a view to the water with small patio where you can enjoy your food and the view in the summer. 
the decorations.... well it's interesting. the ceiling and one of the walls kept the look and feel from the times when it was another restaurant and the other walls are now decorated accordingly to the restaurant's current name. 
but it adds some character and uniqueness to the restaurant. 

I'm not quite sure if that was lunch special only but with any main dish you were allowed to get a soup and a salad at the salad bar for no extra cost. 

the service was quick and very very attentive. I had many questions about veg options and was notified even abut the chicken broth in the soup. great job.

the only reason it gets 4 out of 5 starts is because the menu even though it has vegetarian section is very non veg friendly. the veg section is combined with pasta section and thus includes fish and beef... so... but anyway. I had a very yummy semi thai dish Kung Pao for $15 with mix of veggies, terriyaki sauce (no fish sauce in it - checked) and rice noodles. veg pizza with fries, smoked salmon, smoked chicked and other dishes we ordered from the special menu all for $12 were all very good too. 
great prices for the location and the atmosphere. 

and koodos to our waiter who even though very new on the job (2.5 days) did everything to make sure our needs are satisfied and questions are answered."}
{"text":"Pretty solid 2 stars. 

The location of this restaurant is beautiful and ideal, situated on the picturesque boardwalk of Ste Anne de Bellevue. Other than the really friendly service, everything else was lacking.

Out of all the restaurants on the boardwalk, this was the only one with a pretty hostess stationed at the door to greet and lure customers in. They probably rely on an attractive greeter in order to meet their daily budget.

We ordered a $17 set menu (soup, fish and chips, dessert) and a $24 set menu (soup, grilled shrimp and dessert). The soup was mushroom lentil. It was gritty and a bit salty but flavour was okay. The chips were great, and the grilled shrimp were good, but everything else was lacking. The fried fish had the \"dirt\" flavour of cheap white fish. The grilled vegetables accompanying the shrimp were overly oily and soggy. Dessert (\"churritos\") were doughy, but palatable (can't really screw up fried dough and cinnamon sugar). 

Lastly, I had an iced café latte ($4.75) which was definitely at least 80% water. 

Do not recommend. Walk further down the boardwalk for cheaper and more delicious options."}
{"text":"This place is okay. Large menu with too many choices. Nice terasse to eat on during the summer though."}
{"text":"Showed up with reservations and a small group.  Waiter was totally confused.  Actually deposited a plate in front of someone and came back to take it away and bring to another table.  WOW!!  We had to ask for coffee and to pay.  Waiter started collecting without receipts.  Food was good!  Manager nice, just our waiter.  It did not seem to be his place waiting on people."}
{"text":"For the first time in ages I felt like turning into Gordon Ramsey over (A) the way too extensive menu, (B) the execrable \"salad bar\" that is an insult to salad bars everywhere, (C) the silliest plates I have ever seen in a restaurant (basically a small bowl with a wide brim which makes cutting anything well-nigh impossible), (D) the half burnt half raw and cold salmon \"steak\" I was served with (E) a way overly drenched pasta that tasted like nothing but acidic tomatoes and last but not least (F) the too loud music that made conversation difficult at best. No wonder they were giving away coupons to the place on the boardwalk. Never going back ever."}
{"text":"Je cherchais  un restaurant a sainte Anne de Bellevue. A quelques reprises j'ai essayé les différentes terrasses sans trouvé un restaurant qui voulait que j'y retourne. Ce n'est malheureusement pas différent ici. En ce beau lundi après-midi nous sommes accueillis gentiment a la porte et nous pouvions choisir une table sur le bord du bordwalk. La serveuse Rachel est venu rapidement nous saluer, nous expliquer le menu et nous offrir un apéro. Je voulais commander 2 verres de vins mais elle s'est empressé de nous décourager de prendre un verre seulement puisqu'il est a 9$ chacun et qu'une bouteille est 'seulement' 25$. Le genre de 'gammick' pour vendre des bouteilles seulement.  Un menu lunch a 12$ avec un bar a salade inclus semble intéressant et c'est pour cette raison que j'ai choisi le resto. Je choisi donc le sous marin au steak Philly et ma copine celui au poulet.  Les deux servis avec frites. Rien a redire sur les deux sandwichs. Pain et ingrédients frais. Mais pour les frites c'est manqué. Des frites congelées sans goûts. Pour ce qui est du bar a salade, rien d'impressionnant. Salade verte, de légumineuses et de pâtes. Malheureusement , un autre restaurant qui je vais ajouter sur la traité liste de restaurants pour touriste."}
{"text":"4 overly salty shrimps on frozen fries for $25. Mussles in a bad tomato sauce. 
This place takes advantage of Ste-Anne-de-Bellevue summer traffic. 
Needs a new chef and an owner who cares not to screw customers. The waiter was scared to ask his boss to intervene.
I took customer there. It was my worse Montreal meal in years."}
{"text":"Sorry folks, but it was the worst steak i have ever had (and I'm 60!!)...pretty good service and menu but i guess i chose the wrong steak.i told the waiter when he asked how my meal was that is was not a good steak he simply shrugged his shoulders. Next time I will be walking past this place!"}
{"text":"Une soirée gâchée. J'étais à la recherche d'un bon steak house et je suis tombé sur cet endroit qui est un genre de casa grec en plus mauvais encore. J'ai eu le malheur de choisir un plat de moules. Le cuisinier (dans une tentative de faire une mauvaise blague?) avait foutu une salade par-dessus les moules pour ensuite les faire gratiner avec fromage fêta. Le tout donnait un mélange raté qui ne ressemblait à rien de connu sur cette planète. Ma bien-aimée à eu droit à une brochette de buf accompagnée de frites tièdes. Le tout pour une facture de 70$. Le décors est une mauvaise imitation de ranch entremêlé des restants de l'ancien resto qui devait être portugais à juger par les peintures aux murs. C'est vraiment n'importe quoi !"}
{"text":"Horrible service! The pictures of the food do not correspond to what your gonna get. Cold food and just overall bad service!"}
{"text":"I was in Canada to lay my mother's ashes to rest.  My family met my cousin the night before at Marco's restaurant and we loved the area so we decided to come back.  I agree with another person saying they have an attractive young lady at the door to \"lure\" people in.  The décor is lovely, the view is wonderful.  The food and drinks are average to below average, and I definitely do NOT recommend the steak!  What a joke it is that they call themselves a steakhouse.  My Dad and husband ordered fish and chips which were fair, but it came with a spicy mayo type sauce instead of traditional tartar.  I have to say in all the years I have traveled to Montreal I have never had an average or bad meal up until our lunch here.  The food in Montreal is amazing, and the beef is beyond compare.  I decided to order a 6 ounce filet mignon (medium-medium rare).  The presentation was exciting, but the meat was super well done.  As soon as the server saw it she immediately said they would re cook a new one.  The second one was gross.  First of all, it was definitely NOT filet.  It was super fatty, really tough and stringy, and they butterflied the meat to cook it which tells me it was probably frozen.  To make it worse, they actually put Old Bay seasoning on the meat?!  I tried to take a few bites but it was really awful.  I am a very good cook, and I cook Filet Mignon on my grill here and know it only takes about 5-6 minutes a side to get it perfect. Plus, filet is always tender.  We didn't make a big deal out of it, and I told our apologetic waitress to feed it to her dog.  The staff was all nervous and the vibe was really off.  As I was leaving I saw a man who seemed to be the owner yelling at a busboy and I figured the owner was a jerk.  They did not take the meat off the bill, which they should have really.  To call this place a \"premier steakhouse\" is like saying McDonalds is a \"premier\" hamburger joint.  Also, we ordered a cocktail (long island iced tea) and it barely tasted like it had alcohol in it.  I would only recommend this place if you are ordering a draft beer and maybe the escargot or a salad.  I would have given this place even 3 stars but the owner's handling of the situation put the whole staff on edge, and made us pay for food that wasn't edible.  Even if they took part of the 28$ off it would have been fair since I did eat fries and the grilled vegetables.  I felt sorry for the staff."}
