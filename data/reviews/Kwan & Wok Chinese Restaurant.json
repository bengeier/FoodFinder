{"text":"Beef and broccoli is tasty and the beef is very tender, fried rice is delicious. Everything is made fresh-to-order. Very reasonable price."}
{"text":"If one star means \"Eek! Methinks not,\" then one star it is.  I'm not even sure what I got from here was food!   The outside is shady indeed, the inside is in fact shadier, and the food and service... you get the idea.  I ordered the beef and broccoli lunch which included fried rice - a safe bet at any Chinese place.  What I ended up with seemed like some sort of gelatinized beef fat... at least I hope.  If it wasn't fat, I have no clue what it was.  And the fried rice looked something like rice, but I don't even know how to describe what it tasted like.  Needless to say, I didn't take 3 bites of the plate before throwing it out.  And I kind of feel sick just thinking about it.  I haven't found a great Chinese place in Phoenix yet, but I can guarantee you I'd avoid even driving past this place -- and I suggest you do the same."}
{"text":"they must have changed the cook this place used to be great but the order i got last week was crap tasteless muck i have used this place for ten years but i will use it no more after last week"}
{"text":"Great fried rice and chow mein I ever eaten  in Phoenix. There Is a new menu since it been open for 17th  year"}
{"text":"I ate there yesterday ordered chicken teriyaki the chicken tastes old today is Sunday so I guess I didn't get sick. Staff unfriendly seems like college kids there I've been there 3 times last time."}
{"text":"Chicken in garlic sauce is my fave. Just thought I'd state that. Let's see, good amount for your buck. Lunch specials are cool. They deliver! Simple and to the point!"}
{"text":"I ordered today a delivery order and was told it would be about 45 minutes. An hour and a half later, I called back to check on the order and was informed \"the guy is on his way\" and then was hung up on. I called back and asked what the delay was and had the food been driving around for the past hour or what's going on.  I was told \"look, u want the food or not? I just don't care. I will cancel the order if you want\"   I DO CARE!!!  I asked to speak with owner or manager and was told, \"look nobody cares so take it or leave it\".  RUDE and RUDE   NOT Recommended!!!"}
{"text":"The people who reviewed this place are tripping! This place is so delicious, I ordered the special and my husband ordered the teriyaki chicken and rice. We came in late right before closing and they were very nice and still served us and let us eat and take our time dining even though they were supposed to be closed. I also brought in my own soda from home which no place would let you do. There is a little smell to the place but considering the kitchen is open, it's understandable. If it bothers you, just take the food to go. This place is one of those places you don't want to try but once you do, you can't stop going back!"}
{"text":"Up until 4pm, lunch specials are offered at $6.01 including tax. The place is very clean and quiet, and from what I've heard in under new management. My food was really good."}
{"text":"Very good!! I've eaten here once and I continue to stop here for lunch or dinner when I want some good Chinese food. I highly recommend this place to my friends and family"}
{"text":"If three stars in Yelp parlance is \"A-OK\" then I give this place three stars.  It's been my Chinese delivery option for nearly five years, and everything that I've ever ordered from them has been slightly above average.  If you're being a hermit for the night and want reliable Chinese delivery, then this place is as good as most, and better than some.   As a side note, I once decided to pick-up my order rather than have it delivered, and based on what I saw, I'd probably not eat on-site.  The actual restaruant is singularly unappealing from the inside.  That doesn't factor into my rating in this review, however, as their delivery has never been anything other than prompt and their prices reasonable."}
{"text":"Perfectly great inexpensive American Chinese food! I know my egg foo young and crab rangoons and I approve of these items at Kwan & Wok! The staff were very nice and friendly - so ignore those earlier reviews. I'm glad they left a menu on my apartment door - so now I have a good close cheap Chinese take out option!  BTW - there is plenty of parking! Bonus."}
{"text":"My first delivery Chinese food in Phoenix. I did not hate it but have not gone since. For a solo eater 20 bucks minimum sucks. The food was good and prompt, continue supporting local businesses."}
{"text":"Great little place for inexpensive yet tasty Chinese food. Lunch combo comes with a can of soda too so that's a bonus. Service has been pretty good so far."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place 5 stars for several reasons.  Under normal circumstances I would rate the food a 3-4, but I'm giving them an extra star for service AND an extra star for transparency (I shall explain below).    Here's the deal.  I love my asian food more than most and in particular I grew up eating some of the most amazing Chinese in Philadelphia because my dad's whole family worked at a Chinese restaurant.  We had it at least 2-3 times a week. My mom ate it when she was preggers with me and I think I have about a half a Chinese chromosome because of that.  That said, I'm usually pretty discerning about Chinese food and in most cases I'm hyper critical of the fried rice and the lo mein.  My roommate wanted us to order from Kwan & Wok the other nite because it was raining, we were both feeling lazy and he wanted delivery.  I rallied for my fave Diamonds just down the street, but as it was Wednesday, they were closed. So I capitulated and said I'd give Kwan & Wok a try.  The roomie's had it before and loves that they deliver.  We didn't have a menu on-hand, but sure enough they have a very efficient little website with clear images of their menu.  Nice! Everything we ordered was from this page:  http://www.kwanandwok.com/menu6.html  Now my first reaction when I saw the website was \"oh gross....they admit that this is Chinese FAST FOOD\".  My roomie doesn't know from good Chinese and thinks that Panda Express is the bee's knees. We selected several items and called in our order: Egg Flower Soup, Pork Fried Rice, PorkEgg Foo Young and  House Lo Mein.  How long is the wait, I ask.  He says the guy said 45 minutes (and I grumble with the hungry grumpies), but I bet it'll be here sooner, my roomie speculates. Sure as sunshine in Arizona, the doorbell rings 20 minutes later and the order was 100% correct and faster than expected!  We unpack everything & everything looks great, smells delicious and tastes even better!  Bonus materials -- we got 1 1/2 cartons of white rice (I've noticed that my fave Diamonds does not give you white rice unless you specifically ask for it).  We also got a nice assortment of condiments, fortune cookies AND a free batch of crab puffs!  Score! K&W wins an extra star for service; (1) super fast delivery and (2) free goodies go a long way!  The egg foo young was AMAZING!!  The lo mein, awesome. The soup, good. The fried rice was actually OK, considering the name of the restaurant and here's where I'm giving another extra star for transparency.  Kwan & Wok doesn't portend to be a fancy-schmancy upscale joint. They don't even pretend to be pedestrian fare.  The actual name of the restaurant, as indicated on their website and menu is \"Kwan & Wok Chinese Fast Food\" -- and that's what it was.  I wouldn't go to McDonalds if I wanted Ruth's Chris and I wouldn't go to Pizzeria Bianco expecting Domino's schlock.  Kwan & Wok tells you right up front, \"we are fast food\" and that's what it is. For that matter, the food did arrive super fast AND frankly I think their Egg Foo Young & Lo Mein had better flavor than a lot of places I've tried.  I will definitely order from them again and hope that future experiences are consistent with my first, when I'm in the mood/need for Chinese Fast Food!"}
{"text":"Horrible! The food has no flavor and the egg flour soup is so gross...no flavor at all! Will never order from there again! What s waste of $."}
{"text":"Once the new owner took over the place it's definitely not the same, I gave them a chance in 3 separate occasions but it's definitely not the same, I used to love coming to this place because their fried rice was AMAZING, chicken fried rice, chicken lo mein to die for and their prices were affordable. I wish they never left."}
{"text":"Food is okay here and the price is right. A little too much soy sauce but the flavor is right. I got beef with vegetables and food came out quickly. I ordered to-go. Before I left the restaurant I checked that there were no utensils in the bag so I asked for some."}
{"text":"$7 for crappy won tons!!! I won't make this mistake again!!! Save your money and find real food elsewhere"}
{"text":"Don't be fooled by the run down decor...this place has some good Chinese food! We've ordered a variety of dishes and enjoyed all of them; some of the more memorable dishes are the teriyaki chicken, won ton soup, the chicken and noodles (I forgot the name) and the chicken skewer appetizer. We recently moved to this area and have only been here twice. Both times our total was more than $25 and we received 3 free spring rolls.  These were delicious as well. They have large portions and the entrees are enough for at least two meals."}
{"text":"The staff is extremely rude. They have absolutely no knowledge of customer service. Placed an order and the person who answered the phone said 15min for delivery. After over an hour, I called to check on the status and the they said we dont deliver and hug up on me. They've definitely lost myself and my friends as customers."}
{"text":"I called in a pick up order on a whim after my friend unenthusiastically told me it was pretty good for fast, cheap Chinese food. I decided to order the family meal which comes with fried rice, chow mien, 2 entrees, 4 egg rolls and 4 almond cookies, and says it could feed 4. I ordered it just for me and my girlfriend because I love leftover Chinese. After refusing a substitution the gentleman said it would be ten minutes. Ten minutes! I'm not ready! I bolted over to the place immediately to find that he honored my substation request anyway! And of course it was hot and waiting for me. I realized after taking the bag from the kind sir that this was likely 10 lbs of food in my hand and probably needs some two hand support. The aroma on the way home had me salivating.   I'll just let you know, this place has 4 stars already just from the service, speed, price and convenient location, but they deserve several more for the quality and flavor of their food. It was very clearly freshly prepared to order, as the vegetables were perfectly cooked with just enough snap, and the meat very tender and not overcooked or stringy. The flavors were not overly salty or saucy and the application of sauce not overly saturated. The noodles in the chow mein were perfectly cooked, slightly al dente, and the chow mein and fried rice were flavorful but not very salty or greasy. I loved everything, especially considering the price and speed. I highly recommend and can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Always great food!! Prices are going up though. $40 is pretty expensive for two people. Can't go as much as I'd like."}
{"text":"I think we were the only people in here for lunch on a weekday, and I could see why.  This is the place that time has forgotten, old, tables and everything else. The menu was somewhat generic.  Our dishes were mediocre at best I don't have much to say other than there are many better choices for you."}
{"text":"from the outside this place looks hella shady and from the inside it's not any better. I was so hungry, i tried it anyways. i ordered the Kung Pow chicken, it was okay, better than some quick chinese food to go. however, they slice up the chicken so small that it's about the same size as the diced water creast. The rice is barely enough. the worst part have got to be the service. The cashier is this B*%ch who is unhappy about her work. She is rude to every customer and her tone of voice is just so mean. i would not go back because of the service."}
{"text":"If you go for the orange chicken and you do not like the new flavor that they are going for, simply ask for the old recipe and they will prepare it with the sweeter sauce which also results in a more crunchy chicken which I know I enjoy more. These guys are definitely making an effort to improve their customer service and I've noticed a serious improvement. If you've had a bad experience, mention it to one of them. They are quite receptive to constructive input."}
{"text":"I ordered from this place twice.  The first time was ok and the 2nd was horrible and they got my sweet and sour pork order wrong.  I tried to call in another order and the guy on the phone didn't let me explain what I wanted and told me to not order from there again if I wasn't happy.  I never went back, I think there are many other places where the food is way better than this place as well as the service.  I don't need to spend my money at a place that does not value it's customers.  Also, the place is a filthy dive."}
{"text":"Always a good price and fast service.  Their dine in experience is not very good but this place is mostly a fast food establishment.  The booth seats are kinda tight too so for more hefty people (260 or more) make sure you take your food to go."}
{"text":"Kwan and Wok is EXACTLY what you expect when you pull in to the tiny strip mall on the NW corner of Camelback and 17th Ave. Anchoring the weird parking layout and a bunch of asian stores (including a grocery and Pho restaurant), entering K&W is like stepping into any private chinese fast food/to-go restaurant in the United States. A cooler with soda by the can, non-descript beige walls, and only the humming of the fan greet you upon entrance. When I was in Tucson, Tokyo Rice Bowl was my standby for years. After only moments in K&W, I knew I was home. When the first guy who came out to take my order barely understood english, my knees quivered with memories of some of the best dining experiences of my life coming from a little white foldy top container.   I don't know why I even looked at the menu. I've looked at chinese to-go restaurant menus across the United States. I know what they offer. You know what they offer. They know what they offer. Our order of spring rolls, orange chicken, and house chow mein (and a can of Pepsi, of course) -- which, of course, came with white rice -- was right on par.  K&W is the real deal. When you feel like good old fashioned American-style chinese food, this is the only place to light rail."}
{"text":"EAT HERE - I LOVE THIS PLACE....so today I ordered delivery...... Honestly I could have said something wrong when I placed my order.. But it was the way the person over the phone responded to me when I called back- I just hungup the irritated because I eat here quite often......... before I could fix a plate, one of the owners was knocking at my door with the correct item .....at no charge by the way....NOW THAT'S CUSTOMER SERVICE ..... Thank you!!"}
{"text":"Lemon chicken isn't on the menu but they will let you order it, even for their lunch/dinner combos. The food here is really good, quality is amazing. This is one of my favorite Chinese places in the valley so I'm a little upset to see the mediocre rating on Yelp. This place isn't perfect, but the food speaks for itself."}
{"text":"this is a great Chinese grub spot. I have been going here for years. get some eggrolls"}
{"text":"Friendly new (younger personable) staff but the food is garbage. I ordered House Chicken for pickup.  I don't know what I ate, but it was old , crispy, and overly deep-fried warmed up leftover crap.  Nothing was distinguishable. The fortune cookie was the freshest thing (other than the rice) and that's probably a few months old."}
{"text":"It only gets a star because I HAVE to leave one to be able to review this place. I saw the bad reviews and thought it might just be because it is below average but still edible for she that is rushed, nearby, and just needs to eat.  WORSE Chinese food I have had my whole life... I mean as hungry as I was I could not force myself to eat it. I ordered the house chicken and the sauce had NO flavor and was just overly salted sludge. My boyfriends Mongolian beef was also absolutely disgusting. To make matter worse, but not surprisingly, I felt sick for the rest of the day. DO NOT EAT HERE."}
{"text":"This is the closest Chinese food place to our house- We order their chicken fried rice. No Bean Sprouts!  We can always count on the Fried rice to be good- The other dishes aren't our favorite."}
{"text":"A whole bunch of people ordered food from here today for lunch.  And I said what the heck, I'll try it.  The lunch prices are decent.  $4.56 for a rice bowl.  I got the #1 almond chicken.  It smelled like butt at first, but after taking a bite I knew the smell was from the oil or pan it was cooked in.  Which is fine, cause it sure didn't taste like the smell.  LOL  Big portion of meat compared to the portion of rice.  So, very nice.  Cannot comment on the place cause I didn't pick it up.  But I will try it again for lunch.  Yum!"}
{"text":"The Egg Rolls are pretty great, I think my favorite in Phoenix and only $0.99.  They are the fried kind with pork and cabbage.  Yum!  The other menu items are avg to good, depending..  I probably order from here one a month.  My favorites are the Mongolian Chicken, Chicken Egg Foo Young and the Egg Rolls.  My housemate doesn't like the onions in the Mongolian Chicken, I think it makes the dish!  Other reviews on here is correct about the place and decor.   They could improve things just by painting over the wood on the seating area.  Their website is down, as they were given a website because of the Light Rail expansion.  They were not given the ability to maintain it, and it is not down.  Thats too bad, now I have to keep and order off of their paper menu, just not as convenient.  I give this place 4 stars (80th percentile for my area of Phoenix).  Good Price, good Food, great deal if not just for the Egg Rolls."}
{"text":"Very typical strip mall-ish take out joint. Nothing special at all. Service is minimal and its obvious they just want to get your money and you to get out ASAP. Food was overcooked quite a bit and just not good."}
{"text":"Food was bland and uninteresting. Even for cheap Chinese the food was not good. I ended up throwing it all away."}
{"text":"If my dish had been named \"day old candied chicken\", I would still complain about how sweet and old it tasted. Well, OK, maybe the chicken itself wasn't old, but maybe the oil they were frying it in was? My stomach turned so much from the unabashed usage of sugar that I could not even finish half of my dish.   The \"crab wontons\" were also the sweetest I've ever had, by far. Regular cream cheese does not taste like this, what on earth are they doing? I could have tried my dining companion's shrimp lo mein, but that probably would have been a greater disappointment as she was not a fan--and she'll eat shrimp anything!   The restaurant itself is stuffy and kinda unkempt, with cardboard boxes and presumably other supplies stacked up next to some of the seating.   Normally I'd only 1-star an establishment after languishing through a combination of poor food and poor service. But for Kwan & Wok...it's literally the worst fast-Chinese I've had in at least a couple years. Incredibly gross. 'Meh' implies I could finish a meal and feel disappointed. When I can't do so, that's more of an 'eek!', don't ya think?"}
{"text":"I've been coming to this place on and off for about 3 years now and I love it. Wen I'm really in the mood I'll even drive out from across town for it! Their crab puffs and teriyaki chicken are the favorites coupled with, what I think is, the BEST fried rice ever! I think it's the bean sprouts or something... Seriously though, they're not much to look at but they're super delicious!"}
{"text":"First this is classic american Chinese cuisine - not classic Chinese or modern fusion. Now with that said Kwan and wok is pure classic Chinese comfort food!!! I have been eating here since i was 15 and it never ever lets me down. Bright red sweet and sour pork and tasty old school fried rice.   You would miss the location if you were not looking for it - its in a classic basic strip mall but what is inside is worth going out of your way for :) it has all the classic fried yumminess us city kids grew up On:))) all classics are awesome and portions are large so it goes beyond 2 servings :)   The oil is fresh and clean which is huge in quality fried food - im a huge believer that if we are eating fried - may it be worth it :))) this is worth a stop :))) i really love the chow mane and fried rice- all of the diff fried rice! The soup is greAt and even the egg rolls are awesome- they do have pork in them - heads up For my veggies in the house :)))  Its a takeout spot but if you do eat in- bathroom is clean and its by the light-rail. Why not 5 stars ? The crab puff use to be amazing and now it is more like a won ton :/ everything else is still amazing :) enjoy!"}
{"text":"In a land of horrible Chinese restaurants Kwan & Wok does an above average job. We ordered Beef & Broccoli and Sesame Chicken. The food showed up quickly and was still hot. The delivery driver left a bit to be desired and we did not get the ala carte sauces we ordered however overall the experience was greatest."}
{"text":"I love love love this place. A friend told me about it, and even though it's about 7 miles out of my way...I decided to try it. I go back often now! Super cheap, very good food, great service, nice folks, and did I mention....good food? It's definitely fast food Chinese, but when you're in the mood for that type Kwan & Wok is a must. Try the house special chicken, yum! The restaurant could do with a remodel, but hey...you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"Always consistent. Always delicious. Delivery is fast. Food is always hot. Can't beat the lunch specials. If u are in this area for lunch, it is the place to stop. If u are ordering for delivery they got there as well. May I recommend the Mei Fun"}
{"text":"Okay so I decided to be nice and try this place again for lunch.... I got the sweet and sour chicken combo...with an egg roll and fried rice. The rice was kinda blah didn't really like it this time. However, the chicken was pretty good, and the egg roll was as well.... not necessarily fantastic, but good enough to bump it up one star.... it is a low 3 star but still a 3 star. Likely will be back for lunch but maybe request steamed rice instead."}
{"text":"Great food. Nice people. Good prices. Tge staff is always helpful. Orders are always right. Good menu. Food is tasty. Only thing i dont like is the general so's cbicken. However that is just an opinion. I only don't like it because of personal reasons. It tasted pretty good. Food is never burnt always saucy."}
{"text":"Having only come here once I really liked it. The food is hot and the food is fresh. 2 day in a row coming here and I am hooked. Next time I will have it delivered to my house. :)"}
{"text":"Today was my  the First time trying this place. I got food  poisoning from the orange chicken lunch special. Worst pain ever! Never going back to this place"}
