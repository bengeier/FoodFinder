{"text":"This is probably one of the best food you can find at a food court. The food is restaurant quality and worth the wait. Something that I wasn't expecting in a desolated mall.... maybe the mall can make Pho Wes the anchor tenant."}
{"text":"Great, great price for a bowl of pho, especially the quality of meat being used in the soup! The beef is super tender! They also use slightly ticket noodles than the average pho restaurant. 

Don't miss trying out on the egg noodle soup either! I had one with tripe and liver (which can sometimes be difficult to find at restaurants).  The food tastes really fresh! 

The bowls don't look very large but there are a ton of noodles and may packed in there."}
{"text":"Pho was very good- the broth has a lot of flavor and it's the perfect amount of food. We also got the beef chow fun - my favorite so far! I have been searching for good Vietnamese food since I moved from California. This place is great and exceeded my expectations!"}
{"text":"I wasn't expecting such a cool Pho place in Fiesta Mall, which is otherwise kind of a wasteland. I had the Duck Soup and it was really good. Nice owner as well!!"}
