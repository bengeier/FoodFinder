{"text":"We absolutely LOVE this place! We've been coming for wing night every single week for just about a year. Needless to say, their wings are great (try the California!). Their fries and sticky toffee pudding are exceptional as well. Delicious breakfast on the weekend! Everything we've ordered has been really good. Awesome staff! And kids are welcome, so they get to enjoy a night out too. They've recently renovated so that there's a restaurant side, and bar side. So if you don't want to hang out around kids, problem solved. Pool tables are on the bar side."}
{"text":"Reading previous posts, obviously people who like this place have never been to any decent pub whatsoever.... With that being said this place is never busy, especially during the day, and for decor wise it looks like a hospital with the wall paper ... Food is mediocre but always frozen ya I can tell.... With that being said its no wonder why there is never anyone in there personally is rather have shitty service at Madison's or Boston pizza or actually the black bull pub but atleast the food is fresh and 9c wings at the black bull"}
{"text":"Always come for the Calamari, and have never been disappointed. The bison burgers are great! Fish is a bit greasy, but overall a great experience time and time again."}
{"text":"Best music you will hear in a pub considering you are in the suburbs.  Could do without the UFC. (Men beating each other up or getting aroused?)  Good fish and chips and good pizza."}
{"text":"Pretty standard for a British/Irish pub, with a younger more raucous crowd. This pub has Kronenbourg Blanc on tap, which deserves a resounding thumbs-up. The server was very friendly, and after mentioning YYC Pizza Week, the manager came out and chatted about their creation. The pizza was great and packed a nice punch, but the apple cobbler wasn't to our tastes. Another solid neighbourhood pub in the suburbs, with a good vibe and good intentions."}
{"text":"This pub shouldn't even get 1 star. We used to be be regulars so when we went tonight, we assumed it would be the same. Our drinks took longer to come but we thought nothing of it. We noticed that our server left and said nothing. 45 minutes later, no food. We finally had enough and went up to the bar to pay for our drinks and the manager told us that Cam is no longer the owner and that she would check on the food. She came back to say the food is ready. When we got the food, it was cold. There were two patrons at the bar who were also regulars. They also stated the service was terrible and they thought the manager was intoxicated. We thought that earlier. When we went to pay, she also told us that the Debit and Credit were down but there was an ATM. We weren't about to pay an extra $5 for a crappy night so we went to our car and scrounged up enough to pay. We will NEVER be back!"}
{"text":"Such good food! The atmosphere is great and they have great event nights. I've been here a few times and tried a few things on the menu. Their specialty drinks are divine for those that want to try something new. Also, their shepherd's pie is a great traditional Irish staple that doesn't disappoint. I also highly recommend the deep fried pickles!"}
{"text":"Great service, alcoholic drinks reasonably priced, food wonderful!!!!  Can't wait to go there again!!!!!  Huge difference from the previous owners!!!!!"}
{"text":"Time for beers on a Friday night!  Decided to come to my neighbourhood pub.  Best decision ever!!  The beer was cold and they have awesome fish and chips.  Two decent size pieces of fish and fresh cut potato fries, it was excellent!!  Definitely worth your money and time.   We will be back!  Cheers!"}
{"text":"Well where so I begin with fiddlers green pub?  Well I'll end the suspense by saying this place was horrible. There is really no other way to describe it.   I judge a pub based on how well they can make a burger because that has to be the easiest thing to make that doesn't take a lot of time. On the menu it stated the burger was 2 fresh patties. That made my day because I cannot stand frozen burger patties. That's just laziness and they taste awful. So I ordered the burger because of the fresh patties. When the burger came out, to my surprise it was two frozen parties that were dripping grease every time I took a bite. To make things worse the burger must have been microwaved to melt the cheese because I have never experienced food so scalding hot before. The burger was terrible to say the least. However they offered to replace it with something else.  I ordered a beef dip as my replacement. Pretty easy...shave some roast beef, put it on a bun and serve with dip.  What I received were large pieces of tough, fatty, hard to chew beef. I had to cut off or spit out much of it because it was impossible to chew.   the positive experience here was the fries.  they were the only thing fresh in this who ordeal, and they were greats.  take that as a hint Fiddlers green, fresh is better.  The ambiance may have been alright if not for the ugly, dirty white door leading into the kitchen. It looks like it was pulled from a condemned house just before they tore the place down.   There was more that was unpleasant about this experience but I think you get the picture. I will never return to this place again."}
{"text":"They reopened and they cleaned up the place. New floor and a separation between restaurant and bar. Service still really good. A few new faces. New hard wood floors, nice and flat! He he! The old one had a few flaws. New paint on the walls, makes it brighter. They took away all the old Irish signs and paintings. Still a pub. Not as Irish as it was. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Thursday is cheap wine and oyster night!   I've been waiting to swing by for a while now  so that I could benefit from the $1 oysters and $5 glasses of house wine (or 1/2 price bottles).   These West Coast Oysters were fresh and lovely on their own, or with a little lemon. I went for two rounds of six...barely managed to remember to take a photo of the second plate. I was so hungry!!!  The three sauces provided were cocktail sauce, and two variations of a garlic Hennessey mignonette, one slightly pinkish and the other more on the yellow side.   The \"yellow\" mignonette was very sweet, so I felt that you lost the sense of the garlic and onions. The \"pink\" one was more balanced and quite pleasant. I was a little concerned that the description of the mignonettes included \"salad dressing\". (Oh. Dearie. Me.) But I know when to shut up and eat...I asked what they were and she was simply the very wonderful messenger. The cocktail sauce was, well, cocktail sauce. Delicious, but cocktails sauce nonetheless. My recommendation is to taste the sauces and decide whether you really need them. These oysters certainly don't.   I must commend my server, Cat, and manager, Brad, for once again being so friendly and welcoming. Although the oysters by themselves, sans accoutrements, were a solid 4, the service is always a 5!!!"}
{"text":"Went through some hiccups being a new establishment but seems to have ironed those out. Especially now that the owners are there and are bringing back their english themed breakfasts. Friday night$ 10 triples combined with karaoke= good times. Nice to have a local tavern with a big international beer n scotch selection."}
{"text":"Best pub food in town, you can tell when someone has love for what they do and it shows in the food. I actually travel out of my way to come here and eat/drink."}
{"text":"If I lived in the area, I think Fiddler's Green could be my watering hole. It's a cater-to-all-crowds Calgary style English Pub, loaded with televisions, hockey and UFC. Lots of traditional English Pub styling with dark wood table, chairs and stained glass chandeliers and accents.  They've got your major beer boys on tap - Budweiser and Kokanee on tap, as well as Big Rock Trad and Grasshopper if you'd prefer something a little more local. They've got a few big gun imports like Guiness, Innis & Gunn and Kronenburg on tap if you fancy something from overseas.  For all you musicians out there, they've got an open jam on Sundays and it seemed to keep the place decently busy the an unusually bitter cold november evening. I always love the community open jams bring out to the pub. It's a great way to get everyone involved and having fun together, but is usually a little easier on the ears than karaoke.  That said, if you want Karaoke, go on a Friday night!   There was even some rad little dude, like 6 years old, maybe, singin \"All About the Bass\". On that... What's with kids in bars lately? Is that a thing that's ok now? There was a few of them running around at Fiddler's Green. I guess I'm totally cool with it as long as I'm not expected to watch my surly language when a game is on!   The Sunday crowd might have taken them by surprise because they seemed pretty understaffed. As a result, the service was super slow and lacked any kind of personal touch. Looking at other reviews, this doesn't seem to always be the case, but it might be something to expect on a Sunday evening.  The food is tasty everyday pub grub, but is it ever huge! I only managed to get about half way through my lasagne that was absolutely smothered in cheese an banana peppers before I had to tap out. The bang for you buck is pretty incredible. For around $13 I wound up with two full meals. I swear their must have been $20 in cheese alone on this monster."}
{"text":"Love this place it's my go to neighbourhood pub! I'm in love with the California style wings   Can't say enough good things about this place"}
{"text":"Not to long ago we noticed this place was under new management.   Since we had liked the place once upon a time, we decided to stop in again on a Saturday afternoon, with the kids, to see what was new and grab a bite for dinner.  Great service...a good start. The kids shared some chili chicken tenders without the chili (they were good little bites) and some crispy fries. Hubs & I had some wings (very tasty), he had the steak sandwich and I the chicken club. Holy big platters batman. So much food came out and my chicken club had two breasts in it. All delicious and well worth the visit.  These guys also participated in YYC Pizza Week and I stopped in one night to try their pizza week pizza. Same waitress as before (so same great service) and the pizza was fresh & delicious.  Nice to see the place picking up both in service and food. Definitely a place we will visit again."}
{"text":"This is my husbands home bar for their pool team.   I've gone now a few times to watch them play and enjoy the atmosphere, drinks and food. They play Monday nights so luckily it's wing night!!!  They have decent wings but I do have to say I prefer the messy ones as the seasoning seems to stick better to them.  I find the dry wings tend to not hold the seasoning and I'm finding more in the bottom of the basket, but hey...cheap wings!!!   Their fish and chips are fantastic!!  Nice big crispy fish and the fries are nice home cut and tasty.  Try their poutine, so good, the gravy is very flavorful.  Overall they have a really good looking menu. Very nice atmosphere, I love the dark wood accents all over and the service staff are always pleasant and attentive.  The team quite enjoys their evening pool nights at this quaint little neighbourhood pub."}
{"text":"Came in for some lunch, and sat on the patio. The decor inside is adorably vintage and inviting. The server was AWESOME. My partner got the fish and chips, and it was delicious, and I ordered the soup of the day and a fiddler's salad. The menu said the salad came with nuts and fruit, but when it arrived it was just mixed greens with vegetables. I mentioned it to the server, and instead of saying they didn't have any, or maybe the side salad version didn't come with it, she brought me  a plate with watermelon and pistachio nuts, because they were the only fruit and nuts they had. It was so sweet and surprising. We had an awesome experience! The only complaint we had is that there weren't any umbrellas on the patio."}
{"text":"Fiddler's Green is formerly known as Paddy O'Leary's.  It's labelled as a British pub rather than an Irish pub and has been open since March 2012.  The new owner extensively renovated so now it's bright inside and I really like some of the new booth and chair seating.  It's a little crowded in some places and finishing touches need to be done, as it's obvious it was reno'd and not completely polished.    I think the beer prices are very reasonable and if you can find them, there are coupons for food discounts circulating.  I received one in the mail for 25% off regular menu prices, which my spouse and I used last night.  I ordered the Shepard's Pie, which was sizable and well done.  The potatoes didn't have a single lump, the beef was juicy and flavorful and it was delivered steaming hot.  I also enjoyed the fries.  My spouse had the Fiddler's Fry (fish and chips), which he said were quite good.  He was peeved about being charged $1 for a tiny side of mayo so in his opinion, he'd give the pub 3 stars.  Our meals were very filling and we both were stuffed.  Our server was friendly and did a good job.  We ended up chatting with a couple in a booth beside us who said they said they'd been here once before and thought the food was fantastic.  I won't hesitate to go back and would now prefer to go here rather than a few other pubs in my neighborhood."}
{"text":"I've not been back for a bit. But the new owners have cleaned up and renovated in the traditional pub style. Family friendly restaurant on the one side and the neighbourhood pub on the other. Saturday night special shepherd's pie. Fun place for your Saturday night with Karaoke on Friday and Saturday"}
{"text":"Awesome neighbourhood pub! Friendly and attentive staff. Food was amazing and came out in great time. I wasn't sure what to get and our server offered up some suggestions which was perfect. I got what they suggested and it was tasty! Great prices as well! The wings are the best wings I have had in the city. I got their pumpkin burlee for dessert and omg it was the best burlee I have had in a long time. Will definitely go back there again!"}
{"text":"This is one of the pubs within walking distance of my house and I've been up a few times to grab a pint of cider and sit on the patio. It's sad that it's not usually that busy, because it's a nice little neighbourhood pub with a reasonable drinks menu. I can't eat much there since they don't offer gluten free fare, but it does look like great food. I saw that they have Karaoke now on Friday night's so I hope that will bring in some more people to liven the place up."}
