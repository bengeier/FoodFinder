{"text":"Service was really great fast quick friendly but the food was a terrible.....   Blanco roll was the worst..  it's like someone squished egg, tuna from a can and panko crumbs and made it a roll.... As if that's not bad enough they make it resemble some back ally hotdog by adding pickled jalapeño to it.... Gross if you like fish cakes and hotdogs this roll is for you. If not I highly recommend staying away.   If they made it simple with avocado raw fish and other non over powering tastes then sliced raw jalapeño over it then torched the butter fish it would probably be the best sushi roll here.   Volcano roll was okay but really over done with the sauce quantity which took away from enjoying fish ... Which is why I go out for sushi.   The sashimi plater (30 pieces) was pretty bad aside from the octopus and 3 of the 9 cuts of salmon.... Everything else was off temperature.   Complimentary salad was small cute and good.   The miso soup was good.   Tea was average.   Ginger is really good here.  Wasabi is really weak here.    I hope the chef seriously considers the suggestion I made about the less sauce and torched raw jalapeño.... Ja Bistro has mastered it and it's incredible.... Maybe the chef should check it out and see what I mean.   Would not recommend this place. Will not be coming back."}
{"text":"Amazing food, very friendly staff, baby/kid friendly (they even have a real change table and low sink in the women washroom, and kids books, colouring books etc).  They also offer very tasty (free) appetizer that most Japanese restaurants used to offer.  Highly recommend!!!  Also, a very unique and personalized touch: they offer (regular) customers to bring in and store their own chopsticks right by the entrance."}
{"text":"Im quite a regular here especially for dinner. A little Japanese restaurant tucked at laird drive. The staff here are so friendly and the food is excellent. I've gotta say quite authentic too. The portion are reasonable  (especially if you order donburi bowls or set meals). Sushi and sashimi are always fresh. You also get cold (or warm) noodles with the delicious broth to start off. For salad that comes with donburi and teshoku meals, you have an option of either sesame or the ginger dressing. Both quite good. I always order the kaizen don. I totally recommend this restaurant.  Update: almost here every week. One of our favourite Japanese restaurant. I've tried almost all of their dishes and everything was right down amazing. From their side dishes to their sushi rolls. Highly recommend volcano and hurricane rolls if you want something different and creative."}
{"text":"Rolls are excellent! And nice service too. Located right next by the road so we parked  at the plaza near by."}
{"text":"My boyfriend ordered the Kintako Special and I ordered the Maki Deluxe, not only was it delicious, the portions were huge and there were well-made complimentary side dishes and noodles! The waitress was super nice and considerate, and the food came fast. Would go again!"}
{"text":"Unique and authentic Japanese food. Very friendly family owners that emphasize home made ingredients and no MSG. Lots of rolls wish fish in them. Volcano roll comes out on fire. Energy roll was really good too. Sushi quality was also notable. Normally I don't enjoy surf clam however now I think that's because all the other places I have been it hasn't been fresh. The surf clam here was tender and flavourful not rubbery. Kids bento box was perfect for our 3 year old. They brought out an amuse bouche appetizer as well. Nice patio in the back."}
{"text":"Best Japanese restaurant by far in the GTA.  The sushi is so fresh and great quality.   The noodle soup appetizer given to customers is a nice touch and it tastes good.  I also really enjoyed the little side dishes that come with hot meals - haven't seen this served at many other jap restaurants.  Overall, you won't be disappointed with the food or service!  I'll definitely be back"}
{"text":"Excellent.  Odd location for such an excellent restaurant.  But now there are two great fish houses in walking distance, Olde Yorke Fish & Chips, and Kintako!  I was surprised how well presented every dish looked, a lot of effort goes into all the food.  It is very difficult to find a sushi joint in Toronto that puts this much effort into every dish you order.  The taste is very well balanced, nothing was too salty or too sweet, we ordered the agadashi tofu, soft tofu...which was excellent, our dinner came with little soup noodle appetizers, salad, miso soup, and edamame.  The sushi itself is on par with most other good sushi restaurants.  Nothing was too fishy, all of our sashimi was well portioned and tasting fresh.  They use just the right amount of rice for their rolls and sushi, and overall, it was a huge surprise that a place so hidden in this part of town could be so good."}
{"text":"Hidden gem in my neighbourhood, authentic Japanese food where the rolls and sashimi are always fresh.  Service is A+ and there's a cute little patio in the back for hot summer nights.  Must go place, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"A gem of a restaurant in Leaside. Their volcano roll is a must-try: essentially comes out of the kitchen on fire (don't forget to blow out the flame before you dig in). My go-to is Chicken Karaage Don. Very cozy environment/decor, and excellent/cheerful service. Tip: you can ask for a mixed salad sauce (ginger + sesame)."}
{"text":"Complimentary: Salad appetizer - very good Noodle appetizer - excellent  Volcano roll - amazing Spicy medallions - ok, a bit filling Sashimi - very good quality  Black sesame ice cream - good"}
{"text":"If you crave Japanese food, stay far away.  I am being honest here.  It was a big disappointment from the customer service to the most important: Food.  Decided to try Kintako Japanese restaurant because the review says it was a good place to try out.  LIARS! I ordered the dinner chicken teriyaki bento box and barely touched the chicken teriyaki.  The chicken was dried and tasted old, not fresh at all.  The miso soup that came with the bento box had dish detergent residue smell.  We ordered an extra miso soup and the waitress forgot about it.  It's not like the restaurant was busy.  There was nobody except myself and my friend. 2 People and they forgot our miso soup order.  This is what happens when the staffs are busy playing on their smart phones than tend to their customers.  When we told the waitress the food did not taste fresh and good at all.  She mumbled something that sounded like sorry and took the food away.  What a big disappointment.  First and last time."}
{"text":"Went there today looking for a quick bite. The 5 star Yelp reviews are spot on. Got a delicious little noodle soup for free. The agedashi tofu was some of the best I've had - at a lot of places, you get huge pieces that are not crispy and that get soggy the minute you get them. Here, you got about 8-9 small pieces, each of which you could eat in one mouthful, in a delicious sauce. Oh, the sauce. Yakinasu was also superb, and the eggplant had a wonderful smoky flavour. My only issue was there wasn't enough of it! I could have had seconds for sure. Baked salmon roll was huge and delicious. Service was attentive and great. I will definitely be coming back here.  My new favourite Japanese spot!"}
{"text":"We went for dinner tonight with our 1 month old and we thoroughly enjoyed every dish we had tonight.  We started with a delicious appetizer, had the complimentary bowl of soup with the thin noodles, ordered the sushi and sashimi platter along with 2 rolls (the volcano and spicy caterpillar), and finally finished with 2 (black sesame paste ice cream and tempera bananas) desserts...everything was outstanding.   To top it all off, the service was impeccable.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Excellent place! Food was fresh and delicious. Price is fair. The staff is very friendly so the service was also great. I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Came here many months ago.  Loved the sushi boat. The warm saki is also worth trying. Very friendly staff and they allowed us to enjoy/finish the meal even after they closed."}
{"text":"Delicious! We ordered a platter with an assortment of maki. The fish was very fresh. Incredibly friendly staff as well.  They even take care with making their tea! Yhe prices are reasonable as well. We will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"This is my go to sushi place in the hood. Its great service and good makes it a nice place. Food is delicious and their service is awesome!"}
{"text":"I read the other reviews, but I thought they were too good to be true. Surely, they must be somehow fake, right? I can't personally speak to the other reviews, but I went there the other day and I can assure, you this place definitely deserves five stars. Not super-cheap, but you certainly get what you pay for.  The place was clean, the service was nice and attentive, and the food was excellent! Highlights included Spicy Medallions, their version of Sushi Pizza, which came in 4 separate pieces, topped with house-dried tomatoes and lotus root.  And the rolls! Especially the volcano roll. I don't want to spoil what happens when it comes to your table, but this is definitely the kind of roll that you want to order and eat-in rather than having for take-out or delivery. The kale chips on top made us think the blowtorched butterfish on top was burnt - a very playful gastronomic illusion, and an example of the kinds of things to expect here.  The eggplant appetizer, Yakinasu, was unusual but delicious. It was served cold, in a large bowl of sauce, topped with something crunchy. Very refreshing.  The only slight letdown were the hand rolls. They will happily make any roll into a hand roll, but is it not listed on the menu at a lower price than regular maki, like at other restaurants. Thus, the price is the same as the regular rolls, and to make up for it, they make them gigantic. This may be good for some, but I personally prefer slightly smaller hand rolls that stay crispy and won't spoil your appetite for the rest of the meal. Strange thing to complain about, I know, but if you're a hand roll lover like me, the portion size can be overwhelming.  All in all, it was an incredible meal. I'm very happy to have this place in my area, especially after losing nearby Mikado. This is the higher-end sushi that this neighborhood needed. I can't wait to try their delivery!"}
{"text":"The food here was great as usual but the noise level was not. Izakayas in Japan are not this noisy and it felt a bit fake after awhile. People come here for the experience to be taken away to Japan and to eat authentic food. The loud banging and shouting when staff gathered to wish someone a Happy Birthday was deafening. We were a party of 16 and 80% of my guests said they would not return no matter how good the food was. A 5 star restaurant is not just about food, but also about the atmosphere and having a pleasant and enjoyable time while eating the great food.  Will head to Imanishi next time for a more authentic experience!"}
{"text":"Service is amazing, and food is great. Definitely a hidden gem.   Love the complimentary noodle soup, volcano roll and baked salmon roll. Excited to try the other things on the menu."}
{"text":"Exceptional sushi. Food is extremely fresh and many interesting specialties.  Prices are reasonable for the quality. Chef and owner Eric has worked at many notable high establishments. His wife Gin is a pleasure and we are thankful she suggested the Volcano roll. Wonderful dish. We are thankful to have found a decent sushi restaurant in Leaside"}
{"text":"Have ordered delivery on a number of occasions and the food is always good, however the presentation has been a bit off maybe once or twice (we think because the sushi got jostled around in the bag maybe) so it's not a big deal.   Tempura is great, and their miso is awesome, and service is also very good!"}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place! It's small but quaint and the staff are so friendly! Excellent customer service! The sushi and sashimi are amazing! The rolls are a nice size - not too small but not too big either- and it is very fresh! Definitely going back soon."}
{"text":"As I write this review, Kintako still sits at a score of 4.5/5 and is quite deserving of it. I'm skeptical when trying new sushi places because of the ubiquitous choices that line almost every street in Toronto. However, Kintako was a pleasant experience and has opened my eyes to the endless creativity of sushi chefs and owners alike.  The food (4.5/5): We started with the chicken karaage which was soft and juicy and served in bite size portions. The sauce isn't mayo, but a mix of soy sauce and balsamic vinegar with oyster sauce(?) It was fairly strong but complemented the karaage very well. Next up were the spicy medallions. It's more like sushi pizza topped with spicy salmon and avocado/cucumber. It's got a hint of spice in it, however not too different than a regular sushi pizza. Now the volacano roll was great. Comes half wrapped in tin foil and lit on fire (very fitting for its name). You don't need soy sauce here as this roll is well slathered in flavour. Topped with juicy butter fish and stuffed with avocado, scallops and other various delights, it's something I would definitely order again. AND OMG THE BAKED SALMON ROLL. My favourite dish of the night! Looks like the volcano roll when it first came out and piping hot when you try to eat it right away. I've never eaten hot sushi before but after blowing some heat away, it's the melt-in-your-mouth salmon that make you blush because it's sooo good. It was also our second roll that is covered in sauce so no soy sauce required! Lastly, the black sesame ice cream was pretty good! I'd say it belonged in the middle tier of black sesame ice creams I've tried because it was flavourful, however alittle on the icy side, so not as creamy nor smooth as other places. But the presentation was delightful and the oats and chocolate sauce were great addition :)  Price (4/5): ~$8-10 per dish, ~$4 for dessert. Not necessarily a bargain, but not over priced either. The volcano roll and baked salmon roll were definitely unique, so very worth!  Service (5/5): There were 2 waitresses who had served us at our dinner that night and each one was welcoming, kind, and very attentive. Each dish came in a timely fashion and plates were taken away equally so. We were consistently asked how each dish tasted and never had an unpleasant moment. This is the type of service that should be rendered at any establishment, good job Kintako!  Ambiance (4/5): Coming into the restaurant is alittle shocking as they have the word SUSHI written in all caps and plastered all over their front, however its a well decorated and inviting small space. It's mostly lined with spacious booths for 4 but there a couple tables in the middle to accommodate larger groups.   SO... long story short - would I come back? Definitely."}
{"text":"I came here the other day with my family and loved it. The sashimi I ordered was superb and the sides that came with it (mushrooms, pickled vegetables, tofu etc) were all of similar caliber...the miso soup was the best I've had! Loved the cozy atmosphere...will be bringing my husband back here for date night!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I happened to be driving by the area and decided to stop by kintako for dinner. We checked out the other reviews and even though there weren't that many reviews, the overwhelming high praise for the restaurant eventually sold us on trying out the restaurant. Lo and behold, it turned out to be quite frankly one of the best dinners we ever had.  First off, the owners - Jin and Eric (the chef) took such good care of us. Jin was so friendly and pleasant to talk to. She mentioned that they made everything from scratch and that they don't put MSG in their food. That immediately was a plus in both our books.  On to the food. They brought us an amuse bouche that was delicious and a perfect start to the dinner. My girlfriend ordered the kintako special teishoku w/ beef teriyaki and I ordered the udon w/ sushi. When they came out the presentations were so beautiful and the food tasted so fresh and delicious. The beef teriyaki was cooked to absolute perfection and I now know what good teriyaki tastes like. For the sashimi, they actually gave us uni as well. The udon soup definitely tasted less salty than others and yet still full of flavor. The ginger salad was crisp and fresh, made even more so by the fact that they chilled the bowls that it was served in. And Eric the chef/owner nicely cut Apple wedges to look like two small bunny rabbits.  It's this attention to detail, great tasting food and amazing service that make me easily recommend this restaurant to everyone."}
{"text":"Great service and incredible food! A hidden  gem that will not disappoint. Very reasonable prices too. Don't let the decor fool you this place is one of the best."}
{"text":"This restaurant is just off of the bus route (5 min) that takes me to my judo practice at the Japanese Cultural Centre. So on days when I'm feeling more \"Wapanese\" than usual I like to stop by in order to bolster the illusion that I am a denizen of feudal Japan.  What you can expect from Kintako:  Great service, the kind in which your tip doesn't feel like a private sector employment subsidy, but recognition of over and above effort the staff exerted on your behalf.  Great food, soft, melt in your mouth fish, not the inedible garbage you will encounter on yonge street.  Great presentation, in regards to the food and the interior of the restaurant.  Great value, not cheap and not expensive, just right.  I like it, and suspect that you will too."}
{"text":"This might be my favourite sushi spot in Toronto. Chicken Katsu is one of the best I've eaten. Friendly and welcoming staff and the owner came by to ask how meal was going. We got to learn that it is a husband and wife team and her husband is the chef. Hidden little gem definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"Such a pleasant surprise. We felt like sushi and popped in after shopping. WOW - MIND BLOWING!!! The food was sooo good - started with the house noodle soup (crazy flavorful) then agedashi (very generous and delicious) and then the gyoza (fried to perfection). Then came the sushi (volcano roll - awesome presentation) tempura california roll and cucumber rolls - perfection. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"We went there for a dinner and we really enjoyed it. The place is great and not too loud. Tasty sushis. Friendly servers. Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"I visited with my friends. We ordered the Leaside Platter. It consisted of an assortment of sushi, sashimi, and rolls. All of them tasted great. If I had to be picky, the seafood portion (neta) of the sushi came off when I tried to dip it in the soy sauce. It made me wonder if the chef did not form them in a traditional way. Otherwise no complaints with the freshness or the doneness of the rice. Rolls were alright, and the sashimi slices were delightful. We also got plenty of appetizers. The server was friendly and responsive. The interior and the atmosphere of the restaurant was excellent. The outside appearance of the restaurant could use improvement: we would not have visited this restaurant if it were not for the Yelp rating. The washroom was functional at best. I had a pleasant experience overall. Great value at a great price. I do not live nearby but would love to come back when I am in the area."}
{"text":"I'm always satisfied here!!! Food is great quality and delicious. Maki rolls are superb. Waitresses are very friendly. And the free noodle soup and salad they give is delicious. Loveeeee it here!!! And super reasonable prices!!!!"}
{"text":"I stopped in here for lunch on a whim and I am so glad that I did. I ordered the Kintako Special and in no time I had a little bowl of noodle soup and a salad in front of me. I really appreciate the use of something other than iceberg lettuce. Both were simple yet incredibly flavourful. Then the rest of the meal arrived: miso soup, steak teriyaki, spicy salmon rolls, rice, two shrimp tempura and two sweet potato tempura, a little seaweed salad, what I think was a deep fried California roll, and a piece of pineapple to finish it off. Everything was perfectly cooked and very tasty. I would definitely stop here again."}
{"text":"Location: it's a small place accessible by car (and maybe TTC). There's only two spots for parking outside the restaurant but you can park on the side of the road.  Price: $10-$30 depending on food choice. (I think I saw some $50 sushi plate, but my debt-burdened brain must've filtered it out). *Be careful, actual prices are around $2 more than the menu price!  Food: The food was quite delicious! I got the most simple Las Vegas roll and it was jampacked with lots of stuff! The sushi itself was quite big too (~5cm in diameter). Everyone's food was very nicely plated.  Service: They were really accommodating with our group of 11. The waitress lady was so personable and kind. She kept offering us things on the house like salads and ice cream!! The service was a bit slow, but maybe they faced some issues in the back. We didn't mind though since they compensated us with so much free food!  Overall: Cute restaurant with great service and nice food!"}
{"text":"I can't have any grains and dairy so when my friend decided to have her birthday dinner here, I called the restaurant ahead and asked if there were rolls that could be made without rice. They fortunately offer a cucumber roll but they told me I could order any other roll and they would make it with cucumbers instead. They were super accommodating to my requests. Then they went beyond my expectations when my friends were devouring birthday cake and our waitress came out with fruit for me to enjoy. Staff were friendly and attentive. Food was great too!"}
{"text":"We read the good reviews on Yelp and decided to give it a try. Surprisingly, their sushi and sashimi are amazing! We had the combo of sushi and sashimi. A must try the appetizer soup, it was superb! Will go here again when we visit Toronto. The owner also friendly and cater to your need."}
{"text":"Very good sushi place. Came here on a midweek, it was not that busy. Good presentation of food. Most places do not have miso soup with noodles,so this place stands above most sushi restaurants. Even the app salad was unreal.   The only issue was service, the server was caught up with talking with some korean tourist. It took a long time to get served, and waited a while for food.  I would give it 5 stars if it wasn't for the poor service received on this particular day. Otherwise, the food is 5 stars."}
{"text":"Wonderful service with very good Japanese and Korean food. I have been twice and will return"}
{"text":"Very nice experience here. Came for a late lunch and staff was very nice and generous. Would definitely come back here again and again. Their teriyaki is delicious and their vegetable rolls are all very good -- especially the yam roll!"}
{"text":"Fantastic little find!  I'm fairly new to the area. Driven past here many times. About two years old. With so many sushi places in the city I would probably never have noticed this place if I didn't see these yelp reviews. Very gracious and friendly host. I ordered the Katsu dinner and my girlfriend the Hot Night roll as well as a California maki. All was absolutely wonderful. The Katsu was the best I've ever eaten. Nice and light batter with proper chicken, not fatty or grizzly. Came with a wonderful array of sides to include, tempura yam, tofu, rice, seaweed salad and soup. also had complimentary soup to start. The price was very reasonable for what we had. Everything was fresh with decent portion sizes. At the end of our meal the host came up to us and asked how everything was. We got chatting for a while and learned that they had taken over the place two years prior. I believe her name was Jean and her husband was the chef and owner. It will be a spot that we will now frequent for sure!"}
{"text":"New team took over the old Han Sushi and are serving one of the best rolls and sashimi in the area. Beware: Huge portions! :)  Will definitely come back an will order delivery."}
{"text":"TL;DR Food sucks if you come on a busy day/holiday and only their sushi is good. All important details are capitalized. Read on if you're interested in this long ass story.  Picked this place based on their 4.5* Rating and was extremely disappointed ALOT. Mostly because this place may be a 4.5* restaurant on a weekday where traffic is slow for them, but this was not the case for Mother's Day.   It seems that this is a FAMILY business. You got the dad and the son on the sushi bar, the grandma in the kitchen, Mom, auntie, and daughters as waitresses. Maybe I'm wrong but it was a pretty tightly nit Korean team working tonight.   Why I didn't rate this at least 3 stars?  They ONLY HAVE 6 ACCURATE UP TO DATE MENUS.  We were presented with takeout menus from who knows how long ago but the price difference was from $0-5 which is quite upsetting because we're a family who likes to choose food from the menu that'll get us our money's worth. Also, it seems like they don't have a seperate lunch menu so we were confused as to why some choices had a total of 3 different price points lmao.   This is vey tricky because then it makes me feel like you're being scammed/overcharged. We even asked if they could bring the menu back to us for guests that were going to be late, they agreed to and never came.  SERVICE WAS EXTREMELY SLOW AND INCONSISTENT.  Something that makes me feel very welcome is having at least our tea cups/water refilled; if you don't care to ask if everythings okay, if we wanted to order more, or just acknowlede our existence in general, please learn how to do so for the love of customer service.   The person taking our order was deaf or didn't understand english and got our orders wrong twice, repeated our orders wrong a couple of times, and delivered the wrong orders to our table. This is not a big deal really but if we're waiting for over 30 minutes to order and TRYING to flag a server down, still not having been offered beverages until ANOTHER 15 MINUTES AFTER we ordered. It's fustrating.  We watched at least three tables who arrive AFTER US leave BEFORE us because they gave them attention, their food arrived because they took their orders first, and we didn't exist.  We also had to ask 500 times if there would be anything on the house for mother's day for dessert and everytime... \"Let me check for you\" MIND YOU WE ASKED AT LEAST 3 DIFFERENT SERVERS. But its okay if you play the waiting game the best fried bananas any of us have EVER HAD came out for us with a side of black sesame icecream topped up with whipped cream. Nice touch!  FOOD INCONSISTENT DELIVERY  I recieved my short ribs an hour after arriving. Tempura udon arrived 30 minutes after that. A TOTAL OF 2 HOURS LATER WE FINALLY GET OUR SUSHI. But hold on. It was only 2 hours and 30 minutes after arriving that we recieve our last few orders and this is when the restaurant has cleared up already. And the food quality was still mediocre.  WIERD TEXTURES The spring rolls we got were soggy. The tempura was soggy. The fish katsu was crunchy as hell but was 100% frozen and was mushy fish. Softieland. Just don't order anything that isn't sushi here ok.  FLAVOUR LACKING My short ribs dressd in yuzu and soy sauce supposedly (does not taste a hint of citrus LET ALONNNE yuzu ok) and was very bland. SO BLAND my brother dumped half of the bland soy sauce onto the ribs... Bland and greasy ribs that were 3 more dollars expensive than the takeout menu... tsktsktsk The side dishes were meh but I mean, melon paired with my seaweed salad? Comon start up this new food trend guys.  SUSHI IS 7/10  In the end; the sushi was pretty decent here, AND BEAUTIFULLY PRESENTED OK, which is the ONLY thing I would ever order here and ever recommend until another 5 to 10 years of doing some good work on their cooked food. Come when it's dead so you can taste more of the love, because I see promise in this restaurant with all the different cups and plates as if there wasn't enough for large groups of people.  GET THE FRIED BANANAS! You'll thank me later if you read through all of this ;)"}
{"text":"Well, I have nothing but positive things to say about both the food AND the service!!!  Kelly was our server and she was spectacular.  We went during the quieter afternoon period and were treating like family!  The various maki were amazing and my sashimi VERY good!  We asked for less rice on the rolls and that wasn't a problem at all!  We were given a few items \"on the house\" as it was our first time at Kintako.  My bff and i  were celebrating our birthday which is two days away and Kelly brought us ice cream with two candles in order to celebrate our special day!  We told her we would be back without doubt!  Thanks Kintako for a very positive first experience!!!  Kelly is the best!!!"}
{"text":"I have ordered take out from this place twice and both times, the service and the food was absolutely delicious. Dined in once this past week and found it to be only okay. Karaage portion was small and sashimi quality was alright. Would do take out from this place again another time as those experiences were better, would probably not dine in again."}
{"text":"The service at Kintako is a rare treat!  The staff was extremely patient and friendly with our larger group for a birthday. The waitress was even very accommodating for a friend who has a restrictive diet. She made many attempts to go out of her way to prepare items not on the menu for my soy and sugar free friend (preparing unique sauces and fresh fruit). And she didn't mind us staying a bit longer and asking for separate bills.  Call ahead for big groups as the restaurant only has one or two big tables (10+ people).   The food is excellent and they offer high quality sushi with decent prices and a lot of food for each meal - with most meals coming with a small noodle bowl, miso soup and salad. They also have an interesting butterfish dish that came out set on fire so it's instagram friendly.  Parking wasn't too bad - there are a few street parking spots (free) in front of the restaurant and if it's after 5pm there are many spots on nearby residential streets."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is wonderful and inviting - you can tell it's a neighbourhood spot.  I ordered a sashimi lunch and was left feeling indifferent. Though the presentation was beautiful, the combined amount of sashimi received was less than a normal appetizer portion in most other places. I'll return but only if I have to - not because it's spectacular."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Delicious free noodle soup appetizer.  This is actually the reason we go there - our kids can't get enough of that!  Every dish we've had here is amazing.  Highly recommend the tempura tofu appetizer.  Sushi is fresh and well presented.  Only knock is food is sometimes slow to come out but it's because they are quite busy with takeout orders etc.  Great for families."}
{"text":"This place is a family run restaurant with a authentic Japanese feel. I've been here twice before, once for dinner and again for lunch. I'll just start with my first experience.  We had a large group of people, which looked like it may be a problem given the size of the restaurants. However, they were very accommodating and pushed a bunch of tables together. I ordered the short beef ribs that comes with a small vegetable dishes. The beef ribs were delicious.Meat was tendered and came off the bone. Sauce that accompanied had a nice sweet tangy taste. I tried their home made sake ice cream, which was interesting in a good way. It was like vanilla ice cream with a hint of sake flavouring.   Second time we came, staff again was very friendly. I tried the chicken teriyaki this time. Chicken was cooked well, but it wasn't as hot as I'd like it to be. I have a feeling they cooked it early but served it a little late so it cooled down more to my liking. Regardless, the presentation was good and the time it took for all the food to be delivered was good. For dessert, we tried a black sesame and tempura ice cream. Both were good, but I would favoured the taste of black sesame more.   One thing to note is that it is a bit far away from public transportation and I had some difficulty finding parking around the area. This is one of the more pleasant locations to visit in Toronto and wouldn't mind coming back here again."}
{"text":"Amazing gem tucked away in East York and it's dangerous how close it is to work for me. I came during the lunch rush on a weekday with a large group, we were the only ones in the restaurant which was nice. Parking is limited so park on the side street just north of the restaurant or in the plaza across.  Considering we were the only ones in the restaurant I can't really say how they fare during their busier times but I found the quality great and service was prompt. I ordered the Kintako lunch special which came with a choice of teriyaki, spicy salmon roll, mixed tempura, fruit, seaweed salad, miso soup and soba to start. This is quite a hearty lunch if you're hungry! The presentation was wonderful as everything had its own dish/bowl and didn't come in your typical bento box. I chose the salmon teriyaki which had a crisp skin and just the right amount of sauce.The tempura was lightly battered and fried just right. I found the rice to fish ratio to be just right for the sushi and the soba to start was a nice starter to the meal. My coworkers ordered the different teriyaki lunches, maki set, and udon set. I found the udon set fairly big as well since there was also the option of maki on the side.   This will definitely become a regular lunch spot for me! Overall it's a great restaurant so come when it's quieter during the week and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"A nice place to try. Service was good and food was good, but a bit expensive for what you get.   FOOD: I came with a big party so we ordered a LOT of their special rolls in addition to regular menu items. The specialty rolls were smaller than I expected as these more expensive ones normally have a lot more meat to them. However they tasted great (especially the volcano roll). You definitely would not be full from eating one. The other dishes were moderately priced, but not the selling point of the place.  Their complimentary salad and soup (which had noodles in it!) were quite good!   SERVICE: everyone was friendly and tended to us quickly. Since we were a group of about 20 all the food didnt come out at once which was a bit disappointing since we had made this reservation a week in advance. We split up into 3 tables and one table fully ordered and finished their meals before the starting dishes were even served to the others.   Come with a small group!"}
{"text":"i've been to a lot of japanese restaurants but this one is one of the best japanese restaurant in toronto. they gave us free soup with noodles and japanese salad while waiting for our food. my sister ordered volcano roll which is their one of the best sushi. their food presentation is very nice. i ordered unagi don, i was surprised with the amount of unagi they put. some restaurants don't put alot of unagi. my husband ordered chicken teriyaki lunch special, it is very presentable but the amount of chicken is not alot maybe because it's their lunch special but taste really good. for dessert, we tried their black sesame ice cream. again, we're surprised that they gave us 3 scoops of ice cream. coz some other resto gives only 1 scoop. overall, we were very satisfied with the amount of food, presentation, and price. for sure we will come back and eat here again."}
{"text":"I came here one night with my boyfriend after looking it up on yelp. We were not disappointed! Their sashimi was great as well as the sushi rolls. Miso soup was amazing too and not too salty. We really enjoyed the food and service. The owner suggested we try their volcano roll and it was amazing. I was really happy I listened to her. Their black sesame ice cream at the end was my favourite to clean the palate. I definitely recommend to anyone looking for a great sushi place."}
{"text":"Had an amazing meal for two at this gem! Some of the best sushi I have ever had, hands down, and fantastic value! Service was fast and friendly, and our waitress made some great suggestions when we were ordering. Do not miss out on the house specialty volcano roll! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I quite enjoyed my meal with my family (wife and 2 young kids). Both kids have peanut allergies and the waitress was quite accommodating in answering our questions and looking out for them.  The kids meal was plentiful and my kids love to eat.   The soup was delicious as previous reviewers have mentioned. My kids stole mine. The salad was fresh and tasty.  The volcano roll was great just remember blow out the fire before trying to get a piece. My daughter loves the udon.  Overall will be coming back even though it's not in our neighborhood.  Street parking starts at 5pm Monday to Friday."}
{"text":"I am currently at the restaurant now and leaving my first review on yelp. The noodle soup they gave out was very good. But One of the dozen oysters we ordered is not fresh. We told the waitress but was only given a 15% coupon for next time visit. The sashimi is not very fresh either. Not coming back again."}
{"text":"I live down the road and frequent this quaint little sushi joint. They always remember us with a smile and treat my girlfriend and I to a wonderful dinner.  I can't get enough of the tempura and they have so many tasty rolls to try. Fresh fresh fresh! The volcano roll is a spectacular visual presentation coupled with combination of flavours and textures that make it a must try! A must! Mmmmm butterfish :)"}
{"text":"How did this place get such a high rating. The waitress dropped all our appetizer and isn't paying attention while she's taking our order. We ordered two specialty rolls, sashimi platter duo and a beef tataki. The tataki isn't even red to begin with, and the sashimi platter is supposed to be a variety of different sashimis (raw fish) . They incorporated unagi in it which is cooked eel. Sashimi definitely was not fresh. My 2 friends and I all got a stomach ache right after finishing our meal. Will not be returning here. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Food wise this place is hands down a 5star sushi spot. The fish was super fresh and the they take the presentation of their food very seriously. The staff was very attentive and I was secretly paying attention to see if I could catch the chef letting anyone leave without shouting \"thank you goodbye\" but it never happened.   I ordered the beef tataki, spicy salmon roll,  and the sushi sashimi dinner (it came with Toro!). I only managed to get a picture of the tataki because I was too hungry and forgot the other two.   This is a very small and cozy place that has a very homey feel to it. The food is amazing and service is great.  But I wouldn't recommend coming here for a birthday dinner or large group gathering."}
{"text":"small hole in the wall place with good sushi selection and a down to earth atmosphere.  Nothing too fancy here but everything was prepared well and the price was reasonable.  The udon broth noodle amuse bouche was a nice treat before the main meal.  I order a mixture of some sashimi and a bulgogi dinner box.    The sashimi portion was on the smaller side but it's not a big issue.  The bulgogi was cooked well but again nothing too special.  The staff was very friendly and I even heard a guy who was trying to pick up a take out order but forgot his wallet and they allowed him to pay the next day.  Must be a regular, but still very nice.  Accepts american express which was great since I was traveling from the States.  If you are looking for an inexpensive sushi place with good quality then you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Had all the expectations that this was going to be a great meal based on the excellent reviews.  We ended up ordering the takeout menu rather than sitting down to eat, and this made all the difference. The does that mean you are smaller than expected and the fish tasted a little off. We also ordered edamame, which too was disappointingly cold.   Well I can't vouch for the sit down menu, I do not recommend the takeout menu."}
{"text":"Great service - there was only one server when I was there but you could tell that she was trying to serve every table best she could Great food - presentation of the food was awesome and they tasted so good. Definitely recommend the volcano roll.. The appetizer that they served on the house was hot noodle soup and it's the best I've ever had. Great price - we all expected the meal to be expensive, given the presentation and quantity of the food, but it came out to be 20$ lower than expected."}
{"text":"I came here based on the ratings which looked pretty solid. I had a spicy salmon roll, and two other rolls with crab cucumber and avocado. The spicy salmon roll was soggy, and the other two were not very appetizing either, the presentation wasn't they best either. The salad and miso soup were not so great either. My husband got a Philly roll which was delicious. The servers were friendly, but I won't be returning."}
{"text":"What a place! Simple, refined but so much to offer! At first we were skeptical since the restaurant didn't really attracted our attention when we drove by it. Was also a little confused when it came to parking, but there's a residential area beside it where you can park for free on weekends. Walked in and the staff were really nice. We had shrimp tempura and grilled squid to start (do not get the grilled squid, it was very disappointing especially since it came with what appears to taste like Tostitos salsa sauce on top). However the rolls were a different story. I do encourage everyone to try the signature Volcano Roll! It was to die for! Presentation wise... Dam it was on fire! Literally! Another roll that I would recommend would be the Hot Night Roll. If you love spicy rolls, this is the one. Miso soup was meh, nothing special. Also, don't know if there was a shortage of staff or there was a back log of orders but we had to wait a long time for our food to come out. The wait wasn't so bad since the servers were nice. But in the ned of the day we would've liked our food to come out within a decent amount of time. Prices wise I would say they were reasonable. We had 2 apps, 5 miso soups, 5 rolls and 1 beer and it was just over $100. Overall I had a great experience here and I would definitely come back for the sushi."}
{"text":"Walked in to the restaurant and was immediately welcomed by the staff. It was quiet and they knew about our reservation right away. The table we requested was set and ready 20 minutes before our actual reservation time. The host came to our table and asked us what we wanted to drink while we waited for the rest of our party to arrive. We received hot tea in large cups. The tea was very delicious and satisfying on this cold night. We ordered some food and the portion sizes were very large and the food was just fantastic. The best part of the night was the black seseme ice cream they gave us at the end. It was really good in comparison to other so called restaurants that offer it. The host / server was very sweet and kind during our visit. I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for Japanese / Korean food."}
{"text":"Great quality sushi in a lovely neighbourhood. I've only had the lunch specials here but I would recommend it to all my coworkers. For a little more than $10 you can get sushi, rolls, bentos, or udon bowls which come with tasty appetizers and miso soup. The cold noodle appetizer is so flavourful.  The broth looks simple but tastes so warm and fragrant. The salad that comes with it is a little dressing heavy but I'm glad it's more than just spring mixed greens. I think the bento box portions are on the carb heavy side so be careful if you're watching out for that! If you're lucky and don't need to control the carbs, you're in for a good lunch! The rolls set comes with three different rolls that are bound to make you full. The sushi lunch special is plated beautifully with some torched options as well. The restaurant is very clean and decorated classic oriental with a modern flare. The only downfall is that there's only one waitress during lunch hours, so flagging her down can be annoying. Other than that, her service is very kind and the food speaks for itself! Great location in Leaside!"}
{"text":"Service and food is amazing! Servers are super friendly, easy to talk to, and gave recommendations to our orders. We ordered the Laird platter with the volcano roll. We first got noodles for appetizer, then came salad and a big bowl of Edamame for the table to share. (Most places Edamame is a side order) When our sushi boat came we also got miso soup...It was like a four course meal, we were surprised how the appetizers kept coming. Different servers would come around refilling our tea and water once our cups are about a third full.  We thought the Laird platter came with dessert like some other platter options on the menu, but this one didn't. However the waiter still offered us ice cream for free, options of green tea, vanilla, and black sesame. They also added extra touches to the ice cream scoop, chocolate drizzle and (granola?) flakes - extra brownie points!  Our friends and I all left super happy after the meal, knowing we've found our go-to sushi place in the neighborhood :) Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Just had another amazing experience at this place. The food is the best sushi I've had in Toronto and the service is up there as well.  We were served with complimentary delicious sumyan soon after we ordered and after we expressed how much we liked it, we were given more! Also only one of our orders came with salad but they brought it out for both of us! All of this was in preparation for the main event.  Volcano roll and chicken karaage don. The former is lit on fire and the presentation is that out of a movie. Once you blow out the flame (do it quick) you'll be treated to a fresh tasty special roll. The karaage was a big portion, came with soup and salad all of which were delicious.  Trust me when I say this, it's worth the drive."}
{"text":"Love traditional Japanese food? Love exploring your taste buds?... well this place has it! I love the fact that I don't have to travel the busy streets of down town Toronto to fill my belly with great food.  I am a big fan of mom and pop traditional sushi... but tend to get bored; this place fuses traditional and new generation Japanese favourite dishes. There was not one dish that I disliked! The atmosphere is very friendly and engages with you in order to help you make the right decision on the menu selection.  High quality dishes, comfortable setting and very fair prices; all in all, I definitely recommend you trying this place!"}
{"text":"We stopped by this placed based on the amazing reviews here.  The service was pretty good.  In terms of food, the age dashi tofu appetizer was very tough.  That tofu did not seem very fresh.  Miso soup was good.  Volcano roll was presented very well in a burning platter; however, the taste was kind of bland and uninspiring (recommended by our server).  The size is small compared to the cost.  Overall, not the best value for money.  Perhaps we did not order the right things, as I saw the servers walking by with some very good looking rolls destined for other tables :(  Will potentially come back to try something else on the menu.  It would be vert helpful to have pictures of the rolls listed on the menu.  If you have kids, the place is family friendly."}
{"text":"I came here for good food but most importantly the experience. I find that most sushi joints are cramped and uncomfortable. However this place delivers EVERYTHING that you can ask for in a nice casual restaurant. The quality is definitely underrated and they can charge more if they wanted to. The fish is fresh, fish melts in your mouth, rolls are delicious, the plating is beautiful, and the service is excellent. I would have expected this experience in a 4 to 5 star sushi joint. They even give free house noodles. The only thing I'd like to see are the Japanese style tables. But that's asking for too much. The trip to Leaside is definitely worth it. I'll be back with other friends."}
{"text":"I don't get it. We came to eat here because of the glowing yelp reviews, and it was way below average."}
{"text":"Went here with a group of people for dinner one night, it is a small place so we were worried about not all being able to sit here but all was good! We all ordered different things and shared them like we usually do and the food was pretty average but more on the good than bad side. The pricing was decent and I think overall we each spent about $20ish on food give or take and we all left pretty full. Overall great place to go, decent pricing and pretty good food!"}
{"text":"Delicious food made with care and quality ingredients. Quiet and small room with friendly service (you can tell from the start they're proud of the food they serve). The complimentary noodle soup is pretty good. A creative and refreshing Eldorado roll comes wrapped in thin cucumber slices with Mango sauce. We're definitely going back to try other items on their menu. Reservations recommended, take out is also an option."}
{"text":"It is my first visit here for dinner on a weekday, I give it a 2.5 star (1/2 star is the bonus for the service).  Maybe it was the food we chose, I found the food (at least those we ordered) was not as impressive than I would expect due to the overall high rating.  My uncle wanted a pork katsu but reliazed that the restaurant served only chicken and fish katsu.  We went for the chicken katsu instead.  The chicken meat was fine but the deep-fried bread crumbs were made too thick.  They were crispy but hard.  Same issue with the tempura I ordered.  The batter was not light and crispy enough.  My mom does not like her favorite green dragon roll.  I found the chef used way too many cucumbers.  They made the roll crunchy but it was not the way it should be I believe?  Also, why did they make green dragon roll with imitation crab meat, and was there any shrimp tempura in it at all?  The service, however, was welcoming and attentive.  The complimentary noodle soups were the best of all.  Parking around the area is also an issue.  In general, we still had good time but I am sure I will not drive all the way back there again.  Sorry!"}
{"text":"Oh man. I wish more restaurants could be like Kintako. Kintako reminds me of what going out to eat was like when I was a kid - in my small town, the places we'd go as a family were also family-owned and operated. They were homey and cozy, the food was sooooo good and it felt special to go out, yet it wasn't too expensive or fancy. Kintako has got all of this going for it, and it's just so awesome. I really enjoy it, every time I've been there, it's just the best. As a westside girl, it's a hike for me to get to Kintako, but it's worth it. The sushi is really, really good - fresh fish, inventive rolls, strong wasabi, perfect rice. The service is so nice, so welcoming. You don't have to dress up or spend a lot of money to go there. One of the servers has a little toddler girl who is usually at the restaurant, and she is just the cutest. It's a place that makes you feel like family.   Toronto tends to have two kinds of sushi restaurant - the crap Annex throwaway sushi, and the high end reservations only $$$$ sushi. Kintako is the in-between where you can get a quality meal, with yummy noodle soup, salad with ginger dressing, hot savory miso soup, and SEVERAL substantial, delicious rolls for the $9.95 lunch special. That's incredible.   Lastly, us Japanese hybrids know that you have to feast on Japanese food for New Years - Kintako was open on NEW YEARS DAY. Truly, the perfect start to my year."}
{"text":"Went to Kintako yesterday for dinner. Ordered: 10 fresh oysters with ponzu sauce, Sashimi Omakase Solo, Soft shell crab, torched mackerel, beef tataki, and the sushi and sashimi combo. Complimentary noodle in soup and salad were served. This was enough food for the two of us. Sashimi was great, it came with torched butter fish which was really delicious. The mackerel was also really good. I wasn't a big fan of the soft shell crab, the batter was light (not the same batter as tempura), but not crispy, it was almost soggy and we didn't enjoy it as much as we wanted to.  The sushi fell apart when we picked it up, which was a bit disappointing, however the quality of fish was still really fresh. The beef tataki was cooked closer to medium throughout (first time I've seen this) instead of being rare, but the taste profile was still delicious.   The service here is top notch. Everyone is very polite and helpful. It's a very welcoming atmosphere. I noticed they have a lot of regulars coming here because they know people's names and interests. It seems to be a popular place in the area, I can see why."}
{"text":"bleh, expensive, Krab logs in rolls (shred and dress your KRAB, stop being lazy!!) lunch/dinner special, nothing special about them, just a gimmick. Staff is friendly and they did not argue with me when I sent back food eg, tuna that was dry and *stank*"}
{"text":"I happened to be in there area tonight and was looking for a sushi place for take out. Although I've driven by this place a few times, to be honest the look of the outside never intrigued me to try it out.   Got the food home and immediately kicked myself for never trying it earlier. The food was amazing! I ordered 3 rolls, Black Dragon, Rainbow and the Volcano Roll. All of the food was so fresh and the Volcano roll is definitely my new favorite. I also found their pricing very reasonable and the portions larger than I had expected.   Even though the restaurant is not in my area I will be making the drive whenever I'm craving sushi. It's definitely worth it."}
{"text":"For the price of its food, the portions were considerably small to me (and I have a small appetite). The nigiri were very tiny and the rice fell apart every time I picked it up. My combo comes w a dynamite roll but the rolls were very small (size of California roll). The speed of the arrival of food was also very slow. I finished my dinner and my husbands food had not arrived yet. The rest of the party's food were all decent.  They pay a lot of attention on plating. Food was nicely arranged. I am giving it four star because the rest of our party had a good meal and the restaurant gave us three families complimentary green tea and sesame ice cream. And the servers were very friendly and kept topping up our tea. Parking there can be difficult so be prepared."}
{"text":"First off, the service here is spectacular. The lady was so incredibly nice. We came at the beginning of a weekday lunch rush, around 12pm. We managed to find a parking spot on the street next to the restaurant, but I'm not sure that there is a formal parking lot.  They started us off with a cup of noodle soup and salad. The salad dressing was a bit heavy on the ginger. We then ordered a spicy salmon roll to share, and two teishokus (meal set with rice, miso soup, seaweed salad, and fruit) - one with sashimi and one with chicken cutlets. The quality of the food was great, and it was a good portion for two people. I would definitely come back to Kintako."}
{"text":"Incredible service and very tasty food. We sat in a small table in the corner because the restaurant was full, but the waitress told us we'd get the next table once it became available, which was 5 minutes after we sat down. The waitress was a middle aged woman who was funny and made us feel like she was our mother feeding us. Because of the \"inconvenience\" of having to switch tables 5 minutes after we sat down (which wasn't a problem at all), we were given 2 small dishes to start - a noodle soup and a small salad - that was on the house. The dessert also came with extra ice cream on the house. I'll definitely be back here :)."}
{"text":"Hidden gem in the city. Patio and indoor seating available. Parking may be an issue if it gets busy though. Luckily I found a spot in front of the restaurant.   Service was very attentive, genuine and nice.  Meal comes with soup, salad, and soup noodles! All were fresh and tasty!  You may want to ask the server to recommend some items as there are quite a few things to choose from.  Overall, I would visit again!"}
{"text":"Amazing, amazing service. Every. Single. Time.  If there are 10000 stars I'd give it to them. Their service is unparalleled. I had ordered a Karaage Don which comes with a salad and this small appetizer called 'Sumyan'. But because I was sharing with my bf, they brought out an extra salad. We then complimented how good the Sumyan was and they brought and 2 extra cups of Sumyan! What a wonderful surprise.    The Karaage Don was great, and so was the fiery Volcano roll! Both our tummies and hearts were full when we left restaurant!"}
{"text":"Amazingly fresh raw fish. A very nice surprise for uptown sushi. Lovely owner and wait staff. Clever creative dishes."}
{"text":"The lunch special is great bang for your buck. The staff have always been kind. Great place."}
{"text":"Great quality sushi for the price tag topped only by even greater service. My gf and I must've missed the rush hour because the place wasn't too crowded throughout our meal allowing us to have a nice meal. There isn't a designated parking, but street parking is free for certain times. I wish the place is reservable via Opentable and accepts AMEX, but will definitely return."}
{"text":"Kintako was the first out-of-downtown sushi restaurant I've been to. And I enjoyed it thoroughly.   + Authentic decor. The entire restaurant felt authentic and true to its roots + Food arrived fast and all together + Menu selection is great, along with some sushi that aren't even offered at other Japanese restaurants  + The staff was very accommodating, even for a large crowd of roughly 12 people + Food is presented beautifully on the plate. One of the other tables even had a wooden boat as a serving vessel for their sushi selection + Great customization of bento box, was nicely balanced between the carbs and the protein + Sushi was both beautiful and delicious + Price is adequate for the quality of food that they're offering  - Wasabi was not offered nor was it on the sushi. It needed to be requested - Some of the sushi rolls were not well formed, causing them to tip over and fall - Water was not refilled, as we had to ask for more water - Space is a little bit cramped, but not excessively   Certainly one of the better sushi restaurants I've experienced. If I were to visit this part of town again, I'd certainly come back in for a nice dinner and a nice ambience to back it up."}
{"text":"My boyfriend has been here 3 years ago and since then, the menu and the price have changed. They don't have a Lunch special anymore but the quality in their Sashimi is really good!   We ordered the Chirashi don (on the menu called Kaizen Don) and it did not disappoint.  On their dessert menu, they also have homemade Sake Ice cream (made in-house) but they were sold out for the day.  I would come back again just to try their Sake Ice Cream and their other speciality rolls.   Like all the other reviews have said, their service is excellent. The servers are constantly refilling our tea and water every few minutes.  They have limited seating and all their tables are meant for 4+ people. They don't have any singles seats if you decide to come alone."}
{"text":"We've tried every Japanese restaurant within a 15km radius and Kintako is our favourite, by far. I read all the (outstanding) Yelp reviews before trying it but I'd never heard of this place so I was a little wary that it might not live up to its 4.8 star rating. Well, it does.   First - the service. The servers are the friendliest, warmest, loveliest people. They wave to me through the window as I drive up (knew who I was after our first visit, and we've been countless times since then). They remember our preferences from visit to visit. They even called me back when I called to make a reservation before the opened, saw my # on the call display and rang me back as soon as they opened.  Now, to the good part. The food. Fantastic. The tempura is some of the best I've ever had. Light, crispy batter, and always served piping hot. The Kintako Special (teishoku) meal has a bit of everything. We literally order it every single time. The sushi is amazing, so fresh and good portion sizes. When you get sushi that comes with a meal most restaurants serve you run of the mill California roll or a cucumber roll... not Kintako! I've had unagi, butterfish, all premium fish.   Have taken many friends and guests there and they all rave about \"that little restaurant down the street\". Give this little place a try, you won't be disappointed! Very kid-friendly, there is street parking after 6pm. We'll be coming back again and again."}
{"text":"I was expecting a lot going into this restaurant, just look at the ratings! I'm very excited!  During my meal I was quite puzzled by this hype. I experience nothing special at all. I had better sushi and Japanese food at many other places. Why!?  The sushi freshness was mediocre and the tempura was a little oily. We waited a long time for our food because we have a big group. Seems like there was only one sushi chef working so the speed was understandable. The waitress keep telling us they want to serve everybody at our table at once so all the other smaller tables got their food first. I don't quite understand this procedure.  Service was excellent but service alone won't do it for me.   Taste ** Price *** Portion **"}
{"text":"Came here today due to the overwhelming positive reviews of this restaurant and wanted to see what the hype was all about.  My meal consisted of  1) Sushi Delight Dinner ($12.95) 2) Volcano Roll ($11.95)  Here's the rating: Environment: 5/5 Service: 5/5 Food: 4/5 Price: 5/5  It's a small restaurant, but had lots of comfortable sofa booth seats.  There was the back patio that I did not use due to how hot it was today.  They had the A/C on and it was comfortable (not freezing cold or turned down to a point that you can't feel it).  They had authentic Japanese music playing in the background (most of them ranging between 80s to late 90s along with some more classic old school Japanese music).  Parking would probably be an issue for the weekday goers, but certainly wasn't an issue for me granted I went on a weekend.  There was space at the back so it wasn't too troublesome to park.  Service was excellent. Like the others have reported, they asked multiple times how the food was and if I liked the dinner.  Service was also quick (there weren't too many people around).  Contrary to a review written on here, the staff here are not Japanese. If you listen to their conversation, you would identify that it is in fact Korean that they are speaking in. So this is not an authentic Japanese restaurant, but that didn't bother me at all.  The food was alright.  They didn't follow the traditional Japanese restaurant makis and rolls which I think is what makes this restaurant special.  This volcano roll was nowhere near spicy (I could barely taste any spice).  The flame added a really cool effect, which I liked and the ingredients tasted well.  Where it lost points was the quality of the rice. It felt overly sticky to me so everything just mushes in your mouth and it loses some of the taste.  Their Sushi Delight dinner was alright, but slightly underwhelmed by the amount of fish I got, but what can I expect for that price?  Still, this is where I've taken away 1 star for.  This brings me to Price!  The price  I thought was on the cheaper side of things, but the savings achieved were also at the cost of the quality of food.  Normal rolls nowadays cost somewhere between $12 - $17, granted they were bigger in size that the volcano roll I tasted.  The Sushi Delight was mostly rice with a few pieces of sashimi chopped into tiny blocks and served to you wrapped with an abundance of rice.  Would I return?   Possibly.  It's certainly not a bad place to go, but it won't be a place I'd take someone on a date to or where fanciness is a necessity."}
{"text":"Had the Red dragon Roll, dynamite roll and Yam tempura+advocado maki. Nice thin layer of rice on the maki rolls. Dragon roll was packed with goodness. Super friendly. Quiet. Toronto Sports team fans !"}
{"text":"Green tea was on the cool side. Spicy Salmon oily tasting and not spicy. Overall lacked flavour."}
{"text":"Interesting that so many of the glowing 5 star reviews are from people with less than 5 reviews. Something smells fishy, and it's not the sashimi.   Sincerely disappointed at my visit here. I've been to many Japanese restaurants. The food here was bland and forgettable. I wanted so much to like it since I brought my group here based on yelp reviews. The reviews are LIES. Zero chance this is five stars unless you've never had Japanese food before.   Zero chance. Which means the reviews are stacked.   Ive never been to a five star yelp restaurant and given a one star. That's how shocking the difference in quality was.   Go to a 3 star Korean-run Japanese restaurant and you'll be much happier with that meal and save on money. If you want to spend big bucks, go to any of the authentic Japanese restaurants in toronto.   Yelp should look into this."}
{"text":"4.5  Came here for a meal after a group event. Some of the better sushi I have had in the city.  Pros: Very well made sushi Friendly staff  Cons: No actual parking Prices a tad high (worth it though)  We came as a group of 12 and the place although on the smaller side, easily accommodated us.  The atmosphere is very ambient and provides a nice quiet dining experience.  We brought our little one with us and she was by far the loudest in the entire place.  Kintako offers a wide assortment of items that you can find at a Japanese restaurant.  The prices are a little higher than other places I have been but after eating there, it's well worth it.  The sushi and sashimi were some of the best I have had in the city.  There house favourite and special is the volcano roll which I have pictured.  The dish comes out flaming and is a mix of spicy and creamy tastes. I recommend this roll if you should happen to come by.  The service here was pretty good.  The servers were quick to refill water and our orders were filled promptly even though we had 12 of us there.  They were super polite and answered any question we may have had.    Kintako seems to not have any parking spaces of their own though,  You either take your chances with street parking or park across the street in the plaza with the TD bank, On a cold night as were came on, this can be a tad inconvenient.  Overall this is a great sushi place and if I'm the area I would definite frequent again."}
{"text":"We've eaten from here twice now and it is honestly the best-value, authentic Japanese place I've been to in Toronto, and East Toronto at that.  We've had the Kin dinner set for multiple people and ordered a few rolls.  They have a good rice to filling ratio and the fish is quite fresh.  The cooked items are really nicely flavoured.  They even have a kids bento too though we didn't get it for my son.  We ate in once and did delivery and it was great both times.  They did a great job on delivery with packaging too to make sure everything stayed separate and not soggy.  Totally recommend this place."}
{"text":"Had lunch here,  the sashimi teishoku. Surprisingly fresh.  Attentive service. Attention to details in plating, despite the simplicity of the meal. Good value as well. Portion size comfortable and read perfect for me (even though I have a bit appetite) to get me through to dinner.  Will come again."}
{"text":"Found Kintako by driving by at noon when we were hungry and deciding to stop in. Was heading down to the Danforth but in a spur of the moment decision just stopped. So glad we did. There was nobody inside when we went in right at noon which worried us a little but is was Good Friday so figured we'd stay despite the empty tables. Ordered a lunch special and a couple of rolls. The soup that was brought out first was my favorite part of the meal. It was so good. The salad dressing was nice as well (iceberg lettuce is okay if the dressing is tasty). The lunch special bento box was a good size. The rolls nice. My only reason for not giving the restaurant 5 stars is that the spicy mayo used on one of the rolls wasn't very spicy. Spicy salmon salmon rolls are best when they are spicy. So a little more meat please. With that said, we will definitely go back. And when in Leaside and looking for sushi, this is the place to stop at."}
{"text":"Service slow but nice, free ice cream to apologize. Amuse bouche of noodles and tempura broth nice. Miso soup salty and lacking flavor. Salad with dry lettuce under coleslaw and dressing. Sushi good but spotty. Butterfish unusually tough. Torched salmon very nice as with unagi. Rolls tough."}
{"text":"I stumbled here because I was looking for sushi and udon in this area. The yelp reviews were very helpful. The staff were soooo nice and the service was great.   The tempura udon was really good and o had the sushi combo. The owner seems to know many of the guests and regulars. She knew it was our first visit and at the end, I was about to order dessert but she brought a play with 1 scoop of each of the ice creams (green tea, vanilla, and black sesame) and tempura bananas.   It was really good and I would definitely come back! I'm getting the flames tuna/scallop rolls next time!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is truly a hidden gem, and needs recognition for God and service being 5 stars. The employees were so nice and always making sure everything was great and if we needed anything. Love the complimentary green tea start. The sushi was phenomenal ESP the appetizers. We had spicy medallions which were my favorite. The rolls were all fresh and so tasty."}
{"text":"Service is beyond five stars -- I forgot to tell them about a food allergy (unagi) until the end of the meal, when I asked them to pack all the leftovers except the unagi sushi. The waitress apologized (for my mistake) and when we got home we realized they had given us a couple of freshly-made salmon sushi in place of the unagi we left behind. Totally without our asking. When we went back for our second visit 3 weeks later, they remembered us and made a point of not giving us any eel in the first place (again, without our asking).  Let me also address an unwarranted criticism in another review.... lots of 5-star ratings from 3- and 4-time Yelpers. Perhaps these are not rookies as implied but they don't bother posting a review unless they feel very strongly about a place?   If you sit in the resto and listen to people arriving, you'll realize that a large part of their customer base are repeat customers as they are greeted with a warm, friendly, knowing smile from the staff. Look at all the chopsticks set aside at the door for the regulars. Enough said.  On to the food....volcano roll is a hit both visually and tastely. (I know, that's not a word.) Salad is leaps and bounds above ANY other salad I've had at any other Japanese resto, and that includes high-end places. Dressing's unique gingery taste combined with the crunchy fresh greens is so much better than what you get at most other places. Complimentary soup/noodles is a nice touch.   The sashimi is fresh -- not sure why others are critical. Big thick slices give you value for money, unlike other cheaper places that look like they shaved the fish using Kramer's deli meat slicer (\"so thin you can't even see them\"). Rolls (like volcano) are tasty and unique. Tempura was light and perfectly cooked.  One thing missing from apps is beef ribs (only available as a full dinner).   Presentation is top notch with nice touches in mixed set dinners as well as sushi/roll platters.   Really not a lot to complain about. We'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Great local sushi spot with complimentary small apps to start your meal. Warm and friendly service. The eel donburi is awesome and comes with a side of cantaloupe. Why? Who cares. It's awesome. Prices are very reasonable as well. Will be coming back for sure."}
{"text":"Great service and amazing fresh sushi. They carefully hand craft your sushi and hand rolls, you can tell with every bite that they took their time to make the sushi.  Please try their black sesame ice cream!"}
{"text":"We went to this place at Thursday around 4pm, there's no customers at that time, so we get the food very quickly, and the service is helpful. The atmosphere is delightful, the plates r adorable.  As for the food, They serve free noodle soup to start, and it's quite good. We ordered Gyu Dun(beef rice),  Backed salmon roll( this one is the must have dish) Cucumber covered roll, Grilled squid ( the squid is fresh and they don't put as much sauce as other restaurants, in stead, they add fresh mango cubes and sweet pepper cubes, and the squid was just grilled perfectly.)"}
{"text":"Came here on Tuesday in the early evening after work. My boyfriend and I were both very hungry and craving sushi. We have our usual go-to spot, but we weren't in the neighbourhood. So, we decided to try this place out based on the reviews here on Yelp.  The restaurant is relatively small, but has quite a bit of seating space. When we walked in, it was pretty empty with only one other table taken. As we started sifting through the menu, lots of people started coming in, especially a bigger party of about 12 people. Due to the space limitations, the party was seated in the middle of the restaurant close to everyone else in the side booths.  The menu was easy to read. The selection and prices were average. Once we decided what we wanted, we had to wait quite a while to be seen for our order. There was only one staff member on the floor that was serving pretty much a full house. Being very hungry, it wasn't a great start but we waited and waited... At some point the waitress came to our table, but then left soon after without taking our order to do something for the larger party. I had also noticed that one of the people at that party (that came after he) decided to go to the front and place their order while we were waiting for someone to come see us...not great. Towards the end of our stay, a second waitress arrived which helped move the service a bit more quickly.   When we were finally noticed, we ordered a spicy salmon roll, unagi roll and the green dragon roll. Then we ordered their chicken teriyaki set and the sashimi set.   We received a complimentary soup on the house that many others have already posted pictures of and it was very good. The house salad has a really nice sesame dressing, unlike many places that put the typical thousand island dressing.  Finally our rolls came and it was a bit disappointing. They were quite small and didn't really taste like anything. The sashimi was presented beautifully, but the pieces were quite small. Finally, the chicken teriyaki had a very odd taste to it. It did come with little sides that were fun to eat, but overall the meal wasn't anything special unfortunately. Due to the wait, they offered us two complimentary scoops of ice cream (green tea and black sesame) which tasted great and they apologized.  Overall, I find it quite difficult to judge this place since they were a full house and you can tell that the staff really cares. Either way, I would hope that they would be prepared to serve a full house. So, I may need to come back and see how it goes another time when they are less busy. The service was slow, but the waiters were kind and did their best given the circumstances. The food wasn't spectacular, so I'm not sure if I will be back."}
{"text":"Kintako exceeded my expectations for good sushi. The volcano roll was exceptional, also had the beef and tuna tatake. Everything else we tried on the menu was solid, no complaints. Going again this week! I consider this place a hidden gem in Toronto."}
{"text":"Rating: 4.5/5  Pros: - great tasting sushi; very fresh - nice variety of rolls - rolls were big but had a thin rice layer  - excellent service  - free appetizers in between dishes  Cons: - were out of sea urchin for the day (came for Saturday dinner around 8pm)   Definitely recommended!"}
{"text":"FOOD: I can't say I was terribly impressed by their maki, but they were not bad either. I think I need to go back and try more items on the menu to make up my mind about this place. The lunch special maki set was not a good indicator of the overall quality of food, since it only gave me a limited understanding of their culinary repertoire.   As Mark T. pointed out on Aug 15, 2017, most Japanese restaurants do not have miso soup with noodles, which was absolutely delicious. I even asked for an extra one :) Because of that alone, this place stands above most sushi restaurants.  SERVICE: Even though we waited longer than we should have for our food to be served, the service was very friendly and courteous. The lady working there is super sweet and nice. We had a great chat. She's a genuinely nice person, not because she wants to be nice to customers, because of her personality and how she treats people.  If you want my recommendation, I would say it's a safe choice in that neighbourhood if you're craving Japanese."}
{"text":"incredible sushi, attentive service, fresh fresh fish, accessible Leaside location.  i gravitate to sushi restaurants run by Japanese people. the food is really great and the staff are awesome. A traditional Japanese menu followed by a wide range of sushi and an extensive \"special sushi\" list with a number of very inventive rolls (and I'm not one for theatrics). Highly recommend for a great neighborhood sushi spot."}
{"text":"This review is based on my lunch experience at Kintako.  Sushi Set ($9.95) with 6 pieces of nigiri sushi and half of them was salmon! The shari rice was packed a little too loose and most of them just fell apart when I was trying to eat them.  Service was attentive and pleasant.   I also like the idea that they making a lot of their sauces in house without MSG.   Nice patio at the back if you like to eat sushi outdoor.  Kintako is a good neighbourhood Japanese restaurant, but not worth a special trip just to come here to eat."}
{"text":"Good food. Great service. Came here with coworkers for a quick lunch. The place looks really nice inside. Very satisfied after the meal."}
{"text":"This is definitely one of most authentic japanese restaurants I have tried so far in TO. It looks a little bit run down and needs a bit of renovation but for me, who cares? As long as the food is worth it. I am paying for the food and not the ambience anyway. I tried a few places where the place is really nice but the food is crap so I prefer having it the other way around. I don't know why it wasn't busy when we came but the food is really good so I will definitely come back, or if I'm too lazy, will probably just order for delivery. Lucky that I live a bit close to the place!"}
{"text":"I have to order the volcano roll everytime I come here. They also have my favourite black sesame ice cream. Excellent service and my taste buds are happy."}
{"text":"This is a nice little family-run restaurant. There was even a small Asian child in the booth behind us at one point. I ordered the chicken katsu lunch special and my girlfriend got the volcano roll. The volcano roll was pretty good. It comes out on fire and reminded me of JaBistro's aburi sushi except it's about half the price at Kintako. I liked the chicken katsu a lot! The sauce was different from the usual kind you get with katsu dishes. Also, the lunch special came with some cantaloupe, seaweed salad, fried tofu, soup and rice. I thought it was a pretty good deal for the price. Also, the service was friendly and efficient. My only complaints are is that they only have street parking and that might be hard to find at times, and also the dessert that we got, the mochi ice cream, was kind of underwhelming compared to the mains."}
{"text":"House soup was a nice treat. The salad was mainly cabbage with ginger mayo dressing which was different but good. We ordered the Kintako special which came with a bit of everything ( teriyaki, sushi/sashimi, miso soup, salad, rice, tempura. The salmon teriyaki was cooked perfectly, not dry. The only negative was the tempura wasn't crispy. We also ordered the udon soup with spicy salmon rolls. Food was good. Service was friendly."}
{"text":"I passed by this restaurant a few times but was hesitant to try. My sister told me about this place and decided to try it with her. We came for lunch and tried the spicy maki combo.  For starters, we were given the house noodle soup and that was amazing! After that, our miso soup and salad came. The dressing was very tasty, different from all the other sushi restaurants-(aka thousand island dressing). My order came and my food was presented beautifully. I had 3 rolls, spicy salmon, spicy tuna, and spicy California roll. The rolls were actually spicy, it wasn't like the other restraints were they just squirt spicy mayo on top. The food was really good! Ever since then that's the only thing I have ordered!  The lady that's there all the time who takes/ serves you is really sweet. She makes sure that everything is perfect. I recommended this restaurant to my friends and they also fell in love with it. For $12-15 lunch specials you get a lot of food and get full."}
{"text":"Came here a lot a lot a lot. Honestly love all their dishes, my go to order is their chirashi meal, super filling, super fresh and obviously super good. Ordered their 2 person meal as well and many many others. My favorite midtown Japanese place, if you're in the neighborhood, please go try it out, the service was also great, super attentive!"}
{"text":"This is by far the BEST SUSHI in the GTA. The service is awesome and food magnificent with really good prices.  I have tried several restaurants and this is my favorite one."}
{"text":"AMAZING!! Just finished late dinner with the husband. We shared a sushi combination, and seafood Udon, and it was tasty and huge! Husband usually eats a lot, but this time it was out of his league so we took some leftovers home. What can I say? We are waiting for tomorrow to eat the rest (; Don't skip the desert! That Japanese ice cream with rice cake (don't remember the name, something like Ochi Ice) is fun to your mouth! While talking to the waitress, which was nice and welcoming, we figured out that the the food is homemade, which explains why everything tastes like it was made to order.  We would definitely come here again, the price are reasonable, the food is really good, the portions are great, and the service is better than $150 per person restaurants."}
{"text":"Was craving sushi on my vacation.  Actually, I wanted to drink sake!  Kintako was the closest to my hotel and had 4.5 stars.  Trust Yelp, right?!  WRONG!  LoL j/k  Huge sign out front--can't miss it--\"SUSHI\"!  OK, hopeful for the best!  Crossing my fingers!  A small establishment that was full on this Sunday night.  After a short wait, we were seated.  Warm and welcoming ambience of a mom & pop restaurant.  Korean owned and all the workers were Korean.  Service here is superb!  Sweet ajumma treated us like we were family!  Comping me miso soup and offering a sample of a new sake.  Super sweet lady!  Delightful woman!  Geez, am I related to her?  LoL  So far, so good!!  How was the food?  =( Did you have to ask?!  LoL  The food didn't fare too well, at least IMO.  I ordered nigiri and a specialty roll.  The hamachi didn't look fresh.  And the sushi rice... oh boy!  The sushi rice was cold, hard and dry!  I think their sushi chefs flunked rice 101.  Lost on Kintako was presentation of my order.  Their Hot Night specialty roll was sloppy: refer to pic (https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/kintako-japanese-restaurant-toronto?select=augADZH_PdYXnfnMxqi9Fw).  I would give here 3 stars but going to cut Toronto a break since I am foreign to their food landscape.  My USA standards might be too high for Canada.  j/k, Canada!!  With improvements to technique, their food can match their stellar service!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch today and was really happy I did. I ordered the sashimi lunch special and black sesame icecream for dessert. The chef did a spectacular job in presentation and taste. Everything looked like it was delicately plated ever so carefully. What pleased me more was that the food tasted very refreshing and bountiful flavours complemented each other. I can't wait to go back for the black sesame icecream that was paired with what looked to be baked slices of pear and peach, sprinkled with sweet oats. Can I eat this every day please?? To be noted, they have a cute patio open for the summer. I shall come back again!"}
{"text":"Found this place by reading Yelp reviews and was not disappointed. The best sushi I've had in the city. Everything is made impeccably and the service is excellent. Moved into the area last week and I've already been twice. The tofu appetizer is amazing. A bit out of the way but definitely worth the drive. Highly highly recommend"}
{"text":"We went to Kintako on a Friday night. Parking may be a bit of an issue. After 6, you can park on the street right in front of the restaurant. Or you need to park in a side street. Seating was easy. Service was great. The food was excellent. Really fresh sushi. Good tempura ... and they brought a separate dipping sauce for each of us. Short ribs was amazing. We finished off with green tea ice cream, and they were kind enough to give us a complimentary black sesame ice cream for us to taste. Prices were reasonable. I have to repeat: sushi was really fresh and high quality.  Fun fact: Kintako means golden (kin) octopus (tako)."}
{"text":"Nice cozy ambience, good sea food miso soup, great Unagi & good crunchy spicy salmon roll.  Would definitely visit this again - for taste of food, value for money & decent service."}
