{"text":"Decent grub but sooooo overpriced!!! C'mon folks, it's just humble BBQ in a somewhat rough part of town-with no seating! Drop your prices and I'm there everyday!"}
{"text":"I have been here a few times and I will definitely come back. The food is amazing and authentic plus the price isn't bad at all either."}
{"text":"This place is very easy to miss and I'm very surprised that my coworker found this place yet I'm very glad he did because this is going to be my new lunch spot!   The lady who was working was very helpful and explained how the place worked, you get two sides with your meal. I ended up getting quarter of rotisserie chicken with potato balls and coleslaw with barbecue sauce. The chicken itself was so juicy and fresh, wasn't dried out like some chicken places and the bbq sauce was nice and sweet! The potatoes were so tender and cooked to perfection and the coleslaw was something I will be returning for. Not only does it taste great, she gave me A LOT of it too and I'm a huge coleslaw fan. Got everything for $8.50!!   Highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"Ok, I'm sooo glad the past owner sold the business (she was RUDE and the food AWFUL!)  YOU might find it weird that this churrasqueira is owned by a Uki lady! I could swear I've seen Mexican on the menu too! LOL That's not an issue, the FOOD IS GOOD and clearly made with love. I really want this business to do well! Only 3 stars as the business is just starting, I will keep exploring the menu and maybe update the review later..."}
{"text":"We stopped here purely by chance as we were driving by. The couple who owned this place were the kindest people who made the most amazing food, at an amazing price too. The lady was very sweet, she threw in some free fish dumpling things (? Not sure what they're called) with our meal. The entire interaction with the owners was extremely positive. They also had the best Portuguese tarts, enough to rival Venezia."}
