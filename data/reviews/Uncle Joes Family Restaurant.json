{"text":"The food was pretty good and has never been an issue at this restaurant. The prices are fair as well. After the last visit, I don't think I will be going back again during busy hours. The restaurant seems understaffed in my opinion and it took forever to flag one of the three staff down. We were kept waiting for our order to be taken, for our dishes to be cleared after the main course, and to get the bill after dessert. No one ever came around to offer refills on drinks. I do feel for the staff members though, as they didn't seem to have a moment to rest.  Note that this restaurant is not very accessible. There is a step at the entrance, and a couple steps to get to the back room. The washrooms are down in the basement."}
{"text":"Horrible from the start! Bad service, bad food and bad experience today. Icing on the cake was receiving my salad ten minutes after i finished my meal. Had they have asked how my meal was or if I needed anything i could have reminded them sooner. Never again"}
{"text":"Went here the day after father's day dinner with my family only to avoid all the noise and craziness.  All my friends have been here with their families and said some good things about this place.  Firstly, the decor is WAY out of date, it's quite gross actually.  Like everybody has stated, ugly paintings, furniture, wall paper, furniture, etc.  There were only two servers working, one knew what she was doing, the other was running around lost and confused.  I just did a quick glimpse at the dated menu, but nothing special.  I pre-ordered a lamb leg earlier in the day, as it takes hours to slow cook.  When it came out the meat was fall off the bone, perfectly cooked and spiced.  Came with soup, garlic bread, buttered rice and baked vegetables.  My sister, who despises lamb, had a craving for chicken wings.  They were big and the skin was very airy and chrispy.  It was only the four of us, but we left with two extra takeout meals of rice and lamb.  Here's why I gave the restaurant an extra star, it's the price.  We only paid $90, tax and tip (paid by cash).  I think I would go back again for a special occasion."}
{"text":"I know going in what this place is like.  I've been there before, and a further disclaimer I'm from Hong Kong of Chinese descent.  The service wasn't too good to start off with.  Dishes arrived late, orders were wrong and the food....where should I start.  We were a party of 11, I ordered a rib-eye that was supposed to come with a salad.  First of all the garlic bread had ZERO garlic flavour in it.  Then there's the steak.  I ordered it rare, it came medium-rare.  Yes there's a difference and yes to me it makes a difference.  My girlfriend's cousin ordered a surf and turf (lobster & angus steak) and while she wanted medium well, it came as rare.  Not only that, they mixed up her order AND it was originally (the mixed up dish) was delivered late.  They fixed the order, but the order came with only lobster and they served the steak after.    When we left, I looked at the kitchen.  No wonder they always screw things up.  2 guys manning the kitchen with dockets flying out of the machine is just a recipe for disaster.  Not only that, the \"grill\" is just a 2 burner griddle.  Good luck getting your cuts of meat cooked properly on that joke of a \"grill\".    Would NOT go back."}
{"text":"Great portion sizes and relatively cheap.. Can't really go wrong here."}
{"text":"I've never had Veal Parmigiana with zero Parmesan cheese on it and no mozzarella. Instead got 2 cheese blend of cheddar. Yuck!   Spaghetti was done properly - not over cooked. Steamed vegetables were okay too. Coffee is very good.   Didn't hang around for dessert."}
{"text":"A simple, no nonsense place to get a hearty breakfast or brunch. Don't expect the eggs Benny to be Smash or Inspire style, this place is all about simplicity. If you don't have a lot of time this place is great and very reasonably priced however if you are looking for something more modern and trendy check out Smash Bistro or Inspire. Of course you will pay much more."}
{"text":"I decided to try it out one night with my boyfriend and....I LOVEEEEEED it!!!  We both ordered the \"Uncle Joe Burger\" and when it came...it was the biggest burger I had ever seen..all for $6.99!!  First of all, there was a nice juicy layer of beefy patty, with 2 strips of bacon on top, a pile of mushrooms and melted cheese all over that....yum!!  there was also lettuce, tomatoes, pickle...you know, the basics.  All of this came with fries or you can add soup or salad for $1 more.  It is definitely the best place to have a burger!"}
{"text":"great greasy spoon on Main St in Markham. I used to live right above them a number of years back, and basically tried everything on the menu --  nothing is outstanding, nothing is bad.  I normally got either Fish and Chips (light and flaky) or a Hot Meat sandwich (Hamburger, Chicken or Beef per my mood for the day).  Their soups are great and flavorful, but i suspect they are basically Campbell's canned soup.  The eat i experience is nothing to write home about --   the staff are pleasant but not overly friendly.  Soft drinks are served from cans -- not fountain, and as such -- no refills!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to this restaurant since I was in grade school and always loved their food. It's nothing fancy, just simply made, Western foods. Their food is affordable and hits the spot. When I'm looking for a fancy steak, this may not be the place to go. But if I'm looking for a quick dinner fix that tastes like Americanized home cooking, this is where I head. The restaurant is cosy, the staff are nice, and the place is right in the middle of old Main Street Markham (meaning I can go for a nice stroll to walk off my big meals)!"}
{"text":"I've got to agree with most of the reviews I've read on this place - it ain't half bad. If you're looking for traditional diner comfort food, cooked on a flat top, and/or deep fried... this is how it's done. It's not healthy, it's not the best you've ever had, but it's cheap, it's fast, it tastes pretty damn good and does the trick.   For being a classic diner with a classic name like Uncle Joes, complete with wood fixtures and booths, it does all good. The one-man asian restauranteur behind the counter who sets your table, takes your order, cooks the food and cleans up, I give full points to. Nothing was bad, it wasn't mind blowing good... but it wasn't half bad at all. Seriously.   I think I'm actually surprised with how good East can do Western style food, when west botches eastern cuisine left and right (not that Western food is all that hard... burgers, fries, fish & chips, etc, etc). But again... not half bad at all!  I had The Joes Burger which came with fries and was topped with cheese, bacon and mushrooms (and the regular toppings). The bacon was a touch over done for my taste but other than that.... not bad at all! I don't usually down a lot of my fries but they were crispy on the outside and soft on the inside! And for $9 tax IN, I can't complain.  If you're on Markham Main and feeling like some comfort food, why not pop into this local diner. It did the trick for me and... It's not half bad!   Eatcrest (surprised) and Out!"}
{"text":"This one of the best place to eat roast lamb. You need to pre-order the roast lamb leg. It will come with fixings for 5 to 7 people. The leg will be roaster to perfection and your liking. It will be slices and served. The meat close to the bone will be a bit raw, so they will then roast the remaining meat. This meal comes with rice, stir fried vegetables and soup.  The spring lamb rack have 6 ribs. It is roasted to perfection and very well seasoned. It will melt in your mouth.  It you are venturefull.  You should have the liver and onions. It is soooo tender that it melts in your mouth. Love it"}
{"text":"After writing the review for this restaurant I felt like going for some of that veal parmesan. However my most recent visit has caused me to rate the restaurant with 3 stars, one less than my original rating. One of the minor reasons why I removed a star is because the free garlic bread wasn't as good as it used to be. However, that's not enough for me to remove a star. What the MAIN reason for my slight disappointment is the apple pie I ordered. This is the first time that I've ordered dessert at Uncle Joe's, because I've always been too full to have any. I really wish I hadn't. For an apple pie w/ ice cream that I'm paying $4.45 (somewhere around there) for, I really didnt expect to catch the waitress MICROWAVING my pie!! Instead of a crispy and flaky crust, the microwave made it soggy and unappealing. What was worse is how nonchalant she was about microwaving it. If you're going to do it, at least make sure that I don't catch you in the act. Very disappointed.  I will still return to have the dinner entrees, but never again will I be ordering dessert there. Never again."}
{"text":"Very friendly Chinese owned restaurant  I ordered  egg Benedict and breakfast 2eggs 1bacon special. The food tasted good but nothing special. The English muffin from the benedict came soggy and the home fries did not taste fresh. What tasted good was the hollandaise sauce.. Just delicious.  The service was attentive and funny. They were kind to tell us that they would be giving us complimentary coffee but ended up charging us anyway. No big deal   Overall my experience here is always enjoyable because of the cosy,homey feeling, also brings back my childhood memories.  Not to mention the price is cheap!"}
{"text":"I've had all-day breakfast here a number of times, and it's always been well prepared for a reasonable price. The service is good, and it has a diner atmosphere. The decor is pretty cheesy -- there's horrible prints on all the walls for some reason -- but it feels nice and homey. If you live nearby or are in the area, this is a solid choice if you are looking for a traditional bacon and eggs sort of breakfast."}
{"text":"The restaurant has good service and food quality. I ordered Sea Bass and was really tasty and delicious. I had a great time enjoying my dinner with one of my friends which ordered the New York steak. The atmosphere was good and the parking was easy to find once you know. There is a lot of parking space at the back. Nearing the end of the dinner, we also got the Cheese cake which was also good. I definitely recommend dining here"}
{"text":"Hmm, contrary to all the reviews.. I think they're just fine. Yes, the service isn't the best and fluctuates from time to time.. But there hasn't been a problem with me whenever I go. It depends on the lady, I think. There's a lady by the name Sarah (if I'm not wrong). She is super friendly and very willing to help you. The food was good and not like what some reviews says. Steak was fresh, but I got medium and not medium rare.. A little disappointed with that but overall a very good experience for coming here the.. 5th time? I always come with family, so maybe they're cool with my family, hence the decent to good service."}
{"text":"When my cousin suggested this place for a family dinner I was surprised he'd pick a non Chinese venue , but when I arrived I completely understood.   Although it looks otherwise, this place can be categorized as Chinese Western comfort food.   The place is still reminiscent of whatever the old resto that it used to be. We had the entire back room to ourselves as they tuned in the tv to TVB  The menu has a usual pub fare, but their speciality is lamb. Lamb leg, lamb shank , rack of lamb. I had the lamb shank, braised and fall off the bone. For $15 comes with soup/salad (get the soup) mashed potatoes and veggies. Also garlic bread.   The place is really interesting and a good place to take parents of all ages."}
{"text":"Having steak there every month is our family routine. Waitress are friendly, and the food is always nice. Feeling like home there.  Also, they are carrying the new year special menu recently with lobster, do not miss it."}
{"text":"My coworker suggested that I check out this restaurant after I told her that I wanted a hot roast beef sandwich.  When you walk in you can tell it's a diner feel with mismatched decor but it's cozy.  We were greeted and shown to our table and brought menus.  Definitely was not looking to get a steak here and so we ordered the hot roast beef sandwich, uncle joe burger and the kids pancake.  Our waitress was nice and helpful offered us tea and water.  She took our order and the food came out shortly after.  The kids pancake was more than enough with two generous servings of fluffy pancakes with bacon.  I didn't try it myself but my kids enjoyed it.  The uncle joe burger looked good and had all the trimmings including bacon.  Although be prepared for it to get messy.  Finally, the hot roast beef was surprisingly pretty good other than the fact that the bread they included as part of the sandwich was so thin and tiny I didn't even know it was there.  The gravy was already a bit cold by the time it got to the table but it was ok.  It came with fries and you can't really go wrong with that.  I did enjoy the vegetables that came with the plate as it was seasoned just right and had the extra kick of garlic.    Overall, gave it a three as it was good for what I would classify as diner meals.  It isn't the best but it's a place you can bring your kids too and enjoy a hearty meal."}
{"text":"Have come here for both lunch and breakfast and haven't been too disappointed. Prices are good and portions aren't bad. Reminds me of old school diner food. The fish and chips are quite popular for lunch with good portion sizes. I like the fact that the batter is nice and crisp and not oily. Burgers are diner style pre made patties- nothing special but good if you're looking for a simpler meal and don't want fast food from the big chains. Although I'll say this, the steak and lamb shank is really delicious and tender! Decide is outdated, there front of the restaurant is dark and old but there back is older but bright... Appears to be a remodel of storage room or something."}
{"text":"Simply traditional western style restaurant food in the $$ range. I got the ribs and chicken combo ($24), my mom got lamb shank ($18), and my dad got grilled chicken ($15).   Decor is dated, and in a sense, cute. It's quite dark in the foyer but it's much brighter inside. Spacing is quite comfy and you don't feel claustrophobic. The servers have uniforms and that's great because it ups the ambience. I'd recommend this place for families but it's a cute date place as well.   Food was a solid 4/5. My mashed potatoes had some lumps. I prefer totally creamy mash that melts in your mouth but they didn't have that. It was very potatoey. I think they don't use cream in their mash recipe but it was alright. The gravy was decent enough to make for that.   Ribs were great! My combo has a ton of meat. I eat a lot, and this is one entrée that actually made me feel full. Veg was flavourful with the few spices and herbs they used. I'd totes recommend this combo.   The lamb shank came with carrot sauce which was very fitting for the strong taste of lamb. Texture was alright but I don't think they marinated or seasoned the lamb enough, if at all, before they poured the sauce. I still liked it, but not as much as the ribs and chicken.   They don't come with drinks except for plain tea or water. I got tea. It was yum!   The soup we had was cream of veg and it was delicious. That hint of kale helped up the favour. Would have preferred a few mushrooms to make the taste more complex.   I recommend this place for sure. Prices are average. Although run by Asians, the quality is quite good and if you are hungry, this place w fill you up.   These entrées come with a soup or salad, garlic bread, and veg."}
{"text":"Took my kids to have dinner here.  They have \"All Day Breakfast\" - which I knew I couldn't go wrong.  However the kids wanted the kids menu, which was great as well.  The restaurant is cosy and it has its regulars.  The food is ok, your typical American Food.  I had a Uncle Joe's Burger, it was quite good.  Not sure, if it was because I was hungry."}
{"text":"Not sure what anyone is expecting when they go here. The food is cheap, service is quick and food tastes good. It is what it is - a diner on Main Street Markham. It's not a steak house - so don't expect top notch steak, because they use a flat top and like I said they are not a steak house. If i was in the mood for steak or Italian food, I would not go to a diner serving Canadian cuisine  Who really cares where the owner & waitresses are from. Are you there to eat or get to know them? I would never expect 5 star dining at a diner that offers \"traditional Canadian cuisine\" on their sign.   Some of my fav items:  Potato skins - ample cheese, bacon & toppings - done right Breakfast - generous portions, crispy bacon - coffee is good which is a plus Clubhouse sandwich - one of my favs - they use fresh chicken not cold cuts like a lot of places do So many other items - no complaints - kids love it too  I've been going to Uncle Joe's for almost 12 years now - maybe 3-4 times a year. Always had good service, never sent any food back and would I go back - YES!"}
{"text":"I went there this past weekend with my family for my belated birthday dinner. Including me, there's four people in my immediate family so we decided to each get something different to try out their different dishes. I got a rack of lamb, my sister got veal parmesan, my mom got a new york steak, and my dad got grilled chicken.  The salads were pretty normal, like nothing special, but my mom did compliment their Italian dressing. All four of us loved their bread. It was toasted, but oh so soft with light butter. While the rest of my family chose a salad over soup, I got the fish chowder. It was amazing. I'm a huge fan of soups and tried many different kinds. It was obvious that the ingredients in the chowder was all fresh and was not oily at all. Its consistency was just right, not too thick nor too watery.  As for the entrees, they were amazing as well. I loved it when there's a bit of redness in my meats, and they were just cooked to the point as we requested. The mint sauce that came with my lamb was the best part of my entree. I've had lamb many times, but it was the first time that it came with such great mint sauce on the side. Near the end of it I felt like I want more lamb just to dip into the sauce. Their grilled chicken was also great. At first I thought it's probably nothing special, like ordinary chicken. But their chicken was so tender and you can just taste the gilled lines on the chicken..if this even makes sense. We also got baked potatoes as our sides and it came with a huge stand for compliments filled with their very own sour cream, bacon bits, and chopped onions.   The atmosphere of the restaurant was also very nice. It had a very cozy family or neighborhood style. Once we entered the restaurant they gave us a round table because the waitress knew we were a family of four, so a round table would give a more family-feel, very considerate of them!"}
{"text":"Loved it. The server who I presume was also the owner was very welcoming and friendly. I had the in-house burger and thought that it was one of the best which I haven't had in a long time! Their fries and onion rings are super crisp! A great place to stop for a bite to eat!"}
{"text":"It's another traditional/comfort food, but done just mediocre.  The decor seems too dingy and and seats aren't the most comfortable. Prices were okay - about what you'd expect for a typical lunch or dinner, but the quality fell short.  We were informed that some sauces were out and so we had to get terriyaki sauce with our steak?! Service was fairly lacking, even on a night with just 2 small tables to serve! The kitchen seemed pretty close, as it was fairly noisy with clanging once in a while."}
{"text":"Enjoyed my meal!  Party of 7, lots of choices.  Had the veal Parmesan.  Family had rack of lamb, rib eye, meals came with garlic bread and soup. Though the decor is dated, it was a clean restaurant.  I believe it is a family owned restaurant, the staff was very friendly."}
{"text":"This place is an a-OK place...Chinese owned Western food. How do Chinese people cook real Western food, the taste, the smell its not fully there.  This place is family owned...(uh-duh..look at the name), don't think about ANY fancy decors as that's not available, no hot waitress/servers that will check up on you frequently. So yeah..its an A-OK!  The breakfast, I have to give credit to since the Omelet is really good, no matter if it is western and/or veggies and ham. Good job deserves a star!  I tried the French Onion Soup, the onions were not caramelized greatly, perhaps not even caramelized. I've had really good French Onion Soup in the past, So I probably had higher expectations    The price is considered to be acceptable. Not very expensive and not yet inexpensive.  All in all, I will probably only come back for breakfast but not dinner."}
{"text":"Food is decent, but the service is absolutely horrible.  We had a question on one of their menu items, and basically the Chinese old lady basically walked off and asked in Chinese to the manager to \"deal with the customer\".  They have absolutely no idea how to serve western food at all.  The staff seems to be fine with talking on the phone while serving their customers while texting with the other hand, true story.  You've been warned."}
{"text":"Hubby wanted to come here to give it a go. I said sure why not. It's a really dated decor Asian owned Diner Style Place. They had an all day breakfast menu as well as other entree, sides etc..I didn't have breakfast and we woke up late so I went for their breakfast options.   I got the Steak & Eggs, scrambled eggs & Medium Rare Steak. The meal came with toast. It was an ok meal. But my eggs were a little too done for my taste. The New York Strip Steak was also a bit over cook for me as well. It was more medium well than medium rare.   Hubby ordered the Joe's Burger. He loved it said it reminded him of the old days. I took a few of his fries! They were super crispy and soft fluffiness inside!! A+++ for the fries."}
{"text":"Uncle Joe's always been a solid choice   I always get 1 of 2 choices:  The all day breakfast option of the Western Omelette (safe. great omelette and comes with home fries) OR The Uncle Joe's Burger. (amazing burger flavour! Straight from the grill and surprises us every time with the taste!)  I don't really think the rest of the menu has ever been items I would re-order, hence why I tend to stick back with the regular two options. Mostly, I just love the homely environment and the staff are so kind here. :) Sometimes we do a family dinner and reserve a lamb leg, which they always get just right!!"}
{"text":"I would go here for breakfast on a weekend. It's a good quiet place to relax, have a cup of coffee and enjoy an old fashioned breakfast of bacon, eggs, toast and hash browns. Nothing fancy. Pretty good price for what you get and our server was good, She refilled our coffee several times and checked in on us to see if our meal was ok. The decor is so nostalgic with the booths and wood paneling. In fact, I haven't seen this much wood paneling since I went to The Octagon. There's a diner-style vibe that's kind of charming. The food is basic but sometimes, that's all you need. Couldn't hook up to the wifi but that's ok they had old time news papers to read. How quaint is that?"}
{"text":"We ordered an all day breakfast vegetarian omelette , and grill chicken with veggies that came with a seafood soup. We loved the taste because it is not very strong (Good for people who want to eat healthier and less sodium) Price is amazingly cheap compare to other home style restaurants in that area . Two meal less than $25 ( tax included). Server was friendly."}
{"text":"A quiet place for weekday dinner.  Apparently it gets pretty busy on the weekends. Great steak dinner. Perfectly done, almost crispy on the outside but totally tender on the inside. Haven't had steak that good in a while. Lamb shank stew is really flavorful but the meat is on the lean side."}
{"text":"Great spot!!! The hollandaise sauce is amazing and the coffee is out of this world! Friendly staff and very speedy service. The food is quite tasty and the decor is quite nice. The chandelier gives it a rustic look!  It's good to see a family business buzzing with customers on an early Sunday morning. They support local business and advertise them on the plate mats which I thought is noble.   A definite spot to try out :D"}
{"text":"This place is not bad, even it's Asian owned making western style food. They offer decent leg of lamb. Made to order ( order in advance) . It's fresh as the meat is pretty tender and juicey. I would recommend this to anyone but its a bit pricey. i never tried other foods there other than the lamb."}
{"text":"Came here with my family the other day, between us we got the fish and chips, chicken with teriyaki sauce, steak and fish.  My fish and chips were great especially for the price, fish was crispy on the outside and tender on the inside, and the fries were fantastic.  I tried some of the chicken and it was very good as well, and I had no complaints about the fish and the steak.  Our server Anne was friendly and attentive.  The only thing I wasn't into was the decor, I can see the charm in it but it felt dusty and old without charm.  I sat in the back, where the lighting was much better, but there was an area that smelt terrible."}
{"text":"This review is for a dinner experience only.  Overall, 2.5 stars  Uncle Joe's is a diner.  Its all day breakfast is renowned, but the dinner experience has room for improvement.  We ordered a Jumbo Shrimp Cocktail and a French Onion Soup as starters, and a Seafood Salad and Cajun Burger as entrees.  The French Onion soup was really good, with lots of cheese, onion, and sodium (we love salt).  The shrimp cocktail was refreshing, but the shrimps were definitely not jumbo (misleading menu).  The seafood on the salad was just fake crab meat and a few shrimps, but I will give it that, though uninspiring, it is not false advertisement.  The Cajun Burger was not spicy in any way.  It was a plain burger.  As a plain burger, it was good though.  Lesson learned is that 1) the descriptions in menu are over inflated, 2) stick to basics like hamburger, not fancy Cajun burger and 3) order all day breakfast if at all possible."}
{"text":"Taste: 3 Service: 3 Value: 5 Presentation: 3 Overall: 3.4 rounded down to 3  Hi and welcome to another episode of javing it with Javier. Let's see what we are javing today. Lot's of things to try today. Onion rings, garlic bread, salad and their cream soup to start. For the main we have steak with fries, shrimp, mashed potatoes, and veggies. Let's dive right into the review.  Lots of appetizers to go through so I will be brief. Salad is salad but it did have some flavour in it from the sauce, the soup was adequate, onion rings tasted like the ones from McCain (which I like so I'm not complaining), and the garlic bread was fairly tender although it wasn't bursting with flavour. The size of the main dish was huge! Trying out the steak first, it wasn't evenly cooked throughout but it was generally OK. Everything else on the plate just like the steak was OK.  I have got to say for such a low price, they give you a lot of food. I was completely stuffed and didn't even get to finish my main dish. I can't expect any more from this place considering the portion sizes that they serve.   All in all, the food here isn't amazing but if you want a lot of average food for cheap, this is the place to go. That's it for today's episode of javing it with Javier. And remember food is life!"}
{"text":"The day before Canada Day and Inspire Restaurant was closed and Lemon Bistro were all reserved apparently so had to settle for Uncle Joes. The name of the restaurant is very decieving. This place is actually a Chinese run place serving western dishes. I have to say the food is not bad but not really impressive either. Just decent.   Ordered a half rack of ribs for $15.99 which comes with mash potatoes and gravy, veggies, a single slice of garlic bread and a cream soup. I really liked the soup. It was thick and had lots of flavour to it. The ribs were not the type of ribs I was expecting. I thought they would be baby back ribs but they were more like beef ribs in size. The sauce was not very impressive and really found that I was rushing myself to finish the ribs.   Also got a 1lb of deep fried chicken wings. The batter was very thick and the BBQ sauce on the side was terrible. Thank god they put the sauce on the side.   Also had pancakes with bacon. The pancakes were nice and fluffy and the bacon was crispy with a nice crunch to it.   Overall a decent place at best and I think they do breakfast type food better than the other things on the menu."}
{"text":"Great prices, good service, OK food. Went on a Sunday for brunch and had eggs benedict, no option for hash browns with it, only mashed potatoes with gravy or fries. Was just OK. Other people had french toast, just OK, omelette with mushrooms was thumbs up. Menu had lots of variety so everyone can find something they like. Steaks, burgers, all day breakfast."}
{"text":"Lamb leg is fantastic. Need to pre-order. Comes with seafood chowder which may have been great and may have been awful, but I couldn't say since my 4 year old gobbled it all up.   Also has sides of rice,vegetables and garlic bread, all of which are done well."}
{"text":"I always wanted to try this place out for breakfast but never woke up early to get my bum there. Mom wanted to  try something different so I suggested here.  She got the peppercorn steak with a side salad and mash potatoes in medium rare. The steak was meh... mash potatoes were not smooth at all. For 8oz it was $23?  I got the half tach ribs. These were by far the worst ribs I've had... it was clearly not marinated, meat did not fall off the bones. And it was tough to eat. The BBQ sauce was just slathered on and if you scrape it off you can see the meat looks boiled. It did not looked like it was barbecued. For the price I would never paid to go back"}
{"text":"It had been a while since we came here and decided to come for supper. There was a table available when we arrived but later there were people waiting for tables. The restaurant is older in style and offers the basic family restaurant food. I had the hot hamburger and my wife had the curry rice (which was not on the menu but she overheard someone else order it).  My wife said her curry rice was not that great. My hot hamburger was delicious, especially the gravy that was on top. Price was great (under 25$ for both) and the staff was friendly. The washrooms are located in the basement so not accessible for wheelchair or some seniors."}
{"text":"Simply asian western restaurant with dirty floor and chairs, they definitely need a renovation. We ordered new york steak and lambs. As you can see, the presentation of the dish is meh, both are decent, nothing much to say. And for the mashed potatoes, we spotted a fly on top of it which was gross. Although, she did change the potatoes, but I just lost my appetite. Do not understand why are other yelpers giving it high stars, maybe that's my unlucky day? However, if I am going to rate it just for the steak, I will still give it 2-3 stars. But in general, the environment isn't pleasing at all, everything is just dirty (cups, plates with lipstick mark and fingerprints). Probably will not come again, they should actually attend the Kitchen Nightmares."}
{"text":"run by Chinese... they have no idea how to make and serve western food. Never going back again. Period."}
{"text":"First time here.   Its a small family style resturant run by chinese.   Price is reasonable .  Food suprice me is very good comparing other chinese chef cooking a steak.   3 of us order one halibut steak , pork chop with mushroom sauce , n 10oz new york steak.   I also upgrade my soup to an onion soup for just for $3.5.  This resturant definatly not the highend steak house , but with the price they have , you cant complain.   I will come back for sure"}
{"text":"I don't understand why the reviews are so bad... I ordered a prime rib steak and it was very juicy and tender?and the seafood soup was rich and  delicious, but a little bit salty. Price was reasonable. Overall better than The Keg."}
{"text":"Nothing overtly offensive about this place, yet nothing special either. My father had the open faced beef sandwich and seemed to enjoy it. I had the club sandwich and it was standard, what I'd expect if I made it at home, which I do frequently. My kids had chicken fingers and pasta.The food was standard diner fare. The place was empty and the decor needs a refresh."}
{"text":"Good service, but moderate BF.  Love the setting and atmosphere, but kinda odd hearing people speaking cantonese while in a setting like that...ha   Must come back for the lunch / dinner, the menu for that looks enticing..."}
{"text":"Chinese owned diner style restaurant. The space can be cramped at times but the food is pretty good. Ordered the rack of lamb and it tasted amazing. Would def come back again."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why this restaurant is sitting at 3.5 stars. I think this place is below average, and here's why (I'm basing this on the one time I've been - maybe I just had a bad experience). The food is mediocre at best and it doesn't taste like anything special. All it does is fill you up. I came here after my boyfriend's friend recommended it. I did also check out the yelp reviews (but only looked at the rating at that time). We decided to give it a go for brunch on the weekend. From the outside, it looks like a tiny shop but it's big on the inside and we were seated promptly.  I was already disappointed when I walked in because I was misled to believe that it was Italian cuisine, but it was just an Asian-run Western-style restaurant. I didn't like the atmosphere inside (it was loud and felt like a dim sum restaurant). The decor was dated. There were crumbs on my table before I even sat down. No, they didn't bother wiping it. I had to wipe it off. The food was inexpensive and came in large portions in comparison to other brunch places. I personally could not finish my Eggs Benny.  The service was very \"meh\" and I suppose it was because they were quite busy as it was a weekend. My boyfriend and I both agreed that we never want to come back here, and had no idea why his work buddies raved about it."}
{"text":"I am not writing this on my latest visit. The latest visit was terrible but other visits were OK.  Location:  This restaurant is located on main Street Markham, not unionville. There's on street parking on both sides of the street but there's also plenty of parking behind the building.  This is a place we've come to every year before the Markham Santa clause parade, have been for almost 8 years.  Menu:  We normally get burgers and fries, kids have a pretty standard kids menu. Prices are great, food good, comes quick. It's a great combination.   Decor:  Decor is dated in the main part of the restaurant, but its fine.  What we got:  Last time we came was Saturday just before lunch. Decided to take advantage of the all day breakfast.  We chose the eggs Benedict. NEVER GET THE EGGS BENEDICT. It was really terrible, mushy, cold, the hollandaise sauce was not like ant I had before. We had to scrape it off and even then it was terrible. I would feel terrible not warning others!!  If this was a review of our last visit I'd have to say half a star."}
