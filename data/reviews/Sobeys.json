{"text":"Has improved over the last year.  Still needs better lighting as it always seems very dark.  

The pharmacy staff is better than any drugstore.  

The prepared food section is really good now especially because they now have organic roast chickens and their salads are revamped and delicious. I go there more often than whole foods or longos for prepared foods now."}
{"text":"I am not particularly fond of the Sobey's brand in general, but it is conveniently located in a plaza on a busy road. It is easy to access and there is ample parking. 

This location has been a grocery store for years and years, so it doesn't have the same modern touches as the newer locations, but it is always clean. 

There is a wide variety of hot and cold lunches. There's a sushi station with seating, freshly made pizza and everything from Chinese food to cabbage rolls to chicken fingers and fries. Their salads are alright. Nothing special. 

They have more recently added a housewares section where you can purchase everything from oven mits to place mats to pots and pans - predominantly Jamie Oliver.  

Their bulk section is almost non-existent. 

There doesn't seem to be a high turnover rate which is great from a customer service stand point. 

Their price point is slightly higher than the Food Basics or the No Frills of the world and I don't necessarily find they have any better selection of fruit and veggies. 

Overall a decent place to shop if you're in the immediate area, but I wouldn't go out of my way to go there."}
{"text":"I don't normally go to this store but since a few items I intended on buying were on sale I decided to switch things up.

I will NEVER make that mistake again. 

My experience was fine until I went to check out.  The cashier, Bev, was the rudest and most inconsiderate person I have ever come across. She completely turned me off of ever walking into that store again. 

From start to finish she was extremely rude. So much so that my daughter whispered to me, \"that lady is rude\". If a six year old is picking up on it, then what does that tell you? 

Perhaps, she was having a bad day or something I did rubbed her the wrong way but the instant I walked up to her till she had a very unfriendly demeanor towards me. 

It is not worth saving $5 on a $200 grocery bill to be treated like that."}
{"text":"As there's a distinct lack of restaurants within reasonable walking distance, my coworkers and I frequently find ourselves heading here to grab some lunch. The prepared foods section here is actually pretty good - nice selection of salads, sandwiches and wraps, some Chinese food, wings, chicken, potato wedges, etc. Quality is pretty good, and prices are not too bad. Avoid the already-baked pizza, though - it's not very good - and be sure to check the expiry date on the multi-pack of sandwiches.

Favourites: the fruit & yogurt parfait cups -about the same price as common fast food chains, but twice as big, your choice of three or four fruits, fresher and more granola. The garlic Parmesan rolls are also excellent.

The rest of the store is pretty standard for a suburban grocery store - maybe a little small compared to the rest of Oakville's stores, but roughly the same selection, just less out on the floor.

One last thing: service is pretty good. It's sometimes difficult to get your order across to the people at the prepared foods counter, but the cashiers are nice, and sometimes even appropriately cheeky.

(If the cashier remembers not only that you have the shoppers club card, but that she's the one who finally got you to sign up, and after approximately how long... does that mean you're going there too often?)"}
