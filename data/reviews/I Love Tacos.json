{"text":"Yummy and filling! Chips and salsa are delicious, great extra spices and salsa has a good kick! Kids portions are HUGE, good enough for 2 meals.  Ordered nachos to go, asked for chips on the sides so they wouldn't get soggy and the staff packed all ingredients separately - perfect. I'm going back and you should too!"}
{"text":"My fiancé and I had such high hopes for this place but were extremely disappointed. The service was very lacking (didn't get complimentary chips and salsa, waitress never came back or asked us if we needed refills on drinks, other tables who showed up after we did got served first). We also thought it was very unprofessional that there was a member of the staff (possibly the owner) walking around drinking beer in the open. I personally didn't mind this but people with kids might, the music selection was uncensored.  As far as the food goes, it was less than sub par. The flavors were very bland and the taco shells seemed stale. My fiancé got a chimichanga and, although it was very well filled, the flavors on the inside weren't anything special. I also thought that a restaurant called I Love Tacos would focus more on tacos instead of having only a few taco options that weren't executed very well.  Perhaps we caught the restaurant on a bad night or they might be working out kinks since they are fairly new to the area, but I hope this review is helpful to others and I wish the restaurant the best of luck."}
{"text":"The Burrito love was excellent. The chips and salsa were very tasty. Service was good. I hope to return the next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"I'm sorry, but this place was absolutely horrible. If you're a foodie and know what good food and tacos tastes like, YOU WILL BE DISAPPOINTED.  I went with family, so we had a group of 6 people and tried a lot of different items. We went on a Friday night. When we got there, we were seated immediately, but no one attended to us or took our drink order for about half an hour, which is when we finally asked someone to help us.   First we were brought chips and two salsas. The salsas tasted as though they were watered down to save money. Icky. The chips were seasoned very well and tasted good, which is why I am giving I Love Tacos 1 star.   We all ordered different things. Personally, I had the Cactus taco and a side of rice and beans. The cactus taco was horrible and not as described on the menu. The rice was dry and the beans were cold. I was not impressed. Everyone else did not enjoy their meals. They were cold, greasy, and lacking flavor. My friend ordered one of the sandwiches and the meat in it was quite odd looking and sketchy tasting. My dad has a couple of the signature tacos, including the Al Pastor, and thought they were flavorless and overcooked.  Our chips were not refilled without asking and kept needing to flag someone down to get service because our waiter was ignoring us.   We were all unsatisfied and 3 of us went to Culver's to get edible food afterwards.   I do not recommend I Love Tacos. Try Lalo's, another new Mexican place in Middleton on University Ave. I think you would be much more satisfied there."}
{"text":"So we went here for lunch today.  My first thought was that they do not love tacos at all.  Tacos should have lettuce, tomatoes, cheese, and sour cream.  The taco I had was not bad but was not what i was expecting. The salsa needs to be thicker than water as well.  However I had their watermelon water and it is awesome.  The service was great.  I may try one more time.  I really do love tacos and would love for this place to be good. I can walk there for lunch."}
{"text":"Not impressed, probably won't go back again.  Should have known from the goofy name wasn't going to be great.  Food wasn't bad, service pretty terrible."}
{"text":"Um... Wow! This place was in Madison Essentials magazine and we decided to be adventurous. They have just about every flavor of taco you can come up with. I had a pork and bacon taco, a mushroom and onion taco, and a beef taco. My wife had a mushroom and onion taco, gyro taco and a shredded chicken chipotle taco. It was excellent.   Be sure to ask about the condiment \"bar\" to have additional toppings.  We found the server to be very attentive and we were asked how we were enjoying our experience. Zero complaints at all. Total bill is just shy of $18. We are definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Lots of choices to select from. The young girl who attended to my order was very nice and helpful, offering her suggestions. The awful pop hip-hop Mexican music was almost enough to make me walk out before I even walked all the way in, but I was there for tacos, not to have a drink or eat-in.  I ordered a dozen tacos, 3-4 different types. The first flavor was beef, potato and jalapeño was my first choice, a couple Chicken Chipotle, and two others which were unmemorable enough to not recall even what they might have been filled with. Also wanting the general experience of more than just some tacos I requested some rice and beans. Hoping for whole pintos or perhaps black beans, but refried were all they offered.  In all, everything pretty much tasted like everything else. No seasoning whatsoever. No heat to the taco with the jalapeño, but most significantly was the overall absence of ANY salt. The rice was simply bland orangey yellow, with nothing added like green or red chili's and again, zero salt content. Heart healthy perhaps, but so little flavor it might as well have been Minute Rice cooked without salt or any butter, but stained yellow/orange. Even the red salsa which while tasteful was pureed making it at least not appealing to the eye. It at least contained a degree of spiciness, and the green salsa was a tad hotter than expected, but was also lacking the chunkiness that I personally associate with the way a salsa should be.  At $2.50(11) and $3.00(1) per taco the price wasn't terribly unreasonable ($30.50), but somehow my order totaled $54. Which leads me to conclude that the rice and beans was priced around $24. And that IS something I wish I had noticed earlier! I suspect the salsa's must have been upcharges, as well as the sides consisting of some lettuce, tomatoes, cheese, coriander and onions (all sides for the tacos which are served w/o anything but the meat filling).  The previous incarnations of this restaurants location were places I tried one time each, and opted to never bother to return (Fusion was the most recent, and service was so poor I never wanted to return for that reason alone. The Branch Street Retreat had food my neighbors dog refused the next day when I threw the leftovers his way.) I will probably return one more time in hopes that I might get a taco that the sign promises, since I myself also love tacos!"}
{"text":"Their burritos are fricken good.  Got a whole pitcher of rasberry margarita which was also really good.  If I were to make any changes, I would start with the creepy happy taco sign.  The inside is very spacious, would look better with some booth seats. Will go there again but probably for carry out."}
{"text":"The food here to me was ***/5 and the service was ****/5. The food was just OK to me - very average ; not bad - not amazing. It is in the \"American Style\" of mexican food so more along the lines of friendly for mainstream..not much like the very authentic places. We had no problems but didn't make many changes to our orders from what the menu already had."}
{"text":"My mom and I stopped by here for lunch, and it was good! I enjoyed the taco salad, and she liked her tacos. Our waitress was also very good. She was very attentive."}
{"text":"Tried the new place where the Branch Street Retreat used to be. Except for the terrible Mexican pop music the food and service is pretty good. My partner and I both had buritteos that were flavorful and fairly big. A white cheese sauce came on the side that didn't appeal to either of us but the homemade chips and salsa did. The side salad was very different and good as was the rice. We would give it another shot and maybe try the tacos next time. By that time maybe they will have their liquor license and toned down that music. Friendly waiter and cosy dining room."}
{"text":"The good: -excellent chips -good friendly service  -good prices  The ok -salsa was OK, not great, not terrible  The not great: -The tacos. I hate to say it but it just wasn't great. I got the pork taco and it was blah.  It was literally just some pork chunks with a slightly sweet but otherwise flavorless sauce on it. It had a lot of pork, don't get me wrong but it lacked flavor.  -they don't do a taco Tuesday.  What kind of place that calls itself \"I love tacos\" doesn't do a taco Tuesday? It's just wrong.    You would think that a place called I love tacos would make some crazy good tacos (example: Tex tubbs) but for my first visit it just wasn't the case. I'll probably try them one more time just in case I tried them on a bad day, but I don't have my hopes up."}
{"text":"Very unique flavors of tacos and nice menu overall.  I recommend the Kimberly and Al Pastor.  Service was very quick and friendly.  Give it a try..."}
{"text":"I still love tacos, but just not really impressed by these ones.  In Madison, especially the West side, there are better options available to you for this kind of fare (Los Gemelos, Laredo's). What I found odd here was that there just weren't that many people there during the lunch hour. The tacos themselves weren't that great, I had the steak, chicken, and gyro. The steak and chicken were both pretty dry, and the gyro was standard meat that you can get anywhere.  This wasn't the fault of the our waitress (who was really nice) but the food took almost 40 minutes to get out of the kitchen. The meat itself was easily diced up ahead of time, and we were the only customers there. 2 chefs were standing around as well when we ordered and didn't have any sense of urgency."}
{"text":"Meh, it's an up scale taco bell, still looks like bar on inside.  You get a small tray of chips when first seated.  Touchtunes and ATM by the door, at least 6 tvs. Had the Nachoes Primavera, incredibly plain, they may have went to taco bell and gotten it and up charged it.  Main course had the Arena Burrito, which came w/ some rice and lettuce w/ cheese and bacon in it.  Sour cream came in an individual small plastic cup on the side.  Arena Burrito definitely had better flavor to it primarily because of the peppers.  I'm just not impressed with anything they've done to the meat.  Larger than what you get Chipotle or Qdoba.  Size vaguely reminded me of La Bamba, but I haven't been there in 20 years.  Good, not sure it was $10 good.  Yeah, the bill total in the end just isn't worthy of something I picture college students going to on State Street."}
{"text":"Well we were very  disappointed.  Our food was microwaved.  It was easy to tell. There is no alcohol served in a bar setting.  If it's supposed to be a family style restaurant it has nothing to clue a customer in to that as far as atmosphere is concerned. We hoped this would finally be the restaurant that would hang on in this location  but now that we have tried it we are very skeptical that it will be there very much longer. We were also unimpressed with the yellow paint to the outside of what once was a pleasant looking Middleton building.  The sign outside and the McDonald's yellow paint cheapen the neighborhood. I can get better Mexican cuisine at 3 other locations within a 2 minute drive of this place. They will likely get customers for a while now that it's new and people want to try it out.  But after they try it most will have no reason to come back.  Our group actually discussed  how we won't be returning to I Love Tacos again.  Not a good thing."}
{"text":"I strongly recommend this place. Excellent food and service. Now I've only stopped in for lunch but I'll be back for more. Prices a pretty reasonable too. Extensive menu, not just tacos."}
{"text":"Tacos here are  excellent. Try the firecracker shrimp. Wow! A hidden gem. Atmosphere is not fancy but food is unique delicious and very economical. Glad we stopped in."}
{"text":"So I've been very excited for this new option to open in Middleton and finally had a chance to give it a try. Needless to say I'm pretty disappointed so far. The biggest problem is that the food is really bland. I didn't feel like anything was properly seasoned and spice was missing from pretty much every dish. By far the best thing I tried was the taco loco with potato and chorizo. That at least had a little depth of flavor (although could have been improved VASTLY by just a touch of sour cream and maybe cilantro).   I'm not trying to be harsh here, I genuinely hope the cooks/owners decide to get a little more adventurous! I imagine they're serving tempered down Mexican in an attempt to please a Midwest palate. I think this is a losing proposition. Boring food is just that, boring, no matter what flavor profile you wrap around it. Guys, give us a little spice, a little salt, a little citrus, a little SOMETHING! A grilled chicken taco must be more than cubed up boneless, skinless chicken breast in a tortilla!!!  I have every intention of trying I Love Tacos at least once more (I WANT it to work) but if my next experience is not significantly better that will be the end. I'd hate to see yet another venture fail in this location..."}
{"text":"Went here shortly after it opened. There had been a bit of hype, so I was pretty excited. There was no sign (I believe there is one now, though), nothing on the outside of the building that made it look friendly and inviting, not even in the windows. The atmosphere was awful. No music played, and it was obvious that they didn't remodel at all from when it was the BSR bar, as it looked exactly the same. I was hoping they would at least put up some decorations to make it not so cold on the inside as well as the outside. The chips and salsa were pretty good, and the tacos were fantastic. However, my husband is vegan, and there was only one taco he could eat; there were no vegan options other than that, not even for salads or burritos. For me, I can't have red meat and dairy due to intestinal issues, but I'm not vegan. However, even with a wider range of foods I CAN eat, there was still only three kinds of things I could eat there. I won't be going back here until they revamp their menu and add more vegetarian/vegan friendly options, and even if they do, I won't consider sitting in for a meal in such a cold, unfriendly, weird atmosphere."}
{"text":"We went a few months ago and didn't have a great experience. First off, aside from the orange windows and corny logo, the interior is as bland as possible and hard to tell you are in a Mexican restaurant.   Most importantly, they lack attention to details in things that matter: the food. I ordered one of the tacos and asked for no onions. It came with onions and was missing the bacon. I explained what happened and the waitress repeated back to me the ingredients I wanted just to make sure. A few minutes later, I was served another taco with onions, but it had bacon...which was barely cooked. No quality control at all. I finally just asked for the tacos my wife ordered. They were ok. She apologized and said the manager is sorry and gave me two free drink tickets for next time. We haven't been back of course.  PS: Middleton is misspelled on the front of their menu. Details, details..."}
{"text":"Go there, go there!  You should try it at least once.  The food is what makes this place stand out from the rest.  There is a great selection of dishes and plenty of space for large groups.  Unfortunately, they lack beer on tap but the do have a variety of bottles.   Recommended for any mid week dinner when you don't want to cook."}
{"text":"Pretty awful. The taco selection is OK, but the actual execution is poor. Definitely lots of processed meats and under seasoned ingredients used here. This restaurant appears to come across as authentic, yet the shells are all flour and all of the toppings are Americanized - tomatoes and shredded lettuce, I had to ask for cilantro and onion. Homemade chips are boring and greasy, not sure if the salsa served with them are made in house, but its tasted fairly standard. Wont be back, there are to many other good taco options in the area."}
