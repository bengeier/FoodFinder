{"text":"i only ordered 3 whole  chickens here..but the flavour was good. This location has the best pricinf compared to all the other portuguese chickens out there. its $12 for a whole chicke . I come here when i nees to order for a partt. I have yet to try rhe rice and potatoes.. it does look authentic portugues..but just the chicken alone was full of flavour..abd was a good amount. Ive bought other places and seemed to get less chicken and pay a bit more. I love how they have individual partt prices and prepackaged. makes it easier to order. I will update once i try the rice and chicken. I think its great for budget parties."}
{"text":"Best chicken  house in town  Freindly staff. Potatoes were done to perfection  Crispy chicken moist and not dry at all  These people must be Portuguese as they know how to grill chicken best. Keep up the good work"}
{"text":"I love Portuguese chicken but I didn't want to go to a Chain restaurant. So I started searching on yelp and stumbled upon this place 10min away from my house. First time I came here I ordered the family pack for 15ppl I paid $88 plus tax and it was a huge amount of food and we had left overs! It was amazing! The second order I made was the party package 2 which is for 40-50ppl. Again the chicken rice and potatoes was a hit and everyone loved it! Price and amount of food amazing! I won't stop doing my catering here. The ladies that cook the food are also very very lovely ladies. Great job guys!! This is a hidden gem."}
