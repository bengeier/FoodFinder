{"text":"This was my first visit since this location changed hands.  Although still not the best Mexican food I've ever had,  it offers a different variety of dishes on its menu from other Chambana staples.   I had the Chori Pollo, which was delicious!  

The staff was friendly and attentive, even though we were a large group.  The restaurant was much busier than whatever was here before - a good sign."}
{"text":"Mmm. This place is yummy. I love my Mexican Food, and this place treats both my stomach and wallet just right. I get dizzy just stepping into this place for my stomach takes over control and I can't wait to be seated to start munching on chips and salsa. Of course this is just the start as the food selection is a wonderful assortment even though I tend to just get the Enchilada Verde, or Burrito Verde. What makes this delicious is not only the fact that the Verde sauce is great, but that the beans come spiced with the life that my tongue craves (Dinner menu only it seems, lunch not so spicy). I do not come here to have mild food. This place gives me that spice that I must have! So take note that if you can't withstand spicy or hot foods this may not be your best place to eat, yet if you want to live it up a little than by all means make the stop. 

We have tried other Mexican restaurants in town but none have really come up to the quality and expectations that Guadalajara has shown us."}
{"text":"I've only been there once - but the bf and I were very impressed with the place!!  The food was great - much better than any other Mexican restaurants in the area! I ordered one of the enchilada plates (where you get 4 or 5 enchiladas, one from each meat) and mixed both the red and cheese sauces on top - yummy.  The red sauce was unlike any I've had in the area, with subtle flavors of cinnamon and other spices.  While I don't know if this is traditionally Mexican, it tasted much more authentic than other red sauces I have had.  The bf ordered the shrimp chimichanga (which actually came with two) -and he loved them.  Again, he felt it tasted more authentic than other places.  

The proportions were large - we each took half of our meals home.  The waiter was very friendly and speedy - although that is pretty typical of Mexican restaurants.  The margaritas (I had traditional and the bf had a frozen banana one) were really good.  

I'm back and forth between giving it 4 or 5 stars...I really wish I could give it 4.5 stars!  Since I've only been here once, I'm going to give it 4 stars.  If when I go back it impresses me again, I will raise my review up to 5 stars! :)"}
{"text":"Great food! However, their portions are big so be prepared to stuff yourself or take some leftovers home! We will be back :)"}
{"text":"So, I wanted to go to Thara Thai, but the owners have closed it for a week.  My friend Liz and I were starving, and Real Hacienda was next door.

First off--Real Hacienda?  As in the other ones are fake?  Or this one is Royal?  I don't know.

The ambiance is....different.  It's got some cute, gaudily painted chairs that belong in a Loteria game, and the booths were comfily familiar to any other C-U area Mexican establishment.

However, the food was pretty good.  It was a step up from Dos Reales, and a little under El Toro.  The servers were friendly and attentive, and it was a place where, perhaps because it was relatively empty that night, you coudl just chat, en espanol, with the serve staff, and with your friend and pretend you lived in Southern California.

Fun times."}
{"text":"Good typical Mexican food. Not the best, but a great value. The salsa was just ok. I got the tamales, and it's a crazy amount! I just wish they were a little more moist. The cheese sauce with it made it better."}
{"text":"Sad to say that since this place went from being \"Real Hacienda\" to \"Guadalajara\" it's gone downhill quite a bit. I believe it is under completely new management and the staff has been totally changed. One of my favorite Mexican places has been replaced by a middling one. Whereas the flavors used to have a unique twist I could never quite place, everything now tastes the same as any other Mexican restaurant. The chips used to be warm and fresh, and now taste sort of stale. The cheese dip arrives as a barely penetrable block. The staff used to be really friendly and fast. Now... not so much. This is by no means awful but considering that \"Real Hacienda\" was so good... it's hard for it to not suffer in comparison."}
{"text":"So I came here with my roommates one Thursday evening for dinner and overall, it was a pleasant experience.  I enjoyed the colorful atmosphere as well as the very attentive service.  One of the things I enjoyed were the drink specials.  For two dollars, you can get a 12 oz. margarita which was prepared very well.  They had other drink specials each day during the week which also looked very enticing.  The food was okay, it wasn't anything really worth making a fuss over.  I'll will just say that the portions were really good, reasonably priced, but not as tasty as I wanted.  Overall, its a place definitely worth going to."}
{"text":"CLOSED. No big loss either -- just run-of-the-mill gringo-Mexican food and cheap margaritas made with cheap tequila and cheap bottle-mixer. Nothing distinguished this place from the thousands of other run-of-the-mill gringo-Mexican places across the region and the country."}
{"text":"Great mexican food, large portions, and right now during the winter, the chicken soup that comes out at the same time as the tortilla chips is a real winner and welcome warm-up."}
{"text":"I'm pretty sure this place is closed. After reading the yelp reviews my boyfriend and I were super excited to try it out but we drove up and there were no signs of life, so sad day. Should the status on yelp be changed to closed?"}
{"text":"I love this place!  As a vegetarian, I have to question authentic Mexican food because I always find little pieces of meat in my food, but I have never had this problem at Guadalajara Bar & Grill.  I order my own combination: two cheese enchiladas and a crispy taco with refried beans.  The food is delicious.  The taco is served on a separate plate so it does not get soggy from the enchilada sauce on the plate.  There usually is a special of 2 combination plates for $11 so the food ends up being really cheap if I go with someone else."}
{"text":"I've never been to Real Hacienda once when there wasn't at least 1 unhygienic, wart covered, sweatpant wearing, bald, sweaty individual chowing down on a 3 foot long burrito.  

The ambience is one in which an unhygienic, sweatpant wearing burrito chower does not look at all out of place.  The restroom aroma penetrates the tackily painted dining area.

The food is dead cheap.  Because it is entirely comprised of flour, beans, and this bizarre white cheddar cheese sauce that is neither animal nor vegetable nor mineral (unless saturated fat is a mineral.)

Since Dos Reales and Fiesta Cafe are both priced in the same range, serve identically the same menu, are no more crowded, and are miles and miles closer to civilization, I don't really see the point of trekking out to Bloomington Road for Real Hacienda."}
