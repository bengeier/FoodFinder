{"text":"Very tasty Chargha, chicken kabobs, nihari, daal gosht serve with rice, and good hot food! I liked food here very much as customer service quick.
Restaurant has good space to sit and hope you enjoy food here too."}
{"text":"I have had the chicken tika roll here a few times and it never disappoints. I first came here because Lahore tikka is expensive, slow and food is hit or miss and on top of that you have to sit on plastic chairs. This place is not very classy either but way better than their neighbors. The tikka roll is always good. Servers don't talk a lot or greet you with a happy face but the food is what matters and I really enjoy it. I wish I lived closer, would come here more often if I did."}
{"text":"Decent place in little India to stock up on Pakistan food after a night of indulging. We had tandoori skewers, some sort of daal and some naan. My memories of the food are a bit hazy because of the time of night but seemed decent."}
{"text":"The place had enough space to fit our group of 16. The food was also good. Service was great. We were really taken care of. Would recommend it. I will return for sure."}
{"text":"Do not attempt to eat here. A few of my buddies and I decided to eat here since Lahore Tikka House was closed. From the moment we walked in it was a bad experience. Our order was not taken until after 20 minutes of arrival. Have not even tried the food here, because we were waiting for 1 and a half hour for the food and when it finally came out, the server told us that they ran out of the nihari we ordered and replaced it with lamb karahi. We asked him if they are going to charge us for the lamb karahi and he said it is the same price for the nihari. We said we don't want the lamb karahi and he rudely told us to put it back on the tray so he could take it back. The point of no return was when we saw the portion size of the butter chicken. It was really small. We left and explained to the server why we are leaving. I'm not sure if this was just a bad day from them but wanted to share our experience."}
