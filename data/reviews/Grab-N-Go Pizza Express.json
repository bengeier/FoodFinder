{"text":"Great pizza at an even better price. Salad was very fresh and pizza was delicious. Great experience."}
{"text":"Great pizza at a great price. It's cheap and close to home they also have really good sides as well. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Always great-I usually pre order online and then pick it up. Can't beat the prices. Also, they're always really fair. One time, it had to wait 15 minutes, because they were super busy, so they gave me their pizza for free..can't beat that!"}
{"text":"We love this place. You cannot get a better pizza for the price. The ladies that work in there are always polite and have good aditudes."}
{"text":"Beats any big chain $5 pizza place around. Tastes like a $20 pizza but it's only $5. Try this place you won't be disappointed. Sorry I've lived here for a year before I tried it."}
{"text":"My husband and I used to order from here more than I'd like to admit (almost weekly). The pizza is pretty mediocre, but it's really cheap and convenient. The cheesy bread, subs, chicken fingers, and onion rings are pretty delicious. We always order online (which I love), it's right around the corner, delivery is always under 45 minutes (yes, we're that lazy and really hate winter), and the delivery people are always super nice. Sadly, they had to go and screw up the good thing we had going. 

Last time we ordered it was for pick-up as 20 years of junk food ordering has taught me pick-up to takes half the time of delivery. We ordered cheesy bread, a Philly sub, and onion rings. I asked for ranch instead of marinara with the cheesy bread and requested ranch for the onion rings.

I paid in advance and added a 20% tip (on take-out) thinking that would help make up for any \"inconvenience\" or cost of my ranch requests (we ordered the exact same thing for delivery the previous time with absolutely no problem, by the way). My husband showed up about 20 minutes after I ordered. Not only wasn't the food ready, but apparently they hadn't even started it and were in no hurry. He waited almost another HOUR (seriously--from ordering til he got home was an hour fifteen and it's about a one minute drive) to get our food. They didn't comp or discount or offer any vouchers or coupons or anything. 

When we opened our food there were no sauces of any kind. I'd waited a long time and was starving and pretty pissed about this oversight after all that. I hopped in the car because, as I said, it's literally around the corner, and junk food just ain't the same without ranch for dippin. 

I walked in. Everyone was in the kitchen (no one at the counter), but I was clearly seen, though nobody shouted a greeting or \"I'll be right with you.\" Finally a girl walked toward the front, though again not at a speed that anyone in the restaurant business should use. I told her my husband had just waited a ridiculously long time for our take-out order and when he got home there were no sauces, could I just have like six containers of ranch that we should have gotten with our order. Now that may have been an excessive amount, but I had low blood sugar brain. And at this point I figured they'd throw anything at me to appease a dissatisfied customer (because they'd screwed up!). Instead, she looked at the computer and said she needed to get the person who took the order. Why? I have no idea. But she said she was new, so I said fine. She went in to the kitchen to tell another girl who dropped what she was doing to go tell an older man, who I assume is the owner, most certainly the boss. Expecting him to greet me with a smile and an apology, or at least a how can I help you, I was taken aback to get a brusk questioning of who I was and what I ordered. He also needed to look it up on the computer for some godforsaken reason. It was like they all had amnesia! You don't remember the tall skinny dude who JUST left after waiting for his order for an hour?! He told me what I ordered like I was on crack and what was the problem. I said yes, I know what I ordered, but I requested ranch, and even added a generous tip in case he wanted to charge me for it. Again, he rudely asked me how many I wanted, incredulous I was asking. It was like the freakin inquisition. Do they have a problem with ranch robberies??? Are people always walking in and making up stories about how they didn't get ranch with their orders?? He started taking containers out of the fridge. I was so upset by this point that I don't even know what he said that prompted me say \"Wow, you are really something else.\" There were four containers of ranch on the counter which I snatched while I could and turned around to walk out, at which point he yelled after me how they're 75 cents a piece. I may have muttered something in return as the door was closing behind me. 

I honestly think this was the most disrespectful customer service I have ever received. It certainly tops the list as worst interaction/confrontation with a stranger. I can't believe anyone would treat or talk to anyone like that, let alone a proprietor to a customer. I worked in a restaurant for seven years and one of the cardinal rules is own up and apologize when you make a mistake--99% of the time people will completely understand. Offer them a discount or a freebie and the mistake is completely forgotten.

I realize no one cares or will ever read this. My husband has already chastised me for wasting my energy on it, but I was just so incredulous about the entire thing. It was cathartic. I feel better. Though that will be of little comfort next time I want cheesy bread (with ranch!) and have to order elsewhere."}
{"text":"Food over all was ok. I tried the shrimp basket and it was not all that at all. My order came with steak fries which I hate and they were not done all the way, my shrimp were under and over cooked and the close slaw was not good at all. The whole over all presentation was horrible you can tell it was just thrown together . I was excited to try this please seeing I was planning on ordering my daughters birthday food from here but after this I think I'm going to look other places."}
{"text":"Love there pizza! Cheap and good! Most of the time it's fresh. Sometimes its not very consistent, pizza looks different , less cheese less sauce ect. Pizza,cheese sticks and a pop delivered for 13.49! Awesome! I cant really complain. Don't forget to tip your driver."}
{"text":"Good for cheap pizza, customer service is crap. I ordered online with no estimated pick up time during what I'd assume is dinner rush (5:30-6:30)? About 45 min after I ordered I got a sassy phone call saying our pizza has \"been ready\". Guess  I was the only order that night? My boyfriend was on his way over there to pick up. When he got there they even gave him rude comments about taking too long to pick it up and asked him to pay EVEN THOUGH I PAID ONLINE ALREADY. They have no idea what's going on."}
{"text":"YESSSS THANK YOU $3.99, 1 topping, 14 inch pizza! 8 beautiful slices of you will feed me for approximately 4 days. Grab-n-Go Pizza is exactly as advertised. Wait time was under five minutes. There's no place to eat there, but you can sit in the window and wait and/or partake in their very classy claw crane vending machine They sell other things like... cookies, but if you're there you're probably there for the $3.99 pizza. Don't think, just Grab-n-Go!"}
{"text":"Grab & Go is a take out pizza place in Lakewood.  The pizzas are good, especially for the price that you pay.  I got a Large Mushroom Pizza for $4, which is as good a deal as you can find in this area.

The pizza is a nice pie overall, well cooked.  The crust is medium thick with a crispy outside and soft inside.  The sauce is has a ripe tomato flavor, my personal preference would be for a bit more spice, but the sauce if flavorful.  The cheese is nice with enough chew to be fulfilling and was perfectly melted.

Grab & Go makes a very nice example of the Cleveland style pizza, probably not worth going out of your way for, but if you want a good pizza at a great price you should really consider giving them a try."}
{"text":"I gave this 5 stars because I truly have nothing negative to say and I feel it's a bit underrated.   The food is good, not mind blowing, and the price is great.  Tasty crust, generous toppings, sauce is acceptable, calzones are a deal at $6 each - they're roughly a large pizza folded in half.  However, do NOT expect a place where you can \"grab and go\" in the style of the 'hot and ready' joints.  This is a small, storefront take out pizza place and everything appears to be cooked to order.  Tiny complaint:  I wish they offered red onions."}
{"text":"This is my  go to pizza place its one block away and I  can get a pizza for $4. I really like this pizza but its definitely not the best in town however the price makes it one of the best deals u get. Every now and then I will get a so so pizza and even then its worth $4. The Wings at pretty good too."}
{"text":"I love this place! I own a store across the street and have been ordering from here for over a year now. They are just the nicest people with great food and even better prices! I have never been disappointed. If there is ever a problem they always make it right"}
{"text":"Place is like the Nick Nolte of pizza places, not exactly what you were looking for but will work in a pinch.  Its fast, cheap and super close to the crib.  Even after I finish my second bottle of Manischewitz I can still make it there for a sausage pie.  I think Angelos is a rip-off and this place is the other extreme so I tend to pick something in between the two like Papa Nicks or Roman Fountain.  But, like I said...it will do when Im getting my groove on with some kosher wine and Heavy D tapes in my Walkman..."}
{"text":"This pizza its awesome and cheap and they deliver. It cant get any better than this. I highly recomend"}
{"text":"My bf and I love love love this place!! We eat here all the time due it being so inexpensive and good!! They have a great deal for 2 large 2 topping pizzas for only 11.99!!! You just can't beat that!! I can't say enough good things about this place!! The staff is so friendly and fast!! you can order and be done in 15 minutes!! It is great place for the value!!I If you don't believe me, just see for yourself."}
{"text":"This place seems to be pretty good at making pizza and very bad at math. $3.99 for a decent pizza?"}
{"text":"I like the pizza but the customer service is the worst!! This is the second time they messed up my order and it's never just grab n'go there is always a wait of at least 20 minutes. Today one of the workers gave me attitude because they didn't look to see my online order so I had I wait for them to make the pizzas...of course they blamed the computer but all they had to do is check the computer every once and a while instead of standing in the back chatting away...then the pizza toppings were wrong...then they act like they couldn't hear me giving them my credit card number so they could give me a refund for the inconvenience even though I was standing right next to them! I had to write be number down for them, what a joke! It really can't be that complicated making pizza! Never going back..also the place is filthy! Just have a look around...I'm a bit embarrassed that I ever ordered from there in the first place! The low price just isn't worth the horrible customer service."}
{"text":"Pizza is really good for being so cheap! Price is great! Also they are very accommodating as they will still deliver to us in Cleveland as long as they aren't super busy despite us being just outside their delivery zone if we call and ask :) Overall would recommend!"}
