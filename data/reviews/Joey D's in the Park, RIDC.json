{"text":"A very surprising find.  Really great selection of food.  I've eaten there 3 times so far and haven't been disappointed yet.  Highly recommend the margherita pizza!"}
{"text":"Great food and service! Here for work and was pleasantly surprised at restaurant food choices. Wings are great, not greasy and very tasty! The pizza is hand tossed.  They have specials every day for lunch and dinner. The staff is awesome.  Rebecca and Marina at Joey D's are fabulous!  Will definitely come back! The hotel looks old but give it a chance!"}
{"text":"I love this place! This is one of the best places in the area to sneak away from large crowds yet still have fun. They have so many TV's that regardless where you sit, you still have a view at a TV for the Pens & Pirates game! The kitchen has very reasonable priced daily specials too. Jason and his crew are doing a great job since they have moved to their new location."}
{"text":"Nice little sports bar with great food.  Seriously, Jason and his crew serve up some outstanding choices.  The pizza is fantastic, chewy crust baked just right with slightly charred bubbles on top.... I've had top rated pizza all over the U.S., including New York and this holds its own.  Great sandwiches, soups and good beer choices.  If you haven't, try this place for the food."}
{"text":"So, so good!

We were here several times during our stay and I was very impressed with the food.  Steak dinner, daily special of a stuffed pork chop with mashed potatoes, prime rib dip, heavy pour on the cocktails-all excellent!  VERY good service even though they are obviously understaffed.  Our first night, there were probably 40 hungry and thirsty people watching the Steelers' game and only one waitress.   She was incredibly patient and the food was spectacular for a hotel pub.  All that equals 5 stars in my traveling heart.  Bravo!!

HIRE MORE STAFF!!!"}
