{"text":"A lame ghetto convenient store where I can't even get out of my car without someone either wanting money for hard drugs or to engage in a physical altercation with me. I'd highly suggest packing heat if you intend on going to this store. The 85 cent fountain drinks make up 100% of this store's redeeming qualities. Get rid of that and I'd take my business to a store that isn't located in the hood. There's also this old bitch that chainsmokes and looks like a female version of Rodney Dangerfield that always follows me around the store. I'm the least threatening hispanic person and there's fellow Mexicans in the store with facial tats but I get followed. Fack this place. Don't park your bike here either because it WILL get stolen."}
{"text":"I always get my gas here, seems to be the most cheapest place by my house, plus I like that they have a water machine outside."}
{"text":"This K is sadly dirty especially floors . Some one needs to teach how to mop:(( The plus everyone is friendly :)"}
{"text":"This Circle K gets five stars simply because of it's proximity to the rental car center near CLE. I don't care about the prices or the friendly or not so friendly staff, the cleanliness of the store, the restrooms or if the coffee is good or if it's horrible I seriously doubt I will ever walk through the doors - I'm here to fuel up period..."}
{"text":"Air pump works, hot dogs and jalapeño sausages. Great Circle K electronic air pump $1.50. I was feeling a little puckish. Grabbed a large hot dog and jalapeño dog  and downed it with sauerkraut. That was allowed in my low carb diet. Dinner for $2.70. Not bad at all!"}
{"text":"Last visit I was approached no less than 3 times by meth addicts and other assorted vagrants PANHANDLING before I even got in the store. The line was halfway to the back of the store and moving slowly. I left without anything I came for.  I'll choose another location or one of the 5000 other convenience stores and gas stations in town until they clean up the area."}
{"text":"I really like this location. It's clean and organized. The layout is good as well. It's larger then the majority of locations. That means more pumps and more concessions available inside. The polar pops are very popular. You can't beat their price for the value. They have a lot of hot items as well.   They have been doing deals with different combinations of drinks and snacks that are pretty good. It's nice to save a bit if you are going to buy them anyway.  The employees that I have interacted with have been welcoming. I used to come here every day for awhile and they knew me by name. Had to get my morning coffee!  This area has been really developing. There is a good amount of parking if you just wanted to get something front inside and your not getting gas."}
{"text":"The main reason I go here is because they have 69 cent Polar Pop Fountain drinks.The place has a new beer cave but the rest of the place needs updating.The place is popular for lottery,Black&Milds,Beer.The staff is nice but its the typical Sandusky working crowd that goes there.The place serves it purpose 4 me for Polar Pops.If you don't like diversity or wierdos go somewhere else"}
{"text":"Brand new, very nice.  Came in for snacks. Selection isn't huge, but they have a lot of drinks. Had a few options for me, grabbed some food and headed out. Very clean, well organized, and decent prices. They also have a well organized lot and fuel pumps, lane markings for driving, a car wash, and overall is very fresh and clean. Hope it stays this way!  They missed a star because of customer service. They weren't rude, no where near the worse, but even a hint of cracking a smile, or speaking to me first, or greeting would have been nice. After I spoke to her she was fine, but not the most ambitious."}
{"text":"This Circle K is conveniently located for anyone staying at the nearby Hilton Garden Inn Cleveland Airport location - a hotel I often stay at for work.  I come in here to pick up extra bottled water, V-8 juice, and snacks to take back the hotel.  There is an ATM inside, as well as a BP gas station attached to the Circle K (the BP has a drive-thru car wash as well). There is also a Burger King next door.  Service has always been prompt.  #CircleK"}
{"text":"Clean and large location.  Easy access to the loop 101.  Plenty of fuel pumps to get you in and out. RedBox location too which is always a plus. Highly recommend since it's rare to find a spacious and well cared for service station. Large variety of snacks and drinks with the \"Beer Cave.\""}
