{"text":"For a great price, these guys gave me the best website for my business. They were great to work with and were able to position me with the ability to tap into a wider market online. These guys are some of the best available and have a true passion for their work. When it comes to web design I wouldn't recommend anyone else."}
{"text":"Going to keep this as short as I can.  July 20, 2009 - Contacted Innate about a potential gaming website. We liked the ideas and how Innate was going to fill out scheduled timeline. Innate - \"we estimate your project will take roughly 1.5 to 2 months to complete\". Very excited that Innate was going to be able to help us finish well before December when we needed to be up by.  August 7, 2009 - Paid Innate the down payment for building the website, around $1000.  September 30, 2009 - Innate says \"The website is nearly completed and we ask that you begin to test out the features to make sure everything is working properly. I talked to the coder and he said by the end of this week we should be ready for launch.\" -Great we are on schedule.  -2 weeks pass and no updates and we are told the website is not finished. Several emails are left without any replies.  October 12, 2009 - Innate says \"The website is completed and we just need your web hosting information to install the website.\"   October 13, 2009 - Innate asks for the final payment before showing us the final product. We need to see the product before we pay in full.  November 13, 2009 - I stupidly make the final payment for the \"completed\" website.   November 30, 2009 - Website is finally uploaded to our servers. Several errors occur. Various links do not work, many functions on the website do not work, fonts are in different sizes, images are distorted.   December 09 to March '10 - We have to work with Will Webb and the rest of Innate on fixing a wide variety of problems on the website. Many of these errors were basic errors that simple testing or sampling of the website would have fixed if Will tested it himself. Needless to say we missed our goal of having a December launch by over 3 months.  Very poor communication and lack of professionalism from Will Webb and his team or lack thereof.   ETA of completion from Innate = 1.5 - 2 months Actual time of completion = 7 months with errors still occurring"}
{"text":"I've used Innate Media Group several times over the years - Will Webb and Michelle and the team are good and generally speaking, they're almost always available on phone or email when you want to make changes. We've worked together on a few projects starting in 2008 - sites I outlined and they built including two business websites and one complicated contest media site that was very well done.  IMG is great for banging out good websites fast and the system that Will has built works best when you can provide logos, pictures and text and keep and eye . I still use em whenever I can."}
