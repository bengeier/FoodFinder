{"text":"The wings use to AWESOME! The two times including tonight the wings are horrible.  Small and over cooked. Vegetable Platter, same, use to be tons of awesome mushrooms, carrots, tomato,  broccoli. Now you get maybe 5 mushrooms,  4 or 5 slices of carrots and the last time the broccoli was shimmy.  Use to be a great place. Now not so much."}
{"text":"This place is beyond HORRIBLE WITH SERVICE .... we asked how late they were open not any of the 4 girls behind the counter knew what their hours for service were also we sat at the bar area for 15mins.. not one single worker acknowledged our presence so we walked off ....this is not the first, second nor third time with the same bs ..... RIDICULOUS!!!! I GIVE IT A NEGATIVE 0"}
{"text":"First time at this restaurant.  Large menu.  We had thin crust pizza and wings, both of which were excellent.  Service was great.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Today was my third time to tailgaters and if I can give them 10 stars I would. The service was GREAT, today I was craving chicken wings but I decided to get a baked Italian sub. It was quite possibly one of the best sandwiches I have ever had in my life. The one thing I can remember about that sandwich is the cheese all over the tomato and the meat being perfectly proportioned. Too many times I have gone places and got a Italian sub and it was not good. This place has an amazing sandwich. I have already tried the pizza and the chicken wings and I have also had the Philli chz steak sandwich. . I will be back more than often. Thank you for the lunch today and thank you for filling my belly earlier this weekend.. The server Dan is super hot by the way. I saw him sitting down in regular clothes today eating. I wanted to ask him for his opinion on my beer but I didn't want to seem like a weirdo. I will come in again and hopefully he is working and I can ask him next time"}
{"text":"We stopped for lunch last Tuesday. I ordered Sliders and my wife ordered the French Dip. The sliders were next to inedible, the meat??? obviously had been cooked earlier and was cold. I was able to choke down 2 with plenty of water, My wife's French Dip was inedible. The meat, nor sure what it was, beef or roadkill, was over cooked and dry and no amount of the purported Au Jus would soften it . Speaking of the Aus Jus, it was tasteless. With waitress reminding us how she liked the AUs Jus because it wasn't loaded with sodium it was a horror story.  On the good side the wait staff was excellent!"}
{"text":"Ordered shrimp basket and was dry and gross looking as were the wings.  The Blt was tiny and not toasted.  Hardly any fries came with the order.  Fairly new restaurant.  Obviously not trying to impress."}
{"text":"We have eaten at tailgaters several times and enjoy the food, mostly the cheese curds. Tonites cheese steak order with extra cheese came with no cheese which we didn't discover until we got home. Even though we live well outside the delivery area the manager brought a new sandwich to our home. Strong customer service can fix just about any mistake."}
{"text":"Enjoyed my first visit to Tailgators on Lake Pleasant Blvd!  Clean restaurant, attentive staff, and favorable drink prices.  Great place to watch a ballgame. I will be back!"}
{"text":"This was not one of my better experiences   Was truly disappointed in the sliders. Server should ask customer how they want the meat cooked so you don't get hockey pucks. Now I know produce isn't cheap but when I asked for lettuce, tomato and onions for the sliders the three little pieces of lettuce two little thin half slices of tomato and one small piece of onion made me wonder if this place might be going overboard in cutting cost. We had started off with nachos which were good but the two plates we were given were dirty and had to be sent back. The fly buzzing around and fighting us for the nachos wasn't an invited guest but seemed to think it was.The manager did stop by the table but i feel Tailgaters needs to have a training class in how to handle situations better. Would have to think about going back as there are better places in this area."}
{"text":"We have always ordered to go from here since we have heard nothing but horrible things about the service. This weekend we decided to see it for ourselves and they were spot on. It took 20 minutes after sitting down before someone took our drink order and 45 minutes before the waitress took our food order. The waitress was training someone who was way more attentive than she was, maybe he should've been training her. A few guys came in after us and complained about the wait for someone to take their drink order and the manager just said to them \"well I only have 1 waitress\". Can't believe they had 1 waitress for the whole place on a busy Saturday. Food is good but service is awful!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few time and have had great service every time! Love the Wings and the pizza is good also! Definitely one of our go to spots now!"}
{"text":"We had a \"watch party\" with about 50 fans of North Dakota State football, and the Tailgaters staff did a great job for us.  Great selection of apps and beers and the wait staff really hustled.  Very happy with everything!"}
{"text":"Great Sports bar.  Beer list is impressive.  Wait staff are super friendly. Food is great. Lots of tvs.  This area needed this place."}
{"text":"Went there with friends Yummy boneless chicken wings ! Nice to have a good sports bar near by Happy hour prices at lunch ! Service was attentive and fine with suggestions and clarification when we asked Lots of friendly people  Better experience than my times to Creek next door  We will be back and are telling others"}
{"text":"Great food and great service. Prices are reasonable and the beer is cold. What's not to like? Great selection of microbeers on draft."}
{"text":"My friends and I have mow been here 3 times each time hoping that the experience will improve and each time we have been left wanting.  Lets go over the food for the most part the food is what you would expect form this type of establishment its good but not something you would drive out of the way for and when the food is less then good its not because of its preparation it because of the service.   The service even though this time they had a very good hostess she knows how to smile,  beyond that the service was lacking.  I seemed almost a bother to request another drink.   The boneless buffalo wing were soggy this is normally abecause they sat on the counter way longer then the should of.  One member of our group got her food so late that we all were finished with our food, even though none of or food came out at the same time.   There is no management' presence checking on the customers satisfaction this would be an improvement that this place really needs this way you can see what servers are giving off the less then helping vibe and may make the customer feel like you really want their business.  This is a convenient location but I would drive out of my way for the same type of food and better service.  The pricing is not good for the service delivered and the food does not support the pricing so in the end if you are a customer you are at a loss.  We may give it another chance but there are other options in our area maybe not with as many TVs but again if the service is not good then who care what game is on"}
{"text":"Just walked out after sitting at bar and being ignored for 10 minutes.  This place had excellent service when it opened, but I have found the service average, at best, since, especially at bar....and especially during the day, which is when I usually go.  I don't get it.....ignored for 10 minutes when bar was half occupied!!??"}
{"text":"I just recently visited, for the second time, and was extremely disappointed! I should have known since our first visit was a similar experience! The service was terrible! The food took for ever to get and we rarely saw our server. This was a group of 11 and we will not be going back again! I would NOT recommend this restaurant to anyone and either will the other 10 people that attended. Don't waist your time!!!!"}
{"text":"Wings, pizza, all the food is amazing! Best customer service, and all around great place to hang out and catch a game."}
{"text":"Great location and fair prices but where do I begin.  I've been working in the restaurant industry for almost 30 years so I'm very understanding of the challenges and rarely give negative feedback - but - this location is awful to say the least.  No one is in charge and there was no Manager presence. I was in on Friday night, my fourth visit, and yet again it was a disaster.  We waited 15 minutes, twice, just to get our beers and the staff was busy talking to each other rather than taking care of their guests.  Not to mention that the place is absolutely filthy, especially the restrooms.  Complete disregard for all basic fundamentals of a positive dining experience.  I'm shocked this place is always so busy.  It won't last long term if it doesn't improve."}
{"text":"Went in to get some delicious mozzarella sticks after checking out pictures on Yelp and came out smelling like a fart"}
{"text":"April G. Is a ridiculous person. Several customers? It's just her. Nobody was complaining about the audio on soccer. It's not even loud. Are you a super hero where everything is amplified?  This is a sports bar, and an excellent one at that. Food is good, management is accommodating, and they don't cram the tables together so you actually have space to enjoy yourself.   I never do reviews but this place treated us so well i felt compelled.  First time here and I'll be back."}
{"text":"Five stars, good food great pizza!! The staff is friendly and spot on. Always my go to place  lots of regulars, and that is the sign of a winning restaurant! My wife even likes the pizza and that's a hard one to do!"}
{"text":"Place is just another average sports bar... Food is average nothing really stands out.... There's are a bunch of tvs but they all play the same 3 games... Couldn't even watch the Warriors game because every tv had a d backs or coyotes game. My server was eh wasn't really attentive was really quick to leave... Overall just another place nothing horrible just bland"}
{"text":"Had a great time watching the UFC fights last night! It was packed, but we didn't have to wait too long to be seated in the restaurant. We knew we were going to be there a while, so it was real nice to be able to watch the fights from the dining room. Our server was courteous, helpful and quick considering how busy it was. We didn't have to wait long for our food or drinks and the food didn't disappoint. The baked Philly sub was very good and the Southwest Mac and Cheese was delicious. We'll definitely be back and are so glad to have a local neighborhood sports bar just a minute away."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came in for a drink opening day, the bartender Stacy was amazing. She was very quick to take our order and she was in top of everything. Very sweet girl. We will definitely be going back to see her!"}
{"text":"I just ordered the all you can eat fish fry. I was not allowed any additional Fry's or coleslaw. And then I was charged .99 to order more fish... so not really all you can eat huh."}
{"text":"We have gone several times for lunch since they've opened. Food is outstanding (love Taco Thursday). The staff is super friendly and the restaurant has a great atmosphere and is always clean. My only concern is that the service is very slow! Regardless of how busy they are (We've been there when it's slow and when it's busy) the food takes a very long time to arrive. We will go back, but hopefully their service speeds up."}
{"text":"I try to like this place but the horrible service always stops me.  Went in on a Saturday to watch college football. In th men's room is a huge poster saying draft beer is $4.00 during college football games (this is for the large draft).   When our bill arrived the charge was $4.75 per beer. I told the bartender. She said, \"Sorry, but it is ringing up at $4.75\". I told her of the sign in the bathroom. She continued to tell me it was ringing up at $4.75.   I told her I did not care what it was ringing up for, check it out.   She sent someone in the bathroom  and he came out and had a little convo with her. She grudgingly changed the amount of the bill. No explanation, apology, anything.   Another day I went in and was lazily waited on by a young lady who appeared to be training for some sort of athletic contest. She was more interested in talking to the other staff and, I suppose, thinking we were all \"dazzled\" by her body. When I paid my bill she gave no thank you or acknowledgement at all.   This bar does not have an inviting feeling to it. Train the staff or replace them and I would be a regular."}
{"text":"Our party of 3 stopped in for dinner on 4/26/17. Everything was incredible including food, atmosphere, and especially the service! It seemed to be a steady night, but not too busy and noise level was reasonable. We were greeted promptly by a very sweet hostess who showed us to our table. Our server, Alexis, was extremely nice and accommodating. She was training a new server that evening but both were very friendly and had no problem joking around with us. We wanted to relax with a drink before eating and we never felt rushed or as if the staff was annoyed that we wanted to delay ordering which was greatly appreciated. We were checked on frequently (but not too often) and Alexis (or trainee) were always very quick to bring whatever we needed! The menu had a great variety and an excellent beer selection! Tvs surrounded every wall, so no worries in missing your favorite sport! Overall, a wonderful dinner experience- would definitely visit again!!"}
{"text":"Awesome baked subs and great beer selection. Love the atmosphere. Time between sitting down and server greeting us was the only negative."}
{"text":"Today I came to tailgaters for my first time since they opened in my neighborhood I walked in and sat down at a table around 12:30. I waiting for the server to arrive. I final was greeted by a server at 12:45. I asked for a menu and a mimosa. The server Heather walked away to get my order. I understand it's Sunday and it get busy but to be honest it's one drink. Two other tables sat down and were served in the time I was waiting on my drink. When the server came back around she said to me \"I am sorry\" I pointed out to her the other tables that had been sat and served.  Her response was \"I just had a table of 13 sit down and I am busy\" I completely understand being busy but what is she trying to say that the table if 13 is more important than a client that lives in the area and would potentially be a returning customer is as important as a table of 13. The manager asked if there was anything he could do to make it up to me but I said I need a few mins and then he sent over another server to take heathers place. I just feel what a first bad impression for a new patron. Said to see such bad service from  a bar I hear good things about. It took 30 minutes to receive my drink.  First impressions make a huge difference. People need to remember that. I will do a follow up review after I leave as I am will to always give a second chance"}
{"text":"I really like the food here but after recent and numerous times here I've found the service to be sub par. Just last night, we waited more than 40 minutes for a cheeseburger and a club sandwich and that was after waiting at least 15 minutes for a server to even get to our table to take a drink order.  I'm going on hiatus for a bit because the food can't make up for the really bad service."}
{"text":"First delivery try tonight and had a long blonde hair on my pizza. Third piece in. Pizza and Wings were decent but the hair ruined it. Definitely better options in the hood."}
{"text":"Good pub food and great spot for sports options on TV. But sloooooooow on the kitchen/front house side. If you come for lunch, don't be in a hurry."}
{"text":"Two stars for decent drinks. They missed the rest on poor service, really bad rock/metal music, too bright and no smoking patio. If you want to go outside you have to leave your drink! This place will not do well if they don't improve!"}
{"text":"My son and I came here to grab a bite after being in the area to check on something.  We ordered a pizza and an appetizer, the appetizer was alright but nothing spectacular...cheese sticks, what do you expect?  We were just buying time for our pie to be done anyhow.  The waitress brought refills before we were even quite finished with the original...very timely!  The pizza finally arrived and it smelled and appeared delicious, it was just ok.  Something was missing but I just wasnt able to put my finger on it.  My son enjoyed it alot more than myself and I was happy about that because he was wanting to try this place out.  He let me know that he has been back since but not myself, too far a drive for just a so so pie."}
{"text":"Very poor service.  Out of the three of us eating, the server got only one order correct.  Drink glasses were empty, hard to get refills.  The food was average.  We won't return, too many other restaurants that provide better service and quality food."}
{"text":"What a joke this place is. Place open for about two months and first time here. One would think that they would have a clue. Place is crowded but service is so slow. Took forever to get just drinks. Then took forever to order food and then getting food another ridiculous amount time. Asked about where food is and it should be coming soon. Really??  Saw manager walking around asking about service at other tables but bee came to ours.  I guess he didn't care about us. When we asked waitress said it was not her fault that cooks behind. Who cares about fault. Get your act together. Wish places here would get a clue about service and doing a better job. Don't think I'll ever come back."}
{"text":"Good sports bar with lots of TV's. Only giving 4 stars because the food isn't anything out of the ordinary, typical bar food. Food isn't bad, but nothing to write about."}
{"text":"Worst service ever. I did notice a now hiring sign on the door going in and that should have been the warning.  Waited forever with two hungry kids so that became a problem. After ordering some wings the order came and we couldn't believe the size of the wings. They were the size of Cornish hens. When they first opened they were great and very meaty. Looks like they are cutting back on portions. It's a shame!  Server never came back for refills on drinks.  One of our guest food was delivered late and Lukewarm.  Bad experience all the way around.  Not sure if we'll give it another try or not."}
{"text":"We ordered our food at 6:05 and came to pick up and waited until after 7pm when a manger was located who found out order sitting behind the attendant the whole time and he excpedted us to take this without remaking it. He eventually had the wings remade but the pizza was cold and not appetizing. No refund or discount offered. Hate to leave bad reviews but Time is precious and it should never take over an hour for a togo order to be placed & picked up. Hope you guys get it together!"}
{"text":"Service sucks big time! Ordered online and came in 10 mins later. Told our order is being boxed. After 30 mins, asking several people and still no order, talked to the \"Director of operations\". No apology, no sorry, only \"do you have any idea how busy we are\".  Wow - in this day and age this is so bad. Won't be back.......... Food not that great for that kinda crap!"}
{"text":"Went here for happy hour with a group of friends. The service was not great. There were many times that we had to flag down our server. Happy hour prices are good and the food was typical, no standouts at our table. Don't know if I'll return."}
{"text":"6/2016 Seemed like a nice place when we walked in. It seemed to be clean but smelled funny and my fiance said tonight is their fish fry all you can eat. Ok. So we sat and tried to have a couple drinks the bartender who was blonde and it was late about 11ish  seemed to have an attitude and had no personality whatso ever. She did not talk to us at all just took our drink order and left us alone even though her manager came over and said a  few things to us. I tried to ask her questions about the bar and she was still short with us. Then we asked for change so we could play some music on the jukebox  because all we heard for the music was RUSH music for 3 songs straight. So we went to try to play songs and the jukebox would not play any of our songs even though we played to skip all of the next songs! But it still played RUSH!! Then where we were sitting literally 2 tables in front of us is someone who thinks he can eat all the hot wings in the bowl. He literally was barfing up the wings and dry heaving trying to get all this food down! Maybe this is something they should do outside the bar and not in front of people trying to enjoy themselves at a sportsbar. Honestly I don't think I will ever go back after the experience I had with the atmosphere of Tailgators!!!"}
{"text":"This place has become my favorite restaurant in the area! I love the environment when you walk in all the TVs lined up on the walls and the huge projector on the back wall. We got the 30\" pizza to split between 5 of us, it was more then enough and super cheap! Only downfall was our waiter, he was either new or ignored us because we were teens. 5 stars for this and I'm not even a sports fan or a drinker!"}
{"text":"Really nice place, layout and location.  Great happy hour specials.  Service is hit or miss.  Table service is generally better than bar service and some of the (female) bar tenders act like they're doing you a favor to wait on you... lazy and incompetent...   But other than that we like the place.  So avoid the crowds and try sitting at a high top instead of @ the bar. Cheers!"}
{"text":"Usually one of my favorite places.  The food is always very good, but our waitress was the absolute worst!  She was rude and pissed off and not at us, but definitely taking it out on us!  I didn't even want to tip her and we were a table of seven.  But of course, I did.  But I will not sit in her section again!  Her name was Nikki and the other waitstaff did not seem too fond of her either.  My advise, avoid her section!"}
{"text":"If you like being overcharged then then this is your place!  We were overcharged for 2 rounds ifs shots! Not I know what your thinking but no we were not drunk! This place was trying to just make money and over charge!!!! I confronted the manager and he stated he was correct and so was Hit bartender. I asked to looked at the tape as his bartender suggested and he said he didn't have the time.  This place is full of liars and bullshitters!!! Don't run a tab and don't trust your service!!"}
{"text":"Love this place. At least once a month we order pizza and wings. The spicy garlic parmigian wings are amazing. The only thing keeping me from giving them 5 stars is the fact that they constantly forget to bring my Dr. Pepper. 4 times now. I have even wrote \"Please don't forget my Dr. Pepper again\" in the order comments and still they have showed up without it. Small problem from an otherwise amazing place!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite pizzas, great potato skins and zucchini. Very good sports bar with plenty big screens. Good overall atmosphere."}
{"text":"Been back many times.  Unfortunately, the service and food has gotten worse and stayed there.  The service is anywhere from mediocre to poor.  There have been times when we waited and waited for a drink, check, or any service at all.  There have been times when we literally got up and walked out due to lack of service.  The food has gotten worse.  Last time we went we ordered wings and there was barely any sauce at all on them and they weren't made fresh.  Other items like subs, pizza, salads, and apps are all sub-par.  The beer selection is still great, the location is great, and the TVs are great for sports.  The management, service, and food needs work drastically.  I don't think they really care at this point based on the amount of reviews that all say the same thing and nothing has been done about it.  Fact is there is nothing in this area to compete with this place...yet."}
{"text":"Update on previous post for Tailgaters on Lake Pleasant. This has become one of our regular stops for lunch.  Extensive menu of consistent, yummy offerings, reasonably priced...even a schedule of specials like two for one burgers on Wednesdays.  All this is great, but what sets this place apart for us is the superior service from bartender Stacy.  Simply said: She gets it.  It's so nice to be welcomed by a genuine pro who not only remembers your name, but also remembers your preferences.  Completely delightful and keeps Tailgaters on our short list of 'go-to' favorites."}
{"text":"We have been starving in this area for a good sports bar-we may still be waiting....the atmosphere is great, service is TERRIBLE.  I can provide the details, but we all know what bad service looks like.  We no longer frequent another place on 83rd due to service that never got better.  PLEASE take note owners & fix this-you have an opportunity to own this market if you choose to do it!!"}
{"text":"I normally enjoy the restaurant however the recent two outings have left a bad note. Both times service unbelievably slow. 1st visit it took 15 minutes for anyone to even acknowledge our presence. The second time we were waiting about 5 minutes when we asked a near table what they were waiting on-They had ordered drinks 15 minutes previously an no response since. It is obvious they don't know how to manage personnel during High volume time periods. On a previous occurrence I had ordered a Manhattan cocktail-what I got was no where near it and after instructing the waitress on how to make one the second order was equally lacking. While their food is adequate it is not worth the heartache and dollars to run their gauntlet."}
{"text":"Food is pretty good and the beer is cold, however, don't go if you're in a hurry. The service is very slow."}
{"text":"I just don't like tailgaters. We've been here three times and ordered pizza delivery and it's yet to be good. The quality of the food doesn't compare with the price. Today we got two bacon cheeseburgers with fries, a philly cheese steak and fries and a baked Italian sub with fries. The burgers were burned (ordered medium) the fries are very greasy. The philly tasted like it was made in grease and was very salty. Two of us feel physically ill and it included upset stomachs and time in the restroom. I'm done with this place!"}
{"text":"High expectations and unfortunately they did not deliver. First off we tried to order online and when you went to modify or order certain items the whole system froze up. Finally called and ordered and they were very friendly and quoted a reasonable pick up time. The main issue was the food. We ordered a bbq bacon cheeseburger well done and it was missing the bbq sauce and onion rings and was cooked to a med rare (which grossed out my husband). I had the chicken Caesar wrap and it was completely tasteless although the fries were good. We also got wings and the sauce was very thin and there was only 1 drum in an order of 10. Hopefully this was just a bad day for them and their food is actually much better than this."}
{"text":"They have a great selection of draft beers and a good happy hour! Service give me kind a hit or mess but usually it's pretty good. Really good wings and a great pizza and Phillies! And my wife says great calzones too!"}
{"text":"Have had a couple salads, the steak and the grilled chicken...all the food is outstanding, the meat is cooked perfect each time, service is outstanding, and the price is right. My picky 8 y/o loves it too. Also, they show hockey!!! Yay!!! My new home base sports bar :) great food, service, and any sport that's on. Nice!"}
{"text":"Umm. So, I went here to join people doing the pizza contest. I thought they were crazy for doing it anyways but they enjoyed it. Their pizza actually looked and smelt good. I would come back for the pizza. I ordered wings, normal bar food. They were still good. My stars for my review was mainly about an employee there who was talking to us during the challenge. There were some members with us from the Mormon church. Missionaries. It's obvious because of what they're wearing and the name tags. One of the employees started to criticize what the members of the church believe and started telling them what they believe. The Elder missionaries didn't mind at all. However, to me it seemed rude that an employee who had a different belief wanted to state things he felt about the church. I didn't feel that was necessary. I thought it was rude and not appropriate at all."}
{"text":"Not to mention the 52 handles! But today I tried the baked Italian sub, let me tell you about the baked Italian sub, the breading is very flaky and light, it is amazing, the best part of the baked Italian sub with the tomato inside. The cheese completely coats the tomato and makes the sandwich what it is. The baked Italian sub was the best Italian sandwich I have ever had in my adult life!! I can remember having the first spicy Italian sandwich at Subway after eating countless turkey sub sandwiches and this baked Italian sub was like losing my virginity to a sub sandwich all over again . I am not joking. I am NOT being over sarcastic. The baked Italian sub was absolutely amazing.. HEATHER SERVED US, SHE WAS AWESOMENESS! !  She was really really fun and really outgoing and she described the beers in great detail to us! I can't wait to come back and try something else on the menu. Thank you Tailgaters for moving close to me and making a meal very EASY & AFFORDABLE. I think i will have to come back for dinner now to compete with my lunch! Thank u Heather!!"}
{"text":"Liked this place a lot. Stopped in for a bite and drink in the bar. Lots of beer options. Enjoyed the friend zucchini and onion rings. Will return."}
{"text":"We eat here a couple times a month.  My wife's favorite dish is the wedge salad and the Big Blue Van beer.  I love the grilled medium wings.  The pizza is always good. My beer of choice is the 805.  Our favorite server is Alexis.  It is always consistently good."}
{"text":"Oh hell yah! Friendly service.  They did a great job putting this place together!  Happy to have it here! Food very good! Happy hr pretty damn good. Only downfall is no pool table.. my group of friends want a pool table. . So we haven't come here. But I'll be back for lunch!"}
{"text":"First trip to tailgaters tonight. It was an excellent experience. We checked out their pizza with our standard pizza combination and found it to be excellent. The service was friendly and attentive. Plenty of screens with a wide selection of sports to choose from. I'll be going back frequently."}
{"text":"So here's the deal.  Most of the bartenders are amazing.  The beer selection is amazing.  Many of the servers are amazing.  Plenty of the cook staff is amazing.  Honestly, this place has tons going for it.  Except the owner decided that only bad music is allowed in the place.  Even if you pay for it, you still cannot get good music.  See once upon a time some old bastard complained blah, blah, blah and the owner over.the.hell.reacted and blocked all the music you would want at a bar from playing.  And right there...the music died.  If they would only fix that, they would get on par with bars in the area...until they walk with a limp."}
{"text":"They have a really good selection of draft beers. Guinness, White Chocolate Sonoran, Mr. Pineapple are my favorites.  Great atmosphere with plenty of tvs."}
{"text":"What a great place to have up in the neighborhood! And if you can get there in time for happy hour you're set! Fantastic prices for happy hour and even not on happy hour prices are very reasonable! The menu is very big so gets hard to decide what we want to eat but everything we have tried has been good. Very large inside and is always busy on Friday nights so must be doing something right!"}
{"text":"HORRIBLE SERVICE, I've been sitting at my table for over 30 minutes waiting for my check and my server won't bring it, I will never come back again."}
{"text":"Very nice atmosphere lots of TVs and literally the worst chicken wings I've ever had in my life. They were very tough and over done. They gave you two little skinny pieces of carrot and celery and blue cheese dressing was very very runny. The drinks were good but my wife had a turkey wrap and you had to look twice to find a turkey. It's really too bad. The french fries were awesome.   I spend the winter about a half a mile from there and it's disappointing that I won't be back."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in lack of caring on managements part thinking it is acceptable to blare soccer extremely loud and annoy many customers.  When asked to turn it down, turned down then back up.  We have been loyal customers for quite some time,  but since the manager Justin doesn't care about customers and upset several to please 2, we won't be returning."}
{"text":"After numerous times of horrible service, being told to \"wait for our delivery because it will eventually show up\" after an hour and half of waiting to be delivered cold pizza, today was the final straw.  This area has numerous other places to eat now and for the prices, you're better off going elsewhere.  Today's adventure consisted of 2 hours without food and 20 minutes after arrival finally getting a sever to bring us menus.  When I hit my breaking point, I was handed a bill for all the food not served to us.  Seriously??  I offered to pay for our two beers and sprite; and that was it.  Stay away."}
{"text":"SKIP the snobby mediocre brewery next door and STOP right in here! This place has all the fun you'd expect from a sports bar AND a beer/food/wine list you'd thought you see at a fine restaurant. Whether it's football, soccer or whatever your fancy get in here the TV's are all around no matter where you choose to park yourself. The staff is friendly and the atmosphere is fun. Come and sit down next to your neighbors and enjoy a cold one. This is a bar done right!!"}
{"text":"i went last night to watch the lakers game..... they didn't get that one. But that's ok. I ordered 10 wings to start with and informed our waitress we would be ordering more but needed time with the menu. We waited 15 minutes and our wings were brought out and after 1/2 way through them outback waitress FINALLY stopped back by. By this time we decided to leave and not get more food. I am giving a good rating because the wings were soooooo good and every waitress/waiter kept a smile even though they were slammed. Our waitress may have forgotten us but she was kind and happy. I will go again and maybe get to finish ordering this time lol"}
{"text":"This place is the shit and people hating on it need to get a life.  Bomb food, strong drinks, and really awesome staff."}
{"text":"Awesome Pizza & a great place to post up at the bar and watch games. I recommend the BBQ Chicken Pizza!!! Amazing."}
{"text":"I've been a few times now and it's just an ok bar.  The wings are pretty good.  The other food I tried was ok, but nothing that stood out as great.  I like all the TV's but it turned out they didn't have the baseball package, so I wasn't able to watch the game I wanted.  I ended up having to go to Buffalo Wild Wings since they have the baseball package.  Every time I have gone, service was extremely slow.  The last time it took at least 10 minutes before someone came to take my order.  The guy behind the bar the last two times was very unfriendly to everyone too.  The positives were the happy hour, lots of beers on tap and was clean.  I will probably check it out again when football gets here.  For local fans that want to watch the Diamondback games this place is probably a 4 star for them.  They also show the UFC fights which I might go back and check out next month."}
{"text":"I Ordered for delivery. The girl on the phone was awesome & the delivery was quick. Pizza is really good ! & philly cheese steak is amazing. Not a huge fan of the wings could just be the kind I got.  Definitely will order again soon :)."}
{"text":"First time here..... After 8 pm during weekday evening is not busy at all BUT it took forever for waitress to serve us ... Had to remind her couple times too...... Might try to come and check this place at weekend..."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and kid friendly. Our first experience with the food was not a good one. Went on a Friday afternoon it wasn't super busy yet food came out cold.  Second chance visit and we were pleased when the food was brought out nice and hot this time. Again great atmosphere especially for sports lovers. Staff is very friendly and we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Super friendly and speedy service! Our waiter Van was on it! I am not a pizza fan but agreed to have one with my hubby. It was delish! And the garlic Parmesan wings were amazing!! Definitely coming back and so glad to have it in the neighborhood!!"}
{"text":"Today we sat at the bar to watch a little football while having an early dinner.  Bar tending staff was not very attentive until a short blond girl took over from our initial bartender who was busy chatting it up. Sports viewing here is great though so we were fine waiting a bit. We ordered buffalo wings here with extra hour sauce because they tend to dry out here. They were of good size and served very hot. For the entree we split Italian hot sub with fries. It's made a little different here in dough/wrap consistency. I wasn't a big fan of this style sandwich but it was very reasonably priced and served with a good amount of fries. Good bar food!  Fun environment."}
{"text":"I will give this please a five star rating because of the good experience we had and the GREAT appetizer selection. Especially the cheese curds. WOW they were better than the fair.  The atmosphere was fun along with 360 degree views of televisions. Wait staff friendly, helpful and just all around awesome. I ordered the  Philly Steak pocket. It is like a calzone with the steak in the middle. It could of used more flavor is some sort. Although my sandwich was not perfect the rest of my experience was and like I said, try the appetizers. I definitely will give the dinner portion another shot. Plenty of things to choose from."}
{"text":"We had a pizza delivered to us at our RV park last Saturday and it was so good we had to come and try the pizza in house. We had two slices of pepperoni pizza, an 8 inch supreme and our little girl had spaghetti with Alfredo on top. She is a picky eater and she said that this was the best Alfredo she had ever had!  Chris is the general manager and he is really on top of the game here! All of the employees were super friendly and able to help us out. LaRai was our server today and was very helpful and quick with the service. I really enjoy this place; it's a reasonable price for very, very good pizza!"}
{"text":"Great food and service! Although this is a restaurant and \"bar\" Tailgaters is very family friendly. We have had many different items off of the menu and have never been disappointed but their pizza is definitely my favorite! Many beers on tap and an expansive menu of homemade dishes has made this place one of our families favorites!"}
{"text":"Very sloooow!  Not enough wait staff ...ON A SUNDAY NFL DAY!  Couldn't believe it!  Food average at best.  NO published prices on beverages... (46 varieties of draft beers, 56 bottled beers, 6 \"seasonal beers, multiple wines and drinks)... none!  You ask the Server and she says it \"depends on what you order\".   Unbelievably stupid whoever came up with that concept. \"You order.  We'll tell you later what you owe.\"  I'll not go back to this \"clip joint\"!"}
{"text":"Pros: Great Happy Hour, extensive menu, tons of TVs, great patio. Cons: We've had two different visits where managers have berated employees on the floor of the restaurant, it's a bad look, take that stuff to the back of the house."}
{"text":"I agree with Leigh!  Unbelievable slow service from the kitchen.  And sometime slow service from the wait staff.  The food is typical bar stuff - mostly fried.  Prices are average.    The third star is for all the TV's.  You can always find something to watch while you're waiting for food."}
{"text":"Great service, friendly staff, good food (loved the wings and potato skins) AND fantastic French fries!! Came in to watch the game and was not disappointed"}
{"text":"I don't ever do this!!! However, I'm going to blast Tailgaters Il'Primo on Lake Pleasant right now, and let everyone know that the .management that runs this establishment treats their employees like SHIT & has the worst service on the planet. They have zero respect for the their customers as well as the people they employ. Please don't ever give them your business!!! Your reputation speaks volumes and if you don't have enough integrity to handle your business the right way than you get what you get Larry."}
{"text":"Edit; 1/9/18. Never going back here, seriously. The tables were dirty, the glasses were dirty, the photo of a stadium by our booth was disgusting and the service was slow and sub par and I my food was bad- I had the core of the lettuce in my salad and some really wrinkly tomatos. I had high hopes but they blew it - I was hoping this could be a good spot for games but we won't be back. Just gross.   Edit 10/29/17 Went in for lunch today (we are semi regulars) and I told hubby that I am glad this was not our first visit or it would have been our last. The menus were so sticky that I had to go wash my hands, the ladies room had overflowing garbage with used towels overflowing the bin and on the floor. Clara was our server and hubby ordered a medium burger, no bun, I had the buffalo chicken wrap and a cider in a dirty glass. Hubby's medium burger was very rare so Clara offered to re order it. By the time his burger (only the burger, no fresh fries or accompanying items) arrived, I was done eating. We told Clara our concerns and she offered us a cookie. We declined.  No manager approached us although there was ample time and opportunity. I am not writing them off yet, but I hope to see some improvements. (The added bonus of a f-bomb screaming biker lady/Raider fan was an added bonus, especially with the children in the bar.) C'mon guys, we really like your place. Get it together.     6/10/17 original review- We had Ricki for our server and she was awesome! I had a dirty martini and the manager stuffed some blue cheese olives for me (initially he said they did not have them but they were on the menu so he made them for me personally). It was crazy busy and a really fun party atmosphere, and the food was excellent! We have been back several times, this is a new favorite. It is clean and great menu items and great staff-definitely added to our \"local\" rotation. I had the calzone, hubby had the fish and chips, son had the boneless honey habanero wings, all the food was delicious."}
{"text":"Good bar food, a lot of tv's and pretty damn good service.. what's crazy is, they have \"table reserved\" signs on almost half the tables on the bar side.. ridiculous!  People are walking in and walking out..  we ended up at a table tucked around the corner which sucks and they end giving someone who came in after us a \"reserved\" table that wasn't theirs..  the bar side needs to be first come first served..  disappointing.."}
{"text":"Great setup, location and menu!  Service was terrible!  Food delivery was slow.  They need to train their staff better, not friendly or attentive.  Jen our server acted put out every time we asked for something, this after us having to call her over because she would never stop by. Food was good but bad service ruined it!"}
{"text":"Excellent wings pizza and awesome bread sticks more like bread knots but are the BOMB!! Fastest delivery in the area super nice employees."}
{"text":"Great happy hour or even great place to come with the family.Fun environment, definitely coming back. Food and service were awesome!"}
{"text":"Fantastic staff here!! Seems like to me the servers here are always hustling around, providing spectacular service! This location is actually pretty big on the inside. Has large seating sections on both the restaurant side and the bar side. It does have a small patio on the north side the the building also. Parking is never an issue here even when it's slammed. There's a extra huge lot north of the building.   My friends and I usually pick this place when we all meet up for happy hour. They have a great beer and wine selection. Also I've noticed they have a relatively wide variety of hard liquor here too.   I usually order beer from the tab here. My selection normally are with Coors Light or Kilt Lifter. My top favorites for sure! They have a pretty good happy hour menu list of item for either food or alcohol here too.   We had a party of 15 people here and the service did not skip a beat! It was awesome! We ordered the big 36 inch pizza they have here plus a ton of appetizers and drinks for the group. We absolutely destroyed the pizza! There was not a crumb left. The pizza was very awesome. It wasn't too greasy, and it had good flavor. I think it was the biggest pizza I've ever seen in my whole life! Haha I love the wings here too! I usually order the medium spice. You can't really go wrong there.   There are lots of flat screens hung all over the place. Makes it really cool/ convenient when you are here to catch the game or watch the fight. Pretty much any direction you that you are seated here, you have a few tv's in sight.   This place is 5 stars for me! I always have a great time when I am come here and always look forward to coming back.   If you looking for a great HAPPY HOUR spot, you should check it out."}
{"text":"I enjoy their wings even if a tad small, they are always cooked well. The pizza is subpar. We ordered three times for delivery and they completely messed up the third time. I guess it can happen but when we called to have it fixed they put us on hold multiple times, finally said they would correct it but never arrived to actually fix it. We called after another hour and they yet again put us on hold. We waited 5 minutes on hold a manager answered and said yet a different manager would call us back. Guess what, we never heard back and went to bed hungry. We gave up not only on this order but on the establishment. Too many other places that deliver to us that hasn't messed up in dozens of orders. They clearly have no regard for customers and will lie to avoid speaking to them."}
{"text":"The wait for food is really, really long!!  Waited over a hour and a half for wings and potato skins. Hopefully they hire more people."}
{"text":"Went to Tailgaters in Peoria for dinner and to watch a Stanley Cup game. I sat at the bar - they have many craft, domestic, and import beers on tap. The beer was fresh, cold, and tasty. Service at the bar was very good and the bartenders were friendly. Had a cheeseburger and fries for dinner - it was cooked right and the fries were crispy and hot. Very nice sports bar environment with many TVs showing a variety of games. Nice place - will go back again when I'm in town."}
{"text":"Amazing food and great sports bar to watch games plenty of tv options. Breadsticks are the bomb and wings are good."}
{"text":"There is an update!   There response to my review!   I'm sorry for your experience on Saturday night, unfortunately we don't take reservations for UFC nights.  We offer no cover and try to accommodate everyone.  We cannot hold tables if the entire group isn't present and once the whole group is present we try to seat every in the order their group came in.  Once again very sorry that you all couldn't get seated.  We will look at other options in the future.  My response:   Well that is fine, I will not be going back to your location and I will tell everyone how unaccommodating you guys were and I will be taking this as high as I can to make sure you guys understand you cant treat people the way you treated my family. I understand you guys were busy but you could have done something then trying to have a family of 9 seat at a table for 4. That was not ok and on top of it, My uncle did tell you guys we were right around the corner and still nothing. So don't give me crap about trying to help, the Manager Chris didn't care no did he really try to seat all of us at one table that was big enough for us. He just pushed us off like we didn't matter, your customer service there was really crappy and that is not ok with me. I have read all the other reviews and they felt the same way. I also had 2 children with me as well and we wanted to get a pizza, where in the hell were we supposed to put it on a table has has tons of crap on it as it was and then try to eat a pizza with no room to even sit.I will take this to the news if I need to. I don't want free food or any coupons, I just want you guys to understand that you cant treat people that way. Even in you commit to my post wasn't very friendly and you still don't really care to even fix the issue at hand. So again I feel  like I am not being treated like a customer should. I will be showing this to everyone, and letting them know just how rude and unprofessional you and your location really is!! So thank you for your time to write me back but that really didn't help anything and just made it worse for you guys!  ----------------------------------------------------  First off, I have been coming to this location with my uncle for almost 2 years, the service has always been great up to this point! I am sooooo passed it's not even funny! I am not one to complain and I am the one that always fines the good in everything! Tonight was a very different..... my uncle got here at 5 pm and told them that I have some more people coming in about a hour or so, I would like a bigger table. Now I know they will not sit you till your whole party is there, and they were pretty busy. But he said he will sit at a table till the bigger table opened up. They told him ok no worries, well the time we got they they gave us 5 chairs to sit around his table because they didn't have a big table and the manager would not pull a table to my uncles because there were people waiting! Now as you can see the table my uncle had was a 4 top and now you have the 4 chairs that are already there and then add another 5! The kicker was, we asked as the big table that seats more opens up and the manager flat out said no! You guys weren't here and there are people waiting. So I said I was leaving and will not come back! The manager didn't really seem to care or try to work with us at all! So we left, as I was driving away I called and asked for the managers name! His name was Chris, he was the most unhelpful, not caring manager ever! He could care less that we left! We drove from north phoenix just to eat there because we love that place. Once I got his name then I asked for his managers name, I got a name of Mike, then I asked for his contract information and they would not give it to me! The lady on the phone was really nice but it's clear that Chis (night manager) could care less, as long as he is pushing people in to get their money! I am sooo mad and I will take this as far up as I can to prove a point that you can't treat people that way! That was the most horrible customer service I have ever had! I would not recommend that location ever again!"}
{"text":"Customer service was good pizza was good ordered the wings extra crispy and they were great. I will definitely go there again. Special thanks to Chris the manager who took care of us. The minus one star is only for not allowing two toppings on half a pizza for the special when you get only have cheese. I'm sure that's the computer issue but overall we are happy"}
{"text":"Good local joint.  Food choices are good.  The delivery is quick.  Prefer them over any other delivery place around the area.  Wish that they had a better variety for healthier options."}
{"text":"First time in last night to watch the fight.  Friendly staff, tons of tv's, good food and good drinks.  Large bar area with outdoor seating, we definitely will be back again!"}
{"text":"I thought about sugar-coating this review. Nope.   Went to lunch today at 2pm (least busy restaurant time ever).  The place was nearly empty, as expected, other than a few sad souls at the bar.  The entire restaurant smelled like a dirty bathroom that someone tried to drown with bleach.  Sat down front and center on the bar side of the place, where there was a server and a bartender. We were then ignored for the next 15-20 minutes (no menus, no drinks, no silverware).  Then, we proceeded to get up and leave the establishment as the bartender asked \"you still haven't been served?\" As I promptly answered, \"nope.\"  We then walked about 12 feet to the East, where we stumbled upon \"The Creek\". I was intrigued, and up for almost anything after that failure of an outing.  I could not have been happier with the food, drinks, awesome customer appreciation, cleanliness, and ambiance of The Creek. Would highly recommend to anyone looking for a great atmosphere with excellent food.   You won't catch me at Tailgaters unless there's sports on TV. Better yet, I'll go to Gallaghers, where people are happy to see and serve you. There's plenty of good bars and restaurants in the area. Don't settle for this. If Tailgaters doesn't make some serious changes, I don't see it lasting very long.   If you made it this far, thanks.  Tailgaters (1/10) The Creek (10/10) Gallaghers (8/10)"}
{"text":"Good food and good service. But, they have a nice patio however the outside of the restraunt smoking area is LITERALLY right by the back patio. Lots of people smoke so if the breeze is flowing back then you are eating and sucking in people's cigarette smoke."}
{"text":"Really good food and fair prices. Good environment and the staff is friendly as well."}
{"text":"Beer selection was good, Staff could work on being a little bit more friendly. Food was ok, stick to the app's"}
{"text":"Solid little bar with a more than decent happy hour. We sampled many of the happy hour appetizers and while none of them were WOW, i will say they did the trick. My favorite was probably the spinach dip with tri-color tortilla chips followed by the pretzels and beer cheese. We also tried the boneless buffalo wings, and a cheese pizza. Pretty average on the last two things.   Great drink specials, lots of beers on tap to choose from and a good bottled selection. Being more of a wine drinker, I usually have low expectations from establishments like this on their wine selection. So I was surprised to find that I could get a better glass of wine above their house. But let's be clear, this is a beer and wings place -- not going to get a sexy wine flight with cheese. But again, not what this place is about."}
{"text":"Had a horrible meal! We sent back everything! Paid cash because they said they had a communication problem and couldn't run my card. Therefore, we paid cash and didn't sign the credit slip. They took our cash as a 40 dollar tip and ran our card anyway! Manager was unbelievable- very rude. Will never set foot in there again."}
{"text":"When it comes to atmosphere and food it's a pretty good place to hang out.  Nice patio also.  Too bad the service is so horrible though.  The bartenders egos are more important then the customers it seems.  They usually walk passed you two or three times before they acknowledge your presence.  Good luck staying open kids!"}
{"text":"Our first visit here was awful so we stayed away for awhile.... but decided to give it another try recently and were pleasantly surprised!! I ordered the baked ziti and it was really great. It comes out fresh and hot with plenty of flavor. My fiancé gets a new beer every time we go and enjoys the selection. There is always something on tv to watch or trivia to play which makes it a fun experience. The servers/bartenders are okay.  The downfall: margaritas are pre made so they are not tasty and it is hit or miss with good service"}
{"text":"First time trying the place.  We had the the pizza and wings combo.  The server was very responsive, did not let a drink go dry.  The food came quickly and was hot and tasty.  There are about 60 beers on draft so you can find the usual lights or the great crafts.  Nice local find we will be back."}
{"text":"Wow, the service here sucked. One star for decent food - once we actually got it. Orders wrong, bills wrong. Came on Mother's Day for just a casual time. Waiter never apologized, never sent a manager to apologize - nada. Being group of about a dozen they sure added the 18% gratuity though. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Love this place for happy hour on Wednesdays. Extra large pizza is $9.99. The service is phenomenal. Today we had Jasper who provided excellent service. It's always busy in early evening but we've never had to wait. Definitely check it out and it's family friendly."}
{"text":"I love this place. Service was off tonight. Not sure why. But food is always great!!!"}
{"text":"Took an hour and twenty minutes (80 minutes) to have one pizza delivered.  My home is 1 mile away, door to door.  Pizza arrived cold.  Took approx 10 minutes just to order the food as the girl taking my order was in serious need of more training.  I was happy to support a new local business and to say I am disappointed is an understatement.  I guess it is one and done for this place."}
{"text":"I went last night to check it out. I like that they have a lot of beer on tap. I was very dissapointed by their service. It took 20 min to get an order in. Drinks took as long to recieve. Food came out quickly, with the exception of the pizza. that took another 20 min. The wings were cold, which was weird because they were brought out quickly. It was my 6 year olds birthday and they said they would bring out a brownie with ice cream for her. I thought this was nice and she was excited. 30 min passed and i had to leave because it was getting late. She never got her brownie. If all this wasn't bad enough, I was waiting for my daughter while she was in the restroom and an employee came from the kitchen, with his gloves on, and went into the men's room. He came out wearing the same gloves and returned to stacking dishes in the kitchen. I will defiinitely not be returning."}
{"text":"Tailgaters has been a go to place for us for many years. We used to live in surprise and went to the one out there at least once a week.  The restaurant in Peoria has been our closet Tailgaters for the last three years. We typically have anywhere from 3 to 20 people with us.  The service at the Peoria restaurant has always been a little lackluster and slow.  Tonight was by far the worst. I can say that Tailgaters Peoria has lost our business.  My wife granddaughter and I came in for what we thought would be a quick bite.  We were taken to a table right away. Then the wait begins.  10 min to get drinks. We decided to just split the nachos.  35min later I had to flag down the manager to please check on our order.  10 minutes later we finally get our order.  So we are 55 minutes into 2 drinks and 1 order of nachos.  We finish up and the waitress brings the check and apologized for the wait. We put the credit card in the holder and the wait begins again!! I finally had to wave my hands to get attention to pay the tab.  Mind you that the restaurant was at maybe 2/3 capacity. This place can get very busy. This was not at all the case tonight.  Tonight's service was pretty much the last straw for us. We will be telling all our friends and family that it's probably time to find a new hangout."}
{"text":"The best sport's bar on the West side. Excellent food and friendly staff. You always feel welcome here and the outdoor patio is nice and large. Over 50 tv's to watch the games on and the managers will always try and accommodate your game request. Very family friendly as well with their dining area and a very large menu selection!!!"}
{"text":"I was excited that we had a new family friendly place to eat in the neighborhood but then we tried it.  Extremely  disappointed with mediocre food, typical bar like food, no healthy options and served my children reheated Kraft mac n cheese and constant country music that streamed. Not our kind of place."}
{"text":"If you're thinking about going here, just keep driving a bit further. Just about anywhere is better than the service at Tailgaters. This wasn't our first time there but today definitely was the worst service we've had. Whened, it was seat yourself, yet every open table was still dirty and hadn't been bussed since the last guest. After finding a table, it was 10 min wait before anyone came up to ask our drink order. The first server said she'd be right back with menus. 5 mins later, still nothing. Another server must have overheard us discussing going somewhere else and took over our table. Unfortunately service wasn't any better. While we got our drinks and put in a food order, 45 mins went by with no additional follow up. We finally got our servers attention and she said she was surprised we didn't have our food yet.  She said she'd be right back with a status. Another 15 mins later and still no food nor update so we had enough. My wife walked up to our server and asked for our bill. She handed it to us with the full food order on the bill and had acted surprised that we refused to pay it since we didn't have our food after an hour+. She never checked on our food and just assumed it was out to our table. $16 for two beers and a 1.5hrs wasted of our time for nothing.  Too many other good bar joints around to waste time here again."}
{"text":"Ordered some hoagies to-go to feed the crew for lunch. Each came with a choice side ... tater tots, onion rings, or fries ... we tried them all. We got  Philly Cheese Steaks, French dips, buffalo chicken hoagie and a meatball sandwich. All were excellent. Big enough to go halv-sies  They also offer a military disc.  Thanks Tailgaters and Il Primo! You're a 4 star \" better than most \" sports-bar joint!"}
{"text":"If i could give this place a 0 star i would, my coworkers and i ordered 4 chicken fettuccine Alfredo bowls which totaled to $56. We each payed $14 a person and the portion sizes were outrageously small, for $14 the meal should fill me up no problem, every single one of us were still starving after spending $14 each. I was also not impressed with the dried out chicken and the waterlogged noodles. I will not be returning. One of my coworkers also got instantly sick from the food."}
{"text":"Had to wait a bit. Then got table that could of been wiped down better but!!  I was impressed! This place reminds of TGIF meets Buffalo Wild Wings which is cool. The only thing was who orders pasta at a sports bar???? Me!!! I read The menu and it was so detailed as to what they put in the pasta that I knew somebody knew what they were doing. In New York, I was raised around many different cultures, Italian being one of them. I know what great pasta tastes like. This was grrrreat pasta. They use real mozzarella and it comes with garlic bread. My hubby ordered wings and fries both equally delicious, and we shared a salad. The ranch is homemade and perfect. Everything they placed on the table was great. We will be back for sure. They are affordable and even gave military discount. Our waitress was quick and efficient. Overall great experience! Thanks"}
{"text":"NOT happy about the service tonight.  My husband waited over 20 min for a beer, then waited another 10 min for his calzone after I got my food."}
{"text":"Been coming here since they opened. Always good service and never disappointed with the food. A zillion  tv's and all your favorite sports on. Nice contemporary music not to loud in the background. My favorite post shopping grub and Sunday football spot"}
{"text":"Had a great experience.  Management was very welcoming. I appreciate being able to watch the soccer game!  Thanks Justin!"}
{"text":"Another great experience at TG.  Look, if you don't mind a few drinks before you eat...you'll be just fine.  Drinks are quick, even when the place is packed.  Food on the other hand, that takes a while, but it is good when it gets there.  Vann was our server and he was great.  We are loving our local restaurant/bar.  Just a lot of fun.  So far, our servers have been great."}
{"text":"We really liked this place! It kind of reminds me of a Buffalo Wild Wings set up- would be great for watching sports games. We brought a friend from out of town here for a few drinks and dinner. We ordered nachos as an appetizer, which were great. I had a pizza for lunch which was awesome. The beer selection and atmosphere were great!   We did order to go from here and used a coupon that came in the mail for pizza and wings for $19.99. After I got the food home, I realized that they charged me $21.98 before tax. Not a huge deal, but bothers me when you're giving them a coupon that clearly says $19.99. Be sure if you are using their coupons, you double check your receipt before leaving the rest"}
{"text":"The food was mediocre at best. The first time we went the food was nearly flavorless. We decided to give the food one more chance and were again disappointed. The food was once again nearly flavorless and this time it was also overcooked and barely edible at all."}
{"text":"Got back late from an all day hike in flagstaff and skipped in n out to get what I thought would be a solid $9 salad investment given it's listed as Italian food. My boyfriend and I were starving but exhausted so I ordered a full portion and a half portion Caesar salad and it totaled up go $16 and change, and I optimistically  (and fairly naively) hoped it would be a bomb salad. What we got filled two small bowls of romaine lettuce, croutons, a ton of paremesan, and crappy dressing. Learn from me."}
{"text":"Our server and food were excellent.  However, a  big fight broke out at the bar area last night and police were called out.  Responding officers made contact with manager and myself just outside the front door.  Let this be a lesson learned that police were called out for a reason to your establishment and to say nothing really happened is completely ludicrous as there is always bystanders watching.  Until you have security posted within your establishment my wife and I will not be returning.  There was 3 shootings today in Phoenix metro area so wake up and realize the threats (2 of those police involved) no matter of location."}
{"text":"If you sit anywhere but the bar.. good luck with service. 15 minute wait for a beer order, 45 minute wait on an uncrowded lunch hour for a sandwich ordered. Manager is non existent. If you want to sit at a booth or table.. go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Great location for locals and if you choose to just have a drink and watch a game -it's perfect!  Great TV's and atmosphere for sporting events.  For anything else, dining for instance, it stinks.  The food quality is bad and the servers are hit and miss.  I'm not sure what the goal of having the female servers dressed so provocatively is, as this is a family place.  The girls all seem more concerned with their appearance than being attentive to their tables.  Maybe if I were a dude, it would be different.  Alas I'm not and unfortunately for them, I'm the one who gets to choose where we dine more often than not and I always vote to go elsewhere or stay home.   I hope they improve, I'd like to be able to give them another try.  Get a better chef and dress your servers in appropriate uniforms.  I'm all for fun and sexy, just not tacky.  Sorry."}
{"text":"Glad this place is in our area.  Much needed.  The food is good bless you ask them to deviate/modify the order... then the wheels fall off the bus.  My wife doesn't like ranch and we always order the buffalo baked chicken sub and ask for the ranch to be on the side.  We've ordered it 6 times over the last year and 5 of the six times they made it wrong.  Really frustrating.  I don't get why this is so hard.  Scares me if someone was to come in here with a peanut allergy and asked that there be no peanut related items on something that typically had peanuts.  I'm leaving this review in hopes that they will read it and clean up their act.  Tonight when they messed up I sent it back and the bartender comped me a beer which was very appreciated but I really wish they'd just fix the underlying problem."}
{"text":"On every table in the restaurant is a marketing flipboard full of daily specials, which includes a Bonus Special page at the end. The ad claims if you check-in to Tailgaters on Facebook you will receive a coupon/free appetizer/whatever.  I checked-in then asked our waitress what we had won, who had no idea, who proceeded to ask the manager, who told us the promo was 4 years old and somehow didn't include the Peoria location. When I told the manager the promo said it included the Peoria location, he said he would \"text their FB guy and find out.\" We never saw Manager Man again.  Long story short, this place continues to unimpress me with its service, food, and drinks.   When can Peoria get a good restaurant?"}
{"text":"You wouldn't believe my one star rating, if you knew how often I go here.  Beer is cold. Food is unpredictable, but good most of the time.  Biggest complaint is that they refuse to show ASU games on Pac 12 and show UFC instead.  Really bad when they say a game will be on, but it's not when you get there."}
{"text":"Love having this place in the neighborhood, the wings and pizza are the bomb. Happy hour is great, price of drink specials are cheap and we enjoy the atmosphere. Can't wait for the weather to cool to enjoy the patio, open those rolling windows up!"}
{"text":"We've been looking for good pizza near us for years now! And finally found it - way to go tailgaters! Absolutely one of the best pizzas I have ever had and they deliver to! There is a small delivery fee but it's well worth it. The pizza was delicious not greasy very complicated half-and-half ordered and perfectly and the delivery driver was very kind and friendly he promised a pizza would be delicious and it was! Can't wait to start ordering from them and try some of their other offerings!"}
{"text":"While I find the food quite good I could not have been more freaked out when I was screamed at by last nights manager and was told that I should never, ever call there again.  I am and elderly woman who lives alone and suffers from PTSD.  I sat here crying.  Not very cool.  I also asked for the phone number of the owner and they would not give it to me. wow"}
{"text":"Great new location!  Love the atmosphere and we have needed a good sports bar in the area for a while.  The place is covered with TVs everywhere!  There is a huge screen in the main restaurant.  The food is the same at the other locations and I really liked the Philly stuffed sandwich.  The place has only been open for 3-4 days and with no promoting it the place was jammed pack on Monday night football.  The service was fair, I think they are still working out the kinks since we were offered other peoples food about 2-3 times while in the bar/lounge area.  I think with everyone being new it will take a few weeks to perfect their systems.  Regarless I am very happy with this place and will probably be going here regularly for a while."}
{"text":"I really like this sports bar. It is large but can fill up on Sunday mornings during football season. Very good menu and food selection. Drinks are cheap and servers are very attentive. Great place to catch the game, will be back"}
{"text":"Went to Tailgaters, Peoria to watch Loyola/Michigan game yesterday.    Had reservation for party of 8.  When I arrived I spoke to Alyssa and she pointed to the booth reserved for my group.  Asked if we could be moved to a better spot for watching  the game and she offered what I thought was the best spot in the whole restaurant.  I thought the service was great and my loaded potato skins were perfect.  However other members of the group were not so happy with the service.  Although no one complained about the food, when it came time to get our individual checks, we waited, and waited and waited.   The wait was so long that the manager was called over.  This was a big downside (and the fact that Loyola lost) to the whole experience.  Service was poor but the food was excellent and the place is truly a sports bar with multiple screens for watching  all the sporting events of the day."}
{"text":"Unbelievable. Unbelievably bad service. Empty restaurant and took 20 min. To have a salad brought out (that was requested to be served before the meal), Hot Wings that were ordered well done were served at best luke warm....all while the waitress with the attempt at cleavage prances around talking to co workers friends and on cell phone. Just an unacceptable experience. Normally a great place to eat but service has been shoddy lately. I'm easy to please when I know I'm gonna eat but cold food is unacceptable."}
{"text":"My coworkers and I order from here pretty regularly, so it's safe to say we've tried most of their menu... but their pizza is extremely f*ing delicious! I don't know what it is about the crust, but it's damn good! They have pretty good pizza deals Monday through Thursday"}
{"text":"I just love walking in to pick up my food and not ONE girl behind the counter even looks my way or acknowledges me(: this poor waitress carrying I don't even know how many cups finally said they'll be right with me, and then I love how I waited at the counter for about 10 minutes before being helped(: oh! and then I love how they handed me my food and didn't say anything besides \"here you go\" because the girls were so focused on their own conversations. I almost forgot to mention the manager walked by me several times and didn't even say anything or bother to help me to get me on my way....I don't think i've ever been to a place with such horrible customer service it's unreal LOL"}
{"text":"First and last time.  The hostess cleaned the booth with a wet towel  then forgot to wipe it.    I ordered spaghetti and meatballs.  The plate had water in it from the spaghetti.  Food tasted as if everything was frozen then heated up.  We will not be returning.  John"}
{"text":"This place is piece of shit. I sat there for about 10 minutes. At the bar! Never got acknowledged by Mr Man Bun. Apparently whatever was going on in the corner was more important that his bartender duties. So I said fuck it and left. On my way out I was told by staff at take out window to have a good night. My retort was simply, \"How when I never got served?\". If you are desperate to waste your money....Send me a PayPal. Don't go here though!"}
{"text":"The servers and food are amazing here. The environment is great and the location. The only problem is Justin and how they coordinate reserving a table. Their communication is not good. Not sure if they talk to each other when the bar is busy!! On another note, other customers have spoken to us about how rude and un professional Justin was to them also. All the servers are amazing and are very welcoming."}
{"text":"I've only been once. A Sunday. At noon. It was very quiet. It smelled clean. Not like pine sol or bLeach. Just clean. I liked the music. The other customers were chill, local vibe. Server Cheyenne was very good; Experienced, conscientious, friendly, on top of everything. I'm vegetarian. I tweaked a turkey wrap to meet my wants. Cheyenne was very helpful and open about this process. The wrap was good for being modified. The tortilla was a little thick which felt doughy in my mouth at times but the inside was fresh. Husband ordered wings. He loved the honey hot sauce she recommended. We shared a pizza. Train crust w Spinach tomato garlic. Tasty. Prices were spot on for this neighborhood. We will be back."}
{"text":"Love the food extremely noisy and if you aren't of the younger crowd buying tons of beer you are ignored it's very shameful"}
{"text":"I have been here twice and both times food and service were very good.  The amount and types of beer on draft is also great.   Last time we had wings, French dip sandwich, and a patty melt with fries.   Everything was prepared perfectly and was served promptly."}
{"text":"Go here, see heather with short hair. Great service and awesome attitude! We will definitely be back"}
{"text":"My fiancé, I and a couple friends from work came in for a few drinks, Sunday night after work and the bartender we had was awful!! So incredibly rude, I asked her for a lemons, she brought me limes,m. I was totally ok with it and respectfully corrected her, then she brings me a cup full of lemons, slams it down on the bar and rolls her eyes as she walks away! I wish I had caught her name! Anytime we asked for more drinks, she rolled her eyes as if it was a huge inconvenience that our drinks were empty. If ever I come back and see that this woman is working, I will not stay!"}
{"text":"Makayla was top notch, we were very impressed. Cave creek has needed a place like this for a long time! The food and service were terrific.  We will definitely return."}
{"text":"I gave this place two stars last year because the service had gotten so bad. It's better. Still inconsistent but better. We enjoy the $1.75 Tuesday tacos and the XL pizza for under $10 on Wednesdays. Craft beer happy hour prices are still higher here than most places.   This used to be one of our go-to happy hour places. Until about a month ago, both the food and service were very good. The food has gone downhill; the service sucks. We just walked out after six servers walked past our table numerous times without even acknowledging that we were sitting there. 15 minutes of being ignored while four servers chit chat with each other is unacceptable. As we walked toward the door, we mentioned to the four of them that no-one had waited on us so we were leaving. All we got in return were four eye rolls."}
{"text":"We finally have a great sports bar in the area!  Food is good and atmosphere is great."}
{"text":"Lots of draft beers to choose from. Food was good, had a baked sandwich, and reasonably priced. Only giving 4 stars because our order was put in incorrectly, server caught it but it took extra time as a result."}
{"text":"3/24/2016 My husband wanted to try this place. He got a baked meatball sub and I ordered the Reuben. Both were delicious, but, the fries were so greasy they were oozing. Good news, had two drinks was only charged for one. I think the one reason I keep going back is the huge size of the bar and the ability to look outside. Sitting at a bar and only seeing the tv's gets old. Just seeing the trees outside make it much more relaxing. I never have been a big fan of a small, 15-20 seat bar. Like a big open room, with lots of seating. So, now that I have sampled a few foods, I will stick to what I know is fair to good. I really go for a drink or two and the food is secondary.    3/10/2016  Well, another try and another disappointment. Not sure what I am doing wrong, or if I am just ordering the wrong food. Got the wings this time. They were so small, overlooked and hardly had any meat at all on them.  Not sure if I want to   I have been here three times and the food is good and fast. Took my daughter there today and she loved her baked Philly cheesesteak sandwich. I had the Reuben and it was real tender and the marble rye toasted, not soggy. There variety of beers is impressive and I have yet to have any food item that I did not like. It will become my new local favorite spot. Had to take away a few stars after this last visit. Stopped in around 12:30 and sat at the bar, as I always do. Ordered the Buffalo Chicken Wrap. It was quite disappointing with mostly lettuce and tomato and very little chicken. I had to unwrap it and dig around to find the few bites of chicken that was there. Bartender/waitress did not ask me how my meal was until I was completely finished. Told her that the chicken was practically non-existent to which she said she would let the kitchen know. She did not tell the kitchen and after another 30 minutes, I told the manager. I hope that the quality does not start sliding now that they have been open for a few months."}
{"text":"The Philly steak was extremely awesome! Would definitely keep ordering take-outs. My only complaint is that waiting for take out orders there's almost nowhere to to stand or sit. But that's also a sign of how good the restaurant is because it's been crowded every time I'm in there. We have never eating in the restaurant itself. Despite the crowds the food has always been hot and fresh and there's never been a mistake with our order as well."}
{"text":"The management has improved a bit and some of the waitstaff are nice but almost all waitresses are rude and will walk right into you if you don't get out of THEIR way. Hostesses are worse. Pamela the bartender is probably the worst. She will walk right past you, look at you with an empty glass and keep walking. Even after she knows what regulars like she will STILL do that. I wish I could tip the other bartenders and not her. Burgers are great if they make them the way you order it. BOGO on Wednesday's. Plenty of room for further improvement."}
{"text":"Tailgaters and Il primo in one spot?!?!? Can't complain!! Definitely coming back, close to home and love the Spicy garlic Parmesan wings!!  LOADS OF TVS! Sports and UFC..... The must go to spot!"}
{"text":"We drive out of our way to go to this place. We try to go when they won't be busy because they get VERY packed. However, even on St. Patrick's Day we got served in a reasonable time frame. Great pizza, cold beer (really cold, not chilled like other restaurants), and good salads. We've never had bad service. In fact, a few times it was exceptional."}
{"text":"I want to make this clear, my issue is not with the establishment as a whole. Only one specific \"expediter\" and the manager, Donnie.   With that being said I would like to start with the good. My server, Savanna, was awesome. She advised that it was her second day on the job and she was incredibly nervous. I would be too if I were serving six hungry basketball enthusiasts. Despite her inexperience she was still amazing. Very attentive and always made sure our beverages were full. The food was delicious. It came out somewhat promptly and HOT... (and here lies the problem...)  The expediter brought out my boyfriend's food. My boyfriend, hoping to assist, reached out to grab the plate and was instantly burned. After his obvious injury the expediter felt it would be best to advise us that the plate was hot (way to state the obvious). My boyfriend was in a great amount of pain and initially the only thing that was offered was a cup of ice. I  requested to speak to the manager and he made it very clear that our issue wasn't his priority. He came to the table, offered to give him some burn gel, and then swiftly ran off to \"change TVs). I was irate. I flagged the manager down again. He came over, this time visibly frustrated, to see what I wanted. I thanked him for the gel, but I advised that was the least that could be done. He then went on to tell me that his employee told him that he had warned us about the hot plate (which was true, but the warning came after the injury had taken place). He agreed to comp our meal and gave us two $10 coupons for a future meal. Upon further review of the coupons I realized that they expired in 2016.  In any industry it is imperative to make the customer feel like a priority. They may not always be right (don't tell them that) but they should always feel important. My issue with Donnie was that he 1. made it clear that we weren't important, and 2. called us liars. I didn't need a free meal or expired coupons. I just wanted to feel cared about in this situation. Thankfully my boyfriend did not have to seek medical attention. Think twice before trying this establishment."}
{"text":"We don't have many options on this side of town yet. Tailgaters is a pretty good one. Keep in mind this is a sports bar, and yes I am more forgiving to a place like this. That being said, we have been really happy with the food and service at Tailgaters. My family and I have eaten the burgers, pizza, wraps, wings and salads multiple times and it has been consistently good. We have a few restaurants with similar menu items in the area and this is our go to place. The weekly specials are also pretty good. Lots of TV's and they are very accommodating if your game is not on."}
{"text":"Typical sports bar.  If you are looking for burgers, beer and a lot of TV's this is the place.  Nothing fancy.  Just good food at a fair price and a comfortable atmosphere."}
{"text":"We were a party of 7 and were seated immediately.  After 20 minutes we politely enquired at the front desk if it would be possible to get some service.  Of course they said.  15 minutes later with no service even on the horizon we walked out.  And it wasn't even busy.  Will never go back."}
{"text":"Tailgaters has amazing food and great server by the name of Jasper. Jasper has great customer service and care for his tables."}
{"text":"We love the pizza at this place. Food is always good. Service was a little lacking today. It will be back."}
{"text":"Cool environment to catch a game or a fight.  Management sucks.  Wait staff is poorly trained.  Tried to stick me with someone else bill just because we sat in a large group at some point during the evening.  Told me it was my problem.  I showed my tab and they agreed I paid my part but since the other $20 of food was in our group I was responsible about it.  The manager than proceeded to start up again in the parking lot while we were leaving.  Sad.  Very poorly handled by this company.  Lakeside Bar & Grill will be getting all of our game day business now."}
{"text":"The pizza and wings were both very good. Pizza wasn't greasy and the dough and crust were crisp. We had honey bbq wings. The sauce was very good and wings were cooked very well.  Will be going back."}
{"text":"This is a typical hangout and drink beers kind of place. Some of the food is good. I love the fries and the pizza is fine. My husband and I ordered the appetizer that has a little of everything and I was unimpressed with the fact that it's supposed to feed like 3 to 4 people but barely had enough for he 2 of us. There were only 2 potato skins, 3 mozzarella sticks, and I can't remember what else but like really?? On top of that we ordered wings and I don't understand why you only get 1 celery and w carrot with a dozen wings. I don't know any other pizza place that does that. Are we supposed to split them in half? I wish this place was better because it does have a lot to offer. On top of everything, our waitress forgot about us and they sent us another one and it took forever to get our drinks and it was just overall not the best experience."}
{"text":"I like coming here for pizza and wings.  I come in and get the pizza and wing special.  The pizza crust is not too thin and has a good taste.   We get the boneless wings for the kids (chicken nuggets). I prefer the bone in ones but then I have to eat them all myself.   They have a great selection of beer and lots of tvs to watch.  This is one of our regular places to come eat.  They have other items on the menu but mostly we get the pizza."}
{"text":"This place is super close to our house. We opted out of our favorite restaurant to try this one. I loved the Tailgaters on the west side, so figured this would be the same. The service was horrible. We had just moved into a new house and had not unpacked anything, had to dine in and was hungry. The food took forever because the waitress kept forgetting us. We probably would have ordered 2-3 more drinks as we like to sip on them, however she only came once for a drink order... when we tried to order more drinks she looked at us like a deer in the headlights (she was not super young) and came back with the appetizer (which was incorrect). Afterward we did mention the service to the manager and he offered us a gift card or something, we explained we didn't need anything- we just want the service better, so someone needs to know it needs to improve. The food wasn't the best to be honest.. pretty much bar food.. which isn't all that surprising. But not worth the money."}
{"text":"Our new local hang out.  Really good pizza and wings!!  Always have good service and they show UFC fights to boot, no cover... Get there early!!  Will be back soon!!"}
{"text":"I was really excited this restaurant opened few months ago in my neighborhood and I finally had a chance to try it. It's very big sports bar/restaurant with many many televisions at every angle. We were seated right away by the hostess and the waitress was really helpful in pointing out their specials.  We ordered various dishes to try. The food took a long time to arrive and the waitress came by and told us they had only 1 cook in the back. Oh my! They must've had at least a a dozen tables on a Saturday for lunch with 1 cook. Someone must've called in sick. When our food finally arrived, couple of dishes (personal pizza and appetizer) came out cold. The pizza, which the waitress recommended was a disappointment (very dry, small and cold). The appetizer sampler tasted like something I could've bought at the grocery store and reheated. The philly steak wasn't much better either. The meat was very dry and the melted cheese over it didn't help at all. The only thing decent was their spinach salad. It was fresh and the dressing was tasty.  Overall, I would come here to watch a game with a beer. I wouldn't for the good."}
{"text":"Great food, sooooooooo many TVs. I was amazed at the level of service when I went on a fight nighy"}
{"text":"With so few decent choices in the area, this place strikes me as a welcome addition.  Very nice appeal with clean, modern sports bar set up that includes a meandering bar, abundant TV's, and youthful female servers in tank tops and short shorts. Quite a few taps for beer drinkers, and the daily Happy Hours start at 10:30 am.  This is not a pretentious North Scottsdale place.  Very blue collar, to be as politically correct as I can.  Food was very slow to come out.  Service was sparse.  They seemed understaffed and/or servers are given too many tables to reasonably handle.  I thought happy hour food prices were not good value.  $6 apps, some if which are reduced portions (nachos), just isn't all that great.  Also, from what I saw, happy hour is for so called domestic beer only.  Craft beer drinkers... Tough luck"}
{"text":"Food is decent but service is too unpredictable. Went in for our schools spirit night tonight and was seated right away. Then waited, and waited, and waited. A waitress looked at us and said she'd be right there. She never came over. Didn't even get to order drinks. She saw us get up and walk out and could have cared less. If you have a special event, make sure you are properly staffed. Kids were super disappointed."}
{"text":"vann rocked!  Cowboys suck!  Lol.  Food was good sandwiches need  a bread that stands up better  Will be back and want Vann to wait on us again!"}
{"text":"DO NOT GET TAKEOUT!!!!  They have screwed up my order ever time!  Never again!!  Worst wings and pizza ever!!"}
