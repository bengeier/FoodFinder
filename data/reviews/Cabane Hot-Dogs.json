{"text":"Magnifique! Me suis fait plaisir hier soir à 2h ... Génial de la nourriture de qualité tard en soirée à petit prix!"}
{"text":"Deliciousness.   This place has been all I've been dreaming of. The place with so many choices of hot dogs and poutines that are so wonderful and tasty!  A small place where you can fill your stomach with delicious, greasy food and not care after, because it was so worth it."}
{"text":"It took the guy at least 20 minutes to make the order before us - 2 hot dogs. When I asked if the chili had beans, he said he didn't know & showed me the container to look for myself. When a customer  walked in 15 minutes before closing, he told them he wasn't taking any more orders. Horrible service!"}
{"text":"Staff was very friendly and explained to me every single option in their menu. I had the cabane dog with onion rings and it was delicious. Place is cozy and very clean (although the day I went felt pretty hot inside).   From the outside it didn't look very attractive and it is a bit hidden. I was biking in the area with a friend and she was the one who spotted the place and suggested that we should try it. I is certainly a place I would stop by if I was in the area."}
{"text":"A tad over priced in my opinion, and service wasn't exactly the most professional at the counter. Hot dog was definitely tasty, but make sure to tell them if you don't like you're poutine drowned in sauce."}
{"text":"I finally found this place on Yelp. I went to Montreal last summer and for the life of me, I couldn't remember the name of this place. My friend and I wanted a quick bite to eat when we were in Latin Quarters and we just happened to walk in here. The hotdogs look delicious here, but we had our eyes set on POUTINE! This was the jackpot for all the poutine places in Montreal. We opted for the sausage poutine and I immediately fell in love with it. The sausage reminds me of Taiwanese sausages but bigger, juicier and packed with more flavors. I will be back if I choose to come back to Montreal. The owner was super nice too, he knew we were tourist and gave us plenty of recommendations on where to go around the city."}
{"text":"Best hog dogs in Montreal!  The sausage is so juicy and the poutine is loaded with gravy. The decor is modern and cool.   Must try the signature cabane hot dog with maple syrup. Every time I go there the staff is friendly and the service is awesome.   Late hours in the summer time make this place quite convenient for evening snacks after drinking at the surrounding bars in the neighborhood. Please try it when your craving a good hot dog!!!!"}
{"text":"Ce fast-food tient bien son nom, c'est une petite cabane en hauteur sur la rue Saint-Denis près de Berri ! J'y suis allée avec quelques amis un vendredi soir et le restaurant était vide. Le cuisinier était seul dans le restaurant, on a donc été servi rapidement. C'etait pas mal et assez copieux.  Les prix sont abordables. Si tu veux passé un petit moment agréable sans trop dépenser, je te recommande cette place."}
