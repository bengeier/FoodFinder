{"text":"The Hoosier Mama pizza(diced pepperoni & sausage) is delicious as a thin crust. Lots of cheese & toppings. Friendly employees/owners. Another thing to note is pizzas they will do for a party. You can even get a birthday pizza with Dora The Explorer on it for your kids. How cool!"}
{"text":"The \"jumbo\" chicken wings must have come off of a pigeon, because they were tiny! The five cheese pizza was not very good, the crust was very chewy, and the pizza wasn't very cheesy at all. The Philly steak pizza on the other hand was pretty good.."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza for a great price! The first bite says it all! Delish!

Great specials too!"}
{"text":"We got a groupon deal for this place so we thought we would check it out.  Overall the food was good and we got a good quantity for what we paid.  We got a Margherita, a Champion Supreme and some wings.  The pizza's were OK but there was a distinct lack of ingredients on the outer rim of the Margherita.  I like pizza crust (to dip in sauce) but this was to much.  Fortunately they threw in some extra pizza sauce (on purpose?) so it made up for it a little.  I am not a fan of sausage and peperoni but the Supreme was well balanced with ingredients and others in the group seemed to like it. The pizza crust is pretty good, not greasy so that was a big plus.

We also ordered wings and their Gold Fever sauce.  The wings were a good size and were, well, wings.  The Fever sauce was fair but I am not a fan of buffalo chicken wings and that is what the Gold Fever reminded me of.  If you like buffalo wings then you will probably like their sauce.  Me?  I opted for some ranch so I was satisfied.  

I enjoyed their cheesey bread sticks, they had a good amount of garlic and that made them very good.  Hmmmm!  Garlic cheese bread sticks.

Since this place is to far for delivery we opted to pick the pizza up.  It is right on our way home from work so chances are we will stop in again."}
{"text":"I am giving Champion Pizza five stars for several reasons.  #1 - I eat here at least once a week, sometimes up to 3.  I don't have pizza every time, either.  It's pizza, then a sub, then wings...you get the picture.  #2 - the pizza is delicious.  Best sauce I've ever had.  The dough is delicious, and you don't even have to put it in ranch to eat it.  We love the Hoosier Daddy. Diced pepperoni?  Brilliant!  #3 - the Perfect Italian Sub.  I do NOT like sandwiches.  They bore me.  But the Perfect Italian Sub, I could eat every day.  They put this pepper relish on it that is just delicious.  Get it toasted and you will be in love!  #4 - the price.  Go to their website and check it out for yourself.  www.championpizzahenderson.com   #5 - the customer service.   They are always friendly.  You know some places where you go and the front counter person is just unhappy to be there (Five Guys)?  You don't get that here.  They are happy and friendly, and would bend over backwards to make sure you are happy, too."}
