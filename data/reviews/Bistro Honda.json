{"text":"We visited probably the second day they were open (last Thursday) and were impressed with the food.  The three of us had different dinner entrees and were all were good.  They say they are still working the kinks out, but overall for a brand new restaurant everyone in our group was pleased."}
{"text":"Welcome addition to the Northside! Ramen was great!! We also liked the takoyaki. Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Another Japanese restaurant opened. I tried to be first costomer for this place but they opened quietly so couldn't be. Last night I and wife, we had crispy outside creamy inside Takoyaki, Hibachi Flank Steak,  
Chicken Katsu Curry were wonderful. Only disappointment was server couldn't give us more tensions when we need it.  We are surely go back  again."}
{"text":"Small place on the Northside of Madison. Was very awkward when we first walked in but got greeted and seated. Only one server and it didn't seem like he had any experience as a waiter before, no biggie. Got the paper menu and water. Ordered the Deep Fried Gyoza, Garlic Chicken, Tiger Roll and Spicy Tonkastu Ramen. The gyoza and chicken came out 10 minutes after ordering.  After we finished our appetizers the rest of the food came out. Tiger roll was okay and the ramen was good. Got lots of noodles and the pork was very soft and fell apart. Good place to go but the service wasnt A1 for a small place."}
{"text":"First time here and very satisfied. Veggie ramen miso soup and a few sushi rolls. All excellent. Not a huge menu but I'm sure it'll expand as they get more business. We'll definitely return!!"}
{"text":"Food was great. Service was inattentive and inexperienced. Check was dropped halfway through dinner without a word. Never asked if we would like a second drink or dessert, but he just asked the only other table in the room if they would like dessert. 

We decided we were done with our dinner at that point. We put our card out. He came back and cleared a plate. Didn't take the card, didn't ask if we wanted boxes. 

He came back and walked passed our table. Meanwhile, only one other table had showed up. 

Waited, waited, waited. Never saw him
Again. Never got boxes. We threw some
Cash down and left. 

So disappointed because we very much liked the food. Won't return."}
{"text":"Started with the deep fried Gyoza (pot sticker).  Normally not a fan of deep fried anything, but this was not greasy, and so light!  Loved it!  Try this item!  I ordered Hibachi Steak Curry.  The dish was huge, enough for two.  I would describe it as a cross between a beef stew and curry dish.  The meat and mushrooms were one side on top of rice, the curry sauce on the other side, where I found potatoes and carrots in the sauce.  I'm glad the sauce was on the side so I could control portions.  My dining mate had Garlic Shrimp Udon noodles.  Noodles were homemade we think.  Said it was tasty, but they would have liked even more garlic.
We will return to try other items.  Wait staff is getting better and was pretty good last night.  Hey, people gotta learn!"}
{"text":"We went here for lunch.  Nobody else in the restaurant so service was fast.  My boyfriend and I shared the potstickers, spicy tuna, and Seattle roll.  All were really good. Prices I noticed have gone up from the menu picture someone posted.  Everything seems to be on the pricy side.  We will definitely be back in the future tho!"}
{"text":"I just discovered Bistro Honda today. Absolutely amazing food and I'm so glad it's on the North side. I had the spider roll and the garlic shrimp yaki udon and was not disappointed. Absolutely delicious. Staff is very considerate too."}
{"text":"I had the chicken katsu curry and it was quite good.  They were open to make a custom sushi roll and it came to us quickly and was delicious.  The service was nice and it feels like they are still getting used to everything.  There were some people that came in for takeout and they were waiting for quite some time for their food.

My only complaint is that the straws that were given to us weren't in wrappers and were placed directly on the table that was just wiped off.  I know it's minor but hopefully they see this and change this."}
{"text":"This is a jewel of a Japanese restaurant.  Creative, beautiful and the service is attentive."}
{"text":"Ok here's the thing. Some of the food is awesome. So delicious. 

The service was attentive yet they didn't seem to know what to do. Like we had to ask for a bowl to place empty edamame pods in. Also had to ask for a little bowl for soy sauce for sushi dipping. One beer came out then the three others arrived like 10 min later. We had one waiter then it switched to another but they were still both there and ...  the place had only a few tables filled. 

The Spicy Tonkatsu Raman was soooo good and our friend really liked the Shrimp Sushi Bowl. My Seattle roll and Cucumber roll were meh. I mean a cucumber roll is pretty basic so shouldn't fall apart, right? 

So go with the bowls, skip the rolls. Be prepared for odd table service or here is an idea - get it delivered."}
{"text":"This is a great addition to the North side!!! But with it being new, it definitely has room for improvement.

My Hubs and I ordered edamame, takoyaki, a poke burrito roll, a hotel California roll, the Spicy Tonkatsu Ramen, which came with a side of fried (or white) rice, and a large sake. All of this for roughly $50 -- what a deal! I was impressed with the takoyaki and thought the burrito roll was well worth it! Unlike other sushi burritos I've had, this was not over-filled with rice. My two proteins were tuna and salmon, and both portions were good and the roll was fresh! Will definitely be coming back for the poke burrito roll! The ramen was average, but we found it interesting to come with a side of rice. Not bad for $12.50! 

The service was a bit odd but she may have been new. No introduction, and when we told her this was our first time, she just said oh. The food came out in a timely manner and she cleared our dishes as we finished. Asked if we wanted boxes, gave us our check and no mention of dessert. Luckily, we were stuffed!

I also noticed they have a karaoke room available! Fun!!

Overall, I like this spot for the prices and food is good. I wouldn't say the best sushi in town, but a good variety of menu items for sure! Service needs improvement. Will most likely order carry out next time!"}
{"text":"Ordered sushi from here. The delivery took a long time but it was a weekend night and I think they only have one driver. The sushi was good; it was just . . . bland. I had to put a lot of soy sauce on it, and we only got one container of that with the delivery, but two each of wasabi and ginger. I would have liked to have equal amounts of all condiments. The fish itself was fresh, the rolls were well made, and the portions were big.

The menu is very small. When I'm writing this, they have not been open for even three months yet. My impression is more of a place that is just finding its legs. I want to go back and try the ramen soon, but I think I will wait a few months before I order sushi again."}
{"text":"What a welcome addition to the north side of Madison.  Bistro Honda is a cute and authentic Japanese restaurant with great entrees and staff!

Housed in a former coffee shop, the restaurant is small but they had no trouble accommodating our group of five, quickly pulling together several tables in the front window.  It was a little chilly sitting there in winter but will be a lovely spot once spring shows up.

The menu was a bit limited, but still have enough options for the sushi and meat lover alike.  Sushi rolls included both raw and cooked options and even one with beef!  For the meat eaters in the group, there were several hibachi options including the \"Frank Steak\" which was a typo on the menu -- that should have been \"Flank Steak\".

As a sushi lover, I got Tiger Roll which had tempura ship and the Zen Roll which had raw tuna and salmon.  Both were excellent and included the standard soy sauce, ginger and wasabi.  Hubby opted for the steak which was grilled with mushrooms and was served with white rice and a green salad.  

All portions were very generous for the price as well and staff kept our water glasses full.  Staff is still learning the ropes but the food still came out timely.

Finally, a fun bonus was some free Japanese snacks at the end.  Hubby got Pocki (wafer sticks) and I got some Starburst like candy.  Yum!

Their menu is small but sufficient right now, however, they note more items are coming.  I can't wait to go back to see what they add!"}
{"text":"Nice waitress and delicately prepared food. Large portions, so go with an appetite! Takes a little time, so plan for an hour or so. If you're looking for a recommendation, the Miso Ramen was had by most of my group and it was really good."}
{"text":"Okay, I finally got a taste of their food. 

Walking in, I was immediately greeted and sat down with their menu and I notice that their menu is actually full compared to the first time I went which is great, they had varieties of ramen, sushi and main course dishes such as katsu curry and hibachi. 

Our waiter was very attentive with us and took our orders, my boyfriend ordered the poke don and the spicy tuna and I ordered the tiger roll and maybe there's only one cook there(?) because we got our food one by one, maybe about 5 minutes between each dish, but at least we got our food unlike last time, right? 

The sushi was delicious, though, I have to admit was a bit too dressed in sauce which mutes the flavor of everything else in the roll, and be prepared to take big bites because the roll has quite a bit more than usual amount of rice, but that's not a problem for me because I love rice. I loved how the spicy tuna roll had jalape√±o sliced on top, it was different than most sushi places around here (usually, the spicy tuna rolls are minced tuna, dressed with spicy mayo).

Our last dish, the poke don was delicious! I did find it kind of weird that it had strawberries, but it actually worked with the whole dish. One of the workers (maybe the owner?) came by to check on us and gave us spoons so it'll be easier to dig in, he was really kind and thanked us personally for eating his food.

Overall, I would give it a 3.5, the food was good but the rate at the food coming out is a bit odd for me."}
{"text":"Its a welcome surprise for them to open in Northport.
The menu doesn't have a ton of selection yet. But the menu says they are adding more. The food is great not the best in town. But for the value and its distance from me. Id be visiting it often. I really enjoyed the chicken katsu curry. Its a pretty hefty serving. The takoyaki is a definite must to order. Theres 5 balls a serving. Sushi is pretty good. Just a couple selections tho. Zen roll is pretty good. 

Their Parking shares with all other shops in the area. So don't be surprise if you might have to park far."}
{"text":"I'm happy to see a new restaurant on the Northside. Our group got spicy ramen, the chicken katsu bowl, and the beef bowl and everything was delicious. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"So glad they are FINALLY open!

My husband and I tried Bistro Honda for the first time tonight (a Sunday night). It was pretty quiet. The server we had was very friendly (though I'm guessing new to serving but hey, we all have to start somewhere).

We ordered the fried gyoza, flank steak hibachi, a California roll, and a steak roll (name escapes me at the moment). The order things came out was a little odd (first hibachi, then California roll, then gyoza, then steak roll), but the hibachi steak was DELICIOUS, and a pretty hefty portion for the price. Both of the rolls were very good too, though the California roll was definitely my favorite of the two. Even my sushi-disliking spouse liked the steak roll, and they about had to roll us out when we were done, we were so full.

Patient Madisonians, find your way over to Bistro Honda and enjoy some fantastic food while they hit their stride on the service side. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"My husband and I had dinner at the restaurant today. As soon as we walked in at 4:20 we were told \"we are not open for another 10 mins\" (regardless of their hours being 11-9 on social media and the open sign) i was ready to walk out because who does this?! You are a new establishment you take the business you get. If you are going to succeed, it's going to be based off quality food  and excellent customer service.

The service was pretty horrible, we were never asked how the food was or if we wanted another beverage. My husbands food came out 30 mins before mine and we received no apologies for the slow service. 
I eventually had to get up and ask for the check. I would understand if they were swamped but we were the only ones being waited on.

Food was delish but i rather spend more and go to Red Sushi downtown because they have excellent service."}
{"text":"Stopped in for carry out. I didn't have great expectations after reading some of the reviews, but I wanted to try it out. I was really hoping for a great Japanese restaurant on the north side of town and, unfortunately, this isn't it. 

I was promptly greeted by a friendly server. He didn't have much experience, but he tried his best. The menu is pretty limited (I didn't see any poke on it) so I tried two rolls. The Tiger roll was the better of the two, but I wouldn't order it again. The spicy tuna roll was covered in mayo and that dominated the flavor profile. Even after I wiped as much of it off with a napkin, it's still mostly what I tasted. I ended up finishing the Tiger roll but threw 1/3 of the tuna roll away."}
{"text":"Slowest service ever.  We've tried carry out (50 mn wait at 6:30), delivery  (30 mn late) and eating in. I wish they would get their act together and hire enough help  because the food is decent but the service is poor. We did a carry out at 8pm and they almost would not serve. Apparently they wanted to go home even though they close at 9. They weren't very nice about it either. So the bottom line is don't go there after 8 and be prepared to wait  longer than other places"}
{"text":"Pretty good Japanese food, friendly staff.  Sushi was a bit cheaper then usual, fresh and made well. Udon was good, with generous portions. Gyoza was nicely fried and crispy. No side if rice on the menu yet, so they just gave me some. Nice decor, little Japanese jello things when you leave."}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner. We were really excited to have a Japanese spot nearby. The menu was not complete. They weren't even done decorating when we visited (a few weeks ago). We had grilled flank steak and the shrimp tempura bowl. Both were edible but neither were great. We also had a sushi roll for appetizer, which arrived after our main courses.

Because they weren't really fully up and running, we're going to try again in a month or so. Hopefully the menu will be fully developed and they'll have a fully equipped and stocked kitchen (with an actual dedicated chef)."}
{"text":"Super good teriyaki chicken. Didn't seem much of a Japanese restaurant when you walk in but the food made up for it."}
{"text":"Wonderful service . Excellent dishes. Servings huge. Can't wait to go back. Nice causal atmosphere."}
