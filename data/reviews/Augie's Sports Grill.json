{"text":"Came here for the first time today and the service was absolutely amazing. Matt the bartender greeted me with a smile that could light up the room. His vast knowledge and experience was truly impressive. He was very attentive and made sure everything was to my liking. I will definitely be coming back real soon."}
{"text":"Hands down the worst meal I have every had. The beer prices are great at happy hour, but the food is awful. We had nachos, wings & pizza. We could not eat any of the food. Left most of it on our plates. 
I won't be returning!"}
{"text":"This place is great. Very nice without that big corporate feel. My husband and I started with a dozen hot wings. They were very fresh but not \"hot\"....pretty mild in fact. However, that is the only semi-negative thing I can say. The burgers we ordered were excellent! My husband ordered the Go Bleu with steak fries and I ordered the Border Burger with sweet potato fries. Both were cooked perfectly and very tasty. We did need a box because it was more than we could finish. 
Our server, Ashleigh, was very friendly and very attentive. We couldn't have asked for better service. We WILL be back."}
{"text":"The BBQ wings are good, but the 12 wings only come with a tiny little cup  of ranch.,  if you request more they charge you for it.  How petty is that?"}
{"text":"This a great little neighborhood sports bar.  It's our go-to place for UFC events.  The place is clean & comfortable, with a nice ambiance and we've always had good service (even on crazy fight nights when the placed is packed).  We have found the prices to be a little high for a sports bar style menu, but when you consider they don't charge a cover fee for UFC events & sometimes have coupons, it's not too bad.

The food isn't 5 star amazing, but it's pretty solid for a joint like this.  We've tried probably about half the stuff on the menu in the years we've been visiting Augie's.  For the appetizers, the egg-roll-wrapped mozz sticks & pretzel sticks are the best of the bunch.  Their wings are run-of-the-mill & sadly they don't offer variable heat levels on the buffalo style (it's a soft medium IMO).  The burgers & sandwiches are mostly good, but not exceptional.  The best things on the menu are the ribs & pizza.  The ribs are baked/grilled style rather than smoked, but they're super tender with a sweet sauce & fall off the bone.  The pizza is probably our favorite thing at Augie's.  If fact, I'd even say I was kinda shocked at how good it was when we first tried it.  The crust is a bit bready, but it really works with the sauce & cheese they use.  It's definitely worth a try.  Pro tip - order it \"well done\" to get a nice slightly charred edge.  For dessert, the chocolate brownie sundae thing is surprisingly awesome.  It's simple, but good & surely plentiful.

All in all, we're lucky to have a joint like this out in the far west valley.  They have friendly service, show UFC fights for free, and the food is above-average for this kind of place."}
{"text":"Well, I was kind of excited trying this place out because it looks like a nice place from the outside but it turned out to be just a Meh experience.  My wife had a burger and salad, and I had some wings.  The wings were good sized but the taste was just ok.  My wife's burger was cooked good (med. - med. rare) but the bun was really hard.  She ended up taking the bun off.  The prices here seemed really high for the type of food, I can think of several places to go where the food is better and it would not of cost as much.  Would I go here again, probably not.  I would definitely not go out of my way."}
{"text":"Augies has a great happy hour, with half price appetizers. I go here just for the southwestern chimi's... they are delicious!"}
{"text":"I came here for a nice lunch with my boyfriend expecting a decent sports bar, classic delicious greasy food and watch the game. What we got was Celsea- a friendly enough waitress that really should learn to use a pen and paper to place orders. Got my boyfriends food completely wrong with nothing of what he asked for, we got side dishes we never asked for and when the bill came was expected to pay it. I will not pay for a mistake not my own. We were up charged for a warm au ju sauce, really? French dip usually comes with warm au ju sauce. Anyways, no wonder it was dead but yet our food still took forever. Save yourself the money and the disappointment go somewhere worth spending your hard earned cash."}
{"text":"My favorite watering hole. A haven for regulars. Amazing bartenders.. Derek, Brett, Dacota, and Katt.  The most amazing thing about this place is a server named Bre. She is from Michigan but we won't hold that against her :P The place would not be the same without her incandescent smile and warming nature. Not to mention her right hook... Ouch. Right John?
Seriously though stop in for a beer cheer on Ohio State and enjoy a lovely meal"}
{"text":"Our first visit here to watch our Steelers play. Great friendly place.  Autumn was our server and was so good. She always checked to see how we were doing even though she was busy. Our food was very good and served quickly. And can't say enough about how pet friendly they are. Made sure our fur kid was comfy. We will recommend Augies to others and will definitely be back. Thanks to everyone there!!"}
{"text":"Descent food, great drinks and outstanding management.  The manager was so observant to what his customers needed and what his staff was doing.  Great job."}
{"text":"Ok so I live right down the street and I would say I've been to a fair amount of bars and restaurants and clubs being 21 anyways I always would drive by this place and always wanted to give it a try I'm a sporty kind of girl so a co worked said augies was awesome so we went we had drinks till they closed I order a margarita it was awesome they add orange juice which is supper good and they were giving out prizes for doing shots I declined lol but I order the mozzeralla sticks they were bomb.com they were so good they were wrapped in a egg roll it was different but really good service and staff were awesome fast the bar was clean there were families singles couples and even some senior citizens so I loved it so much I took my husband we sat at the bar the bartender was on it the bar was full and we were never left with an empty glass we tipped her very good one of the best bartenders I have seen with awesome service I had an pizza husband had a burger which he loved since as a man that's all he eats the place was packed but there was room at the bar I felt super comfty everyone was happy and having a good time it was a Thursday evening they had an band who played Zach brown and country favorites and other bar favorites they were awesome wish we could o stayed longer ... Also if u really think ur gunna be able to go to any bar and watch a fight for free ur crazy these other negative reviews r one of many good reviews I have gone twice and have never had bad luck same with my friends I recommend this place way better then native new yorker!!!! Love love augies new place for drinks:)"}
{"text":"This place is our Cheers! Great staff, cold beer, and well-above-average food. (Get the Reuben... or the southwestern eggrolls... or the Augie Dog... or the pizza...)"}
{"text":"I've eaten here a few times while watching bands and that's a fun experience. I will say up front I'm not a sports bar kind of girl, so that dozens of TV's all tuned to sports isn't my thing, and of course does impact my review. The food is really great, though. The pretzel buns they use for the burgers are amazing. And my Mom swears by their pizza when she comes out to visit. They're a bit pricey, but always have coupons in the val-pak, so you can get discounts at least. Average overall, not my favorite place, but definitely not my least favorite, either."}
{"text":"This place really packs them in. One big positive is the Wait staff was really attentive to all it's patrons. Negatives .... Very average food. Wings were definitely a frozen product and tasted like it too. Patty Melt was really average. Burger... Meh, take it or leave it. Seems like this place could do a lot better food quality wise. Outside patio was a plus due to some great spring weather. One large table of guys were WAY OVERSERVED on cocktails. The shots and drinks kept coming even though they were clearly wasted, cussing up a storm and clearly obnoxious. Other customers trying to have a meal and conversation were clearly uncomfortable but management never did a thing to stop the madness! This place is clearly heading for a lawsuit if they don't stop over serving the booze when some idiot gets back in his car and causes a bad if not deadly accident. What a shame!"}
{"text":"For me, this place ROCKS. The outdoor patio allows me to have my cigar, Coors Lite, and get my read on. Oh, very good menu....."}
{"text":"OK so hers the deal with augies, its a 5 star joint with a 10000 grade rating.  The staff, including the mangers are spot on, and just overall bad ass! You need to come Down and see what all the fun is about."}
{"text":"Great food, we had the pretzels with jalapeño cheese, egg rolls with ranch, pulled pork, and 3 tasty types of nachos. Yummm. Our bartender was great, offered good drink suggestions from Bartender Matt. Good experience with friend on a night out."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times when it was busy. Got good service and friendly servers. I went there on a Sunday afternoon when it was slow with young new bartender. I sat at the bar while she flirted with a couple roided out guys she was hooked on. I finally just left. I would be back but just was not loving the Sunday afternoon service."}
{"text":"just like the customer above stated.  I went to watch the UFC fights and had never been charged a cover before.  This night was different.  After my wife and I ate and I had a few beers, the server told us they were adding $10 to the bill for the fights.  When I questioned her about it and told her that no one mentioned a cover charge, she got smart and asked us \"where do you go that doesn't have a cover charge?\"  I told her not to put the added $10 on my card, she did it anyways.  I will never go back there again and do not feel anyone should go there.  In this economy, a young company such as Augies's should be going out of their way to make customer's happy to get them to come back, but they obviously don't care about their customers.  Just the money the customers bring.  The food is not good for the price you pay and the service is the worst service I have ever received.  DO NOT GO THERE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  If you do, you will be sorry you did."}
{"text":"Great food.  Good service.  Besides the music being a bit overwhelming and the bar not being large enough, a great place."}
{"text":"another yelp recommendation that i am glad i followed.  place was very clean, staff friendly and fast and food was good.  other than having my ncaa brackets blown up, good place to watch the tournament.  truly a hidden gem!"}
{"text":"Matt was the best bartender ever! Such great service I will be back just to see him!!!"}
{"text":"Great little sports bar. Amazing wings and decent happy hour prices. What more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"Loooooved the food here!!! Good looking people, I was surrounded by smiles! Good drinks, darn good service, much much better than Red Lobster and that Stuart guy there. I have never chosen a bar over a restaurant but bar none the better place to get good food with better service. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Bad Food and Worse Service.  I don't think that they like or want customers.  We waited for 10 minutes to get seated, another 10 minutes for our waitress to come by and 40 more minutes for our food.  No explanation, no apology.  I'm not one who likes to complain but when I mentioned our disappointment to the night manager, he told me that if I didn't like my experience, I didn't have to come back.  I think I'll take his advice."}
{"text":"Phenomenal customer service, clean and upbeat.  Great place to come and hang out.  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"My Fiancé and myself went to Augie's for the first time, we really enjoyed our meal . Justin the manager really made us feel welcome and he made us laugh. He recommended the Suzie Kabloosie  I think the name was  we also ordered the calamari and a burger .  The food was amazing the atmosphere was fun \"thanks to Justin\" and his recommendations ! We would recommend Augie's to anyone ! We will be attending again ! Thank you Justin!"}
{"text":"Nice traditional sports bar with standard sports bar food and a few twists.  portions were pretty big.  Good bar options, friendly staff, nice outside patio area with a fire pit.  multiple tvs viewable from every table that I could see."}
{"text":"Beware! Do NOT come to Augie's with a group larger than 4.  Only one table for 6 and the hostesses have no clue how to think ahead to combine tables. Told us didn't know how long and we waited for over 70 minutes to get seated. The food is good here but definitely not worth the"}
{"text":"My family and I love this place! We've been coming here for a while and everyone is always so nice and attentive! They recognize us and they remember what we order even if we don't come in in a while! They make the best Micheladas, the environment is awesome for the whole family. We love to come and watch our favorite games and even the food is great! Also, Dani  is great! Give this girl a raise!!"}
{"text":"Stumbled on this place while staying nearby on vacation. Everything was amazing. Wonderful mac n cheese, pizza is outstanding and the ranch is super good. Sliders were perfect!
Overall great atmosphere and great food. Love band on Saturday and happy hour from 3-7 everyday."}
{"text":"The bar staff is attentive, friendly & knowledgeable. The bar & dining area itself is kept up & clean. The music is good too. It's piped in or live depending on the day/time you go. 
All of this is why I gave this Meh vs. Eek. 
The food tastes like everything is precooked & warmed/deep fried on premises. Nothing tastes fresh or creative but you pay as if it were. Go to happy hour & get apps on special expecting precooked deep fried food & you'll be happy because the atmosphere & staff rock it. Food... not so much."}
{"text":"I ordered the waffle fries with a blue cheese burger. Burger was ok, but fries extremely salty. Nice service nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"Augies was recommended by a friend and said it was a great small mom and pop place.. The food was great for a bar and grill and the service at least on my first visit was great.  

Love the pretzels and the hamburgers on a pretzel bun.  The beer selection is respectable.  

Definitely the place to go if you are tired of the buffalo wild wings and other places that are overrun by annoying punks and loud mouths during ball games."}
{"text":"They must have listened, a much better experience this time around. My last visit they had small portions and used small drink glasses that were not refilled while we ate. This time the portions are larger and they used a larger drink glass and she brought refills while we ate.

The food was good and we enjoyed our time here. We'll be back."}
{"text":"We used to be regulars before we hit the road for a year! Now this is the go to place when we are home! All the food is delicious! Even breakfast! Never been disappointed!"}
{"text":"My husband and I are locals and have been to this location several times. The food is decent and the service is decent. I do like when they host events like fights or even New Year's Eve. They have s large patio which I'm sure is larger than the whole inside which is nice for those events and they have a great fire pit."}
{"text":"I am not sure where to start......  After meeting some friends for a bbq my wife suggested that we stop for a few drinks at Augie's. 

 We arrived about 8:15 and the place was pretty busy.  We found a seat at the bar and ordered a couple of beers and cheese sticks.  I guess they didnt hear our order because we received Pretzels and cheese instead.  Not a big deal but WTF.... 

 They had music playing and a customer who looked somewhat like Jabba the Hut (seriously) wasnt satisfied with the volume turned it up many times and the staff kept turning it down.  This was happening while many families were there trying to enjoy there meals.

This bar came complete with a overweight drunk girl that was making her way around the bar and kissing multiple guys and trying to jam her tongue as far down their throat as possible.  She apparently was friends with the young female bartender who continued to watch her and give her shots.  I guess I expect this at other places such as Roman's Oasis but what a treat to see this while enjoying a few beers and Pretzels.  

Dont stop reading......  We are just getting to the good part.   

I noticed a drunk young guy sitting at the end of the bar.  He had a baseball cap on and his face was very red.  His eyes were closed from time to time while he was waiting for his friends to return.  I could tell he was trashed...  I told my wife to take and look and sure enough when she did, he threw up a little bit on the bar and his hand.  He cleaned it up a bit but just sat there.   I told both the bartenders and they did NOTHING....   A few minuted later he had major projectile vomit at the bar.    I told the manager (who apparently couldnt see what we were watcing) and he went to talk to the customer.  The manager asked him to leave but I guess in not a very forceful way because the customer finished his beer and then left.   

The end of our incredible visit was capped off by the following event.  The bartender came and told me that \"the guy at the end of the bar wants to buy you a drink\".  I asked \"does he want to buy me a drink or my wife?\".  She stated that he wanted to buy us both a drink.  I told her \"no thank you\".  My wife went to the restroom shortly after this and \"the guy at the end of the bar\" followed her.  He returned before she did and came over to talk to me.  He explained that he was a regular at the bar and continued talking to me about a bunch of nonsense and soon I just ignored him until he left.  I am confused why a self proclaimed college student would want to buy us drinks. 

This place needs help...   I am not sure the owner knows this is going on.  If the owner is the manager I spoke to, then he is in way over his head.   

It will not survive.....  If it does, it wont be from me spending money there."}
{"text":"This was my first time here..Food was delicious and the service was exceptional. (Try there Jalapeno Margarita, YUM!) A manager even came around and greeted tables. Now that's what I call COSTUMER SERVICE!! Definitely coming back!!!"}
{"text":"Not much here. Ordered a couple of beers decided on some wings. Only 3 choices BBQ, Jerk and traditional buffalo. Ordered buffalo and no surprise the wings were scrawny with very little meat on them and the sauce was way too hot for traditional. Seems they added a lb of cayenne powder to the sauce. 

Bottom line save your $$ go somewhere else.."}
{"text":"YOU HAVE TO TRY THIER RIBS!!!!! So tender you can eat with a fork! I think it's Their Friday deal. 

The bartenders are amazing. Always makes your drinks on point! So many regulars there! We go there so much."}
{"text":"We had a coupon from the local mailer and decided to stop by for a bite.

First off, pretty good atmosphere, the place was hopping and we had to wait a few minutes to get an open table. Exactly how I like my restaurants.

They had a small selection of beers but had our favorites, including a Guiness for me and Woodchuck Cider for my wife. On happy hour, both were 3 bucks for a pint. Not bad at all.

I had the fish and chips special, which was a couple small hushpuppies, two large pieces of beer battered cod, and fries. Fish was cooked perfectly and was very tasty.

My wife had the buffalo chicken sandwich and onion rings. The rings were a bit greasy, but the sandwich was excellent. On top of their pretzel \"bun\" was two huge  chicken breast dredged in the perfect buffalo sauce. Almost enough food for two people to share.

Overall we had a great experience and will definitely be back with friends to dine."}
{"text":"Moved here from Buffalo and have been unbelievably unimpressed with the restaurants in Phoenix BUT Auggies has been the best restaurant I have been to yet. Not great, but good food. They have trivia nights and performers while you eat depending on the night. Definitely will continue to come here."}
{"text":"This is the place where regulars are family and infrequent visitors are welcome house guests. Try the Susie kablooz on a pretzel bun, you will not be be disappointed."}
{"text":"Overpriced greasy food..dark ambiance.. Not vibing with it or the overpriced meals.. Better out there"}
{"text":"Please clean up your patio and make it a more fun place to hang out. The folding chairs are lame. Spend a few dollars and put together a nice patio for people to enjoy. The inside is fabulous and your menu is great!"}
{"text":"I've eaten at this place twice and have had mixed experiences.  My first time was good enough for a return visit. The second time, well, didn't quite live up to my expectations. My first visit was on a weekday in the middle of the afternoon and the place was dead. Service was good and I had a club sandwich and a salad and everything was very good. The sandwich was large with generous portions of meat. The salad was excellent quality for a sports bar and the dressing was fantastic. Our second visit we went for happy hour and the place was a zoo. There was a table of about 20 people who probably worked together making all kinds of racket and several women were noticeably drunk and obnoxiously loud. The NBA Finals were on and I actually I had to ask the waitress to put the game on, which was also kind of annoying. Its a sports bar for crying out loud! I was very hungry. We ordered wings and when our waitress brought them out I immediately lost my appetite. They looked disgusting. I tried one and couldn't even finish it. They had freezer burn, small and bony and the sauce was peculiar too. My girlfriend thought they were fine and I let her eat them and ordered some chicken tenders. The tenders turned out good, but between the wings and the noise I was too thrilled about my visit. Also,  the TV's they have a very nice, but the layout of the restaurant limits your viewing pleasure. Many tables and booths don't offer good views. My family lives right around the corner from this place so I may return to watch a game there, but I would only give it one more chance. Probably not recommended."}
{"text":"We are here before heading to the movies.  Our waitress was efficient and on top of her game.  We had the nachos, Santa fe eggrolls...loved the food"}
{"text":"We had the pleasure of eat at Augie's tonight and glad we did!  Very good food and the pretzel buns are awesome!  I had a buffalo chicken sandwich and wife had the chili burger and we were both very impressed.  Good service, high quality food, more flat panel TV's that you could shake a stick at, very nice decor (even in the bathrooms!)
We have a cat named Auggie so kinda cool to visit \"her place\" :)

We got to meet the owner and seemed very appreciative to have patrons (as he should) and seem genuine in asking for feedback on our meals."}
{"text":"The friendly bartenders here not only remember my name and favorite drink, but always help me find a seat on crowded UFC fight nights.  Thanks Dakota and Brett for always doing a great job!"}
{"text":"Just arrived from St Louis to Arizona and had to get a new drivers license. Waitress refused to accept a state ID as proper identification? And she was even younger looking than me. Had already been seated and ordered before she came rumbling saying she could not serve me or my father. Won't ever be back. Horrible service."}
{"text":"First time in the place and it came recommended by a few locals. Can't complain about the attentive service and good food. Looks like the place to hang out in the area compared to its neighboring competition. I'll definitely be back and often. The only thing I would hope they change is their selection of beer. A few more taps adding anything other than the basic domestic stuff would be nice. Place is average size and I'm told the place packs up real fast."}
{"text":"I dropped into Augie's about 10pm Saturday night because as I drove past, the outdoor patio was jammed with people dancing to a live band which sounded great.  While clean and easily accessible, my first opinion once inside was, Yep... its a sports bar.

The live band I have since been told, was named \"Thaddeus Rose\" playing 70s to modern top 40s music and was really great! Had the crowd of very mixed ages (children as well) dancing, laughing and enjoying themselves when I arrived.     

The help was friendly offering me a drink and a menu a few minutes after I sat down.  I might add, it would have been better to get my order immediately rather than leave me sitting there - uncomfortably alone and empty handed - for a few minutes to long.  If I had NOT been alone, it would not have mattered as much.  

The beer was ice cold however and once I got my first beer, the staff was great, offering a menu as well.  If you are a sports fan, you'll love all the games and sporting events displayed on the televisions surrounding the bar and eating area. 

The prices on food and drinks seemed alright but again, I did not sample any food here so I can not comment on that aspect but the atmosphere was nice and not to loud. (at least inside by the bar.).

On a sided note, the mens' bathroom was out of hand towels so I had the pleasure of air drying my hands, on my pants.  

It is NOT the kind of place I'd bring a first date but I plan on going back with friends to watch a game or two and do some drinking."}
{"text":"1 of the best family owned restaurants in the west valley! My family of 4 has now gone to this restaurant 3 times. It's been consistent in service and quality of food. I highly recommend the steak salad and the Rueben sandwich. My toddlers love the Alfredo pasta with broccoli on the adult menu. Every time we go in it's busy with regulars and new customers yes service is always quick. Prices are also really reasonable, overall great place!"}
{"text":"Great little sports bar with food to match, treated us great even when we showed up
With thirteen people with no warning. Beer was cold An food was hot with excellent service! Highly recommended..."}
{"text":"Great service , beer selection. Food was ok ' very welcoming to spring training travelers . Not far from Indians park ."}
{"text":"We loved Augie's. We searched Yelp for a place to eat in Goodyear before the Reds Spring Training Game. May have seen the hardest working bartender I've ever seen. The dude had all of the tables in the bar area, a packed bar and he was pouring drinks right and left and still gave us 5 star attention and service. My brother ordered the wings...pretty solid. I had an order of onion rings...& I've had better but I was just looking for a little snack to go with my beer. Everyone else in the place seemed to be enjoying themselves. The couple behind us ordered a pizza and said it was some of the best they've ever had. Augie's was pretty awesome for a couple of guys who were headed to a ballgame."}
{"text":"The staff is attentive and helpful. We brought our kids one night to get dinner. Our food was predictably bar food- fried and heavy but not bad. We visited on a week night and they had a musician playing. We literally could not talk at our table. It was so incredibly loud we couldn't even hear each other. I am giving 3 stars only because of service. 
I would give 2 stars for the ambiance and because I wouldn't go here for date night or with my kids for dinner. It would be great just to watch a game or to go with someone you don't want to talk to."}
{"text":"I've been here many times. The food is fantastic and I've never had a bad meal. It seems to get better every time I go. It's great to have a non-chain sports bar so close. I love the weekend specials and the ribs are off the charts delicious."}
{"text":"My son was playing baseball at the Reds facility on Sunday so I needed a place close to the field to watch the Patriots vs Miami. Augie's was perfect ! Close to the field plenty of TV's. The food was decent and all servers and bartenders were friendly.

Augie's is also fan friendly ! ( Every team was represented during the AM games)"}
{"text":"Horrible place to watch the NFL playoffs!! With about 25 tv's they only have 5 tv's with the game on. Thought this is supposed to be. Sports bar!! Not coming here again to watch any NFL games. Even asked the younger owner and he wouldn't change the tv's or put the sound on to at least here the game."}
{"text":"Cool sports bar in Goodyear. The team there is very friendly and attentive. The Jerk flavored wings are a must try!"}
{"text":"Went on a night that they had a live band on the patio.....was a nice atmosphere. Drinks were good but food was just okay. May go back if other places are too busy."}
{"text":"One of the only sports bars in the area. I usually stop by for the excellent patio. It's my favorite place when on that side of town to sit outside, watch a game and drink a beer."}
{"text":"We went with friends a couple of nights ago.   I swear that our server, Angelica, was 50 watts short of a 100 watt bulb.  First off, her hair was down and she kept playing with it and touching silverware and standing over our table.  Why was her hair not pulled back?  She made so many mistakes.  She was clueless on the menu.  
The upside:  The food was very good.  I would go back for the food.  Angelica definitely needs training and direction."}
{"text":"good little spot. I was in from LA for the weekend so this was my first time here and I ave to say. it was pretty good. wasn't to hungry so just shared some apps and had a beer but, everything was really good, from the hostess to the food, everything was good. I had an amazing white chocolate ale recommended by the waitress and even the glass was beer clean. give it a try, you'll be happy you did"}
{"text":"This place has awesome burgers. Definitely, one of the best burgers in town. If you are in the mood for a burger and fries, this is the place to try.  Have not tried anything else on the menu so I really can't rate the other food. I'll keep coming back for the burgers!"}
{"text":"Lunch was yum! Service was awesome! Atmosphere was charming! First visit...recommended"}
{"text":"Augie's was an okay sports bar with nice, attentive staff. Happy Hour had some good specials, and the space is comfortable. Why not more stars? 

In two words: the food. Offerings are standard bar fare, but sub-par in flavor and quality, never mind creativity. I had wings, which were overdone, sad little things, over-sauced and chewy. The buffalo chicken sandwich was much better, but still...

IMHO, they could use a bit more attention to the menu, but maybe it's what the masses are looking for."}
{"text":"Great food and service a hidden gem. There is also live music on Saturday nights. Their menu has some of the best pizza I have had since leaving the East Coast. The portions are generous and the staff keeps the drink refills coming. You should also try the burgers on pretzel buns, this is not fast food burger for sure."}
{"text":"Definitely on the short list of local establishments; Augie's has great food, cold drinks and kick-ass service by staff that understands customer service."}
{"text":"Not crowded, was sat immediately with the offer of changing any tv to any game we wanted.  Kayla was super fun and friendly, food was just fine and the beer very cold.  You couldn't ask for much more."}
{"text":"Fun little sports bar in Goodyear! The employees here are very fun and know how to have a great time while on the clock. I have tried a few things off the appetizer menu and had a couple drinks. Food it pretty good, and the atmosphere is very fun."}
{"text":"Great Service, Great Atmosphere, Great Food!!!

It's that simple and all we ask for as customers...I don't understand why that's so hard for other places to figure out?

We went out to eat later than we usually do (1030pm) after going to a really new cool place nearby (Our Creative Escape).

One would normally be cautious of going into any bar/restaurant so late at night, but we were so, so pleased!

Clean, properly-lit, attentive host and excellent Server who was on her game.

The Manager came over personally to apologize for our meals lagging behind a bit, and he was very sincere...which is VERY rare.

Really, really loved the food and this place...
We will return often!!!"}
{"text":"Bartenders are meh. Idk im from Las Vegas. So maybe my expectations are set pretty high. No people skills. This might be cause they talk more to their regulars than new people. I felt like i was dealing with robots. All i heard was ready for another one?? Instead of how was your day?? Or hey this is the first time i see you...where are you from. I would understand if this was my first time here. But i have given this place three trys. Anyways...there is a brewing company in the same shopping center. I recomended that place better."}
{"text":"I had a drink while waiting for a client to show. (Never Did) The bar guy was awesome, chatting it up with most of the regulars and even with me the random new guy. 

The service appeared to be on point and the food sounded good. The place was clean and inviting. There is not much eles in ther area as of yet but I did notice a brewery being built."}
{"text":"after being seated and waiting 10 minutes my husband had to go to the manager and let him know we were there. he did come over and appoligize and correct the situation. our waitress wasnt too friendly, not rude in any way, just didnt seem happy and approachable. she was attentive though. my food was meh. i got a western cheeseburger asked for medium well and ended up getting a burnt well done. waffle fries were good. my husband likes the place hes been there twice. he would return again.  i on the other hand will not. the price for food is way to expensive. carls jr has pretty much the exact same burger for cheaper. atmosphere is stale. kids are allowed in but its not really kid friendly. kids cups are Styrofoam to go cups.  there was also no music inside when we went."}
{"text":"Stopped by Augie's to catch a little playoff football with my father. Upon entering, I was surprised by the amount of televisions they had. Not a bad seat in the house but some t.v. pictures were better than others. The staff was all very friendly. Our waitress regularly checked on us and the manager did as well a few times. Impressive. For grub, we started with the Roscoe's Nachos (chili, cheese, olives, and salsa) that was decent. They were very salty which I usually dig, but they were on the edge of being a little overboard.  For my entrée, we had the pork sandwich with fries. Again the food was decent but very salty.  In addition, I do question whether any of the food was fresh. I just had a little bit of store bought flavor to it. Overall though, I did enjoy our time there given the amount of televisions and the friendly staff. I just wish the grub hit the mark."}
{"text":"Always great.  My go-to place near home.  Great staff. Great people watching.  Good food.  Lots of tv's, free wi fi."}
{"text":"We came here for the first time and the food and service was awesome. We sat at the bar because the place was packed but the manager and hostess made sure we were taken care of. I loved this place!"}
{"text":"Augies sucks effen nasty... White nachos how bout no... Pretzel Burger how bout eff no 10000 thumbs down.!"}
{"text":"4 STARS. Good beer. Very good food. These guys do ribs and burgers in awesome ways. The tacos were a big bad do not order - they have a cheesy jalepeno mix  and did not taste real at all. I sent them back. The owner says they have cheddar. Ask for cheddar! The service is prompt and polite. They have real music on the night I dropped in. It was first-class. The patio is also a bonus. I would consider coming back. People were lively and happy here. Honestly."}
{"text":"So the first time I went here I really didn't like the food.  I have been several times since then because of friends.  Since then, I have had great experiences.  I will agree that most of the food is standard bar fare, most of which is probably frozen.

I tried their potato skin appetizer based on a recommendation from a friend.  They were amazing!  The best skins I have had so far anywhere.  The potato to cheese ratio was on point.  They were dressed with scallions and real bacon pieces.  They had this sour cream based sauce on top that sealed the deal.  The sauce definitely had a kick but it made them completely unique and delicious.

The bloody Marys are awesome as well.  Mixed perfectly with celery and olives.  The drought beer is always ice cold and the serve it in cold glasses, a must of course.  

I have also had the buffalo chicken sandwich.  They use two large chicken tenders rather than a whole breast which I didn't really prefer.  The sauce was great and the chicken was well dressed.  The lettuce, tomato and onion was fresh and the pretzel bun was great.  On that note, I should mention that the soft pretzel appetizer is also great, one of my favorites.  They serve it with a great spicy mustard sauce and cheese.  

The service is okay, nothing extraordinary.  The main female bartender that seems to be there mostly on the weekends is somewhat standoffish and not very attentive.  I   have had several other waitresses and they seem okay.  

We sit mostly outdoors on the patio which is okay.  It seems to be mostly occupied by smokers which can get old but I understand they sit out there for a reason and I can move inside if I really wanted to.  They have three big TVs on the patio and always have sports going which is great.  They can be hard to see because of the sun glare but no biggie.  

I would recommend it to a friend.  They have mostly standard bar food but they definitely have a few options you can't get too many other places."}
{"text":"This place reminds me of cheers. Good food, cooked as described in the menu, good drinks and a chill atmosphere. They have cool live music that you can enjoy and have a conversation with who your with as well. We had a a chicken pesto sandwich and a beer brat (cooked in Guiness) both with soft pretzel buns and they are delicious! The staff was friendly and attentive from the bar to the tables."}
{"text":"Came here to meet up with a good friend.  They served breakfast.  Yeah!!!  The place is like a typical sports grill.  The breakfast was ok.  The service was ok too!"}
{"text":"A friend recommended Augie's and I'm glad she did! It's quaint but comfortable. Poppin' on a Friday. Their food scrumptious and their cocktails are pretty good! They have these mozzarella sticks that are pretty much cheese egg rolls and delicious! Waitresses were attentive and the place has a good vibe overall! Going back to check out the gigantic bar soon for sure!"}
{"text":"Decent atmosphere... food is good. We usually go for UfC and decided to stop in when they had a band. Wish the live music was better."}
{"text":"We went on a Friday night and first off the customer service was very friendly and very attentive. I happen to go there for their great food. I ordered the Cuban sandwich and let me tell you it was amazing.  It was very tasty and so fresh. My wife ordered the seven inch pizza with everything on it. I asked her about the pizza and answered me back with a Wow! I highly recommend this place to my friends."}
{"text":"our local hang out was full so the wife and I decided to stop here. my wife had the southwest egg rolls, they were very good.
I ordered a burger medium. it came out and had about a half a plate of red blood under it, raw pretty much. sent it back and just loved the black charcoal they were able to get on it... has to be the worst burger I have had, no flavor at all. 
I expect from a sports bar the food may be okay as long as you drink a lot before ordering."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been here numerous times since it's close to our home.  Went there last night, which was a Friday, must have been one of our waitresses's first few nights, we think..... She was unsure what was in the Seafood Sampler special, didn't know if the house salad had chopped or sliced onions, wasn't sure what type of fish was in the Special Fish Fry and the icing on the cake was..... she charged us 50 cents for 2 extra sides of tarter sauce, really?!  It's one thing to charge it but another thing to charge it and not have informed us of the \"up charge\".  It's just like a plate split fee when someone shares a meal, the wait staff informs you.  Not here, not in our situation.  Definitely felt nickeled and dimed.  Won't be returning."}
{"text":"Mediocre food, drinks (mango margarita was awful).  Only go when happy hour or nights when they have specials.  We went on a Sat. night and they kept having staff come up to our table to 'see if we were doing ok', that's code for are you people almost done-we have other people waiting.  The final dork came up to our table and actually asked us directly- were we going to be here for a while- we were still drinking but had already finished our frozen pizza with burnt sausage crumbles on top.  The other people with us were ready to leave otherwise we would have stayed and said something- just didn't seem worth it

We would never go back to this place."}
{"text":"Here is the scenario... Baseball team and a few wives need to get a bite after playing baseball all day in a tournament. The main requirement is TVs. Quality and type of food not important, though greasy fare is always welcomed by boys watching sports. Where do you go when you are at the Goodyear ball park and want something close so you do not miss a minute more of the World Series? Augie's, apparently.

We were very happy to find lots of TVs, and almost all of them with the baseball game on. We took up a huge portion of the bar area booth and table seating and faced in all directions, needing the multiple televisions. This location became important two days in a row out at Goodyear, though I will only be writing about the first when we had some of the Augie's greasy food. 

We did order just that. We could have opted for some salads or more meal like items but did not really want to eat too heavy, even though it was more like dinner time. We had had a decent size lunch and just were not really ready yet. So, we god iced tea, a lemonade, pretzel sticks, southwest egg rolls and waffle fries. Like I said, grease. 

The service was just average and our food really seemed to take forever. I guess deep frying everything takes time. Our appetizers arrived and everything really looked tasty. The pretzel sticks, which I am always a sucker for, looked really delicious. I doubt them make them fresh here, but I am not that picky. They were big, fluffy and fresh. Better than most ball park ones I have had. The honey mustard dip was great but the cheesy one was to wine tasting for me. The fries were fries. I wish they had had a little more spice to them. The southwest egg rolls were yummy. I have had them other places and they were pretty comparable. 

Overall, it was a pretty good experience. Everyone seemed happy. The boys got beer, greasy fare and tv's. The Giants won, so they were all ecstatic! Our food was pretty good and the waitress did an above average job of keeping our drinks with something in them. If you are nearby and need to watch some sports and get a little appetizer food and drinks, this is a good choice."}
{"text":"I am not sure how the food or drinks are at this place because they were so understaffed, we were unable to get a beer. After putting our name in, we went to the bar and waited for at least 10 minutes and could not get any service. There was one bartender and she was working hard. I cannot believe this place would be short staffed on a Saturday night. There was a Spring Training game that night, too and only a couple of places to grab a bite prior to the game. One would think there would be several bartenders on a night like this. We decided to leave and probably not come back."}
{"text":"Been here a few times and the best its the bar service in this area and THATS IMPORTANT AROUND HERE CAUSE ITS LACKING AS A WHOLE. Food is half decent but u will always be guaranteed solid bar service and that's important to me. Happy hour specials are worth it. SW Egg Rolls r in-house and very tasty. Chz stxs are *extra*, disappointing"}
{"text":"Went there on a Saturday to have a drink and a burger with my wife and couldn't leave. The food was good and the small patio was packed. Excellent band (JOKER), so we stayed until the music ended at 9:30. Wish the patio was bigger. Will come again to see that band. Don't see a postings for bands on the website."}
{"text":"This place is like a local Cheers.  The staff gets to know you and you get to meet friendly other 'regulars'.  The food is pretty good if you're looking for appetizers.  They will gladly modify items too if you are looking for a healthier fare.  The bartenders and manager that I am familiar with ask you if you'd like to order food or drink before happy hour expires or advise you to do so in a few minutes if you are nearing a happy hour.  I wish they had pool tables!"}
{"text":"Kat the bartender Rules! Great atmosphere and cool people who work there. Familyish atmosphere makes it very comfortable. Food is mehh but I don't come here for the food."}
{"text":"I can't believe I haven't been here before. After a long day at the mall, dealing with way too many Christmas shoppers, all I wanted was a quiet dinner before heading back home with the family. My kids suggested Augie's. At first I was worried that it would be the typical, loud, overcrowded sports bar. Though we did have to wait for a table (it was, after all, Saturday night), it wasn't annoyingly loud at all. 

I was a little taken aback by the prices...that is, until the food came. The portions are HUGE and the food is really good! 

The best part of the night: there was a live band playing music from the 50's through today- mostly rock- and everyone was dancing. My sons and I danced to several songs. My husband and I did as well. It was so much fun! My eldest son (10) was a hit with the ladies as he did the can-can with them to \"New York, New York\"! I must say I was definitely happily surprised. We will be back; with and without the kids!"}
{"text":"Ordered a berry margarita. There was nothing blended about it. Ice so thick it couldn't go through the straw. Last time I checked, you shouldn't have to chew through a margarita advertised as a blended drink. Got some mozzarella sticks, not impressed. They seemed frozen and fried. Waffle fries were okay but too much paprika. Bartender polite but not much experience. We asked for 2 sides of ranch which never came. Honestly not worth the money. The whole vibe was off. Awkward, a lot of older people. For that price I'd walk a little more to the right and go down to saddle mountain. Get more for my buck and yummy food. Yelp stars don't lie. Def never coming here again."}
{"text":"Been to Augie's on a few occasions and always enjoyed myself. Great TVs, good layout, and the most amazing staff at any Sports Bar in the Valley. The staff is very attentive and makes sure that you are well taken care of (that is worth 4 stars right there). They have a very good beer list for both draft and bottle, and the bartenders know their stuff. 

The food is spectacular. I went in expecting the typical \"Buffalo Wings and Burgers\" but was really surprised with how versatile the menu is. The burgers all come on an amazing pretzel bun, and the meat is fresh. They have amazing offers during happy hour which includes half price apps as well. Try the pretzels. Large, soft pretzels served warm with a side of sweet mustard or a cheesy jalapeno sauce. 

As for what W.S. had to say about no UFC Fight:  That was the first weekend of the NCAA Basketball Tourney and everyone in the place was wrapped up in good college basketball. Just because they aren't pandering to the Tap-Out T-Shirt crowd over the largest sporting tournament doesn't make them 'busch (sic) league', it just makes them savvy business owners."}
{"text":"Stopped in to watch the World Cup & have lunch. Excellent food and service. Our table had wings, a patty melt, a Reuben and the \"beef it up\" roast beef sandwich. All fresh & delicious. Friendly patrons and staff with lots of TVs."}
{"text":"Food was not great, Booze and Beer good selection great place to watch the game and have a cold one. They offer smoking area so that's nice, but staff is young and full of attitude."}
{"text":"I've been coming for years. A bartender pushed a political view on us. We disagreed and that was it. If you're a republican or a neutral view in the matter don't bother. And if you're military they will assume you're way right. Had four people how had no biased and they assumed. Happy birthday!!"}
{"text":"Nice little place to hang out at. Karaoke is at 9.pm on Fridays. They do not have a great wine selection though.  I notice some days they will have a band outside playing but I have not yet been there during those times.  The service is good. The atmosphere seems A-OK to me.  I will go back again."}
{"text":"Went there last night with my husband to watch UFC. We had good customer service and good seats to watch the fight. We ordered dinner and we both liked what we got. I had the chicken club sandwich with sweet potato fries and it was pretty good. Chicken was cooked right and had some glaze on the outside that was delicious.  Husband had ribs and said they were good. Waitress refilled our drinks even when we were done with our food but wanted to finish watching the fight, so I appreciated that. Overall good experience."}
{"text":"This is one of those places I'd wished I'd visited sooner. I finally decided to stop by after getting my hair done and was really pleasently suprised. I had the French Philly sandwhich and it was awesome! Also it was ladies night (Wednesday) and they had 99 cent domestic drafts which is always a win in my book.  We'll absolutely be back, I'd love to check out one of the live music nights."}
{"text":"Nice, clean and friendly neighborhood bar. Cooks are great we love the food. Staff is always nice. Good happy hour. Husband loves the patty melt! Good bands and it's just a fun laid back place."}
{"text":"I had a good time there watching Ohio State basketball, they promptly put it on the tube for me and food was actually really good (wings) and a little slow on the beer refills but gave me a free drink for my patience without me having said anything so i'm a fan for sure. Also they seem to hold a FREE poker tourney each Tues eve which i did not join in but had i felt so inclined i'm sure would've been entertaining. I will return."}
{"text":"I love this place and my wife and I eat here all the time. The service is always really good and very friendly. The food is awesome.  I would rate their Burger as one of the best in the Phoenix area. My wife claims their Cobb salad for sure is the best with no one coming close."}
{"text":"The staff is great, very attentive and helpful.  The patio has misters in the summer and is shady.  TV's are everywhere if you're there for the game.  Great specials, and live music.  While I do eat there I don't go for the food, but rather the location, atmosphere and staff.  It's an enjoyable experience anytime of the day or night."}
{"text":"We love Augies for the food and people who work there - always a friendly greeting when we arrive and a check on out happiness with the food and service when we leave. 

Great salad, ribs, wings and burgers. Affordable with a nice neighborhood feel."}
{"text":"The food is always good; the service always great. For my money, this is the best spot to eat and drink in Goodyear. Sunday night trivia, Wednesday night musical bingo, Friday night kareeoke, what more can you ask for? Also, Rachel is super sweet and an awesome server."}
{"text":"This is a typical sports bar. The atmosphere is ok, nothing special and is kid friendly. The food is pretty good but nothing to rave about."}
{"text":"I have had many weekly visits to Augie's over a three year period.  And let me say the following....

The reason you come to Augie's may not always be for the food, or the drinks, it is more for the atmosphere.  I can't personally think of another venue in the West Valley that has... 
- Clean environment 
- Live Music (no cover by the way)
- Trivia
- Sports
- Food
- Owners, bartenders, and waitstaff that actually CARE about your time

For all the reviews against the food.  You are at a sports bar.  Let me say this again, you are at a sports bar.  If you want a filet mignon, go to a freaking steak house.  If you want the best meal of your life, go to a five star restaurant.  Augie's is a sports bar, and, in turn, it serves sports bar food.

In terms of amenities, Augie's is the place to go if you want a local establishment where people literally know your name.  If you want a local watering hole, go to Augie's.  The owners are almost always present, something most local establishments can't say anymore, and if they aren't, the bartenders and managers will be sure to treat you kindly.  They are a fun bunch, and I sure do miss the heck out of this place.  I would prefer to spend my time, and money, where it is appreciated, and Augie's does just that."}
{"text":"The live music always looks inviting when I pick up Chinese at Yans nearby... But both times I've tried it... I've been unimpressed. Service is subpar and so is the food."}
{"text":"Not that special at all.  Waitress lagged quite a bit, food was okay, overall actually a fairly poor experience.  If we're ever in the area again, my wife and I will probably look elsewhere for lunch."}
{"text":"The manager john is a JOKE!!! I got a cobb salad and not only did the chicken come out RAW but they left the same lettuce the RAW chicken was sitting on top of!!! We are a military family and he didnt give us the discount since he took 5 dollars off our bill for THERE mistake!!! Health department needs to come in this place and regulate!! Make sure the food you order is fully cooked people! Saw cooks not wearing gloves too! YUCK"}
{"text":"great food and great serivce too. and good prices. watch ufc 194 there with some friends. it was packed."}
{"text":"Had some time to kill and was hungry so stopped here to grab a bite to eat.  First, my waitress seem dumbfounded that a girl was in there by herself.  It's like she didn't know how to interact with a single female.  I get it that you flirt and wear low-cut shirts for the guys for tips (I did the same thing back in the day), but jeez!  Food was ok.  Like someone else mentioned, seems like alot of things are just reheated or fried.  Price a little high if not making to order, but not outrageous.  Bar looked to be very well stocked!  I saw alot of regulars come in that were greeted by name by staff.  Seems like you could have  A LOT of fun here with the TVs and live music and alcohol.  Wouldn't go back for the food (pretzel bun was good tho!) but for the late-night atmosphere."}
{"text":"Overpriced. Had to wait 10 minutes to get another drink. Food is acceptable."}
{"text":"Came here while on vacation and was very impressed with the food and atmosphere.  My group ordered appetizers and drinks, and we were all impressed with the quality and service.  A manager named Justin was very attentive to my table and checked in a few times to make sure everything was ok.  It was a nice gesture, and I always appreciate this level of service which is not common in chain restaurants, and why I typically avoid them. If I lived in this area, I would be a regular.  Will definitely come back next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"Great meal great happy hour drink prices. The waitress was accomidating, automatically asked if checks were separate and got the manager to change the tv channel for my husband. Pizza is huge and the potato skins yummy."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time with the hubby last night and was surprised there wasn't more great reviews!! 
Server recommended the Sante Fe spring rolls for appetizer Mexican version of rolls def delicious with sauces it comes with!! 
I ordered the Linda philly with steak frys and hubby ordered Johnny boy burger with waffle frys both meals delicious!!
Service was quick! Enjoyed a nice meal there at a family friendly place! 
Btw had live music not too loud for the baby something we enjoyed!"}
{"text":"Went to watch the UFC fight.  They have never charged a cover.  Half way through they suddenly put a $9.80 charge on the bill saying it's for $5 cover for each person.   $9.80???

Cover is charged at the door!!!  No sign, no mention of it at the door even though they knew we were there for the fight.  

Then a number of people suddenly started seeing it on their bills.  Everybody started to complain but the manager/owner? said it is what it is.  He says everyplace charges cover and that they have always charged cover.  Their waitress said they haven't charged a cover before.  

He tells me that if I don't like paying for a cover I could watch the fight somewhere else.  Finally after many complaints he started taking the cover off the bill for people who spoke up.  I'm pretty sure he didn't do it for everyone.

It was like they didn't make enough money that night from drinks/food etc so they needed to make it up so started charging cover after the fact.

It wasn't even about the money but the way they did things.  Very poor managment.  Won't be going back their again!"}
{"text":"Great happy hour!  Lots of good beer on tap.  Found my new favorite Leinenkoogals Sunset Wheat.  If you like Blue Moon, you'll love this one.  Make sure to have the pretzel sticks with you beer, they are delicious!  Staff is friendly and never let your chilled glass stay empty."}
{"text":"Great draft choices, friendly staff and affordable prices. Good place to grab a beer with a friend or sit back and watch a game."}
{"text":"The veggie wrap is good, there are bands Wed., Thurs., & Sat. ....oh yeah and lots 'o draft beer - available in pitchers. Half off appetizers during happy hour (4-7). Lots of flat screens (even outside) to watch sports. No cover UFC. Good service and personable management. I would give 5 stars if they added a bike rack."}
{"text":"Plus #1 ... Guinness on tap
Plus #2 ... Large bar seating area
Plus #3 ... Chill live music

We had the bleu cheese fries and they were the best I have ever had.  Chunks of bleu cheese that have been baked on top of the fries.  Make sure to get some chunky bleu cheese dressing to dip them in."}
