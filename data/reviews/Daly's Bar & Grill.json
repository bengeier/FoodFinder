{"text":"Fantastic Friday Fish Fry....It was our first visit- We were impressed by the warm welcoming reception, excellent service and delicious food.  Our waitress earned a good tip and ensured that Daly's would a place to recommend to friends and family for casual dining."}
{"text":"I wandered over from my hotel across the street, expecting your average pub fare and beer selection.  I was very pleasantly surprised!   While they did have the usual choices, it was also taco tuesday! The bartender, who turned out to be the owner, recommended the tacos, and I acquiesced.    They. Were.  Wonderful! Authentic Mexican style, very fresh, delicious steak, good toppings.  It was very very tasty.    Meanwhile, the bartender kept the margaritas coming. They were big.  And strong.  And delicious. And only $3.50 on special! I'm a big dude, and not unaccustomed to drinking, and I was pretty tanked on like $10 worth of drinks at a bar.  Cannot beat that.  I was glad my hotel was 300 feet away.   As I was finishing up, the bartender and I chatted for a while, and I discovered then that he is the owner.  He tends a couple nights a week, so he can hear what input his regulars and other folks have to say.  He seemed to very keen on hearing what he could do better (nothing). It was very awesome to see someone take such pride in their business!  To recap: awesome food, awesome drinks, very reasonable price, awesome people! If I'm ever back in this neck of the woods, I'll come back!"}
{"text":"Daly's is fantastic! This was our first time and we got unbelievable service! We went for the Fish Fry on Good Friday and because it was before seven they still had happy hour special and $4 old fashioneds on Fridays! We did wait for our food for about 30 minutes (later learned that they were short staffed and the manager was our waiter!) but they rectified the situation by giving us each a complimentary beverage, which was fabulous! When my drink was not to my satisfaction, the manager remade it himself and it was much better! We also called over the owner to give a rave review of the service. The food was pretty good too! We had the cod and perch fish fry... they give you a lot of food (baked apples, fries, coleslaw, bread, corn, and clam chowder) all acceptable :). We will DEFINITELY be going back!"}
{"text":"Diamond in the rough! Don't let looks deceive you. Stopped in on a Friday night with mom and boyfriend when the restaurant didn't appear to be that busy -- we were a bit worried (typically like to wait) -- but oh my god, you should definitely come here for an awesomeeeeee Friday night fish fry.   There are so many fish choices -- all prepared differently and well. Homemade salad dressings, homemade tartar, and all around fabulous fish. Yum.   Portions are so generous. Service was great and the owner came to our table not once but twice in the evening to make sure everything was to our liking. When he saw I couldn't finish the first plate of my all you can eat finish, he only charged me for the 3 piece cod dinner. Thank you!  Stop in for friendly service and a fabulous meal. :)"}
{"text":"This establishment could use some updating. The food is great, although I've only had the wings. Most of the staff is quick and efficient in providing quality customer service. The DJ; however, has been rude on several occasions ranging from refusing any requests to simply ignoring patrons. I overheard the DJ tell a girl he would not play her music because he didn't like it. Most of the music played is house music, and with this being the only real functional dance bar in sun prairie, it's disappointing to see such a small range of music played."}
{"text":"Update to our previous review.   We have been back to Daly's and have been pleasantly surprised with the food.  Their Mushroom and Swiss Burger with Sweet Potato fries is the best in town! We did the Friday fish fry a couple of weeks ago.  The baked apple and corn on the cob were a nice side to the meal.  Good fish and I'm a tarter sauce lover, which was good as well. I haven't heard any bad comments on their food.  Very good. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Awesome food! The jerk tilapia is a must! The staff and environment is wonderful. I definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"I think they must have the employees write the 5 star reviews because I don't know how you could construe this establishment into a 5 star experience.  I will say the staff tried really hard, but everything just went to the left.  They don't have a printed beer menu. The waitress had it written down on a piece of paper but was reluctant to leave it on our table for everyone in our 8 top party to peruse. So I took a picture of it on my phone to pass it around.   We asked questions about some of the entrees and the waitress said she would check with the cook, but seemingly forgot when she came back to our table and asked if we had any questions about the menu.   The menu is your typical bar and grill, American offerings; burgers, sandwiches, and wings. I ordered the wings and cheese curds. You get one choice of sauce with the wings, no exceptions. I went with the spicy Asian.   The cheese curds were the star of the show here. Covered in a light, flaky breading, the yellow cheese curds striiiiiiinged for dayz! The cheese still somehow managed to keep form and stick to the coating, even after pulling the pieces apart.   The wings had a nice crispy shell, the meat was tender but the flavor did not come through from the inside. The \"spicy\" Asian sauce was your standard sweet and sour sauce from a bottle.   As for the service, that's when it was painful to watch.   The food seemed to take longer than expected, which could meant it's a good sign because everything was being made with precision. However, this was not the case.   A friend ordered the jerk chicken sandwich with no cheese. They first brought out the wrong sandwich. Then when brought out the correct sandwich, it had cheese on it.  Two companion ordered the pulled pork sandwich. One said her sandwich was acceptable but the other one's sandwich came with dry and stale bread, the shredded pork was dry and didn't contain enough BBQ sauce.  Another member of the group wanted to substitute the coleslaw with fresh vegetables, the order came with both but forgot her side of fries, thinking she wanted to substitute the fries with coleslaw.  During this entire dining experience, the waitress and perhaps the owner kept apologizing about the hiccups.  Another weird part of the dinner was the silent 70s/80s music video playing on the TVs, with still pictures of the staff sprinkled throughout the loop."}
{"text":"I love this bar. Scuba Steve is a class act. Tim and Emma are extremely good at what they do. They opened half an hour early for us today. The food is excellent and they do a great job of keeping the menu fresh. The food is always above average and the cheese curds are a must try for anyone from Wisconsin. This place is everything you could ask for out of a bar / restaurant."}
{"text":"Spectacular food for a little dive bar. Good drink prices and usually decent service."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with my sister she had tacos I had the BLTA so good! Perfect spot for a quick lunch and chat with scuba. Every time we eat here it's a great experience- there's even games for the kids to play!"}
{"text":"Went to Daly's last week after arriving in Madison for the long July 4 weekend.  Decided to try Daly's because of the Yelp reviews and the menu sounded good.  My husband had the chicken wings and they were good.  I had the lunch soup and sandwich special - clam chowder and a Italian sub - they were FANTASTIC!  The fries that came with the wings were also good, but the soup and sandwich put this place at the top of our list for lunch menu.  Good selection of beer on tap as well.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"i had the seafood alfredo.  It was tasty and the seafood was cooked well.  I ordered food at 9:30pm and they were able to accommodate me at the bar and the food was good.  I'd go back during regular dining hours and see what else they have to offer."}
{"text":"Was enjoying this place , but went in on sat night waited for 20-30 minutes. Waitress looked at me every time she walked by but never stopped to take my order or even give me a menu. They were not busy at all. She even came to a table that just sat down 15 min after I got there.   Bar service is good.  Just don't rely on the waitress to get you food or menu or drink or anything else for that matter."}
{"text":"I was spending time with some girlfriends on a Saturday, and suddenly we all realized that we were starving. I googled Sun Prairie restaurants and this place came up. The menu looked fine and it was close so we headed over.   We went in the wrong door. After parking in the first legal spot we found we entered the door that had an awning and and Open sign. It was a bar door, and it seemed to surprise the people in the bar, who all looked at us with something like shock.   We couldn't find any sort of host station or even a bartender, so we just kept walking in to the restaurant. Eventually we found a nervous young man who told us to sit anywhere. We almost sat in a broken booth (a little warning sign goes a long way) but were warned off by a nearby customer.   The place is very run-down inside. Broken booth, broken speakers, not all the lights on, BUT the food was fine and the prices were great. I had the Indian taco (Navajo fry-bread with taco toppings on top) and my friends had tacos and the Southwest burger. We all loved our food, and the server (the same nervous young man from before) was attentive."}
{"text":"Meh. The food is okay, but my one of my 3 kids did not get his food until everyone else was done eating. They totally forgot to make his order. Don't worry, they still charged us full price. Then gave us the wrong bill with an extra 3 drinks on it. Check your bill closely."}
{"text":"Don't come here thinking you are going to get a fast fish fry and be out the door in a half hour.  What you will get is one of the best, most unique fish fries you will ever have.  It was a little exasperating when they told us it would be a 35 minute wait and we counted 5 empty tables.  After we were seated, our server Beth, explained that the owner is the cook and most things are made from scratch.  And the wait is usually so the kitchen can keep up.  With our 3 piece dinner we got baked apples, a short ear of corn, Cole slaw and choice of sides.  I've had over cooked small ears of corn at some bbq places that were inedible.  This little bi-color ear of corn was very good and a compliment to the fish and so were the apples. The cole law was excellent and so was the fish and waffle fries.  Beth warned you us that the fish is all hand-battered and it might take a little while.  The $5.00 old-fashioned made the wait enjoyable."}
{"text":"The homemade food never disappoints. The soup and pasta is always amazing! Always ask what the special is because the owner always is trying something new and delicious!"}
{"text":"Love Daly's. They Take great pride in the quality of food at a great value.Homemade pasta, sauces, desserts, etc. Excellent fish fry, steaks, and Sunday brunch! Great rotation of beers and craft cocktails. It's no wonder why they have a fierce following from locals. If you sit in the bar area there's a good chance you will see bartenders doing tricks with bottles."}
{"text":"Love this place. Good food I've had several things including the bacon cheeseburger, fried pickles, buffalo chicken wrap, Etc. great people. Bartenders are a lot of fun. Come here almost every week!"}
{"text":"Great food! Awesome environment & staff. I highly recommend!! The ribs & jerk tilapia are amazing!! The tacos are super good too."}
{"text":"I like to give restaurants the benefit of the doubt.  If food tastes bad once, I like to try again.  Well, I've had Daly's three times now and the food tasted worse each time.  Last night I had the burger with Pico in it, I asked for it medium well, and it tasted like rubber.  The bun was badly burnt and fries were soggy.  I also tried the spinach and artichoke dip.  The dip had that rough skin stuff on top, the bread and chips both tasted stale and the veggies....well I had two bites of this thing and couldn't force myself to eat more.  My.....\"insides\" were not sitting right after this meal.  Avoid this place."}
{"text":"I loved this place until Wednesday night. I order the stake and got my salad after I was 1/2 done with my stake. I sat at the bar and the bartender was not very good at taken care of people. Did not know anything about the tap beers they had. Last night was one star. The 10 times were 5 stars."}
{"text":"Looking at the reviews this looked like a good place to try, but it was disappointing. After giving this place a second try, it's easy to say it is consistent. Consistently bad. Both times the fries were cold when they got to the table. The burgers seemed like they would be good but were very dry and had no flavor. The service and atmosphere were decent."}
{"text":"Terrible Prime. It looked grey., had no flavor and was dry, Yuk, four people were in our party, none of us liked our food."}
{"text":"Went after work, late afternoon, as I was looking for a drink and bite to eat. The guy with the attitude behind the bar really didn't seem to give a damn that I was there. I did at least manage to get a beer out of him, even though I'm sure he probably had to put more effort into it than he would've liked. Of course, ten minutes after he serves me, his shift is up. So, seems he was all standoffish because he wouldn't be getting the tip I put on my tab. Boo hoo. Doesn't mean you need to come across as a dick. I know that and I hate interacting with the general public! The woman who replaced him was nice, but that first interaction soured me on the experience to the point where I only ordered one more beer and no food. Plus, the Spotted Cow tasted off. Basically, I'm not coming back here if I'm the one who has to pay."}
{"text":"We had great service from Bartender Joe. Wings were super good! The drinks were decently priced. I observed some burgers, a salad and a pasta dish that came out-- they looked delicious.   Great service & great food!!!"}
{"text":"Daly's Bar and Grill is in the same place that JB's Italian Grille used to be in Sun Prairie.  Since the new owner took over, the menu and decor has changed. My husband and I visited on a Friday night about a week after they re-opened. There were still a few kinks to be worked out, but overall, we were very happy with our experience!  The hostess forgot to tell us about the specials, so my husband missed out on the Friday nigh fish, but that was ok because his Pork Belly Mac & Cheese was very tasty. I had a pretty safe buffalo chicken wrap with sweet potato fries. I was definitely satisfied with my meal, but it wasn't anything too exciting. We also had an order of fried pickles, which were in spears instead of chips like they were supposed to be and came with regular ranch instead of the chipotle ranch like they were supposed to, they were as delicious as fried-anything can be!  I'm excited to go back in a few weeks after the staff gets used to the new owner/menu and give it another try!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing food! Scratch made sauces and salad dressings make every meal a step above the norm. Owner is sociable, knowledgeable, and on the floor making sure everyone has a great experience. We have made it a weekly norm. Recommend to anyone local or passing through. New management has made this an absolute delight! Photo is special of Chilean Sea Bass."}
{"text":"We took a chance and came here because of a coupon about two months ago. Since our first great dining experience we have not been able to get enough of the variety on their Friday fish menu. We look forward week after week to to trying each fish item. Cod, perch, blue gill, salmon and sea bass to choose from with an accompaniment of sides as well as sweet corn, creamy cole slaw and baked apples.  Y'all gotta go check out Steve's masterpiece every Friday."}
{"text":"Amazing cheese curds, great pizza, excellent service. Noise warning - if loud music bothers you, this might not be your place, but the music choices were good and the atmosphere was fun!"}
{"text":"The best part about Daly's is the staff.  What a great group of people.  Friendly, and easy to interact with, even when they are busy.  I tend to get a little torn up sometimes, and when they saw I was plowing through beers, they suggested I order some wings.  Best decision ever.  I wasn't driving, but I like to stay out until I can't see straight.  I had some wings and just kept going.  Then Hank walked in.  I was seeing 3 of him, which made the view worse.  He starts hollering about how good he is at pool, and tossing money around looking for opponents to take bets, which of course is illegal.   No one was biting, so he sat in the corner, alone and started crying.  Loudly.  I mean he was sobbing like a baby.  I didn't want him to recognize me, so I put on a disguise.  A fake mustache and an over sized foam cowboy hat.  I asked him if he wanted to play a game, just for fun.  I thought he was going to kiss me he was so happy.  I beat him every time.  I recommend Daly's.  I do not recommend Hank.  #teammrbo"}
{"text":"Daly's used to be a no-star Italian place.  It's evolved into a 1-2 star bar and grill.  The bar being the better part of that equation.    I was in for lunch the other day.  I was the only person in there other than some dude who started his hangover early.  I took a seat and a waitress appeared immediately.  A drink was provided rapidly.  The menu is extremely limited.  Typical bar and grill fare, nothing exciting or unique.  I placed my order (whoa--prices are a little high).  It came out promptly.  (It should have--I was the only person there.)  I ordered the bacon cheeseburger.  You can tell a lot about a place by how it does the basics.  It was passable as a bacon cheeseburger, but nothing exciting.  The patty was frozen, not fresh, and was bland and uninteresting.  The bacon was good.  The cheese was plain and boring.  The lettuce and tomato that came with it were crisp, cold and fresh--the best thing I can say about the whole experience.  The bill came to $11.14.  That's pretty steep for a burger that's a couple of notches below Hardee's, Sysco's finest waffle fries, and a fountain drink.    Overall, a wholly forgettable experience.  I hope their bar is better than their grill, or this place is destined for a short life span.  It gets two stars over one because it's local and it's still new.  I hope they make some changes for the better."}
{"text":"Really nice place with awesome food to enjoy a Friday happy hour. Chicken wings are awesome!"}
