{"text":"I really enjoy this place especially when they do promos (they had the Chorizo Burrito on for $7 for the whole month of August 2015, for example).

I ask for my burrito to be pressed in the grill after they assemble it (prior to them wrapping it in the foil).  Really adds to it for me."}
{"text":"Truly Authentic Mexican. Even if they don't have corn tortillas. I especially like the brown guacamole which they try to convince you is \"normal\". I guess all the fresh green guacamole I have had in California is actually not normal?"}
{"text":"Great burrito with meat grilled fresh but just a wee little bit on the expensive side."}
{"text":"Food was decent, bad customer experience though.
The girl at the checkout let me stand there for five minutes without any acknowledgment while she was doing something with the checkout register - after a long wait time i got to getting my burritto. They were out of grilled veggies but when i asked for some of each salsa, the checkout girl jumped in saying i only can have 2. To top it up i got my burrito not grilled even though they just did that for previous customer."}
{"text":"Great burritos, made to order, at a reasonable price. The meat is grilled in front of you. Lots of fresh ingredients to choose from."}
{"text":"Chorizo is to Taco Bell, what Lick's is to McDonalds.

Dropped by for the first time the other day on the advice of my daughter who goes there all the time. Ordered the Chicken Burrito which is about $9 and another $3 for a pop and salsa / chip combo.

Like Lick's, the food is freshly prepared to order and prepared  right in front of you. They offer all kinds of toppings and sauces within view so you can customize the ingredients you want....a little daunting to decide on toppings / sauces for the first time ....too many to choose from. But, the staff was super friendly and walked me though all the choices as well as what are some of their most popular choices among their customers.

The Burrito I got was HUGE...this thing must of been about 10\" long and 4\" - 5 \" thick....it looked like a small loaf of bread on steroids !!!

Must say, I'm really impressed with the portions sizes and how flavorful and fresh the Burrito tasted....it was great and FILLING !

That said, I'm not sure I'd opt for the chip / salsa combo again...I had 2 salsa choices and neither one was either large enough or flavorful enough to warrant getting them again....and the chips simply seemed like a needless ' add-on ' to me.

But for some huge portions of freshly made Tex / Mex staples like burritos
fajitas etc, you can't go wrong with Chorizo IMO. I'd definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Simple menu: burrito, fajita, taco, and quesadilla. Each is huge for about $9. You won't need more. Choice of Mex condiments. All fresh. I'll be heading back bi-monthly."}
{"text":"Quite good.   Can get busy at lunchtime some days but I can get a good fresh hot lunch served quick enough and back to the office."}
{"text":"This is the best \"fast food\" type of taco joint I've ever been to. The meat is freshly cooked in front of you (unlike Burrito Boyz with their precooked, mushy \"steak\") and the toppings are super fresh and yummy. The steak and chicken are both yummy, but I think the steak is just a tad better. The salsa verde is delicious and their black beans are a nice contrast to most other places' mushy refried beans. 

A burrito and a drink will run you about $10. You really don't need a side. These burritos are crazy huge. I usually don't get any rice on my burrito, and I'm still lucky if I can finish it. If I do manage to finish it, there's no way I'm eating dinner later on that night. This burrito will fill you up all day. I'm not sure where people are putting their side order of chips and salsa. They must be like chipmunks, saving it up in their cheeks for later."}
{"text":"Want a good quality fresh burrito this is the place and honestly the best I have found in the Burlington & Oakville area."}
{"text":"Chorizo uses the slogan Fresh Mex, and it's true all of the food is prepared fresh in store.  I personally like the chicken guacamole soft tacos.  They are a great mix of flavour and size.

These are the only tacos I've ever had to eat with a fork.  The portion sizes are huge.

That being said, I've found a few inconsistencies on repeat visits.  My first few trips they didn't mind giving me different salsas on my tacos, now they force me to put the same salsa on both of my tacos.

Though the staff is friendly, they look like a bunch of potheads.  Look at the hair and the clothing choices to see what I mean.

Price wise they're slightly pricier than the Extreme Pita and the Teriyaki places next door

Overall I would give them 4 stars on the food, and drop it down to 3 stars due to the environment."}
{"text":"When this place opened 5+ years ago it was amazing. Fresh ingredients, good selection of toppings and the sausage. God bless the sausage. Over the years the quality has diminished somewhat and it's lost its allure. New places like Burrito Boyz have been stealing my business. If it wasn't for the delicious chorizo I'm not sure I'd continue coming here."}
{"text":"Continuing the tradition of excellence begun by the original, this franchise brings Chorizo's awesome burritos to the west end of Oakville.

Delightful combinations of toppings allow for a great deal of customization.  Its menu is not broad, but it's pretty deep.  If you find yourself in this neck of the woods (and, God, what Yelpster ever wanders out to Oakville?) do give it a try.  You'll find it leaves the Boyz in the dust."}
{"text":"Great burrito's, freaking HUGE!!!  Service was efficient and friendly.  Small dining area.  Not cheap mind you, 2 burritos, 2 chips and cheese ran about 25 bucks with no drinks.  Excellent quality however and while it hurts paying that much for \"fast food\" it's pretty damn good fast food!!!"}
{"text":"As far as \"fast food\" goes, Chorizo is neither fast nor cheap, normally over $10 to get a side with your meal.  Yet it still gets five stars from me.  Yes, it's that good.  You will have to sit down and wait for a while because instead of pre-made ground beef your tacos (or other items) will be made with a freshly cooked steak (or other meat).  Yes, an actual fresh-cooked steak.  There are various toppings and hot sauces to choose from, and surprisingly I would recommend the mango salsa which is a little on the sweet side, as well as the verde salsa.  You can get a decent portion of nacho chips on the side with either the typical melted cheese or a salsa (I would recommend the cheese for price and taste).  The food is excellent-tasting, and it keeps me coming back weekly.  I would highly recommend checking out Chorizo!"}
