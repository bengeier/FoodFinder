{"text":"I was told it was the best and thought it was awful!  The sweet and sour chicken is just Un eatable huge chunks with a lot of green bell peppers. The fried rice is mushy and the egg drop soup is just ok but how can you mess that up. I was there as a guest but I'd never go by my self"}
{"text":"The food wasn't all the great ambiance was dull and service was pretty slow. TWO STARS!"}
{"text":"Best Chinese food in Phoenix! Moo Goo Gaipan and Mongolian Chicken are excellent and my two favorite dishes. The food is very tasty and seasoned with perfection!"}
{"text":"I have been going to Shangri-La for years and I am still a big fan of their food. First of all, the egg rolls, very good.   My mom and step-dad usually get the mixed vegetables or the chicken chop suey and are happy with their meals every time.   When I go I usually rotate between the Amazing chicken, Lemon Chicken or Beef and Broccoli. All three are yummy dishes. I like that they do allow substitutions on veggies, unfortunately on some of those veggies there is an additional cost for adding extra veggies.   I have also had the mushu chicken, the wonton soup and the duck (I can't remember the name of the dish), they were an experiment not quite to my tastes but I do know others who have eaten those dishes and liked them a lot. I guess it just comes down to personal taste.   This is a great restaurant with friendly service for the most part. Once or twice a server had been working on my table that was less than attentive but overall, this is a restaurant I would go to over and over again.   In fact, I'm getting hungry just thinking about their food. Hmm..maybe I'll go get some Chinese now."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years - every time I come to Phoenix to visit my grandma. The food is always amazing, as is the service. One of the best places to get Chinese food!"}
{"text":"My family has been eating here for years.  We dine in at one of the big tables and order family style or sometimes just call in for a pick up.  Either way the staff is always friendly.  They have a few items on the menu that I measure all other Chinese restaurants Stop in and order your favorite dish and see how they measure up."}
{"text":"My family and I have been coming here for 7+ years. The food portions are great. Everything we have tried has been tasty and well seasoned. It's a bummer though because they are not very lenient on substitutions as most Chinese food places are. I usually order the Spicy Tangy Beef with no mushrooms or corn, but they refuse to let me sub for onion or broccoli. They say it will be $1 more. I'm giving you back 2 veggies, but you won't let me have anything else instead. I mean I could understand a 25 or 50 cent charge, but $1 is like 10% the cost of my entire meal. Weird. On the other hand, the wonton chips and sweet and sour are a free appetizer and delicious. I've been to places that charge for that so it kind of evens out. So if you're not picky and will eat whatever they give you with no exceptions then I would definitely suggest giving this place a try. Also, they have the absolute best egg drop soup of anywhere I've ever tasted! Sometimes I get just that alone. It's my all time fave because unlike other places where it's just egg, it has other delicious surprises, including: peas, carrots, chicken, cabbage, I believe, and onion, add a hint of soy sauce and some crunchy wonton strips on top and perfection! I would also recommend the Twice Cooked BBQ Pork. Taste is just right and not overwhelming like some BBQ dishes can be. It has more depth than the typical syrupy, bright red, sticky Asian BBQ sauce. It is saut√©ed with an array of different veggies and serves with white rice."}
{"text":"Excellent food at a good price.  Great value for family dinner.  The Kung po is excellent, along with the fried rice and potstickers.  Service is excellent as well."}
{"text":"Bad business, if you place an order and it's all wrong, and you ask of a refund on a returned screwed up $45 order, they offer refund of $10, and you won't settle for being roped off; they in turn call the police on you? My daughter asked her friend and specifically order only what she likes, why should she pay for what she doesn't like? They didn't touch the food.  They asked questions before they ordered and were assured they would get it the way she wanted it. Really, call the police...well I won't be giving any of my money at this place, and if you don't want to get screwed over a screwed up order I wouldn't stop there either...they will call the cops on you. Some really great customer service, not!"}
{"text":"Totally bland food .  The place could use a good cleaning and a fresh coat of paint ."}
{"text":"My hubby and I stumbled across this place five years ago because we lived in the apartments across the street. We were locals new to the area looking for a good spot to eat.   This space is perfect for lunch or dinner. We usually go there for lunch because of their lunch specials. The lunch prices are reasonable, the portions are on point, and the food is satisfying. They offer a lunch special that includes your choice of two soups, an entree, rice, a bangin' crunchy eggroll, and two crispy wontons. I was pleasantly shocked at how much you get, and the price you pay for it. Another great option is the \"Combination Plate Special\". It's placed on a whiteboard at the entrance, you can't miss it. The combo plate includes a chicken salad with a ginger dressing, an entree with rice, and a chicken wing instead of an egg roll.    Don't miss out on this spot! Support our local independent businesses. If you are staying at the Holiday Inn across the street from this restaurant, and you are reading this review debating whether or not you should go, I'm telling you now....Go to Shango for lunch!!! If you are a local, stop dragging your feet and make your way over to one of the best lunch spots in town.  Recommendations:  Moo Goo Gai Pan:  This is a light white meat chicken dish cooked in a light sauce and with sauteed veggies.  Lotus Delight: This dish is a little heavier and includes bacon and shrimp cooked in a darker sauce with sauteed veggies."}
{"text":"Lunch menu is fairly extensive and offers a few really good offerings.  Dinner menu is even more extensive. I had the House Chicken, crispy fried chicken with an amazingly good sauce.  No veggies except the egg roll."}
{"text":"Nice quaint restaurant.  Great food, large prtiins and efficient service.  Every time I've been there, it has never been too busy."}
{"text":"All I can say is Wow. The food was amazing, the service was good, the prices reasonable. My only disappointment was that they didn't have sriracha sauce (but it's not Chinese so the jokes on me. Also the hot beef I ordered wasn't hot (spicy) as hoped but still delicious nonetheless. The Mongolian beef was out of this world! We'll return for sure."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing food. I love placing a to go order. Staff is always so friendly and I will continue to order from here!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I decided to go here on the spur of the moment. We got the Flaming Platter. It was really good. I espcially like the beef on skewers. For entrees i got the Monogolian Beef and my boyfriend got the kung pao chicken they were both equally good. Not the best i have had but still good. The customer service was great! I would definetly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Love this place, especially the kinda cheesy oriental decor and how dark it is.  Lived near here as a kid and my brother worked as a waiter here in high school.  Most of the food I have had here is decent, some things I didn't like but they did not taste bad, I just didn't like it.  However, the hot and sour soup is the best in town, hands down.  Used to be a little place in Goodyear (Bamboo Inn) did, but they closed a while back.  Any time I am sick I get the hot and sour soup to go, and go snuggle up in a blanket watching a movie and sip/eat the soup.  Mmmmmm, just spicy enough to help with the sinuses but full of yummy tofu and shrimp."}
{"text":"How do you guys have such a high rating??? I just ordered The Dinner Mongolian Beef... I threw it out it was so nasty. It must have been sitting there all afternoon, the meat wasn't fresh, the scallions were terribly overcooked, the only good think was the rice, but I didn't pay over $15 for RICE! I will never return, and tell people NOT to waste their money in your restaurant!  My first and last visit was pure disappointment!"}
{"text":"I'm surprised to see bad reviews about this place... I think it's great! The food is delicious, our favorite is the house special chicken and my boys love the orange chicken with bacon fried rice. Servings are big and the price is right... We love the service, the servers know us and they are real attentive. My family lives this place."}
{"text":"Excellent! Customer service was great. Amazing chicken dish was very good. Egg rolls are HUGE. Kind of an easily missed place but it'd one of the better places thus far in phoenix. Try it!! =)"}
{"text":"Best moo shu I have had in Phoenix. I love moo shu, but it is terrible in Phoenix. Happy I finally found a place where it is decent."}
{"text":"First time here and I was impressed.  Love Chinese food but have had a hard time finding places that I like.  This place may become a \"go-to\" spot!     Service was excellent.  Water was refilled promptly and servers and staff were all friendly and efficient.  Started w/ an egg roll (that we split) and it was a very back east style... nice fresh not overcooked insides (mostly cabbage w/ some other veggies and bits of roast pork) and the wonton skin/shell was fried perfectly!  Super crunchy but still tender and not overly greasy.  Then we got the entrees.  We went w/ that day's \"dinner special\" which was for two and the down-side to that is that it came w/ lo mein noodles instead of white rice... Just not the same...  We would have had to pay extra for the white rice and as I'd also ordered roast pork fried rice, we decided to skip it.    The fried rice was really good.  Still had peas and carrots (what is w/ that?  Even places in NY are doing it now!) but it was traditional rice (not the Uncle Ben's rounded rice that some places use) and done well.  Plenty of pork and egg and scattering of other veggies and had the right color and flavor.    The first entree of the dinner special was walnut shrimp, which my b-friend loves... we just get it w/o the walnuts (as he's allergic).  it was excellent!  A very good amount of shrimp on a bed of fresh cabbage (usual presentation) surrounded by quick-cooked broccoli.  Nice touch.   The shrimp were cooked perfectly and coated in almost a very thin tempura batter that gave the creamy sauce something to hang on to.  Each bite was a bit crispy from the batter with the shrimp tender but solid and overall, VERY tasty!   The broccoli was also cooked perfectly.  Still nice and crisp, not all limp and over done and not coated in the sauce.  The second entree was orange chicken.  Huge platter of JUST the chicken/sauce w/a slice of orange for garnish.  The chicken seemed to be mostly white meat (I'd say all white meat but as I like dark meat, if a couple pieces snuck in, I wouldn't have minded and didn't make a mental note of any) and coated in a lovely batter that was just exactly the right amount of crispy.  Crisp on the very outside, fully cooked and tender on the inside, wrapped around a good sized piece of chicken.  All were bite sized but the batter was not on so think that the meat is lost in the bread.  The sauce was tasty and even after being on the pieces of chicken for some time, hadn't made the \"nuggets\" soggy...  Can't say enough about how impressed I was at the quality of deep frying.   So often things are either over cooked and beyond crispy and have become hard or are not fried correctly and are just greasy soggy messes.  I'd equate the coating on this chicken to perfectly made funnel cake...   The \"side\" that came w/ the day's \"dinner special\" was the only small bit of disappointment.  While the noodles were cooked perfectly and not swimming in grease, they were also lonely.... Not a vegetable or anything in site.   I understand it is a \"side\" but just plain noodles are a bit dull.  I would have liked to have seen at least a sprinkling of the veggies that come w/ regular lo mein (Mandarin chow mein), even if they reduce the amount that would be in an order of say, roast pork or chicken lo mein.  It would have given the noodles some additional flavor/texture.  Again, I'll definitely order their Mandarin chow mein some time as I love a good lo mein and they definitely have the noodles cooked properly!  Since it was supposed to be a side, I'd have preferred white rice, if there were to be no veggies or anything added to the noodles.  Overall, great restaurant and I'll certainly go back and try other items.  Excited to see that they have egg foo yung and looking forward to trying that and the Cantonese chow mein as well as some chop suey.  :-)"}
{"text":"The only thing better than the service is the food!! LONG time customer... love this place will continue to come back for years to come!!"}
{"text":"Wonderful food, decent service & good prices. I was visiring the area from out of town and was craving Chinese - my friend recommended this place for lunch....I was leery, but what a wonderful surprise. I had the beef with snow peas and black mushrooms - fabulous! My friends got the kung pao chicken & the orange chicken lunch specials - they both said they were tasty. My friend, who recommended the place, got an item called Lotus Delight - it was fantastic. Very different but delicious ( bacon in Chinese food ).....I'll definitely be back next time I'm in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"This is the only place in town I've found a Chinese chick salad close to the ones back home in Ca. We order 2-3 times a month. My bf doesnt love asian food as much as I do, but he loves the Spicy Orange Beef."}
{"text":"Some of the best Chinese food I've had always very tasty. I have been eating here for a few years now and never been disappointed with the taste or quality of the food. The people are very friendly whether your eating in or taking out. The food is always hot and delicious."}
{"text":"Don't know what happened here, but wow, what a shift.  Went here tonight for dinner with a friend and ordered the usual but it was not the usual. Did they change management or what???  Food was way below par.  I usually get lemon sauce on the side, but was refused   Not enough on chicken to finish with. Asked for more but wanted to charge for it. Young kid waiting tables seemed confused.  Charged for water...not happy.  Very poor service.  What a shame.  Used to like the place."}
{"text":"All I have to say is I can't believe they would allow someone in their restaurant with a f*n dog. I do have animals but it's certainly not acceptable unless it's a service dog. My last time here. Food is ok however again last time for this reason alone."}
{"text":"They don't call it Amazing Chicken for nothing. This place was an excellent Yelp find and I would have to agree with many of the reviewers. I have eaten here quite a few times since finding it on Yelp and they have yet to disappoint. The sweet and sour chicken, kung pao chicken and amazing chicken are excellent."}
{"text":"Delicious Chinese food...so glad we found this place. For me, it's the best that I have found in Phoenix. Given the location and the appearance from the outside, I was expecting one of those fast-casual, order at the counter restaurants and was surprised that it was sit down. (I didn't yelp beforehand).  We went on a Friday night and were seated right away...there is quite a bit of seating. Service was good. We ordered the Mongolian Beef, Lemon Chicken, Pork Fried Rice, and my daughter ordered the Asian Chicken Salad and Egg Drop  Soup. While we waited we were served fried wontons with sweet and sour.   The food came quickly and everything was delicious. The beef was the best dish out of all them and highly recommended. Prices were decent and portion sized were large. All four of us were able to enjoy dinner with leftovers to bring home. We will definitely have to try takeout or return soon."}
{"text":"We have been going here for about 3 years now .. Everything from the food to the service is great every time.    Our favorites are the orange beef, sesame chicken, generals chicken, and their potstickers are amazing!    The employees build a relationship with their customers and it's nice knowing we can walk into a restaurant and they know what we want and we know we'll be treated well."}
{"text":"Great food and have been around for years! Definitely try the lo-mein with chicken it's the best."}
{"text":"I grew up with a location in Chandler but it closed down several years ago so I was very happy to see this location existed. We got the house special chicken, Peking beef, amazing chicken, crab puffs and the dumplings. The dumplings and the house special chicken was just like I remember and I will make the almost 40 minute drive just for those. The crab puffs were good, the amazing chicken was not very amazing, it tasted like there was cocktail sauce in it. The Peking beef made me sad because it was not like I remember, it needed way more ginger and the crispy rice noodles. I will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Most cheap Chinese restaurant & not in a good way. \"Crab puffs\" with no imitation crab in it? A shrimp fried rice with barely any shrimp in it? A wonton soup with no meat in it, just the wonton wrap cooked in broth? How do they mess up the most basic foods of a Chinese restaurant? Why do people pay for this when you can get real Chinese food elsewhere where they care about the food they're serving? Customer service here blows too."}
{"text":"For those of you who want something delicious and authentic, I highly recommend you try out Shangri'La.  This place has been around as long as I have (ok, I am only 26, but still!).  For as old as it has been around, the quality still remains the same.    On my last visit, I ordered the seared dumplings, sizzling soup, and some kind of sizzling peppered steak.  The soup arrived promptly.  Nothing better then hearing that spppplash of rice in the hot soup.  This soup needed no additional seasonings (with the exception of pepper, which I add to everything).  It was perfectly salted, perfectly heated, and filled with hearty vegetables and meats.  I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of the shrimp in the soup.  It did not have any fishy taste to it what so ever.  The dumplings were equally as delicious.  They were fried to a nice consistency on each side and the accompanying sauce could be drank on its own.  The final treat was our steak meal.  I loved the fact that they provide you with a HUGE bowl of white rice on the side.  It definitely proved to leave plenty for our take out...which speaking of takeout, my fiance and I shared everything that night.  We ended up with an extra cup of soup, 2 extra dumplings, rice, and peppered steak.  Our meal came to around 25 for both of us, plus the remaining leftovers for the next day.  In either case, I recommend giving this place a try.  With age comes wisdom, and it is wise to go with what is known."}
{"text":"I love this place. It's right down the street from my office. I go at least 2-3 times per month (sometimes more) and I just order everything to go. The service for lunch is really fast, I usually just come in and order and then wait. It takes 5-10 mins (sometimes even less) for my food to be ready to go. The building is a bit run down but don't let that fool you. Overall the building is clean, just older. The food is really really good, their egg drop soup is delicious. The portions are also really large, I can easily make 2 lunches out of one lunch combo. Their prices are a bit higher than other places in the area (like Mings Pagoda) but the food is so much better and worth the extra dollar or so."}
{"text":"Food was alright,  great place for families the  portions were great,  $9-10 for the chicken or beef plate $12-14 for seafood dishes, they also have a bar in which they serve amazing cocktails"}
{"text":"I went there for the first time last night with my mother for dinner before hitting Brass Armadillo Antique Mall just kitty corner from Shangri-La.   I thought the food was pretty delicious!  When you first walk in, the restaurant is clean, but you do notice the age of the building and the decor... but there were quite a few people having dinner there -- and we checked the Yelp ratings before we went it.   I ordered the Orange Chicken and Momsie ordered the California Fire Pot.    The orange chicken wasn't overly battered, so you got more chicken and seemed less heavy than at other places.  The orange sauce was VERY tasty!   The California Fire Pot was also quite good... crab, shrimp, scallops, cod, fresh steamed veggies, and avacado slices in a nicely flavored broth.    The staff was pleasant and efficient.   There were some employees at the bar area chatting loudly for quite a bit which was a distraction from our conversation, but it didn't last the entire meal...   It wouldn't be a place I would go out of my way for, but it will definitely be a new option for when I'm antique shopping in that area."}
{"text":"This is my girlfriend's and I go to Chinese spot. Went just last night and ordered crystal shrimp (my favorite), sizzling rice soup for her, and an order of dumplings.   The crystal shrimp is very tasty and they do not skimp on quantity of the shrimp. I think they added more salt to this dish recently and that gave it a bit more flavor compared to past experiences. Sizzling rice soup was enough for two and also was tasty. We ordered our dumplings pan fried and they weren't over done.   Found the service to be good. No needing to wait on a refill. A word of advice for those that don't know. They'll bring out the appetizer first, then the soup, and will bring the main dish when the soup is finished. If you ordered a main dish and your co-diner ordered something like soup, you might be waiting for them to finish their soup before yours will come out."}
{"text":"I went today on my lunch hour with my husband. The manager was so rude to us & disrespectful. She asked if I was done with my soup. I told her no. I wanted it to cool down. She came back a second time asked are we ok & took my soup? My husband said she wasn't finished.. She then replied \"so what do you want to do lick the bowel!\" We was shocked at her response to us. I asked is that how you treat paying customers!? She said \"you are no longer a paying customer get out before I call the cops!\" I will never return & NOBODY should either.. #BEWARE#"}
{"text":"Great food for a reasonable price. Fast but authentic. Been coming here for over 20 yrs. Never have been disappointed."}
{"text":"Great Chinese restaurant.    Ate in Friday night.  We always start with the sizzling rice soup.  Excellent.  Followed with Sweet and Sour Chicken and the Neptune's Platter which is brought sizzling to the table side.  Food tasted fresh and well prepared.  Delicious.  Service is prompt, attentive and friendly.    Highly recommended."}
{"text":"My partner and I stopped in for the first time tonight. The food was wonderful! The service on the other hand was a bit spotty. Server forgot my beer. Our entrees took quite awhile to arrive. A couple who were seated after us (by just a couple minutes) received their entrees well before us. They were almost finished by the time ours arrived."}
{"text":"Ordered takeout Thursday night, yummy..   I noticed the portion size from eat-in/take out was different. When you eat in, it seems like you get twice as much food, so note taken.. Food was awesome.. oh, and the chicken I ordered last time wasn't called Wonderful chicken, but \" Amazing Chicken\", hehe.. either way said, it was good..."}
{"text":"My wife and I had a carryout order of orange beef and general's chicken with white rice. All were good and fresh. The chicken was thick and juicy, not thin and tough slathered with sauce to cover the poor quality of the meat. The sauces were very good. Polite service over the phone and in person."}
{"text":"I have been going to this restaurant for years. I always get my food to go 3-4 times a month. I was a little disappointed when they took away the coupon from the value pack because it made it a little bit more reasonably priced. However, I remained a loyal customer, Until now! I will no longer be purchasing my Chinese food from Shangri-La. They have raised  their prices tremendously and put a very bad taste in my mouth.  You shouldn't be so greedy Shangri-La!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with some coworkers.  The place was pretty busy because of the lunch rush but we were seated promptly because we called ahead.    They have friendly, fast service and reasonable prices.  The food is just ok and pretty typical of the Chinese food in AZ.  Just some protein and veggies in some sauce.  Noting great.  Just blah."}
{"text":"Delicious and one of a kind. The customer service is excellent. You have to try the pan fried dumplings"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Chinese restaurant.     And it is close to where I live.    I have an awesome time each time I go.    Everyone is extremely friendly and customer oriented, even when I get my order to go."}
{"text":"This restaurant charged me $8.00 for egg drop soup 2 1/2 cups. They are a rip off. I'll never be back. Wished I never had the flu and I wouldn't have gone there in the 1st place. What a bunch of thieves."}
{"text":"20 years ago as a kid a friend's mom took us here. I remembered it being good, in fact it is excellent.  My kids and I are total snobs when it comes to Chinese food. I hate paying and they hate eating things inferior to our own escapades in the kitchen.   We ordered beef skewers, crab puffs and soup for appetizers.  The beef was tender and marinated/seasoned well, crab puffs had homemade as opposed to commercial grade wrappers which was a nice treat. The sizzling Rice Soup was delicious and the the meat was not tough.   The main course was Orange Chicken and Chicken Chow Mein listed as Mandarin style on the menu (meaning soft not crispy noodles). The chicken had a perfect light breading, nice and crisp upon biting and the chicken was a quality cut, no gristle, very juicy and tender.....the sauce involved no artificial orange colors or flavors, cavities from high fructose sugars.... just a perfect balance of salt, citrus and garlic. Chow Mein was equally delightful with fresh veggies, seasoned well, noodles were cooked to perfection.   We didn't order any egg rolls but I saw a few walk buy and they were the size of small footballs. Next time we will get those....as for this time we are so full we are packing it up and thanks to the generous portions my kids have lunch for over the weekend."}
{"text":"By far the best Chinese cuisine in the area. I've tried several take out locations in the area but Shangri-La has become the go-to for me. Awesome and friendly staff and the best Chinese food in north Phoenix."}
{"text":"Horrible service.  We went to this restaurant today (Saturday, September 10th at about 3 PM).  The manager on duty was a \"Lisa\".  We were 3 at our table with a 1 year old baby.  The baby started crying (we were trying to quiet him down) and she came over to tell us that she had other customers present there that we needed to quiet the baby or take him outside.  Her approach/comment was not needed.  She left and went to the other tables and told them \"sorry I've asked them to quiet the baby down but they refuse to\".  Why instigate anything (we never refused to quiet him down).  No said anything to her (most know very well that small babies will cry).  I went up to the register to pay and this same manager assisted me and then my sister came up to the register (the mother of the baby) and the manager left the register to have another employee take over.  I then asked that employee for her name to submit this complaint.  As my sister finished paying, she told the manager that she didn't appreciate her instigating issues with the other patrons, she replied \"I don't appreciate you\".  So of course my sister replied back tell her she was a B**** and to that, this so called manager replied F off F U in the presence of all the other patrons.  Horrible customer care- horrible experience."}
{"text":"Warning  beware:   When you order VEGETABLE PLATTER u also get a chicken wing.  Why??? I don't know   I told them I don't eat chicken and the lady was trying to educate me to tell them ahead of time what food I can't eat...  HOW will I tell them to remove something that's NOT on the MeNU!!!  It definitely did not say chicken wing on the side.   ???LADY I WILL NoT ARGuE with you for a $$8 dollar lunch food. I was just here because I'm in town for the holiday and my grandma have been coming here for 10+years. I just wanted a vegetable platter because I have been eating to much meat. VEGETABLE PLATTER! without a chicken wing on my plate. Just vegetables!! vegetables!"}
{"text":"Been coming here for over 12 years. Nothing fancy but great dishes and huge huge portions under $10. Hands down best egg drop soup in town. Favorite dish of all: House Chicken"}
{"text":"You most likely will not agree with us on this one but that's OK and I say that because of the Yelp Rating and the crowd I saw while dining here my Yelp is being based on two lunches .  As soon as we were seated we received a bowl of chip crumbs that were dripping with oil and a small dish of what I think was sweet and sour sauce the color was  red .  Next came our cup of soup and we both picked Egg Drop the soup was actually very good and fresh and  that made me think our meals would be great !  Soon our meals came and they were VERY LARGE and also came with egg rolls and fried wantons both were fried to a cigar color I didn't eat them and steamed white rice (the rice was good) But my meal called Amazing Chicken had this sauce on it that tasted like sweet and sour sauce mixed with wing sauce and I tried to eat it but after a few pieces I lost my appetite and it is a shame because the vegetables were fresh and nice , the chicken was tender juicy not spongy it was cooked nice but that sauce killed the dish for me .  My husband didn't care for the sauce that came on his lotus dish but I think he didn't care for the fried rice even more because he thought it was rice with basically just soy sauce .   Nobody checked on us .  When the busboy noticed our pushed away plates he didn't even ask if I wanted to take it with me...guess he knew I didn't"}
{"text":"This place has some of the best egg rolls I've ever eaten! The house special chicken is also pretty awesome. It's my go-to Chinese takeout place, and I'm so happy we found it and it's right around the corner."}
{"text":"Great lunch menu very friendly people.  I always get the sesame chicken lunch special with fried rice.  Always a great experience!!!"}
{"text":"This is an \"old school\" style Chinese restaurant.  I've only been here for lunch, but the food is GREAT!  There is always a generous lunch special, but anything you order will be delicious.  I started going here in 1990, and the food is as good today as it was back then.  The service is efficient and fast.  The flavors are fresh, and the food is fresh.  This is one of the most consistent restaurants out there.    They have the real freshly made tempura shrimp that almost no one serves anymore."}
{"text":"I always really enjoy the food here.  The egg drop soup is excellent.  The egg rolls are always really big and packed full.  I always go with a side of the hot house mustard to dip it in.. My go to entree is the orange flavored beef.  It's delicious.  I've had a few other things on the menu as well and it's good every time."}
{"text":"Shangri-la is located in an old strip mall a mile north of Metro Center,  Shangri-La has been here for ages, though, and it's a neighborhood staple. The decor is nice-nothing fancy, however,  nice and clean. The staff is friendly and quick to take care of you.   The entree portions are generous, and even sharing with my lunch companion  I had plenty of leftovers. However, the food is just fair.  The sweet and sour chicken was drenched in red sauce and a thick hard chunky coating.  The chicken lacked any seasoning and just wasn't very good, as was the rice and fried wontons. However, the egg drop soup and eggrolls were very good.  The service at Shangri-La is great and the staff is friendly, I just wish the food was better."}
{"text":"I went here once a few years ago and then again about two months ago. YUCK! They're expensive and the food is gross! They're fried rice is bland and dry. Lemon chicken sauce was gummy, so was the sweet & sour pork. Soup was bland and nasty smelling. I don't know what people like about this place, maybe they've never had good Chinese food and think this is what it's supposed to taste like. Go up the street to 43rd and Cactus and get Chung Ming, then you will know what REAL Chinese food is supposed to taste like."}
{"text":"We took my parents here for dinner and ordered the family dinner special.  $13.50 per person gets you a cup of won ton soup, an egg roll, crab Rangoon, egg fried rice, almond chicken, sweet and sour pork, and then, if you have more people you get more items.  We got broccoli beef and the house special chicken since we had 4 people.    Won ton soup - a bit bland.  I like that it had lots of BBQ pork in it, but it could use some more flavor. Egg roll - nice and crunchy, but it tastes like it has cinnamon in it.  Not a fan of that. Egg fried rice - great flavor but I wish it wasn't so full of onions. Sweet and Sour Pork - very good. Almond chicken - ok. Broccoli beef - the broccoli part was great, but I wouldn't eat the beef.  My husband said it had a weird consistency like maybe it wasn't actually beef. House special chicken - this dish has potential but would be SO much better if they used white meat.  All of the chicken in this dish is thigh meat so it's extremely fatty.  They don't appear to make any effort to remove the fat before breading and cooking this chicken.  Overall I would eat here again but not sure I would do the family dinner.  I would prefer to be able to pick the dishes I get in a family dinner instead of having them chosen for me."}
{"text":"Can't beat the lunch specials. The combo of the week is always good. Egg rolls, crab puffs. Are always fresh. Recommend lotus delight, garlic chicken, pork foo yung ."}
{"text":"Okay okay... I have to be honest here. I've never been a fan of Chinese food and I use to cringe when people wanted to go until my grandfather took me here. I now crave Chinese food. Man do I love this place! I have never had a bad plate, the portions are very large, and the service is top notch!"}
{"text":"I would say that the food here is basic Chinese that tastes like any other Chinese restaurant.  It wasn't bad but also not memorable or special.  Our waitress was a lovely lady who was kind and helpful.  I didn't care for the girl at the cash register.  The food will hit the spot but don't expect something inventive or extra fresh.  Just run of the mill Chinese."}
{"text":"Server was not answering my questions. I asked are the rice served brown or white rice? She keep saying steamed. Eventually I gave up and said ok. Then I ordered vegetable platter (badically stir fry) and asked to replace the meat with tofu. She wants to charge $2 to replace it with tofu. I have been asking to replace meat with tofu at a plethora of chinese and Asian places without any problems. Are you saying tofu is $2 more expensive than beef, chicken, and shrimp? Then we have to serve our own chips. They just brought it over and set it next to us. My friend eventually got tired of waiting and got it himself."}
{"text":"We've been coming to this restaurant for almost 35 years. We made a reservation for Mother's Day today and paid a premium for the food because they had dinner prices all day (not sure why?). The food was great, as usual, but we were with a large party and they made a mistake with our tickets. We didn't make a big deal about it, just asked for a new ticket with the correct entrees so we knew what we were paying for (there were no descriptions by the amounts). The cashier and waitress stated we should be able to \"figure it out\" based on our existing amounts and that they were \"too busy\" to draft a new ticket. Yes, that's what they actually said out loud.   I respectfully, but assertively, advised the server and cashier it is not my responsibility to surmise my correct bill from the info provided. They acknowledged the error, but I'm not going to pay for food we didn't order At that point, 3 different women started YELLING, yes yelling, at my husband in front of the restaurant...in front of everyone...on Mother's Day. They eventually did rewrite the tickets, but they were still incorrect; most likely because they were so focused on yelling and being defensive than listening to what needed to be corrected. Bottom line: we never got an accurate ticket, just paid what was there and finally left. It's a shame, as I said we've been loyal patrons of this business for almost 35 years, but I've never witnessed such lack of service, aggression, and egregious treatment of any customer in my life. Thanks Shangri-La, for making my Mother's Day memorable for all of the wrong reasons."}
{"text":"Favorite spot to hit during lunch and dinner. Friendly staff and great variety in food options. Portions are more enough to fill you up with great deals for lunch. I have frequented this location once ever week or so for the past year, and I have never had any issues with the quality of the food. Their hot and sour sour is amazing and is served in just the right amount during lunch time. Definitely a favorite amongst the locals as well."}
{"text":"Was meeting up with some friends for lunch and Shangri La Chinse was the place picked, it was around 2pm on a Sunday, and the place wasn't too busy and was seated right away.  After looking at the menu we noticed that the lunch specials were daily, from 11am to 4pm, we thought that was nice because most places only have lunch specials during the week.  I went with lunch special of the day, the Amazing Chicken, it came with side salad, choice of egg drop or hot & sour soup, egg roll, fried chicken wing and choice of steamed or fried rice. I went with hot & sour soup and fried rice. The amazing chicken was saut√©ed white meat with mixed veggies in a tangy sweet spicy sauce. It was good. Just need a little more heat for me.  When we ordered our soup, our server asked us if we would like the hot chili and mustard and I said yes but it was never brought out to our table. Service was polite, but just kind of slow, like they forgot about us.   Everyone enjoyed their dishes, and we liked that the lunch specials are every day and I am sure this will become a new lunch spot for us to meet up at."}
{"text":"The restaurant was nice and clean. Health department A rating was visible. Food was prepared quickly and tasted good. The service was good. Kept drinks full and cleared dishes quickly. I would return."}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this place when I was nearby with my boyfriend. We were going to be doing something else, but got canceled so we decided to find somewhere nearby for food. We both googled places, and this one came up with a lot of great reviews, so we thought we would go for it.  Was nice to be able to walk in and almost instantly be told we could choose where to sit.  Then almost immediately upon finding a place to sit, we were asked for drink orders. We just had water and any employee that passed by our table was very quick to fill up our water glasses if they were even half way empty. When it came to ordering food, I decided on the Beef Broccoli. It was very delicious. The sauce wasn't too heavy with flavor. Definitely probably the best BB that I have ever had. My boyfriend took a little longer to decide and actually narrowed it down to three different choices between pork entrees. The waitress happily told us her opinion on the three and the flavor of each one. He decided to go with the Emperor's Pork, and was very happy. He almost ate his entire serving. Which anyone who goes there, knows that those servings are pretty good portions and then you have the rice!! All in all, great place to eat. I don't know when I will be going there again, since I don't live around that area. But it would definitely be something I would think about if I was in the area again for dinner. Definitely suggest this restaurant to anyone looking for a new restaurant to try."}
{"text":"On Christmas Day, we came here, our favorite restaurant. We have been enjoying the food here for ten years!! The staff is always friendly, fun, and professional.  The food is amazing, always fresh and delicious! Shangri-La has become a part of our family in the sense that nearly every family occasion there is a concensus that we eat here!!  You will not be disappointed!!!!"}
{"text":"I have lived next to this place for  just bout my whole life and I had never been here. My folks went last night and I hapen to try some of the left overs. I liked it so much me and my girlfriend went today for lunch.   All lunch specials come with soup, egg roll, and choice of white or fried rice. She was very happpy wit the egg drop soup but did need pepper and a touch of salt.. It had pieces of chicken, corn, eas, and onion in it. I totall like it myself and wanted a second bowl. She ordered the sweet & sour chicken. It was tempura battered the chicken and it was so crispy and the sauce was excellent. I ordered the same dish my folks got the night before which was Avacado chicken. Chicken, avacado, broccolini, bean sprouts, and a very delicious brown sauce. I was not expecting the food here to be as good as it was but if they have been in buisiness as long as they have they must b doing  something right. Ill be back , my dish was a dinner dish and it was $8.95 and the GF dish was a lunch special for $6.50. Cant beat that."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Chinese food restaurant. Their ingredients are fresh and high quality! Try the amazing chicken or the Mongolian beef!"}
{"text":"Pretty darn good orange chicken.  I was expecting the chewy type like Panda Express but it was surprisingly light and crunchy and the chicken was moist and tender and delicious! Egg rolls & fried rice were pretry good too.  The staff was super nice & attentive. Definitely will come again."}
{"text":"Recently visited from out of town and this place is just as good as it was a few years ago. Literally the dishes to the decor and most of the people are exactly the same. Definitely one of my favorite places to visit for Chinese food"}
{"text":"Wonton soup a bit different than most, but full of fresh ingredients. Egg rolls large, great tasting. Orange chicken and House Special Chicken were excellently prepared and presented. I had a Long Island iced tea and I appreciated getting the sidecar of the drink excess the bartender made. Service was okay, but we weren't always sure who our waitress was - not that it really mattered. Also, one of the waitresses (the one not so tall) talked very loud and could be heard throughout the restaurant - regardless of where she was. We don't live in Phoenix but enjoyed this restaurant thanks to Yelp and the ratings provided therein."}
{"text":"Love this place!!!! I go there all the time and Lisa, the manager is amazing. She knows me already and we both have a good time a chat every time I go in. Lol but we both like to pick on my boyfriend when he comes with me too. ;D love this place. Love the food. Love the people."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch today with a friend. I had the chicken teriyaki lunch meal. It came with soup and an egg roll and two crab puffs. Overall the sauce, vegetables, and egg roll was great. The egg drop soup was a bit bland so I added some pepper. My chicken was good but I had quite a few fatty pieces. There was so much food so it evened out. My friend had the sesame chicken lunch special and her food was great. The meal was only $6.50 for all of that food in a sit own restaurant. The server was curteous and fast."}
{"text":"Anyone who would give this place 4 red stars has no dought ever eaten Chinese food anywhere else. I started my meal with the fried wontons that the lady said had pork in them. Well if there was pork in them you would need a microscope to find it. Those same in the shape of flat wontons came in my wonton soup. My wife had the LoMein(soft noodles) tasted like spaghetti which I put some in my wonton soup to give it substance. They also need to have rules of conduct for their customers. There was a guy(a regular I might add) in there on his cellphone on speaker carrying on a conversation. I dought this place would survive in Chinatown in LA."}
{"text":"Best chow mein in town! The dining area is pretty underwhelming as far as decor goes but the food is always fresh and so flavorful!"}
{"text":"I was in Phoenix on Christmas Day, and stopped at Shangri-La for a take-out dinner.  The food was pretty good, no complaints there, but the lack of professionalism that I witnessed in the restaurant was pretty much unimaginable.  I saw a customer (apparently a repeat customer) get berated and purposely embarrassed by the staff of the restaurant, when he raised what appeared to be a reasonable concern.  Here are the details of what I witnessed:  The restaurant was fairly crowded, being one of the few local dining spots open on Christmas.  They had a policy that they added an 18% gratuity to your check for larger parties (pretty standard).  After one large party finished their meal, a man from the table brought the check to the front desk.  He said that while he understood the policy, he calmly explained that he did not feel that an 18% tip was appropriate due to the poor service the group received.  He detailed how a dish was brought to the table covered in sauce or juice, which spilled all over one of his family members, and the wait staff would not even offer to help.  In addition, he said that multiple dishes and cups were dirty.  While I can't validate the truth of this, I would expect the manager to at least be apologetic.  That certainly wasn't the case.  The manager (or at least, the woman acting as the restaurant manager), basically said, \"so one server wasn't good, and you want to punish all of us??  On Christmas???\"  All of this was loud enough for the entire restaurant to hear.  I think all the man really wanted was an apology, but then it turned even worse.  He was more frustrated and said that he thought the service was simply unacceptable.  The manager then started yelling at the man, telling him he was cheap and just didn't want to give a tip.  She started clapping and yelling \"you cheap\" at him and getting the rest of the restaurant staff and even other customers to clap and yell at the man as well.  She finally told him that he shouldn't come back (not that there was any chance that he would anyway).  It was absurd.  In all, I was saddened and disappointed that I gave this restaurant my business.  If I had not already paid for my meal, I would have simply walked out (something tells me they wouldn't have given me a refund if I asked).  I would strongly recommend NOT giving this restaurant any business, just based on the way I saw them treat a repeat customer on Christmas."}
{"text":"ordered lunch special moo goo gai pan and shrimp chow mein, its delicious and flavorful and it comes with a cup of soup,my daughter loved the egg drop soup...ambience is nice and service was horrible, server not friendly...asked a glass of ice from the lady who took care of our check and its been 5 mins and no cup of ice, i asked to the lady who was taking our plate and she told me that they are busy that i should just ask in the front when i get out,seriously!!!management should train their people and learn what custumer service is!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered the crab puffs before our dinner and they were over cooked and way too much fried stuff and little cream cheese.  Told the server and she just looked at me crazy and didn't even try to make it right and took it away. Then she didn't even take it off the bill.  you could clearly see from the plate  that I picked off all the fried things that were all on them so you could see that there was a problem with it.  But their was no attempt to make it right. And as she came up to the table she just stood there and stared at me picking off all the fried stuff off of them and setting on the plate and looked at me like I was nuts.  I have ordered those there before and they were like that They have gone downhill. Customer service here stinks. They all have attitudes."}
{"text":"So people like this place? After reading the mixed reviews, I thought it was probably really good food, but there were a few yelpers who got upset over something specific and panned the whole experience so I took my mom. Whoo boy.  Ambience: 1/10 I am giving them 1rather than 0 because they made an effort at Asian decor in the otherwise run down, dark, and dreary interior. And because after we had been there awhile, we hardly noticed the musty, moldy smell. At best it was dirty mop water, but was reminiscent of a house I was in where the toilet had overflowed and then they left for a week without properly cleaning it first.  Service: 9/10  I'm knocking off a point for the complete lack of energy, eagerness, personality, or other signs of life. And also because we were one of 2 tables and how tough can that be?  Quality of Food: 4/10  I'm being generous here. I didn't get sick - yet, and the food came out hot with the fried food crispy and not burned. But you have to know more than how to work a fryer to impress me. This is the kind of meal I could imagine if you went to the home of a very poor Chinese person for dinner and they were doing everything they could to stretch what they had into a meal. I ordered hot and sour soup and egg drop letting my mom taste both and choose. She chose the egg drop and liked it. I didn't taste it so I won't comment further, but we both thought the hot and sour had far too much pepper. If this had been my only experience with hot and sour, I would have concluded I didn't like it, but since I've had some very good hot and sour, I have to say this is just poor quality. I was surprised that the default rice was fried since at many restaurants there is an up-charge for fried since it requires more ingredients and labor. Well fried rice to these folks is apparently taking yesterday's rice (good start), but instead of actually frying it, you just heat it up and soak it with soy sauce - done.  Egg rolls, perfection on the outside, nothing but cabbage on the inside. I had the house special chicken. Again, fried to perfection.  I really don't like it when it gets soggy because of the sauce. But I think they forgot the special part as there was nothing special about it. The \"sauce\" in this case tasted like a watered down soy sauce, but the chicken was crispy. My mom had shrimp lo mein. Adequate, but nothing to write home about.   Value: 5/10  As many others reviewers said, there was a ton of food and the price is ridiculously low.  I still can't give them a high score for value  because a ton of mediocrity is still mediocre.  I actually would've preferred to pay a little more and getting something a little more inspired.    I ordered a cocktail.  It was meh - not going to give them any points off for that.  The glass was either dirty, or had hard water stains on it.  I won't be doing that again.  They brought out wonton chips as we sat down with sweet/sour dipping sauce.  Nice gesture.  My mom wanted to know why they brought us crumbs.  There were a few whole chips, but for the most part, it looked like what they had scooped out of the fryer (except not burned).  Not a problem for me since it was gratis.  I actually poured the crumbs into my soup to give it some texture, flavor, anything.    Several people came in to pick up take out orders.  They all seemed to be looking forward to it, so I guess some people like it.  If you know and like good Chinese, you will be sorely disappointed here."}
{"text":"Can't beat this place for lunch!  food is always great, probably the best soup in the valley! Service is always exceptional!  All these girls are so sweet and nice you want to come back just to see them!"}
{"text":"We have been eating here for years and love the house special chicken. The lunch comes with soup, fried rice and an egg roll. Every time we come to Phoenix we eat here first for lunch. My wife said this place was here when she was a kid. You can't beat the price. It's clean and great food all around."}
{"text":"Im here to give an update! The food here is unlike any Chinese restaurant Ive been to! Without a doubt!  But one cant help but wonder about the service. I always order take out (Im a kind of at home infront of my desk kind of lady). And I always, always leave a tip of no less than 20%. However, I think the last time I came here, may be the last time. Unfortunately.   I called ahead ordered my usual. But instead asked them to put the peanuts on the side instead of in the dish. The male manager wanted to charge me $2 to do that. Why? I sincerely dont understand this. Even the kind lady over the phone laughed at him. (I hope she didnt get into any sort of trouble).   I guess this instance and every time Ive \"dealt\" with the male manager has been enough to put me off. Im at a loss. And so is my belly.   Oh well!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite Chinese restaurants with good lunch prices and excellent food.  The Amazing Chicken is the best!"}
{"text":"My most favorite Chinese restaurant in Phoenix. Was introduced to this restaurant when visiting here in 1981 and when moving here a few years later just had to return for their excellent cuisine.  So many restaurants do not serve the crispy chow mein noodles which I prefer. They have a quite extensive menu and there are still dishes that I need to return there to try.  I have never been disappointed with anything here The decor is attractive. There are separate rooms so a group can be seated in the rear room.  There is a small bar inside the front door adjacent to a dining area."}
{"text":"By far the best Chinese restaurant in the valley. I'm from the east coast and you really wouldn't think that Chinese food would be regional in the US...with that said, the food out here is different than the east coast. I have been on the quest for a decent General Tso's chicken and this place has it. It is as close to what I am used to that I have been able to find. The service is reliable and friendly. I have nothing negative to say."}
{"text":"3 Things; The service, price & quality of the food, Shangri-La manages to juggle all three with great finesse! They have the BEST egg drop soup! It's a thick flavorful chicken stock with egg (of coarse!) corn, peas, Chinese cabbage and chicken meat seasoned perfectly. The crunchy noodles compliment the soup nicely. I've been a loyal fan of this place since the '80's and I can tell you it is CONSISTENTLY good. All of the entrees are wonderfully flavorful and served hot from the wok. They will gladly spice up or down per your request any dish like the kung pow chicken. The sauce served with the almond chicken is lovely and tuned perfectly for the dish. I have long since moved to Northern AZ but Shangri-La is a must do whenever I'm visiting Phoenix looking for great Chinese cuisine in a casual atmosphere."}
{"text":"Best Sizzling Rice Soup ever. Get a Large Bowl to make a meal. Large chunks of Shrimp, Chicken and Pork with Bok Choy and Water Chestnuts. A Light Hearty Broth. I ask for Chili Paste and p put Soy Sauce in mine to make a richer salty broth. Some people ask for extra sizzling rice or add Fried wontons to the top. It will sooth your soul on a cold day and is awesome when you have a cold.."}
{"text":"We were walk-ins for Christmas dinner.  The place was crazy busy and probably under-staffed.  But they seated us quickly, took our order promptly and it wasn't too long of a wait for the meal to arrive.  The food was great.  And, even as busy as they were, the staff was pleasant, polite and even attentive.  We'll certainly go back."}
{"text":"This is an Old School Chinese restaurant for sure. It has remained the same for over 20 years! The Moo Shu Pork is Awesome. I like it without the plum sauce. I always crack up when I hear about the \"Flaming Platter\" but it very good. This is not the best Chinese Restaurant out there I am sure, but it is very dam good. The service is always very good, and the price is very affordable."}
{"text":"their Shrimp With Lobster sauce is Not the real recipe at all.  The place is dirty and tables are not clean,service is awful"}
{"text":"I went here on a recommendation from my neighbor and I was pleasantly surprised! I will be back!"}
{"text":"This place has been a favorite of mine since I was a kid. I live in Surprise now and still make the drive down because their food never disappoints! The egg rolls are defiantly something else. Out of this world! One weird thing I recently tried was the bacon fried rice.. I know, sounds weird, but it is delicious! I also like the WonTon soup with added crackers, beef lo mein, and another odd one-garlic shrimp. Mm! Miss this place!"}
{"text":"Food was delicious and very fresh! had the egg drop soup which was delicious and flavorful as well as the teriyaki chicken and shrimp fried rice, another plus was that there lunch menu and prices are good til 4 most places only 2 or 3 pm   The ambiance was quiet which was really nice, lighting was a little low for my comfort but I quickly adjusted no biggie!  will definitely return when on this side of town."}
{"text":"The server was beyond rude, never cracked a smile and seemed put out by any questions. It was our first time there. The food ok at best and the place seemed older than dirt. At the end of our meal, they hit us with a 20% charge for tip since there was six of us. We weren't aware of this rule, and the sixth person was a minor at the age of 9. We never bothered the waitress since she was rude and didn't want to make her face move more than necessary when responding to us. So in our eyes they didn't earn a $20 tip! Won't ever be back and telling all of our family and friends not to bother with this place."}
{"text":"I have been on the hunt for decent Chinese food in the valley for years. Many places are ok, but often fall short on the flavor category in my personal opinion. Not Shangri-La! This is a hidden gem that I was fortunate to stumble upon. We went in on Saturday evening to try dinner. We ordered crab puffs, orange chicken, Mongolian beef, fried rice, and hot tea.   I really enjoyed the environment. We were seated quickly, and our tea and appetizer were brought out to us right away. Dinner also was served shortly after ordering and was so fresh! Portion sizes were large and we had so much left over to take home. It was a relaxing environment with the perfect lighting. This is something I do not experience very often when eating out when I really appreciated.  Our servers and hostess were attentive, friendly, and quick. I will be back multiple times in the future and I am going to tell all of my friends and family to try it out as well. I appreiate good service and great food!!!!"}
{"text":"So after reading mixed reviews we decided to call in an order for take out HOT SOUR SOUP WONTON SOUP ORANGE CHICKEN HOUSE FRIED RICE WITH BACON PAN FRIED DUMPLINGS 3 EGG ROLLS  1 ORDER OF CRAB PUFFS We are in for the night so I am anxious to see what the food is like.  We have eaten at 59th and Union Shangri-La before they closed   full review to follow.  There was such great food that there wasn't a thing I did not like.  Great meal"}
{"text":"WHAT?? $6.00 for a (maybe) one ounce shot of Vodka?? We wanted Tequila but the bottle was out and we didn't want to wait. We were ready for a shot to start this lunch off as we walked through the door and saw the bar as we entered! Having NEVER been charged $6.00 for such a TINY shot, we were shocked!! Hey, it is a TINY shot glass, at least fill 'er up!!!! This ain't no high end night club where someone hopes to drink up to the point of getting lucky with anyone who looks good after slamming a few! If you are looking to get drunk for that reason, maybe it would be worth it to some at any price!! In other words, there is SIMPLY NO excuse for charging so damn much for a dinky shot that barely gave us a buzz! Trust me, we don't need to get drunk to get laid, it is just an analogy, okay??! We would have done another shot, but we were suffering from sticker shock!! Hell, we can buy a WHOLE 1.75 liter bottle for what two one ounce shots cost!!!  This place would get five stars, not because we were drunk or even buzzed, but because the food deserves five stars...but he price of a shot blew a star off big time!!! We ordered the special of the day: Garlic chicken with chestnuts, onions etc., in a brown sauce with a super meaty chicken wing, a fried shrimp, a fried wonton, a chicken salad that was quite generous with the chicken AND soup for only $8.25!! DELICIOUS and the portion was beyond filling!!!   OMG, we all agreed their hot and sour soup was outstanding!!!! The egg rolls are the bomb, the size of a small burrito! They are the ONLY Chinese restaurant that packs your to go with soup AND fried wonton chips and sweet and sour sauce!! Oh, and they serve fried wontons and sweet and sour sauce like a Mexican restaurant serves chips and salsa!! What a nice and tasty touch!!   I even ordered some food to go because it was sooooo good!!! The food is a good value, but they need to evaluate the cost of their liquor!!!!"}
{"text":"I once loved this place. The food is still pretty good. But man there dinner is super expensive 14.00 dollars for white rice and beef and broccoli. Get out of here. I unfortunately went and dined in with kids and wife we shared large orders of  I could of went to pong pong Chinese on 35th and bell same if not better Chinese food for maybe 60-70.00 dollar bill I will never go back here they are on crack with these prices the food was good but not over 100.00 dollars good.  Customer service sucked and we ended up not leaving a tip because the whole package from pricing and the service just was not adding up for us to do so  1xsweet and sour chicken 1x beef and broccoli  1x beef chop suey 1xBBQ pork rice 5x egg rolls 1 egg drop soup  1 war won ton soup 5x sodas  Bill was 110.00"}
{"text":"I haven't been here for awhile since I've moved across town, but this still stands as my favorite Chinese restaurant in Phoenix. My favorite items are the Orange Chicken, Lemon Chicken and *the best* Hot and Sour Soup. Large portions, excellent quality. It was always very affordable, the lunch specials in particular."}
{"text":"Best food ever. Try their house chicken, orange chicken, EGG DROP SOUP is the best .  Wonderful customer service and prompt service always."}
{"text":"Tried this place based on a recommendation from a fellow foodie.... I love high end restaurants, but to find a mom and pop gem is so much better! And that's exactly what this place is... A gem. We arrived good and famished and left painfully stuffed as we just couldn't stop! Pan fried dumplings with a sesame soy dipping sauce.... I was just shy of pouring the sauce into a martini glass. The Sizzling Rice Soup.... slurp... mmmm... slurp, juicy pieces  of chicken and shrimp bobbing around in a wonderfully flavorful broth, fresh crisp veggies, chewy rice... slurp. Shrimp Fried Rice.... devine. Large fresh perfectly cooked shrimp. In between delicious bites we talked about what we'll get next time because we'll definitely be back.  Great service too... friendly, personable,  prompt and efficient."}
{"text":"We love this place!  We had our wedding rehearsal dinner here some 28 years ago and are so glad it's still here. We drive about 10 miles here every time we want Chinese food.  My wife always gets Mongolian beef and I usually get the garlic shrimp.  The Hunan shrimp & scallops are very good too.  The waitress here is as fun as they come!"}
{"text":"I went to lunch today based on the YELP rating and I was disappointed in the quality of the food. I had the Orange Chicnen and my friend had the house special.  In all dishes there was not enough sauce. It was as if sauce dished out with a teaspoon and the sauces were watered down. The hot and sour soup was to salty."}
{"text":"The food is delicious! The service has went downhill since the new owners took over though. They nickel and dime for any additional chips or peanuts or anything. Luckily the food is good or we wouldn't be back."}
{"text":"Nice, clean friendly Chinese restaurant. Everything from the Hot & Sour soup to the giant overstuffed Egg Roll was delish. A lot of food for the money, especially when it comes to lunch! Will definitely be back, try it you won't be dissapointed."}
{"text":"Our family loves this place. I am so confident in their menu that I order things I normally wouldn't order and I try new things with high expectations, which is rare if not impossible, seeing how I am the most cynical person ever.  The Amazing Chicken is savory, lightly salty, and crisp in a way that inspires one to slow down and cut the chicken into pieces so that it lasts as long as possible.  The Orange Chicken makes Panda look like a bum.  The prices for lunch are astounding, and when you factor in the quality of the food preparation and perfect portion sizes, this is THE BEST deal, and best Chinese food in the 85029."}
{"text":"First Chinese place that I have ate at in Arizona that is worth coming back to. The food was hot fresh. Employees super friendly attentive and quick service.  Best part there was not one thing that I did not like. Portion sizes are huge. Our table order the appetizers flaming tray, war wonton soup. And two dinner plates sweet and sour pork and generals chicken with white rice. super favlorful way too much to eat we actually took our dinner plates home. If your looking for real chinese food with great taste this is the place to go."}
{"text":"I moved to Phoenix from New York about two years ago and have been looking for a decent Chinese place ever since - I just tried Shangri-La today, and I think I've finally found one!  The food: I ordered way more than I needed for just myself because I wanted to try as much as possible. After eating a significant portion (I'm a big guy) I still had enough to pack lunch for the next two days, plus a few assorted items to snack on later.  The Shangri-La Flaming Platter:  Egg Rolls: The Egg Rolls were great! Definitely the best I've gotten since I've lived in Arizona! They were perfectly fried. The cabbage is tasty, not like the mush you find in egg rolls other places.  BBQ Ribs: Tasty Chinese style ribs. The meat is tough, but that's what you would expect from a Chinese restaurant.  Beef Skewers: My wife says they looked disgusting, but they tasted pretty good! Probably not going to order these again, but not disappointed by any means.  Honey Chicken Wings: I was surprised by how good these were. These wings are breaded. I'm not usually a fan of breaded chicken wings, but the honey sauce was awesome. Will definitely be wanting these again.  Fried Shrimp: Pretty standard Chinese fried shrimp (Standard for NY, I mean. For this area, they're ahead of the curve). Probably won't be getting these again, but not bad.  Crab Puffs: These were the biggest let down of the whole meal. The outside was tasty and fried to perfection, but the inside tasted like straight cream cheese. I'm pretty sure there was no crab in these at all. I'm guessing it was just a one-time type mistake or something.  Egg Drop Soup: Pretty good. It's a nice, light soup.  Bacon Fried Rice: This was excellent! The rice itself was fairly light, not heavy like the fried rice at some places. There are big chunks of egg, which I like - usually when there's egg in fried rice it's over cooked, but these were light and fluffy! And the bacon - we're not talking about little pea sized chunks, we're talking big inch and a half long strips of bacon, perfectly cooked. Yum.  Amazing Chicken: I'm torn on this one. On the one hand, I'm not crazy about the sauce. On the other hand, the chicken and vegetables were all awesome. Like everything else I've mentioned, the food is all cooked right and I could tell from eating this that I won't be disappointed if I order something else from here. Don't get me wrong, I don't dislike this dish or even the sauce, it's just that I'll probably go with something else next time.  Overall, the food is easily the best Chinese I've had in Arizona. There are a couple items which border on \"It's okay\" but there's also a few items that were flat out excellent. The one real complaint I have is the Crab Puffs, but I'm sure that's not usual, and I can tell that they probably usually taste good.  The service was actually pretty good. The woman was friendly and made a bit of small talk with me. She asked if I had ever eaten there before, that kind of thing.   As far as the location, it turns out I live under a mile away from this place. I pass it all the time, but never realized it was a Chinese place. There is a sign on the building, but it faces away from Cactus Ave. If the building was more clearly marked, I would surely have started eating here long ago.  If I could give half stars, I'd be giving 4.5, but because of the few hiccups, I'm giving it a four. Would definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"First time here; tonight for dinner. The service leaves little to be desired.  Our server wasn't pleasant at all. He acted as though he was doing us a favor.  The food wasn't bad. I certainly wouldn't call it stellar but it was eatable.  I think we will continue to look!"}
{"text":"I really LOVE the Amazing Chicken. It's truly delish. I don't like green pepper so I ask them to hold the them & give me more carrots, onion, etc. And they did. I ordered the meal for 2 for $30 & it included 2 main dishes - which I could choose (with an $11.95 price point), 2 soups, 2 crab puffs, 2 egg rolls, fried rice, & \"fried chips\". I was able to get the dishes I enjoy most 1. Amazing Chicken and 2. Chicken w/ veggies (like Moo-Goo-Gai-Pan but with more veggie selection). Both dishes were made with all white chicken - that's how they come - and I definitely like not paying an up charge for all white meat.   I'm telling you it was hot, fresh, made how I like it & DELISH!! I'm serious when I say all other restaurants that serve Moo-Goo-Gai-Pan can't even touch Shangri-La's. It's so much more flavorful & not so bland as you get at most (if not all) other Chinese restaurants.  I'm never disappointed with the taste, quality (freshness) & temp of the food.   I got home & it fed 3 of us & we still have some great left overs!   My only disappointment... I wish they allowed some substitutions - don't get me wrong they'll hold something & just give you more of the veggies already in the dish bit they won't add a veggie that's not listed in the description. Maybe they could allow substitutions on some things & not on everything... But then again, why not? Anyway, that's the only reason I gave it 4 not 5 stars.   Try them... you'll probably join me in saying this is one of the BEST Chinese you'll find this side of the valley."}
{"text":"Amazing chicken is amazing.  I have tried other places and can't find anything like it.  This is the only Chinese food I will eat. We drive from Maricopa to get it."}
{"text":"my family and i revisited this place for dinner after such a long time and i must say that they still have their touch. the walnut shrimp is delicious. the vegetable chopsuey is just in my liking. the hosts remains to be friendly and considerate of our diet restrictions."}
{"text":"Chinese....yuuummmm!   I have been going here for as long as I can remember. They opened in 1982 and I remember my Grandma taking me here regularly. I am 31 now so....I have been going there...FOREVER. I now take my girls there and it's one of there fav places to go. Their is a reason a privately owned 80's decorated chinese restaurant that is located in the most not busy area of phoenix  has been able to stay open for almost 30 years. It's the food! I honestly have always ordered the same thing so I will tell you what that is  and a little insight on what my other family members think of other things.   The lunch special is the best deal. You get soup, 1 item such as house ckn or sweet and sour ckn etc, giant egg roll, 2 fried wontons and fried rice.   Egg Drop Soup - Yummy. This is the only place that I will get it. I have tried other places but no go.   Sweet and Sour - My Mom and Step-Dad get that and absolutely rave about it.   Beef Skewers - TO DIE FOR! That is all that needs to be said.  House special Chicken. So freaking good! It's original and delicious. I recommend it highly.   My husband gets the Orange chicken and loves it. He is the pickiest person I know and he loves the place.   I have never ordered anything other than the Hot Tea to drink. It is one of my fav things about going. I remember as a kid putting one ice cube and 3 packets of sugar in my little bitty cup. Now it's one ice cube and no sugar and I love it.    The portions are large so you will have left overs and nothing is better than left over chinese!"}
