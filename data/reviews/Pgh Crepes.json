{"text":"Today I was at a rowing meet and I can across this food truck called the PGH Crepes Truck, and the food was kind of disappointing.  From the get go the food truck didn't have a really nice feel too it, which set up some red flags for me. I first wanted the Walnut crepe, but they were out of walnuts. The one thing you should always do is be prepared for lots of customers so you don't run out of food.

So instead of the Walnut crepe I had the S'mores crepe. Even though my standards were low, the S'mores crepe still seemed to hit below my already low standards. I can understand that bagged marshmallows and gram crackers are cheaper, but the one thing I can't stand is canned whipped cream. It's not that hard to make a good whipped cream, all it takes it heavy whipping cream and sugar. 

In all not a good experience, and not a bad one ether, but I know I will be making different choices of where to eat in the future."}
{"text":"2.5 stars, if I could. The crepe itself was mediocre, and fillings were skimped on a LOT. (Including powdered sugar... very odd.) I ate the crepe fresh and it had a weird rubbery texture that you would expect from a much older crepe, and was hardly sweet at all. Would not eat again."}
{"text":"This cart sometimes sells crepes on Pitt's campus on Bigelow between Forbes and Fifth. I've tried the veggie crepe and one with strawberries and Nutella. It's more expensive than some other food on campus, but for crepes, it's pretty fairly priced. I love watching my crepe being made, from the batter being poured onto the pan until the foil-wrapped triangle is in my hand. 

The veggie crepe has tomato, spinach, cheese, and basil sauce (which I asked them to go light on). It was hot and delicious, though maybe a little too cheesy for my taste. The sweet crepe was made with fresh diced strawberry, a little powdered sugar, and the perfect amount of Nutella. It was also delicious.

As for the comment about the utensils in an earlier review, there's been a little basket hanging off the window with utensils and napkins when I've been there. The foil-wrapped version makes for a convenient and handheld food (though it does get a little messy at the end, especially since I didn't want to waste a drop of Nutella.)

The owner is very friendly. I'd get something from here every time I saw it if I thought my wallet could take it. For now, though, crepes are a treat (which is, perhaps, for the better)."}
{"text":"I just tried their new American Crepe!!Omg that is soo good! And I loved how ground beef , mushrooms and green onions tastes together.!I missed you, guys."}
{"text":"The best crepes, if you didnt try it yet go ahead and try it guys. You wont be disappointed. Its always good to try something new :)"}
{"text":"Very good exotic food for this city. French crepes with strawberry and banana are delicious"}
{"text":"What a lovely surprise a food truck at work.

I had the spinach, mushroom, pesto etc. crepe.  It was DELICIOUS.  I was able to watch the cook create my lunch.

I couldn't walk away without dessert.  I ordered a strawberry, blueberry & nutella crepe.  Again DELICIOUS.

I am not a food truck person so I was happy to see a napkin & fork already in my takeout container.

Definitely look forward to eating here again."}
{"text":"Food was amazing! They serve both sweet and savory crepes, with many different flavor combinations and fresh ingredients. The service was fast too. We'll definitely follow this food truck to other venues, no doubt. I could take down a good many crepes in one sitting, I'm sure, and it's not like the portion sizes are skimpy either."}
{"text":"Hot crepe on a cold day. Really fresh veggie crepe with basil sauce hit the spot as did the chicken ranch. Nutella crepe looked pretty good but that'll be for later."}
{"text":"I'm glad that I was finally able to stop by the truck before I moved out of the city, because I've passed by it so many times for years and always have wanted to try it.  I wanted a savory crepe (I will likely go back for a sweet option sometime this summer), so I decided on the veggie- which was better than I expected.  A lot of people make veggie crepes with a liberal amount of cheese, but the cheese to veggie ratio was great.  The guy working at the truck was nice and quick (though I wonder during peak times if I'd want to wait).  The crepe was $6, which I thought was a couple dollars overpriced- especially compared to other food trucks on the same block that offer much more food for less money.  I'll try to stop by for lunch again soon."}
{"text":"The Crepe truck was parked in front of Espresso a Mano and my friend was keen to try the crepes.  There were a bunch of handwritten signs dotting the window of the truck.  No credit cards, cash only (despite the truck displaying a variety of credit card options), no bananas, etc.

I ordered a strawberry and nutella crepe.  It was $5.  What a letdown.  The girl making the crepe didn't have nearly enough batter so about one third of it was \"lace\" rather than an actual crepe.  There was maybe a teaspoon of nutella and maybe one or two strawberries diced.  That was it.  My crepe did not come close to resembling any of the pictures on the truck and not close to any of the photos posted on this site for this food truck.  Skimpy, skimpy, skimpy.

It was OK.  There were no sugars or anything else to put on the crepe.  They provide a napkin put no plasticware.

Next time I want a sweet french treat, I'll go down to La Gourmandine.  For five dollars you can get a substantial, wonderfully baked treat and a coffee for the same price."}
{"text":"I would say this was solidly ok. They had food trucks up at WPIC that I visited. It was super quick but I didn't feel like they had a lot of options and they were all pretty ordinary. They also let someone butt in front of me and served them first (I know it's mostly the guys fault who butt in front of me but still pissed). I had an egg and cheese crepe first but the only sauces they had available was ranch whereas most crepe places have bechemel sauce which is really yummy. Second time I got a fruit crepe but no whipped cream. lame."}
{"text":"I thought it was impossible to mess up crepes, but mine was awful! I would've rather eaten a tortilla with Nutella! This was dry, chewy and bland. It didn't have that moist, spongy texture you'd expect. I could literally tap on it and hear the hardness of it. I paid $8 for this! I would be a little less upset if the staff wasn't so rude and dismissive when I was so polite and cheery. I would never eat this again, and I'm not hard to please. I DID eat this at Kennywood Park, so I completely understand they could be busy, but that shouldn't affect the quality."}
{"text":"My kids love this place, specially banana nutella crepe.  They have crepes truck too.  Awsome service"}
{"text":"I love a food truck, but this one definitely disappointed at Kennywood Park last night.  I should have known when they didn't have a line at all, but I was hungry and it was right there.   

I ordered the strawberry, banana, nutella and a bottle of water.   I stood there and watched as it was cooked and filled.  So I saw him pile the strawberries in really early and then cut up a half rotten banana right on top.   The entire thing was warm all the way through, which did not hit the spot in 85 degree weather.  I'd have preferred the fruit to be a little less cooked; because served warm as it was, it was a mushy mess.  

$11 bucks for the crepe and a warm bottle of water.  It's 85 degrees people - you should assume that people ordering water don't want it to be 85 degrees as well."}
{"text":"I visited this food truck when it was at the South Side Works Fall Food Festival on Sat.  I wanted to hit both this truck and the PGH Pie Guy, but at the time that I arrived (5:45pm), the pie guy was packing up.  Because this was the only other truck at the event I was interested in trying, I ordered a chicken ranch spinach crepe and a strawberry nutella crepe so that I could try both a savory and a sweet variety.

Based on the other reviews for this food truck, I was expecting the flavor of these crepes to be great.  Unfortunately, however, this was not the case.  The chicken ranch crepe was bland tasting, even despite the ranch sauce.  The strawberry crepe had a better flavor profile, but it still wasn't super-exciting.  It consisted only of chopped strawberries and nutella, with none of the powdered sugar or whipped cream mentioned in other reviews, so I can't help but wonder if I was shortchanged.

One other issue was the lack of napkins and utensils.  Given the messiness of both types of crepes, I expected these to be available, but I wasn't able to find any.  While I am not averse to eating the crepes by hand, doing so made for messy eating, and I wasn't able to clean up afterwards due to the lack of napkins.  While I'm not a huge napkin user, I was left with a messy mouth and hands after eating the crepes that I had no way of cleaning up, which further detracted from my experience.

While I hate to leave a negative rating, I feel that I have to in this case, given the various shortcomings and lack of redeeming factors.  If napkins and/or utensils had been provided, I'd probably be willing to award 3 stars, but at present, I'm awarding 2.5 stars.  If you like or want to try crepes, there's a place on Craig St. in N. Oakland I'd recommend leaps and bounds over this food truck."}
{"text":"They did ok.  had their strawberry nutella + chicken something something before.  
cash only.
I bet the workers there are all part-time, so you see a lots of new faces making the crepes, hence no consistency.

Biggest issue being their opening hours.  Havn't seen them for a while now.  feel very much a hit-or-miss."}
{"text":"I found this food truck in Carnegie on a Friday night. Not having an opportunity to eat crepes often, I was excited to try this place and so ordered the chicken ranch. 

Good thing it wasn't crowded because I think the gentleman who was making my crepe was new and it took a little longer to make than I would have thought. I also got about a third of the way through the crepe before realizing that there wasn't any ranch on it and had to go back to get some squirted on. The crepe itself was more filling than expected and was big enough to be a meal by itself. 

The crepe overall was just ok, nothing really special about it. I would still get it again but would probably try a breakfast crepe instead."}
{"text":"Saw them at a food truck round up in Lawrenceville. Had the banana and nutella and chicken. both were equally good. Spent so much time in Paris. I missed crepes so much. Thank goodness there is the Pgh Crepe cart. They make it just like Paris. Better. In Paris, the filling is very thin, almost paper thin. Here is a good portion. Thanks for the crepe!"}
{"text":"Literally the best crepes in town. Had the Gyro crepe last time at Kenneywood and was amazing! I asked them them to make it crispy and they did it very well"}
{"text":"Who loves crepes? I do, I do! And these were yummy too, good job :)"}
