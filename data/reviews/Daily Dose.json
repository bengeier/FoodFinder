{"text":"I'd love to give Daily Dose 5 stars. Just can't.  The service is too spotty.  One day, service is great, the next it's terrible. Food is consistently very good.  Great for breakfast and lunch with an underrated happy hour."}
{"text":"Good food, good drinks, good service. The soft pretzel bun for the burgers is delicious!"}
{"text":"i just want to say that since i moved away from scottsdale I literally daydream about the food at this place.  i am OBCESSED with their housemade veggie burger and pretzel bun and my better half loves a lot of their meatier dishes~ We do miss the RIBS you guys used to have when we are in town. We love that they have one of the best local beers, Orange Blossom from Papago Brewing. You literally can not go wrong at this place...they will have whatever you want and it will be delicious!"}
{"text":"The service is always fast, staff is friendly, and the food is fantastic!!!!!!!  Love this place. Steak and eggs was perfect."}
{"text":"My hubby had the flannel hash... AMAZING. I had the cilantro, jalapeño hummus for an appetizer (my hubby doesn't even like hummus but he liked this) so good! And for my meal I got the tacos with Chicken! YUM-O"}
{"text":"I had a breakfast dish and loved it.  Another time I had a salad and it was spinach and dressing."}
{"text":"I can't understand how this place gets good reviews.  I ordered salmon which came with an Asian slaw type thing and I ordered a side salad as well.  The side salad, in complete disregard to it's name, arrived 10 minutes before the food.  Fair enough, I'm still getting used to American dining practices but it made for an awkward moment with the person I was eating with as they had no side dish to arrive early and stare at...Anyway, when the food arrived I genuinely couldn't taste the difference between the salmon and the vegetables, so bland was the flavor of each.  A restaurant that can't make fish and carrot taste different from each other simply can't be good, right?"}
{"text":"Little else compares to Sunday brunch with friends!  Simply put, this is a great spot! The food was great, the service was great, and prices were comparable to other restaurants. I usually enjoy a bloody mary with Sunday brunch, but I think my expectations were a little too high. My all time favorite is that of Orange Table. I went for the Bacon Bloody Mary and would not repeat. I would definitely return for the food.  I ordered the Flannel Hash which was YUMMY. Friends ordered oatmeal, pancakes, and the benedict. All were amazing! It was well worth the 20 minute wait for a table."}
{"text":"Called while in the parking lot Sunday around 1130 and asked if there was a wait. Was told no wait. Walked in and they told us it was a 30+ minute wait. Seems like a policy of lying about wait time to get you in the door."}
{"text":"I love this place.the food and the staff are exceptional. I eat here most days for lunch and always feel like a very welcomed guest. My favorites are the lox and bagel(and im from nyc) the open face roasted turkey sandwich is delicious as well as the stuffed portobello mushroom egg white   dish. Thanks kaylee,sylvia,jessica,alan and the gagg for making every visit end with a smile. With hugs-mark w"}
{"text":"Love this place lots of interesting twist to normal breakfast items. It takes you a while ti decide what to get because everything is good. Great lattes and love the pig and bagel. Definitely recommend for breakfast!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place, especially with the new menu additions. One of the best burgers I've ever had! Also the onion rings, mahi mahi tacos, and chicken pasta are fantastic. Customer service is awesome, and the decor is beautiful"}
{"text":"Well, overall I have to give this place 3 stars.  We usually go for breakfast and try to sit on the patio as it seems less noisy.  A pet peeve of mine is not writing down my order and then not serving me what I ordered.  This has happened several times here where my order was not prepared as I had ordered it.  That being said, the breakfast nachos are probably the best thing I've had there. My husband loves the prime rib and eggs. We eat out alot and are always looking for a good breakfast place."}
{"text":"Very disappointing. I ordered the \"Pigs In A Bagel\" (Two eggs, peppered bacon & tomato topped with cheddar, served on your choice of bagel with herb potato & fresh fruit) and I also asked the waitress \"how do the EGGS come?\" And she said \"scrambled\" so I just thought it was going to be a bagel, with scrambled eggs, slices of bacon on top, tomato, and topped with the cheddar cheese. I get my \"sandwich\" and it's a little squished bagel with a gross omelette inside with tiny bits of bacon and tomato, like a drop of some white cheese, and some wilted lettuce, really un satisfying. The booth we were sitting at was so freezing that our food was cold within 5 minutes. The manager offered to get me something else so I just asked for a mixed berry smoothie to  go to play it safe. I thought it tasted kind of milky so I opened the lid and there was a huge pile of whip cream, yuck. Since when do breakfast sandwiches come with lettuce and smoothies come with whipped cream? Very strange. Our waitress also seemed like she could care less about us and I think we were there for almost 2 hours, super slow and ridiculous. Don't think I'll be going back there."}
{"text":"So many choices! Perfect for a group where some may want a breakfast item and some may want lunch. Homemade lemonade is perfect, not too sweet. Loved the banana bread french toast as well. My group didn't really love the DD hash but the meal itself was filling."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in Old Town. The food is great, the prices are reasonable, and the atmosphere is great. Very chill vibe. I eat there at least once a month and the staff is always friendly. I love to take family and friends there. Everyone I have brought with me loves it."}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast on the way out of town.  Very nice.  I had the biscuit and gravy which was very tasty.  The gravy actually had a sweetness to it.  Loves the potatoes and onions.  Good coffee."}
{"text":"In town for a wedding and thank you Yelp for this gem of a place!! Service, coffee, and food were all nothing shy of amazing. I had an iced almond milk latte, the espresso was delicious! Mom and I both got the two eggs with turkey sausage, fruit, and upgraded to the mixed berry protein pancakes. Easily the best pancakes I've ever had!   Turkey sausage was very tasty. The fruit mix was super ripe and delicious. Dad got the two eggs with turkey sausage, sourdough toast, and potatoes. The seasoning on the potatoes was delish. I would be here all the time if I lived here!! If I'm ever in Scottsdale again, I will be back!!"}
{"text":"It gets a little busy on the weekends but the Hangover Breakfast Sandwich with butternut squash hash is just Fantastic!  We will be back again."}
{"text":"Has become a weekend staple for breakfast or brunch, as the line out the door has shown increased patronage.  Most things on the menu are in the $10 range, whether breakfast or lunch.  DD has a great urban feel to the decor and lots of happy hour specials.  I'm a fan of the Daily Dose burger as you don't have to add ketchup or mustard.  The nachos are monstrous and glad to see a place still serve fruit as a side."}
{"text":"The menu is pretty amazing, lot's of stuff I want to come back and try! Seems like they have a lot of drink specials too!  Had the Naked French Toast, the side of acorn squash was a bit odd, would love to see some regular hash browns on the menu. The pricing is pretty decent and the staff are pretty nice (a bit slow) but nice. Definitely a place to just come and hang."}
{"text":"Great place for a breakfast meeting.   Breakfast Nachos are solid!"}
{"text":"I really use to love this place but it is just not the same  Prices increased happy hour bites and the hours keep changing. Just don't trust you anymore"}
{"text":"One of the best breakfast I've had. Period! Black Forest ham omelette with Poblanos holy poo!! So fricken Great"}
{"text":"The Banana Bread French Toast and Black Forest Ham Eggs Benedict with DD Hash was excellent. The service was right on and the price was just right. I will be back! Thank you for making my weekend better."}
{"text":"Cute little place. Hummas with edamame was different. Calamari steak appetizer was tender but lack taste. Will return to try more."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch last week and had the most amazing turkey burger!!  There is a hint of sage that marries perfectly with the airy crispiness of the pretzel bun.  Their pomegranate green iced tea is also refreshing and delicious.  They even give you a to-go cup!"}
{"text":"So far, this place serves the best breakfast I have had in Scottsdale. Nice menu. I had the Southwest Flannel Hash AND the Banana Nut Bread French Toast (I thought my friends would try some of the French Toast, I was wrong). Both portion sizes were quite adequate for most appetites. Both were also fantastic. I'm going into a food coma. Service (Miranda, if I'm not mistaken) was quick and friendly. Despite a full restaurant and bar, our food didn't take long at all to come out. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"My dinner experience here was ok, but breakfast here is where it's at! Some very guilty-pleasure french toast and pancake choices. The Benedict was very good - really good sauce, a must for Beni's. My new fave breakfast spot since Orange Table moved to Tempe."}
{"text":"AMBIANCE:  Trendy - Urban - Upscale Casual (small tho' - between inside & patio, only seats 99 total). Very nice modern decor - tables made of white agate suspended in some sort of lucite. Nice art on walls. Good size booths.  FOOD:  We had the famous pretzel bun burger w/fries and the Ancho Chile Reuben w/combo fries. Both were totally De-Lish!  The bacon on the burger was 100% real and cooked on a grill, just like home.  Also the red pepper aioli and bits of basil leaf added a subtle new flavor to the same ol'burger.  Burger was cooked as ordered: a beautiful med. rare.  The Ancho Chile Reuben was HUGE!  Tasty with only a hint of zing.  Crispy fries rounded out the huge plates & portions are large so come hungry (combo fries are the crispy fries and sweet potato fries mixed in together- great for sharing).  We had tea as a beverage - fresh brewed and excellent.  SERVICE:  Everything was great -with one exception:  our waiter never asked us if we wanted more tea.  He was back several times - asked if we wanted dessert, etc.  He was nice, friendly, pleasant & accomodating when we needed an extra minute to decide on our order. But, not offering a refill on the drinks (the glasses were empty before our plates were) made a difference for us in the tip:  would have been 20% but instead left only about 16%.  OVERALL:  We did not have a long wait time as others described.  May be because we were there at 3:45 p.m. on a weekend and not a busy meal hour during the work week. Food was absolutely excellent and we will definitely be back - gotta try the Breakfast Nachos!"}
{"text":"I'm picky about where I'll drink black coffee, and prices and atmospheres don't sway me. I've been to no-nonsense coffeehouses that charge $2.25 for delicious coffee and I've been to stuffy hipster joints that charge $6 for a small black coffee that tastes how I imagine mud would taste, and I don't go back. I'll go back to Daily Dose. It's surprisingly tasty for being so trendy. I actually think the cream ruined it. The food is great too. I got a crabby omelette with a side of fruit and it was really good. I thought I was making a mistake by going on a late Sunday morning for brunch, but they actually got us a table pretty quickly (like within three minutes) and our server was a really nice guy. I was really happy with my experience and I can't wait to go back. If it were in my budget, I'd make it a weekend tradition!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast and coffee around. Made only better by the friendly staff and fantastic food and drink options available. I will be back next time I am in town."}
{"text":"This is one of those great quite places that you can have a morning meeting in or just relax and enjoy your day.  The food is always great. The service is some of the best that you can ask for. I love the corn beef and fried egg as well as the biscuits and gravy. Oh and lets not forget the coffee I would go there just for a cup of coffee and a quite place to read a book. If you are looking for a good morning out with amazing breakfast look no further."}
{"text":"I went on a weekend, so the wait was long. I had a bfast burrito which was pretty good, and I ordered a bloody mary that was ok."}
{"text":"Food and service were great.  Staff very helpful with local tourist spots and coffee to go.  Kid friendly."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast. Sat at the bar with Kyle as our server. If you are in scottsdale this is the place to eat breakfast."}
{"text":"Had the Caesar salad with chicken.  Dressing was bland. Service is good..nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"I would definitely recommend trying the salmon omelet with DD hash as the side.  The berry protein pancakes are also a must!  The prices were really great; we had a salmon omelet, veggie omelet, and two side pancakes for only $30."}
{"text":"My husband and I had a great lunch here.  Very tasty and interesting combinations of ingredients.  Great service from Brenna, too!  Looking forward to our next visit."}
{"text":"I eat here regularly and I have to say, the place never disappoints. The staff is always friendly and the food is delicious. The Straight Shooter with buttermilk pancakes, scrambled eggs and sausage is my favorite. The signature cocktails have real fruit in them and happy hour includes a big food menu.   I know for a while the wait times were lengthy but the added dining room fixed that. We hardly ever have to wait for a table at lunch time. I would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and good service. Had takeout dinner with salads and entrees. Both were excellent especially the salad. Will return soon for the happy hour."}
{"text":"Honestly not much to write here. Food was okay. Nothing spectacular, but nothing bad either.   Service was okay - sat at the bar with what appeared no designated waitress which made things a little more difficult - was never checked on and had to ask for coffee."}
{"text":"This is our second year in a row eating at Daily Dose. We loved it so much, we ate 2 of our 3 breakfasts here this Spring Training trip. Last year, we ate there on our last day in town. Several things make this an outstanding breakfast/lunch spot. First, they use fresh ingredients & make many of their own products. For example, when you ask for jam, they bring out house jam, not the usual packets. Second, the menu is interesting & varied. We thought we could probably eat there for a week & not repeat a meal. Third, portions are big and satisfying. If you walk out hungry, I would wonder about you - seriously! My son is a big eater & he couldn't finish his plate (granted he was noshing off my plate & sharing part of a pancake with his dad), but still...They have GF pancakes & what they call \"stuffed\" pancakes. The cinnamon roll pancake (not GF) was awesome according my guys. Omelets are 3-egg served w/ potatoes, fruit & toast. The variety is good. I loved the Chile Verde & peppered bacon omelets. Both were great, plus they note on menu which items are GF. My son had corn pancakes with chorizo which he loved. He also liked the Hangover Sandwich. Be warned: there will be a wait if you go during normal breakfast hours. It can go over an hour at times. They serve free coffee & water while you wait & have some chairs in front. Wait staff is friendly & helpful."}
{"text":"I came in and had the Stack. I don't eat meat very often, especially not at restaurants, but the idea of a french dip-esque sandwich appealed to me.  The roast beef tasted cheap, and it tasted microwaved. You know the fatty, tendony, bland taste that cheap meat offers? This sandwich sat in my stomach like a grease ball. The regular french fries were tough--don't even know how it is possible for fries to be tough unless they were stale or old or something.   There was absolutely nothing memorable about this sandwich whatsoever. The menu is pretty unimaginative and the vegetarian options were pretty poor. Wow, ANOTHER restaurant that has a portabella mushroom sandwich for vegetarians? Pinch me.   The tomatoes on my sandwich were crunchy and still green, I am not even joking.   Finally, the pretzel bread which was supposed to be amazing tasted like every other enriched-white bread roll I have ever had. There was nothing memorable about it at all and I was frankly puzzled by the enthusiastic response to it.  Hint: The prices are affordable because they order the cheapest produce, and cheap nasty meat. I came to a restaurant for a sandwich because I wanted something more exciting than packaged deli meat from the grocery store could offer. I failed, and won't be coming back here ever again."}
{"text":"Sat out on the patio. It was packed but the atmosphere was awesome and so was the cool breeze. Service was prompt and helpful, but not overly so. We had chips and salsa as an appetizer. The salsa had great flavor. For the main course we had fish and chips. It was average and nothing spectacular but no complaints on my end. Happy hour is from 4-8pm and had great deals, very affordable."}
{"text":"Delicious! The honey wheat pancakes tasted amazing! Eggs were cooked perfectly. Sausage was yummy. My cappuccino was great! Our waiter Spencer was accommodating and friendly. We sat outside which was breezy and comfortable. Overall great brunch! Would highly recommend."}
{"text":"I couldn't rave about this place enough!! I loved this place so much that I went back 2 times!! The outdoor seating is beautiful and the waitress and waiter that I had were so extremely nice. Each time I went, I got the strawberry creme brûlée waffles (I think they're called). These are amazing waffles with piles of strawberries and a smooth cream sauce drizzled over it with a helping of whipped cream on top! Yum! It's so great that it doesn't even need syrup. The first time I went, it was a Saturday and it was about 11:00 AM. Although there were people lined up outside waiting for tables, they got people in very quickly. I believe, that we waited about 15-20 minutes for a table of 4. That was nothing considering they have a nice seating area outside of the restaurant. I couldn't be happier with this lovely restaurant!"}
{"text":"I don't go out for breakfast often, so when I do, I want it to be goooood...Daily Dose lived up to all of my expectations. They have so many options, but we went with the eggs benedict with turkey sausage and the berry protein pancakes. Both were absolutely delicious - the hollandaise on the benedict was tasty and light, while the turkey sausage was super flavorful with a tiny bit of spice. The berry protein pancakes seem like they'd be too healthy to also be delicious, considering they're made with honey wheat batter and protein flax seed granola, but they're amazingly good...I wish all things so healthy could taste so good. Service was terrific - prompt and friendly. With The Breakfast Club just up the street, Old Town is lucky to have two great breakfast spots!"}
{"text":"What a great place to turn your happy hour into dinner! Small plates make a great meal at prices under $7. One of the best places in Old Town where you can split a bottle of wine for $17.50, grab a few apps and be on your way for under $30! The service is always fantastic, the atmosphere is poppin!  Don't be afraid to bring your kids either - the menus is full of great choices and they'll keep busy with Rylan's puzzles.  Love this place!"}
{"text":"Daily Dose has disappointed me a few times in the past; however, the food is NEVER one of the reasons. Service has been spotty (long wait times for intro/drinks, mid-meal, or bill time), no ice in drink or maybe a spot on a fork (immediate replacement with apologies and smiles)...but every single time I have been there, I was greeted at some point by the owner, and the food was ALWAYS consistently superior to any other breakfast place in Scottsdale. That is the one reason I continually come back. If they mess up my coffee, I know they will replace it with a smile and a meaningful apology. But if I order a turkey sausage omelet with DD hash on the side, it will always be delicious and spot on with no issues whatsoever."}
{"text":"Love coming here for there veggie burger it is amazing. Services is always great and it is not to loud. Great place to grab a bite and visit with friends."}
{"text":"They had several craft beers on tap.  Very good selection.  I went during their happy hour, kobe beef hamburger $3 off.  Pretzel bun, awesome food and atmosphere.  Definitely will go back and try some other food on their menu.  My service was excellent and food delivered quickly."}
{"text":"I have been here no less than five times since discovering this place on Mother's Day.  At one point I had been 4 weeks in a row.  Of the five times I've been here, I've eaten breakfast four times and lunch once.  The first time we came with at least 8 people.  This was a bit of a problem, because they only have one area where they can seat a group of more than 4.  We didn't mind waiting though.  Second time, same scenario, but we were treated to an order of the breakfast nachos for having to wait so long.  Thumbs up for the management.  Third time with a group, no nachos and still a good wait.  Overall I'd say be prepared to wait if you are dining with a crowd, but it's worth it.   I consider myself a breakfast connoisseur, and I can honestly say this is one of my favorite places in the central phoenix/scottsdale area.  I've had the following:  Blueberry Ginger French Toast (wonderful, loved it) PB & J Waffle (x3, my favorite item on the menu) Grilled Cheese (great for lunch, fries are also tasty)  Side of bacon (phenomenal) Side of sausage (just the way I like it) Side of sourdough toast (crispy, but not burned)  I still haven't tried the pancakes, but I think that's next on the list.  They have a beautiful patio, so when the weather cools down again, I'll be sure to dine al fresco."}
{"text":"Sunday morning breakfast was a treat today. For starters parking was easy and convenient. They had a good crowd but no wait. Walked right in and was greeted by a friendly hostess. Got seated right away at bar. Service was prompt and server was attentive and knowledgeable. However I did have to ask fir the check. Quality of food was better than I expected. Got crab omelette....being from maryland im a crab cake snob but these were good. Could have used some old bay..whole grain toast was thick cut and fresh..appreciated butter and jam in metal ramikins and not packets. Jam was amazing...I also got to sit next to the most important man in the world who felt the need to interrupt the server EVERY time she came over to me. Server was patient and I believe this guy might be in need of mental help. But I digress..price was good for the value..I will be back and cant wait to try lunch.."}
{"text":"The service was excellent the atmosphere was nice and congenial. But the food was fantastic the pancakes with bacon and everything about it was delicious! Oh and the coffee was great too!"}
{"text":"Loved the place. Had the Turkey White-out. Yummer!  We will be back for dinner or lunch.  But they are really busy and the servers have a hard time keeping up but I think but they did their best. We drove from the NW  valley ! They were worth the trip."}
{"text":"The best appetizers and salads in old town!  Try the citrus salad with grilled chicken.  Great service, not pretentious or stupid people around either, nice, huh!?"}
{"text":"Breakfast was amazing. Huge portions, you can definitely share a plate if you are like me that eats light breakfast. The service was great and the atmosphere was inviting. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Every now and then I stumble across something that blows me away, and believe me when I say, \"This place did just that\".  I live in the far southeast valley and rarely get to Scottsdale. WELL, That was before I had breakfast at Daily Dose. I had the Smokey Stuffed Portabella Mushroom and my daughter had the Chorizo omelet. This little gem offers something different and exciting for every palate. If in the area...Or not, Make a point to stop in. You'll be so glad you did."}
{"text":"Food is okay, but WORSE SERVICE EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!! The management sucks, as well as the servers. Also the place is veryyyy dirty. I would not eat there!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"the food is consistently good and so is the coffee.  i have yet to find a better breakfast place."}
{"text":"It is our first time visiting this place. We arrived at around noon, we waited for about 20 minutes for an outdoor table. We didn't mind waiting because they offer self-serving regular coffee, iced coffee and cucumber water just outside the main entrance.  Our name was called and Jeanine care of us (which did an amazing job as our server!) and decided to have Crab Cake Eggs Benedict and Banana Bread French Toast.  Both our plates were delicious and so was their coffee (which we're told is from a local company).  We'll definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times, mostly has not lived up to the hype.  Decent food but it's hit and miss.  Long wait on the weekends."}
{"text":"This is the kind of place I want near my house until I think about how often I'd like to be there. There is a very varied menu and everything is top notch and a very good value. The staff is nice and friendly and there's an outdoor patio with misters. I can't say enough about the corned beef hash, so incredibly tasty and a sizable portion. Love this place!"}
{"text":"I was looking for another awesome breakfast restaurant apart from T.C. Eggingtons and found the Daily Dose.  I have been here a handful of times and loved everything I have got! Great place for mimosas and breakfast food!"}
{"text":"Great place with lots of options (breakfast, lunch or dinner). Good, consistent staff. Sometimes there's a relatively long wait, but that has improved greatly since they expanded. Favorite drink: sangria margarita swirl (it's REALLY good!!) Would definitely recommend if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"Awesome!! The menu is great. Good choices for cocktails and coffee drinks. I had the polenta poblano Benedict and it was delicious. Also had the cinnamon roll pancake, it was very sweet but very good. Such a fluffy pancake. My boyfriend had the huevos rancheros. His eggs were over cooked and the beans were under cooked. But at least that means they cook the beans rather than get them from a can. And he still enjoyed his meal and we still give the place 5 stars."}
{"text":"Despite the long wait to be seated on the weekends, my group waited even longer for our food making our Daily Dose experience just over 2 hours. Breakfast is legit, their staff on this visit was not. After 3,600 seconds, or one hour, our vacant server informed us the 'kitchen' had lost our ticket."}
{"text":"If you like Denny's then you've found the right place! Food was horrible. Ate 3 bites and couldn't stomach the rest. Staff was pleasant. Unfortunately would never go back."}
{"text":"Not quite a five-star rating, but I ate here Wednesday and the hostess/waitress was nice, the food was served promptly. I was there for happy hour, which I found to be quite a bargain - much appreciated these days. The chorizo mac and cheese was inventive and provided a nice creamy flavour with just a hint of of spice. My friend ordered a salad, which she seemed to enjoy. As appetizers were half price during happy hour I figured I ought try another appetizer, and got the meatballs marinara. That was decent as well, though the bread gets a little soggy in the marinara sauce. Dos XX beer was $3, so an affordable afternoon out. Would have appreciated some German beer though - am getting tired of the Mexican/American beer dichotomy at so many restaurants.   Happy hour even extends to 8pm. All-in-all, I was happy my friend recommended this place."}
{"text":"Great food (the chorizo omelet is excellent). The staff is very friendly - ask to sit in Ryan's section. Will come back next year!"}
{"text":"Went there after work with friends for dinner and happy hour.  The food and drinks were quite good, and our waiter was super friendly.   A nice, clean little place with a mellow atmosphere.  Ill be back."}
{"text":"Great breakfast;  omelets, chorizo, pancakes, etc.  We had a great meal and a cool atmosphere."}
{"text":"We love the daily dose! The atmosphere is always casual and welcoming.  We had brunch this morning, and our service from Brenna was wonderful, as always. The service is great, and the food is divine.  I recommend anything off the \"Health Nut\" menu for breakfast... healthy AND delicious. And, don't forget dinner... Green Chili Chicken Enchiladas -- yum!"}
{"text":"I went for breakfast today and I'm already wanting to go back for lunch and dinner. The 4 of us ordered: 2 orders of eggs Benedict, 2 orders of side biscuits and gravy, a gingerbread pancake, a pb&j waffle, a gladiator burger, and a protein & iron breakfast. Can you believe we ate it all? Seriously, no leftovers and they were huge portions! The waitresses checked on us numerous times with sincerely friendly, smiling faces and made sure the food got to us super fast and hot. I am beyond impressed with how well this place has their service figured out and the design is beautiful! I honestly can't think of one single thing that is wrong with Daily Dose."}
{"text":"Great breakfast spot but be sure to come ealry or be ready for the wait."}
{"text":"I'm completely astonished by the positive reviews!  My family and I went here this evening because we had been to the one in Phoenix and were pleased but I cannot stress enough the terrible experience we had.  The waitress forgot to put in an order and we were almost done before the meal came.  She never once came to explain or apologize and an apology would have gone a loooong way.  She basically ignored us from then on - put on your big girl panties and deal with it.  We asked for the manager who was either ignorant or arrogant but regardless his lack of managerial skills, social skills and communication skills simply made the entire situation worse. We explained we were there for a celebration and were told we would be given a dessert.  A different waiter attempted to put the dessert down on our dirty table because no one could be bothered to clear it...really????  So WE cleared our table , so that he could put it down and did we then get utensils to eat the dessert?  Nope.  The original waitress finally reappeared to see if everything was ok - seriously?  Were you on vacation the past hour?  And then on our bill we were charged for the long awaited meal and the dessert we were told was to be on the house.  Again, the manager with the seriously deficient intelligence ignored us - did he go to the same school of stupidity the wait staff attended?  And then he kept us waiting even longer for the new bill, which was a complete joke.  The food was average but I'm guessing the reason it was so completely dead in there on a Sat. night in Scottsdale is because the manager and staff are inept, rude and pathetically incompetent.  Oh, but thanks to the really brilliant waitress who gave the scotch to the 17 year old!  And the IQ points just kept continue to drop...."}
{"text":"Should always come to this location. Best food and service. Can really make a girl happy here. Their other location needs to learn a little something something from here."}
{"text":"Our waiter Adam was great. There was no wait when we arrived at 8am on a Thursday morning. The food was very good too. We ordered the green chili pork omelette, huevos rancheros, eggs benedict tostada, and a peaches & cream pancake."}
{"text":"Amazing menu, service, atmosphere, and food! I had the Gingerbread Latte and Smoked Salmon Eggs Benedict! If you are a smoked salmon fan, definitely get this :)"}
{"text":"DD is a great HH spot in Old Town, especially when you're looking something a little more hearty or quality to eat (ahem, Bungalow, Salty's, Loco and other mediocre to poor food offenders).  DD's rating is a huge beneficiary of my love for fantastic beer on tap, and offers up 5 great microbrews....including an IPA *drooling*.  The food is good to very good, and the only complaint I have is pretzel dough on a hamburger is just way too heavy!  The burger itself is fantastic.  On my first trip, they were woefully understaffed which = bad service and angry Little Lady, but my last visit was much better and our server was cheerful, attentive, and split the check 300 ways as we had a large party.  Any server that can smile while trying to handle that math deserves a hefty tip.  The patio sits right on Scottsdale Rd (as do most establishments adjacent to the road) but it's not too noisy.  HH goes until 8, and with an eclectic mix of cocktails, beer, and wine, there is something for everyone.  Looking forward to breakfast at the Dose!"}
{"text":"For breakfast this is one of the best places to eat in Scottsdale. Everything is good.  Service was great. They do give you way to much food, i would reccomending splitting something.   Breakfast Nachos, Peanut Butter N Jelly Waffles, Biscuits N Gravy, or the Omelettes"}
{"text":"I love this place. Good food regardless of what time you go but breakfast is definitely the time they shine. I get French toast when I go but for lunch I got the Mac and Cheese for lunch.    Great service and great food"}
{"text":"This was my 2nd visit at the Daily Dose, both are on Saturdays, both are for brunch, and both times the wait was about 20 mins. You know it is a popular brunch place, and of course in a good location as well. However, as the services were pretty slow for both times and the food did not 'wow' me at neither times, I just have to give an average ratings...   What I like on both tries? The orange juice! Yes, it was fresh and delicious! The Prime Rib omelette was pretty good as well, especially if you add a few drops of Tabasco for a spicy hint, it just tasted better! However, what I did not like, the Smoked Salmon Egg Benedict... The dish arrived kinda cold, feels like it was sitting on the counter longer that it should have, the english muffin was over-toasted which it became hard to cut,  the poached eggs were not done so well (i think they were too flat by the shape?), and there was too much of the Hollandaise sauce on the top and it just stole the taste of the smoked salmon... how I wish it was better.  If you are in the area and look for a place for breakfast/brunch, Daily Dose is still a good choice, just be prepared for a wait on the weekend and avoid the Egg Benedict?"}
{"text":"The places looks good, there's a line out the door, but they are cheap on bacon for the BLT sandwich. It had two pieces total for the entire sandwich. When I ordered extra bacon it cost $3.54, for three pieces of bacon. Not happy that a BLT now cost me $13.53. To the manager, please Don't be cheap with the bacon, it makes your nice restaurant low end.   On the positive side I had the burger and it was very tasty. My wife did like her BLT, but  won't order it again. I would have given this place 4 stars if not for the bacon."}
{"text":"I love this place... loved it better when nobody else knew about it!  Breakfast is always excellent.  Banana Bread French Toast (I'm not F'n with you) nuff said!!!  Happy hour menu is great too, try the calamari with the red sauce.  The Burgers and sandwiches are great too!  Hard to go wrong at the Daily Dose."}
{"text":"This was the first place I dined out at when I moved to the Scottsdale area two year ago and it still to this day ceases to amaze me. Every dish I've ever had for every meal: breakfast, lunch, or dinner has been delicious and satisfying. I recommend the breakfast nachos for groups at brunch, the hangover sandwich for the hungry meat eating man, and the decadent banana nut French toast for those with a sweet tooth. Consistently high quality coffee which they dispense liberally as well!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  The food is delicious and the service is great; the staff are so friendly!  The Manager stopped by to ask how our meal was going which I thought was a really nice touch.  They also have TVs so you can watch the game if you want.  The place is spacious with enough seating; we've never had to wait for a table, even during peak brunch time, which is great.  I highly recommend this place for brunch."}
{"text":"Gave two stars only because of the manager at this place..  Came here for breakfast with my boyfriend.  Food and service were good. So for lunch we decided to come back here and brought our kids with us. Everything was going well.. until I saw a little spider in my salad :) (and it didn't upset me at all being honest.. If I found something like a hair or nail or a cockroach it'd be disgusting. But tiny spider.. well it's hot in Arizona, all these insects are everywhere, it's not great but what can you do) So I didn't even want to tell about that to a manager but kids did. And his reaction was interesting.. He didn't believe me. He asked me like ten times if I'm sure it was a spider, if I'm sure it was in my salad, if I'm sure I really saw it. Like really?!  In a situation like this a wise manager would just apologize and would take this item out of a check. But this manager said because I already ate big part of the salad he'd take only part of the price out of the check.  Like really?!  Whatever...  On a bright side the place is good, they bring you water with cucumber in it, very refreshing . The rest of our food was pretty good."}
{"text":"Eat at Daily Dose two times a week, food is great and staff is very friendly. Really enjoy the omelettes. My friend ordered biscuits and gravy he said they were the best. Sit at the bar and you will meet very interesting people with great stories. I am always  willing to move over a chair, it's just courteous and the polite thing to do."}
{"text":"Have eaten here before, never any issues.  Ordered take out today, Grilled chicken on pretzel bun and iced tea.   The Desert Rose tea was really good, however the grilled chicken was very bland and the worst part was the chicken was so tough that it ended up getting wasted.  Out $14.    Should've gone to Gelato and Pizza Spot, their sandwiches are delicious (and less expensive). And their fountain drinks and iced tea are under $2!!"}
{"text":"Hands down, the BEST breakfast/brunch spot in Scottsdale, quite possibly the entire valley (I'd even take it as far as \"Best of AZ\").   Every single item is delicious, my husband isn't big on breakfast foods and he loves this place.  Fantastic way to kick off your Sunday Funday, boozy brunches don't get any better than this!"}
{"text":"The food was excellent and very good quality.  The service was good too.  If you are looking for specialty waffles and pancakes this is the place to come.  They have a decent amount of gluten free options as well.  If you have a big party I probably wouldn't recommend coming here bc when we tried to call and make reservations we found out that they do not take reservations. The place seems to always be busy so I just don't foresee it being a good place for a party bigger than probably six individuals. It's sad bc I would love to be able to bring bigger parties here but until I can make a reservation I do not feel comfortable. Overall this is a good restaurant and the food is excellent!"}
{"text":"The best breakfast in Scottsdale, hands down.  Some favs:  Banana Bread french toast, gingerbread peach pancakes, breakfast nachos, biscuits and gravy, the hangover sandwich, giant omelettes and excellent coffee.  You can't go wrong with this place."}
{"text":"Great breakfast...homemade turkey sausage will bring a smile to any carnivores face!  Fruit cup crisp and fresh...home fries packed with a lot of flavor!! Hot chocolate was a bit weak on the flavor."}
{"text":"My friends and I were in town for Spring Training and were looking for breakfast place walking distance to the stadium.  DD caught my eye on N. Scottsdale Rd. since it was bustling with action.  Tired and slighty hungover we gave it a shot and were pleasantly surprised with the food.  I thought the food was good and the service was very good.  Attentive server who as friendly and got our day off to a good start.  One thing I can't be sure of is if the Spring Training crowd slowed the kitchen down.  The food did take over 20-25 min to come out but when your having a bloody mary and trying to remember things from the past night that wait goes by fast!"}
{"text":"Probably mine & my bf's 7th time frequenting this establishment. From the mixed berry protein waffle to the chorizo eggs benedict this place is a must for breakfast. Yeh, you should really try the last. If you like chorizo you will surely enjoy the benedict dish. My bf always gets the breakfast nachos which I have to say are pretty darn yummy! The nachos consist of chorizo, egg, tomatoes...and all kinds of good stuff.  Plus for us that they allow dogs on the patio. Most the time it is a bit tight with our 2 dogs on a busy weekend but today (sunday) we arrived at 7 a.m. and had the patio to ourselves.  Service is at a decent pace any faster and I would feel rushed. Any slower and I would give this place 4 stars.  Servers are friendly enough.  We have also been here for lunch which is just as nice with good options. I had a strawberry chicken salad, tasty. Only complaint chicken was on the dry side.   Overall, DD is consistent and that I like. We know we can expect yumminess every time we visit."}
{"text":"Wow. Where do I begin..? We went there last weekend with 12 people for a bachelorette brunch. We had spoken to a manager weeks before because they didn't take reservations but were told they could accommodate a big party if we were to get there a little early. The day of, I called and they said to come in 20-30 min before to set it up.I got there 40 minutes before the rest of the guests were to arrive. When I got there, they said they had filled up and was going to have to wait...so I waited..and then waited...I waited for an hour an a half. I kept checking in with the hostess and \"manager\" who were super rude and kept telling me to wait. Our entire party arrived and we were still waiting. My sister told the manager that the hostess was very rude and he didn't seem to care. They were pretty terrible. Finally, we got seated. We ordered our food, all the food came out except for mine and my sisters (thankfully not the bride) and we waited...everyone finished with their meals and ours was still not there. Finally it showed up, and guess what? A hair in my sisters food! The waitress didn't seem very apologetic but they didn't charge us. Just for our coffee, which I thought was lame too. It wAs a pretty awful experience and we won't be going back. Thanks a lot daily dose for ruining a bachelorette brunch with your rude service!"}
{"text":"Whether its a happy hour outing or a hung over brunch this place never disappoints. I like how there is a cucumber in the water and the wait staff is always very friendly! The portion sizes are pretty huge so depending on how hungry you are, you can take home some left overs!"}
{"text":"What a really pleasant surprise!  We stopped by for a late lunch on a Friday afternoon.  We had no great expectations and as we were walking in the downtown area of old Scottsdale decided to have lunch at The Daily Dose.  We never heard of it or about it before, but their menu looked interesting.  WOW, we were blown away!  The chef at this restaurant really knows what they are doing.  Our meals were the SW Chicken Salad and the Po-Boy (chicken) with a chef salad.  The flavors, freshness, taste, and portion sizes were excellent.  Be sure to try the \"crispies\" (cheese bread) that comes with the salad.  It is awesome.  The overall value was OK too.  Two of us plus coffee for both came to about $30.  The service was very good as well.  Do not pass this one up, if you get a chance to eat here.  You will not be disappointed, for sure."}
{"text":"Always quick and amazing service! Foods delicious for me (vegetarian) and my friend! Never had a bad experience there! Wish id been there for happy hour more often. Love it! Always the best breakfast in town! :)"}
{"text":"The food was excellent- P B and J waffle w compote and the Hangover sandwich. But the service was terrible , too many servers trying to service Everyone With no coordination between them. It took way too long-  they brought the wrong coffee and then replaced it w the correct one and charged for both . Manager was too busy trying to explain the mistakes away instead of acknowledging the problems and apologizing  or god forbid comping us for the coffee. Too bad the service seriously detracted from the creativity and qualitivity of the food . Won 't be back."}
{"text":"Good food and good prices don't make up for slow service.  We decided to go to Daily Dose only because we saw they had outdoor dog-friendly seating. The hostess said the wait time would be about 20 minutes. After about 10 mins of waiting, we saw a bunch of tables open up, yet nobody was being seated. After another 20 minutes of waiting,I asked the hostess how much longer it would be before we would be seated, she said another 10 minutes at least. The table we were eventually seated at had been empty for a good 15 minutes. Meanwhile, half of the other patio tables are empty as well... Slowly the hostess seated some of the other waiting customers.  Our waitress was very nice and pleasant. She recommended a delicious berry sangria which was amazing... We were later surprised to find that the sangria cost only $4... We decided to stay for another glass once we saw the check.  The food tasted good. Hefty portions and delicious turkey sausage. Now, I'm not much of a sausage eater but this was some darn good sausage.  I went to the bathroom and eavesdropped on some other customers who were complaining about the really slow service. I didn't pay much attention to it because they seemed like the whiney complaining type.    I would recommend this place if you have endless amounts of patience for the slow service. At the end of the day, the food was good. Bonus points for allowing dogs outside.  However, we contemplated leaving before we were seated because of the idiot hostess. She made my blood boil."}
{"text":"Ate here after reading about the burgers on pretzel buns.  It was every bit as delicious as I imagined.  I was disappointed when I read that on Fridays, burgers are half off, but when I asked the server she stated that that was only after 4pm.  I wished they had advertised that little bit of info too.  The crispy fries were delish as well.  Loved that pretzel bun.  Will go back for that for sure."}
{"text":"Had lunch on our quick tour through town. Service was good - food was great. Loved the Caesar portabella mushroom wrap. Good beers - wish we would have tried the bacon bloody Mary!"}
{"text":"Always on a wait. Always waiting on an ardent server to take your order. Always has delicious gingerbread pancakes and gladiator burgers. Always greeted by one of the friendliest owners in oldtown."}
{"text":"Nice location near shopping and old town. Breakfast was Delish! Lots of choices on the menu and good service. Outdoor sitting available and not too noisy. Worth a return visit!  Healthy portions if you're hungry!!"}
{"text":"This place is one of my absolute faves.  They have a well rounded reasonably priced menu.  The food is fantastic and they have a happy hour with some great deals.  I ate there last Sunday with my boyfriend and our bill was $7.91.  We had  two chicken sliders with fries ... A smoking deal if ya ask me.  We were both pleasantly full and walked out paying 12 dollars after tip.  Great food, friendly service and super value - highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Ate there a few weeks back for the first time. My buddy had the hash, which was very greasy and over cooked. The waitress recommended breakfast nachos? Not that good. Chips piled with eggs, cheese sauce and then put under the broiler until it was completely dried out. The Atmosphere and bar etc was very nice. But, not the food so much. My first and last time."}
{"text":"A group of friends and I tried this place out last weekend and I was so glad we found it! There is a great happy hour that lasts until 9 pm and it covers entrees, appetizers and drinks. I was able to eat and drink for about $14 and I even took home leftovers. The atmosphere is fun and the waitstaff was friendly and very capable. I plan to go back again, loved it!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place- service is good, people are nice- great ambience, but the food has been less than par. I have been 3 times, trying something different each time, and each time disappointed. I have had the stuffed portobello, eggs Benedict and hangover sandwich- all much more bland than one would expect. Too bad, I will stick with D'lish and orange table"}
{"text":"Stopped here in Old Town on April 5th after early flight in.  Outside tables were full so we sat inside.  Very nice atmosphere, servers very pleasant and checked in frequently on us.  Husband had the chorizo scramble which came on a large oval plate with potatoes, toast etc.  Looked great and got 5 stars from him.  I had the smoked salmon bennie, also delicious and very comparable to that served at many restaurants in nyc.  I usually stay away from breakfast fried potatoes, but these were excellent crispy on the outside and soft inside AND not greasy.  Coffee was especially good here; maybe they use the Starbucks from next door?"}
{"text":"Being locals and a native Phoenician my wife and I were recommended daily dose a few years ago and it has become one of our absolute favorite go to breakfast and brunch restaurants.  We have eaten there dozens of times and have never experienced anything but top quality food and great service! The menu is extensive with lots of gluten-free choices and it comes out fast and hot. Kudos to the owners and management for keeping this eatery current, high-quality and a great place to bring friends and family"}
{"text":"Chicken Nachos and Steak Salad is good but the service is TERRIBLE! Not friendly at all...one of the waitresses was SO RUDE I was shocked at how they can have an amazing location with terrible service."}
{"text":"So my friend and I came here Mother's Day.  We first tried U.S. Egg.  We arrived there just after 2:20 but the hostess was rude and told us they were not seating anyone and reminded us they close at 2:30.  I reminded her it was 2:25.  We opted for the Daily Dose and I'm glad we did.  My friend got the Smore Pancakes, which she said were her favorite.  I got the Banana Bread French Toast.  It was so good, plus the service was awesome.  They're staff all seemed so happy we were there unlike U.S. Egg.  If you're considering U.S. Egg, then don't.  Go to Daily Dose."}
{"text":"Tried this after the reviews on Yelp.  Had a bit of a Wait on a Saturday morning, but we expect that.  They told us 10-15 minutes, but it actually was more like 25 minutes.  While we were waiting we saw someone slip the hostess $20 to skip the line - not cool !  Once seated (inside as we took first available) our waitress came over very quickly and took our drink order and then our full order - we got our food very quickly considering how busy it was.  The waitress was very friendly and gave us suggestions on the menu since this was our first time there.  I had the Caprese omelet, which was excellent - my partner had the berry pancakes and said they were good too.  It was a little noisy inside, but the food was excellent and we will be back."}
{"text":"LOVED LOVED LOVED this place.  First, the service was impeccable. Our server was great and others would come by and refill our drinks and check up on us constantly.  The breakfast portions are huge!! The standouts were the breakfast nachos (such a great idea!!) and the pancakes (so fluffy inside but with a light buttery crust on the outside). The hangover sandwich was tasty but overwhelming, it's all protein, which was yummy but left you feeling gross.   The fresh squeezed OJ was great and a huge portion.  They seemed to have great HH specials, but we never made it back."}
{"text":"I had the Southwest wrap and it was amazing! It was served with hashbrowns and fruit and both were excellent. The fruit was ripened to perfection! Next time I i'm going to try the mixed berry protein  pancakes. The menu is not ordinary - effort is put into creating a pleasurable experience in your mouth. Our waitress was very friendly and I love the atmosphere - modern but warm."}
{"text":"Rude service and uninformed manager.. I went in on Saturday and as always, this tiny place was packed.. Line out the door. Not feeling the best, my fiancée and my best friend and I went to the bar to order bloody Mary's while we waited. Apon giving the bar tender (long blonde hair, in 30's) my ID, she studied it skeptically and not thinking it was me(I have brown hair in my pic and I'm now blonde) and after a few awkward moments she asked if I had another ID. I told her no, that when I travel, I only bring one ID so I don't loose any of others I have. I'm 29 years old.. My best friend is 32, and my fiancée is over 40! We don't look young! She didn't ask me to verify any personal info on the ID as they're required to do, but instead stated the obvious that there's no expiration date. News flash: there's no expiration date on AZ state ID's bc they never expire! We tried to inform her of this, and come to find out, she was also a manager that didn't know this information! Her customer service skills were horrible and she didn't even apologize but instead made the drinks and had this attitude like she was doing me this huge favor. No thank you even when I still tipped her 20%. I understand she was trying to do her job but she could have done without all of the snobbiness.  I'm never coming back here again. The food was mediocre and my bagel was stale. The wait just isn't worth it. I recommend Morning Squeeze right up the street on Scottsdale rd.  They're always friendly and the food is ten times better with a lot more healthier options."}
{"text":"We went to Daily Dose on a Saturday June 23 about 10am  when we got there the line seemed endless but the hostess told us it would be a 15 minute wait and she was right on. We sat at the bar which was great service. Food is amazing I had the chorizo eggs Benedict while my husband had the meat omelet with smoked Gouda both were amazingly tasty!,  have a mimosa make it a double and it's a perfect breakfast.   Hostess also took the time to come talk and see how we were doing. Really enjoyed it. We will definitely be back to try lunch or dinner next time."}
{"text":"Based on the previous ratings and recommendations...we gave it a try. We ordered the biscuits and Gravy, seasonal pumpkin pancakes and the jalapeño ham steak. Good on all. Service - Jeanette T. Was very nice and accommodating. However, took way too long in the kitchen!! Be prepared to wait ! We would come back again."}
{"text":"Exceptional service, good atmosphere right in the middle of historic Old town scottsdale with a little patio area/misters. Chicken and waffles were great! Other dishes left of with more to be desired (hollandaise was mediocre).  Good portion size and decent price point.  Good spiked coffee drinks &mimosas (no bottomless)."}
{"text":"Just new to town and looking for a place to get a non-traditional breakfast that supports local.  Daily Dose serves a wonderful coffee that is roasted locally at Passport coffee.  A really nice breakfast and I was pleased."}
{"text":"Amazing food great customer service loved it ... so if you visit Scottsdale you gotta swing by Daily Dose"}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast place! So many great items to choose from! Had the hangover sandwich which was delicious! Our waiter was pleasantly memorable and helpful! Can't wait to go back to sample more! Highly recommend this quaint place! Pet friendly too! Loved it!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed tonight.  Daily dose has been our \" go to\" place for a while now.  But tonight there is a sign on the Old Town door showing new hours.  No more dinner service.  I don't understand. It was always busy for dinner. They've effectively lost two customers ( my wife and I)  we just don't go out for breakfast or lunch that much.    Too bad. We both loose"}
{"text":"I should probably eat here a few more times before giving it a full 5 stars, but 4 stars wouldn't express my enthusiasm enough.  Their sangria is awesome. Their servers have all been amazing. The biscuits and gravy are spectacular, and the hangover sandwich is filling but also amazing. I haven't tried the lunch menu, so I'll be back.  The hostess wasn't the most helpful with trying to get a group of 5 on the patio, but it was probably due to my own uncertainty of where we wanted to sit. Give this place a try for hanging out on the patio or for a good breakfast spot in Old Town."}
{"text":"I've eaten here since they opened and their menu, service and food quality has been good. I eat here at least once every two weeks and they have some of the best best burgers in Phoenix. Also worth checking out are: The milkshakes, the green iced tea, and the Hangover Sandwich."}
{"text":"I waited an hour for biscuits and gravy that tasted like hamburger helper. The waitress discriminated against me because of the way that I am. I'm pissed."}
{"text":"Love the location and decor of this place.  Ventured in based on Google reviews looking for a big breakfast and bloody Marys.  They have a full bar and a very big breakfast menu.  I ordered the blue crab cake omelet which was FABU.  Service was excellent...even though the server managed to pour some ice cold water on my foot!  Just the refresher I needed."}
{"text":"If the rest of the menu is anywhere near as good as the $2 tacos for happy hour this place is amazing!"}
{"text":"Location is key to this place.  Sitting on the street side patio offers great people watching opportunities.  An extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast. The food was good, bacon had some spice! Potatoes were slightly undercooked, but the flavored coating masked it.   The granola was a honey crunch granola which was enjoyable."}
{"text":"We went yesterday am and had to leave because of the horrible service. I had picked up 2 friends from the airport and they were hungry. So I took them to Daily Dose in Old Town. Had been there once before and everything was fine, the food and service was excellent. So, when we arrived we sat outside as my guests wanted to enjoy the weather. We sat for 10 minutes before receiving any attention. My guests were very thirsty, as they had been on a plane for 4 hours. When the waitress finally came, we asked for water, and I ordered a coffee, they ordered drinks. Well, I got the coffee, but nothing else happened for another 5 minutes. When we reminded the waitress she got very snippy and  said that she would find someone else to serve us as she was only one person (she only had our table and another table of 2 to attend to on the patio). Needless to say, she never returned and neither did any other wait staff. After another ten minutes, we decided to leave. I talked with Kiley, the manager, and she apologized. Food is great, service is not. Good luck if you go there - if you want water, bring your own."}
{"text":"I originally had rated Daily Dose with 5 stars but after multiple visits I am discouraged by most of the service.  I was constantly being pushed to order more by the manager/owner and was given a plate of bread that I did not want and charged for it.  If it weren't for the amazing bartenders I don't think I would go back.  Earlier review: Thanks to Absolute Pet Care's Recommendation I had an amazing time at the Daily Dose.  The bartender was fun and friendly, the food is creative and reasonably priced.  I will definitely be back especially since happy hour is from 4-8pm, and they offer free wifi."}
{"text":"This place has GREAT service, awesome food, great happy hour, and nice location.  Go here instead of Starbucks since they offer free Wifi.  I have never had anything here I did not like from the Oatmeal, to the Hummus, signature cocktails, and Sliders!"}
{"text":"So excited to be back and enjoy the new menu and beer selection. It was perfect on this rainy night!"}
{"text":"Great service Awesome staff but only giving it 4 stars cause happy hour ends a hour before closing"}
{"text":"Joined a friend here for a late breakfast, and it was really great!  The place was packed, always a good sign, and I found out why.  We sampled the edamame hummus-AMAZING!  Who knew hummus would work with edamame?  Well, it does here, its got a kick with cilantro and jalepenos.  I had the turkey sausage eggs benedict, really yummy!  First time I've seen turkey sausage on the menu for a benedict option.  The potato wedges were the best I've had in a while.    My friend enjoyed the veggie omlette with a side of cottage cheese, and it was just perfect for her.  I would love to go again and again, it is 30 miles from my home, but next time I'm in Old Town Scottsdale, I will go again for breakfast, lunch or dinner. Big menu with interesting choices."}
{"text":"The hangover sandwich here actually works! I swear whenever I am having a rough Sat. morning I crave that sandwich and if I get it, ahhh I think I am cured. :)"}
{"text":"While in a great location, this restaurant tastes more like a glorified IHOP once the food is delivered.  Waffles tasted powdery, pancakes were dry, and the coffee extra burnt. The people working were very nice and the wait wasn't long. If you want a great breakfast head to Arcadia farms instead."}
{"text":"I loved their turkey bene, it was so good I literally kept saying \"mmmmm\" while eating it! and the bacon bloody Mary,extra spicy, was too good for words! My date had the hangover sandwich, and was impressed!"}
{"text":"Best blue crab sandwich! Great atmosphere and reasonable price point. Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"This place is great.  It's becoming a habit.  JenLyn and Matt have their stuff together.  We love Fusion (their other restaurant) so we figured to try it.  Like everything they do, the food is always excellent, staff is personal and quick and the drinks aren't bad either.  My husband like the hangover.  I usually get the french toast or waffles.  We have been there for lunch as well.  You can't get anything bad here.  Trust me.  It's a gotta go to place."}
{"text":"We went to Daily Dose on a Saturday morning at 11:00 am. It was about a 30 minute wait, but they did have free coffee outside and the weather was nice - no complaints there.    We were seated in a large booth and a waitress came immediately to take our drink orders. They serve their water with cucumbers in it, which is unfortunate if you don't like cucumbers.   I order the Shaved Turkey Melt (Thin shaved house roasted turkey topped with caramelized jalapenos & red onion, creamy brie & chipotle mayonnaise on sourdough. 9.99), which sounded very flavorful but was pretty lackluster. I didn't notice caramelized jalapenos, onions or brie - only turkey. The bread was pretty hard so it was difficult to eat.   I would not return."}
{"text":"This places gets a 5 star solely based on the gluten free cinnamon roll cake that I consumed. It was so tasty that even my friend who can eat gluten fell in love. We both thought we died and went to heaven because of this one dish. I also enjoyed my green chili pork omelette minus the cheese but the gluten free cinnamon, which I got as a side was certainly the star dish. The service here was attentive and friendly. I would fly back down to Scottsdale just for the gluten free cinnamon roll cake; no lies. I didn't even mention their adult coffee and morning beverages! The adult beverages really sealed the deal for me. If you live anywhere in the state of Arizona, you should really make a conscious effort to try Daily dose. I can't stop thinking about my orgasmic experience (figuratively speaking) when biting into the gluten free cinnamon roll cake."}
{"text":"Had a great 7 am Sat breakfast here today. No wait, great service. Crab cake omelette was hot & delish.  Crab cakes came atop, not mixed in. Perfect. Comes with toast, home fries (just a tad not hot enough, but that is small potatoes) & choice of fruit, cottage cheese or hash. Thgt the coffee was especially good. (I have low expectations for good coffee at breakfast places). And the homemade fruit jam was a real hit. They should bottle it. Very inviting inside & outside seating."}
{"text":"We eat here regularly, but after a delicious brunch with outstanding service on Sunday, I had to write a review.  I ordered a turkey sausage omelet with a side of the buttermilk blueberry banana pancakes.  BEST pancakes ever!  Our server was Tyler (I believe) and he was so friendly and genuine."}
{"text":"Great place to go and eat breakfast, the quality of the food was amazing. And I'm picky so when I like a place it means something. However we sat at the bar and the server was terrible. I do cook at home a lot with high quality and organic material but when I go out to eat I don't want just the food to be good I want the service to be good too. Will I go back again? NO I WILL NOT GO BACK TO THIS PLACE! Because the server at the bar was terrible and bad service."}
{"text":"My husband and I went with some friends for dinner and we had a great time. We sat outside, so I didn't get a good feel for what the inside was like, but my overall impression was clean and comfortable.  This place has great pricing for EVERYTHING during their happy hour. We got entirely too much food and drink, but we definitely left happy!  The food was really unique and had fun twists on old favorites. It's nice when restaurants put thought into their menus!"}
{"text":"I finally got a chance to go back here after almost a couple of years. I just am never at this part of the valley much and the times I have been here, it is never in the morning. Well the first time, was fantastic, I loved the creativity,quality, service, and execution of their food. I wanted to give the place a five star, my second one only in this area so far by the way, but I never give a place 5 stars without at least going there twice. The place is a little expensive and I am pretty cheap but it was well worth it. I believed I had the french toast last time, but even though I don't remember the details, I remember it was some of the most original and quality food I have ever had.   This time I decided to go with  the hangover sandwich which was the first time I had something with Jalapenos here in Arizona that didn't just burn all my taste buds. I could feel it but also able to taste the sweetness of the onions and tangy cheese and saltiness of the bacon. Every where in the valley, they pride themselves of just bringing the heat on like a camp fire, but what really do you get from that except a one dimensional response. People think it is great just because it is ultra spicy beyond belief, but that is the lazy way of cooking which is to toss in some really hot peppers to essentially cover up bad food. The sandwich was great, just wish they had an option for a regular pork instead of turkey sausage which is kind of bland, but maybe they will but I just never asked.  Anyways I also had their DD hash, which is a vegetarian dish, and believe me when I say that is the farthest thing about my eating habits. I gulped it up because it was just so well balanced. The dish came with their potatoes which was okay, but I usually don't like larger chunks of potatoes but most people do so I don't hold that against the restaurant, just not my cup of tea. Their coffee is awesome and you know that they even not only gave me a cup to go, but also made it an ice coffee. For the money it was well worth it. I hope to get a chance to try more of their menu and hopefully sooner than 2 years next time .   A plus and usually I don't really care about this as much as others, but their service is top notch. Helpful but not  bothering you every 2 minutes to get you moving, they don't even bring you the check  until you ask for it, plus it helps to come early in the morning, I hate waiting but I am not an idiot who goes right in rush hour and bitch about it either. I really enjoy it and would recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"Other than the generous portions DD serves up, I don't see what all the fuss is about.  We stopped in for breakfast mid-morning and we were seated promptly.  The tables at the booths for four (and we were only two) were too narrow and I felt like I was in my husband's face as we ate across from each other.    My husband ordered the roast turkey omelet which came brimming with real turkey, tomatoes, onions and brie.  He said it was quite filling, but didn't make a fuss about the actual flavor. I ordered the meat and cheese omelet minus the chorizo and asked that my omelet be cooked on the soft side. It didn't come out that way, and much to my disappointment, the bacon they use is pepper bacon -- but they don't tell you that on the menu. I had to send it back. To their credit, they were gracious enough to take it off our bill.  What we most enjoyed was the DD Hash, a very tasty blend of butternut squash and onions, perfectly cooked. Absolutely delish! It's a little overkill with the breakfast potatoes that also come with the omelet. Start working on the DD Hash before you dig in to the others because they are so filling and yummy!  Our server was a little aloof, and one of her coworkers stepped up to the plate to better our experience. Had it not been for her assistance, I would surely have rated DD a two."}
{"text":"Eggs Benedict was good but the Hangover sandwich was the clincher. Fantastic!"}
{"text":"Good food! Drinks were strong and service was slow. But overall a pretty good experience!"}
{"text":"The wait was not bad, they have coffee and water while you wait which is awesome. Our server Holly was amazing. She gave us great recommendations to substitute and upgrade our meal.  Our first time so it was very helpful. The michelada could have used a little more spice but it was still good .  Portions  are a good size.  The cinnamon pancake was really good."}
{"text":"Daily Dose has great food and fantastic service!  Adam went above and beyond to help me get an office order on time for a vendor meeting, and was even able to accommodate dietary restrictions.  Thank you so much for the great meal!"}
{"text":"Brunch: banana bread french toast and southwest flannel hash.   I shared with my friend, we both practically inhaled everything. So good!! It was perfect sharing with someone, the sweet & savory combo was perfect.   There was no wait, restaurant is clean and has a nice layout. The Irish coffee and Bloody Mary were so-so, but the food definitely made up for it.   Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I love this place and my, oh my, your sweet potato fries are to die for!"}
{"text":"I have been to this location several times. I tend to find a favorite and get it each time. Here, my favorite is the turkey burger on a pretzel bun. Although it is far more food than a single person can have on their own, it does serve great as leftovers.  Everything I have tried in search of my favorite has been excellent. The food alone, deserves 5 stars, but I hesitate to go that far because the service tends to be poor. It's little things like waiting far too long to have your order taken, letting the water get empty, socializing with the bartender instead of serving your customers, poor attitude etc.. These things add up, and as a result my husband won't go there anymore."}
{"text":"Really good omelet.  I mean, really good!   But I wanted to stick a fork in our servers hand 'cause she was giving us the \"rush\" treatment.   Trying to grab our juice and our plate while we were still eating.  Chill!  The place was half empty."}
{"text":"I loved everything about this place!!  The protein pancakes were fabulous and I was able to get them with gluten free batter. Staff was very personable.  All around great experience."}
{"text":"One of my all time favorite places to eat in Old Town Scottsdale! Their breakfast is amazing, huge selection but I always get a side of bacon because it's cooked perfectly! The vegetable pot pie - YUM! Also they do a great happy hour that goes pretty late as well. Definitely a must try in Old Town! Lines can be long in the mornings (especially on the weekends) so be sure to get their early so you don't have to wait!"}
{"text":"Had excellent breakfast and awesome service.  Enjoyed the atmosphere and had pleasant experience.  This place is bookmarked for future trips."}
{"text":"Found this place online.  We were looking for a good place to take the family for breakfast.  All around great food.  The house bacon Bloody Mary was amazing.  Adding this place for a return visit.  Fantastic service.  Kylie was awesome."}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast place!  Trendy and creative food and excellent service. Think sinker doodle pancakes and breakfast nachos!"}
{"text":"My family and I came here in December 2017 to celebrate my sister's graduation and the food was amazing!! Despite the long wait, the customer service was excellent! And the yummy food was definitely worth the wait. I will be sure to come back next time I'm in Arizona! Great atmosphere, great food, and amazing drinks!"}
{"text":"This place is hands down my favorite breakfast place in AZ! I'm a savory person and my husband is all about sweets so this restaurant allows us to both get what we want with their assorted menu.   My go to order is the Cobb sandwich with a bacon infused bloody Mary and a side of the chorizo mac. My husband always gets a chilled mocha with a pump of caramel and coconut substituted with almond milk (tastes just like a Samoa girl scout cookie) then he picks one of the sweet pancake items. The bacon infused bloody Mary is the best I've ever had. I've debated ordering a virgin one on mornings I'm not feeling a brunch cocktail.  On the slim chance that you have to wait to get in for longer than 15 minutes, they have complimentary coffee and cucumber water out front. When it is busy, the 2 of us normally don't wait longer than 15 minutes for first available seating. The longest wait I've dealt with was 30 minutes black Friday morning with a party of 6.   They also have a bunch of TVs all over the restaurant so we never have to miss a game. The patio one can even be watched while you wait for a table.   My one complaint is that the food service is not fast, but to keep my mind off that I just ask for the chorizo mac side as an appetizer so that we can snack on it while we wait for the main course and I hardly notice the wait."}
{"text":"Will definitely be coming back here before I leave Scottsdale. Mixed Berry Protein Pancakes were awesome, real berries were packed inside."}
{"text":"Daily Dose? Yes please!  1. The menu has something wonderful for every palate and food preference.  2. The staff is always friendly and responsive.  3. Their drink specials are phenomenal.  My favorite is brunch time - you can't go wrong with any omelet or my favorite - the Protein and Iron.  The DD Hash is legit.  Daily Dose is our proverbial go-to whenever we are in the area."}
{"text":"My first visit here I had the hangover sandwich... WOW! I was hooked immediately. The Daily Dose Burger is always prepared to my liking, the Prime Steak Salad is a huge salad and is a delight to my tastebuds! I would stay away from the gravy, it's not what you'd expect from breakfast gravy. The staff is quick, friendly, and on top of their game. I will visit here again and again!"}
{"text":"So many great options! Excellent omelettes, different kinds of batters for pancakes, and great coffee. The DD hash is amazing as well."}
{"text":"What can I say? When my girlfriend and I decide we want to go out to eat the very first place that comes to mind is 'the dose'. It's almost annoying because we can't seem to think of anywhere else.  Then we remember the reason we can  think of no better place, consistency. Literally every time we go to dose we leave happy. I also happen to crave their veggie burger on a weekly basis while my girlfriend opts for the kobe. To each his own, and to each, they do a great job."}
{"text":"The Banana Bread French Toast was by far the best thing that came to the table and it warranted 4 stars.  The Power Protein Pancakes sucked, super dry and bland despite being packed with berries - 2 stars The Stuffed Portobello w/ Gouda and Roasted Red Peppers could have been good but it was completely drenched in oil, blech - 2 stars   Overall disappointed with Daily Dose. Will have to keep searching for a great breakfast spot in the Scottsdale/Phoenix area..."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar around noon on a Sunday. Seems as if breakfast is there hot items on a Sunday but I went for a burger instead after an early Sunday flight. It was OK. I have been here before and had dinner and it was good.  Next time I go, I'll try the breakfast."}
{"text":"I love the concept- there is a little bit for every taste on the menu.  You can have breakfast or lunch whenever you want!  It is about time someone knows how to make a good biscuts and gravy!!!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite spot for breakfast/brunch in Old Town. Amazing service. Delicious food and great prices. I would highly recommend a side of banana bread French toast."}
{"text":"Oh...my.....nacho-ness! I went here, tried their breakfast nachos, and they are just heavenly! I don't even remember how much they cost, all I remember about that day is nachoey goodness. :)"}
{"text":"No longer dog friendly! Don't find out the hard way from the rude staff..."}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast place in Old Town. Whether you want a heavy comfort hangover breakfast or a light healthy meal, they've got you covered.  The only reason I wouldn't go as regularly as I wanted to was because of the usual long waits during the weekend.  But the food is fantastic. Great portions at good prices and friendly service. I like the eggs Benedict, the French toast and I've heard good things about the chorizo mac n cheese."}
{"text":"Kobe hamburger with pretzel bread. That's all you need to know!   Yeah, I'm a fan! I visited Daily Dose on Whiskey Wednesday. That means $5 whiskeys. After one of those, I just had to eat something! Well, hello Kobe burger! I chose the Daily Dose burger which 8oz is topped with cheddar & jack, peppered bacon, fresh basil, shaved onion, tomato & harissa aioli on a toasted pretzel bun! Whew! The burger was tasty and the pretzel bun was a master stroke. The meat was juicy and cooked to order (medium for me). The toppings added to the flavor of the burger and the pretzel bun was chewy and salted just like a YUMMY pretzel. I was a happy girl!   I hope to visit Daily Dose for breakfast, maybe a lunch! I hope they can wow me like they did before!"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times and their food is wonderful! Their HH goes on til 8PM and their breakfast items are amazing! We got the hangover sandwhich and it was Great! The waitress even split the meal for us on two separate plates and gave us another cup of fruit. My friend told me to try the pancakes, since they are to die for. Will try that next time!"}
{"text":"What a great place to eat breakfast! Nice little outdoor patio and healthy, yummy food!"}
{"text":"Have eaten breakfast and dinner at Daily Dose, both are quite good and the patio is a nice place to have a beer after work.  Chill atmosphere and none of the \"scene\" found at many other Scottsdale restaurants.  I go here often and the service is normally attentive and quick though breakfast may be a little slow if you are in a hurry.  The green chile enchiladas are one of my favorites, would rate them a 5 except the rice they plate up with them is horrible, only bad thing I can say I have had here.  Good chorizo as well as lots of healthier options for breakfast."}
{"text":"This is THE spot for brunch. My mom and I stopped here on a Saturday around 10. There was a wait, but we put ourselves on the list and stood outside on the sidewalk and chatted. The iced tea and coffee table was a nice courtesy for those waiting for a table.  Once we got in, we sat at the bar, which was fun because we got to watch all the action. The decor was beautiful, and it felt so posh to sip my mimosa at the bar.   The food was also great! Mom and I each ordered a variation on eggs benedict (red pepper and black forest ham) and shared. Both were delicious, flavorful, and not too heavy. I finished my plate without feeling weighed down.   All in all, this was such a lovely brunch experience. Thank you, Daily Dose!"}
{"text":"Have been here twice now, and both times my tastebuds were tickled with delight. They serve breakfast until 4pm, which is a gift from above, as I love me some breky in the afternoon.  I ordered the roasted turkey omelette, sans turkey and instead with asparagus added, with onions and peppers and oooey, gooey, delicious brie cheese! Also comes with a side of rosemary potatoes, a choice of side AND toast.  Not too shabby for 10 bucks.  The server was sweet and accommodating and the coffee mug was huge...just what the doctor ordered.  Thanks kids, I'll be heading back for my Daily Dose very soon!"}
{"text":"Scottsdale's Best Breakfast Restuarant! I'm in here 2-3 times a week. Service is great! Food is out and ready within 5-10 minutes after ordering. Also, they have one of the healthiest breaskfast menues in Scottsdale. I highly recommend the \"Protein & Iron\" for breakfast. Added plus, it's right next to Starbucks for your morning coffee."}
{"text":"The place is great for breakfast and lunch, never had anything here that was even close to being bad. The breakfast nachos, hangover sandwich and DD has are awesome. Ever server we have had has been super nice and never gets irritated when I ask for soy milk for my coffee, like so many other places.  Portions are huge and very well priced."}
{"text":"Definitely a breakfast place you want to spend your morning and/or afternoon at. I got the egg whites with house made turkey sausage that was phenomenal and had 2 sides; I subbed my toast for the berry protein pancakes for only $1 more (which was also phenomenal). My boyfriend got the 6oz steak and eggs which were cooked perfectly and also came with 2 sides. Our whole bill was only $26! The whole place looks cozy yet trendy and the bathrooms were kept very well. The servers check on you constantly and are super nice. The menu is huge; we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast joint.  The creme brulee waffles are to die for.  The breakfast nachos, while not originally one of my first choices based on the name, was AMAZING.  A bit pricy for breakfast, but the food quality is fantastic.  The one negative that we've encountered is the service.  Sometimes it's fabulous, other times horrendous.  We've found that if you sit on the patio on a busy morning the service is generally hit or miss.  We always seem to get the table of the waitress who doesn't seem to realize that our table is occupied.  On the flip side, we have had some great service.  A tasty treat in the morning & I recommend checking it out."}
{"text":"Oh Daily Dose, you are a reason to get out of bed on a weekend morning. A fave breakfast spot of mine, the Daily Dose (DD) has it all. If you're looking for a traditional breakfast of eggs, pancakes, and goodness, this is your place. This is not what I opt for though... the Daily Dose is known for their phenomenal Peanut Butter and Jelly Belgian Waffle and the Bananas Foster Creme Brulee French Toast. There is nothing I don't like about PB & J on my waffles in the morning. To start off breakfast, the Daily Dose has one of the best cups of coffee in Scottsdale. I have grown to like the mocha's but the special blend of coffee they have ALWAYS seems to get remarks of greatness. When you go, you have to sit on the patio for breakfast. If you have a dog, bring fido along for some good people watching outside. Situated on Scottsdale Road and 1st Street in downtown, there is always something to see. One thing yet to try on the menu is the Hangover Sandwich... take a look at it when you are there. It is all things that are good, piled on a breakfast sandwich. Not sure I could finish it, but if you do, let me know!"}
{"text":"Food was great.. Service was pretty horrible. The servers were all eating lunch when we arrived and seemed annoyed that we walked in ( I blame the manager for not insisting they eat out of the view of the customers). When ordering I was trying to decide and ask questions bc it was my first time there and the server was looking around not paying attention to me while I was ordering. Then the food came out (guy ran it from kitchen) our server walked past us multiple times. My husband finally went to the bar and asked for water refills, more napkins, and hot sauce. With all the breakfast places in old town, slim chance we will ever go back here simply bc of lackluster service!"}
{"text":"Favorite breakfast place in Old Town. Every dish I have gotten is great. Large portions so come hungry. Get the protein pancakes!!!"}
{"text":"Daily dose has never disappointed me!  I am a regular, the service is friendly, and the food is fantastic!!  They have a later Happy Hour than most places on food/drinks that are already fairly priced :).  Their breakfast menu is my favorite in the valley with lots of healthy options and their strawberry mint salad is out of this world.  It get super busy in the mornings, especially on weekends, so show up early or at odd times:).  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"WOW!   My parents and I and other family friends come her almost every Friday!  They have a great happy hour menu! (Although they just changed it a little) But happy hour is available everyday ( I think) from 4-8!  They have a wonderful frozen sangria mixed with a frozen margarita! ( its a MUST TRY!)   Also,  the pretzel buns for the burgers are delicious!! Not to mention that the staff is amazing, and the owner Jen is a DELIGHT!  She is constantly walking around the restaurant talking to guests!  Probably one of my favorite restaurants around!!"}
{"text":"Ridiculous. In a good way. Food was great as was the service. Your water isn't just water, the standard is with slices of cucumber, so wonderful! The omelets are so great and come with herb potatoes and rosemary creme fraiche. Also had the pumpkin spice pancakes on the side, so great. We were visiting for a wedding and one of the many friendly locals suggested it. A walk from our hotel in Old Town, it was a wonderful brunch and would for sure return if ever in the area again."}
{"text":"Had a deeelish southwest chicken salad tonight.  Service was great.  Surprised by how yummy the salad was and am intrigued to try the pretzel bun burger.  Cute litle place, wish the appetizer section had more healthy options but still overall super yummy.  My friend ordered the caprese grilled sandwich which looked tasty as well! Great place for catching up with the girls and the sangria is superb as well!"}
{"text":"Crabcake eggs benedict in Arizona?  Yes!  Unbelievers will be shunned, shunnnnnnnnned.  I watched the World Cup game with the aforementioned benny and a stellar cup of decaf joe.  The servers were friendly and the food was delish [at 7 am? yea!].  It was too early for me, but the bar had intriguing signs detailing carefully assembled cocktails.  Add it to the list, folks."}
{"text":"I felt that this establishment does not live up to the hype.   It wasn't even busy on the Saturday I went, but the waiter seemed to forget about our table in the back. It took around twenty minutes to even order a couple bloody Mary's, and we had to keep flagging the waiter to finally get our food order. The BM's were tasty, but the chicken and waffles had much to be desired. The chicken itself was prepared well, but the waffle was lacking in culinary inspiration. They were dry and bland, reminiscent of a DIY waffle maker station at a hotel breakfast. I'm not sure why they serve it with an egg and roasted corn, it makes for a bizarre flavor profile. I might go back in the future for drinks but that's about it."}
{"text":"Crab cake eggs benny was to die for! Everything about it was fantastic. My only complaint is that it was so good I ate it quickly! Also had roasted potatoes and DD Hash with it. Potatoes were tasty but I wasn't so keen on the other side. DD Hash is butternut squash, which is a really great idea for the paleo/carb conscious crowd however in my unsolicited opinion the seasoning just didn't really do much to enhance the flavor of the veg. I'd just get double potatoes next time. First time at Daily Dose, if I were staying longer I would easily do breakfast each morning here! My meal was fantastic and the service was good. Definitely hit this for brunch!"}
{"text":"Our visit took place on a Monday afternoon. At first we were concerned bc our waitress came off a bit aloof and disinterested. I requested a sample of the tempeh bc my prior experiences with it were not good.  At that point, the manager showed up with the sample and she was super nice.  Afterwards, our waitress warmed up when she saw I was interested in ordering the cinnamon roll pancake lol. She actually wound up being extremely helpful. She made sure we didn't order too much food and saved us some money!  She confirmed my interest in the cinnamon roll pancake which was probably one of the best things I have EVER eaten! On the healthier end,  I was feeling rundown so the protein bowl was a great fit for this vegetarian: egg whites, tempeh, avocado,  basmati rice, queso fresco & kale. The orange juice was freshly squeezed with the perfect amount of sweetness. Overall a good experience. You lost a star and a half for cleaning (sweeping, shaking out things and spraying the window) while we were eating. Yuck, I really dislike that!"}
{"text":"Awesome spot!  Had the chorizo burrito...out of this world!  Great service. Will definitely be back whenever we are in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"for me, the difference between a 4-star place and a 5-star place is some extra something, some WOW factor.  at daily dose for us that bump came in the form of the service.  our server brooke was super attentive, and friendly, despite the fact that the place was packed - she made us feel like her only table.  she never seemed harried or rushed, despite taking care of so many, and made time for just the right amount of small talk in the midst of her professional and efficient service.  high five to brooke.  food was very good and reasonably priced.  I had the caprese grilled cheese, which was a unique take on two of my faves - grilled cheese and caprese salad.  and judging by my empty plate, it worked.  i chose a salad as my side and was grateful and duly impressed by the thought and creativity that they put into it - rather than most places that just throw some sad, lonely lettuce on a plate and call it a side salad.  one of my companions managed to finish \"the gladiator\" and mumbled \"very good\" right before he passed out.  other companion just had beer, but was impressed with the selection.  all in all, daily dose has it figured out.  they are a bright spot in the otherwise soul-less \"old town\" of scottsdale.  it is definitely worth the wait you will inevitably have - because the word is out!"}
{"text":"Went there for breakfast this Sunday and the experience was great. Arrived close to 10 am, there was no wait AND we got a table out on the patio. It was perfect weather for brunch outside. I'd say the only thing that put a damper on this experience (which has nothing to do with the establishment, its food or its service!) was the out-of-the-norm-LOUD people sitting around us. Oh well, it will happen anywhere right?  The patio had a big TV right next to our table so my man was able to catch some football and ignore the loud mouths around us which was nice. The menu is amazing. How many places serve breakfast until 4pm AND have two pages worth of breakfast options?? My heaven. Our server was great. Had an awesome and energetic personality but wasn't annoying or overly helpful. She came when she needed to and let us enjoy our meal the rest of the time. I appreciate that. I wasn't the biggest fan of the cucumber water they bring out. I LOVE that they are taking the initiative to offer great services by placing either cucumber, lemon, etc... into your water BUT for some reason, the cucumber wasn't doing it for me that morning and I had to ask for a plain water. No biggie.   We ordered the mixed berry protein pancakes and the stuffed portabello mushroom with redbell pepper, egg and cheese. A side of fruit, rye toast and cottage cheese. Lets just say, I almost didn't need to eat for the rest of the day. SO MUCH FOOD.  The meal after tip was around $27 and that is without mimosas or bloody mary's. We don't live super close to here so this will be a trip for when I'm craving those amazing pancakes! If you live near this place, its Regular Status worthy for sure."}
{"text":"Met up with my friends here after their shift just by chance. Perfect for after work if you're just looking to grab a drink, but their menu is stacked with great choices too. Check them out if you're in the Scottsdale area and looking for a quality breakfast spot."}
{"text":"Mmmm, I love me some Daily Dose.   I've never received poor service here, always smiling, friendly girls. Plus I feel like there's always someone around to refill waters or remove a dirty plate.   When I dine at DD I'm typically in the mood for breakfast, so most of my recommendations come from that portion of the menu. Don't miss out on their bacon Bloody Mary, chorizo eggs Benedict, or peanut butter and jelly waffles.   Their burgers are really good too, and today I had the Old Town Stack (a prime rib sandwich with an onion slaw, horseradish mayo on a pretzel bun) that was pretty tasty.   A few parting comments: I hear they have happy hour from 4-9 Monday through Friday. That's insane (in a good way!) And, YES this place packs the house on the weekends, so be prepared to wait. But it's worth it."}
{"text":"I cannot begin to tell you how much I LOOOOVE this place. I literally go here every weekend for brunch/lunch. On Sundays the wait time for brunch can really get up there so I recommend going on an off day or later into the afternoon. This is a great spot to sip on a mimosa, enjoy brunch with friends, and see where your Saturday/Sunday will go!  Must haves: - Tacos (CHORIZO IS AMAZING, mahi mahi is good too) - Daily Dose burger (I DREAM ABOUT THIS THING... bacon, cheese, basil, chipotle aioli... combination of amazingness but beware you won't have any room to eat anything else for the rest of the day) - Shaved Turkey Melt (carmelized jalepenos and brie... need I say more???) - a healthy alternative = turkey sausage white-out. Amazing breakfast if you're looking for something on the healthy side - Breakfast nachos.... one word = HOLY CRAP. Okay, that's two but whatever. Amazing."}
{"text":"Great service. Great latte. Brunch was wonderful on the patio. Crab cake Benedict yummy. Manager made a point to visit the table."}
{"text":"Food is awesome, I have not had a bad meal or appetizer at this place yet.  Great menu, great happy hour every night!  My only critique, the service can be a little slow sometimes.  That being said, I still look forward to eating there this weekend.."}
{"text":"Excellent service! Great food! Great prices! And the portions are huge!! I went around 9:00 am on a Sunday it gets kinda crowded for brunch so get there early."}
{"text":"I was in Arizona for a wedding, so I wanted to utilize my free time finding a good place to eat! Once I arrived at the hotel, I yelped breakfast places. I came across three breakfast places- Daily Dose, US Egg, and some pancake place (not the name of the restaurant)   My boyfriend and I decided to go to Daily Dose after skimming thought the food photos on yelp.  Food: Strawberry Creme Brûlée Belgium Waffle- this was okay, I wish it had more Creme brûlée drizzle on top of the waffle.  DD Hash- omg so good!! So much flavor! This is an acorn squash, mushroom and onion. So ate every bite! I loved this side dish!  Southwest Flannel Hash- slices of corn beef with slices of jalapeño. This was tasty too! I should probably stick with getting savory dishes than sweet.  Everything was great! From the food to the service!"}
{"text":"I feel so late to the party on this local deliciousness. What a great breakfast menu and dog-friendly patio. Narrowing down what to eat was difficult. Southwest flavors, crab cakes?! Yes, and yes. So, our table ordered a couple different omelets and they were perfect. Big portions, husband and I will share one next time."}
{"text":"Just so so food. Average bloody Mary and eggs benidict. Must be a lot of locals that give it good reviews"}
{"text":"The turkey and avocado sandwich was delicious! Has a poblano pepper inside that's stuffed with cheese, on a roll with Oats on top. Probably one of the best sandwiches I've EVER had. And on the side I got the combo fries. Half regular and half sweet potato. They were so good too. The right amount of salt for that salty/sweet combo that's so good. Only bad thing is, it's a 6-7 hour drive from our LA home. No wait. Our waitress was very nice and took great care of us."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful breakfast here this morning.  Luckily we were able to park very nearby and we were seated immediately as it was not at all busy.  My veggie omelet was delicious, filled with a variety of vegetables including asparagus.  My husband enjoyed his chorizo omelet which could be topped with avocado, which looked a lot like guacamole.  We both liked the rosemary creme fraiche that accompanied the potatoes.  I only got one slice of multigrain toast, but I liked that it had plenty of seeds.  I'm glad I asked for jelly because the server brought a generous helping of raspberry spread that was thick and most likely homemade (?).  My husband and I each chose fruit for our second side and we enjoyed the fresh pineapple, watermelon, and honeydew melon.  All in all, it was delicious and I am glad we chose this restaurant at the end of our staycation in Paradise Valley."}
{"text":"This is my friends' favorite place to meet up.  They have happy hour until 8 pm seven days a week and the chorizo mac-n-cheese is the best you can find!  Great brunch dishes too!"}
{"text":"I have to say ditto to all the positive comments that other people have added about this place. The service was very quick, the food was delicious and healthy.  I would certainly recommend this to anybody in the Scottsdale area."}
{"text":"My friends rave about this place so on a recent trip to Scottsdale, I decided to give it a go.  Know that for brunch you are going to wait.  So put your name in and go outside and sit on the curb or in one of the chairs provided as we easily were there for 45 minutes before being called.  Once called we started to go over the large menu.  I wanted an omelette and my friend was hankering for eggs Benedict.  They came and were good but the real winner had to be the pancakes at the table next to us,  They smelled so good I was trying to stay in my seat and not grab them off of their table.  I actually had \"pancake envy\" and if I hadn't just eaten my days worth of calories in one sitting, I might have ordered my own fluffy cake from heaven.  Anyway. Back to what we did order.  My Bloody Mary was okay but not worth the extra money to get the bacon one (where I come from, bacon bloodies have long strips of maple soaked bacon in them not the chopped bacon here that merely stopped up my straw)  And my omelette was good but not exciting.  And even the sweet potato hash brown mix didn't do it for me.  Know there is a full bar so after breakfast we wandered over there to sit, drink and wait for the rain to stop.  That actually was the highlight of our visit as the bartenders were trying to deal with a woman who had been \"over served\" at brunch and was proceeding to embarrass herself at the bar . . .made for some live drama!  If you drive, there is usually street parking on the blocks surrounding the restaurant.   The prices are reasonable, the servers are on their game, and the coffee is good so a solid showing in my opinion.  I just wanted it to live up to my friends recommendation . . . .and it didn't."}
{"text":"Good Food, Good Service.  This place is very small, and the tables are very close to each other so it can get very loud very fast.   The sandwiches come on pretzel buns, highly recommended. The happy hour specials are good, but the happy hour menu can be quite deceiving."}
{"text":"Chorizo omelette and Corned beef hash were on point.  Coffee was fantastic. Sub-par Bloody Mary, however."}
{"text":"I have been a fan of this place since it opened. The Hangover Sandwich is fantastic. They are very consistent in the quality. On weekends you can expect a little wait, but it's well worth it. Every time I have family in town, this is a must.   And they just opened a new location in Phoenix right behind my work!!!   I highly recommend checking this place out."}
{"text":"We used to love this place but after our last experience, we won't return.  We went on a busy Saturday morning and were told it would be 15 minutes for a table.  No problem.  After sitting for a few minutes we noticed that there were seats open at the bar so we decided to go sit there.  The girl who originally took our name came over with an attitude and said that we couldn't sit there unless they sat us there.  Most eatery bars are open seating so we were surprised but the real issue was the attitude that she took with us.  I will not pay a business that is going to treat me rudely and thus we will not be returning to Daily Dose.  We told her to take our name off the list and we had breakfast somewhere else."}
{"text":"I'm from NYC in town on Vacation checked this place out... Because of yelp reviews and was not disappointed great food and great service. A+++"}
{"text":"Breaky is so good! Mimosas are awesome, the oj is freshly squeezed, solid menu. I had the polenta and roasted poblano eggs Benny...... Oh my god, so amazing.  It was so good we came back the next day, hangover breakfast sandwich was good but not comparable to the Benny, apparently new to their menu."}
{"text":"So I stopped at Daily Dose before heading to Sedona and it was the perfect place to get a hearty breakfast before a hike. There were a lot of people there but they seated pretty fast. The patio is spacious and has a really relaxing vibe for being in downtown Scottsdale.   I ordered the prime rib Benedict which was awesome and the breakfast nachos, which is more food than anyone should eat before 10am. The fruit that came on the side didn't taste very fresh and the roasted potatoes had cumin on them which kind of threw me off. The prime rib was tender and the hollandaise sauce was on point. Breakfast nachos had this really good queso dip and the salsa was light and fresh--truly enjoyed this dish a lot.   Our server was super nice and the food came out fast. Parking is easy to find, it's right around the building and has a three hour limit."}
{"text":"Wow, what a FANTASTIC place to eat.  Danielle was our sever and she is EXCELLENT. And the food goes beyond freshness, taste and quality. You will not be disappointed. This is our new forever place ."}
{"text":"Wow.  I had the most fabulous tuna melt on gluten free bread!  It was truly delicious.  The place is trendy and, per usual due to location, over priced.  However, the food was worth it!  Keep up the good work regarding GF bread and truly toasting it!!"}
{"text":"I can see why this place is named Daily Dose because I would probably eat lunch here everyday if I lived in the area.  My friend and I had \"girls afternoon\" and stopped in for lunch.  The place isn't very big and has a great vibe to it.  Dim lighting, oversized booths on one side, and some smaller tables in the bar area.  We opted to sit at the bar.  The bartender was friendly, answered all of our questions, and let us sample the homemade sangria.  For drinks we ordered a double bellini and for $8.50, it was a decent sized drink!    We started with a Caesar salad and it was just ok.  The lettuce didn't seem too fresh.  For lunch we both ordered the same thing.  I wish we would have ordered different things just because there was so much on the menu that I would have loved to try!  We went with the Chicken Cobb Sandwich.  Grilled chicken, bacon, avocado, and creamy blue cheese.  When I first saw it on the menu and saw blue cheese, I was thinking it was going to be blue cheese dressing, but it wasn't!  Instead it was thick and creamy.  The sandwich is huge and it is difficult to eat because it can get messy with the blue cheese oozing out.  It was delicious though!  I went with the sweet potato fries as my side and they did not disappoint!  From the looks of the menu, this place has a killer happy hour!  I would love to try it out when I am back in the Scottsdale area."}
{"text":"Before all else THIS IS THE BEST HAMBURGER I HAVE HAD IN MY LIFE!!! I just wanted to put this message out before the rest of my review or wherever yelp cuts off before you have to click \"read more.\" If you read nothing else in this review, just know that this is the best ground beef to bread combination I have ever had in my existence.   Now I have never had a pretzel bun anywhere else, and I understand these things are growing in commoness even Wendy's has one, but regardless where else they make these things whoever came up with the idea of sandwiching meat with pretzel bread should win a medal or something. Especially at the daily dose the slices they use are basically entire bread loaves. The beef is Australian Kobe and tastes fantastic. No, it's not real kobe beef but its still filling without feeling greasy then add bacon, cheese, and of course that bread and you might as well put up a white flag and surrender to the thing.   Actually never got a drink here, but the chorizo mac and cheese is also recommended if you must try something else. The atmosphere also is great very classy but not snobby. Price is higher than a chain but portions are very large you do not feel short changed.   Oh and in case you missed it, try the burgers."}
{"text":"Hungover? Spent the night in Old Town the night before!? GO HERE! I had the steak and eggs medium rare is what I got! Horshradish sauce, yes please! I use to be all about Good Egg but haha jokes Daily Dose puts it to shame! Whenever I go out with my friends I order my own thing but use my bread dish to get a bite of everyone elses food, wow this place is my go to spot as long as you didn't blow all your money the night before getting drinks."}
{"text":"Writing this review for two reasons:   1. Great customer service 2. Delicious breakfast.... And breakfast is my favorite meal ;)  Juliana the host is great! On Saturday mornings after a morning run, Daily Dose is the spot! Juliana always greets every customer with a smile and she always brings water/biscuit for my dog (that's always a plus in my book!) She's has great customer service and professionalism. I manage a business so I can spot quality people... She's one of them.  The food is always soooo good. I've tried everything from Benedicts, omelets, and breakfast sandwiches, and everything is on point. One of these days, I'll get the courage (and calorie-saving) for the breakfast nachos... Or hangover sandwich!!!"}
{"text":"I was excited for Daily Dose to open because of the lack of breakfast options in oldtown.  I mean, if I want to spend two hours or more having breakfast, I'll go to the Orange Table, if I want flavorless, overpriced options, I'll go to the Breakfast Club, if I want mediocrity and middle America, I'll go to US Egg, if I want still-drunk patrons from Axis-Radius, I'll go to Cafe Carumba, but I digress...  I'd love a good breakfast place, and I was hoping that Daily Dose would deliver.  I loved that they put cucumber slices in the water.  The service was attentive, at first.  I think the place was wildly understaffed, as it later took a turn for the worse.  The food took FOREVER to come, and my dish (some kind of egg sandwich) was waaay over-cooked and sort of disgusting as a result.  The table next to me had an omelet and the eggs looked burned as well.   The side options are confusing (they offer squash as a side in lieu of potatoes, but they call it \"hash\", like um, hash browns) and the coffee is weak.  Good ingredients, decent menu, but the kitchen needs to step it up and they should either consider more servers or staff the place with more competent people.  I'll probably be back because I have a bad habit of frequenting places I dislike."}
{"text":"I love seating at the bar when I go to Daily Dose,the drinks are made perfectly. The bartender is always super attentive and she always makes sure that her customers leave satisfied and with a huge smile on their face . The staff is super friendly and really know what they're doing. Super clean and great atmosphere as well . 100 perfect recommend Daily Dose."}
{"text":"Great breakfast spot in old town. Pancakes and waffles are the best. Painkiller drink is strong and tasty. Small patio but cozy."}
{"text":"Sat down this am. Waited almost 20 minutes. No one ever came to our table. We asked for service 3 times. Still no one. Very poor management. Won't go back."}
{"text":"I had high hopes after reading plenty of positive reviews on yelp. Not to mention being out of town, I wanted to go to place the locals went to and not just some chain restaurant.  We drove an extra 25 minutes to get to Daily Dose from our hotel. I was actually excited to try the breakfast.  My two breakfast weakness are eggs Benedict and Belgium waffles and it is always a challenge for me to choose one or the other.   At Daily Dose, I decided to try their  \"Strawberry Creme Brule\" Belgium waffle which sounded great from the description. It was going to be topped with fresh strawberries, vanilla bean crème brule & whipped cream. You also had to option with a choice of fresh fruit, cottage cheese or DD hash. I opted for the DD hash.  When the dish came out it looked quite nice as you can tell from the photo.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HCCg-rVnHQ2FI6lHs_LvUQ?select=gkkpOGnT5GmRuNBYx15zXA  However, eating it was another thing.  The whipped cream was fine, and the creme brule sauce was very sweet which substituted having to use regular maple syrup.  My issue with this Belgium waffle was the texture. As you cut through the waffle, it was like cutting through a very dense cake and it ended like a rock in my stomach for the next few hours. (no bueno) Most of the Belgium waffles I've had elsewhere are light and crispy.  I thought, \"Oh, maybe it was just my Belgium Waffle that was dense and cake like.\" However, my friend who ordered the blueberry version of the Belgium Waffle had the same complaint. He too never had such a dense cakey waffle before.   http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HCCg-rVnHQ2FI6lHs_LvUQ?select=XtVob_W2GT-ogi_csDEiLg  The DD hash ended up to be a sauteed squash which which was both sweet and savory, I think it is definitely and acquired taste.   The service was decent. Our coffee cups were never half empty.   There are both indoor and outdoor seating in the patio.  Perhaps it was a bad day to order Belgium waffle at DD, but sadly it left me feeling disappointed after being so excited to try this place out."}
{"text":"We found this restaurant while walking around one night in Old Town Scottsdale. They had a few menus outside of the restaurant & after taking a glance, we decided to go in. The first thing that impressed us was that their were prices were much lower than typical restaurants in the area AND on top of that, their happy hour doesn't end until 8:00pm .. way later than most restaurants! We sat out on the patio & there was a TV screen that had a slideshow of some of their menu items, all which looked absolutely delicious! We ended up ordering the turkey burger with regular french fries & the gladiator with sweet potato fries. The burger was a little dry but tasted okay ... The fries were probably the best thing on the plate. Based on the uniqueness of the menu items, we were a little bit disappointed that the sweet potato fries didn't come with their own dipping sauce. I think they have a very extensive menu and as previously mentioned, their menu items are unique. I'd say that this is more of a hangout type place much like most places in Old Town, where you'd go to enjoy drinks & some appetizers. I'd probably stop by to try brunch as we've heard it's really good."}
{"text":"This is my new go-to breakfast spot when I'm in the Scottsdale area. Great food with friendly, efficient service.  My friend and I went on a busy Saturday morning but we seated before  we finished our complimentary coffee. My friend had the hangover sandwich, which she loved. I had eggs, bacon (extra crispy, just the way I like it!), and really yummy apple and pecan pancakes. Hopefully I can have breakfast here again before I return to SF!"}
{"text":"The waffle fries are a must when ordering food! They are crispy, yet meaty at the same time. Great flavor as well. Also good was the TBLT wrap, which had plenty of turkey on it. The Peppered Basil BLT was ok.. Lots of bacon on it and flavoring was pretty good. Maybe more tomatoes on it? Also had a side of Biscuits and Gravy. The biscuit was tasty and there's plenty of sausage in the gravy, but it lacked any real flavor. Overall, the food was good, but nothing out of this world.   Patio atmosphere was great and are server was very attentive!"}
{"text":"Wow!  Great place to eat!  Super busy but you didn't feel rushed to finish eating!  The owner works the floor too & made good recommends....she even comped is a cinnamon roll pancake that was delicious!  She said we would regret not ordering it...and she was Right!  I had the hash & it was wonderful!  Portions were reasonable as were the prices.  My daughter wanted a specialty coffee drink but couldn't decide whether to have it hot or cold & the owner said she would remake it if she wanted it hot!  She liked it cold!  Owner also told us about her philosophy about her food. Good quality & reasonable portions for a good price....it's working!  The bloody Mary's looked awesome too!"}
{"text":"I've been to \"Daily Dose\" several times and have had mixed experiences.  They don't do call-aheads or reservations, and sometimes there's a bit of a wait.  I've also been there once when they were out of a few key items, and I'm not a huge fan of their popular \"hangover sandwich,\" at least as it compares to other versions around town.  They do have a great Happy Hour which goes until 7:30 PM, and their patio is great for people-watching.  For Brunch I'd go with \"Breakfast Club\" or \"Morning Squeeze\" if you're in the area.   For Happy Hour I'd give this place a try for sure."}
{"text":"Met a friend for lunch there today...while breakfast usually wins(they serve it till 4pm!) I went for the Lunch choice-The Three Grain Veggie Burger-tomato, cucumber, grilled onion and more it was awesome and LOVE the pretzel bread bun. So if you can part with thier excellent breakfast I would suggest trying the Veggie Burger...and yes get the sweet potato fries..you know you want them!"}
{"text":"The menu is varied and I had a tough time deciding what to order. I finally decided on the Black Forest ham Benedict. It was pretty good, and the service for the first 2/3 of the visit was great, but the server was nowhere to be found during critical points such as needing coffee and needing the check. I would come back but I wasn't blown away."}
{"text":"Breakfast several times. Always fast friendly service.  Great food. just really like this place!   I must add We don't go at prime time -10 am on Saturday or Sunday. We go early like 8 am : ) no wait whatsoever!"}
{"text":"Really great all around good reliable restaurant.food very good good servce..in particular our waitress was so tolerant with us as we waited for a very late friend who was meeting us.we sat on patio and took the table for quite a bit.she was very nice about it.we all had breakfast and every bite was a pleasure."}
{"text":"Amazing breakfast choices. Delicious food. I highly recommend the crab cake platter and protein pancake. Heaven!"}
{"text":"Daily Dose is without a doubt the best breakfast spot in Scottsdale. There is a wide selection of breakfast options and everything that I have had was delicious. I also had a burger once and that was pretty good too. The Breakfast Nachos are a must have and I also recommend Hangover Sandwich. The only negative thing I'd have to say about the restaurant is that the service is sometimes a bit slow. There have been multiple times where I've had a spacey server."}
{"text":"One of the best places for breakfast in town. Little bit of an urban feel. Nice patio. Good service. Yummy pancakes, eggs, bacon, mimosas, fresh coffee. Yum. Wish it was a Sat. morning and I was there right now:)"}
{"text":"Food here was great. Would highly recommend. Very satisfied service. Would come back again and again for breakfast."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Went in to order a simple smoothie, gave out order in waited ten minutes until the one guy came back to inform me that they ran out of strawberries and peach. So I changed the order again. It's been a good twenty minutes to even get a simple smoothie. It's sad that when you hear good things about a place and your first experience wasn't what was described to you it was much worse then expected. All the employees rather sit around and talk to each other instead of getting on there own shit and want to improve the business. All I have to say is for my first time I refuse to go back. I rather go to a little shack then here."}
{"text":"Ok, so I'm back in Scottsdale after 4 years living abroad, & I wanted to get breakfast from one of my favorite places for breakfast near my place.   I was dining solo, so I asked the hostess for a seat at the bar. After a few minutes a place opened up & she sat me. I then proceeded to enjoy a delicious meal that included a chorizo omelette, a pancake, & a couple of delicious beverages.   When I was almost finished with my meal, a woman, not am employee, walks up & asks me to move. People around me had left, & now there was a chair on either side of me. I told her I was almost finished with my meal, & I'd be moving soon. She left to go into the bathroom. I the meantime, a lovely restaurant employee simply moved a chair to where her & her friend could immediately sit down. There was plenty of space for them without me moving.   They returned from the bathroom a few minutes later. As she was sitting down, she loudly said, I can't believe she's still sitting there. I was finished, & waiting for my bill at this point. I had ordered an Uber. I closed my check, & as I was leaving I walked over & said she might want to be a bit more considerate next time someone is in the middle of eating.   Then I left to head to my Uber, which was arriving. As I'm walking down the sidewalk, this crazy woman has chased me outside & is shouting at me. It was actually insane. I kept walking away, got in the car & left.   I called the restaurant to let the manager know what happened, & she was super nice. She said they only allow hostesses to seat at the bar on the weekends, so people don't feel rushed. She apologized & left a gift card for me, which was super nice. I only hope she didn't say anything to the mentally ill lady who chased me down the street. I'd be afraid for her safety."}
{"text":"We had a fantastic brunch here this morning. It was Labor Day, so a little busier than normal. We did have to sit in a little table a much in the back corner next to a booth. A little uncomfortable and weird sitting so close to the people next to us.   Food was delicious. I got the French toast. A very healthy serving with four slices of bread and a side of fruit. The boyfriend had the buttermilk pancakes. Also a large serving. Service was great and everything came out quickly. I would definitely recommend this spot!"}
{"text":"Visited this place 7/18/15. AM  I have a Love hate relationship with this place. This time/This location was good. We had an issue with dirty seats and tables but the server took care of it asap. She was great!!  Food was good, the Eggs Benedict was a little cold but tasted good. The pancakes were great!  Only real negative was the side order of toast. 1 slice of toast, the thin slice toast, $1.25. ONE SLICE!!  not cool DD, not cool!  If you are in Scottsdale, this is a good place to get breakfast.   It does get busy alter in the morning. We were there about 730am."}
{"text":"This place is WOW! We were seated right away and the owner (Jenlynn) came by soon thereafter for our drink order. We were first-timers, so we weren't sure what to order. No problem!! She suggested the breakfast nachos, chose the beers for our beer flights and also recommended some other things. SHE DID NOT DISAPPOINT! Everything was delicious and fresh. I hardly everrrrrr give 5 stars, but if I could give this place SIX stars, I would! Amazing. We will def be back! Servers came and refilled drinks and cleaned up table in timely manner too. We interacted with many of the serving staff and everyone was sooooo nice and pleasant. Also, the cinnamon roll pancake, SWEET JESUS!!! Delicious....."}
{"text":"...and with a few passive-aggressive words, Daily Dose lost one of their most loyal customers (to see just how much I have enjoyed DD's great service and wonderful food, please read my prior review, below; it's long been my favorite breakfast spot in Old Town).  Our server was genuinely friendly and she swiftly brought out coffee, water, a couple of really yummy mimosas (it's Easter morning, so why not!) and then took our order.  Coincidentally, we both ordered the Turkey Sausage White-Out omelet (four egg whites filled with turkey sausage and mozzarella... bowl or fruit & multi-grain toast on the side); another server brought them out surprisingly quickly, I mean immediately after our order, which is when things began feeling not quite right.  Before I cut into the omelet, I put my finger on it because it didn't look hot, and it wasn't (it was a little warmer than room temperature); I cut a small bite -- the same, just kind of warm.  This made no sense... I had just placed the order and they just brought it from the kitchen.  Before I said anything about my omelet, my friend said, \"I'm sending mine back, this isn't right\".  I cut my omelet in half and touched the turkey sausage in the middle... it wasn't frozen but it was still cool.  I asked my friend, \"Restaurants don't pre-make and reheat omelets, do they?\"  I thought this might explain why they came out from the kitchen so quickly and also why they weren't really hot.  She shrugged, \"I wouldn't think so...\".    I really really really dislike being that pretentious/entitled guy who sends back food because it's not to his liking, so when our server checked back with us I tried to politely tell her that the eggs were just barely warm and... -- before we could finish she very courteously took up both of our plates and shook her head saying, \"I'm so sorry, don't worry about it, I'll take care of it right away!\" (I wish that we'd have gotten her name so we could recommend her!)  But then, Immediately thereafter, the manager on duty came over, put the palms of his hands down on the corners of our table and asked, \"So, you want your omelets scalding or what?\".    The passive-aggressiveness of the question was so surprising that I could only think to say, \"I'm sorry?\"  \"I just wanted to know if you wanted them scalding,\" he replied.  I tried to explain that the omelets were just barely warm, the turkey in the middle was cold, etc., but he asserted \"I checked it in the kitchen, it was hot\".  I explained that we both thought they seemed to be reheated but he insisted, \"I picked them up in my hands, they were both hot\".  Sort of stunned, I looked at my friend and said, \"Then I guess we're the problem... We'll just pay for these [mimosas] and go,\" I said.  \"Don't worry about it,\" he said and walked away.  I put seven dollars on the table as a tip for our original server and we walked out the door, saddened about my old favorite..."}
{"text":"What a gem this place is! Awesome food choices, including some delicious healthy options. I had the egg white and chicken dish, and it was fantastic. The rest of the fam had regular pancakes, cinnamon roll pancakes, and an egg white and turkey sausage omelet. Everything was awful.  The only thing that took away was I think we got the new gal because our drinks weren't as attended to as they could be and the bread choice wasn't right when the plates first came out.   I'll definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I work three hops from the Daily Dose so I had to try it as one of my first ventures out at lunch time.  We went a a little early which is critical if you are in a hurry as this place gets packed - the kitchen is fast but you might have a wait for a table.  The first time, DS met me as he had a job interview (sigh....baby boy is growing up!) and we brought a cubbie buddy from work.    DH and I both had the Southwest Club Wrap,  It was a nice portion although I asked for mine without the guac and found the sandwich to be a tad dry.  I think I would have liked it better with a little something else to moisten it a bit. I expected it to have a bit more kick with the peppered bacon but it didn't.  So although it was a well-stuffed wrap, it was just boring to me and him (he did have the guac).   He had the pile of combo fries which he deemed to be quite tasty and I had the very generous cup of fresh fruit which was a nice mix of melon and pineapple.  Cubby buddy ordered her fav from there - the eggs Benedict with turkey sausage.  It is the only thing she orders there so, of course, the next time I went, that was on my list.  So here is visit #2 - I had to take a  new employee to lunch and it was on the boss' tab so back we came and I had my sights on those eggs.    Now they are worth coming back for!  I like eggs Benedict. Actually, unlike Julia Roberts in \"Runaway Bride\", I like eggs most any style but when you can take them and slather them with sauce well heck - they are just heavenly.  The Hollandaise is tasty - a little heavy handed but seriously that is what makes it so good.  And you will use that English muffin to sop up EVERY drop of it (before the days of YouTube, I would have licked that plate dry but you never know who is taping these days....). But what makes the eggs Benedict here is the turkey sausage.  I don't know whose they use - I am assuming they local source but maybe not - but it is just good. It is some of the best turkey sausage I have ever had - and I try it everywhere.  DH and I even buy our own spices and ground turkey and do our own in an attempt to make a really tasty sausage.  Whoever they use - it is good stuff - it is tasty like sausage but not overwhelmingly salty.  So now whenever I return to the DD, this is my go-to dish. Period.  It does come with the potatoes (meh - they are okay, nothing special) and I always opt for the fruit cup as it is fresh and a wonderfully sweet way to end a meal!"}
{"text":"Daily Dose is my favorite go-to on nearly any occasion.  Breakfast?  Yep, you HAVE to try the Prime Rib Omelette.  Lunch?  Definitely, their salads are unbeatable.  Dinner?  Their happy hour is the best!  Seriously, though, the vibe inside is perfect, and the servers are friendly.  I never get tired of going to Daily Dose."}
{"text":"Breakfast nachos were excellent and could easily feed 2 people. Friendly service. Bar atmosphere."}
{"text":"Loved this breakfast spot! I'm normally a breakfast club type of girl but we tried something new and the food was exactly what I was craving after a night of drinking. They sat us next to the door which I didn't like and I really wish they played music to give the ambiance a better feel. Our server was Chloe and she was awesome!!! I ordered the breakfast nachos and I will be back just based off of the food!"}
{"text":"Almost a 5 star and my new favorite place for breakfast in Scottsdale. Just gotta say that the Peach Creme Brûlée Pancakes are killer! Actually, everything that was put on the table was excellent and the portions were big (too big). They even made a special order for me because of a food allergy that I have. THAT was two thumbs way-up and a big pleasant surprise! Huge UPS to Daily Dose!"}
{"text":"I usually think breakfast is one of those meals you can't miss but this time it missed the mark! I had egg white wrap with potatoes and fruit. The wrap was soggy, dripping,  mushy. The potatoes were for sure made from a frozen bag, sooo salty. Kids had pancakes which tasted like chemicals, maybe premade batter?? The husband had corned beef with eggs and toast. Toast! One piece, anyway he enjoyed the corned beef. I will for sure not be back again. The service was ok, we waited awhile for someone to take our order. Not going to go back. Glad my hubby enjoyed his meal. I did not enjoy my \"daily dose\"."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped in for a late week day breakfast, the potatoes and DD Hash are very good, the black iced tea is very tasty.  My ham eggs benedict were good but the eggs were very small.    My wife had the banana bread French toast which lived up to its name, it was like a desert with the candied nuts and sauce.  My son enjoyed his fruit and waffle.  I wish the place was closer so we could visit more often."}
{"text":"Breakfast. Straight Shooter & Crabby Omelette.  Love it here. Nice waitresses make you feel right at home. Constant refills kept my coffee hot, always nice. Breakfast plates yesterday and today were tasty & the portions were large.  I plan on returning for dinner tonite. It's THAT good."}
{"text":"Had an amazing breakfast here!  Glad I stopped in try it.  Will be coming back definitely."}
{"text":"Best brunch place in town. Great food, amazing good. Breakfast nachos, hangover sandwich, and banana nut bread French Toast are all on point. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Great service and even better food.  One of the best breakfast joints in Scottsdale, probably AZ! The various Eggs Benedict options are your best bet.  A can't miss restaurant to visit"}
{"text":"CON: I took my parents and boyfriend for the first time yesterday as they are very picky about their breakfasts. My boyfriend got the breakfast burger which he ordered medium well. It came out near raw. He barely ate it. My moms eggs were a \"runny\" scrambled and she wouldn't eat them. And the gravy she ordered was beyond salty. I couldn't even eat that. My bacon was really fatty which I haven't had before there. My dad ordered coffee and specially said no cream as he very much does not like cream, she brought it anyway and I had to ask to have it removed from the table. Also, the option for regular water without cucumber on the table would be great too as we all asked for that. My family is too nice to send food back or say anything also afraid of the kitchen retaliation in their food. I don't know if it was because it was so busy or just a bad cook day but a busy place like that in old town should ALWAYS be on point.   PRO: We got seated right away and the pancakes were great!"}
{"text":"Food is decent.  Not sure why people go crazy for it.  Bad service.  Decent American food.get"}
{"text":"Holy, yum.  I was able to have brunch here, when I was in town for a wedding, and I'm sure glad I did.    For brunch, my boyfriend and I both ordered omelets. The omelets were pretty standard fair, but with big portions and cooked well.  This place really excels in the details more than anything else.  The water is infused with cucumber, which makes it refreshing and just that much more special.  With your meal, you get toast, potatoes and your choice of side, where most places make you opt out of potatoes if you want something else.  The meal came with a side of rosemary creme fraiche that was absolutely delicious.  I love rosemary and the condiment meshed well with both the omelet and potatoes and infused a rosemary tang.  The potatoes were cooked well, no soggy home fries here, and the fruit was a nice mix of watermelon, grapes, and pineapple.  But the real star of the show, and the reason I hope to eat here again is the jam.  Oh my goodness, this jam was homemade and absolutely excellent.  It was filled with fresh berries and elevated a normal piece of toast to epic proportions.  I want some more just thinking about it.  The food is solid, the staff attentive and friendly, and the jam phenomenal."}
{"text":"Great old town bar. Cheap specials every day. The food is well above \"bar food\" genre. The vibe is always vibrant and noisy... in a good way. Eat here for breakfast, lunch or dinner. One of my \"go to\" spots in old town if I want some comfort food"}
{"text":"This is a great breakfast place! The food was amazing and the coffee was good too! It was packed and there's a good reason why. It's definitely worth the wait and I'll be going back next time I'm in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"My favorite meal is breakfast, Daily Dose is one of my favorite breakfast places, whenever I have the time and the option to have breakfast the first place that comes to mind is Daily Dose.   I really recommend the breakfast burger or the chicken waffles. I get regular waffles, not the cornbread ones. The bacon mimosa is so yummy!  Management is great! The guy is personable and treats costumers with respect. He really stands high.   If you like a quick meal and be served fast go to the bar, the Spanish speaking girl is so good.   Service at other tables takes a long wait, seems like needs a better communication between the host and the servers. Today was the example, got a table and waited for 10 minutes, no water, not an acknowledgment just like a simple \"I will be with you in a second\". I was disappointed and walked away. I am giving three stars because this is not the first time service has been mediocre."}
{"text":"Decent breakfast. I got the veggie omelet and the mister got eggs Benedict \"dd style\" (on a biscuit instead of English muffin and gravy instead of hollandaise). He was very happy with that substitution, and mine was fine, but overall the food was pretty salty. The coffee is not very good."}
{"text":"Huge portions. My daughter and I split the cinnamon roll pancakes and a side of dd hash. The pancakes were excellent. The dd hash was not so good. My husband had the banana bread french toast. He liked it a lot as well. The outdoor dining area was nice and they allow dogs. Which was a bonus for us."}
{"text":"I'm giving the Daily Dose 5 stars because I had the best biscuits and gravy I have ever eaten there today!  The breakfast potatoes needed more flavor--season them please!!!...but  no stars deducted because the B&G were that good!.  Unfortunately I live in Texas!!!  Fruit salad was fresh and great."}
{"text":"I went here on vacation and I'll enthusiastically return any time I'm in the area. Butternut squash was new to me, and it was awesome. Omelette was excellent (though huge) and I tried to eat it all."}
{"text":"Great food and vibe! Bowels are awesome. Entrees are definitely shareable and they make a mean Bloody Mary."}
{"text":"The food here is consistently REALLY GOOD.  It's nothing fancy - burgers, salads, etc - and the decor is pretty marginal.  But that aside, it is one of my favorite places to go with my husband when we just want a simple, delicious meal without all of the hoopla of getting dressed to \"go out\".  We usually just skip past the hostess and sit and the bar and watch a football or basketball game, and the staff has always been friendly (although when we do actually sit at a table they could be a bit more attentive).  Also, I've yet to have something I dislike, but the favorites have to be any salad with their house dressing (cilantro-lime) and my husband loves the gladiator burger on the pretzel bun.  The fish and chips are amazing entirely because of the slaw they serve with it - no mayo, all yummy vinegar-y spicy-ness.  I would buy that stuff by the gallon if they'd sell it to me.   Reason for only 3 stars: Sometimes the staff is a little TOO comfortable.  If there aren't a lot of patrons in the restaurant, they will just have their conversations (usually gossip) right over your head - one even belched while we were at the bar.    Another slight downside -  they play annoying top 40.  Overall - a great place for a tasty meal with an easy feel."}
{"text":"Great food and great service! The french toast is amazing and the coffee mugs are huge! Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I've been going to daily dose for a while now and their food quality has gotten awful . It's not the same . I order huveos rancheros and got this egg watery soup  . My stomach was hurting for 2 days!! Sad I really liked this place but won't be returning ."}
{"text":"Ok, 1st time here! Dog friendly makes it great in my book! Brittany our waitress was so nice and recommended the a great  cocktail!! The rest of service was really really good, everyone working g as a team!!! . Food was very very good as well! The \"stak\" sandwich was delicious!! Highly recommend....also I had to go for the Cinnamon Roll pancakes, yikes, and YUMMERS!!!  If in \"old town\" give it a try, it's worth it he wait, if infact you have to!"}
{"text":"Almost two years since my last review, but not much has changed at all. The crowds are still here, but we only had a five minute wait at 9:30 AM. My $9 meal was top notch and included two buttermilk pancakes, crispy bacon and two eggs scrambled and fruit. Everything was spot on perfect and the coffee got refilled promptly and waitress was excellent as well. Always a solid choice at breakfast."}
{"text":"Early morning waking up from a bad night of drinking and just in pain because you have no food in your system?... Well that was me like every Sunday morning in old town. Woke up and right away my friends go \"Find something good on Yelp\" well okay if you say so. Looking at a couple different options and scrolling through pictures Daily Dose caught my eyes. The pictures people were posting looked amazing and the reviews were on the positive side so i said lets go to Daily Dose!! Scratch that I drove I just told everyone to get into the car I didn't care what they had to say. Haha, arriving around 12:30pm there was a waiting time of 30 minutes but after when my friend pulled out this driver license to show it was his birthday she said she would let us in a little early if she found a spot for the 6 of us. Sat down outside with complimentary coffee for the wait which is very nice addition knowing they are always busy if they have that. She called our name out in about 10 minutes of waiting which was nice. We sat down and our waitress was very nice with us and I asked her a couple of questions and she said go with the Breakfast Nachos and oh I did..  I got the Salsa and the Pico on the side and also added Bacon... These were the best Nachos I have ever had in my life.. The cheese was melted perfectly the scrambled eggs and bacon on top was amazing and so was this dipping sauce they had it was like soup. The service was fast and amazing they messed up on the birthday boys nachos but fixed it right away with no issue and apologized for it. The seating is nice and they also have TV's. This place was the cure for me that Sunday morning. First breakfast place I've actually enjoyed, can't wait to come back!!"}
{"text":"Hmmm, not sure where to begin.  It should be standard for any location within Old Town Scottsdale to have amazing atmosphere, service, and food and the thing about Daily Dose is they struck out on food which after all is said and done, is the end all of a restaurant.  Because if a place has bad service but great food, you can justify getting a great breakfast and ignore the server giving it to you.  The patio is cute and the server was nice, but my omelet was only so so and my \"side of fruit\" was actually less in amount than one of those fruit cups moms throw inside their kids lunchboxes...  I'll use my 2nd paragraph to briefly vent on how annoying it is to be sitting at a table with your friend and the servers are doing their sidework while you're trying to vent to said friend! GO TO THE BACK!!  I'm off to the Breakfast Club next time...sorry DD, you just didn't do it for me :("}
{"text":"Wonderful meal!! My husband had eggs Benedict skirt steak dd style while I enjoyed the breakfast sandwich. We were blown away by both. This is a must while in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Love this place. I come here when visiting family in AZ and I look forward to breakfast when planning this trip. There is usually a wait but I think it's worth it, good food, drinks and staff."}
{"text":"This place is great but super crowded, expect a minimum 20 min. wait during the weekend! Latte was great, they will make you almost anything and have a lot of different coffee drinks. It was a fun atmosphere we ended up sitting at the bar because there was barely any seating but it wasn't overwhelmingly loud or crowded other than at the entrance. We got traditional eggs Benedict and the southwest wrap. Both were delicious, not too much food just the right amount. The eggs benedict was a little lacking on the ham but otherwise delicious! We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"ZuZu? Orange Table?  D'lish? The Breakfast Club?  OR Daily Dose?  This is what I pondered early Sunday morning as I planned to meet friends for brunch.  After reading numerous Yelp reviews and a few other sites, Daily Dose was the decision!   The four of us were seated outside at a raised table.  Nice!  Inside seemed really claustrophobic and dark, so to be outside was great.  Our waitress was slow to arrive, but time passed easily as we were caught up in conversation.  I had read that Daily Dose had the BEST Bloody Marys in town.  So we all ordered one.  I love celery in mine, but I guess they do not garnish with celery, but the waitress said she would do it if I wanted.  We all ordered them spicy too.  We couldn't wait!!!!!!!  But we DID wait........and wait.......and wait......and wait, well you get my drift.  They finally came!  With a green onion as a garnish!?!  OK, Celery?  Oh, it WAS in there, just a tiny short piece that was halfway down the glass.  Well, she did have it in there.   The menu item choices were impressive!  They looked so creative!  I was excited to order! We ordered the breakfast nachos, which everyone on Yelp raved about!  We also ordered the eggs benedict with prime rib and the Southwest Flannel Hash.  And then we waited, and waited and waited...... EVERYONE on the patio had no food.  NONE!  I love looking at what other people have ordered, but not one person on the \"packed\" patio had food.  Not in any stage- just starting, just finishing, in the middle, nothing.  Many did not have anything but water.  I couldn't believe how long the service took.    FINALLY, our food came with no apology of how long it took.  I shared our order of nachos and prime rib eggs benedict.  The eggs benedict looked good, but when I cut into it, it was a snotty, white mess of undercooked egg white.  In my experience, the only runny part should be the yoke, right?  Well, although I would have preferred the white to have been cooked, my husband and I ate it anyway.  The prime rib was virtually nonexistent.  The breakfast nachos were a HUGE disappointment.  The chorizo was more like flavorless ground meat.  No zing or heat.  The scrambled eggs on it were dry, overcooked, and tasted of sulfur - which is what happens to scrambled eggs when they are over cooked.  There was supposed to be mozzarella cheese on them.  Where?   I don't know, but the nachos were covered in a gluey sauce that I assume was supposed to be a nacho cheese of some sort?  There was also a cup of the gluey sauce on the side.  I guess they felt we needed more? The chips were so greasy, most were translucent.  We didn't eat most of it, just tried to pick and find the edible parts.  By that time we were so hungry and who knows where our 18 year old waitress was to make a complaint anyway.  My friend's Southwest Flannel Hash, which she let me sample, were the WORST I ever had.  I mean how can you mess up corned beef hash?  There was a weird sweet component to it.  She did not finish it, which is odd because she loves corned beef hash and always finishes it.  Her Husband had the prime rib eggs benedict like I did.  He is in the restaurant industry and manages a very popular resort restaurant and he was not happy with his meal at all.  Especially the prime rib part.  I was with him on that one.  To wrap up our  two and  1/2 hour brunch  experience (yes it took that long from start to finish due to slow service) Daily Dose was flat bland, busy and overpriced.   Sorry brother and sister Yelpers, I am in disagreement on this one."}
{"text":"We found this gem and went back 3 times.  Great menu.  The staff was awesome.  The vibe was great.  The presentation of the food made you feel like they cared about the whole experience, not just getting head counts.  We will DEFINITELY be back!"}
{"text":"Daily Dose is a hot spot for breakfast and brunch in the Old Town Scottsdale area. Great food and a great happy hour as well. On the weekends the wait can sometimes get up to 45 minutes long, but it is well worth it. Their DD Hash is a must to go along with any order. Service is exceptional as well and they do cater to the \"gluten free\" lifestyle with many choices to accommodate those needs. The Hangover Sandwich is my favorite whether I'm hungover or not."}
{"text":"AMAZING! The food and coffee are delicious. It's worth the wait on the busy weekends. The banana bread French toast is heavenly."}
{"text":"Traveling sure makes me hungry! After a long flight from Chicago I was just about to break into my 3rd bag of pop chips when it was time for lunch. Hooray!  I joined the infamous Lindsey F and Gabi M for lunch here at Daily Dose. When we walked in Gabi told me it was a 3 star restaurant. I wasn't sure why we were eating at a 3 star restaurant when surrounded by so many fabulous dining establishments, but any food would do.  We were able to grab a table immediately, the menu is pretty extensive and our waitress was friendly. But yep..3 stars. My rock shrimp tacos sure beat another bag of pop chips, but weren't anything special.  And the friendly waitress forgot about our hummus appetizer.  If I was in the area I wouldn't hesitate to grab a quick bite or drink here, but nothing here to hop on a plane back to Phoenix."}
{"text":"We are giving this one star just because of the service we received. After our meal we asked for the bill and it took our waitress a long time to bring it...probably about 10 minutes. We then asked for a to go box. When a long time had passed I asked the bus boy for one and he brought it to us. A few minutes after that the waitress finally came back with it and said \"oh you already got one.\" I then gave her the bill with my credit card. It took her awhile to come back with this too, and meanwhile our 1 year old is getting cranky and starting to cry. She finally comes back and says the card machine is down and it will be just a minute. After another 10 minutes passed we found the manager and he said they were working on it and it would be done shortly. Another 10 minutes went by and we grabbed him again and he brought us a piece of paper to sign and said he would run my tab later. Never apologized, didn't offer to comp any part of our meal. Nothing. And it took about 30-40 minutes from the time we asked for the bill until the time we left. All with a screaming baby."}
{"text":"I have now been to Daily Dose 4 or 5 times and each time has been wonderful. Occasionally, you have to wait at the front for someone to acknowledge you and finally seat you but the short wait is worth it!   They serve breakfast until 3pm during the week and ALL day on the weekends. I enjoy the eggwhite wrap and always look forward to the large breakfast potatoes. My favorite part about breakfast is the homemade jam they bring with toast! I also love their burgers! The food is well cooked, creative, and delicious.   They also have a wonderful happy hour that lasts until 8pm!  The specialty cocktails are clever but some of them are not well executed (too sweet).  I love sitting at the bar or out on the patio. The service is always friendly and everyone seems eager to please. They put cucumber slices in the water which makes the tap water actually taste GOOD. These small attentions to detail really add up and make this place one of my favorites! I drive down from North Scottsdale just to eat here!"}
{"text":"Tried this spot today for brunch...really good menu selection for both brunch and lunch, and it seems they have a decent happy hour too. I had the whole wheat pancakes with the acorn squash hash. It was great and a huge portion. My dining partner had french toast with fruit which she enjoyed. The service was great despite it being packed, and prices were reasonable. My only slightly negative comment is I'm not a fan of the cucumber slices in water. Because I don't like drinking cucumber. But that's pretty minor. I'd definitely come back here :-)"}
{"text":"Very good! Good service, good food, great atmosphere. Clean and well kept. I would return frequently. I had the TBLT with crispy fries. All was delicious. The service was fast and efficient. Food came out as ordered. Water was refilled often but not too often. Special instructions about the food was met with no problem."}
{"text":"This place is an awesome place for happy  hour food deals.  Their drink specials are decent too . . . . but the Chorizo mac and cheese!!!  I dream about it.  The sauce is a bit soupy and there isn't a ton of chorizo meat its really more for flavor, but to me its perfect.   Spicy, cheesy, and yummy all in one dish for $5.  So their happy hour goes (I think) from 4pm-8pm every day.   They have a lot of $5 options for food, and all hamburgers (made with yummy pretzels buns) are $3 off.  Warm Brie, nachos, guacamole and salsa for 3.5 and there is TON of guac.  I was shocked when I saw the portion.  Go here now before they raise their prices and change their happy hour menu."}
{"text":"Visited on a beautiful afternoon and it was the perfect spot to hang out. They have a great little patio area to people watch, and their drink menu was great- It was overall a relaxing atmosphere. I enjoyed a refreshing margarita, and both my mom and I enjoyed the tacos: I got one Cajun grilled and one crispy cod fish, and my mom got one cajun portobello and one crispy polenta taco. So good! Their whole menu looked great."}
{"text":"Really tasty and lots of appealing options. I opted for the polenta and poblano Benedict. Super filling. Their potatoes are good, large portion. My dining companion found her waffle delicious and filling. Side of fruit full of ripe pineapple, and great coffee!"}
{"text":"This was recommended to us by several people....  Hostess was very nice - sweet girl. We waited for a table on the patio rail... Server was nice (Sorry I don't remember the name) had a little accent.....  His recommendations were good, but our food took 40 minutes. The sever realized it 20 minutes out - the manager ran our food and apologized, but no one checked to see how our food was - it was cold and the poached eggs over cooked with zero yolk.  We got our bill - paid it and left it at that.... $50 for a breakfast that wasn't good and took 40 min - #nottheserversfault"}
{"text":"The food here is delicious! I got the banana bread french toast (about $10) and my friend got the cinnamon roll pancakes. The pancakes tasted just like Cinnabon cinnamon rolls, so it was a little too sugary for me personally in the morning, but my friend loved them! She said she gets them every time she goes to Daily Dose. I would highly recommend the freshly squeezed orange juice. I was debating about getting it because it was $4 and I was like, is it really worth $4? But it is! It actually does taste freshly squeezed. This was my first time coming here and I waited about 20 minutes to be seated. My friend says it's always crowded when she comes, so be prepared to wait when you come. But you know, when you have to wait, that means a lot of people like eating at this restaurant. I would recommend this place to other people."}
{"text":"I didn't like the name and look of this place for some reason so it took me awhile to finally go here and I am mad at myself for not going sooner! I've been to Daily Dose for happy hour and breakfast and both were fabulous. Who has happy hour til 8 pm?!! Daily Dose does!! love the late happy hour and good drink specials. But the real thing that won me over about DD was the breakfast!  Best breakfast I have had in AZ for sure!  There were so many things I wanted to try and I can't wait to go back again!  I tried the turkey sausage, egg white omelet with toast and fruit; protein pancake; and sausage gravy & biscuits.  All of it was amazing.  I was thinking the protein pancakes would be like US Egg's but they are not.  They are very different but in a good way.   I really want to try the lunch as well. I have a feeling I will become a frequent guest at Daily Dose now.  Sorry I wasn't sooner."}
{"text":"Best breakfast in town.  The hangover sandwich is bat far, the best breakfast sandwich I have ever had...bar none.  Thank u DD!  Xoxo"}
{"text":"Great location, atmosphere, and service. Came with a couple friends and we had the flannel hash, gluten free mixed berry pancake, campfire s'more pancake, and the poblano benedict.   Pancakes were awesome, and I'm so thankful they have a gluten free option:). Coffee was also delicious. The hash and benedict were good, but not great. Overall, great experience. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"On our last day in Phoenix, we decided to go to Scottsdale and do some sightseeing.  Saw this place had fairly high rating and wanted to give it a try.  The menu offered a wide variety but with out it being too overbearing with so many options.  My wife ordered the Smokey stuffed Portabella Mushrooms and I had the Turkey Sausage & White out.  They both came with a side of toast of your choice and a very generous bowl of mix fruit.  My liked her order, but wished the cheese had been melted all the way. I thought my order was boring, just a egg white omelets with chopped turkey sausage & cheese.  I would note that the locally made turkey sausage was very tasty!  And the fruit was great, not at of the can.  I actually couldn't believe the size they give you.  I wasn't the typical 3 grapes, a piece of pineapple, and a piece of melon!  :D  The service here seems to be pretty good.  Unfortunately, our server wasn't so much!  She seemed more interested in getting back to the hostess desk and talking with the other servers.  When asked about a few of the items of the menu, her answered was rushed, quick and without thought.   The Price was fit just right, nothing we saw was outrageous.    The atmosphere very nice. It had a nice interior, bar, indoor/outdoor dinning areas (with a big screen TV showing EPSN Sportcenter :D).  It definitely a place I would consider for happy hour. Very clean.    Parking could be a bit of a issue I would imagine for lunch, dinner, and weekends due to the location being in Ole Scottsdale.  But there was a few parking lots located right around the corner.  Overall, I thought the place was decent.  Would go back for lunch or dinner if in the area again.  But will make sure I do not get the same server again."}
{"text":"Great food and great service. In town from VA with family and came in for breakfast. I have multiple allergies and our server Mikey was a rock star. He made great suggestions and answered all our questions! FYI, gluten free cinnamon rolls pancakes better then any pancake ever. Everyone at my table couldn't stop taking bites. Everyone's meals were interesting and delicious."}
{"text":"Food is always good - we come in for lunch - a bit too noisy for us so we hope we get a side booth so we can talk - have invited friends there too and they like it - thanks for the good service and good food."}
{"text":"I can't believe this is the first time I have been here. On the weekends there is always a wait so I went on a weekday when it wasn't too crowded. Got seated straight away in the patio. The patio has a tv.  The waitress was very nice and helpful and gave us delicious recommendations.  The egg white wrap was delicious and healthy. The stuffed portobello was surprisingly tasty, with roasted peppers and cheese and a large bowl of fruit. You can get a single pancake of any special kind (loaded) for only $3.50.   I will totally go back!"}
{"text":"Super yummy food and great atmosphere.  There is a market inside as well as a restaurant. Cool place."}
{"text":"The DD Hash I could just eat all by it self! The polenta poblano Benedict was amazing & a must try! Thanks to Ashley was a great server!"}
{"text":"Mimosas, prime rib eggs Benedict, and some eggs & pancakes. Everything is absolutely delicious. I come here for weekend brunch often. Good environment. Great section of food."}
{"text":"Awesome service and food!   Went with my parents and husband for my birthday breakfast and I am so glad we decided to check this place out.   Let me state they have Vegetarian and Gluten Free options, which is always a win in my books.   We ordered the Meat & Cheese Omelette, which came with Chorizo and Italian sausage.  It came with Herb Potatoes and Seasonal Fruit but it also came with toast which mine was Gluten Free Toast and it was yummy."}
{"text":"The coffee drinks were delicious but on the sweet side.  I could have easily diluted mine with about six more ounces of almond milk and I think it would have been perfect.    I could only eat one of my cinnamon roll pancakes but it was yummy.  They got a little chewy later in the day but were still very tasty.  Great little breakfast place!"}
{"text":"Great food for breakfast and great staff!!!....can't wait to go back great menu and bloody Mary's !!!"}
{"text":"Great place to go on a Sunday/Saturday for some good breakfast."}
{"text":"Great lil spot in Old Town and kinda of an old die hard. We usually frequent the Highland location, but this one is great too. We decided to come here immediately after our initial brunch plans landed us in front of a racist cafe owner out in Gainey Ranch area. It was such a welcome relief to be here even with the wait. Staff was super sweet even though they were totally slammed. I just had a caprese omlette and a latte. Must RAVE about the latte which as a Seattlite and a coffee freak was a great roast.  MUST RAVE #2 the DD Hash which is this amazing butternut squash and porcini mushroom concoction... super flavorful. Sigh... just loved the environment casual, cozy, fun, the game was on. What can I say this place is like coming home."}
{"text":"Daily Dose does the trick. Enough so that I ate breakfast here two days in a row. And while I'm sure this bar and restaurant serves many different purposes to many different people, I think I can tell that breakfast would be my main reason for stopping in here.   What do I like about it? Well, the menu is diverse and easily customizable. Both days I wanted to get some protein heavy, low carb options and while they do have some pretty healthy stuff already on offer, I chose to go the omelet route and sub out some the taters and toast for other stuff, like cottage cheese, other proteins, etc. And I got zero hesitation or argument. Yay! Nice and easy. The food itself? Tasty. Nothing uber gourmet or mind-blowing, but I can tell they're using better than average ingredients, and said ingredients are put together well.   Service was quick and friendly on both visits. And weekday breakfasts, at least around 730 am, are pretty quiet. So it's get in, get eatin', and get on to work. BOOM!   Not really my style/vibe for other meals/occasions, I value this kind of food and service and quality for breakfast. Normally I have to work hard to get away from the starch-driven meals that dominate breakfast menus, but here they're ready for me and my quirky needs. Dig it!"}
{"text":"The service at Daily Dose was wonderful,  very warm and friendly = 2 stars.  The food was not bad,  nothing really wrong persay,  just not great or anything we would like to have again.  We will most likely not return.  There are so many amazing breakfast places in the area, competition is steep."}
{"text":"While on #Vacay we like most #Yelp and look to try something different-but in my opinion a referral by a friend is best! So we stood at the #Saguaro and walked through OT #Scottsdale the accommodations (water & coffee) were a nice touch, location nice & facility was perfect! My Salmon w/eggs the best I've ever had! Seriously creamy-light and just perfect! So why 4-Star my carpaccio was very weak! So the waitress she was such a doll...sent it back and recommended adding a shot or two, to which we did and were completely satisfied! #NotToBeOverlyPicky just my opinion...to be honest -4 1/2 Stars is more accurate! #GreatSpot we will return!   -Blessings"}
{"text":"Wow, smack dab in the middle of Scottsdale, and I had yet to try it.  Until today...  Having lunched there today, I have mixed feelings.  I think my review would align most with my fellow Yelper, Don J.  This place has potential.  The atmosphere is great: great artwork, great colors, cheerful, clean.  Even the service was good, which seems to be an improvement since the reviews began.  And the food was good too, but it missed that special something that Don J. was trying to describe...I think the ingredients are quality, but give me something a bit unusual, mix up the ingredients, try a new sauce, create that special something that makes me want to come back."}
{"text":"The toastado was very good. They serve cucumber water. I also had the s'mores pancakes and was very impressed. Service was great and attentive"}
{"text":"So let me start off by saying that I love Daily Dose. I'm just not a fan of the Scottsdale location. I was actually at the Mid-Town location Sunday morning and my breakfast was perfect and the service was flawless as usual. My daughter wanted Daily today for her birthday breakfast so we decided to go to the Scottsdale location rather than Mid Town because we wanted to stay east today. Messed our order up, then we waited forever to see a server to get it right then brought over missing item cold after the entire meal was finished mind you. I'm like ok, whatever, prob comp birthday girls hot chocolate for messing up her order. No. I just thought it would be thoughtful to try to make up for messing up my daughters order. The food was fine the service meh, but coming from Mid Town I guess I have to lower my standards when I eat at the Scottsdale location. I will go back to Daily just never Scottsdale. It's never been a great experience there for me :/"}
{"text":"Great place. Consistent. New Menu , still have some of the original items. They now have beer Craft flights 50oz pours 6 for $7.50 and also 48oz pitchers. Food is fresh, made to order and something for everyone."}
{"text":"Yum-may!    Headed to this place with no expectations and left VERY happy.  Split the burger, served on a pretzel bun (yay!) and fries plus a side salad.  Service was good, food was great and timing was awesome (in and out, no muss no fuss).  Also had a great, unique beer list!  Definitely heading back!"}
{"text":"The food here is amazing! There are plenty of options for the whole family.  The workers are friendly and quick to get the drinks and food out. Unfortunately my family and I came here during a busy Saturday morning around 9 am. We knew this place would be busy but didn't realize just how busy it really was going to be. We checked in and were told around 35 to 45 minute wait. After an hour of hearing tons of names being called and people going in, we noticed a few group go in that arrived after us. We went inside to ask and were told they had called our name and we didn't come forward so they scratched us off.  I know this is not possible because I had a party of 5 all waiting, and all listening for the same name, which was never called.  Luckily they were very understanding and quickly turned a 4 person table into a 5 person table and sat us quickly after the confusion.  Without this experience I would have given a 5 star review because they really are a delicious breakfast place!"}
{"text":"Breakfast until 4pm. Hooray. Great menu, great service, great happy hour."}
{"text":"This location gets way more stars than the camelback location. Not much of a wait and the staff is nice. Food is good and I like how they put cucumber in your water. Had the ham eggs Benny and it was good. We missed the long wait so a star for that too."}
{"text":"Visiting from DC and not a breakfast person. The food was awesome. I had poached eggs on crispy polenta w/ corn beef topped with a jalapeño hollandaise. Mikey the sever was so nice and helpfulz"}
{"text":"Stumbled on this spot through Yelp looking for funky desserts; however this is strictly a breakfast and lunch spot so you will miss the boat if you don't wake up in time for some fun breakfast food. We sat at the bar around 11:30am on a Tuesday as we needed fast service before we departed the city and we surely got fast service. Started off with a mimosa which I liked the proseco they used (not too sweet and not too dry) we also got a sangria (which was pre made- nothing fancy here tasted like hi-c punch. We then ordered the hummus duo- great tasting and the veggies were fresh that accompanied this appetizer. I ordered the tavern ham omelette... delicious ham although I didn't taste much of the poblano peppers. We also got the  protein and iron dish. Simple and clean. Loved all The names of the dishes (very creative) on the menu and loved how this place is vegetarian and dog friendly. Would visit this spot again if I wake up in time..."}
{"text":"Nice, small patio with good service but food was mediocre.  Nachos were not warmed all the way through. Chicken skewers were passable. Bacon on burger was thick but not crispy, and I found the pretzel bun too dense to enjoy. Best food item at our table was the panko calamari. The portion seems generous until you eat a few and realize it's sitting on a bed of greens for some extra height.  Happy hour goes 'til 8 but their prices are not the best so I don't know if it's worth it."}
{"text":"What a delightful restaurant! Had the Reuben sandwich, which was served on toasted marbled Rye bread and  came with a side of polenta fries and two types of salsas. Im a big Reuben. fan, and this was excellent. Hubby had a ham and cheese omelette which he devoured within minutes. I usually don't like ordering coffee at restaurants because you never know what you're getting, however the coffee here was delicious, robust and freshly brewed, came in a large white cup and served extra piping hot as it should be. Our server, Keegan, was so attentive, professional and friendly, as were the host, bussers and the manager, John, who came by to check up on us. I will definitely be back for either breakfast or lunch. How could you not love a restaurant with good food and excellent service!"}
{"text":"This place is best for brunch when you want to keep last nights drinks flowing.  I have been here several times for that reason, and other times just for a healthy lunch.  The hangover breakfast is much more fun and they have great options to choose from  Breakfast nachos are by far the best to enjoy with a bloody mary.  They are everything bad for you that you shouldnt start your day with.  If you want less guilt, share them with a friend. But dont share with the whole table, the plate will easily disappear and you'll regret your generosity.  Ginger snap granola is so delish!! So tasty and flavorful! This isn't \"healthy\" -- so don't tell yourself it is.  If you want healthy, they have some egg white option omlettes that are pretty good, filling, and generous portions.  I only got one once because they are nothing too special compared to the rest of the fun menu.    Its fun to sit outside and watch the people walking by on Scottsdale road.  I've sat inside twice but outside is much more fun.  Their patio is dog friendly.    The service on weekend is slow --- be prepared to wait. They make the wait less painful with a coffee and water stand and nice chairs to sit on.  It is a common hangover breakfast spot, so the lines are full of some haggard looking zombies on saturday and sundays. However, its also a great place to meet with a group of people and enjoy a meal.  I've eaten dinner there twice. The menu for dinner is not my fave.  They do have great apps to share with friends, but to be honest, there are plenty of other places in the area at same price point that does a better dinner.  Stick with Daily Dose for breakfast or lunch, and you will have a happy full belly :) ...followed shortly by a nap."}
{"text":"Great great great breakfast food.. Very friendly service. The prices are very reasonable and overall it was a very good meal.. To the point where I had to come back again...  Not sure how many of you hit the same place 2x in 24 hours but I personally like to try different places and I couldn't resist coming back here 2x.."}
{"text":"Chicken enchiladas for a weekday lunch, sitting on the patio, fizzy lemon beverage.  I'd do it again for sure...course the nachos might be calling my name next time."}
{"text":"It doesn't matter what you choose you gonna have a feast! Food is consistently delicious and you got the beautiful crowd of the W I love this place if only those calories didn't count:-)"}
{"text":"Excellent service.  Excellent food.  Quaint outdoor patio.  Great size portions and extremely knowledgeable staff."}
{"text":"This place can never go wrong.  The owner is very witty and nice.  The menu can satisfy anyone's craving.  Portions are huge and the price is great!"}
{"text":"On a Sunday afternoon three of us went into Daily Dose for the first time. Checked reviews and they were pretty good.  Staff was friendly and we were seated on the patio as requested with only a short wait. Nice atmosphere and service. My daughter and I split the sirloin steak eggs Benedict with butternut squash as a side.  The eggs were very underdone that even the egg white were runny in spots. The sirloin steak was actually a little thicker than deli meat and had a very bland taste. When looking at the bottom of the meat there was a slight mother of pearl coloring. Squash was a lot like the potatoes-very bland. Did not complain to waiter."}
{"text":"I loved the peach creme brulee pancakes.  Every year that we come here, the pancakes always win.  It should be free if you can finish the meal, like if you can finish the massive steak at that steakhouse in the Texas panhandle."}
{"text":"I opted for the strawberry pancakes and sausage patties for early breakfast. Everything was really yummy and service was pretty quick! They have great outdoor seating and I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Have been here many times. We LOVE this place! Always manage to find a patio seat along Scottsdale Rd. to enjoy a glass of wine and inexpensive, yet crazy good dinner! The menu has MANY options, although, I have only had one thing. The same thing. EVERY SINGLE TIME! Why? Because I Love it so much. My husband has tried many things and has never been disappointed. I HAVE to have the three grain veggie burger. I MUST have it! A little salad on the side with the cilantro lime dressing and all is good with the world!  FANTASTIC!!! Friendly staff to boot!"}
{"text":"Even on the busiest Saturday I never have to wait more than 15 minutes to be seated. It's the perfect spot if you're looking for a laid back atmosphere and delicious food. I always get the southwest wrap, which is basically a lighter version of a breakfast burrito, its filling and I always have lunch left overs to bring home."}
{"text":"The cinnamon bun pancakes were amazing.  The butternut squash hash was also supper yummy.  The service was great.  Iced coffee the best."}
{"text":"I love the Daily Dose... moved from AZ months ago and have not found a place like this in my new home.  The menu offers something for anyone so it is a great place to take co-workers or a first date.  The food specials at Happy Hour will leave you full with money in your pocket.   The food is fresh non-traditional American fare.  My favorite is the Turkey Burger sub Blu Cheese Crumbles."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!!   Come early because you will wait for a delectable meal.  Portions are huge so bring your appetite."}
{"text":"Great service. Good food. Decent pricing.  No complaints."}
{"text":"Yum. We went for brunch on our first morning and sat on the patio. The menu had lots of really great items. B-friend selected the chorizo omelete which he loved, and I had the stuffed portobello which was also yummy. The espresso was great and mike could not get enough coffe; I finally had to stop him! Last thing I wanted was a wired partner at a car auction! Loved it and would definately go back."}
{"text":"At first walking up to this place I would have expected it to be so big inside. They do a very great job of using the layout at hand. Our server Jenien was very warming and welcoming as it was our first time here. We started off with the breakfast nachos and were amazed by their size.  After that I tried the turkey sausage white out which was not only amazing but also healthy! I'll be stoping back her again soon /)"}
{"text":"Always a fabulous time. I love the Mac n cheese same as the next girl but everything is pristine. Our waitress wasn't the most attentive but very sweet. The tables and aesthetic is to die for."}
{"text":"I can hear during my final brunch in Phoenix based on my uncle's recommendation.  The service was good, and the wait staff encouraged trying new food.  The squash hash did not disappoint.   It had great flavor and texture.  There was also a garlic sauce for my hash and turkey and spinach omelet, which was a fine touch.  The restaurant felt a bit crowded, but overall I would recommend it to others in the area."}
{"text":"I am from Denver where on Saturday mornings there is always a wait. We walked in and sat right down at a cozy booth next to the window. I was really impressed with the attention to detail in the food. Everything was gourmet! I had the best omelette I've ever had. It was fluffy and flavorful. I would definitely recommend the DD Hash. It is a breakfast style squash. How delicious! Even the jam for the toast was more like your grandmother's preserves than Smuckers. The service was also good, but nothing over the top. Next time I'm in Scottsdale, I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Great menu and great ambiance.  Coming for a trip from a small town the upscale look/vibe is fun to see.  The coffee was delicious, service great, and food excellent.  Eggs benedict was much better here than the Breakfast Club (according to my Husband) I had something a little healthier with fruit.  Portion sizes were generous.  We really enjoyed it here.  Well done!"}
{"text":"Daily Dose was great today.  I only have one complaint.  The staff was breathing too much and I was kinda weirded out by the air that above my breakfast.  It was about 1 inch from the top of the eggs to about 2 inches.  I can't really describe what was wrong but I looked up egg air online and these guys at daily dose obviously don't care about the two inches of egg air and its very apparent.  when I asked the server if I could have new air on over my eggs she was really nice and tried to put new air on them but it was impossible.  just like serving me.  impossible."}
{"text":"My top 3 breakfast/brunch places in old town Scottsdale.  If you haven't been here it's because it was too busy to get in or you you wanted to try something more corporate like village inn or Denny's.    This is Scottsdale breakfast/brunch at its best!  Very few restaurants are in the same echelon as this place.  A must go to for all you new snowbirds!  If this place doesn't make you come back every year then you should stay in the snow and cold."}
{"text":"The service was excellent and the food was amazing. I am glad I found this place during my visit to Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Consistently FABULOUS. This morning I sampled their Pumpkin Spice pancakes, accompanied by a THICK slab of their ham steak, two eggs sunnyside, a fresh fruit cup & SUPERB BLACK coffee...all served by the LOVELY Sylvia. LET THE DAY BEGIN !!"}
{"text":"Came for brunch at the Daily Dose and it did not disappoint. Located in the old town area of Scottsdale. Great for shopping and there were art galleries a plenty. Had a great time checking out the Joan Miro and Salvador Dali pieces. All the main stream artist you learn about in high school.   We had the Crabby cake omelet with potatoes and fruit. The omelet came with two nice size crab cakes. Way too much food but good and filling.  We also had the Lox omelet, which came with loads of smoked salmon. There is an option to choose the DD hash as a side. Do it!  Wonderful Autumn flavors, with roasted butternut squash and cremini mushrooms.  It was delicious!  Good prices. Creative drinks. Comforting food in a bustling place."}
{"text":"This is just about as good as it gets. Friendly, attentive staff, chic-but-not-snotty upscale atmosphere; great menu...and about a mile from my house, so I can walk there. Stopped in Saturday afternoon for some take-away chow. Syrina exemplifies outstanding service. Loved the Mahi Club. Very nice, Daily Dose!"}
{"text":"DD, you have redeemed yourself!  After my first nightmare experience at DD, I decided to give it another shot.  It was Friday night, Happy Hour with a party of 8, a recipe for disaster.  I called ahead and was delighted to hear they accepted reservations.  We were sat immediately upon arrival and greeted by our server shortly after.  If you've never been to DD, their Happy hour is awesome and runs until 8PM.   The HH menu has a little bit of everything including starters, entrees, salads, drinks, and burgers.   I started off with the mushroom and brie fondue and a hibiscus margarita. Both were excellent; I just wish they served it with more dipping items. It came with a few small slices of pretzel and a couple veggies, so I ended up with a bunch of fondue and a spoon!  Other starters ordered included a shrimp \"cocktail\", pretzels and crab cakes.  Those who ate them seemed very pleased as they disappeared quickly.   For dinner I went with the Veggie burger.  It was homemade and very tasty.  Unfortunately I had gorged myself in fondue so was unable to eat hardly any of it.   A few other burgers were ordered at the table, some tacos, a huge salad (Which was on HH too) and a couple orders of sliders. The sliders looked awesome; they were much bigger than any other slider I have ever seen.  My initial reaction was to upgrade my review to a 3, but after further consideration I've decided 4 stars is more appropriate considering the quality and price of the food."}
{"text":"Bomb. Came here 2 mornings in a row and got the smoked ham omelette and Southwest wrap (breakfast burrito). I was very tempted to get the French toast both mornings, but held off. They looked amazing, though. Next time! The wait staff was also very nice. Thanks guys!!"}
{"text":"Food was alright. I couldn't help but over hear the staff complaining about work/customers. I won't be going back."}
{"text":"um as far as brunch goes, it does not get better in scottsdale!! this place is so good...i have tried so many different things on the menu and all of them have been amazing. They are really good at making things unique which i love. I have taken many ppl here and everyone still talks about it! This is definitely one of my top 2 favorite brunch spots and the other one is in chicago, so go here if you are in the area, it is worth the wait"}
{"text":"If you want the BEST breakfast in the whole Phoenix area come to Daily Dose. Always a delight to eat their wonderful fresh food, friendly help for chat, and wonderful beers. We have been here several times throughout the year when traveling to Phoenix area and have NEVER been disappointed. Great food and inventive menu. A Taste Treat for your tongue."}
{"text":"I was in Scottsdale for only a week, and I ate at Daily Dose three times. That's how awesome it is. You have to try the breakfast nachos if you're there at the right time: Warm corn tortilla chips topped with mozzarella and cheddar cheese, jalapenos, chorizo scrambled eggs, pico de gallo and red chili cheese sauce. Served with a side of sausage gravy. I said I was on vacation. That included from my diet. I'll be dreaming of those tonight."}
{"text":"Good food....Yes, I like this place; I'll drop in for lunch when I'm in downtown Scottsdale and don't have time to drive over to Uncle Sal's.  Breakfast all day - much better than some of the \"breakfast\" restaurants in Phoenix."}
{"text":"This is the one best place for breakfast in Scottsdale Old Town.  Portions are large and well made.  Bacon is perfectly crisp - perfection.  Ate here several times during my 10 day stay and through the years have hit most the breakfast joints.  Others are efficient and capable - but this place is really good.  Not a fast food feel.   Try an omelette or the seasonal pancakes.  Wonderful."}
{"text":"Every time we visit Scottsdale we have to go to the Daily Dose for breakfast. The service is always exceptional and the food is consistently delicious. I have yet to find something I don't like on the menu. My boyfriend and I get the breakfast nachos every time which are a must try. There can be a wait most of the time but if you get there before 9 you can usually get right in. The wait is worth it and there is usually some of their delicious coffee out front that you can sip on while you wait. Definitely a restaurant to make sure you visit."}
{"text":"My wife and I stop here every time we are in the area for breakfast.  Nice to sit outside during nice weather"}
{"text":"I loved the DD hash. It looks potato based but there's a twist...it isn't :)"}
{"text":"Came here on Sunday around 10:30am and waited in line for a good 25 minutes (they don't take reservations). As we walked in, we noticed more than a handful of empty tables (likely due to the shortage of staff - just a wild guess). The three of us order multiple things to share including the Mac and cheese, pan cakes, banana bread, breakfast wrap as well as chorizo hash. The portions were great but I didn't think the food was all that good. Was not worth the 25 mins wait - just my opinion."}
{"text":"I'm a huge breakfast person, so when I'm going to grab food out, I always make sure where I'm going is going to be good. I love how big it is inside. You wouldn't think that from the outside but it certainly is! The service is always great and everyone is super friendly. So for the meal, I get the power bowl which is super healthy. I've also had their omelets which were good as well. The portions are pretty spot on. I would recommend everyone trying this out especially during the week because it's more quiet and you can sit down immensely. During the weekends it's pretty crowded as you can see clearly driving by. If you haven't had it, give it a try."}
{"text":"Great service even with a large group. The portion sizes are incredibly big and the food was amazing. I will split a meal the next time I go, which will be soon ."}
{"text":"Never going back again. I feel bad for the people waiting so long for a table, because they don't realize they just invested their time into waiting some more once they get seated. When we were seated , it took 10 minutes for a server to greet us, 20 minutes for our drink, and 30 minutes for our food to come.  I ordered the pulled chicken tacos which were so bland and uninspired. The chicken tasted like it was sitting out in the Arizona sun for days, it was so dry I couldn't even swallow it. I politely set my plate aside , and didn't make a scene.  The server comes back and notices I didn't like it , I said I didn't care for them and she walks away. Whoever is running this place doesn't know the first thing about running a restaurant.  Understaffed , lack of service , and overwhelmed with flustered servers, mediocre drinks , and overpriced garbage.  I would rather eat my breakfast at a grease spoon diner."}
{"text":"First try the cilatro, jalapeno, edamame hummus... Yum!  I have tried a few of their sandwiches on the menu and they were all really good.  Love the sweet potato fries... I think they might rival stax.  What I really want to come back for is breakfast!  That is absolutely my favorite meal of the day and their menu has some very yummy looking breakfast items to try.  Additionally their service is always friendly and attentive and their prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"Great food!! Love the cocktails they offer, kinda bummed they close at 9.. They would be good for a late drink. Breakfast food never a let down. The hangover burger is no joke!! Be hungry for that !"}
{"text":"Now they do breakfast and lunch all day!  As a person that isn't into breakfast food, this is now officially my favorite breakfast place!  That said, we still got a breakfast item - chorizo and jalapeno corn cakes w/ eggs over easy.  Be wary if you can't handle heat, but it was just perfect for me!  We also got the BIg stack and chorizo mac and cheese - these are now my favorite items on the lunch menu!  The prime rib sandwich was always good (named Big Stack) but the chorizo mac is new.  It looks like they've changed the menu quite a bit.  There's even several breakfast items I'd love to try one of these days.  Definitely recommend!  Update:  The big stack (prime rib sandwich) is getting worse and worse!  A month ago it was kind of bland but still good with au jus.  Last week it was super dry like jerky!  This used to be my favorite item on the menu but alas I'm going to try to find another."}
{"text":"It's always great to find a place that will accommodate my wife's vegan diet - even if nothing on the menu comes close. This is such a place. The ever attentive waitress and my wife crafted a wonderful dish from various areas of the menu into a challenge for the chef - a challenge he met with flying colors. Oh, and my smoked salmon Benedict was right off the menu and delicious. A great experience!"}
{"text":"Food is good but it should be avoided during spring training. Wait times are often over 1 hour."}
{"text":"Very nice breakfast place. Fairly busy due to location.  (you'll probably run into a lot of tourist) Everyone in the party liked the food.  I did a little of sampling from other plates, and it was good."}
{"text":"Solid food always. Service a hit or miss. And pass on the bloody Mary's. Healthy choices are always delicious and fresh."}
{"text":"Yelp reviews win again!! Made an impromptu stop in Scottsdale during a turnaround and reached out to yelp for a breakfast suggestion. We arrived to find a really cute location with a great outdoor eating area. We were seated within minutes and the service was great. But what happened next was magical! My plate of breakfast nachos arrived and I think I heard choir singing and saw light coming down from the heavens. This was the best, weirdest, most wonderful mixture of food I've ever put in my mouth. Foodgasm!!! I know I was moaning by the stares I was getting and I didn't care. Oh I need to mention the biscuits and gravy are also AMAZiNG, but those nachos!! Seriously would make the trip out from Los Angeles for these alone."}
{"text":"Let me start that hands down this spot for breakfast is the best in town and my go to for classic breakfast dishes.    The location is right in the heart of Old Town Scottsdale and is very easy to find. There is parking on the street and a few parking spots that are not too far, but I usually go early for breakfast, so this may not be the case later on in the day when its far hotter during the AZ summer.   The spot has plenty of seating, including some outside and a bar.  There are tables and booths and its nice yet very casual.   For less than $15 (which includes a non-alcoholic bev, I usualy get coffee--it's very yummy here and you can grab one while you wait and even ask for one to go). I am a fan of the omelettes and really like the veggie, turkey, capreses and steak. To be honest I haven't tried one I don't like. The acorn squash hash is so sweet and savory served with an herbed creme fraiche--I ALWAYS get it instead of the potatoes (however, my guests LOVE them, I am a bigger fan of squash). The breakfasts are HUGE, like really generous.  The eggs come with hash, a small bowl of fruit and a side of bread, which can be a biscut or bagel. They have an amazing kids menu as well filled with real food for the kiddos.  The hosts and staff have always been so sweet to my toddler daughter and any guests I bring with. They serve alcohol as well, i don't think I've tried anything but the Bloody Marys look amazing.   They've never let me down, so I'll keep heading over to this spot for breakfast. If you are in the area, I encourgage you to try it too!"}
{"text":"What the heck happened to this place?   I haven't been here in a while and the service has gone down.    The lady at the front door has had her brain removed.     Service was terrible and it wasn't even busy. . Immediately after placing our order the server started telling us why it was going to take longer than normal.  Really ?   Excuses and the order wasn't even in yet.    Practically had to choke to get more water.      Food was pretty good but not outstanding.   The question is ..   With so many great places in Old Town is this place worth putting up with terrible service to get so so food?  Probably not in my opinion."}
{"text":"After working at a busy breakfast spot, I know there is competition out there!  However, Daily Dose sets the bar.  Their breakfast is always hot, fresh, and delicious!  I recommend this spot to everyone!! Yum!"}
{"text":"Yes, I can see why Daily Dose is so popular - from the wait area with free coffee and lounge chairs to the warm interiors and home style cooking - this place has a great vibe. I tried the corn beef hash, the turkey sausage Benedict and the pancakes with berries. All three items were delicious as was my Bacon Bloody Mary.  The presentation matched the homey feel but could have used a little more elegance.  Food a tiny bit on the heavy side."}
{"text":"I love the Daily Dose!  The owner is there all the time and goes to all the tables to see if everyone is doing well and happy.  She's really nice.  I love the salads and hamburgers, the sweet potatoes fries are the best.  I also love the wraps.  Their bacon is amazing.  The atmosphere is very friendly and the place is super clean!"}
{"text":"I went to Daily Dose on a Saturday. There were plenty of empty tables inside, but my friend and I decided to wait for a table on the patio. The hostess was efficient seating us once a table became available. I had the veggie burger. I told the waitress I couldn't decide between sweet potato fries and regular fries. She suggested I get the combo, which is offered on the lunch menu, not the dinner menu. I thought that was nice of her, since I wouldn't have known about it otherwise. I can't wait to go back and try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"I had a good time there, the brunch was good, was fun and it was a lil different. the service was not so bad. it is kind of small, so we had to wait 25 mnts for our table. they should have a bigger waiting room than that little room that fits 5 people. i would go back, just earlier. again good breakfast big, u can even share it HA, the food tasted fresh, the juice was maybe fresh squeezed..... sure will be back .!!"}
{"text":"Highly recommend! Great, friendly service. AMAZING banana bread french toast. Wide variety of food choices."}
{"text":"We first tried Daily Dose a few years ago, liked the menu and loved the food. But as time passed, the restaurant has become the epitome of mediocre. We tried it again a few days ago and though it was not busy the server...while fairly attentive...forgot a drink order. More importantly, the food was bland, bland, bland. The description of the corned beef hash seemed great, but it was tasteless. And the \"over easy\" egg arrived crispy (i.e., waaay overcooked).   The biscuits and gravy was strangely sweet, no taste of sausage and...bland. The coffee tasted like the pot hadn't been cleaned in weeks.   None of us will ever go back."}
{"text":"Somehow I had never heard of this place until Saturday so I had no idea what to expect.  We had a giant party of 9 people so it took a while to get seated, but after that everything ran surprisingly well considering the size of the group.  The food came pretty fast and my diet coke was never empty.  Our waitress/servers were all excellent.  Because I read some Yelp reviews before my visit, I was pretty confident that the burger was a good choice.  I ordered \"The Gladiator\" and it was excellent.  The toppings, meat and bun were all top notch, fresh and tasty tasty and I would definitely order it again.  I only had a bite or 2 with the delicious pretzel bun so it made sense in my head to order the fries.  I ordered the combo fries which are half regular and half sweet potato.  I didn't really like them and would order another side in the future like the hash which sounds interesting.  Anyway, the fries were crispy on the outside and soft on the inside and not overly greasy, but I think they lacked flavor.  After tasting their burger and studying their menu I can't wait to go back.  Their breakfast menu has TONS of things that look awesomely delicious and can't wait to try them.  I just wish this place was in a different/larger location because I could tell that the place gets jam packed in the morning and I bet the parking is a pain."}
{"text":"Decent food - not AMAZING. Very generic breakfast café. I would say the staff was very attentive and made the experience. If I ever return to Scottsdale probably would opt for the competition."}
{"text":"Even though  the Daily Dose (aka the Double D), just opened, I've been there twice already. This is a new breakfast-and-more place from Matt and JenLynn Long. I'm a big fan of their other restaurant - Fusion - and of breakfast, so of course I was very excited when the doors finally opened in late October.  They have created a beautiful space right in the heart of the Downtown Scottsdale action. The patio looks out on the main drag and on my first visit we could have sat out there watching all the amazing women walking in the breast cancer 3-day walk.  Instead we ate inside which was quietly removed from the on-the-street action. The table tops of polished stones were like sitting next to a beach in Florida, and the games were on the bar TVs so my friend was happy.  Breakfast was excellent. I had an omlette made with three eggs - just the right size for me. I hate wasting those five egg monsters at other places. It came with a choice of \"potatoes.\" I chose a hash made with squash and mushrooms.  It was similar to eating sweet potatoes. Breakfast also came with fresh fruit.   My friend appropriately had the Hangover Sandwich with turkey sausage, bacon, and jalapeños. He wasn't head-over-heels about it,  but hey - he was hungover. All entrees seem to be in the $7.95-$9.95 price range with the seafood add ins like crab costing a little more.  On my second visit I stopped in mid-day for a snack and to check my email. Yes, this place has Wi-Fi!  Unfortunately, they don't really have a \"snack\" menu yet. I opted for Chips, Salsa & Guac ($4.95). it was a warm green salsa to die for, fresh guacamole, and a mound of chips. I wish I had other people to share with.  Daily Dose just got their liquor license and is opening for dinner as well. I suspect they will add happy hour and happy hour style apps very soon. When that happens, look for me and my computer in the corner."}
{"text":"Another breakfast spot in old town found!  I had previously walked by here late at night whilst inebriated on the way to the Beverly and wondered what it was and then again passed by during the day when I saw people inside.  Checked it out and found out it was breakfast.  You walk in and are greeted by the full bar with TVs, but that's the only spot if desiring to watch football during brunch that I'd encourage sitting at.  Although we were sat in a corner, we were forgotten about.  I ordered the Chorizo omelette and had poblanos replace the jalapenos, ordered the DD hash and potatoes...probably too many carbs but completely delicious.  My girlfriend ordered a bagel sandwich, it was good, I get to requisition samples of her food for my own judgements!  Our server was awesome, as I said we were not forgotten, my coffee and water was filled most of the time, to the point I wish he'd been a bit slower."}
{"text":"Whenever I visit Phoenix I always have to come to daily dose. Lunch was fabulous. Didn't realize they no longer have the amazing happy hour that they used to. Very disappointed in that. Food was still great"}
{"text":"Had to update my review and lower the stars... recently had a meal here with some friends and I recall getting a military discount in the past. I asked if I could get the discount and was told that I have to be in uniform... I thought they were joking, and the server asked the manager on duty to make sure. She arrived at our table to confirm that's their policy and with an attitude she said \"well, no one has ever complained about this before\". No one was complaining. We just asked about it. In my opinion, it's a silly policy, but I wasn't complaining."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast in Old Town Scottsdale!  The Eggs Benedict with turkey sausage was delicious!  We had to wait about 30 minutes for a table, but it is well worth the wait.  The service is friendly and efficient and the restaurant has a good vibe."}
{"text":"Very happy with our meals and service on a busy Sunday. We arrived and were told it would be about 20 minutes but it was 10. I had the bacon eggs Benedict, my daughter had the breakfast sandwich and my husband had the omelette. Would definitely go again."}
{"text":"I had the smoked salmon on a egg white omelet.  Staff nice, ambiance fantastic, easy parking, prices comparable to downtown Scottsdale.  My drink was kinda week, but I would return for sure."}
{"text":"Daily Dose is exactly what I expected being in Downtown Scottsdale. It is a cute, trendy, busy, small establishment packed with lots of patrons with Gucci bags slung over their arms and cute little designer sun dresses on their backs.    The waitress we had was not rude but could definitely have been friendlier. We took about 20 minutes to order, so that could have been a reason for her rudeness. But, I didn't see her smile once.   The food was ok. Not really anything to write home about and the Sunday special of Sangria was very watered down.   I will probably go back again because it is a great spot to go and have Sunday brunch with the girls- but it wont be my 1st choice."}
{"text":"Very great food and service here at Daily Dose. I got a turkey sausage omelet which comes with potatoes, toast, and a side. I chose fruit and added on cottage cheese. I also got fresh squeezed orange juice as well. Everything was deep down delicious! The waitress Stephanie was phenomenal, and super friendly! Highly suggest requesting her to be your waitress. We sat on a cute patio outside while we ate brunch. Only thing I could complain about is it is a little higher priced. Overall, I would return but not daily due to price."}
{"text":"Once again I feel as though fellow yelpers are peer pressured into following a five star trend. I'm not.   Honestly, sure, this breakfast spot is good...but did it blow my socks off? Not at all.   My scrambled eggs were not scrambled. They were more like fluffed, folded, and served on a plate. The waffle had a bit of a tree bark taste, less than sweet, and my toast was cold so the butter I spread didn't even melt.   However, our service was stellar, she was on it, (minus the smell of her smoke break that lingered as she passed by) I also really appreciated her splitting the checks each way for our large party of six.   Sure, it's good breakfast. But is it \"omg amazing\" and worth the long Saturday morning wait? No."}
{"text":"Went here with my 2-year-old daughter while we were waiting for a park to open up.  Food and service were incredible with very fresh ingredients and the best part of all was feeling like I was in a normal place and not a \"kid-friendly\" restaurant.  Excellent kids menu and attentiveness but adults can come and relax too.  Very well done."}
{"text":"This was a good breakfast stop. I ordered the meat and cheese omelette, which had a few meats along with smoked gouda. Delicious. On the side was a generous portion of potatoes and a cup of fruit, along with toast.  The food was cooked very nicely, and the smoked gouda was the perfect flavor to go along with the rest of the plate.  Just make sure you bring your apetite, since you'll get a lot of food."}
{"text":"Food was good, nice atmosphere. The portions were really small, they must be fighting obesity or something."}
{"text":"great food, even greater happy hour prices!   check out their website for all the info."}
{"text":"Great menu and excellent food! On Sunday morning it was a full house so Service is a tad slow but you did not feel rushed."}
{"text":"The Daily Dose is my favorite breakfast spot in Old Town. I've probably tried half a dozen different things from their menu by now and they have all been great, from the big omelettes to the amazing breakfast burger. Service is always excellent, and even when they are busy the wait never takes too long. Breakfast here is a must for me on any Scottsdale visit."}
{"text":"After reading reviews about this restaurant my daughter and I decided to try it for breakfast. Our breakfast entrees were good but nothing special. I ordered their banana french toast and my daughter had a waffle topped with strawberries. Both of our breakfasts came with a small side bowl of fruit.  My banana french toast was several slices of think chuncky banana bread topped with sliced banana. It was good but I did not think it was fabulous."}
{"text":"My husband and I LOVE Daily Dose!!  First of all the food is consistently great and they always put a creative and delicious twist in their dishes.  The mac & cheese is amazing!  The pretzel twists, the salads, and the tacos are all fabulous!  We also like supporting family owned businesses. The owner is very conscientious and is always on the floor taking care of customers.  The service was questioned  with other reviews, however they must have corrected it because we have always had good service."}
{"text":"It was decent except I found a hair in my food. Notified the waitress and my food was replaced. Not many people want to eat after finding a hair in their food. The bill came and I thought maybe they would comp that part of the meal... Nope!"}
{"text":"I've been here for all three meals, tried three different things and while the atmosphere is nice, the food is very average."}
{"text":"Incredible breakfast here. Even though it was 80 degrees, I sat on the patio on a high table and an umbrella. Service was good except the female manager spent waaay too much time at the table next to me. I had the impression that she was the girlfriend of the handsome gentleman sitting there or wanted to be. Aside from her presence, the atmosphere was quite pleasant. Ignoring all that, the breakfast was great and the portions were huge."}
{"text":"Rating: 2.25 Stars. Almost...but not quite there.  What I Liked: Tremendous upside to this place. The food has potential based on the quality of ingredients...but the overall execution wasn't all that good (yet). The service was friendly too.  Room For Improvement: They need more contrast of flavors in their dishes. A heat to go with the sweet. And/or fresh to compliment the rich. I ordered the Hangover sandwich and it was all rich (with no fresh element in the sandwich to counteract) and mostly sweet-tasting (with no heat to offset it). So, it really seemed lackluster to me. Also, the eggs were overcooked. Oh, and a mist-machine for dining outside would be nice too.  Overall: I wish this place well, but there are just too many other options out there for me to be back to Daily Dose."}
{"text":"This restaurant fits in nicely with Scottsdale's cutlure.  It is slightly yuppie with its menu options.  Very small, so you will have to wait to get seated.  The offerings on the menu were different from that of those breakfast locations iin the state.  They had butternut hash squash as a side.  If you are not accustomed to this,you may not care for it.  The fruit cups were great, packed full of fresh fruits.  The fried Potato's had the same taste as any other place I have tried, still good though. We had to wait a long period to get our coffee refilled and to get the check.  Overall the service was great in the beginning, as they did not want us to freeze (being by the patio door, only location open) which was helpful.  We were expecting exceptional for Scottsdale but got \"okay\" service."}
{"text":"It's been about a year and a half since our visit to Daily Dose and my husband still occasionally talks about how good the bloody mary was!  I can't believe I forgot to mention it in my original review. We haven't been back to Scottsdale since this visit, but I'm sure it will be on the must-do list during our next trip."}
{"text":"Thanks to Donald and Carin for sponsoring this wonderful event! Just got back and it was a lot of fun. Great food and drink not to mention the company - shoutouts to Jim and Kevin ...   I also commend the waitstaff highly for their friendliness and extreme competence in handling the many and varied orders of 25+ people with grace and efficiency.  Just as a side note, I was also taken with the (XTREME?) hand dryers in the bathroom, which told me at the spout to FEEL THE POWER  That about says it all.  Thanks again and best wishes for the season!"}
{"text":"Great place to grab lunch. We walked in on a Thursday afternoon and were seated in less than 10 minutes, and that's awesome because this place is always packed. The hostess was very pleasant and took our drink orders right away. Our waitress was at our table to greet us in less than two minutes and kept coming back to make sure our drinks were filled and that we were enjoying our meals...and she was very cute! The food was great; Black Forest Ham Omelette for my sister, basic eggs and bacon for brother-in-law, and I had Prime Rib sandwich with au jus. Very delicious! Will come back for sure!!!"}
{"text":"If you're from out of town and looking for a great breakfast spot look no further.  There are atleast 10 things on the menu that I would like to try.  The tostada eggs Benedict was amazing but I hear the breakfast nachos is where it's at."}
{"text":"Yummmmm ... Fabulous! Ordered the meat & cheese omelet the and it was awesome ... complex flavors ... delicious!  Our server, Robbie was fab! Check out my 'glass' of champagne ... this place rocks!"}
{"text":"I will never say no to Daily Dose! The menu choices are broad and everything tastes fresh. I've had the Strawberry Creme Brule Belgian Waffles, Breakfast Nachos, Biscuits & Gravy, and Three Grain Veggie Burger (on a pretzel bun, yumm) and all are amazing!  They do have healthier options as well. ;) Just be prepared for.........the wait. Especially on the weekends. You have to really want it, and not be too hungry, to go on a weekend morning. At least for the one in Old Town. But it's worth it!!!"}
{"text":"I ordered the blue ginger French toast and it totally blew my mind! I normally try to stick to a paleo diet but will break it for special occasions. Well, as soon as I saw it on the menu, I knew I had to try it.  Wonderful pretzel bread with blueberries and ginger granola. I had a side of cottage cheese which I paired with their hot sauce which I found to be very flavorful but not too hot.  I have no regrets and will be back again to try some of the other delicious looking items on the menu!"}
{"text":"Not bad but definitely not as highly rated as the Yelp average.  More of a bar than breakfast spot.   Fruit was not super fresh or ripe.  Coffee decent and menu had some Paleo friendly options."}
{"text":"Awesome food, healthy choices, unique menu items, I had the tempeh burrito tasted great. Cool atmosphere."}
{"text":"Boom in my belly!!! The hangover sammich was awesome and my wife's crab bennedict was delicious...super friendly staff and our waitress Nicolle was quick and friendly!! We live in Mesa but we will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Good ol' happy hour what better way to get a great deal on fine appetizers.  At 1/2 priced appetizer and lasting until 8 I just had to stop in and try it.  After a quick glance of the menu two items popped out at me for different reasons. The Nachos (w/o chicken)  this was the few drinks in half of my brain talking and the Risotto cakes from my foodie soul.  While we waited for our food I enjoyed the 3d look of the rocks in acrylic tables and contemporary decorations.  Our food arrived, and it looked good, but the cheese on the nachos had already cooled and had time to solidify and the pico de gallo was quickly making the chips soggy. The flavors ere good but it would have been much better if it got to us sooner.  The risotto cakes also had a great taste, but they were luke warm too, they were served on a nice bed of greens with a balsamic dressing.  With just a bit more care this place could be good, they have many specials and a decent menu, but the kitchen and or service hurts the overall experience."}
{"text":"Visited Daily Dose this week.  Best breakfast spot in a long time.  The portion size was worth the price.  The Hangover Sandwich was awesome and enough to share.  The Griddle Cakes (pancakes) were good too."}
{"text":"I really liked this place, was my first time here.  Really friendly staff and service, I ordered the steak salad, really tasty dressing and good sized portion.  Will definitely return."}
{"text":"I've never beebread disappointed in my many visits. My favorite old town diner :)"}
{"text":"Absolute FAVORITE breakfast spot in Old Town Scottsdale. The food is great, service is wonderful. Try the black forest ham omelet--my favorite thing so far. Every waitress that we've had has been so attentive. Every outrageous request that we've made has been done. If there's a line when you get there, it's worth the wait."}
{"text":"Are here with my girlfriend as we were looking for a new breakfast spot. Great patio to enjoy the weather. Fresh fruit was just that. A bit on the carb heavy side for my taste but in retrospect awesome for a hangover. Good food."}
{"text":"The blueberry banana pancakes were great. Three fluffy cakes was a lot of food. Two pancakes were plenty. The Naked French Toast is made with pretzel Texas toast--pretty darn tasty. The Southwest Wrap was nothing memorable, as were the potatoes and squash mash. While most of the food is outstanding, there are a few blah dishes that surface every now and then.   The service is always top-notch here, everyone works as a team and is happy to accommodate any requests, which always makes for a great dining experience breakfast and lunch."}
{"text":"Breakfast was good. 2 people eating. 1.pretzel French toast delicious. 2.white egg omelet with mushroom & spinach. Kelsey did a good job, Very friendly. Though the young millennial Male manager advised me that I could not take the free coffee from lobby to my table... Really. Even though my water craft had a fly in it. Mellow out dude."}
{"text":"Delicious breakfast spot in the heart of Old Town Scottsdale! The wait wasn't bad at all, especially given that it was Saturday around 10AM! Bloody Mary's were good, pretty standard. The Eggs Benedict was delicious, and you can substitute a homemade fresh biscuit which really adds to the experience. The Strawberry Creme Brûlée French toast was delicious, piled high with fresh strawberries and the sauce was not too overwhelming. Their house herb potatoes were delightful! The service was great, answering all our questions, and wasn't afraid to suggest items on the menu which I always enjoy!"}
{"text":"Fantastic breakfast spot!!! I love the waffles and mimosas!! Not to long of a wait, the staff was extremely helpful and offered suggestions that turned out great! I had a great brunch with my girls I would absolutely recommend the spot"}
{"text":"I regretfully post a 1 star review for what used to be one of my favorite breakfast places. Called to order protein pancakes for a pick up. I was given a choice of 3 different sides (hash, cottage cheese, or fruit).  None of those sounded appealing so I requested 2 eggs as a replacement. I was told that they wouldn't do a substitution and I had to choose between the 3 options because eggs were more expensive. Eggs are not more expensive (according to their menu) which I immediately pointed out,  but there was no budging the person who was taking my order. I had to take 1 of the 3 options and make a separate side order for what I wanted (eggs or bacon) even though they had a lower menu price.  I said \"thanks but no-thanks\" and hung up the phone. Never again."}
{"text":"This restaurant defiantly makes it into my top 10. I have been here around 3-4 total and every time I come in the customer service here blows my mind. Every employee is very attentive on taking care of not only their table but every customer. Not only does our server check up on us regularly, so do other servers walking by.... It is very wonderful! The food is great and I will continue to come back! Thank you for late breakfast!"}
{"text":"Originally, I wanted to meet a friend at another restaurant, but they were under construction, so Daily Dose (DD) showed up on yelp nearby and we thought we would give it a try. So glad we found it! Our cocktails were delicious - and there were plenty of specialty cocktails! I had a bagel sandwich that had bacon, eggs, tomato, etc. I don't remember what DD called it, but it was delicious. The bagel was soft, making it easy to keep it as a sandwich instead of a bagel with breakfast falling out of it. So good! My friend got rancheros. She was quite pleased with the twist they had on it - and I can tell you it looked delicious! Not only was everything tasty, but the food came out so faster than it took me to decide what I wanted to eat!  I'd definitely like to go back some time, as all of the food that I saw coming out looked and smelled quite tasty!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Contrary to lines, I've never waited longer than ten minutes to be seated. I can't say too much for the entire menu because I'm so in love with the protein pancakes that they're the only thing I will order. Amazing!! The parking isn't the best because it's a lot behind it that's usually packed on Saturdays, but we've always been able to find a spot."}
{"text":"What a come down! I've been to the Daily Dose quite a few times and have always had a pretty good experience but not this last time. Food was a mixed bag. Our favorite, Chorizo Mac and Cheese, was great and the pretzels were good, although we had to send them back because they did not come as requested, with butter and salt. My son's turkey burger was tasteless and dry. I ordered one chorizo taco, usually a fave, which came cold. Not just room temperature cold, but cold like just out of the fridge cold. The waitress was incredibly rude. We made several requests for plates so that we could share the food which had already been served without success. Finally, I asked the waitress for plates and she replied, \"The bus boy does that\" and walked away. I complained to the manager who did respond very well, pleasant and offering to comp the mac and cheese, but the waitress spent the rest of the evening giving us dirty looks and avoiding our table. What happened to professionalism? It was my son's last meal in the US before leaving for overseas and he had been so looking forward to it. What a disappointment."}
{"text":"their happy hour is great because it goes until 8pm, way later then most other places. They also have a great happy hour selection and good prices. Their chicken nachos are great and gigantic! The turkey burger and sweet potato fries are also really good. Good prices for drinks as well"}
{"text":"Visited for breakfast around 9:30 on a Thursday.  We parked in the Starbucks parking lot, not sure if they actually have a designated parking area. I ordered the southwest wrap and my husband ordered the steak bowl. Both were amazing, and the portions were large. We could have shared either meal between the two of us. We'll be back, I would love to try some of the other speciality items on the menu."}
{"text":"Meh... precisely. Nice location, outdoor seating, and friendly staff. Mediocre American food. Best thing, it serves breakfast till 3 or 4pm. Basic basic American food with no twist."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed a happy hour at this joint last week. The bellini was delicious and refreshing. I loved the fish tacos (available in grilled or fried)- I had the grilled and was definitely satisfied. The happy hour lasts until 8pm! I noticed a few vegetarian options, or other menu options that could be modified. The veggie pot pie is something I will probably try next time, but I'll probably make sure I'm not the DD so I can have another bellini! The atmosphere is laid back and pleasant- we sat outside. The service was good, the food was good, the price was good. I'll be back soon."}
{"text":"The turkey burger is a house special, but this visit so-so. The sliders looked better, so maybe I had slider envy. Small place and decent service.  Inexpensive, but parking is an adventure."}
{"text":"Absolutely AMAZING every single time we go!!  If you're from out of town this place is a MUST!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered the 2 egg breakfast with gluten free cinnamon roll pancakes and 2 eggs over medium plus. Eggs came out runny. Whites not even cooked. Asked the waitress for new eggs with the whites fully cooked. Her quote... \"You can have medium or hard. \"They can NEVER get it right. You can get over easy or over hard. Nothing in between. Too many choices in Scottsdale to come back here for bad service and eggs. The pancakes were burned too. Yuck"}
{"text":"I absolutely love the Daily Dose! The staff is very attentive and they check on you just at the right time, not to mention the incredible food that is filled with the upmost color and flavor combined. I definitely recommend this restaurant ..vegetarian option for breakfast is vast and delicious..hope you enjoy it as much as my husband and 2 girls.."}
{"text":"My wife and I have visited this place a few times now and every time I am so impressed. Such a wonderful selection of food, the atmosphere is comfortable and the customer service is fantastic. I have ordered both a steak and burger cooked medium and both times they were cooked to perfection. The ribs are to die for as they are tender and juicy with a very unique sauce. The beer selection is really good, with craft beers from here and afar. I really can not say enough good things about this place, get out and try it for yourself!"}
{"text":"Love this place. My wife and I discovered The Daily Dose several years back.   The omelets are so good. The chorizo is my favorite and I know it is sponsored by local cardiologists.  Job security. But since we hike Pinnacle Peak before brunch here we are safe!  And speaking of mountains, try the pancakes.   Great coffee served in a bowl.  The servers are on top of it.   Each spring break we look forward to Daily Dose in The Valley of the Sun."}
{"text":"Come here every time when I'm in town. Best breakfast in town. Must try, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"A little place I would like to call Heaven!   Daily Dose is amazing. Daily Dose makes me want to be a better person... The consistency of being wonderful every time I go is what brings me back! I have never once had a bad experience there. Friendly, warm, inviting atmosphere & amazing food. I could eat breakfast, lunch & dinner there every day.....   Let's talk about what makes them so great... I know - you want details....  Well to start homemade warm giant pretzels is a go-to every time. Especially during happy hour.   Chicken nachos...... no brainer.... $5 during happy hour and know what's even better DD is extending their happy hour for the summer 4p - till CLOSE!   My go-to is Cobb Salad with a veggie patty on top - dressing on the side please.... The salad is huge! Filled with fresh lettuce, tomato, crispy bacon, egg, etc.. The veggie patty homemade - warm - breaks apart with every bite! Just delicious. If I was on death rode I would choose DD to fill me with my last meal. WHY? Because the fresh, homemade food will definitely bring a smile to your face even if your about to die!   Thank you DD for making life so good...."}
{"text":"The banana bread French toast and hangover sandwich to die for.  Bloody Mary too are Excellent"}
{"text":"Had breakfast every day here when in in town for spring training. Amazing food and wonderful service!! The almond maple french toast is to die for if you like sweet. Try the southwest wrap. Super yum. Cant go wrong with all the egg dishes and the bowls."}
{"text":"I swear, I want to love this place. Really. It's next to one of the best dress shops ever (Robert Black, you rock my world!) and their strawberry mint salad is HEAVEN. But I'm telling you--their service SUCKS! I've been there three times in the past 5 months and no matter how many times I try to ignore and avoid the incompetent boob behind the bar (Jonathan), it never works out. He's young and a terrible server/bartender. The first time I went, my date and I never got drink refills OR our orders. The second time, the guy literally couldn't be bothered with replenishing my mimosa--he was too busy talking to friends. Today, I thought I had the problem solved. I sat at a table outside the bar. But when my drink order hadn't even been taken after sitting at the table for over 5 minutes, I asked someone for help. And who do you suppose was supposed to be helping me but hadn't bothered to make his way over? Of course the guy I had been trying to avoid! It was like something out of a bad movie. I should have known when I had to beg for a drink. If you can avoid Jonathan, the salad is totally worth it."}
{"text":"The menu is amazing. Every time I have visited there is usually a wait but it really doesn't take long to get a spot. The menu selection will have something for everyone. The service is friendly and the food is nom."}
{"text":"Loved everything about the Daily Dose. It's quite big inside and has great food and service.  Spinach salad with chicken or salmon were both delicious. Next time I'm trying the Bloody Mary that I saw plenty of. Looked like a big hit!   The wait for brunch was short and there is free coffee or iced tea while you wait."}
{"text":"Well, I feel dumb.  So finally, after 28 years of living (or visiting) in Arizona, I venture to Daily Dose to meet a friend for breakfast on a Friday. Why did it take so long you ask? Well, I'm not for waiting in line for an hour for breakfast on the weekends.  I'm not really a fan (I'd rather eat lunch or dinner options) of breakfast and can't justify waiting that long. Anyhow, my fiend's schedule and mine happened to align where we could meet for breakfast and I suggested this spot cause I knew it would probably be the only time I would be able to walk right in. I picked a spot on one of the four high top tables outside and ordered a cafe caramel ($4.25) while I waited for my friend. The waitress brought me a water while I waited for my drink to be made and it came with a cucumber in it! I love cucumber water! A few minutes later and my coffee came out and it was super delicious! My friend showed up, looked at my drink and decided in a cappuccino, that she says was really tasty as well.   For our entree, we decided to split the Smokey stuffed portabella mushroom that is stuffed with egg whites, roasted red pepper, and smoked gouda. Yes, I said smoked gouda!! It's served with fresh fruit and toast. We asked our super friendly waitress what we could get besides the toast and she started to tell us we could get cottage cheese, potatoes, or a sweet potato hash that has grilled onions. We opted for the sweet potatoe hash, like I'm sure you, dear reader, would have chosen. We also decided to split the Strawberry ginger snap granola and ordered an extra two egg whites .   Oh my freaking gawd! Everything was so incredibly delicious, my friend and I couldn't stop talking about what idiots we were for not trying this place out sooner. The total for everything, and it was a lot of food that we couldn't even finish, was $31.00! What the bleep? All that delicious food and drinks for $31! This is the best place ever and I would so wait for 30-45 minutes (but not an hour) to eat here again. Everything on the menu looked delicious and it will be hard not to order what I had because it was so good, but I'm excitied to try out the other options,  So thank you Daily Dose for making me feel like dumbass. Can't wait until we meet again!"}
{"text":"Came in late morning on a Thursday, no wait but good crowd. Had the Crispy Polenta/Roasted Poblano/Poached Egg, with the DD Hash. VERY good. I wish I could toast poblanos like that, and the crispy polenta was in little squares of yumminess. Lastly the cheese sauce was delish. Would go again!"}
{"text":"Hit up this place with some friends from out of town. Great place to recharge for brunch after a night out in Old Town. I had the turkey sausage omelette which was delicious - the side of turkey sausage gravy gave it a nice kick. Great happy hour too, but I haven't been here yet for that."}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast Menu,showcasing unique ingredients from Mimosa's, seasonal beers and pancakes. My choice was:  \"The Hangover Sandwich\" Made with Peppered bacon, turkey sausage, cheddar cheese, caramelized jalapeno & onion, harissa aioli & one egg your way. Served on sourdough bread w/ herb potato & fruit. with 16oz. Samuel Adams Oktoberfest Beer! Furthermore,The Atmosphere was trendy comfortable for conversations while having a delicious meal. Finally the attractive servers are pleasant and responsive."}
{"text":"My friends & I went here for brunch twice now & the food was absolutely amazing & the price was fair for how much food we got! Definitely would recommend if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"great place! i love the breakfast nacho here very very unique but definitely very popular. they are also pet friendly so i bring my olde english bulldogges with me."}
{"text":"turkey burger tasty ice green tea yummy service was great friday half price on burgers! can't go wrong"}
{"text":"Nice little place with a wide variety of food on the menu. Sitting on the patio was awesome. The sliders were amazing and I would defiantly come back again."}
{"text":"Great, friendly service, wonderful bloody and great food-they nailed it!"}
{"text":"I had the southwest wrap which comes with chorizo and eggs, avocado and a side of pico de gallo, side of potatoes and bowl of fruit for $9.99.  My husband got the corned beef hash which came with 2 eggs any style and toast, also I believe for $9.99.  Both were delicious!"}
{"text":"Saw on the great reviews so I thought I'd give it a shot.  Walked in a no wait on July 4th,  sweet. The place very nice inside and a good patio area.  Service was pretty good. The food was ok, better than average but not as good as other Scottsdale or Phoenix eateries. I could see giving it another try some day but I'm in no hurry.   Probably deserves 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"went to old town to eat after a day of hiking out of town- hungry, tired.  the staff was great and we enjoyed sitting outside by the firepit and TV.  I asked 5 x to get the basketball game on the tv....as there was only ads on the tv at the moment and it took far to long to get the channel changed.  The food was average...not much flavor and the fish tacos were not flavorful at all.  With all the other places in Old Town, as well as Scottsdale, I will not go back"}
{"text":"After a Giants spring training game on a Friday afternoon my husband and I randomly came across this gem. They have a few patio tables, at the time they were full so we waited at the bar for one to open up.   Only about 10 minute wait we were seated. Ordered a few appetizers on the happy hour menu: crab cakes, chips with guacamole and salsa. The food was great, the staff were super friendly and accommodating.  We liked it so much we went again on Sunday."}
{"text":"Been here twice now for lunch. I am a huge Cesar salad fan. So I always get their Cesar. It is excellent! The perfect amount of cheese and dressing. I have always had very fast service and nice waiters. In addition, the location is perfect! It is in the center of downtown old Scottsdale. There is outdoor seating for a nice day. Ps- I have heard lots of great things about their protein pancakes!! I plan on trying them next time."}
{"text":"I came here for breakfast after working a LONG shift at the hospital and I have to say I really was not impressed.  The drink I ordered the \"Antioxidant\" seemed watered down and flavorless.  The hollandaise on my Eggs Benedict seemed watered down and flavorless.  Overall the food just seemed uninspired. Maybe it was just my crummy mood after such a long night. I'll have to go back and give them another try. Just in case..."}
{"text":"Consistently very good. I recommend getting the Protein & Iron or the Grilled Chicken Cobb sandwich. Skip the soups. They are pretty meh, and aren't worth the extra charge.  They always seem packed so arriving right at lunch time is hit or miss. The menu is huge, so no matter what you like, you will find something. Interestingly, service is a mixed bag. Some of their waiters/waitresses are very attentive and on the ball, others disappear and a manager figure fills in for them.   One thing that does impress me about this place, is the feedback they seek from their customers on basically every visit. There are two individuals, one woman and one man, that often visit and ask for honest feedback on the food and how our service has been so far. That's a good sign. I'm always for holding people accountable.   Try it out. It's never disappointing, price is what you'd pay anywhere else in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"This is quite possibly the best brunch spot I've ever been to.  The place is cool and modern, the service is friendly (and quite attractive), and the food is unbelievable.    I had a chorizo omelet which was delightfully fluffy and stuffed not-quite-to-the-gills but just enough with picante chorizo, melty cheddar and red onion.  This omelet was amazing!  But it was not to be outdone by its accoutrements.  They serve it up with sauteed herbed potatoes that are perfectly seasoned and browned, and were some of the best breakfast potatoes I've ever had.  The toast is thick cut and deliciously buttered.  And the side of guacamole was full of rich avocado chunks and a hint of citrus.  But what really blew me away was the house creation of rosemary creme fraiche, an accompaniment that was the perfect complement to everything else on the plate.  Rosemary creme fraiche on your omelet?  Definitely.  Rosemary creme fraiche as a dipper for herbed potatoes?  Damn straight.    I am literally devastated that this place is almost 2000 miles from where I live.  Otherwise they would have a new best customer."}
{"text":"Excellent food and Bloody Marys, friendly service, reasonable prices, friendly locals...doesn't get any better!"}
{"text":"I came here on a very quiet summer morning and without question the menu for breakfast/ brunch is still amazing however the service is not impressive at all!   In the summer in Scottsdale water should be served to you automatically. You shouldn't have to ask after your order has come out.  Additionally I was not given sugar with my coffee and had to ask and got attitude. Then had to ask for hot sauce with my omelette and got attitude. Huh? I will hope my waitress was just having a bad morning but when they can be so great when busy it's disappointing to get bad service when empty."}
{"text":"Hangover sandwich is delicious and especially mouthwatering if you've had a night of drinking. Jalapeños and caramelized onions with sausage and buttery toast. Oh, and the biscuits and gravy is the only b&g we've had where the gravy doesn't taste canned!"}
{"text":"Ok, the place is attractive, friendly, nice mood setting, and very nicely laid out. Perfect for brunch for friends, family, and special dates. The outside patio seating would be nice in the mornings or afternoons just cuz you can watch the cars and peoe pass by while you conversate with friends, or even while eating.  The service was great again. Ive been here a few times already, and not once i had bad service. Its a small restaurant, but surprisingly alot of seating. Theres also a bar if you want to enjoy a mimosa or bloody mary with your friends. Haha. Service though is always on point.   The food! Talk about good flavor! Ok presentation, but the flavors make up for everything and keeps your mouth shut. Sometimes you enjoy the flavor so much you dont want to talk. Lol.   The noise level is ok. Its not too loud, not too quiet. So you can definitely enjoy this place. I recommend all there eggs benedict, the banana french toast, and belgian waffles. Flavors flavors flavors. I guess i enjoy food maybe more then alot out there.   I gave four stars cuz i had better, but this is close to better for sure."}
{"text":"A good old standby, when you can't think of anywhere else to go for breakfast or lunch.  I don't always go there (cause I like variety), but DD is on my favorites list.  Why?  Always crowded, but I get seated quickly. Always good food.   Always good service. Always a nice drink selection (full bar, yo!) Always solid.  And for that I am grateful."}
{"text":"I had heard some pretty good things about this place, so I decided to check it out for brunch. We were originally seated in a booth which was cool until we found ourselves peering around the restaurant wondering where our server was to take our drink order. After about ten minutes we decided to just go ahead and sit at the bar for faster service.   The bartender was great, super friendly and prompt in taking our drink order and getting us menus. He seemed knowledgeable about the menu as well which was reassuring. I ordered the vegetable nicoise salad and my bf had the gladiator burger. Food was very satisfying and we were both very pleased with the portion size of both selections. I highly recommend the salad, only downside was a non tossed salad but beautifully presented nonetheless.   As we were presented with the bill, we decided to grab drinks to go, I ordered an iced latte and my bf a hot tea. Seeing as how this place has a giant espresso machine in the middle of the restaurant and advertises having great coffee I figure I have to give it a shot. As I watched the server prepare my drink I saw him grab for a red and white 20 oz Coca Cola to go cup, something that you would see being served at a fast paced pizza place. Anyway, since my latte is $5+ I'm expecting a suitable to go cup for my drink, I'm not asking for anything fancy but I kind of am. A clear cup would do. You'd think they would have cups with their logo on it even. I don't think I'm being out line for docking them points for this but it was offensive to receive my tasty latte in that kind of cup. Just didn't make sense. I will go back but not for the coffee to go."}
{"text":"Great food and drinks. Indoor and outdoor seating right in the heart of Old Town. Good atmosphere. Sometimes can be a bit of a wait when it's busy but there's also a reason why. Highly reccomend."}
{"text":"The only negative? The wait. Be prepared to stand outside for a half hour or more on a weekend. They have coffee and cucumber water to enjoy while you wait, though. And it IS worth the wait. Their omelets are delicious, as are the breakfast potatoes. Mmmm. The breakfast nachos were a great hit with our table, too. Everyone liked their food except for one of our friends who got the hangover sandwich. He said there was way too much going on and it made his hangover worse. Ha. He also said the bloody mary \"tasted weird.\" But, he was hungover, so take that with a grain of salt ;)"}
{"text":"I love this place! I took my two friends from NYC, and they thought the food was definitely worth the wait. We went this past Sunday and waited about 30 mins for a table, even though they quoted a 20 min wait. Overall, the service was friend, fast, and the management was superb. I feel more comfortable and taken care of when the manager goes up to my table to make sure the service is great! This restaurant rocks and so does the staff!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast, the omelets are good and there is a good variety of choices. Plus they have gluten free options as well, which is nice. If your looking for a new place to try this one is definitely worth it."}
{"text":"We had a great breakfast experience here, this morning.  We were seated promptly, served attentively, and fed lovely things.  I had the caprese omelet with butternut squash & mushroom hash and breakfast potatoes. The potatoes and hash were both wow, and the omelet was flavorful, though a little drier than I like.   My husband had the mixed berry protein pancakes, which were hearty and tasty enough to require only a bit of syrup. It was a lot of food, a great deal for the price. We took half home for a yummy lunch.  The place is really cute. We'd heard the service could be spotty, but we caught them on an excellent day - constantly full water glasses, prompt and smiling delivery of food, containers and check."}
{"text":"Service has been excellent both times we've been here. Wait is not too long for large groups, and they serve both iced and hot coffee while you wait. Food is unique and delicious. I tried the breakfast nachos and can't get anything else, they are so good! A Scottsdale must-go for brunch."}
{"text":"Fabulous! Can't say enough about the food and drinks! Definitely recommend the chicken and waffles and the chorizo and jalapeño corn cakes!! Nicholas was our waiter and he is a super star! Definitely coming back next time I'm in town! 5 stars for sure!!"}
{"text":"This place is probably more of a 31/2.  The ambiance is like a hip bar so very cool.  The service was mostly unattentive but polite.  After the initial greeting and ordering we didn't see her again until we received the check.  Too bad because we wanted an OJ and maybe another coffee and didn't get a chance to order.  The caprese omelet was good but not great.  The chorizo jalapeño and onion omelet was pretty decent.  Also, not great.  Both omelets were all egg with very little inside.  The Bloody Mary was average at best.  The Americano was also ok, average.  I can see why people like this place because it has a nice vibe.  Lunch may be better.  I would rather go around the corner to Orange Table as the food and coffee were better.  Overall, I've been to just about every good breakfast joint in the valley and this place is not anywhere close to the top 5.  Again, I would hope that the lunch and happy hour drinks are what keep people coming here but that's neither here nor there.  I would go back to try lunch but won't run back for breakfast."}
{"text":"This is hands down my favorite breakfast place to go to now.  First of all, they have fresh coffee outside that you can help yourself to. Secondly, there will probably be a wait but it's worth it and you can sip on coffee, sit in a big chair and people watch outside.  We had the bacon bloody marys which you seriously should try. Amazing!  We had the Hangover sandwhich and Southwest Flannel Hash. Both were superb and I couldn't finish the Southwest Flannel Hash but it made for amazing leftovers the next morning.   The vibe inside is very trendy and fun. I loved the friendly service we received and will be back again and again! :)"}
{"text":"It took me way to long to get to Daily Dose, and it's taken even longer to get to my review, but my one resolution this year is to get caught up!  Stopped in for lunch with my husband since we were already parked nearby.  While the restaurant is fairly small, we were there at an off hour so no wait at all!  We shared the cobb salad and the ancho chili reuben.  They initially brought one salad and the sandwich was split for us.  I foolishly assumed the salad was to be shared until a second one came out.  Are you kidding me?  How big are these salads?  Pretty darn big, and pretty darn good.  Plenty of bacon and blue cheese, and no skimping on the avocado either.  Unfortunately, they don't come in half sizes which is too bad if you're not sharing because I can't imagine being able to finish one (and I can eat) and leftover salad just doesn't work.  Not to mention it's not easy for me to order a salad to begin with.  I have good intentions, but as I open my mouth to speak, something like \"chimichanga\" comes out instead.  The reuben was good, but a little dry.  Next time I'll ask for extra dressing on the side.  I'm looking forward to going back and trying that french toast Julia T raves about!"}
{"text":"Brunch was awesome!  The breakfast nachos we're phenomenal!!  Our server Kegan was very attentive and friendly. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"My fiance and I frequent DD at least once a week, it is the best breakfast spot in town! LOVE the protein pancakes, DD Hash and Roasted Turkey Sandwhich...mmmm! The staff is great as well, the owner always recognizes us and comes over to say hello. Try it once and you won't go back to the other places!"}
{"text":"The food wasn't bad but the service was kinda slow. I'd go back maybe when it's not so busy."}
{"text":"This This is my second visit. My first visit I had spectacular food with good company. This time not so much on the food side.  The service here is great, and so is the layout and ambiance of the interior of the resraurant. The music isn't overbearing, and the seats are comfortable  This time I had the chorizo mac n cheese. Spicy, is a good word to describe it. But not overbearingly so. I feel like it was too much food on the plate. Last time my chorizo mac n cheese was a side dish side that was made with a different spiral pasta. This time it was big clamshell mac and it just wasn't as good.  Don't even bother with the cornmeal battered onion rings. I'm an onion ring aficionado,  and I can tell you this was a real loser. You want your onion ring skin to be crispy, and not corn-mealy and dry and which peels right off.   Anyway this visit was a bust, but I still like this place and I will be coming back with a different strategy in mind"}
{"text":"Breakfast nachos and Bloody Mary.. AMAZING! Great service. Highly recommended and will be returning!"}
{"text":"I really, really like Daily Dose.  The service is pretty good and the food is darn-near amazing.  Had brunch here with a group of 7-8 recently and it continues to be solid.  Oddly enough a girl friend and I sat at the bar a couple weeks ago and had really slow service.  =/  Usually I choose the bar because your server is always right in front of you if you need something, but that didn't quite work out here.   Happy hour goes every day of the week until 8pm, so that's a bonus!  I've had brunch, lunch, dinner and happy hour here ... They have lots of options for herbivores like myself and carnivores alike.  The cocktail menu is good and their sangria is tasty.  The wait times can be extensive on the weekends for breakfast/brunch, so plan accordingly."}
{"text":"Four words: Creme Brulee Peach Pancakes. Get it. You can get a single pancake for only 3.25 and it's absolutely worth it! The banana caramel french toast was also amazing."}
{"text":"Very positive experience.seated promptly and food was served very quickly. The baked Bree was awesome"}
{"text":"Sit outside and people watch and have the hummus-we love this place! A bit pricy, but well worth the service and the quality of the food and drinks."}
{"text":"On my last day in Scottsdale I wanted a good breakfast to fortify me for a long day of travel. The Daily Dose was near the hotel and had good reviews. The pics looked good too.  There was a bit of a wait, but no biggie. It was sunny, but a very strong cold wind was blowing. We ended up on the patio, but there was a heater, so it wasn't bad, but we did get a lot of wind. At one point, the wind blew off the table my tortilla for my dish.   I love green chilie pork and they had this great dish on the menu that included white beans, pork, with eggs and avocado. Sounded delish. It was mostly good. The flavors were there but sadly, the beans were not all the way cooked, they were way too firm still, and I couldn't eat them. But the chilie sauce and the eggs and the pork, in a tortilla were good. It was disappointing though, as the beans were a major component of the dish.  I also ordered one side pancake for my friend and I to share. It was almost like a crepe, it was that thin. It also was really rubbery. You couldn't cut through it with the fork. Very strange.  Service was outstanding though. When my tortilla flew off the table from the wind, she gladly got me another one. Our server was friendly and working hard.   Overall it was good, and I'd give them another chance, but someone should test the beans before they decide to serve them."}
{"text":"We absolutely love coming here for breakfast whenever we're in town!  We always walk here & it doesn't matter if there's a wait to get in, it's worth it to us!  Today my husband had the Eggs Benedict & I had the Pig in a Bagel & the waitress was super accompanying with my changing the bacon to ham, adding cream cheese to the sandwich & sliced tomato on the side instead of potatoes !  The bloody Mary's are always yummy when we don't opt for fresh squeezed oj with vodka !!"}
{"text":"Cute joint with nice decor and really good breakfast.  Everyone at our table ordered something different we all loved it!"}
{"text":"Visiting Scottsdale for a wedding and came here for breakfast. Really great food made with fresh ingredients. Friendly staff. Delicious!"}
{"text":"Had a burger here on my latest trip to Scottsdale! Service was fine but a bit slow as I sat at the bar, and the lone BT was busy! Still she poured me a beer and a water, so I was fine with the wait! The bar is open at 7 am along with the restaurant which is nice for shift workers like myself! A decent selection of beers, mamosas and other crafty cocktails! You can get a full bottle of champagne and choice of juice for $20. I ordered the Gladiator Burger which comes with grilled onions and jalapeños, I ordered it with onion rings! The food came out relatively quickly and was served hot and fresh, the onion rings were hot and fresh as well, but I wasn't impressed with the corn meal batter which was gritty and rather bland and just too heavy! The onions inside however were sweet and delicious! My Burger was slightly over cooked but it was still juicy and tender, although it could use a bit more seasoning! I ordered it on Rye Bread which is my go to way to eat burgers, and the bread was fresh and delicious! Overall the meal was solid, and I like that I could order from the lunch menu and have a beer at 7am! I would definitely come again, as I left full and happy!"}
{"text":"Good food, great patio and friendly service; these are three Daily Dose highlights. After walking by the Dose several times in the last year, I've finally had a chance to visit a handful of times and I'm adding this to my list of weekend afternoon or happy hour stops.   I first visited for happy hour. I was pleased to learn that domestic beers were just $2 and they served them in ice cold glasses. Now for those who know me, they know that I don't typically drink beer from a glass. Not sure why, but there's just something about drinking out of a bottle. But, in the case of the Daily Dose, I went with the glass this time because it was so cold it chilled the beer to perfection. After reading so many reviews about the Daily Dose burger, I had to give it a try. Not bad burger lovers. The pretzel bun added to the taste and the burger was solid. The fries were OK. I had the combo but preferred the regular fries to the sweet potato ones. One thing that surprised our group was that the restaurant does last call at 9 on the weekdays, so we noted that this isn't your choice for making it a late night.   The second time I visited, my friend and I split the citrus avocado salad with cilantro lime dressing and the shaved turkey melt with brie. I really liked the unique kick to the salad due to the combo of fruit and avocado. It was a refreshing bed of greens. The turkey melt was a combination of brie, jalapenos and chipotle mayo on sourdough bread. It's a great sandwich if you're in the mood to consume some cheesy calories.   Both times, I've enjoyed the food and will definitely remember the Daily Dose when my tummy starts growling again."}
{"text":"Very busy on a Saturday morning but not too long a wait. This establishment really caters to those who like to drink alcohol at breakfast. The food was okay, pretty standard breakfast food for Scottsdale. The coffee was okay. The service was very good.  I'll probably try somewhere else next time."}
{"text":"Fast, friendly service. I couldn't choose between a few menu items so our server let me know I could substitute items making it my perfect meal and I got everything I wanted. Food was amazing! New breakfast spot for sure"}
{"text":"We had a bit of a wait (25 min) on a Friday morning but it was definitely worth it! Great m, attentive yet not overbearing service (thanks, Keegan!) and the food was awesome (I had the chorizo omelet, while my husband had the flannel hash Benedict)! Great vibe here, we'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Had a fantastic breakfast here.  Thanks to Jeanine for the great rundown of the menu!  Will be back for sure!!!"}
{"text":"Whenever I'm in the Phoenix area I make it a point to come to Daily Dose.  The Green Chili Chicken Enchiladas are always great and the cilantro lime dressing is light and flavorful on salads.  Check it out, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I went here for breakfast and was a little wary because I don't like eggs and most breakfast menus are full of nothing but eggs.  One thing on the breakfast menu really stuck out to me - banana bread french toast.  I may not like eggs but I LOVE banana bread.  Add some caramelized bananas on top and some vanilla sauce and caramel sauce AND nuts?  Now that just sounds like heaven.  And it was.  There were 2 full slices (I ate one for breakfast and took the other home for lunch).  I opted for the side of fresh fruit (I can't remember what the other choices were) and this was good also.  Their ice water has cucumber slices in it - different and refreshing!  I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Went here for a family brunch for my birthday. It's been a year or so since my last visit so we decided on this location. There was 5 of us and we had about a 30 minute wait to sit on the patio which was fine with us. We had a great server as she took our orders. I ordered the Eggs Benedict as that is my usual go to item at brunch...well both eggs were overcooked so it wasn't that good. We all kind of shared or had bites from the other dishes and they were all very good. My mom had the cinnamon roll pancakes, my brother had the berry protein pancakes and my brother's girlfriend and my dad got the turkey sausage omelet. Since the portions were quite big we all got to share it. Everyone else's food was much better than mine. I don't think I'll get the Eggs Benedict again from here as they were really overcooked. Again, service was very good which was great!"}
{"text":"Stopped by this hidden gem in Scottsdale during a girls weekend and loved it! The food was flavorful, the fresh brewed coffee was delicious and our server was friendly and attentive. Definitely worth a visit!"}
{"text":"Came here yesterday for a late dinner and drink and was impressed. I had thought this was only breakfast and my dinner was delicious. They have a great happy hour and list of beers to choose. I would come back again and want to try it for breakfast as well. Only downside was they close at 9 and felt a little rushed to leave starting around 8pm. As a former server, I understand but others might not."}
{"text":"The staff is freaking awesome at Daily Dose! They seated me immediately and, because the weather was a bit chilly, set up the heaters. My server was amiable, attentive and helpful with suggestions and knowledgeable about the area.   I had the Poblano Eggs Benny and a bacon-bloody Mary. I'll be honest, the food was...okay...lacking robust and memorable flavors. Not the best I've had; not the worst. BUT THE SERVICE was impeccable, and had I never had an eggs benny I may not have known better and considered myself fortunate."}
{"text":"Lots of spring ball fans here, I see SF gear everywhere!  Ended up getting the Southwest Flannel Hash ($10):  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HCCg-rVnHQ2FI6lHs_LvUQ?select=1x1RZ-jpHgil1l7aoTQ4zw  I must say, this hash was very tasty!  The corned beef was cook and seasoned nicely, and the portion was generous.  Ancho Chili Reuben (I think?):  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HCCg-rVnHQ2FI6lHs_LvUQ?select=iruecxnja3wL0c6uAKeVWQ  Only got to take a small bite, but it was good.    Irrelevant complaint:  Didn't like the whole cucumber slice in the water deal, it was NASTY!  But that's minor and won't stop me from coming back."}
{"text":"Stopped in today for breakfast for the 1st time.  Service and food was great! I ordered the 2 egg shooter which came with pancakes,  your choice of meat and fruit.  Very affordable, I will return."}
{"text":"I came here on my lunch break and met up with a good friend. It was busy but we got a table right away. Everyone was so nice and cheery. I had the best chorizo mac and cheese on the planet! It was so filling and I had enough left over for another meal! My friend got some special grilled cheese but said my mac and cheese topped it! I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This review is for my recent experience. I've been to the restaurant many times so obviously the food is good.   The service however today was terrible. We walked up at 8:50 on Sunday morning and saw there was an available table fit for two on the patio. I requested the table and was told we could sit there. However, rather than seating us there at the perfectly clean and ready table we were told their server needed to catch up and it would take less than 10 minutes to get seated so we were put on the list, first ones up. No problem. 10 minutes go by and more and more people are walking in and getting their names put down. One family even sat at the specific table without putting their name down. I went to the front and asked if we were still waiting for that table. He explained the table was ours and they would ask the family to wait. That happens, but then another 10 minutes goes by (they seat 2 9tops that came in after us) and we are still standing outside staring at our table. I asked the host why and he said that the patio server was behind and they would rather us not wait at the table not being served. WTF. Obviously I would rather sit at a table with some water than stand on the other side of the fence staring at it. Apparently it would have been above his or anyone else's job to bring us two glasses of water and let us sit comfortably. On top of it I said, you do realize you sat 18 people whose food orders will now go in ahead of ours. He said I know, and I'm sorry. Ooookaayyy.   When a server is down your management needs to step in. We left because the whole situation was super rude and after a certain point it seems that our satisfaction and business didn't matter at all.   This is Arizona, your patio server should be your most capable. And you should probably have more than one."}
{"text":"it was early...saturday. the wife and i cruised up to Daily Dose for a breakfast morning out. the place was relatively slow when we arrived. which is why i was a bit miffed at how below-average the service was.  like the good patrons we are, we waited to be seated. once seated, we waited....and waited...for menus. then waited...and waited for any service. then waited....and waited...for coffee (which still is some of the best restaurant coffee i've ever had). then waited....and waited....and waited....and waited....for our food. then waited...and waited...and waited....for our water and coffee to be refilled. so i got up and tried to find it myself.   the food is good. the breakfast potatoes are delicious. i ordered the mixed berry pancakes and they were tasty as well. our server was friendly but there was just a lack of it. i guess after 2 tries, we'll stick to our other breakfast hangouts."}
{"text":"Went to Scottsdale for brunch, and our favorite place in town is Daily Dose.  Would have given it 5 stars, but we had to wait about 20 minutes for a table, and there waiting area inside is a bit cramped.  However, there are seats outside and they provide complementary drinks, but it was chilly outside and the wife and I decided to stay inside.  The wait and amount of people that bear waiting is a testament to how great the food is here.  Our absolute favorite is the breakfast nachos!  The chips are crispy and the toppings are an awesome combination of chorizo, cheese, sausage and some other things I can't name but tastes awesome!  It also comes with sausage gravy which is great as well.  I love this place and recommend it to anyone looking for a good breakfast joint, if you don't mind waiting."}
{"text":"Sunday Funday started out fabulously thanks to this amazing restaurant!  We started with an appetizer of chicken nachos... and MY GOD. The \"appetizer\" was a plate big enough to feed three hungry females and STILL have leftovers.   I'm super picky when I order anything and all of my orders end up being a complicated mess (Can you substitute this? Can I have this on the side? I need dipping sauce.) Our waitress - I'm so bummed I can't remember her name - was the sweetest lady. She was so patient with me and brought out the food exactly how I wanted to see it. Everything was incredibly delicious, too.  Then, to top it all off, apparently they were closing early for their company holiday party. We started noticing people disappearing from the restaurant and we asked the manager if they were closing, to which he replied, \"yes, we closed at 2pm.\" It was 3:30 when we looked at the clock and I couldn't believe it! They let us sit and enjoy our meal without making us feel rushed or even mentioning their early closing time. That was stellar customer service and I would give them 10 stars for that if I could.  Try this place - you will LOVE it."}
{"text":"Great breakfast! Love the lox omelet and the berry protein pancakes."}
{"text":"Nothing special. The food was ok. I ordered huevos rancheros but they came out cold. They did have coffee for all the people waiting which was nice. Definitely not going to go back. Not the best place, not the worst. It definitely not worth waiting 30+ minutes for. 2 1/2 stars"}
{"text":"Joined a friend for lunch.  Underwhelmed by the choices, selected veggie burger, it was not tasty.  Beer selection is blah.  I chose a microbrew, from the menu, but they'd just discontinued it.  So, went with the boring national brand I can get anywhere.  Friendly staff, but that isn't good enough for a return visit."}
{"text":"Upon stumbling up and down S-dale road during our day rage in the sun, we popped into here craving some epic gourmet burgers. Delicious burgers we got, service was a little slow and off, and the beer selection was sadly smaller that we expected. Their menu was pretty wide, but nothing to ooo and ah over."}
{"text":"This is a solid breakfast place with a ton of great choices. The turkey sausage omelet was tasty, but I could take or leave the potatoes. It is a great casual place to take a group. The patio is dog friendly and the restaurant looks very kid friendly. I came here with a group of four and everyone left satisfied."}
{"text":"Great food. I love their food. But I need to make this very clear for fellow dog lovers. Though this restaurant can be listed as \"dog-friendly\" on some sites, they are more \"dog-tolerant\" and that's being generous. We brought out puppy husky to have lunch on the patio since they were listed as a dog-friendly restaurant. We were informed as we were sitting down after already placing our order that out dog had to sit outside the fence next to the table. This was a nightmare. Since our dog was a puppy at the time he whined and whined and whined because he wanted to sit at our feet. He constantly tried to climb back over to sit at our feet and the manager continually walked by the table to check under and make sure our husky was not lying at our feet. It made me and my friends tired and anxious to not only listen to the puppies whining and having to push him back outside the gates but to see the little male manager come out again and again to check under our table. We ended up scarfing whatever food we had so we could get out. The waiter was very sweet about the situation but I ended up irritated because we couldn't have the slightest bit of leeway and have the dog lay down under the table quietly instead of less than one foot away behind the fence. But other than that, great food and great service :P"}
{"text":"Hit or miss, but usually worth the wait!  Hit: crab cake benedict (regular style is better than the Daily Dose style with the gravy, imho)  Miss: hangover sandwich (cute name, but actually unappetizing). sangria-margarita slushie looks/sounds yummy, but actually was so gross I couldn't finish it #rare  If they tweaked the menu a lil bit, this place could be A+"}
{"text":"We came here twice and the visits were three weeks apart. We got the same server and she remembered us!  The host was respectful and nice and our server was a very cool lady that helped us pick out some items both times, because we were pretty unfamiliar.  Good breakfast and lunch joint. First time we came, I had the chorizo eggs benedict. The hash was squash or something, I don't recall. I had a side of sweet potato fries. I didn't even finish the plate. It was a lot of food and very presentable.  A lot of people always compare breakfast joints to Dennys, saying they could have gotten the same taste. I mostly agree... with breakfast, it's usually a similar process but you will never get food as pretty as this at a Dennys. The squash hash is very good but very, very sweet.  Second time I was really hungry, so I got the Daily Dose burger. I never order burgers because fast food turned me off of them but this was good. It was so big I had to eat the toppings and meat in sections!  We never waited. We usually came around 2ish and were seated right away. This would be five stars with all the great service and accommodations but the food didn't blow me away. It was good but standard, for the most part."}
{"text":"This one has been in my bookmark list and I was so glad to finally cross it off The hostess was very nice and although it was pretty packed she gave us the option to wait for a table or sit at the bar...  We were hungry and I like sitting at bars, just because it is always a fun experience So we sat at the bar The girl with the blonde hair (she was the only blonde) was super fun and talkative She really made out daily dose experience great. She  was soooooo friendly... I really liked her and she didn't have to try hard to please us. She took out orders and made sure our drinks were full...  The manager was also very nice and also made us feel very welcomed  As for my meal I chose the flannel corned beef hash meal and it was surprisingly good It was a twist on the traditional corned beef hash and I liked it My over medium eggs were yummy I usually don't eat toast when I order but I guess I was hungry and chowed it down  All in all, daily dose is a great breakfast place and I hope that everyone has a great experience here  Get a mimosa"}
{"text":"Delicious and creative  Their menu is vast with so many unique breakfast and lunch iteams that you don't find most places.  Food Breakfast Nachos-STUPID, Nachos topped with eggs, scallions, tomatoes, sausage, sour cream and cheese. All served with a side of CRACK sausage gravy.   Mimosa-Nice and strong with a splash of OJ just the way I like it.  I have also had their Breakfast Sandwhich and that is the best breakfast sandwhich I have ever had.   Great place to go with good customer service and a good time.  Expect a wait on weekends.."}
{"text":"Well this is truly a hidden gem in Old Town Scottsdale. The wife and I visited this establishment last Sunday after church. There is usually a long wait here...but we arrived about 10 am and there was no wait. We were seated very quickly and the service was very good...there was a little wait for our food but no complaints about that though. I had 2 great buttermilk pancakes, turkey sausage, eggs, potatoes, and hash...the price....only 9 bucks plus tax...a really great deal. So if your ever in Old Town Scottsdale and need a great breakfast to get your day started...visit this establishment. Eat, Drink, and Be Merry my Friends!!!!!"}
{"text":"mmmm straight of the plane and off to daily dose before a baseball game. Husband had the breakfast nachos which were super tasty. I had a turkey sausage eggs benedict. I love any time I get to enjoy turkey sausage so I was already happy seeing this on the menu but lucky me, it also tasted good. Definitely want to go back to try some of the really unhealthy delicious things friends recommended (banana bread french toast).  They don't take reservations for brunch but it was about a 20 minute wait even though there were TONS of people waiting so not bad at all."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I totally disagree with another reviewer who said this place looks like a pub/sports bar when you first walk in.  It doesn't, in my opinion.  You want the feeling like you are walking into a sports bar?  Go to Zipps down on Camelback and Miller.  THAT's a sports bar, and definitely not a pub.  So, me and my Complimentary Force, aka SO, aka, Mrs., went here for the first time this past Sunday.  We live within walking distance and always said we would try it, as we have with many of the other breakfast joints in Old Town.   Service - 5 stars.  The entire staff was friendly, smiling and seemed genuine.  Our server, Miguel, was super nice, informative and if he didn't know the answer to a question, like, \"hey, who makes your bread\", he would go find out.  Food - Okay, I would like to go higher, but this is based on my personal food preferences.  I'm giving the food 4 stars because as FRESH, WELL PREPARED and THOUGHTFUL everything was, the caramelized onions were too sweet for me.  I had the chorizo omelette and the presentation and flavor of the chorizo was great.  The potatoes were yummy and the marble rye bread was really tasty, made by a local Phoenix bakery that sells to restaurants only (thanks for the info, Miguel!)  The rosemary crème fraîche that was included was distinctively wonderful.  My included side was the flannel hash, which tasted like it used both russet and sweet potatoes.  Again, very good, just too sweet.  My lady love had the southwest flannel hash, and like the chorizo omelette, the caramelized onions were too sweet but everything else about it, meat, potatoes, etc... were very good.    Neither of us are huge into sweet-tasting food (we're sweet already!) so that's where the lack of 5 stars comes from.  Coffee - great!  Both the leaded and unleaded (that's caffeinated and decaf for anyone not savvy to the lingo).  I would definitely recommend Daily Dose to anyone and will also eat here again.  Bon appetit!"}
{"text":"My husband first took me to this restaurant over two years ago.  It is a hip little place that has both inside and outside seating.  We have only been there for breakfast and lunch, but that's okay because the food is great!  The menu is diverse without being overwhelming.  Sometimes you try a place that mixes flavors that just shouldn't be together.  At first, I thought this might be the case at DD, but not so.  I suggest you set your volume on adventure and jump in.  Try the place a few time, with different dishes each time.    I have tried most of their omelets, except for the tempeh and grains, greens and beans, and the crabby (shellfish allergy).  My favorite is the Lox omelet.  I like it with the Lox inside the omelet with the cream cheese mixed with the eggs.  I also like a side of hollandaise sauce to pour over top. Mmmmm... Always go for the DD hash on the side of anything you order. Don't ask, just do it.  There are three breakfast bowls and I only go with two.  Hint: I am not a big fan of tempeh and baby kale. Pancakes!!  My only other favorite place for pancakes is First Watch's and their carrot cake pancakes.  The cinnamon roll pancakes at DD are enough to send me into a food coma just from the shear smell.  Incredible! French Toast?  Yes, please!  Their banana bread french toast are so good.  We get a plate and share between 4 people.  They are incredibly delicious; like a Saturday treat for a week well done. The waffles are amazing.  The peanut butter and jelly sound interesting?  They are actually really yummy! There are a few dishes worth mentioning on their specialty item section. Take a chance and try the Southwest wrap, the Hangover sandwich or the Southwest Flannel Hash.  You might find a favorite.  Daily Dose has become a wonderful addition to a restaurant repertoire.  This is now a place that we regularly meet friends on an early Saturday morning, to talk, eat, and relax a nice chill setting.  We love this place and that won't change anytime soon."}
{"text":"My mom and I went here for brunch the other day and loved it! I ordered the caprese omelette and my mom ordered the southwest wrap, both delicious. But what we really appreciated was their attention to detail, they add a slice of cucumber to the water and offer such a great selection of sides! Since I was on the clock, I couldn't order a mimosa, but I took my friend during the weekend so I could try one of their specialty mimosas, yum!"}
{"text":"Came here after unsuccessful attempts to find a good place that would serve breakfast at 2 pm on a Monday haha. Glad we stopped in because it was a good experience! The ambiance feels kinda typical for old town haha. It was cool sitting near the nice bar they have!  They had their happy hour going on so my sister and I ordered mimosa cocktails. My sister got a strawberry one and I got a ginger one. They looked so cute, but they were 90% champagne. Good if you're looking for a strong drink, but we were not haha. I was happy to see vegetarian friendly stuff marked on the menu! I got the tempeh breakfast burrito. My sister got the strawberry ginger granola. I was worried I wouldn't like my burrito due to past bad tempeh experiences, but it was quite delicious! I can't eat eggs anymore but miss enjoying delicious breakfast burritos, this hit the spot. I also got potatoes as my side, it was enough for me to share and tasted great when I added them to my burrito! My sister liked her granola too. And prices are reasonable! And servers are nice! I'd for sure come back if I were in the area and craving a breakfast burrito."}
{"text":"Found this place walking around old town Scottsdale. The food was fast and delicious I had the daily doze burger and is a must to have if you come go there. The waitress that helped us \"Silvia\" was a sweetheart, checked on us constantly and always had a smile. The next time I'm back in Scottsdale I'll make sure to eat there again."}
{"text":"I usually only like salty breakfast-but this place has the most amazing French Toast, Pancakes and Waffles...MMmmmm.    For that i want nothing more than to give it 5 stars but like i mentioned, i like salty breakfasts.  They do have some good items but as an overall, the items lack a bit of flavor and have been cold when i have eaten there.   -I have had some basic poached eggs w bacon and potatoes, the                          hangover sandwich, and a wrap-as well as bites from whatever my breakfast partner has had.  Hopefully you have better experiences on your meals than i have.  But like i said, their sweet breakfasts are WONDERFUL. At the very least go in and try them for those. Happy Eating!"}
{"text":"Don't order take out. You'll get your food faster if you order in. I've been waiting 30 minutes for the chicken tenders I ordered a half hour ago. My refund is taking even longer, and apparently, they burned my food twice.   It's called lunch hour, not ruin my lunch waiting all day on twice burner chicken tenders. FYI - I orders it b/c I figured it's the easiest and fastest thing to make."}
{"text":"Before we start, I had high expectations for this place.  So the word on the street was this place was kickin' it.  Yeah, it was a tad bit busy during my visit and they had their happy hour specials chalked on the wall right when you walk in.  Great HH 4pm to 8pm --- Yah!  I came right on time 7:50pm hehe.  I ordered the Daily Dose Burger -- Bacon and grilled onions --- ohhh.  Well, I enjoyed my burger, but it didn't really kick or pow me palate in anyway.  Needless to say it was decent.  Service, my delight was probably from the hostess, cute gal with a broken arm awww.  Had a fun conversation about the restaurant and made fun of some of the patrons.  I had this weird desire to sign her cast, but didn't want to ask haha!  As for the ambience, it was what I expected - petite with a cute relax atmosphere.  Crowded for sure, but I always enjoy low lite bars with X-mas lights! - Enjoy"}
{"text":"I initially visited Daily Dose about a year ago after a night out.  I was only able to stomach some coffee and a few bites of breakfast nachos that morning, so I wanted to come back for a real (sober) meal.  Alas, they made a better impression on my first visit, headache and all.  My recent visit was on a Sunday, around 11:30am, and surprisingly there wasn't a line.  We had a 5 min wait though, so we helped ourselves to water & coffee from the pitchers outside.  When we were called to our table I was a little disappointed - the table was tiny and squeezed between the door to the front patio and a server's station - but I let it go.  My son knew he wanted a cheeseburger and I finally decided on the Ancho-chile corned beef sandwich with sweet potato fries.  Yes, this was going to be a cheat day!  Our waitress seemed.... off, and lacking personality.  She didn't take our menus after we'd ordered and there was no where to put them on the tiny table, so they ended up propped up against the window.  Same thing with our paper cups we'd brought in from outside - they sat next to the menus the whole meal.  The wait for our meals was a little long in my opinion - about 35 minutes.  During that time, our waitress was completely MIA and our drinks sat almost empty.  Thankfully, the guy who finally brought out our food was nice enough to refill them.    So, I thought corned beef rubbed with ancho chili spice and topped with sauerkraut on rye was going to be a bomb of savory, tangy, spicy flavor!  But.... not, not at all.  What in the hell do you do to sauerkraut to make it BLAND?  How do you make these yummy ingredients just completely flat??  Frankly, I was PISSED I wasted so many calories on this sandwich.  I ate half because I was really hungry but didn't even bother to take the other half home.  On a more positive note, the sweet potato fries were excellent.  Feeling unfulfilled, I decided to try my son's cheeseburger.  Even though it was from the kid's menu, the burger was ENORMOUS and they sure didn't skimp on his fries either.  Sadly, the burger was also really under-seasoned and I honestly wondered if they'd seasoned it at all.  The pretzel-bread bun was the most flavorful part of the burger - it was yum!  About 15 minutes after our food came out, the waitress finally came by.  I asked her for a box (for my son's burger) and the check, which she brought to us at the speed of light.  I was very surprised to see I'd been charged $2.50 for a glass and a half of lukewarm, weak iced tea.  If I'd known that, I would've ordered a Tecate light for the same price.  Anyway, I got the distinct impression she wanted us to leave so her table could be re-seated with people who would drink and rack up a bigger bill.  Her loss, as I usually tip very generously when I'm out with my son.   Overall, I was just totally bummed with Daily Dose's food, service, and value - and bummed my 100th Yelp review only deserves 2-stars."}
{"text":"I've only been here for breakfast once but will definitely be returning soon! Yum! I had the strawberry creme brûlée waffle and my friend got the crab cake eggs benedict. Both plates were amazing! My waffle tasted like dessert and I couldn't finish it. I tasted my friend's crab cake eggs benedict and it was heavenly. I will order that next time!!   As far as drinks, I had a peach bellini and my friend tried one of the bloody marys. She was excited because they had five or six different kinds of bloody marys to choose from. Personally it's not my thing, but she said it tasted great. The bellini was sweet but I would recommend getting a double.   Our server was nice and attentive but not bothersome. We arrived relatively early (around 915) so there wasn't any wait to sit down, but by the time we left, the entrance was full of people waiting for tables. The atmosphere of the restaurant was pleasant and hip without being too aggressive. Unlike other places in Old Town, the music wasn't blasting and I didn't feel like I was at a club for breakfast. I enjoyed the food and will come back soon!"}
{"text":"This place is AMAAAAAAZE! The potatoes are delicioso; the fruit is fresh and sweet; and the protein pancakes were LIFE in pancake form! . That's all I've had from here, but my picky friend got the loaded nacho joints (I can't remember what they call them here) and he said they were BOMB. He also said the guac was really good after saying he doesn't like guac lol . I second the guac, DEELISH! Anyway, chill place for brunch, amazing food, and basic...? customer service (nothing stands out)."}
{"text":"Ate at Daily Dose today after church and we made it just before the long wait. Great atmosphere and very attentive staff, I had the prime rib & cremini mushroom omelet yum. The pancakes looked inviting with the various toppings but I couldn't bring myself to get just pancakes and fruit for was an omelet or regular breakfast would cost. I would love to try their happy hours because $4 margaritas and $2 tacos sounds like the makings of a great Monday nite."}
{"text":"Breakfast nachos?!?!?!??!?!?!!!!  They were good. Totally completely not healthy, but so tasty. I'm not a biscuits and gravy kind of girl, but the sausage gravy is insanely good. I will admit, this dish is really rich - It could have used maybe a little more spice?  It would be a good sharing appetizer if you brunch here with a group.  As a solo breakfast, I'm glad I got to experience it, but I dunno if I can handle that again!  Overall, really like this place. And so many options for breakfast!!! The only drawback here is the parking."}
{"text":"A nice spot in Old Town Scottsdale. I came on a Saturday for brunch with my husband and sister-in-law. There was a long wait - we were quoted 25 minutes but it ended up taking closer to 40. But we did get a table outside.  It's road-side, but there is a nice area to wait and they offer free coffee and water. It's not a busy walking street so there are a few chairs and plenty of space to stand. Fortunately the weather was good.  We were finally seated on the patio, which fit a lot of people in a small space. Clean, and a nice atmosphere. It wasn't loud or overcrowded despite the limited space.  The service was, unfortunately, very spotty. The server mentioned it was her third day on the job - I don't know if it was her first time waitressing but after the long wait we didn't have much patience. She brought a coffee with no cream or sweeteners, then came by with some 2% I'd requested for my tea, but no tea. Then she disappeared for a long time. Eventually the host came to apologize again for the initial wait and we told him what we were still waiting for. He came back with the tea, a fresh coffee, and cream. The server didn't seem to notice that she hadn't been the one to bring them.   Anyway, I had a god good crab cake eggs Benedict with potatoes and fruit. The eggs were perfectly poached and the hollandaise was good, not too rich. My dining companions seemed happy enough with their meals too, though by that point we probably would've eaten just about anything.  Seems like a decent restaurant but we had a frustrating experience."}
{"text":"Tried this place on a Friday afternoon for lunch. I waited a couple of minutes to be seated which was reasonable since the restaurant was fairly busy. The staff was friendly and appropriately attentive. I ordered the southwest chop salad with grilled chicken. The order was delivered quickly and met my expectations. The salad was fresh and crisp and not overly drenched in dressing. This was a long social lunch and I appreciated that the staff didn't pressure or rush us out of our seats after we finished eating. I'll definitely be back again."}
{"text":"You cannot go wrong trusting Daily Dose for your brunch needs. It is an excellent choice any morning and is in a prime location in Old Town. They do not take reservations so try to get there early to get your name on the waiting list (and yes, there is usually a wait but it's worth it). While you're waiting, enjoy the complimentary coffee or infused water which is a really nice touch.   Depending on how hungry you are, try out my go to ordering technique - some sort of healthy egg white entree with a pancake on the side (for your guilty side). I got the egg white omelette with a side of fresh fruit, which was delicious, and followed that up with a side order of the cinnamon roll pancake. IT WAS INSANE. This is a warning, if you like cinnamon rolls, you will love this pancake. And you will feel horrible and super guilty later, but it's so worth it. Plus, eating something healthy before kind of offsets the damage, right? And it's actually a cheaper option than getting one of the more expensive entrees.  The atmosphere of the restaurant is fantastic and lively, the servers are phenomenal, and I like that they often have themed menu items if their is a holiday coming up."}
{"text":"Walked up to this bustling spot and thought shoot, we will have to wait forever. Pleasant surprise to be seated within 10 minutes at the bar (which we prefer anyway).   The service was great! The staff was sweet and helpful. They were cranking out French press coffee and it was so fun to watch. Seems to be popular there.   I ordered the turkey Sausage and Polenta bowl. It was out of this world. I'm  a sucker for white beans and the eggs, Turkey Sausage and fried Polenta are served on a bed of the white beans. Absolutely delish dish.   Hubs had the Flannel Hash and he thoroughly enjoyed it especially since he loves corned beef.   I'd gladly go back for more. There was so much on the menu I'd like to try. Quite the selection of omelets, Benedicts and pancakes.   Being that it's in Old Town Scottsdale, you'll have lots to see before or after brunch too.   Check it out and let me know what you get!"}
{"text":"Perfect location for breakfast before SF Giants spring training game. Also, Perfect location for drinks and snacks after the game. Enjoyed 3 meals in two days and will recommend to all my friends."}
{"text":"Great portions for the price! Had the Hangover Sandwich & my boyfriend had Cinnamon Roll Cakes. All of it was absolutely wonderful & the service was great as well! We will be back!"}
{"text":"One of the best places for Breakfast!  My wife and I went here at least once a week!  Offers health options too!"}
{"text":"My husband, and I heard Great things from the locals about daily dose so we decided to check it out.  We were happy that we did.  The wait was 30 minutes or so on a Saturday which is pretty typical from what we hear. They had chairs outside the restaurant, and also provided free coffee while we waited. Once inside we were waited in by Tonia who is super sweet, and attentive to our needs. The food was delicious, and there were a number of healthy options to pick from which is sometimes a challenge. All in all we were so happy to of had such a great experience.  Much love from chicago!"}
{"text":"Daily Dose is hands down my favorite restaurant in Old Town Scottsdale. I began going there when it first opened for brunch and was highly impressed by the multiple options they have available for the ways in which you can order Eggs Benedict. You can get them with roasted red pepper, asparagus, chorizo or my personal favorite...thinly sliced prime rib. In addition, they give you the option to order them \"DD style\" in which they replace the  english muffin and hollandaise sauce with a biscuit and gravy.   After enjoying their brunch on multiple occasions, I became curious about their happy hour. Not only do they have the most convenient happy hour schedule (4-8pm!) but their menu options are amazing as well. Unlike their morning hours during which there tends to be quite a wait time for a table, there is always availability during dinner time and the atmosphere is very comfortable. I don't think I have ever had anything from Daily Dose that was not to like.  Their sangria is delicious also :)   Some of my  favorite menu items:   Butternut Squash Ravioli   Prime Rib Eggs Benedict   Tacos (any)  Veggie Dip  Chicken Nachos (their salsa is great)   Panko Crusted Calamari  Cilantro, Jalapeno & Edamame Hummus  Chocolate Cake MMMmmm!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast in Old Town. Great local spot with awesome food and drinks. Mimosas have a great pour and I personally love the Turkey Sausage Egg Benedict. If you want a VERY indulgent treat try the Breakfast Nachos**Splitting Recommended**All in all great spot, lunch and dinner awesome too but I mostly go for Breakfast."}
{"text":"Very pleased with the menu, and more so with the taste.  It is not easy making healthier choices flavorful, but they pull it off. Also, good prices."}
{"text":"Food was delicious, nicely portioned, good prices good vibes. Definitely a must!!   I had eggs Benedict with the turkey sausage it was 10/10   I also got banana bread French toast, very tasty! Must try."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday morning for breakfast. Love the misters on the awning, it made dining outside more comfortable. We were happy they opened early on Saturday since a lot of brunch restaurants in the area don't open til 11am. The restaurant was very busy but we managed to snag a table with no wait. The service was quick and attentive, when we were worried there was a mix-up in our coffees our waitress offered to make us new ones. They have lots of fun iced coffee drinks with syrups which we tried. I had the southwest flannel hash with two poached eggs which was delicious and a perfect portion. It was so hard to pick anything because the menu was so big and everything sounded great."}
{"text":"For a restaurant whose name sounds like a Coffee shop, this place was pleasantly surprising.  A very California menu, with cucumbers in the water and fresh avocados on their tacos, this is a fantastic place to get very good food at very reasonable prices.    The service is always friendly, and their Happy Hour menu is one of the best bargains in town.   The Kobe burgers are a bargain anytime, but $3 off a $10 1/2lb Kobe burger in Old Town Scottsdale during happy hour is unheard of."}
{"text":"This is out Saturday morning breakfast place! We get the breakfast nachos and share as that is more food that one person can possible eat in one seating. Great service and friendly servers!"}
{"text":"I went here for breakfast, ordered an omelette with potatoes and an English muffin. When my food came out it looked wonderful and I started to eat when I noticed a piece of blonde hair intertwined in the potatoes. Just a sidenote I have black hair and it definitely was not mine. The service was slow to begin with but I sat and waited for our server to come back so I could tell her and send it back however she didn't come back for quite a while so my husband went to find her to let them know, specially because he was already done with his meal at this time. Somebody came out took the plate and asked if I wanted another omelette, at that point I was too disgusted and I just politely said no thank you. The manager came out and he was polite and apologized and ask if there's anything at all that he can do for us at that point we said no were fine and we just wanted to leave so I asked if we could have our bill. Our server finally came back and we asked her for the bill and if I could order a coffee to go. That also Took a very long time to get to us. She then brought a second check out for the cup of coffee that I ordered for five dollars. I'm disgusted with the food with the service and the fact that they charged us for a cup of coffee which is the principal not the cost. Our meal was $26 without the tip and that was only for my husband's plate an ice tea and a side of bacon. They did take my meal of the bill ( as they should've) but this was A bad experience altogether. I will not go here ever again and it's too bad because we would frequent this place a lot. Never again!"}
{"text":"We went here for the first time for lunch today. It is a great area with the outside patio right up front. We rode our bikes there and they had a small space for them. The patio is great, the food was great (I had biscuits and gravy plus 1 egg with sides of fruit and potatoes. They could have used more gravy buit that's because I am a pig!) My friend had the egg white veggie wrap and she loved it!). The water has a cucumber with appeals to me for some reason. The service was fantastic!! And this was noon on a Friday  in downtown Scottsdale, which is always packed on that day and time.  So they must have read all these other reviews and said \"WTF!\" We need to step up the service! Each of our bills came to under 9 bucks without tip. Biscuits and gravy without egg would have been 6.95. Compared to The breakfast Club, this place gets FIVE stars. Compared to my favorite place in Cave Creek, Oak Creeks Diner and Flapjacks, it gets 4 stars.  Will definitely go again!"}
{"text":"A couple Sunday morning brunch's here, and I am sold.  Other than it's location, I can't say good enough things about it!  The drinks are awesome, the food is fabulous, and the staff is on top of their game.  I've had a few things on the menu, and I've been completely satisfied with each one of them.  My girlfriends that I have gone with rave about the omelets, if you are into the \"egg\" thing. :)  Really though, great place, sit on the patio if you can."}
{"text":"Stopped on for lunch prior to MSBL World Series workout on a Saturday afternoon. Wanted to catch up on some College football games. Got an Octoberfest beer and Citrus Avocado salad (half) topped with grilled turkey. Hit the spot."}
{"text":"They treated me like royalty. As a woman who often dines alone you can be treated like a second class citizen. They were so fast at my request as I had to get to a meeting. Don't know where they found such superb staff. Jessica was so sweet and so were the managers Alan and Jenlyn. What a pleasure to be treated so special. Thank you!"}
{"text":"This place rocks for breakfast!!  I no longer live in Scottsdale and I miss the gingerbread pancakes- they are soooo good.  I am NOT a sweet breakfast-orderer either, so if I  miss pancakes then it means they are truly amazing.  I can honestly say this is the only place I've been to that I would ever order a type of pancakes for breakfast.  They're so good that putting anything on them (syrup or butter) just takes away from the amazing-ness of them. Their omelets are always fantastic, too.  My favorite here is the delicious caprese omelet and I've also had the veggie omelet which is fabulous.  Their breakfast menu is sooo great I wish I could go back and order everything.  Also, they serve breakfast all day!  Awesome bloody mary's, too.   Love it!!!"}
{"text":"Came her today for a late brunch with the boyfriend.  This place is certainly busy and you should just expect to wait; there were only two of us so 20 minutes was what we were told.  I really liked that they provided coffee and water while we waited (although the water tasted terrible).  Once we were sat we were greeted by a really friendly waitress who was very attentive the whole meal, kuddos!  The mimosas here are really great, you can definitely tell the orange juice is freshly squeezed with just the right amount of pulp.  Food took awhile to get to the table but was worth the wait.  I ordered the chorizo mac n cheese and my boyfriend ordered the hickory ham eggs Benedict; my dish was tasty but I felt they skimped on the chorizo, the eggs Benedict was really delicious though!  The side of fruit that came with my meal was enormous and mostly delicious; I could tell that some of the watermelon pieces were beyond freshness.  Overall we had a really pleasant meal but I don't think I'd ever go out of my way to return."}
{"text":"Went to lunch here today and I loved it! It was cozy, my turkey burger was fantastic, and the service from Alejandro was excellent. I'd love to try breakfast but, alas, my time in Scottsdale is coming to a close. If you want simple, well-made food, DD is worth a stop."}
{"text":"I went here last Sunday for brunch with a girlfriend. The waitress was a little show to serve us, but it was packed and they did not chase us out when we lingered. The soy latte was delicious! The veggie omelette was also excellent... of course, it's the \"DD Hash\" I've completely fallen in love with.  I will be back!"}
{"text":"The breakfast nachos are outstanding!  Great service, nice atmosphere, and the perfect place to squash a hangover while watching some college football."}
{"text":"As they say, \"trust your gut\" - your gut instinct is usually right... and while it's time for a DD update, it seems my gut instinct is still right on with this one.  Sine my initial visit, I've been to DD a handful of times, mostly out of convenience.    While my rating is staying the same, I will say that Daily Dose is consistent... they provide satisfactory food and service every time!  Portions are generous and the food is good; it just never blows me away...   One fun fact for you new moms out there: Daily Dose has a very large bathroom area with plenty of room to change your baby's diaper if necessary - I believe there were even diapers and wet wipes provided.  (This is probably because the owner has a little one).  I'm not at that stage of my life yet, so don't get any ideas, but good to know for those that are!"}
{"text":"Other than the limited seating selection for outdoors, this place is underrated with breakfast club down the street. This place never had more than a 15 minute wait time, really good breakfast alcoholic drink selection as well as omelets and yogurt parfait. I definitely love this place; and it deserves a little more attention."}
{"text":"Great service fresh food tasty coffee lots of menu recommendations from staff.  I just love my breakfast food hot.  They deliver.  Pork chili omelette like nothing I've ever had before.  They slow roast the pork and add it to omelette and it was on my table 5 min after ordering.  Lisa was my server.  She was on her game for sure and friendly."}
{"text":"Breakfast, lunch, dinner...you pick it and you will be quite pleased.   Breakfast Pros:  DE-LISH! I've had their egg's benedict, mixed berry protein pancakes, and southwest wrap...I LOATHE hollandaise  sauce but I could not stop eating it and were cooked to perfection...I don't think Paula Dean could beat that.  The protein pancakes were amazing as well.  They have breakfast drinks too which are also quite scrumptious  Breakfast Cons:  On weekends, the wait is unreal...and when you wake up after fun night out in Old Town, you either go somewhere else where they will seat you sooner or cure your hangover with a few of their delicious bloody marys.  Dinner Pros:  Happy hour EVERYDAY during the summer from 4-8pm and it is really good.  Try any of their burgers (-$3 during happy hour) and you will be happy.  Chicken tacos are pretty amazing too and again super cheap during HH.  Dinner Cons:  Can sometimes get slow and isn't as much fun as weekend brunch but if you're with friends, it doesn't really matter cos the food and drinks are great.  Food gets: 4.5/5 Overall due to wait times:  4/5"}
{"text":"Unknowingly, I drive past this establishment regularly on my trips down Scottsdale Rd. The signage is a bit weak from the road making it hard to find.  Upon arriving my party was immediately greeted and seated. Our server Jenine was very helpful in explaining the menu to my party.  The food did take a bit to come, but was well worth the wait. We started with the breakfast nachos. Quite a unique combination of chorizo, eggs, and cheese over chips.  I will be returning"}
{"text":"I find myself bringing my family and friends who are visiting from out of town here for a meal. Their food is good, atmosphere inviting, and their drinks tasty. Each time I have dined here the restaurant manager has stopped by my table to ask how we are doing . You may also find him helping deliver plates. I always enjoy myself and will definitely be back. DD is typically busy on Sunday Funday for brunch, a testament to the restaurant's popularity."}
{"text":"This place was awesome! I've been in Scottsdale about a month now and have noticed that the service is not very good anywhere. The service here is incredible! They work as a team, our water was always full, food came out quick, and plates were cleared fast . Even with the fast service, we didn't even feel like we were being rushed out. The food was great, the biscuits and gravy were delicious, and the cinnamon roll pancake was also quite good. I tried the DD hash and did not like that, but it didn't take away from the experience at all. Our server Alexis was friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots for brunch on the weekend. The breakfast nachos are to die for, love how they come with a side of gravy. Also the cinnamon roll pancakes are awesome and great service. Really the only thing that is a fail at Daily Dose is their potatoes and sweet potatoes hash - both are pretty gross. Not sure why, flavors and textures are just off."}
{"text":"Awesome banana bread french toast, no need for syrup. Tip: get a savory side like turkey sausage to balance out the sweet. Gf is picky about her eggs, and our waitress saw that she didn't eat them and they asked to take them off the check. Great customer service."}
{"text":"This place has GREAT food, GREAT happy hour, and a really nice staff.  And they serve breakfast pretty much ALL DAY.  Pretty awesome by my standards.  The Hangover sandwich is a heart attack between two slices of bread, but it's so worth it.  The sausage is great, and the way the eggs drip into the sandwich...mmm....  Most of their breakfast dishes come with a side of fresh fruit, which we love because we can share it with the kids.  Oh, and the best part, in my opinion- the breakfast nachos...  I thought my sister and I were the only people in the world who ate nachos for breakfast, but no... the people at Daily Dose do it too, and they do it even better than I do!  Unfortunately we moved from Scottsdale, but we'll be making the trek from Tempe to fill our bellies here!  It's a new fave!  My only complaint is that it can be a bit slow at times..."}
{"text":"Recommended to us by locals for brunch.  Great recommendation! Good selection of offerings, bountiful, tasty helpings, not too noisy so you can hear your table mates.  We had an assortment of sandwiches and salads - all fresh and nicely presented. Great place for breakfast/brunch."}
{"text":"Can't ever go wrong with the happy hour here. MY GAWD! Oh and to make it better, it is pretty much allll the time. Watch out for the frozen sangria though, it'll get cha! Take a seat on the misty patio, and service can be spotty, but nothing that my frozen sangria and a little portabella mushroom and brie fondue can't fix.... and its where the best people watching is!"}
{"text":"My husband and I had brunch at daily dose this morning and the food was absolutely fantastic! Our waitress was less than attentive but there were a few other waiters that I could get their attention to help fill my water or get my bill but besides that it was great we will definitely be back. I had a delicious meat omelette and my husband enjoyed the sausage bowl, and we shared the cinnamon roll pancake which was to die for!!"}
{"text":"I've been eyeing this little spot for a while now and finally made it in for a recent lunch. I really wasn't sure what to expect being in the heart of Old Town Scottsdale...you never know what you're going to get over there. The other customers were pretty typical: a variety of tourists and douchey young people recovering from their drunken night on the town. But the service and food were really quite impressive.   Their 7am to 4pm breakfast is pretty sweet and there were obviously many people there for that reason alone. The breakfast items I saw come out of the kitchen looked really tempting and I'm sure we'll be back to try some of them soon. We chose, however, to go with lunch that afternoon and were not disappointed. We started off with the Chips, Salsa, and Guacamole which was really good. We tend to be pretty picky about our guac and theirs was surprisingly delicious. For our main meals my husband ordered the Vegetable Salad Nicoise and I ordered the Caprese Grilled Cheese. Both were damn good and definitely worth ordering a second time.   I'm definitely looking forward to trying out the Daily Dose again. Their menu is huge and has seriously good looking options for Breakfast, Lunch, and Dinner. The atmosphere was decent too. The inside was pretty dark for a breakfast spot, but the patio was lovely.   Keep up the good work, Daily Dose, we'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"We went for happy hour for a drink & some chips and dip. I had the ginger elixer cocktailthat was absolutely delicious -  a mix of ginger liqueur & champagne. Very cool ambiance & friendly staff!"}
{"text":"I think I've found my regular brunch spot. Great portions, amazing food and drinks.. the only bummer is there can sometimes be a wait so you may want to get their early.  I recommend the strawberries and chocolate pancakes or the Cream Brulee Waffles and don't forget the Bloody Mary's!"}
{"text":"The food is good and the portions are very generous. Not a big fan of the bloody marys but its a good spot to go to with your guy because they have TVs on the patio (and god forbid he miss his sunday sports).   Just be prepared to wait 30+ minutes on the weekend."}
{"text":"Average bar food. Extra large servings. Nothing to write home about.  Plenty of free parking and friendly wait staff.   3 stars because host (July 4) was not friendly at all."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with my family. Sat on the patio and loved it. It had a great atmosphere. I got the mahi mahi tacos and they were probably the best fish tacos I've had in Scottsdale. Awesome. Server was nice as well. I would absolutely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Top Notch establishment!! This place takes breakfast to a whole new level. I highly recommend going In my opinion, the Good Egg doesn't never TOUCH this place ENJOY"}
{"text":"This place is pretty tasty and has great happy hour specials!     The 2 high lights of my visit, imo, were the awesome chorizo mac'n'cheese and sitting on the small but nice patio. My chicken nachos were good too but I just kept stealing my friend's mac'n'cheese... next time, I know what to order!  Nice, clean, trendy atmosphere, and our server was nice and cute.    See ya there!"}
{"text":"I loved the bar set up and semi dark atmosphere. It almost felt like sitting outside with string lights at night however, it was morning inside, Definitely kudos to the white light decorations. Pumpkin pancakes were excellent and hit the spot: -) service was extremely slow tho for having 2 tables and we ran out of all 3 of our drink orders, oj, mimosas and water...but other than that it was cool."}
{"text":"Good, but the salad was not as good as remembered.  Still think its a great spot in scootsdale!"}
{"text":"Omg, our waitress Lyndsey was phenomenal, had great recommendations. The cinnamon roll pancakes were the best I've ever had and the cucumber Bloody Mary she suggested hit the spot! Of course the steak bowl is always delicious too. Great service, great food and drink, can't go wrong coming here!!"}
{"text":"Long wait but worth it. Food was amazing.  A friend ordered the hash but very fatty so they accommodated a substitute.  This customer service is what keeps customers coming Back.  Thank you for a great experience"}
{"text":"This place is a great lunch spot! We drive by all the time on the weekends when looking for a brunch spot but are always discouraged by the line out the door. Today we finally made it in for lunch and now we understand the line! I had the prime steak salad which was delicious, my BF had the gladiator burger which we also highly recommend. The portions were large which was also great. The craft brew selection was a nice way for us to try something new and had local beer on the menu which we obviously were happy about. All in all a perfect lunch date and we'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place is not good. I am sorry but the food is just blah, did ppl actually eat here before giving it 5stars?"}
{"text":"Stopped in here after a long run in the morning on a weekend.  We waited for a patio table which took a little while-which we expected as this place looked packed every time we passed it during our trip.    Food 4.5/5 -We shared the hummus plate which was a little different than normal, not our favorite but still good -I had the chorizo benedict which rocked -My g/f had the southwestern breakfast wrap (not sure on the name) and it was BOMB!  Service 4.5/5 -No complaints, server was nice  atmosphere 5/5 -Right on N. Scottsdale ave, outdoor seating was very enjoyable, restaurant has a tidge of trendy/hipster but overall not overboard, just a nice place all together.  Prices aren't too bad either, you get a great meal for not too hefty of a bill.  Definitely going back"}
{"text":"We went to the RnR first for some brunch. However, they were popping and we couldn't get a table foe an hour and a half. Lucky for us because we decided to walk .2 miles to this little Daily Dose of heaven. I was going to go healthy but then i saw the breakfast nachos.  So, so good. I would highley recommend and would come here again."}
{"text":"I will give this place a 5th star even though i wait for 30+ mins every time i go. that can only mean it's good right? Well, it's that friendly AND that good that i dont mind waiting. i hope it doesnt lose that customer service aspect that makes it so approachable.   best sausage gravy in town with a nice spice to it. i'm not fond of their potato has thingys... but their bfast nachos are fab and their white out omelette is also very tasty. my favorite item - turkey sausage eggs benedict... DD style (trade sausage gravy for hollandaise) - very filling as you can imagine.   breakfast club will still be the old town brunch location for when visitors come visit me but for week in and week out sunday morning brunch, this is my spot."}
{"text":"Big breakfast for a fair price! The line is nuts here on the weekends during spring training so we waited until Wednesday morning to go. We sat inside and there was something for everyone on the menu. The kids menu has huge portions as well, for $5 my son got a pancake, egg, fruit & turkey sausage. It was enough for an adult! I personally had the granola, fruit with almond milk, it was light and tasty. My husband had the applewood ham eggs Benedict with a side of fruit and loved it. I would highly recommend this place, but I understand if people aren't interested in waiting in line. The food & large menu will not disappoint. The location is perfect as well and walking distance to everything from Old Town, Scottsdale stadium and the mall."}
{"text":"Yum!  This was not my first time here and once again it did not disappoint.  Went for lunch today and it was fantastic.  Had the turkey sausage omelet with spinach and mozzarella and it was delicious.  The fruit that it came with was all ripe and sweet, which is not usually what I get at most breakfast spots.  Our server was super friendly and brought us all separate checks without us asking, which was greatly appreciated.  Looking forward to going back for happy hour sometime."}
{"text":"Best Corned Beef Hash EVER. Love the bit of zip added by the jalapeños. Why not add jalapeños to almost everything?  Great cup of joe and good service make this place a great Old Town Scottsdale best place for breakfast."}
{"text":"Delicious breakfast!  So many choices on the menu we will have to come back for sure!!!  Bacon is amazing, oatmeal was great, Crab Benedict was one of the best ever, lots and lots of crab.  Southwest wrap also was very high quality."}
{"text":"After eating breakfast at the hotel across the street, found this place, and ate here the next 4 days.  Lots of healthy options here, and I found the power bowl.  Except food and service."}
{"text":"Tied with Breakfast Club as my favorite place for Breakfast/Lunch in Scottsdale!  The breakfast Nachos are amazing! The Banana French Toast is amazing! The Green Chile Pork Omelet is Fan-F'ing-Tastic!  Probably my favorite of the 3!  Good comes out fast, prices are reasonable and the service was great.  If your looking for really good food in the Scottsdale area, you can't go wrong with Daily Dose!"}
{"text":"This has always been my \"go to\" place for breakfast when I visit Scottsdale.  The location and the food are pretty good.  However, this morning I had a negative experience with pricing.  Hidden charges at restaurants are a pet peeve of mine.  Prices should be clearly written on the menu or explained before an order is placed.  I ordered a \"straight shooter\" breakfast that including \"your choice of meat\" for $9.  The waitress recommended the ham and I agreed.  I was surprised to see that the charge for my breakfast was $11.  I asked her why.  She didn't know why, so she asked someone else.  He told her it is because ham is $2 extra.  Apparently ham is not a \"meat.\"  This is a rather unfortunate and dishonest way of doing business that happens all too frequently in restaurants.  I will not do business with places that are dishonest in their pricing because I often wonder what other dishonest practices they might have in order to increase profit.  I am in search of a new place to frequent when I am in Old Town Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Awesome variety on the menu paired with a great coffee menu makes this place my top spot for breakfast in old town Scottsdale.   Recommendations:  Meat and Cheese Omelette Eggs Benedict con Crab Cakes Mellow Bean coffee"}
{"text":"This place was quite good! We went for breakfast and I ordered a mushroom and spinach omelet with potatoes, with the most amazing rosemary creme frishe (sp?). yuuummmmyy!!! My bf ordered one of the big burgers on the menu and said it was very moist but a little bland. The fries sweet potato fries were so good, especially with the creme frishe."}
{"text":"Our favorite lunch spot. The caprese grilled cheese is soooo good. Everything I've had is tasty. They have waffle fries! I always recommend it to people when they come."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a great breakfast/brunch place this is it We went on a Sunday and they were slammed. But the service was excellent as well as the food. It's very fast paced, almost like a diner, but if your waiter is busy someone else just jumps in and helps out. Amazing! And my strawberry chocolate chip pancakes with crispy bacon were delish!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite resturaunt. I have been here for awhile but I have always enjoyed it. I first started going to this place when it first opened before it became super popular and I would go about 4 to 5 times a week. Amazing breakfast and lunch. Hangover sandwich is amazing when you wake up from a night of fun. The Gladiator burger is still one my favorite burgers, pretzel bun applewood smoked bacon just delicious. I also enjoy the Turkey wrap, my go to meal.  Parking can be a pain but worth it. The service has always been up and down. The turnover rate for servers was high in the beginning."}
{"text":"This is a friendly little place we like to visit for breakfast and lunch. Standard American fare but always done in a creative way. Service is always pleasant and attentive. It can get crowded and a bit noisy at times but you're never made to feel rushed. Parking in the area can be a bit difficult. For a small place the choices are diverse. I haven't had anything there that I didn't like. They know what they're doing."}
{"text":"Daily dose has a good menu and decent busy service.   I like the options on the menu because they are not the regular items you find at other breakfast places.   They have the traditional options  if you are interested.   They have outdoor seating for you and your puppies."}
{"text":"Reading the reviews, the 4 stars and along with a 35 minute wait for a table I was very excited going into Daily Dose. Wow was I disappointed! This is not one of those everyone has a bad day review. This place has problems. First when I walk in it really smelled like a Denny's, you know the smell! Our server thought there were 4 people coming so no service after the drinks arrived, I guess there were 4 menus on the table. All she needed was for ask, however lets give her a pass. Now for the real reason for the 1 star, the food, my pancakes were like cardboard, the fruit was stale and tasteless my ice tea was flavorless. The waffles were terrible and the omelets were tasteless! And through all this, the fire alarm went off 4 times.  Let me say something positive, the prices were reasonable."}
{"text":"By far the best burger and...the calamari- Amazing!!! Nothing like it in PHX! We used to find the comparable in San Diego. Having a son that is a chef, we know food that is prepared by someone who cares and Daily Dose certainly does! Will be back ASAP!!"}
{"text":"The breakfast was fantastic. Had salmon Benedict DD style. Service was great as well. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"I've only been here once and tried the Southwest Wrap. The Pork Chorizo in the wrap was the worst chorizo I have ever had in a $10 burrito. I'd be willing to try this place out again, but I definitely don't recommend the chorizo. Phoenix Sky Harbor has a better chorizo burrito."}
{"text":"Thank you to Check Please Arizona!   I saw Daily Dose on Check Please and just had to give it a try. Wow...the bust kept secret in Downtown Scottsdale for sure.   We arrived for lunch and actually got one of the last tables available. We were greeted warmly and our server took our drink order quickly. The menu is amazing! If there is not something on there that makes you quiver, then you must not be alive. My dining partner (out on our every Thursday lunch date) ordered the Grilled Chicken Cobb sandwich. She had pause as it's served on a Pretzel Bun. Oh girl please....hit the treadmill more in the morning! She was \"blown away\" loved, loved. loved her sandwich! I had the Turkey Burger. My felling is, if a restaurant is brave enough to put a Turkey Burger on their menu, they must know how to make it! They typically range from hockey pucks to bland indiscernible mystery substance. Not at the Daily Dose!!! Wow, Yumm, YAY!!!! is what my mouth was saying while devouring this burger! Such a great combination of flavors and yes, it's served on a pretzel bun as well...! The Combo Fries are the best. A combination of traditional russet potato fries and sweet potato fries. Such a great compliment to our sandwiches.   I can HIGHLY recommend The Daily Dose Old Town Bar and Grill. It's good service, GREAT food and very reasonably priced. So when you are near Scottsdale for Breakfast, Lunch, or Dinner, you owe it to yourself to head, no RUN to Daily Dose."}
{"text":"Umm...Banana Bread French Toast. That is all I have to say. This place ROCKS! The burgers and sandwiches are very good also. It is Scottsdale so the prices are probably 10% more than a similar place anywhere else. Great place to grab breakfast before a Spring Training game. Go Giants!"}
{"text":"Visited this spot on a busy Saturday morning. There was a 15 minute wait which was okay but not a lot of room to wait inside, there were a few groups waiting and we were all a little crowded.  Sat at the bar and I agree with other reviews that the service was a bit slow, a lady with dark hair took my order and grabbed my drinks but I never saw her again until she brought the check, a runner from the kitchen brought our food and a different waiter checked on my group after we were eating. I got the fresh squeezed OJ which was really good and a great start to the morning! I ordered the Banana Bread French toasted with potatoes and a side of scrambled eggs. The french toast was very sweet and overfilled with pecans. The potatoes were pretty bland and looked frozen instead of fresh.  My scrambled eggs where perfect. It looked like they had a good selection of coffee, mimosas, and beer. I would come back for drinks and something basic but probably won't order any big item off the menu again."}
{"text":"The biscuits and gravy were delicious and so was the PB & J waffle (a must try). We also had the bacon Bloody Mary which had chunks of bacon in it. Adam was our server and he was efficient, quick and very friendly. Great service and food too!"}
{"text":"Cool setting and vibe, good place to watch games. Lots of breakfast options and lunch too. I ordered the sirloin steak omelette which came with mushrooms, onions, and cheddar cheese a side of potatoes, and their butternut squash hash which was really good. The omelette was just okay. I also ordered a pomegranate green iced tea which was unfortunately super bland and I couldn't even taste any pomegranate which was a let down. I would come back to try a sweet breakfast option as the table next to us got some pancakes that looked really good!"}
{"text":"Fast and friendly service during a busy lunch hour.   We come here every time we are in Scottsdale.  If you come for breakfast you have to try the banana bread French toast.   All I can say is WOW.   They also have a great happy hour with cheap eats and great drinks."}
{"text":"I had the gladiator burger for brunch which was a perfect med rare. The bacon was incredible along with all the cheese on the burger. The atmosphere was nice and the crowd was good as well. Worth your while if you're in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Wow...    The Mixed Berry Pancakes are out of this world good.,,,  My Server Angie was the best :-)"}
{"text":"A great breakfast spot.  Today's service was spot on. I love their coffee and their B. Mary's.   Banana bread French toast alone is a five star!  Perfect location in Old Town Scottsdale and a \" favorite breakfast spot\" 5 star review."}
{"text":"I finally got to give Daily Dose a try after a long night out in Old Town and it turned out to be just what the doctor ordered. We had a 30 minute wait for breakfast around 11am and it was well worth it. The free coffee they offer outside makes the wait a little more tolerable. When we finally got seated by the friendly host we enjoyed a nice outdoor patio hightop with a heat lamp keeping us warm. Everything on the breakfast/lunch menu sounded appetizing, but ultimately I went with the breakfast nachos. It was a pile of nachos with cheese, chorizo, scrambled eggs, and a side of sausage gravy. Not the healthiest of breakfasts, but a perfect hangover cure that tasted amazing. My girlfriend decided she was more in the lunch mood, so she opted for the Old Town Stack, which consists of shaved prime rib, swiss, horseradish mayonnaise & sweet onion slaw on a toasted pretzel sub roll. Also fantastic and I'd probably get it if I was here for lunch. She also went with the half regular and half sweet potato fries which got a thumbs up from us both. Check out the pics I posted to see what I'm talkin' about!  Overall, Daily Dose was a great food experience, except for the unbelievably obnoxious table of eight sitting nearby who laughed incredibly loud nonstop throughout the entire meal. Seriously, I've never seen or heard any table like it in my entire life. Such \"rude and thoughtless little pigs.\" Everyone on that patio was annoyed with them. Not the restaurant's fault though I suppose."}
{"text":"I come here about once a month, favorite brunch place. A lot of food for cheap! Environment and staff are awesome. I've had Nick as a server for the past 4-5 visits and he's amazing. Thanks for always putting your customers first!"}
{"text":"This place is a very chill wine bar. Came here after flying in for work and wanted something that would be light, have a good wine selection, and a nice outdoor patio/bar area. Daily Dose fulfills each of those items.   You MUST get the bruchetta plate."}
{"text":"The name of this restaurant MAY conjure up memories of big unfriendly pills being shoved down your throat after a bout of flu... but I hope that it will now take on new meaning considering the non-flu-like scrumptiousness that takes place here!   I stumbled upon reviews while looking up different breakfast joints in the Old Town area and I was impressed with the many menu options, so I took my friend here on a Saturday morning. We only sat waiting for about fifteen minutes, which was impressive. It's a big place and they have many seats.  So back to those MANY breakfast options: Hello Waffles! Hello Omelets! Hello HEALTH NUT OPTIONS? I am that person who stares at the healthier options at a breakfast joint, telling myself that it'll be good-- or at least not filled with regret and coma-inducing ingredients. Unfortunately, delicious breakfast food is typically sprinkled with these for the utmost flavor and enjoyment. So, with my egg white selected, when the server comes around, I blurt out \"Eggs benedict!\" every time...ultimately failing. (But never disappointing myself!) This time, I decided to take a leap of faith because of the following:   Roasted Turkey Sandwich House roasted turkey, corn salsa & red onion scrambled with three egg whites. Topped with chili cheese sauce & avocado served open faced on multigrain. Served with herb potato & fruit.  OK... I admit this has both cheese sauce and potatoes in it, so it's not EXACTLY an egg white omelet with spinach and mozzarella. Alas, it had tons of flavor and came in such a heap that I had to take half of it home! The chili cheese sauce and corn salsa really made the dish. My friend got the Belgian waffle with the DD hash and a side of their thick-cut bacon.  What is the DD hash? you might ask. WELL, it is butternut squash sauteed in miracles and tears of joy. There are some onions and spices in there too. I will be getting an item that comes with the hash option next time FO SHO. Mmmm.  So the Daily Dose, overall, made me feel like I made a good life decision with the Healthy Nut options being just as delightful as the regular menu items all while introducing new twists on breakfast standards that really pop! I may have to start getting a weekly dose..."}
{"text":"I visited Scottsdale for the first time this past weekend and my friend took me to Daily Dose for breakfast. I was hooked! I ate there the whole weekend because there were so many things on the menu I just had to try. My favorite breakfast items were the pancakes and the hangover sandwich. The pancakes were fluffy and melt in your mouth. I will definitely eat there again the next time I am in town."}
{"text":"One of the best brunch restaurants hands down.  Great food, great selection, love the outdoor seating n coffee/juice bar while you wait.  Staff is friendly and knowledgable about the menu/food.  Great mimosas!!"}
{"text":"Please don't waste your time or your money! My boyfriend and I went to Daily Dose on a beautiful Monday morning and sat on the patio. We waited 10 minutes for water before I approached the hostess. She came back with water and said I server would be there shortly. No one ever came by our table after about 13 minutes. There were plenty of servers walking around but no one ever checked in on us before we left. What a waste of time."}
{"text":"Great drinks, great food, great service! The biscuits and gravy was one of the best I've had! Get the bacon bloody mary!"}
{"text":"Located in old town Scottsdale, this is a great place to casually dine on a sidewalk patio.  The food is delicious! The menu is filled with healthy, yet comforting items, like their DD Hash.  Drink specials during brunch are great - they make their own bloody mary mix that was perfect for a chabela.  I came here in 2012 after a marathon and when I returned for the same event a year later, I was pleased that they maintained their quality of food and service, and their ambiance."}
{"text":"Simply one of my favorite restaurants in Scottsdale. Breakfast, dinner, no matter the time the food is great and the service is above average. Their prices are perfect and they have a decent happy hour. The menu is full of variety and the burger I had was the best one I've had in a long time. Just a great place to eat and I will keep going back often."}
{"text":"What a perfect Sunday brunch spot. Make sure you go a bit early- just to beat the crowd because there is always a crowd come around 10! The food was so yummy, beautiful, and unique. The cinnamon roll pancakes are to die for- they definitely have perfected their craft!"}
{"text":"Wow, I just don't know what to say. I think I will keep this review very short because there are so many things to say.   Great food............but it was the WORST SERVICE that I have EVER HAD!"}
{"text":"Used to live in chandler az till 5 months ago   Few months before I moved back to sf.  A friend recommended that place for breakfast.  I drive to meet him there.  When I saw the line.  I say hellllll no.  I am not waiting 30 min for food.  And drive and find another breakfast place witch was fine.    This past weekend.  I toke my partner to AZ.   And on Sunday we went there for breakfast.  Line again.   And the host say 15 min.   I say ok. Let's wait and see what the damn big deal.  I just hate to wait for food.    15-20 min after. They got us a seat.   The host have a spot on the bar 5 min before.  I say no.  I will wait for a table.    From the min we seat.  Let me tell you whole !   This is worth every damn min I was waiting ! And I am picky person. I know that.    The service ? 10 stars .   Wow.  3 people.  Every min come to look at us.  And make sure we good.  Water.  Coffee.   Just checking on us. It was just wow.  So amazing.    Then the food we order.   Huge plates.  Lots of food.  Taste the best.    No wonder they have such a line.     Next time. I will fu.king wait 40 min for a table there.   Not many places I went for food.  And was so pleased.      I know every one have an opinion but.  How can a place and service like that can even have less the 5 stars ?    Really ?    I am from SF.  We get amazing food places here.   But this place is way way one of the best I ever visit.     Will go there again soon as I visit Scottsdale !"}
{"text":"Only a 20 min. wait on a very crowded Sunday, that's much better than most breakfast spots around town. Really liked the small, unique feeling inside. We got seated at the bar and service was very attentive and fast.  I had the turkey sausage omelette and ordered a chocolate strawberry pancake on the side. I literally could not inhale my main meal fast enough to get to that pancake. I was watching the whipped cream melt into warm chocolatey GOODNESS. Ok wait, let me point out that the turkey sausage omelette was very tasty. Melted mozzarella cheese with creme fraiche...mmm. But the pancake was tops. Soft, fluffy with yummy strawberries throughout. I don't know if it was anything special really, but it was quite tasty. Washed it all down with some orange juice and was one satisfied lady. Need to go back!"}
{"text":"fabulous! great food and great service. I love the peppered bacon omelet!"}
{"text":"We brought a group of seven to Daily Dose yesterday.  Living in Chicago, I am lucky to have dozens of great brunch places close by, so I'm spoiled a bit.  However, DD was certainly very good and in most places, this would be my go-to spot for breakfast chow.  As others seems to have mentioned, the breakfast nachos are ridiculous.  The chips are tasty but more importantly they are solid, sturdy bits that are required because the eggs, chorizo and cheese on top would have broken weaker chip siblings.  A number of us took a bite of the chorizo and had that \"WTF!\" look on our faces because it was so good.  I ordered a turkey sausage omelet with fruit.  The toast wasn't great, but the omelet, home fries and fruit were pretty good (although the pineapple was a little out-of-the-can syrupy, if you are a Dole pineapple rings person!).  Prices were fair for the large portion size and the staff was fantastic, including a manager (or maybe the owner?) who spent some time sharing laughs at our table.  DD certainly draws a crowd in a tight window around the 10-11:30 AM block, when folks are looking for chow before heading out to day games.  But otherwise it seems like it's easy to slide in for brunch."}
{"text":"In town for a wedding and thought good breakfast would be a good idea.  Happened to stop into one of the shops to ask for a local recommendation, which lead us here.  It's a cozy little spot, clean and the staff friendly.  It was busy at 10:30 on a Saturday, but no wait.  The menu has an amazing variety...coffees and cocktails too.  Everything was delicious!!  I had the bacon Bloody Mary and the yummy Protein Bowl.  Would love to come back one day to try everything else.  Definitely worth stopping in!"}
{"text":"Cool little place, tacos are one of the better things on the menu"}
{"text":"Been here twice now and liked it both times.   I've had the biscuits and gravy both times. SUPER yummy. My husband had some sandwich (I can't remember which one but I'm sure it had bacon) and he liked it as well.   I've had the mimosas too and had to sit outside for an hour to sober up, so they're not skimping on the champagne.   Service is good, environment is good. Nothing at all to complain about. I can see us here a couple times a month for a weekend brunchy thing."}
{"text":"The place has excellent customer service. I Wasn't sure what to order, because what I really wanted was a skillet but they did not have that on their menu. So it took me forever to decide, the waitress (I wish I remembered her name) suggested their strip steak bowl. I honestly did not like it. It tasted more like Italian beef meat rather than shaved strip steak. I put it off to the side and just ate my pancake. I was just going to go down the street to jimmy johns. However, she took it back and asked me to order something else from their menu, I was hesitant, but she insisted, so I did. I was very happy with her Customer  service. She was very patient with me and extremely helpful. I'm a very picky eater so I appreciated her kindness. I got the meat and cheese omelette and it was delicious! Their teas are also very good! Although the first item I ordered wasn't the greatest, I still give this place 5 stars because their customer service is outstanding."}
{"text":"We went here this past Sun around noon for breakfast. About a half hour wait, understandable. I think its very smart of them to offer free coffee to the people that are waiting.  We were seated at the bar, which was very nice. I was surprised at how spacious this place was even though its small. My husband had a basic breakfast (eggs, bacon, potatoes, & pancakes) except that he opted for the gingerbread pancakes, which he said were awesome. I had the veggie omelet w/ egg whites. Man, was it a large meal! A medium sized, fluffy omelet w/ swiss cheese, asparagus, peppers, mushrooms, and onions w/ potatoes, a good sized bowl of fruit, and an english muffin on the side. And it was all delicious. It even came w/ an herb creme fraise, which I wasnt exactly a fan of, but I like the sweeter versions.  All in all, this place was worth the wait, reasonably priced, and delicious. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Best bloody Mary's. Love this place. Portions are big, not too pricey, free coffee when you wait. No complaints."}
{"text":"When you decide to have \"breakfast\" at 2:30 on Nee Years Day it's usually hit or miss. BUT, when you roll into Daily Dose at 2:40 and the waiter says \"No problem!  Kitchen closes soon but let's get your order in and then we can figure out what you want to drink!\" You know someone actually still provides customer service!  Great food \"Thank God for biscuits and gravy!\", omelette and Mimosas!  Great place for breakfast brunch or day drinking (they have a full bar with TVs)."}
{"text":"What can I say breakfast is breakfast nothing special. The wait to get seated takes forever and so does the food. My one star is for the Orange juice. Very good. But everything else was mediocre. Service was decent."}
{"text":"This is a great spot for lunch in old town. Salads are good and good portioned. Sandwiches are also nicely portioned. They have expanded so it is much larger now. I had the Prime Steak Salad and it was prepared perfectly and had great taste."}
{"text":"I've been to Daily Dose several times and I've never been disappointed. My most recent trip I ordered the chorizo mac & cheese. I love chorizo, I love mac & cheese, and the combo is great.   The cucumber water to very refreshing and a nice break from the standard water with lemon.   The staff is always helpful and I've never had to wait for more than 5 minutes for a table. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Always so wonderful! I've eaten there probably about a hundred times and i've never been disappointed (and I definitely like to mix it up). The breakfast is amazing (especially their chorizo eggs benedict)! Not only that, but the lunch is incredible too. It's rare to be a straight 5 in BOTH breakast and lunch. They have a strawberry mint salad that can be topped with any protein (I choose Mahi Mahi), and It so refreshing and delicious! I also always get their hummus which comes with some crisp veggies and warm pita bread (they give you plenty, pefect for sharing). I love this place, definitely always top notch service and food!   Thanks Daily Dose team!"}
{"text":"My reviews have been from 1 to 4, but now putting them back at 2. Enjoyed going here for happy hour a lot. Now they close at 3. At least there wasn't a line at happy hour or dinner time.   Although somewhat decent food, some menu updates seem to favor making the cost of the meal cheaper rather than enhancing the meal.   I won't stand in line for food, especially food I can order at 3 or more other locations within walking distance of Daily Dose and a Denny's down the street.  You can do better than this, you used to!"}
{"text":"For the second go around (I had to go back to meet up with some people who chose this location before I could object), I gave Daily Dose a clean slate.  I went in expecting nothing and that's about what I was given...again.  Believe it or not, the staff was rolling silverware again in the same area as my first visit. Unbelievable.  At least this time there was a seat available outside...far away from the clanking.  The service: Since I am a server, I don't bash other servers' \"styles\", but let's just say, our service was weird, not bad, just weird. Lingering stares, awkward silences, you get the picture.  Also, I have been serving for a long time and I still write stuff down.  No, I don't think you're cool if you can remember everything a table orders.  Just guarantee my food gets there the way I ordered it.  This particular time my salad came out loaded with raw onions, which I very clearly asked to be omitted. (I'll let you guess if she was writing it down).  The food: I am ironically thankful for the fact that the onions were left on my salad.  Because if they weren't there, I would have had a plate of flavorless lettuce and feta cheese.  Come on people.  I tried a difficult breakfast dish the first time I went, so I figured I'd order a common Mediterranean salad, just to give them a \"sure thing\" attempt.  Wrong. Yuck. Was there even dressing on that?  I'm gonna stop here before I continue beating a dead horse."}
{"text":"From the beginning of the meal to the end, everything was perfect.  I ordered the breakfast nachos and thy stole my heart. The chorizo and eggs were so good! You can't go wrong ordering this. I also ordered the cinnamon roll pancake to split, and OMG. The best pancake I have ever had. Soft and fluffy and perfectly flavored!   On top of the perfectly delicious food, the water is cucumber water and the coffee is smooth and flavorful. Our waiter was extremely efficient and helpful.   We came here on a staycation & cannot wait to come back for a \"just cause\""}
{"text":"LOVED THIS PLACE!!!  We came for brunch on a Saturday around 1:30 and were seated right away. I called to make reservations but they don't take them over the phone; you have to put your name on the list when you get there.  The breakfast nachos looked very weird on the menu but I'm greedy so I wanted to try them and YYYAAASSSS!!! They were absolutely delightful!! The mix of everything on them worked so well!! I was kinda full off of them but sharing them with 2 other people I was still hungry so I ordered the banana bread French toast. Look, I do not have a clue what kind of bread they use but it melts in your mouth! I didn't even think about taking pictures I was so into my meal. Sorry!  We had champs and got some orange juice on the side and made our own mimosas.  My sister got a seafood Benedict (I forgot if it was lobster or crab cake) and her friend got steak and eggs and they both loved their dishes. My sister tried my French toast and couldn't stop eating it!  I am going back in May and taking my staff out to brunch here!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed this restaurant with a friend, & would definitely return. The food was great, as well as the service. I will say it was very busy on a Saturday morning, so I you want a table you'd need to get there early enough since parking is tricky also."}
{"text":"This is my go to spot for bloody mary's. The house made clamato creole is a personal favorite and they have an extensive list of vodkas to choose from. The staff are personable, helpful, and attentive. Great brunch place!"}
{"text":"My sister and I stopped in here for brunch on Sunday afternoon. We are from San Antonio and are now huge fans of this place. We did wait 10 min to be seated, but I didn't think that was unreasonable for a Sunday. I ordered the Sangria and French toast, my sister got the cinnamon roll pancakes, a close friend got the banana bread French toast, and we ordered the bacon omelette for the table. EVERYTHING WAS JAW DROPPING GOOD. Especially the cinnamon roll pancakes. I wish I could take this place back to Texas with me. Eat here. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"great food, incredible portions.  they also have a healthy breakfast menu, which is great.  love their salads and happy hour menu.   Probably my favorite breakfast place.  Great french fries.  wheat pancakes with fruit are incredible."}
{"text":"Great service and fresh food.   Most places you will get subpar potatoes aka fake potatoes!! But here it's taste fresh and their ham is tender and not dry. Their atmosphere is peaceful.  It can get loud at times but I believe that's due to the surrounding area."}
{"text":"Best place for breakfast, lunch and dinner! This place is consistently delicious. Portions are huge so bring your tupperware!"}
{"text":"After reading the bad reviews about service at the Daily Dose I was still willing to go for lunch today to try out the food. Excellent decision.   We had good service and my banana bread French toast was so good. The waitress did refill our drinks and check on us during the busy lunch rush. There was a mistake on the check that was fixed immediately. I will be back."}
{"text":"Wow, this place is popular!   I met a friend here at 11:30am on a Saturday and there was a little group of people waiting. I was told the wait would be 20min, but was seated in 10min, so that was a good start.   I had the Crabby Omelet ($11.99)-- a hefty red pepper and spinach omelet with 2 crab cakes sitting on top, 2 slices of sourdough toast, herb potatoes and the DD hash. The crab cakes were delicious, the omelet was filling, and i loved the sourdough toast.   My friend had the eggs benedict, which looked gorgeous. I'm gonna have to try it next time! I had a VERY long lunch there -- my friend and I ended up sitting there until 3:15pm chatting. Our waitress was wonderful! She told us that she's had patrons come and stay for all 3 meals, each for a different meeting.  The restaurant had a very cozy atmosphere and the menu had a lot of enticing choices. I spend so much time in my neck of the woods (Chandler) so it was nice to get out and find a good place in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I admit, the service here is inconsistent, but they are new and should improve with time.  The food is wonderful.  I've had breakfast and lunch and enjoyed both, though I'm partial to breakfast.  My favorite thing so far is the Hangover.  Turkey sausage, bacon, egg, carmelized onions and jalapenos and harissa aioli on sourdough bread (i like it better as a wrap).  Its the perfect combination of sweet and spicy.  Great if you are hungover or not.  The salads are delicious and the portions are huge!   My friend loved the burger.   I can't wait to try their tacos.  Thats next....."}
{"text":"They don't have customizable omelets which they should because since they are trying to go for a healthy vibe here. But besides that good service. They need to tell the guests that they do infused waters cause some people might not want their water that way"}
{"text":"Wow, how have I not written a review for here yet!This is by far my favorite breakfast spot in Old Town. I go mainly for breakfast/brunch but I've been for lunch and dinner too and all have been good. Expect a wait for breakfast on the weekends but it's usually only about 20 minutes, and it goes by pretty quickly. They have chairs and water and coffee outside while you wait and you can also grab a drink from the bar. The waitresses are always really friendly and attentive and more times than not when I've been there, the owner has come around the tables and asked how everything is which I really like. I bring everyone who comes into town to visit me here and they all love it. I love their sangria (I prefer it on the rocks) as well as their bellinis and mimosas. All of the benedicts are great except the red pepper one, it just had a strange texture. All of the breakfasts come with two sides so you get a huge amount of food. I also love the Mahi Club and my friend ordered their soft pretzels the other day which I had never had and they were soooo good. Not salty or greasy at all just really, really good. I've also had their salmon and quinoa for dinner which was really tasty. They have a great summer happy hour, and I love their patio. Reasonably priced too. Riding my cruiser to DD for brunch makes for a perfect day in my book! I do have to advise though....my boyfriend got the bacon bloody mary once...let's just say you get about 15 bacon bits with every sip (they give you a giant straw like for boba tea).....not really conducive to a hangover."}
{"text":"Starting to really love the food here. They recently changed the menu and happy hour is all night during summer time! What could be better? Service was really great, everyone was so nice and extra helpful. Only thing that could have been done different is the waitress brought the check waaayyy too early. We were still in the middle of our meal and had half a glass of wine each left, it was strange. Maybe she was just in a rush to get done with work for the night. I highly recommend the chicken nachos and the turkey burger is awesome too. For the side order, get waffle fries. Why don't more restaurants offer waffle fries any more, it's a shame! Well, daily dose does...go get them :)"}
{"text":"Love this place. Their breakfast nachos are the best! My friends and i had Sunday funday here and there double mirmosas are strong and gets you going!"}
{"text":"Today was my first visit to this establishment. I thought it was a breakfast-only type place, so when I saw they were open during the late afternoon I was pleased. Got a great parking spot and we were seated right away. It was also randomly happy hour, and the burgers were $2 off. Got a delicious burger with super tasty waffle fries. Love the pretzel bun!! I was stuffed by the end. Didn't have any issues at all. Staff were all very friendly. Would love to try breakfast here! Can't wait to come back and bring the boyfriend next time."}
{"text":"Love love love this place. I can always rely on a good breakfast from them. Thank you."}
{"text":"Yum. Got the breakfast nachos. A healthy portion. Enuff good stuff for you and ur friends."}
{"text":"This place has some really creative dishes. I've never been disappointed by the fare. Their house sangria is delish. However, only go to this location. The midtown one is seriously dead, even on a Friday night."}
{"text":"NO BETTER BREAKFAST IN AZ. From scrambled eggs to their blueberry pancakes. Top end. Yes, you pay for it. But it's special, like Valentines Day. Just pay out and enjoy the treat. Lunch is also nice, especially if you get a seat outside so you can people watch. Great wraps and sandwiches. Haven't tried anything later here yet. But I saw their happy hour specials and it is on my TO DO list."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! The eggs benny and pancakes here are to die. Great atmosphere also. It's like a hidden little gem in old town."}
{"text":"Three words: Bacon Bloody Mary. We were hung over, again, and made our way out for breakfast. I had the Hangover Sandwich and it was AWESSOMEEEEE.  The bacon bloody mary is... interesting. I don't know how I feel about baco's in a drink. But I drank a few of them. It was hot, sat on the patio. Great sweet potato fries. Friendly staff. Nice Adirondack chairs out front to watch the traffic roll by. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"We order usually at least $100 worth of food for our work lunch probably every 3 weeks.  I have to check the order every time and often things are left out.  The manager was not helpful this last time when they charged us for something they did not include in our order.  He said that to refund me or give me the item THEY missed on our order I would have to drive back, but as you can imagine I needed to get back to work.  Super disappointing."}
{"text":"Southwest wrap was good, chorizo wasn't oily   Pumpkin latte (made w whole milk only because she said it's a pre made mix) wasn't too bad even w the whole milk, had a nice flavor  Two egg meal comes with toast, potatoes and turkey sausage but sausage had no flavor   Busy restaurant for a Friday morning but still great service."}
{"text":"Favorite breakfast in Scottsdale. Delish ish! Great healthy options and kids love the Gingerbread Pancakes."}
{"text":"I was inspired to write this review because I was in DIRE need of breakfast nachos and a hangover sandwich this morning, but alas, I live in Tucson now... and although I considered driving 2 hours to Daily Dose, I was starving.  I needed food and I needed it fast and there is NOTHING here that can even halfway compare to DD.  EVERYTHING I have tried at DD has been nothing short of delicious! I already mentioned the breakfast nachos and hangover sandwich (which should really come with a side of Advil), but hey, sometimes I try to eat healthy and their egg white wrap & roasted turkey sandwich are amaze.  Oh & did I mention they have a crab cake benedict and bacon bloody marys? Holla!"}
{"text":"Daily Dose has one of my favorite happy hours in Scottsdale. It runs from 4-8pm and offers great drink and food specials. In addition to their happy hour menu, they offer $2 off burgers and some other menu items from 4-8, so it ends up being a great dinner place as well. They have a couple of great menu items (including their burger and steak salad), and they have a chipotle ranch that is to die for.   It's really busy for lunch and it can take quite a while, so I typically don't go for lunch unless I have a lot of time on my hands. Also, while everyone seems to rave about their breakfast, I don't think it's great. I've been there a couple times for breakfast and I've left disappointed both times. Maybe I ordered the wrong things, but it wasn't for me.  Definitely go for happy hour if you're in the area, and sit outside if it's not too hot. The patio is great for people watching, and the food and drink is a great deal."}
{"text":"Daily Dose takes great pride in serving fresh food made only from the best ingredients, no shortcuts here! Now maybe you think this attention to detail means higher prices, but let us assure you that Daily Dose is more than reasonable with lunch entrees almost all under $10 and dinner entrees under $12. Want an even better deal, stop by during Happy Hour from 4pm - 9pm during summer and you will find many wonderful things on the menu at a price that won't break the bank.  We stopped by last week during Happy Hour to check things out for ourselves and thought you might be interested in what we discovered. Now we like to think we know a thing or two about Happy Hour but we were overwhelmed by our choices on the Happy Hour menu. Can you say over 20 items specially priced just for Happy Hour?

{"text":"Just sat and getting Americano with honey drink, charizo and jalapeño corncakes, 2 eggs medium. Nice place. In or out seating. All excellent so far.  Wow corncakes. Best I've ever had. A new favorite breakfast stop for me."}
{"text":"Can we all agree that the absolute most annoying thing is bad service?!? I had the strangest experience at Daily Dose. I read the review in the Arizona Republic about the amazing omelette's, pancakes, and overall atmosphere so I was dieing to try it!   The atmosphere is very lounge-like and completely different than most Breakfast hot spots. The owner was very friendly and sat us right away- the table happen to be next to her baby asleep on the booth bench next to me. You know when you are sitting so close to two other tables that it's hard to even hold conversation??   We ordered- I asked for the Prime Rib Omelet and my boyfriend got the Caprese Omelet. Our server (there were only two for the entire restaurant) messed up the order but nonetheless, I felt the food was lacking overall flavor- basic things like Salt and Pepper! Don't be fooled- the food looks amazing! But back to the \"experience....\"   As the owner brings us our food, she was sure to point out \"tell all of your friends that this is a great place to drink!\" And brought us a drink menu filled with Happy Hour specials and things like \"Join us for NFL Sundays.\" So the loungy  atmosphere, with NFL Sundays and Drink Specials, leads me to ask... what exactly is this place?!? In Old Town Scottsdale, with so many Breakfast restaurants, or bars, or sports bars, you need to stand out- pick what type of place you're going to be, and go with it!   They most annoying part of our Breakfast was that good friends of the owner and server were seated at the table next to us- while the two payed more than enough attention to that tables needs for drinks/paying the check, I sat there for a good 15 minutes with out Coffee or Water and a messed up order! It doesn't end there, another couple walks in the front door, and the owner is in the middle of bottle feeding her baby, so baby in tow, she seats the couple.... does anyone else think that's weird?!?   Ironically enough, as we're sitting there, empty cups, check ready to be paid, Channel 3 TV comes in to film the great place- I couldn't help but tell my boyfriend how unsatisfying the experience was as the camera man panned across our table."}
{"text":"My wife and I were on a little getaway up in Scottsdale and decided to stop here for breakfast. It was wonderful. Be warned, the portions were pretty large and we both could have walked out with to go orders had we not been staying at a hotel. She got the crabby, which I think was a great deal since, it had two crab cakes atop an already sizable omelette. It wasn't surprisingly good. It was exactly what you would expect or hope for. No more and no less, which is more than i can say for most breakfast places. I would definitely get it again. I got the meat and cheese omelette. I'm a sucker for smoked gouda so this was everything i hoped for and more. My only criticism is of what this places refers to as the DD hash. It's skillet cooked mixture of butternut squash and sweet potatoes with some caramelized onions. It sounds great, but was surprisingly lacking in flavor. I attribute this to poor seasoning and a maybe a lack fo salt, but it won't stop me from coming back the next time I am in town. All in all this is a great little place with good atmosphere and a fun menu. It's definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"Food was cold & Lindsay said she could replace our cold potatoes and make sure the kitchen knows they served cold food. Awful customer service"}
{"text":"I went to daily Dose on a Sunday morning so the wait time was about 40 minutes. However I  am slowly beginning to learn that if you want a good breakfast at a place that serves alcohol on a Sunday morning in Old Town you have to be prepared to wait a good amoutn of time. With that being said the food was quite good. I got the caprese omlette which was fairly tastey even though that amount of cheese became a little much at the end. Their meals are a good size though and I was sufficiently full (barely able to finsih my bloody mary at the end of the meal.) The atmosphere inside  is pretty cool and the outdoor patio is delightful if you are fortunate enough to get one of their few tables. The last thing is that while you are  waiting, which seems like a life time after a Saturday night out, they offer complimentary coffee and water out front of the door which was nice. I would reccomend this place for sure!"}
{"text":"Meh. There are much better breakfast places out there. Certainly wasn't \"bad\", just not that great compared to what else exists.   Water with cucumber? Bleh. Don't know how people like this. At least ask me first."}
{"text":"Top things to know about DD:  ** Beautiful outside seating ** A menu I'd love to eat at for days ** Breakfast til 4. Yes folks.. 4pm.  I ended up at DD on a day when I was going to make my first visit to Orange Table but running out of time we decided to try another option. We literally saw a sign that said sandwiches (it was really the place next door) and just pulled in.  The menu the menu, oh the sweet menu. There are a million amazing items on this menu that I want to try, and no, not just for breakfast, which they serve until 4 by the way. On weekdays. Did I tell you that already? Sorry, I might say it a few more times. I was torn between a few breakfast options and only glanced a bit at lunch, but it looked very tempting also.   We all I know I love me some eggs benedict, and the server insisted they have the best sauce around so I thought I'd give it a try. Probably should've gotten something else. I was not a fan of their benedict sauce at all. However, they do give you several options for the meat portion including salmon, and turkey sausage, which was what I tried, though it looked more like an actual piece of turkey rather than a sausage.  I wished someone had mentioned smoothies to me before I ordered my beverage too as they had a black cherry mint that I would've loved to try. Also on my list to try.. peach creme brulee :)  The service was great, the patio was beautiful, right down to the sexy tabletops and they even have free wifi apparently.  Not only have I found yet another breakfast on a weekday spot which I am going to frequently drag my coworkers to, but this should be a great place to chill if I ever have that awkward amount of time in between appointments and want a spot to get some work done and chill.  I do wish the servers did more to sell and give good recommendations though... they should stop recommending the eggs benedict."}
{"text":"Love the happy hour specials! Great drink and food selections, beautiful presentation of the entrees."}
{"text":"I really liked this place as it has a good vibe, the service is good.  We got seated right away during the Sunday Brunch rush.  The Bloody Mary was top notch and they even give you your choice of Vodka.  The menu has options for everyone whether you are health conscious or just looking for a fully loaded breakfast.  The only down side was that my friend ordered the breakfast burger and the egg was supposed to be over easy and the whole yolk fell out entirely raw like it was never even cooked.  The manager on duty at the time was super sweet and got it taken care of immediately.  Small disaster but they handled it well.  Definitely looking forward to going back."}
{"text":"Went for breakfast this morning after researching breakfast spots on Yelp. Was not steered wrong. The three of us were extremely pleased with our meals: turkey sausage omelet, poached eggs on biscuits, and cheddar/jalopena cornmeal cakes. Service was friendly and efficient. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Went and checked this place out on a late Sunday morning on Memorial Day weekend and have to say it was pretty good.  We  had driven down to Old Scottsdale and wanted to try something new.  Based on a recommendation here on Yelp! I went with the Gladiator Burger.  The Pretzel bread bun made for a new experience and the rest of the burger was very good.  I did not try the Sunday Sangria but I did notice a couple of people had ordered it and it looked good.  We sat outside on the patio and I would recommend it even though it was a bit on the warm side.  The service was really good as well.  Overall, I would definitely go back when I am down in Old Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I've eaten to go orders from here often but never ate in until this morning. The Biscuits and gravy are amazing! We ate them so fast I didn't even take a picture! I also had the polenta and poblano Benedict. Need I say more? The cheese and hollandaise complement each other and the char on the poblano is awesome!   The reason for four stars is that the drinks seemed stingy. I had a soda and instead of just refilling kept asking if I wanted more. My husband ordered a Tequila Sunrise and it was all orange. We asked for more grenadine or whatever it is they use and it came back the same color. You could taste that something was in there but a large part of eating is visual and this sunrise was not beautiful."}
{"text":"Delicious.  Great brunch.  There is usually a wait, especially when the tourists are in town, but during Spring Training there is great people watching on the pation (which is pretty small). The brunch selection is quite large and you can opt for breakfast or lunch.  The portions are large, enough so that I couldn't finish my food because my omelet was enormous.  Coffee is delicous and service was prompt."}
{"text":"This spot is definitely worth the wait for weekend brunch! The worst thing about this place is trying to choose just one item from all of the amazing options.  Daily Dose is definitely not a secret so expect a wait on a weekend morning. We waited about 30 minutes for a table. The restaurant does provide cucumber water and coffee outside to enjoy while you wait.   The Chorizo & Jalapeno Corncakes were calling my name. This was one of the best breakfast items I've ever had. So simple and yet so delicious. The cornbread pancakes with chorizo and jalapeno were delicious. The cheese sandwiched between the pancakes was just icing on the cake of this dish. Of course to send it over the edge the dish is topped with two eggs. The serving was huge and while you'll want to eat every last bite you most likely won't be able to eat it all. For my side I went with the DD Hash which was a roasted butternut squash. That was delicious with a nicely flavored seasoning on top.  My husband had the Pumpkin Crunch pancakes that were on special that weekend. I snuck a few bites and found it to be quite delicious. The rest of our family also raved about their breakfasts. We were six happy diners for sure."}
{"text":"I had the Crabby Omelette with butternut squash. May I say it was excellent. My husband ate rosemary steak and eggs and he definitely approved. Perfect eggs and crab patty was delicious. The service was good and a great casual place with excellent food. I highly recommend this Reaturant.  Good prices and very well worth the price for what you get."}
{"text":"The hamburgers here are AMAZING.  I would love to give this place 5 stars but their parking is atrocious at times. If you arrive around noon or 1pm, expect to park on a far side street and walk about 5 minutes."}
{"text":"I've been so impressed with the DD whether I've eaten breakfast or lunch. The food is always fresh, seasoned just right and arrives in a reasonable length of time regardless of the time and the number of people in the restaurant.   I've always found the waitstaff to be attentive and cordial.  I highly recommend  the Daily Dose for any meal! I only wish I could bring my Starbucks coffee in with me. :)"}
{"text":"Decided to stop by for brunch on the way to the airport. The food was fresh, generous portions, and tasty. They have a mixture of breakfast and lunch items after 1030. They offer cucumber water and coffee while you wait for your table. Out waitress was friendly and prompt. Would stop by again when in town!"}
{"text":"Came into town for the Phoenix Rock N Roll Half Marathon, and was lookin' for some pretty good eats for my  post-run.  I checked out Yelp for some Mexican food down the street, though the place ended up being closed on Sundays. Decided to walk the town, and saw some Mexican food along the way, but got turned off by the ones that seemed like a \"loud bar first; food second\".   Got close to the end of Old Town; the choices were slim; yet nothing screamed at me. The only two left were the sandwich shop (next door), and the Daily Dose Grill. The crowds and outdoor seating here caught my eye, and even though I was starving, decided to muster up the energy to wait.  The restaurant was crowded with a buzz, yet not too loud, subtly lit in a good way, and had good energy. Being solo though, I was quickly seated at the bar, where I could sit, and take in the football game on TV.  The bartender was perky, and took my order. I ordered the -   Green Chili Chicken Enchiladas - Hand shredded chicken stewed in green chili sauce, rolled in a southwest tortilla & topped with cheddar cheese. at 9.95   Note - I ordered extra cheese - with additional avocado.  The food wait, though, was about 40 minutes; the gentleman sitting next to me had been waiting even way longer, and by the time his chicken nachos came, I almost grabbed a few!  Mine finally arrived. For what it was, the meal was actually pretty good. The chicken tasted tender, hot,  and fresh, and they gave me a decent amount of avocado.  It wasn't quite what I expected, though. When they say \"enchilada\", I'm expecting something a little bit more cheesy, saucy, and perhaps baked a little bit. This tasted more like a chicken wrap. Though the chicken was shredded, moist, and slow-cooked, it tasted more lke a chicken wrapped in tortilla, with a little green chile sauce added.  Like I said, though, for what it was, it was pretty good. The gentleman next to me actually complained about the wait time, and got a discount off of his check! I should've gone that route...  The food, ambience, and the uinqueness of this place warrants coming here again, though because of the service, and my expectation, they get only three (rather than four) stars."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing I've been a few times over the years and is definitely the best breakfast in Scottsdale.  Robbie was our server today he was wonderful quick with the drink refills and always had a smile"}
{"text":"Went around 10:30 on a Sunday morning and didn't wait much more than 20 minutes for a table for 2 (first available.) Very quicks service to place orders and receive food-- a little slower on drink refills. The prices are decent for the location. It's a fun atmosphere and if you can snag a table outside, it would be a great place to take out of town guests or someone really looking to enjoy the weather during breakfast.  I had the Lox omelette- smoked salmon, capers, and red onions. Incredibly salty (which is to be expected, but this was kinda unreal) but pretty good. The bloody mary wasn't my favorite, but then again I didn't try the bacon bloody mary.... maybe next time."}
{"text":"Great service! And food, i had the turkey sandwich (health nut) and we all split the snickerdoodle seasonal pancake. We highly recommend it. So nice eating on the patio in December! We will be back."}
{"text":"If you're a big breakfast/brunch person, you have to try Daily Dose! The first thing that needs to be talked about is how great the portions are! I mean there aren't many places that will give you potatoes + another side + another side with your omelette. Super awesome that you can get 2 meals out of what ever you order! It's also very reasonably priced. I always have a great experience when I come here. Good and FAST service, fun vibes (my favorite part), and their bar is to die for.   My only reason for 4 stars is because I'm not the biggest fan of what I ordered. It was still good - but it wasn't for me... If that makes sense. After trying what my friends ordered: cinnamon roll pancakes (um wow), maple almond french toast (double wow) - my omelette was just ok. We also ordered the breakfast nachos and ummmm triple wow (hope you saw that coming).  Definitely give Daily Dose a try, you won't leave hungry or disappointed I promise."}
{"text":"I ordered the biscuits & gravy, plus a one-slice order of the banana bread French toast. Everything was SO GOOD! The coffee is good. The wait was not long for a Saturday late-morning. Nice outdoor patio. We enjoyed it here for sure."}
{"text":"Our daughter loves this place for breakfast.  We decided to try it to compare with another good breakfast place in Scottsdale.   The service was excellent as well as the atmosphere.  I enjoyed their coffee.  However, we did not know they are known for their pancakes and omelets.  Sure wish we knew that before hand, since our choices were not that great.  Have to give them another try the next time we visit."}
{"text":"After so many review updates, I usually cease to write more unless I have something really noteworthy to add (a new menu addition or fave dish, or great customer service rendered, etc).  Unfortunately, I will have to say that this morning's breakfast of biscuits and gravy and a platter of peach creme brulee pancakes didn't have us leaving w/ happy stomachs :(    There were a couple of hitches, but these were easily amended.  (I think my love affair of DD's biscuit and gravy has ended.)  My major gripe was that our gingerbread pancakes did not contain candied ginger pieces-- did Daily Dose switch to a new mix/formulation?  If yes, please switch back!  The pancakes we had today were too dense and not at all the flavorful-spicy and texturally-exciting cakes we've had in the past :(  The peach creme brulee sauce also didn't arrive warmed, and instead was squeezed unappetizingly onto a sauce dish.  The leftovers that I usually get to enjoy again on one of my work breaks ended up in the trash.  I'm going to go back again soon to give DD another try... I'd like to keep it on my list of fave brekky places!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Great service, beautiful ambiance and the food is amazing. This is my first time going for breakfast. Got the honey whole wheat protein mixed berry pancakes. Relatively healthy and delicious. Even the drip coffee was great. Definitely check this place out!"}
{"text":"My friends and I came to this location on Saturday to celebrate a friend's birthday. We had a party of about 10 of us, and even with going during the brunch/lunch rush we only had about a 20 minute wait (they don't take reservations.) Everything started off well- we were happy to see that their mimosas were only 5.50 for a single and that they were mostly champagne with a splash of OJ versus the other way around. The menus is absolutely huge, so there are options for everyone. Where things took a bit of a turn was the service. Our waitress seemed a bit all over the place, and she also seemed to be a bit on edge and snippy with us. Being a larger party, we tried to keep things simple,  but at the end of the day the server generally made us feel like an inconvenience. The food was pretty good (I ended up ordering lunch and got the turkey avocado sandwich with sweet potato fries, and most of the rest of the girls got brunch items they enjoyed), but my gosh our wait for a bill and then payment of the bill took forever. We were all extremely ready to leave when we finally were paid out, and given the fact that the rush was over at this point and we made the division of the bill super simple we really didn't understand why it took so long. Overall, I'd go back with a smaller party that would hopefully get a different server and some better service."}
{"text":"I stayed in AZ for two weeks, and I ate here about 4x.  Located right between Starbucks and Bank of America.  The burgers are awesome.  The salads are amazing.  The Cobb Salad is huge and extremely tasty.  All items were very affordable.  Happy Hour is between 4-8PM (I believe) and all burgers are $2 off.  So that is a great time to stop by.  Service at Daily Dose was exemplary - my soda never reached half empty (or half full =]).  Great spot for any time of the day."}
{"text":"I have visited here for lunch on a sat afternoon. After waiting for a  very long time , having to ask if we have a server, a kid came up who , i hope, was on his first day. We ordered drinks and lunch.   Caeser salad , dressing on side. add chicken.  I ordered coffee and chicken kabob things.   Dressing came on salad, ALLERGY!!! chicken things came deep friend and gross.   PLUS THERE WAS A HAIR IN THE SALAD.   We had high hopes for this great sounding spot with such a good location. We were very much let down. We have tried to try a different spot in scottsdale alomost every weekend we are in town and cannot say a bad thing about any except this one. very disappointing.   having read another review I may steer clear of fusion."}
{"text":"I love the burgers, sweet potato fries, and beer- but one thing that will get me so uncomfortable that I just can't return to a business that serves wine is when a bartender leaves the foil on the lip of the wine bottle so that the wine pours over it. For the love of all that is good; PLEASE CUT THE WINE BOTTLE FOIL BELOW THE BOTTOM EDGE OF THE VERY CONVENIENTLY LOCATED AND SHAPED GLASS RING ON THE WINE BOTTLE! This should be (and usually is) the very first thing a person learns about opening wine. There is a very good reason you'll find a blade on a wine key and a raised ring on every wine bottle that doesn't have a screw-off cap. Please train your bartenders. It's the simplest lesson to teach, learn, and implement."}
{"text":"They had delicious healthy options, the wait wasn't horrible even during the breakfast rush. I really enjoyed my meal. I ordered the \"smokey stuffed portabella mushroom\" (intentionally spelt wrong) and a chai tea. It was healthy without being bland and the chai was one of the best I've had."}
{"text":"Wow!  The happy hour is AMAZING!  If you're a fan of burgers...  try the Gladiator!  Friday happy hour is half-price burgers.     I fear I've ruined myself from ever enjoying another burger, now that I've had this one."}
{"text":"I always have a great breakfast here.  The waitress and waiters are super nice...food is delish...and I LOVE their coffee.  Love their stone resin tables too."}
{"text":"Went for breakfast shared the side biscuits and gravy and the crab cake benedict with my mom. It was good, if I went again I'd just get the ham benedict the crab cake wasn't as good as I was hoping. Biscuits and gravy was average. My mom got the Bloody Mary and thought it was okay, nothing special. We sat on the patio it was nice although the traffic was a little loud which we got used to.   I would give the toast I started my meal with 5 stars though! Whipped butter with blueberry jelly was amazing!!"}
{"text":"Food was awesome! Crab cakes were awesome.  So was the banana nut French toast!  I ordered the steak bowl and fell in love.  My friend ordered an omelet but it came out wrong, honest mistake. Overall great place and if I'm ever back in Arizona I will def come back!'"}
{"text":"It was my first time at the Daily Dose the other day after driving/walking passed this place a million times. Who knew it was so big inside?!?!?   It was a busy, rainy Sunday morning, and after being turned away at several of our go-to's, the wife and I and a friend of ours settled on the Daily Dose. We were told our wait would be 35-40 minutes, and decided to stick since we had already been to 3 places and were getting close to starving. The wait ended up being about 10 minutes (BONUS) and we were seated.   The menu is HUGE. They have everything you can imagine and a few things you couldn't imagine. The portions were massive, and while the food was good, I wasn't that impressed with anything. Just sort of a great glob of food and...have at it! But it filled my hangover nicely anyhow.   Our server was great, and convinced me to return for a burger at their happy hour. I mean, any happy hour that goes til 8 is fine by me.   I will go back to the Dose again but probably because it's around the corner and they have a late happy hour."}
{"text":"This was a great spot to grab some much needed breakfast sustenance after a night of drinking and partying all night long in the Arizona desert!  We were seated very quickly and had our food come to us very quickly as well which was totally awesome because I was hungry!  They have a menu that was full of delicious options but the Hangover Sandwich definitely caught my eye for being one of the best things they had to serve.  The sandwich itself was oh soooo good packed with a flavor of grilled jalapeños, onions, eggs and breakfast meats what more could you ask for?  The sandwich also came with a fruit cup and some potatoes all of which were quite good and went well with the flavor of the sandwich.  This is definitely a place I would come to again for breakfast if I was in the area great selection and the Breakfast Bacon Bloody Mary sounded amazing as well if your into that kinda thing like I am!"}
{"text":"Best Bloody Mary I have ever had.  I have been here for breakfast many times and it is always top notch.  It's well worth the wait!  Best breakfast in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Excellent food here, chips and salsa with guacamole are really good. Flavor bursts out of the tacos, mahi mahi and carne asada rock!"}
{"text":"One of the best places to grab a hearty yummy Breakfast in old town Scottsdale.  ~ Iced Coffee $2.75 ~ Crabby Omelet $12.50  crab cakes, red pepper, spinach, cheddar served with a side of toast, creme fraiche, potatoes and hash. ~ Banana Bread French Toast $10.50 caramelized bananas, candied pecans, in-house banana bread with vanilla creme and caramel with a side of fruit.  The food is Amazing.  Portions are Generous. Service is quick and friendly.  Definitely, Recommend.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"Portions of food are delicious and huge! I had the Smokey stuffed portabello mushroom \"health nut\" choice with a gluten-free pancake, Apple juice and coffee. Ask for maple syrup to get the real deal...I found out later in the meal. Okay, here I go again and asked our waiter to mention this to the owner...let's not automatically put straws in apple juice and water glass- yikes! Can we have less plastic in our oceans with one small item not being used!?! My friend had the Mixed berry protein cakes - with wheat batter and stuffed with 5 different fruits, almonds, and flax with fruit on side. Huge! Coffee and Outdoor seating so all was a perfect, huge, delicious breakfast!"}
{"text":"Spent Labor day bumming around Old Town and stopped in for dinner.  Got a few things off the happy hour menu: - Shrimp Taco : OK.  Good size, shrimp were smaller, avocado was fresh.  - Chicken Blue cheese slider: huge portion for 4 bucks.  Big half sandwich and full side of sweet potato fries.  Served on pretzel baguette, but I didn't taste much pretzel.  - Calamari:  A knock out.  They should put THAT in the taco  - Guac : Delish.  Great portion for the price.  All in all we left stuffed and I feel like we got good value.  The service was attentive and polite.  no attitude here.  A good stop if you're looking for a local place where you can have an uncomplicated experience."}
{"text":"I really like this place.   I had heard a lot about Daily Dose's HH, and finally met a couple friends here recently to test it out. Funny thing is, the restaurant itself wasn't really what I was expecting but that was actually a good thing. What I mean by that is Daily Dose is actually, well, a restaurant. I was kind of expecting more of a typical Old Town bar/restaurant (which isn't necessarily a bad thing), but nope. It's really just a casual dining spot. When I was here there were people of all different ages (not just 20/30 somethings you'd expect to see at HH in Old Town) & I think I even spotted a few families with kids, and that didn't seem weird at all because like I said, this is more casual dining, not just a bar that serves food.   As far as HH goes, the food menu is great! Daily Dose has SEVERAL fairly cheap options with lots of variety and good sized portions. As far as drinks go (and I should note, at this current time I'm unable to drink alcohol for medical reasons so this wasn't a big concern of mine) I actually didn't think the drink specials were all THAT great for HH. I mean, they were obviously cheaper compared to regular prices and still good deals, but there are several bars in Old Town where the HH drink specials are little cheaper. That being said they have several beers on tap, and a few of which are hard to come by so that's always good!  As far as the food goes, we honestly didn't try all that much. We had chips, salsa, and guac. I liked Daily Dose's salsa. It's chunky & has a bit of (what I think was) tomatilla flavor. I also liked there guac. I'm normally not a big fan of real chunky guac, which is what Daily Dose has, but for whatever reason I like theirs. We also got pretzels w/cheese. The pretzels were soft & chewy, which is what I prefer & I liked the cheese sauce (it had a little kick to it). The one thing I wasn't all that crazy about was the chorizo mac & cheese. I thought the cheese was kind of runny & there wasn't a whole lot of chorizo. It wasn't bad though. I'd like to come back to Daily Dose to try (a lot) of other things on the menu.   Overall, I like this place. It's very casual for Old Town & they have a rally nice patio (w/a nice TV). I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Great service and great food.  Plus free wifi.  I had the crab cakes benedict and the BF had the hash.  Nicely prepared and plentiful.  Our waitress was very patient (I hadn't had my coffee yet so wasn't too speedy with my selections).  Left with a full tummy and brain working thanks to the coffee,"}
{"text":"Husband and I went for HH and also ordered some regular menu items. The drinks were a decent price (hh prices). We ordered the Gladiator burger & daily dose burger which were both just okay. They were both lacking flavor and the msuhroom brie was mediocre. Despite the fact it was dead, we felt very rushed. Hope was training another waitress - I hope the trainee doesn't listen to her. Besides rushing her patrons, she talked down to her own trainee. When she introduced her trainee, she literally said, \"Don't ask her questions because she's new and won't know.\" WOW. I've been a waitress before and I would have been furious if I was talked to like that during my training, and as a patron - it looks horrible that you are degrading your own coworker."}
{"text":"I have wanted to try the Daily Dose since I heard about it last year at a Yelp event. I met up with a friend last night for dinner & drinks, and we chose DD as the location. I did arrive early - around 5 and was surprised to see the place was nearly barren. There was only one other table occupied. Happy Hour was 4-8, so I entertained myself with a $2.50 Miller Lite until my friend arrived.  This is a good place for happy hour - half off apps, $2.50 domestics, $3.00 Mexican beers (although the menu shows Tecate and Tecate Light at $2.50). When she arrived we listened to the server's suggestion and ordered the pulled chicken & mushroom rolls. Basically egg rolls with chicken, mushroom & cheddar cheese with a horseradish aioli drizzle. Fairly tasty and for half off the regular $8.95 price, a pretty good deal. I had another Miller Lite and she enjoyed the Three Olives $5 vodka special by mixing root beer vodka with vanilla vodka. It was a good and interesting blend.  We still had time on the happy hour menu and remained a little hungry. I wanted to try one of the burgers I have heard so much about. We decided to share the Gladiator ($11.95). It sounded large and spicy! A large Australian Kobe beef topped with cheddar & jack cheese, caramelized jalapenos & onions, peppered bacon & red chili cheese sauce on a toasted pretzel bun. Yum! And the pretzel bun sounded interesting. When it arrived it was large, I will give it that. The servers knew we were splitting the burger and already divided it in half and brought it on two plates for us. Big props to the staff. To be honest, I didn't note anything spicy. The bacon was good and crunchy, but I didn't detect jalapenos or anything spicy. The pretzel bun I was looking forward to trying didn't really stand out to me either. I couldn't tell the difference between that and a regular wheat bun. I asked my friend to see if perhaps it was just me, but she concurred.  By this time it was 9:00, and as Lindsey F.'s review stated, that's the end of the night. During my visit a few other people had come and gone, mostly at the bar, but it was quieter than I expected. We noticed that at 9 we were the only ones left and we thought the staff might get antsy.   Overall the Daily Dose was nice. I thought the atmosphere was good, some televisions to watch the games, a little jazz in the background and some good happy hour prices. I wouldn't mind trying the burger again to see if I was missing something. It was good; don't get me wrong, but not exactly what I was expecting. The staff was very helpful and friendly. I will definitely revisit."}
{"text":"Now I've only gone to D.D for breakfast prior to this past Saturday.  I try to stay as far away from the area I work on the weekends.  LOL  With gelato calling my name, us still needing dinner, and wanting a burger than Thai food Saturday night...I suggested D.D.    We arrive and its pretty empty inside with one party of 8 seated a few tables over.  We sit down and wait about 5+ minutes for someone to come take a drink order (though someone had been around with water a minute after we sat down). A few minutes longer and J said he would have wanted to leave.    The water you get is cucumber water, with a slice of cucumber in it.  I didn't mind, but J thought it was terrible.   The gal comes by and we order our beverages and decide on an app because they were on happy hour special.    The Chicken Pouches are very tasty!!! J especially liked the sesame orange and balsamic reduction sauce.  He's not a huge fan of wontons, but he liked these.    We both ordered burgers with the combo fries (sweet potato and crispy) -  Mine - DD Burger w. bacon on the side  J - Gladiator.   These burgers were huge!!!  The bacon was especially tasty and I ate it separate from my burger.  J ate about 3/4 of the burger and said he was stuffed.  But said that the burger was good.  Portion sizes were generous.  And he would suggest it to his coworkers for one of their Friday lunch outings.    Will I be back?  Silly question!   Breakfast or Lunch/Dinner..this place is a winner!"}
{"text":"Fun little place, had breakfast nachos. Wanted something different and let me tell you it didn't disappoint. So good and fresh. This place has fun drinks and great friendly service. I enjoyed breakfast so much can't wait to go back and try lunch menu."}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch based on Yelp reviews and location.  They said a 15 min wait and we were seated in less than 5.  Service was a little slow at first but food came out hot and tasty.  Chicken nachos were especially good along with the Mahi Mahi tacos.  Lots of options on the menu and breakfast is available all day.  Good location as you are right in Old Scottsdale and can walk off any guilty pleasures right after you eat!  Thanks to all the Yelp reviewers!"}
{"text":"I have been coming to Daily Dose for years. This is by far the best breakfast spot in the state, and I am an AZ native so I know. The staff is some of the most hardworking employees I have ever seen, and they work as a team to make sure every customer in the entire place is taken care of. They never stop moving! It is super clean which is always very important, and decorated so that bar rescue host Jon Taffer would be truly impressed. But the best part of DD, is how fresh and amazing their food is. The owners have clearly chosen a menu and ordered ingredients so that no matter the dish, it comes out with attention to detail and taste each time. I usually get the same thing but have come with many friends and have heard nothing but rave reviews. They also serve a variety of lunch items, but I recommend trying them for breakfast. For your first time here I would suggest coming during the week if possible as they have a pretty long wait on the weekends. If you are just swinging by you may like hopping up to the bar where Sylvia or Jess will take good care of you. But the whole staff is exceptional and I love seeing their smiling faces every time I stop in. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This is how breakfast should be done. Great many with numerous options. The OJ is as fresh as it gets. I am a huge fan of waffles, and this might have been the best constructed waffle I have ever consumed! The perfect density, perfect crunch, and perfect size. Strawberry and creme waffle is the big winner here!"}
{"text":"After my wife and I finished our hike at Camelback Mountain, we were both really hungry so we searched Yelp for a great brunch people in Scottsdale. I am glad we chose Daily Dose because we really enjoyed the food there.  It was a Saturday morning around 10:30 AM, so there was a bit of a crowd. Thankfully, the waiting area has coffee that you can help yourself to while you wait. They told us our table would be ready in about 15 minutes, and we were seated about ten minutes later.  When I saw the Breakfast Nachos (served with a side of sausage gravy!) on the menu, I knew I wanted to order that. My wife chose the healthier option of the Turkey Sausage Whiteout, which is an egg white omelet with turkey sausage. I liked that their menu had a diverse selection of enticing dishes to appeal to all different types of customers.  The breakfast nachos were phenomenal! The chorizo was packed with flavor and a little bit spicy. The combination of the eggs, cheese, and tortilla chips was reminiscent of migas. While I didn't think that the sausage gravy really went with the chips/eggs/cheese, I enjoyed dipping the buttermilk biscuit that I ordered on the same into the gravy. Overall, this was a very tasty and filling meal. I didn't try any of my wife's omelet, but she said that it was excellent.   Overall, the food was outstanding, the service was great, and the atmosphere was relaxed and casual. This was the ideal recovery meal after going on a strenuous hike. We would definitely recommend Daily Dose if you are looking for a great brunch place in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Been here several times, it is one of our go to spots for breakfast. Getting them to modify a dish to taste is no problem."}
{"text":"I have come here 4 times, and it hasn't disappointed! They have terrific service and are always accommodating when I bring my 15 month old. They have a great happy hour but I would like to see them increase their wine list. They have fantastic salads and appetizers. Sometime I would love to go for their breakfast/brunch."}
{"text":"Pancakes were fluffy, omelette was huge, whipped butter to put on your toast yourself was a nice touch, fresh squeezed juices were delicious, cucumber water was yummy. Corned beef hash not my favorite, but other meals in our party were excellent. Service was great and lots of seating inside or out. Would go back."}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast and lunch spot in Scottsdale!   Went for lunch last week. Had a Mahi-Mahi sandwich with Sweet potato & regular potato fries. Super tasty and healthy. The Mahi-Mahi was cubed with lettuce tomato's and avocados over a flat bread. I didn't eat all the flat bread but folded it and took a few bites, very tasty & healthy. Then I polished the fish and ate 1/2 my fries.   Then went back the next day for breakfast. Had a egg-white omelet with spinach and mushrooms - and it came with homestyle potatos and a butternut squash hash. One of the BEST breakfasts in months! Decaf coffee was good too!! I think my breakfast bill was almost as much as my lunch bill ~ $17+ so not the cheapest breakfast but I'll reluctantly pay to get my day started off on the right foot and w/ this healthier option."}
{"text":"There is no doubt that this place is one of the most popular places in town.  It does deserve the notoriety, but I certainly didn't like the massive crowd.  I love the cucumber they put in the water; it makes it taste very fresh and clean.  The sweet potato fries are very good and well seasoned.  I enjoyed my burger and I really liked the bun as well. The beer list is outstanding and worth being a regular spot in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Snotty hostess and a rude waitress was the beginning of our 10 minute stay here. Sometimes attitude can be a little entertaining but these ladies were simply rude. We had asked to be seated outside but some genius had blocked the mister with their umbrellas so it was too warm for us to sit there. We asked to be reseated  inside and that's when it fell apart. They couldn't handle it and were clearly irritated at our request. Add a rude waitress onto it and we got up and left.   There are just too many places to go in old town. Why sit through this?  We didn't."}
{"text":"Before hitting up the Scottsdale Civic Plaza for a Sunday A'fair, we stopped at Daily Dose for brunch. It is a popular place as realized by our 30min wait time and the group of people putting their name down for a table. We hung outside near the patio and admired all of the food they were bringing out.   After we were seated, we perused the menu and I decided on the California club on a pretzel roll. I have to say that I'm not a fan of cucumber water, but that's a minor issue. Everyone's food came out and it looked really good. My sandwich was average, I thought the pretzel roll overwhelmed the flavor of the sandwich, and I ended up adding hot sauce to add some taste to everything. This is a really cute place though (much bigger than the outside lets on), and I would definitely give it a second try."}
{"text":"What closes early on a Friday night in Scottsdale? DD does!  Without knowing it, we went there later in the night, not knowing what time they close-9pm.  We weren't really greeted by a hello or welcome but more like look at their watch and a sigh.  We said sorry, \"Can we still come in or not, it's ok?\" They still sat us.   And we waited and waited, never greeted or acknowledged. Waiters racing back and forth never looking our way.  The place was full so not sure if this was their way to get rid of us.  Five minutes later,  we had to ask for our waitress which the one that seated us raced by our table several times ignoring us all together.  The only person that served us was the bartender.   She was the only bright person in the entire place!   We ordered two drinks and the portobello and brie fondue plate.  Drinks were great.  The dish on the other hand was a bowl of what looked like soup, pieces of bread and badly cut pieces of tomatoes, cucumbers and carrots. None of the plate really looked good but we ate it. Very salty fondue. Not enough bread.   Wasn't impressed.  Oh and there were typos in the menu!"}
{"text":"I went with a couple friends for lunch on a Tuesday early afternoon. They were pretty busy. Overall great food, fun vibe, and friendly and quick service!"}
{"text":"Had better service ... Ordered the Stuffed portabella mushroom. Cheese was not melted at all. Waitress was more concern getting back to chatting with co workers. Best thing was turkey sausage and it was locally made... Not on house ... Not worth coming back for."}
{"text":"I haven't been here in a few years but returned a few weekends ago and remembered why I used to love this place so much. They have the best egg benedict in the area. Also, their portions are huge and the price is super reasonable, even though it's in Old Town Scottsdale. They have a really large menu so there's something for everyone and the service is also quick and friendly. There's usually a wait on the weekends around brunch time but if you time it right, you can get in pretty quickly without having to wait very long. Even if you do have to wait, they have free coffee and water for you to enjoy."}
{"text":"Never  had  a  bad  meal  here.  A  true  joy  to  dine  here,  food  is  quite  possibly  the  best  in  the  area. Service  has  always  been  very  pleasant. Truly  a  great  place  to  eat  any  of  your  meals."}
{"text":"If you're in Scottsdale, not watching what you eat, and looking for the best breakfast/brunch: LOOK NO FURTHER! Our experience at DD was more than incredible. Order either the Banana Bread French Toast or the Cinnamom Roll Pancake. Hint: they'll let you sub out the specialty pancakes for the plain buttermilk on the combo orders for a modest upcharge-and it's worth every cent.   Julia our waitress is an absolute gem. Quick, witty, responsive, accommodating. The sausage is fresh, the juice is fresh squeezed, and their special pancakes / French toast are the absolute best I've ever had (and I'm a harsh critic.)   Don't miss it."}
{"text":"I must say the customer service is great ! We  were asked how we were doing by 3 other people, aside from our server. The food came out pretty quick. Looked amazing, tasted even better. Very fulfilling for just one waffle and a side of potatoes. The fruit was very fresh and juicy. It was my first time there and they definitely won me over !"}
{"text":"7:30 on Sunday morning is the time when the Daily Dose shifts from being a serviceable and pleasant upscale eatery to being a magical experience. The staff has had a few minutes to get into the groove; the tourists aren't up yet; the sun pours through the east-facing windows. It has the feel of a pub-like local hangout in a charming urban neighborhood.  This is a restaurant where it's a good idea to settle on a couple of dishes that you can't get elsewhere. The overall cooking is in line with the ambience and price range, and there are a lot of $12-$20/person bruncheries in this region. The major reason to show up is to wallow in what they do particularly well.  My personal vote starts with dishes that involve scrambled eggs. I don't like eggs all that much, but oh goodness, Daily Dose eggs... light and fluffy and NOT greasy and NOT chewy and really quite delectable to gently inhale. The originating chickens would preen with pride at these scrambled eggs. The rosemary steak is a breakfast steak, and it manages to actually be \"medium\" (not always a no-brainer with the thin steaks), and isn't loaded with fat, so I'm quite, quite content with having started there.  Avoid the biscuit. It is leaden and, peculiarly, grilled. I felt that the berry-laden blueberry jam was wasted on the biscuit.  Next time, I'd try the breakfast nachos on the strength of the scrambled eggs."}
{"text":"My boyfriend's sister wanted to have lunch here on her break from work today. We had to drive for a minute to find parking on the side street and walk the rest of the way which wasn't horrible since it was nice outside.  I found it kind of odd that there are two restaurants here and both have outside seating and the main doors are right next to each other? I could see how someone could misunderstand and assume it was one restaurant if they weren't paying attention. Also a women working at the place next door greeted us as we passed on our way to enter Daily Dose, it almost made me feel bad for not picking them or something!  Once inside we were sat right away in a nice booth even though most the tables were full. Our waitress came by and got our drink orders and we needed a few minutes to look through the menu. I had the roasted turkey omelet with tomatoes onions and brie, and it came with potatoes, toast, and I chose the squash hash for the extra side.  Before our food came I went to the restroom to wash my hands and didn't like how the bathroom doors and the entrance to the kitchen are literally right next to each other. First off this is kind of gross. Second when you are walking to the bathroom there are people coming in and out of the kitchen so you are in their way. Not very appealing.  The food came and my plate was loaded. I tried the squash first and it was buttery and sweet with a little saltiness. I was sad to see only one or two mushroom slices, not like the pictures I've seen here where it looks like there are just as many mushrooms as there is squash.  Sourdough toast was alright, nothing special. I asked for jelly and they brought out a container of home made stuff that wasn't really sweet or tangy at all. Just bland.  My two real problems were the potatoes and omelet itself. The potatoes were just greasy and had no real flavor besides grease. The omelet after one bite I noticed a distinct taste of fish! I would say Salmon or something similar. But it was just awful, I couldn't taste turkey, barely even the egg. Just fish. I could tell it was indeed the turkey omelet because I saw the turkey slices, and tomato bits. But I even had my boyfriend try it and he said he could definitely taste fish and there was a bad aftertaste too. I really didn't want to complain and send my food back for something else because 1. I've worked in restaurants before, and 2. His sister had to get back to work and ordering something else would have taken awhile. So I left most of the fishy omelet on my plate, and had the squash and some of the toast.  My bf ordered the gladiator burger and I had a bite and thought it was interesting. It was good but the bun or something added way too much sweetness, it almost seemed like a dessert.  If for some reason we ever come back here I will order something else and hopefully have a better experience. Until then, I give it barely 3 stars!  P.S. The music playing on their website is just cheesy. Jack Johnson? Really? Lol!"}
{"text":"Found Daily Dose using Yelp while visiting Scottsdale last August. Great food and loved the deck. Chorizo Mac & Cheese was delicious!"}
{"text":"I am not a breakfast person, mostly because I prefer to squeeze in a few more minutes of sleep instead of getting up early. However, if I'm on the road, I'll get up early if for the right place. This place was well worth the early rise.  I noshed on the corned beef hash, which has lately become my breakfast staple. While most places use indiscernible mush claimed as corned beef, this place used chunks of lightly shredded meat seasoned to perfection.  Paired with an enormous cup of delicious coffee, I was in heaven."}
{"text":"I will start this review off by saying, I am definitely coming back. That should say alot in itself :). I had a very delightful experience when I visited Daily Dose. This place was packed.   I had a chance to thoroughly enjoy the crab cake omelet. It was mouth-watering delicious. The breakfast plates also come with a cup of fruit (which made me feel less guilty for devouring the crab cake omelet, potatoes and jelly toast).   I give this place 5-stars and highly recommend it for their breakfast/brunch menu."}
{"text":"This is a casual diner in the midst of the ArtWalk path with an outdoor patio (it's not as swanky as places closer to the fashion square). There's a daily happy hour from 4-8pm with draft beer and an extensive food menu. We had the Cilantro, Jalapeno, Edamame Hummus (wasn't spicy in spite of the jalapeno) which came with a stack of herb bread, cucumbers, and carrots. We also had the Southwest wrap -- I've never been disappointed by chorizo and egg. Both were delicious!"}
{"text":"Great spot!! Best brunch/breakfast/lunch/dinner :) Always a great crowd dining here, staff is very friendly. The DD Hash is BOMB!! Gotta try the portabella mushroom wrap, best I've ever had! They serve cucumbers in the water and it is amazing. Last but not least.... fabulous happy hour!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Daily Dose is a fun place to kick back and have breakfast or lunch in Old Town. (I have yet to have dinner here.) I went here with my family a couple of times while they were in town and it has good ambiance, it didn't feel awkward bringing a one-year-old here, and it was a pleasant experience. The service is good and timely and the only thing lacking is the limited selection of sugar-free flavors for espresso drinks. The French toast is delicious, great omelets, good potatoes, and a great veggie burger. They have a good menu and everything sounded good. A pleasant experience."}
{"text":"My hubby's chicken nachos were the best nachos I have ever had. They just tasted so darned good for some reason. It was a plentiful plate and of nachos and a good amount of toppings. I had the bacon and tomato omelet, which was very good also. I enjoyed the butternut squash hash that was served with it.   My one complaint was that the bathrooms are back by the kitchen and  this kitchen is kind of opened and it seemed like there was a foul smell coming from the kitchen. Not sure, maybe it was the bathrooms, the bar is right in that vicinity also, so maybe it was the bar. Reminded me of my days spent in the bars of Chicago. There was always this damp, yucky smell that seemed to permeate some of the old local watering holes; and this scent was similar. I am just glad that I visited the restroom after eating my meal and not before."}
{"text":"Had brunch here a few weekends ago. Surprisingly there was no line, and we got our food incredibly fast! The food was good, and the service was quick. The restaurant itself wasn't anything overly unique, just kind of felt like a diner, but again because of the good food and service I would go back. Give it a shot, especially if there is no line!"}
{"text":"I came here to meet a friend for brunch.   Customer service was great our waitress was really kind and helpful. I noticed maybe the manager or owner I'm not so sure was on the floor walking around and interacting with the customers. He came by and asked if everything was good. I truly like when either the owner/manager is interacting with its customers.   I ordered smoked salmon eggs Benedict which came with potatoes. However, one pile of potatoes was different from the other?  I really liked the house potatoes but the other potatoes I want to say maybe it was their hash potatoes were by far my least favorite part of the dish. They were too sweet and soggy for my taste. The eggs Benedict were delicious! I would definitely come back for that alone.   I also ordered a Moscow mule which was pretty delicious. But I kind of didn't appreciate how they ask to keep your id as leverage so you won't \"steal\" their Moscow mule cup?  That was kind of odd, I totally understand they probably get high theft or something but you can choose a different alternative such as buying cheaper cups if it's really hurting your business that much. Rather than making their customers feel untrustworthy. That was probably the only downside of this place.    In other news, My friend ordered a Bloody Mary and I took a sip and it was so yummy next I will order that instead.   This place can be easily missed if you aren't familiar with the area so keep those eyes open!   Their menu was simple and easy to read. Huge plus!"}
{"text":"My favorite place during our trip to Arizona.  Stopped by for breakfast and got the breakfast nachos.  INCREDIBLE! Who knew nachos could be so awesome with scrambled eggs and chorizo!  Also tried the banana bread french toast, really great too."}
{"text":"I saw a line outside and we were in Old Town looking for a breakfast joint so why not?! We called several other places and the wait was over an hour. So we decided to just stop here.  There was definitely a 20-30 minute wait on a Sunday morning.. Which is fine considering the place had awesome reviews. However when we sat down, the inside wasn't packed at all. There were quite a few tables opened actually.. So not sure why they kept everyone outside waiting.  The service was good.. Our server was nice and friendly.  The restaurant was clean.  I ordered the pumpkin latte and it was delicious!  But that's all.. The food was mediocre.  The chorizo Mac and cheese was spicy.. Nothing special about the flavors. The noodles felt a little over cooked and too soft.  There wasn't a great cheesy combo or flavor.. It just tasted like a chili mixed with noodles.  I wanted to try two different things and the waitress recommended I order one side of each so I could try both.. Glad I did because boy the side was huge! I had the banana bread French toast.. Big slice of banana bread.. With banana and pecans on top.  It tastes like it looks.. Soft and dense. Banana bread.. Nothing special.  The crunchy pumpkin pancakes was the other thing I wanted to try.. Super big pancake! As big as a large plate.  Again it was flat.. Doughy.. Not light and fluffy like I expected.  I think I liked this better out of the two but they both didn't stand out to me.. I was disappointed in how high it was rated for what I ordered and tried.  Probably wouldn't come back here."}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots for breakfast in Old Town! I always recommend it to customers. They've only forgotten an item or two before but have always brought it out immediately and apologetically. Staff is great. Coffee drinks are amazing. Turkey sausage is delicious. Oatmeal is top notch. Protein pancakes are one of my favorites. Gotta try this place if you haven't yet!"}
{"text":"I just recently returned here since moving away from AZ. I was thrilled to see there were many vegetarian options that included tempeh! I had the tempeh\"burrito\", which definitely appeared more like a wrap. It was enjoyable and light. I ordered the spicy bloody mary, which was amazing. My husband ordered the regular bloody and was not satisfied. We would certainly return here for breakfast, as their options are endless."}
{"text":"After our RnR visit was a fail, we settled for Daily Dose and I am glad we did! My study group and I were going to have study session Sunday, but in order to get our thinking caps on, we needed food first.  We were seated at a high top table and greeted by our waitress promptly. We ordered two bloody Mary's and a lame-o ordered a diet coke. I chose the Bloody Mary with cucumber vodka upon the servers recommendation. Boy, did she screw me over...it wasn't good. Actually, even the regular one wasn't good. So..I got a michelada! YAS! which was so much better!  Food time! As our appetizer, we ordered the chicken nachos...BEST NACHOS EVER!!! so many ingredients, and cheese ( I LOVE cheese!), and this cheese sauce that was a little spicy but so good! mmmmm!  I got the turkey sausage omelet and added mushrooms to it. It came with a side of seasons potatoes and your choice of butternut squash hash, cottage cheese, or fruit. Well I asked for the servers recommendation (I am extremely indecisive), and she said the butternut squash was good. Once again, she screwed me over because I hated it. Everything else was excellent! The potatoes had the perfect amount of seasoning and were cooked to a crisp. The omelet was exploding with flavor.  I don't remember what my friends got but they were pretty happy with their choices. We were all in food coma shortly after. Our plates were not even half eaten before we stopped eating because it was THAT much food. As much as we hated to stop eating, we had to or else the rest of the day would have been bad.  The prices are really good here! So much food for like $10.00! Cant beat that!  Service was good, I just wish my server had better taste in food.  I will be coming back fa sho!"}
{"text":"My mom and I stopped into Daily Dose after reading a couple of good reviews off of Yelp! We were super excited to have a delicious breakfast together before I left town. When we arrived the staff were helpful, attentive, kind and welcoming! The decor of the place is perfect for a breakfast/bar place. While we waited to be sat there was complimentary coffee which definitely made waiting more bearable. When we were finally sat, our server was super kind! My mom order huevos rancheros which to her were sub par. It came with a tortilla which we weren't quite sure what to do with considering the bulk of the meal was a bit soupy. I ordered the tavern hams eggs Benedict. The hollandaise sauce was delicious and the eggs were cooked perfectly! But the potatoes that came with the meal were not my cup of tea. They used Rosemary in the seasoning which is not something I enjoy. We both left a bit hungry. While our experience with the staff was great, the food was not!"}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast in Scottsdale  The mixed berry protein pancakes cause me to break my low carb diet and never regret it for a second. The bacon is perfection. The corned beef hash with its jalapeños is perfectly southwestern and delicious. The service is quite good- but expect to wait a while, especially on weekends.   I'm less enthusiastic about the not breakfast options. The strawberry salad is good, but like most of their salads a bit too sweet. And I'm not a huge fan of their drinks, however my husband loves the bloody marys.   The outdoor, now DOG FRIENDLY, patio is my favorite thing about the Scottsdale location. Always new dogs to pet. This is a solid bet for breakfast and worth the wait."}
{"text":"I've been to The Daily Dose five times. Whenever I visit family in Phoenix, I insist on going. The portions are large, the selections are interesting, the execution good, and the service left little to be desired for. My fifth visit, however, will likely be my last, at least until I give other breakfast places a try. I'm not one to bone-pick about a restaurant being out of a certain menu item (even though, having worked in lots of restaurants, I should sink my teeth into them), but it was more logic, or lack thereof, that makes me want to share the explanation that was given for being out of the gingerbread pancakes. See, they were for Halloween and were replaced by snickerdoodle pancakes. My visit having taken place on December 22, I must have been crazy to think they would have gingerbread three days before Christmas, or that it would be a business strategy to extend their availability through the Christmas season.  I'm a culinary pioneer, so I ordered the snickerdoodle replacement, also at the recommendation of the server. I hate using superlatives, unless I'm talking about Michael Jordan or Bob Dylan, but these were the worst pancakes I have ever had! They were bone-dry, tough, flavorless, with the exception of the bitterness coming from the excessive amount of ground spices in the batter. Snickerdoodle cookies are the ones sprinkled liberally with cinnamon and sugar. The cook at The Daily Dose must not be aware of the desiccant properties of spices. I refer him/her, then, to the \"Cinnamon Challenge.\" Like the ice bucket challenge, the lesser known cinnamon challenge calls on the highly suggestible individual to eat a spoonful of cinnamon...the spice quickly dries out the mouth and can cause asphyxiation. I didn't choke on my pancakes because I chased them with the tepid coffee refills I got after waiting with an empty cup. But the fact that I, renowned (amongst my friends and family) for being able to down sickening quantities of food, left nearly two of the three pancakes on my plate, waving the white flag, tells you that they were bad. The over-spicing completely dried them out, and the frosting on top, laced with more spices, could not compensate.   It was an unfortunate experience to be served lukewarm coffee, intermittently, and to have a bad meal all in the same visit. My company that morning, ordering eggs Benedict, was faced with undercooked egg white, a food touted by cooks to be one of the most disgusting things one can serve.   It was unfortunate, more for the restaurant than me, for all of these mishaps to happen on the same visit. I align my expectations with the self-proclaimed reputations of restaurants and the fare they serve. If you're a breakfast place that screws up pancakes, it is time to 'take the whole thing back to formula'."}
{"text":"Love, love, love this place!!!  Great food - huge portions - creative cocktails - eclectic wine list - good beer selection - great service every time... if you can navigate around some of the occasional Scottsdale \"Riff-raff\" - you will be in good shape.  I recommend getting there early - especially for Saturday and Sunday brunch... it's a hot spot and the wait can be a bit long.  The positive?  They always put out cucumber water and coffee for those of us anxiously waiting for a table."}
{"text":"Surprising lunch find in Old Town Scottsdale.  Awesome kids menu + yummy, fresh salads.  Much better than the other more touristy options in that area."}
{"text":"Great food, great service- very family oriented. We LOVE that there are so many gluten free options: Gluten free buns, pancake batter, and salads. And to be able to order lunch or breakfast is a win! We'll definitely be going back!!"}
{"text":"I came here with my friend and ordered their crab cake eggs Benedict, banana bread French toast and chorizo eggs Benedict. I love how they give you cucumber water and I loved how the food tasted! So full of flavors and so delicious!! The French toast looked like it would be super sweet but it tasted light and I loved the sugared pecans! Service was great and the food came out pretty fast."}
{"text":"The first time was so good, we had to come back!  The Peach Creme Brulee pancakes wowed my partner both times... something totally addicting about the crunchy edges.  Their Daily Dose Hash is a delicious blend of sweet potatoes and onions, with so much more, making me wish I had the recipe.  The omelets are good, it's just that I want them to be better, to the point where I have to have them again.  Both the Caprese omelet and the Bacon omelet tasted like the listed ingredients were put into the omelet.  That is different from making the combination of ingredients to a whole delicious oneness.   I'm going to go for the French Toast next time.  The service the first time was a 10+ out of 10, with the 7am server being very friendly, very helpful and made the whole experience even better.  This past Weds morning, it was good, nice, perfect service and friendly... about a 9.  I really like this place and I'm going to go back a few more times to find the best dish."}
{"text":"I've been here at least two dozen times over the years and each time has been an excellent experience. The one and only time I had a slightly less excellent experience, they went the extra mile for me:  During my most recent visit, I ordered steak (medium well) and some eggs, but the steak came out rare. I didn't fuss at all, just asked that my server have it cooked a little more. The manager came by to apologize, but I told him it was no issue at all. Several minutes later, he came back with a new, full plate of food and again apologize.  I highly recommend Daily Dose to anyone who loves brunch/breakfast food, great cocktails, and an amazing staff."}
{"text":"Nothing spectacular, but no horrible complaints. The bartender was attentive but not overly friendly. The drinks were average and we did not try any of the food, but It looked good. Wouldn't recommend, but would come back to try again"}
{"text":"One of my favorite breakfast spots in Scottsdale! Food is always fantastic and love the outdoor patio! Five stars to this establishment!"}
{"text":"After 5 years of great service and food, my last visit was horrible. I loved the Turkey burger in the past, this time they changed the bun to some low quality bun when it used to be a pretzel bun. The onions were the worst I have ever had. They used like a cornmeal breading. I recommend this place to everyone I know, but it appears that things have changed. I was going to say it was just an off day, but the menu changes and other things lead me to believe it isn't. If I get brave, I may try the Midtown location to see if it hasn't changed but have a feeling it has. On top of it my stomach was upset for a day afterwards. I am willing to pay good prices for good food."}
{"text":"My cousin, Tiffany F, recommended this place as one of the local gems to check-out while in Scottsdale. Man, I am so glad we headed to this spot after her wedding bash. This place had absolutely amazing (hangover) food.   I had to put a \"little hair of the dog\" and started off our visit with an Absolut Peppar Bloody Mary filled with yummy garnishes such as olives, lime, lemon, and cucs. I had such a hard time ordering and finding out what I wanted that Mom and I split a sweet and savory dish. We opted for the Blue Crab Benedict and the Peach Creme Brulee pancackes. Holy schnikes...it was amazeballs. Fresh grilled peaches nesteled between two fluffy pancakes with a creamy vanilla anglaise and fresh whipped cream. OMG it was delectable. The blue crab was fresh, sweet, and paired wonderfully with the creamy hollandaise sauce. It was perfection. My pancakes came with a choice of fresh fruit, DD hash, etc. I chose the DD hash (i.e. butternut squash perfectly seasoned); I, at first, was a bit concerned thinking it was corned beef hash. However, I was not that disappointed because the flavors of rosemary, paprika, and other flavors brought out the delicious flavors of the roasted squash.  I definitely will go back to Daily Dose when I'm in town. It's nestled in Old Towne, which is a fascinating part of town."}
{"text":"Excellent fluffy omelettes filled with lots of good vegetables/meats/cheese and lots of choices in menu. Gluten-free yummy bread too.  Nice fast service.   This is a cute place.  We went back a second time while on our trip to Scottsdale.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We had an excellent breakfast yesterday morning. The service is great and the manager stopped by every table to see how we were. The food was excellent. My husband had an omelette and I had a chicken sandwich. Both were excellent and the sweet potato fries were the best I have ever had. They are kid friendly and have a wonderful kids menu. My daughter loved her egg and pancake and she is a picky eater. Excellent choice if you are looking for a big breakfast/brunch in Scottsdale. We didn't try the drinks but the drink menu and bar were servicing some beautifully presented drinks with lots of garnish. I hope to come back to try these soon. Really glad we found his place!"}
{"text":"Breakfast nachos are to die for! I recommend sharing them, it's a healthy serving for one person. I make sure to stop here for the nachos every time i am in old town!"}
{"text":"Went for brunch before a movie.  Crowded, but we sat at the bar without a wait.  Friendly, efficient staff.  My only complaint was the eggs benedict I ordered took too long to be served which resulted in overcooked eggs and lukewarm temperature. Even when you're crowded - orders should be served when they are ready - or perhaps the kitchen didn't signal it was ready.  Not sure who to blame, but it could have been better."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast and lunch. They have descent portions for good prices. The service is also great every time that I've gone here. I especially enjoy their coffee !"}
{"text":"Awesome!! Worth the wait for a table. Soft pretzels with cheese and mustard were excellent. We also shared a club sandwich and fries which we really liked a lot. Service was prompt, coffee was delicious, and so were the bloody Mary's. Have been there twice already and would certainly recommend it."}
{"text":"We won a gift certificate and decided to try out Daily Dose for lunch. The food was just alright, nothing to write home about. My husband had the Kobe burger and I had the chicken tacos. The service however was excellent; my order didn't come out the way I was expecting, and they remade it for me no problem, and were very happy to do so. We may or may not come back again, we were honestly hoping for some tastier food, so we'll see."}
{"text":"This place is always worth the drive for me. I do suggest coming early because parking can get crazy especially on a busy weekend morning.   I've only had a simple breakfast platter, Breakfast Nachos, and their original Eggs Benedict. The Eggs Benedict is the best I've ever had. I have no idea what they put in their hollandaise since it's so addicting. To top it all off, they give you a huge cup of coffee rather than the miniature ones at every other restaurant. I don't know about you, but a giant cup of coffee is needed every morning during breakfast! If you aren't a fan of Eggs Benedict then try their Breakfast Nachos. It's heavenly."}
{"text":"It was good, but not one of those places I'd crave to go back to. Patio is a little cramped, so expect a wait on a nice day.    I had the protein pancakes... They were good and the serving was HUGE - expect to box half of it up.  My husband had the chorizo omelet and said it was 'alright'.  Oh, and they have some decent local crafts on tap too."}
{"text":"I ate here with a friend who likes Daily Dose a great deal and said they had excellent salads. I ordered the Mediterranean salad with added grilled chicken. I have to say, it really was top notch. You get a lot for the money and it had a great taste. I had them mix the dressing in, too, but they didn't go crazy and add too much.  The atmosphere at lunch was quite nice. Bustling, but with a few empty tables about.   The service wasn't quite there, though. It took a long time for our order to be taken, and brought out, but the really long wait was afterward. We waited a solid ten minutes for our ready check to be picked up as the waitress walked by several times. We even waved to get her attention. Maybe she was tired. We all have those days."}
{"text":"My friends and I went to the Daily Dose 2 times during our 4 day stay in Scottsdale.  I ate from their Health Nut menu both times and I was pleased.  If you are watching your calories, I recommend the Roasted Turkey Sandwich and as a 2nd choice the Turkey Sausage and White Out.  I like that they have beverages outside while you wait (and the wait can be long on a weekday morning).  Service was pleasant and fast.  No complaints from me."}
{"text":"People always say that some of the best things they have experienced are run by people who have a passion for their product. That is what sets the Daily Dose apart from other Old Town food spots. Both the restaurant manager and head chef are there all day everyday making sure every meal is great.   Now the Daily Dose as a number of things going for it: 1. They are one of the only breakfast spots in Old Town. The breakfast is always good and creative...I mean they have breakfast nachos!  2. They have great food other than breakfast. Typically when you have a restaurant that does breakfast their other food suffers. Not at the Daily Dose! Their Turkey Burger on the pretzel bun is incredible. Also if you have always wanted to try a veggie burger but just don't think you will like it don't hesitate at  DD. Their Veggie Burger is great!  3. Maybe the biggest selling point Happy Hour 7 days a week!   One quick tip if you are heading there on a weekend for breakfast make sure you are ready to wait at least 30 minutes. The Daily Dose is and will continue to be a go to spot for breakfast, lunch and dinner for me!"}
{"text":"Very good experience! We had a 7:00AM office meeting and wanted to serve DD but they open at 7. The manager allowed us to email our order the night before and the cooks started on it as soon as they came in so it was ready shortly after opening. Excellent food and customer service!"}
{"text":"Attention: if you enjoy amazing black coffee please make a stop at this spot ASAP! It is an absolute favorite. Everything on the menu is tasty but make sure to get a one piece side order of their banana bread French toast. You are welcome.   Wonderful staff and super cozy place. Definitely worth the wait on the weekends"}
{"text":"Very good breakfast joint! We shared the breakfast nachos and a few drinks to start our Saturday off! The nachos were GREAT! I've never had breakfast nachos before and was very pleased :). The drinks are also great and the staff is wonderful."}
{"text":"Wow this place is good, for breakfast at least. Took a sick day from work and decided to take a nice bike ride through old town with my bf and came across Daily dose. We were seated immediately outside on the patio and the staff was very nice. Every waitress that passed us asked if we had our drink order taken yet, although it was repetative it was being thorough. I love that they serve cucumber water and their orange juice is hand squeezed too. I ordered the southwest flannel hash, which was a wonderful, flavorful take on the classic corned beef hash. I loved this dish sooo much, I don't know if I would be able to order anything else on my future visits. The meat was cooked so well, along with the potatoes, tomatillos and onions. It came with 2 perfectly cooked and seasoned eggs and one of the best quality white toast I've had. The butter was even impressive and spread so easily. My bf got the chorizo omelet with potatoes and it was really good too. The waitress was very friendly and made sure to check on us consistantly. We saw that they have a great sounding happy hour and plan to come back and give it a try! I would recommend Daily Dose for breakfast!"}
{"text":"This place definitely gives you a bang for your buck. In downtown Scottsdale, parking sucks but other that I thoroughly enjoyed this place. For only like $10 you get the ultimate breakfast, and it's good! We ordered omelettes and they were made well and came with potatoes, toast, and your choice of fruit/cottage cheese/ or something else (i forget sorry). But definitely recommend this place for breakfast, although it seems like a drinking place they have really good food. The only thing negative I would say is that the food took really long to get to us (especially for breakfast food), but it was good when it came and our waitress was really awesome and kept checking on us until it did!"}
{"text":"I had a really great little breakfast one morning at Daily Dose. It wasn't anything mind-blowing, but it gave me a healthy start to my day and was reliable.  The service was friendly (although a few times we were wondering where our waitress was), and I was thankful to have a decent cup of coffee sitting in front of me. After much pondering of the menu which is absolutely huge, I decided to go the healthy route & order the egg white wrap. For $9.99, you get the wrap with bell peppers, mushroom & spinach in a chipotle tortilla, served with pico de gallo, herb potatoes and fruit. The wrap was okay but the pico was completely necessary to add any flavor. The fruit was surprisingly good, but the potatoes tasted so strongly like herbs that it was hard to really enjoy them.  Here's the thing... not everything needs to be a five-star meal. This spot is convenient for breakfast AND you can get something healthy, which I value a great deal. While I won't be dying to come back here, I wouldn't rule it out as a breakfast option the next time I'm in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Daily Dose Definitively Delivered Downright Deliciousness.  While sitting on the patio with a fubar of Yelpers I kept seeing the \"DD\" logo with it's overlapping D's and red background and thinking it looked really familiar.  Isn't that the logo for the Marvel comic DareDevil?  You remember that right?  Occasional guest in the Spiderman series, subject of yet another godawful Ben Affleck movie?  That DareDevil?  So these folks provided outstanding service (Thanks Tina!-she remembered every person by first name and even caught on when I was trying to slip my charges under Brian's name) and excellent food!  The Yelper special was a great bonus!  Thanks to Donald S for hooking up the UYE and the special with the owner!  I'm sure we made up for any loss from the special with lots of alcohol.  The burger (.5 Kobe beef, .5 high quality other beef) was really good and the pretzel style bun was a nice touch."}
{"text":"Who wouldn't want breakfast nachos? I know there's a hangover sandwich on the menu, but the nachos did the trip for me. They were so big that I actually took half of it home and had leftover round 2 nachos the next morning. Maybe soggy nacho chips weren't the best idea but I couldn't let them go to waste, right?  The bacon Bloody Mary was good as well but make sure to eat the bacon strip fast before it becomes water logged and limp.  To round out our healthy meal we had the chorizo mac and cheese, which was as good as it sounds.   The best part of the Daily Dose is the coffee canisters outside for those waiting for a table. A classy move in my book."}
{"text":"The bacon Bloody Mary was pretty good. My breakfast (2 eggs, fruit, bacon, and toast oh and potatoes) was alright. It was 9:30 AM and they were out of jelly... seems pretty odd to me to already be out of jelly at 9:30. 11 I would maybe understand, but 9:30? Idk was okay, but reminds me of a little bit better of a place than Denny's. Not sure I'll be back. Service was a little slow too, but she was nice."}
{"text":"I had breakfast here early last Saturday morning.   When you first walk in you get the feeling that you just walked into a pub/sports bar. I was sat quickly at the large bar. I was one of two tables when I arrived close to 730AM.   Service:  My server was a young guy. He was over the top. He was certainly one of the most attentive servers I have ever encountered in all my years of eating out. The only problem with him: he called me \"BOSS\" 200 times during the meal. It was excessive. I remember calling someone \"BOSS\" once and his reply was, \"my name is not Boss. Boss is some guy that lives in NJ\". Regardless, the entire staff(from the hostess to the manager) has really good customer service skills.   Food: Superb. The Banana Bread French Toast I ordered was the big winner. Cooked to perfection with a side of homemade Pork Sausage Patties. The coffee company Daily Dose uses is great. The BOSS kept refilling my coffee about 100 times.   Next time I'm in Scottsdale I will for sure be stopping at Daily Dose!"}
{"text":"Not a huge fan...don't understand what all the hype is. We ordered brunch on a Sunday afternoon and found the food to be mediocre at best. The bloody Mary's were way overpriced and did not taste good at all.  I recommend several other restaurants as opposed to this one if you are planning on grabbing brunch in Old Town."}
{"text":"I've been here for breakfast, lunch and dinner and everything I've had was amazing.  I have at least had bites of their chorizo nachos, their salmon omelette with a side of squash bites, their peach pancakes, their chicken alfredo pasta, their veggie burger on an amazing pretzel bun, and their regular cheeseburger.  all were delish! my favorite drink is their swirl -- the margarita with frozen sangria"}
{"text":"love this place for mimosas and good breakfast food! Bike to it in our neighborhood and sit on the patio."}
{"text":"Busy, but great food and Adam is a great server!  Bloody Mary's are so amazing!! The peanut butter and jelly waffle is amazing and steak with eggs will help cure any hangover!!"}
{"text":"Very good berry pancakes and the bacon wasn't too beaten with pepper like other breakfast places."}
{"text":"The food was very good. I had the protein pancakes. They were delicious! I also had a bite if the banana bread french toast. That was very good as well. Looking forward to going back the next time I'm in AZ."}
{"text":"Long lines for brunch. Told we would wait 20 minutes, we waited 45. The customer service sucked. Food is overpriced, considering that the food was marginal at best. Not coming back, this wasn't worth the wait."}
{"text":"Just stopped in for breakfast at the recommendation of the Saguaro hotel. The menu is amazing, lots of delicious options and a healthy section if you're so inclined. We ordered the pigs in the bagel (breakfast sandwich) and breakfast nachos. The cinnamon roll pancake is also a must try!  The owner, Jen, is so kind and connected with each customer and made it a truly enjoyable experience! This delicious breakfast is a great start to the day. The restaurant is centrally located, so take a walk after breakfast!"}
{"text":"No. Just No.  I came here for Lunch. Huge Mistake. I came here for Dinner. What is going on? Brunch. It was ok.  Let's go through what happened. For the sake of people I will leave out names and specifics. Can i have X dish and Substitute this for X because I want something vegetarian? \"Why would anyone want to do that.. ok.. well.. I'll see\"  rude. just rude. Are you joking?   I get my food. it was... food. it was.. what it was. It did not live up to what everyone is boasting about. and the rudeness i just cant get over it.  Never come here for anything else but Brunch... if you come."}
{"text":"Another great bunch place to eggs-plore!  Daily Dose gives you a dose of your favorite brunch items. They've got egg omelets, eggs Benedict, pig in a blanket and even sandwiches.  I came with a friend and we waited 45+mins for Sunday Brunch. Let me tell you that it was delish! They've got 6 kinds of eggs Benedict including:   - Roasted Red Pepper  - Turkey Sausage -  Black Forest Ham - Smoked Salmon - Crab Cake  -  Prime Rib  - Chorizo (YUM!)  I ordered the Chorizo Eggs Benedict and was very pleased with my order. A friend of mine ordered the Chorizo Omelet and liked her dish. Guacamole on the side is delish. Also tried the DD hash (will def get this on my next visit!)   One thing I appreciate about the place is free coffee outside even though there's a Starbucks next door. One thing I love about this place is that they place cucumber in their served iced water. I absolutely love it when breakfast places do this. It gives the water a nice refreshing taste!"}
{"text":"Found the best breakfast yet in Phoenix! Great atmosphere with an exceptionally unique menu! Outdoor seating with outdoor TV for games as well! Don't miss this gem!"}
{"text":"Favorite breakfast place to take out of town guests.  Noone has ever said anything negative about their food.  Or service.  We like to sit outside."}
{"text":"Good stuff! Been a couple of months since we first visited but I do remember we all enjoyed our brunch selections!   Will be back. Yum!"}
{"text":"This review was over due --  came here for a nice brunch after reading reviews.   We asked to sit outside and were seated immediately.. Was a nice day so could enjoy the outdoors.   The waiteress was friendly And gave us a good suggestion.  The food was not only great in presentation but it tasted great too - definitely worth having brunch at ."}
{"text":"This place is FANTASTIC! Super dog friendly! They sat us with a dog treat, water bowl and a bag! They were incredibly accommodating with us and Scooby. Jeanine (sp?) was super friendly, fun and helpful and the support staff is awesome. The food is another level of awesome, and we enjoyed their awesome drinks! I can easily say this has been the best dining experience in scottsdale thus far. Thank you for the amazing breakfast!"}
{"text":"Finally! I made it! I wandered in mid-afternoon - so the place was empty. I sat at the bar and opted for the \"Old Town Stack\" of sliced prime rib. The sandwich and the service was very good. I like the decor in here too - pretty upscale for a sandwich shop. Word on the street is that breakfast and happy hour here is remarkable."}
{"text":"The food here was so good that we had to come back 2 days in a row!!  Breakfast nachos were to die for, highly recommend. The pancakes were amazing, fluffy, and the perfect amount of sweet. The potato and steak bowl was very good!! The potatoes were seasoned perfectly. Great service!! Very friendly. Don't be turned off by the lines of people outside.... the turnaround is fast and you won't be waiting long.  This is a must try when in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"Brought here by our other Yelping buddies a few months ago and we've become regulars.  Some must haves are the chorizo eggs benedict, Belgium waffles & hangover sandwich.  Let me break this down by each meal because just mentioning them isn't enough.   Chorizo eggs benedict - the chorizo is from a local butcher and probably the best chorizo I've tasted aside from homemade by family and the hollandaise sauce is light and perfectly made, not strong tasting at all.  This meal is paired with the best breakfast potatoes seasoned to perfection. The Belgium waffles and full, fluffy and sweet.  Almost like eating a cake like donut.  Mmmm mmmm! Hangover sandwich is basically like putting the all American breakfast between two pieces of toast.  BAM! Basically a groovy place with rad food.  Be warned you may have a wait and if you have a pup you can sit on the patio with your doggy.  Our pals bring their dogs pretty frequently. Check it out!"}
{"text":"This is more of a happy hour review than a full restaurant review, but as far as happy hours go in Scottsdale, this one is on my list. Not only did they have some really good prices, but their happy hour appetizers were really tasty, and also priced well.  I tend to base my opinion of a place in regards to happy hour on the choice of drinks. They had a very good selection of beers, and even had my seasonal favorite, Four Peaks Pumpkin Porter, on tap at the time of my visit. Not to mention, they had a lot of their own speciality drinks that seemed rather tasty. However, once I realized they had my beer on tap, I couldn't venture away.   All in all, great place to meet up with a group of friends!!"}
{"text":"Cocktails with breakfast is my fav! The Bacon Bloody Mary was so good, I drank it before I could even take a pic but I do wish they had a BIG piece of bacon in it vs crumbles. The rest of my breakfast was still good. The peppered bacon that was served on my plate was my highlight!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast I've had in a long time. There is so much to try here. It took me forever to make a decision. My friends ordered ham eggs Benedict and potatoes and fruit. An omelette with hash and potatoes and a cinnamon roll pancake.  I ordered the chrizo and jalapeño corn cakes served with eggs on top, with DD hash. This was such a great mixture of food. Never would have thought it would taste as amazing as it did!  They brought us cucumber water, so refreshing! Coffee was great, served in huge cups. Also ordered the DD Bloody Mary. It had bacon pieces and bacon vodka. Kind of watered down.   Great service and great view of busy road. Eat outside if you can! Gets busy on weekends after 9:30.  This will be my Scottsdale breakfast destination."}
{"text":"I want to be a fan with Daily Dose but its hard.  I'm glad that this is a local favorite but it can be the hardest place to get a table.  I have been there several times and I always leave with mixed reviews.  I went to Daily Dose on Friday for happy hour/dinner.  I did not know they had happy hour till 8 pm, which wins bonus points!  I highly recommend The Antioxidant:   Three Olives Pomegranate Vodka, Three Olives Mango Vodka,  lemonade, green tea and peach nectar.  One word: Yummy!  The Crab Cakes were delicious and the presentation was fabulous!  I even took a picture!  There are two blue crab cakes and hidden underneath them is a surprise of edamame and roasted red pepper. The charred tomatilla hollandaise was a great addition.  I willing to give this location a shot especially now that I know they have a happy hour that goes till 8 pm."}
{"text":"Daily Dose is a pretty good dose of what the doctor ordered for brunch with friends to celebrate the end of 2016.   Since they do not take reservations and there was ~10 of us, one of my friends arrived earliest to wait. Luckily they have a coffee stand for the wait, since Saturday morning is a busy time for brunch! They promised us 2 tables together as 2 separate groups were getting up at the same time, and not even 5 minutes later they begin to seat us, but at different sides of the restaurant. A little upsetting that they did that.   Our server was great, but I didn't catch her name. If you exclude alcohol, expect to spend ~$10-15 here. I opted for the Grapefruit Fizz since it sounded fruity. Really fresh and delicious drink to choose! The cinnamon roll pancakes that one of my friends ordered looked great, and I had a little regret ordering the crispy polenta eggs benedict. Decent, but I could've gone without the poblano, made it a little too spicy for my tastebuds. The potatoes were bland, but the DD hash was great!   Worth going back another time to try something else in hopes of finding something else on the menu that is as good as the hash & Grapefruit Fizz."}
{"text":"Great food, went multiple times each time get whatever you want it's all good.  Only thing I didn't like was a pretzel bun, but that's just me.  The food was a long wait, so it's not for when you are in a hurry.  But, this was just because it gets crowded as the food is so good."}
{"text":"This place is an office favorite.   Solid options for lunch and prices that are reasonable at ~$10.    Had the Turkey melt today and that was good (onions and cheese made it) but wouldn't rush back to this while I'm still exploring the menu.  The misses went for a portabella wrap and was quite pleased with that.  We arrived just before noon on a Monday and were seated promptly.  Service was good and we were finished by 12:35pm."}
{"text":"Very big fan of this restaurant. Always have people out the door when you are hankering for a meal to satisfy. The menu takes simple dishes and takes them to the next level. What got me hooked?? Read on...  Chorizo eggs benedict DD style. What this means is that they scrap the holandaze* and english muffin and replace it with it's awesome cousin from 'Merica, biscuit and saussage gravy. I dont know about you, but when i think chorizo, i often think, \"hmmm, why is this not covered in gravy and more saussage?\"  Full bar, great menu and location. Winner."}
{"text":"As crazy as I was about Tucson, I was rapidly let down by the next town I saw, the manicured Scottsdale, which, though the oldest town in the Old West or something, is the Scarsdale of Arizona.  So funny that the Yelp headquarters is in a place where dentists and their wives with straightened hair, Laura Mercier eyeshadow, dressed up in judicious straight legged jeans and expensive bomber jackets paint the town red by going out to restaurants with a glass of wine after.  Much as they got it poppin in West Hartford and Bronxville where I lived.    Its Old Town cedes any claim to baddest town in the West cred because it's a winking, hyper commercialized homage, replete with jewelry and souvenir stores.  However.  Its center is a manicured selection of huge, spacious restaurants, some aspiring to trendiness, some getting there (such as The Pink Pony, Bandera, and the Mission with its sprawling, romantic interior which we couldn't afford.)  Instead, we headed over to the Daily Dose because of a recommendation that didn't come from Fodor's.  The Daily Dose is a spruced up trendy-ish bar restaurant slightly away on Scottsdale Rd from trendy restaurant row, with spruced up, good, solid bar lunch and dinner food.  Except the food happens to be very good and dependable.    The mango mojito was somewhat girly and candied, but good with mango chunks bubbling up the wide bubble tea straw.  The calamari, sweet lord the calamari.  It is made from a softer, less chewy part of the calamari and paired with a mustard sauce.  Highly recommended to share!  I tried the rock shrimp taco on the waitress' recommendation which was a small mess of somewhat unfrozen shrimp, cabbage, and mayo, so less recommended.  However, the turkey burger she also recommended was very good!  Tender with cheese and a couple avocado pieces on top.  Guaranteed to devolve into a food coma after 30 minutes.  The second time we came, my family tried more good things, but I was less impressed with the dull carnitas with corn salsa and beans on the side.  As far as the service, both of the women who served us were accommodating and friendly, but with a slight edge of de facto faux Southern charm that I hear Phoenix and Scottsdale sometimes ally themselves with.  I thought that the service in Flagstaff and Tucson was more sincere, but I'm biased because I like them better.  Plus, I imagine that Scottsdale is one of those places like Dallas where women \"put on their face\" for an hour just to go throw out the garbage.  And a woman who sometimes doesn't wash her face, like me, would be shunned."}
{"text":"By far the best breakfast in town. The portions can be a bit big, so we often split a breakfast and it's just perfect!"}
{"text":"Service was great. My husband had the hangover sandwich and talked about it all day.  I had the turkey white out (egg white omelet with turkey sausage) and it was delicious.  Generous portions and flavorful food."}
{"text":"I wish I could go back to Scottsdale just to try everything on the Daily Dose menu! =/ I went here for Brunch while I was out there and I had my heart set on ordering the Strawberry Creme Brule Waffles, but unfortunately they were out of waffles!! NOOOOOOOOOOOO! I ended up ordering the banana bread french toast, which was good, but I can only imagine how much better those waffles could have been. My cousin ordered the breakfast nachos which were really good. Everything on the menu looks delicious. Next time I'm in Scottsdale, I will be sure to hit this place up again..."}
{"text":"The owner reached out to me and apologized for my experience. She had to manager search the take out orders to find my phone number, and called me several times until she was able to get in contact with me. It definitely impressed me to hear how much she cared about my experience. She emphatically apologized, and said they strive to provide an excellent experience for their guests. She offered to make up for this experience by providing a complimentary lunch for both myself and a few coworkers. We ordered various things, and they were delicious and we had no complaints.   Everyone makes mistakes, and it speaks volumes to see the way an establishments handles them. A+ Daily Dose. You regained a lost customer."}
{"text":"The Daily Dose is a solid brunch spot in Scottsdale. Their was a wait when we went but we quickly seated in a large booth. They have a huge menu and it took me a while to decide what I wanted to order but I went with the breakfast nachos which were absolutely enormous and he went with pancakes. My nachos were eggy and cheesy and yummy came with a gravy on the side which was good for dipping. All in all a solid spot to have a huge brunch or possibly come for after work drinks and food if I lived here."}
{"text":"Service was great!  Bartender was attractive and helpful on a very busy Sunday morning.  Bunch of people waiting outside but only had to wait 15 minutes.  Niman ranch steak and eggs was great, cooked perfectly, with a nice mustard/horseradish sauce.  Potatoes were really good, even though they weren't hash browns which I prefer.  (Warning:  they really like to use Rosemary in this place, and it is a very overpowering herb, so be careful)  Gf had veggie omelet that she liked, and the fresh squeezed orange juice was tasty and cold.  Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Had the Pigs in a Blanket thing for breakfast.  They substituted an zen flush Muffin for the bagel..no problem.  Only one complaint...their Bloody Mary's suck."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the egg white turkey sausage omelet."}
{"text":"When Cafe Carumba closed last year I started going to Daily Dose. They have good food, a nice (but small) patio, and a good location. I normally come here for breakfast during the week because it's less busy and crammed. They have a very small patio so on the weekends it feels like there is no breathing room and you're forced to listen to five other conversations going on around you at other tables. The service also gets really slow on the weekends. I was there one Saturday and I actually got my food before my mimosa. And that's not because the food was quick, actually I remember the food taking a long time too. I had to order my second mimosa when the server dropped off the first one just to make sure it came before our meal was over. Pity too because I absolutely love mimosas and would normally drink more than just two with breakfast. So far everything i've tried at Daily Dose has been pretty tasty. They've got a great pancake selection, and you have the option to have them made from a honey wheat batter. As for lunch, I always get the same thing. It's a grilled chicken sandwich on a deliciously soft pretzel bun. It's the pretzel bun that keeps me coming back. Normally, I would branch out a little and try other lunch entrees. As for the service at Daily Dose, it's always the same. The servers always seem annoyed. I actually went there this morning with a few girl friends and we ordered hot chai teas that came room temperature. We told the server they weren't hot and asked her to please warm them up for us, we even told her she could nuke them in the microwave and she told us they didn't have a microwave and then asked us if we had tried them yet. Of course we tried them, that's how we know they are not hot. I don't think i've ever really had good service there. Of course, despite all that I still go to Daily Dose on a regular basis. They've got good food, free wi-fi, and a good location."}
{"text":"We stopped into this joint the morning after a Roger Clyne concert at Livewire. As you might imagine, we were a tad thirsty (dehydrated) and in need of liquid (Bloody Mary), so we find this place.  We all ordered the DD Bacon Bloody Mary--oh yeah! Bacon infused vodka plus actual bacon and the standard garnish. You also get a choice of mix, both are hand made, but one has a Clamato Creole touch to it. They were just what the doctor ordered to start our meal.  Breakfast was the Southwest Flannel Hash, which is a quality corned beef hash with the added bonus of jalapeno, tomatillo and red onion. The combination of flavors just works. Absolutely yummy!  The service was prompt, attentive and on point. As I can't think of anything on the negative side, five stars it is!"}
{"text":"Love the food at DD. Great service and they provide complimentary coffee and ice tea as you wait to be seated. I've only gone on the weekends for bunch but be prepared for a wait. They recently placed chairs by the restaurant for extra seating outside to hangout before your table is ready. Great environment and I don't think you can go wrong with anything on the menu."}
{"text":"Horrible Service and very average food. Blown away by all these reviews.  This is basically IHOP with a full bar."}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE!  First of all, let me give kudos for extending their happy hour to 8PM (starts at 4pm).....wait for it......SEVEN DAYS A WEEK!!!!  When most other bars in old town have doubled their drink prices an hour or two prior, Daily Dose's happy hour is still going strong, which is reason enough for me to love them.  Throw in the fact that their happy hour food menu extends waayyyy beyond your average \"bar food\" (try chorizo mac and cheese or the portobello mushroom and brie fondue) and their drink specials are pretty darn good, and we have ourselves a winner!  The only reason this place gets four stars out of five is because, due to the fact that they are EVER so popular, the wait to get into this little piece of heaven can be quite lengthy.  But I'm always glad I stuck it out!"}
{"text":"I have never been to such an amazing breakfast joint ever! Everything was on point in terms of taste, portions, and presentation. I would definitely go back the next time I visit Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I never thought I liked Eggs Benedict until I tried some of a friend's a Daily Dose... I was hooked! Since then, I've ordered Eggs Benedict at several breakfast places, but the Daily Dose's are still my favorite. I've also had some pretty delicious peach pancakes there before.  Lunch there was just average, though I did get a salad (I was trying to have a healthy day). Based on the reviews, I should probably get the burger next time."}
{"text":"Great Food and service and supper clean. Could not finish my delicious peach with creme pancake #BigPortions."}
{"text":"Fantastic breakfast. Sat at the bar. Got seated quickly. Friendly waitstaff at the bar. Food was delicious. I had the chicken and waffles and the banana bread French toast, fantastic. Friendly people seated at the bar too, great conversation. I'll definitely be looking forward to coming back when visiting Scottsdale again. I love Scottsdale Arizona."}
{"text":"Naked French toast , simple and yummy !! Great place watch game and have brunch . Getting outside table took few extra minutes , but was easy get started on  \"The Best Jalapeño Margarita\""}
{"text":"This place is an amazing brunch and lunch spot with unexpected and delicious twists on the breakfast classics as well as a few very innovative items as well. Everything I've had is delicious from the pancakes and corncakes to the huevos ranchers and burgers. They have a full bar with great cocktails and craft beer too. The service is always great, even when they're busy and the decor is cute and trendy but not in your face all the time. Definitely a good family place or a date idea."}
{"text":"Great find!  I had the cornmeal chorizo pancakes, perfect balance of flavor and texture. The menu has so many options it was hard to decide. There is something for everyone. The portions are huge. The service was great as well."}
{"text":"Cute little restaurant in old Town Scottsdale. Amazing tasty food with great service. You can sit outside waiting in an Adirondack chairs. We were called in to sit down in about 15 minutes.  Our waitress was Julia and very pleasant.  I chose the Banana Nut French toast and my boyfriend got the turkey sausage eggs benedict excellent tasting food. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"on saturday we were in the mood for a great burger and i remembered reading Dottsy Z glowing review a couple of days ago.  i went with the traditional burger and Mr h went with the the gladiator burger.  both burgers were so delicious!  the pretzel bun was a perfect marriage to the flavorful kobe meat. one of the best tasting burgers we have ever had.  we also made it just in time for happy hour..and i ordered one of their specialty drinks- i had the mai tai and my husband had a mexican beer for $2.50.  Overall it was a great visit and i am sure that i will have to work out extra at the gym tomorrow to burn off the calorie's...but it was worth it."}
{"text":"We are here twice for breakfast during our Scottsdale vacation.  It was or favorite!  Food was delicious, atmosphere was great & service was perfect!  The poblano polenta Benedict was amazing!"}
{"text":"Came here with 3 friends for brunch. The only thing that I liked out of everything we ate was the chorizo mac and cheese and a the breakfast nachos. Everything else was bland. Their special ice coffees (I had the marshmallow one and a friend had the chocolate one) had no flavor. The server tried to make things right by offering another flavor but I wasn't feeling it along with my friend who didn't like hers either. Wouldn't recommend unless you like to season your own food."}
{"text":"I had the pretzel crusted French toast and did not like it at all. I also tasted my friends pancakes which were just ok - they're very thick and tasted a little undercooked in the middle. Popular place with an outdoor patio where dogs are welcome. Our waitress was very pleasant."}
{"text":"Daily Dose has an incredible menu with the power to appease even the pickiest diners. My favorite is the \"rock shrimp\" appetizer and the \"protein and iron\" breakfast.  Their daily drink specials are unsurpassed by any other bar in the area. Go for Sangria Sunday and you will become enlightened."}
{"text":"The Beautiful Carin invited me to accompany her to church this morning after power yoga at the Village...how could I say no? :-)  I am her \"arm candy\" in those kinds of social situations...and in fact, I cannot cross over the transom of the church, unless we are holding hands...I have an unfortunate tendency to spontaneously combust when I try to enter a church on my own:)  But we held hands and I safely navigated the inner sanctums of Scottsdale Bible Church this morning:)  But, I didn't get a chance to retox immediately after my workout and running on nothing but coffee, I was starving by the time the preacher said \"Amen, Go forth\", etc.  We were looking for someplace kind of close to the house, with a varied menu (we took Carin's mom, the Lovely Lynn, out for lunch after church today, so we were looking for a bit more than chicken and waffles:)  I suggested we give Daily Dose another go.  Carin had not been here before, nor had Lynn, so there we were:)  We were met at the door by the owner, Jenn-Lyn (also of Fusion, although she informed me that they closed Fusion a few weeks ago...sadly:(...but, on a positive note, the closing of Fusion seems to have allowed them to focus on DD, because, the everything is much better than the last time I was there, and they were quite busy:)  Drinks and menus' arrived right away, the service was friendly and accommodating and Carin and her mom were just delighted with the menu selections, the service and the ambiance of the place, and I agree...it's a pleasant spot:)  I decided to try something other than a burger today and am I glad that I did:)  I had a sandwich called the \"Old Town Stack...shaved prime rib, gruyere cheese and red cabbage slaw on the sandwich...inventive and very tasty!  Carin and Lynn had the Chopped Southwestern Salad and the Spinach Citrus Salad, respectively...they pronounced the salads delicious and the salads were also huge (we ended up taking  1/2 of each home).  They made my girls happy, and I am here to tell you, if your wife and mother-in-law are happy, you are going to be happy:)  I love getting the chance to give another star to nice people for real improvement!  The DD is a solid 4 stars and solidly in the Old Town rotation:)"}
{"text":"This place was busy on a Saturday but they moved quickly, the staff was amazing and the food was phenomenal. You have to try the cinnamon roll pancakes. Not recommended for diabetics!"}
{"text":"Order the Chicken and Waffles. \"Oh that's like Lo-Lo's.\" No it's not. Stop that right now.  Lo-Lo's:Daily Dose = McDonalds:Delux burger. Are both popular? Yes.  Are both selling the same variety of food? Yes. Is the dish at the first establishment consistently better only if the consumer is 100% stoned? Yes. Similarities end there.  These waffles are actually a cornbread hybrid, topped with green chili, shredded chicken, charred corn stew, a cream sauce, tortilla strips and avocado. (Thank you pagan god of soul food. Thank you.)"}
{"text":"Our favorite neighborhood place for breakfast,  lunch and dinner. Best service of any retaurant we have been to everytime!"}
{"text":"Some coworkers and I went here on Friday night for Happy Hour.  $4.50 soft pretzel appetizer? Yes please!  I'm a sucker for any place with soft pretzels.  I had the chorizo mac and cheese which was spicy but incredibly flavorful.  I would definitely dine here again but get a reservation next time!"}
{"text":"Very good breakfast. My husband loves eggs Benedict sometimes they can be off and here they were good. The service was good. It was very crowded for a Thursday morning 10am. Where are all these people coming from! They have an outside patio area, it is on the street."}
{"text":"Second visit really like the place great staff and quick service with really good food. The soft pretzel is good and my wife loves the sweet potato fries and the double mimosa which is huge. The pomegranate green tea is awesome."}
{"text":"We ate at the daily dose twice for breakfast and both times the food and service were excellent. Pleasant atmosphere and I recommend the breakfast hash. Delicious. We will definitely return next year during our annual Spring training trip."}
{"text":"Great choice! Traveling through and decided to stop here after reading all the great reviews. I was not disappointed!!!  I'm not an omelette person but decided on the Bacon Omelette after seeing it came with avocado. It was perfect! Eggs were cooked just right, nice big pieces of crispy bacon were generously throughout along with fresh diced tomatoes, cheese oozed out of every bite as well which was heaven! All topped with what looked like half of an avocado. Perfection!  I will definitely be coming back here when we visit the area."}
{"text":"We had a great breakfast here on our first morning in Scottsdale. We had the steak omelet with a side of biscuit. I had grilled chicken with a side of spinach and toast. Overall a great, healthy breakfast. Would definitely recommend this place..and the service was wonderful"}
{"text":"Very tasty and delicious  Kolbe Beef Burgers on a Pretzel  bun !!! I am definitely a fan of their food but their service can be better...I give them 4 stars for their food but only 2 stars for their service as their staff has always seemed to be sitting around by the bar and watching TV amongst each other on  all 3 of my visits ( no host/ greeter at the door until requested ...)   I have introduced my friends and brother to this place and been there about 3 times for their huge mouthwatering burgers!   I have tried a Chinese chicken salad and a crab-cake sandwich which I would rate as average ..... this is a place that stands out purely for their burgers I would emphasize"}
{"text":"No complaints for this place!  Seated quickly, despite what appeared to be a full house.  Great Bloody Mary's, efficient, friendly, fast service.  Excellent chorizo and egg wrap.  For a tourist area, i think we found a real gem!  I'd go more frequently, if I lived nearby."}
{"text":"I was so excited when DD opened up since I love me some liquor with my breakfast (sorry Breakfast Club).  It became our new go to breakfast spot and never disappointed.  I am a huge fan of their benedicts especially their crab cake bene.  My friends are healthy eaters and always raved about their Egg White wrap or the Turkey and Sausage White out.  Servers were always helpful and courteous, even when my hung over friend had random requests like 2 medium poached eggs and wheat toast no butter.  Mimosas are great here too so make sure you aren't hung over to get one.    The owners often stop by tables to see how things are going and are very friendly.  One time one of our friends was a little green from the night before and the owner brought her over an herb remedy to help settle her stomach.  The place can get busy but service is always great as is the food.  I haven't made it there for dinner yet but it is def on the agenda.  Great work DD!!"}
{"text":"Smoothies, smoothies, smoothies! That's what it's all about.  Mango and peach was very good. Hangover breakfast sandwich was delicious and you don't actually need a hangover to eat it, as it goes. Real solid brunch joint."}
{"text":"The atmosphere here is comfortable, and familiar without being overly so. The prices are extremely reasonable, steak and eggs for $12.99, not in NOLA.."}
{"text":"I was lucky to come in early on a Saturday morning - so I avoided the long line awaiting to be seated. Easy-going and welcoming services. Large portion food. P.S.: I liked the biscuit there."}
{"text":"Nothing but good things to say! The service is good, the manager always comes and checks on the table to make sure things are ok, the food is consistent and tasty! always a good solid pick I say."}
{"text":"Holy cow.   I could be a Hindu if only the method of worshipping was eating the object of worship. (which I guess makes my true natural religion Vulvan, but that's another story)   `,8^ }  The Half Priced, Half Kobe, Half Chuck, Happy Hour Daily Dose Burger was Wholly delicious.   The pretzel-bread bun just took it over the top.  The rest of the menu looked thoughtfully prepared, and a brief conversation with one of the principals confirmed the serious attitude with which they take their establishment.  The staff handling our patio party was to be heartily commended.  The server was actually remembering and calling most everyone at the table by their first name! The empty plates and beer bottles never lingered long, and the cucumber slice infused (i'll never enjoy lemon-water quite as much again, this stuff was so refreshing!) water glasses were never empty.  Perhaps the wonderful company of multiple yelpers and the genuine conversation had me in a bit of an in-clover stupor, but I left Daily Dose with a feeling of fulfillment that went far beyond my belly.  Special thanks Donald for the set-up, and Carin's parents for being so hip and cool!"}
{"text":"stopped in for lunch last Saturday and liked the casual aspect of the restaurant. my friend and i ordered salads right away and during our short wait, noticed flies all over the place. we were disgusted but too hungover to do anything about it. the waitress got my order wrong so I had to wait an additional 5-7 minutes for my salad. the dressing was bland and we ended up taking everything to go. i give it 3 stars because the staff was nice and attentive. probably won't be going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"we came for the strawberry creme brulee waffle, but i was loving the eggs benedict so much more. don't get me wrong, the waffle fluffy interior & crispy exterior were delicious and fabulous, but what i expected in the execution was not even close. i think the cream, which they were calling vanilla creme brulee did not take my taste buds to the awesomeness of creme brulees. it was sweet cream. i guess i was expecting burnt crystalized sugar...that was it!  so, why 4 stars? despite my expectations being shattered. the food is good and top quality! they give you a huge cafe mug for coffee. the house potatoes are everything you can ask for. and, this an overall solid restaurant. we will go back, for sure...minus the strawberry creme brulee waffles, which should really be renamed the strawberry cream waffles."}
{"text":"I LOVE happy hour. I mean LOVE. =)  I came here for the first time for happy hour with my sister last week & we weren't really sure what to expect since neither of us have been here. They have happy hour from 4-8 and they have a pretty wide selection of items on the happy hour menu for you.   For food, we ordered the nachos, calamari and fish tacos. I LOVED the calamari. It comes with two types of sauce for you. A red chili sauce which I wasn't too fond of but I loved the chipotle mayonnaise sauce. The nachos were huge! It comes with the works. I mean the works, like everything! We couldn't even finish half of it. If you get the fish taco, get it grilled!   Drinks... I've never had a slushie long island before so I decided to test it out. Um, it was quite different. I think I'll stick to my long islands on the rocks. My sister ordered the spiced arnold palmer which was tasty.   I like how you can sit ANYWHERE for happy hour and that it doesn't end until 8 rather than 6 or 7. Some places you have to sit at a designated area for happy hour and it's first come first serve, which means harder to get a table.   The customer service was extremely friendly and great. The only negative I would say is that it took a bit long to get our food. However, I'll definitely be back for happy hour again! =)"}
{"text":"Bonkers staff at this small breakfast joints ... One totally overbearing and the other over the top nice but both in a frantic, hyped up on caffine kind of way. Still there was a huge line at the Breakfast Club so we gave The Dose a try.   The eggs over easy were broken and our server was confused at the request to have eggs on top of my toast. Turkey sausages were ok and the breakfast potatoes were excellent. So for a regular breakfast it was meh but then I ordered one single buttermilk pancake ... WOW! Perhaps the best pancake I have had in the valley!  For a regular b'fast show me to the 5&Diner but for pancakes only I would certainly go back."}
{"text":"Love  the food at this chain and usually the service is adequate, however today we went in and the place was almost empty and we were still sat in the worst table in the place right next to the kitchen and under a speaker blaring dance music at 8 in the morning. Then we had to wait as we were being waited on by the bartender. We decided just to take the food to go and he was unfazed by our compliant of the music. I have eaten at several of locations and the service is always just ok and today it dropped to bad. Good food, C to D- service."}
{"text":"I have been here for Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner and it has not disapointed me yet.....awesome happy hour options & pricing with a friendly staff."}
{"text":"I really liked this place. Was recommended for breakfast/brunch.  Located right in the thick of Old Scottsdale- a perfect stop before or after souvenir shopping / gallery hopping. Parking abundant and free 3 hours on the streets. Such a treat coming from Cali!!  Definitely had a \"bar-ry\" vibe- its dark and atmospheric inside, but it was a cooler day (rare in Scottsdale!) so we opted for inside dining.  I am sure this place is hopping come nighttime.  Service was efficient and friendly.  Menu is enormous. Bloody Mary selection looked divine. I was DD so did not imbibe but I wanted to!  Portions were perfect- not gut-busting, which I appreciated, but not skimpy by any means. The prices were good for the area (approx 10.00/pp)  We tried:  Polenta Egg Benedict w green chilis. Does this sound fantastic or what? It was- spicier green chili forgot the name- poblano? Eggs were absolutely perfectly yolky and warm. The hollandaise was delicious. It was a teeny tiny bit spicier than perfect for me, but I enjoyed it. The potatoes on the side were great and perfectly cooked.  Eggs Benedict w Ham. Was divine. Once again, their sauce is great- just rich enough not too thick or thin, not oversalted as many are, and full of flavor. Did not leave us feeling like gluttonous slobs- no \"benedict hangover\".  Egg Whites w mushrooms and spinach wrap.There HAS to be a healthy person at the table to make the rest of us feel like a fat shlump! Lol! Dish was reported to be delicious (not a egg white fan, tbh) I can tell you this person is usually very picky, yet they cleaned their plate- a rarity!  We all had coffees (they have an extensive coffee drink menu) and the double espresso was a real eye opener, served traditionally with lemon zest- love it.  I'd be ever so grateful if you could click on useful, funny or cool if it applies. Happy Yelping!"}
{"text":"Disappointing. It came highly recommended and we would not return. The sangria/margarita slushie recommended by the server tasted a little old. The huevos rancheros were eggs swimming in white beans with some pork bites. Way too watery and not much flavor. The flour tortilla on the side was difficult to use. Just generally not very appetizing. And I'm pretty sure there was an eggshell in my fish. My daughter had the tavern ham eggs Benedict. Those were good and she really liked the sauce. The potatoes that came with it were heavily spiced with rosemary, which she doesn't like, so those were not good. The service was good. Not intrusive. Seemed to have a good balance. The manager even came over to check in with us."}
{"text":"Huge portions, quick service. Staff is warm and welcoming. The dd hash and s'mores pancakes are a must!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed breakfast here.  The place offers alcohol if needed in am.  Their oatmeal was awesome!  We also had omelets which were good as well.  The place is located close enough to ole town shopping so we ate and then walked off breakfast in the lil shops of old town."}
{"text":"Tired of your standard breakfast fare? Daily dose is bit of breakfast with twist, with their menu containing some great healthy alternatives, along with some really interesting and tasty versions of French toast and omelets, among other things.  I am a bit of a Daily Dose regular. Aside from some of the higher end brunches provided at the resorts, Daily Dose offers one of the best breakfast and lunch menus in the Scottsdale area. I've had a good sampling of the different types of items off their menu - You really cannot go wrong with anything listed.   This past visit I tried the Crabby Omelet and the Mediterranean Salad with shrimp. The omelet came with two medium sized crab cakes and an omelet with spinach and tomatoes. The flavors worked quite well together, as the crab was much better suited as separate items than combined with the omelet, like I've had at other places. While the portion size of the omelet plate was generous, the salad was absolutely massive. It was definitely larger than what most people could finish themselves. As only a small complaint, the salad came under-dressed, so I had to request more dressing on the side. I only see this as a small issue because I would much rather a salad to come with less dressing than too much.  Of the other menu items, their burgers and breakfast burrito are also quite delicious. They have a pretty strong list of unique mixed drinks along with non-alcoholic concoctions, which seems to be a trend across the brunch spots in the area. I'm a bit more of a coffee and juice drinker in the morning, but to each their own!  Check this place out when you get the opportunity, as you'll be hard pressed to find a better economical brunch spot! Enjoy!  [This review is based on my visit on July 28, 2013]"}
{"text":"WOW. I've been here the last three weekends in a row. Does that say enough right there? Discovered the DD from searching on Yelp! YAY  Well, I've had the Caprese Omelet the last two times I was there. Perfection. All there omelets come with an abundant amount of food and the omelet itself is huge. You get a side of toast, herb potatoes, and DD hash or fruit. The omelet is served with a side of rosemary creme fraiche which I was skeptical of until I dipped my fork into that little pot of gold... then I smothered my omelet in it YUMMY.   The DD Hash is seriously my new favorite food. It's butternut squash smothered in some secret blend of herbs and spices and oils that make me want to weep tears of joy. Seriously.  My boyfriend has tried the Protein pancakes which are jam packed with fruit and other goodness. I also tried the Peach Creme Brulee pancakes which sounded more exciting than they were, but they are nonetheless DELISH.    I have yet to try any lunch or dinner here but there salads sound especially enticing! Can't wait for next weekend cause you know where I'll be."}
{"text":"This place is amazing for happy hours.  I highly recommend the chicken sliders..  The vegetable spring rolls my friend ordered looked unappetizing, but he cleaned the plate right up.  I didn't order any alcohol here, but I was able to try every iced tea they had there which were all pretty decent.  The drinks looked pretty good there too."}
{"text":"Chorizo and eggs Benedict is amazing! Im not even a big eggs Benedict fan but absolutely love it!"}
{"text":"Nice breakfast place but a bit on the pricier side.  Since I had been pigging out the last few days, I opted for the healthy peach, cashew oatmeal.  It came with a side of agave syrup to sweeten to taste.  If I was making this at home, I would have potentially caramelized the peaches a little on a griddle and toasted the nuts - they didn't do this so it lacked pizzaz/refinement if you know what I mean.  The coffee here was EXCELLENT stuff.  I wish I had more time to linger over another cup."}
{"text":"I'm going to stand by this statement- if the manager has to bring  burn spray and lemons to your table, regardless of fault, you'd think maybe at least one thing would be comped (like a mimosa to ease the pain).  I'm also going to stand by my opinion that it was the hostess' fault for putting the menus on top of a precariously stacked set of sliver ware in the middle of the table, which in turn caused a menu to slide off and spill piping hot coffee all over my lap.  I did not make a big deal of this incident, so many readers might think \"well if you didn't say anything, you don't deserve anything. \"  Let me point you back to the first sentence of this review.  Good service is good service and shouldn't require me whining about anything.    The brunch itself was pretty tasty, though the kitchen might not know the definition of what an over-hard egg is supposed to be.  I did like me my gingerbread pancakes, and there were some other delish dishes had at our table.  Food- 3.5 stars, service, 1 star."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times.  The food is always good and the service is awesome!  I've always been sat quickly, drinks are always quick to arrive at the the table, which out here when it's hot is one of the best things to happen in a restaurant.  The Chorizo Mac & Cheese is fantastic! I've also had the fish and chips, I love the red cabbage side that comes with it.  I alternate between sweet potato fries and crispy fries.  The ranch is fantastic, it's a chipotle ranch.  I keep saying I'm going to try a hamburger but I just have not got around to it yet, because there are so many good things.  One of the best things is they have happy hour everyday from 4-9pm and it's quite a large happy hour menu!"}
{"text":"We sat at the bar and had Silvia as our server. She was the absolute sweetest and made our experience one of the most welcoming we've had in Arizona. Can't speak highly enough of the food, service, and atmosphere Daily Dose provides.  P.S. make sure you order the cinnamon roll pancakes! Muy delicioso!!"}
{"text":"Ive been there many times and its generally pretty decent but last night was super annoying. We were trying to catch a show at 730 so we got there at 6 for happy hour. Our server, Chloe, was ridiculously slow even after we said we were trying to be somewhere. According to the HH menu, bottles of wine are half price but it does not say on select bottles. When we pointed this out to the manager, she blamed it on the owners word choice and said she was working on it but didn't change our bill. The food was amazing as usual.  We had chicken nachos, a pepper bacon blt, a ruben, hummus and brie. A couple of other sandwiches as well. All were so good. We were late for our show by 15 minutes but I'm sure whatever Chloe and the bartender were deep in conversation about was worth it."}
{"text":"Just fabulous! Outstanding food, superb service and beautiful setting. I had French toast with fruit and a side of bacon. The bacon was the best I have ever had. It was thick sliced, peppered and cooked to perfection. The fruit cup was loaded with pineapple which was fresh and delicious. The French toast was cooked perfectly and nice and thick with real maple syrup. The coffee was fresh brewed and robust and served in a large cup. The server checked in with to make sure we had everything we needed. Will definitely visit again!"}
{"text":"Yay! My husband is a fan; me not so much. Went for breakfast and it was okay. The coffee was descent. not bitter as in some places. My omelet was disappointing. I ordered the veggie omelet that supposed to come with asparagus and if there was any in there it must have been just a few flecks. What I wasn't expecting in it and really could have done without were green and red peppers which wasn't mentioned on the menu description. The best past of my meal was the butternut squash hash; very good, very tasty, cooked perfectly. I opted for a biscuit instead of toast and it was okay, I've certainly have had better, larger and flakier biscuits. These weren't much better than Pillsbury biscuits. My husband had something he thought was not only unique but delicious and spicy. He ordered the chorizo and jalapeno corncakes and loved it. He also ordered a tequila sunrise and thought it was excellent. My mother ordered the strawberries and creme waffle and the waffle was great, thick and perfect and very large, delicious; I tried it and it was very good. Could have been a 5 star waffle if it didn't have whipped cream from a can. Service was excellent, friendly and efficient especially considering how busy they were. I'm sure we will return considering how much my husband enjoyed it. I guess I'll just try something different next time."}
{"text":"Received recommendation from BeSpokeInn to head there for a late lunch on Monday. Fantastic service and it was delicious to enjoy an omelette at near 2pm. LIght, full of flavor and perfect portion. Again, I was there during early afternoon, only 3 other tables of customers, but I can see from the large layout, it would get noisy and crowded very quickly come evening. I highly recommend for late mid-day meal..not sure during the evening hours. Still prices were reasonable, food was delicious - service was friendly and present!"}
{"text":"I don't know how the restaurant up the street, The Breakfast Club gets all the attention, but THANK GOD IT DOES!  This way we get a much better breakfast place without all the crazies!  Great food, outstanding staff.  ALWAYS love the DD!"}
{"text":"The Search for a Tasty Consistent Breakfast place in Scottsdale...is over.  Good food, Nice people.  First of all in the service void of Old Town Scottsdale you can tell that the people at this place really care.  I have now become a bit of a regular there, but thats because the staff seemed to actually appreciate I was spending my precious few pesos with them instead of someone down the block.  So, I kept bringing my pesos their way.   I love the fact I always get a giant Ice Tea to go to keep me hydrated through-out my day.  The food is the other reason why I keep coming back.   Chock full of some unique options and always full of flavor, I now have about 5 things on my regular rotation.  The Hangover Breakfast Sandwich is still my morning staple.  Sweet turkey sausage, bacon, eggs your way, it is truly addictive.   The Prime Benedict is also delicious,, and filling.  No Matter what I get, I order up the Daily Dose hash as a side.     The place is clean and well kept, and there is a real feeling the people there enjoy their job and care about their little place.  They also serve lunch and dinner, and although that business piece has not taken off as much the food is just as good.    Definately a place to check out!"}
{"text":"Our breakfast here while visiting Scottsdale was delicious and very savory. The chorizo omelette is amazing!!! If we find oursleves back in the Devil's armpit (because it was 117 degrees) we will be here for breakfast again!"}
{"text":"I thought that they seated us pretty quickly for how busy they were. This place is dog friendly which is awesome ! Which means there's inside and outdoor seatings.   I got the chicken and waffles $11. Unfortunately it was just okay. The chicken was a little dry and on the description it explains that the waffles were corn bread like which corn bread is dry as well, so the whole thing was just too dry for me. I would come again but def won't get this dish again.   Also got a mimosa $5.75. It was made right.. to me of course, 90% champagne and 10% orange juice! If you like it that way then this is the right mimosa for you! Although, there's other flavors and types of mimosas as well and amount you could get.   This place is like in a shopping area like place, I'm not sure how to explain it. I didn't see a big parking lot or anything but there were a lot of street parking and small lots."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good here, and the soft pretzel and cheese is excellent. There's great breakfast and lunch options. I've had good & bad experiences here with the service."}
{"text":"There is nothing like having Brunch anytime you want to! I came into this cafe on a cold Thursday afternoon and it was a delight. As a restauranteur, I truly appreciate great service...our server Brooke was awesome and she definitely contributed to our experience.   We started our brunch with a delicious cilantro Jalapeno Edamame Hummus, it was a great idea, however, the consistency reminded me of falafel mix (a little grainy).  I ordered the Prime Rib Benedict and my friend ordered the Rosemary Steak and Eggs. The rosemary creme friache and the harissa aioli are must have condiments.   Overall the ambiance is nice, the service was great and the food was good. Excellent location and patio seating is available..."}
{"text":"We've only dined here for breakfast, but it's never been particularly impressive.  I've tried the crab cakes benedict, which was on the bland side with crab cakes that were very heavy on the filler.  I've also tried the Hangover sandwich, which seemed to be a Yelp favorite, but it was just okay, perhaps a little salty and a little greasy without enough depth of flavor. My husband had pancakes, which were cooked well, but I was disappointed that they used fake syrup rather than the real stuff at the price point."}
{"text":"Visited Daily Dose over July 4th weekend while visiting Scottsdale.  We enjoyed our first breakfast so much we invited a couple of local friends out for breakfast the next day.  We through the waitress (I believe her name was Grace) for a loop when we had an extra couple of people show up as a surprise.  But she handled it perfectly and was extremely attentive despite the additional people she had to take care of.  Can't say enough about the food and service.  We look forward to visiting again during our next Arizona vacation."}
{"text":"This is my current place to beat in Scottsdale for brunch. The portions are huge. We went there to kick off a friend's birthday weekend with a Saturday brunch. We had a party of around 10 and had an hour wait, really the only downside. Luckily, most of the crew going was running behind any way. I was able to sample a couple of the eggs Benedict - all amazing. I ordered an omelette with Salmon - delicious. However, the winner for that day was the breakfast nachos!!!!"}
{"text":"This gets the award for \"most overrated place\" in old town!  DO NOT eat here for breakfast! You will wait longer than they tell you, and then even longer for food and most of the time it comes out cold.  They always seem to be understaffed so service is not what it should be!  They definitely need to work their stuff out!"}
{"text":"Today was my first time visiting the world renowned Daily Dose. I was pleasantly greeted upon my arrival by the hostess! There was a small wait time. We got seated with the most wonderful young gentleman I have every had the pleasure of meeting. His name was Max. Max was so amazing, when I first sat down he asked me if I wanted something to drink. Why yes! I would love something to drink! The thought thrilled me. He was thrilled too.  Next thing you know, max brought me my drink! I really recommend the pomegranate green tea. Max likes the tea too!"}
{"text":"YUM!!! A friend recommended that I try Daily Dose because I LOVE breakfast! So I came here twice in one week. The wait on a Saturday morning was around 10 min and there was free hot coffee to enjoy while waiting which was greatly appreciated.  The menu has so many different options that all sound fantastic, hard to pick something.  The first time I went I got the crabcake omelet and it was pretty incredible. Big crab cakes, delicious omelet, tasty sides... The serving was huge (at a very reasonable price) and I had leftovers that heated up really well in a skillet the next day. I also got a mimosa that was heavy on the champagne, light on the OJ -- perfect!  The next time I went with my mom and we split the ginger snap granola, which came with fresh and sweet strawberries, and the prime rib omelet. Once again, I was impressed.   Can't wait to come back and try the cherry margarita that I spotted on the menu. I've been dreaming about it every since."}
{"text":"Yummy breakfast and Madeline was a fantastic server."}
{"text":"This was my third time at Daily Dose and I have to say each time has been remarkable. The first time I went, I shared the breakfast nachos with a friend and jeez are they dangerously delectable. The nachos along with the bacon Bloody Mary should be a prescription for a hangover.     The next two times I got the Strawberry Mint Salad with Grilled chicken. The balance of Salad , goat cheese and strawberries are perfect. Not overly dressed , but each bite is flavorful and refreshing. I think I found my latest addiction. I will be back soon to get my daily dose."}
{"text":"Everybody loves Daily Does!  The lines say that every Saturday and Sunday morning.  The food is much more fresh than any breakfast joint I have been to.  It's in a great spot in Old Town too!  Also, their pretzel buns...LOVE."}
{"text":"dinner is unremarkable but decent. if you're looking for typical pub grub food, then this is a good choice. the staff is very friendly.  the happy hour is definitely the way to go with specials on food and drinks from 4-9 - i'm not used to the generous hours on the specials."}
{"text":"Impressive. I came here for brunch on a Sunday and decided to go healthy with the Turkey Sausage White Out. It was delicious. The meal was a turkey sausage egg white omelet with fresh fruit and toast on the side. The rye bread was a bit stale, but that is my only complaint about the meal. The fruit cup was large and had quite a bit of pineapple in it. Some of my friends got pancakes, and boy was I jealous! Next time I go, I don't think I'll plan on a healthy meal ;)"}
{"text":"Great breakfast here! Some interesting items on the menu, and the food we saw going by our table looked delicious as well!  Would definitely go here again!"}
{"text":"An excellent place to start the day. Delicious coffee and an option for every taste. Vegan, vegetarian, and lots of meat options."}
{"text":"I love this place!!! The breakfast is huge portions with even bigger flavor and the happy hour is a great deal! My favorite dish: Chicken Nacho's (can be eaten as a meal)!!"}
{"text":"If I could give Daily Dose 10 stars, I would!! I have been going to this old town favorite since their doors opened and it has turned into my (almost) weekly happy hour, or breakfast spot! Everything on the menu is fantastic, from their southwest breakfast wrap, to their chicken nachos, to their delicious burgers served on a pretzel bun, you really can't go wrong!! Weekend brunch is PACKED, but don't let the wait, scare you off because it is definitely worth it!!"}
{"text":"Was craving just these burgers!  I ordered the turkey burger and my friend ordered the classic - both were delicious.  Great Happy Hour food deal, we will be back."}
{"text":"I've wanted to try this for a long time!  Situated right on Scottsdale blvd in Old Town -- right in the thick of it.  Well, I got there right at 7am when they opened on a Saturday morning.  I was able to sit outside on their covered patio, and enjoy the lovely cool morning air...before the blistering heat melted me.  Fun and lovely staff, very accomodating, and cool.    The food was terrific, and I enjoyed their Veggie Hash (squash, onion, mushrooms) as a side to my smoked turkey & brie omelette.  Coffee was great, and the neverending refills was just what I needed."}
{"text":"Huevos Rancheros with a side of DD Hash.  Great atmosphere, open and airy.  Scottsdale college town feel.  Terrific coffee and a smart, helpful waiter.  Will return next time in town."}
{"text":"I came here for a Sunday brunch. This place is pretty popular as it was very busy. It had a typical brunch menu full of tempting hangover meals and some healthier options. I think what made this place most unique was it's adult coffee offerings. There were so many options and my friend got one that she really enjoyed. I had the steak and egg bowl that was ok IMO. I think the best things to try here though are the benedicts and the coffee!"}
{"text":"The fiancé and I came in for a late breakfast today and couldn't have had a better experience!  Everything from the service to the food and establishment in general was on point.  Their coffee selection was enlightening, cucumber water refreshing and that crab omelette.... yummo! I have my eye on that soft pretzel for next time....  seems like a great place to just chill and have a cocktail or four at the bar as well. I don't write reviews often but this place deserves a solid recommendation!"}
{"text":"This is a fun place to eat, but just not my cup of tea.  The service was very good and is what gets it a passing grade.  Unfortunately, the food was very average. Everything was completely over-seasoned, so much so, that i could only eat half the food, and I was starving. Do not get the special hash and the potatoes on the same plate, they are seasoned nearly identically and would require you to drink a gallon of water to even attempt to finish it all. The quality of everything else though is fairly good though and i think this is why it is popular here. Maybe just stick with waffles and pancakes, they did look pretty good.  It is hard to say that i would recommend this place, maybe i would if I knew that person loved over seasoned food. It is a fun place though."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch.  I ordered the ceviche and what I received was basically chips and watery salsa with a few chunks of shrimp.  I may sound like a snob, but I've enjoyed authentic ceviche in Peru and this sorry excuse for seafood salsa is not what ceviche is supposed to be.  Ceviche is raw fish \"cooked\" in lemon/lime juice with peppers and onions."}
{"text":"My friend and I came here for breakfast on our last day in the Phoenix area. The reviews on Yelp were so good, we were excited to eat here.  It was a Monday, so the place was fairly empty when we arrived. I ordered an orange juice and the biscuits and gravy, my friend ordered one of their flavored iced lattes and the basic breakfast.  Unfortunately, the orange juice had an odd flavor to it, which my friend verified, so I didn't drink it. I guess the best way to describe it is that it tasted old. She didn't care for her iced latte and didn't drink that either.  The food was ok, but the potatoes and fruit tasted like they had been in the refrigerator/freezer too long. If you are serving fresh food, this should never be the case. I never complain, but I made a point to say something to the waiter about the taste - neither my friend and I ate the potatoes or fruit. The waiter was dismissive at best, we clearly had not enjoyed anything and he said nothing, even after I pointed out the bad tasting potatoes.  I hope this was just an off day for them, but it wasn't a good experience and based on it, I would not return."}
{"text":"Go from brunch and get the breakfast nachos. OMG. They were to die for. red chile sauce, two cheeses, baked chips, chorizo eggs. Got sour cream on the side and left of the pico. Came with sausage gravy that was not the artery cloggin' kind. These were so yummy.  It was a little dark inside (full out front) and they don't have sweet & low. Nice ambience. Totally cool for the kids, too, but no paper kids menu."}
