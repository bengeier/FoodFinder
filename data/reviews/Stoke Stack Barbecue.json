{"text":"If you need an amazing meal for a venue, event or even just a great dinner (when they open up their restaurant next year in Leaside) DO NOT EVEN HESITATE TO CONTACT ADAM!!! He has incredible passion for his BBQ and ensures it's done to perfection.  For events, take the extra few minutes and coordinate when the meal is going to be served and you will not be disappointed, the food is prepped on the spot and you will have fresh, hot and amazingly delicious food ready to serve your guests. (also don't be scared if the venue doesn't have all the cutlery/dishes or cups, they can come fully self sufficient and turn a backyard/field into a full on party!)  We had big eaters and there was no mention of not enough food or small portions. Watching 10 people immediately shoot up from their chairs and scramble to where the food was when our DJ announced that there were plenty of seconds was an amazingly funny sight!  I don't think it's a well known thing but Adam sources all his meats from vendors around North America and selects them specifically for flavor and texture. The Appetizers were plentiful and amazingly delicious, and the entrees... OMG I'm still drooling over the brisket (melted in my mouth and was fork tender), ribs (packed full of flavor and had the perfect bark), turkey (OMG juicy white meat, amazing and had just enough smokey flavor to accent a lighter meat), pulled pork (amazing pairing with the BBQ sauce, and we got to make our own mini pulled pork sandwiches! I opted to skip the bread in lieu of more meat!) and all the sides (the perfect Texan BBQ pairings!)... My only recommendation is... show up hungry, leave happy and be pleased you picked an amazing caterer.  Trust me when I say, once the restaurant is opened next year, I'm going to be there more then I should!"}
{"text":"Just had lunch at Stokestack and had the meat platter.  Amazingly moist brisket, pulled pork with a variety of great sauces on the side, sausage with the perfect amount of spice. Coleslaw, vegetable laden potato salad and corn and bean salad.   I need a nap now...  So great!"}
{"text":"Stoke Stack catered our work lunch today and it was honestly the best bbq I've ever had. Even the turkey (which I don't like) was amazing."}
{"text":"These guys made our wedding day. Every guest was raving about the Brisket and it's out of this world. Their set-up is beautiful for anyone looking to hire them for a catering event and it was perfect for our backyard wedding. They bring their own tables, set-up, napkins, plates, and cutlery so we didn't have to worry about much."}
{"text":"Hiring Stoke Stack BBQ was the best decision we made for our wedding.  We were fortunate enough to have met Adam and Alison (and their adorable puppy dog) back when they were still operating their food truck on the danforth. The food was always amazing and once we found out they also did catering we knew this was what we wanted for our wedding. We decided on the whole shebang menu and since our venue was fairly no frills we discussed hiring some of his staff for the night (ie: bartender, set up help and clean up help).   We had a bit of a hiccup about 2 weeks before the wedding with a miscommunication, but Adam quickly and very amiably helped us sort it out. Great customer service!  On the day of the wedding Stoke Stack arrived and set up in such an easy and seamless way. The staff were fantastic, very personable and took extra care with our guests. The food was even better than we had hoped or expected (the BLT's, short rib taco, Chicken/Waffle, pulled pork, ribs and coleslaw were my personal favorites). Our guests loved the food and there were many 'best wedding food ever' posts on facebook/twitter/instagram.   Stoke Stack helped ensure we had a stress free wedding with very well fed and happy guests.  If you love bbq, want a reliable caterer with great staff, then hire Stoke Stack you will not regret it!  PS. The table setting they do (baking sheet, glasses, cutlery and napkin) is really fun and definitely adds to the service."}
{"text":"People say these guys are the best in town. I would agree. They have super friendly staff, are mobile, and the food is INCREDIBLE. I've been to a few parties where they have been serving food (and alcohol), and have heard nothing but rave reviews. Everyone loves a good brisket (or slaw), and I would recommend these guys in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"This was one of my favourite places to eat but they just finished up for the season: why did you abandon me?"}
