{"text":"I've been to the waffle love food truck a few times.  However, it's nice that they have a permanent location now.  I ordered the banana chocolate delight which had bananas, embedded chocolate squares, and cream on top.  The Liege waffle itself has a unique and tasty flavor.  The chocolate could have been melted more but the whipped cream on top was delightful.  The price was $7 which isn't bad, but it certainly won't fill you up for lunch.  Next time I will treat this place as dessert only."}
{"text":"Not impressed. Service was slow. Price was too high for the small portion. Savory choices would be welcome."}
{"text":"If I could add more stars I would. Hands down the best liege waffles in AZ! The staff is amazing and the store is adorable. Try the cinnalove(waffle topped with cinnamon butter and cream cheese frosting). Waffle Love does not disappoint"}
{"text":"So HAPPY Gilbert has such a cute shop to go to now!!!  This place is the cutest!  Love all the AZ details!  Employees were very friendly, right when I walked in.  My waffle was made to order so it took a little time, but I was glad to know it was made FRESH!!  Their waffles really are the best in AZ!  Love that they have gluten free options.  My family and I will be visiting this place often!!"}
{"text":"Holy cow, the waffles are legit! Great flavor, a tad over-priced. The wifey and I shared ours. 4 stars due to wait time."}
{"text":"Awesome!! Been an on going customer of the truck since the last year and it's amazing every time!! The store is nothing short of the high bar they have set! Employees know my name when I come in, talk to me, and make the 30 minute drive well worth it!!"}
{"text":"Everywhere surrounding this place is filled with the sweet smell of waffles. I got the cinna love waffle, and my friend got the sunshine. They balanced each other perfectly, one sweet and tangy and the other rich and creamy. The waffles were crispy on the the outside, soft on the inside. Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"I went to Waffle Love in Gilbert Az.  and placed my order it came to $11 and change I paid for it and then I asked where was the restroom so I could wash my hands.  They told me they do not have a restroom for public use and that the restaurant next door had a restroom.  So I told them to cancel my order refund my money and then I went next door as the cashier suggested and used the restroom and ate there instead. Isn't it State law they have to have a restroom for public use of they serve food?  I left an email message for their corporate office 5 days ago and have not heard back."}
{"text":"I think this places's menu looks amazing! I saw their fb post stating one of their trucks would be near my house last night. I was so excited! I told my friend about it at work that day and we drooled over the options we could create. We finally had our minds set on what we wanted to order. 

The fb flyer said 5-9 and the company even posted an announcement around 5 saying it wasn't raining and encouraging everyone to come out. I drove by on my way home about 530 but didn't see them off Dobson. In figured they must have been back off southern closer to the fields. 

I went back at 815. I drove around the entire Mcc campus looking for the truck they said would be by the rose garden. I posted a message on their announcement  saying I couldn't find their truck. No reply. I drove around the entire campus again thinking I must have missed it since the event went until 9. No truck. I left.

I privately messaged the company in fb letting them know what happened. 

This is the message I sent them:
\"I have to tell you I am extremely dissapointed. I live really close to Mcc and drove by southern and Dobson around 530 this evening but couldn't see your truck. I came back at 815 tonight and drove everywhere on the Mcc campus. All four parking lots, streets weaving in and out of the campus- literally everywhere. Your truck was not there. My friend and I had been looking forward to trying your waffles for the first time all day. And you let us down. \"

I expected a response saying something like I'm really sorry you couldn't find us. We are so glad you came out to see us. Let's see how we can make your experience better. Nope.

Instead, i got a response saying \"it's not our fault\" the event ended early because of the rain. 

Here is the response I got:
\"Hi Chelsie! Sorry you were disappointed. we were definitely there until 7:50. We cannot help when an event is canceled due to rain, we were invited to this event and we were the last truck to leave. It was out of our control! We are in Mesa a lot so come see us again:)\"

I can assure you, waffle love, you absolutely could have posted that you were leaving the event on your fb announcement so any customer planning to come between 7:50-9 didn't waste their time and gas trying to find your truck. Knowing you left early, you should have checked your fb announcements for people saying they couldn't find you.

Your company has terrible customer service. Whoever responds to your fb messages should be fired for their inept people skills. I gave your company the courtesy to contact you directly to resolve the issue and you missed the opportunity to correct the issue and places blame on someone else. 

No, I will not be \"coming to see you again\". I am happy to support the other waffle trucks. #i'll be going to wafflecrush."}
{"text":"I got a text from my apt complex saying to come get a sweet treat from the waffle love food truck  so I figured ! Ah! Perfect diet cheat.... Oh my goodness .... How amazing .... Best waffle dessert l ever l had ... Coming from an east coaster huge compliment ! Btw get the CINABLISS :) !!!!!!!"}
{"text":"OMG, I absolutely love this place. The Red Wonder is my absolute favorite. I had the Pumpkin this past fall it was amazing as well. Two complaints: I feel that for the price you should get 2 waffles and my kids can't eat them (get tummy aches and GI issues) so it's hard for me to justify going."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time on a Friday night, dinner time. It wasn't busy at all. The shop was really cute, but I was really disappointed in my cinna waffle. It was really hard, I couldn't even eat it because it was so hard. It took the girl less than a minute to make it, which at first I was super impressed, but was let down to find out it was inedible since I couldn't even use my fork to cut into it. I ate it right away as well, so it wasn't like it sat out for a period of time."}
{"text":"Had a family of 5 here so we all tried something different. Its very fast foodish. When they say waffles they literally mean just waffles. Which is fine, but even their waffle options were very limited to only a few. Not worth the value, a bit on the pricey side when you are literally recieving one, fairly small, waffle. So overall meh. Probably won't return or recommend but I didn't hate it."}
{"text":"This is the CUTEST waffle place in town! I love the vibe, decor, and their waffles. We had a hard time deciding on what to get because everything sounded AMAZING!"}
{"text":"Best waffles I've ever had...I get banana, Nutella and whipped cream. Yummy. So glad they have opened up a store over by the SanTan mall so I get get my waffle fix anytime."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!  Great waffles, other goodies and super cool culture/ customer service."}
{"text":"Litterally the most delicious waffles I have ever eaten!!!
They have a grilled cheese waffle that tastes like heaven and has this amazing dipping sauce. The waffles come out quickley and are made made fresh when i ordered them! There is also this stuff called biscoff that tastes so good on the waffles. I never had heard of it before I went to waffle love but it tastes so friggen good. Its like a spread made out of cookies or something. I dont know but i could eat it with a spoon. If you in the mood for life changing delicious food. I suggest going to waffle love."}
{"text":"Super cute new shop and perfect location. They were very fast and friendly. Most delicious waffle ever. The strawberries and cream is the perfect amount of sweet. Can't wait to come back! Wish them the best with this new location."}
{"text":"The waffles are yummy and Madyson is great, her smile is infectious. Keep up the great work Waffle LOVE"}
{"text":"Cookie butter waffle is oh so mouth watering!!! Add strawberries and bananas and you will feel like you have just defined perfection! Enjoy! And don't worry if it's cheat day or not!!!!! Waffle day has just been started by me! Live it up!"}
{"text":"Sunday August 14, 2016, 10:00 AM AST:  You have one job!!! Waffles!  Make them good. Make them affordable. Make them available. No one is raving about how good they are. Everyone is claiming that they are overpriced for what you get. But the main problem I see is that people want waffles at waffle time which is daily 6:30 am until 11:30 pm. So with all of the overload in advertising they company NEGLECTED to advertise that for some strange reason they are closed in Sunday!!!  Forget heading over after Church! Forget packing up the kids for a special treat. Waffle love is closed on Sunday...wasted my drive, wasted my time, wasted the family time and there are all these sad kids now. Well earned  and deserved 1 star.  I was at your door and your place of business was closed. First hand experience!!! Thanks."}
{"text":"Very yummy! Had the waffle with biscoff, strawberries, and cream. My hubby had the stuffed chocolate one and to me it seemed like it was an \"old\" waffle. Also had the iced coffee, I liked but hubby did not-- it's not sweet. 
Service was good nothing to be super happy about. The ambience was cute for a first date or something...or a place to catch up with a friend too. 

Will I come back when Waffle Crush Truck is too far? --yeah. 
Will I choose them over Waffle Crush?-- maybe."}
{"text":"We went to the store in Gilbert. We got there 5 minutes before the store opened, there already were 8 people in line. I can see why. I got the grilled cheese waffle my wife got one with strawberry, banana and Nutella. Absolutely the best waffles we have had. Well worth the wait. The only warning is for people on a diet, I'm sure I gained 5 pounds just looking at what everyone else had. We will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Pricey for a waffle, but if you are looking for a delicious sweet indulgence this is the place to get. My favorite is the cinna bliss."}
{"text":"Great, friendly and fast service! Tried the strawberry and whipped cream topping and another with Nutella. Have to say but he were good. I like mine a little more fluffy but that is not to dauntless were bad at all. If there is a negative, they don't have syrup! So if I ordered a plain waffle it really would be plain.

1st time here but will definitely return. And if they wow me the second time, then I may just update my review accordingly! Overall a good experience!"}
{"text":"This place NEVER disappoints. The waffles are rich and delicious. Perfectly portioned for my children and I. Their cold brew is so good. This is our favorite waffle place. I bring my kids here as a treat before we get our day started. The girls behind the counter are so polite and so nice. The restaurant is cute and clean. Definitely a must-try. My kids and I will be coming here for as long as this place is open."}
{"text":"I'm giving 3 stars due to the pricing of menu items. We looked up a quick breakfast place on Yelp after an appointment and found out Waffle Love. We had never tried them before. To be fair, the waffles were delicious, coffee was fresh, staff was cordial. But 2 waffles (approximately 4\" x 5\" size), one topping of Nutella, and 2 small coffees were $15.78. Thought seeing \"$\" on Yelp, this place would offer more bang for the buck. So our disappointment is more with Yelp at this point because the place is definitely \"$$\". More than likely we won't go again, however if you are craving fresh, crispy and delicious waffles, you should at least try this place once."}
{"text":"I got the Nutella Love ($7.50), and it was delicious! The cream, Nutella, and strawberries were a great combination. It was pretty filling, even though I didn't think it would be. I also tried the CinnaLove ($5.50), which was basically a cinnamon roll in waffle form. That was pretty good as well."}
{"text":"Love this place it soo good the staff is friendly and they have the best whipped cream ever would recommend"}
{"text":"Really great food! Guilty pleasure of mine! Really wish they had vegan waffles or vegan option though!"}
{"text":"I love this place!! If you have a sweet tooth, then this is your spot. Whenever I have family coming from a different state or even friends who have never been here, I always take them here!! 

They are a bit pricy, but soooo worth it! The waffles are always made to order, which guarantees freshness. 

Be sure ask for a punch card to earn your way to a free waffle! And don't forget to check-in for a free topping!!"}
{"text":"Amazingly great waffles!! My husband and I ordered one to share, Nutella strawberries and whipped cream with a side of fresh peaches. It took us less than 5 minutes to polish it off and wish we had ordered our own instead of sharing."}
{"text":"Absolutely my favorite waffle place ever! Once you have had these no others will ever compare! Be sure and check out the adorable decor and the waffle truck is so cool too!"}
{"text":"I've only had waffle love a handful of times but every time I've been here it really hits the spot.

My kids are not waffle fans but they never say no to waffle love. Anyway my son got his first paycheck ever and he decided to celebrate by treating yours truly to something yummy. Don't worry I also gave lessons about saving and smart finances which is why we went to get waffles and not lobster. 

We came on Friday and the place was empty. Like it's 120° outside nobody is crazy enough to leave the house empty for a waffle. 

I got the sunshine which has lemon curd, cream and fresh raspberries and it was exactly what I needed to cut through a hot day. 

Clean atmosphere
Friendly staff
Amazing waffles
Fresh ingredients
Decent prices"}
{"text":"Okay, my wife begged to go here. I'm at 3 stars and she at 5 stars, so our compromise is 4 stars. I felt like I was in a tourist trap of yoga pants and waffles. My wife loved it and thought it was, \"cute.\" Cute isn't in my vocabulary. I hope she doesn't ask me to come back but she probably will."}
{"text":"Love Waffle Love! Ask for their grilled cheese waffle and tomato bisque soup - it's worth the $10."}
{"text":"I'm really excited to see that Waffle Love has a storefront now. It's so much easier to find than having to track down a food truck! Firstly, the ambiance here is great. It's not super big but still has quite a few tables and a high-top bar inside. The walls are adorned with artwork that almost just lifts your spirits! Very modern and trendy. Normally I tend to just put in take-out orders but here, I don't mind taking a seat to enjoy my waffle.

The waffles themselves are really good. My only note is - sometimes they're a bit inconsistent. I've gone in and received waffles that are light, fluffy, chewy, and a perfectly golden brown. Other times however, they get grilled too much and end up getting crunchy. Either way, I think Waffle Love makes the liege best waffles! My favorite one is the Cinna Love waffle which is a waffle topped with cinnamon butter & cream cheese frosting. Can't wait to go back at some point to try out the grilled cheese!"}
{"text":"Phenomenal waffles. Phenomenal service. Excellent presentation of absolutely delicious waffles. We got the works and the chocolate dream and both were very rich and filling. Simple, yet delicious product. Have been here many times and always enjoyed the experience and will be here in the future. Also a very cute environment with nice decorations."}
{"text":"Biscoff??? Never heard of it.....until now and now I know what true love is all about! This place is delicious!"}
{"text":"What's not to love about Waffle Love?  Hubby and I stopped in for dessert and decided to split the CinnaBliss - churro waffle, dulce de leche, and fried ice cream. The waffle had the most perfect texture...crispy on the outside and melt in your mouth center. Topped with the ice cream and dulce de leche - heaven!  I think we won't be sharing the next time we go!!  :-) Super friendly staff and fun decor!"}
{"text":"Waffles are very good, just wish the portions were larger given what the prices for the waffles are."}
{"text":"I came in this location about two weeks ago one night with my brother. We were excited to try a waffle because it gets crazy amounts of attention. However we were never able to.  we waited in line behind a family to place our order and when it was our turn both teenage workers started making the families waffles and DIDNT SAY A WORD TO US! They knew we were there, but for whatever reason they ignored us, I waited at the counter for service for about 5 minutes and they never acknowledged us AT ALL! This company needs to work on their customer service skills. After about five minutes I had enough so we left and went to McDonald's (which has better service) I will not come here because the company he clearly doesn't care about the customers and will hire rude employees to wait on the customers. I don't like going towards these girls's paycheck because they don't deserve it."}
{"text":"I am a smidge picky(and by that I mean super picky) about waffles. They have to be crispy on the outside, and light and airy in the inside. Waffle love nailed it! I brought my oldest here as part of her \"13 for 13\" things we did for her bday. She got the churro, I had the grilled cheese with tomato basil bisque, and my twins(almost 3 yo) has the red wonders. We all sort of shared, and there wasn't a bite left over! The grilled cheese is made with muenster(my favorite tied with gruyere) and the bisque was a good texture and didn't give me the dreaded tomato soup heart burn. We will absolutely be back, and I recommend this place to anyone wanting a sweet treat(or maybe the grilled cheese and soup savory treat)."}
{"text":"UPDATE: After our last experience here, we were firmly decided not to return; however, the owner reached out to us and asked for more information about the problem in order to address the issue. He was apologetic and understanding and offered coupons to encourage us to try it again. Although we haven't received the coupons yet, we decided to give it another try this morning because it's a Friday morning rather than Saturday and we were hopping service would be better. It was. Our experience today was light years ahead of what happened last time. There was no line and no terribly long wait to get our food once ordered. Last time, the wait just to place our order was intolerable. This time it was speedy and delicious. I can't attribute it to a change in procedures or policy or anything on part of the establishment or management, but it was still far improved. So, for now, I very much recommend trying Waffle Love, BUT avoid hot times. If you arrive and see people inside, probably best to just keep driving. Still though, I'm adding a star to my review. 

ORIGINAL REVIEW: This place is so slow. We thought \"hey let's check this place out. We don't have a lot of time, so a quick waffle with stuff on it should be super quick.\" It was not. We waited well over half an hour to order and get our waffles. Just two of us. We aren't a huge party. These are just waffles after all. You scoop out the batter and put it on the waffle iron and then remove. It isn't complicated. For the price this place charges for such an uncomplicated item, the wait is unbearable. We won't be back."}
{"text":"A lovely experience when it comes to Belgian waffles. Good service but it does get a little pricey. The taste of the waffles is worth it though. The feel of the establishment is very modern and cute, it's hard not to have a smile on your face when consuming such deliciousness in such a cute place!"}
{"text":"Woot woot! They have a store front now and it is awesome. We had the chocolate dream and nutella love and they were amazing."}
{"text":"Very unique menu - plenty of options to partake in consuming a waffle. We had banana and Carmel, along with Cinnabliss.  Both were excellent.  I would definitely recommend trying this place at least once. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Stopped here for breakfast one morning when we were visiting family.  Good friendly service but it's not quite fast because the waffles are made to order which is a good thing.  They are Belgian style liege waffles. We tried the churro, the cinnamon, the Nutella and strawberry. All of them were delicious and it just depends on what's your cup of tea.  They average around $5-7 each and are definitely tasty if you're looking for some waffle luv."}
{"text":"Cute little place. Always heard about the food truck but I never had the time to hunt them down. I decided to finally give it a try today since I was so close! 
The place is cute, brightly painted, and feels very instagramish (hello new word) the menu is tiny and a little hard to read. Also the tables were dirty and we had to sit at the only semi clean one that was by the trash can. 
There are many yummy toppings to pick from. I went with a grilled cheese and then a waffle with bananas, cream, and raspberries (YUMMY). We also had the red wonder waffle. You can either make your own or order the ones that are there already put together. 
We waited about 15 minutes for the food to come out but that's OK, it was hot and freshly made! The grilled cheese was so good and cheesy and it came with a yummy tomato dip! I will definitely be back for more waffles soon!"}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE Waffle Love! Absolutely delicious food and coffee is amazing. Service is great. You can't go wrong coming here. Chairs aren't very comfortable but the food is so delicious, didn't really matter to me! Great place to bring out of town visitors. Thrilled Waffle Love is in my neighborhood."}
{"text":"If you dine-in, you will likely be annoyed by some screaming kid and their mommy, but if you can ignore that noise for about ten minutes, you will be rewarded with a delicious waffle experience. I simply had the churro waffle and got my free YELP topping of bananas. The cinnamon sugar waffle was loaded with cinnamon cream and fruit. It was a chewy waffle and stayed hot the entire visit. You will need both knife and fork, but every bite was very tasty and unique as well. All totaled, it was just over 5 bucks, so a good value and fairly filling breakfast."}
{"text":"Waffle Love greets you with the smell of delicious caramelized sugar and friendly faces. The decor is colorful and inviting. Everyone is always super friendly here and the waffles are yummy! 

Once, I got one that was overly browned but without me even saying anything, a staff member came over with a golden brown one right away and apologized for the overly browned one. Now that's great customer service!"}
{"text":"First time visiting the location in Santan! :) the waffles are amazing as always. We are very pleased that this location has opened up so that I no longer have to chase down the food truck:)"}
{"text":"DELICIOUS!

I was first introduced to Waffle Love when I ate at their food truck a couple years ago and was surprised to find that they opened a location in Gilbert. I decided to come here for dessert with my niece on a Friday night. 

It is tucked in the San Tan area, right across from Carabas. Since it's located next to a variety of stores, parking can be limited if it's a busy night. I was surprised that there weren't many people inside the location, so my niece and I had no troubles finding a table to sit at. Their menu is very similar, if not the same, as their food truck. If you check in on yelp, you get a free topping! We opted to order the nutella love with bananas and strawberries. I was happy to find out that you can substitute vanilla ice cream for cream for just an extra $1. It's definitely more of a special-occasion type of treat, since our total came out to be a little over $9. It was just the right amount to share for 2 people. It came out warm and there was a generous amount of nutella on the waffle. The container was a little small for the waffle and the toppings occasionally fell out on the table when we were cutting into it. I appreciated that the waffle wasn't overly sweet, especially since we had sweet nutella and vanilla ice cream. 

If you want to bring it home, you can order it to go. They have containers big enough that your order won't get squished. There is no bathroom at their location, but luckily the pizzaria a couple doors down allows you to use their restroom. 

Come here for a tasty treat for yourself or with friends and family!"}
{"text":"I got the Sunshine waffle after a friend posted it and it looked beautiful.  The waffle was a little tough.  I knew that it was a different kind of waffle but I was still expecting something a little better.  The biggest disappointment was the overcooked lemon curd.  It was very lumpy as if the egg yolks were scrambled.  The saving grace was the delicious whipped cream and fresh raspberries.  I really expected more from a $9 waffle.  I don't think that I will be going back."}
{"text":"Being from Utah where it all began, Waffle Love is where it's at! Between the food trucks and store fronts, they are always packed. I'm not a dessert lover. Unless it's a waffle from Waffle Love! They make their dough with sugar crystals inside. Need I say more? Definitely not a healthy treat. But seriously, don't pass this one by. You'll be missing out!"}
{"text":"I had never tried Biscoff Cookie Spread before I went to Waffle Love Saturday night. Now I'm totally infatuated. God bless Belgium and god bless Waffle Love. *swoon*"}
{"text":"The waffle is nice and crispy with a soft middle. Definitely pricy and a little over rated"}
{"text":"I ate at Waffle Love's food truck at Junk in the Trunk Vintage Market, and it was delicious! I had the Dulce de Liege and it was absolutely amazing with the fried ice cream on top. I cannot wait to try more of their waffles."}
{"text":"Holy Waffle Love!!    My daughter and I came today to try this place after seeing them last year on The Great Food Truck Race TV show.    We shared the one called Cinna Bliss (I think it's called)?   

It was a crispy waffle with cinnamon and sugar topped with fried vanilla ice cream, whipped cream, caramel drizzle and topped with a fresh raspberry!     From the very first bite it was pure BLISS!!    

We will definitely be back soon to try another flavor!    

And the decor there is super cute!!   Love the hand painted signs !    

Such a fun little place!"}
{"text":"$8.50 for a waffle caked with sugar and a few pieces of fruit. I at it and now I feel like I'm in diabetic shock. But it was delicious."}
{"text":"Decided to try out the waffles here, I haven't been to the truck so I was super excited to see they had a storefront.
The waffles had a little funny after-taste to me, but my son didn't seem to think so. I had the waffle with strawberries and whipped cream. Although I initially thought the portion size could be a bit larger given that it was $6, the waffle proved to be plenty for me and my 2 year old.
Waffles had just the right texture balance between crunchy and chewy, and did not get soggy.
My son had a waffle with biscoff, bananas, and chocolate sauce. Super yummy!"}
{"text":"We ordered the grilled cheese waffle and the WORKS and split them both. A perfect lunch! We love love love love WAFFLE LOVE!"}
{"text":"I have had the soup and grilled cheese it was a party in your mouth. I also have had a few of the desert waffles. I'm gluten free they never have a problem accommodating me no matter the time of day."}
{"text":"Really great young \"hip\" spot for a savory snack and to bring kids for a great treat! Coffee is even great and I found to be fresh. I had a waffle with Nutella and strawberry's and found myself craving more when I finished it (even though I was filled). Great location with kind and friendly staff who assists in any way they can of explaining things, ingredients, or even offering small samples before you buy it!"}
{"text":"Just as awesome as the truck, but even better because the grilled cheese and tomato bisque is the bomb!  Hands down YUM! I also went a little crazy and didn't get my normal Works sweet waffle and got the Sunshine with the lemon curd and it was delish too!  At first we were a little annoyed because there was only one person working and she was doing it all and there was a wait, but soon realized that I think someone didn't show up for work.  She was holding down the place and doing the best she could with a smile on her face! As always Waffle Love you did not disappoint!"}
{"text":"I was so excited when I heard they were opening up a store. It's small, with a small menu but that's part of what I love about them. They do one thing and one thing only - waffles! And they do them perfectly. So if you are looking for a good eat, check out waffle love. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Cutest decor and convenient location!  The warm waffles are out of this world!  The toppings are generous and delicious.  The serving sizes don't seem huge but they are absolutely filling.  The fruit is fresh and the cream divine.

There is no bathroom located here which is unfortunate."}
{"text":"Amazing waffles!!! Service is great, prices are fair and the waffles are phenomenal.
Don't miss it!
Yummy yummy"}
{"text":"After eating at the food truck several occasions over the years, we were excited to have the Gilbert location.  Unfortunately, every time we go, we remind ourselves why we don't go back regularly:  the waffles.

The waffles on the food trucks seem to be consistently better.  I don't know if it's the equipment being used that's different between the two or what, but the store doesn't seem to have that deeper caramelization that you want from a good Liege-style waffle.

Otherwise, the toppings are good, and staff is generally friendly, albeit slow when there's more than a half dozen people in the store (I don't blame the staff, more just the waffle-making process.

I'd encourage the owners to take a second look to make sure the consistency in the store is on par with the truck.  Just my two cents..."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place!! I had one of their churro waffles a few days ago at their food truck and it was amazing. Let me tell you it was so good, I could not stop thinking about it and drove all the way to Gilbert from Scottsdale to have another one. This is just happiness"}
{"text":"$$$$$$   Do they think people in Arizona are made out of money? $$$$$$$$

Fresh ingredients. Super yummy! Super expensive! Little piece of thick Belgium waffle with creative toppings. Was not too sweet, which is nice. Extra little dollop of whipped cream is about $1.25."}
{"text":"Why oh why is there only ever one employee working?  I don't mind a wait but this poor girl is running around crazy doing it all and there is a line of six waiting to take order.  

Despite this she has a great customer service attitude so good job!  Must be stressful."}
{"text":"Waffle Luv:  What's not to love?  They serve a good waffle.  

The restaurant is clean, cool and kitschy (in a good way).  They have a good selection of waffle toppings and some great seasonal options.  They are fast and efficient.   The waffles are just the right size.  We never go away hungry.

The most important aspect of Waffle Luv is the fact that they serve a Gluten Free Waffle upon request.  We really appreciate this and hope that this kind of care for their community is rewarded.  

I would like to see more drink options there.  Maybe some different juices, even if was was just bottles of apple and orange juice.  If they had more drinks and could add bacon to their waffles I would be over the moon."}
{"text":"I want to love this place... But no syrup? Seriously? Even smothered in Nutella the waffle was dry. Bummer. Also, the guy told me they put sugar into the waffle so that it caramelizes. I did not experience this and I left wondering just how much sugar I just consumed. Cute place, maybe I'll come back and get something with cream on it. Something. Nutella is not enough to keep it from being dry."}
{"text":"This has been on my Phoenix bucket list for quite some time now. We were able to finally experience them when they came to Danzeisen Dairy. My husband and I both got the waffle covered in cinnamon and sugar topped with ice cream rolled in corns flakes. Holy YUM! The only reason I'm giving them a 3 is because I found a hair in my waffle. Very unfortunate thing to happen as I was thrilled to have finally experienced it. I tried my best to not let it ruin my meal, but it did. Not sure if it was the sweetness or the hair but I started to become nauseous after eating it. Take your chances my friends if you really wanna try it! :)"}
{"text":"Only got 1 star because we were so disappointed the store was closed after driving from Central Phoenix. Hours posted on Yelp state your open until 10pm on Sunday's. Please update your hours on Yelp or make the hours easier to find on your webpage."}
{"text":"I tried Waffle Crush with my Husband at their new location in Gilbert. It was delicious!! The texture of the waffles was perfect. Golden, but not dry. We had pumpkin and lemon raspberry. Not too sweet--just right. Love the decor in the cafe too!"}
{"text":"Waffles are small and not worth the price you pay. You are also asked to tip before you have received any service."}
{"text":"A bit on the pricey side but very good! If you're looking for a quiet but fun atmosphere, this is a cute little place."}
{"text":"Definitely worth the time and money. It's much nicer to be able to sit down indoors and eat your waffle. We used to go to the truck (which is still around I think) but we had to hunt it down and wait in a long line because everyone was excited to see it. Then we had to stand in the cold or rain and eat our waffle. Otherwise we could cram into a crowded picnic table with a bunch of strangers or take it home. And when you take the waffle home it's just not as good as a fresh hot one. Coming to the store is worth the trip and we always know it will be here. NO MORE CHASING FOOD TRUCKS YAY! The waffles are always good. Expensive for a waffle but so worth it. No more long lines either. I hope this restaurant makes its way to Utah if it hasn't already because that where we are headed in a few weeks!"}
{"text":"I was working in the next door building nd curiosity roamed in my mind nd had to try them.. i had the cinnamon butter nd cream nd was amazed how good it was.. great friendly service.."}
{"text":"Who doesn't love dessert? Waffle love is in a great location. Go do some shopping, maybe even eat some dinner and then come on over for a little slice of heaven. Lots of cool options and toppings for your dessert experience. Employees are extremely chipper and ready to help. They also have a really cool food truck which I think is how they are initially started. You catch them around town at your local food truck events."}
{"text":"This place took way too long for a waffle to come out. There was about 10 ppl in line and one worker. Some customers that ordered after me, had their waffle made before mine which was pretty upsetting."}
{"text":"No table service.  Felt it was overpriced for a serving of one waffle with plastic utensils and cardboard serving tray, and a coffee for $9."}
{"text":"This used to be my fav place. I would even chase around their Waffle Truck. But this store front has seen my business for the last time. 
My last three visits have been ridiculous. Visit one: waited nearly a half hour for one waffle. Store was empty. Waffle was small and dry. Very stingy on the toppings. 
That's another thing. Their waffles have progressively
 shrunk in size. 
Visit 2. After that visit, I thought I should call ahead and order. The lady on the phone sounded very confused. But, she supposedly took my order and said it would be ready when I got there. It wasn't. They had no recollection of it 20 min later when I got there. I walked out. Didn't have time to wait another half hour. 
Then there was the visit this weekend. There was a large group in front of me so I figured that is why I was waiting so long for our 2 waffles, and I was ok with that. This time I paid cash at the place and ordered there. I went up there once after about 20 min and said \" I would like our order to go please\" she looked at me funny and said \"ok\". I sat there waiting. Noticed people that came in after me were getting their waffles. Went up and asked the girl who had taken my order 40 MINUTES earlier and she first acted Clueless...like she had no recollection of my order! Then I started getting angry and reminded the 3 girls of my order and the way I paid and that all of them were right there when I ordered! They muddled around and put in the order they had forgotten to put in, got that wrong (forgot the cream---totally the best part, and my daughter's waffle was so dry she would not eat it). I asked the lady who appeared to be in charge \"you could at least offer us a free drink while we wait another 10 min\".  Yes, they probably remember that moment now. 
I am sad. I loved Waffle Luv. I raved about them to my friends and family. Even get heckled about my waffle love
Love. And the people in the truck were always cheery and funny. Which is why I gave it two stars instead of one. I Earned at least 3 free waffles with punch cards. But I have my limit. It has been reached."}
{"text":"Waffle Love is incredible, from its fresh, hip interiors, and eclectic cacti throughout the restaurant, to its chalkboard signs! 

Immediately when you enter the building you're greeted by friendly staff who enthusiastically share the menu options and most popular dishes. 

We ordered the Nutella Love, a Plain Leige with Strawberries, and the Grilled Cheese & Bisque. The waffles were cooked fresh and served quickly! Each one was uniquely presented, and DELICIOUS.

I'd come back JUST for the Tomato Bisque alone... it was the most amazing Bisque I'd ever tasted and I've tasted a lot of tomato bisque's! 

If you're a lover of breakfast, you need to check this spot out!"}
{"text":"Who doesn't love waffles?
If you tell me you don't, there is something wrong with you.

In all seriousness, waffle love is so good. The very first time I ever had waffle love was at a work meeting, and I've been hooked since. My go-to is the strawberries and cream waffle. But I am also a pretty huge fan of their waffle grilled cheese. 

The reason these waffles are so good isn't the fact that you can put pretty much anything under the sun on your waffle, it's the actual waffle itself. It's thick and soft but crunchy (? I don't know if that's the right word) on the outside.... and it is more like a cake than a waffle. 

AMAZING.

The truck is something I used to follow around to all of the food truck events, but since they've opened a store front, I'm even more addicted. Not to mention, it's in the area where I work. Ugh.
Talking about these waffles is making me hungry.

Honestly, if you're looking for a great waffle, visit these guys."}
{"text":"Closest I've had to real Belgian Waffles outside of Belgium! The Nutella is a classic add. I wish they had espresso drinks, as their coffee tasted watered down. I would absolutely go back for the waffles."}
{"text":"Waffle love is LoVE. Great waffles and a great little place to visit. One thing to note is there are no restrooms here. You need to go to the pizza place at the corner which is inconvenient. Once you bite into your waffle you won't find anything left. They are a perfect size leaving you wanting more. It can get pricey. We go for the dessert waffle and it's not enough to share so each person has to get their own."}
{"text":"Love... Love... Waffle Love!  My favorite is the Works with biscoff, whipped cream and strawberries.  We normally catch their food truck when they are on the west side, but we trekked all the way to Gilbert to eat at their store cause we were craving their waffles and had to have it."}
{"text":"We had ordered nutella Waffle with strawberries and the waffle was really hard probably because the batter was too thick. 
Not a good experience."}
{"text":"First went to waffle love as a food truck and loved it, when I found out they opened a store I had to bring my family to try it. It was so good and they had made one mistake but they were quick to correct it. We had the cinnalove waffle with caramel and bananas, it was delicious! Definitely will be returning. It's a cute, quaint place close to home with great food, and even greater service!! Easily one of the best breakfast/brunch places in Gilbert!"}
{"text":"Nice place for a sweet treat. Pretty safe menu choices. I kinda like my waffles with more Belgian sugar so you can taste the crunch. This place can add a bit more.. Otherwise it's decent enough. It'll be nice for the kids since the choices are more simple in taste."}
{"text":"This place is DELICIOUS! I have no will power...and unable to lose weight due to Waffle Love. Anyway, the customer service is great and the Waffles are amazing!"}
{"text":"Seating very uncomfortable, wait time was ridiculous -- by the time we finally got our food we didn't care how it tasted we were miserable.  But, it was delicious... don't come here for a meal though the waffle concoctions are basically hearty desserts."}
{"text":"Where else could you get a Waffle with Biscoff, Cream Cheese, and Peanut Butter? No where, thats where. Clear place. Never TOO busy and super friendly staff. Fun place!"}
{"text":"I love the Waffle Love food truck and finally had a chance to stop by the store. The store is small and decorated nicely inside. There are plenty of places to sit and enjoy a treat. When I arrived, I was the only customer so I received my waffle in record time. My favorite waffle is the Red Wonder. It tasted great. The employee who made my waffle was nice and courteous. I'm sure if there are more customers, the wait would be longer (as some other reviews mention) but my experience was great. If I'm in the area and craving waffles, I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Waffle love makes amazing waffles and To top it off they are quite generous. They supported one of my friend's family in a time of need- This family is a HUGE HUGE fan of waffle love and its an amazing thing for waffle love to support them -- read below to see what they did. Not only do I love them because their food is AMAZING but what huge hearts they have. THEY have my business for LIFE!

{"text":"Amazing amazing oh and did I say amazing!!! I had the works with banana and caramel drizzle and it was to die for my husband had the works with strawberries... Said strawberries were amazing and would have ordered 3 more if would have let him... A must try!!!! There coffee was good too not watered down."}
{"text":"God bless this place, waffles are the most underrated and underappreciated breakfast and dessert food in history, and Waffle Love is the only place trying to fix that. I would eat every meal here if I'm being honest with myself. Let's be honest, a good waffle is hard to come by, and they are impossible to make, but Waffle Love does what very few can, they even make the waffle fresh to order. As a person who's childhood was defined by eggo waffles, I really feel like a matured person when I eat the delicasy known simply as Waffle Love."}
{"text":"The Nutella Love w/ bananas ( or you can have strawberries )waffle was ridiculous. Nice and crunchy (the chunky waffle), with a large portion of fresh banana slices and homemade whipped cream made it a Nutella dessert for breakfast. Also had a fresh hot coffee with vanilla creamer. Wi-Fi was easy to use & Sierra the hostess was very friendly, too.  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Yummy waffles! Perfect texture and flavors. Super cute decor too! My fav is the Nutella love and the cinnamon sugar with cream cheese frosting."}
{"text":"Update your hours, it shows you are open from 8am - 10pm. Drove out there today and found that they are closed on Sunday"}
{"text":"Love me some Luv! Saw them compete on Food Network's Great Food Truck Race. Really wanted to give them a try. Have had a few liege waffles before. Was excited to hear they served them here.  Exceeded expectations. Luvly staff too.  So friendly and as warm as those delicious waffles. Wish there was one in Chandler, but this is close enough."}
{"text":"Waffles are good... Service slow. One person working, very slow and inefficient. Waited 30 min for my waffle."}
{"text":"Very tasty indeed!!

Many different ways to have a waffle prepared.

Sweet to savory.  Cinnamon to tomato soup!

I got the churro waffle. And yes. It was like eating a huge churro!! Scrumptious!!

My wife got the Cinnalove.  It's their take on a cinnamon bun. Tasted just like one!!

The inside of the building by wasn't anything out of this world. But I also didn't go there to be impressed with fancy decor.

The young lady who took our order was very nice.

Oh yeah.  I almost forgot.
Two words.

Cookie butter.

They have it.

On a waffle

Zomg!!"}
{"text":"Waffles with Strawberries and cream was soo good. I admit I was skeptical the Yelp reviews helped with decision. I'm glad I tried it the strawberries were the best fresh and juicy the cream was thick and creamy what else can I saw Loved it !!!!"}
{"text":"Always love my waffle love! Strawberries & Cream is my fav! My kids love rolled cinnamon or like mine with Nutella. What ever you choose, you will love it!"}
{"text":"I love Belgian waffles. LOVE. 

The idea of building your own waffle is freaking awesome. I always have to have Nutella on mine because I'm a little fatty. I like that they finally have a store now so you don't have to chase the truck around. I like both waffles from the truck and store front. However, the service is much faster at the truck. 

The waffles are cooked evenly through out and the toppings compliment the waffles. The ice cream is not too overwhelming, which I like.."}
{"text":"Very very slow. Waited 20 min for 3 waffles. Waffle was a bit doughy in center. Wouldn't make a special trip to come back."}
{"text":"I called to ask what directions are and asked for major cross roads. The lady on the phone told me she had a line with a snooty attitude and asked me if I had any more questions. I was going to go here for breakfast instead of my usual spot with my boyfriend. I love Waffle Loves food truck, but because of her crappy attitude, I will not be going here."}
{"text":"Happy when a Waffle Love food truck heads to the neighborhood. They are fast at preparing delicious waffles which are hearty enough to satisfy as both dinner and dessert."}
{"text":"From the moment you walk in, you're pretty much already drooling. This place is constantly filled with the delicious aroma of waffles. 

Waffle Love is a cute, turquoise-space that is great for pictures and also great for delicious waffles. 

I love that you can build your own waffle with all the toppings that you personally enjoy. Each waffle menu item is around $7~ and comes with one longer then the average size waffle. It may seem kind of not filling, but it's actually extremely filling."}
{"text":"Couldn't find the place, Yelp took me close to Outback. Tried to call for directions, no one there until 9am and it appears the call was routed to the main office.  Aren't waffles a breakfast meal?  And your not open till 9am???  Seems your missing a large part of the market.  Would have loved to try one of your waffles but I have to be at work at 8am. Not trying to be a jerk."}
{"text":"Went on Saturday July 2nd with wife and daughter.  We got the chocolate/banana, strawberries/cream, and the 4th of July special which was berries/strawberries.  If paying with plastic, you pay using an iPad.  It asks if you want to leave a tip even though there isn't any table service which I thought was weird.

Price is a little high considering the amount of food you get.  I wondered why I didn't see any maple syrup and it's because of all the whip cream and whatever else is in it.  The waffles were sweet and the fruits were very fresh.

We enjoyed our breakfast, but I think this was a one-time visit for us."}
{"text":"Half hour wait for a $7 waffle, are you fucking kidding me!!! Avoid this place for sure. If you want a great waffle find the Waffle Crush truck. Thanks for wasting a half hour of my daughters 10th birthday. By the way your staff are idiots. Why ask for a name for the order and when the food is ready call out the ordered item and not the name on the order. The girl got it confused and said they don't tell her the name on the order. 1 star only because fuck you isn't an option."}
{"text":"I was hoping to write a good, honest and objective  review about this place, but you'll have to just settle for my honest thoughts. I was craving a waffle and didn't want the traditional \"Waffle House\" or \"I-Hop.\" So, I deferred to Yelp in this situation and referred me to Waffle Love. My expectations weren't too high or low, but just looking for a solid waffle. The place is in San Tan Village and very well hidden in there. The inside is small and has a hipster vibe to it, but seems like a cool place to eat. I was in search of just a simple basic waffle with butter and syrup. When I went to order just that, the waitress informed me that they \"didn't have butter and syrup with their waffles.\" My heart dropped and  almost left the place. I get the need for offering creative options for your menu, but how can you not offer THE BASIC, TRADITIONAL WAFFLE?!? I was very disappointed by this. However, I did try a couple of waffle, which were almost too sweet to eat. The staff was very friendly and the customer service was good. Overall, the best way to describe this place, it's not quite breakfast and it's not quite dessert. If your looking for a simple, traditional waffle, I would recommend a place like Lo-Lo's. But if you are looking to on the adventurous side, then check this place out."}
{"text":"we must have come during a bad time. the line as very long and there were only two people working, one on the register, one making waffles. it took 45 minutes for us to get 2 waffles and a carmel apple cider. we wouldn't have minded if it had been good...it wasn't! my waffle was over cooked. it was dense, crunchy and dry...not at all like the waffle I was hoping for. the raspberries on my waffle were turning a weird shade of brown like they had been previously frozen. my aunt got a waffle with strawberries. the strawberries were old and starting to ferment. my Carmel apple cider tasted like lukewarm apple juice...I was not at all impressed. next time well just go to IHOP and will get more for for half the price."}
{"text":"Friendly service and a delicious waffle... That's the good. 6 raspberries on the waffle and a $1 charge for a tiny water cup for my 4 year old son... Not so good. With that said, the overall experience was good enough that I will give them another shot."}
{"text":"First time here today was very excited about too. The place is small quiet and very nice, but my waffle was undercooked at least to my taste. Not sure if that's how they make them but for me waffles shouldn't be cakey on the inside. I will try it again though!  Overall I did like it. You can style your waffle many different ways! Strawberries and cream. Nutella, cinnamon. Great ideas!"}
{"text":"I ordered a waffle with chocolate sauce ice cream and peanut butter. It was extremely dry and the waffle itself had no flavor at all.

I'm not quite sure what the allure is of this place but it was very unimpressive."}
{"text":"Who doesn't love a cinnamon sugar waffle with corn flake covered ice cream, topped with whip cream and a raspberry! Service is usually quick and friendly and the atmosphere is very positive. Only downfall is that IMO it's a little pricey, which is why I give it a 4 and not a 5. Definitely worth checking out next time your in Gilbert."}
{"text":"The Strawberry Nutella Love is literally the most amazing thing that I have ever eaten in my 22 years on this good earth. I tell everyone I've ever met about this place. If you need somewhere to go for dessert (or even if you don't), I've made the decision for you. You're going to Waffle Love. Freshly sliced fruit, freshly whipped real cream, and a fresh-off-the-griddle waffle. Going to Waffle Love now, bye."}
{"text":"I would definitely give this place more stars if it didn't take so darn long to get a single waffle even on a slow night but man are they delicious! They are generous size waffles and lots of flavor!"}
{"text":"Did not quite live up to hype. I enjoyed my Churro Waffle because it was quite unique. However, it was supposed to come with fried ice cream, which ended up simply being ice cream covered in breakfast corn flakes."}
{"text":"Best waffles around! So many options for toppings and even added more drinks to the menu! So glad the shop is so close to us!"}
{"text":"It was good, but way to expensive it cost 19 dollars for 2 waffles. The size was a quarter of what you get when you order a regular Belgian waffle.
Even desserts at fancy restaurants don't cost that much."}
{"text":"Waffles are excellent!  They are more dense than I expected but very good. They even have gluten free waffles. They do cook them on same equipment so those with Celiac would not be able to partake. There are many toppings for the waffles that are unique and tasty. 

Waffles are the only thing that they make so if you want eggs or meat you would need to go elsewhere.   Only concern was that they only had flavored creamer and no sugar for coffee. 

I do see myself returning and would recommend to any waffle lovers!"}
{"text":"This little place was amazing. All orders were made to order. Fresh warm off the waffle maker. The breakfast sandwich was a BLT on 100, pretty amazing. This was a nice sweet treat for the mid morning runs with the children. I used my Yelp coupon to add bananas. My only concern was the ladies did not wear hair nets. It would of been a 5 star if flying hair wasn't a concern."}
{"text":"This is an update review to my review I left a few months ago. The Owner reached out to me directly and apologized for the poor service within 24 hours. I had a feeling they were understaffed but was not a fan of waiting an hour for my 2 waffles only to have one of them made wrong and the waffles being sort of cold when we finally got them.

The owner made right with me by giving me a refund in the form of a free voucher and I took the opportunity to go back. I decided to go during a weeknight so on a Thursday night went back in and order 2 waffles again and as soon as I gave the order hit the timer on my phone. Within 7 minutes my wife and I had 2 fresh hot waffles. The presentation of the waffles was much, much better as well. I'm going to give these guys an updated 5 star review because they did the right thing and made up for it, which is rare. They clearly wanted my business.

If I could share one update though to everyone it would be make sure to get toppings that are in season. This isn't an issue with the store, but I know for sure off season strawberries won't taste as good on your Waffle."}
{"text":"Delish, unique, great service man oh man these are waffles that you will crave.  I had the churro waffle with cream and my son had the Cinnamon roll one...both were outstanding.  Quality products, fresh from scratch taste.  Prices were definitely reasonable.  Waffle Love is a great Dessert spot!"}
{"text":"Went to waffle love for an after dinner treat. We ordered the Cinna Bliss, Nutella Love and build your own- chocolate sauce and cream. My family enjoyed their desert and actually between four of us we could not finish the 3. Next time we'll order just 2 and split it all. I'm more of a savory kind of person so the next time I'll try the grilled cheese and bisque. The Sammy (breakfast sandwich also sounded delicious! Lots of parking and located in a strip mall type of area."}
{"text":"\"Every time I read ROFL, I hear Scooby Doo trying to say 'waffle.'\"

I know I wrote a review for their food truck last month but since that post, Waffle Love has opened their storefront!  I obviously had to post a new review after visiting.  ;)  So Waffle Love is a modest sized eatery with their art and charm still intact.  The atmosphere is great and the staff are friendly.  The customers though... ugh, not so much.  On this Saturday morning, the snobbiest and rudest people were out but hey, you can't choose who you serve.  Just stand in line, order, have a seat, and wait for your delicious waffles while ignoring everybody.

Have you ever had a liège waffle?  Liège waffles are a richer, denser, sweeter, and chewier.  Waffle Love serves up a delicious liège waffle.  I've had the Nutella Love and Red Wonder before so after much debate, we got the Sunshine [house lemon curd, raspberries, and cream] and Cinnabliss [cinnamon sugar waffle, vanilla ice cream, Corn Flakes, fresh cream, cinnamon butter, caramel, and raspberries].  I was partially tempted to try their seasonal Pumpkin but I didn't want to be a #basic like everybody else in the joint.  That and lemon curd sounded too tempting.  Like the first time I had Waffle Love out of their food truck, it was \"love at first bite\" all over again.  Still the best waffle I've had.  So come out and show Waffle Love some love!  Oh, and if you get a drink, pay the additional to get it \"dirty.\"  From what I can tell, there's some coconut flavoring and lime added to it.

On a side-note:  I'm loving their grilled cheese with the tomato basil soup!"}
{"text":"Yum! The waffles are to die for!! Sooooooooo good. They are worth standing in line for and chasing down. Not an everyday thing but maybe a once per month treat! These waffles are rich and the whipped cream is fluffy!!!! The actually store is trendy and cute. And the truck is fun to hunt down! Worth bringing the family out for."}
{"text":"I don't live in the area but I had a minor foot surgery on Tuesday and mom took me here hoping to make me feel better.....it worked! The young man behind the counter was super friendly and told us about the menu and what was popular etc.. I got the chocolate stuffed waffle, topped with banana and homemade whipped cream. O....M....G...it was delicious! They use chocolate sticks and push them inside so they get all nice and melted inside. Mom had the biscoff (cookie butter) ,strawberry and whipped. That was extraordinary as well. He informed us there is a food truck as well in town. I saw them on the great Food Truck Race but didn't know there was one in town! Find them and try one of these incredible waffles!"}
{"text":"This little cute boutique waffle restaurant has everything I wanted for breakfast and desserts. This was my first time visiting this establishment during my Shop Small Saturday food run. The staff were very welcoming. I was greeted with so many \"welcome to our store\" as I entered that I immediately felt like I was part of the family. The decor was very simple, and yet, its message was loud and clear. It's all about the LOVE. It's all about being happy. 
Let's break down the waffle love:
My 2 top picks are: 
-The Cinne Bliss: churro waffle, fried ice cream, and dulce de leche. This is da bomb!
-Nutella Love: waffle, Nutella cream, choice of fresh fruit
I went with a group of friends, so we were able to order quite a few different types of waffles. We loved everything we ordered. The grill cheese with tomato bisque was an unexpected delight. 
I highly recommend this place for gathering with friends, family day out with the little ones, and definitely a cool place to take a date for delicious desserts. I drove 55 minutes to get to this place, and I must say their waffles are worth every second of it. Stay awesome peeps"}
{"text":"I might be obsessed with Waffle Love! I first learned of them at the Gilbert Farmers market. Since, I've gone to the Gilbert store 2-3 times and I live in Chandler. The waffles are sooooo good. Especially with the cookie butter! I've eaten half my waffle and save the other half for the next days breakfast and it was still delicious! I'm a fan, typing this makes me eager to get back for more!"}
{"text":"Waffle Love is terribly cute and very tasty, but the price and service won't let me give any more than 3 stars.

I had the Cinnalove and it was all I hoped it would be. Crispy, sugary, drenched in frosting... Delicious! I also had a cold brew coffee. My husband had a strawberry Nutella waffle and also loved it.

I was fine with the cost as this is an occasional treat, but it really was far too expensive for the relatively low ingredient cost. We spent over $20 for a nice snack. The people ahead of us got several toppings and had an astronomical check. Each additional topping for the build-your-own options really adds up.

Another thing that is a pet peeve for me is that you have the option to tip (and we chose to tip 20%) but have to go up to the counter to get your own order. I felt that they should deliver it to your table or eliminate the option of tipping altogether.

The employees were friendly but were not organized and seemed to be fumbling around and overwhelmed even though few people were in the store. They also did not batch orders, but made each item beginning to end so that the wait time was excessive."}
{"text":"Thank you Waffle Love for coming to the State48 grand opening today. Your Waffles are spectacular and you are the best. The two young ladies that attended this event were the best! Yummy! The best advice i can give is that you should share. One waffle is huge!"}
