{"text":"This place is phenomenal. $35 for a 5 course meal is already amazing, but the quality and variety of food is astounding. I'm a self-professed foodie and generally won't give high recommendations but I was really, really impressed. So if you want delectable food, this is the spot to hit. The only thing is, the restaurant's chef is also the waiter so if you don't have 3 hours to spend, this is likely not the option for you. Service is great and he's super nice, but the trade-off for it is that your food will take a while. I also love that there's no fixed menu so you get whatever is fresh from the market that day. Definitely makes for an interesting culinary experience. Def highly recommended!"}
{"text":"We booked a month in advance with the intention of eating crickets.
Great idea! 
The taste menu for that evening included a salad, soup, crickets pan fried, crickets on french pizza and trout.
I had never had a food tasting experience of this nature. The main ingredients cooked were fresh and seasonal. Therefore, the good quality of the food was ideal for negating the effects of disturbingly cold temperature outside. 

The pan fried crickets tasted like bacon but far more nourishing. Never thought I would enjoy eating insects that much. Initially, it was more of a fear factor adventure but after the first cricket touched my tongue, I was in a new paradigm of cuisine. 
Everyone else I was with shared the similar view. 

The wine menu is there, I don't drink so I don't know if it was good or not. 
Instead, I had home-made ginger beer, another good idea.

The chef was gracious enough to answer questions about what else could be cooked and gave me \"the bible\" on the edible insects of the earth. 

Eating lower on the food chain is possible and it can be very tasty.

The experience is for sure unique because there is \"No Menu\", just be sure that if you are going for crickets, it is always nice to let Nathan (the chef) know."}
{"text":"I'm sorry to rate this restaurant so poorly, because they are nice people and they try hard. But it just didn't work for me.

The tapas concept is great, and we were gently and friendly-like advised of how it worked as we were handed menus. As other reviewers have commented, though, in practise, the dishes come out staggered with long gaps between them and if someone has their heart set on an entree, then sharing isn't always going to happen.

That's what happened with me and my friend. She wanted the Scallops [painfully overpriced at $16 for two, on much-too-al-dente pasta] and I wanted the Trout. There was a 10 minute gap between our dishes, which made for awkward dining. As for my trout (hay-smoked), it was nice, but just nice. The accompanying pea shoots were cooked into boiled-spinach-like oblivion and the potatoes were fine, but nothing special. The dashi broth offered nothing to enhance the dish, disappointingly.

The liver pate was the smoothest I'd ever eaten, with seasoning like BBQ Chinese pork (5 spice)? Pleasant, but not swoon worthy. The beet-based salad was lovely. Probably the best thing I had that night.

Perhaps my expectations were too high, but I had been told this place was a gem and expected unique flavours that just weren't delivered. Everything was okay, but just okay. And this restaurant cost too much for a modest meal for two ($70, with two glasses of port) for it to be just okay.

Also, a nitpick: if you're going to have a very dimly lit restaurant, choose a bolder typeface for your menu. It was very hard to read the superfine typeface they'd used."}
{"text":"Amazing food and great service that is one of a kind. Be ready for dishes that are different and great. 

The owner is a chills guy who cooks you what he has in the back. No menu. We went on a Thursday night so the place wasn't too busy. 

He fit us in and accommodated us extremely well!!! 

Thanks for the great experience. This place will be a regular spot for me."}
{"text":"Great restaurant, excellent service, no menu concept is brilliant. Last night's dinner was delicious and healthy with unique, fresh flavours. It seemed to turn into a private dinner party. We talked to Chef Nathan as he brought out the plates, each paired with fresh, herbed drinks. Nathan and his staff sincerely love what they do! It certainly gives one a new and positive appreciation for dining out."}
{"text":"Chef Nathan and his hostess were very friendly. Nathan's decision to drop the menu means he explains each course in person. Dishes were creative, with attention to presentation. Exotic spice combinations and vegetables made every taste feel like a first time experience. A lot of love and attentions went in to each course. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"The Atlantic, on Dundas west of Dufferin, is unassuming from the outside. The plastic sign, with its generic lettering and palm trees and sailboat all blue on a white background, is a camouflage, blending in with the numerous sports bars, cafes, and family restaurants that line this strip of Little Portugal. 

The interior, dark and wooden, is punctuated with decor that hints at the individuality and sophistication of the cuisine, while retaining elements of kitsch; on the wall behind our table, a small penciled drawing of a menacing thresher shark is bordered by two large, softly-coloured ballerinas. The cheerfully cluttered bar dominates the back half of the room, with a view into the tiny kitchen and a large poster on the wall: \"Good Things Come to Those Who Hustle\". 

Looking at the often-changed menu, it is quickly apparent that dishes are adventurous and atypical - roasted salmon fish head is offered in proud defiance of squeamish palettes. We don't order it, despite the server's recommendations, but our table of four agrees upon sharing the majority of the dishes available, tapas-style. 

Hummus arrives served with grilled flatbread and some flowery bitter greens. It is dark and full of spices, cinnamonney and flavorful. It would be great if there was more of the spread to go with all the bread, but who can complain for $3. 

Tempura cod tongues are less fishy than expected, meltingly fatty and tasting of the sea, in a perfect light batter and skillfully paired with kimchi to achieve a wonderful umami balance. 

Orwell cove mussels, small and tender, are devoured in their spicy green-juniper jerk sauce, which is first carefully spooned over the mollusks then greedily sopped up with Portuguese corn bread. It is refreshing to experience such a commonly standardized dish with a novel and daring flavour combination.

Pieroghis are masterfully executed: the sharp mimolette cheese, sebum edible flowers, goat's butter, pink beets, and young sage leaves create complimentary flavours, simultaneously delicate and fresh yet savory and full of depth. 

Ricotta gnuddi dumplings, covered in ash and served with nettle masala, are spheres of creamy lightness followed by a subtle, sophisticated complexity of smoke and chlorophyll. 

Hay-smoked trout is perfectly cooked, the skin crisp and delicious, on a bed of raw baby kale and sorrel-filled fresh pasta, bubbling on arrival with a coating of morel foam.  

Grilled quail is succulent, perhaps cooked in a process more involved than basic grilling, with slender roast parsnips and burnt roses elevating an otherwise seemingly simple dish.

Fried chicken, somewhat disappointingly after such an impressive display of culinary prowess, is just that, and though the drumsticks are delicious and not overly greasy in their golden batter, and the whipped potatoes are creamy and perfect, and the bitter green token salad yet another example of skillful counterflavour, the dish is somehow a flat tone in the evening's gastronomic symphony.

The first dish not shared was dessert: each had their own excellent rhubarb tart, with a firm yet-not-too-tough whole wheat crust, the soft tart filling adorned with a light cream and more edible flowery goodness, with the only objection to them being the generous diameter - perhaps we should have shared, as we did to sample a tobacco brulee, which, even with it's perfectly textured filling, did not appeal to most with its strong lingering aftertaste and nicotine-induced buzz. It's probably perfect for smokers.

Service is friendly and well-intentioned, but lacking in polish - serving utensils are absent on arrival of most dishes, and must be asked for, or, often, obtained ourselves from beside the bar when unable to catch the server's attention; our timing of asking for new plates and cutlery is a careful calculation involving how residual flavours from previous dishes may affect those coming up; knowledge of ingredients and cooking methods does not stand up well to basic questioning, and promises to follow-up after asking the kitchen are not fulfilled. 

However, these miscues in service, which actually do little to detract from a wonderful experience, cannot be solely attributed to the single waiter, nor the increasing demand on her time as the night progresses and the restaurant fills to near-capacity, but are perhaps reflective of the whimsical and creative approach of proprietor and chef Nathan Isberg. The components of the dishes often differ slightly from those portrayed on the menu, giving the sense that the words on paper are just a conceptual framework, with ingredients skillfully substituted and modified as seen fit. At the Atlantic, the food is art, stripped of intentional pretension and high price; Isberg is, without doubt, a talented artist."}
{"text":"Unexpected is the key word.

A friend and I were looking for a gastronomic restaurant to celebrate an event. After looking at the usual Gusto, Buca, Morton etc. and not feeling super motivated by the usual Toronto decor (although I have been to some and the food is nonetheless good), a friend of mine, cook at Enoteca Sociale, mentioned The Atlantic, but not really able to tell what they were doing except for \"very good\" and \"pricey\". Being two French girls craving for good food, we decided to take the chance and dive in the unknown. Note we read other reviews and we knew the menu was changed regularly, but no idea what was on the plate for the night (Oct 30 2013). We called to reserve at the opening - 7pm; and when my friend asked for the menu, she was told it was a single 6-course surprise menu. That sounds exciting!

So there we went, and yep, doesn't look very fancy with this blue and white Atlantic sign; the glass allowed us to see that it was empty and quite dark in the inside. Well, in we went, as the cook and the waiter stepped in behind us. We were placed at the \"nicest table in the house\", right by the window. A little chilly? No worries, a small heater is available for your comfort!

As soon as we were seated, the waiter, Scott, told us a bit more. He first asked us if we had any food allergy or particular food disliking, to which we said no. We chose to go with the wine bottle (hell yeah) but note that at this point, we didn't really know the cost of all this (we assumed a $60 food+bottle per person, as per the website). Scott came with a choice of three bottles, two Italians and a French (Rhone) and we picked the recommended Italian- I forgot the name, but will ask for it. What a nectar!!! An explosion of red fruit cranberry-like at the first sip, and an earthy after taste that was really unexpected. Excellent recommendation, and I know my vino. And from there, it only got better.

As the restaurant slowly filled up (around 14 persons for the whole evening, half full but it was Wednesday night), Scott came with a suite of 6 plates, sometimes one each, sometimes to share.

It started with root vegetable and cumin veloute, like my grandma would do in France. A good bowl of homemade soup!

At an adapted pace, we then went with the following dishes:

- Apple and house-smoked white fish salad with some vinaigrette reduction (I'm not sure of the leafs name but it looked like cloverleaves salad) =  I would have killed for the fish, it was perfect
- Cottage cheese gnocchi style ball rolled in alfalfa ashes, served with Brussels sprouts leafs \"blanchie\" =  from the morning perspective, this was my least favorite dish, and so was it for my friend. Cottage cheese doesn't have much flavour and the alfalfa remind me of my rabbit's food.
- \"Moules-frites style\": A bowl of small mussels cooked traditionally with a fry pan of potatoes quarters topped with grated Parmesan in sauce=  my fav. The mussels were excellent, so were the patates!
- Two small trout filets on a bed of mashed veloute sweet potatoes and cooked beets=  My fav #2. I usually HATE beets. Here, I could have licked the plate.

At this point, we had been at the restaurant for over two hours and none of us realized it. But one sure thing, we were getting very full. The waiter was full of attention and regularly came to check on us.

- Crème Brule=  Traditionally made, perfectly executed.

We talked a lot with Scott who then introduced us to the cook Nolan, whom we congratulated warmly for such 1 Michelin star like meal (and I have been to one star).  
Here is some info from the inside:
- Scott and Nolan are by-themselves all nights to serve and please all the guests. Note that sometimes Jason comes help with cleaning the dishes.
- Scott used to work at Enoteca but decided to join Nolan when this one came back from the States, after being selected among hundreds to follow very high-end cooking education.  
- It's been 4 months since the Atlantic follows the surprise menu model and does not intend to stop. They only do one service per night so no rush, but could do a 2-course menu for a reasonable price on demand. Keep it in mind. Another idea for later is to adapt a menu to a client request. All in all, they are very big on personifying their food to your liking. GREAT approach. Unexpected!! 
- If you haven't read reviews in the local newspapers, is because the staff would rather wait until the renovations of the restaurant are engaged and completed. (Yes, it will look better soon!) But they surely gain attention already, I suggest you try it before it becomes overly popular!

Finally, the bar across from them is a friend. Go there for a good whiskey to digest your diner!"}
{"text":"Definitely a fan. This is an old dive that's been renovated and is owned by a wicked guy named Nathan. So, by evening they serve local food. By local, i mean he'll tell you what town the lettuce came from, what lake the trout came from, and where he found those delicious frogs legs. 

Menu is quite large considering the size of the room, and it's varied - definitely French and Italian references. It's really affordable for the quality of food served, and the service is great. By great, I mean it's obvious these guys are hustling and trying to make a successful spot. 

So, after the dinner service is over, I strongly recommend sticking around on Friday nights, because it turns into a mad dance party. I've seen a smoke machine, lasers, pillow fights, a kiddie pool, disco ball, glow in the dark paint, you get the idea."}
{"text":"This is my favourite  restaurant in the city. Go in with an open mind and adventurous attitude and you will leave amazed.
The staff are extremely personable and friendly.  The food was delicious, the service was friendly, experience was unforgettable . 
You can tell the people at Atlantic have a true passion for food, and they do what they love. Highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Very interesting menu, good tasting food, but poor service and shabby decor.

This place is run by a chef who is focused on sustainable food choices (hence the crickets on the menu). I can see how his ingredients can turn some people off but if you have an open mind about food, I think this place can be a very enjoyable experience.

When I came here on a Wed night, we ended up just getting a fixed tasting menu for $70 (for 2 people plus drinks). There was enough food to feed us both but I could have probably eaten more if given the option. The portions are small so rethink this option if you are looking for a traditionally large meal. 

Everything we had was good (summer gazpacho, quinoa salad, ash gnudi with beet greens, smoked trout with potatoes, and chorizo \"paella\" made with barley/farro and served with 2 roasted quails). By far the gnudi was our favorite dish (see pics)- perfect texture, taste, excellent sauce). The paella was my least favorite dish because it was very, very dry and chewy and I just prefer traditional rice in this dish. The birds were good though.

The tobacco crème brulee they usually have on the menu didn't set properly that night- the waitress apologized on behalf of the chef and offered us to taste it before committing...the taste was great so we kept it; just a very runny texture. I also didn't taste any tobacco but maybe the whole dish was off that night. 

The service was lacking because our waitress was brand new and didn't have any help. Drinks took forever, we never got water refills, and she unfortunately had no knowledge of the menu or the chef's concept. I give them a break on this one though because they were actually holding a private function in the back that night and weren't going to open at all.

Decor here is nothing worth mentioning really- a dark blue, shabby room with some nautical references in need of renovation. Not a bad place for a casual night but not somewhere you want to hold a birthday/other celebration in my opinion.

Overall, I think the food made up for the lack of attentive service. The chef's creativity would have me coming back at least once more."}
{"text":"The best dining experience I have had in Toronto, hands down. The emphasis is absolutely on 'experience' as this was a 3 hour event, where we had no idea what was coming next and even how many dishes there were going to be!

We were served by the owner who I had to refrain from hugging at the end of the meal. Service was attentive and amazing; each course was top notch (often incorporating elements from one into the next, such as this incredible thai broth that featured in multiple dishes) and our veggie friend was catered to without any problems. 

Simply wonderful."}
{"text":"Stumbling into the Atlantic in the Brockton village is like heading to a dimly lit fisherman's shack or cabin crew's hide out while your favourite indy bands play in the background.  It's a very laid back and casual atmosphere, and off the beaten path
This is a seafood tapas restaurant so if that's not what you're looking for, don't go!  They also change their menu daily or every few days so its hard to really know what to expect but they are creative with their food and that's what I appreciate.  Service was helpful and informative and not intrusive and the prices for the dishes are equally matched to the portion sizes."}
{"text":"I have only put one more star for the quality of the food. Frankly speaking, the food was tasty at least (whew!). 

We went on a Monday night. The chef was the only guy in the kitchen... and one server for the entire hall. I guess it is \"fair\" that it took us 3 HOURS for the entire meal. The couple beside us even rage quit in the middle of the dinner. 
(Hello, Hello?!  normal date plan will not include a 3 hour long \"I AM HUNGRY -WHERE IS MY FOOD\" dinner.)

They recently started a \"No Menu\" concept, which means they will only offer a $35 (not including alcohol) prefix menu.

So is it supposed to be like: you got invited to your friend's and just wait for he/she to surprise you? Excuse me, if my friend starves me and gives me dishes in a Tapas portion with an average 30 minutes time gap in between I will totally just cook for myself.

Their wine is at $60 a bottle or $13 a glass. (they do have beers, but the server never told us :/ Neither did he tell us what were we getting for the prefix menu...) So it became quite awkward for us while waiting for food, since we had absolutely no idea how many dishes were coming. (and it took so LONG) I even ended up thinking : should I drink my wine faster or just sip?  

In the end we got in total 3 appetizers, one main (share dish) and one creme brulee for 2. 

After the creme brulee, we waited like little naive kids expecting something else since the server passed by our table so many times without giving us the bill or asking about how we were doing.  Then, after 20 mins, he passed us the bill. Sweet. I think that was when I got seriously irritated and could not wait for another 20 or 30 mins for him to bring us the card machine so that we could just get out asap. It was11PM for god's sake! We came in around 7:45PM.....expecting to go home arnd 9:30PM :/ Blurgh! So we had to walk to him at the bar and ask to pay (we are such good kids). Still paid 15%+ tips but we only told him the amount including tips separately so somehow his math skill wasn't kicking in so he asked whether or not we should pay more. (HAHA!  VERY FUNNY.) 

Btw, I have to say that the tobacco creme brulee was epic, loved it.  I should have just come by myself so when I order the prefix they can give me the whole creme brulee. YUM.
(Hope they don't cut the creme brulee in half to serve customers who come alone.)

Last but not least, we did notice a table beside us are getting some different dishes. so we got suspicious and checked the hand written today's prefix menu on the window when we got out. There were items on that menu we were sure we did not have or not familiar with... maybe they ran out, who knows, the server never told us.  Voilà!


Conclusion:
Not recommended unless you are not that hungry from the beginning and willing to spend 2~3 hours for a mysterious menu. GOOD LUCK!"}
{"text":"My first visit was part of a large group that shared various dishes so we had good coverage of the menu. A tiny kitchen, cooking area and fridge seem to limit the dishes. I will say that everything had great flavour - often accentuated with too much salt or garlic but nothing went to waste. Based on food alone I'd rate 3-star but minus one star for the value. 

Much like the 275ml bottles of Duggan's number 9 sold at full size beer prices the plate of ravioli is $10 for 10 tiny raviolis. Other dishes were the size of half appetizers at most restaurants but similar prices. Wine list is a bit pricey too for wine that was served room temperature - one bottle had gone bad and was quickly replaced (on the house). 

Certainly low in the value category for a low rent area. This is Dundas West and Lansdowne after all. Sounds like the chef is capable of more and could do more by serving more."}
{"text":"Great food but even better experience!

There is no menu but as long as you're adventurous eaters there should be no problem. If you're not I'd suggest telling them in advance when you make the reservations what foods you have issues with.

We had a spicy soup with rose oil and peppers, a salad with indian spices and a popadom, fish cooked sous vide and an apple tart- the apples were cooked in a tempura batter.

The meal took almost 3 hours but if you're with a group that shouldnt be an issue! The wine is cheap! $6/7 a glass and he'll just leave the bottle on the table- honour system!

The chef is an interesting guy, I'd suggest chatting with him!

Come with a group and consider it your whole evening booked."}
{"text":"Overall:
The tapas style dinner I had at The Atlantic a week ago was the best dinner I'd had in Toronto in awhile, I would definitely recommend it. 

Food - 
The food was yummy, interesting, and filling though we honestly had to ask about some of the items on the menu haha
The portions were actually a bit bigger than I expected for trendy tapas in Toronto, 4 dishes between 2 of us would have been plenty
Faves were probably the perogies and whitefish mmmm

Remember, it's tapas style so you should order and eat accordingly!
2 of us ordered 5 dishes, and shared them all as they came out - this is a great way to try some new and interesting food that you may not normally order
It also means the dishes come out one at a time as they're ready. The server explained this to us, so not sure why some people seem quite confused by this style of dining. This was great because it means every dish came out hot and you had the proper time to enjoy it without everything getting cold.
This would probably be hard to do with anymore than 4 people

Atmosphere/Price
Super cute and cozy, mostly tables of 2, great date spot
Make sure you like the person you're with, your meal will probably take at least 2 hours due to the tapas style. So maybe avoid having a 1st blind date here :) We actually joked during our meal that thank goodness we liked each other and we weren't on a date, or an awkward meet up. 

Some people have said The Atlantic is expensive - for fresh, local food and great dishes I didn't think it was that expensive.
The smaller dishes/plates were $6-11 and the 'mains' (meat dishes) were around $16. 
This is cheaper than appetizers in some greasy pubs, but yes when you order a few menu items it adds up
Drinks aren't the cheapest, but pretty standard. Glasses of wine $11+
We spent less than $50 each with tax, tip and drinks

Service
Great! The server was attentive, explained the best way to dine there, and even explained some of the ingredients or dishes we weren't as familiar with in a way that didn't make us feel silly.


Food Details:

The menu had a lot of interesting twists on classic dishes and it seems to changes fairly frequently, perhaps even daily. We got the gist of most dishes, but there were 1 or 2 we weren't 100% sure of all the ingredients, but thought why not try them since it's tapas style. If there's something you don't like as much you can just wait for the next dish.  We opted to order 1 appetizer, 2 smaller plates and 2 'main' plates. We probably would have been just fine with 1 main plate, it was a lot of food.

Food
Black Chick Pea Hummus
Came out quickly, super yum and flavourful
Served with several slices fresh baguette

Potato Leek Perogies
These were amazing! Perfect crispiness, and I really liked the addition of leek and the cream was fab. 
Pretty decent portion - 8-10 mini perogies

Hay Smoked Beets, Winter Veg, Gnudd Coated in Ash
This dish was not at all what we expected it to be, but we enjoyed it
We mistakenly thought the hay smoked beets were the main part of this dish, but it was actually the Gnudd aka gnudie
The gnudie and hay smoked beets 
Someone other than our server placed it on our table calling it the gnudie, and we were quite confused. The gnudie coated in ash almost looked like mini potatoes, and we were expecting beets. We actually flagged down our server who explained that gnudie is like gnocchi but softer, and the beets were a secondary part of the dish. He didn't make us feel silly at all for being like \"uhhh excuse me, are you sure this is ours? We ordered the beets.\" ha

Whitefish
This dish was awesome! The whitefish was cooked perfectly and had a perfect crispy coating. We both couldn't stop saying mmmmm

Quail with Sage Gravy, Whey and Barley
The sage gravy was so flavourful an awesome, I probably could have eaten spoonfuls of that and been happy haha
I'm not the biggest fan of quail and therefore didn't love the main part of the dish, but the gravy, whey and barley were all super yum. 
This is the only dish I ordered that I may not have when I go back again"}
{"text":"Had an enjoyable dinner at The Atlantic. A Wednesday night, slushy snow outside, not many other patrons in the restaurant. Still a welcoming, intimate atmosphere, and somehow the large image of a dead whale on the wall felt just right. 

Decided on the tasting menu. Seven dishes including, soup, salad, starter, pasta, fish, duck and dessert. In the beginning, I was wary of a high pretension level, seeing as the soup had \"truffle foam\", the salad was \"probiotic\" and the starter had \"cedar ash, made in house\" sprinkled all over it. As the meal moved forward, and my consumption of champagne cocktails increased, I relaxed and let the foam and ash wash over me. And I settled into the fact that the food was well done and I was in fact enjoying it quite a bit. 

Favourite items were the sunchoke soup with hazelnut granola, the duck with turnip and mayonnaise, and one of the desserts, which was flourless and chocolate. Least favourite items were the other dessert, a cake made of beets, and the arctic char, which had an extremely smokey flavour. Although the barley risotto which accompanied the char was absolutely lovely. 

The service was almost perfect. Attentive without being too intrusive, and the servers seemed to come to the table at exactly the right times. 

Would definitely go back to the Atlantic for the tasting menu, but would also be interested in trying some of the tapas-style menu that others have talked about. 

P.S. Short, but sweet cocktail menu."}
{"text":"Went here on Wednesday night. The menu is really fun. Three sections - things beginning in A at $5, things beginning in B (such as Bivalves) for $8, and things beginning in C for $13. 
We ended up having some nice cured trout, oysters, red slaw with feta, a wonderful seafood soup, and some snails. I have to say the snails were not really worth the time and effort - mostly the effort, as they were pretty much unattainable despite much poking and prodding and fishing with toothpicks. But the other dishes were well prepared in a country/rustic style with good flavours. 
The decor is old school diner with a dark-lit warmth. It worked well. Fun and playfulness with food was the theme, and it worked. (except the darn snails)"}
{"text":"Nathan is amazing.  Food is exciting, interesting, a bit experimental and often something you have never tried before. The wines are fantastic. There is no menu, no price and the best part is that you never know what wonderful surprise you will get. Not just a restaurant, this place is where you go to have a very interesting, lovely night. 

Thank you Nathan.  You have no idea how much I appreciate this restaurant and all the amazing times I have had here."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant! The food was divine.  Fresh and local ingredients, simple dishes that exploded with their own unique and complimentary flavors and the dishes were never over powered by sauces. Excellent service and great atmosphere. I can't believe it's within walking distance!"}
{"text":"Visiting from San Francisco, heard about Atlantic from a friend of a friend, and approached with trepidation, as I always do with new restaurants. When calling for a reservation, I was bemused by the voice mail message, a cacophony of crashing pots in the background, a confusion about days of service. What was I getting myself into? And when we arrived, the first diners that night, the menu had yet to be printed. What was I getting myself into? But my fears were melting away as I sipped a perfectly concocted Champagne cocktail. The hostess/bartender/server/busser/sommelier (all one gracious gal) offered sage advice on putting the meal together and finding the wines to match.
But the food! Each dish was as close to perfect as one could hope for. The variety presented on the menu, not just in ingredients but in seasonings and preparation, was a perfect balance of diversity and confluence of a singular vision. Each ingredient chosen with care, and prepared in a way to enhance its natural beauty and flavor. I could go through each delightful dish, but that is so boring. It is the passion, skill and attention to nuanced matching of flavors that distinguish both the menu as a whole, and each plate delivered that has made this my new favorite restaurant in Toronto. Well okay,  I will describe a few dishes. The Lobster Bisque had the deep yet delicate aroma one always hopes for but rarely gets. A combination of essence of Lobster, Ocean and Culture, when one is both at service to the Lobster, and yet masters the difficulty of coaxing the true flavors out of their shell. And the Quail, cooked perfectly, balanced flavors and textures in the salad of arugula and nuts, and enough acid to play off the rich smoke of the bird. But stop reading this and go. Was there a flaw? Well I think if the lone front of the house person had a sidekick, that would have been nice, for everyone. I would gladly work without wanting tips or pay, if I was just allowed to share family meal. If someone wanted to apprentice, to be close to a chef who is truly talented, the learnings would be more than adequate compensation."}
{"text":"Nathan Isberg doesn't need my help. 

If he can stick with it, he is on track to singlehandedly revolutionize dining out. We read about his No Menu, No Prices, No Choice formula (this apparently is new at the Atlantic, so read up on it first so you won't be complete surprised) and shot right down. 

We had an extraordinary meal - 4 of the best dishes I have had out in an eating place (I think Nathan is pushing away from the word \"restaurant\"). 
And, the beauty of not having to choose is a delight. Just let it come, whatever it might be.
Yes, the lighting is low, but once you remember that you don't have to read or choose, who needs reading level light anyway?

If its label as a \"fish\" place puts you off, fear not. - The dishes were almost vegetarian. Each was a cacophony of oddball but delightful flavours. THIS is what a professional cook can do better than a home cook - surprise and delight with little additions, dashes and tweaks.

Funny though, while his new No Choice, No Prices formula relieves diners of the anxiety of Choice at the start of the evening, it rolls that anxiety over to end of the night, at the Settling Up moment. We've all stressed over the appropriate tip amount - 15%, 18, 20, on the pretax or after tax total? But figuring out \"what was that meal worth\" entirely -- $25, $50, $75? --  is hard. Here we are 5 days later and I am still wondering what the right amount to leave is."}
{"text":"Wow. The food here is great. And so is the service. You can't find many restaurants offering $3 appetizers AND have top-notch service. Try the ceviche!"}
{"text":"Atlantic is a place I can return to again and again. And I have. Casual friendly knowledgable service.
The food is thoughtful enough to be interesting but doesn't cross into the overly experimental. Simplicity works here. Sharing dishes allows for many flavours and adds to the experience that I think they intend. 
Unpretentious but refined."}
{"text":"Came to this quiet neighbourhood for a dinner with some friends on a weeknight, and it was was an okay experience. It's certainly a far drive out from the highways, so I was a bit hesitant to go, but how can I say no to a friend meet-up? :) Went with an chef's choice menu (omakase, tapas-style) and the dishes were good but service was pretty slow and it was certainly pricy at just over $50 per person. I'm not sure if everyone walked away full. 

The downs: it's a bit awkward to share food plates between three or more people too, especially since what arrives at your table isn't really portioned out, so you each pick your own amounts from the plate. Also, we waited a half-hour for our first dish to arrive, which was a salad. The furious look on my friend's face when he saw it was to die for.

The ups: dishes were unique and some of them were very tasty. It seemed no one was as big a fan of the chanterelles as I was, and I was practically hording the black cod away from everyone (your my friends, but you don't beat black cod, sorry guys). Our server was really nice and friendly without being clingy. Also, their beer selection is a bit on the unique side and reasonably priced.

Place does accept credit cards, so bring whichever form of plastic you want."}
{"text":"The Atlantic is mind-blowingly awesome.  

Do you remember that really great night you had when you were younger?  Things were going really well for you.  You'd smoked a bit and had a few beers and your favourite band was playing an endless version of your favourite song.  It felt like the whole world was riding on the same wonderous wavelength.  Well, that's what it feels like to have dinner at the Atlantic.  

You know you're at a great restaurant when the diners at every table are openly sharing gasps of delight with every dish's arrival.  Experiencing greatness is a collective experience.  And at Atlantic, greatness abounds.

A salad of flowers and nuts is wonderfully unique and delicious.  Tacos with corn smut (google it) are the best tacos ever.  Pasta is perfect.  Halibut is divine.   Everything is fresh, inviting, inventive and perfectly executed.  The chef plays the role of conduit more so than creator.  Mother Nature is never upstaged. Each dish is homage.

Even our waitress projected the same vibe.  Like everything else at the Atlantic, she was delightful and beautiful in a way that suggested humility, honesty and a kind of centeredness.    I think Buddha and Christ would really enjoy sharing a meal here.

Thank you, Yelpers, for guiding us here."}
{"text":"Great food experience, but a bit pricey.

I came here with 4 friends for dinner at about 8pm. We were all incredibly hungry and sort of confused by the menu so we asked the chef to prepare a meal for us. The menu wasn't confusing, it's just that it included things that some of us have never heard of, and half of the people in our group had never had tapas before. I was really impressed that the menu had the day's date on it. I guess that means that their menu changes daily. Exciting!

The dishes:

Red cabbage and... something else salad with plum umami dressing and black walnuts. This was very tasty and refreshing, with a bit of a fishy taste to it, which I liked. 

Black rice risotto with chantrelles. I wasn't a huge fan of this dish, but I was so hungry that I couldn't care. The mushrooms were quite tasty, but I didn't like the rice too much.

Mussels, which were cooked just right.. a little rare, with a nice sauce to it. I wish I had bread for it. In fact, I wish I had bread for the whole meal. It took a while for things to come out (two hours in all), and I felt really hungry until about halfway through the meal.

Onion tarte with gruyere cheese on top (which I peeled off). This basically tasted like a French onion soup, sans soup, and it was my third favourite dish of the evening. Sooo savoury and delicious!

A plate of grilled bread, a GIGANTIC hunk of cheese (not sure what kind) and spicy olives. I kind of wish this came at the beginning of the meal. It would have been a good appetizer and would have slowed the hungriness a bit. We barely got through the cheese. On friend ended up going home with the rest of it, which was about half the size of my fist. We joked about him eating it in the car on the way home. I'm not entirely sure he didn't.

A tarte with duck hearts, kidneys and such. I'm a big fan of this stuff, so I LOVED this. It's my second favourite dish of the night. My friend beside me remarked that it was good, and you wouldn't even be able to tell that it was organs. I could tell and I was in heaven.

Jerk black cod on rapini, fregola pasta, soupy sauce and an egg cooked sous-vide. The winner of the evening. The black cod was meltingly tender with a bit of spicy bite. The egg had a very interesting texture to it. Sort of velvety and soupy. The whole dish was amazing and I wish I could have had the whole thing to myself.

This was a really great experience... fine dining in a casual atmosphere with a really great server. It was a bit pricey ($35 per person) but we figured that it was an experience we'd never had before and the quality was really quite good. I wish that the portions were a bit bigger. We all came out just a little less than full, which I guess is a good thing considering this was at the end of the holiday season.

They take debit, not credit cards."}
{"text":"It took way too long to get our food.   It wasn't that tasty but definitely healthy. After the 2.5 hr affair,  my friend and I went looking for pizza. That's how hungry and dissatisfied we were. It isn't that expensive to hire a waitress to help, gees.  This chef have to serve and cook the same time,  no wonder it takes 3 hrs.  In the end we both got diarrhea too. We both regret paying so much.  So I cannot say anything good about this place but  just never again!"}
{"text":"Visited on Dec 6,2014. Party of 7. Reservations are a must, they only have one seating per table per night. It was a bit difficult to make reservations as they aren't open on certain days to answer phone-calls and didn't promptly return messages. It's good to make reservations at least 2-3 weeks in advance to ensure you can accomodate a large party on the day you want. Some of the earlier reviews are different when the resto had prices and menus. The concept of no no prices and no menu is what drew me to this place.  

The place was very dark and looked closed from the outside. It felt like a private dinner for the first hour as the other seatings were there for another hour. The service was excellent. The length of dinner was something that we had to negotiate. I usually allocate 45 min to an hour for a dinner. This could have easily stretched to 2.5 to 3 hours but we wanted to check out another event afterwards. We ended up asking Mary to speed up the last 2 courses to keep dinner within 2 hours. Discuss this with the server in advance. 

Even though there is no menu they do have some general guidelines. Mary the part-time server mentioned they generally have no red meat or chicken. Most of the items are purchased from local markets like Dufferin Grove. Nathan was able to accommodate a lactose and cashew free meal. A unique beer they had was Chimay, never tried that one before. i got the Mill St organic.   

First course - Squash soup, ghost peppers, persian spices, lentils. It was very creamy and slight heat with a floral taste.

Second course - Salad with cheese, cauliflower which was smoked over charcoal, poached egg. The smoked cauliflower was a highlight of the meal as most of us had never tasted this before.

Third course - Smoked trout with a jerk broth, kimchi garnish. I didn't taste the jerk in the broth. The fish was wonderfully prepared. 

Fourth Course - Jasmin honey custard, apple pecora, grains of paradise and shaved apples. Not too sweet and a fitting end to the night. 

I don't consider myself a foodie as you can tell me reviews generally do not include an essay about each dish. I think the food was one of the best I've had in Toronto in terms of uniqueness and taste. I felt it was worth of $50 -$75 dollar meal. I pride myself on being unique and paid $0 for my dinner. I opted leave me business card and barter for my dinner. I personally emailed Nathan to provide value to him other than paying for my dinner."}
{"text":"I think The Atlantic stole my I-Pod! Bon Iver, Fleet Foxes and Regina Spektor...on rotation. They had me at hello or should I say AHOY!

I feel really mixed about this place but this could be due to the delicious bottle of wine I shared with my friend (Cote Du Rhone - order it) that may have impaired my judgement. I guess I'm a cheap drunk. No worries...still read on, I promise you can trust this review.

Reading the menu online, and the reviews off yelp, I was expecting a seafood/fish overload, but was a little disappointed by the 'day's menu offerings. When we arrived they informed us that a few items sold out on the menu. I was a little thrown off by this but at the same time you come to accept this possibility at these type of restaurants. Actually comforts me that they're not over buying ingredients - meaning no freezing!
They also change their menu daily or every few days so its hard to really know what to expect. I get bored easily so a constant changing menu is perfect for me. 

Highs
- The prices are equally matched to the portion sizes. I was surprised at how much was given for 'tapas' style plates.
- They are incredibly creative
- Service is really friendly and helpful. Everyone seems like a big family. They decorated the restaurant for Christmas - not only did they have a christmas tree, lights and an honorary santa claus stumbling in at 11:30p..they also had a snow machine. A SNOW MACHINE! 
- Great music

Lows
- Some of the dishes lacked real flavour or were a bit over salted. 
- Unfortunately we were unimpressed by the only two seafood dishes we ordered. the Lobster Carbonara (It's lobster month) - The capers over powered the whole dish and made it inedible 
AND Scallops with black beans - They were slightly undercooked and the beans were el dente but I enjoyed them more than the scallops. To be fair we were both extremely full by this point and scallops+full stomach = probably not a smart choice. 

Overall, I give The Atlantic a 3.5/5. I loved the ambience, the service and the creativity in their dishes. I just wasn't wowed yet by the flavour and went for the seafood, coming out with an empty net. Saying this though, I'll definitely go back because I did enjoy half of the dishes we ordered and want to give them another chance."}
{"text":"I was lucky enough to attend 2 special vegan tasting menu dinners at Nathan Isberg's new restaurant Atlantic and I can sum the experience up in two words: corn smut. 

Both tasting menus included huitlacoche, the south american corn fungus and I was surprised it find it enjoyable. I'm usually fall into the mushroom despising spectrum but the huitlacoche vegan risotto with shaved asparagus and bread crumbs at the first dinner was really an amazing dish.

For dessert the fried figs in coconut milk and maple syrup was a resounding hit. The cocoa, grapefruit and lavender risotto dessert served at the second tasting menu was less enjoyed(one person described it as 'soapy') but points for creativity were awarded.

Wednesday nights they spin vinyl and turn into a watering hole. I like this cozy spot and appreciate their effort to serve food that is lower on the food chain (think crickets). Especially in a city that seems to have gone all retarded gaga for pork products."}
{"text":"My favourite new restaurant. Highly recommended. 

Food is very reasonably priced with lots of options changing every night. The food is locally sourced and the combinations are always unique. There is usually something mind-blowing every night that our table ends up ordering a second round of.

The lighting is perfect, and the vibe feels casual but unique. Great wine and cocktail list also if you're not hungry (but, you should probably at least try that night's dips or breads, for $3, it's worth trying).

I still haven't built up the courage to try the crickets."}
{"text":"Looking for fast food, fast meal walk on by!

Looking for a unique, entertaining, fantastic food adventure, don't miss out on an evening with Nathan.

His team and him did a great job! There's something about walking into a restaurant, not getting a menu, and being serve one eclectic dish after another and letting your taste buds get a awesome workout.

Go in, settle down, chill and let your taste buds enjoy the roller coaster adventure.

If You like the decor of Ruth Chris and other upscale place, Avoid this place, but you will be doing so at the cost of missing out an unforgettable food experience at the hand of a very creative chef.

No menu, no price makes for an interesting end of dinner conversation on the  dollars value you give your experience!

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I was really excited to try Atlantic when I heard it was from the man behind my old favorite, Coca. So we finally tried it a few weeks back on a weeknight and it is really good - I can't wait to go back!

Cool space - very sort of fisherman's shack style, relaxed with nice wood and a cozy feel. The staff adds to the cozy vibe with their friendly and calm demeanor.

The menu is, as you should be able to guess from the name of the place, very seafood oriented. All the items are priced low, which is a bonus! Yummy oysters, really good cured trout (and a lot of it), but not so good snails. They were IMPOSSIBLe to eat. I think I managed to get one and a half out of a pretty big heap before I just gave up out of frustration. The waitress even saw our frustration and tried to help, but she had a hard time too. You would think after that she wouldn't have charged us for them, but since the dish was only $4, it didn't matter. Everything else was delicious.

If you like seafood, cool laid back vibes, and are anywhere near Dundas and Brock, head over to Atlantic."}
{"text":"Dining Experience: Dinner  
Specialty: Portuguese Fusion 
Menu items: Littleneck Clam & Lobster Chowder, Trout Gravlax & Wakame Salad and Tartiflette. Paired with Vinho Verde.

Atlantic, formerly a family-owned Portuguese restaurant in the up and coming Ossington foodies area, is now home to Chef Nathan Isberg. Having worked the kitchen of Coca and Czehoski, Isberg has transformed this spot into an intimate, cozy and hip restaurant. 

Using produce, low-fat/high protein meats and keeping in line with the area's Portuguese feel; the Atlantic features an array of fusion tapas-style dishes that will keep you fascinated with its unique use of ingredients.

With a similar fusion style thematic as Chef Susur Lee's Lee on King Street, Atlantic's Isberg offers a daily menu of 10-12 unique dishes inspired by European/Mediterranean staples. At any given day, you might find anything from Escargots to Risotto, Sardines and even Crickets. I guess this is what Isberg meant by low-fat/high protein meals.
Although we did not get the pleasure of being offered the crickets, we did decide on a very unique blend of its most popular items. On a cold winter day, soup seems like a no-brainier to kick-off a meal; Atlantic's Littleneck Clam and Lobster Chowder did the trick.

Notes of garlic, cream and paprika were present throughout this dish. The dish is called Littleneck as it refers to the size of the clams. In the shellfish hierarchy, littlenecks are the second smallest version of clams. Being as though this is more of a tapa, I can appreciate its use on this dish. 

Following the fishy route, we also decided to try the Trout Gravlax & Wakame Salad.

Gravlax is not an ingredient but rather a way of serving fish. Gravlax is the style of curing salmon or trout that has been cold smoked. It almost tastes like sashimi or smoked salmon, but I rather say its a marriage of the two; I just hope they never get a divorce.
To keep Wikipedia alive, for those of you that don't know, Wakame salad is simply a seaweed salad sprinkled with sesame seeds, japanese style.

I have only described the first two dishes, and it seems I still have a long way to go. So bear with me as our next item, Tartiflette, will have you calling for reservations in a heartbeat. 

Tartiflette at Atlantic is a potatoes, leek and cave-aged Gruyere cheese potato gratin infused with Riesling. The way in which Isberg is able to elevate the quality and tastiness of the ingredients is what took us to heaven once we tasted this dish. Cave-aged Gruyere is a matured 1-year-old Swiss cheese, secluded in the caves of kaltbach in Switzerland. The tartiflette infused with the Riesling, a german aromatic grape, made all the falvours come to life. 

Certainly, none of this indulgence would have been better paired than with traditional Portuguese Vinho Verde, otherwise known as green wine. Vinho Verde is a type of grape found only in the region of Minho in the Northern part of Portugal. The name \"green\" comes from its youthfulness more so than its colour. In whites, its borderline like a sparkling wine with a fruity and acidic taste; while in reds the grapes used are deep red and tannic. Being that most dishes at Atlantic skip on the meat and charcuterie, this wine seems like an obvious choice for your tapas-style meal and I would highly recommend pairing your meal with it. 

Note to reader: Atlantic's risotto or orzotto style dishes tend to be extremely salty following the Chef's preference. Therefore I would not recommend these if its your first time visiting. 

Until next time Foodies.

Buen Provecho,
Viviana."}
{"text":"3.5

I went to the Atlantic for a birthday dinner. There were 7 of us, the wine was flowing and the atmosphere was cozy. I was excited to try a few dishes off of the menu- they all sounded interesting and creative. 

This was two weeks ago... I should have wrote a review when the menu was more fresh in my memory. The stand out star that night for me was the mushroom ravioli with espresso and milk! Not seafood, I know. But these gems were oh so flavourful. 

We also ordered the likes of anchovies on crostini (yummy!) some veggies- golden beets and  rapini (also yummy!)- mussels (good), black cod (good) and some  sort of ricotta dumplings (forgettable). 

It is important to note that this meal took 4.5 hours.The food was very slow to come out of the kitchen, but we had complimentary spicy olives and bread to tide us over.  I really enjoy dining this way, but it is not for everyone. Some `big eaters`might still feel hungry. 

We topped it all off with some tobacco creme brulle (very good, although the tobacco flavour was negligible... probably for the best ) and something chocolate... I can`t quite remember after 4.5 hours of wine drinking. 

The service was fantastic. 

Apparently the restaurant was fully booked for the night, and there were many instances of them turning people away at the door. I arrived at 7 pm and witnessed very little `turnover``of tables around us,as the meals were so long and leisurely.  In other words- make a reservation! 

One small thing: in the bathrooms they had fresh hand towels to dry your hands with (nice) , yet no where to put said towels when they were used...thus everyone, myself included, stashed them on the tiny, high up window ledge. I`m sorry Atlantic!"}
{"text":"It was graduation from the U of T for our niece and her boyfriend, so we left the restaurant choice up to her...so off a group of us went (final tally was 14) to celebrate her MBA.

Several in the group had been here before and obviously loved the place...so we went with an open mind.

At our waiters recommendation, our rather large table went for the \"sampler meal\", which meant 14 of us would each be charged $35, not including alcohol. 

What was surprising was at how small the portions sizes are (yes, I know this is a tapas style place, so portion sizes are supposed to be small) but when items are put down for 6 people to share and there's only 4 or 5 of said items on the plate, we had to cut several items so that we could all sample the fare.

After 6 or 7 various items came out the waiter asked if we were full and should he stop bringing out food. My brother in law (niece's father and a meat and potato kind of guy) said to keep the food coming, as there were several items he wouldn't even try. We only received one additional plate of food and then out came dessert (2 trays with 6 items each....for 14 people?).

Food quality was very good, however there wasn't enough of it make it an enjoyable meal. We stopped on the way home and had a nosh elsewhere.

Like I said earlier, people in the group rave about this place....I guess it's just not my cup of tea. I also didn't dig the décor....however it was much better than how it looks from the outside.

Waiter was excellent and made sure to keep the drinks a flowing..."}
{"text":"I don't know what restaurant other reviewers have been to, but it surely wasn't this address/property.
There is no menu.
There is no price list.
There are no pretensions.
The _only_ thing that has a \"menu\" is the alcohol list, and it has a set price of 7.00 per glass of wine. I chose the Cave Creek Riesling, as it's a wine I know and appreciate.

The owner is the chef; he comes to the table and asks about your meal preferences, allergies, etc. 
He chooses what you'll eat. 

The five courses were outstanding. The third course was smoked and grilled cricket, and I enjoyed them very much (second time I've had cricket). 

The dessert was a true delight of bourbon-cocoa with sliced peaches.

I'm not a vegetarian nor vegan, but they do cater quite well to that crowd. The meal was delightful, service very personable and informative, and the atmosphere perfect for the kind of foods they serve."}
{"text":"The hipster hype was too much to pass up on, so we set sail out to The Atlantic on Dundas.

A complete and utter disappointment.  

They pride themselves on \"local cuisine\".   They make a massive point to sell you on the idea that all of the things you are eating come from within a set radius of the restaurant.   They're right.  Every dish was essentially some variant of St. Lawrence River Beluga Whale hearts served in a pool of Ontario's finest salt. 

I've never had saltier food.   The Norwegians would be proud.  Sure, the Atlantic Ocean is full of salt water, but is that really the rationale for dunking all of the dishes in this thick salty goop?   Even the \"hazelnut greens\" should have been subtitled \"We're sorry, but tonight the role of hazelnuts is being played by Sodium Chloride.\"     We wanted to take our resting blood pressure before and after dinner to see how it was affected.  

The service was spectacular.  Our wonderful waitress kept our water glasses full throughout the voyage to the saltiest part of the sea.   This counteracted the food quite nicely and felt very heartfelt.   If only pirates would swoop her off the deck and plunk her down on a more seafaring vessel.  

Portions were extremely small, which unfortunately in this case was actually a good thing.  That being said, they were fantastically overpriced.     Our simple dinner ended up costing about the same as 100 cans of tuna.

We gazed off into the oversized photos of beached whales and dreamt of finer harbours.

Swerve portside to avoid this nautical disaster."}
{"text":"Food was fine but I would say the experience was mediocre all around given the price (about $50 a person). Felt the experience was worth maybe 30$.  Service was unevenly paced and left us feeling strange. They ran out of certain items and offered no alternatives. The look and feel of the place is also vaguely offensive. If you do have to come here at least you can go get a drink at the hen house afterward."}
{"text":"I can't say enough good about this place. It's perfect in every way - the ambience is cozy, the serving staff fun, the music is always great, and well... the show-stopper is the FOOD.

My partner likes that the chef has a deft touch with seafood - always cooking it perfectly, but I like that he throws in the occasional hint of an exotic flavour and that he blends his tastes PERFECTLY. 

This is one of the only places I've ever eaten where you HAVE to eat all the items on the plate together because that's how they match the best. 

You know, some places have things here and there and they kind of complement each other, but really you can eat like a toddler (every bit separately). 

Not here. If you don't make sure to get a little bit of each component onto your palate at the same time, you'll miss the full flavour experience.

And he matches textures perfectly too. An example is his chocolate bergamot risotto (note the trademark hint of something exotic and unexpected... the bergamot) - which had a sort of mousse foam around it. It wasn't too sweet, or too buttery - everything matched just right.

Anyway, we go there nearly once a week just to relax. Thanks for being there, Atlantic!!"}
{"text":"I love the Atlantic. A lot. A lot a lot. Even though I've only been here twice, I leave floating on cloud nine because hot damn this is it.

In order to really appreciate the charms of The Atlantic, I feel like having a healthy sense of patience, adventure and open mindedness will put you in the proper mind space to have a good time.

I was introduced to the Atlantic by a good friend of mine about a year ago, he lives in the area and wanted to share the experience. We settled up to the bar since it was packed on this specific evening and we didn't  call ahead with reservations. We started with their throwback vintage cocktails, I don't quite remember the names of what I was drinking...something with Zombie in the name? But it was good. Then I had something different with bourbon and orange bitters and that was super good too. Nice and strong, just the way I like it. He had something with kombucha in it. Kombucha beer? Who knows, it was superb anyway. God damn Good cocktails. And then we started feeling peckish. My friend is a 'burner' (he's been to Burning Man), so the guy will try anything once, twice if he likes it, and three times if it amazing. And I like eating weird things, so we held each other's hand and forayed together into the ~mystery tasting menu~ (not exactly much of a mystery,  the plates were explained to us as we received them, but there was an air of spontaneity & teasing in not exactly knowing what you'd get right until the last moment).

And Holy cannoli that food was good. 

Some of the best food I have tasted in my life. The stand outs were a nettle soup (which I had reservations about because I'm used to having that in tea, or buying it at the farmers market and then being confused about how to cook it cause it's prickley!) But it was a beautiful blended little soup. Yum. Then some AMAZING DUCK. And then some other amazing funky dishes that I can't quite remember because it was almost like a food dream. I had gone to heaven. I was dead. Dead in a good way.

So, very recently, I had the urge to return to the Atlantic, and I decided to drag my boyfriend, who is NOT a venturesome eater. He's picky, and he loves chicken; chicken schnitzel, chicken cordon bleu, chicken Caesar salad, butter chicken. He also doesn't eat vegetables, but he was a good sport and decided to buckle down and go for the tasting menu experience. Nathan (head chef, bartender, server, jack of all trades) came up to our table and explained the concept of his operation, we could go for the pwyc tasting menu, or basically let him know what we felt like eating, and he would whip something up. I also playfully explained to Nathan about my bf's hate for veggies and Nathan said, with a totally dead pan look \"Well...my food is vegetable based.\" And then we all had a good laugh. He also explained that he could whip us up a nice bowl of pasta, or a curry, but my bf was like, YA KNOW WHAT, FUCK IT, LETS DO THIS TASTING MENU I'M READY. The thing about Nathan is he can be accommodating as all heck, or you can put your faith in his talent and let him call the shots with his tasting menu. And you won't regret either choice.

We had a creamy soup with lentils, a lovely salad with cabbage and cauliflower. And then I started talking about HOW OBSESSED I AM WITH oysters with my bf, and Nathan just glided on by and said \"...you guys want some oysters? I have some nice ones...\" Um heck yea we do. LIKE WHO EVEN DOES THAT. That's one of the perks of having an observant chef mill about his restaurant and interact with patrons. All the gold stars Mr. Isberg. Then on to the delectable rainbow trout on a bed of black rice risotto, fan-fucking-tastic gnudi, the famous crickets (loved it), and finally, the tobacco crème brule (which I had a hard time with since that spicy kick from the tobacco was too much for my little throat - the bf loved it though, SURPRISE HE'S A SMOKER.)

All in all, a wonderful night, the service slowed down towards the end as the place started to fill up, but we had basically finished our meal by then and were also too busy having a fantastic conversation about our plan for the apocalypse - Possibly involves a boat, Cuba, and farming.

Nathan also gives me Aphex twin vibes with his look, and I love Apehx Twin, so it was like Aphex Twin was serving me amazing food. Good times."}
{"text":"This was the second time I have eaten at The Atlantic - was there a while ago when they had the regular menu. I had a so-so experience as I was not satisfied with the cost of meal and portion size - however the food quality was superb.

The major change since then is the PWYC concept as well as no fixed menu.

Nathan, head chef/owner/server was super focused on giving us a great dinner and we had nothing less than that. The style of dining has changed but the above average food quality has not wavered at all.

He started us off with a green soup that was flavourful, yet light. 

Shortly after, he brought us a green salad with asparagus, feta, honey, and some greens - yes, a simple idea for a second course but it was incredibly flavourful, thoughtful, and delicious.

The main was trout on wild rice, perfectly cooked, with a poached egg, pickled chanterelles and fiddleheads. It was divine, filling, delicate.

Before bringing dessert, Nathan gave us the option of 'something else' to eat - in case we still had an appetite. Though tempted to have more of his creations, we opted for a rich dessert: creme brûlée with tobacco (mentioned in a previous post).

As per the PWYC concept, my boyfriend and I left $100 total for the two of us- which included 3 beers and tip.

It was a really nice change from the original dining experience that the Atlantic offered some months ago - I would highly recommend if you are adventurous, patient, and have an appreciation of fine foods."}
{"text":"BOTTOM LINE: A solid seafood oriented restaurant with some creative dishes (the wild salmon tartare is a MUST order!), but I couldn't help but feel a bit underwhelmed both in portion and flavour with some of their other servings.  I'll come back in a few months to see how it is, but I'm not in any particular rush.

Cost:
-Appetizers $4-9, and mains $8-14.

Atmosphere/Decor:
-As another reviewer put it, it's like a dimly lit fisherman's shack canvassed with massive harbour photos and accompanied with a variety of seating arrangements from small tables for two, to a booth for four, to a bench for six.
-The aesthetics works well, but is cheapened by the bland tiled floor and really garish walk-in mat/rug.
-Your favourite indie rock bands playing in the background at, perhaps, just a touch too loudly.

Ordered:
-The menu rotates frequently according to what's in season, so it's worth coming back from time to time to see what's new.

1. Wild salmon tartare with nori, pollen and tobiko - Easily the highlight of the night, and not hard to understand why they keep this on the menu and rotate everything else!  Fresh salmon with a hint of licorice flavour that you wrapped in seaweed sheets yourself.  The provided pollen was akin to a *very* strong horseradish / wasabi.

2. Wax bean and grilled calamari salad - Pretty underwhelming with very few greens and even less calamari (which tasted fresh, but much too salty).

3. Trout with baby heirloom carrots and chard veloute - Granted I don't have trout all the time, but it just tasted rather bland, and the texture was a bit soft.  Also, the sauce didn't seem to add or enhance the flavour of the trout.

4. Scallops and duck chorizo with huitlacoche, red wine, and nibs - I love scallops, so no surprise  I found this dish delicious!  The scallops were fresh and meaty, and the duck chorizo paired well.  My issue, again, came down to quantity: four scallops and a spoonful of chorizo for $13?!  I'm certainly happy to pay for quality, but there seemed to a be a disconnect here.

Service:
-I found our staff very friendly and approachable.  
-Perhaps by design, OR the fact that since we were sharing each dish they accommodated by bringing only one out at a time, OR we were hungrier than expected, but the wait seemed quite lengthy between dishes."}
{"text":"Before we set sail on this review, can I rap about the WC a bit? What is going on? There is some bad art in there, an unclothed baby-doll toy hanging upside-down from the ceiling above the toilet, and one of those godawful sinks with separate faucets for hot and cold water. How do people wash their hands in these things? I seriously want to know. Do you pool a little cold water in one hand and splash it on the other while it's under the hot water spigot? Could someone please send me Ikea-esque pictographic instructions?

Moving on. The Atlantic is a shared-plates diner with a focus on Portuguese fusion and seafood. It's on Dundas West by Lansdowne, and looks a lot better inside than the motley sign outside would suggest. Maybe that's the point. It's a bonny spot that's dimly lit, has tables in every available corner, and is slathered with nautical art. (Insert foghorn noise here.)

I always appreciate when a server asks whether you have been to the restaurant before. We hadn't, and she helped explain what they were about, how much is a reasonable amount for two people to order, and other menu queries. Top marks for service.

Here's what we ordered with my pithy notes:

Bean dip
A generous helping of dip, served with four pieces of toasted bread. This was good and garlicky.

Bass tartare 
I did not like this. The tartare was served on top of some seriously salty greens (might have been Nori, actually). Do not want.

Savoury Tarte flambée
These crispy bad boys were quite enjoyable, but again kind of salty.

Duck confit salad
My fave. It was a tonne of delicious shredded duck, not too fatty, served on endives and radicchio. It disappeared in seconds.

(Another foghorn noise, maybe some seagull squawks.)

Goat cheese gnuddi in saag(!)
It turns out that gnuddi is a like the soft pillowy insides of gnocchi but without the potato-ey jacket. (I never knew this.) I definitely enjoyed the cloud-like texture of these little dumplings but they weren't that interesting. Even in saag.

Creme brulee
I have had better.

Huge brownie
This came from OMG down the street. No complaints.

Espresso
I most definitely did not enjoy my espresso. It was actually a bit gritty.

I'm very torn on what exactly to rate the Atlantic. The restaurant and service is adorable (hanging dolls aside) and the menu is highly ambitious and creative. On the other hand, I didn't dig everything I ate and the total damage came to $70 for two before tax and tip. Kind of pricy. But given that their menu changes frequently, I'd definitely come back to see what else they have in store. Or should I say 'in shore'? Yo, ho, ho!

Obligatory Title Pun: AHOY MATEY. 

Menu Readability: Single-pager pamphlet-sized in a modern font (like Bodoni but not). It's printed daily, and they use quality stock.

Need to mention: They have an array of cocktails starting at $10.

{"text":"A great place to go if you're in an adventurous mood.  Surveying the constantly-changing menu at this place, I always find several items/ingredients I've never heard of.  The chef at Atlantic really knows what he's doing, so it's an ideal place to try new things, prepared as they should be.  
The ambience of the place is a bit like a bar; sort a Communist Daughter vibe, candlelit and with vintage touches.  In fact I sometimes stop in here just for a cocktail or a glass of wine.  
Prices are very reasonable given the quality of ingredients and preparation, such that you can sample a wide variety of things without breaking the bank.  The place is on the whole more laid back than comparable places on Ossington, which is a good thing.  You're able to relax and order/sample things at a relaxed pace.  Recommended."}
