{"text":"Pretty good food, good job Naan Bros! I had the Tandoori chicken wrap and as soon as I took a bite it took me down memory lane, I kid you not. The sauce had an amazing taste. Now here's the reason why I gave two stars:  From a hygiene perspective I won't be back, for one the owner started brooming the walls (with an actual broom) we were a bit confused why and thought maybe he was getting rid of dust, so we kept eating. Until a few seconds later we noticed a mosquito land on our table, turns out all those (hundreds) of dots were mosquitos. I guess I'll keep my glasses on while I eat next time since I missed the spider web right next to our table as well. Seeing those mosquitoes swarm made me want to stop eating and we immediately left.  We went to look at the bakery next door to see if others had a mosquito problem and they didn't. I wonder what's different with naan bros."}
{"text":"Ordered from skip the dishes   Got a naan burger and samosas   The burger was actually AMAZING.   Didn't expect it at all, it was big and filling with condiments on the side. I will 100% order this again!"}
{"text":"3.5* round up for friendly service.  Pretty good shawarma place...with a twist!  Located in a new-ish Indian/South-east Asian plaza along Britannia in between Meadowvale & Streetsville.  Atmosphere:  New, high ceilings, appears to be clean.  However, they have very cheap IKEA folding chairs so I'm assuming this means it's more of a take-out place.  Chairs can easily fold-up/slip and they're not comfortable.  Food:  They have shawarmas (wrapped in naan/pitas), platters like Chicken On-The-Rocks, a few Indian dishes like Butter Chicken, their take on Burgers, Crepes (sweet/savoury), & the usual sides like salads, fries, & samosas.  So I guess it's a fusion place:  Indian Meets Middle Eastern.  What sets them apart is their naans, made fresh-to-order, with made in-house sauces (as per the guy behind counter), something called Chocolate Shawarma, & their Naan Burger, a beef patty, surrounded by moz, covered in a naan that is deep fried!  I had the Chicken Shawarma (wrapped in naan) and that was a healthy portion, quite saucy!  You also get to choose level of spice which is always appreciated.  I also tried their Naan Burger, which comes with lettuce/tomato/onions on the outside that I *think* you're supposed to stuff on the inside.  The whole thing was approx. the size of a baseball and you should eat it with a knife and fork.  There was a healthy ladle of what looked like Big Mac sauce on top of the burger which came cut in half.  Fries were previously frozen and began to get soggy.  The guy behind the counter said they'd be seasoned spicy, but there was not much taste in the seasoning.  The guy behind the counter said that items with naan tasted better if you dine in.  However, the chairs aren't comfortable and they're even a bit dangerous.    And although we told them order was dine-in, fries/cutlery was disposable which isn't enviro-friendly.  No recycling on premises."}
