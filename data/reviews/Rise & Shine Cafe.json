{"text":"This little gem has been open about 3 weeks. Only an breakfast lunch place it opens at 8:00 am and closes between 2:00 & 3:00 PM.  It is bright and very cherry.  Wait staff and manager Karen were hustling but very attentive.  Eggs Benedict was great and ingredients in omelet very fresh.  Will definitely return.  Missed the 5th star as the voice volume had an echo , so it could get pretty loud."}
{"text":"My new favorite place for breakfast!!! Their omlettes are awesome. Seriously the best I've ever had. Also, the waitress was beyond friendly. I have some eating restrictions and she was so amazing and offered me extra veggies in place of the food I couldn't eat and didn't make it an awkward situation like a lot of servers.   I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Wonderful little establishment. I ordered the \"Rise and Shine\" breakfast special. Two eggs, choice of meat, hash browns and either toast or fresh fruit. Delicious. That with a tall glass of OJ was the perfect start to the day. The hostess who also doubled as the waitress was very attentive. The coffee cups were always full. The orders were taken and they were correct the first time out. With two friends who also ordered the special, the bill was $25, tax included. Not bad at all!"}
{"text":"I went for breakfast.  Good service, coffee and food.  I will return,"}
{"text":"The bottom review on this page was surprisingly negative! I very much enjoyed my time there. The room was very bright and colorful (a lot of yellow), and the servers were friendly. They had 2 or 3 open tables almost the whole time, so there was no wait, but they were busy enough that it had a nice atmosphere. My food wasn't bad, either! (Pictures included below, plus those of family's). I would totally go back for more."}
{"text":"outstanding food at reasonable prices.  i had an omlet that was outstanding.....great staff...very clean."}
{"text":"Don't ever go alone! They sit you at about a 14 inch shelf at a huge window.  And this is a breakfast place, right?  The morning sun shines brightly directly into that window.  Do you think they have shades or blinds? They don't.  I had to wear sunglasses the entire time.  The server took my order promptly but it took almost 30 minutes for a waffle and an egg sandwich.... Right when I was tired of being cooked by the direct sunlight and sick of waiting, I started to leave a few bucks for my coffee and water and take off.  But my food came as I was getting up, so I stayed.  The food was decent but so not worth the wait or the experience.  I will not go there again.  Spend $50 bucks on some blinds or something, jeez!"}
{"text":"I have made the mistake of eating at this restaurant more than once. I don't use the term mistake due to the food. The food is actually pretty good. The problem is not only the early hours but also the employees. In a college town it is strange to have a business close at 2pm. Not only that but they will turn the open sign off at 1pm and if you arrive after 1pm be prepared for  the most cold and rude meal of your life. Several of the older female waitresses will be so upset and mad that you came in they won't greet you just show you to a booth. They will be incredibly rude when taking your order as if you have totally inconvenienced them and ruined their day. When all you have done is support their business and given them money. It seems as they would rather you not come in than get more money. The waitresses will just throw your plates of food on the table. When they bring the check they will stand and wait till you put your money or credit card down and grab it right away. The young cooks will shake their heads when they see you come through the door. All in all the food isnt worth the terrible and rude service. Save your money and go to the wild goat."}
{"text":"Loved this place! We went yesterday morning and I'm so glad we called ahead and put our names in! We were seated immediately, otherwise there looked to be about a 20 min wait. This place is open kitchen style so you can see all of your food being cooked.  I had the \"up and at 'em' and it was a huge amount of food. The breakfast potatoes were delicious and my pancakes were so tasty. My friends and I all agreed that the food was very fresh and not greasy, a huge plus!  The service was good as well. There was a small issue with my friend's waffle and they whisked it away and replaced it with something else immediately and took it off the bill and did not charge her for the replacement. Such friendly and hassle free service!  Try this place, you won't regret it! I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Excellent food! Good service too. Coffee was steaming hot, eggs over easy just right and bacon perfectly crisp! Next time we're trying lunch!"}
{"text":"So I go out of my way to find a place to park here which is no easy task and I make my way in side . I'm met with pleasant enough lady who seats me at the window bar area. She tells me someone will be right with me and that was as far as it got . The place was not that busy but I sat for 20 minutes and never got waited on . I made it through the entire Kent state paper and not as much as a water . I went so far as to look over my shoulder more the. once only to see waitresses standing around chatting it up but damn if they waited on me. After I read the paper I gave up and left without so much as glance from the staff . I go out of my way to support local but this place is off the list . I went to the bob evens down the street that I had past to go find this place. Keep this up and you will turn off the people in town that are not students and spend money . I eat and take clients out several times a week in the area and won't dare try this place given the experience ."}
{"text":"Horrible service,  food sat in the window for 20 minutes before it was delivered. How can service be so bad at a little place like this? And they shouldn't be stacking plates on top of each other in the window with food on them"}
{"text":"I've been here multiple times, but never made a review. This morning I came here for breakfast early in the morning and it wasn't too busy. I was seated right away and got our drinks quickly. My boyfriend had ordered a chocolate milk, which was sour. We told the waiter and he apologized and got a new milk. He even said that he taste tested it before serving my boyfriend the new milk.  We ordered and our food came out in a timely fashion. I ordered pancakes with chocolate chips and strawberries. To add toppings to the pancakes was a little pricey. It was about $1 something. The pancakes, though, were amazing. They were comparable to Bob Evans hotcakes.   This place is very cute. It's on the smaller side and feels very homey. I will always make this my number one breakfast spot in Kent."}
{"text":"Everything here was awesome!  Smiling faces and homemade corned beef hash and potatoes!  What else do you need?"}
{"text":"I have been to Rise and Shine twice. The first time we stood at the door for 10 minutes waiting on someone to acknowledging us. Once we were sat it was 10 minutes for the waitress to come over. The waitress was pleasant and professional but when our food was served mine was burnt. I mean black, not eatable. The waitress took it back and they got me a new meal and it was fine.   Okay so first visit not so good but I know there is a difference between a bad experience and a bad restaurant so I gave it a second try this weekend.   We were greeted quick, got a table quick and our order taken in a timely manner. So far nice! It took about 20 minutes to be served after ordering which is reasonable. Well, I wasn't served I was told (once my GF was served) that they didn't have everything I order did I want to change my order? So why wasn't I told this BEFORE she was served? The waitress said \"we are busy\". That is a quote, don't have time to let me know because the restaurant is busy.   The food here is typical of a breakfast/lunch spot, good location but there are to many other restaurants in a four block radius to eat somewhere that is too busy for me."}
{"text":"Great Breakfast! Fast, friendly service, tasty food--I enjoyed the whole experience. We ordered omelettes, scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage, toast and coffee. All was well-done and the coffee really stood out with a rich, smooth flavor. I will definitely return the next time I am in Kent."}
{"text":"Very nice place first thing on a Saturday. The sun rises and shines down the street. The place is bright and the smell of the food is fantastic.   We like to come here before we head the the farmers market.   The food great and the portions are big. If you order a full breakfast bring help.   Five stars."}
{"text":"Do you want a healthy home cooked style breakfast?! Look no further than rise and shine! This was my first time in here for breakfast and I am beyond impressed. Rise and Shine is a tucked in right next to Tree City coffee. It's on the smaller side for size but it's perfect. My entire breakfast was delicious! Everything from the home fries to the French toast was so tasty! The bacon was cooked on the crispy but not too crispy side! Love it! Their coffee even comes from Tree City next door. I would come back here again and again for breakfast. 5 stars for food and service!"}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem in Kent that people are just now finding out about. A great place for a solid breakfast that isn't greasy or full of salt. Everything is cooked to perfection and the service is really great. Their waffles are also ON POINT. Love 'em. The staff is friendly, and the food comes out quick. It's almost always packed on the weekend mornings and there is only one hostess. So if you have to wait a few minutes, just be patient. The place is also pretty small, but that gets better in the warmer months when they open their outdoor seating.   My advice: Don't go here with a big group unless you are going early. I prefer going here when I'm in a group of 3 or less people. You will get seated much faster and you won't be so crammed at the table."}
{"text":"Watch out, they have a griddle, and they know how to use it. I love a good diner style two-egg breakfast and Rise & Shine was happy to oblige. The home fries in particular were nice big chunks of potato grilled perfectly with crispy bits included. Service was friendly and fast and the food was good. I would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"A FANTASTIC  breakfast experience!! Great service and atmosphere with fresh homemade breakfast food. The staff informed me that their head cook and manager had changed a few months back so I speculate the bad reviews below might come from those transition periods!"}
{"text":"Service was slow and the staff was indifferent. It wasn't even that busy. The food was dry. Such a waste considering its good location in the downtown area. But maybe it was because the staff didn't want to work on a national holiday lol."}
{"text":"Don't do it. The wait is crazy long and the food is NOT spectacular. Me and my friend saw them carried pre-made breakfast sandwiches around in the back (no judgement, but then don't take forever making it and getting it over to me, 95% if the work is already done bro), it's clean though and if you're not up for going to Denny's 20 minutes away from campus in the morning for breakfast with friends, then this place is clean and basically does the same thing"}
{"text":"Great breakfast place. Very friendly staff and tons of delicious options. I like the cinnamon pancakes etc. always busy though"}
{"text":"Great service and quality food! Definitely suggest the monte cristo---absolutely delicious!"}
{"text":"This is a nice local breakfast place! I came in a few days ago and got an omelette. It was pretty good, but nothing special. It was slightly too oily for my liking too..My sister got the scrambler and loved their gravy. The staff was friendly"}
{"text":"My bf and I are regulars here, in almost every weekend. It's my favorite breakfast joint in town. The staff is super friendly and the food is delicious. I hesitate to write such a glowing review though, because I also love the short wait time! But really, if you're looking for breakfast or lunch, this place is awesome."}
{"text":"4 stars: Food- good. Nothing over the top. Except the fresh fruit was on point!! Service- kind and prompt.   Order: fresh fruit bowl, \"up an at 'em\""}
{"text":"Great food and casual diner-style atmosphere. Staff. Was a little rushed and not overly friendly but that did not detract from a great breakfast. A little more customer service would just be the icing on the cake."}
{"text":"So happy my roommate introduced me to this hidden gem. The service is quick, the coffee is awesome (which comes from Tree City next door), and the breakfast is amazing. It is a smaller place, so there may be a wait, but it is well worth it. I reccomend this to any and all breakfast lovers. Tip: Get the French Toast. It is delicious!"}
{"text":"Rise and Shine has SO much potential to be an awesome, go-to brunch place right in the middle of downtown. But they lack character and uniqueness.   Their food isn't horrible. But it's bland and basic. They don't have a signature style of eggs Benedict or fancy French toast. They don't have anything that they are really known for. Their breakfast food is on par with something you and your friends could make at home.  I feel they should re-vamp their menu with specialty items and make the place look more up-to-date/modern/hip."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why Rise and Shine has such negative reviews, because everything was great during my visit.  There was no wait when I went with two girlfriends.  Our server was friendly and very helpful since I do not eat bread she was more than willing to substitute other things for the bread.  I got a spinach salad and chicken blt wrap (minus the tortilla) for 6.99.  You can't beat that!  I would much rather come here than your local Bob Evans.  Delicious food and great service!"}
{"text":"Rise & Shine is a good breakfast option and I'm glad they're here since the wait can be quite long at other breakfast joints in Kent. I've always enjoyed their omelettes and hashbrowns and the coffee is decent.  The first time we went, they made sure we had  a full cup at all times!!  Service has always been friendly and offered in just the right amount and the prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"We decided to try this place with one of my friends after a final exam at school. First of all, the place seems nice and clean. I've decided to go with their \"Rise and Shine\" menu item with turkey sausage and rye toast. Omelette and the toast were fine but the turkey sausage was one of the worst I've tried. Our waitress was really nice but it didn't change the fact that sausage was horrible. Aside from the sausage, it seems like a pretty good place for breakfast, though any place would be nice after a final exam. I might go back to try the other menu items."}
{"text":"I love this place. Their portions are pretty big for a cheap price. I always get the Rise and Shine breakfast."}
{"text":"Recently ate here. By far some of the worst food I have ever had. I ordered the Monte Cristo, the French Toast was completely burnt on one side and it was undercooked on the other and you could see the runny egg whites. They remade it for me and it was still horrible, at least that time they remembered powdered sugar on top, but I'm convinced it was because the boss walked in right as they were making it. The home fries were hard and some pieces were still raw. My boyfriend had the turkey sandwich on a pretzel bun which was dry and also underwhelming and the noodles in his pasta salad were mushy and overcooked. I've decided I will not be back until I hear better reviews or they hire new cooks. The service was pretty decent, we did come close to when they close because as we ate they started ferociously cleaning and putting chairs up. Final thought; head down to Mike's Place on 43 close to 261 and save yourself the trouble."}
{"text":"I don't get the hype. We went for breakfast on a Friday morning and the service was awful. They weren't even busy and it took the server a good 15 minutes after we sat down to take our order. I ordered French toast, which was ok. My husband ordered bacon, eggs, and potatoes, which were inedible. And my son ordered the waffle with peanut butter and banana, which was really good and the reason I'm giving two stars instead of one. Also, the coffee was extremely weak (and I don't even like strong coffee). We don't plan on going back."}
{"text":"We are here based off yelp reviews. Let me start by saying I can defiantly agree with other yelpers when we arrived it's pretty small on the inside and it was packed. We were told just a few minutes for a wait. While we waited it did seem a little chaotic. The hostess was rarely at the hostess station and they didn't have a busser so the wait staff was trying to juggle their tables and bussing too. So out visit did start off rocky ended up waiting almost 15 mins after we were told 5 mins.   HOWEVER, as once we were seated things began to drastically improve. Our waitress came over we ordered drinks. I kid you not 5 minutes after she brought out drinks (we ordered at the same time we gave our drink order) our food came out. We couldn't believe how fast the food came out. Food was great!!! I love that they idea of building your own breakfast burrito. They had black beans which you can almost NEVER find at breakfast places so I was over the moon about being able to customize my burrito w black beans. Also for the kids breakfast you could do a pick 3 for any breakfast items (again loved this) bc my kids are vegetarian and it's almost impossible to find breakfast places that have kids breakfasts w /o meat as an option (at other places we always get it their breakfast w out meat but are still charged even though they don't get it). So we were able to order them  pancakes potatoes and fruit. Another plus it was fresh fruit (strawberries blueberries pineapples and grapes) loved that!!   Also, some of the friendliest service ever our burritos came w salsa and when we ordered we asked for a small side of sour cream when our server brought our food she informed us they didn't have any (which was fine) literally 5 minutes later it must have been the owner comes over with a small cup of sour cream she had gone next door to get us some. I literally couldn't believe it. In my opinion that's a+ service. Hopefully they get some of the kinks for seating/greeting guests bc this is a great little breakfast joint"}
{"text":"It's a quaint little place in downtown Kent. The food is well proportioned and prices are reasonable.  They use fresh fruits on the crepes which is nice. Foos is good stick to your stomach quality. I enjoying comping here as a morning get away with the boys or the wife. I'd defiantly recommend giving it a try"}
{"text":"I LOVE Rise and Shine! My boyfriend and I come here almost every weekend. It's a cute, locally owned, breakfast/lunch place right in downtown Kent. Great prices and great food. They just recently opened during nighttime hours on the weekends to attract the \"drunken munchies\" people at the bars - what a great idea! Easy to walk to from the bars and way better than Denny's or IHOP. Great place!"}
{"text":"Fabulous food in a cute location! Hashbrowns are spectacular and the coffee comes from the local coffee shop next door, Tree City. Service is hit or miss though. I come here about once a month and it's 50/50 split on whether they are attentive or rude."}
{"text":"This is a wonderful, well priced breakfast spot in downtown Kent. We came in on a Sunday morning around 10 - it was busy but not so much that we had to wait. We lucked out - when we left there was a small wait.  Food is fairly typical breakfast fare - I got the Up And At'Em which has eggs, meat, potatoes, and French toast. The eggs were yummy, bacon crispy, and the french toast well coated. The potatoes were my favorite, very well seasoned and cooked well. I love breakfast potatoes, and these were top notch.  Service was great and the place is clean. Definitely a great breakfast spot up in Ohio."}
{"text":"Egg bacon cheese in eng muffin. Very good. Hot off grill. Very good strong coffee. Bright dining room. New interior. Attentive staff. Def returning with kids."}
{"text":"the Belgium Waffle was very spongy doughy and bland, not crispy only got 1 syrup,  wasn't good at all,   i won't go back again"}
{"text":"We went for brunch on a Sunday, so there was a wait. We were sat after 15-20 minutes, so not too bad of a wait. After being sat, we all ordered our food. We had to wait an hour for our food to come out. Two of our orders were messed up: my eggs came out fried and not scrambled, and my friend's omelette was missing onions. After getting our food, the manager came and apologized saying that they ran out of pancake batter and that's why it took so long (two of us ordered pancakes). The food was alright, pretty typical breakfast food. I would be happy with the quality and price of the food if it came out sooner...  Staff was attentive and friendly, I never ran out of coffee. The manager gave me a 10% discount on my bill for the long wait."}
{"text":"I was here on a Sunday morning, service was great, food was even better. I had their special from the board, which were crepes, and wow!!! The prices are very reasonable also."}
{"text":"Great day to spend with long time friends, and an impending baby shower!   Me and the gang were welcomed with smiling faces and a full house. Boy it was packed! But none the less we had a great seat in the front ready to greet us. Our waitress was nice and very busy poor girl. But she got our drinks and orders in a timely fashion.   I got the Make Your Own Belgium Waffles--with Glazed Strawberries, Blueberries, and Walnuts.  Hot was my Waffle and cold were my fruit toppings. You'd be hard pressed to find a place that could do both in a timely fashion. Keep it up Rise and Shine!!"}
{"text":"I came for Sunday brunch. We had to wait about 20 Minutes (we came at 11:30). Our booth was kinda small. Unfortunately, we waited ~45 minutes for our food to come. The manager came up and said they had ran out of pancake batter. My meal was an omelet with a side of potatoes and toast. The eggs tasted a bit rubbery, but the omelet ingredients were good (ham, spinach, green peppers). However, they didn't put onions in it when I asked for onions!!! Also, the potatoes were pretty bland. Had to add salt and ketchup. The toast was fine. My friend's order was wrong, too. The service was good and the prices were good. Overall, this restaurant did not meet my expectations."}
{"text":"To clarify,  Food 4 stars Lag-time 1 star. Queue to be seated, small dining area, miniscule kitchen. No one was inclined tp leave, so after 10 minites or so we were seated at the emercency table directly outside the bathrooms. They have a designated drink person, so they arrived in a timely fashion, but the kitchen just  ain't equiped for the size of the seating area, or it's not well staffed back there or both. The wait HAD to have been knocking on the door of an hour.... Long enough that I entertained requesting my breakfast order be changed to a luncheon order, fully confident that preparation of my original order had not yet begun. My wife got Eggs Benedict which she stated were the best she had ever been served.  Each component earned praise independent of  the other, and the whole got even more! I got their \" rise and shine breakfast\", into which I have inserted two \"wait\"s and an \"and\" immediately following \"rise\" for the sake of accuracy. It consisted of one's choice of pancakes or French toast, choice of breakfast protein, eggs and hash browns. All were nicely done, but none of exceptional note, except that they were ALL nicely done, no weak links taking up space on the plate. All waitstaff were efficient and Personable. Despte the fact that there were several heretofore unseen empty tables when we went up to pay our bill, there was a queue there as well. They seem to do quite a carry-out business, much of it breakfast fare, which is a new experience to the writer, but this is a college-town, so somewhere out there are some happy dormies munching on take-out breakfast! Street and public lot parking as we are right downtown, bring extra change for the meter if you happen here on a weekend!"}
{"text":"This place is a wonderful place to get breakfast or brunch. The service is super fast and friendly, the food is delicious and plentiful. There is a big focus on local food while still maintaining a good diner feel."}
{"text":"Fantastic breakfast....Had the Breakfast Scrambler...wife had Acorn Alley Omelet.....1st time there.  Guaranteed to be back."}
{"text":"My sister and I thoroughly enjoyed lunch--we both agreed they were the most delicious, fresh, healthy salads we had ever eaten!  The Rise & Shine Cafe lives up to its name as a breakfast and lunch diner, but no greasy spoon here!  The atmosphere is cheery and very clean, the service was perfect!  Definitely plan on returning often to support this special Mom and Pop establishment!  Oh, and by the way, the banana muffins are to die for!!!"}
{"text":"Don't order the corned beef hash unless you like a few slices of fatty corned beef buried under a mound of salty potatoes with chunks of underdone green peppers and celery.  Plus the toast was burned.  I won't go back."}
{"text":"My experience was wonderful! We stopped in for brunch and it was Awesome!  The hostess was friendly and attentive. The food came out quickly, it was fresh and cooked perfectly. I don't have a single complaint with this place and would recommend them to anyone."}
{"text":"Finally had a Saturday off to catch up with a girlfriend and found this diner in my entertainment book for a bogo  they are open til 2p. A lot of breakfast choices. I ordered caged eggs omelette. You can choose a meat and 3 fillings and choose a cheese. Smoke applewood bacon and spinach and onions and mozzarella cheese.  Potatoes and choice of thick sliced toast.   Friend ordered open omelette in skillet with grilled veggies and smothered with sausage and gravy. Included potatoes and  choice of thick sliced toast. We had so much food that will be enough breakfast tomorrow.  Really attentive service didnt have to ask for more iced tea."}
{"text":"As a frequent customer of Tree City Coffee over in Kent, I always passed by this café and today I decided to give it a try. I'm a HUGE fan of breakfast, to put it simply - it's my favorite meal of the day. So I was hoping this place would turn out to be a gem, but I have mixed feelings.  The staff was very friendly, great service, and the food was pretty tasty. My only real qualm with this place was the overwhelming smell of the kitchen grease... and when you're a little hung over (as I was), it became very obnoxious. They designed this restaurant to have an open kitchen so that it gives the place a modern diner feel, and because of that, you're exposed to a strong greasy odor.   Honestly, I would love to go back there sometime when they fix their ventilation issues. I'll even update this review to give them an extra star if they do. Don't let my review deter you from visiting though, they do have outdoor seating! I didn't sit outside because it was too cold today, but it would be a nice place to grab a meal on a sunny day."}
{"text":"We went for breakfast and the food was amazing! Made to order and really fresh food! Try the egg scrambler & waffles!!"}
