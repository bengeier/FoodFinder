{"text":"This is one of the best yogurt shops I have ever been to! The staff is friendly and it is a great atmosphere for kids!!!"}
{"text":"My family loves this place. Whats not to love about puting what u want and how much you want on yourself! Always clean. Always friendly!"}
{"text":"Something is not quite right here $32 for 2 adults and 2 kids to get some yogurt with modest toppings seems a wee bit pricy! The yogurt is average tasting and the service at the counter is pretty blah! Will not be back as I think their scales are off!"}
{"text":"Ist time ordered fish as ad said it was $4.99, the owner said it was $5.99. It took the young boy forever to get condiments.  2rd time - owner was not there. Everything went fairly well.  3rd time - BIG SIGN IN WINDOW - CONES 99CENTS   Nope, we took the smallest cone available and were told if you wanted a 99 cent cone you had to ask for a smaller cone at the counter and they were all out of them!  3 STRiKES and your out at YOGURT KINGDOM  Place is run like an old timey business by an old timey guy."}
{"text":"My 8 year old brother loves this place! He would ask me to take him every Friday after school. Very family friendly atmosphere. Overhead music is not too loud. The tables are always clean. Perfect place to cool off during the summertime!"}
{"text":"Stopped in and treated the dog to his own frozen yogurt. He loved every lick of it. Great outside seating."}
{"text":"Oddly enough, I come here for the Fish & Chips! It's been great everytime I've been there. I stopped here on a suggestion from my cousin and I'm glad I did! Everyone is really friendly. Joey is awesome and is always looking to see what he can do for his patrons. Recommend anyone to go and give it try!"}
{"text":"No complaints on the frozen yogurt but the food? I was here last month w/my sister & nephew, ordered a burger & it tasted microwaved. My sis had a steak & cheese sandwich, said it was good. So I bring my husband for his first ever frozen yogurt experience. Only 1 young man working, he was very friendly & helpful. My hubby & I both ordered steak sandwiches. More customers were showing up so it took awhile for the employee to bring our food & when he did, he brought us burgers. I explained we ordered steak & cheese sandwiches & he said this was all they had. I said there were steak & cheese sandwiches last month so he went to the back to double check (after cashing out 6 customers that had been waiting). After awhile he came back & said No these are the only steak burgers we have. At that point we gave up.  Again the burgers didn't even taste good. I WILL go back, for yogurt only though!"}
{"text":"A group of us went and had a less than pleasant experience.    We went there to relax and unwind after doing some projects.    The Democratic National Convention was on the TV so LOUD!  that we could not even talk.  We tried to sit out side, but it was too hot.  So were were forced to be blasted with \"what a loving couple the Clintons are,\" the whole time we were there.  And it was LOUD.  We did not go their for political indoctrination.  We went for a sweet treat to relax.    Equally as disturbing, while we were there eating the person behind the counter came out with a trash bag and picked items out of garbage one item at a time.  It was discussing.  Rather than empty the trash and put a new bag in it, they took every messy item (blows, used napkins, spoons,) out one by one.   Maybe to save a garbage bag.  But when you are sitting there eating, you don't want to see the person behind the counter at a food place going through the garbage can then going back to behind the counter.     This coupled with 2 night ago when a some of us were there, and a few kids who seemed  to be associates with the shop but not working there kept going behind the counter, sitting on the condiment bar, and bouncing a ball on the floor..  It just does not seem cleanly to be be touching a ball that has been rolling around the floor and then going behind the counter where food is.  Unfortunate no one in our group will be going to this location. I guess we need to find a new Yogurt place."}
{"text":"$30 for yogurt! Outrageous.  Self serve yogurt at a price of a mere .53 cents an ounce. It costs more than $30 for my wife and I and four little ones and we were frugal.   The store  and staff is nice enough, though they did not have plain tart flavor. A yogurt shops cardinal sin.   This was nearly as much as going out to dinner. When these shops started they were a cost effective treat. Now they take advantage of the fact that the per ounce price sounds cheap to charge you more than we ever paid for ice cream."}
{"text":"This place is close to my house so I go fairly frequently. The staff is nice, I just think some of their topping choices are odd and sometimes they don't have the \"normal\" topping selections you'd expect most yogurt places to have, i.e. Cookie dough or the little cheesecake bits. But they have random cereal and protein powder!"}
{"text":"I'm hesitant to even give this place 2 stars but eh. I live so close to Yogurt Kingdom but never thought of giving them a try until yesterday since I've been on a yogurt kick lately. Of all the ones I tried recently (Yoppi in Tempe, Blue Ocean in Chandler Mall, Yogurtology in Scottsdale Mall, Yougrtland in Scottsdale and then revisited iTwist @ Mekong Plaza) this has got to be the worst.   The owner (or so I think) seems not to happy to give out samples but I dont want to go get a cup full of yogurt that ends up tasting not so great. (I ended up doing just that...) So after trying the original (of course since I always go for that flavour) and my sister trying cake batter, thats what we end up getting. I also asked the owner how was the reese's peanut butter was and he replied people seem to like it better then regular peanut butter but it cost more for them to have the flavour, it should of kicked in to not get it since he didn't say it taste good, but I ended up getting it also and boy was it a mistake. It did NOT taste anything like peanut butter let alone reese's. I should of stick to what I usually get at frozen yogurt shops and stay with the tarts.  The yogurts was nothing to brag about. They were a little bit on the watery side? So don't expect creamy deliciousness from here.  The topping bar was massive but messy. Makes it look unappetizing. They should have tongs for the mochi since they put it on top and when I went to scoop, it felt like the glass jar was going to fall over.   I would probably return out of desperation since I live in East Mesa and this is the only one I know thats close to me but I am probably not that desperate. I'll give it one more try sometime before crossing them off my list forever."}
{"text":"After visiting this place shortly after its opening, I decided despite my major disappointment to cut them a break, and not post a yelp review. However, after visiting two other self-serve yogurt shops in the valley, I am completely convinced that I will not return. -The experience- not sure what kind of business opens its doors to the public but makes it impossible for them to park directly in front of the store by blocking off the first 4 parking spots available with tacky lawn furniture, a bed sheet, and hand made signs that said no parking, but this was what I was greeted with. (and yet I still went inside...somebody slap me now...the writing was literally on a rope).  I am assuming the owners were the adult couple fidgeting with the lawn furniture and flitting around the store.  They weren't friendly, they never once cracked a smile, never made eye contact with their customers (there were at least three groups of people having yogurt, and based on overhearing the register totals, they had cleared over $100 in yogurt sales in just under 15 minutes...that would make ME smile! but I guess I'm not over invested in a giant yogurt shop) The store was fairly well littered with multi-level marketing type product, business cards, etc, all with the same name on it...the owners?  Not sure, but my experience there felt like I had walked into a den of desperation. -The Yogurt- eh.  I didn't care for it.  But lets face it, taste is subjective.  Not sure what Yogurt Kingdom claims, but based on the overly sweet, muddled flavors, I am guessing that the yogurt flavors are not 100% natural.   -The Price- well, .39 cents an ounce seems to be the going rate for self-serve yogurt, so they are priced within the range of their competition.  That said, I find it extraordinarily interesting that I have been able to twice now visit other .39 p/oz establishments with a party of 4 with the same serve yourself rules set out by me-mom before serving ourselves and spent less than $1.00 more than the amount I paid for just 2 servings at Yogurt Kingdom.  Somethings not right.  I would like to assume that an error was made on the part of the cashier and that there is not dishonesty involved.- -The sum total of it all- there's tastier yogurt in town with friendlier people and no MLM junk who actually want you to park in front of their store and make them look busy."}
{"text":"We came here just by chance looking for a place to have dessert after dinner. We met the owner Lee who was so nice. The service he provided was so wonderful that it was a great way to end the night! The yogurt was delicious and they had quite a bit to choose from. They also have a good variety of toppings as well. The mural on the wall was made by the owners son and its beautiful!! We will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"We love Yogurt Kingdom. The place has the cutest ambiance and wonderland mural on the wall.  The owners are super sweet with incredible staff. And did I mention the yogurt is phenomenal?  We love, love the Pineapple Whiz because it is the same stuff they have next to the Tiki Room at Disneyland!"}
{"text":"The menu says 21 flavors, I only see 14 to choose from listed along the wall and 2 are  missing. I got the Pistachio which to me doesn't taste like pistachio and looks more gray than 'green as one would expect. The yogurt machine next to the Pistachio was leaking red juice into it, so its gray with red swirls. There were an abundance of cool toppings but  packed a bit too close, made it hard to serve yourself. My daughter loved her choice of a  chocolate cone with cherries on the side, so did her face & nose! A bit pricey, the decor was cute but dizzy and their tv way too loud,  but 1 out of 2 of us were happy!"}
{"text":"Decent tasting froyo in a variety of flavors. My only issue is the severe lack of fruit topping available.  Too much candy and chocolate crap."}
{"text":"This is more than a yogurt bar. They've got burgers and apparently waffles. The air was heavy with oil when I walked in. I like to try several favors when I visit a yogurt bar. My first attempt was the mango sorbet. When I pulled the trigger a bunch of thick liquid globbed out. We asked about the sugar free \"dairy free\" vanilla and the cashier proceeded to tell us it's not really dairy free.  The flavors of my selection were disappointing. This was the worst yogurt bar experience I've had."}
{"text":"Stopped in after craving some frozen yogurt. Was pleasantly surprised that it wasn't overly busy and the two employees working were very friendly. I was immediately greeted when I came in and was asked by both employees if I wanted to sample any of the flavors. The price was decent and the store was clean. I would have liked to have seen more than the one sorbet, since I wanted a gluten dairy fat free option, but overall I appreciated it was close by and the yogurt (sorbet) was very good."}
{"text":"Went to Yogurt Kingdom for the first time tonight.  It was perfect.  Lots of flavors to choose from.  My favorite is the Tart Vanilla.  But I got a large cup and tasted at least 8 different flavors and I enjoyed each and everyone.  I wanted to go back and get some more of the Tart Vanilla but my husband gave me one of those looks when I suggested it.  You can either eat inside or outside.  The place is decorated so cute.   There was a very cute and well mannered girl to greet us and told us how it all worked just in case we had not been there before.   They offered to give us any samples that we might like to try.  There was a gentleman there who turned out to be the owner.  He was very kind, friendly person  and glad that we stopped in.   The bathroom was very clean and the entire place was tidy and well maintained.   We will be back very soon.  I would recommend this place to others that like yogurt.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"What a yogurt gem! I can't believe I just found out about this yogurt joint...just when we're moving out of the area! Ugh! Anyways, my kids wanted frozen yogurt and as we drove to the closest yogurt place (the one we always go to) we discovered that it was no longer open! I searched Yelp and it pointed out to this place as the closest to us. Our kids absolutely loved the ambience and decor! Lots of color and lights! And best of all....wonderful yogurt flavors! The Dulce de Leche was amazing and so was the peanut butter! My kids went crazy combining all kinds of flavors. The prices are not displayed but they are pretty competitive to most yogurt places. Employees are nice and charming. The only thing I did not like about this place is that when it comes to sampling they hold on to the sampling little cups as precious gold! Most places you get the little cup and self sample. Here they serve it for you so if the place gets busy (and it does!) then, you better begin serving without sampling because there will not be a sampling guard to help ya out with your sampling needs! :)"}
{"text":"No prices shown. It tastes good. A few flavors were out of order for cleaning. Would like to see sugar free chocolate available one day."}
{"text":"We decided to try this place after receiving a 20% off coupon in the mail. I noticed on the coupon they also had corn dogs for .99. We stopped in after a hike, to get a corn dog and some frozen yogurt. This is self serve. You start by picking your size bowl, waffle bowl, cake cone, waffle cone or sugar cone. Then you decide what flavor yogurt you want, that's the hard part. Today I chose strawberry banana. You then go to the toppings bar, holy potatoes is it loaded with many yummy toppings to chose from ranging from sauces to fruit, candy, ho-ho's, nuts, nutty bars, you name it! Then you weigh your creation. It is .45 cents an ounce( the price will vary depending on how full you fill your bowl). Worth every penny in my opinion. I also ordered a corn dog and a drink. The corn dog was very good. Hot and the coating was good and crispy! Their diet coke in the soda machine was out, so we got a bottle out of the fridge. The decor is bright and cheery, and the service was great! I can't wait to go back to try more flavors and creations!"}
{"text":"I love this place. They have dairy free and sugar free creamy, yummy  Yogurts made with almond milk and rice milk. I can eat there and Top it with fruit and nuts and feel great afterwards. Love eating At this place. Wish more yogurt places had good dairy free and sugar Free sweetened with Stevia products like Yogurt KIngdom has."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Spectacular service! The older woman that served us was such a sweetheart. So kind I felt like I was talking to the grandma that I never had. She was very interested in talking to my son and I and was beyond friendly. We got 2 99cent cones, steal of a deal! She gave us coupons to come see her again and let my son spin the prize wheel. I ran a yogurt shop for 6 years and I was beyond impressed. Very neat place for the kiddos too with a fun mural on the wall and kids tables as well as adults. We have been back since and the boy was friendly too. They have extremely inexpensive food options as well. It is one of our new hangouts! :)"}
{"text":"Yogurt Kingdom is located right next to the Barro's on Signal Butte, making this a good stop for both yummy pizza and frozen yogurt. We have been here quite a few times since it opened.  It is entirely self-serve and how much you pay is based on how much your yogurt plus toppings weighs at the register. They have several flavors of frozen yogurt, some of them fat/sugar free, and lots of toppings, including fresh soft mochi candy.  The mural is really fun to look at, and the owner is definitely a character. Love it here :)"}
{"text":"This place has watery frozen yogurt. Not a fan. I had the cake batter and I really shouldve went to cold stone."}
{"text":"We really like this place.  Lots of variety and lots of toppings!  They never seen to have pecans though...so that is a little annoying. Bathe owner is friendly...almost a little on the obnoxious side.  If you're in the area and looking for a sweet treat...it a great place to go!"}
{"text":"Cost is unbelievably expensive!  Could have bought a gallon of great ice cream for that. Young kids gave people free yougurt and brownies and they didn't even have to pay. That was rude!!! Wont be back cause the help never said thank you or any kind words. Just here's your change. I will go to Yogurtland where at least they thank you for taking your money! I and my boys were not impressed."}
{"text":"Got a restaurant.com gift card (spend $20, save $10) to use here. Unfortunately, it did not work. Not sure who's at fault. The owner was nice, but would not budge on the price so we paid. It will run you about $20-$25 for 4 decent size (probably about 10-12 ounces per person).  Ice cream is bland; low-fat ice milk, not a lot of flavor. However, you can load it up with just about any topping; including fruits, sauces, and sweets of all kinds. Restaurant is clean and well maintained with lots of seating and a great mural on the wall."}
{"text":"Yes, it's a fun place to get some fun times,  haven't been their for some time,  about 3 yesrs or so,  lol, still I went to it when it opened and glad to see is still around."}
{"text":"No go for me... the atmosphere was weird and not welcoming and the yogurt left a weird taste in my mouth. Go down the street to Golden Spoon or over to PS Yogurt on Ellsworth."}
{"text":"This place is just more than yogurt. It's a local institution, and at the heart of it is the nicest, most passionate yogurt man who owns it. It's a bit on the expensive side compared to other yogurt places, but his service is worth it to me. We love going here, it feels like a small town hangout with the same friendly faces. On Fridays they have a live band who just loves what they do. They cover rock and roll classics, it's quirky in a good way. There are always new flavors of yogurt, and so many toppings that you won't know what to do with yourself! Honestly, they could have 2 flavors a and 5 toppings, and I'd go back just for the friendly atmosphere. They also sell breakfast and various food items, but I only go for the yogurt, which is delicious!"}
{"text":"This place seems to have improved recently. Friendly atmosphere, inviting layout, tasty yogurt. I especially appreciated they had several stevia-sweetened flavors! Frozen yogurt shops aren't usually great spots for carb-conscious folks, but these fit the bill. They weren't amazing, but if you're game with stevia then these were pretty good!!"}
{"text":"I was actually quite happy with Yogurt Kingdom, but maybe it's because I had just finished hiking Siphon Draw to Flat Iron and was so pooped that a burger and pound of frozen yogurt was going to be heavenly no matter what. Great yogurt selections and a cornucopia of toppings, though I wish there were more fresh fruits/berries.  Also, you usually never get hot food at fro-yo places so it was nice to get a full lunch in with the burger and fish and chips we ordered. All was tasty, though it was annoying they didn't have a printed menu. Besides that, all was good!"}
{"text":"It's so expensive -- today I got 3 small yogurts with one topping each and it was $17 -- I had a full punch card and they took off the smallest amount (of course ) ... I always feel ripped off when I leave here ... watch for a Groupon but even then they are sticklers only letting u use one discount at a time even when I bring in my big family -- sometimes when u run a business you should think about making customers feel good about coming here even if it means you lose a little profit -- I never wanna come back"}
{"text":"I stopped in to get a 99 cent corn dog. I also got a frozen yogurt also. While waiting for my corn dog I took time to admire the wall mural. My corn dog was made fresh. It came out steaming hot and perfectly golden. I enjoyed every bite. They don't use cheap hot dogs here. I also got a pineapple frozen yogurt. There are over a dozen flavors to choose from. I had a difficult time deciding which add ins to get. They have a ton to choose from. I selected strawberry topping and carob chips. The pineapple yogurt was refreshing on this warm day. I will be back when I'm in the area and have a hankering for a corn dog. It may have been a 5 star review but the diet coke dispenser was out of syrup and they didn't do anything to correct it. They gave me a bottle from the cooler which was ok, but a sign should have been placed on the machine."}
{"text":"From beginning to end, our visit to Yogurt Kingdom was exceptionally pleasant! We were greeted with warmth and friendliness and offered as many samples as we wished. The flavor and topping varieties were creative and plentiful! The owners were present, checking on each patron, asking if we had any comments/suggestions. The decor was fun and imaginative - good vibes all around. We definitely look forward to our next stop there!"}
