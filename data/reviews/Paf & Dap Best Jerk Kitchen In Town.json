{"text":"Ordered an oxtail stew and jerk chicken for take out. It's not fast food, and, it doesn't taste like it either. Excellent meal. Glad I stopped by."}
{"text":"****BUGS....ewwwww*****

Ok so I've never actually EATEN here but was silly enough to stop in one day looking to buy some roti shells/skins to go with the curry chicken i was cooking at home. 

Supposedly had none (?) and therefore couldnt/wouldnt sell me any-fine, that happens. But the truly upsetting part was that, as I stood at the \"bar\" having this convo, the woman working there pulled out a rolled-up magazine that I can only assume is their idea of pest management and nonchalantly swatted not one but TWO cockroaches crawling on the bar in the 90 seconds my convo took......and clearly did not find this odd. 

just....run....anywhere else....."}

As good as any I've had touring JA as well
Stopped by yesterday on a whim just to get some jerk chicken and was shocked how good!
Blows away a place like Allwyn's (BlogTO's #1 in 2015), the Jerk Joint, or Ritz's.

Unlike the previous reviewer, I saw no pests, the place was very clean, and service super friendly."}
