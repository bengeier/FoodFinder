{"text":"I'm often skeptical of restaurants with lofty missions. Often these restaurants receive stellar reviews because the social good overshadows the (often mediocre) food. 

Edwin's is a solid gastronomic experience with wonderful service. The dining experience is not as yet as polished as Chez François. Chez, though, has also been around longer. Edwin's will give them a run for their money in years to come. 

For this round with the Fine Dining Group I opted for: the Parisian Mule, the McKenzie salad, the braised rabbit and the soufflé. I liked the Mule so much I ordered a second instead of wine for my meal. 

The Mckenzie chèvre paired quite nicely with the poached pear. I could go on about this pear: it's translucent, jewel-like appearance; it's effervescent flavor. They must have steeped it a sparkling wine? 

The braised rabbit was a perfect main dish. Tender and spiced with nutmeg, cinnamon and -- I think -- ginger. It was served on a bed of sweet potato mash and micro-greens. There must have been a good harvest of micro greens this weekend because it was on everything. I will say that the spicy earthiness of the micro-greens paired superbly with the rabbit and sweet potatoes. 

The highlight of the evening was the Grand Marnier soufflé. I am not embarrassed to admit I ate the whole thing. By myself. I would (greedily!) do it again. It's like biting into an orange-y, boozy, delicious cloud. If I could have politely slurped up the remaining crème anglaise I would have. This was a group hit!

My companions loved their dishes as well: mushroom napoléon, steak tartare, risotto with wild mushrooms, the halibut wrapped in crispy potatoes, and scallops. 

I tried the artichoke barigoule. I have had better barigoules and artichoke dishes. The oregano was overpowering on this. 

I was also not bowled over by the other entrée options. However, the cheese tray looked superb and my friend enjoyed the steak tartare. 

My only other criticism is not unique to Edwin's: there ought to be more round tables for parties of 8 or more. 

Overall, Edwin's is a wonderful fine dining establishment. I plan to visit again to explore the variety of offerings!"}
{"text":"Edwin's is a treasure. Celebrated mom's birthday here tonight. Gerald was fantastic as a waiter. We wish him well as a chef in the coming weeks. Our Grouper was superb (we all ordered it based on Gerald's recommendation). The cheese selection is beyond anything this side of the Atlantic Ocean!! Bananas Foster made table side was a spectacular end to a delicious meal. The details from the setting, the music, the attention to diners... all intentional to the dining experience was appreciated!! Good luck to all in this endeavor. I hope more follow this lead."}
{"text":"Edwin's was simply great, from the minute you arrived to staff assisting with a group picture as we left. Frog legs, a fillet ground hamburger mixed with a variety of spices and sauces, etc it was all wonderful. Joe was our server, attentive-funny made sure we were well taken care of.  The owner stopped by several times to say hello and check on us even though it was quite busy.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Wow. That's all i have to say. I tried this place mainly because of what they do, but I was truly blown away. We ordered the lobster bisque, which was amazing. Then, for the main course, he ordered the venison and i ordered the duck with mushroom risotto. Creme brulee for dessert. All of the food was superb, as was the service. Everyone was incredibly attentive, not something that is still typical today other than in 5 star restaurants. We will definitely be back. Yes, it is pricey, but from experience it is more than worth the price and that price is going to good, sustainable things. And FYI to everyone who says the duck confit is too salty.... it is i fact a salt cured duck.  Not quite sure what else you would be expecting. It is not over salted in anyway and was perfectly done for exactly what it is."}
{"text":"Had the best burger in the world at EDWINS! Called the \"Le Burger.\"  Generous portions of 
 \"Hand-ground beef with fines herbes, bacon, mushrooms, arugula, fried garlic & sauce Diane prepared tableside. Served with goose fat fried potatoes.\""}
{"text":"Just had one of the best meals ever.  The rabbit was better than best I remembered since France.  The service was great.  The owner acted like he had nothing better to do than talk to us.  Then a waiter invited us to tour the   kitchen!
From cocktails and apps (make sure you try the terrine) at the bar to great dinner this was memorable."}
{"text":"Great French experience from wine, main course and dessert.  Lamb chops were excellent as well as the never ending bread and desserts.  The wait staff were very attentive and helpful with never ending bread."}
{"text":"I went here one day before work. I enjoyed the fine dining experience. The service was excellent. I had the lobster  bisque. It was very flavorful and had big chunks of lobster.
They have a great wine selection-although I could drink any before work. I will definitely return to enjoy dining outside before it gets too cold."}
{"text":"The soufflé desert here is one of the best deserts I've had anywhere! My pasta dish was good but kind of bland, as were the frog legs my partner got. He loved the tartare however as well as the main course he ordered. Since the food ranged from just good to excellent, given the prices I debated weather to give it 4 or 5 stars but went with 5 just because the desert was THAT good. The drinks were also good, but I think its a lot easier to make good drinks than it is food. The service was exceptional, the decor nice and a good location. Looking forward to coming here again."}
{"text":"Edwins is a really special place. If you don't know the backstory, do some research. It's definitely worth your time.

My boyfriend and I had such a wonderful time here. The space is very classy, but intimate and romantic. The main dining room is small, so I recommend making a rezo just in case. The ceilings are crazy high; there is a large window overlooking Shaker Square which lets in an incredible amount of light; white table clothes; beautiful china; and there is a cozy fireplace area where you can enjoy a drink. 

The service was absolutely fantastic. Our server was Cynthia, but she was not the only one to wait on us. It was a group effort--everyone pitched in at every table to help out. Everyone was kind, respectful, and polite. It's obvious that everyone wants to be there, wants to learn, and enjoys what they are doing. 

We started with a bowl of the lobster bisque. I've been really into soups lately, and I was pleased. Then we split a slice of the rabbit pie. The rabbit pie is not good for sharing as it is really tiny. We split it in half and I easily could have eaten my half in two or three bites. The rabbit pie was one of my favorite dishes of the night.

Next was the seafood sausage and the soft fried egg. The seafood sausage was good--my boyfriend really enjoyed it. I felt like the casing was a little overcooked though. The soft fried egg was okay. It wasn't amazing, but it wasn't horrible either. I would save your money and order something different.

For entrees, we had the scallops and the filet oscar. The scallops were one of my favorite dishes EVER. I couldn't get over how great they were. The scallops were served with purple potatoes and squash. A bite of all three was heaven. I really really really enjoyed this dish. I wish there were more scallops though as I only received three. My boyfriend has the filet oscar which had crab on top. My boyfriend loved this dish but I did not. To be fair though, when I took a bite it was getting cold so i guess I didn't get the full experience. The filet didn't seem juicy enough for me.

We originally ordered the souffle as our dessert. It was my first time having souffle. It was good, but I wouldn't go crazy over it. While waiting for our souffle, we saw the bananas foster lady preparing the bananas foster, which is prepared table side. If you are going to get a dessert, order the bananas foster!! Having it prepared table side is a really unique experience. I really enjoyed hearing her tell us about how it is prepared. And on top of that, it was delicious! Tastes similar to fried plantains. 

5 stars all around."}
{"text":"Ok I'll admit it, after a year living in Paris I am particular about my French food. Turns out that Cleveland is a pretty nifty place to go if you're a foodie, and this place is a dime for a fancy dinner date. Like for real, they take your coat at the door, and the servers place endless supplies of bread (with real butter!) pretty much the moment that the last slices enters your mouth. And ok, so the price range means that you're mostly likely to encounter what I did, mostly older well-to-do retired white people, but this restaurant is earning their stripes. Ambiance is dimly lit and romantic, definitely worth getting fancy for. I'm not a wine person per se, but their cellar looked well stoked and appropriately expensive.

The service could not be better. They are attentive, prompt, and know their menu. I asked for reccomendations on what was popular and delicious and was 100% satisfied with my selection. I ordered a roasted duck leg with some risotto/mushroom base (sadly I cannot find the exact entree name on Yelp's menu), but if you are any person who likes foul/duck, this dish is it.  The duck is roasted perfectly, keeping the juciness and tenderness locked inside a perfectly crisped skin. Not being a huge fan of mushrooms, I thought I would have larger problems than I did, perhaps something to do with the generous cream base. The mushrooms did provide plenty of texture to a burst of classic french cuisine. You can enjoy one on one, or combine the meat and risotto for a party in your mouth. My dining companion went the vegetarian route, and her plate was presented cleanly and attractively, although I did not have enough of a bite to make real thoughts on it. From the look on her face, she seemed about as content as I was doing my happy dance-wriggle in my chair.

Edwin's does this thing where they have 4 dishes made expertly in front of you - and we chose their dessert platter of bananas foster. The chef comes out with a copper fry pan, and flames big enough to burn your eyebrows if you get too close. Cook time is about 5 minutes, served so hot the ice cream melts almost immediately. The balance between cream and bananas is enough to make your mouth sing. 

My one lament is the lack of knowledge about the cheese plate. Oh my god, even though my eyes were bigger than the space in my stomach, it was something to behold. No less than 20 different varieties of cheese. Next time for sure. 

I pride myself on making the clean plate club - even if it meant collapsing into bed for a heavy slumber nearly immediately upon arrival home."}
{"text":"Having being to Lola, albatros and Table 45, this is the best food we have had in Cleveland. The staff is super friendly, the location is ideal. We will be back soon."}
{"text":"EDUCATION WINS!!

We had heard really good things about Edwin's and loved the concept. We visited using a gift card from family for a special night.

 I'll just say this up front - I've never experienced this level of customer service from any restaurant...ever. More later.

Food: Their menu has excellent vegan and vegetarian dishes and the food is excellent. I had the rabbit pie (very tasty) and the duck à l'orange (based on our server's recommendation), which was exquisite and way too much to eat at one sitting. My wife had the vegan sauteed lima bean dish - so much better than what she was expecting.

The decor is great - my wife (an educator) expressed interest in that and the process and was given a tour which she loved. Great patio on Shaker Square, too.

The serving staff was upbeat, constantly aware of what we needed but never intruding. Our main server (Kimberly) was a real pleasure and made excellent drink and food suggestions. It really felt like we were being taken care of by a whole team that's taking care of and helping each other.

Altogether an excellent dining experience on every level.

Now the more - when we got home, we found that my duck hadn't made it into the take home bag, a simple slip up. I called to let them know, but since we live almost an hour a way I didn't think there was anything they could do. Imagine my surprise when they told me they would have it Fedexed to me. I was floored. This was on a weekend and by Monday it hadn't arrived, so I left them an email that I was disappointed, but still a huge fan. When we got home later, there was a message ( I think from Rebecca) on my phone to call so they could take care of me. Before I could return the call there was a knock on the door, and it was Jon (the Director of Education) who apologized for the problem with the Fedex delivery and proceeded to give me a bag with wine, duck, breads, cheeses and desserts. I was gobsmacked. Going to this length to satisfy a first time, non VIP customer was beyond remarkable.

Receiving the food was amazing, but even better is knowing that this kind of customer service exists and this is part of what is being passed on to the people in the program. 

Thank you Brandon, Jon, Rebecca and everyone on the team - you are truly the best!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, enchanting atmosphere, and all with a wonderful mission. Going to any restaurant on opening night can be exciting and challenging at the least, but it was just excitement at Edwin's. The staff in their training program were as professional as any other fine dining restaurant in Cleveland.  They made great suggestions and were more than accommodating. The mushroom risotto was delicious and the horseradish salmon was probably one of the best dishes I have ever eaten in Cleveland!!!!!   This is a great place all around and should be a must stop for ANYone living in or visiting Cleveland."}
{"text":"11 years ago we didn't really know the term \"foodie\" we just knew that we both had a love of food, cooking techniques and unique dining experiences...it has remained a constant in our marriage.  Edwins made our 11th anniversary memorable on all counts.  The staff treated us like royalty, fussing just enough to make our experience special without intruding on our evening.  The wine pairing was simply excellent (our wine steward went the extra mile by obtaining the vintage label for us so that we could find some for home).  We began with the seafood sausage as a shared entrée (the proper French menu terminology used here) and the moved relaxedly to the main event: The unique experience as well as a display of technique came in the form of the Caneton de Rouen à la Presse, prepared table side in two courses. The Chef/owner keeps track of the people who order this culinary masterpiece in a journal and we were number 50 or so (being in the company of about 100 other people certainly does fulfill the uniqueness of the experience) and is genuinely happy to see people enjoy his efforts and we certainly appreciated them, it was delicious!  After the salad course (once again served in proper French order) we opted for coffee and dessert which came in the form of Bananas Foster (also prepared table side because we were being pains-the-neck but they didn't complain a bit) with their own house made vanilla ice cream, a perfect end to a perfect meal.  If you want to make an impression on someone, or just want something very good to eat, go to Edwins."}
{"text":"Outstanding restaurant! The restaurant successfully merges arguably the best cuisine in Cleveland with a compassionate mission.  In our experience, such endeavors usually result in a successful mission coupled with the experience of feeling like a sacrifice. Nothing is of course wrong with giving back to those less fortunate. But the food at Edwin's is so delicious that we felt like they had sacrificed for us!  I had the seafood sausage while my wife had the rabbit pie, an absolutely decadent dish. For dessert, the Grand Marnier soufflé was superb.  You will not regret this restaurant. But be prepared...you're donation to charity will feel like cheating."}
{"text":"My husband and I had dinner at Edwins last Saturday evening. We decided to try it after reading about their concept. We had a delightful experience. Every staff member from the host to our waiter and everyone else in between was very kind and helpful. The food was delicious. I had the lamb chops and my husband had the duck breast. Both dishes were fantastic.  The waiter did forget to bring out our appetizer but we were not charged for it. We decided we didn't need it after having soup and our entrées. We were pretty full and wanted to try dessert. I would definitely return to Edwins when in the Cleveland area."}
{"text":"I visited this restaurant for the first time last night.  The menu was pricey, but I had heard good things.  I had the burger that my wife didn't think would be worthy of a place like Edwin's, but I got it anyway.  I am glad I did.  Though it required a knife and fork, it was amazing.  My wife had the 5 course beer paired menu.  Each course was excellent.  Edwin's was a great experience from top to bottom!"}
{"text":"I have one thing to say, \"Impressive.\"  When the owner brings your car around, because the valet service is busy, that is service. From the bread to the food, I was very pleased."}
{"text":"The staff are the most attentive of any place that I have been to in Cleveland. Our waiter was so nice and helpful- he made us want to keep coming back. We had the escargot as an appetizer which was good but my boyfriend's main course of the halibut paupiettes was amazing. This is a traditional french restaurant so expect small-ish courses. The food left us satisfied but not stuffed. We will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"A surprisingly artful and delicious dinner! Started with the Lobster bisque-it's a full size bowl,hearty portion and excellent! Second was the frog legs. Lightly fried and very juicy. Seasoning was perfect. Third was rabbit pie. It was tasty but not my favorite part of the meal. For only $10 is was well worth a try but with the expansive menu I would probably skip it next time. Lastly I had the foie gras. Probably one of the best I've ever had. It was a large portion, 2 full size pieces on lightly toasted French bread with a fig sauce. Service was excellent and the food was worthy of a 5 star restaurant. I will definitely be going back many more times!"}
{"text":"We tried Edwin's for the first time Saturday night.  The restaurant is beautiful and the service impeccable.  Kim was our server and she was outstanding.  She had the help of a lot of other friendly staff (water, bread, etc.).  The food was delicious, especially the appetizers (artichokes and potato soup) and we will definitely go back."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I had dinner for valentine's Day. The restaurant had a great ambiance, romantic and enjoyed the piano at dinner. The food was ok, nothing like what I expected from reading other reviews. I had the duck confit, which was super salty couldn't eat much of it. my boyfriend had the filet mignon, which was soft, cooked to order but lacked much flavor and was very small. I have to say dessert probably was the best part of dinner. We had the banana foster prepared at the tableside, which was enjoyable to see and tasted pretty good too. Overall, food was ok, dessert was good and service was great other than our waiter couldn't tell us soup of the day."}
{"text":"Best place ever!!!! My favorite place in all of Cleveland- amazing food and attentive compassionate service- not snooty feeling and has an easy going vibe, which is good because I don't want eat in a Museum.  I can dig it!!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely, without a doubt, the BEST dining experience we've had in Cleveland! From the moment you walk in the door, your every wish is attended to. The BEST STAFF ANYWHERE...BY FAR! Each staff member is friendly, fast, professional, attentive, thoughtful, and sincerely committed to making your experience at Edwin's the best it can possibly be. Phenomenally prepared food, perfect portions, flawless presentation, and superb service, all add up to a great dining experience. Attention to detail is evident everywhere at Edwin's,  from the friendly greetings and coat check as you enter,  to the perfectly groomed yin-yang salt & pepper dishes at each table,  to the freshly laundered guest towels in the restrooms...thought has been devoted to it all. Jordan Levine was our host on the evening we dined at Edwin's, and he was masterfully gracious to all of his guests. Hats off to Brandon Chrostowski for creating such a fantastically powerful force for positive change in Cleveland. I can't wait for summer when the sidewalk cafe is open outside! SEE YOU THERE!"}
{"text":"This place was wonderful - delicious food, excellent wine, a great atmosphere and an even better cause.  Our server was definitely still getting his bearings, but he was professional and provided solid service.  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Both my wife and I have been in love with L'Albatross for years...so when we found out that Brandon Chrostowski had opened his own place with a French Bistro theme staffed with folks he is attempting to give a second chance...we had to give the place a try. O.M.G...good thing we did!

On a recent Saturday night we sat on the outdoor patio and watched the world go by as we were served a magical meal.  We started the meal by sharing a salad with champagne vinaigrette dressing...the highlight of which was the (lightly) friend goat cheese, a fantastic addition to the already unique salad.  Next up was the escargot dressed in butter and parsley...although different than its counterpart (at L'Albatross)  it was more \"rustic\" and truer to the originals found in Paris.

Then came the cheese plate.  Oh...the cheese plate.  Their new fromager was well versed in his selections, and helped us choose a five-count selection that blew us away.  The highlight of the plate?...the Epoisses by Berthaut (from Burgundy France)  that I would actually live in if i could.  Truly the best cheese i have ever eaten.

For the main course, my wife and I shared the horseradish crusted salmon with cucumbers and crème fraiche, which was very tasty and uniquely prepared and presented.

Finally, we settled on a chocolate soufflé for dessert, that the chef claimed was the greatest individual souffle she had ever created...and we could not argue.  Silky, creamy, buttery, perfect.

What a great way to cap a beautiful evening...thanks Edwin's!"}
{"text":"This place was great! Everybody was friendly and super attentive. They have pride in what they do.
The food was excellent. Our kids enjoyed cauliflower gratin, and the beef pasta. We also had soup, fish, and much more! Each dish had unique touch and flavor to it. We truly enjoyed our dinner."}
{"text":"We had a belated Valentines dinner at Edwins last night and couldn't have picked a more perfect spot. The service was excellent from the moment we walked in, food was beyond delicious and the ambiance (including the blazing fireplace) was just what you would want for a cozy, romantic dinner. 
We split foie gras, an appetizer on special which was beautifully arranged on a bed of greens with a tasty vinaigrette. For mains, I had the steak and my boyfriend had the scallops, both of which deserve 10 out of 10. My steak had a cream and peppercorn sauce and was served with fancy french fries. 
We also splurged for dessert (hello, Valentines Day) and got the Duo of Chocolate which includes a small portion of mousse and two thin slices of flour less chocolate tart which was was the perfect ending to our meal.
To top it all off, this place has a great mission and any gratuity you leave goes back to the organization (we were really surprised and happy to see this). 
I would highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing food and service. Felt like we were dining in Paris , not Shaker Square.  I will definitely eat there again. Great place for a romantic dinner."}
{"text":"Amazing service, food and atmosphere! New favorite place to eat in CLE.

- appetizers: oysters (sweet Jesus), escargot, rabbit pie, duck pâté
- tomato basil soup
- main: grouper, rabbit, scallops, steak, lamb chops
- desert: banana flambé, creme brûlée, chocolate mouse

Honestly, can't pick a favorite dish - the food was finger-licking good!
Attentive service and cozy atmosphere rounded out a beautiful evening."}
{"text":"My wife and I shared a beautiful evening here. The staff was attentive and knowledgeable. The food and cocktails were on point. We had french 75s to start with oysters. Then aviations with foie gras. We split a rabbit with red wine. The cheese cart was a plethora of stinky delights, shared with a Chimay. Finally dessert. Chocolate souffle with a port for her and a scotch for myself. Uber for home."}
{"text":"Came here for my birthday and we ordered the pressed duck. Absolutely phenomenal. Best service we've ever had at a restaurant."}
{"text":"Fantastic dinner. Frog legs and Escargot were delicious. Dessert was unreal and my cocktail was right on point! Well done!"}
{"text":"I would return for the cheese cart alone, but everything else about Edwin's is great too. It's been a while since I went to a restaurant and had service this attentive. The drinks were good and the food delicious - no complaints."}
{"text":"We loved it. The food is phenomenal. The service is exceptional. We absolutely loved our entire experience here. Tried the arugula salad, the horseradish salmon and the hen/Brussels sprout dish. They also have an extensive wine list. They treated us really well for a birthday and we couldn't have been happier!"}
{"text":"I loved Edwin's \"education-wins.\" 

The decor has only a few relatively minor changes from the previous occupants.  The newly draped windows adds warmth, privacy and an air of exclusivity.  It also hides the scores of diners that maybe inside.  On our second visit we found the seating area around the fireplace both cozy & sexy, a nice change to sitting at the bar for a late night cocktail.  

The food was on point, my salmon was perfectly cooked on top of refreshing bed of cucumbers.  The staff was pleasant, plentiful, professional and attentive.  Brandon rocks!

So the draw backs? Take your reading glasses the menu print is small & the darkness makes reading it impossible, so we went with the staff's recommendations & was not disappointed."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. From its mission to the service and food everything was amazing. Had cheese from the cart and my cheese loving self was in seven heaven. Fast forward to dessert and the bananas foster table side made me want to move to Ohio to be able to eat it everyday."}
{"text":"Where cuisine meets compassion.....this restaurant does not miss on either. We were dining with a large group who had bought out the restaurant. For a fixed menu there was a large selection of ambitious starters and main courses from escargot and omelette to lamb chops, duck l'orengerie, to grouper in potatoes. All delicious and beautifully presented. The service is attentive, disciplined, and sincere while maintaining a professional attitude.
Best of luck Brandon you and your staff are an inspiration for the human nutrition we need both body and soul."}
{"text":"Every foodie in Cleveland needs to try Edwins -- not because it's on the cutting edge of the Food Scene, delivering never-before-seen dishes, but rather the opposite.

Edwins is an Old School French restaurant delivering the classics that you just can't find in Cleveland anymore, or pretty much anywhere else. Coming here is the equivalent to going to a movie theater showing a flick from the 1940s and 1950s -- you are going to have an experience that you thought was extinct.

After sipping on a perfectly blended Old-Fashioned ($12), I started with the Langoustine Francaise ($16) which was meat of the Langoustine tucked inside a bird's nest pastry and it came with a Sauce Langouste that was creamy with a seafood taste similar to a lobster bisque (Aside: a French restaurant has to have great sauces and Edwins delivers. Another Aside: How many people have even ever heard of a Sauce Langouste?).

Jeannene tried the omelet appetizer ($12) and she thoroughly enjoyed it, saying it was perfectly blended and cooked and was just the right amount.

I moved on to the Paupiettes de Merou ($29) -- Grouper wrapped in potatoes with a beurre rouge. The server said it was the most popular dish on the menu and, again, I quite enjoyed the sauce which was a little creamier than I was expecting from a wine sauce. The fish was a little dry but I was amid a party of 14 people so I would expect the kitchen to be a little overtaxed.

Jeannene had the horseradish-crusted salmon ($28) with a cucumber cream sauce. She was pleased that the horseradish was subtle and the salmon was cooked beautifully.

The staff was very attentive, always making sure our bread plate was full (the other imperative for a French restaurant) as were our water glasses. The table of 14 did lead to some confusion from the new waiters over who had which dishes but, again that's too be expected.

We are already planning on returning to try many other dishes that we've heard about but never actually seen on a menu. One warning -- Yelp lists this as a $$$ restaurant but it does seem like you can expect to add an extra dollar sign.

I won't get into the great story behind the chefs and the staff they employ because the food and the service are able to stand on their own merits just like any other excellent restaurant around here."}
{"text":"Love that the restaurant hires a lot of previously incarcerated individuals. The atmosphere was good but the food was hit or miss. The salted duck was okay but the risotto was amazing. I'm not sure that I would come again."}
{"text":"FANTASTIC! Absolutely great service, delicious food and the owner is darling. Couldn't have asked for a better night. Cheers!"}
{"text":"Best restaurant experience ever. Food was great, drinks were great and service was suburb. Thank you Staff and John--not sure if he is the manager but he was super attentive and just a class act in every aspect. Well recommended!!!! Check out their patio!!!!"}
{"text":"Just enjoyed a fantastic lunch on Edwins patio! Fresh, crisp local greens perfectly dressed with roasted beets and pears. Gazpacho had a nice \"kick\", again locally grown ingredients. Service and ambiance great as always."}
{"text":"This is a great restaurant with a great mission behind it. The food is authentically French. The service is genuinely hospitable. We spent our anniversary here, and it was the best possible choice.  Give them a try--it's a great cause!"}
{"text":"What an awesome place! Service is top notch, food is great, desserts are incredible! Brandon, keep it up!"}
{"text":"5 for the mission, 4.5 for the overall experience/service, 4 for the food.

I came here with my husband for Valentine's Day. Edwin's has an amazing vibe (tall ceilings, sophisticated grey interior, painting of french lady, moody lanterns) that doesn't take itself too seriously. While the ambiance is romantic, the feel is still upbeat -- down-to-earth service and classic R&B keeps the place relaxed. While not everyone may appreciate the R&B, we felt it added a nice groove and it seemed like it kept the servers relaxed too. 

They are serious about their food though. It is a restaurant with training chefs and servers (leadership and training for people facing re-entry), and they are reaching for that finesse. The French menu is serious and I think it's amazing that those hired have access to this type of training. Many props to the owner/manager for his vision and effort.

We ordered the seafood sausage to start (yum - 4.5) and the rabbit pie. As others have noted, the rabbit pie is quite small, but the flavor was on point. We also tried the very extensive fromage offerings - $4 per cheese. Very impressive display of cheeses.

As for entrees, I very much enjoyed my \"Paupiettes de poisson du jour\" - market fish wrapped in crispy thinly sliced potato on top of french green beans and a buttery wine sauce. mmmm - perfect execution. I highly recommend this! My husband got the duck leg confit on a bed of mushroom risotto. It was a pretty large portion size. He felt the duck was a little on the salty side. 

We also got glasses of wine to accompany, which our server recommended to us. Service was excellent - attentive and amiable. You also get unlimited bread - it's delicious - and servers won't hesitate to refill your plate.

Definitely recommend if you are looking for good French food and if you want to support a good mission."}
{"text":"One of the best cheese selections in the city. The manager/cheesemonger's vast knowledge of all of their cheeses descriptions and flavors excellently inform his choices and pairings. We often find ourselves coming here after a meal elsewhere just for the cheese course."}
{"text":"If you want an amazing fine dining experience with exceptionally down-to-earth service, Edwins is the place to go! I came here on Valentine's day and was simply blown away by the food and  service! 

I started off with the rabbit pie for an appetizer. The presentation of the pie was so-so, but the taste was rich, savory, and just all around amazing! Portion size was small for the price, but it probably would have been too rich if it were any bigger! I got the horseradish encrusted salmon. I usually steer away from ordering salmon at restaurants because salmon is just one of those dishes that just never impressed me. However, I ordered it at Edwins because other Yelpers had recommended it. And OMG it was delicious!! The creamy sauce along with the crunchiness of the cucumber slices were just perfect. I definitely recommend this dish! I also tried some of my boyfriend's sauteed scallops, and wow they were GREAT! Unlike many other fancy restaurants, the portion size for both our entrees was very generous. To end our meal, we ordered the grand marnier souffle. This took about 25 minutes to prepare, so be ready for the wait! But we didn't mind because it was definitely worth it :)

Overall, I give Edwins 4.5 stars. Unfortunately, I have to take down 0.5 stars because there was quite a lot of confusion at the restaurant on Valentine's day. I presume it was probably one of their busiest days since opening. But here is what happened. After we had ordered our food, it took about 30 minutes for our rabbit pie to come. During this wait time, we noticed that our neighbors, who were seated about 10 minutes after us had already gotten their dish within 10 minutes. It turned out that the servers had mixed up the orders and gave them our rabbit pie. Once they figured this out, they brought out our rabbit pie as soon as possible. I felt bad for our neighbors because they were certainly not expecting to eat rabbit that night! Also, when we ordered the grand marnier souffle, we were told that it would take 25 minutes to get ready. However, it came out within 10 minutes. \"Yay!\", we thought. However, this was actually for our neighbors and it was a different type of souffle!! The server was extremely generous and still gave us our grand marnier souffle. Double desserts? Yes please! :) At the end of our dining experience, they also had a mix up with our bills. To be fair, it was probably an unexpectedly busy day for them. But since the restaurant is arranged with the tables super close to each other, this probably didn't help the situation. Despite this slight fiasco, I still enjoyed my experience at Edwins and will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Best Cleveland restaurant to open in a while! It sits in Shaker Square, and is staffed by \"front of the house\" and \"back of the house\" workers, some of who are transitioning from incarceration to a career in the food industry.  Heading it all up is Brandon Chrostowski, well known from L'Albatros, and his knowledge of food and service clearly shows! The food is supposedly \"Industrial French\", and while I don't know what that means, let's just leave it at this: exceptional cooking in traditional French style with an authenticity that is hard to beat! The lobster bisque is a delight, the braised artichokes are yummy, and I loved the strip steak and frites!  My steak was cooked perfectly and the pepper sauce was excellent. Mild complaint was that the fries were not as crisp as I normally like. My friend had the \"Paupiettes de poisson\", a grouper wrapped in crispy, thin sliced potatoes in a delightful sauce. I had a delightful bite of that as well, and the fish was moist and the dish succeeds. 
The restaurant has just opened so there were some rough bits to iron out; however, the overall sense that one gets is that the staff is well trained, and the kitchen is well run. My only quibble is with the \"by the glass\" wine list, which seems to be a work in progress. 
The decor is very refined and they have done a great job with the space. A cheese cart paraded by a few times and looked to have a varied selection.
Finally, I should add that the restaurant is part of an \"institute/foundation\" so that your bill comes as a contribution to a 501 (c) and is tax deductible!!!
I'll definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I really liked this restaurant!  She had salmon. I had scallops. The salmon was crusted with horse radish (mild) and the scallops were seared with duck fat and placed in a hot servivg dish surrounded with very light flavorful mashed potatoes.  Both meals were excellent!
The part of the restaurant we were seated at was quiet and relaxing.  The service was very attentive.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The idea behind the restaurant is great. They help make ex cons learn skills so that the can make a good living and get accepted by the society. 
Food is good. Not the greatest. 
Lobster bisque was average. Not like McCormick. 
Braised rabbit was not what i expected. Was very dry and didn't feel soft.
Duck was good.
Service was fine."}
{"text":"Edwin's offers wonderful meals & outstanding service.  The ambiance is warm & inviting.  The wait staff were very responsive & knowledgeable.  The prices aren't bad for meals of this quality."}
{"text":"Let me get to the most important part first. My fiance and I enjoyed all of the food, and we ordered plenty, including first and second and main courses, and drinks, but we both agreed that the absolute best part of the evening was the chocolate bomb. ORDER THE CHOCOLATE BOMB DESSERT. 

The concept of this place makes it special. Who knew that Edwins stands for Education Wins?! I'm not sure if that makes me appreciate the name more or less, but it is an interesting tidbit that we learned from reading the back of the menu. 

The servers were super attentive...which makes sense as everyone is in training. A glass of water was knocked over at our table almost as soon as we sat down, and immediately there was someone wiping the floor down with a cloth napkin. 

Interior of the restaurant is very nice. It's a good place for a date as the vibe is romantic yet artsy. The outdoor patio looks like fun but has an entirely different atmosphere. There was loud music playing, even at night, when we were there. 

I may go back just for the chocolate bomb alone."}
{"text":"What an amazing concept for Cleveland!  Edwins is not a name - it stands for education wins.  It is a place for \"second chancers\" who want to learn culinary arts skills.  
The building itself is rustic looking and very romantic.  It fits the mood for french cuisine.  Even the TV was in black and white the night we dinned.  
Our table had filets, salmon, market fish, seafood sausage and lobster bisque.  Not out of this world,  but great quality!  The sever was Very attentive and served our Very yummy meals.  
The dessert course was outstanding.  The creme brûlée was delicious and the most light preparation I've ever had.  Really good. 
The bananas foster tableside was also excellent. Nom. Nom. Nom.  
Great concept, great ambiance, great food."}
{"text":"What a delight.  Cleveland truly has a gem here with Edwin's.  I'm shocked that this restaurant doesn't have a Michelin star. In fact, it's surprising the city of Cleveland doesn't have a single Michelin starred restaurant.  

I learned a lot during my trip to Cleveland and this restaurant.  I learned that there is some fine French inspired cuisine that employs formerly incarcerated individuals to help them back on their feet.  The story is the owner had two minor charges as a youth and decided to pick his life up and trained in culinary arts in France. He opened this restaurant not only for his craft but to give back to the community and help people get their life back together.  Truly inspiring ! 

I also learned that the restaurant, despite its charitable roots proves that it can offer superb service in par with the top restaurants I have been fortunate enough to frequent.  Outstanding!

I also learned that there is such a thing as table side hamburger where they present the cut of meat and grind it table side.  Then sear it with an impressive show.  

The overall experience was fantastic.  The menu leaves so much to explore. I hope I get a chance to return."}
{"text":"I went with my friend from Toronto a month ago.  We were really impressed with the whole experience...The staff was so extremely friendly courteous and knowledgeable about the menu.  My friend is bringing people down from Toronto to experience this wonderful restaurant
Also, the owner Brennan is great too .. On a Saturday night , when the restaurant was extremely busy he gave us a tour of the kitchen and the working classroom downstairs."}
{"text":"This is a phenomenal restaurant for many reasons .. The food superb ... The idea of helping people learn a trade excellent .. Brandon is doing something wonderful ... This is a must new restaurant to try .. Do not miss this .. Best new restaurant in Cleveland this year!!"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner, and everyone agreed that the food and service here are top notch! Of course, if you come here, come with the expectation that it will be expensive, but you're paying for quality! We started our meal with the frogs legs- it was all of our first times trying them, and we all loved them. The parsley garlic sauce is awesome, and the meat itself tastes a lot like chicken! For the entrees, 2 of us ordered the burger, which was prepared tableside. It was an amazing burger! It's definitely a fork and knife burger though. The meat was tasty and the sauce on top is amazing! Some other dishes that we all loved were the seafood sausage, and lobster bisque, and the duck terrine. We all shared a chocolate souffle for dessert- very fluffy, and the chocolate sauce poured on top is massively addictive. Overall, the food was exceptional as was the service, and I would definitely return!"}
{"text":"What a fantastic experience! My wife and I celebrated our 29th anniversary at Edwins. It was packed on a Monday night - which is great. We started with the cheese cart and a couple of Malbec's to toast.  The presenter knew the cheeses and paired them to our wine. 
My wife had the burger - made at your table - which was delicious.  I had the salmon which was also fantastic.  We will definitely be back to support this gem and their mission to change lives in NE Ohio!"}
{"text":"The staff is so sweet and eager to please. They are by far the best part of this restaurant. The food itself was good but not great and probably not worth the price I paid. I had to send back the lobster bisque because it was bland and fishy but the salad I had was great. Nothing was really remarkable except the bill. I love and support their mission but I did not love the food."}
{"text":"I finally had an opportunity to dine at Edwin's and definitely enjoyed the experience.  The food was 4 stars, but the experience was definitely a 5.  The entire staff from the host stand to the wait staff was eager to please and could not have been nicer.  My bread plate and water glass was never empty.  No request was too small and the attention to detail, was superb!  My friend and I dined here on a busy Friday night, making a reservation thru Open Table.  As other reviewers have stated, the prices are not cheap, but I also firmly believe that you get what you pay for.  The wine, by the glass, was way over-priced in my opinion, but the food was fairly priced based on the quality.  I ordered the potato encrusted Grouper with haricot verts in a beurre blanc sauce.  There were a few bones in the Grouper, but nothing major.  The portion was ample, and the sauce was devine.  My friend ordered the salmon and was equally pleased.  We both opted for the beignets for dessert, which were just ok, probably would try one of the souffles or bread pudding on a future visit.  All in all, I would return!"}
{"text":"A wonderful experience.
We went to Edwins to celebrate my birthday, and it really delivered on making it special. The staff was very friendly, accommodating and willing to make our experience as good as possible. The atmosphere was cool, casual and relaxed, but it was still clear that we would be fine-dinning. 

I liked their braised rabbit leg. I have to admit that the meat itself was not mind-blowing (still good, though), but its juices were great. The mashed sweet potatoes with corn, though, were AMAZING. We had a selection of their cheeses, and we were impressed by their quality, taste, and how well our waiter was at educating us about their profiles. The quince paste to cleanse the pallet was extraordinary as well. 

For dessert, I had the Gran Marnier Souffle. It was pure perfection. Loved it! It came with creme Anglaise, which was good as well. I can attest that the Napoleon was also delicious and pretty well made. 

I wish that this restaurant keeps up its standards so we get to enjoy it for many years to come."}
{"text":"EDWINS (education wins-little fun fact) is phenomenal on so many levels. They take former incarcerated individuals- train them how to thrive in the service industry and give them purpose...I mean, how cool is that?

Aside from the background story, this place is such a treat. The space is cozy, intimate and elegant feeling, while still maintaining a casual vibe. The food & drunks are excellent. THE CHEESE TRAY! OMG. Whoever the guy was that was working when we came in had to have been the most knowledgeable person about cheese that I could have ever encountered. He had the best descriptions and suggestions. They wheel it around and show you all of the different selections and have them categorized by taste & flavor, depending on what tickles your fancy. 

We came here for Valentine's day and ordered 5 cheese selections (such a fun experience getting to choose) oysters and each had the duck confit. The duck was tender and delicious but someone got a little heavy handed with the salt so it was sodium city. Nevertheless, a must-try dish. 

Most of the service is A+ but there are some you can tell are still learning and lack a little--but you gotta cut them some slack. The tips are split between all of the staff. 

Coming back ASAP!"}
{"text":"Edwin's completely wowed us!

We didn't know what to expect. Heard great things and there were vegan options  so we tried Edwin's out for our anniversary dinner.

I got the horseradish salmon - I was nervous the horseradish would be too overbearing, but it was perfectly balanced with a sauce. Boyfriend got the vegan Mac n cheese and the tofu dish and he was impressed.

What stood out the most was the service. I've been to dinner at a lot of nice places, but have never had service this perfectly coordinated. To the point where when I got up to use the restroom, I came back to my food covered with a silver lid to keep it warm and my napkin perfectly folded and placed back on the table. The waitress was aware of the second I returned, immediately uncovered my food and put the napkin on my lap. The owner walked me to the restroom, didn't. Just point to where it was. Great food, service, and an excellent cause."}
{"text":"One of the finer restaurants in Cleveland, and a great mission by the owner, great work on the food and mission"}
{"text":"I have been here several times over the past couple years and never written a review...I APOLOGIZE!

This place has minimalist decor that makes you feel comfortable. 
A private fireside sofa for cozy, intimate convo and cocktails.
Full bar with creative specialty cocktails and martinis.

The service with a purpose is spectacular. They attend to your requests and needs. Even make accommodations by request if the ingredients are in the kitchen

Light, fresh bread and soft creamy butter is endless as well as still or complimentary sparkling water. 

Now for the food!
Try the soup du jour...corn chowder with pearl onions was rich and flavorful served hot!
We also ordered the special salad which as you see was loaded with antioxidants and fresh fruit and nuts.
The horseradish topped salmon floating atop a cucumber delight of sauce was bite for bite savory and not overpowering with the horseradish. They said it was butter (duh), Parmesan and the fresh horseradish! Yummmmm!

The crunchy thinly baked potato crusted grouper swimming in a red wine butter reduction was sooooo amazing, more bread had to be brought to get every last drop of sauce on the plate.

Lastly, the table side Bananas Flambé... not too sweet and well prepared...my only complaint was it was only one banana and two small scoops of ice cream. For $10, might you have given larger scoops or another banana? 

No worries, I will return again and again as I love this place and it's purpose!  Way to give back, Brandon!"}
{"text":"Beyond our expectations!  New year's eve was a most memorable occasion because of the sensational food, ambiance and service we enjoyed at Edwins.  How often do you dine where everyone at the table is served simultaneously and cleared the same way. SPECTACULAR! Only once before at one of Emeril's restaurants in Vegas did we have such service and it was memorable then and again now. Thank you for starting our year off with the best service and food we have had in years. Keep up the wonderful work and we will share our experience with friends and family."}
{"text":"This restaurant is located right at the heart of pothole-riddled Shaker Square. Potholes aside, Shaker square is beautiful, and in and off itself a great space reminiscent of a European-style plaza. Well-designed plazas invite the energy of interaction, gathering and socialization; and give it back. Edwins, among the many great restaurants here, are at the heart of it all.

The food? The lobster bisque had bits of real lobster in it. Awesome. This wasn't your over-creamed bisque that's to be found in chain restaurants. This thing tasted like the sea. The duck confit on a bed of mushroom risotto was crunchy, satisfying and tender. Dessert had the element of danger with bananas foster flambé prepared table-side.

Ambience? Ultra fancy. High ceilings. High energy. We had a crowd Friday night. This place was happening, and crowded indeed.

Service? We had courteous, polite servers who were clearly trying their very best. Some might have acted like novices, but they might have been novices indeed at rebuilding their lives: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qs6fEKFhI5M . All, however, took a lot of pride in their work."}
{"text":"What a terrific experience! My mothers birthday was on a Tuesday and can you believe the place was packed to capacity. Well upon being seated I soon understood why. The service was undoubtedly the best I've ever had, from the attentive waiting staff all the way to meeting the owner, we had a magical experience, one we'll never forget. The scallops were cooked to perfection, the delicious sweet breads alongside the bananas foster were all mouth watering creations prepared by a very talented chef. Thank you again for such a magnificent experience. You can feel the love that goes into each and every dish. You can also feel the pride in the staff members that seem to have dedicated themselves to providing wonderful service. Thanks again everyone for making my mothers birthday one she'll remember forever!!!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing place and food.  I had amazing food when I was there.  Great service.  If you're looking for a fine dining experience and a great opportunity to take part in making lives better, give this place a try."}
{"text":"Teaching Restaurant so expected to find some learning going on, which I did but when you ask each server about their experience you can sense the passion each and everyone share. Pleasantly surprised as to the amazing food options, over the top and quite complicated in food offerings and pairings. Not easy for someone such as myself to even understand the selections with my extensive restaurant experience on my travels. Hats down a great idea that can only blossom other culinary dreams! Keep up the great work. Continue educating, especially the servers with the ins and outs. My only suggestion is to have the stories as to the pairing choices and encourage the patrons such as myself to engage the servers and ask them about his or her food spark!!!"}
{"text":"Edwins was FANTASTIC! The food was delicious & the service was phenomenal. Everyone there was so welcoming and attentive. They made sure you always had what you needed (more bread, water, another drink...). The food came out quickly & was very high quality. Our waiter (Josh) went above & beyond to make sure we had a great dining experience. I can't say enough good things about Edwins & highly recommend it to others."}
{"text":"I was hoping that we would have a great experience here over the Christmas visit but this dinner was just OK. The interior is beautiful and very cozy. 
 
Unfortunately our server had a severe cold and I was very disappointed that anyone would allow her to be on the floor serving. I witnessed significant coughing and sneezing and could see has sweating quite a bit. 

I had the seabass which was good but again not great. My friend had the steak and the amount or pepper crust was a bit overbearing."}
{"text":"From setting to food, this place is top notch.  In my visits, I've had the rabbit, the frogs legs, the grouper, and the venison.  Each meal was delightfully executed."}
{"text":"one of the best establishments in all of Cleveland, Ohio. it's got a nice vibe, the service is full of heart and hard work and for the most part the food is quite good. the cheese course is second to none and the bar does a nice job with a fine wine list to back it up. the message is clear - teach the community to bake bread instead of giving it to them and everyone prospers. i salute this restaurant!"}
{"text":"I recently visited Edwins for the first time for an event. I was very pleased with the white table cloth settings and atmosphere of the restaurant. We were waited on hand and foot and found the service to be well trained in the offerings of the restaurant. The experience is one I won't soon forget. The meats are cured in house and the cheeses were different and tasty."}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best fancy dinners I have ever had! Honestly the only other ones I can think of are L'Albatross and the 5 course chef's tasting at Dante. 

So what makes this place so great? First off their mission; instant points for being a place that helps formerly incarcerated persons by giving them a chance at a successful transition back into society by teaching them a skilled trade, offering support and guidance, and empowering them through passion for the hospitality industry. And let me tell you, these people are more than willing to serve you, to try and excel at what they are doing, and provide everyone with a great experience. It all started with my communications with the manager, Jordan, he was personable and more than accommodating when my supper club reservations kept increasing in size. Then there were our waiters, Matt and Robert, both played along with my feisty harassing of them and served our table of 17 with plenty of smiles and without any major issues. 

Next up, the food! I'll be real wit cha, I did not really care for the bread they serve but that is no biggie. But I was into the unique French dishes they provided which are perfect if your palette is open to exploring things like frog legs $15, escargot (a little earthy), and fois gras. They also have an excellent cheese selection and lobster bisque soup if you'd rather play things on the safe side. Next up are the main dishes, mmm I still think about that horseradish crusted salmon in a creamy cucumber sauce $28 mmm drooling... they also had this tasty beef and noodles dish, venison cooked perfectly (no chewy gamey meat here), a pretty scallops dish, and things get real fancy when you order a burger because they grind it up and fry it tableside! 

For dessert they offer bananas foster which they cook tableside as well, but this had a strong alcohol taste to it so I did not really care for it, but let me tell you, they make their drinks $11 deceivingly strong too and my silly mouthy side was in full force this night after just two tasty concoctions! (Disclaimer, I specifically asked for fruity sweet drinks, they definitely have the kind of cocktails that burn going down and pack a bunch if you're more into putting hair on your chest). Back to the desserts, they have apple torts and chocolate cakes and souffles, really there is something for everyone. 

I thoroughly enjoyed my experience at Edwins and it appeared the other 16 guests at my cozy table by the fireplace enjoyed their experience as well. Sure it's pricey, but so worth it, plus you're helping out a wonderful cause so don't act like you can't save up and splurge once in a while (start practicing your \"Oh la la's\"!). I will definitely come back here and I encourage everyone to make the trip and give them a try! (Oh and free valet parking!)"}
{"text":"I love the whole concept of this restaurant, and I wanted to be sure to support what a great thing they are doing for the community.  

We started with the cheese appetizer, and they brought a cart to the table filled with the most decadent selection of cheeses I've ever seen.  We probably could have stopped there, but then we had an awesome pasta dish with seafood sausage, and finished our meal with a lovely fruit sorbet. Everything was delicious.

The service was also outstanding-- almost too good, if that's possible.  Someone was around to check on us pretty consistently throughout every course of the entire meal.  And they will really not let you have an empty bread plate or water glass.  I would highly recommend and hope to visit again in the future."}
{"text":"Service superb! Food was amazing and the staff was awesome! Be careful of parking. But other than that, I had no wait! Saw some awesome service to everyone!"}
{"text":"Came here while visiting my family from Los Angeles. So it was a special occasion. Edwin's did not disappoint. It's a lovely establishment with attentive and polite staff who see that you are well taken care of. The food was excellent. I had the grouper. Everyone enjoyed their food. Michael, our server did a great job."}
{"text":"We had the most amazing experience. From appetizer to creme brûlée for dessert - wow. And the service was excellent too. Can't wait to come back and get another table side made burger!"}
{"text":"The braised oxtail dish was absolutely fantastic. One of the best dishes we have had at a restaurant in awhile. The cheese cart cheeses were very good and reasonably priced. Also had the strip steak which was very good. Service was amazing. Also we loved the funk music being played at the restaurant! Great atmosphere. We had an amazing experience."}
{"text":"EDWINS for the WIN!!
Oh man, this was by far the most incredible meal we've experienced in a long while. Don't get me wring, we like to eat out, but we usually don't splurge the way we did tonight at Edwins.
Happy Valentine's day to us. First, the complimentary valet parking is definitely awesome, especially in the square. Thanks for that!
We walked in and we're greeted immediately, we were then taken to our table. The Hostess was polite and after she left the menus, there was another hostess to deliver bread and water. Our server was Karl, he was so sweet. You could tell he was new, he was nervous. 
He took our drink order and left us to look over the menu. 
We ordered the Foie Gras and the frog legs to start. 
Let me tell you about the Foie gras. It's a little piece of heaven. The poached grapes with the plum & Arnangac sauce were incredible! Add the Foie gras with the grapes and sauce together? Holy shit!! Our hostess saw the pure joy on my face and asked if I wanted some bread to soak up the rest of the sauce and juices. Uhh, yes!!
The frog legs were very tasty, they had that delicious fishy flavor that wasn't over powering. The meat was tender and literally fell off the bone. 
Our main dishes were the Venison and Guinea Hen.
The Venison came out medium rare. Now, I've been eating venison my entire life and I've never had it this perfect. It literally melted in your mouth. It had the gamey, wild flavor that makes the meat so good. 
The Guinea Hen was pretty awesome. I've never had it before so I wanted to try something different. The potatoes, Brussels, mushroom gravy and the Hen. We're divine! The combination of flavors just exploded in my mouth. It was tender and literally the juiciest bird I've ever had. 
Moving on to desserts! 
We ordered 2. The chocolate pyramid and the banana fosters. Plus some coffee. 
First, watching the banana fosters being made table side was such an awesome treat. Not to mention, it tasted INCREDIBLE!  All of the flavors mixed well and the homemade ice cream was spectacular. 
The chocolate pyramid was small. I looked at it and was like, I could eat that in one bite. Until I took a bite. Super rich, like SUPER rich. But, extremely delicious. It's served with strawberries and orange strings. The mixture works perfect together. The fruit brings down the richness. The coffee was so good too!
It was an incredible experience, we got to meet the owner. I love the work that he does. 
I can't wait to come back. 
I often tell people to try new things. Edwins would be the best place to try those new things."}
{"text":"OMG, food amazing but it's the service and the purpose behind the restaurant,  why it's here and what it does that makes this place a truly special and wonderful dining experience."}
{"text":"We had a fantastic experience here. Brenda took care of us and was so nice and so attentive. The food was also incredible. 10/10 will be back!!!"}
{"text":"Edwin's is a wonderful addition to the Shaker Square area! Took my parents for their birthday on Thursday and very glad we did, this place is superb in its service, decor, atmosphere, and of course the food!

Service was impeccable from beginning to end; never had to ask for anything, everything was anticipated and right on time. 

Food was amaaazzzing! Grilled seafood sausage was smooth and not grainy, had a light, and non-fishy taste, very good. The foie gras and escargot; BEST foie gras ever and I have eaten my share; well seasoned, texture was smooth and the taste was beyond buttery (I think I did a little dance in my seat with every bite:). The brioche in pear compote and plum and Armagnac sauce with grapes was an excellent pairing. The portion was very generous. The escargot was tasty, but just a tad overcooked and needed a bit more garlic with a pinch of sea salt. 

The guinea hen was delectable; well seasoned, tender, and not too gamey. The braised beef shin was meaty and practically melted in your mouth. 

Great wine list. Also, got to talking with the manager and found out that not only will Edwin's be opening a cook library, but a learning institute as well as butcher's shop on Buckeye - right up the street - that will sell every single part of the meat- people will even be able to take classes. Very excited to return home and visit again!!!"}
{"text":"Okay it truly saddens me to have to break this restaurants strong 5 star rating, but I have to be honest in my review and unfortunately the food was not good at all.

First, let me begin with the things that we truly enjoyed about Edwin's. The concept of the restaurant and its Mission Statement is truly heartwarming and it is a cause that is certainly worth supporting. The staff is attentive and warm and genuinely care about their respective roles within this fin dining establishment. The ambience is cozy and warmly inviting and the valet is a nice touch which we appreciated on a snowy January night when we visited the restaurant. These points raised the review from a 2 to a 3 star experience.

Unfortunately, if I were reviewing only the food, I would have to give it two stars. We came into Edwin's expecting something along the lines of the cuisine we experienced at L'albatros. However, this wasn't the case. My chicken dish was inedible as the potatoes weren't cooked and the chicken itself lacked any spice or depth to flavor it in a memorable way. I never leave my plate untouched at a restaurant, but that ended up being the case that night. My husband's duck confit was a little better, but the duck was definitely over cooked and the accompanying risotto was also undercooked and each grain of rice had a hard center. The cheese assortment was nice, but it couldn't redeem the meal's major shortcomings when it came to food quality, preparation, and flavor."}
{"text":"I was surprised by my special guy for my birthday when he took me to Edwin's yesterday!  I was very impressed!! I dine out a lot at some of the most upscale restaurants, but I was blown away!! Right there nestled on the corner of Shaker Square was the most quaint and lovely dinning experience awaiting anyone with a delectable palate!! The food was delicious and the atmosphere was absolutely romantic! It was my first time ever trying escargot that was brought to the table as a complimentary appetizer, and later found out the proprietor gave us our celebratory meal on the house!!!  WOW!! Not to mention the excellent and friendly service. And the CHEESES!! I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone who would desire a one-of-a-kind dining experience they will never forget!!!"}
{"text":"Edwins is an outstanding restaurant. Everything is five star from the service, and decor to the cuisine. Edwins features a french inspired menu.  They also have vegan options. Our server, Jason did a fantastic job. He was attentive and knowledgable about the menu. Jason made great recommendations too. At no time were our glasses less than full or our table without bread.  Edwins is located in picturesque Shaker Square so there are shops and things to do after your meal. Valet parking available."}
{"text":"Edwins is a newcomer to a great spot for fine dining, a very cozy, beautiful dining space with a fireplace, just across from the Shaker Square rapid station on the Green and Blue lines.

The decor and theme is in the \"relaxed fine dining\" pattern, a good blend of classic and informal touches.  There were a few bumps in the service, but nothing that marred the experience, and nothing that seemed out of place less than a month after opening.  The staff are all friendly, attentive, and focused.  They serve very good bread from On The Rise bakery, and refilled the bread plate with such enthusiasm that it was hard to avoid exhausting my appetite before the actual meal.  (Better to request that they remove the plate than to simply decline another piece, if you've had enough bread.)

I didn't examine their beer or wine lists in detail, but their cocktail list focuses on classic cocktails that fit well with the French cuisine.  I had the \"Automne En Champagne\", a variant on the Champagne Cocktail with walnut bitters.  A delicious choice on a cold autumn night.

I had a salmon dish with cucumber and horseradish, very rich and delicious, though perhaps a bit too heavy on the salt.  My wife had the Portabella Napoleon, a delicious layered vegetable dish with a very striking presentation.

We didn't order from their selection of cheeses, but observed that being served at another table.  The cheese display, wheeled into the dining room on a large cart, is quite a sight.  It seems that element has received a lot of attention.

We were too full for dessert, but the coffee was excellent.

It seems that they seek contributions to the nonprofit institution in lieu of tips.  (At least, a line for contributions replaces the usual line for tips on the bill.) 

I approve of the Edwins Institute mission, and the restaurant is a welcome and excellent addition to the Shaker Square fine dining scene."}
{"text":"We had a great experience here for dinner. The wait staff was attentive and the food was delicious! We had multiple things off the menu - the scallops were definitely the highlight of our meal. The burger that was prepared table side made for a great pre-dinner show with fire and the works! It was raining the day that we were there and the restaurant even sent us an umbrella since we could not find ours when we left. 5 stars for great service, great food, and great staff! Make reservations if you don't want to wait in a long line since this restaurant is so popular!"}
{"text":"What an absolutely wonderful place, filled with wonderful people and wonderful food.

I came with a large group for our supper club, and was so impressed with EDWINS ability to manage 20 of us with 20 different checks. We sat at one long table nestled in the back of the restaurant, a somewhat semi-private area. I should also mention- once the sun sets, the ambience is gorgeous here. Very romantic. It's a shame we weren't on a date. (Ha!)

Any restaurant that doubles as a nonprofit wins major points in my book. EDWINS provides workforce training while simultaneously serving delicious French food. Fun facts: your tip is tax deductible and EDWINS is short for Education Wins. EDWINS clearly has special roots in the community to provide meaningful job opportunities by means of an impressive culinary credential.

The menu is extremely French (we loved laughing at my poor reading of the language), gloriously overwhelming and filled with plentiful options. For dinner, I had the lobster bisque and the scallops. The bisque was rich and flavorful, presented with a beautiful \"E\" on the surface. The scallops were huge, tender and juicy. Once the juice seeped onto the potatoes, it was pretty heavenly. I savored every bite.

EDWINS is a very special place. I will absolutely be back."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. The food is delicious, the service is wonderful, and the atmosphere is swanky. I didn't give it five stars because it was really dark and loud, but it's such a small intimate space and I'm not sure how they could improve the darkness without making it less \"swanky\". Go! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This restaurant and the staff were very accommodating to me and my now fiancée when I decided to propose at this exquisite restaurant. The management team at EDWINS went over and beyond to make my proposal very memorable, they even staged the whole thing and were ready with cameras ready to catch each and every moment of my proposal. The food itself was amazing, my fiancée and I started out with oysters which had a side of onions and tomatoes in what I think was some sort of vinaigrette, which complimented the oysters very well. For our main entrees my fiancée ordered the duck breast with wild rice which was delicious with a honey glaze flavor to it. I personally ordered the beef coulette steak medium rare which had goose fried potatoes and asparagus which were out of this world. The flavors in both our entrees were very good and I was very pleased. For desert to end the magical evening we shared the chocolate pyramid which had strawberries, this treat had decadent chocolate and was very delicious. The service at EDWINS was amazing and the staff really made the evening perfect. The mission of the restaurant is truly a very beautiful thing and I look forward to coming back."}
{"text":"This was a wonderful experience. Not only were my wife, colleague, and I impressed with the food, but the social action being taken by giving formerly-incarcerated persons a chance to learn the business was inspiring. The food was delicious and the experience was unique (I've never had a burger ground and cooked in front of me before). It was great to hear about the employees' backgrounds as well. I wish this would be done in more restaurants!"}
{"text":"Great concept and really good food. Had the duck dish it was delightful."}
{"text":"READ ABOUT WHAT THIS PLACE IS BEFORE GOING.  Yes it is fully staffed by formerly incarcerated adults training for careers in the hospitality industry.  Don't expect picture perfect and polished servers.  But knowing this while going there makes it all the more enjoyable.  

The food was absolutely fantastic.  I got the Horseradish encrusted salmon with cucumbers & cream. Looking forward to going again and trying something else although I'd definitely get that again.

Ambiance of the place was great, small and intimate.  The founder, Brandon Chrostowski, was there, welcomed us immediately and was helping to bus tables and actively coaching everyone during dinner service.  Can't wait to go again!"}
{"text":"My wife and I enjoyed a wonderful dining experience at Edwin's on a crisp fall Friday evening.  First of all, the ambiance is SPOT ON - perfect lighting, candles, fireplace, white table clothes and so on.  Secondly, the service is AS GOOD AS IT GETS - formal but not stodgy, friendly, attentive and the bread service is constant!  We shared the beet and goat cheese salad and we had the Horseradish encrusted salmon and duck terrine for entrees.  We shared a bottle of wine and finished our meal with an amazing pumpkin bread pudding.  

This is a great spot for a special date.  

Loved Loved LOVED it!"}
{"text":"All three of us were 100% full, satisfied, and blown away by the quality of the service, ambiance, and food. 

The staff: check out the website. this is so much more than your typical restaurant. Their institute is, or nearly is, one of a kind. EVERYONE was friendly, prompt, and knowledgeable. 

The food: The cocktail list had a wide variety and their wine closet was quite robust (pretty to look at too). I had the apple bourbon - appropriate for the season. Rather than choose one item, we decided to share several smaller dishes like tapas. Many fancy-shmancy places discourage this, but our server was perfectly accommodating and even asked if we had a preference for the order of the dishes. We ended up trying three dishes that we'd never had: escargot, oysters, and frog legs - go big or go home, right? All three were divine!! Granted enough butter and garlic can make anything tasty, but this was so much more. It was simple yet delicious, light yet filling, new but still had an aire of comfort food. We also had soup, salad, and shared two desserts - one of which (banana foster) was cooked tableside for an added pzazz.

The price: It isn't cheap or even a regular date night stop. It's a fancy, we are celebrating something important, kind of place. But entire check is tax-deductible - check out the website to learn about the institute. We got to eat amazing food that I could never in 1million years cook, and help our local community, yup! I'm all in and will go back for our next celebration."}
{"text":"Excellent. Been wanting to come to Edwin's for a while now and kept reading the rave reviews, I'm almost upset it took me so long to get here. The staff was so friendly and knowledgeable. Great variety on the menu as well as drink and wine selection. Our table ordered for appetizers: lobster bisque, soup of the day which was a carrot soup, salad special and escargot. Everything was perfect- portion, taste and quality. For entrees: venison, paparadelle pasta, duck confit and fish special were excellent. I ordered the duck confit that was served over mushroom risotto. Everything I hoped it would be. Cooked perfect and the skin was exceptionally good. For desert we had the creme brûlée which was good, nothing over the top. They do have three flavors of soufflés which I will probably order on my next visit. I will definitely be returning to Edwin's and raving about my experience to all my friends."}
{"text":"When I heard that this was a training institute I was a little skeptical. Thankfully I was completely blown away with the professionalism and level of service here. Everyone was helpful without being overbearing, and the food was incredible. I tried the tartare and was impressed. Both dishes were great and our dessert was a soufflé that was to die for! I can't wait to get back here."}
{"text":"So much fun eating here! The service was up there with the best. Waiters and staff were always making sure we had enough water and wine in our glasses, bread (if we wanted it), and made sure the food was what we expected.  

I had the lobster bisque which ACTUALLY tasted like and had real lobster meat in it!  I also ordered the Filet Oscar which was unfortunately slightly over cooked (I ordered medium-rare, it came out closer to medium). However, it was seasoned perfectly.  The asparagus, potatoes, and bearnaise sauce were flavorful and a great addition to the filet.  

For dessert, we ordered both a chocolate and orange liqueur soufflé--- THE BOMB!!!

This place is a must."}
{"text":"Too many things to rave about. Service, food, atmosphere, drinks and mission are all 5+ stars. 
This was one of the most incredible dining experiences I've had. They cook several things table side which is rare. Nothing is boring and every dish my husband and I shared was divine.

We split a bottle of Bordeaux red wine and started with the rabbit mushroom pastry and several cheeses (fomage) that you get to select table side. 

I had the grouper which is unequal to Any fish I've had and was a great choice! My husband had the pheasant wild game and loved his too. We ended with bananas foster dessert that they cooked by our table. All the servers were helpful and charismatic. 

The atmosphere can be upscale or a little more relaxed with the upbeat music. 

We had reservations too! 
This is one of my top 5 dinner experiences ever."}
{"text":"Setting aside the cool concept and great cause that this place represents, Edwins is just a really good dining experience. Very traditional French food (complemented by a bevy of nice vegetarian and vegan options) in a cozy atmosphere with very attentive service. Our table of three all had appetizers, mains and dessert. My only quibble with the food is that I like my escargot hotter, in shells and swimming in more herb butter. The service was great, but like many American restaurants, they pester diners for plates while others at the table are still eating -- I wish they'd be even more French when it came to that. All in all, this is a fantastic place, and I'm eager to sample more of the menu."}
{"text":"An incredible restaurant with an even better mission! The service was impeccable, all employees knowledgeable, kind, and thorough. 

I had the goat cheese salad with poached pears, then my friend and I shared three appetizers: rabbit pie, pate, and sweetbreads. The sweetbreads were by far the highlight of the meal, the most delicious I've ever had! After that we had a cheese plate. Their cheese selection is great, and the servers know quite a bit about each cheese. We had three desserts: the bananas foster, chocolate bomb, and creme brûlée. The bananas foster is prepared in front of you by a chef, it was an amazing experience! 

All in all, I can't wait to go back to Edwins. It's a fantastic restaurant with an eclectic mix of meal choices, and each one is sure to be better than the last!"}
{"text":"5 stars for the mission. 

4 stars for service. You can tell that they are training the students well but that they are learning. 

5 stars for ambience. It's a dark room with high ceilings. The tables are very close but I don't mind. But some people might especially since they have banana foster and cheese tables walking through the aisles. 

3 stars for the food. I had the lobster bisque. It was very fishy and salty. I couldn't even finish my half of it. I ordered the scallops sauteed in duck fat. It was good at first but also got too salty by the end. The potatoes helped balance some of that out. My boyfriend had the braised rabbit with sweet potatoes which was better but not amazing to me. Maybe other dishes are better. The Grand Marnier souffle redeemed my meal. It was definitely worth it. It does take 25 minutes so plan ahead.

4 for the drinks. Parisian mule was great, French 75 was fine. I like my gin and champagne equal. I could taste more gin."}
{"text":"What a great dining experience! Food, service and ambiance. Highly recommended for any special occasion or for business but probably not appropriate for children under 8"}
{"text":"OMG The Vegan meal Mushroom Napoleon was delicious!! The vegetables were so fresh!! The grouper dish was truly amazing!! It was flavorful and moist.  The servers were Friendly, Prompt and very knowledgeable about the menu!!"}
{"text":"Impeccable service, cheese service, menu has great variety of choices. I found it very hard to decide. The dessert, a soufflé, was like a mouthful of heaven."}
{"text":"We went here after seeing the movie \"Knife Skills\" at the TCFF. There were 6 of us celebrating 2 birthdays. Possibly the best meal (service and food) I have enjoyed in years. We would all return in an instant."}
{"text":"Four of us had a dining experience last night that was nothing less than dazzling. The rabbit pie was devoured by the world's pickiest eater who only stopped when the last morsel was gone. An artichoke appetizer and the salmon were perfect, as was a filet -- actually cooked medium rare as requested. The soup du jour, a chilled tomato/basil garnished with a hard cheese (parmesan? not sure) was creamy and flavorful. But the most surprising dish -- and the one that veered farthest from the industrial French sensibility -- was the tableside burger -- it was so interesting to watch the prep process and to learn the intricacies of the sauce Dianne that accompanied it. And the finished product redefined the concept of hamburger. Our only complaint was that the burger was too large and we were left with the enviable choice of finishing the burger or enjoying a Grand Marnier souffle. A terrible dilemma to be sure! Our server, Kyle, was attentive and responsive to our questions. We were interested in and elicited his personal story and it only strengthened our resolve to leave a generous gratuity (which is another way of talking about the donation to the Leadership Institute). The greatest compliment, though, was from our guests from NYC. Serious foodies, they had dined only a week earlier at the French restaurant at CIA in Hyde Park, NY. Their assessment: the meal at EDWINS knocked the socks off of the CIA. You can't really say anything more."}
{"text":"The food was good but over-priced. My husband got their filet mignon, and he asked for it to be well done, however, it came out medium. I had the grouper wrapped in potatoes, which was okay. Our favorites were the lobster bisque, cream burlee and soufflé."}
{"text":"Let's start by trying for a moment to ignore the fact that it is a noble and righteous cause they are undertaking. Let's focus simply on their food for a moment. In a city with fantastic restaurants on every corner, it is difficult to stand out. Well Edwins stands out. Everything was fabulous! The rabbit pie appetizer was one of the best dishes I've had in quite a while. Scallops were perfectly seasoned and melted in your mouth! The soufflé!!! I could've eaten the whole thing.
Now let's circle back to the rest. Not only is the food phenomenal...it is a non profit. They hire and train former felons and help reintegrate them into society. By supporting this business not only will you have a fantastic meal, but you will be helping people get a second chance. The service was terrific and you can feel the gratitude of the employees. You MUST eat here!"}
{"text":"I have to say that I have not experienced The Leadership Restaurant. I seen Brandon Chrostowski on Steve Harvey Show & Commented , was so Grateful that Brandon was so kind to respond promptly gave me information for my grandson . Feel Blessed for Brandon's kindness, Hopeful that my grandson will take the opportunity Brandon has offered. I will plan a visit to the Restaurant soon & will give a review"}
{"text":"We happened upon this place by chance; as we were parking some of the chefs were out back and said hello.  We were headed to the Hungarian place...but we decided to try this place, instead, after speaking with the staff and seeing the menu displayed.  The menu was impressive, and I've been on the hunt for a GOOD French restaurant.  
The interior is lovely.  It's painted a sophisticated dark gray. Were were greeted immediately, and checked out coats.  The bar was beautiful, the art tasteful and expertly arranged, and the fireplace was ablaze and provided a cosy atmosphere.
Our server was wonderful.  We ordered a bottle of Malbec and decided on the escargot appetizer.  It was very delicious. Then, we each selected our plat principaux; for me, a filet mignon atop a croûton, spinach, with a delicious sauce, topped with foie gras; for him, duck in a creamy risotto.  
I cannot accurately describe how wonderful both dishes were, because I am not a poet.  Both dishes were delectable, however, one bite of the duck and I decided if I died at that very moment, I would die happy.  It was that good. The risotto was rich.  I have no idea how that much flavor was packed into that dish, but, wow.  My steak was huge, cooked perfectly and tasty, but I'm telling you, try the duck.
We finished with coffee, chocolate soufflé with cream, and a French Coffee (with liquor).  
This culinary school not only helps people with its mission; it truly offers some of the best French food I have ever eaten.  We will definitely be back.  This place is reasonably priced and the perfect place for a date or a special night out."}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to go here, spur of the moment, for date night. We were greeted very warmly and seated at a cozy table for two. The space is lovely.  I wish we'd gotten to sit near the fireplace!  Our server was very nice and a little shy.  We ordered the \"prohibition\" gin drink and an old fashioned. Let me just say, I've had ALOT of old fashioneds and this one was the most perfect one I've ever had!  We settled on the \"game\" 5-course menu to share. The kitchen kindly split each dish into two and the portions were still adequate. The duck bratwurst was outstanding and only wish it had had more au jus.  The venison was really the star course.  It was perfectly prepared and seasoned well. I would highly recommend this spot for a special occasion or to enjoy happy hour. I should note that the concept of this restaurant was the real draw and I will definitely be back to support it."}
{"text":"My husband and I went for Valentine's Day and I was so impressed! They started off with checking our coats in which was lovely and then we were sat by the fireplace that was both romantic and quiet. Each meal was prepared and presented beautifully. Every dish tasted wonderful. The service was beyond fantastic!! I cannot wait for another occasion to go back."}
{"text":"We visited Edwins last evening and had a spectacular time.  Quite simply - it is by far the best restaurant in Shaker Square (and there are a few very nice spots) but the place also serves a great mission.  (it's been discussed many times so I won't get back into it).  But the food, the service, the surroundings, the owner and the entire team were all top notch.  This place is a MUST GO and is now our fine dining, stop in for a nice cocktail or after movie desert place."}
{"text":"I enjoy and applaud the concept of this venue. 

There is a similar restaurant in San Francisco called Delancey's that I really enjoy. 

Here at Edwin's I went with 

Paupiettes de merou (Translation) Grouper wrapped in crispy potatoes with haricot verts & beurre rouge $29 

I enjoyed this dish and thought it was very tasty, flavorful, and different. 

One recommendation to the owners/staff would be with this dish would be to provide a sharper knife. It was hard to cut through the outer layer of potatoes with the standard knife provided. The fish would pop out of the encasing and was a bit frustrating. 

All in all a classy venue but more importantly...a great cause. Would return to this venue for sure."}
{"text":"Great concept restaurant. Everyone here received a degree in \"culinary arts\" while incarcerated. Then a job upon release. An amazing menu. Had trouble deciding  between frogs legs/rabbit in puff pastry or fois gras as my starter. Entree is between potato crusted grouper or the wild game dish (Scottish partridge with a warning the buckshot might be present ). An amazing wine selection with great prices. I chose the legs and partridge. Excellent!! Service impeccable!!!"}
{"text":"\"Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day. Teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime.\"

I cannot even begin to describe what an outstanding experience we had at Edwin's last night! Everything was absolutely exceptional.

To start, I am a huge supporter of programs designed to educate previously incarcerated people with the goal of providing tools to re-enter society successfully and stay away from the lifestyle/circumstances that got them into jail in the first place (for example, Homeboy Industries in Los Angeles). Given that, I was thrilled to learn about Edwin's mission and made reservations immediately!

When we arrived, we were greeted warmly at the desk, and were escorted through the chic, cozy, and comfortable dining room to our corner table. The decor is beautiful-modern and formal, yet very warm and welcoming with a fireplace in the corner! 

Our server, Herman, was an absolute dream. He was extremely attentive and genuinely caring, without ever making us feel rushed. He was friendly and kind, and an absolute pleasure to be around. He knew nearly every answer to our questions about the menu, and immediately sought answers from a wine expert when we had a detailed question about their featured wine. The rest of the staff (people serving bread, water, food, greeters) were exactly as you'd want-never letting a glass empty, but never swarming. It was obvious that every staff member was truly happy to be there. 

As for the food, it was divine. We started with the warm goat cheese salad, which they were kind enough to split in two. My mom had the mélange de champignons (a vegetarian dish) which was a wonderfully flavorful medley of mushroom, red pepper, zucchini and other vegetables. Definitely not your traditional vegetarian dish, it was much, much better. I had the filet mignon with foie gras, which was heavenly. The meat was so tender it would have cut with a butter knife, and was complimented perfectly by the smoky foie gras. It was one of the best steaks I've ever had (which is saying a lot!). We had the Grand Marnier soufflé for dessert which was perfectly crisped on the outside and light and fluffy inside. For wine we went ahead with the featured Joseph Drouhin Beaujolais Nouveaux as a winter celebration, which was light, dry, and fruity (perfectly described by Herman) and terribly reasonably priced! It was very different, but delicious to try! Our pre-dinner cocktails (the aviation and maple vieux) were outstanding. 

Overall, this was the best restaurant I have been to in Cleveland thus far in my 5 months here (after moving from Los Angeles). The experience was phenomenal. The people were delightful, the service was impeccable, the food was creative and flawless, and of course, the mission is just wonderful.

I am grateful that people like Brandon (the owner) exist and are coming up with creative ideas to make the world a better place. As a city, we should make a point to support Edwin's mission. I will be back regularly and donate as well!"}
{"text":"Had dinner at Edwin's and it was pretty tasty! The entire concept is awesome, especially when you realize that unless otherwise told you'd never know the history of the staff. They are top notch and first class. There was an impressive wine list. My hubby started with the rabbit pie and enjoyed it. He had the steak at poivre and thought this steak was cooked well."}
{"text":"Impressed, definitely impressed by Edwins.

I stopped here tonight with some girlfriends. It's where the old wine bar used to be- but now it's a nice food establishment. I especially like the mission of this restaurant, helping out the community (see their website for the mission).   So, my girlfriends and I stopped in tonight to grab a yummy meal.

We were greeted right away and ushered to our seat. The service was great- our waiters checked on us constantly, as well as others, to fill our bread plate, our water glasses, or simply to tell us our food was coming. Nice, very nice, I thought- I wish all restaurants were this considerate.

I ordered the \"les russe\" (spelling?) drink- a cucumber infused drink. That was definitely tasty- I liked how they had lots of choices in that arena.

For my entree, I ordered the \"Paupiettes de poisson du jour\"- halibut wrapped in a potato skin (think crispy) in an amazing sauce- \" beurre rouge \". Oh wow, it was good! The fish was moist, it was just the right size, and the flavors were great. Usually, I would complain about the sodium level, but at Edwins- it was just right- not too salty! I was happy about this, for sure. My girlfriends ordered the \"Coquilles au gras de canard, avec tomates, basilic et pommes duchesse\"- delicious scallops, and \"Tournedos de saumon gratiné au raifort et sa sauce aux concombres et crème fraîche\"- a moist salmon in a horseradish creamy sauce. Overall, our entrees were excellent.

We ordered the dessert- the flourless chocolate cake and the Grand Marnier souffle. The cake was okay- I thought it tasted a bit burnt on the edges though. I had read the reviews about the souffle and decided to try it- it was a tad too sweet for me. Definitely good (very egg-y), but a tad too sweet for me. 

What astounded me was when we got the bill, it stated that the Edwin's had a 501c3 status! WHAT?! I exclaimed! Being personally a head of a non-profit in the city of Cleveland, I was encouraged by Edwins support to the community.  It made me respect Edwins even more for their purpose and mission of their restaurant- all the while, providing a delicious fancy meal.  

But overall, Bravo, Edwins, Bravo. *clap clap* I highly respect you, loved your food, and will be back to you soon to support your mission to help those get back on their feet in the city of Cleveland."}
{"text":"Literally, the last thing we ate in Cleveland before heading out to scary scary New York City. o___O

Went here for dessert with fiance and a friend. I have been dying to try this place since I heard about the unique concept behind this restaurant. Sadly, didn't make it to happy hour, but did try 3 desserts + cappuccino + latte here (total of around $50):
1) Grand Marnier Souffle
2) Lavender bread pudding
3) Banana foster

I loved the experience. It is such a quaint place; you feel transported out of Cleveland for the while that you are there. The waiters, host, everyone there is so humble, polite, and this makes the ambiance just so so amazing. 

Wish I had tried the food as well; the plates that I saw other people sure did look appetizing, but we were full from pho. The desserts themselves are great in concept, but I'm not the greatest fan. The grand marnier souffle is bubbly, soft, reminds me of a Chinese sponge cake, very light in flavor. We all loved the ice cream that came on top of it, very very fresh. The lavender bread pudding was my least favorite - just didn't quite mesh as well. The banana foster performance was very fun to watch; we watched it twice since the table next to us also ordered it. However, we didn't get the orange/lemon zest that the table next to us did (also 1 less scoop of ice cream!). I think our chef was just starting, whereas their chef was more experienced since we did see someone instructing our chef on what to do. Nonetheless, fun experience to top off a great 6 years in Cleveland. I will miss you!"}
{"text":"Just absolutely my favorite restaurant in Cleveland, and I have tried all the best. The best thing about it is how special they make you feel. From bringing out escargot on the house, just because. To preparing for you a personal cocktail because you want something with red wine and nothing is on the list. To finding for you the closest thing to whole grain - the bread from the cheese cart. This place is awesome!"}
{"text":"While visiting Cleveland I happened upon Edwins on a rainy Monday night and was pleasantly surprised with a lovely experience. The decor is elegant and warm, could have been right off the streets of Paris. Staff friendly and attentive but, let's get to the food. Delicious , well prepared and beautiful presentation. After seeing the bananas foster cart pass by we decided to split 3 courses to save room for dessert. The braised artichoke was a delicious start, light and seasoned with fresh herbs. Next, the fresh field green salad with poached pears and goat cheese and a yummy entree of salmon. We loved that the kitchen split the dishes themselves so we could each enjoy a beautiful plated presentation. Finally, the bananas foster cart, an old fashioned but most welcome treat. Prepared tableside and served with homemade ice cream, this was worth every calorie. Bravo!!!"}
{"text":"This was a great place. My wife and I went dinner New Year's Eve 2014 and it was fantastic.  Education Wins (Edwin's). Everyone there was helpful and the food was off the chart good. Recommend anything on menu. What a great mission too."}
{"text":"Obviously what they are doing here is fantastic and I was impressed on so many levels from the food, service, atmosphere, etc.  

Met a couple of friends for happy hour before going to a concert in the area.  Now I'm definitely a cheese snob.  Most finer restaurants serve cheese/charcuterie plates I'm underwhelmed by.  Usually because I can buy and find most of the cheeses myself at a higher end grocery or specialty foods store.  This is one of better cheese plates/carts I've seen anywhere.  They had one particular soft goat cheese from Sardinia I believe topped with truffles which was freaking gangster! 

The soup was excellent.  I forgot to take a pic but it was a pureed eggplant/tomato/roasted red pepper.  The braised artichokes were fantastic.  House martini made with Tito's and a really good French sauv blanc (both $7) were the choices and prices on the happy hour menu.  

I definitely will be back!  Wasn't very busy at 6 on a Tues at the bar which is what I may shoot for again!"}
{"text":"I went there on a saturday evening, we are confused about the complimentary valet parking. When we call to ask about it, the lady was kind of rude. We order escargo for appetizer, it was awsome. Then we order beef oxtail papardeli and duck confit with risotto. Both of them are OK, but not great. They were sooooo salty. Also the oxtail papardeli, we dont think it was actually oxtail meat, it taste like a regular beef meat. Then we ask for the souffle for dessert, we thought the souffle will be a cake, however they modified it  to be like a Meringue, baked egg white. Real disappointment.. =(, the waiter did not even tell  us about the modified souffle, really not worth the $12....
in general not a great experience  ~~. Overall our review was 2.5 because of the price and the actual food that im getting."}
{"text":"We left impressed and full at the same time. I was amazed with how huge my serving was (duck). My husband ordered the lamb chops, and it was delightful, flavorful (the flavor was infused in the meat), and cooked perfectly. To add to the experience, we were taken aback ( in a good way) when we noticed that the \"tip\" was considered as a tax-deductible since this is a non-profit orgnization. We will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday night without a reservation.  Were very well taken care of by a sweet hostess, who saved us from a horrible table right behind a dishwashers pit - noisy, endless traffic, space filled with rushing servers and tableside prep carts, etc.  That table should not be offered to guests, unless for 50% discount.
Really liked the atmosphere and attentive service and, obviously, very impressed with the whole concept for this restaurant.  As far as food goes, it was just OK.  I had the 3 for $33 meal, consisting of a small salad, Lamb Chops with eggplant caponata and Crème Brule for desert.  Lamb and eggplant were delicious and very generous, salad was underdressed and had little flavor, but fresh, desert was really, really rich - had 2 spoonfulls and was feeling nauseous. But the real disappointment was the Portobello Mushroom Napoleon ;(.  
The Mushrooms were flavorful, but the huge slices of yellow squash and zucchini were almost raw and completely tasteless, the Red Pepper coulis added nothing to the dish and tasted like strange ketchup. 
But the biggest damper on our dining experience was the blaring screaming music!  The choice of the genre of music is totally incongruent with the restaurant's theme and most clientele.  It's an upscale French cuisine!  Why would you choose hard rock, or, if lucky, Motown top 100???  Very strange and making conversation impossible."}
{"text":"Came with a friend on a Friday night in January but I only recently signed up with Yelp so I can't remember the names of the dishes. We at at the bar before being sat. Once sat, we each had salads as starters. Mine had goat cheese on it. I usually don't eat my entire salad because I don't want to ruin my appetite, but I ate the whole thing! I then had the pasta with different mushrooms in a cream sauce. Our waiter George (who was super sweet!) talked me into it and I had ZERO regrets. I can't recall what my friend got but I do remember that he kept taking bites off my plate (who does that?!) For dessert we had a crème brûlée and the chocolate soufflé. Both were out of this world. Even after dinner I didn't want to leave so we went back to the bar for a nightcap. From beginning to end I was impressed by the work ethic of the staff there, from George to Lamont and everyone in between. If you go, you'll find out about Edwin's. If you don't go, you're missing out!!"}
{"text":"A fantastic experience is all aspects.   We were not sure what to expect, as we knew the staff were all ex-cons, however we could not have been more pleasantly surprised.  The wait staff was certainly not the polished staff of other places, but they were VERY friendly, and aimed to please.   

The biggest treat was the food.  One of the best French meals I have had in a long time.  We had the escargot appetizer, and the main courses were grouper and scallop.  Both were to die for.  Finished a bananas foster served tablesize.

Atmosphere was very nice, and drink menu also extremely creative.   I would highly recommend Edwn's to anyone, and we look forward to returning."}
{"text":"I was impressed with my entree and pleased with dessert. The servers were all friendly, though a few minor points of the service were not ideal and made the night have a few comical moments.  

I started with an endive salad with poached pears and according to the menu: bacon, mushrooms, shaved Parmesan & apple cider vinaigrette. While that description sounds great to me, the salad was underwhelming and dry. All I saw on the plate was endive, a small portion, and about six small pear wedges.  

My entree was much better - great even. I loved the roasted venison prepared medium rare. It was served with a nice helping of both spätzle and red cabbage. The serving size was just right and it felt like a nice filling home cooked meal, perfect for a cold night.

For dessert I ordered the Bananas Foster which was prepared table side. Here ensued some of the service snafus. After struggling to light the portable stove, and releasing considerable gas into the air, and running back into the kitchen to grab a key ingredient - bananas - the preparation began. What could have been a great opportunity for the staff to shine turned a bit embarrassing as she continued to struggle, requiring several attempts to get the fire going in the pan after adding the alcohol. Preparation aside, the dessert was very good and the banana just perfectly ripened. 

I would certainly return another night to try a different menu item and perhaps an appetizer or two. Our server was friendly and so were all the assistants. I was never without bread, which was topped up countless times, one or two pieces at a time."}
{"text":"This restaurant just makes me smile from ear to ear and stomach! The service is phenomenal, the wine selection is great, and because I'm a huge cheese lover, the cheese cart is my favorite. 

The purpose of the restaurant is noble and true, and the owner is an amazing person."}
{"text":"This is a great local restaurant that everyone should try.  I am no expert on french cuisine, but it seemed very authentic.  Everything we got tasted amazing and service was extremely polite and attentive.  This place also doesn't cost anywhere near as much as other similar restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"Terrific restaurant. We loved the food, and fantastic service and atmosphere. The vegan options are surprisingly diverse and all more flavorful than we expected. Good wine list - and affordable (by restaurant wine pricing standards). Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Amazing from start to finish. We were greeted by the valet with a friendly face and greeting and it started our visit off right.  A business colleague suggested we go here and I was not disappointed. I had the fish special encrusted in potatoes and it was amazing. My colleague had the lamb ragu and said it was also fabulous. Service was excellent and I love their mission. We will be back and definitely suggesting to others!!"}
{"text":"I love this place! The food was great, the service was wonderful and attentive and its a nonprofit! Get outta town. Speaking of which, I was visiting my fam in my hometown, and my dad knows I've been on a kick of fancy French food lately, so he suggested we eat here. I had the Oysters (a special), the Foie Gras with some yummy jam (another special), the Rabbit Pie (it was a little dry but so tasty, a Parmesan crust and some prosciutto in addition to the rabbit - such a good combo!), and then finished it off with some Creme Brulee. I also had a Moscow Mule and it was  very spicy ginger and very delicious. My Dad order the table-side burger, and my dear lord, they sure do put a lot of rich ingredients into the sauce they make for the burger. They also hand crank the burger with filet mignon in front of you. The burger is super rich, I would not have been able to finish it, but my Dad enjoy it immensely. It is quite an experience. My mom add the grouper (another special) and was raving about it (I didn't taste it so I cannot confirm). I was also surprised and happy about the dishes, utensils and all of the fun little antique, heavy silver pieces we ate our meals with. What a delightful evening. They also have pressed duck on the menu, but you have to reserve that 24 hours in advanced. One day I definitely want that."}
{"text":"Met up with the other Yelpers for the supper club at Edwins.  Started off with a couple of happy hour cocktails and appetizers at the bar.  I had a great glass of wine and an artichoke appetizer and a bean dish.  The artichokes were braised in wine and butter and I really liked them.  This was the first time I have ever eaten a fresh artichoke.  Also tried a sauteed white bean dish, but that was just okay.

Once we were seated at the table we ordered lobster bisque and crab claw cocktail.  I did not care for the lobster bisque, but the crab claws were fantastic.  Great horseradish cocktail sauce was served with them.

For dinner, I got the horseradish crusted salmon dish which was very high quality fish.  Hubby ordered the braised beef and noodle entree which was very close to stroganoff.  The beef was so tender and sauce so tasty, it was a fantastic dish.

The supper club folks ordered many different entrees and all seemed to enjoy their choices.  I was lucky to be seated next to someone that ordered from the cheese cart.  I have never seen so many choices of cheese at a restaurant!  Also, a highlight was the table side prepared burger that the couple across from us ordered.  It was a cool experience to watch them grind the meat and make the very rich looking sauce. At the whopping $33 price tag, it is truly a special occasion burger.  It looked wonderful and was gone in a flash.  I heard others say that they would definitely order that again on their next visit."}
{"text":"Wonderful Valentines dinner at EDWINS!  The ambiance of this place is great - highly recommend for a date.  I think you should also understand the mission behind this place before going - it is awesome.  Is everything going to be absolutely perfect?  probably not, will they make it perfect and learn from their mistakes - YES!  Our food was great, very large portions - I knew actually would have been ok splitting an entrée.  I also didn't realize that Brandon was a master sommelier on my first visit - but from now on I will have him select all the wine I drink at EDWINS.  

I started with the Lobster bisque- it was classically prepared.  And perfect.  If you are used to lobster bisque at a chain restaurant - you won't get it.  My date got the artichoke for a starter - she asked if I would still be attracted to her if she picked up the bowl and started drinking the broth .  I said go for it!  For main courses I ordered the lamb chops and my date ordered the pappardelle with oxtail - both were heavy rich French classics.  The lamb was perfectly cooked.  The pappardelle am as rich and tasty.  Both dishes were very big - the lamb was served over a eggplant stew with tolives and other vegetables - it was very tasty. Perfect for a 5 degree February evening in Cleveland.

We ordered a chocolate soufflé for desert - it was the only let down - was wet and chunky.  They made another for us - it was a little better but not great - and I consider myself a soufflé expert.

Overall this is a great place, large portions of classic French food, great cheese, great wine, good service and a great cause.  I look forward to many great meals here and I wish all the staff the best."}
{"text":"I had requested a nice table in my reservation for a special evening with my girlfriend, and the staff at EDWINS accomodated my girlfriend and me with a private table in the lounge area right by the fire, which was a charming start to our evening. The food was excellent, and the prix fixe meal as part of Shake the Square was especially delightful!

We had the rabbit pie and the vegetable soup to start. The soup was delicious, and I really put the deliciously crusty bread to good use in sopping up the remnants! For our entrees, we had the duck confit and the short-rib choice from the prix fixe. Both were excellent; the duck fell off the bone, and the short-rib melted into its reduced sauce. For dessert, we had the fromage plate as part of the prix fixe, but were surprised when the staff also provided us with a complimentary Bananas Foster and two glasses of cognac. They made a special night even better. Will definitely return for another celebration!"}
{"text":"EDWINS to me is like experiential dining. It's definitely fancier than I usually go for, and with the added component of having servers being trained on site, there's kind of a feeling of unpredictability. To be completely clear, I see this as a positive thing. I love seeing individuals that are learning a new skill after re-entry actually on the job. Are they going to make mistakes? Likely yes, but I think this kind of adds to the experience. In a lot of ways, it makes you appreciate the whole experience a lot more. I kept reflecting back on a particular Spongebob episode where Spongebob has to \"empty his mind\" of everything except fine dining. The experiment inevitably ends up being a failure, but here at EDWINS it seems to be a success. 

All that being said, the food is absolutely phenomenal. As I mentioned, it's a little fancier than I might usually choose, but I found that our server did an amazing job of describing the dishes, and how each sauce and ingredient complimented the dish as a whole. For example, I ordered a salmon dish which was served with a cream sauce with cucumbers. I found the sauce with cucumbers to be a little odd, but the server suggested saving some of the bread to sop up the cream sauce. This ended up being a fabulous suggestion, and it just shows how the servers are not just serving you a dish, they are learning the dynamics behind French cuisine. We also ended up ordering the bananas foster which is prepared tableside, it was fun to see how difficult it can be to make this dish. The girl that was making it for us fumbled a bit, but she had a trainer there to help her through the process. I felt like I was getting a moment \"behind the scenes\". It wasn't perfect, but it was a realistic glimpse into what it might be like to have to learn a new skill such as this. 

Overall, I loved my experience at EDWINS. I found all the staff to be extraordinarily friendly in a very genuine way, and the food was definitely worth the cost. I think this is a great option for a celebratory dinner or a date, and I highly recommend for others to try."}
