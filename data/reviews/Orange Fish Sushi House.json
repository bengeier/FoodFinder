{"text":"Ordered Tempura via delivery.  After calling a few times and being told that the order was coming, it arrived finally more than 1 hour later, stone cold, damp and rubbery.  I asked for a refund and WAS YELLED AT - they said they were too busy.  Lousy food, horrid service.  I ended up giving the tempura to the dogs - hopefully they won't get sick from it.  Dreadful people"}
{"text":"Hands down the Best sushi in Mississauga! We have tried several sushi houses but no one comes close to the quality and taste provided by this little restaurant. We have been going here for several years now. It is a 15 minute drive from where we live but it helps put us in the mood for the sushi experience. The restaurant is cozy and the servers friendly. The setting is quite informal. The quality of the food is very good. We've tried other restaurants, but always return here as they're not quite orange fish. Love everything we've had here, our favorites are the sushi pizza, specialty rolls, and teriyaki dishes!"}
{"text":"I have been eating Orange Fish for years! The sashimi is always fresh, as are the rolls. My mom enjoys the tempura. Fast take-out service and clean if you are dining in."}
{"text":"Food was ok, passable. Nothing much to comment or brag about. It is slightly on the expensive side, taking the quality and varieties. This is in comparison with the several Japanese restaurants in downtown Toronto"}
{"text":"Fast service due to nobody else in the store! Alright rolls. The lady loves to fill up the green tea very full look out!"}
{"text":"Good rolls on one visit, and below average another time. Good and friendly service."}
{"text":"Unequivocally the most frustrating dining experience I have ever had.  We wanted to try and support a local business which is around the corner from our house, so we tried this place.  Although they have tables in there, it is quite obvious they are not equipped to handle dine in groups.  We debated after sitting there for 7 minutes without being approached at all if we should have bailed, and unfortunately for us we listened to our 7 year old daughter and stayed.    What a mistake.  We ordered the AYCE menu, and proceeded to order about 15 items off the menu.  After about 10 minutes we got the edamame.  The kids devoured that in 52 seconds.  Another 10 minutes later we got 2 rolls.  Another 12 minutes later we got another roll.  And finally about 15 minutes after that we got about 1/3rd of our sashimi.  After that was done, we were waiting for the rest of the food, watching the take out, JustEat.ca, and Uber Eats orders pile up, we waited patiently for the rest of our order.  After about 10 minutes the girl comes over and says, \"Oh, your order is done, did you want to order some more?\" - Really?  We ordered about 15 things and got about a 1/4 of it.  They lost the rest.  Seeing how long it was going to take and getting overly frustrated, we decided to just pay for what we ordered and leave.  One of the most expensive, annoying, and disappointing meals EVER!  The salmon sashimi was frozen.  Our 3 kids absolutely LOVE sushi, and even they were like \"Why is this frozen Daddy?\"  \"This isn't very good Daddy...can we go to Yes! Sushi?\"  So sad.  They are WAY over their heads and unfortunately they are incapable of handling the business.  We spent $70 on dinner, and had to come home and feed the kids more.  My wife ended up making ramen noodles.  Really?  I would never tell someone to not try something out.  My advice for this place?  Do NOT eat in.  Order take out and let them bring it to you.  Do not step foot in the restaurant or your blood pressure will instantly spike.  You have been warned."}
{"text":"My family and I tried out this sushi place for the first time tonight. It was the closest place to our house, so we thought we'd give it a shot. We ordered about 8 items for delivery, and after the lady on the phone bickered with her manager back and forth, she finally said that it would get to us in 1.5 hours. Their driver was \"away\", and they couldn't get us the meal any sooner. I decided to go pick up the food myself. The service was okay, the restaurant was completely empty, and there was only one person working. When I brought the food home, we noticed that the fried wings were completely burnt and dried up. No exaggeration, they were like wood chips. We called the place and told them our concern and he said he would deliver us a new order of wings, which was quite nice. However, this order was just as burnt, if not more so. The sushi was bland, the beef fried rice had no seasoning and just 3 pieces of beef. The spring rolls were the only things that we enjoyed. It's unfortunate that a sushi place in the heart of Lorne Park provides such disappointing food. Will never go back. There are so many other sushi places around that do a much better job."}
{"text":"Where do I begin? I expected something nice considering the Lorne Park area. Once we went in we were shocked to see that it looked like a takeout place, with tables that belong in an old cafeteria. The washroom, you actually have to walk through the kitchen area and then there back room.  But that's okay, we thought, damn with a place looking like this the food has to be quite good. We got the expensive $26.95 AYCE dinner.  LET ME TELL YOU. The food was disgusting! You can see clearly from our photos, but the taste is somehow worse. They don't even use Tempura batter for their tempura. It's like soggy, cheap dollarstore quality batter. Also, there portions are RIDICULOUSLY huge. The one person salad is about 8 times the size of any other AYCE sushi restaurant and fills you up before you even begin. You sometimes get 10 pieces with an order of 8 pieces. And all you can think of is their policy of \"all leftovers are charged full price\" when you are trying to stomach the disgusting excuse of sushi and rolls they present you. To top it all off, I'm 99% sure I got food poisoning from them.  WORST sushi I've ever had, and I've eaten lots of mall sushis and even Mandarin. Yuck. Don't even think about going here. Anyone who actually enjoys this has never eaten sushi, or is clinically insane. I've never left a restaurant so upset over quality before."}
{"text":"We've ordered via Uber half a dozen times over the last six weeks and almost everything was tasty to very tasty. Completely happy."}
{"text":"I can't speak for the dine-in reviews as I've only taken out at this place, but oh my goodness is it delicious. Really I don't have much to say except they definitely know how to cook their sushi, and I haven't been let down by anything I've ordered!"}
