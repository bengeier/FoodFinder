{"text":"Food was good. At first I wasnt going to try it out because of the reviews. To be honest the portions were very good, the flavour was delicious and the price is decent. I have a new favourite greek place. I bought one chicken gyros with fries.. (fries were salted perfectly). 3 souvlaki chicken dinners with 2 sides each. The rice was nice saffron rice. The lemon potatoes were super yummy. one of the entrees had mixed vegetables which she enjoyed.. In all honesty try it yourself and you be the judge. It was good food. It wasnt super amazing...but it was satisfying and exactly what I was looking for in a greek place. for all 4 dinners I payed $50 roughly. with no drinks. I only wanted the dinners. the chefs and cashier were kind. Service was good. all 4 foods took about 10minutes wait time. Wasnt too bad. I do reccomend if your hungry for greek. You can take out (which I did) or sit inside the restaurant. lots of seating."}
{"text":"I've driven past this place a few hundred times since first noticing the signage from Rutherford Rd. Our regular place was closed today, likely for the long weekend. With not much for options for Greek restaurants in the area, I thought of this place.   First off the cashier misunderstood my order, the service time was reasonable. When I got home and opened the container, first thought, the portions are small, and they didn't give us any tzatziki sauce. Ordered the chicken gyros dinner. As I mentioned already the portions were noticeably smaller than any other Greek restaurant I've been to. The chicken was dry and over cooked in spots it was even burnt.   When I saw the gyros cooking in the spit, they were definitely of the processed variety, the chicken looked OK, but if the lamb and beef were processed I'd suspect the chicken was as well.   I believe this is a chain and do things the way chain restaurants do, nothing authentic here. Don't suspect I'll be back even if our regular spot is closed again. It's definitely worth the drive to Weston and Langstaff for the authentic Greek gyros."}
