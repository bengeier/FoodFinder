{"text":"Unfortunately, the food here was not very good. They use basmati rice for the fried rice which is odd. Most dishes come with a thick cornstarch based sauce and everything was very salty. Definitely won't be returning."}
{"text":"Had lunch at Umami Hakka with a number of colleagues.  The food was  hot and delicious.  Especially loved the taste and texture of the basmati rice.  The owner/server was polite, courteous and attentive.  I order the Manchurian Chicken and found it too spicy , the owner was kind enough to replace my order with something less spicy.  Will definitely be going back there soon."}
{"text":"Very good restaurant with best price. We went with whole family and we all like food. Food was fresh, We felt we are eating in home. We definitely coming back and would recommend for family, friends and other."}
{"text":"I like the test of the food. I was with my family with my friend last summer. We really enjoy the food. Friendly environment and polite people. I love to go there again. Recommended for everyone."}
{"text":"We have tried all sorts of hakka place, and this was little different (in a good way). The did give basmati rice instead of Chinese rice, but we didn't mind it at all. 
We tried Chilli chicken and hot spicy Garlic chicken with Manchurian Hakka noodles. Noodles were really good and reminded me of Delhi's hakka food. I preferred the garlic chicken over chilli chicken but both were good. 

I would go back for sure."}
{"text":"This is really good hakka joint. The service was great and the dragon chicken that was suggested by the server was delicious. It had a nice flavour. Their hot and sour soup and general thao chicken also had good flavour. Would definitely recommend this place. We've already been back a few times!"}
{"text":"This restaurant deserves all stars possible. Best of all hakka restaurants I have been. Try their Tom Yum soup and dragon chicken, I order them everytime I go there. You wouldn't believe the portion you get for the price, it's huge! Clean and organized seats, very welcoming servers. Try it and you'd know what I mean. Great!!!"}
