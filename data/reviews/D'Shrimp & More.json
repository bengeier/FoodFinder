{"text":"D'Shrimp and more is the bomb!!! From the crispy juicy shrimp to the hand cut seasoned fries, everything was super fresh and delicious . Oh and of course they have the BPG banana pudding.....greatest lunch ever. I felt like I was back home in Detroit rolling down Jefferson. Annnnd they have Faygo y'all!!!  Go check them out. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Tried to grab lunch here today Wednesday just before 1pm and they were closed with no sign why. Appears the same happened to reviewer Carey H. on 7/1 albeit at a later hour. The owner replied he was going to look into it. But it's 2.5 months later and this was for lunch. I don't know if there's a pattern here."}
{"text":"This place is a sweet find! Had my husband pick food up last night for dinner and everything was delicious. You get a lot of food for a great deal and everything tastes great. We each had the catfish dinner as well as the fried oysters and I would recommend both items. Me and my husband will definitely be getting food from here again. As well as sending our friends and family to try."}
{"text":"Tried to eat here on Saturday at 8pm. It was closed, despite advertising they were open until 10pm. Drove from the west side for nothing."}
{"text":"I live right across the street from them. They are never open. I keep getting a text from them saying that I can get 15 % off if I come in. I think they have closed for good, because there is a new sign up and I see new people working on the building.  I am really sorry that they didn't  last because their food was really good. Maybe they have re-located. If so, they need to let someone know where they are!"}
