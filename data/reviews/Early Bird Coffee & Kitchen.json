{"text":"This place is a gem on Queen St West! I love coming here to get some serious work done with a great cup of coffee/chai latte.   It is relatively quiet which is great, and offers quality coffee as well as quality service.  Because it's a great place to work, sometimes it's hard to find seating - I myself have had to walk out a couple of times because there was no empty tables. But, if you're early enough (hah!) to get a seat, you will fall in love with the cafe in no time.  The cafe closes relatively early, compared to other indie cafes/regular cafes like Starbucks or Second cup, but that being said, it makes you become an early bird to enjoy this little place! ;)"}
{"text":"The coffee was only just okay. I got an americano, and it tasted like mostly water. In terms of coffee shops in the city, there are about 15 I would go to before coming here again."}
{"text":"I love going to early bird even if I do not drink coffee ! Try their hot chocolate with a blueberry scone and your day will be made !  The service is always perfect !"}
{"text":"A great place to have a real coffee in Toronto. The cappuccino is beautifully decorated and delicious.  Gluten free cookies are amazing. The place has cozy atmosphere and good music is always playing.  Definitely a must go if you love coffee."}
{"text":"Excellent coffee roast! Perfect score for serving coffee at a non-scalding temperature. As of now, my favourite cup of espresso in the city."}
{"text":"Typical caf√© decor of exposed brick and wood, but still aesthetically pleasing. Neon light accents perk up the space.   What certainly draws the eye is the array of coffee porn brew tools, all lined up neatly on the counter.   Though I already held a cappuccino from elsewhere in my hand, I dropped by to get an Americano. It was light, almost too watery, and didn't give me that deep, rich, flavour I'd expect from an espresso shot.  However, it's all of day 1, so I returned the next morning to try again. This time, the americano stood up. Though a coffee snob co-worker of mine states that it is more acidic than he likes and does not linger, this pleb is content.  I also discovered that they get their croissants from Jules, which is a beautiful thing. Hands down, my favourite croissant in the city and has been for some years.  Wifi, baked goods, and sandwiches are available. Seating looks good - plenty to go around. I can see this becoming a staple in my rotation of local coffee/snacks to hit up."}
{"text":"First time staying in this part of Toronto and I wanted a healthy gluten free breakfast after my run. Found this place and was delighted with the delicious fresh breakfast bowl and amazing coffee. Atmosphere is great but staff behind counter could work on their smiles and customer focused attitude."}
{"text":"The best coffee I've ever had and I fashion myself a coffee connoisseur. Smooth flavour."}
{"text":"I'm torn because I really, really like the coffee here, not to mention the fact they stock Gloryhole Doughnuts, but I've always been kind of offended by the service. More than a few times I've been made to feel like I'm interrupting the employees when I am attempting to order, like it was an inconvenience to them."}
{"text":"Terrible and slow service. Cashier lied about being out of eggs benny and people after us ordered that exact dish. After pointing that out we were able order it but when it finally arrived they had brought it out with the hollandaise sauce. The food came super late and not altogether. Had to wait 5mins after that to point out that there is no cutlery. Also it is too cold inside, there is no heating at all in this weather!!! We also paid $3 extra for bacon and literally one tiny piece of bacon was given. Coffee was also horrible and overpriced."}
{"text":"I had high expectations for this place after reading the help reviews for Early Bird. Latte was good at first, espresso had some interesting nutty bold notes to it but I noticed that the milk seemed flat. I don't think it was steamed long enough. Once the drink cooled, it was quite bitter. However, I quite liked the first couple of sips of the espresso and would come back just to have it again.  I also got the chia pudding after seeing photos of it on yelp. It looked really good but it was very flavourless and even the fruits couldn't save it. A shame since it cost $6.50. I think the muffins are from wholesaler Cirques and Squares, same kind as Dark Horse and Second Cup.   It's in a very gorgeous building. I also really liked the little paper bag they gave me for my chia pudding. It's a nice touch versus just throwing it in a plastic bag."}
{"text":"Lots of drink options to choose from. Good coffee and espresso drinks. Baked goods are really tasty as well, although haven't tried the sandwiches or wraps.  Free WIFI. Nice indoor workspace with plenty of tables. Also has a patio out back that the WIFI reaches. I'd like it better if they would play music on the patio, but maybe others like it quiet.  Overall, exactly what you'd be looking for in a coffeeshop where you can get some work done."}
{"text":"Been here twice and was disappointed both times.  First time was shortly after it opened and I ordered an americano. The extraction was kind of poor, and it didn't turn out to be very flavourful.  I decided to give it another shot today but was a little more disappointed this time. I opened the door and the smell of burnt coffee was noticeable, but I decided to give them a shot anyway. I ordered a misto this time and figured out from the get-go that it wasn't the cup of coffee I was craving. I touched the cup I was given and it was far too hot, so they didn't steam it properly, and on top of that, there was too much milk, so it ended up tasting like hot milk with a burnt coffee after taste.  The good thing about this place is that it has seating and people seemed comfortable working there. I really can't recommend the coffee though, not when Sense Appeal is a few minutes away..."}
{"text":"Cute spot, friendly staff and one of the best hot chocolates I've ever had. I liked it cause it's really not super sweet. It's actually just dark chocolate melted into hot milk."}
{"text":"For serious coffee experts only!  JUST KIDDING!!!  This place is welcoming to everyone, and their coffee is fantastic.  When you walk in, you can't miss the syphons and individual drip filter stations, which could confuse anyone.  The staff is wonderful, and they're so nice when answering questions about the various brewing methods they have available.   There's no sense of elitism that you'd get at other indie coffee shops.  The only other place that I've ever been to that did the individually dripped filter coffee was in a small coffee shop in NYC (http://abraconyc.com/) so it was so wonderful to see I could get that where I lived too!  I got a latte with almond milk and it hit the spot on my cold walk home.  I can't wait to go again."}
{"text":"Proper espresso and a super chill, airy vibe. I've been looking for exactly this since moving into the area a couple of months ago and have finally found it. Perfect place to chill with a laptop, get a little creative work done, and enjoy a well made americano."}
{"text":"This is probably the most hipster place I've ever been to. And that says a lot seeing as I was in Brooklyn last week.  Just wtf is an \"espresso tonic\"?! Or a \"cold brew tonic\"?! In true hipster style, there is, of course, no description beside these items on the menu. They have avocado toast (why?!) for $6.50 (??) and their pour-over coffee is priced at \"market\" (f-cking lol, is this a fishmongers or an espresso bar?)  Anyway, all that aside, the iced mocha I had was great. The mocha sauce was rich and thick, the locally-roasted espresso was great and the drink wasn't over-run with watery ice. It thoroughly woke me up, took away my mild hangover and made me eager to return.   Definitely a solid spot if you can handle the hipsterness."}
{"text":"I love that I can come here to avoid the chaos of a major chain. Atmosphere is warm, prices are competitive, but staff looked at me as if I had three heads when I tried to use a yelp check-in offer. Just sayin'..."}
{"text":"The environment of this cafe is probably one of the best I've been to in the Queen West area. Upstair patio and tons of seating area.   I didn't know what I should order (I'm a very indecisive person). I asked the barista what he recommended and a misto was ordered. Never heard of a misto before - so it was my first time trying one (it's basically an Americano with steamed milk/soy on top). Sounds like a good combination to me. Prepared well, but their coffee isn't something I'll be running back for.   It's a nice addition to Queen West area - but there are a few better cafes around the area that I much rather prefer."}
{"text":"Great study spot, great drinks. I love this section of Queen St W and Early Bird Brew is an amazingly decorated space with friendly staff and absolutely delicious coffee. Come early to snag a good spot since this part of the city tends to be a busy one!"}
{"text":"I usually don't give such a bad review, but if there's an option for 0 star, I would do so!  Food , coffee and the environment were very good, but that particular short-hair barista had the worst attitude!  One of the worst service I'd experienced, because of this, I will never visit again, and so are my friends who had the same experiences!"}
{"text":"It's too soon to tell if this place is going to be as pretentious as Dark Horse (people have yet to discover this place), but their espresso is excellent, very smooth. Extensive coffee-options for whatever fad-coffee you've been obsessing over lately: cortado, pour over, or just a good ol' fashioned latte.  A nice decor, lots of seating, with a window-perch and outside bench for the people-watchers. Great to park the beau and dog when running inside for caffeine.  Good service, but it might be too soon to assess since it wasn't very busy.  Reasonably-extensive snackwise, and Gluten-free goodies abound including these fantastic GF shortbread-like cookies ($~2, in milk or dark chocolate)."}
{"text":"Dropped in here for a quick breakfast since it was near my office. Pleasantly surprised by the upscale ambiance and inventive menu offerings -- I was expecting more of a traditional diner. I wasn't totally sure that eggs, tomatoes, avocado, yams, quinoa, and kale would make a good \"breakfast bowl\" but it was really tasty, not to mention pleasantly filling. Coming back again soon for another creative dish!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for an antidote to some of the downtown grunginess at Queen & Bathurst come here. This place is slick: white-washed exposed brick, clean stone counters, school chairs for seating and coffee machines from a William Gibson novel.  I always like the coffee (capp, pour over and feature espresso are my faves). On Fridays they have donuts and I want to marry them. The chia seed pudding is expensive, but I can't help myself.  It's full in the afternoon and quiet in the morning. Staff are kind, but hip and take repeat visits to warm up."}
{"text":"This place is a little gem in the vast sea of cafes on Queen St. The staff is very welcoming. When you walk in, you are transported in a magical place by the smell of baked goods and fresh coffee. The decor is charming and the red brick walls complete the the magical view of this place. There are lots of table to sit and free wifi, I expect to be very crowded over the weekends (luckily I went after work on a weekday). I ordered an iced chai latte, it was served in a large mason jar and it was very tasteful. I really want to go back to try their espresso and their dripped coffee. Can't wait to back again!!!  PS When i went, I got 20% off via Yelp check-in!! Awesome!!"}
{"text":"On a recent visit to Toronto I discovered the best coffee bar: Early Bird. Really great espresso and awesome toast items on the menu. The place was packed but quick and friendly service by the staff! I will definitely return the next time I am in the city!"}
{"text":"This place has perhaps the best coffee in Toronto. From the outside, the cafe is completely nondescript and slightly hidden behind a pile of garbage (perhaps on Wednesday's only). However, I got wind of the place via a shop clerk down the street who told me (as one coffee snob to another) that Early Bird has the best coffee on Queen Street.  Regardless of its outside appearance, when you enter you are delivered into a land of people working on shiny Mac laptops, great coffee, great food, and bouncy friendly funny baristas. For me, Early Bird was a welcome reprieve after a long morning of walking and exploring Toronto.  As an added bonus, not only is their coffee fantastic, but half of their baked goods are gluten free. They also have homemade peanut butter cups that are to die for!"}
{"text":"Best pour-over coffee I've had in Toronto! The Glory-Hole mini-donuts are a nice little treat from Fri-Sun. Check in with Yelp for 20% off. All good things."}
{"text":"Amazing cappuccino.. I loved it. The espresso  had everything I love about coffee. Customer service friendly. Good seating space.. I like the brick wall n rustic look.. I only wish if the open hours were a bit more longer.."}
{"text":"I loved the rustic look, the high ceiling, the availability of plugs and most importantly an amazing coffee and espresso that has been meticulously made.   It is perfect for a sit down coffee in the mornings, a nice conversation in the afternoon, or a relaxing after work coffee.  The coffee quality is consistently good! Not too sour, not too bitter. Just the perfect blend."}
{"text":"The gram brought me here and made me fall in love with their avocado toast. Too pretty to eat (but I ate it )  Will definitely come back for more avocado toast!"}
{"text":"The food is extremely pretty, the place is pretty, the food is good, but this place is overhyped. I was attracted to it mostly for what it had to offer visually, and that was definitely not a let-down; most probable the most instagrammable restaurant in Toronto! However pretty the layout is, it is not practical; a big table at the front and small tables scattered across a surface area that could be much better utilized left my friend and I standing for a while. You need to order before you sit, which makes the whole situation difficult, since you order and you don't know if you are going to get a seat, or when. In terms of that, the service was pretty bad, because the waiter that was intended to help us find a free table was not paying attention to what was happening and all the customers confused and stressed to find a table.  The food was good, and I did make sure to get my share of photos, but nothing out of this world fantastic, just your regular eggs benny, with a pink sauce. The chia pudding was again, very pretty, but lacked taste and the ratio of chia:toppings was definitely off, leaving it bland and uninteresting.  Overall, a nice place, though because of how uncomfortable it is, I recommend visiting in the summer instead."}
{"text":"Came here for a laptop work day recently and have to say, I was loving the vibe. We were three people and didn't have a problem grabbing a solo table at 10:00 AM on a Thursday but by the time we left, it had really filled up! A large communal table is right by the window, and would also make a great spot for meet ups of large groups.   I ordered a latte and a festive sugar cookie from Lindsey Gazel's V-Day cookie line. SO cute-- \"doughnuts about you\". Latte was to my liking as well, no burnt taste and sat pretty in a \"for here\" mug.   While working at a coffee shop, ambiance is important. This place has a high ceilings, big windows and upbeat music playing at just the right volume (for me). The place is buzzing with people, but it's also clear that during day hours, many are working away on laptops. I like a little noise with my work time, so this gelled well with me. My little group felt comfortable staying a while, and we did go up more than once to order treats, etc. out of desire, not obligation."}
{"text":"Among the best coffee in the city, up there with Fahrenheit. Plenty of space, nice ambience, wi-fi. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"yup, 5 stars!  Ordered a Cortado, was thoroughly impressed. This may be in part to the fact that I had just been to another cafe who will go unnamed for now and literally could not finish the machiatto I was served, or rather, burdened with...  anyway, very very well done at Early Bird, very nice space, WiFi, seating, they serve Pilot roasters for espresso and have a very well curated selection of coffees for pour overs/filter coffees, very worth visiting, staff was quite friendly as well and seemed to be bustling amicably among themselves. My friend had a matcha latte he said was delish as well.  They have gluten free cookies, for those who care, though I wasn't inclined to purchase one.  I ended up here on the recommendation of a barista in MTL who knows his coffee (Jesse from Artistse Affame) and was duly impressed, so thanks!"}
{"text":"Great ambiance and fantastic lattes. Their scones were rock hard-not sure how old they were lol but otherwise warm and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Early Bird is a great coffee alternative to the major coffee chains along Queen West.  Also, they have a great patio open during the warmer months.  Their coffee and baked treats are wonderful.  Service is great and they even have free wifi if you would like to hang out in their space.  Make sure you check out Early Bird if you are in the Queen Street West area."}
{"text":"Mediocre coffee and terrible food options. Cold and sterile decor mirrors the snotty/unwelcoming staff. I heard great things about this coffee shop and was so excited to try it but clearly wasn't impressed at all. Nothing is drawing me back. Thumbs down."}
{"text":"Cool local place! Lots of options on drinks not just coffee. Lots of tables and free wifi! Prices are about the same as you would get at Starbucks so don't expect it to be any cheaper. The ladies behind the counter were very nice and the coffee came out very quickly :)"}
{"text":"My local spot. Great attention to detail. Chill staff and some of the best coffee in the city. Try the Cold Brew in the summer it's perfection."}
{"text":"You really do have to be an early bird if you come here.  Whenever I have a coffee craving, this place tends to make my shortlist.  They have the usual drinks done well, and their baristas are talented enough to never put out a bad pour.  Service is also professional, and stays out of your way.  I do notice that the place is usually quite full, even on quieter days, which means you have to get a seat quickly if you spot one.  Wifi is quick, and the seating is comfortable and well lit enough to get through some light reading.  The last time I came, they were closing up early, which means they had to blare out heavy metal music to get everyone out of the place."}
{"text":"I was on Queen St W and had found Early Bird on BlogTO's best of list. Let me tell ya, the place looks good. I dig the plating schema they got going on with the wooden saucers. It was busy, as one would expect right, but I found a place to sit, no problem. There were three baristas on to handle the volume in good spirit. I ordered a cappuccino, and I received it, promptly with a free-pour tulip.   Oh yeah, also I got a vegan cookie on an oblong ceramic plate. It was decent as ****.  The cap was alright. A little too hot, not steamed extraordinarily well. It came out separated, already bubbling on top. The bean came through distinct in this medium roast way, not too sweet, lil smokey. It was OK. It was fine. I was fine.  And I sat, and I wrote some stuff in a notebook. Attractive young hip haircut persons all around me, in this neat interior, trap flavored moody beat playing. It's like, the image of a cool, with it, cafe.  But damn I wish that cap was better. I'm a barista myself, you know (I'm not gonna come out and say that to them.) I know how it is. Sometimes, the bean isn't there. Sometimes, a mediocre cap falls through the cracks. I get it, I get it. You can't really judge a cafe on one go around. You got to be a *regular.* I'm thinking this, I'm looking at em, right, I put my pen down, I close my notebook, and people are coming and going all around me, and I'm just sitting there, anonymous.   Then I left."}
{"text":"Great brunch spot Very good service!  Can't go wrong either the choices of coffee And almost everything on the brunch menu is a win!"}
{"text":"Omg you guys  Amazing food The best breakfast presentation I have ever had Fresh ingredients Friendly staff Definitely worth the money!!!"}
{"text":"Got sucked into the hype because the food is very instagram worthy but too bad the food isn't as delicious as it looks.  The black rice pudding tasted like nothing. Super bland. Might as well be eating my napkin.   The mushroom toast (I don't remember the name) was cold, the bread was harder than Ryan Goslings abs, the flavour was bland.  Beatroot latte was pretty to look at but also bland af. Their coffee also sucks.   Needless to say if you're looking to satisfy your eyes and not your stomach, Early Bland Kitchen is the place be!"}
{"text":"Decent coffee and food, but amazing working space!   My friend and I ordered a flat white to drink and shared the ricotta jam toast and eggs benedict. The flat white was pretty good - definitely not as smooth as I've had at other coffee shops. I would NOT recommend the ricotta jam toast; the toast was thick and dry, the flavour was bland, and nothing about the texture was appealing. However, the eggs benedict were quite delicious! It's served on potato rostis (rather than the traditional english muffin) with a unique beet hollandaise sauce and a side salad. The portion of this was good, the eggs benny was overall really tasty, and the salad was a nice complement. I would definitely say that the food looks better than it tastes.   The service is okay - not the friendliest staff, but willing to help if you ask. On the flip side, the d√©cor is minimalistic and the ambiance is perfect for young professionals looking for a space to do some work. You can expect cool neon lights, plants, and bright natural lighting!   I think I would return for the working space and just order a snack/coffee on the side.   Note: You walk in, sit anywhere, and order food at the counter where they'll give you a table number after. When your coffee/drinks are ready, they'll call your name. When your food is ready, they'll bring it to your table! (This was a process we were confused about since it was our first time and no one came to seat us.)"}
{"text":"Excellent cappuccino and perfect avocado toast - toast the fact mix of crunchy and chewy, piled high with avo that's been hit with just enough salt and citrus. The slices of watermelon radish and sprinkle of chilli flakes didn't hurt either. I've been working here for a couple of hours and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Amazing! One of the best cortados I've had in the city. Perfect balance of coffee and milk, no bitter or sourness here, just straight up goodness.  The cappuccinos were also quite lovely and I love the wooden saucer/plates they use (what can I say, I'm a sucker for presentation). They also have a good selection of nibbles such as scones, cookies, chia pudding and sandwiches, so if you get peckish they do offer delicious solutions. I've tried the cookies (salted chocolate chip and oatmeal) and scones, all very tasty.   The decor is the definition of cool, slick and hipster. Whitewashed brick walls, rustic industrial chic furniture and tunes selected by the baristas (seems to depend whose on duty - I've had mellow acoustics and old school hip hop so anything goes!). They do apparently have a great rooftop patio, though I have yet to explore that option since it's been too hot or raining the days I've come by. I will say sometimes seating is limited and the space between the tables is tight so not a place for those who want their own cozy nook (though I'd recommend the bar rail for that).   They also do take orders through Ritual app which is handy for those in the area."}
{"text":"Ugh, yes the coffee here is great - maybe my favourite in the city. There's tables and seating good enough for settling down and getting some work done. Very bright space.  I don't get the friendliest vibe from the place - it definitely tries to be ~queen west cool~ vibe."}
{"text":"Love the coffee here! $4 is a little steep for a pourover but I guess there isn't much competition in Toronto for it yet. Still my go to in the area but the service can sometimes be a little hit or miss."}
{"text":"This place makes me feel great about being in the know about hipster culture but not being an actual duchebag hipster.   It's great for a cup of coffee that has a distinct flavour, too much of the coffee in the city lacks diversity and there's excited my pallet.   I don't come to this part of town often but when I do this is a must. The selection of baguettes, scones, cookies and muffins is great for a bit to eat if you are staying for a few hours.   The patio is a nice touch in the summer."}
{"text":"I love to go to this place during my break and I am a fan of their good, creamy and pretty latte. The coffee this place offers is really tasty and intense, and the modern / chill atmosphere is really cool. They also offer some quality cookies and chocolates, but I haven't tried any yet.  A great choice if you work nearby and are looking for a nice coffee place, and also if you are looking for a place with a quiet atmosphere to read or do some work."}
{"text":"To be fair, if you are looking for that great instagram shot, the presentation of the food is great. Personally I found this place to have a stressful vibe. The employees seemed quite demoralized and visibly unhappy - I am guessing perhaps it has to do with their business model - no real waiters hence low/no tips? (but steep prices for what you are getting) . I felt the eggs benny portion was quite small. To be fair, some of the other menu items looked better, but I still feel that you kind of have to get that right to earn additional stars. The orange juice was a very small glass of mostly ice, and the coffee (admittedly an Americano) was extremely watered down. That removes another star from my review."}
{"text":"I was visiting Toronto and have always wanted to come here. However, I was slightly disappointed. The place is so cute and was pretty crowded but it was a Friday so definitely understandable. When I went to order, I had no idea what to get so I was asking the barista what he recommends. He gave me stand-offish answers so I felt like I was bothering him. I ended up getting a regular latte and an oatmeal cookie. When I finally got my order, I was sitting with my friends and accidentally spilled my drink. I had only taken a sip... I apologized to the barista but he ignored me lol. Perhaps, the barista was having a bad day but I just honestly just didn't like the whole experience... I don't think I would come back if I am ever in Toronto again."}
{"text":"Nice chill coffee place. They have gluten-free, healthy breakfast, lunch and snack options. Coffee is a bit on the pricier side"}
{"text":"Great spot, awesome Queen vibes.  The space is clean, perfect amount of seating (maybe a bit too close to each other) and great coffee. Always full of people working on their laptops."}
{"text":"The pics by fellow YEB/YDB drew me to this place as the espresso drinks looked quite nice. The setup initially looks nice but at closer inspection shows the missteps as am not sure what the theme is here (metallic moose heads with a name like early bird?!) The behind the counter area is well arranged and there are quite few impressive brewing apparatus. My friend wanted to try the syphon version so we decided to order a 3 cup version. Then for good measures ordered a cheese scone and caramel and sea salt brownie.  We anxiously awaited for the coffee as the brewing process is nice to look at (heck anything that involves a live flame and lab looking equipment is sure to draw a crowd) The scone was forgetful and was very bready for a lack of better word.  The brownie fared better. Now for the main attraction we were given instructions on how to enjoy this coffee to the max. Wait five min and then sip wait some more to get the right flavors. Hmm I am an espresso drinker so wish I had ordered their espresso based drinks instead or the well recommended cold brew. The syphon version just didn't do it me and oddly it tasted more like a strong tea to me. My friend's opinion was similar and even added milk and sugar to gulp the last cup down. So far a very average showing though I will come back and try their espresso drinks and update."}
{"text":"My go-to neighbourhood coffee bar. What sets this place apart from the plethora of coffee shops in Toronto?  Rotating Bean selection with interesting hard to find imports (From Bows and Arrows in Victoria BC, to selections from Sweeden) .  Among the best pour overs in the city with great technique and even better beans.  Relaxed environment with friendly attentive staff.  Surprising availability of seats, paired with a chic decor.  Overall the people at Early Bird know and respect their coffee, drop by if you either are an want to get a taste of Toronto's Coffee Culture at its best."}
{"text":"Came here yesterday for the first time and was quite impressed! The staff were terrific and extremely friendly. The decor is modern/rustic, very beautiful.  We ordered some lattes, mochas and doughnuts. All were delicious. The doughnuts were baked to perfection.  I will be returning!"}
{"text":"Healthy brunch-goers, especially my fellow millennials, Early Bird is sure to satisfy all of your brunch needs.  Food: The menu is fairly sized, with emphasis on drinks and fresh pastry. The fresh food menu includes oats, chia pudding bowls, benedicts and of course, avocado toast. The best part of the menu in my opinion is the option to substitute almost anything. I swapped out the bread in my avocado toast for steamed sweet potato as I really love complex carbs in the morning. It was amazing and I don't think I can do avocado toast the same anymore. I added a soft-boiled egg to up my protein intake. The dish was simple, yet satiating and almost difficult to consume as the presentation of it was just beautiful. My partner had the eggs benedict with sausage, though the portion was too small for his stature, the plating was also perfection and the taste met his expectation. Neither of us are coffee drinkers, but we relished our warm hot chocolate and matcha tea drinks.   Ambiance: With its high ceilings and clean white brick walls, tons of plants and hardwood table tops, you'll feel like you're brunching out on a patio or something similar. Tons of attention to the nitty-gritty details.  Service: The cashier was not as hospitable when we approached her to figure out exactly how the restaurant functioned, there were no signs that explained orderings and waiting. However, the servers were all friendly and attentive.  Price: Mirrors the ambiance, when you walk in you know you're going to be paying an arm and a leg. Although the quality of the food was great, the portions were small. I suggest ordering a pastry or adding to your dish.   Overall: Brunch food that looks and taste great, a little pricey, but the ambiance and overall dining experience are worth trying this spot."}
{"text":"I'm going against the grain here and say I didn't love this place the way everyone else does.  Sure, the decor is nice and there are tables if you need to stay for a few hours but I wanted to just grab a drink and go.    Fact: I'm not a coffee expert.  However, I do like a nice chai latte every now and then.    I found theirs to be heavier on the milk and not so aromatic.  I felt like I was drinking plain, warm milk with a hint of cinnamon (which was sprinkled on top at the end).    Sense Appeal is at the top of my list for now."}
{"text":"This is a fantastic spot on Queen St. West. I was in Toronto on business and was delighted to find this spot not only open early, but serving delicious food and coffee. I would recommend this spot for breakfast, or just coffee. I loved their matcha latte and eggs Benny.   The space is bright and welcoming, a great place to meet friends, go on a date, have a solo coffee, or get some work done. There are certain spots reserved for no electronic devices, which you are pleasantly alerted to by a small note card. However, there is a large communal table to work from, which means you can could make new friends.   The staff were very friendly and helpful.  When I'm back in Toronto I'll be going back forsure."}
{"text":"My new favourite coffee shop in Toronto! From atmosphere, location and the quality of their coffee and food options, this place is a must visit!"}
{"text":"Very hipster vibe and cool interior. I always love when places have exposed brick. The coffee is standard but excellent treats and  specialty drinks . Pricing was fair. And we loved that there was complimentary water self serve. Will return. However the signage was easy to miss but I like how it gives it a speak easy vibe. It has a beautiful upstairs patio with flowers surrounding on ledge."}
{"text":"Two stars for the music and pretty decor. No stars for the coffee - both times I've been here it's tasted burnt and improperly pulled. I was hoping today's mocha would be better but I'd be hard pressed to identify the faintest hint of chocolate in this drink - again it's merely bitter. And just as bad as that, they blast the air conditioning in here, even on a day like this one, when it's a chilly 8 degrees outside. Service is kind of gruff and the tables are rarely cleaned off. So let's review: not comfortable, not delicious, not coming back."}
{"text":"Really long wait to sit (with little organization), w45 minute wait for breakfast ( after being sold out of eggs Bennie - our reason for coming) and very below average and expensive food. I given them one star for presentation, but otherwise not work their BlogTO shout outs.  :("}
{"text":"If I could give it 6 stars I would, because in addition to all the lovely things you will read in the reviews here Early Bird hits those two extra notes that for me, make all the difference.  1. Gluten free treats. Supersonic cookies from the wonderful Bunners bakery are a classic. They also carry those moist yummy muffins that Jimmy's has, the olive oil orange ones and chocolate banana.  So when I get in a good writing groove, I know there are options for snacks. Yay!  2. Totally, beautifully, wheelchair accessible. From the front door to the (mind you, only) single giant main floor bathroom.  Well done Early Bird!  One of the few places on this part of queen that is accessible.  Thank you for being decent human beings.   Other than that, you've got the soothing textures of wood and brick, solid wifi, delicious coffee (soy and almond milk options), the floor to ceiling front window gives lots of natural light to the communal table up front (which has a succulent terrarium on it...so nice), good music and very friendly staff.   So happy they are here. I have only been there twice (in the last two days) and both times I enjoyed epic creative productivity. For me, a sign that I feel at home and in good quiet company."}
{"text":"What a lovely new coffee shop on Queen Street West. The high ceilings give it an open feel, and there is lots of seating. While it was quiet when we stopped in, it seems it would still be a good place to spend your morning if it were busy.   I wasn't surprised but the exposed brick wall and one-room-school-house style chairs, however the other decor was very eye-catching: ornate lighting and faux taxidermy, not to mention all the cool coffee-brewing gadgets on display across the bar.   A long black was ordered as well as an americano - both were great, and our croissant was very tasty as well. Sandwiches and a variety of other pastries are available so we'll have to visit again trip to try other snacks. Also, I'm very intrigued by the cold brew they serve. I've have heard good recommendations thus far, so that will definitely be ordered next time."}
{"text":"Very good coffee, I would recommend this place. Definitely a good quality cup of coffee."}
{"text":"AUGH   I was so excited about this place so giving 3 stars kind of makes me sad.   The coffee is great. One of the better ones I've had in Toronto. (Water in Toronto suck) although I was spoiled with hella good coffee all weekend at the barista competition, this place, I was still excited for.   But I have to give 3 stars for food and their service. They made a mistake with our order so food didn't arrive for over 20 minutes. However this was not communicated that we were left frustrated. They didn't apologize and when the food had come, the bread (I got hummus toast) was dried out.   Aughhhhhhhhh  Cmon guys."}
{"text":"Very hipster! Only open for breakfast brunch. Better to come on a weekday otherwise you will be waiting a long time. Hate that you need to order at the counter. Very Instagram worthy food. I had the Breakfast Bowl - tasty and hearty because it includes porridge. Savoury take on a bowl but not worth 13.50$. Still hungry after. Smoothies are $12 which is just insane since it's a normal size mug. Bacon is a possible add on on most items but they'll charge you $3. Otherwise quick service of food. Not much seating."}
{"text":"The space inside is welcoming and open as well as bright from both natural and ceiling lighting. There's a lot of room to work or just to sit and talk. Music isn't over bearing that you have to put headphones on. The only thing I have to say is their internet only uses 5.0 broadband so if you know your computer doesn't pick up that signal good luck. I got a mocha this time around and it's an interesting taste compare to your usual mocha. They use cocoa and it wasn't sweet it was easy on the tongue. I also got a chocolate donut which was great. Overall I would come back because of the food and workspace."}
{"text":"Little gem tucked away on queen. Love the atmosphere here. Hard to find seats though but you can feel all the brain activity happening here right when you walk in the front door."}
{"text":"I came here for the first time during lunchtime on a Wednesday and I had such a wonderful experience! My only concern was that I wasn't hipster enough for this restaurant- but it shouldn't have been a worry for me. The food is decently priced (especially for being in downtown) and the quality of the food is wonderful! I ordered the scrambled egg, and my friends got the black rice porridge and eggs benny and all three dishes were amazing. The portions are not huge, but definitely good sized and very filling to my small stomach. Highly recommended for breakfast/brunch!"}
{"text":"Was just walking by to grab a coffee. 5 minutes before close. Was told \"we are actually closed\" when the store is still open. Look, I get it, I've worked as a barista too. I just wanted to grab a latte to go. Your hours say one thing, your door is open and your sign says open. Turning someone away 5 minutes before you actually close is a little rude. Not even like it was 6:58, it was 6:55. Disappointed. When I worked in service we closed the doors the hour the place closed, anyone in the doors was good to go. Just lost a customer. Shame too, I love this coffee. Luckily there are other amazing places near by I can take my business to"}
{"text":"Used to be one of my faves. Coffee is still great, service unfriendly. Customers seem to be a major inconvenience for these guys."}
{"text":"Thought this place was very overrated. The coffee was relatively expensive ($3.60 for Americano) and didn't impress me that much. Seemed lukewarm and not that strong. The interior of the cafe was pretty nice but not great if you need a place to work quietly - it is quite loud and there's limited seating. Don't think I would come back."}
{"text":"Location: Queen West, near all the shops.  The place: Like most places in TO, it's not very big, but I was able to get a table when I arrived. Worst case, they have a big bench across from the cash so you can sit there.   The goods: I just had a great Cortado with almond milk and I really enjoyed it! I didn't ask which beans they use, but the roast was solid.  Service: Good.  Price point: I think it was about $3.50 for the Cortado."}
{"text":"I saw this on blogTo post. It was good. Very tasty. I'm a pescetarian and loved this place. We ordered the 2 eggs ben, 3 lattes, chia seed pudding and their green shakshukka. The serving was a little less than i was expecting. And my friends agreed with me. For a $80 plus tax price i was expecting a little more. Or maybe its just us we dunno ? hah. Taste wise, it was good!"}
{"text":"Atmopshere is nice. It's a good place to come with friends. In terms of food & drink, my friends and only got drinks so we can comment on that alone.  I got an iced green tea matcha latte while my friends got an iced cold brew so I can only comment on that.  The matcha green tea latte was decent but the barista went heavy on the ice so my drink was quite watered down. There was no sugar in the latte drink, if you wish for it to be sweetened, you have to ask.  The cold brew my friend got was nice -refreshing. I liked that and would say it's better than the latte!"}
{"text":"Highly overrated. Wifi did not work. Very unhepful environment. Limited selection. Not sure why it was rated as one of the best 10 places to study."}
{"text":"Beautiful looking food. My eggs benny was lukewarm but good. Minimal seasoning so you'll have to add more. Don't bother with the extra bacon. You get one small slice for $3.  They were out of juice! For Sunday brunch this isn't acceptable.   Physically the place was cold. And they need hooks for coats and hats."}
{"text":"I only ordered 2 things here, a Cortado for a friend and a Latte for myself.  The latte is 4 bucks which isn't bad and it went down right.  As far as seating this place is sort of tight.  We ended up sitting at the large table near the front of the store.  I like the fact that there's a bench to sit to the side and wait for your order to be made because it's more comfortable than just hanging around near where the pick up counter is.    I didn't have anything to eat but it's not really the kind of place I'd eat at anyway.  Like many coffee shops of many people seem to be doing work in here which is so common to see these days.  Gladly there weren't a gazillion cables all over the place like some places I've seen.  I like the feel of this place and it's nice and bright inside.    It's a \"Clean, Well-Lighted Place\"."}
{"text":"This was the perfect place to grab our coffees when we stayed around the corner for a week for the Toronto Nike race. I've had the Flat White and latte, and Americano, all were great and served in good timing. Also, their chia pudding was DELICIOUS! One of the best I've had! There were so many little fruits in it, bananas, blackberries, blueberries, strawberries, mangoes, pomegranate seeds, coconut shavings... This place is clean, with a simple aesthetic, ample spacing and a spacious clean bathroom. All the baristas were great, sweet and helpful. I will definitely come back for the chia pudding and a latte when I'm back in Toronto!"}
{"text":"Used to love coming to this place but new owners and now staff are consistently rude. Great coffee but probably the most unfriendly caf√© in the west end."}
{"text":"Good ol Queen West coffee shop.  It's a clean, refined space with beautiful long cascading hanging planters (which I am trying to create at home) and generally a decent playlist.   It's a great place to take a break, get some work done, or even get together for a meeting. Given the size of the space, it can get pretty loud.   The coffee is great! I've tried their americano and cappuccino, and a couple of baked goods.  The prices are fair for the size and quality."}
{"text":"This was my second visit to Early Bird. I have to say I quite enjoy the atmosphere here. White walls, exposed (but painted) brick, wood accents and industrial touches. This is my kind of place. They even have neon lighting indoors (and I'm a sucker for seeing hipster places use neon signs in sparingly good taste). But I'm going to give this fancy schmancy brew house 4 stars because I feel like the service is a bit slow for a place that serves caffeine. I understand that it's a craft, but at the end of the day I would appreciate getting my drink a little sooner than 10 mins from ordering. Esp for the price I'm paying for your craftsmanship. Thankfully I've never gone in when there was a huge line up, but I wonder if it takes as long when there is a morning crowd?"}
{"text":"A very cute little brunch restaurant situated a little outside of downtown Toronto with minimalistic decor giving the place a very clean and cool atmosphere. You can sit down and enjoy a brunch, or grab a coffee and go. The food is good, priced reasonably, and plated beautifully, which was one of the reasons why my friends and I decided to drop by for a quick bite. We ordered the chia seed pudding, the avocado toast, the eggs benedict with beat hollandaise sauce, a regular latte with cinnamon and a matcha latte. You order and pay for your food at the counter and it will be brought to you when ready, however you have to pick up the drinks yourself. The chia seed pudding was very light in flavour with different fruits and nuts as toppings including strawberry yogurt, pomegranate, kiwi, coconut shavings, nuts and what I think was either cocoa or ground coffee beans. The eggs benedict looked beautiful with the beat coloured hollandaise sauce which made the dish pop along with a side salad of mixed greens. Taste wise, it wasn't much different than a normal eggs benny. The avocado toast was very good with a generous amount of avocado sliced and placed like a rose on top of the toast. Overall, not a bad experience, would definitely recommend people to at least give it a try or come if you want a really pretty photo."}
{"text":"good food, portions just arent filling enough as actual brunch, would need to get one and a half things nice vibe, nice music, i like the fact that some tables are screen free would probably come back again when they have smoothie bowls"}
{"text":"this shop gives you real Espresso. Add a shot and you will be shaked to tears. Smells like heaven."}
{"text":"We came on a Wednesday which might make the difference between my review and some of the other reviews on here. We came in on a Wednesday and there were a few empty tables. They do have signs on a lot of the single tables letting people know that those aren't tables meant for laptops. They do have a longer communal table by the entrance where people with laptops were working. We ordered right away.   I got a latte and my friend got a cappuccino, both had a strong espresso flavor. I had the green shakshuka and my friend had the eggs Benedict. The food didn't take too long to come out, but it wasn't a busy day either. The shakshuka did have a strong tomatillo taste, which is what the menu stated, not your average shakshuka. The eggs Benny was interesting too, the hollandaise sauce was pink and had beets in it, instead of an English muffin it was on top of potato latkes and avocado. This also came with a side salad. The sauce was on the sweeter side which was interesting, I did like that it was on the potato latkes, I thought this made it much more flavorful.   All in all I really enjoyed this place, but from what it seems like, it should be avoided on weekends."}
{"text":"To be honest, I came here because it was aesthetic.  Everything is a little expensive for what it is, but if you're here for photos you'll definitely get some great shots.  The coffee is pretty standard, and the avocado toast is expensive but I came here for photos and it definitely didn't disappoint in that aspect.  The cafe is always pretty busy with lots of people doing work on their laptops, so if you're looking for a sit down brunch place, this isn't really it.  All in all, I would probably still come back, the food isn't amazing but it's also not bad so if you're looking to treat yourself a little you might as well shell out a little extra because the presentation is on point."}
{"text":"Ordered a latte here which tastes pretty much like any other latte at any other cafe. What I like about this cafe is that it's super cute!! The only down side is that there isn't much seating here."}
{"text":"Great coffee and amazing avocado toast!  There was tons of seating and free wifi, which is always a plus!  I really appreciated their unique coffee menu but just went with my typical iced coffee with a shot of espresso.  They also have almond milk available upon request.  Food options were limited but the avocado toast was some of the best I've ever had.   Solid coffee spot to check out if you're in the toronto area."}
{"text":"Slowest service on the planet. I work down the street. One day I tried to call in a pick up order for an avocado toast. The lady told me on the phone that it was not possible and it would only take 10 minutes to make. So I went in and ordered it. It took over 35 minutes. I had to just leave. What a joke"}
{"text":"We cannot argue with other five star reviewers. This is the best espresso and slow bar we've found in Toronto. Coffee is the primary (actually only reason for us) reason for stopping and the knowledgeable  staff don't miss. They are happy to discuss and recommend different roasters. The international nature of suppliers allows a coffee aficionado the opportunity to test a number of styles.   The regular espresso spot food offerings are available and were eaten with great gusto by others.  Highly recommended. Queen Street West has been our usual haunt on semi-annual visits in the past. Early Bird Espresso is reason enough to make us look no further on our next trip"}
{"text":"their eggs benedict is the worst food that I've had  currently so gross. taste doesn't good at all. it totally made me lose my appetite. teas are okay I'm not sure about coffees"}
{"text":"This place can be brutal. Really expensive and service can be non-existent. A 3/4-pound bag of beans was close to $20, and price tag's pretty hard to see so most will have to ask to find out. Staff is often not very attentive and drinks can take a long time to be made. Just went in again to fact check and truthfully, staff is really nice, just slow, really slow. I'm usually asked by the barista what drink I ordered again while waiting for it.  On the other hand, the coffee is good and the decor's pretty bang-on. I'll be back but service could really be improved upon."}
{"text":"Walking in I was confused as to table service or not?? There was no direction. I approached the counter and stood there waiting for someone. Finally the arrogant male making coffee looked up and gave me brief instructions. After waiting in the line for 7-9 minutes just to order the woman taking my order didn't listen to me and spoke over me, which meant I had to explain my order twice. After ordering a loose leaf tea I was given a tea bag which didn't draw and I had to get a replacement. I ordered the eggs beni with a side of bacon ($3 extra) when my breakfast came out the bacon was on top of my eggs and only 1 piece. If you order extra bacon on the side I would expect it A on the side and B at least 2 pieces. The food was good however the experience was awful. The man making coffees had such an attitude I didn't want to sit at the counter anymore. Very unpleasant."}
{"text":"A cute little cafe that is easy to miss as it's very \"narrow\" (I guess this is the right word...). I was looking for a cafe on Queen St W that had wifi where I could post up for a bit and get some work done. What really drew me was their avocado toast because it looked amazing -- and it was. However, it was really small. For around $6, the toast was the size of my hand, or even smaller. I could've eaten 3 of them for a snack.   There was plenty of seating, and you could choose between communal tables or individual tables, and there were some outlets around you could plug into. My biggest issue, though, was the wifi. It was super spotty and I was there for around 1.5 hours and barely got anything done because I was just waiting for my laptop to connect. I know this isn't a \"necessity\" for a coffee shop, but if it offers wifi, I definitely expect it to work. Bummer :(   Overall, a great coffee shop. Just don't come in expecting fast wifi (or wifi at all!), and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Really liked the atmosphere when I came here to get some reading for work done. However their WIFI wasn't working on my device for some reason and there aren't enough power outlets (they were all occupied when I went)."}
{"text":"Love the simplistic interior design and ambiance. The sea salt cookie and iced chai latte that I had were really good! I really like how there's a patio out back as well! Overall, a really great place to catch up on some work or to go to when you're out on Queen and you want a little pick me up."}
{"text":"If you're going to stand in a cramped space, or out in the cold to eat brunch on a late sunday morning, you make sure it's worth it.  Show up here at prime lazy morning time, you will wait and it will be uncomfortable, this place is just small enough and the way to get in and out is narrow. We were sat right by the door which blasted us with frigid air every time it opened. I got the scrambled egg dish with bacon, and toast..so simple but it was perfection. Creme fraiche brought these eggs up a notch and the bacon was thick and smoky. The juice offerings are next to none..they have blood orange juice for $4 which was not worth the price."}
{"text":"Great selection of gluten free and vegan baked goods. Pilot coffee roasters - can't go wrong with these guys. Lovely espresso options and a great tea menu. Atmosphere is clean and bright. Nice patio. Great addition to this neighbourhood, where it's hard to find a good cup of coffee paired with an appealing environment. Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"UPDATE: The shop contacted me and I have updated my review from 2 stars to 5 because he took the time to reach out :)   Here is the old review: I am truly amazed... The coffee was excellent, the food was outstanding, the location itself was very nicely designed and laid out... But would it kill any one of the three barista is behind the bar to even crack a smile?  The one guy who is waiting on me... I tried to pay him a complement and say out of all the coffee joints in Toronto this is the one I chose because it looked the most interesting... And in the middle of my comment he literally turned from me and walked away.   I sat in their shop for over 15 minutes and didn't see any staff person smile or say anything nice to anyone.   It truly astounds me with all the effort they put into crafting such amazing coffee... And creating amazing food... They could spend a few minutes training the baristas to be friendly. It costs nothing... And makes the experience 10 times better."}
{"text":"I came here with my friend for brunch around noon time (prime brunch time).   Ambiance  Everything about this place is hipster. I'm pretty sure this place was created with social media in mind. The large floor to ceiling windows blasts sunlight well into the back of the shop, creating the perfect bright lighting for perfect pictures. Add in an exposed brick wall, all white theme with hints of greenery, white marble tables and a minimal ambiance. Seems like this place has checked everything off the Pinterest decor checklist. The main attraction is the bright and colorful plates, cups and perfectly curated food which contrasts with the all white interior. The place feels cozy, welcoming and perfectly made for millennials in mind.  Service  The service was warm and helpful. Everyone was very efficient, accommodating and friendly. While we waited for our seats, the waiter warmly greeted us with a smile, then gave us a menu to look at while we waited. Although the place was jammed packed, we only had to wait about 10 minutes until we were seated. The ordering process is similar to a Panera Bread, where you would order at the cashier and given a number to place at your table. When the food is ready, the waiters bring out the utensils and food. Overall, great service and not snobby like how some other hipster places can be.  Food  The food is beautifully plated which is surprising for a small and casual place. Their presentation elevates their brunch from a take out place to feeling like you're dining at Colette Cafe. To be  honest, some of their items look a lot better than it tastes, but majority of their food is still quite tasty and enjoyable. My favorite is the eggs benedict. It is very unique from other egg benedicts I've tried and very scrumptious. They give the dish a unique spin by serving the eggs on crispy hashed potatoes instead of the traditional english muffin, and can I just point out that the hollandaise sauce is pink?!  My friend and I also shared the avocado toast which was topped with some dill, pomegranates and other herbs and garnishes. The center of the toast was very moist and soft, however the crust of the bread was too hard making it difficult to cut and chew. With a softer crust, I would have enjoyed this a lot more. Lastly, we also shared a breakfast bowl which includes savory porridge topped with avocado and a variety of seasonal vegetables and a poached egg. This was quite tasty, however I found the porridge kind of underwhelming and tasteless on it's own. The poached egg and vegetables gave the dish some flavor, but not enough in my opinion. Most of the dishes are tasty, however nothing too memorable, with the exception of the eggs benedict, yum!  Recommendation  Yes! I would recommend this place to anyone looking to have a nice girl's brunch or for a brunch date with their significant other. It's a great and eclectic place to try at least once and the vibe, service and perfectly plated food makes it a fun experience."}
{"text":"Very nice interior, clean, big space.  The coffee was very good.  Looking forward to returning."}
{"text":"The store is airy and roomy, the tables are beautiful and the coffee vessel really make the experience over the top. We had pour over which was great, and we both ordered the breakfast bowl. The bowl was disappointing the polenta wasn't cooked all the way and cold. The poached egg ruined the dish because it made the whole bowl extremely soupy. Overall coffee is shining star, the food not so much."}
{"text":"The avocado toast was fantastic! The servers were super friendly and the space was peaceful. Great start to our day!"}
{"text":"You don't get better coffee than this place!  the coffee isn't burnt and its not load with ice or loaded with milk... this is a true coffee.  I recently discovered this place and it has it all trendy cool staff and of course great tasting coffee!!"}
{"text":"Felt like we were eating from a Dr. Seuss menu with the pink eggs benny and the crazy crunchy oatmeal.  Who doesn't love Dr. Seuss?   Interesting flavors that encourage experimentation and communal dining.  It was an interesting and tasty visit."}
{"text":"The vibe: A cozy little haven amongst all the chain coffee shops in that block of Queen St. It's a narrow but beautiful spot fit with large tables, cacti and succulents in the window (SCORE!) and a lovely selection of snacks. Which is a big deal.  The food: I haven't had the pleasure of trying anything to eat here, but the sandwiches look fantastic. Anything on a French baguette is a win. Also, some delicious looking baked goods and homemade power bars.  My go to meal: Latte. As always.   Secret: Wifi! Although it didn't work when I was there. But who knows. Computers are spotty."}
{"text":"Lovely place situated downtown on the hussle of Queen St W. It like a little escape for studying (what I was intentionally trying to do), working, reading, or any cafe-type activity.   The physical indoors is very open concept with their large front windows and wooden tables spread out near the from of the window. The chairs are comfy, but not too much where you'll fall asleep doing your work.   The baristas are super nice. You can see they put in real effort to make your drink in front of you and it feels ten times better to drink it. Which leads me to say, their coffee smells and is magnificent. I got a cappuccino that I could of downed in two seconds because it was that good. Except I wanted to have it as long as I could, plus I don't want to be bouncing off the walls and do even less studying.   Crowd is generally young and hipster which is right up my alley and atmosphere is really cosy with amazing music playing. There were times I was contemplating not to put on headphones since their play list seemed to be better than mine.   Would of five starred this place, if it didn't close so early! (hinthint)."}
{"text":"Got the egg bene with beet hollandaise (doesnt taste beet at all) on a potato cake, eggs were perfectly poached. Capuccino was good, they even bring it to your table (wasnt sure if it is a caf√© or restaurant)"}
{"text":"It was a snowy Saturday morning, and I was excited to try Early Bird. I drove down (yes, I drove on Queen West) and entered the cute coffee shop.   The exposed brick and industrial feel was very cool. It was a great atmosphere and I was excited to eat the city's prettiest breakfast.   Started off with cold brew and a regular drip coffee, for being known for their coffee I was NOT impressed. Starbucks serves better coffee or head over to Jimmy's coffee which is simply perfect.   I ordered the Avocado Toast, Eggs Benny with Bacon and the Chia Seed Pudding. None of what I ordered tasted bad but it didn't taste good. The Chia Seed pudding was beautifully presented with Hemp Seeds, Cocoa Nibs, Coconut Flakes and Pomegranate Seeds. It had zero flavor to it unless you had the toppings, I had maybe 3 bites and was bored.   Next up was the Avocado Toast. This was actually a work of art, the avocados looked like a rose petal. I bit it and just tasted a bit of olive oil and avocado. It could have used something more, some more flavor or even just salt. I wasn't impressed and was starting to get annoyed.   Last up, the Eggs Benny. I ordered the bacon with it, it was also beautifully presented. The eggs were cooked just right and I LOVED that they used a potatoes latkes base, it had a nice crisp to it and wasn't overly oily. The bacon was a bit disappointing because it was very fatty. The sauce on top (that pink sauce) was okay, again not a lot of flavor.   The portions were great for the amount, and the decor is on point! I just wish it tasted as good as it looks.   Keep Eating,  Angela"}
{"text":"Third time and my go to order: Capuccino double with skim milk and avocado toast with soft boiled egg. The avocado toast di not have parmigiano reggiano this time, which made me kind of sad. My friend got the bennies and they were amazing like always. Think I'm changing my avocado toast addiction to the eggs Benedict when it comes to Early Bird!"}
{"text":"A friend and I came here Sunday for brunch. We had seen many photos on Instagram of their beautiful food and lattes which is why we traveled from Mississauga to go here!   Unfortunately when we got to the restaurant they had \"run out\" of hollandaise sauce to make the pink Eggs Benny which is what we had come for.... it was very disappointing to drive all that way to just be told they were out of their feature dish. We had later discovered that they weren't \"out\" but because it was 3pm when we arrived and they stop serving food at 4pm that they didn't want to make another batch of hollandaise. It wasn't just myself and my friend who were disappointed but we heard a number of people around us talking that they were disappointed that they couldn't get the Eggs Benny either. I'm sorry but if 5 people around me all wanted it it should have been enough to make another batch. Just looked like poor planning and inconsideration to me.  Regardless we asked the sever what else on the menu was pink as we wanted to get pink food to match the pink beetroot lattes we were also going to get. He told us that the Overnight Oats were pink. So we went up to order that instead and... well... they were \"out\" of that too.  So out of the 12 items on their menu... 2 features weren't avaiable. And they no longer serve the Smoothie Bowls which is a highlight on many online accounts.  Anyways. We just wanted to leave at that point but we were hungry so stayed and had our pink beetroot lattes and some other food which were all very good!! We very much enjoyed everything we did finally end up having!  It's too bad the overall experience was just so poor that we will not be back. Going somewhere specifically for what they showcase on social media just to be told tough luck is not how they should be running things."}
{"text":"My breakfast bowl here was absolutely delicious! The base was millet which reminded me of grits, but is wheat-based rather than corn. The seasonings made this bowl really stand out. I have tried to recreate it at home, but I'm not sure what the spice combination was to make this bowl so umami!  I accompanied my bowl with a cup of drip coffee. Unfortunately when I requested a refill, I was told no. I paid $31 for breakfast. I don't think a refill on my coffee is too much to ask. I would not return to Early Bird for this one reason. If they are that miserly, they don't really want my business."}
{"text":"The emperor has no clothes!  This is one of the most favorably reviewed highly touted coffee houses in Toronto.  I drink a lot of espresso house coffee, love my coffee, and know my coffee.  This joint is all pretension - zero delivery.  I got the house's favored preparation method (pour over) on their featured star rare opportunity coffee of the day.  The ritual of making the coffee was beautiful to watch.  The coffee was served in a beautiful matched set of a custom designed wood board with a coffee snifter and a glass turkish style pourer.  (A fantastic decorating idea for your sideboard)  The coffee had overtones of void, with subtle undercurrents of zero and nothing.  It was a beautiful cup of brown water.  Worse still - the beautiful glass decanter made the coffee cool to room temperature in about 90 seconds.  So I was drinking room temperature water the whole time.  Now it was obvious from talking to the barista that he truly values a very light coffee with almost no body -  and getting this glass full of emptiness was a positive accomplishment on his part.  i can make hot water at home."}
{"text":"I'd say this is one of the best places for instagram food photos. Their plating is immaculate and colorful!  They can get quite busy for brunch and do not accept reservations. It's first come first serve so it's better to go earlier. You order food at the counter and take back a number so they can bring your order to the table.   I tried their avocado toast (typical millennial lol!) with sweet potato instead of toast and it's super delicious! Sliced avocado will be presented in a flower while mashed is less photogenic.   The portion is quite small though. I feel like I can easily finish two orders. The service wasn't the most attentive either. But I guess the food (and photo) more than makes up for it."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, I expected amazing food but again this is just another fad. Service was quite disappointing as I was asked if my friend was close prior to be seated. Another girl walked in and was seated right away yet her 3 friends were a no show for 30min.  As for the avocado toast...very blend! Lacks taste...my poached egg was not poached at all!  Quiet disappointing"}
{"text":"The only place in Toronto to go for coffee if you're serious about a good pour over. Easily the best beans come in to this cafe than any other place in the city."}
{"text":"It's hard for me to try an upscale coffee shop and not give it four stars. I liked Early Bird's flat white, but their \"market price\" for an espresso almost made me rate this place three stars. Market price? Really? You're just trying to be trendy, as the price of coffee beans does not fluctuate that much. Oh well, I'll try not to hold that against them, as I'm sure the hipsters think this place is that much cooler because of MP. My flat white was a bit small, but it was really solid.  And the staff was nice. I'd go back again, I suppose."}
{"text":"Came here at 2PM on a Wednesday and it was quite full but I was still able to snag a table :) Immediately LOVED THE VIBE of this place!!! From the neon lights, to the vines hanging on the side, to the pure white (brick) walls, to the patio at the top- If I was studying Downtown, this would be a go-to for me! With that being said I also noticed the sort of people in the cafe, they were all early twenties, either chatting away with friends or working on their MacBooks (Not a single Windows laptop in sight not kidding), and dressed well. Probably all worked in the art or business scene to be honest ahah. Not being mean but it was just an interesting observation and I was kinda intimidated LOL. ... Back to the review. So I got a cappuccino and the latte art was just beautiful. I think the coffee prices are okay?? But the food prices man! Their food, from what I see on their Insta, reminds me of Baddies- but the portions were substantially smaller? Which is why I couldn't bring myself to order anything. Eggs benny was $14, I think, with no side salad, home fries etc. I mean it's super aesthetic (bc the hollandaise sauce is pink!) as with their other foods, but oh man the price. I mean maybe it tastes amazing, but until I get paid, I don't think I can bring myself to buy the food. (I wish thought, it would look amazing on Insta)"}
{"text":"I absolutely love Early Bird. It's a pretty hipster place, but not in the pretentious sense.  It's coffee is my #1 in Toronto (to date) and the atmosphere is very laid back.  Their food is delicious - the vegan cookies are perfect with coffee. The egg/avocado sandwich is filling as a meal and chia seed pudding is so tasty (and healthy!).   I always come here to do some light reading/studying or to catch up with a friend. I wouldn't come here with a big group though."}
{"text":"A gem! This place is one of the few places that serves brunch on weekdays and past noon! Staff are friendly and inviting. You make your order and pay at the coffee bar, but the food is brought to you.  Lovely matcha latte  Cilbir: perfectly poached eggs in a refreshing sauce. Would recommend sauce on the side as an option next time!  Appreciate the sign \"no laptops 9-4\""}
{"text":"This place is great! We were in Toronto for work and play, so naturally we had some business to take care of. In an effort to complete our task list and experience the city, we setup shop in the Early Bird coffee shop in Queen West where there's a ton of great shops and vibrant people.   The long tables near huge windows that let in a ton of natural light were perfect for working in our laptops and while sipping cortados and iced Americanos.   The wifi wasn't great, but we didn't need it that much anyway. If you're trying to edit a website, this may not be the place for you."}
{"text":"Air-conditioned, clean, hipster-y spot with overpriced drinks. Decor is sparse and soothing. A good spot to get work done, read, and chat quietly."}
{"text":"I've never been much for cheating, but I feel like a cheater, going somewhere else for my morning coffee.  Forgive me, Dark Horse??  As I live literally up the street, I've been laying in wait for this coffee bar to open.  There is relatively little in the way of options for well crafted coffee on this side of Bathurst (prior to White Squirrel's 2nd location, nada), so I'm pleased to have another option that I can get to quickly.    As mentioned in previous reviews, the decor is rather coffee house typical.  Wood, cool signage on the wall, exposed brick.  I do like that the bar is in the back, and the seating does look good.  Somewhere that one really can sit and work for hours.  They have an amazing number of options for food and drink, and I was crazy tempted by these absolutely massive croissants right on the counter.  There are some super interesting coffee-makin' contraptions that, had I not been in a hurry, would have asked  to try (boo, though, to review below that mentions only certain baristas can/do operate them!  That's like telling someone after their meal to come back later for dessert, as the pastry chef has the sniffles. Actually, it's worse, unless hypothetical resto was a dessert bar.  ANYway...)  My americano was yummy, though, and I have the itch to return again for a more comprehensive go."}
{"text":"Fantastic coffee and a beautiful cafe. I met here for a work meeting that went on for 3 hours and the entire time this place was packed, which speaks to the level of fanfare it has. Despite the number of people it remained fairly quiet so would probably make a decent work space. I definitely recommend checking this place out. It's a got a pretty soothing vibe to it and you can't beat their coffee."}
{"text":"Great, friendly spot for a coffee and wifi/work session in the Queen & Bathurst area. Get here early if you want to grab one of the seats, although there is a large communal table (for 8-10) at the front. Apparently, there is a patio as well so I now have an excuse to visit in the warmer months! :)  Legit pour over coffee and tasty treats... and the requisite coffehouse soundtrack of Grizzly Bear, Animal Collective, Bon Iver, The Walkmen, etc."}
{"text":"beautiful space for studying, enjoying a drink, or chatting.  as everyone else has said, the decor hits the nail on the head for what's popular with cafes at the moment. a brick wall painted an insouciant white; wooden tables, chairs, and menu; shelving constructed with polished metal piping; succulents and various other greenery in clay pottery; exposed hanging lightbulbs; a small helping of neon signage; baristas with undercuts, caps, and relaxed demeanors; hip chillwave electro funk nu disco tropical house amalgamation background music. the environment could not be better.  some small details that really set this cafe apart: - notable edibles for sale from other popular toronto locations: coffee from pilot roasters, mast brother chocolates, and jam from kitten and the bear - donuts from glory hole donuts on fridays (and maybe other weekend days?) - beautiful publications for browsing and buying: kinfolk, drift (the only stockist in toronto!), trouv√©, and others  oh, and about their main attractions: yes, there is wifi; and, yes, the coffee here is great. want my advice? their cortado is my mainstay.  it can get kind of busy but I've never been unable to find a seat. the only note I would make is that they really get mileage out of their air conditioning! it can get a little chilly after sitting here for a while. bring a sweater, despite how silly that may sound.  definitely my favourite place to hang out during my downtime. doesn't hurt that it's right next to loblaws--come spend a few hours here, and do a little light grocery shopping on the way home!"}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast on a Saturday at 9:30 and it was already pretty busy. By 10 am, it was full. I ordered the beet eggs benny and my friend ordered the dragonfruit smoothie bowl. They were both beautiful and also so yum! The eggs benny is served with avocado on a potato patty instead of an english muffin, so it's filling and satisfying. I also got the fizzy iced tea which I would recommend- so refreshing and not too sweet at all :)   The only reason I won't give this 5 stars is because the ordering style is a bit chaotic. I guess because they were originally just a coffee shop, the order style has remained that way, but when it got busy, people waiting for their coffees were in the way of servers coming around with food.   Overall, very aesthetically pleasing food and drinks with delicious flavour to back it up!"}
{"text":"This place is alright. I was captivated by the pictures and decided to give this place a try for brunch.  When you go in, you have to hog a table and then order at the front. They'll bring the food to you but everything else, you get at the counter (drinks, doughnuts, etc). I ordered a matcha latte ($5.50), chai latte ($4.25), eggs benny ($12.50), breakfast bowl ($13.50) and a glory hole doughnut ($2.90).   From the pictures, I didn't know that this place was gonna taste so healthy (not sure if it's actually healthy). The eggs were on some sort of potato mixture instead of English muffin. This dish was very pretty to look at but there's a weird taste with some bites. Not really sure how to describe it. The salad that came with it was dressed at all and tasted so bad.   The breakfast bowl had too much quinoa and the ratio was off. My friend couldn't even finish it. I took one bite and didn't even want a second bite. It was too mushy and wet for my liking.   The drinks were great but very expensive. The matcha latte wasn't too sweet and had the true matcha taste to it. The chai latte tasted like any chai latte at any other cafes.  Lastly, the doughnut was tiny and was ok. The texture wasn't how I like it but I supposed the taste was there.   I don't think I'll be coming back here because the food was just a bit bland."}
{"text":"Another one of those increasingly-common Toronto hipster coffee places - and this isn't necessarily a bad thing! It fits into my expectations for \"hipster coffee joint\" quite well, with skilled baristas, standard range of drinks, and convenient customization options. I enjoyed my iced tea a lot and found it helpful that the barista could tell me about the different tea leaves. There is a bit of a wait for the iced tea since they brew it on the spot.  There are quite a few tables inside the space. Most of them seat two comfortably and many tables are taken by those doing work, but also not a bad place to come for a conversation with a friend!   Would recommend if you're in the area and looking for something a little more local than Starbucks."}
{"text":"Lovely little coffee shop in the Queen West area. Definitely the place where local hipsters hang out to get some work done on the weekends. The cappuccino was great; hot,  strong and flavourful. There is free WiFi. The seats are comfortable enough for a couple of hours to sit and chat or get some work done. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Terrible service. Rude staff. And disorganized check-in process. The offerings looked appealing, but we walked out due to service and a wait fiasco. They are too busy for customer service. Skip it."}
{"text":"Coffee is pretty great, and the space is nice. But the food is wildly overpriced, and it's usually impossible to get seating since people setup for the day there (not the cafe's fault though, really). It is a nice break from the chain coffees in the area, so I'd absolutely recommend it as your takeout coffee spot."}
{"text":"This place was quite quiet on a late Saturday afternoon.  I was actually a bit surprised.  Loved the simple and clean d√©cor.  Ordered an Iced Americano that was quite smokey tasting.  Was able to add dairy + simple syrup to enjoy it.  Staff was helpful, but not intrusive.  Will be back to check out back patio, more caffeinated drinks, and perhaps a treat...or 2!"}
{"text":"Came during a weekday, even then there was quite a line-up. Had the eggs benny - which was delicious! Brewed coffee was just the right strength. Great service overall, and great environment. Great study spot, however portions slightly small for the price."}
{"text":"I went for a quick bite on the weekend.  After ordering, I sat down and took up my laptop to get a bit of work done while I ate.  I was instantaneously told that they just could not have my laptop out once it got busy in the next hour.  I completely understand, and was not planning to stay long, but nothing makes you feel more unwelcome then having someone greet you on that basis.  I think having something posted rather than feeling singled out would be more palatable.  This policy apparently only applies on the weekends."}
{"text":"I love this place for a very instagramable breakfast that tastes amazing. Their eggs benny in homemade Latakas are top notch and their smashed avocado toast is beautiful with really nice rustic bread. Coffee is great too and I love the vibe. They also have no screen tables which changes the vibe of it during the day. Music is always really good too and the service is always friendly and knowledgeable. Even their protein balls are really great"}
{"text":"The eggs Benedict were amazing! I didn't add any meat to the meal. The salad was okay, the dressing had a bit of a weird after taste. As for the drinks I decided to try the Mocha, which was good. The meal overall was good but not that filling and as for the location there isn't much seating space and it is cramped, so try and avoid busy hours. I would recommend to give this place a try and would definitely go back to try a different item on the food menu."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch on a Thursday afternoon - it was so busy!! The place is a fun loft space, but I wish it were larger. Some tables are not screen/laptop-friendly. I had the falafel bowl and it was delicious! Quinoa, falafel, egg, lots of veggies, avocado... i can't imagine how crazy busy it gets on weekends. Prices are a tad high."}
{"text":"This is my new fave on QW. Best coffee and really cool space. Plus a v friendly welcome the moment I walked in. Why do peeps go to Starbucks?!"}
{"text":"I have so far discovered three truly great espressos in Toronto: Clockwork, Early Bird, and Thor."}
{"text":"The food and drinks are quite good.  The service is another story.  Let's just say if you go alone they will discourage you because they rather fill the entire table rather than have a 1/2 empty table.  Most restaurants will still accommodate single eaters.  There are 3 bar seating availability...therefore if you are there alone just tell the host that you are willing to sit there and wait for a spot to be open.  Just was not impressed with the host telling me they will not seat me because I was alone."}
{"text":"Service: it was quite busy when we went in during weekend brunch time. Most employees were busy making coffee for people waiting, took a few mins for someone to come to the cash register to take my order. (You order your drinks and food at cash counter, and they give you a number sign to bring to whatever table you find)  Food: we got the popular Eggs Benedict with beet hollandaise and green tomato Shashuka. Nothing was amazing, but not bad, EXCEPT that the eggs in my Shakshuka was undercooked :(, 30% egg whites were still transparent and slimy. But a cute spot for aesthetics and insta-worthy food!  Overall: would definitely return on days where I feel like a basic millennial craving for some hipster millennial foods!"}
{"text":"Great spot on Queen to grab afternoon coffee and a bite. My friend had a delicious chai tea latte. I ordered a matcha latte. They have a couple of tables you can work on too, but some are laptop free. Love the minimalist clean feel. Will try the food next time!"}
{"text":"Hands down my favourite coffee shop in the city. Great coffee, fair prices and now they have an entire food menu. Definitely a spot worth checking out. Would highly recommend."}
{"text":"Here's a funny story. This place opened up relatively recently and I noticed it, never made a real effort to try it out, but did want to see what it was all about. I met someone on Tinder (yeah, I know) who seemed like a nice guy but didn't really stand out for me. Nevertheless, I agreed to meet in person and he suggested Early Bird. Great! I finally get to check it out, we'll go after my volunteer shift. The day of, my shift got cancelled and I no longer had to come in so I stayed home to get some urgent work done. At noon, when we were supposed to meet, he texted me to let me know he was sitting in the back having an espresso. SH!T. I completely forgot I had this date! I apologized profusely and explained the situation and offered to make it up to him the next time (even though I wasn't really interested in the first place). But we never ended up meeting. Womp womp. So I avoided this place for a very long time due to that embarrassing memory but I'm glad I got over it because it has become my favourite place for a chai latte and a chill workspace. Solid coffee, tea, and snacks at the average indie price in a super cute space. It would have been good for a first date..."}
{"text":"I had a good experience!! I went on Saturday morning and it was very busy but was able to get a table, food came in a decent amount of time"}
{"text":"I ordered a double espresso, and tried to order a long pull but was told they only pull the regular way.  The regular espresso was sour, I believe the grind setting is too fine.  The place looks cool, is very busy but the espresso is not good."}
{"text":"Best avocado toast I ever had. Not only is the presentation beautiful but it tastes amazing. The women working in front were so helpful. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great coffee - I mean really good. Good quality wifi, welcoming staff, an a cool vibe makes this a great place to hang out for a couple of hours."}
{"text":"So far this is my favorite coffee shop in Toronto. Their latte taste so good. Strong expresso and smooth milk. Staff there are very nice and friendly. However one time i went they did fill up to the top of my cup :(.   Lots of seating and great atmosphere."}
{"text":"4.5 stars ... one of the better spots on Queen West.  Bar Buca and Strange Love are my all time favourites but Early Bird is a definite contender.   The pristine white walls, large windows, and the pop of greenery from the plants and avocado toast just makes me think its calling all millennials for those instagram moments.  Good thing it has some good drinks and flavour to make it more than just a pretty face.  We arrived early Sunday morning before brunch and most tables were already taken with many lap tops and soft quiet sips of coffee.  The barista was already heavily loaded with a back log and making his way through the line up all calm and chill.  Ordering was easy and kudos to them for having reasonably priced drinks.  With a chai latte and flat white, we waited close to 15 minutes to get our drinks but I will say that it was quite good so it didnt make it feel like it was a waste of time.  Chai Latte - Though it was a touch sweeter than most other coffee places, I did like the fact that the spice blend was nuanced and had a good punch to not make this a typical Starbucks sugary latte.  4/5  Flat White - Loved the flavour as it was bold but not too acidic.  I really liked how it had microfoam and not just a little bit of large foam on the top.  The balance of milk to espresso was just right.  The smoothness of the drink was really nice and would definitely order again.  4.5/5  One thing I also loved about this place... it sold Coffee Collective beans from Copenhagen.  I went there every day when I was visiting.  Though I'd like to see Toronto coffee spot support local Canadian roasters, I have to give Early Bird credit for choosing an awesome place like Coffee Collective!"}
{"text":"Good service, great lattes, good croissant. What more can I say? It's a coffee shop."}
{"text":"3.5 is my rating.  Charcoal latte ($4.80) I think this was a gimmick. Not sure what they used for the \"charcoal\" color but there was no charcoal like flavor in the latte at all. It just tasted like milk. Quite disappointed. Just looked pretty.  Eggs Benny ($12.50) What's special about this eggs benny? The hollandaise is pink made with beets! There is actually a small hint of beets flavor in the hollandaise, which is interestingly different cause hollandaise at most places don't have much of a taste. The egg was perfectly poached served on top of a crispy rosti and mashed avocado. This was tasty but the portion was kinda small and wasn't too filling. Comes with a salad on the side that was very refreshing.   Green rice bowl with steak ($13.50, +$5.50 for the flank steak) Fresh green kale, sliced avocado, a poached egg and a few strips of flank steak and feta cheese topped on a bowl of rice. I believe the rice was japnese rice, which made the bowl extra tasty. The sauce mixed in with the rice had a sort of lime zesty flavor which made the bowl really refreshing. Tasted healthy and delicious. Just pricey imo, given there weren't too many pieces of steak either. But the steak was cooked medium rare and flavorful!  The food was innovative and interesting. Tasty but more on the expensive side. Ordering did take a long time, we were waiting in line for 20 mins just to order food."}
{"text":"This brunch place is what you would expect a Queen St East caf√© to be like - hipster, creative and crowded during the weekends. There is some novelty factor in their menu (charcoal latte, breakfast bowl, nut-butter toast), but its the presentation of their food that is the main crowd puller.  There is one long communal table and smaller tables that seats 2-4 people and sitting is first come first serve. It can be confusing when its crowded but the rule of thumb is you order first, pay, get a number and than find a seat if you are by yourself. If you are in a group, get someone to stand in line to get a seat and then the rest in line near the counter to order."}
{"text":"I'm chalking my initial visit to Early Bird up to opening kinks. I've since been back multiple times since and have thoroughly enjoyed my coffee beverages (yes, including pourovers) and baked goods. Staff are generally warm and friendly and passionate about coffee, and interestingly enough, I haven't seen the girl who initially said that pourover wasn't available since that one day. They are now carrying Glory Hole donuts, Mast Brothers chocolate, beans from Calgary-based Phil and Sebastian Coffee Roasters (as well as Toronto-based Pilot Coffee, always), and a selection of other goodies including travel mugs and related coffee paraphernalia. My favourite place for coffee in the Queen/Bathurst area!"}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised at this little gem. Met a friend here for coffee one day and I immediately fell in love with the beautiful hardwood, exposed brick and the pour over coffee. I'm not a huge coffee connoisseur or anything but I thought the coffee was pretty good and comparable to some of the bigger independent coffee shops. Only downside is this place is quite small and completely full all the time. Would definitely come back for a pick me up whenever I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"Worst customer service EVER, the associates were super rude, they got out food wrong TWICE. And the food was tasteless and bland. Never coming to this place ever again."}
{"text":"4.5 Star  If you takes your coffee seriously, Early Bird Espresso & Brew Bar is the one.   All I want is a good coffee and it delivers! The Long Black, Macchiato, Cappuccino I tried where all prepared so well, the way I like it. The double espresso shots in my Long Black really smooth and still have nice crema.  Early Bird Espresso has all the coffee option, more than any other coffee place I been in the area.   A Cold Brew sure is the choice of drink over any \"Iced\" espresso drink on a hot day. The good thing is you can even pick up a bottle here to enjoy later at home.   Wifi, Electric Outlets, Ton of Seating, Great Vibe... But the most important reason I am coming back is for a good cup of coffee!"}
{"text":"Lovely and warm place to read, study, chat with friends. Came with Lily in a lazy morning. Latte and cakes were good"}
{"text":"Stopped by Early Bird for brunch with some friends. We came around 12pm and there was a pretty long line up. Note that its easier to find tables for group of 2 than a larger group.   Everything is paid for at the counter and you have to carry your drink back to your own table (so hard to avoid people and try to not ruin your latte art at the same time). Someone will then bring your food to your table.   I ordered a latte, the eggs benny and also an avocado toast. The eggs benny isnt a traditional one thats on a traditional english muffin but a potatoes latkes base. They also had a pink hollandaise sauce which makes the dish seem more presentable. I actually really liked it. The avocado toast was decent. It was more refreshing since they had pomegranate. My friends avocado toast was a pretty burnt though.  Overall, not a bad place but i probably would not come back and try another brunch place in the area."}
{"text":"This may be an unpopular opinion, but I wasn't a huge fan of this place and found it kind of gimmicky. I was drawn in by the beautiful photos I'd seen on Instagram, and visually, Early Bird delivered. Despite the visual appeal though, I found the taste of the food somewhat lacking, and overall overpriced for what you get. I got the ever-popular eggs benny - two poached eggs served on potato latkes with smashed avocado, a side salad, and the most gorgeous, bright pink, beet Hollandaise sauce you could ever imagine. If only it tasted as good as it looked. Everything to me just seemed kind of bland, without any kind of seasoning or distinctive flavours coming through. The Hollandaise was probably the most disappointing because there was barely any distinctive beet flavour at all. I also didn't find it to be that filling, and was left feeling kind of unsatisfied after paying $12.50 for the dish.  My friend wanted the avocado toast because the avocado is presented like a rose - she said it was fine but noted it was difficult to eat because of the thickness of the toast and how high the avocado was piled on. Worried that she wouldn't be full off one piece of toast (for $9), she also got the chia pudding bowl, which again, looked lovely... but she reported that it had no taste.  The ambiance is like your typical hipster coffee shop, which is cool, but I feel like doesn't make it the most comfortable environment for a sit-down brunch. It's particularly not that great for large groups - most tables are meant to fit four people at most, and my group of 6 had to pull up a few extra chairs and squish together.  I can't fault the shop for doing anything wrong, and I appreciate that they are trying to do a healthier kind of brunch, but maybe the bougie millennial healthy life thing is just not for me. Ultimately, here your camera will feast, and your eyes will feast, but your stomach will be left wanting."}
{"text":"Great food at a reasonable price. Beer is chilled too! Would visit here again. Found on yelp close to my apartment and pictures"}
{"text":"Early Bird is an inviting environment to work/study. The cafe is filled with modern vibe with tranquil decor. Like other fellow Yelpers had reported, Early Bird is a living Pinterest board - white brick walls, neon blue sign, tropical plants, etc.    I was impressed by how packed Early Bird is at 10:00 am on a Saturday. It is a true testament to their approach to healthy breakfast options including rainbow-coloured chai pudding,  vibrant granola with greek yogurt, and bright overnight oats. I love a display case filled with colourful and nutritionally balanced juices and jars of gluten free treats.  The cappuccino was masterfully crafted with coffee art. It was presented on a wooden tray with a teaspoon at the side.   Hipster be ware. Space can be a tight in this little cafe. As well, it may be a little chilly in the winter time."}
{"text":"Nice cafe to sit down to a coffee and do work to. Americano cost $3.10, a bit pricey but it's good coffee. Not much in the way of dessert selection.   The environment is nice; exposed ceiling and brick with clean lines give it an old industrial feel with a modern touch."}
{"text":"The decor in here is on point and the food looks pretty (didnt try the food though). Kinda disappointed because we came here to study (saw that this was a good study place on a toronto blog) but definitely not the right atmosphere for studying. Half of the tables were reserved for 'dining and chit chatting'/no laptops. Also the drinks are kinda expensive.. got an Americano for $3.6 and it was pretty average compared to other ones I had. Maybe would come back to try the food another day though."}
{"text":"A year ago, I loved Early Bird as it used to be a phenomenal coffee shop that was *also* very remote-work friendly, free wi-fi, cozy-vibe (which is a rare thing to find). Their drinks are still decent and affordable, the staff is really friendly and unpretentious.  But now, the seats are reserved for \"non-laptop\" users between 9am-4pm, there are no outlets, the Wi-Fi is unusable (Google takes 45 seconds to load and tops out at 7kb/s) and limited to 1hr. I know I'm a very specific type of customer, but I am really disappointed with this change."}
{"text":"WHAT TO TRY?!  Having seen what others order and what I've tried, I would definitely recommend the egg Benedict with the beets sauce on top, the breakfast bowl and if you're a fan of the avocado, then the avocado toast too.   I ordered the avocado toast. I think other than the presentation of the avocado on top, it's really easy to make and not worth the $9 for this dish. Yes, the presentation of the avocado on top is pretty but hey, if you don't mind presentations, then making this at home is quite easy!  The breakfast bowl was delicious though. With the mix of quinoa, the tasty kale, some yams for sweetness and some beans, it was just the right combination of healthy vegetables and you felt good afterwards! Because it's not heavy at all.   I saw a lot of ppl ordering the eggs Benedict with the beet sauce so it must a popular breakfast dish here. And besides, it's pretty to look at too.   LAST TIP?!  They don't open for dinner so don't expect to grab a bite here. There's no reservations and you order yourself at the counter. There's one communal table so if your group is small, be prepared to sit at the communal table if other tables are taken. Order their lattes and coffees too. Pretty art design on top too."}
{"text":"I'm a regular at early bird. The coffee is superb a little expensive but most coffee shops in Toronto are.  It's always busy and it's a nice space. Service is friendly and quick"}
{"text":"Always good coffee here.  I go in when I have a chance to try the weekly specialty coffee they bring in."}
{"text":"Go to the patio upstairs, it's super cute! I ordered the avocado toast (sliced) and my friend had the beets eggs Benedict.   I found the avocado toast beautiful, but it was hard to actually eat. Do you cut it? Do you hold it? Neither worked for me. The bread felt a little stale/hard and had a weird spicy kick at the end. They also didn't give us any water."}
{"text":"Let's be real, you only come to a place like this for two reasons:   1) You're a total hipster  2) You want the 'grams #duh #instaworthy  Other than the nice presentation, the food itself is so mediocre. My friends and I shared the Eggs Benny, Avocado Toast, and the Breakfast Sandwich. All were a solid 5/10.   We also ordered a normal latte and a Beet Latte. My god the Beet Latte was disgusting AF. I normally like beets, but this was some weird ass wannabe healthy beet coffee concoction. DO. NOT. ORDER.   So get this, the set up here is weird. You wait in line for a seat, then when you finally snag a tiny table, you have to go to the back cash to order your food and pay for your meal then. You wait 25+ mins for your cold food, eat, and then leave...with a guilty feeling like you dined and dashed when you really didn't. It's like part full service -- without the tip?  Unless you come here just for the #grams, there are a lot yummier brunch places than Early Bird. And they're probs a little less hipster fresh."}
{"text":"Feel the need to update and say:  +Now serving beautiful snacks, like their avocado toast, until 4pm +Now with wine and beer"}
{"text":"Loved the atmosphere and menu and will definitely go back. I only had coffee when I went since I didn't realize they have brunch options (that said, everything that came to the tables next to me looked super tasty!). If you are looking for an insta-worthy brunch pic, I would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Food and drinks have great presentation. Slightly more pricey but you're paying for the aesthetics of both the meal and the atmosphere. Minimalist and easy on the eyes, reminds me of any coffee shop picture you could find on instagram trending. Not too many seats, but understandable as the building is small."}
{"text":"I am in love with this place.  There are tons of seating but it's always full, unfortunately. They do lose a lot of customers because they can't find a seat among the laptop workers, book readers, dates, and even Skype dates hogging up the tables here.   This is also where my favourite latte lives.  The staff are fantastic. They make you a drink very fast and with love.   This is easily my #1 place to work and study: - Even with so many people, it doesn't get loud. Music is softly playing and it's not the annoying \"I need to block it out\" type.  - Wifi works ALL the time and is reliable (Starbucks and R Squared, wtf is wrong with your wifi man). - Again, the staff is amazing. I haven't encountered a bad barista yet... - It's warm and toasty except by the door... At other small, local coffee shops, their windows are leaking the snowy air, so where can I sit that isn't cold?? I can't sit by the door, I can't sit by the window (in your small little shop, everywhere is close to the window). Really, nobody can study (aka focus) in the cold!!! At Early Bird, there is a door (cold) but 5 steps inside the shop is warm and toasty. - The tables are spaciously placed, I don't get hit by people and their winter jackets when they get up and out. You know how some people like to flail their scarves and jackets when they put them on. Come on friends, why? It doesn't make you wear them faster.  Sorry Queen West folks, I also hog a table here for hours. I'd like to believe I fit right in with my beanie hat and my macbook. The decor is adorable featuring neon light \"Early Bird\", white-painted brick wall (used to be NOT painted), wooden tables and chairs, but there's a downside: the one-and-only washroom (clean. But still)"}
{"text":"This place is like a real life Pinterest board, it's almost too beautiful. But I'm not complaining, especially when the coffee is absolutely incredible. The pastries are good too.  I have a few minor complaints though. The pour over is good, but they serve it in a poorly-insulated glass and decanter, so that it's cold within minutes. Not that I necessarily mind lukewarm coffee, since I find it allows you to taste different aspects of the coffee. I just wish the first cup would stay hot. It's also very crowded and there are only two power outlets, which makes it a bit inconvenient at times.  That said, it is a wonderful place to do work if you can get a good spot. It remains one of my favourite spots in Toronto."}
{"text":"Best flat white I've had in a long, long time.  The spot is chic and minimal at the same time. Not the best for big groups, though there were lots of people working or catching up with a friend.   One of the baristas seemed a little disinterested, but I don't care. The flat white was golden. My friend, who is a vegan, said the vegan flat white (with soy milk) was particularly great."}
