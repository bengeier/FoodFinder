{"text":"Would give this place a lower rating if I could. We visited tonight when they were outside of Biddle's Escape. After waiting in line for 20 minutes and then for an additional half hour after ordering, I was starting to get a little hangry but thought the wait would be worth it for a delicious taco. But I wouldn't know because I never got to eat that taco. Instead, the owner took nearly an hour after my placing an order to tell me that they had run out of food to serve. Why he could not predict this any sooner is a mystery. Like any millennial in this day and age, I came home to post a gripe on their facebook page and he deleted my comment. No apologies or promise of future delicious tacos, just blatant denial that he had disappointed many hungry people that night. Will never order from there again and will not hesitate to tell everyone what an awful experience I had. To the owner - sincere apologies and promises to make it right will get you a lot further with your customers."}
{"text":"Reasonably priced authentic Mexican street food. Burritos packed with spinach, rice, meat, peppers, guac and potatoes. Yes, potatoes. Much filling. Paired with a pint from Dancing Gnome, their food was spot on. Muchas gracias!"}
{"text":"Food was fresh and delicious. I got the chicken quesadilla and couldn't finish it all. The little side of guac that came with it was so good. I love chunky guac. Staff was very friendly. Definitely worth the price."}
{"text":"BEST TACOS IN PITTSBURGH RIGHT NOW...SERVED BY THE HIPPEST HIPSTERS YOU'LL EVER MEET 

Hi Loves! 

I'm basically full time living in Brew Gents & being fed by food trucks when I'm there! 

I will stalk this trucks website and find it when I can because their tacos are so righteous. 

Their steak tacos are citrus marinated with a great bed of spinach & fresh avocado. It's such a fresh bold flavor even in the middle of winter.

They have square so I can max out my Visa on drunk taco purchases. 

AND ....these two guys are FLY! Straight outta Brooklyn meets Brazil - someone needs to do a fashion spread on them cause they are on fleek as their tacos are tasty! 

DOUBLE POINTS WORD SCORE for using \"on fleek\" in a food review  ;) 

Love You! muah!"}
{"text":"These Jokers want to raise the price of a measly vegan burrito to $10 Goddamn dollars?? Are you kidding me EL CABRON??? 
Fuc√ók this place. A shame because I used to enjoy their food.
I'd like to see you imbeciles survive in any other city (esp a west coast city) 
with that price hike, with your puny food truck .
Only in Pittsburgh, land of the pathetically naive .."}
{"text":"Pretty friggin awesome! Had the veggie burrito. Packed with potatoes, spinach, and rice. Light on the cheese, which I like. The tortilla was nice, warm and soft. The chefs were friendly and jovial. Food came out fast, even though they were busy. Definitely a food truck we'll follow and visit again."}
{"text":"I'm always up for trying a new food truck.  Especially after I've had a few beers.  So when a food truck is parked in front of a local brewery, it goes without saying that they will get my business.  Such was the case with Brassero Grill Food Truck.

I read over the other reviews and decided to order the Chorizo Burrito.  I was on my way home so I asked for the burrito to be wrapped to go.  It wasn't, which is part of the reason for a lower rating.  However the wait was not long and they were not out of food as others have complained about.  My burrito did smell delicious and I couldn't wait to devour it when I got home.  The chorizo was very tasty, nice and flavorful.  Also wrapped in this tortilla was a generous portion of potatoes, rice and spinach.  It seemed like a bit much with the carbs but it was a very filling burrito.  At $8, I didn't feel like it was a rip off.  If I come across the Brassero Grill Truck again though I may go with a different selection."}
{"text":"I just ordered 2 steak burritos and a steak quesadilla from the Brassero Grill truck at the Grist House Brewery and it took them over an hour! The food is good but the wait and high prices aren't worth it.

**Edit : The team at Brassero reached out to me and offered me a full refund plus lunch or dinner on them the next time I visit the truck. I'm very impressed with their customer service and will absolutely give them another chance! :)"}
{"text":"I visited the Brassero Grill food truck after a Beer + Yoga event at The Brew Gentleman on a Sunday afternoon. I had been meaning to try their food and was excited to see them at the brewery. I was accompanied by my mom and aunt, who are both not a fan of spicy food and the nice gentlemen at Brassero Grill were more than happy to accommodate them. My mom had a veggie quesadilla, I had one as well and my aunt had a deconstructed burrito. The food was SO fresh. I loved the guacamole- it was very fresh with lots of lime and red onion in it. My mom and aunt loved their food as well. I am excited to come back - they told me they are at the Brew Gentleman every Thursday (I believe) so I am def planning on coming back ASAP."}
{"text":"I really wish I could review their food, but I can't because they F***ING RAN OUT IN HALF AN HOUR. Although they only had enough food to give the customers that arrived in the first half hour their orders, they continued taking orders for another 30 or 40 minutes. Then they announced that they were no longer taking orders and had run out of food. So we thought \"wow that was close!\"  NOPE... 20 minutes later they told us they didn't have enough food for us either even though we had already ordered (along with 15 other people). On top of all that The attendant apologize a little bit for what it happened, but eventually got an attitude as customers got frustrated and eventually said \"I don't need this!\" Neither do we, sir; we need tacos. Very disappointed since I heard the food was good, but the business is very poorly managed. If I could somehow give them a negative one star review I would for the hour of my life they took.


PS: I write this from the drive-through at Wendy's, because they don't run out of food."}
{"text":"I was cautious after reading other reviews, but this was a great option at Brew Gentlemen in Braddock! We ordered a chicken taco, a potato taco, the chicken quesadilla, and a chicken burrito. Interestingly enough, between the three of us we each had a different favorite. The burrito had potatoes in it - which was interesting at first but I really liked it! One friend thought the quesadillia was the best (which I loved too!), and the third one in our party loved the chicken taco (she likes less spice, so that is the way to go for you folks who don't enjoy all the flavors!) The potato taco felt very Pittsburgh! It was good, but because it was a little more bland I likely wouldn't get it again.

They also have a spicy sauce that was a great addition to the burrito - I'd definitely ask for a side of that when you order.

The guys in the truck were very friendly and gave us great service. I'll definitely be hitting them up again soon!"}
{"text":"Just as what was in store for biblical fucking Job, all good things must come to an end.  We decided to get Brassero while we waited for Draai Laag to open.  Ordered the same only to be educated that these cats suddenly raised their prices to $10/burrito.  Just not worth the bread anymore.  But that's cool.  You don't have to be a native to whip up your own awesome burritos.  But you still can enjoy the influx of Californians that makes your home equity rise.  

Ese, you couldn't survive in Zocalo by screwing your supporters.  Why do it here?"}
{"text":"Food was fantastic, tasty and filling!  Fresh ingredients, friendly  customer service...worth the price. Best Guac around!  I had the chorizo quesadilla and my friend had the veggie tacos.  Good stuff! Eat there in a very clean environment or take out to Brew Gentlemen for a craft and carryout meal!"}
{"text":"My favorite food truck just opened their first restaurant... so you know I had to go on opening night... and as suspected, they did NOT disappoint! 

The food was amazing as always (freshest ingredients ever!) and the restaurant is adorable. Clean and minimal in design and two familiar faces cooking up excellent food in the kitchen! The best part... now I can have Brassero whenever I want... without having to stalk the truck! 

I did notice the price increase, but it won't stop me from becoming a regular. The food is that good.   

PRO TIP: order your burrito \"naked\" for a burrito bowl lined in fresh spinach!"}
{"text":"Great place! Food was served quick and was outstanding! I opted for a chorizo burrito. Very very good! Big and flavorful. The guacamole is homemade and maybe best I've ever tried. Can't wait to go back and try the tacos!"}
{"text":"My boy Pat says this truck is the tits. And this dude knows his food and his tits. Best believe that when youre snacking at this truck youll be creaming your jeans and panties. Pound out a kielbasa burrito then jump off a bridge cause your life will have reached its peak"}
{"text":"Great veggie quesadilla, great service. The food was very flavorful and authentic, and everyone was very nice. No issues with the time it took for our order. Enjoyed their food while they were parked at East End Brewing - awesome!"}
{"text":"Ordered food tonight from the Brassero food truck at Brew GentleMen. I loved everything about it!! My chicken quesadilla was the best I have ever had and my husband ordered the chicken burrito and he enjoyed his food too, it was worth the wait! I will definitely be keeping my eye out for this food truck again! The guys working there were all very pleasant and friendly"}
{"text":"I'm beyond excited that my favorite food truck in Pittsburgh is now a restaurant! They have the best quesadilla I've ever had (seriously what is that SAUCE?!) and the owners are so incredibly sweet. Perfect place to grab some food and enjoy with an awesome beer at Brew Gentlemen. I'll be back here often"}
{"text":"The chicken burrito I had here was very tasty. There weren't many people in line so I got my food fairly quick, but I could see how it might take awhile when it's busy."}
{"text":"Their food is absolutely incredible!  Every ingredient is fresh and homemade, even their chorizo.  I specifically mention the chorizo, because it is the best I've ever tasted.  Steak seems to be their biggest seller for obvious reasons.  It's cooked perfectly.  Their jalapeno potatoes are what set these guys apart from the rest.  After my third visit to their truck, I can vouch for their consistency.  I finally had the opportunity to talk with Fernando and Victor on a day they weren't bombarded by patrons.  They're very nice and seem to really enjoy what they do.  It shows in the quality of their product."}
{"text":"My family attends church in Braddock. Upon seeing the new restaurant,  especially one that offers all of our favorites; quesadillas,  burritos,  and tacos, we couldn't wait to give this place a try. The inside is a nice and chill space. Very clean and comfortable. The food had good flavor, however it was not worth the price. I got the steak quesadilla which was $10. It was An okay portion, not enough to really share. My husband ordered a chicken burrito which was also  $10. While he typically loves meat, the burrito proved to be disappointing as it was overloaded with potatoe and fresh spinach. He wasn't opposed to the ingredients but extremely dispointed to have a sprinkle of finely chopped chicken which was not evenly distributed throughout the burrito. Getting a meat burrito, one would anticipate a decent portion of meat, not one filled with potatoes. The service was not friendly. Unlike another couple which dined that evening,  we were not greeted nor provided a salutation even after saying thank you on the way out. We had high hopes and were very disappointed"}
{"text":"They always have quite the wait but it's worth it every time. It's not their fault that people know great food. On that note,  I asked for a veggie quesadilla and they put some kind of potatoe on there that blew me away. I can never finish their whole quesadilla but I always want to."}
{"text":"Tonight was my second time experiencing the Brassero Grill food truck. I purposely went this time because the quesadilla is top notch. It takes time, but that is because it is made to order and very fresh. Yes, they tend to run out of stuff as the night goes on, but what good food truck doesn't? Fantastic food and would get it again."}
