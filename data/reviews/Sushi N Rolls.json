{"text":"This is my go-to lunch spot, I've been several times, and the service and good quality of the food is consistent. Love the Bibimbap here- they have a huge variety of veggies that you get to choose from, made to order, and a choice of brown, black or white rice. Also you can choose your sauce (spicy, medium, mild) or salad dressing. You can get a fried egg and seaweed sprinkled on top. I've tried Bibimbap several other places And this place wins!  The prices are a steal for the neighborhood, super friendly service as well. The k-pop videos on the TV are also quite entertaining. ;)"}
{"text":"Though the menu has limited options for office lunch hour, they are fast, and they have a really tasty salmon sashimi seafood bibim rice bowl (no egg in this bowl, but there is egg in the beef/tofu/chicken option). You have an unlimited option of veggie toppings for your bowl and a choice of sweet to spicy sauce (some kind of Sriracha/Korean red sauce mix).

The total came to almost $13 which is pricey considering no drink/soup/salad comes with the bowl so you have to buy an additional bottle of something (unless you want to go and eat back at your desk).

Location of shop is nice because it's near Berczy park's fountain so you can sit outside for lunch.

*Store not wheelchair/stroller friendly or accessible because there is 1 step up to the door."}
{"text":"For a random sushi place in my office building the sushi here is pretty good. I've hit these guys twice for their end of day sale. So I haven't really had a huge choice, but the things I've tried have been tasty. You can't go wrong with 25% off either."}
