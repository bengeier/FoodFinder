{"text":"We picked up a half duck and a half pound of roast pork for an impromptu lunch while shopping at a nearby Star lobster seafood.  

The roast pork tasted so much like a ham and although the skin was nice and crispy, the hammy tasting meat just didn't cut it for me.  

The duck was probably one of the worst I've had in a while, not a lot of meat and lots of gristle.  

We also picked up some soy tofu and that was probably the best thing we bought.  

If I'm in the mood for Chinese BBQ, I'll go back to my old favorite Pink Hong around the corner."}
{"text":"Went for lunch today and found this Chinese BBQ place. The interior is unassuming, with four tables and six chairs in total. They have been a fixture in this plaza for many years though this was my first time there. My girlfriend ordered the bbq duck with \"lai fun\" and I had the bbq duck and roast pig on rice (you get a choice of soya milk or soup with your orders). The portion sizes were modest though I felt the meat was thinly sliced and didn't have a lot of depth. The flavours for me were quite bland and not as strong as other bbq restaurants in the area; there is a lot of rice though not too much sauce. The owners were quite friendly though and excellent service was provided. I might be back."}

Ka Wor Yuen BBQ probably not the best tasting BBQ shops in Scarborough, but sometimes it is more than just how good the food taste that makes or break one experience..... 

Ka Wor Yuen is another hole in the wall place with small sit in area, sticky floors, grayish tiles where they were once sparkling white... and the smell.. that smell of meat and soy sauce and you definitely knows something is cooking and you smell like a piece of meat afterwards... 

BBQ Pork and Roasted Duck with Rice and soy drink ($4.60) 
- I request half rice portion and the nice smiley lady start worrying that I might be hungry..so she gave me extra veggie (she did not realize this is going to be my snack after dinner!)
- The nice smiley man preparing my meat surprisingly gave me the duck's leg (which is $1 surcharges) for free... 
- When I ate my meat loaded snack at home, I wish everyone can be that nice! :) 
- The Duck's leg of course was awesome, not too fatty but still nice and tender 
- BBQ pork was A-OK too.. a little dry but I did request the leaner meat

Just love small business like Ka Wor Yuen that I deal with the owners... where they really care about their business and make sure they make all their customers happy!
