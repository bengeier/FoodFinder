{"text":"This place is so cute and it feels like you've stepped into a real Pakistani methai shop! It's small and sweet. Very reasonable pricing. The methai is tooooo good - I especially love their chocolate barfi, a perfect hybrid between an authentic & traditional Pakistani sweet with a western favorite! Their samosas are also delicious (aloo). The staff is very nice and friendly. They really treat you like family here!"}
{"text":"Good chicken samosa but they don't honor their food reservations.
I have placed an order, got a verbal confirmation. Drove there and they told me to wait another 40 mins. Terrible experience."}
{"text":"Loveee all of their food from sweets to savoury:) 

They always have fresh food ! Customer service is great too . Definitely recommend it. 

The only thing they can improve on is their samosa fillings the don't put good amount of filling."}
{"text":"This is a very nice clean set up, nicest place for veggie samoosa. Sweets alway fresh and good."}
{"text":"They were killing it with sales but opened up Bismillah Sweets near heartland. Seems like they have opened up the second location to heartland to bank on it. Well more choices the better or the consumer. 

They carry both the veg and non veg samosas. The samosas are nice, crispy, crunchy and have a nice kick to it. They also sell various sweets/ Methae, Namak para (Namak para is a crunchy savoury snack of Pakistan) and Pakoras. All goodness!!!

For my Muslim folks - the non veg samosas are halal"}
{"text":"Okay folks this is the place where you can get Pakistani samosas at its best. They were killing it with sales but now there is Bismillah Sweets near heartland as well. Indian samosas are good but they are not the same.

I have carry both the veg and non veg samosas. The samosas are nice, crispy, crunchy and have a nice kick to it. They also sell various sweets/ Methae, Namak para (Namak para is a crunchy savoury snack of Pakistan) and Pakoras. All goodness!!!

{"text":"Excellent samosas, jaleebi and mithai....going there for over a decade. Their milk cake and laddos are delicious. Be prepared for a bit of wait during weekends and holidays."}
{"text":"I love burfi. Like, love love love burfi. So when I had a sudden craving for it last night, I googled forever trying to find a place close by to get some. Apparently the pickings are slim in West Mississauga (or you all are keeping your best places hush hush!), but luckily I found Pak Sweets.

Seems like a newly opened sister store to the one on Dundas, but the samosas and sweets are on point! Their opening specials include 3 veggie samosas for $1 and 2 chicken samosas for $1 - you can't go wrong. They've also got a beautiful assortment of mouth watering sweets. The service is fantastic too, they're patient and take time to explain the different varieties they have.

I will gladly come back here for more sweets and samosas any day of the week!"}
{"text":"Top class samosas. Sweets at their best. Usual spot for such items. Interestingly, I asked a few other places, if they made it themself. To my taste buds, two of them mentioned that they get their samosa supplies from this place. Chicken samosas anytime!"}
{"text":"Not sure why there are no reviews if this place. If you like Indian sweets, this is the place to go. Fresh and delicious and authentic. I've been to so many other sweets places and they don't match up to the quality that you get here!"}
{"text":"My family always gets samosas from pak sweets!!! The samosas are so good and the people are really nice they cook the samosas right there and they give you a sweet dipping sauce. We typically get the vegetarian samosas just because we like the flavour. Last week I ordered 20 samosas to take to school for the other staff members and everyone asked where they came from. It was very cheap only cost $7 or $8 for all of them which is amazing!!"}
{"text":"I was quite excited to see this place when it opened as I've heard great things about their samosas and sweets, sadly my expectations weren't met during my visit. I ordered some chicken samosas and I was greatly disappointed with what I received. While they were pretty cheap at $2 for 1, I guess you get what you pay for. The chicken had a slightly \"off\" smell to them and almost tasted undercooked. I wasn't given any of the proper accompaniments since they apparently ran out. Regardless of this, service was okay; what you'd expect from a place like this and nothing more. I might go back to try some of their sweets, but in terms of their samosas I would stay away."}
{"text":"I ordered 75 samosas for a party and was very disappointed with what we received. So I was all for this place until we received re-fried hard samosas. You could taste the oil and literally see all that excess coming off on to plates and napkins. We called them to let them know and they denied it and said they didn't give customers re-fried samosas. They need to work on handling complaints and listen to their customers. I have been a customer for a number of years and sad to say will not be returning nor referring anyone to this place."}
{"text":"(4.5/5) - I subtracted .5 due to the wait times. 

No doubt this is the ABSOLUTE BEST place to get samosas and South Asian sweets in Mississauga. Every single experience I have had here has been positive, and what I admire is that the samosas are always warm and fresh. The difference in quality between the samosas here and at your regular South Asian grocery is enormous - since Pak Sweets is relatively busy, it is constantly making multiply batches each day. Similarly, the Mithai is always very good (all my guests also agree!!), it has a nice soft, yet strong taste. 

My only objection is that if you're in a hurry then don't bother stopping by here; sometimes there is a line up outside the door, and only one cashier is present. Also, if you ever get 2-3 customers ordering samosas in a line; the wait time exponentially increases (they make samosas on the spot). May I strongly suggest bringing out a second cashier?

Overall, this place is a hidden gem for South Asian snacks, the Mithai and Samosas are to die for - just ensure yourself that you are comfortable waiting 10-15 minutes if there is a line up!"}
