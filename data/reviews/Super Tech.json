{"text":"This place is the absolute worst. We don't eve need to talk about their service, taste of food or drink. This place lacks of the very basic decency and hygiene! My friends and I went to this place twice. The first time one of my friends got food poisoned. And the second time, 5/10 of my friends got a very serious flu, me included!!! 

Seriously!? If your food has gone bad, throw it out, don't serve to the customers! If any of your servers/employees got sick, don't let them come to work. Otherwise instead of serving food and drinks, YOU ARE SERVING DISEASES!!!

Come on! I won't go back to this place again. It's a virus nest. If you want to get sick, be my guest!"}
{"text":"I came here once a week. They provide space for large group of people to play board games. There is a minium cost for room around $200 (the room vould fit 16 people). 
Do not have high expectation to their food and drinks. The focus point is to enjoy board game. 
Service was ok."}
