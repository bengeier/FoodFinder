{"text":"I've gotta say, \"love it\". My girlfriend and I were looking for a place close to home to enjoy a good pizza and cocktails. We found it. We've tried several different items on the menu and have enjoyed the freshness of them all but the salad is so fresh that we will go just for it. Bummer about the 21 and up but too bad. There's up-chuck e cheese for that. This is a big kid's hang out and super chill. I totally get that that this isn't the hut or demono's pizza and thank god for that. This is an old school sit down, wind down and enjoy the moment pizzaria. Good food, good atmosphere, good drinks,  good times...."}
{"text":"Just generally blah up in here. Tap beer tastes weird. Bar tender broad generally unfriendly, not a good sign for a neighborhood bar around here. Machines are super tight... can't even play to much. It's weird because I feel like I can win at certain spots and then there is spots like this, not even fun. Maybe I'm paranoid but me thinks not. No one in here at all food taking forever and money gone haha not good"}
{"text":"Family owned and the Best pizza and Italian food in Henderson. It's great to go a place that they remember you and you get a warm greeting. 

Don't get me started on the Grinders. AWESOME. 

Pizza is KILLER. 

GREAT to have a bar that serves food and NO KIDS. 

They have a AWESOME location on boulder I take the kids too but nice to have a Grown up escape that you can enjoy a handcrafted cocktail and delicious food and be treated like a member of their family. If you haven't been you must. ADULTS ONLY. But so glad water st has more going on now."}
{"text":"Ordered cheese pizza & beer. Pizza was soggy, so we rolled it up and ate soggy pizza rolls. Worst we've ever had. Never saw server til she brought our check. Thought the food was scary. Then I saw the check. We'll never go back."}
{"text":"Went for the first time on 8/29/17 with some friends for Trivia Night. Lots of people in attendance. All the food looked good, I had chicken wings which were good. Service was good. Bathrooms clean. The other customers were friendly. Felt nice being in a local joint that wasn't uptight or dumby. Great place."}
{"text":"Bad service , they were more interested in selling booze than food won't be returning again ever"}
{"text":"Terrible service, and the place was close to empty, employees that don't care, even when I voiced my dissatisfaction. Decent menu, I would have liked to try several things but doubt I'll be back to try anything else. I've been on the other side of the customer service industry for too long, and there are other places with good food and integrity."}
{"text":"We ordered take out tonight at 7:19 and received our order at 7:55.  My fiancé ordered the 9.99 take out special and a gyro from the bartender.  While he waited, he was asked several times if he would like a drink by the same bartender, but no one ever checked on the food.  When we got it home, 2 streets away, the food was cold and the cheese was chewy.

I called the manager to let him know about the situation because you can't fix what you don't know is broken and we didn't want anyone else to have this experience.  Needless to say, that didn't go so well. The manager was too busy questioning the validity of what I said and assuming no one knew why my fiancé was there for over a half an hour, including the bartender that took his order, to show any concern.  Even though we were EXTREMELY excited about their arrival and the owner is very nice, we won't be returning.

I'm not saying you shouldn't try their food, but if you don't get treated with courtesy and respect, know that it isn't an isolated incident."}
{"text":"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this place. Great food, fun atmosphere, staff is always nice, they serve up a strong drink, adult friendly neighborhood bar/restaurant to make new friends or hang out with old ones. Best damn karaoke place to go to on a Saturday night of fun for sound in ALL of Las Vegas and Henderson."}
{"text":"This place just opened up and I've already found a new spot. This place is absolutely amazing! The sunset pizza is mouth watering and it definitely made me feel like a ninja turtle, if you catch my drift. The pitcher for miller lite is 8 bucks and on happy hour from 4pm to 7pm is 6 bucks well damn I'm definitely happy. The people are super friendly and great sense of humor and the owner is very humble and nice. You really can't go wrong or complain about this place! I recommend it I don't care how far I am."}
{"text":"The center of the Water Street District in downtown Henderson is alive again! The owners of Sunset Pizzeria just opened Sunset Downtown! 

This place has a totally different vibe than their other restaurants. For one thing it's 21 AND OVER ONLY.

Smoking is allowed. Good for smokers...not so good for those who don't like it..so just heads up.  

Full bar service and gaming coming soon. Mike, the owner was telling us they are installing video poker machines.

Location: Water Street across from the Henderson Convention and Events Center. So there's street parking or you can park at the lot across the way.

The menu is slightly different from their pizzerias. They serve burgers, gyros, Philly Steaks, Italian Grinders, pasta dishes, strombolis here. And of course their same great pizza and chicken wings!

Prices are slightly higher I believe. There's no family meal deals or those coupon ones they have going at their other places. I did see they have dedicated everyday lunch specials listed and pick-up deal for large cheese pizza $9.99 listed on the front cover of their menu.

Did I mention there's no kiddos here? This place caters to an older crowd with smoking drinking and gaming, so dont bother bringing your family here. Or don't be butt hurt if they won't let you in if you are under 21. Just drive(or have your parents drive) 5 more minutes to their location on Boulder Hwy. 

The set up is pretty hip. Definitely an 80's rock vibe. ZZtop was playin.  Dining area setup with booths along the windows that wrap Water St and Atlantic. Tables for 4 in the middle and seating at the bar. Can't speak about the bar since I dont really drink much. 

The staff was friendly. Service was good. Seat yourself.  The menus are already on the table. Our server took our drink order and came back to take our dinner order. Pizza for Mr. B and Eggplant Parmesan for me.  The pasta dinners come with a side salad and garlic bread. My pasta dinner was a huge portion. Very cheesey, but I felt so much pasta drowned out my eggplant. Still good stuff! 

We enjoyed our meal. It was nice not to have to dodge around kids, not that it's turnoff or anything but a nice change. I already have local neighborhood friends who want to make this a destination for after work meetup/hangout. It's going to be the locals downtown hotspot!"}
{"text":"I really liked the atmosphere here.  Finally a pizza place that's NOT crawling with kids!  The pizza was just right and they have a great selection of craft brew.  I usually get beer but for some reason I was feeling winey and I just had the house pino. Not bad for a house wine.  The waitress was a little busy and I could tell she was overwhelmed so I forgave her for being a little inattentive. She was nice when it calmed down, and I've been there."}
{"text":"Well were do I start.  We walked in and looked at the sign for the specials and I commented about happy hour and the waitress frowned at me.  As we sat down we asked if budlight was on tap.  The waitress said no only in bottle so mu husband asked what was on tap and she said she didnt know.  I asked whatbthe house wine was and she said she doesnt work at the bar so she.sisnt know.

We ordered our drinks and she brought them to us, we werent ready as thia was our first time there.  We said we needed a couple more minutes,  so she asked us if we were going to just drink and not eat?????

 Then we figured out what we wanted and she didnt understand me when I asked if I could order the small 1 topping pizza and add extra topping.  She then left and had to come back two more times to ask what type of toppings.  Sausage and mushroom.  How hard is that?  She kept asking if we wanted pepperoni??  

Dont get the ketchup cause it looks like bbq sauce, definitely not Heinz.   

Well we finally got our medium wings and fries.  If you like hot you better order extra hot.  No spice for the medium. 

10 mins later came back to ask if we ordered pepperoni or sausage pizza.  Needless to say she hadnt had the pizza made yet.  We got out pizza and guess what kind?  Pepperoni and mushroom.......  she then let us know if we needed anything else because she was going to sit down and eat.  My husband didnt eben get a refill of his coke.  

15 min later she came back and started clearing our table and dhe sure made sure she snatched up her tip because she said that she was leaving and made sure we knew that.  And I didnt want to give a tip but husband left one.  I would of picked it back up off table when he left but she had already snatched it up.lol  Oh n the pizza wasnt that great.  Hardly any sauce on it.
NEVER AGAIN
Waitress needs to work on knowing her job."}
{"text":"One of the best places to hang out and drink in Henderson! I've been coming here since it opened but I never reviewed this bar. All the bartenders are great but I wanted to write this review because my buddies and I arrived once it was about to close down for the night. We decided to go to another bar so we won't keep the bartenders up later. I went to a bar down the street and I could not find my wallet full of cash! My buddy and I drove back to Sunset Pizzeria to see if my wallet was there and it was..with all my cash! I wanted to give the worker at least $20 for his honesty but he did not take it. The majority of people nowadays would say no they did not find a wallet or if they did, the cash would be gone. I am glad this establishment is built with honest and excellent service! :)"}
{"text":"One of the best pizza Places in town.  Mike and his crew are awesome.   Great food Great atmosphere"}
{"text":"Love this place! We go every couple of weeks for karaoke night and it's always a good time!"}
{"text":"I'm giving one star for the service because it wouldn't let me give no stars. The food is good, we had the Sunset pizza and wings and it was all good. But the service sucked. The place was empty, maybe one other table. We sat and ordered our beverages which arrived ok and then we waited quite some time waiting for someone to come take our order. We finally went up to the bar to ask then the girl came over. She acted friendly but you can tell when it's a fake friendly. We then waited and waited and waited until anyone came back over to replenish our pitcher. The pizza came out first, but couldn't eat it because we had no plates. Then about 5 minutes or so later the wings came out. Still no plates but the guy was kind enough to drop some off after we asked again. 
It just seems they were more interested in pleasing each other then their cash paying customers. 
The food was good but it's a shame the service sucked so bad."}
{"text":"Great to see downtown Henderson getting some new blood. Gyro and strombolis were great. Gaming coming soon...."}
{"text":"Great staff, great food and a very local environment. One of the best Philly  cheese steaks ever (with egg) !! A must if you are anywhere near downtown."}
{"text":"We have tried various times to call. And order always get put on hold. Mainly a girl that answers gives no time to even ask for delivery times. Have stayed on the phone for 15 minutes one time and still was on hold. We were willing to give this place a try but couldn't."}
{"text":"The food is a bit pricey for what it is. I have to say, I did NOT enjoy their pizza at all!! BARELY any sauce, unusually lacking in cheese... so much so that you could see bare dough all over...  Nice atmosphere & fun karaoke, but for a pizza place to make lousy pizza is a shame!! We told our waiter about our dislike of the pizza, and all he did was say \"sorry\". We got 2 slices, each was $3.00. NO discount off the bill for not eating 1/2 of the awful, cardboard box tasting pizza. 

Service was slow and we found ourselves looking for our waiter a few times in the 2 hours we were there at Karaoke"}
{"text":"Our dinner was off to a shaky start when I saw the pesto pasta I had chosen from the online menu isn't available at this location. I ended up with lasagna which was pretty good - nice authentic flavor, had that homemade taste. The salad it comes with isn't exciting - iceberg with a bit of red onion slices, couple tomatoes, sparse cucumbers and a handful of olives. My boyfriend ordered hot wings and fries and said on a spicy scale of 1-10,  they're a 1. When the server (who turned out to be an owner) asked, he said they were just ok and not very hot. She voluntarily took the wings off our tab! Totally unnecessary but very gracious. My dinner, the zucchini appetizer, the ambience and customer service was good enough to warrant a return visit."}
{"text":"Their Pizza is awesome sauce and I order green apple martinis not too sweet with Ketel One I believe they're only 6:50 and the atmosphere is good as well in fact I met someone from out of town showing them around and I will be bringing them there tomorrow night I'm sure we will have a blast"}
{"text":"So went here Saturday night and service sucked .. seems as if you are not in your 20,male and single attention is not promised! Food was great !!!"}
{"text":"Come here for karaoke for the first time and had a great time.  If you want to go to place to have fun and relax this is it......"}
{"text":"Great wings . Large salads . The pepperoni that they use is awesome sauce! Good food and enough gaming seats to go around"}
{"text":"Walked in, sat down with my wife, waited a few minutes, watched one bartender take notes and then go serve the group that walked in AFTER we did. The other bartender was busy talking to two drunk bums and never said a word. We walked out. Good luck, I give this place 3 months."}
{"text":"Called ahead. Acted like I was from mars when I came in. \"Did you call our other location?\" Asked for dry wings. Got em dry. Zero hot sauce on the side. Can't believe I still placed an order after they neglected original order. Trying to support local business. Got to enjoy a smoke filled karaoke room while I waited. Won't be back"}
{"text":"Ordered pizza here today for a lunch meeting - 14\" veg w/cheese on half, extra sauce, well done. Twenty minutes later go to pick up and it has extra cheese. Send back and hear the cook complain about how stressed he is. Fifteen minutes later get a pizza with no cheese on half (yay!), but hardly any sauce, barely done crust, with raw onions and garlic. 

This is the second time I've tried this place for lunch and they are 0 for 2. I am so done. There are way too many other restaurants that can get orders right in a timely manner.

On the up side, the bartender and waitress were very helpful."}
{"text":"The food here is great! Best part they don't allow children in here. I hate hearing screaming kids, like I am at a chucky cheese free for all When I am gambling. Me and my buds come here to eat and play the machines. Great job keeping those little bastards out!"}
{"text":"Food isn't too bad, but the wait for the food was over an hour and 15 minutes. Never got any refills on any of our drinks, and it took 20 minutes to get a check split. They definitely need to have more than 1 server working at dinner time."}
{"text":"Wow! This place steals money from their customers! Be sure to check your bill carefully to find their 'rounding' charge (rounded up in their favor)! Seriously...I paid with a credit card, so they weren't making change!! Stealing is stealing!!!' This is unfortunate, because my pizza tasted really good!"}
{"text":"Nope, not going back.  Sadly they are more interested in serving alcohol and the gambling that might walk in their door than service the customers.   Glasses stayed empty while the owners along with their wait staff stood at the bar and talked.   Never once checked on the food after it was delivered to the table.  Had to walk to the bar to get silverware to eat.   Perhaps they should have just kept to what they know.  Small family style pizza place. Big disappointment and will not be going back ever."}
{"text":"Great food. Philly cheesesteak was excellent. Full bar and friendly staff. Over 21 only due to bar and smoking allowed.  Gaming coming soon."}
{"text":"Grabbed a to go chicken Caesar salad for 10.50. Service was good but I think the cooks are trying to save money by conserving the chicken.  Not even a half a breast on a large salad."}
{"text":"This place is the best. Stella on tap , best cheese steak around. Hot chicks working the bar. Pizza is awesome. Everyone is really nice herr.. Goood times"}
{"text":"21 and over:  Yay!  Let's face it, this is a bar that serves pizza, Not a place to take the little darlings after a game.  

Should say 21-40ish:  Let's reiterate, it is a bar that serves food.  It is not a pizzeria that has inexpensive deals for budget conscious older families or seniors.  
Actually, the prices are a tad bit high but not outrageous.

Food:  Again, it is a bar that serves pizza.  The food is not fabulous but it isn't bad either.  The pizza is a no frills, serviceable pizza, but that is about it.  We've ordered here twice.  On a takeout order, we stopped on the way to the car to make sure there was a pizza in the box because the box was so light.  Had entrees at one of the other locations and they were okay.  (Much better Italian meals at Emerald Island on Monday nights!). 

Staff:  Really, really nice people.  

Vibe:  Relaxed and certainly not snooty.  Felt like it secretly wants to be a little bit of a bad ass bar but is too well brought up to go there.  At the same time, it felt like they were going for kind of upscale-ish but fell short on that mark. 

We'd go back for drinks but probably not just for the food.  It fills a need on Water Street for a place to just sit and drink.  Has the added benefits of not being a really smokey casino and not being a casino eatery that allows kids.  For the pizzeria experience go to their other location near Boulder Hwy."}
{"text":"Very very smokey if you are trying to quit or are allergic to cigarette smoke do not go here.  Also customer service could have been a lot better too.  I will not return to this location.  There are a few other locations here in the valley that I have been to and had a better experience it was just this location."}
{"text":"Tip: This place is mostly a bar so if you will be inhaling smoke while you eat.

We came for lunch on a Monday and the place was pretty empty.

I had the Italian sub for my meal. It was ok and good for the price. If I come back I will have to try the pizza, which is what they are allegedly known for."}
{"text":"This is the go to lunch time spot during the work week. They have a great pizza lunch special that includes a large slice of pizza, soft drink, and a salad for under 7 dollars with tax or two slices of pizza and a drink for the same price. They even give you the option to take your drink in a to go cup when you leave. 

My biggest complaint is they allow smoking and it can get very hazy and stinky inside as a result. Their food and service is great but if smoke bothers you this isn't the pizza joint for you."}
{"text":"Great specials , nice friendly environment! Come check it out ! Gaming promotions , trivia nights . Fun and upbeat atmosphere.  Great food , large menu , pizza , pasta , wings , sandwiches,  salads , home made canolis."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in the service they had tonight during the game. I asked the bartender for his name and he said \"Monty...but you can call me busy\" and then walks away from me. And my first thought in my head was okay, haha he's joking. But he wasn't...I call for his name for some drinks and he purposely ignores me. I mean this is my first being here and I wasn't demanding at all. He eventually takes my order and I order a cheese Stromboli. I sat down and waited, thinking they were going to serve it to me or call my name. Minutes pass by and I look and the Stromboli was placed on the bar & NOBODY said anything. I understand a business being busy, but don't treat customers poorly."}
{"text":"Came to downtown Henderson to get a smog check.
Pulled up Google Maps and looked for pizza.
Since it was already 2 p.m. I called them to check how late good lunch specials ran...
4pm-impressive.
Just ordered a cheese slice and salad, under 6 bucks with a drink.
Bartenders were friendly, salad with fresh and tasty and the pizza was really good.
I read the other reviews ...and maybe when it's busy service is different,  but at this time there are 6 people at the bar and the bartenders are very helpful."}
{"text":"Very good pizza at good prices. A nice bar to with some basic machines to if your a gambler or drinker.

They have a $10 large cheese special, that's a $1.50 a extra topping. My wife and I ordered one with pepperoni and sausage and were very impressed with it. Nothing special in itself, just normal pizza done very well.

They had your usual keno/video poker machines at the bar, and they had good payouts. They give you $10 free play just for signing up for their players club. If your the type to gamble at locals bars this place isn't bad.

I'll be coming back here in the future. If your nearby and want some good pizza, I'd stop by."}
{"text":"This place is awesome, good beer, good food, awesome service... what's not to like? And pizza port IPA on tap ANDDD HOT FRIES WITH CHEESE AND BACON! Yum!"}
{"text":"Went on a Wednesday evening and sat for 10 minutes at a booth before I had to get up and order our own drinks and food at the bar. When the waitress finally showed up she was unprofessional and acted like she could care less about working. Once our food arrived I had to go find napkins and condiments for the table because the waitress never came by the table. Once we got our check I had to go pay at the bar because the waitress was too busy chatting with friends. She was a horrible waitress. The wings were good and had a plain cheese pizza. Not bad, average.

The environment is fun with karaoke if your into that sorta thing with a fully stocked bar. Unfortunately, in a town like this I big on customer service as too why we tip well. I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Pizza is thin crust, lots of sauce and cheese: delicious. Generous portions. Service by servers and bartenders is off the hook. Salads are fresh and spot on. Hamburgers are cooked perfectly and filling. Zucchini is very good."}
{"text":"The bar tender, Jose was rude so we left bar and went to a table.  Waitress was awesome made our experience at Sunset worth going back.  Food is amazing.  There's a sign so wall says \" no pissy attitudes\". Jose needs to follow it!"}
{"text":"I understand hiking the prices up during an event on water st. ,but Gus the bartender was clueless about the price of 2 shots of Jack Daniels. After he said  $ 12, he took  our money and said $ 16 it's top shelf,we already drank the shots so nothing could be done . $16 is ridiculous. Gus is worse. Your business has seen the last of my money."}
{"text":"Good food,and usaly good service. .   No fun or love with the tall dark haired bartender..  ymmv..  other than this one instance, great place.."}
{"text":"Friday nite. Noisy. But good pizza. Poor server was busy and did her best to keep up. Well deserved tip."}
{"text":"Very good food, nice crowd. Been going on Wednesdays for karaoke, and now going on Saturdays as well. Lots of fun!! If this is your idea of a good time, I highly recommend it."}
