{"text":"Nothing that I don't like about this place! Love that the establishment is clean (tables, booths, utensils, glassware), and the interior is decorated to give a nice, soothing atmosphere. Perfect lunch portions for an affordable price. Service is quick and usually at lunch they don't talk/bother you much, which I enjoy. Sushi rolls are outstanding, love the way they're held together and the texture of the rice! I always come here for an easy meal :)"}
{"text":"Probably one of the best sushi places in the east valley. Anyone who knows good sushi avoids places like Ra. So I'm always in the market for a good traditional sushi place with fresh ingredients and skills behind the sushi bar. I would've gone for their rice alone! Perfect texture. Chewy and moist. Ginger was yellow not pink! Miso was fresh and not loaded with sodium straight from the box. I ordered a Bento lunch box for $10 and it came with two gyoza, side of rice, Cali roll, and 4 fresh nigiri sushi, plus soup , salad, fruit. I'm always grateful when those dining around me don't wonder why I am crying when I eat. Like is the sushi that good?! Yes... *sniff sniff... Yes it was. Plus I like my ponzu sauce green with wasabi because I love the buuurrrnn!!"}
{"text":"\"Great sushi and great service. We had the Pink Lady and Spicy Girl special rolls. Fantastic! We plan on returning.\""}
{"text":"Love this place. The happy hour specials are awesome and it's still reasonably priced even when it's not happy hour. The food is way better than Ra or Sakana."}
{"text":"Being so far from the ocean, I've been skeptical of getting sushi. But I've been craving sushi this last week and after reading the reviews decided to give it a go. Also decided to go on a Sunday which happens to be happy hour all day! We got a ton to eat.. The sashimi was amazing, the rolls didn't disappoint, and the special rolls were fantastic. When the bill came, we were shocked to find it half of what we expected since most of what we ordered was on happy hour. Everything was fresh and the service was spot on.. Will certainly be back!"}
{"text":"I'm a major Sushi lover.  This place was recommended to me since I moved here from Dallas.  First thoughts, don't be scared by the outside, looks like a sketchy bar or something.  Inside is very clean and service was quick and friendly.  Prices were pretty standard for what I'm used to.  Ordered the lunch special and spicy Edamame.  It was enough for a lunch.  All together, was okay.  Best I've had since moving here.  Does not compare to my favorite, Shiwase in McKinney,Tx."}
{"text":"Very excited to have a great new sushi place in the neighborhood! Our party had several rolls and nigri, and we were not disappointed. The staff was very friendly and accommodating. Loved the decor. We just missed Happy Hour but we will be back for"}
{"text":"Bad bad service at least for us.  Pretty bad. Wont go back. For a newly opened place you would think they would try a bit harder."}
{"text":"The wasabi didn't have even a little bit of a kick so I tried so a large portion and nothing.  There was also only 1 server so the service was slow.  Did have some really good rolls at a good price but without wasabi, why bother?"}
{"text":"The service was fabulous!   The food was outstanding and freshly served. The chefs are very meticulous and create a beautiful delivery of the food. Great ambiance. My favorite was the pink lady and the spicy yellowtail. A must eat at restaurant if you like sushi!!"}
{"text":"This place left a lot to be desired. We chose this place because of its great reviews. We went on Mother's day and was sad to see that they decided not to do their happy hour because of this. The rolls we got were okay but nothing spectacular, and the atmosphere was pleasant. The staff was kind and quick, which was about the only plus side. Long story short... we are going to stick with Mido as our regular spot."}
{"text":"Food is great. It's a shame the service can't keep up. After waiting 40 minutes for an order of sashimi, we were told we wouldn't be getting it because they ran out of yellowtail. Why they didn't tell us that as soon as they noticed? Instead, we had to inquire twice. the first time about 25min in. When we were told, 'oh yes your order is next.' Then, we asked after another 10min. This time there was a huddled discussion between the manager and chef and we were told they had just run out. But when we saw them bring out more for other diners, I had to yelp about it. Even worse was the terrible \"customer service\" from the manager. Our server never showed up again. They put mayo on items we requested they didn't. All in all, the food was good when receive as ordered but it wasn't enough to make up for the inadequate service."}
{"text":"Horrible will never in my life time go there again.   First off I walked in hardly got greeted. Mind you there were only 2 other customers inside. Second of all I waited to long for a sushi roll and chicken on a stick when there were no customers. After I received food, my sushi roll was okay but the chicken was horrible and not flavorful at all! I took a bite out of it and requested that it get sent back.   Here comes the nonsense....   I got my bill... The so called manager only took a dollar off  and charged me pretty much for something I didn't eat. I asked to speak to the owner because I explained that it's not the money that matters it's the principal and how you treat your customers.. She said that he was in the back and did speak English.. O_o... That was fine with me...I then requested to have him come out while she Translate... She said he was very busy in the back... I told her I would wait... Then she said that he wasn't there... So, I asked her how could a owner be in two places at once if she just talked to him.. And all over a sudden he is not there.. Then she started to ignore me.. Mind you my voice never gets elevated.... I step outside for a minute.. Came back in when she would be ready to listen.. I asked for a phone number to one of there many owners she claimed previously that this company has... She said she didn't know there number... I asked her to go talk to the owner \"in the back\"  and figured it with him... After the longest 30 mins of my life, and her realizing that I wasn't going getting anywhere she finally broke down and gave me  a 5 dollar coupon... O_O.... Like I would spend anymore money in a place which tells lies and has poor customer service the only reason  why she gave it to me is so I would not write this review .. Long story short... Dont come here and waste your time.. Although the inside looks great customer service fails majorly... Just drive the extra mile and  half and go to RA sushi bar on Ray Rd."}
{"text":"Went here for late lunch on Saturday. This is the best sushi I have had in Arizona.  Enjoyed some normal nigiri sushi and a few speciality rolls.  The Crazy Roll was insanely good.  Service was attentive, restaurant was clean and handsome.  Looking forward to my next visit!"}
{"text":"This was my first trip to this hidden gem...one word: Phenomenal. There was SO much flavor in every bite. The prices are unbeatable- I highly recommend the Dynamite roll and squid salad."}
{"text":"I wish they had more locations! Excellent sushi, great prices and quality is consistent. Great ambiance, very modern and clean. They also have a great happy hour (Sundays happy hour is ALL DAY!??). The only complaint I have is that they need to work on their \"greeting\" of customers. Get the friendly vibe goin"}
{"text":"My fiance and I moved to the area right before Ginban opened, so I've been curious to try it.  I'm so glad we did!  They've only been open 3 weeks, so there weren't many people inside but I'm hoping they're able to build a good customer base to stay open.  The atmosphere/decor was closer to something you would see in Scottsdale but not obnoxiously so.  They still have a couple kinks to work out - we had a waitress, but the sushi chef took our order (they don't have the traditional paper menus at most sushi restaurants) and the waitress didn't know that.  However, I think because we were sitting right in front of him at the bar he just took care of us.  We ordered yellowtail sashimi, the pikachu roll and the spicy girl roll.  The sashimi was delicious, although I was a little taken aback that it was served in a margarita glass over crushed ice and the glass changed color.  In my opinion, that part wasn't necessary.  My fiance really enjoyed the spicy girl roll - the crunchies mixed in with the spicy salmon on top were a nice addition and overall the roll had a good spice to it.  The pikachu roll was unlike any other roll I've had before - it has lobster salad, bbq eel, avocado and tempura banana.  Yes, banana.  All of this wrapped in soybean paper and drizzled with eel sauce.  We wolfed it - it was so good.  I would say it was a delicious way to end the meal, but we also tried their tempura green tea ice cream.  Also quite tasty, and the sushi chef said they made the ice cream in house.  I really hope this place sticks around - we look forward to coming back!"}
{"text":"Amazing sushi and quiet space where you can have a pleasant dinner with friends. Their rolls are massive, cleanly constructed, and delicious of course.  I like this place because you don't pay for the atmosphere, so their sushi is very reasonable.  Highly recommended.  Give this place a shot and get the word out."}
{"text":"This will be very first review on yelp and it is very deserving of my praise.   This is a small business, with a small staff, but they are passionate about serving the vey best sushi possible.  I always have the sushi bar salad and the yellowtail sashimi there, but I also love the ninja jalapenos, the ginban roll, the caterpillar roll, the tuna, the salmon, the eel, and the fact that they have banana in some of their rolls, which is way more awesome than I expected.  I love their saki's too and I always get a peach saki and mango salad when I'm feeling like desert.  If that sounds at all interesting to you, you have to try it, it's an amazing combination."}
{"text":"It's the best pricing and fresh Sushi Rolls and Sashimi I have tried in Phoenix and Chandler area. Got the coupon from AZ Chinese Newspaper, and worth to try again with 20% off. Awesome!"}
{"text":"Wonderful gem in Ahwatukee.  It's tucked in the Fry's plaza.  Don't be fooled by the outside.  Inside is modern - black table and chairs, sushi bar, gorgeous rock wall.  The servers are very friendly.  Food comes out fast and is delicious.  Everything we have  ordered has tasted very fresh and perfectly prepared.  I love when you find a family run, non- chain restaurant that has terrific food, low prices and great service."}
{"text":"I enjoyed Ginban Sushi a great deal though I've only been there once. I split some nigiri, some sashimi, and a Spicy Girl Roll with another person and I enjoyed it all. The sashimi & nigiri was fresh, the Spicy Girl Roll was delicious, and another fabulous part of the dinner was the price. Having eaten in many of the sushi restaurants in the Chandler area, I can say that most are not as good and twice the price. The only reason I gave this place 4 stars was the unimpressive sake menu and the unpleasant service experience.  Our server knew nothing about sake and when I asked her which Specialty Roll she would recommend, she stated that she disliked raw fish and didn't really eat sushi. I'm rather sure that my mouth hung open for a few seconds after hearing that from a waitress in a sushi restaurant. All in all, I'd return to Ginban Sushi because I liked the sushi and it didn't break the bank."}
{"text":"There is no better sushi place anywhere in Ahwatukee! Ra? Give me a break! Overpriced and sterile. Sakana? No thanks. Ginban? My favorite! My wife's favorite! We have only been there a handful of times, but today we decided to make Ginban our \"go-to\" place. The sushi is nothing less than amazing. Live scallop (a featured item), jalapeño yellowtail, tiger roll, takosu (octopus with asparagus)...all so very fresh and excellently prepared! The sashimi is awesome and the oysters (Hamahama and Kumamoto) will leave the most spectacular essence of ocean lingering on your taste buds! The people next to us at the sushi bar today got a teriyaki chicken that was almost like all the best parts of a sizzling plate of fajitas: sizzling (goes without saying) and the smell was wonderful! The Sushi Chefs are masters. Kenny, the Head Chef, is personable and takes great pride in his preparations. Vivian, the Owner/Manager is eager to please and very proud of her establishment. She also has given us the best recommendations to try new items that we might not have been so ready to order on our own. Stepping out of our sushi comfort zone at Ginban has been a most pleasant surprise! The atmosphere is low-key, quiet and very enjoyable (we have only gone during the late lunch/early afternoon time, which is very much our speed). The restaurant, itself, is very clean and the design is about as \"chic\" as Ahwatukee has to offer. Give it a try. You won't be disappointed. (If you have been disappointed, give it another chance, especially if you have the opportunity during non-rush hours.)"}
{"text":"Not that good, tuna roll had too much rice.  Gyoza OK, but I make better at home.  My son ordered chirashi and while dish was creatively presented, it lacked quality fish.  Never had he left so much uneaten fish before.  Disappointing, won't be back."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Great happy hour, always super fast service, and the food is great. I love coming here for a quick bite or dinner. Way better than ra and way more affordable.  ."}
{"text":"This is a really nice little sushi restaurant!  It's a little hard to see from the road as it's tucked into a strip mall, but it's definitely worth finding.  The fish is always so fresh and tasty and the prices are fair.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I am a bit of a sushi snob as my husband used to manage a very good sushi restaurant in another state. Ginban sushi is awesome, I've been going here for 3 years. I've tried other sushi places around here and none are as good. I usually get take out, but sometimes dine in. One time we did get an order of Gyoza that was burned a bit. The manager was appalled and replaced it right away. Things like that happen, I won't ding a restaurant for that as long as they take care of it.   My kids love the bento boxes. I like the rolls. All of the rolls are good, but my favorites are the Ginban roll and crunchy roll. Something my husband learned working at a sushi restaurant is to always try the house roll.  If you haven't tried the Ginban roll you have to! It's amazing. Prices are pretty comparable to other places. They do have lunch specials, happy hour specials, and 20% off specialty rolls after 8 pm.  p.s. I'm not sure what the other reviewer meant about non Japanese owners. I'm pretty sure they are Japanese, as I had some Japanese friends who would go there to eat and speak with them in Japanese."}
{"text":"Friend told me about this place. I came and was blown away. Great sushi, sashimi, and tempura. Enjoyed a few rounds of sake and beer. Come for happy hour, lunch or dinner. I'm serious-great place."}
{"text":"I love this place! Favorite sushi spot on my side of town for sure! The quality of fish is fresh (well, as fresh as it gets for AZ, being that we are in the middle of the desert with not much access to SUPER fresh fish straight from the ocean). The specialty rolls are all great, I have not had one that I didn't like, and I have tried almost all of them.  Service is great as well, everyone there is super sweet and rolls don't take long to get to you. I would recommend this place to anyone new to sushi and even sushi snobs, like me!  -except for the calamari, I do not recommend that at all"}
{"text":"If you've been going somewhere else for sushi then what the heck are you doing?!  You're going to the wrong place ya big dungus!  Ginban sushi is the place to go and let me tell you why.  I've been here over a dozen times now and that's a lot of times considering I've only been in the area for like 8 months.  Before I came to Phoenix I've been all over the world and I've eaten sushi meats from coast to coast and let me tell you something - I don't know a lot about sushi but I know when I put something in my mouth if it tastes good or not, and that's why I'm writing this review because if you want some sushi meats that you put in your mouth and you like the way it tastes then just come here, what are you waiting around for?!  First let me tell you about the owner, ok?  He's a great guy and he's a sushi master.  The menu has a lot of great sushis on it.  Maybe you want some rolls, right?  Well then what the heck - just get one of the rolls with banana tempura in it and you're gonna love it!  Or maybe you want some fresh fish so just order some fish or ask them what they recommend and he'll give you the best that he recommends.  I don't know why I have to explain this to you, just do it already.  Or maybe you're a guy and you're like \"Oh I don't want some sushi because I like cooked food\" ok then big man, just order off of the kitchen menu and they'll bring you some sushi meats cooked and some rice and some tempura shrimp or whatever you order, it doesn't matter because it's all good.  Ok finally maybe you're here already and you're looking at Yelp because it's time for desert.  And maybe you're at Ginban with your special lady and it's a romantic evening, so you want to know how to close things our and seal the deal (Ladies this is a good place to take your man also if you want him to know that you're the boss and you wear the pants when it comes to picking where to eat and you're not going to settle for Wendy's or Taco Bell anymore) so just listen to me and do what I tell you: order the mango salad, and a peach saki for desert, and share it.  The Mango Salad isn't on the menu and I hope the owner doesn't get pissed about me saying it, but order it anyway.  I don't know how much is costs all I know is that it's real sushi (like maybe it's crab salad and tuna salad inside of a mango wrap) and it's delicious and it's real food, not some fru-fru desert that a gypsy tries to sell you when it's checkout time at an Italian restaurant.  And the peach saki is the perfect sweet way to end the meal so that when you give that goodnight kiss you taste like peach and not like whatever else you ate, and just have a good time, ok?  Because it's a great place to eat some sushi.  Stop going somewhere else you're wasting your money and you look like a big dringus!  Look at the pictures that's actually what the food looks like and it tastes as good as it looks!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious, I come here every two to four weeks, and the service is great. The server I usually get, I think Shelly, is really nice and almost knows me by name now. The food is really good, especially the snow crab salad, and all the Shashimi. This may be weird, but the water is really good."}
{"text":"There were multiple issues that arose during and after my experience with Ginban Sushi, but I will say that their food is excellent, but they CHANGED MY BILL AMOUNT WHEN THEY PROCESSED MY CARD. First of all, I'd like to say that restaurant was in no way busy when I walked in. There were 3 other parties there at the time, with a combined total of less then 10 people. Still, I called ahead and made a reservation for 6. I was told there would be a table for us when we got there. I arrived, and no one had put two tables together for us, so we had to wait for them to do it before we were seated.  When we finally sat down, we were given our menus and the waitress from the front went back to her post. At first our waitress came very quick to take our drink orders, but the snappy service soon diminished. I understand sushi takes a while, I've been to more then a few bars before in my life, but this seemed to take forever compared to other places. When we ordered, my sister ordered the same roll me and my grandmother ordered. We ordered three total, one each, and ordered it in such a way that her order was separate from ours. She was sitting on the complete other side of the table, and when the rolls came they were all on one plate. We had to pass the plate around to dish out the food.  Refills took forever. We were never offered any until the check was on it's way, and the waitress was never in the dining area so we were left with no drinks a lot of the time. Due to the poor service, I left a small tip. (On a bill of almost $80, I left $3 in cash). At first there was no issue with my receipt, and I walked out. After a few days, I noticed a charge posted to my bank account that was exactly 10% higher then what I wrote on the receipt. That's unacceptable. I never authorized a tip to be charged to my account. I went back and confronted the person claiming to be the manager on duty, who was ironically our server that day.  First she tried to say that they have a 10% minimum tip, but showed no proof of a sign or menu that said such when asked. Even if true, the $3 in cash should have been deducted. She then moved on to say that they charge a minimum 10% tip for all parties of six or more people due to the extra work like 'all fancy restaurants', but 'spared' us that charge. First of all, I was not spared this charge, it was folded into my bill. Secondly, I'm sorry but this is not a 'fancy' restaurant. Thirdly, our of the 6 people, 2 were under the age of 5 and one didn't even order anything. Her third and final excuse was that all sushi restaurants have a 10% minimum tip. During and after all this, I told her I was never told of the charge, I never authorized a charge of this amount, and that if they require higher tips to keep the restaurant going, they should raise prices on the menu, not up people's bill without them knowing. It was not until I threatened to go to the city with a case of fraud that she begrudgingly offered a higher amount in store credit for our problems. I declined, because after making a threat like that I don't know what they'll do. I told her I just want a refund for the amount that I didn't authorize (almost $8). She kept going back and offering store credit time and time again until she finally took down our card number and receipt info to find the transaction and refund the amount.  What's even more troublesome is at some point they put through a second charge on my bank account for the actual amount that I wrote on the receipt, but it never posted. The first charge of the amount plus 10% is what did post. Never going here again. Terrible service, and fraudulent charges that were never stated when we walked in or ordered. For those who made it this far, yes I did end up getting my $8 after almost a week."}
{"text":"Great service, delicious sushi, clean and modern decor. My favorite appetizer is the Jalapeño ninja, not too spicy just delicious and different from the regular jalapeño poppers that are usual bar food.  I love the spicy rolls although the spicy mayo is spicy if it has the word mayo in it so I won't eat it.  We try to make it here once a week for our sushi fix since we discovered it. Give it  a try it may become a favorite of yours too!"}
{"text":"Decided to try Ginban after reading many positive reviews.  My boyfriend and I have been looking for a decent sashimi place.  We ordered the sashimi deluxe, and since it happened to be happy hour we also ordered a ginban roll, spicy salmon roll, and seaweed salad.  The sashimi deluxe included seven different kinds of sashimi, three pieces of each kind.  The quality was average for Arizona-- a couple of the pieces did not taste very fresh.  However, the price fit with the quality as it was only $24.  The ginban roll was similar to what you get at asian fusion restaurants; the spicy salmon roll was below average; the seaweed salad was above average.    The service was average.  There was only one server working.  She checked up on us periodically, but was not very friendly.  The atmosphere was nice for a date, although it was very quiet (almost too quiet).  There were three other couples eating while we were there.  Overall, I would eat here again--but it would not be my first choice."}
{"text":"I had a hankering for sushi tonight and visited Ginban for the first time with my husband tonight. My experience was similar to what many others commented on here already. The service was, frankly, below average. We were greeted and seated immediately, but it took over 15 minutes for our order to be taken. I wasn't sure if the restaurant was short-staffed, or the servers just didn't stop by our table enough, but either way, I was nearly ready to walk out after our main server walked by our table several times without so much as a glance to us. She was not very friendly, either.  However, I'm really glad we stayed as the sushi was outstanding. I had a Philadelphia roll and a roll with crab, and my husband and I shared a sweet potato tempura roll. My husband doesn't like fish, so he ordered chicken teriyaki as well. The sushi was excellent--the fish was fresh and flavorful, and the sweet potato was the perfect texture and temperature. My husband's chicken teriyaki was a bit dry and chewy, though the portion of chicken and rice was large. The teriyaki sauce could also have used a bit more flavor.  We'll be moving to downtown Phoenix in a few weeks, so I'm not sure if I'll be back. If we weren't moving, it would always be a good option for sushi, especially with Happy Hour all day on Sundays (see their menu for great HH pricing). The service and wait time really put me off, but the great sushi can't be denied."}
{"text":"Nice decor and very clean. The food is either real good or real bad, depending on what you order.  The Gyoza and seaweed salad are great and the teriyaki chicken is horrible. The chicken clearly is not cooked there, it tastes like it is precooked from us foods and thawed out. The Katsu sauce is not Japanese at all.   I guess if you only want sushi it's ok, but the fish is average. The service is quick but not very engaging."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a hidden gem here in Phoenix. Having lived in Los Angeles, Ginban Sushi rivals any of the sushi eateries on the West Coast. Also they have a very friendly staff and a wonderful selection of Japanese cuisine.  In my opinion their Happy Hour is the best in Ahwautukee and has a nice variety of beers and sushi rolls to choose from. Too many restaurants have a very limited Happy Hour menu, especially in Ahwautukee. However, Ginban Sushi's is great. I prefer the salmon bento box for lunch which comes with a fresh salad and delicious miso soup. Finally, one of my pet peeves is cleanliness. There is an old saying that if a restaurant is clean in the front of the house then the back of the house (kitchen) is most likely the same. Ginban Sushi is always spotless each and every time I have eaten there. It's located next to Fry's Supermarket on Chandler Blvd near the intersection of 40th Street."}
{"text":"Very impressed with the sushi rolls (golden spider, spicy girl, ginban) and love boat for 2 (sashimi and nirgiri). Fresh fish and nice atmosphere inside!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went for an early dinner last Saturday and I have to say I am impressed.  The food was great and the services was attentive.  It's so nice to have a comfortable sushi place so close.  It is a good atmosphere and great service.  I definitely recommend going there."}
{"text":"After living on Maui for 12 years where we have the best sushi, I'm happy to find a place here for great sushi!!!  We'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Honestly this is without a doubt my new all time favorite.  Happy hour is 4:30-6 pm with great prices but a limited menu. I have never eaten a bad item on the menu. My only regret was this place has been here for years and I only discovered how amazing it is 5 months ago."}
{"text":"Went to Ginban Sushi for the first time today. Wife and I really liked it. We had the Volcano, Hawaiian, Dynamite and California rolls. Very fresh ingredients."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a great dinner here this evening. The service was very friendly and enjoyable. The rolls and sushimi  were fresh and delicious as well.  They have a great selection of drinks and food. Hidden gem tucked away next to Fry Marketplace. Good times."}
{"text":"We've eaten here a handful of times.The sushi here is fresh & delish. The staff is always friendly & the prices are reasonable. If you're in the area looking for good sushi, try this place. You won't be dissappointed."}
{"text":"Favorite sushi place in Ahwatukee :) I've been going here for years I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I am so happy that Ginban opened in my neighborhood!  I've gone for dinner during happy hour a few times now.  Service: efficient, timely, and unobtrusive (my favorite!) every time.  Food: the happy hour menu has real value - there are a number of rolls, appetizers and sashimi for under $5.  Ginban's fish is among the freshest I've had in the East Valley.  I skip their rolls now for the sushi and sashimi.    Decor: sleek and modern, and also comfortable.  I love strip mall surprises, where the inside completely surpasses your expectations from the outside."}
{"text":"The selection of rolls was pretty extensive but I'm not a huge fan of rolls.  We ordered sashimi and sushi and a yellow tail carpacio with ponzu.  The fish was rather bland and the sauce was rather overwhelming.  We also ordered a spicy ramen with the pork. This was the best dish we had.  Pork was cooked very well and the broth was creamy and rich..My only complaint? It was very much on the salty side.   The agadashi tofu was mediocre and also drenched in a ponzu that was more like a diluted soy then a light tangy ponzu  Service was also quite poor.  I sat there for about fifteen minutes without getting as much as a water....."}
{"text":"It was ok to me. Miso soup was good as someone else mentioned. Ate the 3-3-3 sushi platter which had 3 maguro, 3 hamachi, 3 salmon. Maguro was ok, hamachi was not as fatty as it should of been but the salmon was really good. It came with 6 pieces of spicy tuna roll, which was ok, not spicy enough for my taste. In my opinion, had too much rice in that platter combination.  Since it was happy hour, I tried the gyoza, don't bother, had no taste.  Lastly, the sushi had no wasabi in it as it usually does, so I had to ask for extra. I don't think I'll go back unless I am starving."}
{"text":"How have I not reviewed this place yet?! It's such great sushi. Really high quality fish!!! And really wonderful prices! The waitresses and waiters there are amazing and so friendly!!! They immediately recognized us and asked us how we were doing! The whiners just need to stop expecting the worst and find a way to be happy. It's a good place, give it a chance and ignore the stupid one star reviews. Me and my man need to come here more often!!!!"}
{"text":"Great sushi and reverse happy hour. Went last night with a group of friends and enjoyed dinner and drinks. Rock n roll was one of the best and the tuna and other nigri was yum, yum. Give it whirl next time you're in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"What does my daughter want after a long day working the home show? GINBAN! I can't go there without getting perfect sushi. The tempura is perfect. The rolls are perfect. I'm so glad they're practically next door! Thank you for maintaining your quality and service visit after visit! I highly recommend that people in Ahwatukee give you a try. OVER AND OVER!!!"}
{"text":"Overall great visit. This place was on about the same level as our usual sushi place. We decided to see how Ginban was by comparison. Prices were a little cheaper than usual. Quality was great. I got a salmon combo. It was delicious with great quality salmon! Miso and salad were tasty too. I especially enjoyed the dressing. Yum! Boyfriend got the bento box with tempura. He loved it. Fast and friendly service, great food and a good price! Cost about $50 for the two of us with tip included. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Great sushi, the yellow tail was great on a bed of rice. Had the volcano roll, very filling. Don't get anything else or you'll be stuffed. Service was good, the waiter kept on checking on us as well. The atmosphere cozy, the bathrooms very clean. I can tell they run a clean place judging by there fresh water fish tank - which was clean and all the fish healthy :-)"}
{"text":"I ordered to go this place is amazing and delicious the service was fast and the workers were friendly not too busy on a Saturday."}
{"text":"I agree with Eric L. Blew me away too. It's so good. The sashimi is something I dream about now and the Yaki udon chicken. Also the staff is very accommodating. I have been there multiple times now and it's always great."}
{"text":"5 stars for quality and freshness. Been here 3 times and have always liked their food. I don't think I would be back just bc the last time I came, the restaurant was full; instead of telling me they were full and behind, they took me in. There were only 2 sushi chefs and 3 waiters and the table were full. All of the restaurants that I've been to, they would tell me how long the wait would be so that I have a choice to leave or to wait. This place happily took my party in and it took them 2 hours to complete my order. I feel like I get each order every half hour. No food is worth that kind of waiting time."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what I'm missing here, but I didn't care for this place.  It had a funny \"used oil\" smell.  The sushi was just ok, but I could never get over the oily smell of the place.  I ordered the Chirashi dinner.  The sashimi was served on top of the hot rice, in effect cooking it.  When I asked, she said the cook was new. I'll never come here again, there are other places better in Ahwatukee."}
{"text":"The sushi here was super fresh and every roll we had was amazing! Tried the spicy girl, rocky ii (with the mango, our favorite). Also had the sashimi, which did not disappoint. Drinks were reasonably priced. Wait staff was very nice and friendly. Only negative is the ambiance is kind of boring, very open with not a lot of privacy if you are looking for a date night. If they would spice up the decor a bit I would give them 5 stars. Would return!"}
{"text":"First time we've tried this place and the sushi was so good! Sunday is ALL DAY happy hour and we took full advantage... they had really good happy hour deals! Beyond that, their Evil Roll, Hawaiian Roll, and Ginban Roll are all really delicious. It was a cute, trendy little place and everything looked really clean. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Tried it out for lunch. I enjoyed everything I tried. My friend got the Pikachu roll and I got the teriyaki salmon bento box. The Pikachu roll was really good and that tempura banana gave it such a nice subtle flavor. I will definitely go back and try some different rolls."}
{"text":"Excellent service! My hubby & I love this place. Good sushi & octopus salad is delish!"}
{"text":"Best sushi I've ever had, service is kinda meh and the atmosphere is quiet but the food makes it all worth it."}
{"text":"The wife, kids and I have been here at least 20 times. We love the sushi here. It is consistently fantastic and interesting. The ninja jalapeños are wonderful and not too spicy. All the rolls and the fresh sashimi rule."}
{"text":"This was dead. I understand it's a Wednesday but there was a couple and me that's it. Staff was super friendly. I wasn't impressed with the selection of rolls and lack a sashimi combos. Most of the rolls I ordered were dosed in sauce.     Not fair to write a review of the place a week after I had the best sushi of my life in New York."}
{"text":"The major downside of this restaurant is that it's extremely far from my house.  :(  We stopped here for a bit on the way to Tucson and I'm so glad we did.  Rolls were fresh and creative.  Service was excellent.  We had the Banana Mama roll and while it's not my favorite roll, it is possibly the most creative roll I've ever eaten.  Prices were very reasonable and it was a great value."}
{"text":"Fancy little mom/pop sushi resturant and bar that feels like a trendy franchise. Excellent ombiance and food! Would have rated 5 Stars if the greeting staff and overall service was a little better. The hostess/manager was kind of rude and could've smiled and been nicer."}
{"text":"Best sushi place in Phoenix! The ambiance is excellent - modern and fairly quiet. The quality of sushi and the variety of rolls make this restaurant stand out. And the appetizer \"pizza\" is not to be missed."}
{"text":"Been here a couple times and I always leave on a positive note. Salmon is highly recommended whether it may be a rolls or nigiri. Fish are fresh:) service is great. Interior is very nice, has nice tvs to watch sports.  Just a all around great place."}
{"text":"Stopped at this very stealthy place in the Fry's shopping center. Looks very generic on the outside but inside it is modern & beautiful. We ordered the sushi platter for two. Wow what a spread! Great presentation did not take away from the outstanding cuts of fish we were served. We also ordered 2 tuna hand rolls which were over the top mouthwatering. Service was very good & we will surely return.........very soon."}
{"text":"Excellent sushi very good flavors and very fresh  The snow white rolls was my favorite but it's all good"}
{"text":"Ok so highly disappointed with this place! It was lunch time place was empty and food tasty fishy! The sushi chefs were examining the fish in front of me making sure it was good! I was like no way. My soup and salad seemed ok until the salad was still frozen! Definitely not coming back. Hope I don't get sick! Hostess wasn't very pleasant. Off to hopefully find a better spot!"}
{"text":"We ate here when they first opened and the service was atrocious. The server spilled a full glass of ice water on my companion. I read the reviews that continued to complain about service but I was really hoping that we might catch the staff on a good night. There  were no blatant offenses, but even though there were only a few tables occupied in the entire restaurant, the server kept bringing food to our table that the table next to us ordered, and taking all of our food to them. The table next to us was more annoyed than we were, and shook their heads in frustration and said no that's theirs. It seems like the server was totally spaced out. The food itself was good. We ordered from the happy hour menu, which is quite reasonable. We got Gyoza, calamari, snow white roll, salmon nigiri, tuna nigiri and a lovely fresh salad from the sushi chef. I wish they would do some training so that The service wasn't so bad."}
{"text":"Wow this place blew me away. To start the atmosphere is great. Its very modern with low lights and great ambiant lighting, even our order had a blue LED light placed in the ice which was very cool. Even the windows are blacked out to help set the mood.  The menu is full and there are pleanty of options. My wife and i love a mix of sushi and sashimi so we went with the love boat for 2; it was wonderful. Another in group ordered a bento box that looked amazing.   All in all the food was great and the setting definatly added to the experience. I would definatly suggest this place and will be returning."}
{"text":"Hostess not super friendly. Sushi is good, dynamite app is awesome. It was dead on a Sunday at lunch, it took a little while before my order was taken. Hostess was also the server."}
{"text":"What a great find!  Had the Sushi and Sashimi lunch special.  It was a full plate - nice presentation and some of the best I've had.  Includes soup and salad for $15.  A wide selection of Sashimi, Sushi and other menu items.  I'll be back on my next trip to Phoenix."}
{"text":"We love going to this little sushi joint! The decor is modern and the servers are always very friendly. Love getting the Ginban roll, it is so tasty! They have happy hour all day Sunday which is nice. Prices are good even without happy hour pricing. They have large booths/tables to accommodate groups."}
{"text":"Awesome place! The sushi is EXQUISITE! Our chef \"Kenny\" did an awesome job at making our rolls and was very personable and speedy! Our server was nice too :) The prices are very fair during happy hour! And we would highly recommend trying this place.. RA is so overrated, support the local!! Also, the interior decorator did an awesome job!"}
{"text":"best sushi ever! went there for V day dinner and really enjoyed the food. they are very creative in making their roles and naming them. :) good place."}
{"text":"Ginban is great!  Very pretty and delicious sashimi and some of the best soup I've ever had in a sushi restaurant."}
{"text":"We had not been here in almost a year, and I was glad to see that nothing has changed. They still have great Sushi, and the Happy Hour has a few new items. The quality here has always been good. I like the fact that they don't load up their Happy Hour rolls with lots of rice like so many places do. We'll be back soon. I do want to try their Deluxe Sashimi next time. The table next to use had an order, and it looked FANTASTIC!"}
{"text":"Very friendly staff and great sushi. I recommend the spicy girl roll. A very nice find while I was traveling."}
{"text":"Ever eaten somewhere and thought you might get food poisoning later? Well this place was it. The sashimi looked sad and old and smelled funny. Not good when consuming raw food. I would never go here again. Ever."}
{"text":"Not a fan of this place. I had a very negative first experience and I ordered my rolls on soy paper and they did not come on soy paper. The waiter just stared at me and asked if I wanted to order something else. I thought it very rude as I wanted what I ordered AS I ORDERED IT. This made me very uncomfortable and made my visit extremely awkward. I'm not sure why the waiter just didn't say let me have them remake that instead of this weird output. Either way, I decided to give it another try. Yet again I was just disappointed. The selection of rolls is great but the staff is awful. I order something with lobster salad where the lobster was the hero of the roll and my boyfriend ordered another roll that had it in it. After ordering about 10 min later the wait comes back and tells my bf that they don't have any lobster salad and asked if he wanted something else, I then HAD TO ASK MYSELF what about my roll since the lobster salad is the main part of it? The waiter replied that my roll would still be fine, then I was like so it's basically the side parts of the roll with no main course and he thinks it'd be fine. Then he goes, do you not want yours? I'm like NO I don't because I ordered a lobster roll wanting the lobster. We ended up leaving because the other two rolls we wanted, they were also out of the main fish they needed for those as well. After these two terrible experiences, I will not go back. Tired of being treated as a customer that doesn't matter so I'll go to Sushi Ken just down the street to get better treatment."}
{"text":"So glad this place opened up so close to where I live! I came here because my cousin mentioned it to me and can't believe how many times I drove past it without even noticing. Definitely one of those place that you \"don't judge a book by its cover\". The inside decor is beautifully set up.   Sushi is really good, love the fact they have a brown rice option that I can't get that at other places. The eel cucumber roll was pretty good for a light roll that will will not fill you up too much so, I think I might go for the eel avocado though next time I come. Also I'm pretty sure I fell in love the gyoza and the light dipping sauce that they have. Seriously it was cooked perfectly.  Will definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"My fiancé and I really enjoyed the vegetarian options and the happy hour is also a great value!  Everything was fresh and had good presentation."}
{"text":"Sushi here is great and well priced. It's much nicer on the inside than I expected. Happy hour has amazing prices, staff was nice. Fish was fresh. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Surprised this was here next to the Frys we always shop at. We enjoyed it. We got the Spicy Tuna roll, Lobster roll, Spicy Girl roll, and Crunchy roll. Our favs were the Spicy Girl roll and the Crunchy roll. The Lobster roll had lettuce in it which I didn't particularly like so that one I wouldn't get again."}
{"text":"The food is very bland. Not impressed. Had ordered the udon and had to add so much salt. Nothing special with the menu...very regular type of Japanese food. I think sushi ken has better offering of food and price."}
{"text":"Me, my boyfriend and our friends have been here several times over the past 2 years and I've loved every visit. Their appetizers and sushi; rolls, hand rolls, sashimi etc is always delicious well worth any wait, seasonally they'll have fresh uni (sea urchin) and the staff is always very accommodating."}
{"text":"Super solid. And... AND, I'm super psyched to have this place in my hood!  Came here for a Friday lunch, and all of the food was A++ Very much enjoyed the chopped wasabi as well!  One thing I think they could improve upon is their lunch specials.  They have the setup where you pick 2, or 3 or 4 items from a list... which I've encountered numerous times at sushi places.  But their list is ALL rolls.  I wish I could get a mix of sashimi/sushi/roll, or whatever. Just... I can't see myself consuming 4 different rolls for lunch..."}
{"text":"Sushi was delicious and very pretty. Service was friendly and nice. Though the music was strange and the place was very quiet I enjoyed myself. It takes a bit for the sushi to come out but everything tasted amazing. Volcano roll was delicious."}
{"text":"Great food!!! Ginban roll is delicious. Happy Hour all day on Sundays! Gyoza is great, too."}
{"text":"The food was really good.  I had the scorpion roll and pink lady roll both were really good. The quantity was pretty good too!! Loved the ambience and service ."}
{"text":"This place has without a doubt the freshest sushi I have ever had in Arizona. We came in with a table of four on a weekday and received very attentive service. The atmosphere is much nicer than I expected, and would make a great date place. We ordered five different rolls; Phoenix, Tiger, Dynamite, Crunchy and Green Lady. The presentation of the dishes made them almost too beautiful to eat, and it was very apparent the chef here is an experienced sushi master. The prices of the dishes are also very reasonable, at $10-12 per plate. The one and only complaint I have is the price of the Sake bombs. At $13 each, I will not be buying drinks here (unless it's happy hour)."}
{"text":"First let me start by saying that if you're a picky sushi eater this is not the place. If you're OK with average sushi then you might find this place acceptable. Service was OK but still slow considering there were only two other tables during lunch. Another sign this place is not at the top of their game.  I might return in a pinch if I'm in this area but I certainly would not make a habit of coming back here. Their prices are far more expensive for the quality of food and portions.  This is at best a three star restaurant"}
{"text":"Wonderful variety of rolls and outstanding main course options. Sushi bar and kitchen both do a great job of quick, fresh preparation. Love the volcano roll and Snow White. They also have a very good selection for Happy Hour."}
{"text":"The BEST sushi in town!! Love it Service is very good, place is clean and the fish is very fresh ... The sushi is so tasty !!  I'm a happy girl!!"}
{"text":"Love this place.  Moved to the area about a year ago and have been several times...never disappoints.  You also can't beat the all day happy hour on Sunday's!"}
{"text":"Good fresh fish + Good rolls + Fresh Wasabi = I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Whenever I'm in Phoenix, I stop here!  It's a quaint restaurant, very clean with reliably great sushi!  We usually share rolls, philly and cali along with an appetizer, it's always a pleasure!"}
{"text":"My order was for take-out, so I'm not rating the service.  The sushi was good for the price. I didn't try any of the specialty rolls, just a couple pieces of yellowtail, a couple pieces of eel, a salmon roll, and a sweet potato roll. I would definitely order from here again."}
{"text":"Very good, had the lava and Hawaiian roll. Great presentation, and the fish was tasty and fresh. The chef did a great job. Flavors rich with a slight crunch for added texture."}
{"text":"This place is one of the best sushi resturaunt in awatukee,  arizona. Great prices, friendly staff, lots of choices to choose from on the menu and inviting warm atmosphere.  If you love sushi you should come here and see for yourself."}
{"text":"Very good sushi. I just got back from Japan, so I have good sushi on the mind. This was fresh, tasty, and the staff were courteous. The outside decor makrs the place look nondescript, but indoors is very nice. Be sure to ask for the fresh wasabi, it's a treat."}
{"text":"When I first walked into Ginban, I was struck by two things: the restaurant was very dimly lit and there was a very odd smell emanating from somewhere. However, this dismal, uncomfortable environment could easily have been overlooked had we eaten delicious food. Unfortunately, this was not the case. The sushi tasted bad, made with low quality ingredients that definitely did not satisfy."}
{"text":"My hubby and I eat here all the time. The specialty rolls are worth the money - the basic rolls are kind of bland - but our fav of all time are the Ninja Jalapeños. They are out of this world AMAZING! We go there just for those. Best part is they are on the Happy Hour menu! Restaurant is kept clean and has a nice atmosphere for dates. Not super family friendly but he kids do love the tempura shrimp and veggies. Miso soup is good too!"}
{"text":"Ginban really impress me from inside look compare the outside it make you feel like they not opening! Once I walk in the front dest lady give me very warm greeting , that is very important to customer first walk in a new place, the lunch was little slow there that is why my order get quick very on time and service was very attentive, I order a roll which I don't like and they just take away not even charge my wrong order actually that was my fault because my first time there and I Order the wrong roll but they give me free Order of that and replace me a new one, I feel so appreciate how much they care customer!  I will definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"We came here on a groupon and both of us were impressed.  We had veggie tempura, a dragon roll, ak roll and the miso soup.  Everything was fresh and well prepared.  The decor was modern and stylish..if we are back in this area we will definitely come back :)"}
{"text":"The sushi was delicious!! Especially the pikachu roll. It had banana in it but it turned out really good!!! The crunchy roll was soo crunchy and so delicious!!! The service was amazing and show of pride while working. It was amazing and I really hope to return!!!"}
{"text":"What can I say, this place definitely has my heart. I've been coming to Ginban for 4 years now. They've definitely changed my view on sushi. All the rolls come out perfection and never half- fasted. The costumer service is outstanding, definitely feel at home when i visit. They have the best lunch special and happy hour all day sunday! It's the best sushi in Ahwatukee hands down."}
{"text":"So I finally got back to give this place a second try. Before they had just opened so I understood some of the flaws. Now it's been open about 2 years. Upon my second attempt at trying Ginban, I was again thoroughly disappointed. First flaw was the waiter, we could barely understand his mumbling. Second he didn't seem to even know the menu or inventory. We ordered the mango tango, and the king lobster roll, which both featured lobster salad, as we came just for those rolls (we love lobster, who doesn't). However we were informed a while after ordering that they were out of lobster salad (a good portion of their rolls feature this). Thirdly the menu descriptions are not accurate. The waiter wanted informed us about the lobster salad for the mango tango roll and not the king lobster roll. I had to dispute that the King Lobster roll has this as well, which is what the menu states. He then comes back saying that they don't really use it on the roll. Well then why is a King Lobster roll (I don't think the tempura lobster qualifies it as that). Also the menu did not list for one of our rolls had masago. And fourth the food was just meh and we left hungry and went to Sushi Ken down the road for an extra roll each. The Ginban roll, which should be the best since carrying their name, was subpar. This roll was supposed to be cooked, yet the tiny amount of salmon that was inside was raw. The snow something roll must of been called that because it tasted like the ingredients were frozen and not fresh. Other side notes: Ginban had only one other table filled, while just a mile down the road Sushi Ken was packed. When a customer orders their roll on soy paper, they need to be informed of it costing extra, since not every place charges extra. Again thoroughly disappointed and upon a second try, we will not be coming back."}
{"text":"This review is for Saturday July 5th. We have been reading the reviews and didn't believe them--- Great sushi in this location??? Cant be. Alas, the rolls, sashimi, children's bento box were all very fresh, tasty, not chewy nor fishy smell. Service was excellent, my water was filled three times!  Reasonably priced and not teeny bopperized like Ra Sushi. The ONLY small complaint, no milk for my six year old. I guess  that would taste gross anyway."}
{"text":"The sushi was not that great. The service was not the best,  not planning on going back soon."}
{"text":"Went with the family on Sunday for sushi and grabbed the love boat for 2 with some happy hour rolls (salmon skin, and snow white roll). Overall, the salmon was deliciously buttery but the snapper tasted a bit funky. The Snow White roll was great incorporating snow crab but the happy hour price ($9) didn't make me that happy with every other roll on there being around $4. I think the highlight for me personally was the salmon skill roll which is normally hard to find in Sushi places around Chandler (or they make the recipe kind of odd, or taste burnt).  Overall, I would probably visit again but try some other rolls and stick with Salmon for deliciousness."}
{"text":"I live right down the street from this restaurant and drive past it constantly so my boyfriend and I thought we would give it a try. They also have happy hour all day on Sunday's, so that helped swayed our decision. After waiting about 20 minutes for our food, I ended up getting the Crazy Roll and the boyfriend tried the Dynamite roll. The Crazy roll was supposed to be spicy, but it actually turned out to be extremely sweet and not what I was hoping for at all. Almost had a banana taste to it. I thought  his Dynamite roll was delicious and wish I would have ordered that instead.   Also, even though it says happy hour all day on Sunday's, the speciality rolls are only 20% off AFTER 8:30 that evening. Made this mistake of not reading the fine print."}
{"text":"This place is our absolute favorite! My fiancé lived in CA while we were dating and he would ask for This restaurant as his first and last meal of his trip. We now live in Ahwatukee together and still come here on a regular basis (he even picked this place to purpose to me!!!!) the owners are so delightful and the food is priced incredible . It is fabulous ,fresh and great quality sushi ! It is always clean and they offer an amazing happy hour! I have had other sushi place near us and hands down I will not eat at any other sushi spot in Ahwatukee ! Please support this local Business they truly do a great job here !"}
{"text":"Greatest sushi in town. If you live in ahwatukee it's a must try. Best mom and pop shop ever, try the Sake Bomb"}
{"text":"We stumbled upon this place on New Year's Day. It was pretty difficult finding a restaurant that was open on this day and on our way to the Chandler outlets.  We stopped at a restaurant before this one and it was jampacked! I was not about to wait so I found this place - luckily!  When we walked in, the restaurant was empty. I was surprised because the ambiance is trendy.  I didn't care though and proceeded to order the Volcano roll and Hawaiian roll.  Both were fabulous! I also ordered the tempura red bean ice cream and that one was a fail.  The bowl that it came in was too small and the ice cream was so hard that it felt like it was in the freezer for months.   However, the sushi did hit the spot and they probably saved me from eating at a chain fast food restaurant (yuck).  If you are in the area, I definitely think you should try this place!"}
{"text":"The sushi role is sooooo impressive, best sushi ever!!! As recommended, we order the volcano one which is really stylish look n crispy taste. The tiger roll is more about raw fish mixture which has a really rich taste. Nice service, definitely recommend to others."}
{"text":"The sashimi here is of VERY high quality. Every bite melted in my mouth. It's probably the best I've had in the area. But I can't give them 5 stars because after we were seated and we ordered, we waited 2 hours for most of our food to come out and one of our rolls were forgotten until the very end after we were pretty much done eating. Also saw the waiter give wrong orders to people, and also saw 2 other tables leave because of the wait. Sigh.. I guess it's worth trying out, but I can't justify being a regular here."}
{"text":"Overall this place is pretty sub par. I left with a $50 tab and for the quality of food, I don't think it was worth it. You can get the same thing at teharu for WAY cheaper (granted teharu is not fresh and disgusting). The atmosphere is very nice though. Staff is neither friendly, nor unfriendly, just very quiet. I mean. I'd probably come here again since it's right around the corner from my house but it's not at the top of my sushi restaurant priority list."}
{"text":"I travel for my work and have eaten sushi at over 50 different restaurants and this place hands down has some of the best and most fresh sushi I've ever had. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Pretty close to the best sushi I've had. These guys have a wonderful lunch selection and it's more than reasonable on the wallet. I don't get here during happy hour much, but if I am up for sushi for lunch, it's not too far from my work. They're pretty quick about service, and it's never really packed at lunch. I think many people may not be too familiar with this place. I'd like to see em' get some more business and stick around, although I could be missing the busy nights. Definitely worth a lunch break or two to stop in here for an $8~ sushi bento box lunch. The salmon, yellowtail, and toro are delicious!"}
{"text":"I'm always wary of eating sushi in Arizona so I only try a place out if someone refers me to it. I was thoroughly impressed with this place. The roles were delicious and huge and reasonably priced. Will definitely go again."}
{"text":"Wonderful quality sushi/sashimi here! It was very fresh and the presentation is beautiful! I adored their Pink Lady Roll. The prices are very fair for the quality of food we enjoyed.     The restaurant is sleek, modern, and clean.     The service is slow, but let the staff was friendly. The only complaint I have is that when the waitress accidentally spilled/dropped plates and soy sauce all down my back as she took our dishes, the manager didn't swing by our table. The waitress offered to treat us to dessert, but we were stuffed. It would have been nice to get a discount or even just a \"are you ok?\" from the manager though.     Despite this small snafu,  we'll be back. :)"}
{"text":"Ginban has become our go-to family sushi spot in A-town...it's excellent...only thing holding this pace back is inconsistent service.   The place is modern and stylish, especially considering the strip mall location.  The sushi bar is attractive and functional. There are TVs strategically placed around the restaurant, which is perfect if you want to catch snippets of the Blackhawks playoff match out of the corner of your eye while pretending to give your family your full attention.   The food is outstanding. The salmon sashimi is fresh and delicious and the yellowtail is among the best I've tasted.  I'm not a big roll fan, but the family really likes theirs; especially the Tiger Roll and the Eel Avocado roll.  The Unagi is really good as well. I've also tried the chicken teriyaki, which was good and tastefully presented but not life-changing.   The beer selection is just fine. The usual Japanese staples plus one or two nice surprises (Dog Fish Head 60 Minute IPA, I think!). Could be served colder, but whatever.   I get that handcrafted sushi can take a while, but they need to get it together.  Orders come out at odd times, like last night all three courses of my dinner were served long before the rest of the family received even their first morsel  of delicious raw fish.  There is also the occasional mistake, like the time we received ahi sashimi instead of salmon, but these things happen. One thing that would really help would be if the servers could kick up their attentiveness. They always avoid you like you've got SARS during these awkward long waits.  Invariably we want another beer or to add to our sushi order, but there is no one to be found...or even anyone willing to make eye-contact!  Of course, during a grown-up dinner with epic quantities of sake bombers they should take their sweet-damn-time bringing the fish.   Ultimately, we still love this place despite its flaws. The sushi is worth the wait and we have resolved to plan ahead more, but a little better service would mean a lot regardless."}
{"text":"My husband and I tend to be pretty picky when it comes to sushi, but we really enjoyed the sushi at Ginban...and the saki selection! The ambiance was less trendy than we were hoping for, but the sushi we tried was very good, and our server was very helpful and attentive. Prices weren't too bad either! While not really a date night type of place, we'll be back for more casual nights out."}
{"text":"The tom yum soup here is the best I've ever had. I tried several thai restaurants and they  just dont compare. I order this soud at least twice a week. Can't go wrong with fresh veggies, seafood and a clean broth."}
{"text":"When I first arrived I was greeted and sat at the bar. I ordered the Sushi deluxe with 10 pieces of sashimi and a California roll. The portions were large and at a good price. A small but comfy place. I highly recommend Ginbin and will be back for the happy hour experience. ENJOY!"}
{"text":"Love the specialty rolls here...tiger, dragon, caterpillar are all amazing.  Lunch specials are also delicious"}
{"text":"You know that phrase, 'Don't judge a book by it's cover?' yeah...that's Ginban. This spot is such a surprise. I live in Ahwatukee and have never seen so many sushi restaurants in 1 square mile in my life! so when this spot opened, I stopped by a few weeks ago out of curiosity. (the coupon in the mail helped too).   t's GORGEOUS inside. These folks really take pride in their NEW restaurant. I mean...you should see the bathroom... It's the nicest bathroom I have ever seen with floor to ceiling granite tile and one of those fancy sinks you only see in a swanky resort.   We ordered the jalapeno appetizer and a few other items which were all fantastic and well-priced. The staff was polite and attentive as we dined at about 8pm on a weeknight and of course there were few patrons.  When you want sushi, a fine-dining atmosphere and great service without the Scottsdale prices, go here!"}
{"text":"Nice place with great customer service. Kind of hidden in a strip mall, but once inside everything was good with a quiet atmosphere. Wonderful greeting and service. The food was good and delivered in a timely manner. Did a simple warm sake which was fine. I asked for something special and they more than accommodated my request. Even recommended a better option.  I was visiting the from California and wanted sushi so took a chance. I would definitely return on a regular basis, if I lived in the area."}
{"text":"I called Ginban after waiting an ungodly amount of time at RA for a table for 6- one hour 40 minutes to be exact-after calling RA for reservation.  We arrived and greeted immediately.  Taylor got our drink order and brought our drinks immediately.  We have been here before and were impressed with sushi menu. Tonight not disappointed. We had Evil Roll. Freakin delicious. Also Phoenix roll was incredible!   I have never had bad food or service here. I appreciated them so much more after my HORRIBLE  experience at RA Awhatukee tonight. We will continue to patronize them and Stingray for sushi. And we will avoid F'n Ra altogether!"}
{"text":"I found myself here because I purchased a Groupon...oddly enough, it is right next to the grocery store I frequent every week, and yet I never noticed it. Sometimes I go to  the grocery store to buy sushi rolls, oblivious that I am walking past a sushi restaurant.  That is  because from the outside, it looks like nothing.  At least nothing safe. The windows are completely black.  I had some buyers remorse once I saw the outside.  But, as the saying goes, \"you can't judge a book by it's cover\" because the inside provided the atmosphere I was expecting, down to the fish tank.  I loved the menu.  If you love raw fish, you too will love this menu.  Our dinner was pretty cliche, with miso soup, caterpillar roll, spicy tuna roll, and saki bombers.  At the end, we ordered mochi ice cream, which was totally foreign to me. I am still confused about this item...it is basically ice cream that is covered in chewy candy, like a soft gummy bear (or an Airhead is a better description, if you are familiar with candy).   It reminds me of the time I put chocolate ice cream on my baked potato.  The ice cream absorbed into the potato, leaving me a chocolate potato (and hey, don't judge, if you ever dipped a french fry into a Wendy's Frostie, you know what I am talking about). Anyway, my point -- some things are just texturally an odd pairing, even when they  taste good.  But, the whole thing was covered in whipped cream and drizzled in chocolate sauce.....so, whatever, I'd eat it again."}
{"text":"I can't remember the last time I was positively surprised in the way I was with Ginban.  I'm not sure what my expectations were but they were probably tainted by years of experience dining at mediocre sushi places in strip malls.  When you walk in you notice the really nice decor.  Stone walls, a nice long bar, dark colors...it's exactly what you wouldn't expect from the exterior.  As far as the food is concerned, it is really good.  The fish is super fresh, the rolls are very good, and the prices are completely reasonable.  It is easily the best sushi I've had in Ahwatukee."}
{"text":"I've enjoyed a few visits to this new sushi bar in Ahwatukee, but now that I've tried their \"Ginban roll\" I am a believer.  This small but intimate sushi bar has a nice lunch menu and Happy Hour deals.  The soft shell crab and the Ginban roll are delicious.  Even the chicken fried rice is a good meal. The prices for most of the menu are mid-range, some of the specialty rolls are a bit on the high side.  Thankfully the Ginban roll is only $7 and well worth it."}
{"text":"I am a little bit of a sushi snob...I should have ready some of the reviews.  Short on flavor and the sushi chef needs to be sent home until his cold passes. We were discussed by his sinus problem. My final words....there are better places to eat."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness! All time favorite since they opened! You can't beat their lunch specials & happy hour prices. My whole family is in love and we will be customers forever! Customer service is amazing as well. :)"}
{"text":"I love this place! They have creative rolls and a pretty good happy hour. It is a little pricey, but I do find that they have better quality than others!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Fresh unique rolls that work well together, nice happy hour specials, very friendly customer service, and they are family friendly. It was really great to see that my 7-year old had kids' bento box options to choose from...usually the reason I always have to skip sushi for dinner because there is nothing on the menu he will eat :/   This happened to be my first visit thanks to the high reviews. The place was a little small, but very clean and nice. I came after the typical dinner rush, so there was no wait and the food came out quickly. Our server was exceptional. Since they have a lot of roll options, she gave us recommendations - which were all amazing! Our drinks never went empty and I was really happy with the amount of roll pieces served (and the amount of rice was also perfect). Oh, and you can have your sushi made with brown rice instead - score!   I am really happy I tried this place and will definitely come back and recommend to others."}
{"text":"the food here is delicious there is no denying it...unfortunately the older lady who's a server here ALWAYS has attitude I literally cannot stand it. food is bomb, that lady is annoying and rude."}
{"text":"Best sushi I've had in Arizona so far. That being said most of the sushi I've had here has been terrible. They'll sub brown rice instead of white rice for an additional dollar"}
{"text":"This has been my go to for carry out as a slightly less expensive option than Sushi Ken which is my favorite.   Unfortunately tonight my $55 order was disappointing. I ordered a Rainbow Roll and it came with imitation crab as the filler. Yuk! My spicy tuna hand roll was mixed with some kind of crunchy rice-based product and the tuna roll had like literally 1/3 tuna and 1/3 cucumber and 1/3 rice.   Super dissatisfied- I sure hope that they had a shortage of ingredients but either way will be taking a break from Gingban for a while and if this is their idea of upping their profit margin, I'm gone for good."}
{"text":"Decent sushi and decent prices but horrible service. The waiter was nice but the manager needs to work on her own service skills. We waited an hour for our rolls, and they gave us the wrong rolls twice. They took back the rolls and then we had to wait even longer for the correct rolls - and remember, this happened twice. How about making your customers feel a little better about the experience and let them have the mistake roll (I'm sure cucumbers and rice doesn't equal a huge profit loss). Glad we tried it. Never coming back. I don't think the table that was next to us will either from what we heard."}
{"text":"We had take out the other night because it was cold and just wanted to eat at home. The food was just as fantastic as dining in. We had a couple of specialty rolls and sashimi, all very fresh and tasty."}
{"text":"This was middle of the road sushi. It tasted okay and was reasonably priced, but didn't blow me away. Given how close this restaurant is to Sushi Ken, there's no reason to come here. Sushi Ken is far better."}
{"text":"Eat here. I could stop the review with those two words but I'll add a bit more color. This is hands down the best sushi spot in Phoenix.  I've tried way too many of them.  After a while I got to know the owners, Kenny and Vivian, and they're very nice and accommodating.  Kenny was always willing to make a special off-menu dish (I never asked for one if they were swamped) and they sometimes have specials you won't get in most places, like the time they had a fresh sea urchin (delicious).  Also, get the fresh (real) wasabi.  You won't regret it.    Alas my time in Phoenix ended (a while ago - somehow I forgot to post this review) and this spot is what I miss most.  If you see Kenny and Vivian, tell them I said hello."}
{"text":"I am not one to usually review but for the sake of others fooled to go in like I did due to currently having 4 stars I must warn those that actually like quality sushi.   We sat at the sushi bar. I ordered 2 rolls and boyfriend ordered Bento box teriyaki chicken with shrimp tempura as he is not a sushi fan which comes with salad, soup, California roll, and gyoza $16.  I then noticed some of the fish at the sushi bar were wrapped in paper towels!  That was a first. The restaurant was fairly empty so didn't expect to wait long for food or appetizers but it was 20 minutes before food arrived without the soup or salad. The waitress hadn't even stopped by in that time and had to be notified by the sushi chef (after WE informed him soup and salad we're missing).  She giggled embarrassed and said she forgot them. The sushi chefs did not interact with us the entire time (we were the only ones at the sushi bar) and did not even notice we were not served soup or salad before serving us our meals.   As far as food quality goes: Miso soup was subpar and bland in miso flavor.  Salad subpar in presentation and dressing taste/texture.  Teriyaki chicken very bland and subpar in flavor to even fast food teriyaki.  Shrimp tempura was rubbery and freezer burned flavor Rolls subpar due to bland flavorless rice and poor overall fish quality/taste.  I have never seen spicy tuna the color of bright red Koolaid in all my sushi experiences. (Pictured) Only decent thing about the place was the gyoza and clean environment.   So many better places and should not be rated as high as my two so far favorites Shimogamo or Hana."}
{"text":"Still loving this place and their yummy sushi. You really can't go wrong here and it's a great place if you want more of a quiet experience because it always seems to be a relaxed environment when I come here. I will continue to come here for sure!!!"}
{"text":"This is the best spot for sushi in the chandler, awhatukee area. Prices are very reasonable. Sushi rolls are big and filling. Very clean and always fresh. Been here many times and never had a bad meal."}
{"text":"Unfriendly staff and very slow service. Save your money and go somewhere else. 30 mins wait for a roll when it's not even busy is not worth the wait."}
{"text":"Great place!  I have finally found a place that make a roll similar to what I would get from Sushiya in San Diego.  The roll from Sushiya is called a snowball and the one at Ginban is a Crazy Roll and Ginban's roll is even better!!!!.  I also got a Philadelphia which everyone makes the same so I knew it was a good comparison to start with.    WOW I think I just burst my own bubble...  Well after some looking it seems that other places have a similar roll to a Snowball but call them Jalapeno rolls (deep fried, Inside: Jalapenos, crab, and cream cheese.  Topped with spicy mayo, eel sauce, green onions and masago.)  The only difference with Ginban is that their Crazy Rolls has crunchy spicy salmon, avocado on top.  Everything else is the same.  If I had to choose between RA and Ginban I would pick Ginban every time!  I liked the feel of the place much better and the quality of the sushi was better too.  Ginban is going into our rotation of regular lunch spots."}
{"text":"Awesome happy hour specials - 7 days a week!  Great service and they don't skimp on the sizes.  Love it, love it, love it!"}
{"text":"Great lunch spot.  Quick service with lots of options for a reasonably priced meal.  They also offer fresh wasabi which had me crying!   Miso soup and a salad with all the lunch specials."}
{"text":"When I went here, I only got very basic rolls. We got the avocado roll, sweet potato tempura roll, and I think something with smoked fish in it. With that being said, I didn't really think they were anything special, but I don't think it is fair to judge a sushi place solely based on their simplest rolls. If I were to come back, I think I would get the sweet potato roll again but trry other more fancy rolls as well."}
{"text":"We are fortunate to live just a few miles from this excellent restaurant.  Their Miso Soup is perfection!  We did, on one occasion find that they were out of it.  That's the only thing preventing a 5 Star rating."}
{"text":"Very impressed!  Serene decor, pleasant and attentive service, and a great happy hour menu will keep us dining at Ginban regularly.  Happy hour includes your favorite appetizers, sushi rolls, sashimi, and some saki specials.  Happy hour rolls are $3 to $5.  The full menu has many more sushi creations (try the Crazy Roll) and traditional meal choices.  Prices are very reasonable for the high quality of the food and service.  I recommend the Gyoza appetizer to start - a soft dumpling with a very good grilled flavor.  Nice selection of saki, beer, and drinks also.  I was happy they carry an IPA.  Lots of table seating and about 10 spots at the modern-style sushi bar.  There is good music playing in the background, and two flat screens at the sushi bar....enough to keep you entertained, yet still able to carry on a conversation with your sweetheart and friends.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Went Sunday for Happy Hour ( all day Sunday)  Ninja Jalapeños were on $5 and worth every cent    Also had a few sushi dishes ( whitefish and Tuna) both were fresh although still $3+ each and not really stand out from a sushi train type place where dishes are $2 or so  Anyway would really recommend this for a couple looking for something more than a sushi train.. if you just want a quick cheap bite then maybe try elsewhere"}
{"text":"Super mixed feelings about this spot. When we first walked in, the hostess wasn't the nicest. She pointed us to tables and when we requested the sushi bar, she just pointed to our seats in an annoyed manner. Ok, whatever...  Husband and I sat down an introduced ourselves to the sushi chef. He responded, \"Huh?\", then we repeated ourselves and the same response, \"Huh?\". I thought there was a language barrier, so I didn't think anything of it...Until we ordered. Turns out the dude DOES speak English and apparently didn't feel like talking to us. Ok...whatever...  We checked out the Happy Hour menu and ordered 2 large hot sake's, spicy tuna roll and salmon roll. Now, I'm not a huge fan of sushi rolls. My husband likes to order a roll as a \"sample\" to see how it's prepared, how sweet the sauce is and what the rice is like. Kinda like a taste test. I prefer sashimi ( No rice - extra radish.) The rolls were ok. They tasted like rolls. Not great and not bad. Then came our sake bombs. 2 large ones. The beer was room temperature and the sake was ok. Then came our 2 salads - Seaweed and Sushi bar salad. Sushi bar salad was made to order. Cucumber noodles made in front of us. SUPER GOOD! Then 2 more sake bombs! Then we moved on to albacore nigri, tuna nigri and salmon skin roll. Then the hand rolls arrived and I don't know WHY, but they stuff theirs with romaine lettuce. Romaine lettuce?! WHY?! Totally fucking annoying!  As I'm drinking my beer, my husband elbows me and together we see the sushi chef open a shrink wrapped piece of frozen tuna, place it on a paper towel, (without rinsing it) and he proceeds to plate it into the sushi case. WHAT THE DID WE JUST SEE?! I get it, we're in the desert, but can you defrost the frozen fish in the back and MAKE us THINK it's fresh? So many questions were being asked in my head. Not OK. No one wants to see that.  The service from the waitress ended up being really good. She was super prompt with our $2.50 powdered miso soups and drinks and she did check on us often.   We went for happy and spent close to $90. Will I go back? Probably not."}
{"text":"I've been here twice already and both times I ordered the bento box. There is a bunch of selections and you choose two of them, in my case I picked the shrimp tempura and sashimi. I'll include a picture, there's so much food that I barely finish! Very good. The service is great too. The server was very attentive."}
{"text":"Decent, something that's close by.. been here a couple times and never had bad experience.. my boyfriend likes the yakisoba here. Their ramen is okay but nothing out of the ordinary and sushi is okay .. it's something close to crave my sushi craving whenever I want sushi and I don't want to drive to DOZO lol"}
{"text":"Great food, but some of the servers are a little slow.  The core staff is awesome, but they seem to have done problems with new servers."}
{"text":"Yum! The food here is absolutely delicious. I got the bento box dinner; which was a ton of food. and my friends got rolls and the 5 piece sushi combo. The Sushi was so good! The fish was fresh and tender and the rice was great, not falling apart like some places i've been to. The service was exceptional. Our waiter was so sweet and attentive. I also really liked the environment. It was classy without being too upscale. definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Basis for my starred ratings (which skews heavily to the food or drink): 1 star:  Never again. 2 stars:  Poor food, poor experience, extraordinary measures in order for me to come back. 3 stars:  Average, nothing really special, nothing particularly bad. 4 stars:  Very good, would definitely return. 5 stars:  A favorite, one of the best.  I'm typically loathe to give a 2-star review to a place that's clean and where the service was good enough, but given the quality of the food, I'm surprised by the rating here.  Less surprised if they are based mostly on ordering rolls, where extra rice, sauce, and other fillings hide the quality of the fish.  Tried to order oysters and uni on a Wednesday.  Said they don't have any - typically only on Fridays and Saturdays.  I've tried to keep this fact out of my review.  Started with the soft shell crab and ordered the sushi deluxe for my entree.  My concerns were initially raised with the soup and salad.  Typical salad with citrus/ginger dressing.  Grainy and overly sweet.  They use white miso in their miso soup and it was essentially flavorless - not enough miso.  But these were free add-ins so tried to get past that.  Soft shell crab comes out, panko crusted - it is well prepared.  The sauce that comes with it is quite good.  Probably the best thing I ate that night with the exception of the black meat in the crab.  You expect a certain amount of muddiness in eating the black meat, but this was off-muddy.  The legs and white meat portions were great, but my concerns of the freshness of the crab based on the black meat leads me to  my sushi.  Nigiri with a spicy tuna roll.  The spicy tuna roll was neither here nor there - under-flavored but passable.  They give you two pieces of nigiri for almost every type of fish on the plate except the more expensive fish - like yellowtail.  They're running a business, I can ignore that too.  I couldn't ignore the rice to fish ratio, which was far too much rice.  And I couldn't ignore that fact that the rice was coming straight from the open rice cooker into the sushi, meaning it is most likely not seasoned at all and if it is, it is with the flavoring powder, which i still couldn't taste when I tried to rice on its own.    The quality of the fish was not good.  The salmon was very sinewy.  The tuna (not albacore) was my biggest concern.  The freshest tuna has almost no flavor.  The best tuna for sushi, after a couple days, opens up flavors of the actual fish but more like the blood and irony richness that accompanies it, along with some brininess.  This tuna was past that.  Fishy and too soft.  With the exception of a few fish (i.e. mackerel), no sushi fish should taste fishy.    Same goes for the albacore and other fish on the plate.  The yellowtail was passable, as was the escolar (aka white \"tuna\").    I get it.  You get what you pay for, and this place is pretty cheap.  But even for a local joint, the value of the meal here can't overcome the deficiencies in the fish that they serve, which is really, really subpar.  Plenty of non-Japanese owners have opened up very good sushi joints, but this is not one of them."}
{"text":"The restaurant has a nice atmosphere and friendly staff. I found the food to be quite good - had the five piece sushi and the ninja jalapeños and everything was delicious. Would certainly eat here again."}
{"text":"Very strange service. We arrived a few minutes before happy hour ended, and the waiter waited until 6:00 exactly and then came to our table. Of course they would not honor happy hour menu. No worries -- I figured it was an honest mistake. We tried to order juice or lemonade for my son, but they \"had just run out\". Then I ordered a Kirin, and a different server brought a Kirin Light. I let them know the mistake, and they said if I hadn't poured it into my glass they could have put the bottle cap back on and not wasted it. Embarrassed on their behalf, I offered to keep the wrong beer. I guess the Sushi would have to be phenomenal for me to want to come here again, but I'll never know because I would be worried the sushi was prepped correctly given the other problems in such a short span of time."}
{"text":"Was excited to try his place. Our server was nice, but hardly came to the table. When we first sat down, we weren't greeted by her until maybe 20 minutes in. Drinks were slow to come as was food. This was a Friday night, but they weren't very busy. The sushi itself was just okay. I'll usually over look bad serving for good food, but unfortunately the sushi wasn't that great. Although the Bang Bang Shrimp appetizer was awesome, everything else fell short. Sushi is my favorite food, and I've eaten at probably close to 20+ sushi restaurants, but sadly I won't be coming back to this one."}
{"text":"The sushi is good. We were here for reverse happy hour on a Saturday night. It's wasn't busy maybe 4 other tables beside ours. Service slow, food slow to come out and it's pricey considering it's reverse happy hour."}
{"text":"The sushi is amazing and the staff are extremely nice! Couldn't ask for anything more from a sushi restaurant!"}
{"text":"best sushi i have had in ahwatukee/chandler by a good margin"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem. The quality is far better than most sushi restaurants in the area. The place is a little unassuming from the outside but the food is outstanding."}
{"text":"I usually order for takeout and the food is always fresh and friendly service. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Friendly service, great food and nice atmosphere there, best happy hour deal, I will definitely  back !"}
{"text":"Their menu is very deceiving. What are advertised as happy specials are not really. Also, the service is poor."}
{"text":"This place is pretty amazing.  Went there Friday for lunch the first time. Their rolls were really good. Awesome volcano roll.  The sashimi was also very good and fresh. Definitely order the fresh wasabi.  Reasonably priced also."}
{"text":"Was on lunch break with my co works and find this 4 start rated place, was exited to try stuff out and only found disappointment.  One of my co work and I ordered the bento box lunch, I had chicken teriyaki and he had beef teriyaki; I hate to say it, but it's probably the worst chicken teriyaki I have ever had in Arizona (so far).  I feel like I can cook better chicken teriyaki at home, it literally taste like the meat was microwaved and the teriyaki sauce was so light I can barely taste it.  I have been to Japan number of times, visited San Francisco Seattle New York Boston and more, even Minnesota have better bento boxes, and that state is no where near the ocean.  I gave it 2 stars because the sushi roll was okay. If you visit this place just for sushi I'll say go for it, it's not the best but it's fine.  One more thing, for the waitress who served us, I took 1 start off because of you. If a customer tell you that they don't like the food because it doesn't taste good, don't fight with them (like you did today), especially when they are the customer, just say I'm sorry you don't like it we will try to improve next time :)"}
{"text":"Don't really understand the stellar reviews but that could be entirely because of what I ordered. We were the first patrons of the restaurant so our service was pretty good and the food came out hot. The quality was lacking, though. I had the bento box lunch with chicken teriyaki, which came with rice, the chicken, two wontons, California rolls, and orange wedges. The roll was alright and the wontons were very good but the chicken was incredibly bland. I could barely taste the teriyaki sauce on it, and just didn't taste like anything. Maybe I'll come back here and try just the sushi instead of what I already had, but there are other places I'll probably visit before I come back."}
{"text":"I have a love hate relationship with this place. We tried it for the first time on SAT on the way back from the outlets. The younger gentlemen who greeted us was super friendly, sat us right away and brought our drinks over right away too. However, he was the ONLY part of the service that night that was good. The waitress who took our order seemed new? She didn't know what agedashi tofu was and didn't seem very happy to be there and neither did the other two waitresses (one of them being the owner). However,  I will say that the food is great! This is probably THE BEST moderately priced sushi you will get in AZ. I'm from Hawaii so I know fresh sushi/sashimi! : )   We ordered the following items.  APPETIZER: Agedashi Tofu - this was EXCELLENT! VERY lightly battered, perfect crisp and the dash broth surprisingly was the perfect soupy consistency and not too salty!  SUSHI: We ordered the Spicy Scallop Sushi (Gunkan), and the Sweet Potato Tempura Roll. The Spicy Scallop was pretty fresh, no the best I've had but definitely not bad. The consistency of the rice here is fairly decent! The sweet potato roll I could love it or leave it. The sweet potato was crispy and delicious but I think because it was piping hot when it was rolled up, it ended up heating up the rice a bit and making it a tad mushy.  BENTO: We ordered the Combination Bento Box with Salmon and Beef Teriyaki. It came with a full size California roll. The roll had very little rice which I can definitely appreciate and the inside was STUFFED so the bento box was a great deal!! It also came with miso soup and a side salad.  MISC: We decided to try the Shrimp Yaki-Udon. The udon could've been a bit more al dente but overall, not too shabby at all!!  As the evening progressed our wait staff became more friendly which was nice and the busser (who was also the one who initially greeted us at the door) was super diligent about drink refills and taking away the dishes we were finished with.  In regards to the decor, it's very chic! It's a new spot so it's super clean. The interior finishes are all very modern and the both times we've been here it's been a nice and quiet dining experience. I'll definitely be back!! : )"}
{"text":"Awesome!  Great sushi quality and reasonably priced.  We ordered the sushi and sashimi combo and it came with the Ginban roll.  Both dishes were excellent and the presentation was beautiful.  We also  tried the crazy roll.   It's piled high with soft shell crab meat.  My wife loved it. The staff was very attentive and the facility is clean and beautifully decorated."}
{"text":"Came here for the reverse HH and service was attentive. The apps and rolls I tasted were yummy and server had good suggestions. My favorite roll was not the healthiest roll..the Ginban roll. I also had a small Kirin and shared a sake.  I liked this modern & comfortable new sushi spot.  It's in the Lakewood shopping center next to Fry's.  I would gladly return."}
{"text":"I have waited to post a review until I've been to visit this place several times. Mainly this allows me to judge the consistency of the food quality. Now, it is my and my son's favorite.  The rolls are very creative. Going in for the tuna nigiri alone is worth it. The best quality tuna I've had in Arizona."}
{"text":"I love this place for sushi! They have the best fresh fish selection. Nigiri, spicy tuna are my favorites and the scorpion roll when I want a specialty roll. I just wish they had more servers to take order and money--especially when they are busy you can wait a long time because only the owner takes orders/money."}
{"text":"I came here for a quick lunch, and I got a salmon avocado roll.  Pretty good service, and I liked the decor.  I would definitely come back to try some other things.  It looked like they had some interesting rolls."}
{"text":"Decided to try this new sushi place near home. I have to say I was very pleased. Service was very pleasant and prompt. The sushi menu is extensive and extremely high quality. If your looking for great sushi in tukee skip Sushi Ken and head to Ginban!"}
{"text":"Yum!  I came here last Friday for lunch with Sarah H and Dan H.  We ordered a couple of rolls and a sashimi plate and everything was delicious.  Even better was a we saw a sign for all day happy hour on Sundays.  We'll be back."}
{"text":"After going to three different sushi places and finding two incredibly long waits and one we sat a table and no-one came; we left after 15 minutes.   So off we went and we found Ginban and called, they said no wait. We arrived and found only one table sat, we were a little apprehensive about the quality due to the short wait but after a quick look around the restaurant; it has such great decor, even the restrooms are amazing!   Now on to the food! Incredible yellow tail, and delicious seared tuna. The rolls: caterpillar and evil one! Seriously amazing.   Do yourself a favor and visit Ginban. It is now our favorite."}
{"text":"Came here craving teriyaki chicken and wanting to try a new Japanese place. Overall, the experience was OK. We were seated quickly, but afterwards, service was on the slower side, especially when waiting for the main dish.  Miso soup and salad were decent, but the teriyaki chicken was -- like other reviews have stated -- bland. On the positive side, the portion was large and consisted of juicy chicken breast instead of cheap, fatty meat. The vegetables were also yummy and well-marinated. However, this dish cannot be called chicken teriyaki. The sauce was thin and had an oniony flavor (from the onion base below the chicken) instead of being thicker and distinctly teriyaki.  Unsatisfied with the food, so would not come again."}
{"text":"We live so close and keep talking but finally tried!!!! AMAZING! So fresh and tasty! Roger is great and we enjoyed ourselves! I know why this becomes a local fave place! I think this will be our once a week eat out spot since I cook daily! Walking distance!"}
{"text":"I was so surprised by the quality of sushi served by this little shop hidden in a strip mall in ahwatukee. I came with a couple co-workers for happy hour and tried many items. The best item was the jalapeno boats with sicy tuna...yum! Prices were good. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"We really enjoyed our first visit to the new sushi place in Ahwatukee, Ginban Sushi.  We ordered the Yellowfin Jalapeño appetizer which was sooo delish...my favorite part of our meal.   We then ordered the Sashimi Deluxe entree to share, as well as the Dancing Dragon roll.  The Sashimi entree was a site to be seen...sliced raw yumminess served in a bowl over ice with lots of decorative touches, including a multicolored disco light that shined through the ice.  The roll was quite tasty too.  One of our servers (we had several who took care of our table...not sure which one actually got the tip) gave us some the non-pasty wasabi (more fresh) to taste...that was a nice addition.  We really love Sushi Ken, but will probably be back to Ginban again in the future."}
{"text":"I got a bento box and sushi rolls..Food was bland, chicken was dry. Just like the photos, not many customers, very empty but now I see why. I've had better sushi. Prices were about average for sushi location."}
{"text":"Very fresh ingredients. This is the best sushi take-out in Ahwatukee, we order way too often from this place... Make sure to always ask for what the chef/owner recommends for the day. If you like a spicy sushi, ask for the Evil Roll, it's not on the menu.  Sunday all day happy hour!"}
{"text":"Ginban is the best sushi bar in the Ahwatukee area! The sushi here is very fresh and delectable! I suggest the Snow White roll and Ginban roll. Also, the Bang Bang Shimp appetizer is tasty! You'll most likely meet Vivian, she is the best and always remembers my favorites with a side of eel sauce!  Happy hour starts at 8pm Tuesday-Saturday and ALL DAY on Sunday! They are now closed on Monday, but go and visit Tuesday-Sunday."}
{"text":"Hidden gem! This place has great sushi. We ordered 4 different rolls (Ginban, RockyII, Scorpion & Tootsy) and an appetizer (Crab Rangoon) and we're not disappointed at all. Definitely worth trying. We'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"I am not always the best at admitting that I may have been wrong. In this case, I was definitely wrong. The first time that we went over a year ago must have been a bad night. After multiple friends telling us that we had to try this spot again (even though I said that we \"never\" would) we gave it another try. It was spot on. The kid loved her Chicken Katsu. The hubby had some kind of roll and asked for no cucumber and avocado (God forbid he ate something green) and that was no issue for them like it is in some restaurants. They also split some gyoza and calamari and it was gobbled up very quickly. And for those of you looking for a Keto/Low Carb option check out the Lollipop roll (no rice). I will tell you I am a little tired of sashimi while eating low carb when I go out to sushi, but this was a really awesome option for me. The service was good, the food was good, the Happy Hour prices were good and we will be back. They deliver too (not sure how I feel about sushi being delivered in the AZ desert heat, but who knows - never say never with this place is one thing that I have learned)."}
{"text":"Sunday lunch, wife and I looking for a new sushi place. Both ordered bento dinner box. Online menu says 10$, but not available Sunday, when it's 16$. Atmosphere nice, but was too warm for our comfort.  Soup and salad pretty good. My sashimi....... average tasting. Tempura veggies were soggy and greasy. Tempura shrimp not a light dry batter. Gyoza, pretty good. California roll, average. Service satisfactory, but not much more. Overall, this won't be our New sushi place."}
{"text":"The sushi here was very good.... Extremely fresh and one of the better places I've eaten at. The service was also very good and the staff were extremely polite and friendly. The price was as reasonable as any other sushi restaurant in Arizona, so comparatively I'd recommend making the drive from wherever you're at."}
{"text":"Not the best sushi...bad service and pricey. I wont be coming back. The rolls were ok but again very pricey."}
{"text":"Definitely the sushi place of my choice next time I'm in the area!  Restaurant was a little dark, very unpopulated but we weren't exactly there at lunch or dinner time.... service was good, not exceptional but definitely not lacking for anything we needed or asked for!  The sushi? Very well put together, I love when you don't lose half your rice in your soy/wasabi dipping sauce!  Good sized portions and fresh, definite sushi-quality fish!  We'll see you again Ginban!"}
