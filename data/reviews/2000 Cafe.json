{"text":"Just ate here for the first time. I ordered the general tso's chicken combo. It was $8.00 total at dinner and easily could feed two. I have half of my order left to eat in the fridge. Food was cooked well, had a good temperature, flavor, and taste. I would recommend. Owners seem nice as well."}
{"text":"I pass probably 6 other Chinese places to get food here. The food is always good and the prices are good too. 4* because they never have coupons like their competition..... It is great food to go. I would feel more comfortable eating in my car than the dining room there."}
{"text":"Definitely my favorite Chinese-American restaurant in the region. I'm here multiple times a week faithfully and haven't once been let down. Food is served relatively quick and the owners, whom I see there every night are very polite and kind. Don't know what I'd do without cafe 2000 takeout. I've eaten inside a couple times but the dining area isn't the most updated nor the biggest. I feel most of their business is to-go anyways, considering they've been one of the only long-standing Chinese restaurants in Gastonia."}
{"text":"My favorite Chinese to go place! The lady who normally runs the place is very on top of things. I have a large family, so our orders are fairly large and she always makes sure we have everything we ordered. I don't think we have ever had anything missing or wrong. Even though they are always busy, they are quick and efficient and the food is always great!! You definitely get a good amount of food for your money. The dining area could use some work but it's definitely not the worse I've ever seen."}
{"text":"First of all, we stopped here before going on to our hotel for the night, so we ate in.  Everything was clean, but plain.  The air carried what seemed like a lot of the cooking oil.  Take out would be better, but we didn't want to sit in the car any longer. We had generous quantities of food.  I couldn't even finish my Teriyaki Chicken on a Stick with fried rice.  I didn't get a strong 'teriyaki' flavor, and my husband said his Garlic Chicken was unlike anything he's had elsewhere, but the food was good. The service was quick and friendly.  Three stars because ... Well, it was just good.  I wouldn't drive out of my way to stop there."}
{"text":"The food is good but this place is filthy.  The dining area, bathroom, and drink station are nasty every time we have been there and since we live close and the foods good, it's a matter of convenience.   Nasty nasty the health department should address their sanitation (lack there of!)"}
{"text":"I eat here often.The food is good and the service is great. Most of the time they know my order as soon as I come in!"}
