{"text":"The city so needed the Public Market - there are lots of great vendors and now that the local farmers are back for the summer it's even better. Plus you've got to love the idea of a small retail business incubator that can help bring more new and exciting businesses to life in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Jist - Go if you are hungry and want a snack/meal; or specialty items that you are willing to pay more $$ for  Peronsally - I dunno...from the outside I thought it would be really big..but it was kind of a let down. I mean definitely specialty foods kind of place so if that is what you are going there for then yeah you prob. be stoked. If you are thinking farmers market (cheap produce - then don't bother)  I would prob. go back but on empty stomach to try more of the prepared foods. For me that means trying: *  greek food  *  carribean/jamacian joint - they had ox tail & jerk chicken! * marshmallows * maybe swig of their specialty beer  Only thing we ended up buying were the homemade peroigies as we already had brunch so weren't hungry. And we really loved the peroigies."}
{"text":"No free parking that I could find but it was cool little market area all indoors."}
{"text":"I was shocked and dismayed to discover that the \"new\" Pittsburgh Public Market still looks and feels like a flea market in a run-down discount department store. Little atmosphere to speak of. No real charm or character. The floor is dirty and scarred from the days when the building was used as a warehouse. I recommend it be stripped down to the bare concrete. What vibe there is exists mainly in and around the areas of certain merchants. Other merchants look severely bored and depressed.   The Strip District could benefit from a true first-class indoor Public Market in close proximity, one like the North Market in Columbus, Ohio, the West Side Market in Cleveland, the Reading Terminal Market in Philadelphia, or dozens of similar markets. But to have one like those will take serious cooperation and commitment from a lot of different people and organizations in this city, and right now I don't see evidence that it will happen any time soon, which is puzzling when you consider the size of Pittsburgh.   It would be an insult to say this market is a joke, even though that word bounces around my head whenever I'm there. They've struggled to stay afloat and find a suitable space and worked hard to get it into some kind of shape. But it needs a lot more work. There are plenty of creative minds in this town who could turn it into a more aesthetically pleasing space that bustles with activity. Let's hope they do it."}
{"text":"Let's be clear right up front; this grade is for the Market as a whole, not the individual vendors. East End Brewing, Caffe D'Amore, Crested Duck, these are all great, vital businesses.  But the rest of the market is just a jumble of half-baked ideas. The old space was pretty but felt unfinished, so I was hopeful when they moved to a new space...sadly, it's even worse. The space has all the charm of a garage, and little is done to give it a market feeling. Also, the selection of vendors leans too heavily on pre-prepared foods and home goods. Why isn't the farmer's market at the firehouse part of this? Where are the local farmers with fresh produce? Other than picking up a growler from East End and a latte from Caffe D'Amore, why am I here?  People give Cleveland a bad rap, but their West Side Market devastates this showing (Hell, it gives the whole Strip District a run for its money). With all of the abundant produce and farms in this, one of the most fertile regions in the county, it's sad that our public market is so disappointing."}
{"text":"It's hard to rate a place like the ppm, it's seriously a lot of different vendors all in one place. It's bound to have flaws that have nothing to do with the idea as a whole and more to do with the individual stands. So, here are two reviews: Firstly, as a public market. It's clean, well lit, open on nice days, temperature controlled on days that are not so nice, free parking on the weekends, most the stands are full all the time, and it's always getting better. Secondly, as a narrative - of sorts. Every time I go into the ppm, I take a quick look at Sustenance bakery, they're an awesome little operation I first found in little single serve pouches available at 21st coffee and Voluto coffee, but with ppm they have their own little shop front, with more options and less coffee (unless you count, La Prima, which I don't). I don't pick anything up from Sustenance until I'm on my way out, but it's good to get a glimpse. I've only been a few times since they opened the library outpost and I haven't done anything expect see what's on the shelves, but it looks appealing and as a mechanism for moving the library model into the 21st century it seems like a great idea. The first aisle is worth walking down just for the marshmallow folks, because who doesn't appreciate a good marshmallow? In the same aisle is a meat stand, Crested Duck, they have a lot of expensive stuffs that are totally worth the price, so if you can find it in your budget, try something. Following that is the guy trying to make me eat british food, I'm not sure how this stand exists, but to each his own I suppose. The quiet storm used to have a little booth at the end, but that disappeared, which makes sense as I never thought anything looked worth purchasing. On the weekends there are some great little produce booths at the other end from the front doors. The second aisle is pretty lame, I just walk past the beads, indian grocer, and olive oils, down to Clarion River Organics. If you've lived in Pittsburgh for more than a month, then you know they're a coop of organic producers putting out high quality stuff on a regional scale. It's nice to find them here, but you can also get their produce at other markets in the city. Then past La Prima, because the coffee is sad and you're likely to be bothered to try a sample of fudge from the man behind you, if you stand there too long. At the end of the third aisle there's a booth with fresh mushrooms and ramps, can't beat the prices and quality. The final aisle has an East End Brewery Growler filling station and the booth selling frozen pierogi, both of which are okay for getting something for dinner. The booth in the back selling baklava used to be amazing the first couple of weeks, but then everything started going downhill, I don't even stop there anymore. Then back to Sustenance before leaving. There are more stands than those I mentioned, I just didn't think they were worth mentioning. It all boils down to this: it's worth your time to do some shopping here, but it's not 100% awesome."}
{"text":"We were in the Pittsburgh's Strip District and came across the Pittsburgh Public Market.  Little did we know, they were open on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays.  We decided to check it out as admission was free.  It is located at the corner of 17th and Smallman, you will see a sign that says \"Open - Pittsburgh Public Market\".  The market is a mixed of art & crafts, food and produce vendors.  More stuff to buy than eat unfortunately.  We got there it was the end of the day, there was not much activity or variety left.  I recommend getting there early to more variety.  It is worth stopping by if you are in the Strip district on the days the market is open."}
{"text":"Like others who have submitted their feedback for the Pittsburgh Public Market, I had been hearing good things for awhile for this relatively new endeavour that went up in the Strip District. I started to feel like a horrible resident of the city for not checking it out myself, so I made plans for the classic, Pittsburgh Saturday morning--a stroll in the Strip District--to get a chance to see for myself. I took along my husband, some friends, and my parents for the trial run and all agreed that it was a great experience.  I was completely delighted with the public market from start to finish. There are a lot of great quality shops packed into this medium-sized market. The space is indoors, airy, and sunny (surprisingly so, since it is in one of the produce terminal stalls). I believe I stopped at almost every vendor there and the sellers were all so nice. Even though there were a lot of customers there, people were polite and the atmosphere was relaxed. It was a good way to wile the morning away, perusing the organic produce, homemade breads, specialty olive oils, hand crafted bath products, and beautiful baked tarts, amongst many other things. There are also great food vendors here, so you can get some lunch too. You can grab a coffee from the LaPrima stand and walk around or go to Soup Nancy's for grilled cheese and a handful of soup options, get fresh pierogies from Gosia's, order a Mediterranean salad (they also had wraps, but that salad looked divine), or even eat some Caribbean fare at Kahila's. Check their website for the most up-to-date merchant list to see what they have to offer.   If you have guests in town and want to show them some of the cool, local things to do, this would be a perfect option for a way to spend a weekend morning."}
{"text":"I was really excited for the opening but was slightly disappointed. I hope it expands and becomes more of a marketplace. I'm still hopeful."}
{"text":"I can't believe it took me this long to visit the PPM. I've always been a fan of the Strip district and the PPM adds another must-hit destination for a Saturday in the strip.  It is a collection of vendors - most are the small/med sized Pittsburgh businesses that don't have a full shop, but can run a solid operation out of a weekend stall.  We visited for the first time when we were on an adventure to find the Pittsburgh Marshmellow company (awesome/amazing!). But while there we sampled tons of baked goods.  I wanted to buy pierogies and pick up a growler from East End - but I was running out of hands and time.  And they have bathrooms!  I will definitely make this a regular destination on the weekends!"}
{"text":"This place put a huge smile on my face.  Nestled in an industrial area, within some rough looking loading docks are treasures that shouldn't be overlooked.  I'm not a local so I have no idea of it's beginnings or the direction it is heading, but I like what it was and see so much potential.  Quality artisinal meat products, gourmet marshmallows (ghost pepper marshmallow!), local brew, homemade cheesecakes from former NFL players (sweet potato cheesecake!), and they have a walk up pizza window outside.  Pittsburgh, really?  You guys are lucky.  #fattyweekend"}
{"text":"I love the market. We usually go there on Saturdays, but sometimes I will sneak out of work at lunch to pick up a $5 lunch special (SUCH A DEAL). I have tried the mexican (I like the potato filling), pasta (try the blue cheese and sweet potato pierogi's), vegan kielbasa (not my thing, but not bad), icecream (they are all amazing), and some of the oils from the olive press (I like lime EVOO).   Overall a great place to try, and they are open every day."}
{"text":"Pittsburgh Public Market is quickly becoming Pittsburgh's source for all that is local. Even in the winter the place is bustling on the weekends, selling all kinds of locally made wares.  My favorite booth, and the one you see first when entering, is Crested Duck Charcuterie. They sell all kinds of handmade cured meats, cheeses and sausages. I picked up a pound of their REAL (that means no dyes or artificialness) hickory smoked bacon. I told the man behind the counter to slice it as thick as is appropriate for bacon and what I got was so far beyond anything you could buy in a grocery store. It was delicious.  Grass fed beef, eggs from free range hens--it's all here. In fact, there's a lot here that you aren't looking for, and just kind of stumble into such as Kombucha. It caught my eye and when the woman behind the counter explained what it was, I had to have it. Essentially, it's a fermented tea drink that's someone between tea, wine and beer.  Homemade pierogies are sold at the far wall and the lady will practically toss a sample into your hands. They're crispy and delicate, a far cry from the frozen variety you buy from Giant Eagle.  If you have a sweet tooth, you'll have a hard time deciding where to sooth it. There are at least three booths selling some incredibly tasty looking baked goods.  As I said earlier, I can't wait to see this place in the summer when it's harvesting time and I can't wait to go back for some eggs and meat from a town I can actually drive to!"}
{"text":"Just stopped in. Great place. But hidden away is a small  lebanese food stand. It's amazing! Nice older couple with just amazing food. Try it out!"}
{"text":"Pittsburgh has changed alot in the zillion years i've been living far away from home. I first hears of this place when this years yelp event was located here. My sister and I immediately fell in love. The following weekend, we came back to the strip for a visit.   I like the community feel of the stalls. Fits in the strip district feel.  You can even get bruton's milk here! I'm not a milk fan, but if you can score Bruton's chocolate milk... you MUST try! The dairy farm is about 10 minutes from my mom's house... and their chocolate milk is killer!   When you enter the market, to the left is a wooden store (for lack of better words). Basically every product is made out of work. Everything inside is so beautiful and interesting.   It's a great place to walk around and spend an hour or two!"}
{"text":"Prepared food, pierogies, cheese, beer.  Great place to stop for bite or to fill a growler while you're shopping in the Strip.  I even adopted my cat from here!"}
{"text":"Trying to find the entrance to this place somewhere along an endless loading dock, we asked a local.  \"Are you from out of town?\" he asked.  Yup.  He said, \"Keep moving.  If you've been to any other public market in any other town, this one's a bust.\"  Harsh.  And not entirely true.    I both really liked and was slightly disappointed by the Pittsburgh Public Market.  I liked that the vendors who are here, for the most part, are excellent.  Pittsburgh Marshmallow Factory, Cosimano e Ferrari infused olive oils and specialty balsamics, The Berry Patch jams and jellies, Crested Duck Charcuterie...and, best of all, East End Brewing Company.  Husband and I paid a *buck* each for 4 oz samples all four beers currently on tap: Monkey Boy Hefeweisen, Big Hop IPA, Black Strap stout, and Pedal Pale Ale.    But when I think \"market,\" I always envision fresh produce, and lots of it.  There was a serious dearth of vendors selling fruits and veggies, which is really where most of my disappointment came from.  Otherwise tho, this little market is a great way to pass a bit of time and to get familiar with some local Pittsburgh businesses."}
{"text":"I think I have been to Pittsburgh at least 10 times and every time I come to town we make the trek down to the strip district on Sunday to browse all the shops. There are plenty of stores and stands and foods to choose from. I was surprised to see the amount of Pirate gear being hawked on the sidewalks usually no matter what time of the year it is it's all Steeler gear. I actually picked myself up a Roberto Clemente shirt to bring back to Chicago.  I highly recommend the spice store, the coffee shop, and the doughnut shop as stops that need to be made. Also if you need anything Steeler this is the place to go."}
{"text":"I am quite a fan of the Public Market.  It's filled with booths from a variety of small local businesses.  It doesn't replace what's in the Strip, it just adds to what you can find.    Sometimes I forget that the apple guy is only there on Saturdays.  While that's disappointing, I completely understand.  He's a full time farmer.  It's one of my favorite things to buy, I think he has the best apples in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"I can't believe I haven't reviewed this place yet!   I LOVE the Pittsburgh Public Market. I could easily spend hours here. There's so much to see! Basically, the market is a spot where vendors can rent out spaces for different amounts of time. I've seen some come & go & others have been there since the beginning. It's  a great place to take a group of people or those who can't agree on something to eat/drink. There's a winery, brewery (East End), mexican food, indian food, pasta (Ohio City Pasta), a bakery (Eliza's Oven), ice cream, kombucha, fresh produce, olive oil, clothing, etc. There's a little bit of everything in this wonderful place.  Every time I stop, I visit East End Brewery. They have wonderful beers & the staff is always so helpful & friendly. I also always stop at Ohio City Pasta. I have yet to order a meal there- instead, I buy pasta bundles to take home, and occasionally their sauces. Their fresh pasta is out of this world good- my personal favorites being the spicy lime cilantro, tomato basil & roasted red pepper. I also always take a peek at the goodies that Eliza's oven has. Her baked goods are insanely delicious and very unique.  If you haven't been to the market, GO. It's wonderful & magical & you won't regret it."}
{"text":"If you love diverse fresh local food then this is the place for you. I have been here twice now and each time I have been blown away by how amazing the offerings are. I really like Eliza's Oven. I mean come on desserts that have a verity of alcohol in them. You can't go wrong. Combine that with East End Brewing, Soup Nancy's, and La Palapa you have all the makings of one very delicious shopping trip. You can honestly feel the passion from all the vendors. I love that they know what they're serving. They know the ingredients and speak to every aspect of the business. If you are like me and love shopping local then I recommend getting here now."}
{"text":"I love, love, LOVE, the Pittsburgh Public Market! The combination of great food, friendly people, delicious beer, and great items to purchase makes for a whole day of fun! This is a great community space that offers such a great place to take friends from out of town, family members, and go on a regular basis. I'd spend every weekend there if I could!"}
{"text":"It so happens I'm one that visits Markets every City I visit. As much as I want to support eat local, buy local... This Market was just a downer for out-of-towners. Fact that any City's Market is an important establishment. This seemed anti-climatic as to what Pittsburgh has to offer.  I felt slightly embarassed hyping that we were going to a Market. Big plans of strolling, seeing sights, snacking, local people watching. Nope. This was not meant to be.  What am I missing here?  I was walking all along the building looking for the entrance. Apparently it's at only one end of the sizable brick building. The square footage of the space occupied by shops was minimal.  In fact, I wasn't sure why they had attendants charging for Parking there. When you simply can parallel park minutes away for Free on Penn Ave. I was walking down those Paid Parked Cars and the Attendant didn't pay attention. When I walked past him, he wanted to charge me. I said I didn't park there. Done  Penn Ave Shop/Crowd made Pittsburgh Public Market look like a 7-11 convenience."}
{"text":"The Public Market is still better in concept than in practice, but they have a pretty solid footing now, less than 6 months after opening their doors.  What you have here is an indoor, year-round place for some thirty-odd vendors -- mostly local artisans, farmers, and other small entrepreneurs -- to hawk their wares. Some of these little businesses will fail, and others might grow enough to leave the Public Market, but what's really important is that these booths are compelling enough to offer and keep a steady stream of traffic to these local businesses.  Much of this stuff can be bought elsewhere, and a lot of it can be bought at other places in the Strip (teas, cider, meats, fudge, bread). But a lot of these places are unique too. I'm really impressed by what Crested Duck Charcuterie offers. And putting an East End Brewery booth in here has to help everyone, since it's the only place in the area to get a growler fill. That's worth the price of admission alone.  My only other thought is that as long as all the booths aren't yet being used, they should put some tables and chairs in here to encourage people to come on an empty stomach. No stomach would leave empty, that's for sure."}
{"text":"Just skip it. Especially if you, like myself, have been spoiled by the beautiful markets from places like Indianapolis and Milwaukee, because I guarantee you will be disappointed. It was in a stark, boring, outdated building. I'm not saying ambiance is everything, but it would have helped the scant selection of eateries and shops. The food was ok (I had a taco, my boyfriend had pasta) and the beer was nothing to write home about. Save yourself the time and explore the other offerings of pittsburgh-like their museums."}
{"text":"I really just go here for some east end brewery beer; however, there is a pretty good sauce guy just across from the tap and some pretty good food down that lane.  I also have tried some cheeses here.  Pretty good coffee.  Unfortunately, i am priced out for any of the trendy, organic vegetables.    The bathroom is ok.  Good to know there is another place to pee rather than McDonald's while in the Strip."}
{"text":"I love the idea with a public market in Pittsburgh, but most other cities that have a public market have decades of experience, reputation, notoriety.  The ambiance of the new market circa 2011 when it was at Smallman Street was remarkable. The vendors were packed, the place pulsated with life, and it was difficult to make a path along the walkway a lot of the time. It's current location on Penn Avenue couldn't be more different. It's out of the way from the Strip's main drag and is often deserted, sadly. I've visited a few times on a Saturday, and half of the vendors don't even bother setting up. (As another Yelper described: Tumbleweeds.)  Supporting local business is important to me, but it seems like the location and the bleak ambiance isn't helping any of the vendors there. There's talk of a second public market move in the last two or three years -- I hope it's for the better."}
{"text":"My first visit to this new location was at the Burgh Bash, which by the way was amazing. With that experience in mind - we decided to stop by the following weekend.   Half of the vendors were same as the Burgh Bash event but the other half was non-existent. No complains against the individual vendors but this place as a whole definitely needs to do something about the rest of the vacant space. It's highly under utilized especially for a strip district where retail space is hard to come by.   This new location is definitely an upgrade from the old one but it still needs a lot of improvement when it comes to marketing and making this place more visible and perhaps a bit \"lively\". If it wasn't for the Burgh Bash event - I would probably never have stopped by again."}
{"text":"Love love love the new space!  I am looking forward to more vendors bring present and the very cool \"storefronts\" that really weren't able to be has before at the previous location."}
{"text":"This local market place might be small....but it surely packs a mean punch.   Home to several local businesses, the area definitely showcases some of Pittsburg's finest local beers,wines, veggies,sausages,bakery, olive oils, jams, pasta, jewelry....you name it & you might just find it here!   I always find myself buying a new item every single time I am here....though the one thing that keeps bringing me back....the artisan jams...I love the unique flavors which include jalapeño mango & habanero strawberry.   The market is all set to move to a new location not far from its current one this summer & I am looking forward to seeing some more new businesses at this joint.  My impression: Visit once & you will find yourself coming back again to experience some more of the Pittsburgh magic!"}
{"text":"Great new location.  My favorite vendors include East End Brewing Company, The Soup Nancys, La Palapa Mexican food and Clarion River Organics.  These vendors match their amazing products with great personalities."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the Pittsburgh Public Market, but I was expecting more.  There was a great variety of vendors - food, accessories, alcohol, flowers - I just expected that the area of the market would be larger seeing the long warehouse it was a part of.  I hope there are plans to expand in the future.  They have live music on the weekends.  This can be a good or bad thing.  The time that I was there a community ensemble was performing.  I am a bit of a music snob being a performer myself, and I give people credit for trying, but listening to this group was somewhat painful.  I was talking to one of the vendors who said I should have been there the day before when they had an amazing jazz ensemble.  Oh well.  It is a nice touch to add to the local flair of the market.  I went in looking for something to bring to a house party I was attending later that day and left with several bottles of wine, a growler of beer, a package of pierogis and flavored goat cheese.  For the party, I bought fresh made chips and salsa.    Highlights were me were East End Brewing Company, Glades Pike Winery and Mrs. Jones Sauce.  Even though it is small, there are a lot of great vendors for the space.  I hope that it takes off and more vendors are added."}
{"text":"Great REAL food and people and LOCAL items. FOODIES Celebrate! East End Brewery Rules! Red Star Kombucha is my business so I can't comment, haha. But seriously check out all the great food and art and drinks some time.  A real hidden Pittsburgh gem."}
{"text":"For those of you who were in love with Ohio City Pasta, they moved to Allegheny Center near the Children's Museum. It's kind of hard to find but it's in the southern building on the other end of the hall of Bank of America, near the escalator going down. They rebranded themselves as City Fresh Pasta (http://cityfreshpastapgh.com/) and are more of a small take-out place now. I miss the real dishes and the artsy hipster-ness of the original Ohio City Pasta but they had a few similar dishes we tried for old times sake. RIP Ohio City Pasta in the Public Market!"}
{"text":"There are little to no vendors here! Based on the reviews, I came with high expectations and was quite disappointed with the outcome. I don't want to be critical but honestly there were only 5 vendors that were selling anything of interest and rest was pretty much junk. If you compare it to public markets in other cities, you would think this is pretty crappy as well. The only meat vendor was charging a arm and a leg for something I can get down the street (Parma) for half the price and a fresher looking product."}
{"text":"I finally visited the new Pittsburgh Public Market space for the first time in September. I had been to the old, more \"rustic\" (haha) location several times when we first moved here four or five years ago, but somehow had not visited this new, climate-controlled spot.  We came here on a weekday afternoon or evening with friends while they were visiting. The market was very quiet, but at such an \"off\" hour, I wouldn't have expected it to be hectic. Approximately twenty vendors were open, and we wandered around admiring what they had to sell. Two vendors that stood out to me were The Olive Tap and Jonathan Moran Woodworks. The woodwork shop had an impressive number of beautiful - even custom - wooden pieces. The Olive Tap is in a huge space, selling a wide variety of oil, vinegar, and foods.  I was surprised that this new space wasn't larger but still think it's a fantastic concept to bring a lot of local Pittsburgh vendors together in one accessible way. Plus, I love that I can shop the market in the cold winter months now, too. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I really love the Public Market. Although there are many things they could improve upon. They have some excellent vendors...East End Brewing, gourmet marshmallows, baklava, pierogies...what more can you ask for? Plus great local crafts and handmade gifts. The vendors are a hoot too...super friendly and fun to talk with.  Needs improvement: signage. You should be able to see this place from a mile away. Their signs are a bit too subtle, which is why so many people still don't know about this place or simply can't find it. Pump up the volume! Also, attendance. We went on a day there was a Steelers game at 1, so the Strip was relatively slow in general. We were disappointed to find that probably 1/3 to 1/2 the vendors weren't even there! I think the vendors who contract space here really should be required to be on site whenever the market is open barring an emergency."}
{"text":"After all my visits to The Strip I can't believe I hadn't known about this place! My friend took me here and I have to repay my thanks!   This place is a mini market place filled with local produce, food, and products. The stands are filled with little goodies but be prepared to shell out a little more than you're used to.  Of course you're paying for the quality and supporting our local businesses so it's to a good cause!   The area is pretty open, I just wish they had more vendors! I would love to see more of pittsburgh's local talent and businesses displayed here."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of the Pittsburgh Market, but I think it has a lot of room for improvement. It's a shame that it had to move b/c the new location is \"meh\" as far as aesthetics and arrangement go. I hope they are able to re-fashion the current location into more of a destination.   That being said it has some good options for shopping and is a great place to go to grab a local beer or some high end and locally made products. For me these are not \"everyday\" items, but a good spot to buy hostess gifts for when I'm traveling or to grab a growler.   There is an event space good for meetings and small parties in the back. I'd suggest looking into this if you want to support a local organization and find an affordable space to host your next event."}
{"text":"What a great idea.  I go here a lot of gifts for my wife as local artisans are here in abundance.  Also there is an apple guy who comes at certain times of year and they are great.  The farms that come often have some of the best meat I have ever tasted.  Also, the bakery lady is phenominal.  The one right by the door.  Delicious."}
{"text":"A real letdown, especially after looking at the photos on Yelp that shows a really 'happening' place.  We arrived shortly after 11am on a Saturday morning...which would seem like a prime time for a market.  This place was absolutely DEAD.  It appeared more like the 10mins before the market was closing that's how deserted it was.  Tumbleweeds.  Definitely a vast contrast from the Strip outside.    The Pitts Public Market is indoors and the vendors consist of a craft brewery place, a kombucha (slightly alcoholic!), a coupla ice cream/gelato places, a pasta place, a bakery, po boys, a woodwork place, a healthy smoothly stall, an olive oil/balsamic vinegar taste testing place, etc.  And despite the fact that there were soo many yummy food options, the atmosphere just didn't lend itself to buying/trying much."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to check out the Public Market.  Having moved here recently, wanted to see a successful indoor farmer's market so I could pass on the news to my former hometown of Nashua, NH which is wanting an indoors market year round.  Only, it wasn't what I expected.  I was dissapointed by the long warehouse on the outside.  Somehow, I thought it would be put to good use for the farmer's market on the inside.  Did I miss something?  Did I not see it all?  Cuz it seemed pithy and I felt gypped.  As in several examples of Farmer's Markets across the U,S, the term \"Farmer's Market\" conjures up fresh veggies and fruit at the very least.  But, what is usually the case, and true of this particular market is that there is little evidence of fresh produce and what was there didn't meet my criteria (i.e., a ripe tomato should be a ripe tomato, not just turning red for God's sake).  It is July.  Shouldn't I expect to see fruit and veggies?  Yes, I did enjoy the baklava I ate and yes, I did purchase some tabooli (spelled varous ways) for later consumption.  But all in all?  I'd skip the market next trip to the Strip and check out other Farmer's Markets.  P.S.  Someone messaged me to let me know the intent of the Public Market is not necessarily to be a Farmer's Market.  Fair enough but I have to say the connotation is there of a public market being a farmer's market, considering it's in a district that does have discount grocers and fruit and vegetables on display on the sidewalks."}
{"text":"What a great place. As first-time tourists, my wife and I wanted to explore the city. We saw this strip of road (called \"The Strip\", coincidentally) and decided we'd stop and see what's cooking inside this indoor \"Pittsburgh Public market\".   Walking in, it looks like your typical small public market but as you walk to each and every stand, you can't help but be impressed by the variety and quality of the local stuff sold here. Teas, ciders, fudge, cheesecake (pumpkin pie cheesecake is quite tasty), quality meats and charcuterie, and even a brewery in the corner. But our favorite had to be the flavored marshmallow stand! How original and why hasn't anyone thought of it before!  We heard this had just opened a few months back and I'd have to say: Good job Pittsburgh, it's a great place. Keep the spirit like it is, with such friendly and motivated local vendors. They truly deserve your business."}
{"text":"Pittsburgh Public Market has changed over the years but it seems to have found some permanent vendors in their new location. There is one store dedicated to olive oil. There is a full bar, a vegan bakery, a bakery with items cooked with alcohol, and store with carved wooden items. There is also a vendor who has fresh pasta and sauces in different flavors. You can get items to go or have them make you a meal to eat right there. There is also a dairy farm, a cheese vendor, and a grass fed beef vendor. There is a brewery, a place that has Mexican food and a place that sells Indian food. There is a pretty big area that is for cooking classes. Local art hangs on the walls. They still have some open spots for vendors."}
{"text":"It's a similar concept the the Chelsea Market in NYC. I liked the various artisan and food venders. PPM had a wood shop, florist, cured meats, exotic olive oils and vinegars, Lebanese food, beer from East End, clothing, baked goods, ceramics, novelty candles as well as a few other vendors. Overall, the goods were relatively expensive, but you are paying to support a local artisan.  It looks the building is still being renovated. so I wouldn't be surprised to see more vendors. I like where PPM is headed."}
{"text":"Please go and support the many independent food merchants here.  You will be happy."}
{"text":"I was surprised that the Public Market wasn't that busy on a Sunday morning. It's a shame that it can be overlooked by people visiting the Strip, though I do like that it's much calmer than the zoo that is Penn Ave on the Strip on the weekends.   Some of the vendors are establishments familiar to Pittsburghers, like East End Brewing (awesome!), Fudgie Wudgie, and La Prima Espresso. Other stands are less familiar or are relatively new businesses, but their wares are still worth a look. I especially enjoyed the Pittsburgh Marshmallow Factory's stand (see my separate review). You can also get plants, wine, pierogies, specialty dog treats, baklava, Cornish pasties, olive oil, pasta, and much more.  The place still feels new and there are gaps where there feels like there should be more vendors, but this place is really promising. There's also a little area where you can sit down and eat if you can't wait to dig into some of your yummy purchases."}
{"text":"If you haven't been here yet, you need to come down and see what's going on. If you haven't been here in a while, the same goes for you. Many new vendors, and all sorts of fun and interesting things to do at the Pittsburgh Public Market, and where else can you get a free healthy lunch ( you must register for this, happens on Fridays!)"}
{"text":"Composite review.  Most recent visit was this last Saturday.  The concept is excellent; shops are interesting; enterprises that are represented are fun.  The olive oil business was friendly and inviting though we could only walk through quickly.  They offer tastings of their products which is unique to my experience.  East End Brewing has a stall there as well -- they are always helpful and fun.  Clothing product available.  While no foul on the part of the businesses that rent space there, the outside is so oddly plain and uninviting as to make one question what the intent of the operation is.... one can easily drive by this \"market\" with nary a glance.  Outside advertising is minimal, not even a wavy banner to catch one's eye.  Rather than a place that draws people off the street, they have create a \"go to\" destination in the heart of the city's cultural market  area.  No fresh produce, breads(though a cake place) .... an eclectic assortment of small businesses (all of which are interesting in their own right and deserve separate reviews).  There isn't even an outside sign listing what is inside!!    This place has a lot of potential.  Indeed it even has \"windows\" that roll up to the outside making it perfect for a live music scene to draw people in.  But, oddly, the marketing acumen lacks;  this surely hurts the business potential of whomever has their small shops inside.    The other reviews discuss some of the small shops -- some unique in the strip district.  f8 and be there."}
{"text":"This was a nice space with a bunch of different vendors. Some vendors were really good (see: the people selling all sorts of herbs and spices, the meat vendors, some of the bakeries) and some were a little odd (see: purses, clothing...non food stuff). I guess all goes at a market though!  It was a neat area. Got a little crowded, but I think that's a good thing. A lot of the produce looked very fresh and smell great.  More of a place to go and see the area than buy a week's worth of groceries, though."}
{"text":"I love the Pittsburgh Public Market!  Its a nice building they have many different vendors in there. Some that I like is the Olive Tap room, love all the different flavor olive oils and you can taste anything first to see if you like it.  I love Cafe D'More they make the best cafe mochas! We met some local farmers, like Freedom Farms in Butler I never heard of them before they have a market , bakery , sandwich shop. I'll have to go check there place out.  They have there own TV show called King Farms!"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of the public market.  Everything is local, fresh, and you get to talk to the people that make everything.  If you're a vegan or even if you're not I recommend stopping by the food stand for Vegan ABC.  If you're a little scared they do offer free samples upon request.  The buffalo chicken was perfectly spicy and the pulled pork sandwich left me in disbelief that there was no meat in there.    You'll also find ethnic foods, hot soups, delicious coffee, and locally brewed beer.  I also bought a plant for my office here which seems to be doing quite well.  This is a great place to visit and support the local Pittsburgh economy.  I highly recommend it either for food, shopping, or just to check it out."}
{"text":"This was my 2nd visit to the market so that my daughter who is home from spring break could see it. The market is small but parking can be a pain. There is a garage a block away by Marty's Market for a reasonable fee.  We visited a few vendors one of which was Alpaca clothing. I got a nice scarf there and purchased a nice pair of finger less gloves for her. She was impressed with the different artists who were there since she is a college art major.  We then decided to browse the market for food. There weren't a whole lot but we were happy to see some new ones-there was one that served Indian foods. My daughter decided to settle on some quadrilles from La Palapa, while I settled for a waffle with blueberry compote from Second Breakfast.  Everyone was courteous and friendly with us. There is free Wi Fi here and plenty of places to sit and eat.  For dessert I settled for a cupcake from Eliza's oven. Please note that if you check in there you save 50% off a cupcake. I had a lemon one with filling-small but just enough! I purchased some her home baked cookies for my son. I asked about purchasing her signature pretzels and scones to take home but since they are made with natural ingredients they won't keep very long.  We then capped off our meal with a dish of ice cream. My daughter noted that she wished there would be more vendors. We saw one outside as we were leaving so I am hoping with the change of season they may have more.   We saw also an choose your own olive oil store as well as a wine and Red Star Kombucha if you would like a drink with a twist to it.  I like coming during the week since it is not crowded and gives us an opportunity to explore the neighboring businesses in this area.  This is worth paying a visit to again."}
{"text":"I like this place, but I really wanted it to be so much more. I was hoping it'd be similar to the Reading Terminal Market in Philadelphia, but the space is so small, there isn't room for much unless it's allowed to expand into the warehouse.   I want to be able to come here for fresh produce from the area - not just the heirloom tomatoes and wild mushrooms. Granted, I love the artisan meats and cheeses, and heirloom veggies, but does this place really need to be so upscale? It's not a place I can shop weekly because I don't always need homemade marshmallows - even if they are amazing!  I find myself coming here more for gift items than for mysel. I just hope this catches on and expands to be more of a full-service type market."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place!   Since the move parking has been hard to come by, but there are so many great vendors! Was here this past weekend and had a lot great stuff! As always the brewing company has some delicious beers! You know what goes really well with those beers? Pasta from the Ohio City Pasta station. We had spinach gnocchi with herb butter, leeks, bacon, and goat cheese. 4 minutes to an amazing pasta dish? I'll take it and now I can't wait to go back and buy more gnocchi.   I can't wait to spend even more time here!"}
{"text":"I've been hearing for a while what an amazing thing this is for the city, but I didn't fully realize WHY until I stepped into the market.  It may be small at this point, but it's packed with incredible vendors already!  I NEEDED to head straight to the Pittsburgh Marshmallow Factory booth because I heard so many good things already.  I was practically running there....thank god no one was hurt!  I had to scoop up the S'Mores marshmallow and purchased a couple more different flavors to try.  I tried the S'Mores and it was fantastic, the marshmallow was nice and fluffy with chocolate and a cookie underneath.  I have no worries the rest will be just as delish!  I also knew I had to stop at the Tupelo Honey Teas.  I'm obsessed with tea's, especially Chai teas.  I bought the Coconut Chai, the perfect combination since I've also been obsessed with coconut recently.  There's a lot of other teas I spied that I'd like to come back and buy!  Another time...for sure!  I saw a ton of stands I'd like to check out like the East End Brewing Company, Baklava Company, Mushroom for Life and Kahila's Island Taste.  Honestly, if I hadn't stuffed myself with Pamela's Tex Mex omelet beforehand, I could have eaten my way through this place.  I love eating my way through places, so this will most definitely happen soon!  For a small market, there's a lot of businesses packed in.  I was a little rushed, so I need to have a little more time to devote to looking around, but I will MOST DEFINITELY be back.  I know they're working on growing things there so right now it has to be small.  But they have a lot of room to expand.  I also know they're only open 3 days on the weekend right now, but I'm sure that will change with growth and business.  Keep it going strong by visiting, you won't be disappointed!  Hours:  Friday 10am-6pm Saturday 9am-5pm Sunday 10am-4pm"}
{"text":"I was happy to have found the PPM on a recent weekend trip to the city/day-long stroll through the Strip District!  Firstly, I love the idea of a permanent space dedicated to incubating new food makers and vendors. What a great asset in growing the city's food culture!  Next, we found some absolute gems on our walk through the market floor. Steve's Deli, Red Star Kombucha, and Gluten Free Goat were easy stand-outs! We also enjoyed seeing our hometown Ohio City Pasta represented in the mix!  I would call the PPM a must-visit and a must-eat for any food-lover in PGH!"}
{"text":"This is definitely a must-go attraction in Pittsburgh! It works for the business person who just needs to grab a bite for lunch, the foodie who loves to try new and exotic, reasonably priced goodies, the organic food lover, or the awesome people on vacation here! There's so much to offer in this new location, as well. Places to sit and enjoy, counters to socialize and sip the local brews, wares and trinkets from local designers and artisans and even a place to get a variety of olive and seed oils! The layout works.  Super fun place."}
{"text":"I now get my milk , cream and pork sausage from here. Very good fresh cold milk. In a glass container, the way it should be."}
