{"text":"This is our favorite place to get lunch! I always end up getting their grilled chicken or the chicken &a dumplings. My kids love their Mac n cheese. Also the desserts are fabulous! The strawberry and caramel cakes are our favorites!"}
{"text":"After seeing their sign \"Best Flounder in Town\" my friend and I decided to give it a try.  BIG Mistake...I ordered the Seafood Platter (Shrimp, Oysters, Flounder). The seafood tasted like it had been sitting out for hours and then re-fried in old grease.  The flounder, supposedly the best in town was eatable but overcooked and the oysters and shrimp were so horrible I almost gagged after eating one oyster. To top it off, our waitress never appeared after the food was delivered...What a disappointment!!  I am from the NC Coast and am accustomed to excellent seafood and really did not expect their food to equal the quality of the coasts BUT when you advertise to have the best flounder in town, you should be expected to deliver a decent meal...."}
{"text":"Seafood very good.  Flounder best I have had other than at the coast.  Service is fast and excellent.  Friendly staff and good food.  Highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Our family went for a late lunch. The fish, shrimp and chicken were all excellent. The fries and hushpuppies were great as well, and the homemade pineapple cake was simply incredible. Check their hours before you go because they vary daily."}
{"text":"Came here to take my grandmother out for her birthday. We were both pleased! We arrived 5 minutes before scheduled opening time, and they were already open! We ordered, got our drinks and the food came shortly after. You get a great quantity of food for the price you pay, and it is delicious! We will be back.  While we were eating their truck came in, I must say it was great to see what amazing teamwork all of the girls I saw working had. Everyone was working together on whatever task was at hand."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to stop in for a long time, and finally did so today.  At 3:30 on Thursday, there was no crowd. First off, their health grade is an awesome 98.5, the dining area and bathroom were both clean as a whistle, their prices are quite reasonable, and the employees that I came in contact with were excellent!  The unsweetened tea was ok, though it had a bit of a different flavor. I ordered a small flounder plate that comes with french fries, hushpuppies & slaw. I opted for onion rings instead of fries. Here's the excellent part: EVERYTHING!!!  Flounder was wonderful and fried to perfection; onion rings had great flavor, and hushpuppies were good. Their slaw was the big surprise. I am very picky about slaw and 90% of the time, I leave slaw untouched when dining out. Not this time, it was so dang good, I ate it all first!  The tarter and cocktail sauces were very good, as was a slice of their devils food cake. WHY, OH WHY DID I WAIT SO LONG TO COME TO THIS AWESOME RESTAURANT????"}
{"text":"Great Banana Cream Pie. It was just before closing and they had one piece left and it was like they just made it. Can't wait to try more."}
{"text":"We got takeout from here.  I had the calabash shrimp, very small but delicious and breaded freshly.   The slaw and hush puppies were both just OK, neither had much flavor.  The baked potato was good and they absolutely loaded he to go boxes with all condiments.  We had chocolate pie and it was awesome! Crust was fresh flaky and tasty, and the chocolate portion pleasantly surprised me that is was so good, definitely not your standard pudding mix.  I want to try the other pies available.  Will def go back"}
{"text":"The staff here was very nice...and that was the best thing here. The food was so terrible my bf got country fried steak that was covered with a super thick gravy the meat tasted of mystery meat and reminded me of the Salisbury steak served in school. I got chicken fingers which were ok....the sides needed seasoning very badly. Since it was our first visit they gave us free dessert I got the egg cream pie and he got carrot cake. The carrot cake was so dense you could have used it as a weapon with a super thick cream cheese frosting that could double as caulking. The egg cream pie was a travesty, they did not mix it well so my first few bites were ok then I got a bite that tasted of old boiled eggs. It took all of my strength to get home before throwing up, my bf decided to sleep to keep his food down as he didn't want to waste hard earned money. I will open up a decade old can of chef boyarde before eating here again...just thinking about the food here turns my tummy."}
{"text":"I ordered a to-go plate. The cashier seemed extremely unenthused and not so welcoming (could just have been having a bad day). The seafood platter was just Ok, but not great. Not much food for what you pay."}
{"text":"Perfect grilled shrimp and fried founder ...very fast with great service and of course some delicious chocolate cake!!"}
{"text":"I haven't had any of their food yet, but I can't wait to! I am obsessed with their pineapple cake. The cakes are 3 layers. The pineapple cake is a yellow cake with fluffy whipped frosting with crushed pineapple mixed in. I like it best when it's been out of the fridge for 5-10 mins so the cake isn't super cold, but the frosting is still cold.  My fianc√© demolished the \"Queen Ann\" cake without offering me a bite. It was a chocolate cake with whipped vanilla frosting with bits of Oreos (I think) and shaved Hershey's chocolate. I tasted a bit of what was left of the frosting & it was really good  Also had a whoopee pie. Didn't love that. The cookies(?) were on the dense side and kind of hard... The frosting was too sweet and way too thick for my taste. I wish it would've been a little lighter.  Overall we enjoyed out desserts. Hopefully we'll actually eat a meal there soon."}
{"text":"This place came highly recommend because I love a good flounder dinner the fish was tasty but the portion was super small two very small thin pieces of flounder very Bland collard greens and a side salad for $9.95 barely worth it why make collard greens and Not season them! again the fish was fine but it was too tiny pieces I would have rather had only one side and a couple more pieces or larger pieces of fish.  I hear they're famous for their desserts everyone says their cakes are great but for me the fish dinner wasn't worth it"}
