{"text":"Friendly and helpful staff. Great lunch prices. I highly recommend visiting Lotus Chinese Cuisine"}
{"text":"I've had food from this place many times but to pass off a dish using the wrong type of noodles is never a good thing. It would be nice to get what I've paid for. I know it's still fast food but come on!"}
{"text":"Recent visit confirms smaller portions... still food is consistent. Will not honor coupons"}
{"text":"This place has been around for years and I have to admit that the quality of the food has remained very consistent.  It's a small place in a little strip mall, they have about 6 maybe 7 tables.  Most people come here for take out.  The food is very reasonably priced and you get a ton of it.  I've never been able to finish a portion in less than 2 days.  My favorite is the 6 fried chicken wings (all drumettes), if I remember correctly this cost about $3.75.

They offer all of your typical American Chinese fare, which we all know is chicken cooked 275 ways and then beef and pork cooked those same 275 ways :)  If you're looking for a more healthy option, try one of the steamed veggie/fish dishes and substitute the fried rice for steamed rice."}
{"text":"Do not eat here.  It is awful!  The food tastes old, re-heated.  Really bad.  You couldn't pay me to eat here again."}
{"text":"Great food at affordable prices. What you expext from a strip mall chinese resturant."}
{"text":"I called in to this restaurant for a delivery after several employees at my job placed an order together less than 10 minutes prior. I quickly explained this before I placed my order in the hopes of adding it to the pre-existing order from my job. I was told that the order had already gone out and that I had to place a new order so I did. I was reminded that the order had to be $12 or more for delivery and did my best to get to it but when my order came up to $11.91 the woman on the line with a nasty attitude told me that I needed to order something else. I canceled my order and found someplace else to eat. By the way to food that my co-workers ordered did not come in until over a half an hour later. They will never get my business again."}
{"text":"Ew.  Sanitation grade B at an 85 even with the serve safe bonus points.  That's gross guys.  PM me when you can pull a 92+ and I'll come back."}
{"text":"Food wise Lotus is a decent Chinese place. And since Chinese places pretty much come in 2 varieties (decent and really not decent) that's good enough. What bumps them above par are two things: they deliver, which is novel for me, and you get SOOO much food. Like 2-3 meals worth of food per $8 combination. Can you say value? Yes you can.

I also liked that even though there technically isn't a beef w/garlic sauce combination (beef w/ other stuff- yes, other meat w/garlic sauce- yes, beef w/ garlic sauce- not so much) they let me order it. And it was tasty...for 3 meals."}
{"text":"Good asian food, fast service. Best Beef Terriyaki on a stick. Pork egg roll really good also."}
{"text":"My favorite Chinese food is General Tso's and so I use that as my measuring stick for Chinese restaurants. General's is called something else at Lotus, but is noted in parentheses. Lotus has HUGE, and i mean huge, servings. I was able to eat 4 meals out of 1 order (of course there were crab rangoons too). The rangoons were light and not as crispy as I would have liked. They also were a bit sweeter than other rangoons I have had. The General's was also not as crispy as I would have liked. While eating there were numerous call-in orders placed for General's and all were \"extra crispy,\" so keep that in mind when placing your order. The food looked amazing when first opened: there were 6-7 red pepper pods and I was super excited that it would be extra spicy, but it wasn't. The rice is very colorful and has many veggies including peas and onions, but overall the flavor is somewhat bland. 

Overall: you cannot beat the price/serving size, but it's not the best General Tso's I've ever had. I'd be willing to go back and get extra crispy/extra spicy and see how that goes."}
{"text":"In terms of quantity and price this place is a 3, but in terms of quality and taste this place is a 2.

Warning to vegetarians: the spring rolls have shrimp in them.  Warning to everyone else: the spring rolls are bland bland bland.

We usually get the sesame chicken - Chinese equivalent of fried chicken with sweet sauce.  The chicken is sometimes stringy but there is always plenty of it to eat for a second meal.

I get the dumplings here but these are worse than dumplings at most other Chinese food places - still worth getting but if you are big on dumplings then go somewhere else.

I really like lomain and I don't bother to get it here anymore - I really don't like the flavor of the pork or the beef lomain.  It tastes like they over oiled and overcooked the noodles.

Tips and tricks: you can mention the $4 discount on $15 or more of food or simply show the website with the coupon when you checkout to get the discount.  They will sometimes do this on delivery for the $3 coupon.

I go here a lot, and I bet you wonder why I go so often to a place I rated a 2, because on value it is a 3, and I live so close to this place.  Jade Garden won't deliver to me so this is really out of convenience.  I have started going here far less often because the food really isn't that good.  I like eating the food but I never crave any particular flavor from this place.  I hope this helps you when you decide what you want to eat."}
{"text":"Disgusting really there is no other words for dinner ordered from the Lotus Chinese cuisine restaurant down the street"}
{"text":"Messed up my order tonight 2x. First time it was acceptable, but 2nd time it becomes unacceptable! When I got home no sweet and sour sauce for my chicken! I called and was put on hold for almost 6 minutes I just drove to the place. When I got there the manager apologized but didn't even compensate me with anything. Last time I'll be visiting that place. Poor customer service!!"}
{"text":"Meh.

I was super hungry and my fellow colleague suggested Chinese. I figured, okay, she would know if it is good or not.

Food - I ordered the lunch special shrimp fried rice. I was not blown away by the fried rice.  It was soo much, good deal, good price around $6.  There was so much rice and not enough shrimp.  But you get what you paid for.

Delivery Service - Good, they came at a reasonable amount of time.

Phone Service - Good, they were able to take my friend's order correctly and we got our food the way we ordered them. Good to know they did not mess up on our order.

My friend's Shrimp Lo Mein was not all that great (lunch special).  My other friend's chicken wings - she loved. I believe I had them here before, last year, and they were good."}
{"text":"It could be the worlds best Chinese, but customer service and delivery method are putrid. I placed an order an order and asked for delivery. Order of five meals for friends and myself for dinner, so it is a very profitably delivery. I call an hour and fifteen minutes after the order and they forget my order and say it will be another twenty to thirty minutes. 


I will never call back and will not be advising any of my friends or coworkers to go there either."}
{"text":"The best Chinese food on the north side of town!  They deliver here and it's a smooth transaction.  My personal favorites are lomein, egg foo young, and fried rice.  I've been here many time and plan to return!"}
{"text":"The people that work here are extremely nice and helpful but this is hands down the worst Chinese food I have ever tried. I am a big fan of cheap Chinese food, it reminds me of college.
Lo mein was so overly cooked it was almost crispy... how do u mess up lo mein? Idk I was very disappointed. I should have paid attention to the other reviews. They have good combo prices for lunch but I will not be returning."}
{"text":"This place is 3.5 stars for lunch and 2.5 stars for dinner.  During lunch the prices are impossible to beat and I get all I can eat.  Wifey can't even finish her lunch portion.  The free egg roll is nothing but greasy and bitter/bland.

This place has insane coupons but you can't use them with the lunch deals because they are already so cheap.

Nice and cheap.  Don't expect subtle flavors and a pleasant bouquet.  It is essentially Chinese KFC.  That means greasy, bready, and fried.

This is a place to get you chow on."}
{"text":"Favorite place for takeout. Their lo mein is great, and the reason I come here 1-2 times per week."}
{"text":"Inside this is your average run in, grab your grub & go kinda place; nothing fancy AT ALL.  But you come here for the food, NOT the ambiance.  What you get @ Lotus is good Chinese food quick.  And LARGE amounts of it, especially at dinner.  We at here for dinner tonight and we both had trouble finishing our meals (but I did because I was a pig...there, I said it!).  I ordered my Sa Cha Chicken with double fried rice no egg roll (cooked cabbage is just gross to me), and my God...I had enough rice for 3-4 people - and that's not an exaggeration!!  I was completely shocked at the amount of chicken and veggies that I was given - it could have easily been considered a \"buffet portion\" by other establishments.  Next time I know to have them alter the spice level though; I was about to spit fire!!!  But talk about TASTY.  It's been several years since I've eaten here & I forgot how good they were.  Used to eat here quite often when I worked @ IBM in the mid-late 90's (so you know they're good if they've been around that long).  And the best part is they're open somewhat late (till 10:00 Sun-Thur & 10:30 Fri & Sat), so you can quench that Chinese craving into the *somewhat* wee hours of the evening.  
Pricing is also very reasonable.  For this mound of food, it was only $7.75 (on their dinner combo menu, +tax of course).  Naturally, they do have things priced slightly higher, but nothings over $10.75. And considering their portion sizes, that's a good value. 
There are a few places to sit inside, but 95% (or maybe even more) of their business is take out.  And if you go in the evening (say, after 9:00 or so), be prepared for the stench of bleach as that's when they start cleaning - that scent slapped us in the face when we walked in this evening...WOW...appetizing!!
Overall, I'd say Lotus is the best value in Chinese take-out in the Davis Lake area.  Give'em a try if you haven't already...and have your Tupperware ready if you don't have a big stomach!! hehe :)"}
