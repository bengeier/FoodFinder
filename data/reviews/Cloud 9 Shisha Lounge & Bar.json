{"text":"fucking savages switched the song while some people were singing. nuff said. not even like they had a song on queue... just let these poor folk sing into the silence.. savages."}
{"text":"If you like shisha this is the place to be! Comfortable seating, great service and food.  Definitely a place ill be coming back to."}
{"text":"Great spot for sheesha but the music can get annoying if you aren't into modern day gangster rap. Other than that the staff is friendly, price is decent and quality is good."}
{"text":"We were just in Calgary a while back and we checked this place out because of the high ratings. We arrived at 4pm (when it usually opens) and a nice clubbing atmosphere but the floors were a no no, there was dust and just random things everywhere and they also have VIP rooms that have a TV, and aux which was pretty cool, but again not very clean. The shisha was amazing, way better than any hookah bar in edmonton. The smoke was thick and the pipe was a bit new for me, but damn , even the flavour was very rich. I would recommend this place to whoever is new to Calgary!"}
{"text":"Amazing service and hospitality from the staff. Great lighting and atmosphere.  Private rooms for parties. Smooth khalil mamoon hookahs and amazing food!"}
{"text":"This hookah bar has a club setting with pretty heavy r&b music. Don't come here before 8pm though because you'll be the only one.  The food they serve is great drunk food, but nothing past that. For me the quick start coals they use can really leave the hookah with a bad taste initially,  but then better later on. Hookah Seems a bit cheaper here than other places I've been though. $16-18."}
{"text":"Started coming here as its closer to work than the others. The shisha is good, the food is excellent and the service is fantastic. I came here to try it out and have become a regular in a short time. Very good specials, such as $10 shisha on Tuesdays and free wings with shisha and drink on Wednesdays. I recommend this place to all my friends."}
