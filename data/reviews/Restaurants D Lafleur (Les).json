{"text":"Fastest service I've ever experienced. These guys pump out hot dogs and poutines like it's nothing, order and 20'seconds later it's ready, unbelievable. Can't wait to see the new facilities"}
{"text":"Vraiment une bonne adresse de restauration rapide. La qualité est en moyenne supérieure à ce qu'on retrouve ailleurs."}
{"text":"Messy,greasy, high calories just the way i like it. Best steamies with a coke. Good burgers too. Always fresh prepared first hand on site."}
{"text":"The steamie: standard lafleur wiener. I prefer the oldschool way of all-dressing a hot down with tons of chopped cabbage. This one is more aesthetically pleasing but not as satisfying.

The poutine: gravy a bit on the salty side, lacks flavour. Fries taste like fresh oil. Reminds me of McDonald's poutine in the sense that it's basic but not classic.

Open 24hr, fast and effficient, right off the highway. The prices are fair, they take debit/credit no minimum, and the employees wash their hands before making your hot dog (thank you!). There are even mobile coupons on their website."}
{"text":"A guilty pleasure - the hotdogs are simple and quick to eat, an all dressed steamed hotdog is always a treat. The fries have changed from the past in that they have a different texture because of different oil (trans fat free) but are still good, especially with salt and vinegar. The thing I miss is the \"grapette\" drink from when I was a teenager. Now it's just soft drinks. 
Probably shouldn't eat this food that often for health reasons but it's still tasty..."}
{"text":"The smoked meat sandwich looked good on the poster. Unfortunately they were all out. The poutine was yummy. Full of cheese curds. :)"}
{"text":"Okay, so it's fast food. But it's fast food in a kinda old-timey way that reminds me of when I was a kid. There is nothing plastic or fake in this place.

Nice burgers and dogs. And I had the poutine, which was really quite good. Now I finally understand what the canadians see in this dish. If I lived in Montreal, I could see me eating a lot more of this stuff. And I'd weigh a lot more too."}
{"text":"The most standard friterie food, but not in the good way. A proper Friterie (small time or mom'n'pop) has more flavor, texture and heart than this place. This is all food that's prepared elsewhere and put together here. Think about it. They don't bake their own buns, they don't string together their own sausage, the fries are simply blanched then dropped in oil, the curds come prepared, the gravy isn't made from scratch. Literally every ingredient here is just heated and served, nothing \"created\". The small town places will often at least cut their own potatoes and have curd cheese from local farms rather than whatever bucket was processed through Lafleur's distribution center. They get an extra star simply because they're 24 hours and I've drunkenly stumbled in and it's always been clean, but overall its over priced and really nothing special."}
{"text":"Visited this location last week for the first time since around 1979 and it's almost exactly the same!  The quality of the food and value is still excellent.  I can honestly say Lafluers is one of the few places that is just as good today now as it was in the 70's, and that's quite an accomplishment.  If you're looking for the best fries in the world, amazing hot dogs & burgers and now veggie dogs & burgers (thanks Lafleurs!), then you've found it.  I've never tried the poutine, but my friends tell me it's amazing!  If you're a moise Anglais, like me, get used to them refusing to speak English to you.  Meh, it's been this way for 30 years, why should I expect them to change now...guess it's part of their charm.  LOL"}
{"text":"If you like steamed hot dogs and great greasy fries this is the place to go. Quality is consistent from visit to visit.  If you're new to Quebec try the \"poutine\". It's french fries with gravy and cheese."}
