{"text":"I went here during the week for lunch and ordered the Philly Cheese steak.  I wasn't too impressed.  I've had the real thing in Philadelphia - both versions - with provolone or cheese sauce - and this did not compare.  The meat looked almost boiled, lacked flavor (salt/pepper anyone?) and the buns were slightly stale.  

Perhaps its b/c I went during the week and not late at night after an evening of debauchery.  Perhaps they have their \"good\" cooks working only on the weekends.  Perhaps they just opened and the grill wasn't heated to the right temperature. Who knows.

In any case, the food wasn't intriguing enough for me to give it another chance."}
{"text":"The only reason anyone ends up here is because they are too drunk, and can't find the \"Hot Pockets\" panino store that used to be in the area.  

That being said, the place is filthy, old, with horrible decor.  But you don't go there for the ambiance, so thats all you need to know about the space.

The first time I was there, I was extremely drunk and ordered the Philly cheese steak.  I wont lie, pretty good, I prefer a toasted bun, but still decent. Does not compare to an authentic cheese steak, you actually have to travel to Philly to get that. 

Last night, I tried the follow up visit.  This time not drunk, just hungry and craving a sandwich.  I ordered the Veal Sandwich with onions and hot peppers. It takes about 10 mins to get your sandwich so be prepared to wait.  

While waiting for our order, out of the corner of my eye, I noticed a small MOUSE running across the floor.  It hid in the corner by the window, and then ran midway towards us before running back to the corner.  

I probably should have said something.  (the manager was in the room at the time).  But my friends didn't see it, and my hunger outweighed the need to cause a fuss.  I understand most old buildings in Toronto have had a mouse or two, but it changes things when you actually see it.  

Overall \"Manhattan Sandwiches\" works for late night, post clubbing eats.  Despite the mouse I enjoyed the sandwich.  (guess I'm not picky)
I should have mentioned the mouse while I was there, but I'm doing it now.  
\"Dude clean up your store, or Im sure your store wont last long, doesn't matter how good the sandwich is.\""}
{"text":"We went through alot of trouble to get to this philly cheese steak from Manhattan Sandwiches at 1am. I'm not kidding when I say alot of TROUBLE! If you want deets, send me a PM. But let's just say there wasn't a dull moment in our adventure of satisfying our late night craving! And no we were not drunk and no we did not go clubbing!

I would have been pissed off if it wasn't worth it. There was no way I was going to live through a scene straight from an action movie and get a crappy sandwich. My friend would have gotten a beat down from me! But her taste in food doesn't lie - the Manhattan Cheese steak is the BEST PHILLY CHEESE STEAK I've ever had in Tdot. It's the closest to authentic I've eaten in the city. The cheese melted and intertwined in the steak pieces and onions and the bun was fresh... I'm actually saying mmmm as I think of the Manhattan cheese steak I recently consumed.

On the contrary to Dean L's review, I didn't find the place to be filthy with horrible decor. It was very simple, I didn't notice any decor. A couple of pictures on the wall, plain tables and chairs and wood laminate flooring, that's about it. Plus the place looked spotless. Maybe the owner ran into Dean L's review and decided to clean up? And good for them! Because it would be a damn shame if this place with the best philly cheese steak in Toronto was nasty dirty. Then my hunt for the best philly cheese steak would have to start all over again."}
{"text":"This small sandwich shop is very popular amongst the office workers in the area.  It's a great spot to grab a sandwich or an empanada (sort of like a beef patty, but Argentinean style) and the quality of the food never lets you down.  

The shop is run by an Argentinean family, which explains their South American sensibility when spicing and preparing the food.  My favourite thing to have here is the 'El Gaucho' Argentine Steak Sandwich.  It's so filled with flavor that you'd be doing yourself a disservice by not trying one out.

The staff is polite and cheery.  I've always found them in a good mood.  Orlando is especially chatty, and everyone there is very friendly.  I've never eaten in here, but they do have a sizable dining area and one of these days I'll be sure to try it out."}
