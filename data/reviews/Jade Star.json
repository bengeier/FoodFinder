{"text":"My wife and I visited this restaurant recently, and we will never return. The place was empty, and a short-haired girl was sitting at a table in front. She was the hostess, but didn't have the ambition to get off her chair and seat us. We seated ourselves....then waited probably 5 minutes for this girl to ask for our drink wants. We both ordered coffee, and I take cream. She brought the coffees with some cream for me in a separate container. I poured the cream and it came out in chunks! Entirely spoiled! Our food was good, but the ambience, along with the attitude of the people working there had already convinced us that we would never return. The place wasn't clean by any means either. Do yourself a favor: make the short drive to Good China on Union Hills Rd. near 83rd Ave. Clean, very friendly staff, and great food!"}
{"text":"The food is consistently good and fast for take out. The staff is friendly. Ive never had any issues with my orders. Eating in the service tends to be a little slower but I usually get take out and it's consistently 5-10 minutes. The vegetables are always fresh. The fried rice for take out is a little greasy but its very good."}
{"text":"Went there with my husband food was ok, ordered the shrimp with lobster gravy this place added green peppers to the meal,  Never had pepper in my shrimp n lobster gravy before and this ruined the taste. Will not return there again."}
{"text":"Well, this place gets the all-time award for the WORST \"Chinese\" food I've ever had and I've been eating it for over 35 years and nothing can be this off. Disgusting. On top of that, the person there waiting on tables should be banned from the place. I saw something today that I couldn't believe and have never seen in any restaurant, EVER. She answered the phone and somebody was asking about their food. She must have become tired of talking to her, because she said, \"Can you hold for a minute???\" and put the receiver down. Only to go and do other things in the restaurant....clear table, etc. Then, when she was all done, she walked over to the phone and got rid of the person on the line. She was clearly wanting the person to hang up.I've NEVER seen anybody in any restaurant do this. Absolutely no regard for the customers OR the food. When it came, it was so bad I left 90 per cent of it on the table and got out of there as fast as I could. I wouldn't give that food to a dog if it was starving. Again, I know this food. If you got a good meal there, you're lucky. Oh, did I forget the sick feeling on the way home? Yep. You know what I mean. Never again."}
{"text":"I can't understand why anyone who has eaten in this establishment would give this 4 stars out of 5. To put it simply, this has to be the worst Chinese restaurant in the West Valley. I order Seafood Soup; with the understanding that there would be shrimp, fresh vegetables, with broth that had flavor. Instead, there version of Seafood soup consisted of Egg Drop broth, small portion of processed shrimp, and something that looked like crab meat which was horribly seasoned.  My wife ordered Sweet Sour combination dinner which supposedly had pieces of chicken that really turned out to be totally made of bread. Gross Gross Gross!"}
{"text":"Horrible service, went for lunch and was ignored for about 20 minutes and ended up leaving. Tried to give the restaurant a second chance and went back a second time. The waitress was extremely rude. When I motioned to the waitress to come over she yelled across the restaurant what do I need to scome over there for ? I had originally ordered my meal to go because I didn't think I had time to eat there but ended up having time to eat and was told I wasn't allowed to do that ... if I'm a paying customer and the restaurant is not full why would you refuse to let me eat there? I will never eat there again ."}
{"text":"good food but poor service! waitor kept saying he was tired..it was very obvious. Also him and a woman with short hair stood there speaking their language and laughing. That was odd."}
{"text":"This place is horrible! Went there and was not attended or acknowledged.  When someone did come by it was 30 minutes later and he was so rude , he didn't even sit us down, instead he kept doing other things.  Don't come here at all! They have no customer service skills! I will take my business elsewhere."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped in for dinner tonite at 645 there were 4 people about ready to leave and another table of 2 we were seated and asked what we wanted to drink. Then our order was taken....the phone rang and the only person working the floor answered the phone and told the person he didn't have time to take an order. We got our food and my eggfoo young had noodles which my wife ordered and her chicken had my fried rice. We motioned to the waiter that the food was mixed snd just brought us 2 empty plates to switch the food ourself...nice touch. I then wanted hot mustard and went to the counter and the phone rand again and he told the person calling they were closed...this was a bit after 7 and the sign on the door has hours to 9 every nite. I then tried to cut my eggfoo young with my fork but it was too hard and dry. When the waiter came by I told him it was not eatable. He then gave me the check for 2 both meals. I went to the desk and asked for the manager and of course it was the same guy. I told him I was not paying for a meal I could not eat. He said give me $15 the bill was $21. I gave him the money and will never return. The Arizona food inspection dept should visit this place dirty and strange smell from kitchen...."}
{"text":"We went there for lunch yesterday and what a mistake!! I ordered Chicken Moo Goo Gai Pan and the veggies and chicken pieces were so huge I couldn't eat them. I had to ask for a knife and the bok choy was so tough even then I couldn't cut it. The sauce was so salty, I was drinking water all the rest of the day. When I made a comment about the size of the pieces, our server said next time we come in to tell them I wanted everything cut into smaller pieces. Really??? 1st I'll never eat there again and 2nd - no other restaurant asks you to tell them how you want the veggies cut.  We also ordered Cashew Chicken. Oh YUCK!!!  The sauce was so dark in color, it tasted burnt. Again the veggies were huge and tough and the sauce was extremely salty. We wondered why there was only 2 other tables filled at lunch time - now we know. Stay away. There are so many other good Chinese restaurants around that you don't have to waste your time on this one."}
{"text":"Moved to Sun City about 6 months ago have tried Jade Star several times. Absolutely love everything on their menu. The shrimp are big and tender, the chicken dinners are all superb, my wife love their beef and snow peas. It's so convenient to order on line and delivery is fast and very friendly. This is my go to whenever I want Chinese."}
{"text":"Wife and I came here for dinner, had egg rolls, pork fried rice, & shrimp w/lobster gravy, they put green peppers in the shrimp w/lobster gravy that ruined the taste of the food, we won't go back there again. Menu options also not to my liking."}
{"text":"Disappointed and so wanted a good Chinese meal in Sun City.  Ordered for takeout and it was ready and hot!  However, the combo meals were a disappointment. Each comes with entr√©e, soup, lo mein, fried rice & a crab puff.   Fried wontons (with cream cheese) were substituted with no notice for the crab puffs. Egg drop soup was ok.  Lo Mein was tasty but a bit sticky like maybe not fresh.  Fried rice was more like brown colored white rice - absolutely no flavor nor vegies. We love fried rice but this was not as expected.  Entrees: shrimp with lobster sauce - shrimp was very good, large and tender.  General Tso's chicken:  rubbery chicken cuts so we couldn't eat it.  Orange chicken: very good!  Why would the chicken pieces be tender in Orange Chicken but not tender in General Tso's chicken?  This restaurant was empty at 5pm and it's hard to imagine how they stay afloat in Sun City without specials for the seniors (like 2 for 1, etc)  Maybe would have given 4 stars if not for the fried rice and General Tso's failures."}
{"text":"Have never eaten in the restaurant. Always have ordered take out or delivery. That being said, love the food here! Always spot on for this picky Chicago couple. Great portions, friendly delivery driver. A couple of our favorite menu items are the chicken fried rice, Mongolian beef and don't get me started on the pot stickers, num! Jade Star has become one of our families staples."}
{"text":"Fried Rice special: (shrimp, chicken, pork), it was very good, the pork was a bit overdone but if tasted fresh and it was seasoned well.  Orange Chicken: Excellent, it comes in a large dinner portion for 2 with white rice. It was yummy, the chicken was tender and flavorful with a sweet and slightly mild hot orange sauce. the breading was light and fried perfectly. The taste of the breading was mild and slightly sweet.  As the terminator said, I will be back."}
{"text":"I've eaten at a lot of Chinese restaurants and many of them don't make their soups and dishes fresh when ordered, but every order we've gotten here has fresh ingredients with each retaining its distinct taste. Their War Wanton soup is the best I've ever had and so is their fried rice. Since most all shrimp sre farm raised these days they have no taste at all, no matter where you get them. But the shrimp in the fried rice and other dishes here are not only very tasty but cooked just perfectly. I'll admit, the atmosphere leaves something to be desired but I'm rating the food."}
{"text":"I remember what Army chow tasted like when you're out there on maneuvers...I'd rather eat that crap then the Jades Chinese slop.  And to boot the service sucked too. Pass on this place."}
{"text":"This place has horrible customer service the waitress was rude! Will not be coming back to this establishment. Food was at best a 5/10."}
{"text":"First time visit last night - my wife was a bit skeptical since we arrived a half hour before closing and we were the only ones there. But that's Sun City on a weekday night. Wife is gluten free but Jean our waitress helped her. Food was great!! And the portions were more than adequate. We'll be back ... a lot."}
{"text":"Was in there with my partner took almost an hour just to get food service was very slow as if she didn't want to b there and it was at lunch time but the place was empty"}
{"text":"What's not to love about Jade Star? HUGE portions, great service, unbelievable prices and yes - YUUUUUUUUMMY food!  Brought a large group here over the weekend and we all ordered combo dinners for around $9.00. Food was excellent and the leftovers even better. Some recommendations: General Tso chicken, chicken fried rice, spicy pork, chicken & mushrooms, Kung Pao chicken and egg drop soup."}
{"text":"Was not the best but i was hungry and it was filling but if i had to choose between here and traveling further i think i could waste the gas..."}
{"text":"The food is very good here.  We have eaten here twice, and both times we were very happy with what we ordered.  No complaints, good value.   A quick suggestion to management: Please do not vacuum the carpet right beside us while we are still eating, and don't mop the floor 10 feet from our table so that we have to try and taste the food through the strong smell of ammonia."}
{"text":"This place was pretty darn good!  The crab puffs were my favorite omg! The mushroom chicken and orange chicken were very good.  The beef broccoli ok.  We were short one crab puff though. The egg drop soup was a little too thick for my liking.  Delivery guy was fast.  We will definitely be eating there again!!"}
{"text":"Had this 3 times for lunch, Kung Pao shrimp twice which is the best I've had. The sauce is so amazing and spicy, and they give you large shrimp! I also had the shrimp fried rice, which was good as well with those jumbo shrimp. I did try the orange chicken, wasn't a fan of the texture, didn't eat that. The sauce was yummy, so I might try orange shrimp next. The spring rolls are pretty good."}
{"text":"SPICY MI FUN NOODLES, OMG!!!   So I have been going to this restaurant faithfully for the past 10 months honestly because it is close to my job.  I haven't always got the best services, so I never gave a review,  but I must say it has gotten a WHOLE LOT better.  I always eat the same 1 of 3 different items on the lunch menu and usually its pretty good. Today I decided to try the SPICY MI FUN NOODLES................EXCELLENT, even the waitress has calmed down and is much more friendly....... Now I don't mind spending my money here, GOOD FOOD & GOOD SERVICE"}
{"text":"So how did I get here?  My wife choose to take us on a date that involved us flipping a coin at every major intersection. Heads we turned right, Tails we turn left.  13 rights and 4 lefts later we end up almost 20 miles from home at the intersection of Bell and 99th.  Chinese food sounded good so in we went.  It was a Saturday night and they weren't very busy, so that made me question going in.  First off the food was great.  The egg rolls are some of the best I have had in a very long time. I had orange chicken and my wife had general tso's chicken.   Both had the right amount of crispness, not too much breading, and good white chicken meat.  The ambiance and decor isn't as amazing as the food.  If I did take out it would be a 5 star.  Since the inside look was less than appealing I give it 4 stars.  Great food.... definitely worth trying!!"}
{"text":"My friend and I came here with her kids. She says they order delivery all the time but had never dined in. I ordered the walnut shrimp and it was delicious!!! We ordered the potstickers as an appetizer but they came out after our meal and weren't that great so prob wouldn't order those again. I will def come back to this place though. Great prices for lunch specials with big portions that you can either share or save for later"}
{"text":"Well we ordered delivery online. And I guess they hadn't checked their online orders...because an hour later I called and asked where the heck my food was and they were very apologetic.  They got the food to my house within 10 minutes after I called.  It was hot and DELICIOUS.  Probably the best Orange chicken and general chicken I have ever had.  Big portions too! My husband and I ate and had enough leftovers we will be able to eat a full meal tomorrow too.  I will definitely be ordering from them again,  but will probably order over the phone.  They are very nice and acknowledged their mistake so I was not upset  because of that.  They even threw in a free rice because of the long wait.  So I'm a happy customer."}
{"text":"Tried their delivery. Food arrived on time and hot. The food is really good. Loved the house fried rice."}
{"text":"My wife & I have eaten here for several years. We've had lunch & dinner. The food has always been wonderful & the service is very good & prompt. Great Chinese restaurant!"}
{"text":"This place is fanatastic! The ambiance is odd, very quiet and full of old folks, but the best Chinese places are always a tad weird. The food is great and the prices are rediculously low, especially their lunch specials. I would highly recommend checking this place out."}
{"text":"ONE STAR FOR LUNCH COMBO INCLUDES EGG ROLL AND CRAB PUFF WHICH WERE YUMMY BUT Gosh I wish I could say this place is adequate at best but it is not. Food is always over cooked staff very rude if you You ask for any . Soup always very old and  snotty,yuck , tried egg drop and hot and sour. Tried pretty much   4 different dishes,garlic chicken,sweet and sour chicken, Chop Suey, and Kung Pao Chicken, Unfortunately its the only chinese by my work and I keep hoping at least one dish will rise above the rest. Call be an optomist,or a fool but I love all kinds of Chinese and rally wanted to give them a chance plus they are so close it's convenient. Anyways I now drive an extra 4 miles 8 round trip down Bell Rd to get descent chinese food. What a bummer."}
{"text":"The food is priced right, and the portions are huge. My hubby's beef and broccoli was cooked perfectly, the broccoli was crisp and the meat was tender. The egg soup was full of stuff, including some pieces of mushrooms. I ordered the lo mein and thought it was just okay. The chicken pieces were big chunks and good quality, it just needed more veggies! I'll order it again, but request more veggies.   This was our first time, and we'll be going back for sure!"}
{"text":"This place is delish!! Prices are reasonable too n food comes out quick. I always get the lemon chicken. Nice n crunchy ;) people are nice too!"}
{"text":"I had to change this to 5 stars; the quality is consistently awesome, and we never wait more than 20 minutes for our food to arrive when we ask for it to be delivered!"}
{"text":"Doesn't look like much from the inside but the food is great. No complaints with quality of food. Price seems slightly above average. Will return/would recommend."}
{"text":"This place is great!  We've never dined in the restaurant, we always get delivery.  The food here is awesome!  The pork fried rice is the best!"}
{"text":"I have been looking for a Chinese restaurant with a burst of authentic Chinese flavor on the west side and think I have found it! Ordered the sesame chicken and beef with vegetables, both were delicious and highly recommended. Very reasonable prices as well. Probably a restaurant better for take out since they didn't play music and we were eating in silence but the staff was friendly and got the food out to us quick."}
{"text":"Tried again.  No crazy waitress this time!  Food is on point and fresh. They decreased portion size to normal--personally, I like that.  No MSG: No problem   Really what I am looking for: Price point, ease of use, freshness of food.  I will return.  They do delivery, so for convenience on a hot day....just saying!"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant's lunch specials. That being said,  my husband ordered the Walnut Shrimp for lunch today. Ugh, never order it! Fried shrimp on a big bed of mayonnaise with some candied walnuts thrown in. I'm not sure he will get over the nastiness of it. I'll stick to the Shrimp and Vegetables."}
{"text":"We always order takeout/delivery and the food is always great. I don't like to go in there and eat because it's not the cleanest place, my first clue was the dirty windows and door walking in. Bathrooms really needed a cleaning also. The service was great when I did eat there."}
{"text":"Loved the food.  Ordered delivery so I don't know about the wait staff or ambiance.  Delivery was fast, the food hot and tasty.  Definitely will order from Jade Star again."}
{"text":"This place is not much to look at but the food is delicious!  They don't have a kids menu and the service is just ok but not bad.  This is our third visit and every time the food has been great.  The egg rolls are very tasty and not greasy.  The crab puffs are yummy but not a lot in them.  The potstickers are not my favorite but my husband liked them.    We always get the orange chicken it's awesome, not too much breading and they give you lots of sauce!  My children love the sweet n sour chicken which is also lightly breaded and has lots of yummy sauce.    We will be back!"}
