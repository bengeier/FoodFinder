{"text":"This is the only Korean restaurant in my neighborhood (or at least, the only one i could find), so I was really happy to know about it's existense :)  I cannot say anything special about the food, because I'm not an expert in Korean cuisine, but it was pretty good and fresh. The thing I really enjoyed was friendly atmosphere. The service was excellent (if performed by the owner). We were surprised by the music there, I mean, I instantly fell in love with the place once I heard songs by the Cure, Queen, Led Zeppelin etc. Very nice and pleasant."}
{"text":"My sister took us to this restaurant when we were in Toronto.  The food was fabulous.  We ordered the bulgogi beef and the pork bone soup. The soup was very spicy and tasty.  Takes a little bit of work to get the meat off the bones though.  We also ordered the grilled eel with rice.  The portions were very generous and prices were reasonable.  The meal comes with all the little dishes of a variety of kim chi, tofu, etc. Best of all, the owners were very friendly with great service.  We would definitely go back there again when we're in Toronto next time."}
{"text":"The food here is terrible, probably the worst Korean restaurant I have been to in Toronto. Both the banchan and main course were bland and crudely put together. It didn't seem like anything had been marinated and was as if they just placed it straight from the refrigerator into the bowl.  The tea was also lukewarm and had a piece of carrot floating in it. This concerned me a lot and doesn't give me confidence in the dishwashing practices of this restaurant. The server also had a bad habit of touching the lip of the tea cup with her fingers while serving.  I found that the staff here were unprofessional. They could be heard arguing in the kitchen. They were also mopping the area (wearing full personal protection gear, so not just light tidying) where patrons were eating. Appalling.  The diners at the table next to me complained about a foreign object in their food but the server brushed it off flippantly. Then the server brought a bowl of something and stood in front of them eating it, as if to say, \"Of course the food is okay, I'm eating it too.\""}
{"text":"Came her with my GF, loved the atmosphere very traditional layout so automatic +1!  The older man who seems to run the place was pleasant and provided a patient environment. I love the lunch time specials and the number of banchan provided, though we only received 6 of them...  The quality of food is obviously not going to be as high as food served at buk chang dong or other koreatown dining options, but it was still pretty good with please of fresh ingredients and flavours. I particularly enjoyed the choice of rice as it had a balanced nutty flavour that makes brown rice so good!   We ordered the Bi Bim Bap and the Grilled Chicken, both dishes were served in a short period of time and we a well sized dish, slightly too large for a single sitting. Tea was served very slowly though which does cost them a half star.  Definitely would come here again, though there are a fairly good variety of places to try out first in that plaza so it will be a while before I come around to this place again. =/   On a random note, they had an odd cd playing which was really funny as we listened sporadically.  Final Rating: 3.5"}
{"text":"I probably don't like Korean food, I mean it says 100% Korean, yet I was only 40% on board with this place.   Angelo and I decided to meet up, and when he suggested this restaurant I was very surprised.  This after all was my neighborhood, and I've known about the existence of this restaurant forever.  I might subconsciously avoid restaurants with waxed food in their display, or maybe the placed looked so humble, I would feel bad about eating all their food--not that it's a buffet or anything.  Angelo was already seated, and he brought Stephanie.  I like Stephanie, which is the only reason I didn't bitch.  But if I were to bitch I would bitch about how boys get-togethers are not boy get-togethers when there's a chick involved.  When my friends get into a romantic relationship, they seem to completely lose their self identity!  Their facebook photos are ALWAYS with their significant other, they become inseparable and go everywhere..together.  And let's not even mention when they have a baby..oh Gawd! But I like Stephanie, she's cool, so no bitch.  I remember the place being dimly lit, and the decor resembled a Japanese apartment, which is to say it's pretty damn small.  The waiter was a Korean Grandfather who was one of the most polite person who ever hold a bowl.  I believed the authenticity of this restaurant, which obviously revealed how I felt about real Korean food.  ...not that exciting.. Leslie Plaza is a testament to restaurants, if you know your stuff then you're here to stay as long as you like, otherwise, your gone quicker than you can learn to say bibibap....or whatever.. 100% Korean has been here forever, so that speaks for itself.  The food is very well cooked, but you can also make the perfect taco..and in the end it's still just a taco..not saying that Korean food is as simple as tacos.  But I got my own rant about Korean food, and I truly believe that Koreans-ancient Koreans-were one of the laziest people in the world when it came to cooking. I mean it takes them 3 months to make cabbage!  Fair is fair, this is a three star restaurant, and although there's nothing particularly outstanding, it's authenticity gives it character.  Also it's very clean!  It was nice seeing Angelo & Stephanie together."}
{"text":"I was skeptical about this place because of some of the middling reviews and the fact that when me and my friend showed up, the place was empty save 2 couples. It was a Monday night, though, so it made sense.  The owner is so incredibly friendly and jovial that I immediately felt at ease. He chatted with me about Korea and how they make budae jigae in the back but don't serve it.  I judge Korean restaurants based on my favourite dish, dwenjang jigae, rather than what most people do, so I'm not sure if my review is an accurate depiction for others. It was pretty good, although the quality of the pork left something to be desired (lots of gristle) and they really skimped on the seafood (about one octopus piece and no clams).   Also, the rice must've been sitting for a while because it was completely congealed in its container. A strange side detail: they used \"forbidden rice\" (the purple kind) for both dishes which I've never seen for regular Korean dishes.  My friend's chicken fried rice was delicious and well-made.   It's not the best Korean place you'll ever go to but it was pretty decent and the staff were really friendly.   Worth a try if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"If I could, I would give this place negative stars. It's not Korean at all... even the tea served was Chinese. The service was horrible as tea was served once and never refilled despite the restaurant being empty and the waiter passing by multiple times. It also felt like a self serve restaurant, from choosing our own seats, requesting a menu and going up to pay because they took so long to pick up our cash. The katsu served was embarrassing. ..large thick pieces of pork that was already cut into chunks...definitely not the kind I've had at authentic restaurants. They also tried to cut corners by mixing purple rice with mushy, old chinese rice. The side dishes all tasted like there was a lack in flavour and complexity im used to at Korean places. I seriously wonder how this place stays in business."}
{"text":"I went here for dinner with a friend and it was packed. We ordered the two specials number 3 and 5 i believe. First is the Pork Bone Soup + Seafood Rice cake. The rice cake was decent and the portion was enough for one person but the pork bone soup was definitely  lacking in flavour. It was bland, no spice and it wasn't even bubbling hot when it came out. The meat was still sooo stuck to the bone. Next is the Bimbimbap + Kalbi. The kalbi was nicely flavoured but it was quite hard to chew. Also the bimbimbap was nice they offer multigrain rice so it was more filling personally. They don't give you free \"refills\" on cold dishes unlike nakwon. The service was slow especially in the kitchen, I think there was maybe 2 workers? and the server was really slow. I'm guessing he was new and still learning. I wouldn't choose to come back again but I wouldn't mind."}
{"text":"100% Korean is the type of restaurant that I wished I liked. The service was great, the food - not so much. I ordered the tofu soup for lunch, which had seafood and was really very bland though I requested spicy. The tofu was watery and sparse.   The meal comes with 6 different types of banchan; Niboshi, bean sprouts, kimchi, fried tofu, some fried meat I didn't touch, and cucumbers.   I need to mention that this was the first Asian restaurant I've visited that was thoroughly upfront with the proper receipt with taxes and gst number all accounted for. This is what proper service looks like."}
{"text":"The food here is really good.  An authentic Korean restaurant.  They always offer you sample 6-8 small dishes.  Each one very delicious.  I like their Kalbi.  Their portions are really big and their food is really cheap.  Alot of people eat their pork bone soup and beef bone soup. Pork bone is spicy and beef bone is not.  The owner is really nice.  Very good meal for a really good price.  Very clean place and amazing service.  They only sell good Korean food.  Their menu is small but what they offer is always good.  A real Korean homemade food."}
{"text":"I've passed by this place SO many times; and FINALLY - I went with a friend yesterday.  Contrary to everyone's yelp reviews - this place seems to be owned by Mandarin people.  However, the food and service was great.  8 different banchans!  They were all very delicious - ranging from kimchi, tofu, seaweed, etc!  It was great!  My friend and I ordered a spicy tofu stew.  It was not as good as buk chang dong -- but it was still great.  It had seafood in it.    The service was a little bit crappy in the beginning (guy didn't bring utensils and our banchan quickly); however the owner made everything up by being the nicest man ever."}
{"text":"Simple restaurant with a simple menu and very pleasant service.  They serve eight banchan at dinner and the food was very tasty.   Very low prices.  Good for a quick weeknight meal if you are in the area and don't feel like cooking at home."}
{"text":"This restaurant was located at the food court of Silver Stars Blvd several years ago under a different name.  Finally I found the old grandpa at this restaurant after 2 yrs.  Although the food is not excellent but I love grandpa's service.  He always put a smile on his face.  I tried the cold noodle and beef combo.  I like the cold noodle since it's summer when I've been there.  There's ice inside the soup base, but won't make the soup taste too light.  The beef is a bit overdone, still I like it.  Overall I will go again because I really love the atmosphere and see old grandpa's smiley face."}
{"text":"They moved to Midland and Steeles. Good food, great service, excellent price."}
{"text":"100% Korean Restaurant is tucked in a Chinese Plaza surrounded by all these Chinese eatery. It looks a little stretchy from outside since you cannot really see inside through the windows. However, it does serve decent Korean food.  100% Korean Restaurant is named so because it is owned and runned by a Korean family, serving only Korean food. One interesting thing is the Korean grandfather who is one of the servers is 76 years old and he can speak Korean, Japanese, English and Mandarin. Yes he speaks better Mandarian than me... shame shame shame on me!  The lunch specials serves till 2:30 pm starts from $5.95. I decide on the Bibimbap ($6.95) which is served in one of the steel bowels. They use brown rice and has a colourful presentation of veggie and  makes a great photo. The Banchen are the home made varieties and all quite delicious. The only thing I don't like is the soup, it tastes like one of those cabbage soup serves in HK style cafe...  The service here is nice and homey......and the restaurant itself is clean and well kept.  I looking forward to try their cold noodle which is seasonal next time when I visit.  They accepts Visa and Mastercard."}
{"text":"I could make better korean food with a blindfold on. Like a lot of yelpers have pointed out: -Either way over powering or bland flavours +Oily (making korean food oily is a sin) -For foods that should have been pickled like kimchi -Substituted pickling by adding vinegar or ketchup or some nasty stuff -korean food is known for big portions, no biggies here.  Ill give them a couple stars cause the decor was ironically more korean than all other korean restaurants ive been to, the service was avg."}
