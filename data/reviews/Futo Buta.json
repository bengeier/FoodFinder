{"text":"The ramen is delicious. The outdoor patio is lovely. We've always had good service, although since Futo Buta is busy at night, things can move at a slower pace. The crispy rice squares with tuna are amazing! This is a welcome addition to the Charlotte food scene."}
{"text":"Delicious creative menu. Fantastic atmosphere.  I wish I lived close enough to make this place a weekly trip"}
{"text":"This ramen is all oil. Packaged Ramen is even better than this. The chicken karage is horrible Wendy's chicken nuggets is way better also it is way cheaper than this overpriced crap"}
{"text":"Good but a little over-seasoned so not quite perfect. Donburi could do with double the rice in a bigger bowl."}
{"text":"Like the intimacy of this place and the cool location at the Bland St Lynx stop.  Really enjoyed sitting on the patio for dinner on a summer evening with the Lynx discreetly going by.  The ramen is very good.  Other dishes are interesting as well.  Would like to see a seafood ramen offered with some more traditional ingredients as well as the chef's creations.  Need to get back soon to try the donburi and buns.  Only downside is that, in view of the limited seating, the wait can sometimes be long.  And unless the patio is available, this is probably not a good place for a large crowd (6+ people)."}
{"text":"Got the Fire and Ice, and I don't know what it was that did it, but my spirit sang on the first bite. The place was crowded, but the food was SO worth it!"}
{"text":"Go here if you're a ramen fan! I've tried ramen from a lot of the other restaurants around Charlotte and no one gets close to the richness of flavor that you will get from a bowl at Futo Buta. Don't even get me started on how amazing their fire and ice ramen is!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy the Shoyu ramen, though if the Butternut Miso is available (seasonal) it is phenomenal on a cold day. Do not miss the fried brussel sprouts or the fried rice/tuna treats!  But don't come here expecting to be able to have a conversation. The music is nearly always raucous and way too loud. It really doesn't fit the space or the food."}
{"text":"Noodles are Made In House. Quality is everything about this restaurant. highly recommend the appetizers. Brussel Sprouts are simple and delicious.  Expect a wait during peak hours"}
{"text":"I took my dad here on a visit to Charlotte. It was his first ramen experience and he left a happy man. The pecan smoked pork belly in the buns and the ramen was excellent as was the broth in my miso ramen. All around a good experience."}
{"text":"A nice spin on ramen that still delivers an authentic experience. The Miso had a little less pork than desired but the egg, sprouts and cabbage were cooked perfectly and the corn was a nice addition to traditional ramen.  Will definitely be coming back to try more variations."}
{"text":"Cannot beat the broth and the flavors   All very healthy   Since I am GF I just get rice with the bowls.   Sriracha peppers rally good too.   Music gets a little loud for me but seems to work for most."}
{"text":"Fun eclectic ramen restaurant with a southern touch. Place is cramped which is perfectly suited to the Asian noodle bar theme. Food is fantastic. Pork bone broth has incredible depth to its flavor."}
{"text":"Went here the other night with a friend. While the location is great for those of us who live in south end, I was not impressed. Friends who went last week warned me that it was meh-- expensive for what they got and nothing special. But I decided to give this place a try anyway. I was sorry I did. The inside space is pretty cramped, and there's basically one long communal table and then some small tables in the back. I got the hungry miso ramen which had no flavor. The waiters were friendly enough and were very knowledgeable about the menu. But for a main dish, I was very sad about my experience and wish I hadn't paid $12 for what essentially tasted like a bowl of water with a small amount of pork stuck in it."}
{"text":"I been here a few times with friends there ramen is good but not the best. I had their tonkasu tamer and fire and ice ramen, also had a cold noodles dish called hiyahi it was seasonal I have to say it was very disappointing since it half filled with vinegar and soy sauce it was not  good at one. It was not worth it. Overall it was okay."}
{"text":"Not exactly the most authentic Japanese ramen, but maybe I'm just spoiled. Great atmosphere and service though!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite lunch spots in Charlotte. If I have company in town, I always bring them to Futo Buta! Delicious, filling and a fun place to enjoy a great meal!"}
{"text":"First of all, I love ramen!!! I've been eaten ramen for 20+ years, and had really authentic ramen in Japan.  I've been to Futo Buta twice. 4 star for food, 2 for experience.  Food - I have tried Tonkotsu, Miso with added Spicy Pork, Fire&Ice, and Hiyashi. They are all decent, but then again I like ramen in general. Tonkotsu and Miso soup base are a bit over salty. Salmon in Fire&Ice was better than I expected. I would come back just because there is limited options for ramen in Charlotte. If this place was in LA, I probably would come back only for convenience.  Waiter - For the second visit, the waiter who led us to the table was very rude. We had 5, and he insisted we either sit at a 4-person table, or wait for another table to finish. There were 2 4-person tables available next to each other, and this was at 3pm on Monday, so the restaurant was not busy. We took the 4-person table thinking it would work, since 1 of us was a child. However, the table was made up of two separate pieces, so there was a big gap in the middle, and 1 person couldn't fit comfortably without having to awkwardly lean over to one side. So we asked the waiter if we could split into a table of 3, and a table of 2, and just occupy both the 4-person tables. Wow, did we get scolded as if we were little kids. He insisted we need to wait for another table to finish if we can't all fit in the 4-person table. We were too hungry to wait, so had to awkwardly eat our ramen. Even after we finished, the table we supposedly had to wait for was still not finished, and they decided to seat a party of 2 at the 4-person table we wanted to occupy, while other 2-seats remained open at the restaurant."}
{"text":"I order the TONKOTSU but there is no pork in it!  I order the tuna on rice to go and the tuna portion is tiny.  I would like the Uni and toro on crispy seaweed but it is out of order in a late afternoon on Friday.  The restaurant is in the dead end of a side street which is not convenient if you drive and try to locate it."}
{"text":"Just phenomenal! Unbelievable ingredients and quality. I lived in Astor Place for 10yrs and loved Ippudo, considered by many to be one of the best Ramen in NYC, if not the US.   This place is just as good - must try!"}
{"text":"Favorite new place. Fire and Ice is fantastic. Great apps, good beer selection. One of few that all 6 in the fam ask to visit"}
{"text":"We've been there a few times and never been disappointed. I always get the tuna w/ the rice cake app - omg it's sooo good!! Then one of the noodle bowls, from what I can tell they are all good. I always add the spicy pork to mine. I usually can't finish much of it, so I take it home and I think it's even better the next day.  The servers are all super nice. The place gets packed, so get there early or be ready to wait!"}
{"text":"This place blew me away. Super modern, amazing ambiance, and definitely the kind of place you want to go back to. I went on a Saturday night around 7pm with a friend, and everything from the wait staff to the atmosphere to the ramen was fantastic. The pork belly used in both my shoyu ramen and my companion's tonkatsu bowl was smoked with pecan involved somehow and holy mother of god it was so good. Seriously. Get the pork if your dietary habits allow it.  Slight tangent for people after lemonade in the Yelp search bar- their strawberry lemonade is killer. I've never had anything like it. It came out of a metal brewer-type dispenser like those used for tea, which makes me think they really do make it by batch with real fruit. (Don't quote me on that or anything because I didn't think to ask, just know that it was definitely one of a kind.) They had a pretty extensive sake list, as well, from what I saw.  My only surprise (and I wouldn't even consider this a complaint, just an unexpected twist) was that the space in Futo Buta really is a premium, seemingly modeled after traditional ramen houses. It got a little crowded once the football crowd came around, but I figure my surprise was just my Southern upbringing where people anticipate miles between each table, haha. Overall awesome experience."}
{"text":"A truly authentic experience, very knowledgeable staff, amazingly balanced flavors, all in a very cool little spot with a great vibe.   You do leave Charlotte when you enter this spot. We are fortunate to have new places like this here.   The music was a bit obnoxious for the type of meal we were having but the ramen was so damn good it was forgivable."}
{"text":"The food here is really delicious. At first I always ordered ramen, but there are several items on the specialty menu that I have tried and everything has been great. It's a lot of fun to sit outside on the patio as it gets warmer and enjoy the food. The only complaint I have about the restaurant is that it's too small and it is hard to get in with a larger group."}
{"text":"Fellow Yelpers' opinion on this place has been divided.  Having waited long enough, it was my turn to try their Tonkotsu ramen for authenticity.   The presentation of the ramen was great and clearly showed effort - slices of fatty roast pork, onsen egg, black ear mushrooms, menma, ginger, sesame and scallions.  The soup also had the right color and consistency.  With all the visual elements of the ramen done right, you would expect a strong, almost creamy tonkotsu broth bursting with flavour to complete the picture of the \"pefect\" tonkotsu ramen.  I took a sip of the broth with huge anticipation, but what a let down... the soup lacked flavour/depth and was simply underwhelming.  For the rest of the bowl, the noodles were bland, but the ingredients tasted ok.    I hate to say it as I had really high hopes walking in, but what a huge disappointment.  Ippudo should consider opening a shop here in the Queen City and they will beat every single competition hands down in this desert town for Asian cuisine."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed with this place. It took 10 minutes before someone even acknowledged us.  We ordered two apps and two ramen bowls.  The ramen was bland and so was the gyoza. For $50 for those two small items plus the entree, I can say I definitely won't be back unless they improve on the flavor.  Thought Charlotte would finally have a good ramen spot but I was highly wrong. I will say the ambiance was nice."}
{"text":"The quality of ingredients and attention to detail that Futo Buta serves up with their ramen makes this one of my favorite restaurants in Charlotte. The first time I went to this place I ended up going every day that week. It's amazing and addicting so be careful."}
{"text":"My absolutely favorite restaurant in Charlotte. i move here about a year and a half ago and the food is top notch! The decor is quirky, but it totally works. The Fire and Ice bowl is the best thing on the menu and I've learned to ask for a to go box so i can enjoy their Green Tea Ice cream too!"}
{"text":"So good.  Can't recommend this gem enough.  Have taken so many folks here, and they're all blown away by the freshness and cool concept."}
{"text":"Delicious and unique! Just wish the place was bigger so you didn't have to sit elbow to elbow with strangers."}
{"text":"So thankful for Yelp!!  Since leaving CA I realy thought my Los Angeles ramen days were over.  This place is 1.5 hrs from us but worth the drive EVERY time.  Its one of those tucked away gems that you dont want to Yelp to everyone, but this place is so good that hopes of keeping it quiet wouldn't last long.  Our favorites are the edamame, fried brussels sprouts, pork belly buns, all varieties of ramen (with the spicy pork) and Strawberry Basil soft serve.  They have an awesome Sake selection as well."}
{"text":"We thought this place would be great, we were very wrong. The ramen is overpriced and the servingwsre very small, with just one small piece of meat in it. The staff us stuck up and the sign that says \"thou shall not slurp\" is the most rude passive aggressive thing a Resturant could have in it. We sat at the counter and were told to move by the manager. The manager was training a new employee. He was extremely rude to her.  Typical south end business, poor food/products, stuck up employees, and overpriced."}
{"text":"I had never been to a Ramen restaurant but this was worth circling the block a few times to find.  The Rice Crispy Squares with seared Tuna were fabulous.  The peppers were very good.  We did not order these but our neighbor at the shared table insisted we try them.  Our neighbor to the other side insisted we try their chicken...it too was fabulous.  We made good friends (even though I was old enough to be everyones mother in the place).  Also had the Miso Ramen which was very really yummy. Next time I will try it with the spicy pork as Frankie G says.  Lastly we had the Waygu Carpacio...OMG...it was fabulous.  Definitely will be back!!"}
{"text":"Not only was the service phenomenal, but the manager made a point to say hello after hearing I was a first time customer.   On top of the wonderful public relations touches, the ramen was delicious."}
{"text":"Very good apps, ramen, and awesome location. Food comes out a bit slow and the space is pretty small, so be prepared to wait unless you go right when it opens. The price point is a little high, but there's only a few ramen places in Charlotte to choose from. Will be back."}
{"text":"The food was very good. I would have given a 5 star but the broth was a little too salty for my taste. The fried brussel sprouts were delcious. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place 2 stars because I did enjoy outdoor service & the tuna app once, and my comrades enjoyed their meal..... However, we recently wasted the better part of a Friday night on a less than competent hostess & a manager than clearly had no actual monetary stake in this establishment. Any further commentary about this matter, would just encumber my evening."}
{"text":"Michael and his team are just like their food - OUTSTANDING.  We have eaten there twice now and will absolutely go back again.  The eclectic ambiance reminds me of noodle houses in New York City.  Knowing that everything in the kitchen is made on premise really adds great value to what one received.  The But a bowl is my favorite as are the fried brussel sprouts and crispy rice and tuna appetizer.  Great location, great service and even greater food!"}
{"text":"I don't think this place is worth the praise that previous yelpers have said. The homemade ramen isn't anything amazing. Although you may think that smoking the porkbelly prior to putting it in the ramen sounds good, but their execution ended up in drying out the meat. In addition the smoked porkbelly doesn't compliment the Asian flavor of the ramen. Perhaps there's not a big population of Asians in Charlotte to really critique the food.."}
{"text":"Having lived in Japan for a few years, I missed authentic ramen. I was so excited to try this restaurant with my 3 friends. Service was below average. Waitress makes rude remarks. The ramen was way too salty, which overpowered the flavors you're supposed to pick up subtlety in ramen. You're supposed to taste a little salt, a little sweet, a little sour, and a robust aroma. All I tasted was salt. Disappointing. My homemade ramen tastes better. Won't be coming back."}
{"text":"I love eclectic food and this is it -  clean flavors, delicious, fresh and flavorful. The staff is attentive and made some great suggestions. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Great place, original menu and good (albeit tight) environment. Original offering makes for a very much needed alternative. Service and food were great! If you go at busy times expect a 20-30 min wait, but it makes sense given the popularity of the spot."}
{"text":"Loved the food! The brussel sprouts were crispy and sweet and some of the best I've ever had. The ramen was super salty but pretty amazing nonetheless - it reminded me of great ramen in nyc. We had a weird moment with a server though, which rubbed both my husband and me the wrong way. We'll come back, but hope to not have to support that server again."}
{"text":"Food was good, but the service was so-so and the music was so loud we couldn't hear ourselves think let alone talk to each other.  We asked them to turn the music down a little but they refused."}
{"text":"Umai! I have eaten at a lot of ramen houses and this definitely ranks at the top. The broth is rich without being fatty or over salted, as you get in some places. The bowls are works of art. And the combination of flavors--words cannot describe how good the food was. The buns were amazing. Best of all, your meal can be topped off with housemade soft serve ice cream.   The only tiny downside is that I feel the \"ramen\" is more akin to soba. It's definitely got some buckwheat content to it. Still chewy and delicious, but definitely not your classic yellow ramen.  If I could sneak away from work every day, I would!"}
{"text":"I want to give Futo Buta 5 stars based on the food alone, however, the service has lost 2 stars. We went in on a weekday around 7pm to sit at the bar and catch a soccer match while enjoying some ramen. It took the staff around 5-10 minutes to get us menus, and another 5-10 to get us waters. This all regardless of the fact that their expo was commenting on the game.   I'll go again because I loved the food, maybe try takeout though."}
{"text":"Holy cow! I had the Chizu and my husband got the Tonkotsu (mine was better) and I couldn't wait to go back to get more! I had been to a ramen house in NY and was turned off by it because it was so bland and blah. Definitely not the case here! I highly recommend trying this place out!"}
{"text":"Went there today for lunch. The ramen was fine. Fried rice cakes excellent, what ruined the experience though was how rude the hostess who sat us was. She didn't crack a smile and actually seemed outright annoyed that she had to show us a table. When we got to it she literally just threw the menus on the table and walked away.  Our waitress was fine and I almost said something to her about it but didn't. They need to tell their employees to least try and appear half way friendly."}
{"text":"Not bad and one of the only options for real ramen in Charlotte. The tuna poke on crispy rice is great, tonkatsu ramen flavorful and the pork very tender. Noodles are a bit mushy each of the ~10 times we've visited."}
{"text":"I was pumped to hear that there was a Ramen house in Charlotte. I come down here x3-4 a times a year from NYC and love that there is more diverse restaurants developing here.   I ordered the:  Pork buns- asked for no sesame slaw- it was pretty solid but for $5 a piece (comparable price to NYC) it better beat out any of David Changs restaurants, Baohous, or Ippudo buns- didn't compare.  Rice Crispy: This was worth it- it's sushi rice fried with tuna on the side.   *Miso Ramen: By far the worst Ramen I've had, however it \"looked\" really good...   Broth was weak and super oily- soup is usually oily looking but it adds to the taste, this added no flavor. Temperature was lukewarm, noodles were soggy- textures vary from shop- but this was clearly overcooked or sitting in the soup for a while which would explain the lukewarm temp. The \"soft boiled\" egg that typically comes in Miso was raw- I cut into it then it just disappeared in the soup. This isn't supposed to happen, the egg white is supposed to be cooked through and the egg yolk should be runny. The Chasu- was rubbery and had a BBQ flavor- doesn't match the bowl flavoring.  *to be fair, I am very particular about Ramen- spending time in Tokyo, Osaka, and Kyoto. So this very well may suite the taste of the south and people not familiar with Ramen. With that said, I think there should be a disclaimer for twists on the Ramen via BBQ chasu in traditional Miso. I'm definitely open to new tastes but it has to flow, Tokyo is well known for this and Ramen Lab in NYC is too.  In the end, I didn't want to write a review but: 1) The Ramen is priced like NYC so it should be at the bare minimum decent.   2) The server saw I didn't eat the Ramen and didn't care one bit.  I hope that they fix the issues because it's so amazing that a Ramen house is open in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Before coming here, I only had the ramen that came in packets that you add water to and microwave. That ramen wasn't very good, and I only ate it during my poor college days. When my husband suggested coming here, I couldn't imagine the ramen tasting that different. Boy was I wrong! First of all, they make their own ramen, so it's none of that prepackaged stuff. Second of all, the variety of toppings and delicious broths makes the ramen taste amazing! I am a big fan of the chizu ramen, which has cheese, egg, pesto and garlic. I add the spicy ground pork for an extra $2, which I think makes the dish even more flavorful! This is one of those places I like to bring out-of-town guests, because it's unique and everyone likes it."}
{"text":"This place was amazing. I haven't been to any other restaurants in Charlotte like this one, the food was fantastic  The staff was friendly and the atmosphere was great. The inside of the restaurant was small but very busy. Even the music was good (Nirvana). I would highly recommend Futo Buta."}
{"text":"Pretty good ramen.  Their buns are better than their ramen.  Pork belly and duck buns are really good.  Very difficult to find.  You can park on S. Boulevard and walk towards crispy crep.  It's parallel to the light rail."}
{"text":"Well, firstly the location of Futo Buta is perfect- right off the light rail (30 second walk from Bland Street station), the neighborhood is one of the best in CLT and what I loved most of all, is that it was \"off-the-beaten-track\" as it was't on any road. We were planning on riding the light rail, but it was closed for construction.   When we went (12/20/15) it was quite busy with only one table left or seats at the bar avaliable- get the seats to the right of the bar, you can see into the kitchen and talk to the very friendly and enthusiastic staff.  The waitress serving was very helpful in describing the and recommending dishes on the menu, she was very talkative and down to earth. We didn't order any sake or alcohol but there was a large selection, other drinks were Coca-Cola products or flavored San Pellegrino. It would have been brilliant if they had Japanese sodas such as Ramune.   On to the food, we ordered two appetizers- Tori Kara Age (Japanese fried chicken) and the Low Country Smoked Pork Belly Buns. The buns were very good as the pork just melted in your mouth and the gochujang BBQ sauce was tangy and complimented the dish perfectly. The fried chicken was light and crispy and came with a chili aioli, which had a small kick to it.   We ordered the Tonkotsu ramen- warning it's big, we shared it (between two) and we still couldn't finish it. The broth was so good, you could feel it going down your throat and warming you up. the onsen egg was very good, I tried it before in Korean ramen but never in Japanese. The only very minor complaint I have, is that there were only 3 pieces of pork in the ramen- and it wasn't cheap, so for $14 I wasn't that impressed with the amount of pork.   And finally we tried the Japanese soft serve, which was very large as well. The flavor changes daily, but we had Black Sesame plus Ginger and Peach swirled together, it was the perfect way to finish such as good meal."}
{"text":"Update 1/2018: we were told the wait time would be 30-40 minutes and it ended up being an hour and a half. Be prepared to wait A LONG TIME for substandard ramen - there are better places nearby - this place is NOT worth the wait. Review from 5/2017: My boyfriend and I stumbled upon this place after grabbing a drink at Wooden Robot. It is tucked away behind the tracks and a little hard to find (Google misled us a bit). The ambiance is nice - very chill and pretty dark. I didn't love the seating because it was just the two of us and we were sat shoulder to shoulder to another couple. I was really pleased with how great the service was and how willing they were to custom my ramen order because I am allergic to pork. However, the flavor of the broth was really disappointing. I wish I could give this place more stars because they were so helpful and it was a great night but the food just wasn't that great. My boyfriend got a pork broth and he really enjoyed it - so maybe that's the trick. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Food was awesome BUT won't be returning due to bad service and VERY annoying experience...music too loud!  I felt like I was in a club! YOU'RE NOT A DANCE CLUB, SO  TURN THE MUSIC DOWN ITS ANNOYING WHILE EATING!!!!!!!!! FIRST....there were several tables available and for anyone that has been there you know its a very small place, so this is a good thing! The waiter didn't seat us quickly because they had to check with the manager on where we could sit. WTH?  3 tables left and you had to ask manager where to sit us?!  We were with someone that was not able to sit at the high bar stools due to just having major back surgery, so we needed a table with normal chairs.....as there was 3 tables free (equaled about 14 empty seats). We did tell the waiter this, but that didn't seem to register at all. When we finally told them again.... NO , we cannot sit at the bar on the high bar stools due to our friend who is temporarily handicap they finally let us sit at one of the many open tables.  Still have no idea why they didn't seat us at a table first, since the other tables sat there empty for at least another 20 minutes before anyone came in to eat.  SECOND, waitress was didn't even smile or say hello when she approached us. RUDE!!!!! She didn't tell us anything about the food or place, just went straight to taking our food order and NEVER asked for our drink order and she disappeared until the food was ready. THIRD  the music was so loud that we couldn't even hear our waitress speak and when we kept asking her to repeat she got very annoyed with us.  We sat through our entire dinner not saying a word, because the music was so loud. We are not old peeps and this still bothered us, so I can't imagine someone that is older that isn't use to loud music. Unfortunately, won't be returning until they get some common sense on ambiance and friendlier staff."}
{"text":"I really like this place great ambient ,rammen is well cook full of flavors ,very good customer service"}
{"text":"I have been there twice (so far) and both times have been great experiences. Excellent service from each and every staff member. Courtney in particular was great, very professional but also funny. Appetizers are very interesting and are good sized portions, enough to share between 2 or 3 folks. Miso servings are generous & very satisfying. Food has a light healthy taste to it, i had PLENTY to eat but didn't leave feeling stuffed."}
{"text":"Since visiting Japan, and learning that Charlotte had its own ramen house, I couldn't wait to go to Futo Buta. Conveniently located along the light rail at the Bland Street stop (northbound side), this small, cozy space was welcoming after a chilly stroll around South End. We arrived shortly after 5pm, which was good timing before it got crowded, and were sat right away. Our waitress was helpful in explaining the menu, different types of ramen, and assisting my sister who is gluten free (she could order any ramen bowl and relpace the noodles with rice, which she enjoyed). I ordered the tonkotsu, which is as close to traditional ramen as one can get. It was so good and reminded me of Japan! The bowl is plenty of food, as I was unable to finish it (but of course made sure I didn't leave any of the pork belly). It is a popular spot among my co-workers and friends familiar with South End, and I'm excited to go back and try more of the ramen bowls."}
{"text":"Very disappointing. We ordered fire and ice ramen, vegan ramen, and two eggplant buns all for $40+. Too salty, too fatty, and, for that portion size and quality, way overpriced."}
{"text":"Tried out their pork belly ramen with spicy pork sauce.  A nice experience."}
{"text":"I am hooked. Found this little gem when I woke up one morning after a late night of partying and craving some good Ramen. The problem was I didn't know where in Charlotte I could get good Ramen because, well, it's Charlotte. And I'm a California bay area girl so I know good Ramen. I decided to google \"best Ramen in Charlotte\" and Futo Buta came right up! I text one of my girlfriends to meet me there and off we went to have our Ramen adventure. While it's not the easiest place to find if you're not familiar with the area, it being tucked away a bit, it is an extremely wonderful, fantastic find.  I've gone twice in one week I loved it so much. I definitely recommend the crispy rice squares. I am so in love with this place."}
{"text":"Ramen is life. I give everything about this place 5 stars. Food. Drinks. Service. Broth. Noodles. Presentation. Service. 5 STARS."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in Charlotte right now! House smoked pecan wood pork belly... need I say more? The pork buns, Brussels sprouts are the way to go with appetizers. The sushi is also fantastic. The ramen is their showcase item and they are all out of this world! A must try for all!"}
{"text":"Awesome food.  Went for lunch.  Staff couldn't have been nicer as I was a ramen novice.  Great location too."}
{"text":"Glad to finally have a real ramen shop in the neighborhood! I had the pork and scallop gyoza to start and pork broth ramen with pork belly. Both were delicious! It is always cool to see the chef/owner actually in the kitchen. I hope this place turns into a staple in the area. I also see it becoming popular for a quick late night bite on the weekends. Will be back soon! Can't wait until the full menu is available!"}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong - the food and patio is excellent. However, the three times I've been here have been complete misses with service. Rude, unhelpful, and unwilling to accommodate customers - what gives? Despite feeling like you're an inconvenience, you won't be disappointed by the menu."}
{"text":"We scratched our heads (party of 4 seasoned world travelors) wondering what the fuss was about. Yes, the $12 rice cake was amazing, however the much raved about soup was slimy, fatty, flavorless and salty.  I think for my money, I'll go buy a$1.00 package of ramen and get creative."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar and took all ordering recommendations from the bartender and he nailed it. Rice Crispy squares were delicious and very unique. Pork Belly bun was also very good. Miso Ramen was also a nice addition to what we were having.  Overall a very good experience here."}
{"text":"First time to Futo Buta. First time to a Ramen Restaurant. Could have not been more pleased with the experience. We ordered the Pineapple Dreamsicle and Sakepolitan, the Crispy Rice Cakes and two Ramen dinners. Our server did a nice job of helping us learn the menu and make our choices. All our drinks and food were terrific. Only one suggestion - the background music was a hard rock selection which seemed out-of-place given the rest of the experience. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I love this place! Tiny, way too tiny for how popular it is. BUT delicious Ramen and buns! Even the veggie ones were good. I usually have the fire and ice bowl here because I usually am not eating meat the day I go there, which is a ridiculous shame."}
{"text":"Best ramen I have had since I lived in Japan and their ice cream is always a treat.  I look forward to seeing what the new flavor is every time I go.  The service is always good, but there can be a wait during peak hours and seating indoors is crowded and not the most comfortable for sitting and having a conversation over a meal.  But hey, it was that way in the ramen shops in Japan too."}
{"text":"The ramen I had called fire and ice. kimchi broth, hot smoked salmon, fresh mint, cabbage, shaved carrot, radish, black sesame. Beautiful and delicious!"}
{"text":"So happy about having this ramen place in charlotte! The ramen was delicious and had the wagyu tartare for an appetizer and that was amazing! The duck confit bao needed more flavor though."}
{"text":"Exceptional! In town for work and this was my first visit, but I'll be back! The place was packed but cozy, staff was awesome, and HOLY HELL the food was good! The gyoza, obsessed. Then I got the Buta Bowl of ramen, figuring it was the house specialty, and that was INSANELY delicious. The server did warn me that it was spicy, and it's extremely rare that I find something too spicy so I thought that was fine, but this soup was SPICY. So delicious and so spicy. I commented to one of the servers that it was really spicy, sort of laughingly explaining my teary eyes, and she told me with that dish it's best to order the spicy stuff on the side (the broth itself isn't spicy, I think) and kindly offered another bowl of broth to cut the spice down a bit, which with some shame I took. That made it all better, but also even MORE food on top of this already very generous portion, and they gladly wrapped my leftovers which I will be devouring pretty much as soon as there is room in my stomach again. The best thing I've done in 3 days in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Continue to enjoy Futo Buta. Took my staff there for lunch and when they heard we were going eating Ramen they were all bummed. But NOT after we ate! Haha Now they're all bringing their spouses back for more! Great food, good service, worth every penny. For those of you who don't like Ramen this is the place to change your mind."}
{"text":"Went to Futo Buta after seeing the great reviews. However, I did not find the ramen as amazing as what others had made it out to be. I ordered tonkatsu and it was flavorless. I'm disappointed, but I'm guess since there are few ramen options around in Charlotte.... by comparison, this is probably one of the better places. One the bright side, the salmon belly nigiri was amazing."}
{"text":"Good Ramen. Really salty but that's how it's supposed to be. Even after getting it via Postmates, it was still plenty hot and very delicious."}
{"text":"Addicted to this place and the food delicious! Love the views and the vibes of their outdoor eating area."}
{"text":"I would recommend everyone to check this place out. I have always been a ramen fanatic and I can not even begin to describe how delicious and amazing the Miso bowl is. The fried crispy Brussels and Shishito peppers were wonderful and full of flavor as well. Great service, quick and friendly!! I will be going back very soon."}
{"text":"Being new to Charlotte, we were so excited to learn that there was a ramen place here. Having been deprived of that pork broth for weeks, we went hunting for the best ramen. My other half and I traveled the world a bit and have tried a variety of different flavored ramen broth. So I think I would know the profile of tonkotsu ramen. What we expected was a rich pork flavor. What we got was a bowl of noodles sitting in a bland and under seasoned broth. To top it off, there was a layer of oil that congealed if left untouched for a few seconds. It was missing that salty porky flavor that would have been developed have it had been slow cooking for hours before it was served. The shoyu was a little bit better but was lacking that kick that makes you feel warm and fuzzy. For the price we paid, I dont think it was woth $14 a bowl. Very disappointed and underwhelmed. We left our bowls nearly full. Will not be coming back here ever again."}
{"text":"I said I'd update to 5 stars once I tried more of the menu. Glad to be keeping my word. Service: wonderful. Food: excellent. Atmosphere: comfortable and eclectic. A lovely place to come with a small group or for date night. I'm looking forward to coming back for the always impressive ramen, the seasonal, unusual ice cream flavors and sake flight. J'adore."}
{"text":"Me and my friends wanted to try this place for the longest! We finally found a day perfect to meet up at this place. All of us order a bowl of ramen and was looking forward to a great bowl of ramen based off of the reviews that we have seen.   We all ordered the Tonkatsu ramen. When we first tried it, we weren't impressed at all. To be honest, it was very hard to even finish the bowl. We weren't the type to stop eating completely and ask to take the ramen off the bill but we had to! We couldn't take more than 3 bites.    The ramen soup was very bland. All you can really taste is the large amount of sesame oil that the soup and ramen were drenched in. It was very bad. The noodles weren't even traditional ramen noodle. I don't see how other reviewers gave this place such a good review.. Maybe it's bc they haven't tried good ramen before or even tried ramen period. Don't waste your $14 for a bowl of ramen here that's all I can say"}
{"text":"We moved to the Edge of Noda in September 2015 and absolutely love it here.  Maintenance is A1 service..   Even though we have rarely had to use maintenance the times we did call they were here in 15 minutes and were so pleasant and cleaned up when they left. The office managers are so easy to work with and treat us like family.  The apartments are very roomy and fashionable.  I love our new gym and huge pool that even has handicap availability.  The dog park is great.  People keep their area nice and tidy and its great living here and did I mention FREE water!!  5  star apartments!!"}
{"text":"Loving this place! I was searching the area for decent Ramen and this one popped up on my radar. The address is a bit misleading, it takes a few minutes to figure out it's around the block and in the back left of the building by the railroad tracks. Don't let your GPS fool you.  I really enjoyed the Vegetarian/Vegan options. Shishito Peppers, Red Miso Tofu, and fried Brussels Sprouts were great (I scraped off the Bonito flakes). The Niwa Ramen was very good, though a little plain (the noodles were the star, not so much the broth). I spiced it up with Shichimi powder and some hot chili oil and it really came to life. The Eggplant and Zucchini bun was delicious, though a bit pricey at $10. I was able to see a lot of interesting dishes on other tables, it really did remind me of my time in Japan. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I love ramen & I love it done right!   My boyfriends miso ramen was so much better than mine. I'm def coming back!!!"}
{"text":"I've been to Futo Buta many times. The food and the service are always spectacular, but I wanted to rate after my visit last night. It looked a bit chaotic when we arrived, so we were prepared for the 20-25 wait. Too crowded to wait inside, but thankfully there were 2 heaters to warm those of us waiting outside. Despite the crowd, the gentlemen hosting last night was 100% top notch! Never missed a beat, was friendly, personable, and professional. In addition to dining in, they have to-go service, which also operates flawlessly. This place has one of the best staffs in Charlotte (or anywhere, for that matter). Always friendly, helpful, and patient. This is truly a fine-tuned machine. The White House should take note. :-P The food speaks for itself, but after watching and experiencing the service there last night, I wanted to give special props to the staff."}
{"text":"It's pretty convenient for those who use the light rail as it's right on the line but the ramen itself is decent.  It was not crowded with I went which was nice but I'm not sure about other times of the week.  I think that the ramen could be more flavorful but I will definitely have to come back to try again."}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE this little spot! Delicious food, great smiling staff, unique drinks and dishes. The food is top quality and impeccably prepared!"}
{"text":"Ramen is good, not the best I've had, but they do a great job with the presentation. Tiny hipster place. Prices are riDONK, and I'm not one to be cheap about food either. The food was just not worth the price and wait time.  Their fresh menu was good, didn't get to try their uni though, so that was disappointing.  Will likely not go back."}
{"text":"Futo Buta, fantastic!!! Had to circle the block to find it but parked in the deck and had a awesome meal with my son. Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"This is the best Ramen place in Charlotte (also within 50 miles of Charlotte). I have been going there since they opened a couple of years ago and it is a \"can't miss\" in my opinion. It is a little on the pricey side: Tonkotsu for 2+ appetizer and a beer/glass of wine +tip- around $60 but well worth it."}
{"text":"I had been to Futo But a a few time before for lunch. I decide I would try to take my wife who is gluten free due to celiac disease. Stephanie, our waitress, and Mike, the manager, could not have been more accommodating, helpful, and all around awesome to us. They both thoroughly explained what my wife could eat, what they could change, and provided some solid recommendations. We began with the Japanese fried chicken (which is gluten free as they use corn starch) as an app. My wife ordered Chizu which was accommodated for her with rice on the side instead of noodles. She loved it. I (not GF) had the fire and ice. We both loved every bite of our food. Our good friend had the Miso and he raved about it. In the past I've greatly enjoyed the Tonkotsu (the more \"traidiontal\" bowl) along with their pork and duck buns. I've yet to not enjoy something from here. The drink section is great and they are (I believe) the only place in the area with Genshu. I've been here before and had a great meal, but tonight was above and beyond thanks to Stephanie and Mike's amazing service and help. Thank you!"}
{"text":"DELICIOUS & wonderful - good luck getting a seat, but otherwise, HIGHLY recommend.  Wish I could figure out how to make the crispy rice squares at home, but they are PHENOM."}
{"text":"We tried this place several times. The service is attentive and points out items on the menu well. Unfortunately, for us most of the soup stocks from all the soups we have tasted were overly salty and we felt bloated afterwards. The prices are generally tending towards the higher end for the type of food that is offered and require high sodium tolerance."}
{"text":"I have dreams about the Miso ramen soup at Futo Buta. I always upgrade and add an egg, cheese, chorizo to make it the best tasting $15 bowl of soup around. Top it off with chili oil and make it complete.  I love the Tori Kara Age (chicken with chili mayo and lime), the brussel sprouts, rice crispy squares with tuna. I've never had a bad meal here. Always piping hot, fresh and plentiful.  It is usually over crowded inside due to its small size but I think that is part of the charm. You may have to climb onto your barstool or sit two inches from a stranger.  Talk or don't talk, no one seems to be offended.  I like this atmosphere. Seems like all the attention is on the food. Most are just happy to get a table.  Come winter when a good bowl of soup is what you need, you'll welcome it at any proximity to strangers.  Perhaps you'll leave with a new friend but should always leave full and satisfied."}
{"text":"My first visit was a few weeks ago and I will be going back for sure. I got the Shoyu dish and it was very good. Location is great, it is on the rail trail and two transit routes, the light rail stops at the front door."}
{"text":"I love this place for noodles! Service is good, atmosphere is cool and food is consistently tasty. I plan on many more meals eaten at Futo Buta. The fire and ice noodle bowl is my favorite."}
{"text":"My favorite place of the year!  Outside of the \"box\" food wise. I have tried almost everything on the menu and haven't been disappointed by anything. The tonkatsu (sp?) is by far my favorite. I sub the pork belly for the spicy ground pork instead. The shishito peppers are amazing but very spicy. Best to get them early in the season of when they grow because they seem less hot then. The food is local, the pottery is local, and the environment is super friendly but modern at the same time. Love it!"}
{"text":"Favorite restaurant in Charlotte. Everything they make is so good. Music and atmosphere is energetic and fun. You have to start with the brussels and then any ramen is a good choice. Ask the wait staff on tips how to eat your ramen.. the more you practice, the better you are at it. Make sure you get their house made ice cream... green tea is out of this world."}
{"text":"Awesome place!   So glad we came.  The food, atmosphere, and service was great!   Been really missing Japanese noodles since coming east.   Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"I have been to Futo several times and it has never let me down. I love all sorts of food but I coined the phrase \"if it's from the sea, it's not for me\". Well... that was before Futo Buta and their too damn delicious to pass up Crispy Rice Squares with tuna and wasabi soy sauce. That tuna is so delicious I requested it for my birthday this year and for me that's a big compliment. If you can't stomach the fish don't sweat it, check out the pork belly buns, the duck confit buns, the tori kara age, or even the fried brussel sprouts :)"}
{"text":"Loved this place! There was a bit of a wait but easy to use the app and have a drink close by. Once we were sat the service was great and food just delicious!"}
{"text":"The brussel sprout appetizer is off the hook.  Pork belly buns are excellent too.  I can't wait to go back to this place!"}
{"text":"Ate here on a weekend trip to Charlotte for lunch. We waited about 10 minutes before we were sat at the bar. The beverage choices were awesome and we both had beers. For the ramen we got the cold mezemen and I had the chizu which was great. we also ordered the Uni nigiri which had a strange taste to it that we really didn't like at all. We also got ice cream before we left which I highly reccomend ! The green tea and honey is delicious. I dropped a star just because it's so difficult to find and the quality of the Uni was lacking. But the service is awesome!"}
{"text":"This restaurant was recommended to me by a stranger in the Ciel Gallery in Charlotte, when I asked if there was a good place to eat in the area.  Futo Buta is located next to the train track, in a cool area of downtown Charlotte.  The train runs through downtown and sidewalks are located on either side to encourage pedestrian traffic.  It seemed very safe and truly a great way of getting a taste of local life.  I walked in and was seated at the bar.  The waitress eagerly told me about the menu and answered my questions.  In the end, I asked her to \"surprise me\", and that she did:-)  Another waiter returned in good time with a piping hot bowl of Fire and Ice.  The bowl included ramen  noodles swimming in a seafood broth, top with pieces of grilled salmon and steamed vegetables.  It was beautiful, flavorful, and filling.  I was offered samples of ice cream; green tea, drizzled with honey, and \"Fruity Pebbles\", a pink, citrus flavored soft-serve, topped with fruity pebbles.  They were both delicious, and quite different from each other.    The wait staff was friendly and took time to suggest places to see in Charlotte and directions on how to get there.    Overall, a wonderful experience that I would recommend for a casual meal."}
{"text":"One of our favorite stops. Make sure to try the seasonal Ramen, always spot on. Always busy with a hip crowd. Take your out of town guests they will think you have your finger on the pulse"}
{"text":"My husband and I finally had the change to check out Futo Buta this past weekend for a date night! We took an Uber, so we didn't have to deal with driving. Since Futo Buta is right on the Light Rail, there isn't a lot of parking right beside it (basically street parking). We arrived around 6 and there wasn't a wait (however, when we left, there definitely was people waiting outside). The space is fairly small but cutely (is that a word??) set up. They have a very long high top table as well.  We started with the Saki flight, as we don't drink Saki a lot and thought this was a great way to taste a few. The flight was neat because they brought out little information cards on each of the sakes that came in the flight. Awesome idea if you don't know what to drink off the bat!  We started with the pork belly buns and the rice crispy tuna. The buns were tasty and traditional soft dough buns. Two came with the appetizer and they were nice sized with a decent piece of pork belly inside. The Rice Crispy Tuna was so delish!!! I loved that some assembly was required, as it made it a bit more fun. The crispy rice was something I have never had before and so different. The tuna was super flavorful. We decided to split the Fire and Ice as a main. The mint and salmon combined so well in this delish. Definitely a winner!  Can't wait to come back and try some of their sushi!"}
{"text":"This place is superb.  Go there.  The buns are great, the Ramen is excellent.  This restaurant is very different then Charlotte's typical offerings and I hope it thrives for a long, long time."}
{"text":"Probably one of my favorite little places. The rice crispies are amazing and their Miso (hungry) ramen bowl are by far my favorite on the menu. Daily soft serves are RIDICULOUSLY amazing; get out of your comfort zone and try whatever their daily flavor is, they won't disappoint! Service is very good and food usually comes out pretty fast. Will never get tired of this place!"}
{"text":"Place was great! Not familiar with traditional ramen, but loved the flavors ! Noodles you could tell are homemade. Broth was flavorful and just the perfect amount of broth inside for me. Pork belly inside my ramen was tender and delicious! They have Japanese beers like Asahi on tap which I love ! Can't wait to come back and the full menu!"}
{"text":"Amazing variety and delicious food. Great place to take guests!"}
{"text":"I had a chance to stop by this place for a late lunch. I felt in love with the simplicity decoration of this place. I had pork bun for appetizer. It was phenomenon!! The pork was flavorful and so tender and juicy that the fat is melting in your mouth while you're eating it. A+ for the bun. I also ordered miso ramen and added spicy pork into it. The taste of miso was very light. My friends had fire and ice ramen and the signature one that I can't remember the name right now. All the broths are flavorful and distinct from each other. Only down side is, I'm not sure if I was full from the appetizer or there was too much ramen. I couldn't finish it. Overall this place is great ! Everyone should come check them out!"}
{"text":"Futo Buta was a hard place to find. We almost gave up, but thanks to the tip of a yelp review, we parked at the garage of one the apartment complexes. The restaurant was right around the corner.  On to the food... I ordered their Miso Ramen. The broth was good and so was the pork belly. I thought that ramen and bbq flavored pork belly was an odd pairing though. The egg was also slightly undercooked for my liking. The texture of the noodles was a little off for me as well - maybe too much egg? I couldn't quite pinpoint what it was. Overall, a good bowl of ramen and deceptively filling. I thought the bowl was small, but there was a decent portion of ramen noodles in my bowl. My kids loved their Little Noodle Ramen. My pickiest eater kept coming back for more broth.  My favorite dish of the night was their pork belly buns. Surprising, since I usually don't like pork belly. The flavors were spot on. Bummed that I had to share with my husband. Next time, I'll order my own. My kids also enjoyed their Japanese Fried Chicken appetizer.  I'm a fan of all things green tea, so I ordered their green tea soft-serve ice cream for dessert. They topped it with some honey, and it was delicious! I would come back just for that.  Their ramen was far from the best I've ever had, but I still enjoyed my meal."}
{"text":"Good food but it is more expensive than I was expecting given the type of ingredients used. Great location, very limited beer selection for those of us that are used to large selections at most places in SouthEnd, nice ambience, relaxing outdoor area and friendly staff."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing! The restaurant was packed and everything still came out quickly. We tried several appetizers and different ramen bowls and we weren't disappointed with anything. Our server Sophia was also so attentive and knowledgable about the menu. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Good ramen place in a great location. It was busy on a Friday night. The staff was friendly but a little overwhelmed. Prices were fair and the food was good. I would definitely come back"}
{"text":"Really yummy ramen noodles, with the extra spices that are irresistible! However the place has been smelling a bit funky lately and hope it's just becuase of all the raw seafood they handle...nevertheless I'm a fan!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere and location are perfect.. The food presentation is incredible.. The taste, ehh.. underwhelming. The tonkotsu ramen broth was not very flavorful at all. It needed some salt, for sure! The pork buns were okay, the sushi roll was just mediocre and the crispy rice squares were the most seasoned item we ordered, the sushi rice is fried in squares and served with a spicy tuna poke on the side, that you dip in a wasabi soy dipping sauce.  The prices here are high for the portion size. The only thing worth the hype here at Futo Buta is their soft serve ice cream! Green Tea with honey drizzled on top! Wooo! We also had the strawberry basil flavor but it was just... Meh. It's $5 for a TINY cup of ice cream, $14 for a bowl of ramen, $10 for two pork belly buns, and $12 for the rice squares"}
{"text":"Top down, one of the best places I've ever been. Great food. Great sake. Great recommendations. Wow. Just wow."}
{"text":"Hard to get to, wait is crazy, but the food was very good. Tables are very close together.   We tried the tuna tartar and a miso noodle. Both were excellent. The owner is the chef and you can see he takes pride in his work. Definitely be back, but on a night that the outdoor wait is in better weather."}
{"text":"Had a tonkotsu ramen at the restaurant it was way too salty there was little broth, I don't consider it ramen but some kind of noddle dish.  I would prefer my ramen the traditional way."}
{"text":"I'd give this place 2.5 stars if I could. I really wanted it to be good but it's way overhyped and average. Was it bad? No, the food was edible, but I can also make edible food and I'm not the that good of a cook. It just wasn't good enough to where I'd come back again.  I paid $14 for a bowl of tonkotsu ramen that was average tasting at best and it didn't even really fill me up, but aesthetically it looked good. I'm not sure why other reviews said the broth is packed with flavor, but the broth I had was pretty bland (I've had packaged ramen that had more taste to it, granted it's probably filled with MSG). The ramen had like 2-3 thin slices of pork belly in it plus one egg. It's not worth the $14, you're paying to eat at a nice location basically. Way overpriced if you ask me.  The ambiance/décor was nice and the staff was very friendly and knowledgable, and that's really the only way they earned a 2.5 stars from me."}
{"text":"I've heard that this was the best ramen shop so decided to give a try today. I ordered the pork dumplings and it was pretty good. I had the fire and ice ramen. It was okay, but not as good as I expected it to be. The broth was very gamy and salty as well. My boyfriend order the miso ramen and his was saltier than mine. Not going to lie, was pretty disappointed. But glad I got to try it out."}
{"text":"Best restaurant in Charlotte.  No questions.   Get the Tonkontsu, extra pork belly!"}
{"text":"Came here because my sister told me that this place was to die for and I wanted to know what the hype was all about. But when I got here I was very disappointed...    I mean, I am no Ramen expert but I did not enjoy my meal at all...the broths were very bland & I think that the only good part to the Ramen was the pork belly and the egg.  I wish that I didn't  have to spend $14 on a bowl of Ramen that I did not enjoy... I could've made instant Ramen at home and I would have enjoyed it more...   On the other hand the pork buns were pretty good, I probably would only go there for the appetizers if i was hungry in the area.... just my opinion"}
{"text":"Futo Buta doesn't take reservations, so expect a short wait if you have a larger party in the evenings (even on the weekdays, it seems).  My colleagues and I (group of 5) waited around 15 minutes for a table on a Wednesday evening and eventually decided to squish into a 4-person table rather than have to sit at the bar... awkward for conversation.  If you're lost, Futo Buta is located on the corner on the light rail side, making it easily accessible off the Bland light rail stop.  Atmosphere is similar to an izakaya, if you've ever been to one.  Very casual and semi-loud.   For a ramen joint in Charlotte, I wasn't expecting much.  Reigning from NYC, I've had my share of decent ramen.  I was surprised that the ramen at Futo Buta is actually not bad at all - I prefer my places in NYC, but this will do while I'm traveling.  I ordered the tonkotsu ramen and added the chili to make it spicy (extra $1) - spicy it was.  I order the same thing at every ramen place, thus being able to make somewhat of a comparison among the different ramens I've had.  They serve the curly kind of ramen noodles here, versus the thinner kind, which I prefer.  Regardless, the pork bone broth was flavorful and the spicy sauce added a huge kick - warning for those that might not like that high of a spice level.  I was really impressed with the pork (char siu) here - it was just the right amount of fat-to-meat ratio and was marinated really well in a semi-sweet sauce and charred to perfect.  Probably some of the best meat I've had in ramen, actually!  The ramen here also comes with a poached egg.  At $14, the amount of food you get is reasonable.  In addition to the ramen, I also ordered the uni (sea urchin) nigiri (2 pieces, $7).  The uni was decently fresh (I haven't gotten sick) and I actually enjoyed this as an appetizer.  The salted radish was crunchy and refreshing.  I think this was supposed to come with some watermelon of some sort, but I don't recall seeing it.  Service is decent.  Worth a shot if you're in the area.  I don't know if there's any other comparable restaurants that serve ramen nearby."}
{"text":"Amazing. I love the pork buns and pretty much all of the appetizers. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Ready for an adventure?!   My sister chose this place for her birthday and boy this place is hard to find. Go into a sketchy parking deck, walk a tiny sidewalk and then boom there's Futo Buta next to the Lightrail.   FOOD: Gyoza and pork buns for apps were spectacular. The Tonkatsu and Shoyu ramen are amazing for spicy lovers (they even give you housemade chili oil, sriracha and chile powder for added spice) as is the vegan option (me and my mother's favorite). Their outdoor seating is the best, as I'm not a fan on communal dining.   SERVICE: Our waitress was sweet, conversational and quick. She was quick to refill our water glasses and take care of us. The wait was a bit excessive for our main courses but this place was slammed. With that in mind, the food was outstanding.  Great atmosphere and outstanding Japanese fusion food. This place is a hidden gem in Charlotte."}
{"text":"I've been anticipating this spot for a few months now. Ever since I snagged a glimpse of it while it was being built-out during a stroll on the light rail path I've been patiently awaiting some delicious noodles.  I usually wait at least until my second visit before rating a new joint but I couldn't help it here. It's great to see a genuine ramen place in Charlotte and this place offers everything I would have hoped for. The venue itself, although struggling a bit on the parking front, it is in a great location. Anyone living in South End of course doesn't have an issue as this place is pretty much walkable from anywhere in the neighborhood. It was raining the day I checked it out so we headed inside and grabbed a table for two. The seats are spaced very closely to other parties but I've actually seen this in a lot of Japanese restaurants in Japan so for me, only made it a more authentic experience.  Given that it was my first visit, I opted for the classic tonkotsu ramen to get a good sense of the \"basics\". However, I was very tempted by the Fire and Ice on the menu which the waitress did mention was one of the more popular dishes - there's always next time.  The tonkotsu was really very good. To be fair I haven't had authentic ramen in a while but from what I do remember of it, this was right on par...or better than what I've had in the past.  On my next visit the Fire and Ice and gyoza are both on the short list of what needs to get eaten. I'm certain that the bottom of the ramen bowls here haven't seen the last of me!"}
{"text":"We got here right when it opened (Sunday) for lunch and had no problem finding seating, but within 15 minutes it filled up completely. Ordered tonkotsu and miso ramen and got served pretty quickly. Overall, impressive ingredient selection all around (different veggies, mushrooms/fungi) and their pork is really, really good. However their broth in both the ramen bowls we got were noticeably salty (slight turn-off). Would come back to try the other options, was definitely an above-average ramen place"}
{"text":"Perfect location by the light rail. really fun trendy place. Their Brussel sprouts are to die for and so are their fried rice cakes. Heaaaaaaven."}
{"text":"The food is spectacular! I had the miso with beef chili and eggplant buns. Both were fantastic and I had no idea ramen could be so good. I will definitely be coming back with lots of friends.  The atmosphere is adorable too. Specials are drawn on large rolls of brown paper that give this an industrial feel. It's a little bit hard to find because you have to walk past the bland street light rail station toward the middle of the block but its so worth it!! Great date night or ladies night out."}
{"text":"I've been looking for a legit ramen place since I've moved to town. This is it!  The pork bowl was amazing. Broth was strong. Generous portions of pork. Will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Went back the other day after hearing people say that they have improved in their ramen flavors. I'm sorry to say but you can not call that improvement...we had the fire and ice and the tonkotu and same thing as I reviewed before. Tonkotu is so salty but yet NO flavor. (How does this happen?!) and fire and ice is just blah. I really truly don't understand the raving reviews of this place... These people must have never had real ramen before...sorry to say but it's by far the worst ramen I've ever had. I'd much rather eat instant ramen at home then eating this."}
{"text":"My company recently moved our offices from the Southpark Area to South End.  I've been busy trying out some of the food choices for lunch.  Today I decided to stop in to Futo Buta as it is directly behind our offices.  Upon entering I was greeted immediately by the nice and friendly staff.  I sat at the bar since I was by myself.  My server, Kyle, helped me through the menu and described various choices.  Ultimately I decided on an order of the Buns (one pork, one duck) and a specialized version of the Raman affectionately known as \"The Bowl Kyle tells everyone to get\".  Basically it's one of the menu bowls with added spicey pork sausage.  The buns were nothing short of delicious.  Remember to move each to the separate plate or the juices will mix.  Not necessarily ruining anything but at least tainting the original taste profile.  As a side note, I visited the rest rooms and the art was very entertaining, you have to check it out for yourself.  The main course was flavorful and very fulfilling.  On Kyle's recommendation I added some of the side dish of sausage into the broth and it began to heat it up.  If I were to order again I'd put about half the sausage in as by the time I was towards the end of the bowl it was VERY spicey.  About my only issue was the price.  For lunch it was quite expensive but I did order 2 dishes.  Perhaps when I go back I would only choose one or the other but they were both so good and I was so satisfied I don't mind spending the money that I did.  I will be back and bring friends."}
{"text":"Had to try this place out after hearing the praises of many friends. I have admittedly never had traditional ramen previously so I have nothing to compare. This place will make your mouth water.   Huge bowls of rich broth and savory meats and veggies combine for a definite wow factor. A sake flight is another highlight.   Yes it is pricey for a \"bowl of soup\" but this is so much more."}
{"text":"One of my friends had a hair in her ramen. A short black hair about 2 inches long (way darker than our hair so it certainly wasn't from us). She wasn't hungry anymore but I kept eating. Nearly to the bottom of my bowl and I found the same kind of black hair. I asked for a manager and he said \"that things like this happen\" . As someone who has worked in the service industry for 10 years, I couldn't believe those words were said. Yes, these things happen but twice?! Are they even wearing hair nets in the kitchen? Then he said he was sorry, and offered an ice cream. I turned down the ice cream.  I'm not squeamish but I left there very uncomfortable. I was even more uncomfortable that nothing was done for us other than offering ice cream. Is it unreasonable to think that after finding hair in two dishes, we'd get at least one dish taken care of... Particularly, the bowl that had three bites taken? I won't be back."}
{"text":"Great ramen to complement a great business lunch meeting! So deceiving--was delicious and quite filling. Was a perfect afternoon to eat outside on the patio"}
{"text":"After receiving a suggestion to come here, my mom and I did for lunch. We loved it! By far the best Brussels sprouts we ever had. And our ramen bowls were delicious! It was perfect for an extremely cold day in Charlotte. I just moved to the area and I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I used to live in Japan and have been dying to find a good ramen bar here...this one is amazing!!! Highly recommend getting the spicy ground pork in the ramen...delicious!"}
{"text":"Tastes that will awaken your senses. This is our second time visiting (the first time, we ordered delish ramen bowls). We are going back again next time to try more menu items!"}
{"text":"Never had a bad dish here! This place has nailed down every thing that they serve from apps to desserts. I usually sick with either the brussels sprouts dressed in a soy and teriyaki sauce or rice squares with ahi tuna to start. If you're not a fan of sprouts.. you'll be in love after you try their's! As for the ramen, I've tried the miso with pork and the vegan with tofu. Both pack so much flavor into a huge bowl of homemade noodles! You even have the option to add spicey pork (which is SPICEY) or add in your own spice with the sauces they bring to the table. They change the ice cream flavors daily but they've always been on point! Definitely need to try one when you go! The place can get pricey but the location is beautiful on the lite rail line with a great view of Uptown and AMAZING food!"}
{"text":"The food was amazing, loved the vibe of the patio area, however we had to wait a ridiculously long time for our appetizer. We were a two top that was greeted at the same time as the five top beside us was being sat. We ordered our app (tuna tartar with flash fried rice) at the first greet. The table beside us got bar drinks and their entrees way before we got our appetizer. When it finally came out it was great, but our ramen came out while we were taking our first bites. We had an overcrowded table, ramen getting cold, and were just ready to leave at that point.  We basically just packed the ramen and went home. I totally understand that these things happen but nothing was offered to remedy the situation, server did not seem to pick up the fact that we weren't happy, no manager ever came by the table to see how things were going.  Overall service was just lacking."}
{"text":"I have been several times in the past year and have yet to have a bad experience other than slower than normal service. We tried the fire and ice with the kimchi in it and it was ok but our absolute favorite is the Miso Hungry bowl of ramen. You cannot go wrong with this bowl! It comes with Pork Belly (that is the best smoked pork belly I have ever had!), sweet corn, soft boiled egg, bok choy and the flavorful broth. We like spicy and always add the seasoning and the hot sauce as well as the chili oil. We went there last night and I am pretty sure this the best ramen Charlotte had to offer right now. We did try the duck confit and pickled carrots bun and it was good but not our favorite. The duck was not bursting with the sweet flavor confit usually has. If you are going to Futo Buta and have not been you need to start with Miso Hungry. Prices are fair and it is never bad."}
{"text":"Wow!  This place is an amazing restaurant!  Everything was delicious.  I don't like pork but wanted to try their popular ramens.  This was unlike any other pork I've ever had.  It was delicious."}
{"text":"I really like this place. I've been here a few times. Typically everything is pretty good, last time we were there tough the service was not as good nor was the food. I'm hoping it was just an off night, I'll definitely try it again to make sure :) We really like the pork buns and the rice crispy tuna."}
{"text":"Overrated in my opinion... the food was good, but not slap your momma good tasting food. Maybe, I'll try a different dish next time."}
{"text":"Love the fire and ice ramen, and the crispy rice squares are delicious!  This is one of my favorite restaurants in the South End."}
{"text":"Food was great! Location and ambiance is trendy. Sushi and ramen are delicous."}
{"text":"Always add the spicy pork to any ramen. Even if you don't, still a delicious meal!! My favorite place in Charlotte, every time I go I find another reason why I love that place."}
{"text":"Excellent and trendy Ramen Shop. Service for such a small space was great. Food was timely and drink selections were great. Sit outside on the patio at dusk for an even better experience! The Rice Crispy squares with Tuna were a standout of the appetizers. The traditional frozen beer foam Sapporo draft was my favorite drink."}
{"text":"We were here when it first opened. We were disappointed and did not return... Until now.  We are SO glad we did! There's a much larger menu and portions bigger than you can eat. Unusual ingredients create flavor parties for your mouth. If you are a ramen fan, don't miss this!"}
{"text":"My husband and I came on a friday night around 7. It was packed and the set up of the restaurant is a little odd. Mostly bar type seating or a community table. It is very small, I wouldn't go with more than 3-4 people.  We got drinks while we waited and I got a strawberry cocktail they had, it was good, but I'm not a sake fan so I didn't love it.  We ordered the Gyoza - it was amazing. Then we got the low country pork belly buns, oh my gosh these were amazing! and then we ordered the miso ramen and the shoe ramen. If you like your ramen spicy add the chili sauce, it's very hot but VERY good. We both agreed that it's been a long time since we went out and everything we ordered was phenomenal and not just good. This is definitely our new favorite place, some of the best food I've had in charlotte"}
{"text":"This place is tops for Ramen in Charlotte.  On the expensive side but worth it if you're in the mood for what I call \"fancy Ramen\"  Cool decor, small place.  Hard to figure out where to park.  I recommend the Tonkatsu and the Hot Buns!"}
{"text":"There are some good dishes here, but it doesn't cook ramen broth like a real ramen place should. I've tried the shoyu, tonkatsu, and fire&ice.. and the ingredients and overall flavor are pretty good, but the broth (esp. tonkatsu) is not authentic. They don't cook the ramen stock for the necessary amount of time, but instead seem to just put it together on the fly. The fire & ice is pretty good.. but is it really ramen? Most people in Charlotte don't seem to know what real ramen is..   Yama Izakaya in Plaza Midwood has legit tonkatsu ramen broth."}
{"text":"you don't need to read 400+ reviews.  it's delicious.  now go eat ramen!"}
{"text":"Futo buta has the best Brussels sprouts in Charlotte hands down! The food is always outstanding and it's perfect on cold winter nights. I wish they would leave the outdoor patio open with heaters so there wouldn't always be such a long wait."}
{"text":"Always on point, always fresh. I always want to order everything on the menu. Really creative and different sushi rolls every time I go in. Do your mouth a favor and go in, multiple times so you can try everything."}
{"text":"I was so disappointed bc i was very excited after reading all the review before I came here. My fd and I ordered a miso and tonkatsu to shared. The miso was OK but the tonkatsu was not great, it has a weird taste....the environment was great tho."}
{"text":"Being honest, I do not like the food here! The first time I went was like two years ago. I got the tonkotsu. It was really oily, salty, and a lot of weird stuff in it that didn't make the dish taste any better. I thought it was just me but I let my friends taste it and they also agreed. I went to Yama because one of my friends suggested it to me when I told her about the oily and salty tonkotsu I got at Futo Buto. And I love Yama's tonkotsu! So this summer I decided to go back to futo buto and give it another try. TBH I should not have gone back. I will probably never go back. So if anyone like tonkotsu and do not like it from futo buto, I highly recommend going to Yama. But I gave them three stars because serves is great and the appetizers are great!"}
{"text":"AMAZING!! The only way I can describe it; ambiance is perfect but the Ramen and custom soft serve is unbelievable."}
{"text":"If you're looking for good ramen in the city this is the place to go. Had the fire and ice, shoyu bowl (ask for spicy sauce) and the spicy ramen bowl also the pork buns. Everything was incredible.   I'm updating my review due to the terrible and rude service we received today and our food was cold. I've been 6 times and love the food but today was actually pretty awful.   The girls name was Chey? Pronounced \"shy\" ...not sure who would hire someone like that. Was snarky and raising her voice in front of other customers. Extremely rude. Everything was disorganized from the kitchen to staff but everyone has bad days and I completely understand but this girl should not be serving customers.   I was also over charged for things I did not purchase."}
{"text":"The fried brussel sprouts are to die for! The fire and ice ramen is really tasty too. It came with a good seasoned broth (not very spicy, but you are provided with siracha etc. to season to your taste), a piece of hot smoked salmon, and some veggies (they could up the amount a bit in my opinion). This is Japanese food slightly altered for American taste. Nevertheless, it's authentic enough to get a good flavour of Japanese ramen. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Amazing unique restaurant, located right next to the light rail system. Love the variety of amazing foods and great customer service. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"We had a group of 8 and had a wonderful dinner. We all got ramen dishes- fire and ice and miso were the favorites. The one thing that was really strange was that the hostess came to our table when we sat down and said \"Please be aware that there is a Group of 10 behind you\" it was very strange we didn't know what she meant so we asked. She said don't take your time eating. We were all very annoyed by the comment- we felt like we had to rush to eat and as soon as we were done, we paid the check and left. Great food but definitely need to improve the customer service and experience"}
{"text":"I'm a fan of Futo Buta since they just opened. I love everything on their menu. I usually get the Tori Kara age, spicy tuna donburi, Blue fin taro tartare, Buta bowl, and the soft serve for dessert. The Chicken tori Kara age is well cooked and seasoned. They are crispy and tasty even without the mayo dipping. I love the thin and delicate taro chip topped with the blue fin tartare. The Buta ramen is perfectly cooked and the broth is deeply flavored. Mostly, one can only find the soft serve ice cream Japanese style here. I love all their seasonal flavor of soft serve"}
{"text":"Fabulous Asian food! The Izakaya menu is my favorite with small and plates. The crispy rice squares are incredibly delicious with rice, spicy tuna and special sauce. I could have made the meal of it! The pork belly buns were delicious and fluffy with savory meat.  We shared the miso hungry ramen bowl with spicy pork. I liked the broth and pork and the sauce was very spicy. I liked the flavor and the food and I can't wait to try the rest of the menu. There are no reservations so prepare to wait. We waited 35 minutes. The outside patio is an option but they only had one server so they made us sit inside."}
{"text":"I will start this off by saying I am not really a fan of ramen noodles. I pretty much feel like I can just make ramen at home, throw some chicken in it, and it would be FINE.  I don't think I'd be able to replicate Futo Buta's ramen very easily!   My girlfriend was feeling ramen on a Sunday and after scanning Yelp, she narrowed down her search to Futo Buta. We placed an order to pick up and got there quickly. We are new around the area so it took us a few minutes to find the place, but took no time at all once we were in!  We brought our respective ramen bowls and our Japanese friend chicken home and dug in. The chicken tasted GREAT. It had lost a lot of crunchiness due to the 15 minute ride back home but that's to be expected. I can imagine when fresh, the chicken is incredible. The sauce served with the JFC was SO good.  I ordered the seasonal ramen that came with vinegar ginger soy, smoke porked belly, leek, scallion, serrano, spicy ground pork, bamboo, wakame, ginger, onsen egg, and I added bok choy. A little vat of broth also came with it that was delicious. It wasn't a ton of broth, but enough to coat all the ingredients and noodles which I prefer as opposed to a more soupy ramen.   My girlfriend got the Tonkotsu ramen which was more on the soupy ramen side and was very earthy I guess due to the mushrooms, but that was pretty good too.  As I mentioned, I'm not the biggest ramen fan, but the next time I get a craving I'll definitely be going back to Futo Buta."}
{"text":"NOT GOOD RAMEN.  Just go to Yuma Izakaya on Plaza Midwood (12 minutes away from this place).  Spent $80 on 4 bowls & 1 appetizer.  The broth was NOT good.  The miso broth was baddddddd (way too salty).  Waited 1 hour & 30 minutes to be seated.  30 minutes for our food to come out.  I had such high hope but I was soooooo disappointed."}
{"text":"It's average. Sat at the bar and watched back of the house prepare my ramen with no gloves on. Also found a eyelash/eyebrow hair in the slaw of my pork belly buns. We told one of the servers and she inspected for. The server told the back of the house and the cook also inspected for it."}
{"text":"Soooo...Im trying to find the words to explain exactly how dope this little gem of a restaurant is.  Futo Buto brings authentic, flavorful bowls of deliciousness unlike any ever seen before in the city of Charlotte.  Let's start at the beggining.  Izakaya are, for lack of a better term, appetizers or small bites.  I always start out with Kurobuta Pork & Scallop Gyoza.  They are the best dumplings I have ever had.  Kurobuta pork is basically the Wagyu of the pork world.  Phenomenal quality meat and they are sticking it in traditional gyozas with scallops.  Insanely delicious.  I am also a huge fan of the fried brussel sprouts...never thought I'd say that in my life.  The pork belly buns are incredible as well and always round out my meal.  Ramen- First of all, the broths are truly remarkable.  A lot of love and time has to be put into building the layers of flavor that penetrate deep into my soul with every slurp.  They use alkaline noodles so the noodles never get mushy.  My favorite is the Buta Bowl.  It comes with smoked pork belly and duck confit, double noodles, corn scallions, chilli sauce and egg.  It is spicy and deep.  May be the best meal in Charlotte.  I love love love this place."}
{"text":"We have been regulars of Futo Buta since it opened, but we typically stick to the \"cooked\" stuff. Brussels sprouts, Baos, Ramen, all excellent.  This past weekend we stuck exclusively to the Raw menu and were blown away. Uni, Salmon Belly, Toro...completely mindblowing, both in flavor and presentation. We hadn't had excellent \"top tier\" sushi varieties here in Charlotte until now.  Futo Buta...NOT JUST RAMEN! Bravo!"}
{"text":"RAMAN. Came for the raman bowls. They were great! The appetizers were great at well. My girlfriend got a Niwa raman bowl and we both did not like hers. It had nothing to do with the veggies, it was just a little bit tasteless."}
{"text":"Not your dorm room ramen.  Futo Buta (Japanese for Fat Pig) is a unique but somewhat hard to find little place that you will want to go searching for.     Definitely sit outside if a table is open. It's a great atmosphere and inside is mostly backless stools and can be a little loud.  Be sure you check out the funky bathrooms.   Get a couple appetizers for the table to start.   We had the pulled pork buns and the duck confet buns which were so fresh and outstandingly flavorful.   Our table also split the \"rice crispy treats\" which are small blocks on deep fried sticky rice served with a soy ginger sauce to dip and fresh raw tuna to top it with,  really fascistic.   The ramen is of course the showcase and there is something for every taste from the simple noodles in a chicken broth to the giant Buddha bowl that is a mixture of every protein and noodles.   Also check out the seasonal cold noodles as well,  they're a nice change.   They lost a star from me simply because the menu is pretty limited so if you have a picky eater in your group they might be a little challenged.   But,  then again,  ramen is pretty universal so they should be ok."}
{"text":"This place has pretty good ramen but it is tough to get it. The restaurant barely seats 20 people. They also don't answer the phone so you won't be able to order anything to go."}
{"text":"Amazing. Stunning food and exceptional service. Go early there will be a wait! Tuna Rice Crispies, Tonkatsu Ramen, sushi, crispy brussels, nigiri, EVERYTHING is off the chain good. The Ramen is the best I've ever had and I crave it constantly."}
{"text":"Great Miso & fresh Spicy Tuna!!"}
{"text":"Excellent ramen with a nice atmosphere! The ramen here was delicious. It comes with pork belly that is also delicious. The portions are large and it is around $12 for a bowl. This place also serves ice cream, but I didn't try it on the day I went."}
{"text":"Excellent food! The Fire and Ice ramen bowl is my favorite, with delicious spices and yummy salmon. I've been here quite a few times, and it never disappoints. The only cons are the small venue and long wait."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant. I had never had traditional-style ramen before coming here, and was a little wary of what I considered to be noodles in water, but this place blew my mind. The noodles are in themselves delicious, and the broth is not regular broth that you think of, but an extremely flavorful, perfectly spiced addition to the noodles, meat, and vegetables it contains. The restaurant is normally pretty busy, so I would recommend getting there a little earlier than you're ready to eat. They generally sit people pretty quickly though! I recommend trying the Fire and Ice for your first time, and definitely splurging on the green tea soft serve ice cream as an extra treat after dinner!"}
{"text":"Absolute favorite ramen house, hands down.  I always go for the Buta Bowl, I can't get enough.  Also a huge fan of the Fried Brussel Sprouts and the Tori Kara Age.  Wish they were open on Mondays and I also wish they would open a Columbia, SC location! My life would be complete."}
{"text":"I'm biased because this is literally 500 feet from my apartment, but the food is excellent and the staff are super friendly. Their patio is usually packed as is the restaurant, so be prepared to wait, but it's worth it."}
{"text":"I gave this place 4 out of 5 for the presentation of the food and the friendliness of the wait staffs. Tonkatsu bowl was carefully decorated, a piece of seaweed was nicely placed inside, along with red ginger, sesame, a full egg, and two slices of pork belly that would just melt as soon as it touches your mouth. However, with each slurp, I gradually to notice the imperfection.  The portion was small, egg wasn't fully cooked (personal preference), the ginger didn't offset the sweetness of the broth as expected, instead it stood out. The noodles were self made I believe they were the better ones I've had. We also ordered the eggplant buns, which was awesome, it was tasty but can't imagine myself enjoying it more with the second one. The green tea softy was great, with a touch of honey on the top, it wasn't over the top sweet and enjoyed it. The hoppy beer I had was something ends with \"robot\", it was good, reminded me of Magic Hat (forgot the number) immediately. The wait staffs might have been students who study nearby were super nice to us, extra accommodating being we had a baby :) thank you.  I still strongly recommend this place. I am spoiled being from Jersey/NY :)"}
{"text":"Amazing Place Great Atmosphere And Excellent Ramen ! And Drinks ! I Love Going To This Spot When I'm In Charlotte."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant for the first time this weekend. Saturday April 2nd. The location is in a nice space that gets lots of natural lighting. The service was friendly, and warm. I ordered the Duck Confit buns, and a Salmon Ramen. Everything I tasted was delicious, and the portion sizes were great.   Next time I visit Charlotte I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Amazing service from the staff, and delicious food. I had a miso soup for my entree, the ingredients were fresh and the soup hearty. The gozya was a grat appetizer which went great with their cocktails. A cute place and worth every penny. You will most definitely leave happy and with warm soup belly."}
{"text":"We had the miso ramen, Brussels sprouts, and rice cakes with tuna. Every thing came out quickly and was delicious ! I could eat this ramen every meal. I highly recommend going. My friends got the miso ramen which was also good. My only recommendation is to add sriracha to the bowl for some extra flavor."}
{"text":"Favorite restaurant in Southend. I come back again and again for the ramen, the brussels sprouts, and the Rice Krispies. My only complaint is that the restaurant is small and the wait time can be long because it is so good everyone wants to eat there!"}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite ramen restaurant ever. The food is made fresh, everything I have had here tastes amazing and the atmosphere is fantastic. Make sure you check out the bathrooms Because they are also really fun!"}
{"text":"Went to Futo Buta a couple of nights ago and was very disappointed. My boyfriend and I ordered the Buta bowl and unfortunately, could not eat it because it was very salty. Our stomachs have been very upset after eating here that night. This place used to be so good but, I am not sure what has happened."}
{"text":"Def a good place to go for some soup during lunch time. Always fills you up ! Will definitely come here again ."}
{"text":"Okay, the place officially opens on 23-May-15, but I am already impressed by the \"soft open\" this week.  Finally a dedicated ramen place in Charlotte!  Tip: location is a little tricky, just remember to stick to the light rail side!"}
{"text":"Best ramen in Charlotte. Pork belly on point. Noodles have just the right amount of egg and great texture."}
{"text":"Every time I have been to Futo Buta it has been fantastic! I would say, it's the best ramen in Charlotte.   I have sampled a few of the appetizers. I would say the Brussel's sprouts and the crispy tuna squares are a must order. I wasn't impressed with the eggplant buns and wouldn't order again, but folks say the pork ones are tasty.   I've sampled a variety of ramen bowls and each time they have been good. But I keep going back for the vegan bowl (I add an egg). The broth is flavorful and there are a good variety of veggies and toppings.   It's kind of hard to find, your GPS will probably get confused. Just turn by the Crispy Crepe off South Blvd and it will dead end into a parking garage.   The interior is very small, so you usually have to wait, but I think it's worth it!"}
{"text":"Great spot located on the Charlotte Rail Trail. Nice outside patio to watch all of the people walking/running/biking the trail. Food is great but a tad salty. Take your rings off before you go. Lol."}
{"text":"Futo Buta is obviously still working out the kinks.  As Corey M pointed out, I think they're a little overpriced on the pork belly buns -- totally delicious, but should be $6 not $9.  Also, the day we went at lunchtime, with a fairly simple order -- pb buns, miso, and gyoza -- why it took 45 minutes with it not being that crowded was a downer to me.  Hopefully they'll get that part of the equation in order, and I'll be back"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed it.  Probably the best ramen place in Charlotte.    Also, a cool vibe with the best sake selection I've seen."}
{"text":"Futo Buta.. the fat pig. It's expensive, there's limited seating.. but somehow, I keep wanting to go back.  AMBIENCE Very limited seating, all wood-interior. Dimly lit. It's open seating (family style) but not family friendly. Don't be surprised if you're sitting right next to complete strangers.  If you have a large party, it's kind of inconvenient. I love the roll of paper they use to highlight their off-the menu menu as well as their beer specials. One TV... usually plays the big game of the night.   LOCATION South Boulevard off of Bland Street. Park in the apartment complex that it's part of. If you head towards the back of the parking lot, there are reserved spots for the restaurant.   FOOD  Pork Belly Buns. $10. Worth it. The pork belly is super tender but slightly crispy. The veggies on top offer a crunch and a much-needed vinegary element to cut the fattiness. Be forewarned... the buns.... there are only 2 of them. They are tiny.   Karaage Chicken. Worth it. The chicken is citrusy and comes with a spicy mayo sauce. The chicken is breaded very lightly.. Jonny described it as \"Japanese chicken nuggets\". The portions are small.   Miso Ramen. Worth it. The broth is delicious and thick. The noodles taste homemade. The slowly cooked egg is silky and adds to the overall earthiness of the dish. Add the local mushrooms... so worth it.   Tonkotsu Ramen. Sort of worth it. Very hearty. We preferred the miso ramen. Eat while it's hot... if you try to eat it slowly, the broth kind of \"coagulates\" and turns into a congealed mess.  Green tea soft serve. They don't always have it.. but if they do, get it."}
{"text":"Great Asian good. Good clean restaurant and great food for the price."}
{"text":"Great ramen (portions are not small!) and also rice bowls. Tuna rice bowl is spicy! This joint is a terrific location on the light rail - sort of hard to find if you drive. Trendy vibe, stellar service, great food. View of the city from the patio is excellent."}
{"text":"There aren't a lot of ramen restaurants worthy of a visit here in Charlotte, but this would be the best in Charlotte. It's a tab bit too salty, but I think that this is a \"Southern thing\" where everything is salty or sugary sweet, or both at the same time."}
{"text":"Delicious and so glad I stopped! They had outdoor seating and I enjoyed the food with a fantastic view of the downtown Charlotte skyline.   The food is fantastic! Obviously ramen is the star of the show here but they really delicious appetizer and sushi type offerings. Everything is fresh, seasoned well and served at the right temperatures. A sign of a kitchen and waitstaff that is on point.  The inside is on the smallish side and seating is limited so either get there early or call-ahead/place To-Go.  The outside seating is where it's at though as long as the weather is nice."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and attentive staff. The ramen was good. The pork belly was lacking in proportion to the size of the ramen bowl and the cost. I enjoyed the experience, however I will continue to explore Charlotte eateries before making a trip back."}
{"text":"Again on our quest to find the best Ramen my husband and I saw this place had opened recently and had to give it a try. (Again Nikki, your posts of Ramen are such a tease.) After parking and walking around, the place can be a bit tricky to find so don't get discouraged!, we found the front door!   We sat at the bar since the inside is quite small and it was a little warm outside. We were immediately greeted by our waiter and submitted our order. I got the Miso (hungry) and my husband got the Tonkatsu. It didn't take long for our orders to come out and we were super excited!   They only gave us chopsticks, and truth-be-told I am not a chopsticks master. At one point my husband laughed so loud that the waitstaff said the food must be very good for such a big smile. He ousted me, and they seemed to appreciate my effort, and promptly handed me a fork. Hey! I tried!   It was very good Ramen, once I was actually able to get a big bite. It had great flavor, which mine was very different from the place we frequently last. I would give this place a try if I was a Ramen fiend like we are.   Our bill was around $30ish after tip, but well worth it."}
{"text":"Futo Buta is to ramen what Charlotte is to authentic NY bagels or pastrami. When your best is just not good enough. Stopped in yesterday and ordered the smoked pork belly buns and Tonkotsu ramen. First, the pork belly rolls didn't have a spongy light texture, they were closer to a biscuit texture than a roll. The pork itself was nothing to write home about - most of the fat was rendered off causing it to be quite dry. The ramen is only as good as the broth that comprises its base. Futo's didn't have that silky unctuous flavor of a protein meat base, more like bone soup. The ramen noodles and mushrooms were the bright spots. David Chang - Charlotte needs you !"}
{"text":"Pork Belly Buns and Fire and Ice Ramen were freakin' amazing!! Unfortunately you only get 2 buns per order for 10 bucks...kinda pricey if you ask me. Fire and Ice Ramen was a good size, but there's only ONE size:( The place is obviously in a super trendy spot and extremely small so needless to say it was packed! We were told we'd have to wait 25 mins but we were seated after about 10 mins! You may end up with strangers at your table due to the limited seating.  By the way, the bar area is not first come first serve, you have to put your name on the waiting list for a stool. Have a look at the menu BEFORE you come in, the waitress was ready to take our order after like 3 mins of sitting down. My friends and I felt totally rushed. Fortunately the food made up for the rushed service and seat next to the restroom. I would return again but probably get it to go, or wait until the summer when the outdoor seating is available.   P. S. the music is terrible."}
{"text":"Smells so good in here! Staff is so kind and helpful. Thank you for the wonderful service! And the deeeelicious food!"}
{"text":"I have serious cravings for the brussel sprouts. Man, those are amazing. I've tried a few of the different types of ramen, but my favorite is the Tonkotsu with the added chili sauce. This place is a real treat!"}
{"text":"THIS place is amazing! I honestly know exactly why this place is on the 2018 50 Best Restaurants in Charlotte list. Seriously amazing food, amazing service and affordable but for delectable food unlike anything you can get elsewhere in CLT. Also it's usually packed so you may way a little bit unless you come at the right time but it's so worth it.  I could've easily skipped the apps since the ramen is huge but I had to try the rice crispy squares. They are so unique and so delicious. You need to try these things at least once in your life.  My friend and I both got the Tonkotsu. Let me just say...amazing. Those of you that equate ramen to the 25 cent  noodles you can score at any grocery or big box store, think again. This is some real ramen, which means more than just some seasoned broth and noodles. The broth itself is amazing. The onsen egg was killer and the pork belly brought in a ridiculously rich flavor to tie it all together. We both left with about half of a ramen to eat for lunch the next day aka midnight snack. Just try not to eat all the pork belly before leaving if you want some with your second half.  Great local beers on tap and excellent service. Casual laid back vibe and can get kinda loud but it's south end that's the way it should be."}
{"text":"The bar for Asian food of any kind in Charlotte is mind numbingly low; almost all of it is awful.   Futo Buta is one of a very, very small number of restaurants in CLT serving decent Asian food. Compared to any good ramen place in more established metropolitan areas, Futo Buta could not be mentioned in the same breath; however, in Charlotte, this is clearly one of your best options. We had the pork belly buns (2 for $10) which were very good but tiny for the price. Tonkatsu ramen ($14) and Shoyu ramen ($12) were semi-flavorful and easily the best in town. It's not that Futo Buta is so great; it's just that the rest of what Charlotte has to offer is so bad. However, here's hoping the bar is being raised for what constitutes acceptable Asian cuisine.  If any Asian-inclined chefs are looking for a market with little competition, Charlotte is still wide, wide open."}
{"text":"The food here is delicious, the space is tight. For a small place, they cram a lot of people in. Depending on the time of day, you're likely to wait for a while. But if you're willing, it is definitely worth it. My favorite dish is Miso Hungry + spicy ground pork. I suggest if you are with a group of people to get a few appetizers and share family style.   One of my favorite places in South End!"}
{"text":"After delaying for over a year to give this place a shot, my wife and I finally pulled the trigger. Part of the delay in trying this CLT hotspot was because of the ever-present consistently long line, and the other part was because I had the mentality of \"I don't want to pay $12-$14 for a bowl of soup\".   On Friday, it was chilly in the Queen City (a blamy 65 degrees, brr) so I decided soup sounded nice, so I walked on over to the Futo. It was as if the stars aligned for us, and there was NO WAIT... on a Friday ... at 8pm. I knew right then that this was a marvelous occasion.   In honor of the stars aligning, we opted for an appetizer to kick off our meal. We saw a lot of people ordering the Rice Crispy Squares (many people said they're amazing, so we're definitely trying them next go-round), but ended up with the steam buns. BONUS: they let you mix & match (2 for $10), so we got 1 duck confit & 1 smoked pork belly. Both delicious but, flavor wise, the pork belly was a clear winner with an awesome kick to it.   After perusing our handy Yelp app, it seemed like the overwhelming consensus was favored towards the 'Fire & Ice' bowl. Because we always 'split' meals in order to maximize our tasting abilities, I decided my next best option would be the Miso (Hungry) bowl. And because, meat ... I had to go with the recommendation of adding the spicy ground pork.   Both bowls came out to my surprise, my wife & I both said the Miso bowl was hands down the better bowl. So, much, flavor. Seriously, it was insane. I like it spicy, but not like \"ughhh\" spicy, and this was perfect. The waitress told me the spice all comes from that added pork, so do yourself a favor and make this your go-to bowl.   Long story long --- this place is a must try."}
{"text":"One of our favorite places to go when it's cold and rainy out.  Re-defines comfort food. And you have to try the Rice Crispy Squares. The best!"}
{"text":"Best ramen in town! You need to get here! I just came here for the first time about two weeks ago and have been three times since then, one of which was when I was sick because this ramen is good for the soul! and body! #heaveninmymouth #getinmybelly #thateggtho #gah"}
{"text":"The service is great and the menu is new for the area, but the food wasn't quite as good as I'd been led to believe. The prices seem to reflect more on the location than the ingredients. For instance two small pork buns were $10. The ramen had all kinds of good ingredients in it, but still managed to taste bland. The best thing we had was the fried Brussels sprouts. Overall I liked the place, just had higher expectations than was warranted."}
{"text":"We have been several times since they opened and have tasted every ramen dish on the menu between the two of us. They are all great.   My favorite is the Fire & Ice (kimchi broth), you can spice it up more too! The salmon is also great but if you don't feel in the mood for fishy broth, they will happily serve it with any other meat. My boyfriend likes the cheese bowl, be advised it is a heck of a lot of cheese!!! We like the miso and the shoyu and the pork broth too. Yes, this is all the bowls.  A great deal of effort is obviously put into each dish and it shows. Bowls are $12-14, but be advised the bill can rise very easily with the fantastic appetizers and excellent sake selection.   Excellent atmosphere. Very friendly servers. The bar style table is a bit odd, but eating at the (actual) bar is very pleasant and the outside seating is awesome. I wish the music had a little more variety though.  I love sake and decided to have a sake flight last time. It was an excellent experience and I'd highly recommend it. I was worried the quantity of booze would be low but you get about as much sake as you would if you split a bottle with someone, and to try many new things.   Charlotte gets a bad rap for authentic food. I haven't had ramen in Japan but I've had it several other places in the US including a 3 hour wait for the legendary Yume Wo Katare in Boston. Happy to say that Futo Buta definitely measures up in my opinion - different style but the experience is on the same level.  Parking: I see reviews here saying there is only street parking? This is not true, you can park in the lot next to them, just turn past Crispy Crepe on Rensslaer ave - it looks like it's for the apartment complex but the whole first floor is clearly labeled \"Retail\" parking and is obviously for the stores there."}
{"text":"Nice place! It's a small casual restaurant and we were lucky enough to snag a table on their patio on a beautiful spring day! The service was friendly and the food was overall very good. I will say that I am a LA ramen lover and I haven't been anywhere that is as good as my favorite LA ramen shop but Futo Buta definitely gives a good effort. I tried their typical pork broth ramen which I though was lacking in flavor but their Fire and Ice ramen was awesome!! There was salmon and spicy and the flavors were great. Absolutely recommend it. Also got pork belly buns to start which was really good but I thought was a bit expensive for what it was. Overall, good food if you choose well, nice ambience and character but would expect to wait."}
{"text":"I'm really curious if the owner chef seriously believes his ramen tastes good. If so, I don't have anything to say, because after all, this is his restaurant and he has every right to serve whatever he thinks right.  I just want to say that tonkotsu ramen tastes \"off\" as ramen. The soup is salty but just salty and has no flavor. Miso is a little better, because the taste of miso adds some flavor. Onsen tamago is not for ramen toppings, but for breakfast. Japanese don't eat raw bean sprouts.  They look like ramen, but they taste like totally different in a bad way. Like, it is cooked by someone who has seen ramen somewhere, but never tasted nor been trained and tries to recreate it from his memory. Frozen bag of tonkotsu ramen tastes way better as authentic ramen.  I gave it up with ramen and tried spicy tuna don. It was over priced for dried minced tuna with spicy sauce on top of cold sushi rice.   Ramen is not healthy food. It shouldn't be. It has to have full of sodium, full of lard."}
{"text":"This place was not on my radar until a friend suggested dinner. Although it's a small space and the wait was long, it was worth it. Thankful that most of the people in my party got the brussel sprouts appetizer to share, because they were delicious. Cooked perfectly and seasoned well. I ordered the Fire & Ice ramen...will definitely get it again, bit I won't wear a white shirt!  The bowl was filling and its contents disappeared quickly...highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Best ramen I've had, Futo Buta has become a weekly tradition"}
{"text":"This place......oh my God, this place! Okay, it's not a big space, and you should be prepared to both hear other people's conversations and have your conversation heard. It's cozy in a very authentically Japanese way (based on my limited experience anyway). Everything is awesome. I dream of their salmon belly nigiri at night. Actually thinking of it now, and knowing I can't get it at the moment is making me tear up a bit. It's velvety smooth salmon that's smoked lightly in- house using pecan wood smoke. Because it's gently smoked, it retains its moist fatty texture, rather than getting more stiff and solid. The smoke isn't overwhelming either, so the clean flavor of the salmon definitely shines through. The ramen is complex. This is as close to the real thing I've found since my last trip to Hokkaido. If you're a ramen beginner, I suggest asking to hold the onsen egg. It may be a texture that you're not prepared for yet, but if you're adventurous, get the egg and add the spicy pork!"}
{"text":"Not only is the ramen amazing, but their sides are a crowd pleaser. I have never been disappointed with their quality and taste! I love having this restaurant in charlotte. And the green tea ice cream is nostalgic! It's a total dream! A must get!!"}
{"text":"Hipster servers need to tone down attitude. Pricey menu designed to appeal to the SouthEnd crowd. Wish Futo Buta had a more traditional Ramen House Menu like Japan Town in San Francisco.  Hard to find restaurant. Food 4 star."}
{"text":"This. Is. The. Best. Ramen. In. Charlotte.   Awesome service. Awesome food. Awesome beer. Awesome dessert. EVERYTHING IS AWESOME!  Please open a second location! Preferably in Davidson or Huntersville so I don't have to drive so far for ramen when I have a hankering."}
{"text":"Omg.... Love this spot. Place is a little hidden off south blvd.  But omg is it worth it. Isnt the largest spot in town so expect or either get there early.  I used to live in charlotte, and this place just opened when i left.  But every trip up i stop by, and usually just get take out.  Buta bowl is my jam and the brussels are pretty freakin awesome too. Staff has always been friendly too This place also has a porch for outside seating, but get there early, this places usually fills up quickly which well is a good thing, cause to me that means the food is on point. Soooo good dood..."}
{"text":"So while we were quoted a 30 minute wait and it ended up being a little over an hour wait, it was still totally worth it. The space is small and always super busy from what I hear. We were seated at the bar and promptly ordered from an attentive server behind the counter. We started with the Toro nigiri, and I can still savor the taste after two days. Super fresh, didn't even need more than a drop of soy sauce. I tried the tonkatsu ramen, and the flavor is all there. So much umami! Bowl contained two slices of pork belly, egg, mushrooms, nori, and some black fungus. Ramen was bouncy, and broth was rich. Finished off with the green tea ice cream drizzled in honey. Really enjoyed the taste of green tea, but the ice cream itself had a little icy consistency for a soft serve. The honey really complemented the tea flavor though, so I'd get the dessert again any day, especially at the end of such a savory meal."}
{"text":"It was pretty good. Pork belly buns are delicious. Green tea ice cream with honey was great. Loved the spicy miso ramen. My waiter was very informative although he recommended I get the shoyu broth instead of the tonkotsu but I regretted the decision."}
{"text":"Too much fried food and ramen is not healthy. The staff was really friendly, but they can add more healthy options on the menus."}
{"text":"I'm a avid fan of Ramen, but this place is just a-ok to me.  I had the Tonkatsu, which was very rich in flavor, but very salty.  I love the hipster way they served the food, but sometimes I couldn't get passed the ladle for a spoon."}
{"text":"Ok soooo I can't believe I am writing a 5 star review about a cold ramen but here I am!!!!!! I absolutely loved the ramen I ordered but I'll go into that later. So my brother and I went there and he ordered the spiciest ramen while I ordered the cold ramen which was the seasonal special. I asked to make my ramen spicier since I love spicy stuff and i was not disappointed. My brothers ramen was a traditional hot ramen with several different meats all  the spicy ones they have. Mine did not have a broth really. It was a small amount of juice and i slurped that all away even though it was really spicy. I loved the pork belly it was juicy and tender.  The flavors were exceptional and were a total mouth full explosion.  Honestly I'm just looking for my next excuse to go back there. The service was great we sat at the bar and the young lady was super helpful and made a mean Tokyo mule"}
{"text":"AMAZING FOOD and DRINKS....Start with rice crispy squares. They will fill you up so be prepared. Next try the steamed pork buns. Pork was better than the duck but both were good. Next try the Brussel Sprouts. Next, the Japanese Fried chicken.....if you still have room then go for the Miso Raman. Drink menu will not disappoint. Everything was OUTSTANDING. Can't wait to go again"}
{"text":"We gave this place a try. It's super trendy but the ramen was delicious. The sizes are huge and the food is very good. It's the kind of food that tastes good in a rainy day or when you're feeling a bit chilled."}
{"text":"Plain and simple, the food at Futo Buta is fantastic.  It's a great mix of creative and authentic, and will absolutely fill you up.  The ramen is delicious and can be served spicy or not spicy, depending on your tastes.  The pork belly is fantastic.  Pork buns are really great, too.  On top of that, they have their own soft-serve, which I believe was ginger flavored when I first popped in! I didn't try it, but it sounded amazing.  The location is a bit tricky if you don't know where you're looking.  It's in the Post South End apartment building (the same one with Crepe Cellar and what used to be World of Beer), facing the light rail on the Bland Street Station, on the far corner of the building away from Bland Street.  My single, solitary complaint seems to be a common one - the place is just too expensive for lunch.  I totally understand that I'm paying for high quality food, but I wouldn't at all mind a pared down, cheaper lunch menu.   That would get me coming back more often.  (And if the chef wanted to start serving breakfast, I'd probably be there for that, too.  It's really good.)"}
{"text":"My review is solely based on appetizers. We were in and out in less than 45 minutes.   Futo Buta is a bit hidden from the street and I can imagine that if you don't live within walking distance that you might struggle finding parking. There were a ton of people waiting outside so we almost didn't go but once inside we learned that everyone was waiting to sit in their outside seating and not in the really small interior. The hostess sat us at the bar which I found a little strange but I guess with such limited seating they have to regulate.  We ordered brussel sprouts, tofu kebabs, and the japanese fried chicken. Everything was pretty tasty but the brussel sprouts were AMAZING!! Amazing to the point where we ordered more....amazing to the point where we noticed EVERYONE around us was ordering them. The japanese fried chicken was interestingly seasoned with a spicy sauce. It kind of reminded me of chicken nuggets and sauce...nothing to write home about.   The interior of this place was nice and cozy. I'd come back just for the brussel sprouts."}
{"text":"I tried this ramen place and I didn't like it.  I ordered Veg ramen and that was Ok OK.  We went with friends for dinner and we sat on patio.  This restaurant have strong smell which I was not comfortable with.  Ramen that I ordered was feel like I am having cup noodles.  This place can get two stars for their service and location."}
{"text":"Love this ramen spot! Definitely add the spicy ground pork to any of the ramen bowls and you will not be disappointed. Just a note for first-timers, because the restaurant is tiny, the seating is unique and shared at one long table (I think there are a couple small tables in the back), so you might sit with strangers! There is also seating at the bar, along the window (barstools), and a great patio!"}
{"text":"Good quality Ramen at expected prices. Parking close is tough -just know that it is right at the Bland street station. Look for tables and chairs on the patio. Google maps pinned it exactly.  We had the edamame, chicken appetizer (great sauce) and the $14 ramen. Broth could have had a more flavorful taste, but it was good and filling.  The people really set this place apart. Server and hostess were both very attentive and charming. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"It's a ramen/weeb/hipster mix. It's fine.  Situated at the corner of a street, the sign of the place only appears at the front door, but not on the side of the restaurant itself, so if it wasn't for the patrons sitting outside, I might've missed it.   Ordered the toro and the Miso ramen on my visit. The toro was cut fairly thin, which is fine for nigiri, and I get that toro is expensive as hell, but having just three pieces for $16 kind of hurt internally. Especially since I've paid less for more and better fish grade for toro before.  The ramen itself had a good full flavored broth with decent fixings on it. Personally could've done without the sprouts. But that's a personal preference.  It was an okay experience."}
{"text":"WAY WAY WAY overhyped, this is probably the worst ramen bowl I've ever had. I'd rather pay $2 for an instant cup noodle that has more flavor. I ordered the tonkatsu ramen and the broth was just salty and fatty with NO FLAVOR. After one sip of the soup I honestly couldn't drink any more of it because it was beyond disappointment, especially after some of the other reviews said it was rated one of Charlotte's top 50 restaurants and all the other hot raving reviews. Trust me if this opened in California it'd be out of business. People who says this reminds them of Japan, have you really tried ramen in Japan?!?"}
{"text":"Big fan of this place! Only been twice and it was awesome both times ! Cool atmosphere and great food!"}
{"text":"Talk about hidden treasure..we circled these block three times trying to find this place. We finally parked and walked around and found it, and man was it worth it.   The dinning room is small but cozy and even though it was a Sunday night we had to wait a bit to be seated, though it didn't take long. We got the pork buns to start and holy smokes would I recommend these! It's just two buns but it's a great starter for two people. They were a little spicy but over all super well balanced and delicious.  We both ordered our own ramen, he got fire and ice and I can't remember the name of the one I got but it was the first one on that section of the menu. The fire and ice was AMAZING ! I stole so many tastes of it I thought my boyfriend was gonna kill me ha! It's a kimchi broth and it has salmon in it. And my goodness was this salmon amazing. It would pretty much melt in your mouth. It was fantastic. My bowl was more salty(which I like!), it had mushrooms, pork belly, an egg and a few other things in it. Again it was amazing. They serve these with a few spice side additions and I highly recommend using the chili oil in the bowl I got. It adds just enough spice.   Well finally we got the soft serve ice cream, which changes flavors I'm not sure if it's daily or weekly or monthly but it changes. Today they had a green tea and honey and a strawberry and basil. We got a cup of both and they were fantastic. The cups were paper so we were lucky enough to walk out with them and finish our ice cream on the walk to the car.   This place is worth the wait if there is one and always get the ice cream, you won't regret it! We love it here. And will be back very soon!"}
{"text":"Yum!  I had the fire & ice.  I highly recommend it.  The mint on the salmon really pushes this dish over the top."}
{"text":"We went to Futo Buta today and ended up lost thanks to Waze. The entrance is on the light rail tracks in the back of the building.   I had the Fire and Ice bowl and it was incredible. There's no way to describe the way the flavors blended together the more I ate. Tiny spice if any but an explosion of flavor. The miso bowl was alright but by no means as flavorful.   The green tea with honey soft serve was excellent. I only wish the miso had better flavor."}
{"text":"The tonkatsu ramen noodle was really good. Pork belly melts in your mouth!  Smoked pork belly and duck confit buns were amazing!"}
{"text":"What to get: tonkotsu ramen Service: 4/5 Atmosphere: casual, small crowded shop Wait: 20 mins (Saturday 3PM for 1) Parking: metered street parking (free on weekends), parking garage  The Experience: Very crowded ramen spot in a small shop, I'd only go on off times and with a very small group (or solo). Tucked behind a shopping strip, you'll need to park along the street or in nearby parking garages. If you add cold weather with possible rain, be ready to wait more. They actually have a texting system so you don't have to wait there, so that's pretty convenient.  If you do wait it out, their food is pretty great. I only ordered their tonkotsu ramen since I didn't want to stay in there too long. Maybe having lunch late and it being cold influenced my appetite, but I ate the whole bowl. The noodles were fresh and had an almost al dente texture. The broth was rich and balanced, not too fatty or salty, which is key. Lastly, I'll note that the smoked pork belly had a great crunchy 'bark' when biting into it. I didn't expect that, but if you love a change in textures, this is a fantastic surprise.  Gochisosama deshita!"}
{"text":"Before trying Futo Buta my experience with ramen started and stopped with the $0.25 oriental flavored microwave variety. After trying with a group of friends shortly after they opened last year this is one of my favorite spots.  Be prepared to wait Futo Buta--located off the Bland Street light rail stop--is a small spot that reminds me of restaurants I've tried in NYC, you're going to be shoulder to shoulder with strangers no matter where you sit in this restaurant.   The menu consist of various ramen dishes that range from vegetarian to hearty. Adding pork belly and duck to the ramen are two of my favorite options. The food is perfectly seasoned and all the taste mesh great together and the price is good. If you're looking for something different or to show off Charlotte to out of town guest you can't go wrong with Futo Buta."}
{"text":"So many delicious choices here! We went there two days in a two when we took a course there. Tried veggie ramen with spicy pork and fire and ice ramen. So so so yummy and the rice crisp thing was very unique and full of taste buds explosion. Will definitely go back there at every chance I get:)"}
{"text":"I've been looking for ramen ever since I had it in DC. Futo Buta was great and did not disappoint! I will be back for sure! Great menu. Perfectly made. Friendly staff!"}
{"text":"I am unsure why there would be a bad review Written about this place. ESPECIALLY about 2 of my favorite Items I had while I was there. The tonkatsu was to.die.for. Amazing! My friends Got a fried chicken appetizer which doesn't sound like much but the batter and the sauce were out of this world. I will definitely be back.. And as for the reviews saying the ramen was too salty, ramen is a dish that is generally salty, if you don't like salty foods.. Then maybe this isn't for you."}
{"text":"Headed to Charlotte for the weekend and I almost gave up trying to find this place, it's very difficult to locate. The address listed on Yelp does not lead you to the restaurant, but thankfully to Yelp tips, I was able to find parking and figure out where it was.  Lunch time gets quite busy and the location is small, but they have a very efficient waiting/seating process. They'll take your name down and text you when you're ready to be seated and you can also view where your spot is in line. Also, there is community seating so they can accommodate more people since the location is fairly small.  Now onto the food! For appetizers, we had the rice crispy squares and the salmon belly nigiri. Both were FIREEEE. The rice crispy squares were toasted rice squares that came with spicy tuna and wasabi soy sauce. Loved the combo, I would highly recommend trying it. I also loved the yuzu mayo they used for the salmon belly nigiri, though it was a nice touch of flavor, very unique.  We also tried the miso and tonkatsu ramen, loved the broth. Very rich and flavorful, and each came with an onsen (hot spring) egg which is slow cooked and similar to a poached egg. The mix of pork, noodles, and broth was to die for and perfect for a cold day. The portions are large so you'll leave feeling full. Overall, not the best ramen I've had but definitely one that satisfies the soul. Food all came out quick and service was exceptional. Will be back if we're ever in town again!"}
{"text":"Good food. Family style seating is not ideal but it is a very small location. Wish they would come up with a chicken ramen bowl option."}
{"text":"Been looking forward to trying this spot since it opened. Yes, I'm pretty late. I checked it out today because I finally figured out where it was located. They definitely need some signage from the street. I give 10 stars for customer service, however the ramen gets 1 star. I'm biased when it comes to ramen and gyozas since I grew up in Japan. I had the Tonkotsu ramen and Gyozas. Broth was bland, and didnt have that traditional opaque pork broth base to it. The egg was way to soft for ramen, and the noodles had almost a buckwheat taste. The portion was also small for the price. The best part of the ramen was the smoked pork. I will definitely be heading to Musashi on Johnston Rd. when I need my ramen fix.  I would return to Futo Buta and try other items, great atmosphere, great staff, but definitely not a spot for ramen."}
{"text":"I would travel 2000 miles again just to eat here! You can see the place is packed and very popular. Not your fancy private romantic atmosphere! Long tables and seating is limited. But man, it's worth the wait and the crowds. We ordered a couple of sushi specials, they were amazing! The Ramens are ridiculous good! The service is awesome and Charlotte will see my face again just because of this place. Hands down, best ramen ever!!!"}
{"text":"Try their crispy rice squares! I promise you will not be disappointed! Their ramen is a staple for me in the winter when I just want something warm. The wait can be a bit long at times due to the small space. The utilize \"communal\" table in the center of the restaurant to accommodate more people quicker. I personally do not care for this but they do have true tables and an outdoor patio as well. When they have their Shishito peppers in stock, I'd definitely recommend trying them out!

{"text":"No more ramen around town looking for an authentic dinner experience - Futo Buta is a gem! (There's my attempt at a punny intro, feedback appreciated lol) But in all seriousness, I came to Futo Buta for a date night and it was perfect. It has a fun and vibrant atmosphere that is great when you wanna change things up from the usual quiet laid back date night dinner. Futo Buta is a small, intimate and unique spot to try out!   Pro Tip, getting a table can be tricky during busy hours, so plan accordingly to get there early and get your name on the list, then grab yourself a drink at the bar while you wait or explore the area around. Once you get a table, prepare yourself for ramen that comes second only in my book to authentic ramen I had in Hong Kong, can't beat that, sorry. Nonetheless, I had the Tonkatsu Ramen bowl with the chilli oil added and it was wonderful! It was definitely on the spicier end so be ready for that with this dish, but the broth was rich and the pork had this amazing pecan smoked taste to it.   Overall, this is a great dinner spot to take people from out of town, or impress someone on a date. I'm definitely going back to try their non ramen menu items as well because they just looked so delicious!"}
{"text":"Traditional Japanese ramen is very rare in this parts, so was elated when this place opened. The broth for the Tonkatsu is definitely perfection while the slices of pork was definitely a southern style BBQ. Those of you that are into char siu bao, must try the appetizer, as this puppy is a flat bun topped with the pork and an amazing coleslaw.  If you're an introvert and don't like crowds, get there before 5:30 before the dinner crowd comes in or enjoy the loud music and sports. I'd consider this a staple for amazing food in Charlotte. Do it."}
{"text":"Sushi! Sake! Ramen! Yum!  A friend brought be here after we worked a booth at the Small Business Saturday together for her new Business (Pet Wants). What a cute little place. The interior has a tiny dining room with long community bars that people can sit at, just like the ones in Japanese Ramen bars. The patio outside is awesome, even when it's cold (they have heat lamps out there). It has a great view of the city at night and the little train goes right by.   They have a great Sake selection. We asked for a recommendation and we had one that had hints of lavender, nice and dry - just sweet enough. The crispy rice squares are killer, the pork steam buns are amazing and the tuna nigiri = OMG!   We shared some ramen as well and it was the best. I've had ramen in a house in Japan and this was just as good, really quite nice.  They also do soft serve with cool flavors - like Green Tea and Honey. Totes yummy!  A little gem of a place! I will be back!"}
{"text":"Get. The. Brussel. Sprouts!!!!! They were amazing! I had the vegan pho, which was delightful. The service was amazing, especially for how busy the small restaurant was. We will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Good stuff.  Had a pork belly slider for an app, very tasty. Ramen was excellent, super tasty, great spot for a lunch outside, right by the train, free parking in the building garage. A little bit pricey."}
{"text":"I have been skeptical about the ramen trend, but my cousin was in town and wanted to try this place. What a great decision! Appetizers were great and so was the ramen. Great service too!"}
{"text":"UPDATING MY REVIEW FROM 4 STARS TO 5 STARS. First time I came here, the ramen was WAY too salty. Especially with seaweed, pork belly, and whatever else is in your bowl, the broth cannot also be salty because then it just tastes like saltwater. I came back after OVER ONE YEAR giving them a chance to show me that the hype is actually real and they hold true to what good ramen is.   I got the Shoyu, and as a person who does not like pork belly, I ate all of it. The thing I hate most is the fatty smell and taste, but the pecan smoked pork belly really masked that smell and flavor that I do not particularly enjoy. I tried some of the salmon from the Fire and Ice, PHENOMENAL. I wish it came with the onsen egg though. The flavor was great and was well seasoned. We ended our meal with Black Sesame Ice Cream, which is a hit or miss for everyone. I particularly love Black Sesame and the presentation was so cute. The waitresses and waiters are nothing but kind, greeting you immediately as you walk in and saying their thank yous and goodbyes as you leave. Absolutely impeccable, and compliments to the Chef."}
{"text":"This place is great! I have heard good things and finally got to try it out last weekend. I've never had true ramen before (unless you count ramen noodles--which you dont) so this was my first experience and i was very impressed. When it comes to new types of foods i tend to creep the yelp page to see whats popular, so i got pork belly buns and the miso hungry ramen.   The buns were great and so was the ramen, the broth was perfect, not too salty or anything of that sort.   I was also a bit worried since i am famously terrible at using chopsticks but if you ask they will give you a cheater pair  (basically w paper shoved between the two sticks with a rubber band) and you will feel like pro without having to be the only person eating with a fork in the entire restaurant.   Only downside to this place is that it is not good for large groups (4 is prob max based on seating arrangements)"}
{"text":"This was such an amazing place to find!  Definitely a gem but parking can be somewhat hard to find.  If you need to find parking, park at The Post Apts parking garage.  I am from NOVA and was interested in trying this place since I think the ramen places in Virginia are just sub-par.  Coming here, it was very cute and liked the color scheme they have for outside seating!  I had the Tori Kara Age(Fried Jap. Chicken) which was AMAZING.  Definitely recommend it!  I also go the Buta Bowl, which was SUPER FILLING AND AMAZING.  They doubled up on the noodles and the pork was very tender and flavorful!  They say it's EXTREMELY SPICY...however I did not find it that spicy(I love spicy food).   If you want something stuffing and filling, go with the Buta Bowl!!"}
{"text":"This place is good, solid appetizers and ramen but nothing special compared with others I've been to around Charlotte and Columbia.  From the other reviews I may have been setting my expectations too high. The ambience and atmosphere are good and the staff were friendly. Presentation was very good, just a bit overpriced for what it is...otherwise a solid 3.5."}
{"text":"This place is good but the prices are frightening. I found my shoyu ramen to be all too salty. We were seated next to a party of 10 people and 5 of their dogs. While I am a huge dog person, I found this situation to be a little ridiculous. The dogs kept blocking the walkway and posed a danger for us and the waitress bringing bowls of hot soup. A tiny ice cream cone cost $6 and a bowl of noodles with two tiny slices of pork started at $12. Nothing amazing really but that may be because I'm from NY where the food scene is legit."}
{"text":"This is by far the best ramen I have found in the South! They are creative and delicious and I've never had a bad dish there. The ramen portions are extremely generous, the tuna and duck bowls small but filling, and the fries Brussel sprouts are an absolute must! They have some of the best cocktails in Charlotte in my opinion as well. They have a variety of menu items that rotate in and out of season so it continually feels fresh even when you're going regularly. I personally can't get enough of them and am all ways excited to go back!"}
{"text":"Arrived at about 9:50p for dinner. We were seated within 20 minutes. The very low-key checkin system is fun but be sure you eagle eye the hostess with the iPhone when you walk in or risk standing around, not in line. Go late at night if you want to avoid the usual two hour wait.   Food is very tasty. Service is quick and well delivered. Entrees arrived quickly and prepared nicely. It is a bit noisy but with so many people in such a small space that's to be expected.   Two ramen bowls and a cheap bottle of sake with tax and a 20% tip was $55.   Great date night spot. You can't sit very far from each other so you'd better have something to talk about or else your date will see you thumbing through Bumble."}
{"text":"As a native New Yorker, my review may come off a little harsh. I've had my fair share of exponential ramen with rich broth. Futo Buta came short. Their broth was very bland, and not well balanced with flavor. The pork belly was cooked okay, and the noodles were fine. The broth needs to improve significantly. I will say however the gyoza were pretty good though. P.S. Turn down the air in there, or turn ON the air. It was SUPER hot in there, and I am a person that gets cold easily."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place for the first time after going to Red Clay Cider's grand opening. We shared an order of smoked pork belly buns and each got ramen. The pork belly buns were good, little surprised they were sliders instead of buns, but the breading was still the steamed bread you would associate with buns, delicious and I would get them again. I got the tonkotsu ramen with spicy ground pork added. The spicy pork chili was a nice addition to the dish and probably a must if you plan to get the ramen. The ramen was good, though smaller than competitor offerings and on the pricy side as a result. Tonkotsu $14 + Spicy Chili $2 and 2 pork buns $10. While I would go again, I think I favor Yama Izakaya or Musashi for ramen. I used to think Yama's ramen was pricy, but Futo Buta charges the same amount for less ramen. It used to be hard to find a place that served tonkotsu ramen, it's nice that it is becoming a more common offering. I'd try them all to pick your favorite as each was good with a slightly different take on it.  I would have given them at least a 4 for quality of their food, but they are definitely overpriced."}
{"text":"This place is doing it right. OMG the food is so good! The community style dining is also very cool. You should eat here."}
{"text":"Excellent ramen and one of the best restaurants in Charlotte. Very small area and limited seating, so arrive early or be ready to wait. Recommend all the bowls, sake flights, and be sure to get green tea ice cream."}
{"text":"If you're looking for your ramen fix, this is the place. They have amazing vegan ramen dishes. The restaurant is a bit small, and most likely you have a wait to sit down, but you it's worth it!"}
{"text":"Instant noodles and powder mix soup plus a bunch of salt. Hipster service doesn't seem to understand about ramen.  Only nice presentation but we were done after 5 min. Maybe the problem is I know Asian food too well from growing up there."}
{"text":"The Miso ramen is my number one pick!  I've tried to be adventurous and try different ramens (for example, the butternut miso), but I always come to the same conclusion: that I should have ordered the Miso. The pork and chicken broth give the dish a wonderful flavor, while the sweet white corn, pecan smoked pork belly and onsen egg provide an array of different textures and taste. If you're looking to try a few highly recommended appetizers, I would suggest the edamame, rice crispy squares and Kurobuta pork & scallop gyoza.  TIP: This place is small and can get very crowded (aka a long wait)- try to come at an off time or right before everyone arrives!"}
{"text":"Best Ramen in Charlotte hands down. I always seem to find myself here at least twice a month. Servers are all super friendly and knowledgeable. Always 5 stars for Futo!"}
{"text":"The ramen here is rich and savory with pork this and pork that (they do have some vegetarian options), pretty much all of it delicious.  The appetizers are solid, the flavors are clean but layered.  The staff is outstanding and their proximity to the light rail makes them easy to get to from pretty much anywhere in central Charlotte.  I wasn't sure about the soft serve, seemed like an odd choice, but even that was good.  Well worth a visit."}
{"text":"This place is so good and it's always packed. The only thing I don't care for is the community seating but that's not even worth removing a star because it's so good. I always get the miso, the pork belly is to die for. I would highly recommend trying one of their ice creams when you are there too!"}
{"text":"The food here is excellent. Everything we had from the apps. to Ramen was to die for.  Excellent flavors, super fresh and the noodles are made in-house.  It's a cool vibe, good, loud music (Bowie, The Cult, etc.). My only complaint is I forgot my to-go container at the table and went back to pick it up within 5 minutes of walking outside and they had thrown it away.  VERY disappointing.  I was looking forward to the leftovers. Other than that it was great and we will be back!"}
{"text":"Gave futo buta a try with friends who were in town and would give it 3.5 stars. Overall, our food was decent but the prices were a bit high for Charlotte. If I wanted DC prices...I would go get DC ramen :) We met at 5:30 on a Thursday and had our choice of seating. When we left at 7pm, there was a wait for a table. So arrive early! There is outside seating, but in the heat, very few patrons selected that option.   Location: hard to find! Park in Post Southend Apartments (entrance off Bland, just before/after the light rail tracks by All American Pub). Park in the level 1 retail parking and exit out the back of the deck (where the dumpsters are). If you head toward the Charlotte Trolley Museum, you'll see Futo Buta to your right.   Atmosphere: great pictures on the wall and a cozy wood look/feel. However the water fill cart with cups, silverware, and a spray bottle for wiping down tables parked right across from our table made it feel a little unclean. It would be nice for them to move that to the back/behind the bar.   Appetizers:  * crispy rice squares were delicious. The tuna was fresh and paired well with the wasabi soy and the squares of fried white rice. Price: $12 * Smoked Pork Belly Buns: two soft buns with well sauced pork belly inside. Yummy. The buns are small so eat slowly. Price: $10   Sushi: we ordered a sushi roll that featured smoked salmon. My friend asked the waitress in advance how many pieces came with the sushi roll and she said 5. Not sure what happened to the 5th piece because it definitely came with 4! The plating was gorgeous but unfortunately, the taste was a no-go. It tasted fishy and the sauce had an unpleasant aftertaste. We returned this dish to the kitchen.   Ramen: all 3 of us ordered different bowls: Tonkotsu, Miso, and Fire & Ice. None of us had leftovers! These bowls are packed with noodles (I mean, really full) and had savory broths. The miso bowl (my order) had about 3 slices of pork belly and an egg along with the noodles/vegetables. My friend who ordered the Fire & Ice raved the most... I'm just not the biggest fan of kimchi.    Futo Buta is worth trying out. I doubt I'll ever be a regular, but I'm certain I will go back again. No appetizers, but will try another bowl!"}
{"text":"I visited Futo Buta on an afternoon before a wedding I was in town for. I love that I was able to take the light rail and walk right onto the restaurant. I was seated immediately at the bar closest to the kitchen. Both my server and the person I assume was the manager were helpful in volunteering their favorite dishes after discovering I hadn't been there before. I generally prefer tonkotsu so I ordered theirs. I have to say, it was quite good! There are two things keeping it from better than average rating. One: the prices. My favorite ramen shop in DC has bowls nearly twice as big as these for a dollar less. Two: there was a very disgruntled employee that kept trucking back and forth complaining about her tables when she'd grab food from the kitchen pass-through. It was weird, since she's nearly a foot away from other patrons. If I weren't there alone I probably wouldn't have noticed but it was a little uncomfortable. All in all if I were back in Charlotte, I'd visit again. If you're craving ramen, check it out!"}
{"text":"As far as Ramen goes, this is my go-t- recommendation for a trendy Charlotte place. The inside is small, and has a tendency to be noisy. I usually get seated at the communal \"farm\" tables in the middle of the restaurant. The brussel sprouts that \"move\" seem to be a commonly ordered side/appetizer, but in my experience it is more about the novelty/instagram factor than about the taste. Skip the brussels and get the steamed buns as your app."}
{"text":"I really liked this place.  Admittedly, I am not a connoisseur of Japanese food.  But with that in mind, I left the restaurant a very happy camper.  As others have said, this is a bit hard to find, as it has no direct road access.  But having made a few wrong turns on South Boulevard and Tryon Street, I eventually got there.  The place is small and I sat at the bar...and, yes, the stools at the bar are a bit awkward to get in and out of.  But that truly is my only complaint.  I 'fessed up to the server that I knew virtually nothing about Japanese food.  I also told him that I am mostly a vegetarian.  He steered me to the veggie ramen dish (it is the one right below Fire and Ice on the menu).  What a great choice.  The bowl was full of noodles and veggies with a broth second to none.  The server also explained the four different spices/oils he gave me and what sort of flavor each would produce.  Again, he was spot on.  Yes, for $12, the bowl was a bit pricey.  But I left the place quite full and quite satisfied.  I  cannot wait to go back."}
{"text":"This place is SO good!!! I always try to get my office to go with me but their complaint is that it is too pricey. Other than that, the food is superb."}
{"text":"This is officially the first restaurant we love since moving to Charlotte. Without trying to sound elitist, coming from Los Angeles which has some of the best restaurants in the world, we've struggled to find anywhere we raved about. Either the food is average or inconsistent. Sometimes the food is decent but the service is off. After many strikeouts we finally found Futo Buta!!   Each time we're greeted quickly. If there's a wait, it's usually quick. The food is always fresh and consistent. The owner/GM Michael recognizes us and checks in to make sure we're good. He's genuine and a good guy, not like a TGIF Manager making his rounds because he has to. Michael actually cares. The music is great too. You can follow them on Spotify if you want to keep listening to their playlist.   Order: Hamachi, Salmon Belly Sushi, Rice Crispy Squares and any of the Ramen. You can't go wrong!   They have a great Saki and beer too!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service! We sat comfortably at the bar and started with the peppers and Brussels sprouts, which were both phenomenal. We all had ramen, which was also delicious. Brittany the bartender/server rocked...she was funny, knowledgeable and on it!"}
{"text":"Perhaps I am missing something about this place as I'm not quite getting the hype.  I recently stopped in for lunch and tried the Miso ramen bowl, which includes corn, pork belly, scallions, bean sprouts, bok choy, minus the onsen egg.  I'm still trying to figure out why I paid $12 for that....nothing about this ramen stood out, the pork belly was ok, but the noodles and broth in my opinion were no different from what's sold in the grocery store.  The veggie toppings were fresh but nothing about this ramen was special for me, just seems a tad overrated."}
{"text":"Easy check in process. You get a text when your table is ready. Come ready to wait in line.  I ordered the Tonkotsu which was delish. Highly recommend this place for two or three people max. My server was very attentive and warm."}
{"text":"This is the best place for a a bowl of ramen in Charlotte!   Our favorites are:  1. Shoyu - perfect, flavors compliment each other perfectly!  2. Tonkatsu - a little more on the salty side  3. Miso  We also love the different Ice Cream Flavors: Our favorites are in the following order: 1. Green Tea Ice Cream  2. Strawberry Basil   Don't forget to try their appetizer buns!"}
{"text":"Bad.  Ass.  Ramen.  I guess I can write a review now since the masses have found out about this little joint.  Seating is limited in the winter since the outdoor patio is down, however management works hard to get you in when there is a wait. The menu is small which doesn't bother me especially since everything on it is fantastic (full disclosure I haven't had everything on it).  I've dined here enough times to know everything that comes out of this Chefs kitchen is made with the best ingredients, and it's highly unlikely that you would be disappointed with anything that comes out of his work space.  Started with rice crispy squares and low country smoked pork belly buns.  Main course was Miso Hungry ramen (add mushrooms and spicy ground pork),  wish I had left room for the house made soft serve (strawberry basil is my favorite).  When I left I definitely felt like a fat pig.  I knew early on this place was special and would build a cult like following.  Congratulations to the Chef, you have created something great here and I look forward to watching and participating in it continuing to blossom."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service. The hostess checked the 4 of us in and following the app we were 17th in line. As the night progressed, our wait went from 17 to 11, then back to 13 eventually to the hostess completely forgetting about us. We approached the hostess and she decided to give the spot of 4 to another group because she decided for us it wasn't good for us. When approached about why this happened, she just shrugged her shoulders and said \"sorry.\"  After we were finally sat, we noticed another family of 3 had patiently waiting for a very long time and they were ignored too while tables of 3 were given to more recent guests.   This experience has left a bad taste and would not recommend this spot till they have better organized hostess."}
{"text":"Best ramen in town, been here several times. Only complaint is that it is slightly hard to find since it does not face the street, but once you find it once you'll definitely remember where it is. We have ordered the Rice Crispy Squares, Tonkotsu, Miso, Fire and Ice and Niwa. Never had the sushi, but it looks delicious. Ramen is excellent whether it's 3pm on a Tuesday or 7pm on a Saturday. You are doing yourself a disservice if you do not come here!"}
{"text":"charlotte was sooo in need of a place like this!  I tried it for the first time yesterday and it did not disappoint.  if you know ramen and the heavenly broth that comes with all the varieties then you will love this place. everything is made in house and it is delicious.   tried the miso and the gyoza...both fantastic but now I want that kimchi!  that's for my next visit, which is prob gonna be today."}
{"text":"This place is spectacular. It's always busy and seating= close quarters/ being okay with strangers. As long as you're okay with that, you shouldn't have a problem."}
{"text":"Easily my favorite place to go for ramen why not 5*? Because of the one bad experience I had here where I was told it'd be a 20min wait and after 30 we were not seated I figured we'd be seated any minute....1 1/2 hours later finally seated. We told our server about our wait and he then said \"the wait will be worth it in my head were seated and ready to eat. He gets our drinks an appetizers brings them put then runs away and doesn't come back for 30 min. At this point my company is irritated about their wait we get someone to fetch our server after we finally get a hold of him and order we see him serving his new table and he says to them as a joke \"you should feel lucky we had some people waiting here for an hour and a half.\" Honestly besides this one experience that took 3 hours to get in and out of futo but I love the place. Otherwise I wouldn't go back the next day."}
{"text":"This place is to small for a large crowd. The food is okay. The bowls are not to big but it is over priced for the amount you get. They do have good specials but I don't reccomended this place as the best Ramen in charlotte. There's better, believe me! But it is somewhere you should experience at least once. As far as the pork belly buns, they are okay not to much flavor. It only comes with 2 for the price of a whole bowl of ramen. So still not the best."}
{"text":"3.5 stars - quality ambiance, portions, and pork belly. However, the ramen noodles themselves fall short as they were overcooked. This can probably be redeemed by requesting that the noodles be extra firm (I'll try that next time).  Aside from ramen, Futo Buta offers a variety of beers, appetizers, and rolls as well. Although I haven't explored other parts of the menu yet, the customers around us seemed satisfied and I will definitely look into this in future visits."}
{"text":"Went there last night and oh boy they have redeemed themselves. All thanks to Tyler, our wonderful server., I brought a friend there whose is also a chef. He went when Futo was first open. Of course I'm sure at that time, they're trying to work out their kinks.. so he decided to give Futo a 2nd chance and I'm glad he did.  Step into a place which jammed pack and cozy. We promptly seated. Tyler introduced himself pleasantly.. I mentioned that my friend came here when it was first open and he wasn't impressed. I on the other hand will just order the same old thing like i usually do which is the Miso Hungry (habit for me). Tyler asked my friend if he's willing to trust him., and if he like heat in his ramen. The response. Yea with the heat but it has to be flavorful heat. Not just heat thrown in there! Understandable. His ramen was even listed. Perfect.  Ramen has a chicken dashi broth, spiced ground pork, duck confit and pickled daikon. And he loves it. Tyler made him a fan now. And I'm truly impressed. We will now come back and he will alway ask him for something off the menu from now on!"}
{"text":"So imma be honest. I mean that's what you want right? I've never had real ramen before. So I can't speak on the authenticity of the ramen I had. But who cares, right?   I mean good food is good food. I care about the flavor, how the ingredients mesh together, seasoning, accoutrements, variety, etc.   On a perfect day of weather, my dude and I stopped in this place because hey... I need to start chomping away at what I have bookmarked and who wants to be stuck in doors on this beautiful, cool, sunny day?   We snagged the last table outside. Service was spot on, from showing us to our table to recommendations, to checking on us.   My food was straight. I would order my dudes tho. He had the Miso Hungry ramen with a bit of sesame oil. But that's because I like bean sprouts and corn and I don't like a lot of shit in my food. Not to say the Tokantsu was bad but just not my cup of tea.   The appetizer was good with accompanying sauce. It was simple and I was told it was the second best appetizer. The best is the joint with raw salmon. I don't do raw.   We'll be back on a account of my dude falling in love with this place. Yea... we'll be back. I gotta try their ice cream too when I see a flavor worth trying. Today they had green tea and fruity pebbles. Meh."}
{"text":"Get the Tonkatsu ramen. It's the richest broth (pork). It's one of those things you get the first time and never get anything else, because it is THAT good.  Ask for hot sesame oil and togarashi (fixin's)  Don't bother with appetizers (steamed buns, sushi, rice squares, etc.) They're overpriced and not worth it. The ramen's more than enough.  Get honey with your ice cream, if you do get ice cream. Basil is a bit of an odd flavor. I like green tea best.  Park on the first floor in a visitor space in the parking garage behind Crispy Crepe. Walk towards the Light Rail.  Literally some of the best ramen I've ever had. And I've had ramen in Washington DC, NYC, and San Francisco."}
{"text":"It's rare that I give 5 starts but this little place is at the top of my list for a bowl of ramen. Actually, I'd probably give it 5 starts just for a plate of pork buns. I'm sure this small place gets super busy on a weekend for dinner, especially if the outdoor area is not open. The outdoor area is very large however if it's raining, you will be sitting super close to others in the 30 seat dining area inside. The ramen noodles and broth are all prepared in house daily and you can tell. The service is excellent. The sake flights for $15 are a fun addition. I will be back!!"}
{"text":"Exquisite! One of my very favorite restaurants in Charlotte.  It's an excellent Izakaya--you can enjoy a full on meal or you could have some sake from their choice list or beer (local craft, Japanese) and share smaller plates.  The fried brussel sprouts are quite popular with good reason.  Also, the Rice Crispy squares, chewy with spicy tuna, are out of this world.  If I am there, it's full on meal for me and bring on the ramen! My favorite is the Tonkotsu Ramen--though they are all quite tasty!  Be sure to add (2$) spicy ground pork.  I always have to take a picture of my bowl--very beautifully prepared.  Throw in a Chirashi Roll from the fresh sheet and you'll achieve gustatory Nirvana.    Just to add a lil something about the space itself.  Inside, the decor is genius in its simplicity but incorporates a more Japanese sense of space we'll say. The outdoor seating is nice bc you're on the light rail line.   Its perfect for people watching and scenic as uptown is in view.  On cooler nights, they fire up the heaters for a brisk but cozy al fresco experience."}
{"text":"Heard good things about this place, so decided to check it out! Very glad I did.  Atmosphere: Came at 10 PM on a Saturday, no line at that time, though the place was actually relatively packed. It's a small shop, very nicely decorated with a dim interior.   Service: Service was great! We sat at the bar, and was asked how we were doing throughout the meal.   Waters were refilled without prompting, and we were asked if we wanted chili sauce also without prompting. Everyone was very friendly.   Food: tonkotsu with sprouts.  - Pros: Solid broth. I had some pretty nice ramen in LA, and this shares the same feel of flavors. Pork is rich and amazing! Fatty and lean parts delicious in their different ways. Noodles were the perfect consistency. Great variety of veggies that give burst of flavor. Presentation is beautiful! - Cons: Medium portion size, though I was full at the end. The onsen egg is almost entirely runny, and I prefer the ajitama.   Overall, if you are a Ramen fanatic and visiting Charlotte, I would recommend trying this place!"}
{"text":"After my last review,  Chef Michael begged me to get the last star stating their location is hidden to keep the long lines to a minimum.   Too funny!  OK, Mike . . . you got your 5th star.  I reward local businesses who are passionate and involved in day 2 day operations.  Clearly, this is the case here.  5 stars!!"}
{"text":"Amazing Ramen! Great drinks and a cool atmosphere. Always busy so expect to wait a bit... but it is worth it!"}
{"text":"Guest set after U.S. Received food before us. Guest who came in after got set first. What food we received was good. When questioned server about it. She was snarky and unhelpful. When asked to speak to manager was informed there was not one. I then spoke to the owner. He told me the server was a manager and there was not anything that could be done. I will not be returning"}
{"text":"Great fast efficient service in a timely manner. Servers and employees really friendly! Good location next to the train station. Atmosphere really clean and modern. Can't go wrong with the various choices of ramen to meet anyone's taste buds. Recommend the BBC Pork belly buns! Also the Shoyu ramen. Only thing is that it gets crowded during weekends so try to get there early!"}
{"text":"4.5 stars. I like Baku so I had high expectations and it did not disappoint. What a great addition to South End and the light rail corridor. Get here before everyone hears, I anticipate lines to get in here in the near future. The Miso Hungry was almost perfection. The noodles were nice and fresh with a chew and the broth had a deep flavor. Egg was just right. I added the pork chili and really recommend it if you like a little spice. Only thing that could have been improved for me is if the pork belly had a little crispness, not sure what the authentic way is though. Everyone was really friendly. Our waitress recommended the strawberry basil soft serve they had on tap that day...it was one of the best ice creams I've had. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Teeny Tiny place but the food is amazing! Small Asian-inspired plates and they're so interesting. Try things you've never had before. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I love this place.   Great ramen and really convenient to uptown.  Try the Brussel sprouts as an appetizer."}
{"text":"Futo Buta is amazing. I was skeptical when I heard \"ramen\" but every dish is delicious.   This might not be the best place to try to bring a group on the weekend. It is very small and intimate so you may end up waiting awhile. Our group of 5 was seated at a bar along the wall so the people on the ends couldn't talk. Also service was pretty slow the night we went.  The food makes up for these things. I had the steam bun appetizer and the Miso ramen. The quality of food is amazing. The pork belly in the ramen just melts in your mouth. It is filling but doesn't leave you feeling full and bloated.  Food is 5 stars but service was a 3 star. I think they could benefit from taking reservations but I haven't gone on a weeknight so it may be a lot chiller then."}
{"text":"So freaking good! Flavorful broth and fresh ingredients make this authentic ramen so delicious. This is not your college ramen. This is not \"oodles and noodles.\" This is yummy!"}
{"text":"What a delightful yet hearty dinner! Perfect start to a weekend after a long Saturday shift. Excellent ambience both indoors and outdoors, overlooking the skyline. Tonkotsu, Buta Bowl, and Miso (pictured) all wonderfully comforting with homemade ramen and seemingly limitless layers of savory goodness highlighted by a scrumptious pork belly that is perfectly seasoned/grilled/presented.  Only recommendation regards the lengthy seating time (30min) despite several open tables outdoor, which we had requested; asked to keep standing in order to not \"overbook the kitchen\". We could have been offered seats at those tables prior to actually ordering. Nonetheless, some of the best ramen in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Had my eye on this place since their opening day. Went with a large group of eleven people late Saturday night. Our group took up majority of the 'communal' table so the wait was a little longer as expected.  We had a range of people who had no idea what ramen was to hardcore fans. Each one of them really enjoyed the entire experience.  Had the Rice Kristy treat appetizers which was amazing! The perfect amount of crunch, tuna, and heat make it a great starter.  I ordered the Miso (Hungry) with the upgraded $2 spicy pork. Wow... I've been to some great ramen places across the US and this was easily the best bowl I've ever had. Writing this right now makes me want to go back right now..   Glad to have a place like this in South End. Looking forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"I like this place alot, even though I am functionally challenged trying to eat with chopsticks. I love their pork belly buns, I wish you got 3 instead of 2 for $10, I think that price is high for the amount. Fire and Ice ramen with salmon is good too."}
{"text":"Finally an Instahype restaurant that lives up to the hype.  I visitied Futo Buta on Saturday and they killed.  I love the app they use to see where you are in line through your smartphone.  This way you can do other things while you wait.  The food was bomb.  The ramen was awesome and so was the pork that was in the bowl.  They serve good craft beer here, the appetizer was on point, and so was the staff.  The place is rather small and I can forsee the wait being longer as the food and price point are perfect."}
{"text":"I ate my husband's leftovers from here for lunch today so while its fresh on my mind...review time! I was trying to wait until cooler Fall temps before once again slurping on a bowl of piping hot ramen but I could not.  Ive always had to wait, albeit, the wait really doesn't take long. If you have to wait for a seat and its raining or very cold, know you might have to wait outside since the \"waiting area\" is not big, but that is because the restaurant really isnt big either. There are rows of seats by the window as well as a larger communal type table in the middle. My husband and I sat at two seats across from each other at that big table. Food comes out fast. When in season, we always get the shishito peppers to start. Not many restaurants have them so we partake in their deliciousness when we get the chance.  This visit, I opted for the Chizu ramen which I have had before. Its chicken broth with grated pecorino cheese piled to one side of the bowl so you can stir it around once the large bowl is placed in front of you. I add shrooms for extra extra umami and it never disappoints. Not your typical ramen though. My husband got the vegan one which has some serious flavor going on too. This own is the Niwa. We will be getting the rice crispy squares next time. This app comes with blocks of crisped rice, nice and browned. Then its served with spicy tuna and some soy and you assemble what you want in one bite."}
{"text":"I think this place has so many stars, because so many reviewers in Charlotte have not had authentic Japanese ramen. This is NOT authentic ramen. The miso ramen had absolutely no flavor and the noodles were off. The steamed buns were plastic-like. Brussel Sprouts were good, but for the price, diner should be given more. Yama Izakaya or Earl's Grocery in Charlotte have FAR better, more flavorful ramen."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. I live in Boone NC and have no ramen options so every time I'm in Charlotte I hit this place up. Very small inside so it gets very crowded. Wish they would expand some where with better seating and parking options. But love this place !"}
{"text":"I don't say this lightly, but Futo Buta is my favorite restaurant in Charlotte! Given any opportunity, I will go!  My only wish is they get a bigger space :( It is just too cramped.  Try everything on their menu!"}
{"text":"One of the best lunch spots in the city.  The Miso Ramen and Salmon Belly Nigiri are to die for. The interior is slightly cramped, but has such a modern upbeat vibe that you hardly notice. Patio seating is ample and well laid out."}
{"text":"Was super excited to try a new Ramen place because my favorite is way south of Charlotte and a pain to drive to.  Futo-Buta is hidden along the train line in a very small space which, while clean and expertly decorated, is incredibly hard to fit a party of more than two in.  We were treated as an unwelcome obstacle with a party of 6 and told we could only stand at the bar to wait for a table to open up until people came and wanted to sit there because we couldn't sit outside.  (My friend has Lupus, which I explained, and can't sit outside in sunlight on a 90 degree day)   The ramen was good, but very oily by all accounts of our group.  The restrooms were clean, the table service was prompt once seated, and we would go back, but never with more than two people again.  I will say this was at noon on a summer Saturday in July, so maybe things have changed since then."}
{"text":"The Miso ramen was tasty.  I received only 2 slices of pork belly & hoped for more.  The cabbage or scallion that was part of the meal was like a huge broccoli stalk end that I navigated around.  I would hope for a little more in the way of corn or the veggies in the ramen.  At a certain point, it felt like a huge bowl of miso soup w/noodles vs. additional items.  The soup was slug slow to come out.  I'm wondering if that is to steep the flavors or some other reason.  Sitting outside & it started to rain.  For the exposed tables on a busy Fri night there wasn't enough room to seat everyone inside.  Luckily, I had completed my meal so I was able to leave vs. stick around for the mania that ensued trying to accommodate the other patrons.  I'll try this again & maybe a different dish vs. ramen.  The buns the table next to me had looked pretty tasty."}
{"text":"Unorganized, crowded, and unspacious. Refuse to sit you until entire party has arrived. Asked if we could sit at a non high top table and was told that it was only based on first available. We left and went down the street to nikkos."}
{"text":"It was meant to be. Walking along the rail trail with my hubs and pup, we stumbled upon Futo Buta's patio. They welcomed all of us and sat us immediately and brought out a water bowl for our thirsty pup. We enjoyed looking at all the Lynx riders and everyone passing by. It's a great place to people watch!  The service was great! Every employee was so friendly, attentive, and hard at work. I didn't see anyone standing around or walking around without something in their hand. This is how every dining experience should be.   The food is made from scratch, in house. Terrific! I got the Tonkotsu ramen and the hubs got the vegan ramen. Pork add to the depth in flavor in the broth. Ask for the Japanese 7 spice to add a kick to the meal. Slurp away! And for dessert, YES.   Now we don't just have to watch the travel or food channel for a ramen bowl...we can get one in our own Queen City!"}
{"text":"Being from the Bay Area, I'm used to having a variety of incredible ramen spots from which to choose.  When I heard about Futo Buta, I pretty much dropped everything and went to get my ramen fix, but, after three attempts, it has turned out to be a far cry from authentic, flavorful ramen.  Ramen is all about a rich, delicious broth and this came no where near the authentic ramen I've experienced many other places.  Two thumbs down."}
{"text":"My favorite part about Futo is the portion sizes. The bowl may look small but it really is A LOT of ramen. My only complaint is them changing the portion size of the pork buns. The previous size could be a meal on its own. lol"}
{"text":"My favorite ramen place! Everything is absolutely perfect.  And thanks for amazing ice cream."}
{"text":"I loved it here. I had he miso ramen and it was so damn good. I can't wait until I'm back in Charlotte again and can give this place another go. The food was so fresh! I sat at the bar and just watched dishes pass me by that I wish I could have devoured.  Great service too, super friendly and very knowledgeable about the product."}
{"text":"Welcome to Futo!  Where the fun has everything to do with how comfortable you feel slurping your noodles and drinking from a spoon made for giants.  This place is the shiz, and it's delicious.  Perhaps not the best first date location, but the perfect place to go with friends or someone you've already locked down :).    There are a lot of things I love about this place - but the first and most important is the food.  It's really more like edible art, complete with hands on activities.  If it's your first time you really should try one of the ramen bowls + pork (if you're not a veggie you should just add pork to whatever they have available).  After your first time you can branch out, but why not try what they're known for?  If you're looking for an appetizer I would absolutely try the rice crispy tuna or the steamed bun (pork or eggplant - both bangin).  I have not yet had the pleasure of trying the sushi, but mostly it's because the ramen is just SO good.  Next, the environment.  Imagine the inside of a renovated airstream trailer, decorated by the finest interior designer in the land, that looks and feels like coming in from a long day on the ski slopes to a fireside hearty meal that melts in your mouth.  The staff - every single person in there is remarkably nice.  I've eaten there twice now and both times our waiter/waitress was accommodating and made great recommendations.  The kitchen has a slightly open feel to it, so you can see the chefs and they can see you.  They look up and greet you as you come and go - and in general is just has a really calm, positive energy to it.  That might actually be the best part.   Cheers"}
{"text":"I've come back a few times a few months later. Much improved and now I'm hooked. Love their Fire & Ice. Lots of flavor and very filling. Go with extra broth and add an onsen egg :) Try to go early to beat the lunch and dinner rush. You usually get seated immediately if you do so or you'll wait a good 15+ mins. Seating is tight, still no hooks to hang coat or bag. Music genre is random and loud at times.  Old review when they first opened: 3 stars...for now. UGH. I know. I will be back... they need to work on some kinks, hopefully before their grand opening. It also doesn't help that I was already mentally comparing Futo Buta to Ippudo NYC and Momofuku. Just reading the menu reminded me of Ippudo's items. Upon entering, the place is cozy, small. I can only imagine the wait once they start picking up. Love the decor which reminded me of Momofuku's and a little bit of Toki Underground and Daikaya in D.C.. They could use some hooks underneath the bar and community table for purses, bags and jackets. I ended up pulling my purse handle up my leg to secure it. Staff is really friendly. While waiting for our food I noticed a few customers take their left over ramen to-go. WHAT?! Who does that??? Immediately my husband said, ratio is off, too much noodles, not enough broth. Once we got our ramen, I realized that was that was very true. I ordered the Niwa (vegan) and hubster ordered the Fire & Ice (salmon). For appetizers we ordered Shishito pepper and the Eggplant Buns. Here we go:  * Shishito Peppers - Best thing we ordered from the menu. We enjoyed every Bite of it. Flavorful, made us want more. * Eggplant Buns - Fail. TWICE. First time, the buns came very chewy and undercooked. Second go, same but just barely undercooked. Eggplant itself was tasty. * Niwa - Could use a little more flavor. Noodle texture was perfect. You can tell they were homemade and fresh. Too much noodle, not enough broth. Plenty of veggies in there. * Fire & Ice - Salmon is smoked which gave it that earthy flavor but it was too salty and maybe a little too smoky as well. Cooked perfectly. Too much noodle, not enough broth. Fresh noodles.   Overall, it was fine, underwhelming. As I mentioned earlier, a few kinks and fine tuning and this place will be great. Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"I can't rave enough about this place...The fried Brussel sprouts app is the single tastiest dish in charlotte, and I HATE sprouts. The ramen is amazing, the soft serve is amazing..everything is amazing!! Be prepared to have your whole party present if you want to be seated. This place fills up QUICKLY and space is limited. Outdoor seating it the best on a nice night. MUST try!!"}
{"text":"I decided to check this place out on Saturday night with a friend. Considering it was a Saturday night and South End was pretty busy, we got a spot right away in this cute little ramen spot.   The ambiance is nice; trendy, clean, and fun. A great spot for date night or a dinner with a couple friends. The place is small but did not feel cramped to me.  We started with the duck confit buns, which were amazing. The duck was so moist and the buns had great flavor. I got the Miso Hungry Ramen for my main entree. I've had ramen in CLT once before and was not impressed but Futo Buta was amazing! The broth had great depth, and the pork belly was nice and crispy. The noodles were perfectly al dente and the egg gave the meal a nice, hearty flavor.   I will definitely be back and would love to try the spicy tuna cakes and salmon ramen. Recommend this place for anyone looking for something different but delicious, with a trendy, intimate atmosphere."}
{"text":"So delicious. Don't get the rice crispy squares unless you want to crave them for all eternity .  Service is great, the food is great and it's ramen - type can't go wrong.  Fire and ice is my go to and my girlfriend loves the  chizu with pork   Small restaraunt, but worth the wait"}
{"text":"I tried Futo Buta first time and would say I'm very impressed. I tried the fire and ice ramen without making any modifications. My only complaint would be it wasn't as spicy as I would like but of course this is based on preference. Service was decent especially for a crowded Friday night, my only complaint would be we had to keep reminding our server of things. We had the green tea ice cream for dessert,  I would definitely recommend saving room for it. I can't wait to go back and try more."}
{"text":"Futo Buto has become our go-to spot for everything from a casual dinner with friends to a place to impress out of towners.   It's consistent and always hits the spot.   Use the No Wait app as this place is always hopping and in the summer be open to sitting outside, that's my favorite spot.   Big ups to Fire and Ice and whatever the seasonal ramen is."}
{"text":"Not a big fan of pork belly but I did try the pork belly ramen and it was delicious. Wife had a vegan ramen and it was delicious too. Our server was very good, she was attentive and funny. and the seating outside was feel good factor about this restaurant."}
{"text":"i made the mistake of ordering takeout from here. this place is incredibly overhyped by people who obviously have no idea of what flavor is. I got the duck bowl and the duck was dry and a leather boot and drowned in soy sauce. my friend got the tofu appetizer and the tofu tasted like it got forgotten in the freezer. I got the Shizu ramen and it was truly appalling and I didn't even finish it the broth tasted like it came from a maruchan pack. this food was not worth the 45$"}
{"text":"In a word? Unctuous. Yep, that's it.   Super hyped, expect a wait during peak hours.  Great, super-hip music."}
{"text":"Love love love this place. Went for lunch with a colleague and service was quick and the food delicious. Portions are really large too and love that it's right off the light rail."}
{"text":"In giving them 2 stars because the salmon ramen bowl was to die for but my waitress kept pushing me to order things. When I didn't want the Brussels sprouts she asked me if she could convince me. Um, no thanks means no thanks. When I declined dessert at the end of my meal, she said she'd just bring me my \"little check\". I might have gone back and brought a friend to share some plates and/or was more hungry but that's not going to happen now. I hope that comment was worth losing my future business."}
{"text":"Love this place! Tight seating quarters, but don't let that stop you from enjoying some amazing ramen...or buns or sushi or all of these great offerings. I had the Miso ramen and it was delicious to the last drop. They bring the spices to you so you can spice it up, or not. Music was a little loud and a little chaotic, but again don't let that stop you."}
{"text":"This was our first Ramen experience and boy was it delicious! Pork buns and fried Brussels sprouts were outstanding and we each enjoyed our Ramen entrees. It's small but worth sitting close to a stranger at the high table in the center or a window-facing counter. Our server was knowledgeable about the menu and didn't judge when I needed a fork to eat my dinner."}
{"text":"Quick...fetcheth forth my stretchy pants. I effing love this place and could eat all of their small plates AND bowls of ramen. Their sushi is fresh although it's tough to choose sushi over a big bowl of the tonkotsu.. I love adding their spicy chili oil and spice mix over top. Their eggs are always perfectly cooked and I imagine them sous vide-ing the hell out of some eggs in the back. I'll admit that I have yet to try their soft serve ice creams.. Which feels blasphemous but I am usually stuffed by the end of the meal. One day I'll shovel that in my face too. I highly recommend the Brussels, spicy tuna squares, and the pork belly buns as an app!"}
{"text":"Worst food poisoning I've ever had. Really regret it at this point. Usually go there about 1-2 times a week but this last experience really ruined it for me."}
{"text":"Today I was very excited to have my first \"Gourmet Ramen\" experience and found the hype of Futo Buta to be promising. We arrived and although it was busy, seating was available immediately either outside or inside. Since it was such a nice day we sat outside.  Tables, chairs and individual umbrellas were very clean, as was the patio itself. Depending on which side of your table you sit on you can have a gorgeous view of uptown as well as the light rail as it zips by the Bland St. station on a regular basis.  Appetizers first: Me and my girlfriend decided to try two different steamed buns. We tried the Duck Confit w/ Leek & Arugula, and also the Pork Belly with Slaw. These were by far the best part of our experience. The buns themselves were very springy and just the right amount of moisture. Meat was cooked perfectly on both offerings, delicious flavor combinations. I wouldn't have minded just getting double orders of these!  Ramen was great too! I got the Tonkotsu, which had a very mellow earthy/hearty broth and featured pork belly and big hearty mushrooms. My girlfriend got the Miso ramen which also featured pork belly, a sweeter broth (not too sweet) and fresh crisp veggies. I will tell you that both dishes were VERY filling. Expect to get a to-go container! The prices on the ramen were a bit of a sticker shock until you see exactly how much you're getting.  The only thing I wish were more up to par was the service. Our waitress just did not seem to be with it today. Didn't come off as rude, just inattentive, going through the motions. As I looked at the waiter serving the other customers he seemed really passionate about service. This was really the only thing missing that would have made our visit a top-notch lunch experience. We will definitely be back and will update after the next visit!"}
{"text":"The staff was awesome but I'm not going to say too much about the food because I'm not too familiar with Ramen. The food wasn't bad but I thought the pork belly portion in the Miso bowl could have been a little bigger. I also got the Rice Crispy Squares; they were good, I probably would order them again if I happened to be there again but I probably won't crave them ever. I paid $27 for the Ramen bowl, Rice Crispy Squares, and a water. In my opinion I think the price was kind of high being that the Pork Belly portion was kind of stingy. Like I said I'm not a Ramen expert but I think I've had better Ramen elsewhere."}
{"text":"Once my co-worker and I found the restaurant (the address is very confusing to GPS aps!) we were very happy with Futo Buta.   The menu is small but that's great because it means what they offer is AWESOME.   We had some tough choices to make but we started with 2 apps to share:  the fried brussels sprouts and the Ori Kara Age, which was essentially small, fried bits of chicken over a bed of shredded cabbage.  But I'm getting ahead of myself.   The small, stacked bowl of brussels sprouts came out first, fried crispy, with sesame seeds and salt and some dark sweet sauce on top of them.  I know lots of people don't like these mini cabbages but DAMN, that's great, because there will be more for me.  I don't know how Futo Buka made these things so tasty I am just appreciative that they did.    Then came the chicken.  Crispy, salty, with a complex and interesting flavor the menu says is sea salt, ginger, fresh mint and lime.  They came with a spicy chili mayo sauce that rivaled the chicken in flavor complexity.  It wasn't just hot or just creamy.  It was both and more.  My best bite came when I grabbed some of the shredded cabbage with the chicken and dipped it in the sauce.   We both had ramen bowls as our entree.  I had the amusingly named Miso Hungry which was a miso broth combined with sweet white corn, smoked pork belly, scallion, bean sprouts, bok choy and an onsen egg. I am not ashamed to admit that I had to Google \"onsen egg.\"  It's a poached egg ball where the yolk is left runny.  In fact, the egg was barely cooked, barely holding it's shape floating in the soup.  I busted that sucker open and let the shreds of egg white solidify in the broth while the yolk dissipated into the broth, enriching it's already potent flavor.  This was the best miso soup I have ever had.  Everything about it was amazing. The pork belly was unctious and perfect. The bean sprouts were crispy tender in the soup.  All of it.  Perfect.   My coworker had the Shoyu (Good Enough) ramen and while I didn't taste it, she raved about it.  It came with smoked pork belly, bamboo, scallion, onsen egg, wakame, and roasted spring onion in a rich brown broth.    We were so disappointed that we stuffed ourselves and had no room to try the awesome sounding ice cream.   The place is small and was packed at 3 pm on a Sunday afternoon. The ambiance is hipster-chic but didn't have the snooty feel that I would normally associate with that.  We drank only water that was served in bottles on the table.  Service was prompt, friendly and prevalent."}
{"text":"My brother and sister-in-law who live nearby took me to Futo Buta after I shared my fondness for Asian soups that I'd tried in Washington state. I really enjoyed this small, but impressive location.  First off, the music selection ROCKS. SO NICE to hear some great rock'n'roll. I get tired of classic oldies, pop, and Muzak all the time.  Secondly, the staff is very cool. Our waitress, Jeanelle, was very hospitable and accommodating and checked on us often, but not too often.  Of course, the food was superb. Nothing like a hot bowl of tonkotsu to warm up with on a chilly November night. Arguably the best I've ever had. As for beverages, the sake menu is impressive, but the Hot Ringo is not to be missed! Sadly, the one aspect of this dining venue that we didn't enjoy was the crowded indoor dining area or the cold outdoor patio. This place has a lot of customers and is in desperate need of expanding in order to comfortably accommodate several dozen customers. Still though, they did provide some pretty warm heat lamps to keep outside patrons cozy.    Overall, a superb dining experience, as long as you don't mind sharing a table with strangers or dining outside. If so, then the food, music, and service are worth a visit."}
{"text":"The food is great and they gave me some gluten free soy sauce which was nice. Try the pork buns potstickers and fried Brussel sprouts"}
{"text":"I came here with high expectations since it's a popular place. The service was great, and the buns were delicious. My ramen was just ok. I ordered the miso, and it wasn't terrible, there was just no heavenly taste to it. My dad ordered the Chizu with poached chicken. I tried his and it was not to my liking at all, but he enjoyed it, which is all that matters. We sat at the bar which doesn't bother me the least, except when they put us at the end and my dad literally had to sit kitty corner since there wasn't much room. I think the seating bothered me the most, just wish there was more space at the bar to be relax and not stiff."}
{"text":"Nothing compared to the ramen we have at home in Sacramento but compared to other places that I have tried this one has been the best one yet. We sat outside on a nice sunny day. We wanted something good to eat before we got out our flight home so we yelped and found this place. My mom really enjoyed hers and I enjoyed hers more than mine as well, she got the fire & ice and I got the tonkatsu. The best thing we had there was probably the fried Brussels sprouts. It was simple but so tasty. I would go back there just for that. We wanted to try the ice cream because it looked amazing but the portions of the ramen were big. Our waitress, Stephanie, she was very nice and attentive as well."}
{"text":"I spent 16 wonderful months in Osaka, Japan and frequently enjoyed ramen there.  I am from California and frequently enjoyed ramen there as well.  When I moved to Charlotte, I feared never being able to eat great ramen again!  Thank goodness for this place!  The ramen here is top notch and so is everything else on the menu.  I have been here three times and each time was a great dining experience.  If wasn't determined to find every good place to eat in Charlotte I would probably eat here even more often.  The service is great, the food is great, and if you don't realize how much fun ramen can be, then you need to treat yourself to a culinary delight!"}
{"text":"I've heard this place is great and when my gf and I went there last weekend it was a nice experience, the food was good, miso was great, all the others things we got was ok.. nice place for a date lol"}
{"text":"This hit the spot on a cold day. They had a few vegan options which warmed my heart. The wait was lengthy (over an hour) but we went down the street to grab a beer instead of freezing outside while waiting. I had the niwa ramen with the eggplant and zucchini steamed bun and the vegan rice bowl (donburi). All three were very good but the ramen was amazing- hearty and flavorful. I would skipped the eggplant zucchini steamed bun in the future. Had a tokyo mule with ginger, mint and sake so refreshing and delicious. Prices were reasonable with great quality."}
{"text":"Futo Buta is one of my favorite ramen joints in Charlotte. I love that I can swap broths (since I don't usually like the meat-based stock) and the service is always top-notch. I've had the same waitress at least three times and she is amazing! She always remembers me and shares new specials or any changes to the menu in case I want to switch things up. I usually try to go at odd hours, not peak dinner or lunch times, because it does get very crowded and very loud."}
{"text":"Delicious creative menu, small restaurant near the light rail, and was initially hard to find but worth the search. The little pork belly sandwiches were amazing. The ramen tasted authentic, the flavors were layered I definitely would recommend this place."}
{"text":"Finally got to try Futo Buto last night and it did not disappoint. We went around 8pm on a Friday and waited only 5 minutes for a seat-however within 10 minutes there was a line out the door. We were seated at the bar. Keep in mind this place is pretty tiny, and you will usually be sharing a table with another party. However, they do have a nice sized patio with 2-4ppl tables.   We started with a mix and match of the pork belly and duck steam buns ($10). I'm not a fan of pork belly because I think it's too \"fatty\" tasting, but I have to say the pork belly bun was my fav. It had a spicy bbq sauce on it and the pork belly was cooked to perfection! The buns were 2-3 bite sizes so for $10 I'm not sure if I would order them again. Everyone and their mother around us were ordering the rice squares that looked awesome! Will try that next time.   For our meals I got the fire and ice bowl ($13) and my husband got the miso hungry bowl and added the spicy pork to it ($12+$2pork). The fire and ice was awesome until I tried my husbands! Wow the miso stole my heart! It was so flavorful and the spicy pork REALLY made it spicy, but not too powerful. The miso also came with an egg on top that was cooked perfect. The flavors were awesomely paired together!   After our meals I learned you can get the miso and sub the pork belly with salmon. In addition you can ask for them to make your bowl spicy or ask for the spice on the side. I will definitely be back soon and be ready to spice things up!   Ps. If you're watching your carbs you can get any bowl without ramen. I heard someone order that and instantly judged them inside my head LOL!!!  Word of the wise- get the noodles. yOLO!"}
{"text":"I went there at Sunday around 2-3 pm, waiting line for 2 was 30 min, but hostess call us in 15 minutes. The place are really small, but cool! A \"table\" where we were sitting was such small...The service was good, nice and friendly! Food...pictures looks nice and in reality it looks the same. We tried 2 different, probably, it was kind of soup, I attached pictures, and I am sorry but I didn't like it at all, especially noodles...Maybe it's not my style of food."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to check this place out for a long time.  This afternoon was our first visit - we arrived at 4:00pm and there was a solid 30 minute wait...  We all liked what we ordered but didn't love it.  I follow these guys on Instagram and they post a lot about their funky ice cream flavors so I was really excited to try some, when we got their the sign said they have fruity pebble and green tea ice cream so I was super stoked- when we order they were out of all ice cream :( and the sign was still there that they had the two flavors ...  so yes I was let down by the lack of ice cream :("}
{"text":"I have been to Futo Buta twice now and every time sadly I have enjoyed almost everything else and been a bit disappointed with my ramen. Is that so bad? Not really unless you are a ramen joint, which this happens to be. womp womp womp insert sad face.  The decor is really nice here. Lots of wood tones with huge anime influence (go to the bathroom if you don't think so). Service is very nice and peppy as well and very receptive to any requests or problems you might have as well! They were super nice when I brought my baby corgi along and set out a bowl of water for him to promptly knock over.  The first time here I started with shishito peppers which were great with their soy/sesame glaze and the random hot one really caught me. A very enjoyable dish. The fried brussels sprouts are very similar in the taste department though extra umami is imparted through the bonito flakes sprinkled on top. The three ramen entrees I've tried here are the Niwa, Miso, and Tonkotsu. The noodles are nice but they always taste more like soba to me than ramen? Are they buckwheat noodles? Who knows, the broth for the tonkotsu on my first time was super fatty. In fact there was at least a centimeter of grease on top of it. Luckily our server noticed my displeasure and traded out for the Miso which was much more tolerable. The second time I just went straight for the mild Niwa (vegan) ramen. Unfortunately this is lacking a bit of flavor and salt compared to the other two. I am not saying this while biased against veggies as I grew up with a vegan mom.  I think next time I'll eat the small plates and skip the ramen. The convenience is very handy for this place's location if you take the light rail and if you take the car then there is actually some handy parking in the nearby parking garage."}
{"text":"convenient location, tight seating (just like Tokyo ramen shops), fun, and good broth."}
{"text":"I finally made it to Futo Buta for dinner, and it was indeed as amazing as others have indicated!    Getting there - Unless you're walking down the rail trail, you are not going to stumble upon Futo Buta.  The address puts it on Bland Street - this is not accurate for driving purposes.  It's hidden from the main road (South Blvd.) behind Crispy Crepe.  Fortunately, there is a parking garage between Crispy Crepe and Futo Buta - but, you need to know where you're going, because you still won't see the restaurant before pulling in the garage.  It's a bit hard to find, but well worth the effort.   The venue - Futo Buta is small - I can see why there is often a wait to get in here.  (We went at 6ish on Tuesday and had no wait.)   There is a bar that seats maybe 8 - 10 people and then several communal tables and a very few private tables.  Even though you'll be sitting close to others, it has a distinctly romantic/intimate feel.  This is not a kid-friendly venue - it's really ideal for you and one other person.    The menu - YUM!  You have a selection of high-end sushi options, several appetizers and maybe 7 different types of ramen.  We started with the rice crispy square - which was blocks of crispy fried rice and a jar of spicy tuna served with wasabi soy.  Quite tasty.  We then had the Miso (Hungry) and Fire & Ice ramens.  The flavors were rich and warming.  We also had a flight of sake - the bartender was incredibly well-versed on the sake options and could help steer a pro or a novice.  Overall, Futo Buta delivered on every count. I came in with high expectations that were exceeded!"}
{"text":"I came here with a few of my friends and sister and we started off with some appetizers: shishito pepper, pork and scallop gyoza, chicken karaage, edamame with yuzu salt, pork belly buns (a must!) and rice crispy square (my favorite). All were excellent!  As for ramen, I got the miso ramen which was a bit bland for my taste but the noodles were perfect! It was soft and chewy. My sister got the fire and ice ramen but the broth was too salty.   This place is still new but I'll definitely be back again in a few months :)"}
{"text":"The inside of this restaurant is tiny, so be prepared to be packed in like sardines! But on a warm and sunny day the outside patio is a perfect alternative. The service we received was very informative and friendly. The ramen was excellent. Watch out for the very spicey Buta bowl. Do not order it if you are sensitive to hot foods."}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite restaurants in the Charlotte area.  The service is top notch.  We have been there so often they know us by face.  I encourage anyone who goes there to try the Brussels Sprout appetizers - in one word OUTSTANDING!  They are both crisp, fresh and sweet all at the same time. We also love the Rice Crispy Squares.   My go to is always the Miso.  It is a warm broth with fresh corn, bean sprouts, Bok Choy, pork belly and an egg.  It is delicious - pork melts in your mouth and the veggies, noodles remain crisp and delicious!   My husband gets the Buta Bowl it has a bit of a kick but never fails to impress!   Truly a great restaurant - worth the wait!  I love the traditional Japanese sitting - if not for that we would have never tried the Brussels Sprouts!   Great service, excellent food and reasonable prices!  Love that it's right off the train -"}
{"text":"My taste buds would be lost without this place. The closest I can get to my Japanese ramen meals."}
{"text":"Loved the tonkotsu with added spicy ground pork and ono chili sauce! So flavorful and everything was cooked perfectly!"}
{"text":"Waiting is ridiculous. They forgot about us. Although I was upset then because we waited for very long and didn't have lunch until 1 or 2, I understand why because it was lunch time. But forgetting about us really got me because i was very hangry. Though somebody did come out and apologized.  Food is great on the flip side. The pork belly bun is a MUST TRY. Ramen is good, broth is rich. The waiter who served us was extremely nice and helpfull."}
{"text":"Isn't it great to find someplace new that you just know you will have a craving for in the future? This is such a place. So different - so good. I just went there for my first lunch. I had the Chizu ramen with spicy ground pork. It's delicious! Just right - one step from the ledge on the edge of being too spicy. It comes in an bowl. I used a fork but many use chopsticks. It comes separated in the bowl like a cob salad. You mix it together and then dive in.  So good. Large enough portion to feed me for lunch (and I'm 210 lbs). Afterwards all I wanted was a nap.  I'm already craving my next visit. Now is the hard part, do I get the same exact thing or venture around the menu? Expect to pay about $18 for lunch with tip and water to drink.  I see where they also have soshimi - that would be a great dinner to have that as an app.  All good."}
{"text":"So. Damn. Good.  Our go to meal is the BBQ Pork Belly Buns and a bowl of Tonkatsu with poached chicken. It's my actual favorite meal in the city. Everything we've had here has been great so far. The atmosphere is cool too, dig the playlist and the staff rock band Futo shirts.  Pro tip, get here on time or go at an odd time. It's a full house within 10 minutes of opening on the weekends.   Also, if it's your first time know that it's a little hard to spot. Turn in on the little road (Rennsalaer Ave) by Crispy Crepe and park on the ground floor of the parking garage, then walk out towards the light rail, Futo will be to your right side before you get to the rail tracks.   Now go drown your hunger in some delicious broth!"}
{"text":"This place is magical. The pork buns are out of this world and every ramen dish is perfect and great portions. Perfect amount of spice and the chefs and wait staff were as friendly as can be."}
{"text":"Awesome food! Menu accommodates vegans and meat eaters and they usually have a good beer selection. Keep in mind seating is tight."}
{"text":"Hubs, fellow yelpers, and I visited this place when it first opened. We weren't blown away like everyone else. It was okay food and a little pricey for what you get. The appetizers are very small for what they cost. Hubs and I were both still hungry after we left! The inside is really nice and has family style seating which is nice for meeting new people. Overall, an okay place to eat."}
{"text":"so far I can only rate the strawberry basil ice cream but it was fantastic, and such a neat funky hipster place. Can't want to come back and try the ramen!! It looks amazing. Bigger than life!"}
{"text":"Finally!  I got a chance to visit a ramen house in the U.S.!  It's very similar to those in Japan but with better seating. I had the Shishito peppers as an appetizer which were very tasty. Then a pork belly roll (mini sandwich), also great. Finally the Totonku ramen which had the 20 hour cooked broth. It was meaty, fatty, and delicious. Perfectly cooked egg, not hard, but right at the point before hardening.   Sure it's not health food but hey, good food like this in moderation is OK. Life is nothing without its little pleasures. I'm very happy with my new little pleasure."}
{"text":"I was board and roaming South End. I heard of them thought a friend that I was suppose to have lunch with at Futo. So I stopped in. I am so happy I did. I was not disappointed. First off let me stated I'm an anime fan so base on countless hours of watching anime I have been craving good ramen. Thank God for Futo Buta it fulfilled my anime dream of ramen. The Ramen is so good. The whole menu is great. The sake selection is top notch and they Mexican Coke (I mean the soda, not the other, you know what never mind). Besides the drinks and main course, the Brussels sprouts and pork belly are to die for. Writing this makes me want some right now. Staff is always friendly no matter how busy they are. The owner always speak. I really do love this place and you will to when you try them."}
{"text":"Very creative ramen. Not as traditional but fun environment and good quality. Only problem is you do find the broth a touch oily near end of meal. Overall great service, fun style, creative menu. Fire and Ice ramen is really good!"}
{"text":"Went to Futo Buta tonight for the first time and the ramen was fantastic! The Brussels sprouts appetizers were great. The staff was extremely knowledgeable about the food and drinks on the menu. I highly recommend you try it. The staff is very nice, save room for the Desert the ice cream is worth the try! I lived in Okinawa, Japan so if I am telling you to give it a try you should!"}
{"text":"Love this place.  I lived in Manhattan for a few years and when I moved back to Charlotte, there were a few things I really missed and ramen was one of them.  Places in Charlotte just didn't have it or did and it wasn't the same.  This restaurant is turning the tides for restaurants in South End particularly. Extra bonus is that this is walking distance from my cycling studio and it's nice to have good food in my reach instead of so much bar food and fast food restaurants.  Try the rice crispy squares.  I don't love seafood or sushi, but these are awesome.  Those and the Shoyu Ramen (add spicy ground pork) are my go-to's."}
{"text":"It was our second visit. Both Ramen and Hiyashi were great! Next time we'd like to come for dinner to try their izakaya menu along sake :)"}
{"text":"I love Futo Buta, and I love their new southend location! The new location is quaint so be prepared to rub elbows with your neighbors and wait for a table if it's busy. At night or weekend, definitely be prepared to wait. The new location is right off the rail line, so it's easy to get to. Parking isn't available, but you can park somewhere in southend and walk to it.The miso ramen was absolutely delicious. The rice crispy squares appetizer is a MUST order. It is presented perfectly, but is a light and airy dish with the ahi tuna that you place on top of it.  Futu Buta means \"the fat pig\" so i recommend trying a pork dish! The low country smoked pork belly is to die for. The service was great, the food was delicious, and we left with full stomachs. The service was a little slow because of how packed it always is, but if you're enjoying company, what is their to complain about?"}
{"text":"If you stop here, you got to top your noodles order with an order of the brussel sprouts. Ice & Fire is one of my favorite dishes in this awesome corner!"}
{"text":"BEWARE-This place gets busy durring dinner.  The staff are high energy, kind and willing to assist you if its your first time. The sashito peppers appetizer is the best!"}
{"text":"Being new in town, our trip to this restaurant was our first time spent in south end. It's nestled in a corner retail space along the light rail tracks, accessible only by parking on the other side of one of the buildings and walking towards the blue line stop. I really loved the pedestrian only area along the rail trail which is surrounded by several restaurants and bars.   We ordered the miso (hungry) and the fire and ice ramen bowls. Coming from Portland, OR I have a somewhat limited experience with \"authentic\" ramen, but I did have a few favorite places out there that I went to often. I can't verify how authentic this place was or not, but I can say that we did both enjoy what we got.   The miso had a rich and fatty broth which was not overly seasoned as I sometimes find at other places. The pork belly was seared before being added to the soup, giving it a delicious charred flavor and a soft fatty texture. It was basically like thick sliced bacon cooked in a pan. The vegetables were a welcome and refreshing balance to the fattiness of the soup. The noodles had a great texture and I hear they're made in house from local ingredients.   We were fairly full afterwards so we decided to split one portion of soft serve. That day they had apricot with a chocolate drizzle. We both thought it was quite good and a nice way to cool down after eating a bowl of hot soup on a hot summer day. It had a nice smooth texture and wasn't overly sweet like some fresh ice creams can be.   As I hear this is basically the only specialty ramen place in the city I'm sure I'll be back soon for more!"}
{"text":"It's pretty good. As a person who lived in Japan and am very locked into what I loved about Japanese food...they have taken some liberties with what \"Japanese\" food is and played way too far outside the boarders for me. It's not bad but it's not Japanese. It's funny all the people proclaiming it's Japanese when it's an American's take on other American/Japanese restaurants. So hard for me to like this place after living in Japan and it's wrong to call it Japanese at all. Just because you use Japanese words....does not make you Japanese. Sorry guys. I think you had a good chance to be a great \"Ramen Stand\" but you missed the mark in my book."}
{"text":"A little sad the portions aren't the normal \"bowl the size of your body\" size but that's a little picky I guess and it isn't a reason not to try it out.  Really Good ramen. Okay prices."}
{"text":"4 stars bc it's a ramen place although the soup could have been more seasoned. The appetizers are small n a lil pricey but cute decoration n there's a bar"}
{"text":"Very good tonkatsu ramen. The karrage tasted really good but the pieces were a little small for me. I would enjoy bigger pieces of chicken. The service was fantastic and quick. No real complaints."}
{"text":"Fast service, cool and laid back vibe and awesome ramen bowls! I had the fire and ice bowl and it was very good. Looking forward to going back and trying the other ramen bowls."}
{"text":"Very nice relaxing, outdoor atmosphere,  next to the railroad,  not too much noise though. Hubby and I sat outside, we enjoy our meal. I had the duck something's and hubby had the pork belly noodle bowl. It was delicious. And price very reasonable. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"We are regulars here and never once have we been disappointed by the quality of the food. We are usually seated right away and always had good servers that checked up on us regularly. Price point wise, it is on the pricier side but because the food is good it is definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"We love eating at Futo Buta often with our kiddos!  We love everything!  Gyoza, tuna and rice krispy squares, chicken, asparagus, buns, ramen.  Everything!  Thrilled to have them in my hood!  Atmosphere is awesome too!  Finally some good food in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"I hope to bring awareness to our unfortunate experience at Futo Buta to prevent another disabled persons from having to be treated like we were.  We were treated with outright mean spirit and disrespect by our server, Abbey, who did not understand that a disabled guest could not sit on one of the restaurants high tables or on a barstool.  We arrived shortly after opening at 11 am and the hostess graciously sat me and my disabled lunch buddy at one of the tables with chairs and not the tall barstools. The physical limitations of the person I was with inhibit them from being able to sit on a barstool or at a high table.  The server, much to our surprise, started off her introduction by telling us that we would have to move to a tall table if it they got a rush. After pointing out the obvious and explaining to the server that my lunch partner was disabled and could not sit on a barstool (clearly!), the server repeated her introductory statement that we will have to move to another table if they got busy.    It is not clear why this was such an issue to the server or why she felt we should have to be moved.  We were the first customers of the day.  At this point, there was one additional customer now sitting at the bar. We were not in anyone's way and were not blocking anyone or thing.  We were taking up the same amount of space that any other two people would.  We would be happy to move if it was for a valid reason, but the server did not have one.  We just wanted to have a nice lunch.    We have never been treated with such disregard and disrespect.  I suggest the restaurant management ensure they have a good plan to accommodate individuals with disabilities, or inform disabled guests of your inability to do so.  If you do have plan, you should make sure your staff is aware of it.  Our sever was clearly were not aware and lacked any kind of sensitivity or understanding to the situation.  What a terrible, awful experience."}
{"text":"I have 3 allergies and there are very few items on the menu I can have, but the wait staff has been patient and persistent every time I come in and always helps me craft something I can eat."}
{"text":"The food was delicious. We loved the brussel sprouts, tuna rice squares, pork belly bun, duck confit bun, and the green tea softserve. Looking forward to trying the ramen next time!"}
{"text":"Environment: love the look and feel of this place. However, it is small as other reviews have highlighted, so seating is limited. There was a blown speaker playing loud music towards the back of the room. It was distracting, so I'm giving four stars.   Food: I got the fire and ice bowl and was amazed that my salmon was prepared medium rare! I was nervous ordering it at first, for fear of having to force over cooked salmon down my gullet. I was pleasantly surprised. Delicious. Fresh. But if you're wanting something spicy, either add it yourself or order something else entirely.   The pork bun was not undercooked. In fact, it was fluffy and very supporting of the pork belly, delicately nestled between hoisin sauce and sliced greens. Yum.  Crispy rice was good. Just be careful. That soy sauce they bring to the table with wasabi already in it can take you by surprise. Spicy but good!   Waitstaff: Our waitress was attentive and friendly. When our friend wanted a bit more kick to his bowl of noodles, she brought out three different kinds of spicy condiments for him. Having just moved here from Pittsburg, I would say she's doing one Hell of a job!"}
{"text":"If you want to know whether your date is adventurous bring her here! The tiny restaurant at the corner of lynx blue line station, we ended up waiting for an hour or longer on Friday nights for a table and didn't really have the patience to get in. However trying again on a weekday, boom we got a place inside immediately. After seating you realize how tiny the restaurant is! You could be rubbing elbows with the other guests.   The menu cannot be more apt - half dozen varieties of ramen and appetizers. Reading through the description doesn't really give out any visual cues. So I would say just go with a Ramen that contains your favorite protein. Another bizzare thing I noticed was there were more waitress than the number of guests. Our waitress was helpful but seemed really busy and running around. The ramens arrived quickly. Initially uncomfortable using the chopsticks but once your work the first few rounds, you would become adept at it. For a person who doesn't hand around much Japanese cuisines, the taste was new and interesting. May not suit everyone, one of my friend couldn't stand the smell of it and had our waitress to take it away. And glad that it wasn't billed. One pro tip I learnt was to mix your ramen thoroughly before slurping. We did also try the Japanese Fried Chicken - it was another interesting appetizer. The green tea Icecream was alright too.   Be sure to walk around (visit the restrooms!), there is some interesting art work and pokemon style Graffiti. Overall an interesting and daring restaurant experience, very tiny and gets crowded on weekends. I would recommend this restaurant just for the fun of it and to get a break if you have been bored of the regular cuisines."}
{"text":"I give 3 stars for this restaurant. It is not an authentic Japanese ramen restaurant. To be honest, when you walk into a Japanese ramen restaurant and see there is no asian chef in the kitchen, well, it is time to leave if you are a real ramen lover.  There are 3 main factors of a ramen: Broth, Noodles, Side dishes. The key of a good ramen is all about the BROTH! Without a good broth, the ramen cannot be good or even qualified as ramen. For this restaurant, I only want to give 1 star for broth(I tried the Tonkotsu). It's flavourless and it definitely makes the noodles flavourless either. When you enjoy a ramen, you want the noodle fully absorb the flavour from the broth and never want them in a seperated condition.   Secondly, the noodles are not bad, they have a springy texture. But the side dishes for ramen are pretty disappointing. In stead of adding traditional side dishes (bamboo shoots, bean sprouts) into ramen, they added some wired stuffs, like mushroom, pickled ginger into ramen. I understand their innovation or they just want to cater the locals' taste. But indeed, they make it worse and wired.  There are 3 highlights of this restaurant. 1. The atmosphere is pretty good. The place is well decorated and staffs are friendly. 2. Good smoked pork belly. It is qualified. It is flavorful, juicy and tender. 3. Impressive Green Tea Ice cream. Good flavour and it tastes rich in green tea and it has a silky and firm texture.  To make a long story short, this is not an authentic Japanese ramen restaurant. I will not recommend it to a real ramen lover."}
{"text":"I walked into Futo Buta expecting good food based on reviews  and pictures but the whole experience was beyond expectations, and I was blown away from the minute I walked in the door. I was greeted and seated right away and my server Jesse brought water and explained the menu, asked if I  had any questions and the whole time with a great attitude and a smile. The Shoyu Ramen I ordered was brought out promptly, even though the lunch rush was starting to build up. I've never had Ramen that tasted as good as it looked. The rainbow of flavors from the spicy ground pork, scallions, mushrooms, and a perfectly crunchy pork belly all came together to create an array of flavors that complimented each other and were absolutely delicious. This place has a great vibe. It's clean,  good ambiance, happy and courteous staff and it shows in the quality of their food. I will be coming back for more."}
{"text":"We had a friend order but was unable to eat because they were not feeling well. The manager came by asking if we were leaving soon. We had only just been served and most of us were almost done eating. He stated that seating was limited because it was a small restaurant and others were waiting. We had not been there for even an hour. I do not see how that was our problem. I have been here many times before and not had an issue. I will NEVER go back and tell others how poorly we were treated. It is quite unfortunate that the manager was completely unprofessional. He also stated that we are welcome to come back if we were all eating. Again completely unprofessional."}
{"text":"Do not ever go here without trying the Rice Krispie app. Sticky rice squares friend golden (but soft on the inside) and topped with spicy tuna and a seasoned soy sauce. The seasonal cold noodle dish with spicy ground pork and pork belly was also amazing. Awesome decor and great ourside seating. Definitely a must stop while in Charlotte."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times now, and the food at Futo buto is exceptionally good. Decently, large proportions. I had the vegetarian ramen option. It's delicious and really beautiful in presentation. We had their saki with our meal. They have a decent selection of drinks. To end the night on the right note, we had some of their soft serve ice cream. I had their green tea, strawberry swirl with honey soft serve. The host and the people working at Futo buto are super nice and helpful. One of my friends wanted to kick their ramen with a little spice, so the waiter accommodated him with red chili oil, chili powder and chili sauce."}
{"text":"Atmosphere was pleasant and I was seated promptly at the front bar. I was attended to and placed my order within a minute of sitting down. I ordered the Fire &I Ice ramen; the ramen bowl was absolutely divine. The noodles were cooked perfectly and the broth was delectably complex; built upon multiple layers of flavors, it left me breathless. I will be returning again soon to try more items on the menu!   Key Notes: Amazing Ramen Amazing Service"}
{"text":"Overall great experience. Place is tiny, so if going during peak hours expect to wait a little. Started with Sake. Wasn't sure what kind to get and was given 3 samples based on my preference for a dry flavor profile.  Ended up going with the Sunflower, which was great! Had the krispy rice as an app. Amazing! I would come back specifically for it! Finished with the miso ramen which was also very good! I will be back!"}
{"text":"Excellent new fusion restaurant with a small, limited menu for their soft opening process. You have to try the rice crispies, total mind blower! Very unique location right on the light rail in South End, just down the tracks from All-American Pub. Very quaint and cozy inside, with ample outdoor seating along the tracks as well. The ramen bowls are amazing, and the noodles are made from NC grown wheat. Can't wait to see what the full menu will entail!"}
{"text":"Best pork I have had and the appetizers are absolutely delicious. However, with having tried ramen in about 10-15 diff cities across the country, I think the broth itself is lacking flavor. Once the broth is perfected, everything else should fall into place. Great potential and apps though."}
{"text":"Came here for a late lunch on a Saturday!  It was awesome!  The broth is so rich and flavorful and the service is impeccable.  I had the Tonkotsu and the Shishito peppers.  Can't wait to come back and try the Rice Crispy Squares and the Pork Buns!"}
{"text":"Always great food and great service. Some of the best ramen around!! Apps are always good too, especially the brussels sprouts. Love to come grab lunch or dinner here. The ramen can be pricey, but totally worth it! Also the green tea ice cream is to die for!"}
{"text":"Nice quaint spot with a nice view of the skyline from the patio. We had the TONKOTSU and it was tasty, not amazing but good & well worth the cost. Added some of the chili oils for a kick. Great customer service as well. Everyone was friendly and attentive!"}
{"text":"First time here.  Staff was friendly and helpful when I walked in. It was early so there wasn't a crowd. My server recommended the Miso (hungry). I have to say, I was pleasantly surprised when it came out. The ramen and broth are made in house and it was simoly delicious! It's hard to find the restaurant unless you spot it from the light rail, as its tucked away on the backside of Post Southend. But definitely worth the visit!!"}
{"text":"This was my first time at Futo Buta and I love this spot!  I still eat ramen from a package from time to time .  But this place is amazing.  I ordered the Fire and Ice that had salmon, which was so tasty!  The owners were nice along with the wait staff.  The establishment is kind of small and a bit hard to find if you're not from the area.  Didn't get to try the ice cream because the machine wasn't ready....But I will be definitely going back!"}
{"text":"Got the rice crispy appetizer that was yummy then had the duck and pork buns, very tasty too. Sake flight topped it off perfectly."}
{"text":"I ma a ramen FANATIC! The pork belly in it is an amazingly ramen cherry on top! I def recommend it"}
{"text":"Ramen is meh, but the apps (fried chicken, spicy tuna rice squares, and whatever is on the board) are solid."}
{"text":"Super yummy and filling!!! We showed up around 6:30 and decided to sit outside which was an excellent spot for dog watching. I got the vegan Donburi with the sauce on the side (by recommendation of the waitress) Would definitely say order it that way if you have a medium - low heat/spice tolerance, but super tasty! Our waitress was super friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. We were served pretty quickly but it was getting pretty crowded when we were leaving around 8. Wish I lived in Charlotte, this would absolutely be a place I'd revisit!!"}
{"text":"My new favorite restaurant in Charlotte. The fried Brussels sprouts? Insane. The pork bun? Ridiculous. The Tonkatsu ramen? Perfect. Especially with the cloud of egg floating in there. I ate dinner here on Tuesday and wanted to go back for lunch on Wednesday. In fact, I think I'll head over there right now. Yum."}
{"text":"YES! Blown away by Futo Buta - so happy that I've discovered this fantastic addition to the Queen City food scene.  Interior is cozy and service was efficient yet friendly.  I thought this would be a great place for a date, but then realized slurping up noodles from a huge bowl of steaming broth might not be the best look for a first date.  Luckily a good friend and I decided to stop by for lunch and neither of us are one to judge.  Free parking in the Post apartment garage.  Brussels sprouts, pork belly buns, ramen and soft serve were all unbelievably tasty.  Keep up the great work Futo Buta, highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere is nice, it's a cute little place. My favorite item are the pork belly buns, which are pretty good if you like pork belly.   Futo Buta's ramen is pretty overrated for the most part. I can never finish my ramen because it is either too oily or not appropriately cooked (noodles tend to be undercooked).  I am giving this place 3 stars because I always feel like I've wasted my money on the ramen - I go because of the hype but I'm always left hungry and unsatisfied (like I could go eat somewhere else) at the end of my meal."}
{"text":"Had the Tonkotsu Ramen. I like the toppings and extra stuff, noodles had good texture, broth just tasted salty, no other flavor. Very small place, I loved the ambiance and the decor. Ice cream was definitely five stars! Definitely go back for it. A little pricey."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I tried Futo Buta last night for the first time and it was excellent!  We started off with the Shishito Peppers and Tori Kara Age (Japanese Fried Chicken; AMAZING!). For our entrees I ordered the Fire and Ice, and he ordered the Shoyu. I will say that I'm not a huge ramen fan to begin with but my boyfriend loves it. For dessert we had the Pumpkin Spice soft serve which I will admit I was not crazy about, but it was still good. The service was great, wasn't too pricey and it was in a great location! My favorite dish was definitely the Tori Kara, it came with a delicious dipping sauce and it was a great starter!"}
{"text":"Try to sit outside when you come; you're right on the light rail, so it's great for people watching. We came here for dinner and our waitress was great! We're from out of town and she had plenty of tips on where to go.  I got the vegan ramen bowl, and I would not get it again. But my friend got the vegan rice bowl and it was DELICIOUS. I would definitely recommend getting the sauce on the side, as it was pretty spicy so we only used about half of it. We also got edamame as an appetizer, which was very good.  I would come back again, but I would definitely order the rice bowl."}
{"text":"Yum yum!  Amazing little gem in Southend!  Why did it take me so long to find it!??  After nice long hot yoga session, I overheard some ladies chatting about this place so I decided to give it a try.  What better way to spend a cold raining night than with a nice hot bowl of deliciousness. I did take out and attempted to call ahead but the phone to the restaurant didn't seem to be working. When I arrived, I was immediately acknowledged by one of the servers, which was nice considering how busy they were.  The place is tiny so def not for large groups but absolutely a cute place for date night with a friend or boo!  I ordered the seasonal vegan butternut squash ramen, a ramen bowl for my husband with chicken and some pork belly buns... you know, for the ride home. My vegan ramen was super duper flavorful but a little too salty and I wasn't prepared for the thick texture of the broth but it was tasty.  My husband thoroughly enjoyed his ramen as well. The buns were tasty too but there was something creamy on them that I would probably next time ask that they leave off. Overall tasty and I am anxious to try more items on the menu"}
{"text":"YUM YUM YUM!  This place had a crazy long wait (in their defense we went Sat. night) but was worth it. Great Pho to share! Healthy comfort food.   A friend and I first shared an app- some yellowtailfish. Great sauce and flavors! Was super small but well crafted and unique- loved the grapefruit touch.  We then shared the seasonal pho- butternut squash. While it was fun to try something new and seasonal, I was a little sad to not be spooning in the standard egg and other pho tastes. Definitely recommend the seasonal still as it got me out of my comfort zone and was delicious  The server was sweet but a little behind- she definitely forgot our takeout request, but really hustled and gave great suggestions.   Great place with a good atmosphere and lovely food. Go here!"}
{"text":"We started with the Tonkotsu noodle and fried chicken. And also some special sushi they had.  Ramen broth was too salty and no other depth in flavor. And the fried chicken are like nuggets that were not at all special; sauce left a lot to be desired. The sushi was overpriced, like everything else, and had way too much going on. Couldn't taste the fish as they had so many other seasonings and flavors overpowering the fish - but then again that may not have been so bad, given the other flavors w the broth and fried chicken.  I wasn't expecting NYC-esque  noodle house, but close since it stated they make their noodles in-house.  Service was also slow. And it wasn't even crowded. We went on a late Sunday afternoon.  Overpriced and salty is what I chalk this up to."}
{"text":"Reasonably priced, cool atmosphere, and excellent menu. The menu is small but I think that's what helps this place thrive. It can be pretty hard to get a seat here on a busy night though so keep that in mind"}
{"text":"Again, Futa Buta delivers!! I crave this place on a monthly basis and look forward to eating my fill of some awesome ramen. I always order the miso, but every bowl is a solid choice. Tonkutsu is my next favorite; unique broth. If you're not in the mood for ramen apps and sushi are full of flavor too!"}
{"text":"Overview: Hipster, Tiny, Expensive, Nice Patio.  I hate this place with a passion, and I like ramen! I don't like the food here, to me it's bland, 3 slices of meat, an egg, some thinly sliced veggies in some salty grease broth with a 10 cent pack of ramen noodles. You get all that for the low price of $14.00. It's soup...for 14 dollars who wouldn't love that.  Now my wife and all her friends LOVE this place! Me and my friends don't get it. I will say that the patio is super nice. I have tried a few things off the menu and the thing I can say I actually like is the pork buns. Do I think two tiny pork belly buns are worth 10$ no, no I don't.   Service has always been great, but overall I think this place is all hype made by hipsters that think ramen ate in a tight space automatically makes it amazing. FYI, they don't carry any american beers either."}
{"text":"Best ramen I've had outside of Japan!!!!  Went with the traditional tonkatsu(no clue how to spell that),  such a rich taste.  Noodles were very stiff at first but after about five minutes or so all of the flavors had mixed and this dish was perfect.  I described what type of sake I like and the recommendation from the waitress at the bar was spot on.  I've found my winter warm up spot in CLT."}
{"text":"There is constantly a line out the door for this place - and for good reason! It's really tasty! Highly recommend for some yummy ramen."}
{"text":"Finally, a restaurant dedicated to ramen in Charlotte.  At this point the ramen fad is in full effect nationwide.  Most bigger cities have at least one or more ramen restaurants where hordes of hipsters can satisfy their noodle cravings.  Now Charlotte has its own and it delivers (figuratively, not literally......but here's hoping).  The menu is simple: apps, buns, noodles .  All are done very well.  Under the apps, the fried brussel sprouts are amazing as is the tori kara age, which is a Japanese fried chicken.  The buns are a take on dim sum style steamed buns that have a variety of fillings.  All of them are excellent.  And lastly, the noodles.  The first time I went, the waiter recommended the miso flavored ramen and to add the spicy ground pork.  It is so good that we have been back three times, and I cannot order anything different.  Great food, reasonable prices, and a fun atmosphere make Futo Buto one of Charlotte's most enjoyable dining experiences."}
{"text":"This was only my second time to FB, but by no coincidence second time in the past few weeks.  I could go on and on about the food because it's absolutely amazing, but this review is about my experience. Hands down the best customer service I've ever received, from the hostess, to the bartender, to the multiple servers that brought us our food.  But the absolute rockstar was our waitress.  Her name was Janeille, and she was the most knowledgeable, friendly, mindful server I've ever had, and I dine out a ton.  At one point I actually asked if she was the owner, because the amount of menu knowledge she had and enthusiasm for the restaurant was off the chart. I would open a restaurant tomorrow that centered around the sort of customer service our table received last night.    We didn't go 5 minutes without her coming to bus a plate, dirty napkin, glass, etc...as she said \"I hate dirty tables\"!  Dirty/unbused tables are my pet peeve.  Every server should train under Janeille. I'd go back to Futo just based on the food, which is out of this world.  The combination of food/service has me asking why I'm not eating dinner there seven nights a week."}
{"text":"So, if you've been following my reviews - you know that I use the word \"love\" a lot. But really - I love the Miso (happy) ramen bowl here. I crave it. And my wallet totally hates craving a $12 bowl of ramen. But it's delicious.  The first time I came in here was probably my favorite, it was middle of the afternoon, not lunch or dinner time. I sat at the bar, got to hang out a bit. The servers are very attentive and friendly. The music is loud. The other times that I've been here its been a little more busy, making the meal a little less relaxing than I like. The bar seating is extremely close, but maybe how its suppose to be? They have a community table in the middle, where you're told to sit across from whoever you're with - not beside them. This makes it a little tougher to have a meal when you're across the table and sitting next to strangers - but I'm friendly! So I made it work. They have fresh specials daily, a great little craft beer selection, and lots of items to choose from.  The food has been on point, every single time. I get the Miso (happy) bowl and totally fall in love. I could see this being a fun first date if you could go in the off hours. Sit at one of the little tables, try to look cool shoving ramen noodles into your mouth. I'll be back here, just not as much as I would like - because my wallet doesn't like expensive ramen nearly as much as my stomach does."}
{"text":"The food is amazing. Truly amazing. It is absolutely as good as it gets. It is expensive but in this place, you get quality and quantity, and it's absolutely worth it. The seating is a little less than desirable and if you aren't a fan of eating in close quarters with strangers, you're going to be uncomfortable. It sounds weird, but do not skip on visiting the rest rooms, even just to wash your hands. You'll be glad you did."}
{"text":"We drove around the block a couple times before we figured out where to park and where it was, but it was worth it.  The place was packed when we got there but we got our name in and were able to walk around the area for 20 minutes until we had a table ready.  We started off with the pork belly buns which I've been dying to try.  They were everything I hoped for!  The pillowy soft buns were evenly textured and delightfully fluffy.  The pork was full of flavor and juiciness, with burnt, crispy edges adding to the flavor and balancing it's tenderness.  Cabbage added a nice crunch and took off some of the heat from the sauce.  We split the Miso Hungry ramen (which is really not that easy to 'split' without making a mess).  The broth was flavorful but not too strong, allowing flavors from the other ingredients to really shine through.  I loved the sweet corn in there.  Gotta say the pork belly in this one was pretty skimpy.  In fact, I think all the additional ingredients were scant and wish there were more, but even when they are all gone the noodles are able to hold their own.  We finished with the soft serve, and got a twist of their two flavors of the night: Mango and Strawberry Banana.  I loved the presentation in the small cup with wooden spoons - reminiscent of Momofuku Milk Bar's soft serve! The soft serve was refreshing and light, but the flavors were very muted.  Couldn't really taste the banana, and the other flavors were also bland.  I was hoping to try the green tea flavor, but it wasn't available that day.    TLDR:  Get any ramen dish and the pork belly buns and you will be pleased."}
{"text":"Loved everything. My favorite was the pork buns. The fried brussel sprouts -OMG you think you hate brussels? Try these babies, you won't regret it. Had the miso Ramen and green tea ice cream. Both equally amazing and bursting with flavor. The only downside was that it's difficult to see/find. Would be good to have more signage if possible. But I am not going to rate lower because of that because the food was so good!"}
{"text":"Fantastic use of both indoor and outdoor space with a energetic atmosphere. It can get really loud inside, though. Food is overrated in my opinion. I do like the crispy rice and tuna, though."}
{"text":"This is a very interesting place.   New take on Ramen and very good.   Really tests your chopstick skills, I definitely needed a fork!! Very good food right on the light rail."}
{"text":"Food is amazing. I always go for the Miso Hungry ramen bowl. Large enough portions to share. The pork belly sticky buns are amazing as well. Only complaint is seating, this place is tiny!"}
{"text":"If you have been looking for a fancy-ish ramen place (similar to those amazing bowls seen in Chef's Table or any trendy food Instagram) this is THE place for you. It is by far one of the best restaurants in the Charlotte/South End area. I've been here quite a few times for both in-house and take-out and each has been great, although for take-out you do not get as much broth, but it is still worth it.   For appetizers, I would definitely recommend the Japenese fried chicken (in picture below). It is magically both insanely crispy on the outside without drying out the inside. The chicken is savory and incredibly juicy. It also comes with a semi-spicy ginger dressing that adds such a complex flavor to the dish. I have also gotten the fried red miso tofu skewers and I would recommend that as well!  For the main course, I am really surprised this bowl has not received more hype on Yelp. The Shoyu Ramen Bowl is my all time favorite (see in the picture below)!!! It is a chicken/dashi broth will amazing ingredients on top including bamboo, scallion, this magical tasting egg, wakame, onion AND MOST IMPORTANTLY their famous pecan smoked pork belly. You need to make sure that you try and/or add the pork belly on top of your ramen bowl when you go here, because you need to go here. My boyfriend always gets the Tonkotsu Ramen and is NEVER disappointed. Our friend recently got the Miso Ramen Bowl and he was by far mesmerized.   Considering they have so many great ramen bowls, I really wish they either did some sort of small pick two option or maybe had a \"Ramen flight\" where you could get samples of a few bowls to try. I would definitely love to try more of the options that they offer, however, I always end up getting the Shoyu Bowl because I can't go there and not get it. It is that addicting.   The only con for this place is that it is VERY small. I am by far surprised that they have not expanded to a bigger place yet as they could clearly fill it up. I would recommend for your first time either going on off hours or going on a nice day when you can sit outside.  I would highly recommend this place, as you will NOT be disapointed."}
{"text":"A foodie coworker of mine and I went for lunch on a Friday. She had been before, but it was my first time. Thanks to all of you who told me exactly how to get there because she and I met there, and I would've been lost! Park behind Crispy Crepe and walk toward the light rail.  I was the first one there at 11:30 (they open at 11:00), and I was immediately greeted and ushered into the small dining area. There are a ton of tables with umbrellas outside along the light rail, but it was muggy and I couldn't have mushroom hair the rest of the day. Our verrrry enthusiastic, verrry chatty waiter got me some water while I waited for my friend, and when he found out I hadn't been there before, he literally told me about every single item on the menu. Wowie.   For lunch, I got the pork belly bun ($10) and Brussels sprouts ($7). They were delicious, but the pork belly bun was only 2 smalls buns, and the sprouts fit on a tiny plate. With tax and tip, I spent $22 on lunch. What the what?! My friend was the same way. She got the Rice Crispy Squares and the eggplant and zucchini bun and spent $21 plus tax and tip. Let me repeat - ON LUNCH.   Although the food was good, I won't be in a hurry to go back til at least the lunch prices go down a little."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. Let me start off and say that my husband has spent a lot of time in Japan (and had his fair share of Japanese Ramen dishes), and he also absolutely loves this place. The flavor of the Miso is very authentic (with the added bonus of the pork!) The pork buns are also amazing (small and pricey, but worth it for sure). I haven't tried any other of their dishes (other than another ramen dish that was a special of the day), so I cannot comment on those, but I have heard good things about them.  There can be a wait (sign of good food!) at times, but if you go early enough, you should beat the crowd. Street parking is the best, and cheapest option, if you don't live nearby. (there is no parking lot for it)  The portions are large (in my opinion), and make for great leftovers! It is a little bit $, but it is definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"I love ramen and generally all noodle dishes, but especially the flavor of ramen. I still don't understand why there are so few ramen shops in Charlotte, but Futo Buta dominates this market.  I've been here a few times. It's a great location off the light rail which is how I usually get there. However, it is small and has some shared tables. Also I don't find the seating comfortable.    The food, however, is amazing. From sushi to buns to ramen to ice cream, It's all good. My suggestion is to start with pork belly buns. Great flavor in a soft bun. Then of course try the ramen. There's various types. My latest trip I got the hiyashi buta which are cold noodles. It comes with spicy pork, pork belly and an egg. The sauce comes on the side with this one so you get to pour the savory goodness all over the noodles yourself. The spicy pork made the dish for me. This is excellent for the hot Charlotte days.  The ice cream is small, but delicious.   I think the pricing could be brought down a little. It's not horrible, but ramen in other cities costs less. I just look at it as I'm treating myself.   Service is okay. They always seem busy. I've been in for dine-in and carry-out. For carryout, there was a group of us, but they took orders for one person, then took care of a table. Then a different person would take the next order. Overall, it just seemed rushed with no time for pleasantries.    However, if you have the craving for ramen, this is a very good option!"}
{"text":"Arrived in Charlotte and knew I wanted to check Futo Buta out. Sadly, with a busy schedule it took 3 days before I could actually get here with numerous attempts on trying to trek out on previous days. Top it off with the weird parking situation which confused us out of towners and a little hike to get to the restaurant made for a very distraught traveler. So you have to be something to literally turn a frown upside down.  We came in, no one really gave us any info on what to do, no signs off the bat to say seat yourself (not that we saw immediately??). A group came in after us and promptly seated themselves so we followed along. And that's were grumpy town ended. From the waitstaff to the food to the impromptu double rainbow outside. I mean, it was a great way to end a very stressful work weekend.  What we got: Eggplant buns - Good. Not my favorite of the things we ordered but being a veggie bun I cannot complain! A bit greasy.  Duck confit buns - Yes, yes, yes! Would order this again and definitely recommend. Greasy as well-- but so good.  Tonkotsu - I think it was good? I didn't order this, and the friend who did didn't complain/said it was nice. Looked like a good traditional ramen.  Niwa - This was interesting. Probably the prettiest of the three we ordered. Lots of veg, a peanut-y and savory broth. Might consider this for myself if I ever come here again.  Fire and Ice - Can't go wrong. Bit of dashi and a sweet gochujang coupling. Pretty presentation. I imagine this wouldn't be as preferred for ramen lovers who prefer their ramen on the salty side. Underneath the fresh veg was a treasure--- delicious glazed salmon on a bed of nice noodles. Would be a tough contender for round 2!  Waitress was super nice to us and I appreciate the energy. Plus we all kinda ran out (some of the staff included) of the restaurant right after we ordered to gawk at a double rainbow. Was a really awesome experience.  If you need your spice they have several options available too!  Parking-- There is street parking a little ways down from the restaurant and supposedly a parking deck. We couldn't find the deck for it until after we left. Either way we had to do a little bit of walking. Really nice area though. If you're from Atlanta-- it's a lot like our Beltline but add a train and more trees.  Atmosphere-- The restaurant is a little cramped. We were lucky to find seating, but they also have a patio. Very cool aesthetic overall.  Anyways, thanks for the awesome end to my trip Futo Buta!"}
{"text":"Amazing food. We enjoyed the fire and ice and miso ramen today. They both were delicious. If watching salt intake just beware like all other restaurants the food was salty but it was delicious. The server was good at bringing over more water and giving suggestions for Ramen. The check in process was great and was quick to bring back for table. During the winter months, the patio is not set up so it is a very small restaurant. We only waited about 20 mins for a table for two. Due to the small restaurant we had to sit side by side in a bar situation which was convenient and allowed them to sit plenty of people. Great restaurant and staff. Will be going back in the spring to enjoy the patio."}
{"text":"Futo's bowls are beautiful, the staff is friendly and accommodating.  Although I wasn't bowled over by my bowl it must be said I don't eat beef or pork. Hence, my ramen of choice probably wasn't the choicest (or the best they have to offer). I did devour the shishito peppers. And they are nice to dogs. Thumbs up Futo's."}
{"text":"This is now one of my favorite places to eat. The Rice Krispie treats with tuna are amazing. Another top choice was the brussel sprouts. Great energy, amazing staff and addictive food. What more could you ask for - well maybe more seating."}
{"text":"An ode to ramen:  Oh ramen. Oh ramen. How I love you so.  Soft swaying noodles in a salty, savory broth.  Pork belly like butter.  Soft centered egg on top.  You've stolen my heart and my wallet."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this place for months. I had heard great things about Futo Buta, but I have to say that I am underwhelmed. The place was hard to find and once we got there we realized how tiny it was. The wait was about 30 minutes. The smoke pork belly buns were really good. It was $10 for two small buns with a piece of pork each. I ordered the Niwa ramen and it was okay. I had to add in the ono chili sauce to give it a little heat to it. The taste of the broth was pretty good but the ramen noodles weren't that great. The broth was a bit too greasy. I ordered my little boy the \"little noodle\" and it was wayyyy too greasy and super salty (almost inedible). My fiancée ordered the Miso ramen and his was salty and greasy as well. We had to stop by Chick-fil-a to get something to eat afterwards. I guess at the end of the day we can say we tried something new, but I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"The. Best. Ramen. Ever. Really, everything on the menu is the best. I don't even know what to say because I'm drooling just thinking about this place. Hands down, a strong contender for my favorite place in all of Charlotte. The chef is a genius and an artist."}
{"text":"The rice crispy squares and tori kara age was amazing. My fav ramen is the Tonkotsu but all are pretty great. They allow you to sub out items that are not your favorite. Love this food!!  Side note: It is Way to LOUD!! It's not a dance club or a sports bar."}
{"text":"OKAAY FUTO BUTA! My first experience here wasn't so good but I got to say I'm so impressed this time! I had the fire & ice ramen and it was sooo yummy! The salmon was marinated perfectly, and the ramen wasn't over salted like last time. I also saw that they added a lot of new things to their menu since the last time I've been here, everything looks so appealing lol! We ended our meal with the black sesame icecream- oooo it was so rich & creamy and I could taste the \"black sesame\". WELL DONE futo buta I'm so shooked! Wished I came back again sooner, because I can't wait to come again & try everything on their menu!(:"}
{"text":"A very hip place tucked away and not easy to find. The place is a bit small and noisy but the food was very good! The menu has some very interesting and creative raman options. I recommend trying to find it, you won't be disappointed once you do!"}
{"text":"I've had a lot of ramen in my day, this was easily at the top. I came in on a very busy night, but the staff was great. Ramen was amazing. Couldn't have expected any better. 10/10 would eat again"}
{"text":"First time here. Staff was very helpful. Music was a little loud for late lunch,but didn't interfere with conversation. Pork buns were delicious and both ramen dishes were very tasty. Tried the black sesame ice cream.  Overall very happy with our meal. Will definitely go back soon!"}
{"text":"The first time I came here I really didn't get it.   It's growing on me now... and I think getting to know the owners and the master ramen maker made all the difference.  I have a new appreciation for what's going on here. It's a great concept, but the space isn't comfortable at all - I don't think it's supposed to be.  It's a fast noodle joint in tight quarters with loud music.  And in that sense, it's kind of authentic to what Japanese noodle spots are like.  Futo Buta's recipes are solid, everything including the ramen noodles are super-fresh, and you'll be more than satisfied when you leave.  I personally enjoy the vegetable broth.  The pork and pork belly are very rich (but awesome).   We love the decor and were impressed with the creative wall murals, nice pottery used in service (made specifically for this place). If you are not sure about this place after the first time, try it again at a less busy hour.  Worked for me.  I love it!"}
{"text":"I moved to LA from Sydney about 10 months ago. I never realized how awesome Sydney's ramen scene was until I left it. This little Charlotte hole in the wall ramen place is truly the best ramen I've had since I came to the US, certainly more than any place I've visited in LA (and I LOVE ramen). A delightful surprise! I got the miso ramen with extra chilli"}
{"text":"While the food is good, but got stomach cramp and diarrhea later that night after. Maybe this place is not that clean."}
{"text":"Having been to japan I've tasted a lot of different kinds of ramen, so I came here with pretty low expectations. Of course you can't compare to Japan's, however Futobuta's ramen was alright. When I came my broth although deep in flavor, was not salty enough. Also they gave me siracha as a side to add to my ramen, no Chile oil, no sesame oil, or seasoning. For 14 dollars, I definitely did not get my money's worth in my opinion. The atmosphere is nice and it has a hipster-ish feel to the place, but ramen wise, I'll pass."}
{"text":"A very pleasant surprise. My date and I had no idea they were a restaurant I thought it was a ice cream shop, (marquee in front was advertising ice cream)then the hostess talked  us into eating there and we were so glad we did. The rice crispy squares were awesome follow by the fire and ice ramen. (Smoke salmon kimchi sauce cabbage radish and more).  Ordered a flight of Sake which was just enough for two. A little hard to find but the prize at the end of the trail. Our waitress Janeille was a joy!"}
{"text":"Great experience for my first time at a ramen place. Went with a friend and tried the crispy rice square appetizer, miso ramen, salmon rice bowl, and strawberry basil ice cream. Everything was great. The ramen is definitely the better bang for your buck, however the crispy rice appetizer was our favorite!"}
{"text":"After my 3rd visit I was ready for a little review. Wonderful ambiance even though the place is really small but it's definitely worth the wait. The bar tenders/wait staff is very friendly and give you recommendations of what you might like to try if you've never been there or never had ramen before. My favorite stuff were the pork buns and the fried rice with tuna but the main dish takes the cake, get them all!!!! Specially the one with pesto and pecorino and add salmon to it."}
{"text":"To think that you will walk away from Futo Buta with leftovers is laughable. I've been waiting for a ramen shop to come to Charlotte that can rival those in LA and those that I have been to throughout my travels in Asia, and Futo Buta is that shop. Let's start with the broth, since that's the foundation of any successful ramen shop. Futo Buta has a creamy beef broth that smells like pickled ginger and a generous amount of sesame oil, and has a nice heat that sits right at the back of your mouth and warms your entire soul. The noodles are buttery with the right amount of chewiness and the toppings... get the pork belly... it melts in your mouth and it's incredible.   What else do I need to say about Futo Buta? Just that their staff makes you feel like you're a valued regular, even though this was my first visit! I will absolutely be returning and cannot wait to try their specialty plates. For those who want to try, which I hope you do, make sure to park in the public garage under Post's apartments and then walk to the light rail. It's Charlotte's little hidden gem that offers an alternative to the abundance of southern comfort food in South End."}
{"text":"I live in the South End area and love Ramen. I was so glad to find this gem located conveniently on the light rail (bland st. Station) on the way home from work one day. I asked the host what the most popular dish was and he pointed out the Miso Ramen and suggested I add the spicy pork. I did exactly that and tried the pork belly buns as well which were great. I've been a couple times and they have great seasonal specials such as small plates and even different ice cream flavors. Hoping more Korean Fare comes to Charlotte!!"}
{"text":"It is a Ramen and Saki restaurant with really fresh sushi. The small plates and steamed buns are good as well. The must try is a fried rice cake that is served with macerated tuna. The ramen is awesome. We have tried the pork, salmon, and miso and loved all of them. The saki menu well thought out and diverse. More seating outside than in and right on the Blue Line.  The two flavors of soft serve that rotate frequently."}
{"text":"Tonkotsu extra noodles. Mmmmmm. We used to come here weekly and were among the elite pigs that ate the whole bowl in 5 minutes. The patio provides the best seating. Puppy friendly as well."}
{"text":"This is a great South End neighborhood restaurant.   Location/Atmosphere: My husband and I live walking distance to FB. So we really like the location. It's right on the rail trail and there is a light rail station that stops right there. I believe there is a parking garage near by that you can park in, but do not quote me on that as I have never actually driven to this location. The restaurant itself is pretty tiny on the inside there are 2 long tables that people can sit at and then bar seating along the window. It's very cool looking on the inside. It has a very industrial look with exposed ceiling and lots of wood and steel. There is an opening to the kitchen where you can see the magic happen! We have never actually eaten inside. On the outside they have a decent amount of walk way seating with umbrellas in the summer and heaters in the cooler months. We really like eating outside because you can have your own table as opposed to inside you are sharing the table with many people.   Food/Drink: The food is great! I've only had one dish that I wasn't crazy about (more on that later). We like to start our meal off with an order of the Rice Krispie Squares: spicy tuna, crispy fried rice, wasabi soy. If you have ever been to Nobu and had the Crispy Rice with Spicy Tuna... the Futo Buta one is even better! I know, crazy! It's plated beautifully too. We typically order the Shoyu: chicken and dashi broth, pecan smoked pork belly, bamboo, scallion, onsen egg*, wakame, roasted and julienne leek. I have chicken added to it. It's really tasty and the portion is huge. I can never finish it all which is unfortunate because in my humble opinion, Ramen doesn't make the  best left overs. Soggy noodles :( I wish they had a half portion option! The chicken they add to the Ramen is delicious. Always white meat and always cooked perfectly. We decided to get takeout one night and I accidently ordered the Chizu: chicken broth, pecorino cheese, whipped egg, shiso pesto, yuzu, black garlic, scallion. This was a mistake. The Chizu is the \"buttered noodle\" of the Ramen world. It was really sub-par. I've ordered wine here before, but I know that they have sake, beer and cocktails.   Service: The people that work here are always kind, prompt, and accommodating. It's part of the reason we keep coming back!  Price: Most Ramen dishes are priced between $12-$14, we typically add a protein which costs another $5. A $20 entrée is what should be expected because even if you are only adding extra veggies/sauce, there is $1-$2 per veggie/extra sauce charge.  Notes: Get here early! The line can be crazy. During the winter months, definitely come early because outside seating won't be an option.   We always enjoy coming here, are always treated well and never leave hungry!"}
{"text":"This isn't your Ramen from college. Amazing!! The brussel sprouts are an absolute must. If you like sushi grade tuna then get the rice crispies. WOW. Not a bad thing on the menu in the 2 times I've went. The staff is very attentive and helpful. 10 out of 10 recommend. Also, some nice beer selections including Sapporo on tap."}
{"text":"Futo Buta, while sporting a hip and trendy facade, is a major let down in terms of food. They're just like every other cookie cutter restaurant trying to make traditional Asian cuisines be \"cool\" or \"unique\" but falling painfully short.  My party came late Sunday night only to find the restaurant packed with people. While not exactly counting as points against them, we ended up waiting 45 minutes for a table. Plus, with close to freezing temperatures and a crowded inside, we had to wait outside with no working heaters.  When we were finally seated we were quickly greeted by our friendly server and given water. After waiting for so long, we already knew what we wanted: the brussel sprouts appetizer, two tonkotsu ramen, and two miso ramen. The atmosphere certainly felt like a traditional izakaya with their shared wooden benches and warm inviting lighting despite the gaudy and slightly insulting poorly drawn anime characters around and inside the bathrooms.   Shortly after ordering we got our brussel sprouts appetizer. It came out on a small square plate in a pile with bonito flakes and tako yaki sauce over the top. In terms of flavor, it was almost synonymous with the toppings of traditional tako yaki, but in a char grilled brussel sprouts medium. Overall, not bad and unique, but not amazing.  When we received our ramen, we were very impressed! They looked great, although the portions seemed a little small. However, when I first tasted the tonkotsu ramen I was shocked... shocked at how unbearably bad it was. The flavor was flat and lacked the depth and creaminess normally associated with tonkotsu ramen and was insanely salty. The egg was poached rather than hard boiled, and there was no fish cake or normal accoutrements. The only saving grace was the pork belly, which had a nice barbecue flavor and meaty and wonderfully fatty texture. After asking the waitress if it were normally this salty, she said yes and that next time I should just ask for it less salty. Well, needless to say after waiting 45 minutes and paying $14 for this mediocre portion of salty ramen, I painfully suffered through the bowl. With each spoonful, rather than wanting to slurp down the soup, I meticulously drained as much broth from the noodles as possible to avoid the jarringly salty taste. Well, after only a handful of those painful spoonfuls of broth, I was surprised to find that I had run out of noodles, leaving me yearning for more food... but sadly, not from Futo Buta.  Overall, I'd say Futo Buta aims for something higher than what they can deliver. Their atmosphere, prices, and appearance denote great food, but the taste of their staple tonkotsu ramen turns all the positives upside down. WAYYYY too salty, bland, and expensive. While service was adequate, no one likes to wait 45 min for bad food, and no one likes o be told that their tastes are not correct with the norm of the food; tastes that this particular reviewer has refined after eating some of the best ramen in the world in Japan.   If I were you, I'd avoid Futa Buta as their only redeeming quality is their braised pork belly, and barely redeeming from a 1 star at that..."}
{"text":"Excellent vegan options! We ordered the shishito peppers to start and had to slow ourselves down from crushing them too quickly.   We ordered the vegan rice dish and the vegan ramen. It's hard to decide which one was better!  Both dishes came with a pop of fresh sprouts and veggies over perfectly cooked rice or noodles. The flavors were wonderful.  I don't know what kind of mushrooms they used but they were the star of the show!  Make sure to drink lots of water later because they are generous with the salt in all 3 dishes."}
{"text":"Even though I'm new to the Ramen craze, I'd like to consider myself a professional ramen connoisseur. This was my first time trying Futo Buta and it definitely will not be my last!   When it comes to ramen my primary concerns surround spiciness and substance. I like ramen that has multiple ingredients (or at least the option to add/change ingredients) and it needs to have a kick! The Buta Bowl not only met those requirements but instead exceeded all expectations. The Buta Bowl priced at $18, is the largest portion size bowl offered and contains: chicken and dashi broth, double noodle, pecan smoked pork belly, duck confit, spicy pork, ono chili sauce, sweet white corn, leek, scallion, cayenne pepper threads, onsen egg. The spice which can be requested on the side is the perfect combination of heat, sinus clearing and flavor.  The restaurant has a modern/trendy vibe which according to my friends remains busy at all times everyday. The space is small and many tables have you rubbing elbows with neighboring guests. I would not recommend this location for an intimate dinner, unless your comfortable having people listen in on your conversations. but besides the lack of space the place is GREAT!   The restaurant is located in South End area of Charlotte, NC directly touching the light rail across from popular bars Oak room, All american pub and Hot taco. The restaurant has no direct parking but has multiple pay for parking lots nearby and if your lucky some free street side parking."}
{"text":"If you only have had ramen back in the college dorms- prepared to have your mind blown!  This place is legit!  The fire and ice is my go to ramen here.  It is smoked salmon and veggies in a rich/delish kimchi broth- it is so good I cannot get myself to try anything else here.  The go to app is the Rice Crispy Square.  It is a jar full of sushi style spicy tuna served with fired rice squares and is amazing.  Def on my must try list!"}
{"text":"Had a fun date here on a Friday night just as a massive storm was coming in. Even with everyone packed inside like sardines people were polite and more than happy to wait. The location is great, just tucked away with a nice outside patio. The rice crispy squares with raw tuna are amazing with a nice little kick. Low Country smoked pork belly has to be one of the best in Charlotte. The MISO (HUNGRY) is full of flavor and fun to eat with chop sticks."}
{"text":"I have eyed this place since a month before it opened. I finally got to experience it for the first time, what, 2, 3, years later? It was worth the wait from the taste but I do wish I had come sooner. Their top ramen was delicious and the Brussels sprouts were incredible. You must try the Brussels sprouts. My only wish is that they would open a second location or move to a bigger one. I crave broth based items when it is cold, but waiting  outside 45 minutes for a seat because there is so little space just isn't happening. Good thing I just learned they do takeout!"}
{"text":"Finally got a chance to come here with my son for ages. Was not disappointed. Other than the crowded conditions (which comes with a smaller place), the rest of the experience was not less than amazing.  Stared off with a glass of sake, which the bartender handed me a info card showing all information about the sake. Very nice touch.  The appetizer (or izakaya) was Fried red meal tofu skewers. Two skewers with three pieces of tofu on each, coated with a spicy red miso and sesame seeds.  The ramen bowls for each came next and they did not disappoint. I had the Buta Bowl, a spicy mix with smoked pork belly, duck confit, and spicy pork. Incredible flavor combinations the wonderfully changed with every bite. My son had the Fire and Ice, a kimchi and dashi broth base with smoked salmon and assorted vegetables. The little that I had ( my son devoured it quickly) had just enough heat from the kimchi to notice, and the beautiful smoky flavor from the salmon topped the flavors wonderfully.  Finishing off the experience was ice cream, green tea and honey for my son and I had the cinnamon and fig.  This is somewhere that I with most assuredly return to at the earliest time to see what other delights I can discover there."}
{"text":"Awesome staff!! Very nice set up as well. Food was great and servers were so sweet and knowledgeable. Being the only vegetarian in my family can be hard at times, but they had vegan options. I got the vegan ramen and it was so good! The rest of my family loved what they had as well. If we are back in Charlotte, we will visit again."}
{"text":"This place was good, food was good- kind of plain, I give it a 4 star because it was a good atmosphere and the service was alright. The only bad thing about it is that it's a small building and the wait is stupid long. Would I go again? Yes but it wouldn't be my first choice."}
{"text":"Off the Bland light rail stop, Futo Buta was anything but \"bland\". Wow. Started with the Rice Crispy Squares (crispy fried rice, dipped in wasabi soy, topped with spicy tuna), flash Fried Brussel Sprouts (sweet soy, sesame, bonito, sea salt) and a Black Can sake flight. Ended with Ramen bowl, more than Shoyu \"Good Enough\" (pecan smoked pork belly, bamboo, scallion, onsen egg, wakame, roasted spring onion). Only wish I saved room for the Basil Strawberry soft serve before the walk home. I'll be back. Thank you Brittany for the recommendations!"}
{"text":"Went here the first weekend they opened and forgot to write a review.   The space is decorate my fabulously: simple, sleek. The service was extremely friendly.   We started with some edamame and beers. We both ordered ramen: I with the vegan and my boyfriend had one of the pork belly ramen selections.   He said that his was delicious and can't wait to go back. The vegan ramen was pretty good - missing a little salt/a little too much onion flavor...but still very yummy."}
{"text":"Not sure why this place is rated so high. I wasn't impressed by the food. Tonkastu ramen broth was super greasy, bad flavor, and not hot enough. The bun was not fresh and fulffy. The table is tiny, so you need to move your food all over the place while eating.  but giving the Pork bun filling is very delicious, I would give this place another try later. Perhaps, I can try ramen in another flavor and ask for extra hot broth.  Love their bowls and dishes tho,  very nice quality."}
{"text":"The BEST comfort food you'll have in CLT especially if you like noodles. The biggest beef I have with this place is that it is always crowded"}
{"text":"loved the pork buns! love the ramen. I've eaten ramen in tokyo.  its good here!"}
{"text":"A comment from a noodles expert and a decent ramen lover: if you are expecting  a bowl of ramen that tastes good like how it tastes in Japan, this isn't the place for you. Their tonkotsu ramen had no flavor other than saltiness. The noodles had a wired texture. It's definitely the worst ramen I have ever tasted. However I'm giving them 2 stars because they were using really good quality ingredients. The purpose was good. The result was not. The fried chicken was ok. I'm attaching a picture of ramen I made by myself to prove my expertise and the honesty of my comment."}
{"text":"I was not a huge fan of this place other than the outdoor seating and drinks. The food was a little too eccentric (not sure that is even  the write word to use), but I didn't even finish my meal. The drinks were delicious and I love that there is outdoor seating right on the light rail. It definitely will not be on my list of places to go again."}
{"text":"I'm a ramen lover. So I'll search for it wherever I travel. First I have to say I'm surprise to find this place in Charlotte. Location is good. Only 15 mins walking from the convention center. I ordered the Fire & Ice. The surprise was definitely the salmon. It is half cook and still a bit cold over top of the hot ramen. I guess that's why they call it Fire & Ice. It is my first time having salmon ramen and it is definitely a present surprise. Will definitely come back again to try other dishes in the future!"}
{"text":"TL;DR - Incredible food. Oddly small portions. Insanely-high prices. No unsweet tea. Tips?  It's always a shame to me when a place with clearly stellar food gets outshined by other factors that just aren't thought out.  Futa Buto is a place with \"go out of your way\" food, perfect charm and a tucked-away location which make it a great place to grab some Asian comfort food any day you want to decompress.  The confusing part here is that once you taste the food (sans ramen), you're left wondering when the rest of it is coming. Tapas-size food is great, but it has to come to with tapas-size prices. Asking $10 for two pork buns the size of a credit card isn't reasonable to earn a return trip. However, if they were $6, I'd probably OD on these.  The wallet-zapping madness continues with $12 ramen bowls and $10 small plates. Somehow this place is listed as $$ but it's easily $$$ when you get a decent meal.  Then no unsweet tea (but having sweet tea) is so confusing I can't even wrap my head around it.  Finally, this is a place setup like Chipotle, but the staff is so great that they wander around and ask if you need anything, which makes the tip line on the check uncomfortably confusing. My solo lunch experiment to this wonderful eatery somehow ended up as a $32 lesson.  I wish I could say I'll be back, but I'll have to rob a trust fund first. The food is so good though, that hold on, I'll BRB."}
{"text":"Best ramen in Charlotte!!!!! One of my favorite places for dinner. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great ramen! Only been here once and it wasn't busy so that was a plus for me and my fiancé because we love trying a new spot every weekend. Definitely recommend this place. Oh, and the green tea ice cream is on point!!!"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times since they've opened. It's not the best ramen I've had but it's not the worse either. This place is a bit hard to find for the first time since they aren't located off the street where you can see like crispy crepe. Instead it's right beside the light rail.   I got the seasonal ramen this time called Hiyashi and I would not recommend it at all. Instead of broth it's ramen noodle tossed in a vinegar ginger soy dressing which would be fine but the noodles were drench in the dressing so much that almost half of my bowl was filled up with the vinegar. Stick to the regular ramen with soup.   I also got their swirl soft serve which was half matcha and half blueberry. It was really good epically the honey drizzle on top of the matcha side. The blueberry side was more tart than sweet."}
{"text":"Two thumbs up! Pork belly buns. Fire and Ice ramen bowl. Saki Flight. All were amazing! Service was good."}
{"text":"Excellent an quick! I came from Maryland for the weekend an I was craving some ramen an it's what I expected. I've had ramen all over DC an this place was up there with the best of them!"}
{"text":"The food was great but it was what happened after I left that made me a fan for life. I was visiting from out of town and left my iPhone in the restaurant. I did not realize this until I got back to the hotel. I had no way of getting back to the restaurant since my Uber app was on my phone! The front desk of the hotel called the restaurant, who had located my phone. Long story short -Julia, the assistant manager dropped my phone off at the front desk after the restaurant closed! I cannot thank her enough for her amazing customer service. She took a stressful situation (did I mention my license and debit card were in  case pocket on the back of my phone) and was the Good Samaritan I needed. Thank you!"}
{"text":"This place is my go to for lunch or dinner, on my own or with family. The noodles are always awesome, the best in the city. My kids are crazy for the gyoza, rice crispy squares, and fried chicken. Staff is always friendly and efficient.  My only complaint is that I live too far away."}
{"text":"Futo Buta's dishes has a very casual asian fusion approach, which I really like. We both ordered the ramen (can't remember the names of it but it was the first and the third one on the menu). I opt for the pork broth instead of the chicken and it was very thick and flavourful. The pork belly was amazing!! It had the right texture and amount of fats. For dessert, we each had the mango and green tea soft serve. I would say it's a little pricey for something so simple but it was a refreshing end to our big servings of ramen.  Overall, it's a good place for some trendy asian food and would really like to try more things on the menu if I ever come down to Charlotte again!"}
{"text":"My husband, two daughters (15 & 13) had a wonderful lunch at Futo Buta. Service was friendly and professional. We couldn't find the restaurAnt at first but the directions over the phone guided us in. My husband and oldest daughter had Tonkotsu ramen. Very tasty with pork belly and mushroom in a delicious broth. My youngest daughter had shoyu (a good time) which she loved. I had gyoza , crispy pot stickers, check this place out!"}
{"text":"The food here was so good and the service was amazing! I grabbed a seat at the bar and struck up a nice conversation with the bartender/server. I ordered the fried Brussel sprouts and the Japanese fried chicken- both were amazing! The fried Brussel sprouts in particular were delicious, so crispy with a light, tangy flavor to it, it was awesome. The fried chicken was good too, super crispy with a good dipping sauce (I saw someone else eating it, so I ordered it, and then someone asked me what I was eating, so it must be a trend!).   The ramen was really good too, I liked that the broth wasn't too salty, and the noodles were the good, wavy noodles. The pecan smoked pork belly was delicious! They're a very professionally run restaurant- I ate my appetizers first, and it was nice not to have my ramen come out while I was eating my first course.  Their mango yuzu soft serve was delicious- refreshing, creamy and cool. It wasn't overly sweet or fake-fruit tasting but was a subtle, bright flavor mixed in. I LOVE THIS PLACE!!!"}
{"text":"We had dinner here last weekend. My wife and I brought along our 1 year old toddler.   Atmosphere -  Definitely geared towards a younger and more hip crowd. But they did have high chairs for our kid. Long tables were prevalent and so was the bar seating. Uneven wooden panes in the table makes the dining all the more interesting.   Food -  We ordred the KUROBUTA PORK AND GOLDEN SCALLOP GYOZA. My wife says they were great. They tasted like any other fried dumplings I've had.   As for the Ramen, I ordered the Miso (they were out of the fire and ice) and my wife had the Tonkotsu. Both dishes were good. And my kid ate both dishes. He tends to like noodles. We came from St Louis and the year before we left, they opened up a Ramen restaurant near out place. It was okay. But Futo Buta was great. The broth was flavorful, and the noodles were great.   Staff -  Seems like they have quite a bit of staff for such a small space. So they were on top of everything. Friendly and knowledgeable.   We would come back again."}
{"text":"Vegetarian/Vegan options are amazing and full of flavor! Delicious! Couldn't stop ordering food LOL just to have more leftovers hahaha"}
{"text":"Crazy busy, wouldn't come in with more than 4 people.   All the Ramen is delicious. They even have some fatty tuna that's pretty good. Also got the fried chicken appetizer which was pretty tasty.   Best Ramen in Charlotte."}
{"text":"I LOVE the vegan ramen.  Although I wasn't a fan of the eggplant/zucchini steamed bun.  Green tea ice cream is perfect after dinner treat."}
{"text":"On point! Everything about this place was delicious. I love watching the intensity of the chef as he garnishes everything that leaves the kitchen with expertise."}
{"text":"4.5 Stars  Futo Buta is a ramen shop that opened up in May 2015 in the South End area of Charlotte, NC.  According to their website, the chef, Michael Shortino, was introduced to the kitchen since the age of 5 with his father (who was also a chef).  His grandfather and father taught him the importance of integrity of each dish and over his culinary career, he fell in love with the high level of integrity in Japanese cuisine.  Shortino's focus for Futo Buta is on scratch-like authentic ramen, gyoza (fried dumplings), Japanese fried chicken (tori kara-v age), amami (soft serve in innovative flavor combinations), and more.  I tried the following: - Kurobuta Pork & Scallop Gyoza - loved it!  Definitely made FRESH! - Salmon Belly Nigiri - pecan wood smoked, yuzu mayo, tobiko, maple soy, micro chive - also loved it!  The Salmon Belly was super FRESH!! - Tonkotsu Ramen - pork bone broth, pecan smoked pork belly, scallion, organic mushroom, onsen egg, pickled ginger, nori, sesame, black garlic - MUST GET!  I loved the pork bone broth flavor with the black garlic.  YUM!!  For dessert, it was a green tea ice cream with honey.  YUM!!    ENJOY!!"}
{"text":"Probably one of the best ramen places in charlotte. The food here is exactly what you would expect, and the smells are heavenly. All the food in the soup  is warm and salty and amazing. The people here are so understanding and kind, and the ramen is also good as leftovers, just so you can stretch out the joy of eating here."}
{"text":"The chizu ramen is amazing with or without the meat! I ate every bite with no regrets. We didn't have the friendliest wait staff but it was still a great time. Very intimate feel with not being too full of people."}
{"text":"The best ramen in Charlotte. First, let me clarify that statement doesn't have a lot of weight as the bar is pretty low. But, they make a sold tonkotsu.  It's a small location (like most good ramen spots) and service is quick. GF found the broth a bit on the salty side. For me, the noodles are make or break for ramen and they have very good noodles. They taste like freshly pulled, but I do not know that for a fact."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now with 2 totally different experiences.   1st time, we showed up early bc I had called before and there was like a 1.5 hour wait or something crazy. They don't take reservations or do the app. So you have to wing it! We went early like before 6 and got right in. It's a small spot. We sat at the bar, had a cool waitress who explained everything and what was popular. We tried 2 of their most popular items. 1 the fried tuna squares, amazing. 2 the slider bbq rolls (not called that but you'll know what they are by the menu) so good!! 3 fire & ice ramen bowl (we shared) very good but a little too spicy for me. I don't do spicy but my guy does so I tried it anyways. We also got like a fifty dollar bottle of saki. Yeah we went hard that night. Also they have soft serve ice cream! Usually 2 flavors but so unique. I had a matcha green tea with honey drizzle on top. Basically why I came here bc I saw a pic of this green ice cream on yelp I believe. Sold! Get some! They also had strawberry basil as their other flavor but apparently they change them out every so often. - It was booming shortly after we got our apps and was busy! We came at the perfect time. We had good service and really enjoyed everything we tried!! (Hence the return)   2nd time, I called like 7:15 to see how long the wait was and she said 40 mins. We were in route and when we got there & checked in (they sign you in on iPad and text you when your table is ready) she said 20-25 mins (3 of us). So we were like sweet even better! But then 35 mins go by and another couple who had got there literally 10 mins ago (I heard her tell them 30 min wait) they get seated so I'm like wtf is going on. So i check with her, and she's like there's two spots that should be done anytime now and then we will seat you. So it's a guessing game that they ain't good at. We waiting another 15 before we got our table. Luckily we all knew what we wanted and ordered right away. But we then were pushed for time. And the whole experience just wasn't as cool. I had the misu ramen. It was good! Just wish we were sat when we were told we would be. And wish they do reservations or at least the no wait app!! Hence my 4 stars and not 5."}
{"text":"Sooooooooooooo goooood! I had the Tonkotsu ramen and I slurped down the entire bowl. The broth is so creamy and full of flavor; the noodles are al dente; the pork belly is so sweet and has a nice crisp. I am in LOVE! Not to mention, the waitstaff was friendly and accommodating. Their text system for seating customers is perfect for such a small, intimate setting.   Bottom line: I'm going back. With my mama."}
{"text":"Place is a bit of a mystery to find. Be sure to park in The Post Apts parking garage bc it's free up to 3 hrs. I had the pork belly sandwich or whatever that was. It was a soft but that's what I remember sorry about that, anyway it was decent there was a lot of extra fat on the pork belly and the service was great the prices were decent. They had a great selection of alcohol from what I recall I think I remember seeing wine and beer.  If I had to go back to this place I would recommend going after the dinner and before the lunch crowd. The soft buttons were not my thing and I'm not entirely sure if it was because I was expecting flavor but I'll have to try some at another place to compare it didn't leave me wanting more."}
{"text":"I love the restaurant and  was pending to visit with husband. Thankfully we map ped it correctly and were able to find the parking garage entrance. The wait time was reasonable for patio dining and the app that notifies you was useful since we sat and people watched while we waited. My husband enjoyed his tonkotsu and I went with my favorites the fried Brussel sprouts  and fried chicken (was a bit over cooked). My online friends were freaked out by the video of dancing katsuobushi flakes on the hot brussel sprouts.  The only issue we had was we could occasionally smell garbage or something as we sat at the table, not sure what can be done about it."}
{"text":"If you want to have ramen in Charlotte, I think this is  a good spot to go. The Miso ramen and Tonkustu ramen are worth tasting. I really like the broth and pork belly in the ramen and furnishing style of the restaurant. The only deficiency might me the noodle because I think it's a little bit hard not soft enough."}
{"text":"For Ramen this is as good as it gets in Charlotte.   Parking is available all over south end but not right at the restaurant. You can also take the light rail and walk. The restaurant is small but cozy. It's well thought out with nice details for service (napkins, chopsticks are all upper end of the consumables scale)  They do a good job in their raw items, as they try to serve fresh uni and such when it's available and do a relatively good job at it. Their rice bowl starters are pretty good but my favorite of all the starters is their spicy tuna rice crispy. As for the ramen itself, I'm a big fan of the Tonkotsu with an extra side of spicy pork. The ramen is rich in flavor and well executed.   Now, as for the reason I'm only giving them four stars and not five: value. The pricing is a little steep for what you are getting. There are plenty of other ramen places that serve as good or better ramen, but unfortunately they are not in Charlotte. I feel sometimes they skimp on product and you never want to feel that way in a restaurant. Nevertheless, the food is good and the pricing doesn't bother me enough to not go because it's the only place to get some good ramen around."}
{"text":"Okay. Charlotte. You didn't do me wrong for my 3 month stay in the south. Super surprised to find delicious ramen bowls and this place does not disappoint. Broth is on par with places in MD and NY"}
{"text":"This is a cute little Ramen spot in South End.  The menu has a good variety of ramen, as well as other dishes.  Everything I have tried here has been delicious, but the ramen is my favorite.  The indoor area is small, but they have a nice patio with lights right along the light rail which is perfect or a summer or spring evening.  They also have really fun craft cocktails which are amazing as well, and they pair well with the menu.  Overall, one of my favorite places in Charlotte."}
{"text":"It's hipster ramen. The playlist on a Sat. sounds like it was curated by a 35-year-old man - mostly all rock, including Dave Matthews Band.  Food was ok. Noodles were al dente. I prefer softer noodles for stuffing ma face.   Located by the train tracks."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch.Worst place for noodle. Soup is salty and noodle taste like crap. For that price, you can get much better food somewhere else. My friend had stomachache because the soup Is so greasy."}
{"text":"Pretty good food. Didn't mind the cramped space at all. It reminded me of Wagamama in London. But $14 is a lot for ramen...and there isn't a lot of protein with that.   Really enjoyed the chicken appetizer and the little fried rice bites that came with one of the other dishes (a friend ordered), so order those and you won't mind the lack of protein in the other dishes :)"}
{"text":"Great food here. We were visiting from South Carolina and wish we had a place like this at home. I would drive back for the crispy rice tuna appetizer alone! I also tried the shishito peppers and the Chizu ramen which was very unique and tasty. The ramen bowls are large but they will pack any leftovers to go. Service was fast (appreciated since we had our four month old baby with us) and friendly. We also enjoyed being able to eat on the patio. Great spot!"}
{"text":"I love the food over here! Very delicious ! And I am pretty happy about the food design, looks really classic. Spend my fabulous birthday here:)"}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about how delicious this ramen is. I've had it both with and without the spicy pork add-in and really enjoyed it either way. Tends to be crowded, but definitely still as yummy as carry-out!"}
{"text":"A very nice surprise on Charlotte. Super yummy ramen. Very nice staff and excellent soft serve ice cream!"}
{"text":"Was told wait time was 35 minutes. Waited over an hour- still no table. When asking the hostess the response was \"it should have been 35 minutes I don't know what happened.\" This restaurant is unable to adequately manage their tables and customers. Nothing was done to apologize for the misleading wait time.  The food is good, but not good enough to make up for the poor service and mismanagement. Would highly recommend taking your business elsewhere.  Up to an hour and 15 minutes... leaving now as this is going no where."}
{"text":"This has got to be the most difficult restaurant to find in Charlotte.  GPS would not get me there.  I even called the restaurant and they told me to look for an apartment complex with a garage.  The Apartment complex was not signed and it took a long time to finally find it.   Once there, we sat outside next to the light rail and busy walkway.  I was glad to sit outside because the inside seating was high benches that appeared uncomfortable.  Sitting outside felt like being in a bustling city with bikers and runners and walkers and trains.  The menu here shouted Asian Fusion with Ramen noodles.  It might have shouted some sushi too, but in all fairness, I am not a sushi fan and didn't pay much attention to that part of the menu. I had a vegan bowl that was heavy on noodles and light on everything else.  I added poached chicken.  It was good, but the flavor was nothing to write home about.  The black tea was weak and not good. I asked for sweet and low, but got a small bottle of simple syrup instead.  They never offered any refills. Now for the great part.  Never do I order desserts, but when they offered cinnamon fig ice cream, I was all in. It was served in a little cup with a little wooden spoon, but every bite was heaven sent.   This place is ultra trendy, but not a place I would frequent. For me, Ramen noodles helped define my college days.  That was a long time ago and I have probably had my fill of those noodles.  If anything would get me back, it would be the ice cream.  It really did almost make me scream."}
{"text":"After searching for a true ramen spot, Charlotte has answered my requests! I walked in this spot and I was instantly greeted. I sat at the bar and chatted with the guy working at the bar. He was great. Giving me great suggestions and I think he really enjoys working here.   The atmosphere was perfect with great decor and I felt like this set up is what you would see in Japan. This restaurant is very trendy and fits the neighborhood it's located in. The chef Has clearly done his research on how the true ramen experience should be.    I ordered the tonkatsu ramen. The flavor was robust and you can tell that the broth was being cooked all day. The pieces of belly fat melted in your mouth. The homemade noodles grabbed the flavor of the broth. (Yes true tonkatsu broth is a bit oily because of the ingredients they use to make the broth). You will not find many Ramen places that makes their own noodles. This is definitely a treat! I would highly recommend this place based on the staff and the quality of food."}
{"text":"Stop what you're doing! Get on LYNX, a bus,  a taxi, in your car, walk, on horseback, a skateboard, a hang glider or a pogo stick and go to Futo Buta now!!!  Incredible addition to South End!  Pork and scallop Gyoza are fantastic!  The Steamed Bun with Pork Belly is the best I've had!  Miso (Hungry) is just bursting with sweet and savory flavors!  Everything is made in house: the Gyoza wrappers and filling, chili sauce, the pork/chicken broth for the miso and even the noodles. The noodles in my Miso were made two hours before I got there! You can't get any fresher!  Even better, Lenny Boy is making them their own Kambucha!!  So like I said, drop your pencil, save your file, feed the dog and go there now!!! These guys are awesome!!"}
{"text":"Only star deduction because of the \"waiting\" line set-up. Went there during lunch and it gets crowded. It feels especially crowded when you enter and there are people standing there waiting to be seated. Not much room to spread out. Either you felt you were going to almost sit at people waiting for take-out or diners at the counters. Back-up a bit more and you are at the kitchen. Customers waiting to be seated didn't know where to line up or put their names down for the wait. Perhaps they can have a \"hostess podium\" outside before you even enter the space. Would help with crowding at the entrance and not make it awkward when patrons are trying to get out of the restaurant.  FOOD! ok, now to the important part. Had the rice crispy squares as appetizers. DEF. WOW! yes, i know how to make spicy tuna poke at home, but how do I get my rice to stay square and crisp without burning them dry? I highly recommend this as an appetizer. My coworker who I went with had the Tori Kara Age (crispy chicken) these were good too, I was expecting something like bonchon, but these were boneless pieces, with a sweet glaze and a spicy chili dip! very good too.  We sat outside - it was a bit chilly, but nice in the sun and we planned on having ramen anyways and it would keep us warm. We both had the Tonkotsu ramen and it was delicious. Arranged nicely, served not too hot you burn yourself. Noodles tasted freshly made and the pork belly was done right. I wasn't able to finish my soup because of the appetizer. Being new to Charlotte, this will def. be my go to ramen place as it's just down the block from my office!  Because it was a bit chilly, I didn't get to try their deserts. Next time for sure! I want that soft serve.  Staff was friendly and quick. Just a little confused on how to seat the incoming lunch crowd. Would be nice if they communicated \"pick-ups here, people waiting to be seated here, people to put name on list here\" again as noted in my intro, if people can be caught before entering the small indoor waiting area, by having a podium outside. Perfect crowd control solution!"}
{"text":"As a non Charlotte native, I'm not too sure how this place stacks up to other ramen places in the area, but I'd have to imagine it's got to be up there in the ranks. It's a nice little spot with a low key atmosphere that serves some great ramen. If you're really hungry or borderline starving, I'd go for the Buta Bowl. It'll fill right you right up and it tastes pretty good too."}
{"text":"Really good food.  It can be a bit of a wait so go early or prepare to wait.  Great ramen dishes, nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"The Newa vegan bowl is amazing. As vegans, it's hard for us to find great meals. This is a favorite spot for us. The shisito peppers are great and they have a local selections of beer to start the meal off the right way. The seating is tight so go expecting to wait and sit elbow to elbow with strangers. Yes, slurp your noodles. It is appropriate and traditional for ramen."}
{"text":"Sure the ramen is great, but tori kara age (Japanese fried chicken) is the real reason to visit. A MUST try!!"}
{"text":"This is, by far, the best ramen place I've ever been to and one of the best Japanese restaurants I've had the pleasure of visiting. The noodles were fresh and flavorful. The variety on the menu was pleasant. I'll definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"I was really excited after knowing a ramen place opened before I leave the city. The place is small and cozy, decor is trendy. We've ordered several appetizers and of course, the ramens. I really want to love this place but the foods are mediocre (even considering the fact that I'm no where near a ramen snob). Noodles were handmade daily, but the texture were lacking. The soups were okay, more a blend of Asian flavors (pho/Chinese/Japanese) than anything else. Overall, this place is great for hangout, but if you are looking for real ramen flavors, your taste buds definitely won't be satisfied when walking out of the door."}
{"text":"Hands down, one of the best ramen I had! Everything we had tasted super fresh and local.  The service was quick, and the waitress was super helpful. The entire restaurant was super clean and efficient too!"}
{"text":"food is amazing. and i love getting it to go, sometimes the communal dining makes me think back to the portlandia episode about the breakup. staff is super awesome. delish."}
{"text":"There is not enough good things to say about this place besides I come here at least once a week because the food, sushi, & customer service is BOMB.  It was rare finding my \"go-to\" restaurant in CLT and was finally stoked when I came across Futo Buta. Exceptional customer service with a few servers, who always treat me like family when I'm there.   You can tell the manager/owner of this place is well-experienced in the Ramen business, who had a careful vision of his concept in the centerfold of Southend. It's a tight-knit ramen bar that encourages a communal vibe for customers to interact, yet also insinuates an atmosphere of Japanese-American influence.  Is this the best ramen I've ever had? No. Is it the best in Charlotte? IMO YES. My usual is the Tonkostu with extra spicy (crack) ground pork you can add on the side. Also don't forget one of their signatures apps...the Rice Crispy Squares! It's the perfect finger food you need on a date - an FYI to all those singles out there.   This place never disappoints."}
{"text":"Great ramen! good food and relaxed atmosphere. Definitely try it out if you haven't already."}
{"text":"Bombdiggity ramen. Love having a long layover in Charlotte just to sneak off and eat the ramen. The pork belly is truly the star of the show with a perfect char.   Only con is the beautiful thick bowls are cold when the ramen goes in and the soup doesn't stay hot for long enough."}
{"text":"Now that I am batting .500 with the ice cream I have updated my review appropriately since I'm no longer 0/4 when trying to get my craym fix.  While your at it the food isn't bad either the place is tiny on the inside which gives it that nice homey feel but not for people who want space while they eat. If it's a nice night the outdoor patio offers a great experience."}
{"text":"This place has only been open for a week and operations are still a little rough around the edges, but the food is great. The menu and the drink selection are small -- no poring over dozens of competing choices. I very observantly don't even remember which draft beer I had, but it was something delicious and golden. The tonkatsu ramen was very earthy and delicious, and I'm looking forward to trying the other kinds. Being that seating is kind of tight, I got to know the people at the next table much better than one usually gets to know one's dining neighbors. They had the crispy rice and tuna appetizer, which I will definitely try next time because it looked yummy, but they also experienced the downside of not getting one of their bowls of ramen delivered until well after everything else at the table had been eaten and drunk. I tried the cherry/chili/pork ice cream because it was such a weird idea that someone had to try it, and actually it was quite delicious."}
{"text":"Best ramen around. No doubt about it. Bar and wait staff are super friendly, always happy to give a recommendation. Chef Shortino really knows his stuff."}
{"text":"Tried this place tonight with the bestie! She discovered it and I was interested in giving it a try. I was planning to write a great review tonight but in the modest of me writing this review a friend called me. He said, \"turn on the news that restaurant you went to tonight is on WBTV restaurant scorecard!\" I immediately felt nauseous but tuned in because I was just in the phone sharing with him that the food was good but mine and Stefannys stomach was hurting about 20mins after our meal.  After watching the review on WBTV it probably was from the pork being placed on the floor of the kitchen in buckets. Or maybe it was from the chefs not wearing the proper protective gear for their facial hair while cooking and hair. Or maybe from the undercooked food. They had a score of a 91 -A, and that's absolute nasty! I doubt I'll be returning, but if you want to see the video check out WBTV restaurant scorecard. http://www.wcnc.com/mobile/article/news/local/popular-restaurants-score-low-a-grades/499835694 From the article: Also up this week on the report card is Futo Buta. They too were handling raw chicken with their bare hands. Bare hand contact with your food is never allowed.  One employee working with ready-to-eat food wasn't wearing his beard net and some of their buckets of soup, pigs feet and broth all being stored on the floor.  Their grade here at Futo Buta, a 91, another low \"A\".   I really hope Futo Buta has made changes since this was featured."}
{"text":"The best place in town to eat Roman! The rice crispy/tuna is to die for. I can not stop eating here!! Everything on the menu is amazing but the pork broth is the best!!"}
{"text":"This is the only ramen spot in Charlotte that I have found, but having tried ramen all over the country, Futo Buta does not disappoint. Every time I go, I tend to gravitate back towards the Tonkotsu. I've tried a few of their other dishes, but this one has truly stolen my heart. They have an excellent sake selection, which also puts this place up towards the top of my list."}
{"text":"Had the miso ramen with pork and it was honestly one of the best ramen I've had in a while. I don't normally like pork in my ramen but I decided to chance it this one time and absolutely did not regret it. The pork was perfectly marinated and just melted in my mouth. The noodles were perfectly cooked. The broth wasn't the best miso broth I've tried but it was still very tasty.  I would love to go back and try the other ramen on the menu.   The restaurant itself was a bit small and there was a wait but the wait wasn't too bad considering it was peak dinner time."}
{"text":"I had the Brussels sprouts and the Miso Hungry.  I tried my friend's rice Krispy squares too.  Everything was delicious!!  Our waitress was super nice and helpful.  I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!  We had a team lunch there and everything was delicious, fresh and cooked perfectly.  The Japanese chicken appetizer plate was really good and the Brussels sprouts were also extremely good.   Two people had the Tonkotsu ramen and two had the Miso ramen with Spice Pork.   Everyone raved about the ramen.  We will definitely be back trying this again."}
{"text":"Hype only works if you live up to it. I was not impressed in the slightest with Futo Buta.  I went with a group of girlfriends for a weekday lunch. The four of us walked in and stood awkwardly inside the door for several minutes before we were acknowledged. We sat on the patio since the inside didn't have room for our small party.   Our server dropped off the menus in a rush. I was able to snag her to ask a few questions, mainly what she would recommend that's gluten free. She told me that \"all of the ramen dishes could be prepared GF, except for these two, and we recommend against ordering this one.\" That nixes half the ramen options. I asked \"do they come with rice noodles instead?\" She replied that they did and I settled on the Fire and Ice.  When our meals came out, each of my friends received a beautiful bowl of noodles while I got a bowl of broth and a separate bowl of rice. Just rice. Short grain sushi rice. And it was cold.   I paid $13 for a bowl of broth. Why would I bother to come back when I can get an excellent bowl of pho elsewhere for a fraction of the price? I don't know if it's bad communication with the kitchen, a non-interest in serving patrons with dietary restrictions, or what, but I feel like Futo Buta is another victim of the Charlotte hype machine. It's just not that great."}
{"text":"Awesome new joint in S End. We had the Pork belly bun, dumplings, and the Miso Ramen. All house made from the broth to the bun. Chef/Owner is behind the counter cooking. He is the former Chef of Baku. Good stuff all around!"}
{"text":"Fire and Ice Ramen bowl is a must have.  The flavors are a nice blend of spices with the veggies and smoked salmon."}
{"text":"It's been two weeks, and I'm still dreaming about my meal at Futo Buta.   Crispy fried Brussel sprouts and perfect little fried pieces of chicken called Tori Kara Age to start, followed by the Shoyu (Good Time) - smoked pork belly, a poached egg, leeks, and noodles floating in a generous bowl of delicious broth. The pork belly was perfectly cooked, and when I broke the egg yolk, it added a creaminess to the broth. The dish names had me giggling like a 12-year-old boy, but that bowl definitely showed me a helluva good time!   Such a good time that I filled up on appetizers and ramen, leaving no room for dessert. DON'T DO THAT. Get a few to-go boxes and try the soft serve ice cream. I'm not sure when I'll be in Charlotte next, but not getting dessert at Futo Buta will haunt me until then. (This Public Service Announcement is brought to you by regret.)   OK, I can't talk about the food anymore, I'm salivating just thinking about it. So, atmosphere - this place was definitely trendy, inside and out. It was too hot to eat outside, but there seemed to be plenty of seating and shade. The tables inside were a little smaller, but we never felt crowded. Water was served in tall glass decanters, and our server was quick to refill the water and clear empty plates.   If you're not familiar with the place, it can be a little difficult to find - my coworker and I parked on South Blvd. and walked down Bland Street, following the railroad tracks until we reached our destination. It's less than a stone's throw from the Bland Street light rail station and is right across from Hot Taco (another great eatery my coworker and I tried and recommend)."}
{"text":"I really like the atmosphere here. Staff are super friendly aside from them losing my appetizer ticket. I would recommend the hamachi crudo and Fire and ice ramen. Delicious!"}
{"text":"Had dinner here for the first time last night and it was delicious! The staff was incredibly friendly and gave great recommendations. I had the strawberry fizz cocktail, which was my first sake cocktail, and was not disappointed! The brussel sprout appetizer and the pork belly buns were my favorite!"}
{"text":"Okay I have to say this. Their Ramen is not delicious. It was extremely oily and lacked so much flavor. We had better Ramen at Yume Bistro. However, their pork buns was delicious."}
{"text":"Cool place. Not too comfortable but what it lacks in cushy chairs, it more than makes up for it in flavor and presentation.  I've been here several times and thought it was time to throw them a review, especially now that I have a lay of the land.   I'll admit that I've only had one of the Ramen choices, the Tonkatsu, but don't know why I'd want to change up. It is so delicious and so consistent every time I come here. The Onsen Egg is the pièces de résistance!  The flavor is buttery and rich. I like to spice it up a bit and it is more than enough of a serving.   I've tried a couple of the appetizers and the Pork Belly buns and Tuna Tartare on Rice Crispies are awesome and tasty.    Don't leave without trying the ice cream!!  A swirl of Green Tea and Strawberry Basil will put you in such a great mood.   Yea I'll be back."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night after work and managed to get seated without a wait. Ordered the pork belly buns and we each had ramen. The buns came out after the ramen as the server informed us they had burned the batch (such a waste!) but what they brought out to us was delicious. I had the seasonal butternut miso ramen which was good, but the smoked cauliflower seemed to overwhelm the other flavors. Overall it was a nice dining experience - in and out really quick."}
{"text":"Visited this restaurant for a birthday dinner this past weekend. The weather was nice so we sat outside but the strong wind was a little bothersome. I ordered the beet salad and it was delicious, especially the dressing. I also loved the candied walnuts and dates in the salad - scrumptious to say the least. I asked for chicken on my salad and was given a side dish of cold poached chicken. It was alright, I prefer grilled chicken but this was fine too. I also split a miso ramen bowl with my father because we wanted to try what the restaurant was known for. It was good, pretty flavorful with the addition of the egg. I enjoyed my meal. Futo Buta is a great place to go if you are looking for some ramen."}
{"text":"Holy swiss cheese this place is amazing!  The Duck..... THE DUCK! Unbelievable, get the duck steam bun when you come here to start off with and I recommend the pig belly for ramen.  Everything we have had so far was amazing and we will for sure be back!"}
{"text":"This Japanese Ramen place is pretty decent. Coming from New York where there is numerous ramen places in the city, Futo Buta was pretty good. I would recommend getting their pork belly buns. It's a bit on the pricey side for what you pay for comparing the size of the buns, but it's still worth a try. You must get their soft serve! Their sweet corn flavor is a must!"}
{"text":"We came for dinner and it's a small restaurant on a corner with bright lights and open glass windows so you can see the hustle and bustle inside. It was inviting, especially on a dark cold evening. The space inside is quaint, in other words, you will cozy up to your neighbors very closely. Your conversation is theirs and their conversation is yours. I didn't mind that too much, it kind of added to their atmosphere. The pictures on the walls, and even the bathroom door is kitschy, like you walked into an anime comic book.  I found it to be fun.   The service was efficient and the food came out rather quickly. The bowls are deceptively deep so you get quite a big and complete meal with one ramen bowl. I got their signature Fire and Ice which is really good. It has salmon and just a hint of spice. My friend got the tonkotsu- it was very rich and fatty. With some hot sake, it was a perfect dinner for a frigid night.  But as I was finishing up, a girl came to clean the table next to me. Like I said, the tables are all stacked very closely together, so when she sprayed the tables to clean, I could feel a sprinkling on my arm. Not sure sure if it went into my water or bowl, but I was definitely done at that point. It was a startling end to an otherwise good meal."}
{"text":"This place is SO overrated.   I am beyond shocked at all of the four and five-star reviews, which were the initial reason I decided it was worth a shot while on a short weekend trip to Charlotte.   The place was packed and there was a long wait (but that was understandable and it was dealt with in a friendly manner). There was a rustic, trendy vibe inside, and a lot of outdoor seating. There were manga-style cartoons on the bathroom doors and beautiful plating. I am pretty sure the place's style and branding is what most of the hype is about because...  THIS WAS THE MOST BLAND RAMEN I'VE HAD IN A WHILE!  If my boyfriend and I hadn't ordered spicy beef to be added to our tonkatsu ramen (making the ramen an overpriced $16) the broth would have had NO FLAVOR AT ALL. For me, ramen is all about the broth. But this broth was so light. It had no depth and no layers. It was completely void of any comforting ramen flavors. I almost didn't even bother eating it, but I was hungry since our appetizer - while good quality - was super small for the price (four pieces of sushi for $10!!!).   The meat was dry and there was a very small amount for the price point. Usually ramen will have a few pieces of main meat and then some other types or parts of the meat to give it some more heft. But I literally got two small chunks of dry pork belly with a ton of fat and no flavor except for the outer skin. The egg was also undercooked and still cold, which made it unsettling in texture. The ramen noodles themselves were also not authentic and had a doughy thick texture, rather than the slick feeling of a flavor-soaked ramen noodle.   I am wondering if some of the other ramen flavors were a bit more interesting.   The couple next to me had brought their own hot sauce and dumped it on their chicken wing appetizer, which is probably another sign that this place is lacking in flavor for anyone who likes more than a bland broth.   I was super disappointed, but I have only went once. Maybe some of their other ramen have a bit more to offer, but from my one experience I would say it was super underwhelming and overrated."}
{"text":"Fantastic food!  I don't know how \"authentic\" this ramen is, but it's delicious.  I've been twice now and had the Miso (Hungry), which seemed like a more traditional dish.  My second time I had the Chizu, which was more like an Italian dish, but was just a delicious (also very salty, but I enjoy that).  I will be back.  Wonderful."}
{"text":"I finally got a chance to check out Futo Buta. For the most part, I felt underwhelmed. The food was just okay, which, when combined with the price, was a bummer.   I got the miso (hungry) and it was not bad, just not worth $12. I also ordered the duck confit buns which were also good, just not worth $10. I topped the meal off with ice cream and it was tasty,  just not worth $5. Are you seeing a theme here? Overpriced for what you get, in my opinion.   The highlight to the experience was the service. Everyone was super friendly, and our waitress was top-notch. She talked to me about their sake selection, and explained how sake works (for lack of a better word). She was extremely nice, and checked in often.  Ultimately, I feel neutral toward this place. I can't exactly recommend it, but also wouldn't NOT recommend it, if that makes sense. I think if you're willing to spend the money, you could do much better if you're not set on ramen; but then again, ramen is a unique dish and I don't know of any other ramen places in CLT. So... Give it a try. Or don't. Whatever.   And thus ends the most useless Yelp review ever!"}
{"text":"This place is difficult to find. (It's on the opposite side of the tracks from the other restaurants - like Greek Aisles). It was packed on a Sunday night. My Fire & Ice ramen was delicious! My Hubby's order - arrived 45 minutes after mine - and only because we kept asking where it was. Once they work out the service kinks of being new, I'm sure this will be a favorite!"}
{"text":"My wife and I are super foodie nerds and excellent cooks/chefs. We really loved it. Best ramen we have had in CLT with only Soul coming close. We had gyoza and eggplant bun apps. She had miso and I the tonky one. Both were delicious. The miso had sweet corn that was al dente and perfect for the flavor. Our eggs were cooked properly and the pork belly was super tender and not overwhelming in the dish. We disagree with most on the value/flavor issue in that having too much pork weighs down the intricate flavors. I had the spicy ground pork added, and that was a mistake as it left a gross orange grease puddle on the surface. Once that was removed the dish was lovely.  We will definitely return."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service. We waited over an hour when we were told 45 minutes and as I'm writing this, still waiting. The hostess \"assumed\" We wouldn't want to sit at the bar. Everyone else walked in and got a table within half an hour if not less.  The hostesses disregard of saying \"sorry\" is not excusable. When I come to Charlotte I always looked forward to coming here. Never again."}
{"text":"We had dinner last night with some friends and I could not be happier with not only the food but the service and overall vibe! They are killing it!! I loved the ramen- the Brussels sprouts and the salmon ceviche. So delicious so fresh- can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Drove from D.C. to North Carolina to check out the mountains and animals in the forest. Everywhere I go, I like to check up on Ramen places because my taste buds and mind always work in conjunction to lure me into it. I am not a Ramen connoisseur by any means, but I have pretty much tried all of the Ramen joints in the D.C. area and wanted to check out a ramen place in Charlotte to see how it compares to what's local to me. After a quick glance on Yelp, we (My companion and I)  decided to check out this place.  It's tucked in an area along the city rail so it's a convenient stop if you're hungry! The place was packed both outside and inside, so that was a good sign! We went inside and was warmly greeted by the receptionist. There was a 15 minute wait, but luckily, they have a texting system so they will text you when a seat is available.  After having a seat, the friendly waitress took the order. I ordered the Tonkotsu and my companion orderd the Miso (Hungry) from the menu. I didn't get the joke at first! We also ordered the pork belly buns.  The pork belly buns literally came out within 2 minutes and they were beautifully presented. I took a bite and it literally, melted in my mouth and was orgasmic. When you have something melt in your mouth like warm butter, you know it's good for you (for your taste buds and mind. Not so sure about your heart, haha). That was the best pork belly buns I've ever had!  Now onto the Ramen. Again, they were beautifully presented. Very colorful, with each item (egg, red stuff, onions, etc...) separated into different sections. It looks like a colorful painting. Too pretty to eat, but I ate it anyways. It was one of the best Ramen that I've ever had! The broth was flavorful and not too strong and not too light. Perfect balance. Remember, Balance is the Heart of Everything! Like Yin Yang. Also, the portion was just right in terms of noodles to pork and the amount of food was just enough.  Totally recommended and worth the 6 hour drive to eat here. Yummers."}
{"text":"So delicious!  Futo Buta makes great ramen (gluten free!) plus Krispy rice squares and gf fried chicken.  So so good.  If you have a server recommend his own modifications, take him up on them, so worth it!"}
{"text":"Absolutely incredible food!! You can tell amount of love and respect the owners have for their craft and the cuisine that inspired this concept. To really understand how fantastic this restaurant is you need to go back enough to try the whole menu. Don't sleep on the specials either the Uni Chips and the Truffled Toro Tar Tar literally will make you laugh out loud they are so freaking good. This restaurant is truly one of Charlottes hidden treasures."}
{"text":"Are you yearning for something delicious but you don't know where to eat? Futo Buta will satisfy.  Get the Fire & Ice ramen($14), and you'll thank me. I've slurped ramen bowls in many ramen shops, and this is one of the best. This tantalizing bowl is incredible and very flavorful. With few unique ingredients, the Fire & Ice ramen is a game changer. The kimchi and dashi broth is mild and the hot smoked salmon makes it more interesting.  Things to keep in mind: - Futo Buta is closed on Mondays. - They don't take reservations, and no seating of incomplete parties, Also, due to the limited space, during busy hours, they enforce time limits.   Four and Half Yelps"}
{"text":"This place was not an easy find. Parked on the street which was a convenient walk.  Ordered the miso (hungry) ramen and enjoyed the fresh cut corn. The pork belly was good and broth was flavorful. Last but not least got the avocado soft serve ice cream...which was excellent!"}
{"text":"Love the beef tartare they have! It was amazing! Only wish it was a larger portion! Their ramen is always spot on. Just wish we lived closer!"}
{"text":"Okay, I'm no ramen expert but this is hands down one of the best restaurants I've been to in a long time.   I tried the Fire and Ice Bowl, and I have fallen in love. It was the perfect amount of spice and flavor. The Salmon tasted fresh and went well with the broth.   If you want something different than your normal dinning experience, I highly suggest this place!"}
{"text":"This is a small restaurant along the light rail in South End. The crowd is generally younger, and it can get very busy, although I've never had to wait longer than 15 minutes for a seat. If you're eating alone it's easy to get a seat at the bar.  I eat here when I want to get full. The noodle bowls are probably the best deal on the menu for the amount of food per dollar. Other dishes don't seem like they're worth the pricetag.  The atmosphere is busy but not too loud, and for some reason doesn't feel crowded to me. The staff is friendly."}
{"text":"Loved this food and got to try many different dishes. It's a trendy joint as well as being very healthy for most of their food options. If you like trendy Asian, this is your place. Try it out! My favorite thing was an appetizer that was Asian fried chicken. I got to try several different noodle bowls as well. All were good."}
{"text":"Food is amazing.. closest to California Ramen I have been able to find!"}
{"text":"Words cannot describe my love affair with their Miso (Hungry) Ramen with spicy pork. I savor every morsel of the pecan smoked pork belly. Set it off with a Birdsong IPA, and leave fat and happy.  Service is fantastic."}
{"text":"Best place in Charlotte for ramen hands down. Do not go anywhere else trust me i tried the other places and they are not even on the same league as this place. The only down side to this place is the location is a little hidden from street view"}
{"text":"This is a really cute spot. Love the atmosphere in this place. Staff is really friendly and the service is great. I had the fire and ice ramen. While I didn't really enjoy this dish, I look forward to trying others."}
{"text":"We had the porkbelly steam bun and miso ramen noodles. Both dishes were very delicious and I wish we had one where I'm from so I could keep coming back and trying different things. The staff seemed friendly and the food came out quickly. They have a good selection of beverages and the ice cream was very delicious as well. Great place for a quick (delicious) bite!"}
{"text":"I've been twice and had success both times.  The food is good, the service is great. Take advantage of the water, ramen is salty... it just is, not in a bad way.  The first time i went i had the pork rolls, the rolls were delicious. The second time, I was with two friends, we had three different types of ramen, they were all delicious. Even more delicious were the brussel sprouts.   If you're making this a destination, know that it's on the Lynx side of the building, it has no on street presence (not on South, Camden, or South Tyron).   This place will be an asset in the cold weather."}
{"text":"The Miso has amazing flavor and a big portion! You get what you pay for and the quality of service and food here is worth every penny!"}
{"text":"Really good service, the Ramen bowl I had was great, I don't know what the inside is like because I went when the weather was still warm and sat outside on the light rail but had a really good time!"}
{"text":"Futo Buta is a small, not-so-quiet ramen shop that is tucked away in a corner.  But that corner is worth the trip if you're like me and love ramen. It was pretty crowded when I went at around 9pm on a Saturday but that is to be expected from a place this size and quality.  The shishito peppers are a good substitute for edamame(which they have) and the tori kara age dish has a great flavor.  The miso ramen is a great beginner's bowl in my opinion and the buta bowl is great but I recommend getting the spice on the side for those unfamiliar with spicy foods.  Aside from the extra small size of the place and the plethora of quirky octopus drawings in the bathrooms, this is a good spot to get some good food."}
{"text":"What a wonderful surprise... after a long night out, I was craving a hot bowl of noodles for my recovery. I knew there were tons of pho places around but then I Yelped \"Ramen\" to try my luck... and sure enough, a ramen place! I already told myself not to have high hopes because I still haven't found good ramen in North Carolina. Pressure is on though ....I dragged 4 of my friends with me (even though they wanted to get brunch food and they were like \"Janet, of course you always want Asian food\") but they were nice enough to let me drag them haha.... but lucky for me, they all thought the food was amazing! Phew!  5 stars for the beautiful presentation of each dishes, the décor and the friendly staff. One of the nice servers there even walked out to the street to give us step by step directions while we were lost. SO NICE!!!    Here's what we ordered: 3 stars for their Tonkatsu Ramen - ok but still better than Dashi in Durham so I'll take it. The broth was tasty but the noodles were so-so. I guess I'm always going to be comparing it to the places in LA or Totto or Ippudo in NYC....  :-/  5 stars for the ramen if comparing it to other ramen in NC  5 stars on the following dishes: Salmon belly nigiri special - soo delicious Spicy tuna rice squares- perfectly seasoned, great combo of textures, beautiful presentation Eggplant bun- fresh and delicious - I love eggplant Fire and Ice Ramen - 5 stars for the broth, love the kimchi, gingery taste. Very unique and  full body flavor 2 star for the asparagus as we thought the texture was too slimy  Overall, I would give it \"Woohoo! As good as it gets!\" ... for ramen in NC so far :)  I will definitely come back again to get my Ramen Fix in NC and ESPECIALLY to try all their appetizers. Definitely think their starters were the stars of the meal!"}
{"text":"So I finally made it Futo Buta and it did not disappoint. The atmosphere was awesome and the food was amazing. I can't put into words the flavor explosion I had. I ordered the Fire and Ice. It was great. I went alone but the waitress gave me the run down as well as the dinner company I met. They said once I eat here once I would be a repeat customer, and they were right. The presentation of the food, the service, just everything was great. This is not your average ramen noobles. Complements to the chef!"}
{"text":"Well I just typed up a whole review but accidentally deleted it.   The food is average; however I did not try any appetizers as I wasn't starving. Maybe those are noteworthy.  I had the Shoyu ramen bowl. (Pecan smoked pork belly, bamboo, scallion, onsen egg*, wakame, roasted spring onion.) It wasn't bad but it wasn't \"WHOA this is good.\" It kind of reminded me of Miso Soup with extra stuff thrown in.   Waitress was great and the concept is cool but all in all the food is just average at best."}
{"text":"I have lived on the west coast for 20 years.  On a recent visit home, I Stopped in to see what ramen in Charlotte was like.  I was very impressed.  The noodles were cooked perfectly and the broth was amazing.  The wait staff were well versed in the menu and we sampled a number of menu items.  I will say all 4 of our entrees were delicious.  Will be back at futo buta again.."}
{"text":"The service was friendly, the food was okay, but the price was just too high for what you get. We had lunch on a Saturday at 2:00pm and they were out of tonkotsu and vegan ramen already. Maybe if we had a chance to taste those, we would have been blown away... Our group tried 2 appetizers, both types of buns, and 2 types of the available ramen left on the menu and we just weren't satisfied by the quality or quantity. The place definitely has a certain charm to it and I think they are going in the right direction, but I think the prices need to come down or the quantity go up to really feel satisfied by the experience.   Would I discourage people from trying it? No.  Will I go back? Probably not."}
{"text":"I love everything here except the ramen (ironically enough!) Ramen is overly heavy and salty but sushi dishes, rice bowls, appetizers are all excellent. Brussel sprouts are amazing!"}
{"text":"New spot in Charlotte! Since I had some friends from out of town who wanted to try it, we decided to come here after a whim. Location was confusing and hidden. The GPS took us to the other side of the light rail since it wasn't visible to us while driving (maybe if you're taking the light rail you might see it). No parking next to the restaurant, so we walked around until I had to ask bystanders where this location was at.   Side note: I've had many friends told me this place was terrible but I didn't want to take their words for it.  Gotta try it out for yourself before you make your own decision right? Well, maybe I should of listen to them after all.   So we started off with some hamachi sashimi slices and they weren't bad. Had a very sour taste to it but overall decent if they could tone down that sourness. Pork bellies bun were \"Americanized\" flavor of sweet bbq sauce, not much punch or flavors to it. Definitely not impressed.   As for the ramen, we all opted to try the Tonkatsu Ramen because how can you failed in something that's normally good at other ramen places?  We all took one bite and went looking for the salt. The broth was so bland. No salt were to be found. So when the waitress came to check on us, I requested something salty to add to the broth. She brought out some condiments and we all dose ourselves with what looks like Japanese \"salt seasoning\". Even with that, it left a weird after-taste. Usually when creating the broth for ramen, the broth has to be cooked for hours to create a sweet flavorful broth. However,    after attempting 5 bites of this bowl, we all quickly agreed that even with the store bought Ramen packages - it would probably tasted even better than this!  My friend took two more bites & eventually gave up, stating she can't eat this anymore. \"It's just not good\", she said. I didn't want to waste foods so I attempted to finish it but eventually gave in when our  other friend said she's also done. Basically we all didn't even finished our meals and asked for the check and left.  We ended up driving to Rusan's instead.   Service was awesome btw. Our waitress was great. Very cute setting but limited seatings. Foods, however were mediocre.  I should of listen to all my Asian friends who said this place doesn't hold up to its hype. Hey, at least we gave it a try. Please do some more researches on how real Ramen broth or legit ramen restaurants i.e from Los Angeles or maybe Japan themselves before opening a restaurant in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Pretty consistent although on occasion you get a not so great meal. This place is hard to find if its your first time, but Id say park in the Post parking garage off of South blvd. Small space, so be planned to be in close quarters."}
{"text":"Arrived with our 7 year old and began well. Couldn't figure out where to park and we called. The man who answered gave wonderful detailed instructions for parking and how to find the restaurant. This is one of the highlights.   We ordered 3 apps and 2 ramen to share. The Brussel sprouts were delicious and messy. The rice crispy squares with tuna was also very good though a bit too much salt. The tori Kara , Japanese fried chicken was also tasty. All three apps had enjoyable flavors though all three had a heavy salt hand.   The ramen was not good. Both flavors had no taste beyond salt , very one note. We finished all the apps and barely dented the ramen.   The sever asked us about boxing it up. When we shared our dislike, her response was- oh, sorry.   Then we received the bill. Definitely was not worth the value of what we paid.  Average joe meets boredom in food was my family's opinion.   So many other choices we'd rather have to eat."}
{"text":"Do you like Ramen? Do you live in Charlotte? Done. Fresh noodles, quality ingredients and a very hard working staff. My favorite bowls are the tonkotsu and the shoyu. The shoyu is delicate and balanced while the tonk is heavy with bold flavor. Try the tonk first!"}
{"text":"Parking is a little weird, but once you find the place..... fantastic amazing tasting food with really modern fun interior. Umbrella seating next to true light rail."}
{"text":"On a daily trip to Charlotte this was a great stop.  So what did this ramen gem offer us?  1) The staff was extremely friendly. They explained anything we asked and gave us ample warnings about cold ramen bowls. They even helped us match add ins for the flavor we were looking for.   2) The bathrooms were clean. This is very important.   3) The appetizers we had were very good. We ordered the rice crispy and fried chicken. I will warn you it is a lot of food so for two people I recommend you order one. The crispy rice cake comes with raw spicy tuna. Not your thing? The fried chicken is a yummy option. The lime really brought out the spicy flavor of the dipping sauce.  4) The ramen was fantastic. For 14 months I have been looking for a place that got the ramen close to what I had in Taiwan. I was looking for a spicy pork ramen. If that is what you crave come here. Order the Tonkatsu and add spicy ground pork and you get close to a spicy ramen you would find in Taiwan.   The Fire and Ice is what my boyfriend ordered. His broth was sweeter than mine by a lot. If you are looking for a fish based ramen, order the Fire and Ice.   The noodles in both bowls were cooked right. They had a pleasant chewiness to them, without being mush. The noodle to broth ratio was nice as well. Some places you go to the ratio is off and it will show. Here at Futo Buta that ratio is right.   5) The alcohol selection is nice. You have lots of choices between beer and sake. This is good because a lot of places only offer one or the other.   6) The environment is also welcoming. There is not a kids menu but they are welcome here. No one in this ramen place judged many be for the way they looked or who they were with. Why am I including this?  Because lately in some places I have seen this happening. I would like to thank Futo Buta for not judging anyone."}
{"text":"I saw the staff at the bar trying to scoop unwanted ingredients from an  unsuspecting customer's bowl. Gross. I don't trust this place."}
{"text":"Came here one time before and it was my first time trying ramen from a restaurant. I say that because I have a friend who makes traditional ramen and it is amazing and this was pretty darn good too. One thing I like about Futo Buta is the fact that they make their own noodles. With ramen being a \"food trend\" this makes them unique because they care about the quality of the product they are serving. I would definitely come back and one thing worth mentioning is they have a great location of the light rail!"}
{"text":"Great place for ramen, although not much seat available.. The ramen (Tonkotsu) I had is a bit under seasonings for my taste. The pork buns is good, but on the sweeter side for me.  Overall great place to chow of you're on this side of town."}
{"text":"Great service, location, and style.  I sat outside on a nice day and got to watch the rail go by as well as people watch since it is along a popular path.  The food was delicious and came quickly with a good number of options without being overwhelming.  The only reasons it isn't a 5 is because there was a slight aftertaste I didn't like and I wanted more drink options."}
{"text":"I went during the lunch hour, about 12:45 on a Tuesday and it was packed. At first I assumed the restaurant was empty because no one was on the patio, but later noticed the patio was closed, likely due to the chilly weather. Inside, every table was full and a few people were waiting for seats to open up. I ordered my food to go, I got the Fire and ice bowl. It was very good. Had a strange but delicious flavor, can't quite put my finger on what the \"strange\" taste was, but I would definitely order it again. I could really taste the miso sauce on the salmon and I enjoyed the Bok choy in the broth. Price was a little steep IMO, $16 for the bowl with a fried egg ($2) but average for uptown lunch. Wait time was average, but know that this place is small. Tiny. Like standing over people while waiting to order tiny.. I would go again, but maybe before or after the lunch rush. Get there early or prepare to wait. Didn't try the ice cream this time, but they had two flavor combinations."}
{"text":"This was my first time at Futo Buta and I really wanted to love it! Such a cute place. Service was great!!! We started with the Rice Crispy squares which were the best part of our meal. They were excellent.  The ramen however was not as good as I had hoped it would be! We ordered the Tonkotsu and the Buta Bowl. The broths were extremely greasy for both dishes and lacked flavor and the noodles had a somewhat gummy texture. Everything seemed really crowded in the bowls. Usually I always take my leftovers home with me but I had absolutely no desire to eat that a second time. It's really a shame since Yama is not open for lunch!"}
{"text":"I was very disappointed. I thought the food was overrated and needed seasoning. The broth was very bland."}
{"text":"This place is amazing.  The service on point, the food is impeccable and I LOVE the added touch of it being served in handmade pottery bowls.  One of the best restaurants in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Heard about this place before I even moved to Charlotte and finally got the chance to check it out this weekend.  Pro tip - show up before 5 for dinner and you won't have to wait at all! Boyfriend and I got seated right away on a Saturday afternoon. The atmosphere is really cute and unique; very cozy and warm.   The menu is pretty amazing. All kinds of stuff that I've never seen elsewhere in Charlotte. The staff does a great job of explaining all of the items and choices. Shout-out to the waitress with dark hair (gluten-free sister) for doing a truly awesome job outlining all of my options since, surprisingly, they use wheat noodles instead of rice.  The chef even came over afterward to make sure that everything was to our liking, which it definitely was. The rice krispies squares are UNBELIEVABLE - I'm going to be craving those for the foreseeable future. My (rice instead of noodle) bowl was delicious and everything tasted really fresh.   Nice time, I need to try the ice cream! Too pretty to ignore. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"wow! such a delicious experience. it was so packed that we ended up sitting outside which was nice and shady. they kept our water filled which was useful since the food is spicy. the waitress was super helpful when ordering so we didn't get anything too spicy. The fried chicken was to die for, although I don't remember the actual name of it. I wish we had more. and more. and more. we are already talking about a return trip!"}
{"text":"When I first saw the excellent reviews for Futo Buta, I was a bit skeptical given the lack of ramen restaurants in Charlotte... but this place is the real deal! The quality here really is what you might expect from a ramen joint in California or New York.  I've tried the Tonkotsu, Miso, and Shoyu here and enjoyed every single of them. The broth tends to be on the richer side but it is most definitely flavorful so no complaints from me here. I've also found the pork belly to be \"melt in your mouth\"-delicious and tend to order an extra onsen egg.  Outside of the ramen (though one bowl of ramen alone will probably fill you up), the pork belly buns are also a solid option, just a tad pricey at $10 a serving. The fried brussel sprouts and gyoza are good appetizer options, which may come in handy as service can sometimes be a bit slow.  The restaurant itself is small and often packed, so I wouldn't recommend coming here with a large group. However, the ambiance here is quite cool and the food is tasty, so I would say it's worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Futo Buta is the MUCH needed, refreshingly different resturaunt that Charlotte definitely has been lacking. A client of mine actually referred me there and I couldn't believe that I had not heard of it. My wife and I went there and have probably been their once a week since either takeout or dine in. When we dine in, we love to be helped by Janelle however it is often very busy so we will take whoever we are assigned and are always happy. If you happen to get Janelle as your server, then that is a bonus. She carries a huge smile and gives us great recommendations and is very attentive to us. The space is small but cozy. The patio is nice, especially with the heated lamps. We always get the rice krispy squares and the pork belly buns to start. Both are great appetizers that have tons of flavor. The krispy squares are shareable among 3 people but could very easily be eaten by 2 people. The pork belly buns are simple and are made up of 2 servings. I usually get the tonkotsu because it's a little more creamy and my wife gets the Miso Hungry. Both are great options. If you want a little bit of a kick, the fire and ice is great also. If you haven't yet had Futo Buta then this is a must for you especially if you are craving something different than what Charlotte usually offers! Thanks Futo Buta"}
{"text":"I have had a lot of different ramen from different places. Although not the best I have ever had in Charlotte it is number 1. Also their ice cream and apps are great. Their fire and ice ramen is my favorite so give that a shot if you like spicy food. Only downside to this place is you may have to wait awhile for a table as it's always packed."}
{"text":"By the light rail, outside seating is nice. Inside seating very limited. Was not very impressed with the flavor of the ramen broth. I got the tonkotsu, pretty bland. Brussels sprouts were delicious though."}
{"text":"This ramen place is great go-to in Charlotte! I had the crispy rice squares (which were great with the tuna) and the spicy ramen bowl. It was great to share with one other person! I also ordered the green tea ice cream with honey and it was the perfect way to end the meal."}
{"text":"What a great start to my weekend! I've been dying to eat here for the longest! Walking inside I was overwhelmed with happiness! This place smells delightful!   My friend and I decided to dine outside on the patio--Small and charming space. The weather was perfection! A comfortable seventy-degree temperature! I looked over the menu before coming. Of course, Ramen is the signature item. I've heard nothing but great things about this establishment.   The Appetizer: My friend suggested the Rice Crispy Squares. I'm OBSESSED with spicy tuna so this was perfect! The spicy tuna comes in a small mason jar, paired with crispy fried rice and soy sauce. Simple and delicious--Your taste buds will thank you.   Our Entree's: Decisions, decisions!! I couldn't decide between the Tonkotsu and the Fire & Ice. Both are very popular--You can't go wrong with either. I choose the Fire & Ice Ramen. Seriously, I could've disappeared into this bow! My favorite part was the hot smoked salmon! It literally melted between my chopsticks! I can't wait to come back! Bottomline this has become by favorite Ramen spot in Charlotte!!"}
{"text":"I can't say enough about this restaurant!  Everything i've had is delicious!   Appetizers, i highly recommend the Rice Crispy squares (with seared Tuna), the Japanese fried Chicken and the Pork Belly Sticky Bun (possibly the best thing on the menu!)  I'm sure all their Ramen is good, but i keep ordering the Miso (add the spicy pork for extra kick).  It's so good, you will be tempted to drink out of the bowl!  This spot is very small and fills up quick.  You may have to wait over 30 minutes on the weekends, but trust me, it's worth it!"}
{"text":"Fire and ice bowl was amazing. Expect to wait but it will be worth it. If you're a couple you can share the ramen bowl. The salmon is delicious. Cool atmosphere."}
{"text":"Dined here for lunch last week and was so disappointed. Wanted to like it as much as everyone but just couldn't... Ramen broth was so oily and tasted a bit like gravy. Peppers app was greasy with no flavor and steamed bun apps had absolutely no flavor and really no sauce.  I carry my own finishing salt and man did I have to use it... Two start were because of the Brussels that were actually good! Staff was rude at best, if you can even figure out who is waiting on you. And I get the cool theme but at lunch to have heavy metal blaring so loud you can't hear someone talk... just not my style.  For a $50 lunch I can find many more places to spend that money and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Pretty good, but a little pricey for ramen. I have had better for about 33% cheaper in other cities but I don't think there are many ramen options in Charlotte other than Yama. Tonkatsu and miso are probably the best of the ramen. Wish they had more than 2 pieces of pork belly because that is seriously some of the best pork belly in Charlotte. Also, 2 pieces doesn't balance with all of the noodles. Must try the brussels sprouts. The pork buns are teeny tiny. Trendy place right on the light rail."}
{"text":"A neat little place!  Small and intimate indoor setting.  It was too cold to enjoy the outdoor patio, but I could see it being a great place to hangout.  We had sushi, the rice crispy squares, and the pork buns for appetizers and they were all very good!  The appetizers were delivered to the table very quickly, as were the ramen bowls.  I can't remember all the different names of the different ramen bowls we ordered, but everyone at the table thought they were very good.  The staff was very social and engaging, and we would definitely recommend giving it a try.    The only challenge we had was finding the place, as the 222 bland street address entered in your GPS will only get you in the vicinity. Call the restaurant to avoid any confusion on where to go and where to park."}
{"text":"Futo Buta, the house of Ramen as I like to call it. Futo Buta is right off of the Light Rail so it has a perfect location for people just getting off of work or riding along the train looking for a place to eat. This place is a very small place so be warned, it can get very packed, very quickly. I thought the weirdest part was sitting at this large table in the middle of the room next to people I didn't know. It was my first time doing this so it felt very awkward. But the yummy food covered the awkwardness. We always try to get an appetizer, everywhere we go so we got the Rice Crispy Squares. Rice Crispy Squares are fried rice squares with Spicy Tuna and Wasabi Soy. Sort of a build it yourself kind of appetizer (picture below). This was probably my favorite dish of the night. The Ramen was very good too, but if you aren't use to things with lots of flavor... You may not enjoy it as much. All in all, it was a cute place to eat and had very flavorful foods. I would like to go back and try some of their Buns and Donburi.  Recently I tried their GreenTea & Honey Ice cream... OMG IT WAS TO DIE FOR! It does have an acquired taste but it is absolutely delicious."}
{"text":"The food was exceptional as was the service provided by Ariel.  She was vet knowledgeable about the menu even though the restaurant.  Being located along the Light Rail in SouthEnd is kind of cool too.   Be forewarned though.  The restaurant is hard to find. It's in the back left corner of the Post SouthEnd apartment bldg along the light rail."}
{"text":"I have never had ramen THIS good. Not even in NYC! I literally crave their rice crispy squares and tonkotsu ramen! It's so addicting. Everything else I've tried is delicious too, including the buta bowl, miso bowl, and pork belly buns!"}
{"text":"My hubby and I had an opportunity to eat there last night.  It's a small place but we'll decorated.  We didn't have to wait long at all because it was just the two of us.  Larger parties will have to wait longer during peak hours.  The vibe, atmosphere, music all great!! Staff super friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. We tried the rice crispy treats.. MUST TRY!!!  Then we both got different kinds of Ramen!!  They were so good!!  We are def going back and trying everything on the menu!!  Hats off to the Chef!!"}
{"text":"The food is amazing!  The place is not child friendly, no space for high chairs, i dont even think they have any? Not sure, we sat at the bar table near the window, other then that the food is so good!"}
{"text":"Its one of the only Ramen places in Charlotte (i think) and it's top notch.  I went there on a Wed evening and it was packed -- with a 30 minute wait! Not many restaurants can say that! However, it could be due to the fact that there is very limited seating. They've got a nice patio set up so I'm guessing there is seating out there when it's warm but for now it's pretty small.  The Ramen is delicious though! I get the Chizu which has lots of cheese and pesto (two of the best things on earth in my opinion) and we also got the Pork Belly Buns as an appetizer -- which was absolutely impeccable. They have beer, wine, and a wide assortment of Saki.  Kind of pricey but well worth it if you're a foodie.  The portion sizes of the ramen are pretty large so I can get 1.5 meals out of it. Next time I'll order ahead and do take out to avoid the wait and crowds. But I love love love this place!"}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying I am not a Ramen expert by any means but what I tried here was pretty delicious.  We started with the edamame, pork bun and the rice crispy squares which were yummy.  I tried the Fire and Ice ramen and the salmon was really flavorful my only issue was I wish there was a little bit more of it in the bowl. This place is a nice addition to Charlotte, I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"They don't even have hoisin sauce and the amount of space for seating is small. In the winter this is extremely ridiculous. My husband makes better ramen. It's super fatty."}
{"text":"I found this place a couple weeks ago and now its a weekly tradition trying the whole menu!!!"}
{"text":"Their ramen was really salty/savory, however their buns were perfect. The store had interesting and creative artworks at every corner."}
{"text":"Unique - yes Food was not very flavorful  Portion sizes of apps and entrees are weak when you incorporate the price  Some people love it but I cant get on that train  Editing to 4 stars after being able to compare to other ramen places... its growing on me some"}
{"text":"Futo Buta was such an amazing experience. It is a cute ramen place and since they opened up they have added a lot more on the menu.  Everything was so good."}
{"text":"This place is awesome for ramen noodles. The noodle bowls come out hot and are HUGE. I can't pronounce or remember what a lot of the ingredients were-but the spices they use to flavor their noodles are heavenly. They will also bring out extra spices for you to use. I got a pork belly hot bun as an appetizer before my noodles and it was delicious!! I also love the outdoor seating here."}
{"text":"Great food, cool place and nice location, I really like what they have on tap as well, Birdsong is my favy....."}
{"text":"Stepping into Futo Buta, I was welcomed warmly and had a parking question answered immediately. The vibe is ultra cool and felt like I was back in D.C. for a minute. I'm glad a place like this is in Charlotte now!  Our waiter was awesome- he answered all the questions we had, directed us to things to try, since we were newbies and was really informed on EVERYTHING.  I ordered the Tonkotsu -- which was amazing! The flavors meld into this wonderfully warm dish. The pork belly was delicious! The weather was super damp and cold, so this was even better! I also had the Warm Apple Sake, totally delicious!  I'm sad to say I didn't have any soft serve ice cream, but can't wait to try it next time. I also saw tea pots, which leads me to believe they will have hot tea soon!   You should know that this is set up like a traditional noodle house, seating is very close and it can get loud. I think it just adds to the ambiance. Go out and enjoy something different!"}
{"text":"Thank you to the previous Yelper who provided instructions on how to find this place! If you don't know where it is you turn on Rensselaer Ave (Or at Crispy Crepe if you are spatially inclined person like me). You can park for up to 3 hours at the Post Southend Parking garage at the end of the road. Futo Buta is straight toward the light rail from there.   The restaurant was very crowded when we arrived and we decided to sit at the bar instead of battling the intense summer heat. This is where they lost me a little bit - the chairs are so close together there is no hope in edging around and sitting in your seat. You must pull the stool all the way out and then awkwardly scoot it up once you have gotten near the bar.   The service at the bar was phenomenal. Our waiter was extremely friendly and kept our water glasses full and checked on our food and gave us suggestions. I ordered the tuna tataki to start. I wish they had this item on their regular menu and not just a featured special. It was a truly amazing and expertly seared tuna with a delicious sauce. The man ordered the pork buns which were good but were eclipsed by the tuna.   The main event of the visit unfortunately did not deliver as hoped. In the interest of full disclosure my experience with ramen has been the high MSG pseudo-filling packets you can get for a few cents from your local Walmart. The ramen noodles served at Futo Buta were completely different to those sad little packages so frequently eaten by college students. The broth however was bland and would have been better sans ginger slices. The pork in the broth was super tender but also rather fatty. The bowl was very filling and I took about half of it home.   I will probably go again when it cools down enough to sit outside, but at over $20 for a small plate and ramen I doubt I will become a regular."}
{"text":"This place is the real deal.  Food is exceptional.  Get ramen, that's what they do, haven't tried anything else, but I'm sure it's on point.  Must go to restaurant."}
{"text":"Ultimate comfort food and always great service :) definitely try the steamed pork buns, sushi, or ramen."}
{"text":"Yeah, quite simply the best ramen in the city. Bit pricey but the quality is excellent. Know that the inside is small, so if it's too cold or rainy to sit outside, you may be cramped or in for a wait for a table.  Outstanding service. Not top-drawer ramen, but good enough for me."}
{"text":"This is by far the best ramen I've had. Miso ramen and gyoza are both delicious. Love the atmosphere here too, although it can get crowded and busy. Try to go in the later hours to avoid an hour-long wait for a table."}
{"text":"Ramen was very salty for my taste but I'm very salt sensitive. Nice seating area outside and you can see the view of the city. Also got duck buns and the quality of buns weren't that great. Wasn't as bouncy and felt soggy but dry at the same time like they could break off."}
{"text":"Futo Buta is really as good as it gets. My boyfriend and I ordered to go on a Sunday night and it was delicious. We started off with the Tori Kara Age (Japanese friend chicken) which came with a chili mayo dip. While the flavor was on point, the fried chicken wasn't as crunchy as I anticipated which I'd argue was due to taking it in a to-go container. I'd be interested to try it again at the restaurant. Onto the ramen--ah the delicious ramen. I got the Tonkotsu and added bok choy. It was INCREDIBLE. The bone broth was outstanding--super rich and earthy. And the smoked pork belly makes my mouth water just thinking about it. My boyfriend got the Hiyashi and loved it, although it was more of a noodle bowl and had less broth than mine. I will absolutely be trying Futo Buta again, hopefully sit-down next time!"}
{"text":"Everything I've had was good. My only problem is that every food item other than Ramen is not filling at all. So you either get Ramen, or you get a snack."}
{"text":"The Fire and Ice dish was delish! Staff is great and the weather was perfect on this Sunday evening. Got a spot to watch the world walk by with their dogs, kids, significant others. Good time and place!"}
{"text":"The Ramen was definitely light years better than the packaged stuff and I loved the addition of pork belly (something I'm not generally a fan of)...but I wavered between a 3-4 star review due to the expense. By the time I added in the suggested spicy ground pork my soup was $14, I'm not sure it would be something I'd indulge in often....because, you know... it's soup."}
{"text":"There are two kinds of people in the world. Ramen people and Pho people.  I love Pho so I decided to try Ramen. I quickly found out I am a Pho person. I didn't like the broth at all.   I gave it 3 stars because the pork belly buns were an absolute hit."}
{"text":"Fantastic.  Great Service, friendly staff. Quick. Priced right. Food was delicious and piping hot. I had the Miso and Pork Buns. Atmosphere is relaxed."}
{"text":"Really good, perfect for cold day. A bit pricey, 1 app. 1 beer, 2 ramen bowls $50. The Ono sauce is SPICY. Cramped space but that's is part of the feel."}
{"text":"Always amazing food & service. Was the perfect place for a cold rainy Sunday. We had hot sake and the always delicious Brussel sprouts. The hamachi crudo is so yummy with the grapefruit and habanero peppers. The Miso ramen bowl is our favorite but they are all good! Love this place!"}
{"text":"We have been meaning to try this place for several months and it did not disappoint!  A tip is to park in the parking garage behind Crispy Crepe and walk towards the light rail.  The restaurant is on the right...you can't miss it.  We had four people on a Wednesday at 6 pm.  The place was busy and we had a small wait.  We were seated \"communal style\" beside other people at the large table in the middle.  You can get your own table if you get there early.  Three of us ordered the Miso Ramen and we all loved it!  The pork belly and egg is something special.  The other person in our group got small plates (Gyoza and pork belly and duck steam buns) and they all looked great.    The food came out quick and the service was spot on.  We will go back...SOON!"}
{"text":"Futo Buta always leaves me craving more!  We have now been three times and each time it becomes more and more addictive!  We love the Rice Crispy Squares, Tori Kara Age, and the Buns!  My go to Ramen is the Fire and Ice!  The fresh mint absolutely sets it off!  Tip : Don't park on South Blvd... there is a parking deck tucked back there for you. :)"}
{"text":"I think about this place at least once a week. Maybe dream of it. It comes to mind every time I consider eating out in Charlotte.  I'm stuck on Fire and Ice which is ramen with some smoked salmon and some other tasty veggies on it. Not too spicy for this Louisiana native (I prefer more spice!).  I did try Miso Hungry once.  Y'all, their pork belly!! Honestly, both the salmon and pork belly are perfectly smoked.  The ramen is incredible. Just get off the couch and go get some.  The fried chicken appetizer is delicious. They have some raw fish dishes that are tasty combos of ingredients. I doubt you can go wrong with anything on their menu.  Only regret: I NEVER have room for the soft serve."}
{"text":"Love this high classy fancy ramen. I get the one with the pork belly and add chorizo. So yummy and filling. I also try whatever ice cream flavor they have their that day."}
{"text":"Futo Buta is my absolute favorite place in Charlotte! I literally have my choice for dinner every year for my birthday and choose here every time! Brussels sprouts, ahi tuna krispi squares and all ramen dishes are"}
{"text":"I'm a fan of ramen. Yes, even the cheapo stuff. Unfortunately, like Michelle, I'm also old. I remember when you could get ten - yes, ten! - packs for a dollar. Maybe that's why I like it so. It's tough to eat so much food for a buck (sure, you need water, and heat, and it's not just a buck, but you get the idea).  Anyway, it turns out that ramen has come a long way since back then. Even in the grocery store, you're paying almost twice as much. When you go to somewhere like Futo Buta, it's a whole lot more. You could buy a truckload of the stuff - even at the much higher prices.  Sure, you get a great location along the light rail, and some awesome names for the dishes, along with sides like brussels sprouts that are nothing like your mom used to make (has everything changed? is nothing sacred in this world?!?), but ultimately, it's still a bowl of noodles, and yes, it is a beautiful one, but is it worth it? That's up to you.  We enjoyed a great lunch there (once we found it), but it was mostly because we were sitting on the rail trail on a great day out. You see, the service wasn't so great. The food wasn't particularly memorable. If we had brought our own ramen in a thermos (yes, I used to have a thermos in a lunch box, and I could even use my OG Yelp lunch box in a pinch), I daresay it would have been about as good, and maybe even better.  But the place looks great, so there is that."}
{"text":"I was excited to see a tiny ramen shop that was lively and packed full of people. A friend and I found a seat at the bar and ordered the tonkotsu ramen with the spicy stuff. The ramen looked decent - I would much rather have char siu than the smoked pork belly they use, but that is just my personal preference, my friend liked the smoked pork belly. The big problem was with the taste. There was none. The broth was both bland and a little spicy at the same time. I even added some of the shichimi togarashi they keep on the bar. Still bland, but at least it was at the spice level I wanted.   The noodles were slightly under cooked as well. I will say, they did a good job with the egg -- it was custardy and milky.   The service was quite good and the waiters were friendly.  Overall, not impressed with the food, but I'd give them another try before completely writing them off."}
{"text":"Service was awesome. Very small restaurant. Couples that didn't know each other were literally sitting next to each other as well as sharing napkins. Gyozas were good and served piping hot but a little greasy. I got the fire and ice. Salmon was cooked good. Broth was good. Husband got the tonkatsu ramen and he didn't like the pork in it. He said they were really small. Nice experience and convenient to take the light rail there."}
{"text":"although I have had ramen at restaurants before, I'd never been to a ramen themes restaurant before. So my review is going to weigh a little heavier on other criterion. Service- Pretty good! attentive, courteous, pretty knowledgeable, and personable. Ambiance- My gf and I sat outside. it was nice, not too loud, and good for people watching. Price- price was good! two people, drinks, apps, and entree was about &$50. keep in mind though, this isn't two ribeyes, this is bowls of noodle soup. Selection- This is why it wasn't 5 stars. there were only about 6ish ramen choices, and they weren't all that different from each other. I'm basing this on other restaurants that serve ramen, that had some different protein options than Futo has. a somewhat limited selection is why I'm giving Futo Buta a 4."}
{"text":"The wait was long but worth it. We waited 40 mins. It pretty small inside but has the nice exposed pipe ceiling, etc.. seats are tight (might elbow someone). Service was great. Our waiter know to split the bill already without us even asking.   I got the Buta Bowl; this the the ultimate big bowl with double the noodle, could also use a bit more veggies but I guess that's what the add-ons are for. The ramen isn't as chewy as other places which I like! The broth was semi-thick, I thought it was a bit oily but nonetheless tasted great. Not sure what's special about the on-egg but it wasn't anything special to me.   I realized Futo Buta means Fat Pig! What a great name. Love it. Definitely would come back to try other stuff on the menu."}
{"text":"Mixed reviews posted for this place but I have to say we had a great time. The restaurant is hidden and our nav had a hard time pointing us there but we parked on a side street and walked over. The outside patio is larger than the inside of the restaurant which is good until it starts to downpour. All the guests sitting outside were shuffled indoors to stand around and wait for a table.     No wait on Saturday night due to the quick turn around - score. The tables are super tiny or community style. Good for them, bad for you. The restaurant is very cool with murals on the walls. Nice for a quick date. Get in, eat some funky things and get out.   We ordered and got our food super fast. I had a pineapple cocktail which was good and strong. Somehow I've never had sake so it was something new. I don't know about the price being worth it but if I'm going out, I commit. We shared four things: the dumplings - pass, the fried chicken - get, the tuna rice cracker - can't miss and the tonkotsu - tried it regardless of reviews. The dumplings were not my thing; maybe I'm just used to a pork/shrimp combo. The fried chicken was good and crunchy - mayo dipping sauce was good, the sliced peppers on the plate were hot, burning mouth death. Good nibble to start the show. The tuna/rice is a must! It's a hot/cold item that reminded us of sushi. The tuna was fresh and cold in a jar which contrasted with the warm rice served separately. I could just have had the tuna and the fried chicken and been good to go. I'd return for those. The ramen was good but not outlandishly amazing. I liked the texture of the noodles and all the critters in the bowl. I give them credit for making noodles in house; most places just use premade. I would try it again on a less full stomach. We also had the strawberry basil soft serve which was super good - you could taste both flavors, it was cool and creamy like it should be. Next time we will probably try to take the train to Futo just to add to our adventure."}
{"text":"Recently went here for the first time, it was good! The staff was friendly and the service was fast (although our waitress forgot to bring out our Pork Buns). The ramen was average, my bowl had a lot of noodles but not enough broth. I thought it was a little overpriced. I paid $16 for a bowl of ramen and $10 for pork buns. If you want it spicy, they charge an extra dollar. I would come back."}
{"text":"Amazing ramen place. Very cool interior and amazing service."}
{"text":"The best Ramen in Charlotte. Hands down. Ingredients are incredibly fresh and flavorful. This is literally one of my favorite restaurants in the entire city."}
{"text":"I was very skeptical the first time I came here because I am a very picky eater. I am very particular about eggs and don't like them in my soup/noodles/pasta. I ended up ordering the chizu ramen (kept the whipped eggs in it) and had them add spicy pork. It was SO good!! If you want ramen, Futo Buta is definitely the place to go!"}
{"text":"Best ramen in town... actually the only ramen place in town (Sigh). I usually order the miso hungry ramen or tonkatsu. The flavors are there but wish they use regular egg noodles rather than red wheat noodles. I'm not used to the texture of red wheat noodles, although I do appreciate that it's locally sourced.  I also ordered the pork belly buns- it was good but very small portion for $9. My only gripe about this place is it's pretty expensive. I can find amazing quality ramen places in LA or NYC for similar prices or lower.   The place itself is modern, plays great R&B/hip hop music in the background. The servers can be forgetful at times but nonetheless friendly."}
{"text":"This is the best Ramen I've ever eaten. It's not close."}
{"text":"This place was delicious! Never would I have thought those noodles I ate to sustain myself in college for 30 cents a package could be turned into such a great dish. I ordered the Miso Ramen bowl. It had a rich broth full of flavor. The only thing I can say I didn't enjoy was the pork belly slices, but then again it is traditionally a fatty piece of meat and I tend to shy away.   As it starts to get colder, take note that the building is small, so a wait may become plausible. Additionally, they have very communal tables - can be uncomfortable at first but it's easy to ignore, or just make new friends!"}
{"text":"Definitely the best ramen in Charlotte. Granted there isn't currently a lot of competition in the city, but Futo Buta is very good. Before my fiance convinced me to visit here, I thought I didn't really like ramen after 2-3 mediocre restaurant experiences and the dreadful microwave cups. I've since tried ramen in quite a few different cities and have to say that Futo Buta stacks up pretty nicely with the rest. I've tried the miso, fire and ice, and the tonkatsu. I'm a big fan of the tonkatsu with its thicker broth, as well as the flavor in the fire and ice. The miso isn't my favorite flavor-wise, but my fiance likes it a lot. As is my gripe with just about every ramen place, I'd like more than one small piece of pork belly when I'm paying $10+ but still not a bad deal for all homemade, flavorful ramen."}
{"text":"Just went here with a big group of people. The service was quick and food was great. The brussel, gyoza and rice crispy apps were all very well made and light. We had also got the tonkatsu, shozu and Miso ramens. All of the were tasty. Best ramen we've had at Charlotte."}
{"text":"While not friendly for any kid under the age of 7 (depending on how tall they are anyway), this place qualifies as one of the few locations in NC I've found that actually had a vague idea of what porkbelly ramen is supposed to be. Unlike other misguided \"fusion\" restaurants this place not only knows what an onsen egg actually is, but also how to get it right."}
{"text":"The ramen is delicious. The flavors were exquisite. The ambience was cozy but unique and the staff friendly. No reason to down star this place."}
{"text":"Charlotte has always had a kind of ramen-bowl shaped void in it. Sure, there's a few places that offer it on the menu. But finally, we have a ramen house!   I love what Chef Michael is doing here. The menu is authentic, but not traditional Japanese.  All the noodles here are made from scratch in house using hard red winter wheat from Lindley Mills, NC. We love local/regional!   From the Izakaya (small plate) menu, I've had the Pork and Scallop Gyoza, the Rice Crispy Squares, and the Low Country Smoked Pork Belly. They're all good. For me, the Rice Crispy Squares are the must-order app. Not only is it a gorgeous plate, but the combination of the spicy tuna, crispy square, and sauce is just fantastic. If you don't like raw tuna, don't get this dish. Note on the buns, they come two to an order.   My favorite ramen bowl here is the Fire and Ice. I love the flavors of the kimchi broth and the smoked salmon. I've had both the Tonkotsu and the Miso (hungry). They're both good, but for me I think the Fire and Ice has the best broth. I always ask the server to bring me some spice to add to my bowl. The F&I doesn't come with an egg, but my friend Tom doesn't like them so I always get his. Score.   Make sure you check the Fresh Sheet posted inside on the wall to see all the special offerings of the day. The hamachi crudo is perfection. They also do a different ice cream flavor daily. Be sure to ask your server. Coke comes in a glass bottle. Sorry Diet Coke fans, you get a can. Muahahah (that's my evil laugh).  Everyone is really nice here, but the service tends to be on the slower side. Not a huge deal breaker or anything, just know that going into it. I always sit outside because I like to people watch along the light rail.  Location: your GPS may get confused. It's behind Crispy Crepe on South Blvd. Turn there and you can park on the first floor of the deck behind Crispy Crepe. Futo Buta is then located on the corner on the back side of the parking deck. It's right there on the Bland Street light rail station."}
{"text":"I have been to Futa Buta twice now and I loved it the second time just as much as the first. The ramen is so good. Definitely order some pork belly steamed buns as an appetizer. Sit outside if it's nice out. It's a great view of Uptown. The only downfall is that it can be tricky to find."}
{"text":"Pro tip: go here during non-peak eating hours for top notch Asian specialties with great service!  My boyfriend and I went here on a Friday night around 6:15pm and just barely beat the rush of Charlotteans trying to dive into a bowl of deliciousness. The seating is extremely limited, and be willing to sit on a bar stool facing a wall (which really,  isn't a bad deal when you're trying to discreetly slurp noodles).  The food is very much worth the unfortunate seating situation. Our waiter Calvin thoroughly explained all the food choices and gave recommendations. I really appreciated the proactive effort to interpret the menu items and give guidance on a range of Asian delicacies.  I highly recommend ordering the Fire & Ice ramen bowl. It has a medium level spiciness that pairs excellently with the salmon and vegetables. We also ordered a specialty ramen bowl with butternut squash and mushrooms that was somehow both vegan and creamy. I really enjoyed the food, and it was a perfect spot for a chilly winter night."}
{"text":"So delighted I stopped by this place. Didn't let the rain and upcoming flight deter me. Get thete sooner rather than later because it is a small intimate restaurant. Have always been a fan of Japanese food so was naturally curious about their menu and plan on going back when possible. For appetizers or a light snack I highly suggest fried miso tofu and the smoked pork l belly buns. If you want a cocktail and decide to opt out of sake get the futo fashion \"cherry bomb\". Finally, try the soft serve! Flavours change so be sure to ask! The fig cinnamon was great."}
{"text":"I appreciate the authenticity of the establishment, that small tight seating reminds you of the street side restaurants with limited seating that you find in random alley ways in Tokyo. I also appreciate the pace of the restaurant as well, bowls typically come on in 5-7 minutes each time I've been making it pseudo-fast casual. The dining staff is really cool once you start talking to them, some of them can be a bit standoff-ish but it adds to the restaurants edginess, almost that \"too cool\" vibe but I love that. The quality of ingredients for me has been consistent every time! Pork belly is on point! Tuna Tartare Rice Krispy Treats are my weakness. I typically don't enjoy fish, but I can totally wrap my tastebuds around it! I suggest to everyone to go check this place out and appreciate it's unique dining experience, very few places on Charlotte express charm like Futo Buta and am glad that original restaurants are making an impact, especially having South End become so gentrified with franchises. Chef Shortino seems like an amazing guy and from what I've read about him and following him on instagram, you can really see his passion for food, which is me the most important. Read some of the bad reviews, and it seems as though people like to shit on the little things wrong and use there review to cause harm. I wanted to balance the one I saw on instagram today and say Fuck you to that person :)!  Keep killin it guys!  Kenny"}
{"text":"A wonderful divergence from your typical Japanese restaurant, offering traditional style ramen bowls and other phenomenal meals. I can honestly say that since my first visit, I've begun to crave this restaurant weekly.   Having had multiple dishes here, I can honestly say that every dish is uniquely satisfying. First timers I recommend the Miso.  Add to that impeccable service, and a great atmosphere with a great music selection and I believe this restaurant deserves a full 5 stars."}
{"text":"This place does ramen right. Pork belly is mouthwatering and despite the fact that you are eating noodles in soup, It is absolutely filling. The rice crispy squares are delicious. Seating arrangements m are close quartered but it kind of makes the environment what it is. Cool spot for a date or just to come smash food with the boys on a saturday."}
{"text":"This ramen place is conveniently located right off of the Bland St. light rail station. The music was really loud inside the restaurant so my coworker and I decided to sit outside, which is a nice patio area.  Since this place is called Futo Buta (\"Fat Pig\"), I thought I should try something with pork belly. We ended up ordering the tofu skewers to start and I had the miso ramen as my main dish. The presentation of the meal is good, and makes it look pretty authentic. I like the fact that they make their noodles here but wish that the noodles are a little more chewy. The broth was OK, like many other yelpers mentioned, the soup isn't very salty, which I don't mind so much, but it's not very super flavorful overall and is definitely on the greasy side. The pork belly was good and looked appetizing, but also not as flavorful as chashu pork should be (it didn't feel like the pork absorbed the flavors). I did enjoy the corn they added in the ramen, which was very sweet.  I think it's unique that they do soft serve here (although a bit pricey, $5 for an order), but super awesome when it's a hot sunny day. We ended up ordering each a soft serve and tried both the strawberry banana and yuzu mango flavors they had that day. I preferred the yuzu mango flavor because the yuzu gives it a nice uplifting citrus taste to the mango's tropical flavors.   We had a very filling meal and the total came out be about ~$25  per person."}
{"text":"Instant ramen noodles would have tasted better than this. The ginger flavoring was way too overpowering."}
{"text":"Underwhelming. The pork belly was overcooked and the ramen was over salted. The duck rice bowl was delicious."}
{"text":"Be prepared to eat ramen with chopsticks and embrace the messy because the food is delicious! I love the miso ramen but other people I've eaten with have had wonderful things to say about the pork belly ramen. They have delicious ice cream too!"}
{"text":"Probably some of the best ramen I've had!  The spicy salmon is great and so is thenpork belly one! Hint: if you like spicy but want the pork belly, just ask for extra spice on the side!  Also their Brussels are amazing!!  They have a small indoor space but their outdoor space kills it when the weathers nice! Also cuts down on their wait times. If you don't want to wait, you can also do take-out!"}
{"text":"Good food but did not get very much of the protein I ordered.  My fiance didn't either.  I would go back...not sure my fiance would."}
{"text":"I stopped by for a quick bite to eat, as I live right down the street and walk by this place multiple times a day.  I really like it.  It was ramen based but had great seasoning.  I also had their ice cream, which I love to see the different flavors they offer on the board outside of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Love Futo Buta--great vegan options.  I usually get the veggie rice bowl, or the veggie ramen. And ALWAYS the brussel sprouts, ordered without the dried fish stuff that is typically served on top."}
{"text":"Sorry, the food quality doesn't live up the hype.  At best it's the fusion (Americanized, water down) style of ramen, and there is nowhere close to being the average good ramen.  Ramen broth is too oily and taste is really bland.  I couldn't even finish my small portion of ramen.  Presentation looks great but I don't think the owner had any authentic japanese ramen before.  Cozy environment, but pricey for their food.  Portion is way too small.    Great hangout spot, and great date night if you don't plan on eating a lot, because this place is loud and you have to seat close to each other in order to conduct a conversation.  Service is great, and therefore both service and environment deserve 2 stars.  May come back only for their soft serve ice cream cone.  Ramen?  Pass!"}
{"text":"Great pork belly, fantastic miso.  If you like spicy get the Ono sauce.  Japanese-southern fusion, delicious.  Appetizers are fantastic, favorite is the Brussels sprouts."}
{"text":"He wandered in here last week. Didn't have any prep kind of preconceive notion's. The pork belly Ramen was absolutely fabulous. We had two different flights as sake which was recommended by Michael. Both were fantastic. I had the sushi roll that was spicy and wonderful at the same time. We Definitely will be coming back here."}
{"text":"This review is solely based on my two visits here (so maybe biased)  I was disappointed at the first time I came here with a colleague for the following reasons: 1. We waited for almost 45mins for our ramen a to arrive  2. Tonkotsu ramen's broth was too greasy and bland for me. Not much flavor either.   The second time we were happy because we picked the right stuff: 1. Miso hungry ramen: adding miso and spice makes the bland broth much more flavorful. Even tho it's still have some room for improvement, I was generally quite satisfied with this ramen. The spicy pork that I added was really good!   2. Ice and fire: much clear but still flavorful broth. Mint balanced out the grease in the broth.  3. Pork belly buns: I am a fan! You should get this no doubt!"}
{"text":"Loved it, friendly atmosphere with great ramen with awesome pork stock.  I had Miso Ramen and it was fantastic.  Bean sprout, perfectly poached egg, one of the best smoked pork belly I've ever had, I'm used to a but heavier soup  (I'm from Japan) but it was great.  I didnt have any other app or desserts that other recommend but I loved every min of it"}
{"text":"I thought I'd go ahead and update my review. I'm going to say that this is my favorite restaurant in Charlotte at this moment in time. Everything is made from scratch and high quality ingredients are used. The price point is a little steep, but you get what you pay for. The food is so good that, after I leave the restaurant, I feel like the world gets a little more colorful and happier. I am a vegetarian, and I suggest ordering the Niwa ramen ($12) and the red miso tofu skewers ($5) if you are also vegetarian. Also, any of the daily soft serve ice creams are delicious. I highly recommend this place to anybody who likes authentic ramen, because I've tried every other ramen place in Charlotte and nothing comes close!"}
{"text":"This is a very hip restaurant located in the South End of North Carolina. Not only does it serve ramen, but there is sushi and also a handful of small plates that you can order. Most of what we ordered was delicious! We ordered the pork belly baos, the salmon belly, the tonkotsu ramen, and the miso ramen. If you are ever stumped between the two, go for the miso ramen. Hands down. The tonkotsu wasn't bad but it just wasn't buttery enough to be a tonkotsu in my opinion. If you do get the miso, try adding mushrooms to it and extra pork."}
{"text":"I finally got to try out this ramen joint recently...and I absolutely loved it!  I tried their very appetizing Fried Chicken, as well as their super-spicy Ramen...and both were amazing!  The Japanese Fried Chicken was SO delicious (perfectly fried and battered), I had to fight myself not to eat the whole thing (yes, calories!).  The spicy ramen bowl (I think it was the Buta Bowl?) with melt-in-your-mouth pork belly was incredibly good...and indeed hot 'n spicy, even for my Asian taste buds.  The restaurant wasn't visible from the street I was coming from...and it's a very small restaurant, but it made unique use of space with a very cool patio, overlooking the light rail.  Also, service was super-fast and friendly.  Overall, it was top notch in every way...food, presentation, service, even with its quirky ambiance.  Obviously I'm now a fan, and I plan to return...hopefully even drag my husband in (though he's not a ramen lover, he may change his mind?)!"}
{"text":"This place is great.  We found it by a walk along the light rail and can't wait to go back.   This was the best ramen I have ever had."}
{"text":"This place is brand new and it's delicious. It's a modern take on classic Ramen dishes, but still keeps the tradition. Very friendly staff and delicious food. Happy to finally have an authentic ramen restaurant in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Went out with the entire family of 5 for my oldest daughter's birthday.  The food was outstanding, and the staff was good.  Wasn't sure what to expect with a ramen place, but we couldn't have been happier."}
{"text":"I came in with my husband because I'm often craving ramen but can't bring myself to purchase the oodles and noodles packs with all of the preservatives and extra stuff in it. We came in and noticed that it was very tight inside. The seats aren't the most comfortable, especially not for a pregnant woman. They have bar height tables and stools so it's not really the place to go, find a comfy spot, and stay a while. This is more so an \"in and out\" type of restaurant. I ordered \"The Little Noodle\" bowl and added black garlic oil, mushrooms, and scallions. My husband ordered the \"Fire and Ice\" bowl that he was told is very popular. I LOVED my bowl! It came out piping hot and I was too impatient to let it cool off because it smelled so yummy! They give you plenty of ramen so I had plenty left over for lunch the next day which tasted just as yummy after being reheated! I also ordered the green tea and honey ice cream and it was absolutely AMAZING!! I wish it came with a spoon instead of the wooden spoon because mine became splintered and I wasn't able to inhale the ice cream like I really wanted to. All in all, I was very pleased with our experience but will probably either decide to sit on the patio or take our food to go in an effort to avoid the seating situation."}
{"text":"I love love this place!! The pork belly noodle bowl with the egg...awesome sauce!!!!! The broth was rich and savory!! I had enough for the next day!! Can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places in Charlotte. The entrees are terrific, especially the Buta Bowl. The location on the Rail Trail next to a light rail stop is convenient and the entrance being convenient to transit and pedestrian traffic rather than car traffic is such a huge plus in my opinion. It's a warm atmosphere with good service and delicious food."}
{"text":"My husband and I are big fans of Futo Buta!  The restaurant is a bit hard to find if you are not familiar with this area.  And the address doesn't help one bit.  However, if you know where Crispy Crepe is, you can simply turn right down the side street next to CC, and park in the garage directly on the right.  Futo Buta is just past the parking garage, on the back corner facing the Lynx Bland Street stop.   In warmer weather, their seating doubles with lots of seating available outside.  We've sat both inside and outside, and prefer the spaciousness of outdoor seating.  Plus, it is fun sitting next to the Lynx platform!  We usually start with the crispy rice squares with spicy tuna.  This dish is creatively done and tastes AMAZING.  We have also had the pork/scallop gyoza (very good), and tofu skewers (a bit bland).    Being a seafood lover, I usually get the Fire and Ice ramen with smoked salmon and kimchi broth as my entree.  The broth is very flavorful and a nicely spicy.  The salmon is very tender, and has a delicious seasoning.    As many other reviewers have noted, Futo Buta is generous with the ramen noodles.  Being a huge noodle fan, that was just fine with me.  And they provide plenty of broth, too.  I loved this dish.  My husband has had both the Tonkotso and Miso (Hungry) ramen bowls.  For the latter, he added the spiced pork, and it was incredible.  Very spicy, too.  Honestly, I preferred his Miso over my dish.    If you have room for dessert, try their soft serve of the day.  Regardless of how odd the combinations may seem, they always taste delicious.    Service is really good at Futo Buta.  Everyone is so friendly and pleasant, and the food is usually brought out relatively quickly.  We'll definitely keep returning!"}
{"text":"I have always rated this noodle heaven with four stars. However tonight we did takeout , Miso with extra pork belly, duck buns and gizo... The broth with the noodles was so salty we could not eat it! The duck in the duck buns were dry! I will go back and I am sure it will be four stars again but this trip was a giant disappointment."}
{"text":"Forget every experience you ever had with Ramen in college. This is the real deal. You will want to order everything on the menu, and no matter what you choose, you will not be disappointed. This is not a place where you find your favorite dish and order it every time...every dish will become your favorite dish.  Open late, great location, friendly staff, and so many food and drink options - this Charlotte spot is not to be missed!"}
{"text":"Literally one of my favorite places in CLT.  It is so good.  I have been here with a group of 6 and just me and a friend.  I love sitting on the patio.  The Miso is so good.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Extremely hard place to find,wait staff was awesome prices are high on some things, spicy tuna and rice crispy rice is way to sticky and very small portion of tuna, steam buns need some work not fluffy and don't hold together but the product was taste, definitely give it another shot"}
{"text":"Very good! This place is very inviting and the staff is great! I highly recommend. We got both pork and eggplant bun. The fried rice and tuna app was excellent, and miso Rahman was too.  The only reason I couldn't give it 5 stars is I thought it was slightly overpriced. 2 bun was $10. I thought 3 for $10 would have made more sense. The Rahman was $10-$14. We split a few item and it was $50 plus tip."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. It can get a little crowded but the patio in the summertime is amazing. The sushi is world class and the Miso Hungry bowl is always a staple. Never had a bad meal here."}
{"text":"Great first experience!! A didn't read the reviews before going but had heard from friends that this was was legit and I agree with them! I'm sure everything that I would have said about this place has been said so I'll spare the details.  My dish was good and I was impressed by the large bowl filled with deliciousness.  Service was great as well...the only thing is that when it gets busy, you're kinda rushed towards the end of your meal to pay and get up from the table.  I wasn't alarmed by this because I did see that on their website.  Just made me giggle when I saw that it was true.  Someone picked up our empty bowls and I went in for a sip of my full glass of wine and all of a sudden the check came.  Wait..whaaaaa....t...I wanted to order another glass of....ok I guess I'll just drink this one and be done.  LOL! No biggie.  Can't wait to go back with the hubster...he would love it!"}
{"text":"Really love this place!! We have gone twice and had a few apps and ramen. The pork goyza and poor steamed buns are both great! Wanted to try the fried chicken but were out. I have tried the traditional ramen and the miso. The traditional was good but little bland. The miso I added the spicy ground pork and was really good. Though they served it without the egg but no biggie. Overall like but the service is eh. Usually have to wait 10plus mins to have anyone approach. One tip don't go in the summer because the place is super hot! Difficult to eat hot soup when it feels like 100deg."}
{"text":"Read the reviews before I ordered and no one mentioned their takeout experience so here I am! Ordered a ramen bowl and Gyoza for pick up. It was ready within 15 minutes which was enough time for me to walk there. My dishes were both still steaming hot when I get them home! I got the pork ramen bowl and was a little disappointed there were only two pieces of meat and one was VERY fatty, but the rest of the bowl made up for it! Super yummy fresh ingredients and your tongue can tell! The Gyoza (dumplings) were also extremely flavorful and delicious. I'll definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"Do not get extra noodles!  I repeat!  Do not get extra noodles!  I absolutely adore this place. The atmosphere is amazing. The service was incredible and I was even given a free appetizer due to a mistake made in the kitchen. The pork buns are great and decently priced, the gyoza was very good, but the ramen. . . then ramen is where things went wrong. Typically when I order ramen I run out of noodles pretty quickly, so I figured this time around I would order extra noodles. When they set my miso ramen on the bar the first thing I tasted was the broth. The broth was fairly bland and they do not give you a lot of meat. I realize this is typical for ramen, but they really do not give you a lot of meat so I would recommend ordering extra. After a short while I noticed the broth gradually worsened in flavor. Due to ordering extra noodles, the broth was ruined entirely. I almost wish the server would have warned me, but since it was mostly my mistake I refuse to give this restaurant any less than 4 stars. I plan to go back and try the ramen as it comes."}
{"text":"Went on Sunday night and it was a great atmosphere outside on their wooden porch. Brought my dog and she just laid by my feet. We got the yellowtail and grapefruit appetizer (very interesting - was reconstructed sushi), the pork buns (SO GOOD), and the Fire & Ice Ramen. Virtually impossible to eat the ramen with chopsticks and I don't know why forks aren't given to people who are clearly struggling. Soda is in cans and no refills. It was nice to try this place, just for something new."}
{"text":"Yoooo this place is hella trendy. Like it's so hip I felt out of place. It's off the light rail in South End and kind of hard to find in a car but easier on foot. We've been watching a lot of Naruto lately so it felt good to get some proper ramen in us.   We went on a crowded Saturday night but only had to wait about 10 or 15 minutes for seating. We sat outside as gentrifiers walked their dogs, biked and jogged along the sidewalk. We talked Naruto as we sipped the delicious cocktails. By the time we got our ramen we were discussing Kabito in comparison to Garra.   At any rate it was good and you should definitely go here if you love delicious ramen. I've never really had ramen this good. It felt authentic.   The staff was great, the atmosphere was nice and the food was worth dealing with a slight crowd.  You should also watch Naruto if you haven't already. It's streaming on Netflix right now so there's no excuse.   Also, black lives matter."}
{"text":"The ramen noodles are the best. Many options to choose from. It's a cool joint to dine with friends, not so much a family atmosphere. I would have given it 5 stars except for the noise level and there's no place to stand while you wait for a table. It's also on the pricey side for noodles."}
{"text":"Awesome music selection. They played Foo Fighters, Zeppelin, Janis Joplin, and Johnny Cash all in a row."}
{"text":"I have to say that the establishment is nice looking inside and out. What I ate there was not what I was expecting. I read rave reviews from Yelp and had someone recommend it to me, but I was kind of disappointed. First things first before I say anything about the food: I am not a picky eater. I enjoy most of the things I eat. I am also not an expert on food, but I do know what I like and do not like.  From my (and my boyfriend's) experience:  My boyfriend had the Tonkatsu Ramen and I had a special ramen that's off their menu called the Buddha Bowl. Both were very oily, which was probably from the pork (which there was a lot of fat on), and possibly the soup. Not completely sure on the soup part though. I have eaten a lot of ramen and hand made noodles in my life, and I have to say I did not enjoy the noodles a lot. The texture was kind of off (which is weird for me to point out, because like I said I'm not a picky eater and I love all sorts of noodle dishes). The flavor of the soup from both bowls weren't fantastic as well for me/us. For me, the soup was on the salty side. Besides the ramen we ordered the Strawberry and Basil ice cream. At first I did not like the taste at all. It was different, but as I kept eating it I grew to like the taste and ended up eating all of it. I did not finish the ramen.   I gave this restaurant a rating of two stars because:  1. The place is cool looking from the inside out. Some may say it's kind of \"hipster\" looking.   2. The restaurant was a little hard to find, but eventually we found it.   3. The food did not taste good to me (besides the ice cream). Maybe the day I went the cooking was just a bit off, but I do not know unless I go again.   I do not know if I'll come here again. First experience was not fantastic, and it's a drive from where I live. If I ever have the urge to come back I will definitely try another dish and see where it takes me."}
{"text":"I love this place. The ramen I very good and I've had some of the best ramen around in NY. Futo is has a great selection. The buta bowl is my favorite. I also liked their ice cream as well."}
{"text":"Good food! Good service! Meals are prepared extremely fast.  I like the Miso Ramen, but really, haven't tried anything bad yet!"}
{"text":"Best noodle bar in Charlotte. Also good portions and good choices for share items. Bring your appetite because you should try all the hot items on the menu. Must eat in clt."}
{"text":"Get the Buddha bowl. It's delicious and it will clear up any cold you might have from the recent January freeze. Absolutely stellar, only downside is they're a bit crowded-- the price you pay for quality food. Also the bartender is the MAN!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice now and can definitely say this place is incredible. The ramen comes in several different forms of photo worthy bowls. I have yet to take a picture of my meals there because I'm always so excited to dig in. You MUST try the  brussel sprouts and/or the pork buns! But really, try them both. Oh my gosh yum!! Neither of the two will last long because you'll be shoveling those delicious appetizers in your mouth as fast as you can chew! The steamed buns are not your typical spongy bao bun, but the flavors are fantastic like everything else I've tasted on their menu. My favorite ramen bowl is the vegan option even though I'm not a vegan. I added an egg because I just love the flavors their chef has created in the vegetable broth. I've heard it's pretty common to make changes to that bowl. It's really delicious and beautifully presented. If you enjoy a little heat, be sure to get a taste of the chili oil and spices they bring out with the ramen. If you enjoy a steamy bowl of ramen, you're going to love this place. Get here earlier than you plan to eat. There is usually a wait and it's always worth it."}
{"text":"This place was great! Ramen was outstanding and the service was excellent. Restaurant is tight but they do a great job regardless. We got the miso hungry ramen and it was perfect. The buns are good but a little small for how much they are."}
{"text":"Ordered the pork bun and tonkotsu ramen. The bun was deelicious and I would come back here just to eat that again. The tonkotsu was good. The broth left me wanting something more, but the noodles were good and the pork slices even better. I hear the miso ramen is excellent so I will be back to try that. The atmosphere was very warm, lots of wood paneling, and mostly bar/shared seating with a couple standalone tables. Really glad to see a great ramen spot open up in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"What great food in Charlotte. The Ramen here is as good as it gets. Reminds me of the last time I had Ramen this good and it was years ago in Tokyo.  We also had spicy tuna on crispy rice cakes that were delicious and amazing brussel sprouts. Honestly, the Ramen is big and very filling. It's all you need but tough to pass up the other appetizers. I had the Ramen with salmon. Highly recommended. This place gets packed and it is small. Worth the wait. They move quickly once seated."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner with my parents and enjoyed the crispy rice app, veggie steamed buns, Brussels sprouts, special sushi roll and Niwa ramen. All was delicious and I would highly recommend! The staff was super friendly and the vibe is casual but focused. Loved the ramen!"}
{"text":"Overpriced... Not as flavorful as ramen I have had in NYC and San Francisco... and that too was at a much lower price. Also, the music is too loud. I gave it a 2 star because our server was very nice."}
{"text":"Holy moly amazing! This ramen establishment is the be all end all of amazing noodle soup dishes. Their portions are huge and that broth is something out of a fairy tail, I'm pretty sure it has magical healing powers (ok, so maybe not, but it is velvety and rich!)   The chef prides himself on finding the best local ingredients to add to his ramen as well as some unique sake pairings that you might not find elsewhere. There is also a soft serve ice cream machine that serves up creamy concoctions like strawberry basil or avacado. It's always changing so you never know what you're going to get when to enter.   This is definitely a noodle house worth checking out in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Exactly what Charlotte was missing. Fantastic ramen - for Charlotte.  More authentic than I was expecting but not exactly what you might get in NYC or a larger metro city.  4 stars as relative to what else you might find in the area this place is great.  The decor and atmosphere is great.  Seating is communal style reminding me of beloved Wagamamas.... I've tried most of the appetizers and they are great, standouts are the dumplings, peppers and fried chicken. Get the spicy pork added to your ramen... Yum!"}
{"text":"This place has some of the best ramen I've eaten in my life. Located in such a cute and urban spot, I actually visited here twice on my trip to Charlotte because of how delicious it is. Ordered everything from apps to dessert to craft beer. If I ever happen to be in the area again, you can bet I'll return! :)"}
{"text":"Who is excited about this place? This girl! I've been to Futo Buta A.K.A. Awesome Town twice, and I love it. Ramen holds a special place in my heart and Futo Buta does it so well. I've tried the tonkatsu (my personal favorite) and the shoyu. Both are fantastic, however, I'd ask to skip the sliced ginger on my bowl. Its a little strong. Despite that tiny personal preference, I will not deduct points. Why? The broth is superb, the pork is succulent, and give me two orders of the pork buns because I can never get enough. You're in luck. I'm even going to give you advice on what to drink. They serve alcohol but I love their fresh strawberry lemonade. Its crisp, slightly bitter (how I like it) and full of potent strawberry awesomeness. Lastly, don't forget dessert. Their ice cream is phenomenal. Get some!"}
{"text":"Had the fire and ice.  It was a beautiful bowl of food.  Nice service.  I always envy the people eating on the patio when I run by.  The one slight downside is that their broth could use more flavor.  It definitely wasn't bad and I am totally going back, but it just lacked a little something.  Either way, I recommend Futo Buta."}
{"text":"Bland ramen. Not a lot of flavor maybe it's to appeal to audiences but there was a lack of flavor all around which was extremely disappointing. Especially considering it was $50 for two people. Not authentic or flavorful."}
{"text":"I love this place! Metro feel in our up and coming South End.. Delicious Ramen .. I could eat this every day! Yummm!!"}
{"text":"Pecan smoked pork belly in ramen is hands down must eat! Deep fried Brussels sprouts were delish. So full after ordering way too much. Want to try their soft serve dessert next time. Good selection of sake."}
{"text":"We recently came here for dinner and I am so glad that we did. My only mistake was eating a work potluck for lunch that had left me full even hours later. Elaine was our server and she was wonderful.   My fiancé got the Miso bowl and added spicy pork. I just got the gyoza and brussel sprouts. Everything was amazing. Let me say it again - EVERYTHING was amazing. We will be back and this time, I will come with an empty tummy."}
{"text":"Yum yum yum. I have been hoping for a place in Charlotte that made their own ramen noodles. I finally found the place. It's a little off the beaten path however it is delicious. Service is great in a great outdoor patio. They even have Coca Cola from Mexico. I highly recommend it"}
{"text":"The best place for Pho in the South End area! Their seasonal Pho is always great. They even offer a vegan Pho that is delicious! Very convenient walk from anywhere in the South End. It is also located right next to a line station, making getting to Futo Buta an easy commute from anywhere on the line."}
{"text":"Really awesome gem in the South End, Futo Buta brings a bit of Japanese swagger to the neighborhood with awesome Ramen dishes that will sooth your voracious appetites.  Man this place gets packed! There's not that much room on the inside, or outside and this is a really popular place. When I arrived on a Friday evening, there was a 45 minute wait. I heard good things about this place and was willing to wait for it. The waitstaff easily took down my phone number and as I went to walk around, received a simple text to return back.   Everything looked and smelled extremely fresh. The waitress was very informative and helped us decide which was her favorite option of all the Ramen combinations.  One thing that I was a bit skeptical was how \"wordy\" Futo Buta got with describing their dishes. Like I don't expect this place to have Wagyu beef..  Regardless, I had a great experience and had a great meal. Our group also split a bottle of Sake which was equally as refreshing. Kanpai!"}
{"text":"This is a great place during the winter! VERY unique and they allow you to customize your bowl. DO NOT go during the summer months, as the restaurant feels like a SAUNA. It is miserable. Hot and sweaty while you're eating a hot meal."}
{"text":"House Made Ramen Noodles? Creamy and flavorful broth? Fried Japanese Chicken? Why are you still reading this... have I not convinced you enough yet to visit this place? It is amazing and I wish I had a location back home in Milwaukee. I have been here every time I visit Charlotte and I have to say, this is one of my favorites because the food is delicious and they have great service.   Seating can be a little tight during rush lunch hour, but I've never had to wait long to be seated. If you are using google maps to find this location, you might be a little lost since it leads you to a random building. Since the store front does not face the street, I would find any street or garage parking and walk towards the train tracks. which should lead you to the restaurant. You can also call the restaurant if you are lost. They were very patient when I called for directions.   I ordered the miso ramen with Japanese fried chicken and it is my favorite. It comes with pork belly, baby bok choy, egg and corn."}
{"text":"Brought my in laws from japan here. They absolutely loved it. They said it was just like home. We will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"This was the most amazing food!   I take back everything I ever said abt Charlotte having crappy food ... be sure to get the beer salad, shosito peppers and the icecream for desert!"}
{"text":"My two favorites are the pork broth ramen alongside with an amazing Sapporo beer on tap with frozen Sapporo foam to top it off! Delicious!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and food! Sat at the bar and got wonderful service. They have an amazing sake selection, which is rare. Lots of pork belly on the menu, but I had the vegan ramen and they added tofu. Incredible! Such a light broth, so refreshing and filling."}
{"text":"Spot on savory and spicy flavors topped off with rock/punk music playing in the background -need I say more?"}
{"text":"Crazy crowded (they really pack you in to an almost uncomfortable point, especially at the long \"family style\" table down the middle of the room) but good food and friendly service."}
{"text":"Charlotte finally has a fabulous spot for ramen. The Tonkatsu Ramen has levels of flavor you'd never anticipate in a soup. Robust, deep, and delicious, the scallions and pickled ginger aren't just there to look pretty, they add to the flavor of the broth. The noodles are just the right texture to not get lost in the soup. The pork belly, well, I could eat a plate of it and still want more. My vegetarian friend had the Niwa ramen and raved about how delicious it was. Worst part was he refused to share.  We started with the fried Brussel Sprouts & fought over the last piece - crispy, salty, and sweet little taste bombs.   Can't wait to return."}
{"text":"Gah, I so wanted to fall in love with Futo Buta. Having eaten various regional styles of ramen in Japan I was so excited about its potential. It took me ages to finally try it, nervous this place, like many other asian spots in Charlotte before it, would let me down. Unfortunately it did just that. So I gave it another chance, ordering other things, still....nah.    Tonkotsu ramen when done right is one of the best foods out there. Hot, rich, creamy, meaty broth with an incredible depth of flavor. I never would bother ordering miso or shoyu as those are too easy. Tonkotsu broth, however,  takes hours upon hours to develop the right flavor. So on my first visit, I felt the best way to test their ramen making skills was to start with the piece de resistance of Japanese ramen.     Before I get to the ramen, we started with an order of the brussel sprouts and the karaage (fried chicken). The brussels were horribly under seasoned. The karaage was more like popcorn chicken bits and would have fared better with the traditional accompaniments (i.e salt, lemon, mayo) than the so-so runny dipping sauce it came with. Not bad but it had me wishing for the real thing. Alright now for the ramen. It came out looking beautiful. All the usual garnishes were there and THEN some. I tasted one spoonful of the broth and my heart sank a little bit. The right flavors were there, but dialed WAAAAAAYYYY down. As if the broth hadn't been cooked long enough, or they watered it down to get more servings out of it. What a shame. The pork however was absolutely delicious. The onsen egg was a nice idea but soft boiled eggs fare better in tonkotsu broth, so I missed that texture in there. The noodles, while I appreciate that they make them in house, are cooked too long, lacking a slight chew that one looks for in a ramen noodle. I cannot say on any level that the ramen was terrible. It just wasn't right. If you have never had the real thing before, I can see how this would still be delicious. But if you have a point of reference its rather disappointing. Especially considering the bill. To avoid being a complete negative Nancy I will say that the avocado soft serve was really tasty, if I lived in this neighborhood I would be dropping in or this in the summer on the regs, and they do have a really nice pot of green tea.     Since my friends adore this place they once again invited me for a meal there. I accepted with hesitation but figured it wouldn't be right for me to write off a place after one visit. I decide I would go again and try other things off the menu. This time around I ordered the pork belly buns and the tuna donburi. The pork belly buns were pretty good, but I suppose I was expecting pieces of pork like what comes in the ramen, but instead of melt in your mouth succulence it was quite dry and chewy. A little over sauced too, since gochujang has a tendency to be overpowering. But it was a decent size for the price I would say. Now the tuna donburi, while appealing to the eye, was pretty bad. The tuna was super fishy tasting (seconded by my friend who tried what I no longer had interest in eating), made worse by the pulverized texture of the tuna. No amount of soy sauce could help with the flavor. I had a few bites and couldn't stomach any more.I did try a spoonful of my friends shoyu ramen and it was rather tasty, far more flavor than the tonkotsu broth (which is also tried again..same verdict).     As for service, the waitress we have had both times is very friendly and peppy, However one can't help but notice the other waitress' attitude dropping off or picking up plates as well as her interaction with other patrons. Its as if she came to work immediately finding out her dog died or something. She has a miserable expression on her face, slams down plates and rolls her eyes. Not sure why she has a job dealing with people as she seems to loathe them.   To wrap up this epically long review....I don't really get the hype. Perhaps very few people in Charlotte have had the real thing, or perhaps they do as my friends do which is add in every hot sauce and condiment until you can't even taste what was in there in the first place. But even still the taste of that tuna was universally inexcusable. I will say that the tunes they play in here are really quite brilliant but there is a still an authentic ramen void in my heart, right along side authentic Korean food and a place like The Steeple. Bummer."}
{"text":"If you're in the mood for ramen - Futo Buta is the place to go! I love their Rice Crispy Squares app (fried rice cubes with spicy tuna & wasabi soy sauce), the Duck Confit Bun, and as for ramen - go for the Tonkotsu! The broth is crazy flavorful, there's pork belly (my fave!), and it'll give you lunch for the next day.   Tip: Ramen tastes even better the next day!"}
{"text":"I wanted to try traditional ramen, so I was lead here. I had the clear broth ramen which was very good. I tried my bfs pork bone marrow broth and I didn't care for it. Maybe a little too authentic for my taste buds. I had the green tea ice cream for dessert, it was also very good."}
{"text":"Futo Buta never disappoints! The service is wonderful, when you walk in you're greeted by the owner and the servers are so relaxed in how they speak to you, its all part of the atmosphere they hope to create. The interior is clean, modern wood. I don't want to spoil it for you, so don't forget to check out the bathrooms!  My last experience I sat outside and enjoyed the great patio set up. Bright, fun green plastic chairs make for a quieter experience instead of hearing metal dragging across the cement like most places. The planters create a little nook, and the tables are perfectly spaced apart so you don't feel on top of other diners.  My waiter was so kind due to my friend getting lost for over 20 minutes. He didn't make me feel bad about waiting so long and checked on me. When she did arrive we ordered 2 ramen bowls with pork belly, a soft boiled egg, and lots of other goodies. It was perfectly hot, incredibly flavorful, and I had leftovers for dinner. Next time I will be trying those steamed pork buns because the picture someone has put on Yelp looks awesome!"}
{"text":"Ok, I don't want to say I'm an expert on ramen but I know good ramen. This place is pretty d@£n good. I had the Tonkotsu and added wakame and bok choy to it. They are in a very small place so you better get there early or do reservations for bigger groups. I sat at the bar and the bartender was super friendly and funny. I asked her a few questions and she seem knowledgeable with the menu. When my food came I was a bit disappointed not because of the taste but the temperature of it was cold. Like it's been siting out for a while, I know it wasn't because you can see the kitchen and the orders come right there where you can see them coming out. I thought it was going to be boiling hot like all of the other ramen I have had. The eggs were ice cold, the pork (delicious taste) was cold and noodles were cold and the broth was cold, so that's the only thing that I was sad about."}
{"text":"So, turns out I'm old. We went out for a night on the town for The Husband's birthday. We had some yummy drinks and hit a hardcore thumping nightspot. Then we decided to leave because it was too loud, getting late and we had to head home. As we walked back to the car and passed Futo Buta, one of our friends says, \"Ooh! The Brussels sprouts!\"  The Brussels sprouts are fried with an absolutely delicious mixture of soy sauce, sea salt, sesame and bonito. They're truly perfection! There's a nice smoky flavor on the back and the sweetness stays for just the perfect length of time. It doesn't linger, but it's not so quick that you miss it. The Tori Kara Age (Japanese fried chicken) is also a great choice. They break out the sea salt again, but with these you get some ginger, lime and mint as well. If you like mayo, there's a chili version of it for a dip.   On the first visit, I got the Tonkotsu bowl with ground pork and it was amazing. I don't typically like what my Jersey friend calls \"dippy eggs,\" but that's the way they come in the bowls.  I think it's good, though. It definitely adds a level of creamy yum that would be missed.   Quick recap? We're old. We left a bar and went to go get Brussels sprouts. But it was totally worth it. And I'd do it again. You can bet on it."}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants in Charlotte. It's worth any wait they have. If you love salt order the Chizu or however you spell it. (pictured) Pork belly falls apart in your mouth and basically melts. I can usually make two meals out of it with leftovers. You would be doing yourself, family, and friends a disgrace by not coming here."}
{"text":"Love sitting outside with the pup here. I could've had ten orders of the crispy Brussels. The crispy tuna and pork buns were also pretty good. The Shoyu ramen was lighter and quite perfect."}
{"text":"Hands down THE BEST RAMEN IN CHARLOTTE! This is on my family's weekly rotation! The slither of pork belly in the noodles is always the best part of my noodle experience! The bar is my favorite spot to meet people in the area!"}
{"text":"Too many great things to list. Come here and try to restrain yourself. I didn't succeed. Amazing date spot. Apps, dinner, dessert, and drinks for 100 bucks before tip. Almost over staffed but it didn't bother me. Jimmy John's fast service. I will be back many times."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Futo Buta. I have been here a few times with just another person to 8. The service both times was friendly, fast and attentive. I get the Chizu every time. I want to try other things but it's just so good every time. I live in south end so this place is within 5 minutes walking and I'll probably see myself going once a week."}
{"text":"I am always in search of the best food anywhere I go. Being Asian myself, I am super critical of Asian food because it should taste authentic and not overrated. I have been to a lot of ramen shops and unfortunately, I am always a big disappointed. Futo Buta exceeded my expectations. For the first time ever, i received my ramen piping hot with an abundance of fresh ingredients. The broth was full of flavor and richness without being too oily and the noodles were the perfect texture. Amazing. Just be ready to wait a bit for a spot though because they get pretty busy!"}
{"text":"Amazing food amazing staff. Never had real ramen but was blown away at how great it was."}
{"text":"God knows I wanted to love this place. Since returning from Asia I haven't found great ramen. This place almost met the mark, but not quite. First this place is like Asian fusion rather than a traditional ramen shop, which is fine just now how friends had explained it to me.   Visited on a Friday night and they had a wait. We put our name on the list for a table but noticed the back bar was empty minus one girl sitting alone. Twenty minutes goes by and they call us to sit at the bar that had been empty from the get go?!? Why make us wait?   Ordered the shoyu which was decent, but a bit too salty and could use some extra flavor. The egg inside was to die for without a doubt. Would definitely come back, but probably not on a weekend.  Pro-tip: try to sit outside or bring a jacket because they keep this place super cold!"}
{"text":"Went on a cold night and it really hit the spot! Rice crispy squares were my favorite thing we had. Absolutely amazing. The duck confit buns were great, but a little overpriced in my opinion. The ramen was very good as well. I look forward to trying more flavors. We finished with green tea soft serve. So yummy! We will be back."}
{"text":"Second time visiting Futo Buto. We parked in the garage behind Crispy Crepe and walked back to the restaurant on the tracks. It was packed for a Wednesday night. We took the waitress up on a sake sample but order wine instead.  This time I tried (and we shared) the rice crispy/tuna appetizer, the fire and ice ramen (with salmon) and the pork belly taco.  First, the food -- I loved the Rice Crispy. Was like an amazing hash brown with tuna on top. Made for sharing and truly excellent. It is fried but when you share, calories don't count.   Next the Fire and Ice...  I love Ramen but this broth was a bit too intense for me. The noodles and salmon were excellent but tasted this broth well after dinner.   Pork bell taco w/ steamed taco. Super good.   Waitress and service were great.   I really like this place. It just feels fun, trendy and all around good!"}
{"text":"I am a ramen snob as I've tried it in DC, NY, IL, LA and now NC. Everywhere I go I make sure to try the best. Honestly I've never not finished my bowl of ramen before. I got the tonkotsu ramen and was immediately grossed out by how oily the ramen is. Maybe they're trying to cater to the folks here who are used to a stick of butter and grease. I didn't find it appetizing. I actually forced myself to take a few more bites because I didn't want to waste my money. I also got the pork bun which was just subpar. Way overpriced for what it is. They should work on improving their slaw. I'm extremely disappointed that this was a terrible find. Please if you don't want a heart attack don't get the tonkotsu ramen. Maybe the others are better."}
{"text":"Five stars across the board! The place was hard to locate, since the street address puts them at the other end of the building on Bland St, but once I found the garage, it was on. We had the Tori Kara Age (fried chicken) and the Rice Crispy Squares appetizers, what a treat, especially the chicken, every bite tasted like crispy chicken skin. The tuna was fresh and seasoned nicely, presentation was wonderful. I had the Tonkatsu pork broth with pork belly and it was full of veggies and loaded with flavor.  My wife enjoyed the Niwa vegan broth with veggies, wonderful as well. I finished all mine and was jealous when she had leftovers a little later in the day.  We will be back often!"}
{"text":"Nice restaurant. The inside can't hold too many people but with a 90° day,  the inside was perfect. It's in South End Charlotte where there is a lot of up and coming businesses and construction. Now to the food. It was delicious! I got the hot and spicy ramen..i think it was called Fire and Ice. The broth was delicious,  not as spicy as i would have liked but still really good and you can add sauces."}
{"text":"I can't say a thing about the ambiance or service because I haven't been inside Futo Buta, but I'd heard and read enough about it that I wanted to try it out.. and on one random cold evening when I was craving a bowl of hot and spicy ramen, my husband brought home some from Futo Buta! I've done take out Chinese and Thai a million times, Ramen however - I hadn't done that. I was a little skeptical, but we went for it anyway. I am happy to report that take-out ramen can be Amazing! it didn't get cold or soggy or ... well may be the presentation got a wee bit messed up, but I can live with that.  We got a few different items off the menu - roasted eggplant and zucchini buns, fire and ice & Chizu ramen, hamachi crudo and tofu skewers. My most favorite was the fire & ice ramen and least favorite were the tofu skewers. The ramen was salty, spicy, and just overall flavorful - exactly what I was craving! the skewers were flavorful, but a little too sweet and saucy for me. I enjoyed the buns and hamachi, but I have mixed feelings about the chizu ramen. An overly cheesy / eggy ramen is not typically what I think of when I think ramen.  I look forward to dining at the restaurant in the near future, but if that doesn't happen soon enough, I'll be going back for more take out."}
{"text":"I think I like this little spot. It was cozy and made me feel like I was in a ramen house in Japan. We had the Crispy Rice Squares which are fried squares of rice, spicy tuna and wasabi sauce, it was delicious! I chose the Fire and Ice which was a smoked salmon based ramen in a kimchi and dashi broth. It was a nice light broth, that left me satisfyingly full."}
{"text":"Incredible dinner. In town for a few days and wife and I loved this place! Kaarage and fried brussel sprouts were incredible. Tonkotsu ramen is slightly creamy and delicious. Soooo worth the wait."}
{"text":"First... this place is IMPOSSIBLE to find. Get out your Google maps! It is nowhere NEAR Bland Street (it's mailing address). It is across the light rail tracks from the Bland Station and the Trolley Powerhouse Museum.  OK. Now that you've found it... be prepared to get up close and personal with the other diners. This place is pretty small and only has a few tables. You can eat at the bar or at a little counter they have built against the window. Also, it is SUPER loud. Don't come here on a first date if you want to get to know each other!  The food: Our group had the tonkotsu ramen and the miso ramen. The miso was more authentic. The tonkotsu was a little too greasy and not salty enough (we lived in Japan for over 11 years and have tasted LOTS of ramen... trust me). If you're not a purist, both are probably excellent. Also, for my taste, the noodles could have been cooked a little bit more, but that could be personal preference.  The pork belly buns... AMAZING! Also, they come 2 to a plate, but since we had 3 in our group, they were willing to do 1.5 orders so we could get 3 buns. That's customer service!  Speaking of customer service, the food comes out FAST! We were hungry when we got there, so that was a good thing!  One thing that IS authentic is the tiny water glasses--straight up Japanese style there! They refill often and leave a bottle nearby, so no problem... just a funny observation.  Looks like they have a soft serve flavor of the day. When we were there it was yuzu mango. SOOOO good. And a nice palate cleanser after all the greasy food (pork belly is NOT low fat)!  By the time we left, there was a long line of people waiting to get in, so even though they are hard to find, they are making a name for themselves. Would I go back? Heck yeah. There are about 10 other things on the menu that I want to try. Will I bring my Japanese husband with me (he wasn't with us on this visit)? Heck no! I don't want to hear all his comments about this isn't authentic and that isn't authentic, blah, blah, blah. This little place will remain MY secret (hope he's not reading my Yelp reviews)!"}
{"text":"Since I moved to Charlotte four months ago, I've been to lots of good restaurants, but none that blew me away.   Futo Buta changed all of that.  Food: We started with two appetizers: the pork and scallop gyoza and the smoked pork belly buns. When we took our first bite of each, we simply said \"yum.\" This was our first time trying ramen so we asked our sweet waitress for recommendations. I was safe and ordered the Tonkotsu ramen which was comforting and bursting with flavor. My boyfriend got the Fire and Ice (kimchi flavor) and he slurped that baby up.   Atmosphere: It's right on the light rail, which automatically screams hip and cool. On a beautiful day, sit outside to watch all the runners, walkers, puppies, trains, and hipstery shenanigans. Across the tracks are a bunch of restaurants and bars (Oak Room, All American, Slate Billiards, Hot Taco) so the area is buzzing with activity. During the colder months, get there early because the inside is small.   Loved it."}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend went last night. It was amazing. The ramen was amazing. Also got the green tea ice cream which was outstounding!"}
{"text":"Futo Buta, you should change your name to \"Little Bowl of Heaven\" ! We had awesome service here. We tried the pork belly buns and they were incredible. Like if you don't get those and you like pork... you are seriously missing out in life. I wish they were slightly cheaper so I could have ordered more of them.   I had the butternut ramen soup and it was divine. So rich and tasty. My husband got the Miso Hungry one and his pork was SO GOOD.  This is a fantastic place to take a date if you don't mind slurping some ramen together. Music is a little loud to talk inside.. but eating outside would be nice. Cannot wait to go back.."}
{"text":"In from out of town and have this place a try. Was able to immediately sit at the bar. Service was fine.   Tori Kara Age (Japanese Fried Chicken) - 5/5. Absolutely delicious. Super crispy, moist and flavorful. Squeeze the lime in top. The sauce that it comes with is delicious, but a little spicy. It's not necessary, but brings the chicken to another level.   Tonkatsu Ramen - 3/5. I wanted to like it. It was fine though. The noodles were good-great thickness and chewy. Egg was perfectly cooked. The char sui was a little different, where it's seared. The broth, which is the foundation for any ramen, was lacking. It was one note and didn't have really any flavor. I added the hot sauce and it still do anything for me. If the broth was better then the stars would be higher. Tonkatsu Ramen is all about deep, milky, flavorful broth."}
{"text":"Been about 3-4 times now and every time I am never disappointed. The ramen is always incredibly flavorful, service is always great.  Go early because you'll most likely have a wait. Order everything! The Fire and Ice Ramen is my favorite!"}
{"text":"Delicious ramen with a rich broth: I have had the tonkontsu and miso and both are delicious. My friend had the fire and ice and he said it was amazing. pork belly buns are rich and scrumptious. They also have delicious Brussel sprouts and their beet salad is a must order with candied dates. Their green tea honey ice cream is smooth and refreshing. Servers are really nice but be warned it's crowded and there might be a long wait even on weekdays. I usually get takeout."}
{"text":"One of the best bowls of ramen I've had. I had the spicy tonkotsu, to which I added spicy ground pork which I was amazing. The broth was everything you'd want from a nice, creamy, fatty pork broth and the noodles were perfect. Whatever the do to their pork belly had me going wild, because It was some of the best I've tasted. If you love ramen, please don't hesitate, GO! There's a little wait but it worth it."}
{"text":"I am pretty sure they put drugs in their food. Like ... addictive drugs. Because I literally crave the chizu all the time.   I was wary to try a ramen place. I didn't even like it in college; why would I bother going to a restaurant that serves just ramen, ick? But oh, I was so wrong.   My friend recommended the chizu the first time I went and I ordered it based on her recommendation. It was so good that I now order it every time; I decided there's no way to top this dish.   My yoga friends and I eat here all the time; sometimes once a week, and I will never get tired of it. We also love the brussel sprouts.  Sushi is good, but it's definitely not a sushi place, so if that's what I was craving I would go elsewhere. Ice cream is just ok, too, but it's ok because I'm usually too full for dessert anyway!"}
{"text":"Inconsistent food. They touch the food with hands and no gloves. Food has dropped out of the window onto surfaces and placed before me. Tables are not wiped. Team motto \"make them wait, make them pay and make them say thank you.\" Manager was not present. Awful experiences. Never recommending to anyone."}
{"text":"Everything is right except for the food. It's just plain bad, unfortunately.  I had the Niwa ramen dish and I couldn't make myself finish eating it. It was utterly flavorless and incredibly disappointing. Basic Chinese clear vegetable soups have more flavor infused in them. Completely bland.  The vegan donburi was not much better, but was edible. I only had a couple bites since my friend ordered this. He also did not finish his dish.  The Miso tofu skewers were pretty good, but obviously not good enough to make up for the entrees being awful. Will not return."}
{"text":"Futon has become our favorite neighborhood restaurant. Mike, Julie and Stephanie always remember us and our favorite orders. The food is of course amazing and I love the sake flights. What makes Futo different is the amazing staff and the personal attention from the staff. Extra shout out to Stephanie for teaching us about Sake and always remembering our names."}
{"text":"Now, I been trying to hit Futo Buta for a while now. First time I came in the afternoon they had a major rush. The place was so small and crowded that there weren't any seats. There was a wait already so we decided to leave. There is patio seating, but i doubt anyone wants to eat there if it's raining or freezing cold.  Then recently we finally gotten a chance to come in the afternoon and it was crazy busy.. they seated us quickly because there was only a few seats available. We ordered dumplings and they were by far the best dumplings I ever tried! They put jalapeno on the side for us and you can put in your sauce or with your dumpling.. it was delicious!   My friend and I had Tonkotsu ramen bowl. It does feel you up because of the big portion, but flavor wise I think the pork broth wasn't strong enough. The 2/3 peices of pork belly threw me off. Tonkatsu usually has a big chunk of marinated porks. The noodles was alright as well. I thought putting in spicy spices would help but it made it more salty and just more oily. So I wasn't impressed with the ramen.  This is just my preference but the art on the bathrooms are of anime characters.. the colors are really vibrant. The style of the painting has exciting brush strokes, so I don't believe they fit the image of how down to earth Futo Buta is. When I walked into the bathroom I was thinking to myself \"What is going on?\" Pink and purple octopus with anime character who is drawn quite disfigurly and the minimalistic decor of the restaurant just doesn't clash together so well. Now, this is my preference and I know that other people don't have to agree. I'm just one of the few people who enjoy the art is restaurants. I support restaurants who gives artists a chance to showcase their work.   Service wise, our waitress was nice and very patient. She checked on us even when we saw that she was busy. The only thing was that when we got our checks we waiting for her for quite some time to collect it. So we actually had to go up towards the bar and someone had to notify for her that we were waiting to go.   My conclusion: that I wouldn't mind trying other various things off their menu next time. Defiantly will be getting their dumpings! I'm hoping that ramen was just an off day for them, but when it comes to seating.. it has very very limited space. It was crowded and when I had to get out and put on my jacket and purse on I think I was almost hitting the nice stranger next to me. Maybe I'll wait until the spring/summer time and patio is open to try again. Who knows?   Thank you for feeding me!"}
{"text":"This place is seriously one of the best ramen places in Charlotte (which we there are not a lot of them). If you didnt know already, there are different types of ramen and they also vary in style depending on region. But one of my favorites is the Tonkatsu Ramen. I had this here and have seriously been craving it ever since. It might not be the most authentic ramen place but from my experience having a lot of authentic ramen in Japan or here, I would say it is pretty close. Good Japanese ramen is supposed to be a little salty and they do a good job on the broth. Very flavorful and rich. Chasu or pork belly has got some smokey flavor which my husband loved. It was a perfect mix of fat and meat so it was awesome.The noodles were also not too soft or hard. I wish they had Takoyaki balls as their appetizer. We love them!   Price point was good.  Service is always understanding and attentive. This place is small and if you come at a time when there is a lot of people you would have wait a while for a table but I assure you that the wait would be worth it as after eating a bowl of their ramen you stomach will be satisfy. Food came out quite quick for us as we came at the perfect timing between rushes.  I don't think I can say anything that hasn't already been said about this place. Seating is very limited, but it's certainly worth the wait."}
{"text":"I'm going to keep this simple...this place is awesome. Tough to find on GPS? Sure. Just park near the Crispy Crepe on South Blvd and walk down the sidewalk. You're there. Getting lost the first time was well worth it, as it I came back two more times in the same week."}
{"text":"Overall I had a great experience at Futo Buta. Although there is technically only one vegetarian dish on the menu, the staff was extremely accommodating of my request to modify a non-vegetarian menu item. My ramen bowl was flavorful, comforting, and carbalicious. I do wish they had tofu or some other vegetarian protein. We also got the eggplant buns, which were tasty, but seemed very overpriced. They are definitely an appetizer portion. The strawberry basil ice cream was phenomenal. While the restaurant has a large patio, space inside is definitely limited."}
{"text":"LONG LINE!! Its a small place, and it must be good if there's a long line right? I guess so! I was traveling alone and thought that a big bowl of ramen would be a great end to my work week (should I have just went with BBQ? I am in NC for god's sake). Anyway, I asked the host how long the wait was, and she said 10-15 minutes. I thought, \"No way in hell will I be seated in 10-15 minutes\", but then again, I was by myself, so figured there was a random seat that was going to open at the bar or something. So I agreed to wait. 50 minutes later my name was called! Seriously? Half my fault for believing her, but half her fault for telling me 10-15 minutes. So... I finally got my seat at the end of bar, ordered Brussel Sprouts and the Traditional Ramen. Sprouts were drenched in soy-like sauce, in a good way; they were delicious. Ramen came out pipping hot, with all the goodness of Ramen. It was a rich broth, so depending on what you like, Miso broth would be a lighter option. It's a small space, and due to the masses of people surrounding you, you do feel a little rushed. Food comes out very quickly, like they are just waiting for you to leave. But, service was good - friendly and attentive. Overall, the food was great. Would I wait 50 minutes, by myself, for this Ramen again, NO. But would I order take out, or come when its not so busy (not sure when that is), sure. Worth a stop if you want to wait, and or have a companion to chat with."}
{"text":"I went here Friday night and it was busy, but there was no wait. The outdoor seating looked very nice but we chose to sit inside as it was hot out. the bathroom was very clean, though it was a single stall and always seemed occupied.   We ordered the Japanese fried chicken as our appetizer and it came almost immediately! Once we finished that the food came and it was amazing. We ordered the Fire & Ice, Tonkotsu, and the Little Noodle ramen. If you're used to maruchan brand packaged ramen, the Little Noodle ramen is the closest to that but much better. The food was warm but not too hot and full of flavor.   They only have chopsticks and napkins provided on the table, but our waitress asked if we needed forks almost immediately after we got our food.   The restaurant was very nice with the wood on the walls and tables and light open area, making it feel very modern. There are handy hooks beneath the tables to hang purses or bags that came in good use. I loved their method of serving water. You are given a cup and two larger glass bottles of water, first filled by your waitress. When you finish your water you can pour the rest yourself, which comes in handy for an avid water drinker.   The service was good, with our waitress taking her time to go over the menu options, giving personal suggestions along with it.   The only downfalls to this restaurant is the inconvenient location (by car). It is right outside of the Bland cats stop I believe but it is a considerable walking distance from the nearest parking. The location was also very hard to locate on a map. The address says it is on 222 E. Bland Street, but there are multiple restaurants on this address. We had to go to a tavern by the same address to get directions. Futo Buta is on the opposite corner of this location.   Overall I had a very good experience at this establishment, but had trouble getting there."}
{"text":"Without noodles, we'd have darkness and no carbs...oh and did I mention DARKNESS?!  Futo Buta makes HOMEMADE ramen noodles. I mean, can someone just send me noods so I can be in the comfort of my home already? Ubereats, I am looking at you.   My fiance and I came here for a date night because Ramen is the perfect way to enjoy a romantic rainy day. After reading reviews and putting my Yelpyness to work, I noted the lack of reservations and the size of the establishment, but that didn't stop us.   Arriving at 4pm on a Saturday, I thought would put us in the power position. WRONG. We got in line and put our names on the list and 30 minutes later we were seated at the communal table in between another couple who was on a date night and a group of three who had the most interesting conversations. (definitely, a girlfriend meeting her new boyfriend's best friend for the first time.)  Upon sitting down, we hardly looked at the menu because we are pros and looked ahead of time. With fired sticky rice, Fire and Ice with an egg and the traditional Miso ramen ordered we were off to the races. Our waitress didn't miss a beat and was super helpful the few times we had questions. With the size of this restaurant, I was excepting to feel on top of the people next to us, but I didn't.   The moment of truth... When our food arrived, I am positive that David leaned over and whipped the drool off my face. I've been seen a more beautiful display of ramen in my life. What are we waiting for -- let's dig in!   Fire and Ice was a huge hit. You can tell the noods are hand rolled and have that extra bit of love in them. Adding an egg is a pro tip. Do it, you can thank me later.  Fried Sticky Rice nom nom nom. When this plate came out, the couple next to us asked what we ordered and told us they were experiencing food envy. After taking a bite, damn right they were because those rice squares are something to talk about.   I can't wait to go back to Futo Buta! If you haven't been yet, make it a point to come here. Expect to wait, but it's worth it!"}
{"text":"Fire and Ice is excellent. I asked for spices and the friendly and informative server brought crushed chili pepper, hot oil, and saracha. I put just a pinch of chili pepper and a added a few dashes of the hot oil. Love that you can spice it to taste and the ingredients were all fresh! I'll be back!  A lot :)"}
{"text":"Not being a Ramen lover I can say I didn't try the ramen on my first visit, but will definitely go back to give it a try. Having read several reviews before arriving, I decided to order the Crispy Rice Squares with Tuna and the Fried Chicken.  By far the Crispy Rice will bring me back.  Rice squares cooked just right to give them a crisp outer crust.  Top them with tuna tartar and dip in soy sauce, heaven.  I cannot describe how good they were. As for the chicken, when you think of the word fried, these should be what you think of. They are fried to perfection, not greasy, but I missed the chicken flavor, as it was very subtle. They are served with an aioli which was great, but even the soy did the trick. Overall, Futo Buta is a definite spot Charlotte needs and I will look forward to getting back and trying their ramen, as well as ordering the Crispy Rice Squares again!"}
{"text":"The ramen broth is very rich and flavorful. There are other soups all of which have a unique and savory flavor. The fried chicken appetizer is very good with a spicy mayo sauce. The outdoor dining area is very neat, right next to the Lynx line with a great view of downtown. I would give five stars except they play the crappiest music at loud volume inside to the point that I will not eat there if outside seating is not available. The music is mid '70's obscuro rock that sounds like it was picked out by a 60 year old guy who still has a reel to reel and Bose 901 speakers. Perhaps some more modern music that is a little more laid back would be more suitable for a chill place like this."}
{"text":"It's good.  Really good.  Reminds me of Ippudo in Hell's Kitchen (NYC)."}
{"text":"Saw an article posted on The CLT Observer the other week and went to try it.  It taste almost like the ramen noodle place I've been to in Hong Kong.  Lot's of good flavor in the soup and tasty stuff in it."}
{"text":"The ramen noodles are to die for and it is family friendly and the service is very good. I would suggest the edamame to start because to me it's a delicious and light snack. For your main dish you should go for some ramen it's very filling and you can add however many topping you would like. If you are planning to go for dinner I would suggest getting there a little early because it gets packed very quickly."}
{"text":"Living in charlotte but from San Francisco this is one of the best restaurants Ive ate at here in charlotte!  I love soporo and saki. I also love sashimi and wagu for starters. The chizu ramen is to die for. Keep up the good work, love this place!"}
{"text":"A friend shared a meal with me. Fire & Ice Ramen(kimchi and dashi broth, hot smoked salmon, fresh mint, bok choy, shaved carrot, radish, black sesame, scallion, leek), Duck Confit & Pickled Carrots Buns(sancho, honey, five spice, leek, arugula), and Shishito Peppers (lightly fried, sesame, garlic, soy)."}
{"text":"Futo Buta is a tiny little ramen place. I wouldn't come with a big party.   The fried chicken appetizer is soooo good. I would not skip on this! Perfectly fried and still juicy inside. The sauce with it worked well with it too.  I got the Tonkatsu bowl, since it is a popular dish. I wish I got a spicier level. I wanted to be conservative with the spice, but more spice would have added more flavor to the bowl. The meat was really great and good quality. I'm not a huge pork fan, but still enjoyed this pork.   The portions were so huge we didn't have room for desert:( Will be back for the soft serve!"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere but the ramen is very salty. The appetizer was good l. But it was a bit much for salty food"}
{"text":"1st visit on Saturday with a group of friends. Get here early or prepare to wait. Luckily we were there at 11:30 and we had no problem getting a table right away.  The menu is simple. Ramen items range from $12-14. Appetizers from $4-12. I ordered the gyoza ($7) and the Shoyu ramen ($12), $20 for a lunch can be a little steep.  I liked the gyoza, 5 to an order and they are smaller in size. Nice golden crust, the dumpling wrap was of good thickness (not too doughy). Tasty.  My ramen, as mentioned before as well, was more noodles than soup. I was able to finish the whole thing in 1 seating (I contemplated half way through to pack it up... but who was I kidding). The pork meat was good, very tender, 3 small pieces. The soup was a little TOO salty, a little overpowering. Next time I'll try the other flavor.  I think what knocked the experience down a little was the choatic service. I understand they are still new, and having unexpected issue (broken tap machine) was forgivable, but forgetting to bring a glass for canned beer (and after being asked for one), delivering food to the wrong person (as in the person who arrived last should not have received food 1st), and other service related mishaps should have been avoided.  I hope it's just a matter of growing pain - but they need to grow fast to catch up on the popular demand or service will continue to suffer.   Food 4 Value 3.5 Service 2.5"}
{"text":"Just left this place with my food to go. Services is terrible. I work 5 minutes down South. Got there at 12:05 and still hand not placed my order after sitting at our table for 20 minutes. Then we waited and waited on our food until we had to ask for it to go. Then we couldn't find our waitress and had to walk inside to get our food that still wasn't ready. Walked out at 1:05 still not having eaten. Waitress was no where to be found. Don't go here if you expect fast, pleasant service. Also we weren't even offered an app or a drink for inconvenience. Just all around bad experience. Never going back."}
{"text":"Charlotte was long over due for a ramen place. A friend of mine saw this gem while riding on the LYNX and knew it would be right up my ally. We went with a group of seven and pretty much rotated the dishes around the table. Highlights for me were obviously the Miso (Hungry) ramen bowl, pan fried dumplings and rice crispy squares. By the end of the meal, we were all beyond stuffed! In fact, one of us literally went into a food coma at the table...true story! We finished the meal with the strawberry basil soft serve which can only be described best by my husband as \"happiness in a cup.\"  The only con I can give about this place, is that it is in much need of a wheel chair access point. We noticed a lady in a wheel chair trying to get into the restaurant but was unsuccessful without assistance."}
{"text":"I was not a huge fan of this place. The appetizers were really good....we got crispy rice squares, edamame and a sushi roll. Drinks were also good and the sake was actually tasty! The service was also excellent. However, I was not impressed with the actual Ramen bowls. They were overpriced, in my opinion, and were not good. Lacked flavor besides the overwhelming ginger and the pork was extremely fatty. This is not on my list of top eats in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Really not happy after my most recent visit to Futo Buta. I usually LOVE this place, and order from there at least once a week. Recently, however, I've been disappointed with both the quality and the value. Today I ordered my usual: rice crispy squares and Tonkatsu with extra pork belly. The extra pork belly is $5 extra. Well, today I got ramen that had no onsen egg, and ONE EXTRA PIECE OF PORK. ONE. FOR FIVE DOLLARS. Wtf?!?! If I'm spending $19 total on a bowl of ramen, I expect that 1.) all the freaking ingredients are going to be there and 2.) I get the extras that I pay for. The tonkatsu usually comes with 3 pieces of pork, and for five bucks I literally got 1 extra piece. Not to mention, the noodles were soggy and literally disintegrating off my chopsticks, the rice crispy squares were just falling apart, and I got half the amount of tuna for the squares. There was enough tuna for 3  squares of rice. That's it.   Extremely disappointed."}
{"text":"Everything was perfect. It was a little tricky to locate but if you park in the garage and walk toward the rail you'll eventually find this place. It's definitely small and trendy but on a Friday evening around 9pm it was only a 10-15 min wait. The staff were super friendly, atmosphere was great. The flavors were out of sight. In my opinion, eating out is about enjoying foods you can't duplicate at home and this took the trophy. From the super flavorful miso tofu skewers, to the roasted eggplant buns (amazing!), to the vegan ramen, I can't decide which was my favorite. We aren't big sake drinkers but our waitress/bartender made some recommendations and let us try a few samples and they were great. I'll definitely be back next time I'm in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. I love how the walls and the decor were so modern and photogenic. The ramen was different. Wasn't as I expected but I still give them a five star because of the appetizers. Bomb!"}
{"text":"One of my very favorite places. The ramen is incredible. The issue is the space, so use some deodorant before you go and be prepared to wait for a while. The food is worth it, but it's a tight squeeze with shared tables and you will get to know your neighbors well. I've tried most of the apps on the menu and love the rice crispy squares and the Japanese fried chicken. I always end up with the Chizu bowl but I add the pork chili. It kicks it up a notch. Delicious. Recently, my husband and I ordered take out and it traveled well...just a thought if you don't want to wait for a table!"}
{"text":"This lovely place is a little hard to locate for just about everyone who dines here for the first time. They are located near Common Market or The Trolley museum by the light rail. More than likely your phone will be useless as they share the building with other tenants and have been trying to get a separate address to help people find it quicker. Street parking is free on the weekends, lots of parking available. Now onto the food, the Rice Krispy Squares are very crispy and great to pile on the raw tuna. The ramen we tried had pecan smoked pork belly with pickled ginger and assorted mushrooms with large egg to add creaminess to the dish. Everything we had was great including the servers and waitress that helped explain some of the menu items and customizing the certain dishes to our needs. So don't stress out about finding this gem it took us out of owners maybe five minutes to get there. Great spot !"}
{"text":"Blah. Oily broth with no taste.  I had to keep adding sesame chili oil to my ramen in the hope of adding flavor. Still didn't help. Very mediocre. Server was pleasant, though. Loud rock music playing to give it a hip atmosphere. Is very convenient to the blue line. You can almost touch the trains."}
{"text":"I came by myself during lunch so it should have been a quick visit, but service was not great. It took a while to get anyone's attention to ask about seating and then I was placed in the corner of the bar, looking at the wall. I ordered the duck buns and the miso ramen. The buns came first and then I waited a while for the ramen, and again to get the check. The food was good, but not great. I'd keep searching for ramen elsewhere.   Food details: The buns were good - they tasted homemade since the texture wasn't as fine and smooth as the premade kind. The duck on them was tender and flavorful. As for the ramen, the miso broth was a bit modern in take and heavy on the pork flavor rather than a mix of chicken and pork. The broth was okay but the noodles really reminded me of top ramen since they were a bit too soft and the broth was on the fattier side from the pork. I didn't like the broth or the noodles so much but the toppings were very good. The chashu pork was fatty but done well so that the fat just melted in my mouth; corn was crip and sweet; and the egg was a great soft-medium boil."}
{"text":"After a bit of searching, I did find Futo Buta. It is at the south end of the light rail station, on the side closest to South Blvd. Inside, a nice lay out with high top and low top tables. Most of the seating is stools that have no backs. This is nice for 15 or 20 minutes but after a half hour, it's going to be uncomfortable. On a nice day, the outside chairs might be more comfy.  On to the main event, the ramen. I went right to the top of the menu, the Tonkotsu. A ton of different individual flavors and textures in this large bowl of pork broth and of course, a big serving of ramen noodles underneath the surface. Very tasty, a little messy, well worth it.  While they do have a good selection of beers and several other drinks in the cooler, water is a good idea for all the sodium you'll be enjoying.  You will want to wear something in a dark solid color or with lots of colors on it. This stuff does splash.  Parking. Well, I found a metered spot on the street. But there is also a parking deck with a few free hours next door too. Oops."}
{"text":"Why have I never been here before?!? It has been on my list just never made but I'm so glad I did tonight. It seemed to be a long wait but since I just needed a table for one there was a spot at the bar opened and I got seated right away. Everyone else that I seen waiting was seated pretty quickly as well. It's very small yet cozy inside and they have seating outside with an awesome view of the city. I started by ordering the Tokyo Mule, that I would totally recommend to any Moscow Mule lover. Then the couple next to me asked was it my first time here and suggested I order the Rice crispy squares and my other neighbor suggested the Brussels sprouts. I went with the rice crispy squares tonight (Brussel sprouts next visit) because you can't go wrong with fried sticky rice and spicy tuna and I was right because it was awesome! But it's definitely not an app for one if you plan on eating ramen after because I was pretty full but I came for ramen so I got ramen. I choose the Fire & Ice since I love smoked salmon and it was sooo good. I have no complaints about this place the food was great, the service was great, the people around me were great.. it was a perfect date night for myself!"}
{"text":"Inside can get a little noisy and seating is a bit squished. We try to go during the warmer months so we can eat outside and hear each other.  The food definitely makes up for the ambiance. I highly recommend the miso (hungry) and fried brussel spouts."}
{"text":"My husband and I were really interested in trying this place, as a friend lives right above it (lucky!) We sat outside on a really lovely day and started our order with the sake sampler. It was great because each sake had a description card and fun fact about it. We also started with the dumplings, which I could've ate a bucket of.  We ordered the Tonkatsu and Miso Hungry. It was very good Ramen,with a lot of flavor! They said the broth is cooked for a long time which helps make it a thicker more flavorful broth. I will definitely be back as there are so many things on the menu I want to try!  Love Love Love...at first Bite."}
{"text":"Great ramen! Silky flavorful broth and springy noodles, divine egg. The sushi was beautiful but not quite worth the cost when compared with the quality and affordability of the ramen bowls."}
{"text":"This place is great!! I can't wait to return. My and my fiance sat at the bar and the bartender/waitress Caitlen was awesome! We tried the Duck Confit rice bowl off the \"Fresh\" menu and I had the Fire & Ice ramen. Both were fantastic, and we ate everything! We can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Recommended by a work colleague, attended together. A little tricky to find by street address alone but located right on train track across and down from Taco, near parking garage and across from the media school. It was a Tuesday night and the place was packed, with a wait. It is a small place (hope you like cozy) with a combination of long tall table seating, short shelf against the wall, bar and traditional sit down. I can only imagine the wait on the weekends. We started off with some small plates, hands down the KUROBUTA PORK AND GOLDEN SCALLOP GYOZA did not linger long. Could have easily put another plate away, def recommend. The TORI KARA AGE (JAPANESE FRIED CHICKEN) I thought was OK. I would pass next time, but then again not a big fried fan. The LOW COUNTRY SMOKED PORK BELLY bun was again decent. We also tried one of the featured sushi rolls and some salmon tartare, both were decent. The FIRE N ICE Ramen - kimchi broth, hot smoked salmon, fresh mint, cabbage, shaved carrot, radish, black sesame, was every bit of wonderful and I do recommend. We ended the meal with some flavored soft serve they feature, which was a very appropriate ending after all the spices and flavors we encountered. The bar features sake, wine, and beer. Spices offered on the side to use at your own discretion include soy sauce, sesame oil, and Sriracha sauce. The crowd mostly was comprised of young professionals."}
{"text":"4.5 stars. I have to say before writing my review..that fire and ice is da bomb. I docked half a star partly for the parking situation. We came in today after the soft opening this last Saturday.   Futo Buta is located in the back of the South End Apartments literally right next to the light rail, boy...did we have a hard time figuring out where this place was..but it was worth it. We walked in around 5:40 since we saw all the great reviews for ramen (and we have been dying to find a good ramen place), there was no one there score! But the chef changed out the water for ramen which we were told would take a little more time than the norm, reverse score! We waited patiently for our Miso and Fire & Ice ramen bowels which came out around 6:15.. we weren't very amused with the wait but the server made up for it with a free ginger peach ice cream, so no hard feelings. The only complaint I have about the miso ramen was that it needed a little more salt in the broth..the fire and ice ramen was PERFECT. It was the right amount of savory and who thought salmon could work in ramen bowels... they earned the award for most creative today! I finished everything...I wish I didn't leave my phone in the car....I wanted to take pictures.. great presentation.   Suggestions for the Full Menu: need more chicken based ramen and a chicken bun..not everyone eats red meat.   Needless to say we will be back! Finally found good ramen in the Charlotte (possible North Carolina) area, my 3 month search since I moved has finally come to an end. Keep it up Futo Buta!"}
{"text":"Great ramen! I've been 4 times now and always try something new and never leave unhappy. The specials are always good too! It's a communal set up so expect to be friendly with others!"}
{"text":"Incredible place for ramen. I've gotten the Miso Hungry both times and it doesn't disappoint. I felt full after just the ramen bowl, but the appetizers are all great.  This place can be difficult to find. It is right next to the light rail stop at Post Southend."}
{"text":"Whoa! I've had this placed bookmarked for a long time, and I've never made the trip down here. First off, as other reviews say, it's very confusing to find. I like Andi M's description of how to find it, so I won't just copy/paste it here.  If you can find the place, you won't be disappointed. I ordered the tonkatsu ramen, and the fiance ordered the miso ramen.  The noodles were great, the broth was wonderful, the add-ins were delicious. The standout: THE PORK. It has so much flavor and was tender, but not too tender. Oh, I will dream about the pork until next time.   We sat outside where they have wonderful seating areas with fire stands or umbrellas (depending on your day). Our server was attentive and friendly. Not too much else to say here people, just go!"}
{"text":"I came here Sunday with a couple of my girlfriends as we have been craving ramen for a few days. We were impressed. Upon arriving at this hidden gem across from the light rail tracks we were seated outside with lights strewn across the patio. It was their \"soft opening\" so we were told some items were not available at the time and that they were working on the full menu.   We started out with the Kurobuta Pork and Golden Scallop Gyoza-these were great. Perfectly fried and it came with a side of the dipping sauce. We ordered the low country smoked pork belly and those were so tasty as well. I wish they had more than two to an order! Steamed buns are my favorite! Then we each got a ramen bowl, we had the Miso Hungry with the house signature spicy ground pork and the Shoyu Good Enough. The Miso ramen was a bit on the spicy side for me, but it had so much flavor. The Miso was a little on the salty side, but it is made with a soy based broth. Overall the ramen bowls were fantastic. The serving size was big, but filling.  I can't wait until they have their full menu so I can try out the others!"}
{"text":"This place was just ok for me. Not sure I'd go out of my way to dine here. Maybe my anticipation to dine here along with the hype about this place set the bar too high. I don't know.  To start we had the pork belly bao. The flavors we're very good but I have this \"thing\" about stinginess in my food. Especially when I'm paying a pretty penny for it. The buns each had 1 thin sliver of overcooked pork belly. Yes, it was chewy like shredded beef.  Why?  At $10 I expect a decent slice of pork belly. I'm not asking for a monster chunk. But more than a sliver, please.  I was left wanting.... On to the ramen. I had the Fire and Ice. Salmon was tasty. Well cooked. Broth was good. Flavorful enough. I added spicy sauce. Raw veggies were scarce. More like decoration. Noodles were, well, noodles. They were good. Well cooked. But nothing to write home about. Hubby had the Shoyu bowl. His was slightly heartier.  The portions were not very large in comparison to, for example, local pho restaurants. The prices were, once again, hefty for the portions.   I just don't know. I wasn't wowed by Futo. And I'm so sad I wasn't. I'm not sure why everyone is talking up this place so much."}
{"text":"The best ramen restaurant in town. I love the appetizers Brussels sprouts and pork buns as well, besides the tasty and creamy flavor of tonkotsu ramen. Shoyu is another good option if you prefer the soup to be less creamy."}
{"text":"Excellent Ramen spot with a cool vibe, and friendly service. They have good local beers on tap and a ton of sake options, if that's your thing. Food overall is great, but it's a little on the pricey side for a casual lunch spot."}
{"text":"Just finished eating here tonight! This was my second time and I think it's pretty darn good. I've been waiting for a ramen place to open in Charlotte (even thinking about opening my own, I was so desperate). The seating inside is limited but they also have an outdoor patio. The first time I came we had the peppers for an appetizer and I had the Fire and Ice as my entree. It wasn't bad, but tonight was better. I decided to go with the Miso. Once your break the egg yolk and mix it around with everything, it takes it up a notch. I added the spicy ground pork which I highly suggest. We finished off our meal tonight with their soft serve - tonight's was sweet corn. Don't be put off by the name like I was at first. It is so creamy and satisfies your sweet tooth just enough. The other soft serve option tonight was Fruity Pebbles so I'll definitely be back to try that because, come on... it's Fruity Pebbles. Side note: the service was excellent and the art on the bathroom doors won me over."}
{"text":"The sign of a good bowl of ramen is an empty bowl of ramen. My miso ramen bowl tonight .... was half empty. Thank goodness for the pork belly steam buns. The broth was too salty and the ramen undercooked. Ambiance was lovely and I eyed some great sake so I'll be back for another try. Desperately seeking good Asian food in the city."}
{"text":"I wouldn't love charlotte as much as I do if it weren't for this place. The ambiance, the food, the changing menu, the alcohol selections. In my book, Futa Buta is a 10/10"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times. There is always a wait and parking is not great (normal in south end area). The dish I kept going back to is the rice-cracker appetizer, very tasty! I have also enjoyed their house-made soft serves. I have had a few ramen from their menu, and they were just soso. The first time I went the noodles were way too soft. The second and third time, the broth was very salty. They were not horrible, just not that great."}
{"text":"Love this place. It's been a while since a unique restaurant bringing complex flavors and sexy textures has come to Charlotte. Tired of having PHo all the time now I get my ramen fix weekly lol."}
{"text":"Delicious food and a great twist on ramen which I'd never had like this before. Their desserts are the best after dinner treat. The flavors are super unique and rich."}
{"text":"Here in Charlotte for a work training and wanted to try something new. The food was amazing. Coming from Miami I wasn't sure what to expect but I was pleasantly surprised by the high quality and creativity of the food.  Our server Janielle was the cherry on top. Knowledgeable, attentive, and very on top of everything.  A wonderful experience"}
{"text":"I've been to Futo Buta on multiple occasions during lunch. This past time was my first visit during dinner. Previously the restaurant was not that busy and I had no problems being seated. This time the small space was packed. One of the servers quoted our wait as 30-35 minutes. We were finally seated after about an hour. Very annoying.  They seemed to tell all their patrons that arrived that night the same time, so I honestly wonder if they just tell everyone that so they'll wait :-/  Regardless we were seated at the bar. Our server was awesome: just the right amount of attentiveness, great sense of humor, and very helpful. We started off with the toro nigiri appetizer. Incredible flavor; honestly doesn't even need any soy sauce!   Girlfriend ordered the tonkotsu ramen.  I love how savory it is and also a fan of the wood ear mushrooms they put in the bowl. I normally get the tonkotsu, so I decided to venture out and try the Shoyu ramen. I prefer the tonkotsu. Both bowls feature their pecan-smoked pork belly, which I absolutely adore. The pieces practically melt in your mouth. Unfortunately the broth in my ramen was too salty. From now on, I'll most likely just stick with the tonkotsu.   For dessert we had the green tea ice cream with honey drizzled on top. I'm not normally a big tea person but this was also amazing. The addition of honey really takes it to another level.   I love the ramen they serve here. I'm looking forward to future visits and trying their other appetizers (their brussel sprouts are also very good).  I just wish they would utilize their porch more or somehow find a way to expand their dining area. When it's full it's just way too crowded and very loud. Despite these problems, I still think Futo Buta is worthy of 5 stars."}
{"text":"The best Ramen that I've ever had!  These guys really value their customers and their experience while you're there.  Even the water that they give you is filtered and tastes awesome!"}
{"text":"New favorite! Came for the first time on Wednesday, then went back again on Friday, it was that awesome.   Food- Amazing, well priced, solid serving size. You can tell they bring it out right after its prepared, and there's no real lag time. Crispy rice squares with spicy tuna is my favorite dish so far. Husband loves the fried chicken. Tried the chisu ramen (vegetarian) and shoyu ramen, dishes were very different but both were awesome!   Service- Very solid. I didn't ask a lot of questions to be honest, but both times the servers were very nice but more importantly they were quick and attentive, which goes a long way in Charlotte."}
{"text":"The Ramen here is beyond delicious! Very savory and make sure to get the spicy sauce the chef makes. Great find!"}
{"text":"Let me start this review with some honesty; I have never had Ramen before. It has been on my bucket list to try for many years, but just have never been able to convince my restaurant going friends to resist going back to our favorite places. Alas, thus why it has taken so long for me to have this delicious creation.  The location is gorgeous, with string lights surrounding the outdoor patio and and easily accessible light rail stop literally feet away. The inside is spacious and a classy, more modern vibe, so really, you're set either way. I was by myself waiting for a friend, so I took a seat at the bar.  The staff were all friendly and willing to answer questions. The nice bartender walked me through all the nuances of sake and allowed me to sample a few different kinds, before committing to none because I ended up being too full from my ramen. Another day.   Now to the main focus: the ramen. I was between trying many different types for this first experience, but the limited availability of the seasonal option drew me in. I ended up going for it, without much hesitation: butternut squash miso ramen with bok choy and mushroom and just wait for it: barbecued cauliflower. Honestly, it blew me away. Every bite was surprisingly well balanced, with an incredible amount of creaminess for just vegetables. The noodles were perfectly cooked and plentiful and I was smiling the whole time. The real kicker, though, was the incredible barbecued cauliflower. The sweet smokiness was exactly what was needed to round out the dish. My only complaint was there definitely wasn't enough of the cauliflower, maybe only two or three pieces. Although I went home with leftovers, I didn't go home with any of the best part of the dish and that was a small disappointment.  Overall, I loved my experience here. I thought the food was exceptional and high quality, even offering more unique options than the traditional. I also thought the aesthetics of the location were lovely and the staff was as well! Will absolutely be coming back and will absolutely be heartbroken that the seasonal ramen is not a menu staple."}
{"text":"Happy!, what makes you happy?. I have to say every time I come to this place I instantly get happy. Why?. Well the food is great and very authenticate. The have taken the time to find out the ingredients that work. And I made a rule not to judge the service but only the food, but in this place you will always get both in a quality like no other. Now, is a small place and it can get crowded and it will as more people find out how great this place is.  The food, I have tried all appetizers, theirs buns and just a few of the ramen. In the few months they been open I have made this place my once a week visit. And I usually order the pork belly buns and brussels sprouts and my favorite Tonkotsu ramen. When I am done, I leave this place with a huge smile. The one bad thing I can say about this place is that is just a small location, but other than that you WILL DEFINITIVELY enjoy their food."}
{"text":"Great place for Ramen in Southend...I have a seafood allergy and knowing how Ramen is prepared I called ahead to see if all their Ramen was prepared with any type of fish or fish oil....they took the time over the phone to research the menu to tell me exactly what I can order when I get there. And they also informed me that they can omit any thing from any of the dishes on the menu at my request. Once there our order was taken promptly and the food cake out quickly and did not disappoint. Top notch service and great food, you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Phenominal Japanese ramen establishment.  Had a good friend take us to this place while we were in town to spark memories of old times in OKINAWA and was pleasantly surprised.    Ramen was fantastic flavor wise and noodle texture was perfection.    I requested really spicy and they had informed me that the Buta bowl was already spicy but, brought three ingredients for me to sprinkle for a little more kick.  Feeling adventurous and unsure of if an appetizer?  Try the \"Brussel sprouts\" with an open mind and see if you talk about it,...it's bomb!  Our waitress Brittain was dope and accommodating and apparently lived in Tokyo too.     Overall place is a must try for authentic ramen."}
{"text":"... Stopped in after reading reviews on Yelp.  I was immediately greeted as I walked in the door (always a good thingin my opinion). I loved the decor and the  staff was great. Perry, the Bartender was really friendly and helped guide me during my first visit.  He made suggestions and all were tasty.  My favorite was the Albacore Tuna, which was on the Fresh Sheet (don't miss out on that - they change it daily!). I also had the pork bun sliders (a little sweet for my taste, but good)  and the ShoYu (light miso broth, which is great for a hot summer afternoon)... I liked everything about this place- which is awesome for Newbie...  I will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Nothing really special about this ramen but the appetizers were pretty good. The setting of the restaurant was more enjoyable."}
{"text":"The first time and only time I've experienced this food was as take out. Clearly that wasn't the best idea, but I can't imagine eating inside would have salvaged an ounce of what my boyfriend and I had. We both ordered vegetarian ramen. The amount and salt and oil completely ruined the taste and flavor. After a few bites, and then a few more, we threw them away."}
{"text":"I've been reading about Futo Buta on Yelp and had it on my short list of places to visit. Am I glad I did! The place is sort of small, but we had no trouble getting in. Our waitress was super nice and helped us decide what to order, since we had never been there before. We ordered Brussel Sprouts as a starter. They were excellent. Then we had some bowl of Ramen noodles, which was also incredibly tasty. My wife and I shared it, since we didn't want to overeat. It was plenty for us to share, though we are light eaters. Then we had one of their homemade ice cream's for desert. Our waitress recommended a Sake flight. Since I'm a Sake novice, that we're out perfectly. I was pretty impressed with it. Definitely a place that is worth a visit and has a decently cool vibe to it."}
{"text":"The ramen is good not great but then again I've had toto ramen. Being one of the only places to get ramen in Charlotte it's easy to rate it well. The apps outshine the ramen in my opinion. First time I went it was the best. Then the next couple of times I ordered the same thing (fire and ice) and ingredients were missing. Like the mint. Which is the reason for the ice part of the name. Ive stopped ordering fire and ice since then. The ice cream is probably the star of this restaurant."}
{"text":"Great vibe to this place. It is busy, busy. You will need to wait for a seat, but never that long. Appetizers are delicious, and so is the ramen. The broth can be a little salty but they're able to lighten it."}
{"text":"What a great place to eat after spending a few hours rock climbing for the first time. I was starving! I ate outside which has a really great area to relax. It's right on the LYNX blue line so there's a lot going on in the area. It's tough to find parking so it's best to scout the area before heading out. The front of the restaurant is facing the tracks so you won't be able to see it if you're trying to find it. You have to walk before you see it.  I suggest you go with multiple people and have everyone get something different so you can try everything. There are so many different things on the menu it was hard not ordering it all. I'm looking forward to visiting again."}
{"text":"I'm so jazzed this place is finally open.  It is offering a limited menu until its Grand Opening, but I could not contain myself any longer and went to check it out last night.  Worth the wait.  All spring I had been staring at the \"Ramen is coming May 2015\" sign on the door since I take the Lynx to work every morning.  Most of my instagram friends witnessed me taking photos of the progress of the patio outside... table and chairs being set out... the sign being placed atop the entrance.  Glad I went last night when things were not as crazy, but I'm sure they are going to get slammed this weekend.  Sat at the bar and took in the space.  The dining room has a modern feel - metal bar stools, but warm wood surfaces to balance everything.  The patio outside has some nice lighting and three big umbrellas to provide some shade.  Probably the best part about sitting at the bar is that you have a front row of all the action in the kitchen since there is a large hole in the wall where the orders are placed on the window and allows you to see just how hard the chefs and sous chefs are busting their butts to give you some tasty food.  I had the Miso (Hungry):  Sweet white corn, pecan smoked pork belly, scallion, bean sprout, cabbage, onsen egg, sesame with house made chili sauce (a must).  So delicious.  the pork belly was super good, and I had a fun time fishing out the corn (which you could tell were fresh from the cob by the way the rows stuck together).  The chili sauce takes it up a notch if you like spicy.  Will be interesting to see their full array of ramen and rolls once they \"fully\" open but judging by their limited menu now, I will probably be in here a lot.  Sitting at the bar, it was cool to talk to Adam and finding out more about how they got this place together.  It really has a nice neighborhood feel to it.  Nothing stuffy or pretentious... just casual... darn good ramen.  I loved how people would walk in from the South End neighborhood and see each other at the bar... great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Finally got to try Futo Buta for lunch with a some friends as its been on my bucket list ever since a few of my Yelp friends checked the place out.  The restaurant is on the first floor of the Post apartment complex and faces the inbound lane of the Lynx blue line right at the the Bland Street station.  Three hour complementary parking is available at the bottom level of the apartment complex.  The restaurant is tiny so it might be best to come on off hours to get a seat.  There a long bar, a long pub table and a few regular tables inside and that's it.  They do have a large patio that may actually have more seating than inside the restaurant.    Before you order from the menu, check out the fresh list on the wall in the main dining area for the daily specials. My friends ordered an appetizer off of that list that was absolutely amazing. I think it was tuna in a spicy sauce.  My order consisted of the fried brussels sprouts for an appetizer and the Fire and Ice entry.  The brussels sprouts were great but the tuna app was better!  Fire and Ice was just amazing. Ramen with smoked salmon and fresh veggies. It had a nice kick to it as well.  For dessert, they make their own ice cream and the flavor changes daily. Today's flavor was strawberry basil and it was quite tasty and very refreshing on a hot day.  I think this will become a regular lunch spot for me."}
{"text":"Location & atmosphere! The Brussels sprouts and the pork belly bowls are delish. Super tiny in there though so always a short wait."}
{"text":"I was impressed with the concept of the restaurant and really excited to try it out. The appetizers are better than the meals itself. The soup was pretty standard and a lot like something I would make myself. For the pricing, I wasn't incredibly impressed and wish it was more authentic. Servings are small. Restaurant is small. Wait times too long. Nothing to write home about and not at all what you would expect when the entire concept is centered around ramen... more of a hipster place or for someone who likes the more Americanized version.   Hard to find / not on bland. By light rail tracks on a corner."}
{"text":"Get the crispy rice squares with the tuna and the tonkotsu ramen. The dragon god sake is my absolute FAVORITE. Come early or expect a wait. You won't be disappointed with this one."}
{"text":"This place is wonderful, great service. The most delicious Ramen and all sorts of tasty bites to try. Come on your own or with a group of friends. It's the perfect place for winter comfort food."}
{"text":"All I can say is wow. Somebody knows what they are doing in this kitchen. But even before that, we had trouble finding parking so we called and one of the owners stayed on the phone and guided us in all the way to the front door. Talk about service!  Friendly, laid back but attentive staff. But the food...  take some traditional Asian and local ingredients, add some serious genius, a helping of creative inspiration, and a dash of extra love and you've got Futo Bota!  I would make the trip to Charlotte again just to come here. Simply amazing."}
{"text":"One of the best secrets Charlotte has to offer. I had heard about this place from friends for so long and always puzzled I had not encountered it while driving etc. When I did find it during a walking trip to another location I could not contain my enthusiasm. I ate outside in their nice quaint patio area next to the Lynx line. The ramen here is nothing short of fantastic and the restaurant possesses a nice varied menu that makes it certain I will be back again. The friendly wait staff sealed the deal. Seek this place out for one of the best meals you will have in Charlotte."}
{"text":"They have limited seating so you might have to sit in a bar seat pretty close to others. I do like that at the bars you can hang your jacket or purse on a little hook in front of you. Their ramen is always fresh and delicious! The miso is the most basic if it is your first ramen experience. Beware that the eggs are \"soft\" boiled. When you break them open the yolk will spill into your soup and kind of take over. I ask for mine to be cooked medium"}
{"text":"What a fantastic place!  Get the Japanese peppers as an appetizer.... They will not disappoint.  The atmosphere was great and everything we ordered was just beautiful,  and tasted amazing.  I can't wait to go again."}
{"text":"Trendy little place in South End, very close to the light rail.  It is a very tiny space for how busy it is, but they keep it very clean, which I appreciate!  We had our daughter with us, and it's not very kid-friendly, only because it is a bit cramped.  We sat inside, but there is a cute patio area outside.  We ordered the Rice Crispy Squares (interesting, but not sure I would order it again) as our appetizer.  I had the Fire & Ice ramen ($13) as my entree.  The presentation was beautiful, and overall the flavors were very good, except some bites were a bit salty; I'm not sure whether it was just a one-off occurrence or whether their flavor profile is on the saltier side.  My fiance had the Tonkotsu ramen ($14), which was also very good flavor-wise, but still slightly on the salty side for our tastes.  The portion sizes for the ramen were OK -- not a lot for the price, but enough to fill you for lunch.  The service was great, but expect to wait during peak lunch and dinner hours.  Waiting outside isn't too bad, though, if the weather is nice.  We waited about 30 mins on a Saturday around lunchtime, but just walked around the light rail tracks to kill time.  Will be back!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in Charlotte.I recommend the brussel sprouts and rice crispy squares to start. The pork and duck steamed buns are good as well - but I try not to get super full because the ramen portions are big. I get the Niwa (vegan) and I'm not even vegan. I just love the sesame/mushroom flavor.. and while the other ramen options are delicious, I keep going back to the Niwa.   My one and only criticism is that I wish they would beef up their beer/wine list.. The selection is limited. I also made the mistake of ordering Sake once and the (very small) bottle we got ended up costing ~$35."}
{"text":"So, So, So good!!!! This place just smells delicious!!! I tried the pork belly and duck confit buns (you can mix and match)...The duck bun was soo good! I also ordered the Miso hungry ramen bowl with spicy pork added in and it was really really good...I would definitely come again, the service was fast and friendly and I was able to eat outside in beautiful weather! I wish I had enough room for the ice cream maybe next time!"}
{"text":"Words can't summarize all of the goodness that overwhelms me when I think of this place.  Futo Buta is nestled along the light rail in the Southend are of Charlotte close to Bland Street by all of the bars like All-American Pub and Slate.  For a gourmet noodle house the eats are reasonably priced.  I almost always order the Tonkotsu which consists of creamy pork broth, pecan smoked pork belly, scallion, organic mushroom, onsen egg*, pickled ginger, seaweed, sesame, black garlic.  The ingredients are a courtesy of their website.  On a nice cool or warm summer night this is a great date spot.  There's outdoor seating so you can people watch and see the hustle and bustle of the light rail and the neighborhood people jogging or just enjoying the gorgeous days we have in Charlotte.  Check this place out because it is definitely now on you to-do list."}
{"text":"Tonkotsu ramen is fabulous! Best ramen I had in North Carolina. Noodles, soup, egg, pork... Everything was perfect! Daily specials are eye-openers. We had a white fish sashimi which was very fresh. For appetizer, rice crispy squares appeared on every table so we gave it a try. Worth it! Good combination of rice and tuna. Japanese fried chicken also taste good. I would like to try everything from Futo Buta!"}
