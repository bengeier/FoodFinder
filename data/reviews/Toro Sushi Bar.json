{"text":"The sushi is ordinary so-so. The service is the worst that I have had in an AYCE.  Slow, unavailable and inattentive."}
{"text":"I've been frequenting this place a little too often. Definitely the best ayce sushi in town! Only ayce with salmon tataki. Other must try's is their Toro roll, sweet shrimp, garlic shrimp, toro bomb, and ramen. Bonus is 10% with a fb check, make sure to ask before they print out the bill. It's rare I give out 5 stars but they definitely deserve it basing on quality price."}
{"text":"Horrible service, food is ok, arrives most of the time cold. The place itself is an igloo and I had to get up and turn on the two heaters because they were completely off...."}
{"text":"I currently rate this as the best AYCE sushi in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"En generale, la nourriture est bonne. J'ai aime le maki Toro:)  × Le wasabi manque de gout. Mauvaise service. Les serveurs n'ont pas l'air accueillants. L'employe qui repond au telephone faisait des erreurs dans ma reservation malgre j'ai appele 2 fois pour la confirmer. Je donnerai 4 etoiles pour la nourriture si le service n'etait pas mauvaise."}
{"text":"For the sushi is fairly okay however for the service is soso. We were waiting about 30 minutes for our second order and one of the waiter told us \"we have dropped your order into the sink so please re-order again.\" I was surprised it took 30 minutes for him to realize our order is still in the sink. What I can say... For the food is okay, but service I doubt... And I do suggest the management to install a sink detector to prevent orders dropping into."}
{"text":"Very, very nice decor. It's sad that it's hidden by the constructions on the street but the inside is very nicely decorated.  As for food, very fresh fish, overall very good. I've went many times and I didn't get deceived at all."}
{"text":"I had a very sweet waitress, but the staff messed up my bill and the food was not great. I would definitely not eat here again. There are plenty of good restaurants in the area. If you do go, here are some tips: -Be careful when you check your bill. They charged me $20 for pad thai and a salad, when it should have only been $15.  - Do not order the pad thai. It is very oily.  - The toro salad was not fresh, and was a strange mix of iceberg lettuce and packaged crab. Not recommended.  - The waitress with longer hair was rude, and would not listen to my issue with the bill. Try to request the younger waitress with the short hair if possible -- she's clearly trying hard to do her best in this crappy restaurant."}
{"text":"Came to eat their ayce dinner menu and honestly it's fantastic. They have a big selection of Asian fusion dishes so it's good for when you want many types of food like Korean rice cake skewers, seafood pajeon, pad Thai, or takoyaki beyond just sushi.   And with their sushi, it is by far the best and freshest tasting sushi I've had since coming to Montreal from Vancouver. I've been to other ayce sushi around St Catherine and this is better by far-presentation, portion, taste, and speed-wise.   We had their California roll, tempura roll, dragon roll, tamago, avocado sashimi, fried chicken, tteok kkochi, bbq squid, seafood pajeon and desserts and the thing is that they all taste on point. I can't remember everything we ordered but they all tasted great, if not very good.   For an ayce place it really is amazing and its great that it has so many options so you can bring a varied party.  Also their decor is really cute!!"}
{"text":"**the menu had a lot of variety but we only tried the sushi.**  the ingredients were not fresh, and the sauces did not taste good - too much mayo, in my opinion. we struggled to finish a single order, not because we were full or ordered too much.. but because of how unappetizing and inedible it all was!"}
{"text":"It's newly renovated. It used to be Kanda sushi but now it's a new name. I don't know if the management changed.  Food: generally good, sushi and maki are very good, however I don't really recommend the cuisine(hot plates), or the sashimi or the handrolls.   Service: they were all very helpful and polite. However, I have two notes: 1- every question I ask three different waiters, I get the same answer \"I'm sorry, I don't know, I'm new here. \" I got this answer three different times. First, when I asked how long they have been open for, then the other two I had a question about a certain plate. Second, we got a bit upset when we noticed that there was an issue with our order and some of what we ordered were mixed up and ended up with (endless) amount of sushi, we told three different waiters to stop bringing us plates as we didn't order for those. I guess these \"a volonté\" places have a lot of these issues, but personally I hate seeing food go to waste.   Atmosphere: very nice, clean, and well decorated. We were with our kids, and I can say that it is kids friendly. They don't give colouring books but it is good for families and people with kids.   General: not the best in town, but worth trying for a change."}
{"text":"Nothing special....decent food,service was good..but in the sushi bar...I saw the employee who making the sushi..,they talk too mush when they was working... Then we eat the saliva in the sushi...not too clean...."}
{"text":"The sushi was okay. But we waited for an extremely longg time to get our next dish... Though not a bad place to have a long chat with ur friends but definite not a suitable place if you are starving even it's \"all you can eat\"..."}
{"text":"If there is a zero start rating they must have one I have been waiting for food for more than 40 minutes finally arrived but one dish only Horrible service The worst experience in my life ever If u ask for advice then go to another sushi bar"}
{"text":"Interesting take on some popular sushis. The place is nice and cozy. We went on a Monday night and the place was empty. They still managed to make multiple mistakes in our orders and bring us the wrong items and drinks. If you are looking for specific sushis this may not be the place for you. But if you are looking to try a many things and don't mind the mistakes they why not."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I go to Toro at least once every three weeks or so.  The service is always very pleasant and the atmosphere is really good. Always play good music, you don't feel rushed to get out and the restaurant is very comfortable.  They bring the food at a pace that confirms the freshness of the orders.   The salmon sashimi is a little on the fatty side, and the chicken teriyaki isn't the greatest but their sushi pizza is to die for!   Honestly, I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has the worst servcie I have ever seen in a sushi all-you-can-eat restaurant. We were here for 2 hours and a half and we only got three orders. Also, dishes were left on the table without getting picked up. The restaurant wasn't even packed on a saturday NIGHT!? Every order took at least 30 minutes. Some orders don't even come out."}
{"text":"We were 7 ppl. In general, the food tasted soso.  Service was really slow.  We've waited for 20 minutes for every round. And the sashimi were not fresh. Choices of sushi were not so many. So we just repeated orders.  In addition the tips were included in the bill, we didn't have the option to choose how much for tips. (Given the unsatisfied service ) :(  Will not recommend you to go."}
