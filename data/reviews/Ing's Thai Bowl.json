{"text":"I just love the royal pad thai, cuz i alwayz loved sour padthais.

im a crazy padthai lover, i've had spring roll padthai, thai express padthai and thai bowl padthai.

thai express is very addictive! but different locations serves different qualities. hwoever it's really fatening, so i started eating at thai bowl.

u can get the 3.35 (include tax) small padthai if you want a healthy,weight losing diet for lunch, it is sour though, but like i said i love sour padthais, so it really depends."}
{"text":"Had lunch a bit early (11am) and they had only a few of the dishes out. However the dishes they did have were very tasty. By no means authentic Thai but the price is ok and the vegis are very fresh."}
{"text":"A cheap Thai eat place. They serve noodle bowl, which I believe is pho. 

And I got the red chicken curry of course. I found it a little spicy, quality was as expected of a food court."}
