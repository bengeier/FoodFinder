{"text":"the food is amazing !!!!!!!! and the service is the best i love itt!"}
{"text":"I first stumbled upon this place hoping to grab a bite before I got on the metro, but it was closed. I made sure to check it out next time I was in the area, and sure enough I got there with less than half an hour until closing time. The place was about as busy as you'd expect a place to be at 2 in the afternoon, but I wasn't the only one there.

Inside it was like just about any other hole in the wall, paper plates and everything. Order your food at the counter, and grab a drink from the fridge while it's prepared right in front of you. The staff was friendly, chatting with me a bit while the food was being prepared. They seemed to want to know about me and where I came from. There was Greek music playing in the background, which I thought was a nice touch, give the general lack of decoration.

The chicken was great, which is all the really matters. Covered in herbs and spices and grilled to perfection. I also had fries with it, but they were not particularly great. Almost your typical fast food fries, except they were seasoned. Meh, they still went well with the chicken."}
{"text":"Pretty good Greek food. Had the chicken Souvlaki trio which came with seasoned fries and a drink. I was pleasantly surprised how good the pita tasted. Nice atmosphere and the people who run the restaurant are also nice. Very inexpensive as well. Would recommend for a quick meal."}
{"text":"Probably the best Greek restaurant in MTL. However, last time I went my friend found a huge nail in his gyro, don't know where it came from but be careful before indulging. Besides that, their food is great and their fries are exceptional. Their gyros are a must try and so is their chicken breast. Their opening hours are completely stupid though. I have never seen a store close between 1 pm and 4pm. Unacceptable."}
{"text":"I really (really really) like this place :D

Atmosphere: no frills, no thrills, but definitely no chills - place is clean, tidy and spacious.  The booths are a little small (barely fitting one person per bench) - but you're here for the food (see below) not the accommodations I promise you!  Very much help yourself type of style - don't forget to grab a pitcher of water from the fridge before you sit down!

Service: 5 starts and then some! John the owner is down to earth guy and extremely friendly - doesn't seem to take himself too seriously, casually throwing in \"brother\" 2-3 times in a sentence a al Hulk Hogan :D  Always curious and patient - I've never had a bad encounter yet.  Top marks to him as the face of Sparta.

Food: Not sure what it is about grilled chicken - but this is another place that gets top marks in my book and deservedly so.  You have to try the souvlaki here - the bread that's used is to die for.  Covered in rosemary herbs and piping hot - it's a generous meal in and of itself.  Spicy or Regular - I go for spicy but both are great!  One can order the half-chicken (for in house consumption) or the whole-chicken (for take out or delivery).  The meat falls off the bone! Grilled and partly baked to lock in the flavour - this is chicken done the Greek way and it's done so very well.  Affordable and simple - it's a meal you won't regret and will come back for again and again!

THIS IS SPARTA! :D"}
{"text":"This place has recently revamped themselves a little bit; they've lowered prices and switched from having waitstaff to ordering at the counter. This means paper plates and plasticware instead of silverwear and ceramic plates, if that makes a difference to you.

All in all, Sparta's now a really good bargain. You can get a souvlaki pita for $5 or a trio for $7, which is comparable to anything at the mall across the street, but the quality is much higher. Whole chickens to take out were at about $12, and two for $22. At those prices, my husband and I joked about showing up at parties with twho whole chickens instead of a bag of chips.

The chicken is seasoned nicely and grilled, and the flavor is just great. The sauce on the pita is nice and garlicky and the pita is soft. The whole thing has lots of a peppery greek sprinkle on it, which helps to take things to the next level. I believe they also give a discount for students, so that's a good thing if"}
{"text":"Greek salad was chilled and refreshing. Chicken was mouthwatering and fill of flavor. Service at the counter was very friendly."}
{"text":"Do one thing and do it well...  always a good motto.  You won't find much on the menu beyond roast chicken, chicken pita, and a couple salads... but the roasted chicken is strait up amazing.  It really is the best I've ever had, anywhere, fancy restaurants included.  I order takeout at least a couple times a month.

Atmosphere is more takeout style than sit down style, but the manager is super friendly and it's always a pleasure to come in.  Fantastic neighborhood joint."}
{"text":"My opinion and bunch of my friends?  

They will let you have a bite of most delicious chicken ever! 

My favourite is the 2 legs special !

Don't miss out :)"}
{"text":"Staying nearby in Westmount (first time in Canada), figured we would get a small bite for our first meal on the way to the apartment. Super warm staff, delicious souvlaki - Mark was such a nice guy! Wouldn't let us leave without trying the pita. Would definitely recommend this place to all Greek food lovers."}
{"text":"Visited twice, tried regular and spicy chicken. Smelled (unusually charred delicious smell) incredible, and tasted good. But the whole chicken was dry, burnt to a black char. Had to discard the dry black scorched wings and part of legs. Spicy chicken was extremely salty. OK frozen fries. Inconsistent service."}
{"text":"Zabiha halal!

Chicken heaven! S/O and family had chicken legs, and chicken sandwiches... super delicious! Restaurant was extremely clean and well-maintained... the ambiance was enjoyable.

Prices were reasonable. Def a great spot to visit for halal foodies!"}
{"text":"Délicieux poulet sur le grill bien assaisonné. Le sandwich est mon préféré et ils savent assaisonner pour ceux qui aiment leur repas bien épicé!"}
{"text":"I was brought to this place by friends and colleagues of mine to, once again, remind me that the effervescent food utopia is all true real downtown.

This is a lovely spacious well-lit space delivering an impressively affordable incredibly tasty array of filled up plates. It seems a little more expensive because of you'd think they'd leave your plate half-empty like the rest of the food stores near them. No-uh, fill that plate until the fries almost fall off.

Amazingly friendly staff. They speak French, English, Persian, Greek and Romanian as far as I could tell. Joking and loving. It almost felt like going to a family reunion with only the cool ones.

I fully recommend this place. Divine juicy chicken with nice tasting fries."}
{"text":"By far the best chicken i've had in Montreal. The place is simple but they serve good food, fast. Their menu is small but portion are generous. We tried the legs trio and the Caesar salad with grilled chicken. Both were great and even my two young children loved it. The owner was also very nice. We will definitely be returning here."}
{"text":"If I could rate Sparta six stars, wallahi I would, Habibi.

As you walk in, you're greeted by their friendly staff, and in my case the owner was very grateful that I brought my friends. \"Thanks for coming brother! \"

It's the sort of warm welcome that keeps you coming back.

Now, the chicken. In a market that's getting flooded with very similar and overrated Portugueseries, Sparta marches into battle to the beat of their own drum. They bring Greek BBQ Chicken to the Halal scene in Montreal with a flourish. Seasoned to perfection with salt, oregano and their secret spicy sauce, Sparta really manages to differentiate themselves with just the right level of spice and flavour. The natural taste of of the grilled chicken shines through through and baby, it's the business.

Split half a chicken between two of you or have an entire one to yourself if you're well hungry, but do try it, habibis.

Our conclusion: there are few better options for Iftar this Ramadan. A++, would eat again."}
{"text":"Sparta chicken is basically the best chicken in Montreal.

I challenge anyone who disagrees to a family guy style chicken fight, any time, anywhere.

This ain't no \"piri-piri\" chicken, baby.

This recipe hails from Sparta, Greece, where the original owner of the joint, Yahyah is from. It is said that he learnt it from a reclusive hermit grandmaster while training in the mountains. He may or may not have taken his life once the secret recipe was revealed to him, we'll never know.

The chicken in question is the perfect balance of:
1. Tender
2. Moist
3. Flavourful
4. Seasoned
5. Spicy
6. Lightly charred
7. Decent price

It's taste is barbecued but with a unique blend of herbs and spices sprinkled on top, and the spicy sauce has a nice kick that doesn't overpower the flavour of the chicken and herbs. 

I'm not crazy about fries so I recommend taking a chicken and a small salad, it's a great combination.

Frankly I hope this franchise expands to other locations in and around Montreal, because Sparta chicken is a phenomenon you simply must experience as a Montrealer.

The added bonus that it's Halal is just that much more awesome."}
{"text":"This was my first time here. My parents had previously raved about this place and then about a month ago my dad had mentioned that the last time they went, it had gone downhill. I decided to try it for myself.

I ordered a chicken pita with fries and an extra Ceasar salad on the side. Right away, there was an issue with the owner's credit card terminal. He insisted that I tap my card, but refused to turn the terminal towards me so I could see the amount. He said that he doesn't make mistakes and that I should trust him. So far, good times!

About 5 minutes later, the cook placed my food on the counter. Unfortunately, despite being famished, this meal was nearly inedible;

Ceasar salad: drenched in a mass produced store bought dressing that tastes like what you would get at a Super C. If you are going to ruin a salad like this, just take the thing off the menu. It's pure laziness to serve this when you could easily make a batch of homemade dressing once a week.

Chicken Pita and fries: The tzatziki sauce was quite good which saves this review from getting one star. The chicken was barely warm. It seems like they had precooked it earlier in the day. There's no other explanation for it not being piping hot. The pita was thin and coated in so much salted seasoning that it completely overpowered the sandwich. The same goes for the fries that were overly salted to the point of hurting my tongue. They were also not very warm and slightly soggy.

What a letdown!"}
{"text":"I can't believe I never reviewed Sparta.

You might ask yourself why this place thrives while others fail here.

The chicken is moist, tender, marinated and char grilled.

There is a distinctive taste i have yet to see anywhere else

The fries are standard, but once they absorb the juices from the chicken atop, it kicks it up a notch.

The seating is very cafeteria like, but thats ok for me."}
{"text":"Sparta's chicken in Westmount could be a strong contender for best in Montreal, not just best Greek chicken but B-E-S-T chicken. Period

It's a bold claim but I can back it up saying it is the juiciest, most tender, perfectly seasoned chicken one can find, the spices are delicate and don't overwhelm and mask inferior quality chicken.

To see a new location around Christmas made me believe in Santa again, so I had to try it out. 

We got a full chicken takeout, it's about $18 with no sides but I always keep pita and tzatziki at home anyway. The skinny fries are binge worthy but i was trying to stay away from the carboload.

The chicken was still hot and fresh, one half spicy as requested and it's enough for 3 or 4 people.

We spoke with the owner who was super friendly, it didn't seem that busy when we went (weird that they open at 3PM?), but the other location took some time to get it's reputation around the area. So all the best to this new location."}
{"text":"Pretty good minus the fact that the chicken are huge pieces in the pita and there's barely any sauce and no lettuce which would of made it awesome. They only deliver after 5 pm which is okay still took a hour."}
{"text":"The place is very simple, but it's the best chicken of Montreal. I use to buy the hole chicken to eat at home. It stays Always moist and delicious for days in the fridge!"}
{"text":"A no-nonsense business that serves great food. Owner(?) was fun to chat with.
It's located right outside of the Atwater mall, so its a nice alternative to the shopping center's rather boring food court. Great place if you like marinated grilled chicken and delicious gyros. Fries are nothing special - they're more fillers than anything else. Prices are moderate, and portion sizes are ok."}
{"text":"Love love Sparta. I'm a chicken whore so I visit this place often! Spicy chicken is what I order all the time which is hard to find among other restaurants! Everything is delish from here. They deliver also!"}
{"text":"Brother in law raves about this place and it was pretty solid. Only tried the chicken souvlaki but it was very good. Wish the portions were s bit bigger and s bit spicier but still very solid."}
{"text":"Great fast food and portions.  It's definitely casual dining with the plastic trays and paper plates but it delivers on the flavour especially the succulent chicken.  I see people ordering a half chicken and just devouring it completely. I suggested this place to my parents and we went together as a family of five to eat and all were happy and satisfied. We probably should've tried to group our orders together in the sense of getting a bigger portion and splitting it between each other. We ordered the large traditional Greek salad which was a great side dish to complement the chicken and fries.  Speaking of the fries, they sprinkle a bit of seasoning on it that make them irresistible! I would also consider going to get the food for takeout to enjoy at home as well."}
{"text":"This was probably the best meal I had during my vacation to Montreal.

We went on a Saturday evening and it was pretty busy. Lots of family and many small kids (soo much crying :/)  
Sadly, there was only 1 waitress/cashier/server so we were alittle miffed at the wait time but the food was worth it.

I had the Chicken Souvlaki plate and my husband had the mixed souvlaki plate. Both with greek salad and greek potatoes. We got a side of feta & olives and a side of pita thinking we'd still be hungry (wrong).

The Pita portion is pitiful :(  it's really meant to be per person. It was dry and chewy :(
the portion of olives and feta is huge though.

The greek salads were great and the souvlaki plates were too. Huge portion sizes."}
{"text":"Very sad that I have to give such an awful review to one of my formerly favourite spots for rotisserie chicken. I regularly order delivery from Sparta and am (was...) a regular patron at the restaurant. The last time I ordered delivery, my order did not arrive for more than 2 hours. This would not normally be a deal breaker but instead of receiving an apology for the stone cold food, I was confronted by a hostile driver who seemed offended that I expressed disappointment in the service. Naturally, I was not inclined to give a tip for such rude service despite having tipped generously on all of my other orders. After this encounter I was told -after recently calling for delivery- that they will no longer deliver to my address. Apparently, this is some sort of retribution for not giving them a tip on a single delivery. Very unprofessional and very bad for business."}
{"text":"Sparta is so good and very affordable! Owners and staff are really really sweet also, my boyfriend and I have been hooked up with free fries so many times! :') ALSO, THE FRIES-they're soooo good and have a unique twist to them. I've had the chicken souvlaki back in the days where I ate meat and it was also very very yummy."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place, can't believe I havent already reviewed it!
Montreal is truly lucky to have a halal greek place like this one! Warm cosy interior with genuine staff, the owner is a lovely humble and friendly guy.
I had the spicy chicken souvlaki which was absolutely perfect and my husband had the half chicken, also very well seasoned. Love the tzatziki, the pita bread, salad ... Everything! This place is simple but huge hearty portions, you are sure to feel sleepy after a meal at Sparta's!! 
Highly recommend this place if you want to eat well and feel at home!!"}
{"text":"This place is just amazing! The staff is so nice and the food is absolutely delicious!"}
{"text":"HALAL!
This place is Montreal's secret. Delicious and flavorful Greek chicken. I had the spicy chicken souvlaki which was bursting in flavor. I also enjoyed the fries that came with it though it was  nothing special. It reminded me of McDonald fries. The chicken however is something special. So good! The greek salad and pita was also delicious and fresh. SO glad I came upon this place in Montreal. The owner was super friendly and rumor is there opening up a location in Toronto soon! *crosses finger*
Price was average and the atmosphere was cozy. 4 Stars because of the fries. Huge portions though.
Definitely miss this place!"}
{"text":"Fabulous chicken.Had it three times .taste gets better each time. Delivery was a problem. Took over 1 hour.
."}
{"text":"I was craving for chicken I decided to give this place a try.   The staff was very friendly. I ordered the breast chicken comb It was so big I couldn't even finish it I took the leftovers home. The chicken tasted amazing I been around many restaurants but this just surprised me. If your in the Montreal area this place is a must try. If your looking for great customer service and great food."}
{"text":"One of Montreals hidden jewels. Delicious, fresh , full of flavour and well marinated. Had the Half Chicken made to perfection with pita and tzatziki sauce ,even got a Grilled Chicken Salad it was amazing ."}
{"text":"Best chicken I ever had in my life. Overpowering with flavour, and not too pricey either."}
{"text":"I have been going to this place for years and the experience is always great! I cannot begin to describe how good the food taste and how fast the service is! Also love that it's a Halal joint!"}
{"text":"Used to love this place because the chicken was always fresh, but on their worst days,, they will serve you hard to chew chicken and the color will be pink... i rather eat McDonald's instead and go home happy. Ordered a two leg combo (two times) and it was a waste of 30$ dollars. Whoever is going there make sure you tell them, you dont want old and pink chicken meat."}
{"text":"Service was a little cheeky but kind of expected. Food was ok, nothing special. Very typical souvlaki and the fries were tasty but not really anything to go back for. I saw a few people eating the chicken and it looked pretty tempting, I may go back to try it if I am in the neighbourhood.  It's pretty decent considering I had very little time to eat and I didn't want to eat McDonalds or sacwich however, I would not go out of my way to eat here."}
{"text":"I actually went to this place only delivery. I usually order their chicken for post workout meals. The chicken is good however the delivery takes too long (45-60min)"}
{"text":"Delicious chicken, very good seasoning, good portion and good price. Also had a cesear salad which was delicious! Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Best Greek restaurant in MTL. Food is amazing. Service is quick. Great price. Will definitely be here next time im in town. Owner makes you feel super welcome. Good honest establishment.

-Waseem from Astoria"}
{"text":"Sparta chickens is the best in the city. Great location for business and school. The food is amazing and the owner really friendly. Would love to see better business hour during weekends. Overall excellent place to be. Great job guys."}
{"text":"The chicken in this place Is fantastic!! Extremely flavorful, grilled to perfection and with tangy spices. Little pieces burnt that taste great. The French fries are also excellent and the salads are very good too."}
{"text":"If  I happen to crave some Sparta no one can stop me ! Like a brave ancient greek soldier i get ready and rush on to St Catherine street to meet my dear Br. Yahya ! Anytime of the day their chickens are minutes away from beeing ready ! The menu is very straight forward, no dilemmas when youre ordering it all depends on how hungry you are, which pieces of chicken you want and if you want it spicy and if you want some pita bread, their chicken souvlaki are very good and offered either as a plate or in a sandwich, their fries dipped into their secret sauce that is hidden in a franks hot sauce bottle is so yummmy in my tummy ! The owner will praise and thank you from the moment you enter the restaurant until you leave ! He is a genuine man with good values and high level of respect for all his customers ! The interior is warm and welcoming, the exposed-brique wall and the great grill smoked across the restaurant makes you just want to sit there after you are done your meal ! The portions are very very generous ! One order is served on 2 plates ;) take out or dine in you wont go wrong either way !"}
{"text":"DO NOT COME HERE WITH KIDS! We didn't get a chance to dine here so I can't vouch for the food but I walked toward the bathroom and there was a really Hale at smell of cigarette smoke and cigarette packets on the table. Didn't want to stay here with my baby for long so we left."}
{"text":"In all honesty one of the best roasted/grilled/seasoned chicken legs of all my time. 

I have wanted to try this place many times, but our timing never jived. This was an in-between meal so thus just the one chicken leg, but was just what I needed.

Lemon juice, oil and oregano on top, made the chicken skin irresistible. What a mess I left, so thankfully they had a basket of wet wipe packets - I used two and three napkins.

I must go back to try the other Greek dishes and get more of that moist savory bird."}
{"text":"My husband and I were looking for something quick late on a Sunday - 9 PM - and didn't want to walk far from the movie theater.  As we were walking towards this place, some folks who had just eaten there asked if we were looking for a place to eat.  They had just eaten there for the first time and raved about it.  I had the chicken souvlaki pita and my husband the half chicken.  Both were delicious - the chicken was extremely moist and very flavorful.  The staff, too, was extremely friendly.  Would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Pretty good! The chicken was nice, very moist, but well done! The souvlaki was one of the best in Montreal that I've had. The fries are just perfect! The service is very quick, and they have multiple levels of spice. Very cheap for what you can get, must check out. Downside: erratic hours, so check ahead (good for lunch)."}
{"text":"I just tried their famous Souvlaki Pita, and instantly knew what's so famous about it. This wrap was so good it ruined any other Souvlaki Pita I'll have anywhere else in the foreseeable future."}
{"text":"Everything written about how good the chicken is is absolutely true ! I tried the chicken souvlaki pita and it was pretty much perfect. Chicken was tender, full of flavour, moist and tasty as hell. The fries were great too, and to top it off the staff were super nice and helpful! Would go back in a heart beat :)"}
