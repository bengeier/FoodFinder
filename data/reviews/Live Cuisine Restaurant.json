{"text":"This review is for the \"After Show\" dessert and coffee special Live puts on at the LAC following some larger night-time events. 

Simply put, $12/person for Unlimited buffet style desserts and coffee/tea! 

Check the photos for a representative sample of what to expect while we were there Chocolate cake, fruit pies, fresh fruit platter, cheesecake, strudel, cream pie and more were on offer. 

We tried nearly everything and thought they were good quality/fresh and solid value for money. 

Call the LAC to find out what nights this offer is available, and if in the DT Sauga area, mark it on your calendar. 

This is a hidden-gem spot for dessert that should be more widely known than at present, but is limited by their variable schedule. 


We have eaten the lunch buffet in the past, but will have a review of the seasonal special lunch buffet in the near future."}
{"text":"We came for a post show dessert/tea. The location is ideal as it is in the LAC just beside the elevators/stairs leading to the parking garage, so you don't have to go in the snowy outdoors to get there.
They offer coffee/dessert for a set price....around $13pp and they have 4 cakes/pies that you can enjoy. Our server was so friendly and helpful.
They also do a pre show dinner that we did not try this time....but will keep in mind for future shows.
Our show let out first so it wasn't crowded but once the other theatre let out, it became busier. No problem getting a table for dessert but the manager suggested reserving for pre-show dinners as they often get booked up in advance."}
{"text":"My first time here.... It's convenient, I thought, right before the Gordon Lightfoot concert.

It's also my last time here.

Buffet is $36 plus taxes, etc.

Almost nothing was edible.  The cauliflower salad was surprisingly good.  Jumbo shrimp would have been great, except that they were so full of water... They needed to be squeezed between paper towels to get rid of the water.

The beef would have been good, if only it had been seasoned.  The squash were so hard they were virtually raw. The stuffed pork was soooo dry and overcooked.  The roast potatoes were good.

The desserts were all pretty dreadful.  The chocolate cake was so dry I could have used it as a rasp.

It's too bad.  I'm coming back to see 2 other shows.... I would like to have eaten here, it's so convenient. 

But I sure as heck won't be."}
