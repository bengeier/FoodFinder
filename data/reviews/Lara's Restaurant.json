{"text":"When we entered \"Laras Restaurant\" there was a table of fifteen people with man kids participating for a presentation dinner, they were having very loud conversations and discussions, babies were crying,  younger ones running all around the room parents yelling after the kids, for a moment I thought I was in a kindergarten.  In another table the owner was loudly chatting with another costumer who was making a reservation for an event. (In such cases you do this in a private office).  After we ordered our food I asked the server if it is possible to move us to another table away from the noises to feel more comfortable, she asked the owner about our request, the answer was \"NO\" in a very loud voice. The owners behaviour was arrogant and rude;  the server's excuse was that the room is dedicated for events only, if so then the presentation dinner table should have been located in that room.  Once our food was brought out, the ground beef kebab and the chicken Shish Tawouk was overcooked and blackened, the remaining dishes were bland. It was very disappointing.  After a short period of time, another group of young customers arrived they set right behind us and they watched the debate on the TV with very high volume. The place looked like a bazaar rather then a Restaurant.  It was such a disastrous night, I don't advise anyone if you're looking to spend a quiet evening to go there, very unprofessional place and doesn't even deserves a 1 star."}
{"text":"Delicious middle eastern food at a very reasonable price. Good selection of wine and a nice quiet place to grab lunch or dinner... You can actually carry a conversation with the party you are dining with as there is no unnecessary loud noise.  Open late and you really can't go wrong with anything you order... Family owned with warm service... Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing! Was here for a banquet and had almost everything on the menu so I don't remember everything but it was all good! Love middle eastern food and this was one of the places for it.   Everything was good and yummy. Recommend the food and recommend coming here for a banquet dinner."}
{"text":"I kept seeing their commercials all throughout programming on Saturday mornings. I decided to try it out as a possibility for a reception. We called ahead to inquire about pricing, menu choices etc., let them know we would be stopping by for lunch and to discuss details (check out the seating, menu etc.). It was empty when we arrived, still had slow service. Once our food was brought out it was practically dumped on the table without even looking at us etc.  I was very disappointed. The ground beef kebobs were so overcooked they were blackened in some spots, very dry and nothing I would classify as kebob - probably even reheated from the night before. Is that how much they wanted our business for a party of 150? Something as simple as a fatoush salad wasn't even made right (we ordered 1 of each of their main meat dishes to try).  We finished our meal and headed out to another restaurant at Keele & 7 (La Grill). Had an amazing experience as always - they even comped us our meal. I wanted to choose Lara because it was close to our church and came highly recommended. I didn't choose them and went with La Grill even though our guests had a slightly longer drive - we were not disappointed. FYI i went back to Lara on 2 other occasions for receptions, after funeral lunches and had their food at catered events. Big disappointment after all the hype behind their food. Didn't care for their lax and unprofessional attitude either. The biggest reason I didn't book them for Baptism reception - they wouldn't budge on letting me customize the menu based on dietary needs and what we were looking for out of a menu. They insisted on \"what you see is what you get\" Which is unheard of when someone is paying a lot of money for food & drinks. I've had a lot better than what they offer - embarrassed that they are the same background as me."}
{"text":"Great place to eat. Great atmosphere/location. Friendly location. In the mood for middle eastern food? You have to go to Lara's!"}
{"text":"We had our Xmas lunch party here and besides the humus that was pretty good, the rest of the food was  awful. I'm giving it 1 star because I don't have the option of giving it a big fat 0. The salad had way too much dressing and included romaine or lettuce hearts (which should have been left out), the potatoes were cold, and the turkey was dry. Plus the portion was very small.  As I went to the bar to get a drink, I was told I had to bring my own glass? Do they not have a dishwasher to wash their utensils? Then I asked for a Coke which was flat. I went back for ginger ale...flat too. I asked the barmaid if she knows that her pop is flat and she just smiled and said \"oh well\"....I figured maybe she doesn't understand English or something.  In any case, I was disappointed by this place and I'll never go there ever again.  Good thing I didn't have to pay out of pocket because I wouldn't give more than $9.99 for the food I ate...and that's being generous.  Don't go there, it's really not worth the trip. A combo at Tim hortons is better than this place ."}
{"text":"Found this place to eat dinner while rush hour traffic died down on a recent visit to Toronto. It was such a nice surprise.  The place was empty and we felt we had a private dinner. Started with an order of falafel and for my main course had a chicken dish with rice and salad. It was more than enough food. The chicken was tender and flavorful, the rice was light and buttery. The salad was full of crisp cucumbers.  At the end of the meal the server offered free coffee. I indulged and had a latte. The whole experience felt fancy and fun. A great find and much better than sitting in traffic!"}
{"text":"Wow. I am not sure how to describe my experience today. Zero service, I mean absolutely absent. I was trying to find people and actually went into \"employee only\" trying to find someone. Truly surreal. I still tipped 15% out of pity. Something is so wrong here. Food not good. Service...well. I can only some it up with \"bizarre\". Steer clear. Quite something."}
