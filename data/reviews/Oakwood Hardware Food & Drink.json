{"text":"My partner and I came here for a nice Saturday dinner. They take reservations which was a plus. The atmosphere is nice - we loved the decor, the lights, and the hostess was warm. We both got the beef on this giant bone and sitting on vegetables and polenta and it was great. My partner was upset he didn't get the fried chicken so we will be back- we saw it at the table next to us. I'm giving it four because the service was very slow - we waiting about 20 minutes to get the bill as just one example, although very nice. They could have used one more server on the floor as they seemed overwhelmed. Overall nice meal, reasonable priced, a great addition to the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Taste good! We ordered the Vanentine's day special and black bean chili and lobster beef something. All of them taste good! And the service is good too!"}
{"text":"A pretty room with friendly service. We had brunch that was slow to come and lacked the finesse to rate top marks. I hope they iron out the kinks since this neighbourhood needs a solid restaurant."}
{"text":"Okay, you see my two stars and think  \" this restaurant must have shit food.... I'll spend my money elsewhere\" ....here's the thing: Oakwood Hardware has FABULOUS food, and a gorgeously adorable tony lil' atmosphere... but here's the deal, the service made me feel so unwanted, so uncared for, so awkward, and judged ...... maybe I'm not \"hipster\" or \"chill\" enough.. but if my husband and I are out to dinner on a Friday night after a long ass week of work, we want nice service and a nice meal, for the $175  we spent here  ( around that)  ____THE DRINKS____ I had the Yellowtail which was a superbly crafted cocktail with a hint of citrus and beautiful egg-white froth , husband had their take on an Old fashioned type of bourbon drink  ( forget the name) both were awesome... BUT when I  went to ask the server which drink, and a little more explanation of what's in it, he gave me a one word rushed answer and didn't give two shits..... fine..... I get it, I'm a patron asking YOU the server a question- ' OH HOW BOTHERSOME YOU PEASANT PATRON'  ......  moving on.... _________THE FOOD___________ we ordered :  Oakwood Meze Fried cauliflower, naan with za'atar and cheese, baba ghanoush and tahini -- * too much bread , not a lot of cauliflower ( which was why we ordered this in the first place)   Tacos got Seoul DELISH....really amazing tacos    entrees: the KFC ( amazing ) and  husband had surf and turf special ( also amazing)  ( and the fries are super good too....very rustic and all dishes came hot which is a huge deal for me)  okay the PROBLEMS:  ..... without getting in to semantics , basically our server never repeated the items to us, never explained what was with the dishes unless i really pried him-- so items came not as we had expected....for example, despite READING the menu properly we both 100% thought the meze was a Cauliflower dish.... didn't really see the part about the pita bread.... so when the plate arrived we were very confused--- here's the thing IF OUR SERVER HAD EXPLAINED  ( ' romanced  ' -- as we used to say in restaurants I have worked in) the dish we would have KNOWN this and ordered the arepas appy instead.......  anywho----  we ordered nutella cheesecake for dessert which was great, not mind blowing but very good... I didn't even care entirely to order dessert, but again I felt so judged and rushed by our server I just said \" ya sure we'll have that one\"   ....  there was an \"I'm far better than you \" demeanor about this whole experience I am sorry to say ....  I would go back for a drink at the bar or something  like that....but not to sit for a fun dinner with  my husband and have a judgey, snarky, shitty server  take care of us END. RANT"}
{"text":"Fantastic food, awesome drinks and a great space.  Don't miss the Korean fried chicken dinner or Sunday brunch buffet -- worth the drive!"}
{"text":"Has potential. They need to work out the kinks.   Pros: my meal- seafood curry. Very good. But not the best I've had.   Apps. Fried cauliflower. Very good combination of flavours.   Drinks: great! I'm a sucker for anything pisco sour- ish. And everything's better with egg white foam. My favourite. A Paloma - \"not available tonight \". #kinks   Beer list: pretty typical hipster selection - ipa's, dark stuff. You're covered if you're a craft beer type.   Decor: great, almost bar Isabel like.   Crowd: locals. A few strollers.   Service: Bad - waiter said he was on second shift. So all the things you'd expect. Didn't know what's on draught. Couldn't answer a question and we gave up asking. He said he saw the short rib on his first shift and it looked great. Well, my dining partner ordered it and was really let down. It wasn't bad. Just a very traditionalSunday night roast with mashed potatoes. Moms is a bit better. But everything here has a twist. Like fired Korean chicken leg with kimchee. So she was expecting something traditional with some flare. This was straight up. And , well hey. We went to a cool spot and didn't want a hunk of meat from granny. Had we had a good server, we would've ordered the right thing.   Anyway, it has potential! We saw the best server in the history of servers at the next table run down specials like a graceful thespian. I think this would be a much better review if we had him. :).   Give it at shot."}
{"text":"The food is so delicious! We got 5 apps and 4 drinks and cost us just under $90. Beautiful atmosphere! I would recommend a friend to go here! Young urban hipster vibe with a sick drink menu. So good.  I must try the KFC (Korean Fried Chicken) next time - the table next to us got it and apparently it's what everyone in the neighbourhood is raving about. Deff a next time!  Also Anne's (owner) sister was so warm and hospitable!   Great value, great food, great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"As soon as we walked into this restaurant I immediately loved the way it looked. The dining area is spacious but cozy and the furniture/decor gives off a warm and genuine feel. We were greeted by the very friendly staff and sat down to check out the hand-written menu. It turns out that the menu changes quite frequently since the chef tries to use fresh seasonal ingredients when possible. I started off by ordering the arepas with black beans and cheese. The arepa itself was decent and the toppings added some smokey flavour to make for a fairly filling appetizer. I almost didn't have enough room afterwards to eat my main dish - the lentil shepherds pie (with a side salad). This was a generous serving that certainly filled me up. Perhaps it wasn't technically a pie since there was no bottom crust, but that's pretty irrelevant. The lentils were the foundation of the pie with a layer of potato and a crispy top above them. It was definitely tasty but not exactly out of this world. I enjoyed the dining experience overall. The food came out a bit slowly and it wasn't a revelation when it got to the table, but it was good. With a little fine tuning the food can be great and I suspect the service will become speedier as well. I will absolutely come back to try this place out again!"}
{"text":"My partner and I had high hopes for this cute neighbourhood restaurant, but the food was disappointing both times we've tried it for dinner. Very mediocre meals, with downtown prices."}
{"text":"Top notch Sunday Brunch. Hearty buffet and not your run of the mill menu either. Gentrification can has its upsides, esp. If you're not keen on eating brooms from the local dollar store."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I popped in when we were in the neighbourhood and were pleasantly surprised. The atmosphere was very warm and welcoming and our waiter Joel made the experience even better. The menu was a little small but the burger we got was outstanding. Very romantic date spot. Really enjoyed this place, if I lived in the area I would most definitely go again, and certainly recommend it."}
{"text":"Great spot! Really enjoyed the lentil shepherd's pie! Some nice little Asian surprises - like Kimchi fried rice with the fried chicken."}
{"text":"So very happy that Anne and her team finally opened! We went early on a Saturday night, small kids in tow, and WOW was the place busy...it actually stayed packed late into the evening.  Menu choices for Celiac's were limited for now but they're still working the kinks out. The drinks were great, holy moonshine lemonade.  Seeing as we live 30 seconds away, I'm 100% certain we'll be back again and again!  Welcome to the neighbourhood!"}
{"text":"I went here for Mother's Day and ordered a sunny side egg. While eating from the delicious buffet, they had bacon, back bacon, turkey, pork sausages, banana french toast which was delicious, smoked salmon...and many more. The fellows I went with couldn't stop eating the almond croissants, it was pretty funny. The waiter was quite funny and overall the food was great! HAPPY MOTHERS DAY!!"}
{"text":"This was not a success. Service was spotty all night. The appetizers (onion soup, aranciata) were very good but the mains not. Two of us had steak frites--the steak was overdone and tough, the frites soggy. The Korean Fried Chicken had too much breading, but the hamburger was pronounced just fine. Desserts were good. The price was much too high for the quality delivered. The place is handsome but noisy when full.   I doubt we'll be back."}
{"text":"I went for Easter brunch and the food was amazing. There was really great service, the staff was very friendly. Everything is very reasonably priced and the quality of the food was much more than I expected. It's a very charming location and I suggest asking for one of the booths at the back!"}
{"text":"Had the most wonderful night at this restaurant. The food was phenomenal, the service was exceptional, and the atmosphere was amazing. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone looking to have a great meal and experience something so much better than regular chain restaurants. Joel was our waiter and he was exceptional offering us specials and recommending drinks. Will be a go to place for us moving forward! They even do brunch on the weekend! Thank you for an amazing experience!"}
{"text":"Great addition to the neighbourhood, and their brunch buffet and taco Tuesday is amazing!"}
{"text":"This is a great local restaurant. They've been open for about a month or so and have some of the small hiccoughs of a new restaurant such as having to ask for water, and being asked if we have a reservation (no) then being asked to wait when the restaurant was not even half full. But nothing that ruined the overall experience.   My friend and I went here for dinner. We ordered a few things to share. Our favourite was the lentil shepherds pie. It was delish and very filling. The apple and but salad was good but the dressing tasted like Kraft dressing. We tried to order the Korean chicken, but were informed it was sold out. Our waitress offered us an alternative chicken dish and it was also very good.   The staff here are very friendly and there was a great atmosphere with lots of local families and big tables. We really enjoyed our experience here and will definitely try it again to see how it improves as they get a little more experience under their belt."}
{"text":"We've been to Oakwood Hardware a couple of times now and have been very impressed both times.  On our first visit, we tried the daily fish special which was fish on a bed of coconut curry (?) rice.  We also tried the \"KFC\" (Korean Fried Chicken) with kimchi rice which is SOOO delicious!  It is truly a good substitute if you're craving the real KFC and probably much better for you, lol!  The kids menu is well suited for kids - there's pasta with tomato or butter sauce, mini hotdogs, a mini burger or chicken fingers. Our server, Gracie, is amazing.  She is super friendly and made us feel really welcome and at ease.  She even brought over some little playing cards and colouring for our son. The atmosphere is really good too. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Superb little gem on Oakwood Avenue. The short ribs and the kids pasta were flawless. Kudos to the bartender.... the spring storm and the tegroni were great!"}
{"text":"Would not recommend. They were out of 2 (if not more) beers on a Saturday night, and out of the Arancini. The portions of the Tacos and the Meze were so sad. There was maybe a tablespoon of meat on each taco, and about 2 tablespoons of the dip for the meze - plus the rest of the meze wasn't the best. Service wasn't great, just generally existed. Will never go back, they need to figure their shit out."}
{"text":"Went for brunch. Buffet lets you order eggs, then go get other items while waiting. Great for kids. Food was good, especially the baked goods and the hash browns."}
{"text":"I went there a few months ago with my girlfriend. We showed up at 9:45 on a Thursday night. I worked until 9 so we just went right after that. They told us politely that the kitchen closed in 15 so we got our order in. They were nice enough about the situation but 10pm closing isn't realistic in this neighbourhood to me. I work in a restaurant in the area and I understand completely wanting customers to leave so I can go home, but 10 pm on a Thursday? Cmon!   The food was decent enough, I had lamb and my girlfriend had kimchi chicken. I'd give the food a 6/10 but for that price, there's so much better that's only a bus ride away.   I like to see places like this pop up in my neighbourhood but I think they're trying to appeal to a demographic that doesn't yet exist in this area. I'm not apposed to going back if a friend or family member suggests it, but I'm not making plans to do it either.   Decidedly....meh?"}
{"text":"Amazing place for a family dinner. The only thing that annoyed me was the fawning and over-attentive server. And the food! My kid loved it, my wife loved it, and I loved it. Great beer on tap too, the house lager made by Wellington is an instant fav."}
{"text":"I went here last night for the first time for dinner. Wow let me start off by saying that the KFC (Korean Fried Chicken) that everyone is talking about is honestly the best dish I've had in a long time. The Kimchi rice had a nice kick to it that complimented the chicken well. Very satisfied with the portion size too. Wasn't too big but yet wasn't so small that it left you feeling unsatisfied, it was just right. I ordered their Blood brother Milk of the poppy beer and again no complaints there, it was the first time I had it and it was good. I highly recommend trying both. It was my birthday and the waitress brought out a pretty big slice of cheesecake which had a strawberry jam like sauce on the side which was so delicious! Overall for it being my first time there it was great. Glad to see a place like this right around the corner from my house. Definitely will be back for more of that KFC"}
{"text":"Limited menu?  I'm a fan.  Do a few things and do them well.  But finding out, after seating, that two of those items aren't available?  That feels like a bait and switch.  I'd consider coming back for the Korean fried chicken kimchi sandwich and the brie-baked croissant with pear but with small lunch serving coming out to more than 20$ each after taxes and tip might make me think twice.  Maybe these guys would be better off in Hamilton?  Toronto expectations and competition could be too steep."}
{"text":"Great food with a cozy atmosphere.   We were in on a Tuesday so it was a quiet evening but all the staff were friendly and chatted but not to the point where they were interrupting our meal.  There is a genuine neighbourhood feel to the place so we will be back soon."}
{"text":"Terrible service combined with an over the top attitude. Food was pretty good, but the staff were horrible and condescending."}
{"text":"Sunday brunch business meetings here are just perfect! I don't mind working Sundays at the best of times but this just heightens the experience that much more.  Killer menues and what a vibe. What a vibe!!!"}
