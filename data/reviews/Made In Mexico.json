{"text":"I give this restaurant 2 stars because of the poor service and general condition of the restaurant. The food was delicious but the experience is substandard. My party waited nearly 30 minutes just to get our drinks. We would have gotten up and left but the drinks came just as we were about to leave.   We were there for over two hours because the service was so slow. We sat for twenty minutes just waiting for our bill. The waiter was not attentive at all. It was not busy when we arrived so that shouldn't be a reason.  While the restaurant was tidy, our tables were sticky and the floor was greasy. It did not look very clean overall.   It was generally a below average restaurant experience. Unfortunately that happens more than it should these days but that's life.  I don't think I'll be going there again."}
{"text":"Good size portions! Not as good as when they were smaller. Service can be slow. Very greasy.  But great atmosphere. Just think they have grown too fast."}
{"text":"Good times at Made in Mexico. The size of the portions is well worth the price, and the fresh margaritas are worth a try, very tasty. All in all this is worth a try if you are in the mood for Mexican"}
{"text":"Was doing some shopping at the Upper Canada Mall on a Sunday with the BF. Used yelp to find a place to eat nearby since we weren't familiar with the area. Made in Mexico was one of the first places that popped up in the search. It looked like it had decent reviews, so decide to give it a try.  Got there around 6:30pm and the place was not even half full. We were seated right away at one of the (slightly unusual) high tables near the bar area and given 2 long large single sheet, double sided menus. One for drinks, one for food. The BF asked our waiter what he recommended, which were the burritos (he claimed it was massive) and the fish tacos. BF decided to take the waiter's recommendation and got the Chicken Burrito ($12.95), while I decided to get the Enchilada Lover's ($13.95). We waited about 15 mins, and just as the BF was starting to wonder if the food was taking a while to come out, like they read our minds our food showed up. Our waiter asked us if we wanted any hot sauce, we said yes, so he came back with 2 small containers of their homemade sauce, a Jalapenos and a Habanero.   Both our dishes came with 2 sides, since there were 5 sides to choose from, we got 4 different ones (Lime and Cilantro Rice, Mexican Rice, Refried Beans, and Frijoles Charros) so we could try a bit of each. The Chicken Burrito was big, but not exactly massive because I've seen bigger. It was stuffed with chicken and onion, refried beans, and mexican rice, but I would say mostly rice. My Enchilada Lover's came filled with chicken and topped with 4 different sauces (Salsa Roja, Salsa Verde, Salsa Poblana, and Mole), one on each. We both found our dishes a little bland, especially the burrito, and relied a lot on the hot sauce to give it flavour. The Enchilada was slightly better, due to the salsas and mole on top. I liked the Mole and the Salsa Verde better than the other two. Of the sides, I liked the Frijoles Charros, which is a bean soup, the most. The Mexican Rice was more flavourful then the Lime and Cilantro Rice, but it had frozen veggies in it, which I'm not a fan of. The lime wedge that came with the Lime and Cilantro Rice was dry and barely any juice came out of it when I wanted to add more lime flavor to the rice.         Portion sizes were average for the cost. We both found the chicken bland, like it wasn't seasoned at all. Didn't try the other meats, so don't know if those are better. I found it slightly weird we were the only ones seated at the high tables instead of with the other diners in the more traditional dinning area, because the wait staff would come over to the tables beside us and eat and chat with each other which was slightly awkward. But it might have been a good thing we weren't seated with the other diners either. While we were there, the wait staff came out 4 times with music and sombreros, shaking what sounds like maracas, and shouting \"chug\", which would have got on my nerves very quickly. I think this might be a better drinks place than maybe a food place. The drinks menu was as big as the food menu."}
{"text":"Like the burrito itself you're bound to be stuffed after leaving Made in Mexico. Pros: Good atmosphere. Good food. Great for a birthdays.  Cons: Service has been inconsistent. Some dishes can be a tad salty but everyone's tastebuds are different so take it with a grain of salt...lol."}
{"text":"This was the most underwhelming dining experience ever Let's start with the Mexican rice ( instant rice mixed with tomato soup and frozen veggies) no flavor at all. Chicken tacos tasted like canned tuna very rubbery. The jalapeño poppers although very big were not fully cooked and again no seasoning this tastes nothing like Mexican food at all will never go back bitterly disappointed"}
{"text":"I went here for my anniversary with my boyfriend, and we really enjoyed our meal! The atmosphere is very welcoming and the staff were kind. Make sure you go when you're hungry because their portions are on the larger side (a plus for me!) I'll definitely be returning."}
{"text":"What better way is there to kickoff the weekend than a trip to Made in Mexico, Newmarket.  Since it was a Friday night, I knew there'll be a wait.  Arriving at 6pm I thought I'll beat the rush but nope, still a 40 minute wait.  The place was packed already, even the bar had no seats.  Regardless, we waited and knew it was the right place to be on a Friday night.  Jammin' with loud Mexican music, feelin' the whole restaurant was like one big party, and a friggin' awesome Mango Margarita Bulldog.  To start, we ordered their Chip & Dip (Pico de Gallo).  The chips, were OH-EM-GEE.  You're probably asking how special can chips be?  MAde in house, REAL corn chips, that taste like corn--none of that flour tortilla chips in a bag deal.  Their pico de gallo was nice and fresh, but nothing special on my palates.  Next up, Chicken Chimichanga, a big fat burrito stuffed with shredded chicken, beans, rice and a cheese sauce, deep fried then smothered in sour cream and more cheese.  This was heavenly good.  Not greasy at all and perfect balance of flavours.  Served with a side of Cilantro Lime Rice and Frijole Charros soup--homemade white bean soup.  The soup was nice and hearty, filled with lots of spices, it was just totally ROCKIN'.  Last but not least Steak Fajita.  Tender beef seared up with onions, peppers and cheese served with 6 corn tortillas.  Authentic corn tortillas with tender beef equals an explosion in your mouth!  The real deal here, just like what you'll get down south.  Only half the Chimichanga and half the fajita was finished, so stuffed that I couldn't even order the Chocoflan (which I REALLY wanted to try).  There were a couple of birthday celebrations happening while we were there.  LOUDER music, HUGE sombreros for the party and all the staff join in to sing a mexican song.  It was a lot of fun to watch.  Definitely a MUST TRY but if you want to make reservations, do so 1-2 weeks in advance as they only have limited # of tables purposely for RVSPers.  LUCKILY, their opening up a BIGGER location just across the street and it'll be ready by mid/end of April.    All WOWS and only 4 star you ask?  Our server was lacking a little, not too friendly and didn't really provide top-notch service.  Still won't stop me from going back!"}
{"text":"I had been here a few times. The first time was when they first opened on the west side of the street and that was a total fail and swore never to return. My second visit was last fall. It was a super fantastic experience.   I went with a group of girlfriends and we had a great time. Food = great, service= great, atmosphere = loud/fun authentic = great My visit last night was mediocre.   The nachos pancho villa were greasy and not a favourite with my crew. I ordered pork carnitas quesadilla and I enjoyed the authentic if a little greasy meal.  The rest of my family were all more than a little disappointed in their meals. Perhaps this restaurant needs to be a little more consistent,  or it may be true that the company you keep influences your experiences."}
{"text":"Place is packed, even during a snowstorm...but not worth it  Went a few weekends ago. I was amazed at how busy it was, especially given the huge snowstorm.  Huge menu with tons of selection; maybe even too overwhelming. The margaritas and sangria were much too sweet. Couldn't finish them. I ordered the fish tacos; I've had much better but they were OK and did the trick since I was hungry. We had ordered some appies like guac and some other items I can't remember...they didn't look appealing to me at all.  Service is super fast. Located on the main strip in downtown Newmarket.  I am spoiled with places like La Carnita or Playa Cabana...so I will take a pass on returning to Made in Mexico."}
{"text":"Went here last week with friends - the food is so fresh and tasty! Large portions which is great, friendly staff, nice atmosphere. Everything on the menu from what I've seen (both from what I ordered and what friends ordered) look fabulous. Can't lose no matter what you choose!"}
{"text":"TL;DR: Not the place for authentic Mexican food.  If you're in Newmarket looking for authentic Mexican food, I would look elsewhere. We saw that it was endorsed by \"You Gotta Eat Here\" and thought we'd check it out. When we pulled up to the restaurant the sign covering up half the window confirmed that yes, it was indeed featured on TV.  My main complaint is that the food just did not strike me as overly authentic. It reminded me of an Appleby's take on Mexican food. Huge portions, everything covered in cheese and sour cream, margaritas with no bite whatsoever... just a big miss, in my opinion.  Service was inconsistent, and the ambiance was rather Canadian for a \"Mexican Cantina\". The birthday celebrations (of which there were two in our limited visit) were punctuated with a loud, distorted version of what I can only imagine is a Mexican birthday song.  In short: I'd spend your pesos elsewhere, amigo."}
{"text":"Great place all around. Super fantastic wait staff. Love it there. Honestly can't think of anything negative!"}
{"text":"Great food, excellent customer service and an awesome atmosphere. The portions are enormous. This place is very well-run. They make you feel at home each and every time. This has become our go to place for Mexican food.   Don't forget your wheelchair or wheelbarrow to assist you getting back to your car after eating here. You will definitely be satisfied."}
{"text":"This is my favourite mexican restaurant so far. I woulda never thought Newmarket could boast such authentic mexican food, but its true. The food is amazing, the margaritas are awesome according to my girlfriend, and the place is always packed. Highly recommended.  I ordered the flautas with mexican rice, and wow was I glad I ordered that. My taste buds exploded with excitement. I've never tasted mexican food like this, and I've had my fair share of mexican food, trust me. The bean soup was very tasty as well. Fresh ingredients, made to order, and it's consistently good."}
{"text":"I had the fish tacos which I did not like at all. They had a different taste than most I've had. Maybe it was just an off-day for them because the service took nearly an hour to get our meal. The chips and guacamole was great, but the meal was disappointing and just painfully slow"}
{"text":"Had lunch here today. The large restaurant was less than half full and service was good. We had the chimichanga with pork carnitas, shrimp taco and a plato crujiente. The chimichanga and taco were delicious;  tender, tasty pork and nicely battered shrimp, muy bien! The plato crujiente wasn't as good in comparison, just not feeling the soft chicken filling.   Each dish came with two sides. We picked the soup and Mexican rice, both yummy!  We also had chips with pica de gallo and the waitress refilled the salsa and chips once but we weren't charged for the refills. I guess it's free refills? :) It wasn't stated on the menu.   For drinks, we ordered a frozen cucumber margarita. It was not bad, refreshing.  The bill came up to $55 before tax. It's on the pricey side but we will come back to try other food items."}
{"text":"yaaaaaaah finally a real mexican food joint!   me and my husband are two happy campers coming here last night.   our eyes both lit up when we saw Tortilla Soup on the menu. We are suckers for REAL tortilla soup. So when it came... we practically had tears in our eyes, it was so delicious. We each had our own bowl,  kinda wish I had one now but I digress.  Next we shared the mandatory guac and chips - yum yum yum.  So here is where I hit my wall. I thought I came hungry enough but looking around the portions are so huge I knew I would never be able to finish an entree on my own. So, my husband ordered the pulled pork chimichanga with a side of bean soup and refried beans. Adding the jalapeno sauce made that dish. Yum yum.  The only downfall of the night was the churros. When I think of churros I think of my mexican donut coated in sugar and cinnamon.  I found the churros to be lightly coated in sugar and it definitely needed more in my books to make the dish.  The atmosphere is loud and fun. We had a blast. The place is family owned and operated and to me that just makes it.   This place has moved to my number one in terms of Mexican joints... sorry Milagros."}
{"text":"Love this place. Service, atmosphere, FOOD, everything. Remember to make room for the those tasty churros!!"}
{"text":"The best Mexican food  I have had in awhile.  Its family owned,  they have a wide selection of food to order from and will modify it on your request. I have been there a million times and would recommend it to anyone looking to try  a new restaurant with friendly staff. And they also have a club that opens up on Thursday nights if you're interested as well. Nothing is raw or undercooked and they do their best to fix a problem when one arises.  Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Service was great, but somehow wasn't convinced by the quality of the food. All dishes seemed to be made of the same ingredients, had a similar taste, portions were absolutely huge and we ended up not eating most of our food. Quite sure I have eaten better mexican food elsewhere."}
{"text":"This restaurant is really a hidden gem! It's right on Main St in Newmarket. The minute you entered it felt as though you were in Mexico.  There was a great vibe of the restaurant being full and people enjoying themselves. Customer Service was A+!  Everyone was courteous and friendly.  I went with my husband and daughter. I was worried about my daughter being a toddler and perhaps not liking the food etc. Let me tell you she licked as did I! The food was out of the world. The portions were amazing and the price was unbeatable.   Back to the food! The quesedilla's melted in your mouth. And dessert.. OMG! order the churros.. ( i think i spelt it right) not sure..  Anyhow this place is very popular so you may have to wait for a table if you don't have reservations.  It's definetly worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Nice fantastic excellent, best in Ontario, cool people , love it and recommend to others ,"}
{"text":"Despite some of the reviews, trust me when I say this place is awful. If you have the slightest clue as to what authentic Mexican food is supposed to taste like than you won't enjoy this place. I think it survives due to a pretty good location on Main Street and the ignorance of the average consumer. Unfortunately the options are limited when it comes to Mexican food, but do not settle for this place."}
{"text":"Sadly Made in Mexico did not live up to my expectations at all. My bf and I came in on a Monday night (normally they are not open on Mondays but they were for 2 weeks for the holidays). We were the only other people there, which is fine. Our waitress was very sweet, friendly and funny and she was definitely a highlight of my experience there. The menu looked amazing, great prices and I couldn't choose between all the tasty options available. The drink menu was also great. I decided to mix and match the tacos (carne asada, pork carnitas, shredded chicken, and rajas con crema) which came with 4 and 2 sides for $12.95 and my boyfriend got the enchilada lovers platter, which also came with 2 sides, for $13.95. We both got the refried beans and salad as sides.   Our food came pretty quickly, but I was immediately dissappointed with mine. The presentation was bland, the tacos were soggy, and had a tiny helping of meat in each, without taco sauce or cilantro like the menu said it would come with. The refried beans were, in my opinion, too chunky and dry but that's just my taste. Plus, the food was barely even warm. I would never have brought out food like that to paying customers. The tacos fell apart in my hand trying to eat it, and the meat turned out to be super bland and dry as well. I have to say I really did not enjoy my meal at all. My boyfriends food looked much better in terms of its presentation but I can't say how he felt about the taste. The redeeming part of our meal were the churros which were warm and delicious, with a sticky and sweet caramel sauce.  I will not be coming back to Made in Mexico. I really expected more considering how well known this place is. The only reason I can think of that our meal was such low quality is that we came near the end of kitchen closing, so we may have gotten the bottom of the barrel for the food and the kitchen staff may have half-assed it... either way, sadly not a great experience."}
{"text":"The bulldogs are good but the food is very bland and flavorless...the service can be awesome but if the food sucks it doesn't really matter....right???"}
{"text":"I took my parents here during their visit from out of town after reading positive reviews on Yelp. The evening turned out to be a big disappointment. The food was bland, greasy, and very inauthentic. Servers were friendly but not well informed about the menu. Save your money and drive an extra 10 minutes to La Mexicanada in Bradford instead!"}
{"text":"I ordered a burrito from made in Mexico as part of #ordertheyelp. It came with a generously sized burrito and two sides, which I opted for bean soup and Mexican rice, a tomato fried rice.  The yelpuritto had lime and cilantro rice with Cajun chicken, refried beans, tomato, corn, and a cheese and sweet potato sauce, The burrito was meh, as the flavour was subtle and mostly of tomato and cheese. The burrito was then topped with hot sauces, making it hard to hold and consume.  The two sides were fairly good, I enjoyed the bean soup a lot and those I shared the combo with also really liked it. The flavour was rich and flavourful, without being too bean-y. There were many pieces of beans and meat in the soup as well. The Mexican rice, on the other hand, somewhat lacked in flavour. It mostly tasted like plain rice with some veggies, and no tomato.   Service: Service was another issue when I went. I ordered my combo and they told me to wait at the bar. I waited for a long time until I asked how much longer the food would take. A server had told me two minutes, but it turned out to be thirty! All of this was happening as I watched servers chat on their phones."}
{"text":"Clean, spacious and fresh tasting. Great for birthday celebrations (just let them know ahead of time). Portions are fair, and so is the pricing."}
{"text":"Fabulous service tonight. It's nice going some place as service oriented where the staff seem to really care and enjoy their jobs. Enchiladas were excellent.The ice cream Sunday for my daughter was an especially nice treat! Thanks for a great dinner!"}
{"text":"We love this place! Always a fun atmosphere, lots of great drinks, and a huge menu. Never had a bad meal there. Sometimes it can get really busy on popular summer nights though."}
{"text":"I have to wonder if the reviewer Johnny H (from a few posts ago) has ever been to a Latin American restaurant that is not trying to be pretentious. What exactly did you expect? This restaurant is loved by Newmarket and beyond because of the atmosphere and personality that the servers offer. This will come with some more volume and the feeling that your server is relaxed enough to chat with you and explain aspects of the menu. If you would like to visit a restaurant where the servers are expected to get you in and out as quickly as possible and treat you accordingly, please visit one of the many large chain places we have in town or a fast food joint. What you'll find at Made in Mexico is a genuinely friendly family restaurant that will offer what other restaurants in the area don't in terms of the massive and delicious dishes and the lengths they will go to in order to make you feel at home with them (yes, this includes singing for an individual's birthday, and most human beings consider this fun.)  It would appear that this person went to Made in Mexico with the intention of finding things wrong instead of taking it in for what it is, and when you read the other reviews on here or on Trip Adviser, you'll see why everyone else loves it here and will return whenever they want an exceptional dinner with family and friends.   Also, Fernando works very hard and is one of our favourite servers. With him we feel that we're being helped by someone genuine who wants us to feel welcome and happy."}
{"text":"I went here back when they very first opened many years ago and I had a great experience. But since they moved to the larger restaurant on Main Street, I haven't had good experiences at Made in Mexico. I've gone multiple times and each time it was slow service, the food wasn't as good as it was before, and each time part of the order was wrong.   It does have a great patio, but if you want really excellent Mexican food, I would suggest going to La MexiCanada in Bradford."}
{"text":"Great place to eat, nice hip decor & atmosphere . Really enjoyed the one in Newmarket and this location has the same tasting food. It's a hidden gem and worth trying . Portions are massive!"}
{"text":"Fun, loud, great food and service. Good value for the money and enjoyed the fact that it was close to home."}
{"text":"The waitress was nice and friendly, cool decoration and music but their food was bellow avarage. I heard great things about their food but it wasn't what I expected."}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday night. Waited less than 5 mins without a reservation for 2.   The food was very good. We had nachos + burritos + fish taco. The portions were VERY large. We ended up taking half of everything home.   Only complaint is that it took longer than average for food to come (e.g. more than 30-40 mins). This seemed to be common amongst all the tables. However, we weren't very bothered by it as the environment was quite enjoyable."}
{"text":"I live around the corner from this fabulous place and we find our selves regularly going back for more! My partner always gets the Chicken Chimichanga, while I mix it up with what ever I am feeling like that day, and I cannot say I remember a time that I have been disappointed.  However, for those planning on going on a Friday, Saturday or Sunday night, be sure to call ahead as reserved tables take effect at 6pm and you might not get seated if you don't plan ahead.  My recommendation: Try a Bull Dog and the Burrito's!"}
{"text":"This is a fun casual place with no real surprises menu wise just really good Mexican food well prepared at very fair prices."}
{"text":"I would eat here every meal if I could! Delicious food, attentive servers and an amazing atmosphere.   Love the pork tacos!"}
{"text":"The food tasted ok, it just didn't taste \"Mexican\". We had the Enchiladas and QUesadillas....sorry but they didn't taste like Mexican food, not sure what it tasted like. I've had \"real\" Mexican food before and this is not it unless they'er cooking recipes from some obscure part of Mexico. It's also VERY noisy. You can hardly have a conversation at dinner. A friend just told me she went and her comments about the food were the same. No, I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"While visiting my brother up in Bradford, we visited this restaurant and was pleasantly surprised.  Who would have thought a little Mexican restaurant would be this decent.  Place was busy enough, staff were super friendly and the whole feel of the restaurant was relaxing. We ordered lots of tacos for the table and enjoyed most of it.....especially anything containing pork, nice spices. If you somehow ended up in Bradford( you're probably lost) and you are hungry check this place out."}
{"text":"Really great, very authentic!  The tacos and enchiladas are amazing (real corn soft tacos)!  Portions are huge and the drinks are cheap!"}
{"text":"Dislike this place. Flavourless in my opinion. I have given it many chances and have been disappointed."}
{"text":"Amazing place to get Mexican food!  Homemade tortillas and chips for the guacamole are my favourite.   The atmosphere is loud and noisy so don't go here looking for a small romantic dinner. Overall a really fun place to have a good meal and drinks!"}
{"text":"I dream about Made in Mexico's Pico de Gallo. Not even kidding.  Delicious food and great atmosphere. I recommend the Charro soup, Tostadas, refried beans, and their fresh chips.   Always busy, service has gotten better but it can be a little slow during steady periods, which is understandable. I find when I order extra sauce they normally forget.. love the jalapeño hot sauce, I add a little to my soup.   Only ever disappointed with the fish tacos, they tend to lack flavour.  Otherwise I highly recommend for a night out, lunch, or take out!"}
{"text":"Tasteless, overrated. Granted portions are big, but they food is bland and doesn't do justice to Mexican food. Server kept messing our orders and service was really slow. We were so excited to dine in but were disappointed"}
{"text":"Not a good experience, not sure if it was just me but food lacked taste. Everything was just so extremely bland."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I decided to go for a dinner on a Thursday night around 8:30pm. We wanted a late night dinner and heard it was busy, thinking later was better we went then! We waited for an hour, from the time we got in the door till we were seated. While we waited we only had room to stand, slightly annoying. The atmosphere was loud but exciting and fun.     The service was amazing, every employee we saw gave us a smile! The bartender chatted us up even though he was swamped with work!      The food was amazing, I'm vegetarian and I had many options for food. The portion sizes are huge but they are amazing! My boyfriend and I shared churro's and they were delicious!      We will be returning again, but we will make reservations next time!"}
{"text":"Really great restaurant with great food and a really welcoming atmosphere!  Full disclosure, I'm a huge fan of Latin American cuisine; so they had my attention just by opening the door.  I've visited a lot in the last few years and each time I make it a point of trying something new; I've never been disappointed.  I'd recommend that those who visit be adventurous, there's really nothing on their menu that I can think would offend any taste buds, though you may want to make choices based on personal preferences for types of meats and levels of cheese. :)  The atmosphere is usually quite loud, not only for the open concept full of diners but also as a result of the ever present birthday serenades.  The volume has bothered some people I've eaten with, but I find it's about expectation more than discomfort.  Don't go here expecting a quietly romantic meal with your first date; go here with friends and enjoy the feast-like party going on around you!  If you are looking for a quieter pace, the lunch-time crowd seems to be more reserved and less celebratory; so you might enjoy some mid-day flautas in relative silence; but you're missing half the fun!  Depending on how adventurous your kids are for eaters it's a great place to take them for something new, though make sure you call ahead for a reservation as it can get quite busy!"}
{"text":"Outstanding authentic food. Friendly service.   Make reservations, this place gets packed."}
{"text":"The chicken burrito was really big but wasn't so good,I did not like it at all it was very heavy. Th service wasn't the best and the worst part is that their wasn't a lot of people around so every time I tried to ask for the many to order dessert out waiter would walk buy us the only good thing was the taco salad and the bowl mad out of the chips I highly recommend that if ordering the the taco salad and you don't want chicken on it that you tell them I learned that the hard way. The music was very loud I could barley hear the waiter never mind the person I was dining with. Finally before we asked for the check I just thought to get some churros to turn this night around before I left but the waiter said that they were out of dessert which I thought how is that possible so I left. Overall I did not like the place and would not visit there for anything but the chips they were delicious."}
{"text":"Who doesn't love a good flavourful Mexican dish once in a while? I know if I have to make a quick dinner it's always something easy like tacos or fajitas.  The best part is, for singles like me, the leftovers are just as good.   Mexican food was always a quick fix to me; there is not much to it and it's inexpensive to make. But there is a whole side of Mexican food I was completely oblivious to before my experience at Made In Mexico.   First of all, going on a Friday night, meant about a 20 minute wait but we were determined to try this place. It's like the coolest place in Newmarket!  From the outside it seems like just a regular diner, but once you get inside it has a completely different atmosphere. I was amazed it has a Mexican-theme without being tacky. We all know most places that serve this type of food over-do decorations, including but not limited to; plastic palm trees, drink umbrellas, patio lanterns and sombreros...really!?   One of the best things I witnessed was that most people in the restaurant were drinking frozen mixed drinks. Even the dudes! Gotta be honest, I was impressed. If you ordered something other than you were the minority.  So of course I landed on a mango daiquiri and the BF got a blue margarita.   As for ordering it took me a while to decide.  I was torn between so many things. The menu had a great variety without being too extensive. Finally we decided on the steak burrito and the fish tacos with a side of Mexican-style rice and re-fried beans.  I was amazed by the amount of food. We split both of the meals, as always, and it was so much that I didn't finish. For me, that's crazy! Like I said before, if it's in front of me, I'll eat it.   The fish tacos were amazing. I've had them elsewhere but these fish tacos definitely take the cake.  The fish was not overly battered, it was crispy and light, and for once they came with more fish than taco shell.  They came with coleslaw inside that had a Mexican-flare and the refried beans were not pasty. The burrito was packed full of meat. I can say I have never seen a burrito this size.  The steak was cooked well, with nice spice and had the texture of pulled pork.   I can honestly say that I think about these fish tacos daily. I cannot wait until I can go back, cause I'm gonna order the same thing.   Promise me that you will skip Taco Bell, taco kits and the \"Mexican-food\" isle at the grocery store and just head to Made In Mexico instead. It's like a mini vacation, but cheaper and with way better food.   Enjoy!"}
{"text":"We really enjoyed our meals at Made in Mexico. Their salsas are good, with something for every heat tolerance. The fish tacos were light and tasty, the pork carnitas a juicy, porky goodness. Sure it's not \"authentic\" but most towns outside of Mexico can't handle authentic Mexican. (Our only real Mexican place lasted six months. The \"Mexican-inspired\" place now has branches and a food truck...go figure.) The staff were great and they put up a big screen for the soccer game. Yay!  Would I go back? Sure. It's a nice change from all the Asian options."}
{"text":"The food is really tasty and authentic. The burritos here are hella good. Its a pretty sick restaurant"}
{"text":"This review is of a week day lunch.  First impression: walking up to the restaurant was negative. 2 of the cooks/chefs were outside smoking and we had to walk between them to get to the door. A little unappetizing.   Venue: The restaurant itself is very nice inside with a good size bar and huge dining space. I noticed they had many people working which seemed odd since they had maybe 6 tables of customers.   Service: Our server was a bit slow, mainly because he had to clear his own tables with no help from any of the others. He was very pleasant and attentive.   Food: The food was not great. I'm not sure what people are raving about. I found it bland and  greasy. Living in Southern California I am spoiled with many amazing Mexican restaurants. This place just seems like a missed opportunity.   Overall: What really killed the experience for me was the unprofessional nature of the staff. They came off as a bunch of high school dropouts lingering around and not doing anything. Walking back and forth out of the kitchen, chatting loudly amongst themselves. Most of them not helping customers and all of them not cleaning. Behavior like this will bury this place."}
{"text":"I have been to this location around 10 times over the past 3 years and have finally decided to boycott this restaurant for a while. In Newmarket, there's only a limited number of cool restaurant you can take big groups, and made in Mexico is one of them.  I found that with large groups it is easier to preorder if you are under a tight time crunch like over a work lunch, but it can be a hit or miss depending on the day of the week. Our mistake, was showing up with a large group on taco Tuesday. Many of our group did not even get their order over an hour after being seated. The other half of the group was already finished eating and paid for...awkward!  Their food is delicious, there's no denying that, but service is extremely slow even if you are not part of a large group.  I love their bean soup (frijoles charros) and their margaritas are extremely worth it for the portion. I also enjoy having a birthday here and you get a song, tequila sunrise shot, and get to wear the embarrassing sombrero! I also like how they have the patio and open windows in the summer.  Made in Mexico, I enjoy you but your messy fiesta of a management style is what makes me not want to return."}
{"text":"I had a much higher expectation of this place because it was recommended to me by a friend. Although the place was not bad, I just didn't think it was worth the price. P.s. Some of their seats are really high, short people like me will have some trouble trying to get up to your table, haha."}
{"text":"Food is good. Not as authentic as you can find in the city but more authentic than anything you'd ever find in Newmarket, that's for sure. Wish they had spicier sauces. Whenever I asked for hot sauces they are only medium level spicy."}
{"text":"Orale!!  It's finally happened, the hottest Mexican spot around has made the move to a brand new location. I had the honor of being invited to their private opening last week to get a sneak peak and let me tell you, just when you thought they couldn't get any better.... they did  One of the best changes with the move is space, way more space. The bar is bigger, the dining room now has almost triple the amount of seating than the old location, the kitchen is bigger (yes I got a chance to step into the place where the magic happens) and their staff appears to be bigger as well.   With the growing popularity of this \"You Gotta Eat Here\" featured restaurant, they've met the overwhelming demand and grown themselves!  I had the pleasure of sampling an assortment if items I had yet to try including: Cheese Empanadas, Burritos, Taquitos, and Chalupas. All excellent, made fresh and totally to die for!  They also were sampling their sangria and their famous margaritas and while margarita remained as excellente as ever, the sangria was new to me and delicious!  They've also got their famous churros cooking up and piled high (I obviously had 2-3 of these) and JUST when I thought I couldn't stuff another morsel in my already distended belly, a server brought around a new addition to their dessert menu...  CHEESE. CAKE. CHIMMICHANGA.   I took a bite of one out of sheer curiosity and the deep fried, cinnamon sugar rolled, chocolate drizzled bad buy sent a flavour chill down my spine like, instantly giving me goose bumps. This new addition to the Made In Mexico family is a MUST TRY!  What's next for the folks here? Come June, they'll be opening a new Tequila Cantina and Salsa/Dance bar on the level below with a HUGE patio space for you to sip sangria in the sun all summer long.  Arriiiibbbbbbaaaaaaaa!!!  Eatcrest OUT!"}
{"text":"Fun place, food is reasonable and good.  I've been a few times."}
{"text":"Overall incredible value, I have not had a bad item on the menu and have visited close to a dozen times. The staff is friendly, it's family owned and they make some seriously delicious hot sauces from scratch. It's a privilege to eat here."}
{"text":"Service is good, ambiance is ok. Food is also ok, but not great Mexican. Guac portions are not large, tableside or fantastic. Keep searching if your looking for amazing Mexican"}
{"text":"Great food at amazing prices. I will say if you want to go on a Friday or Saturday night make a reservation as it is packed."}
{"text":"Heard many great things about Made in Mexico so it was time to see for ourselves.  The restaurant is on the main street in Newmarket with lots of free parking in the back for all the businesses along the street.  Service was very friendly and efficient.  I had the veggie tacos with mushroom filling and refried beans and salad on the side.  I loved the mushroom filling but unfortunately it made my tacos too soggy and they fell apart.  I was a bit disappointed having to eat them with fork and knife.  Maybe using two tortillas would help.  The refried beans were different from what I've had before, lighter in colour and texture.  I think I prefer them this way.  The green salad was very fresh and crispy.  Though not extraordinary it made a nice accompaniment.  Habanero salsa was not as hot as I expected but still had a good kick.  Though I preferred the jalapeno, less spice but more flavour.  I liked the cafe de olla very much though it could have been hotter.  They also had a good selection of Jarritos.  Can't wait to come back to try other menu items."}
{"text":"WoW... portions are insanely large! Talk about getting your money's worth. Needed to move to the next notch on my belt.     Frist the GOOD:  - Fast and friendly service.  - Excellent prices. Main courses priced between $10 - $14.   - Feel like a cool refreshing drink? - try the huge Margarita's. The Mango was really good.  - Lot's of Tequila options if your adventurous. A previous bad experience keeps me away from this deadly option.     - Excellent homemade Guacamole.   - Chicken Chimichanga's were amazing and a easily provide a second meal the next day.  - I'm in love with the re fried beans - stupid good.     - Lot's of parking in the back of the restaurant.   and the NOT so GOOD:  - The steak fajitas were a little disappointing. The steak was a dry and well done. Also covered with melted cheese which is OK with me but be aware if your not a cheese fan.  - Unless your in the area, I'm not sure It's worth the trip up north but certainly give it a try when your in the area. (Full disclosure - Mexican food is not my favourite).  - I image this place being fun in the evenings given the wide variety of alcohol selections but how the hell do you get home?????????? Anyone want to be my designated driver :) ?    PS.... World's best butter tarts a few doors away at \"The Maids Cottage\".  BK"}
{"text":"The Mexican food here taste awesome. The smell, people and the look Mexican. GREAT customer service. I would totally recommend this place to friends and family. Great place to go with family or friends. The food ain't to expensive or to cheap."}
{"text":"Not a fan of this establishment. This place does not feel like an authentic Mexican restaurant/cantina. The drinks were mediocre at best, but the worst was the atmosphere. We had originally planned to have dinner, but the obnoxious fanfare of every birthday celebration was too much. If you are looking for the epitome of an unsatisfactory chain restaurant experience, be their guest, especially if it's your birthday.  I'm surprised at the overwhelming reviews that lead us here in the first place. I can only surmise there aren't very many authentic Mexican places in the area which doesn't allow for much competition.   I'll gladly stay in Toronto for my taco fix. Live and learn."}
{"text":"Tasty food but salty. I wish they would serve chips. Friendly staff and great music and atmosphere.  Will go back just once again hoping that they read this review.  It has some authentic dishes but seems more tex-mex mainstream.;"}
{"text":"After moving to Newmarket and hearing about this place,  I decided to check it out.  Sorry to say I was thoroughly let down by the quality of the food.  Servers were polite but everything we tried was average at best.  Too bad :("}
{"text":"One of my favourite places to eat in Newmarket!  The food is tasty and the service is excellent.  Having never been to Mexico, I cannot comment about authenticity, however it is delicious food.  The nachos (which I realize are not genuine Mexican cuisine) are very good.  The house made tortilla chips are among the best I've had anywhere and don't forget the housemade hot sauce.  The fish tacos/burritos and shrimp tacos/burritos are my favorites, but I just wish the fish and shrimp weren't fried.  Don't forget to try a bulldog (margarita with beer) either!  I cannot wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I am beyond flabbergasted that there is only ONE review for this place.  Well I am happy to be second - listen up Newmarketers - this mexican resturant is amazing.   The atmosphere is wonderful, the size, location and people make it always an enjoyable experience.   The food is amazing! Mexican food is my favorite - and sometimes I travel straight from the city to visit my family and beg that we go here, it is great for date night, girls night, dudes night out and for families.   My yelp tip - call ahead and make a reservation - it is your typical burb restaurant that  gets slammed at 6PM"}
{"text":"I firmly believe five stars should be special and not given away whimsically. Today, the kitchen and wait staff deserve all the glory I can yelp.    Last week we had a going away lunch for a colleague and had reservations for a large group of about 30 people.  Unbeknownst to us, a second group of about twenty people arrived within about ten minutes of us.    This is where the staff truly shined that day.  Our drink and food orders were attentively taken with care and perfection.  Although as it was a work event, waters and fountain drinks were the flavour,  they were promptly delivered to our tables and food orders taken.  Again, and I am not sure what Mexican magic was happening the kitchen, however, our meals all came out in short order, all at the same time (within reason), and all looking hot and fresh. This streak continued with the second table across the restaurant.  Ok, I admit, it's Mexican, we are not making gourmet, however, still above and beyond when your groups hit that party status!  Moral of the story: reservations allow management teams to staff accordingly - and that they must have.   If anyone asks, YES, Made in Mexico is the perfect place for large groups!"}
{"text":"One of the better authentic Mexican food in GTA/New Market (sorry for the great geographical coverage). When my friends and I went to the restaurant, it was packed! As a result, we had to wait for quite some time at the bar before getting seated. At the bar, they serve all kinds of specific latin/spanish drinks such as margarita, bulldog (flavoured margarita with corona) etc.   Servers are very nice and they sing Happy Birthday (in spanish) with the entire crew. To add into the atmosphere, they even bring the birthday boy/girl a giant sombrero.   The selection food is enormous. Selection ranges from tacos, to nachos; from alambres to enchiladas. My friends ordered fried tortilla chip with guacamole dip. The tortilla chip is not my favourite but the guacamole dip is very tasty. Usually Mexican restaurants don't give you much guacamole dip, but Made in Mexico gave us full bowl of the dipping sauce. I ordered alambres with steak. As you can see from the photo, it is basically grilled beef with bacon, salsa, avocado on a tortilla bread. By ordering the alambres, customers can also choose two side dishes. I chose Mexican rice and Mexican soup (both are quite salty).  One of my biggest comment of Made in Mexico is that there is too much food. The money you pay for the dish is definitely worth the value since there is a lot of food. However, if you don't plan on eating much, please do not order an appetizer as your main dish is sufficient enough."}
{"text":"ordered fish taco and a pork carnitas burrito, big portions, juciy and fresh.  I was never a big fan of lime with seafood, but this place made me start loving the combination.  I'm expecting for the next visit here"}
{"text":"This place was amazing! The food so flavourful and fresh. The portions are ample. The atmosphere makes you feel like you're on vacation in Mexico. Love this place. Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is cause they have a pothole right at the entrance of their restaurant and I nearly twisted my ankle badly. Please fix that - so dangerous."}
{"text":"First of all, their environment,guacamole&chips and green hot sauce deserve 5 stars. But why they end up with 3 stars? First of all, speed. There were only 3 of us and the restaurants were not that busy at all but we waited at least 40 minutes between our appetizer and the entree. I ordered a fried taco roll with steak, honestly I loved the sides, the tortilla soup and the cilantro rice, but the main dish is just, deep fried dough with stuffed beef. It was just, not worth the price. The portion size is great tho, but their menu needs a redesign because reading it hurts my eyes."}
{"text":"This was probably one of the worst restaurants I have ever been too. First the waiter is very sarcastic and rude , second the food was just terrible bland no flavour and just utterly unpleasant to look at, the waiter was incredibly rude demanding for us to our food faster, she said that she loves to eat the empanadas and saying that she loves the chicken however she then comes back out and says that she is a vegetarian !"}
{"text":"Checked this place out because it was on the Food Network's \"You Gotta Eat Here\".   Ordered a burrito and my wife got a quesidilla. The service wasn't too bad, and I didn't expect too much since we were there on Saturday night. It was pretty busy and there were lots of people in big crowds. One thing I didn't like was that the seating was quite snug, lots of tables and chairs fairly close together. I think this place is pretty good but I wouldn't go out of my way to come here. If you're in Newmarket this is a pretty good place to go, prices aren't bad, portions are large but there are lots of other options if you live anywhere closer to Toronto or even Richmond Hill/Markham area.   I would recommend this place if you're craving Mexican food and you're in Newmarket. If not, then it might not be worth the drive up."}
{"text":"Stopped in for the first time for dinner with friends and wow, were we amazed?!  Decor and ambiance feels very warm and authentic; menu is extensive with options for everyone; and service is friendly and prompt.  Food was delicious, so rich and flavourful and portions were huge!  We happily had leftovers for snacking later.  We're from Toronto, wished there was a local location for us.  Keep it up!"}
{"text":"The food was delightful. Service was quick and very friendly. The waiter was amazing and very friendly."}
{"text":"Took clients out for a night on the old town Newmarket and decided on Mexican at Made In Mexico, so disappointing! Service sucked and food was at best mediocre! Won't be back and judging by the empty tables I'm not alone!!"}
{"text":"Went here this past Sunday for a casual dinner.   I didn't have reservations but got a table for 4 in under 30 minutes.  Started with a fiesta platter.  The cheese and meet in the center was tasty but wish it was more melted.    I had scissors to cut it though since I was there with a child.  We also split some shrimp tacos that had great flavour but the soft taco shell was a bit soggy from the oil used on the shrimp.   My sides for this dish were the refried beans pretty good and the bean soup which was a bit salty for me.  Another dish we tried was a adobo chicken nachos.   The meat was good but wish there was a bit more.    The cheese hardened to fast so the nachos under the cheese didn't have much toppings.    For fun we grabbed a steak burrito as well.   We were being glutenous for this one but they looked so good as the servers were bringing them out to other tables.  We were already pretty full as the portions are quite large and dishes are filling.  The burrito did not disappoint.  This was delicious, packed full of flavour and it is massive.  Service at this place is very good.  Staff are very pleasant and have tons of suggestions and recommendations if you ask for their help in deciding.  Would definately go again if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Unacceptable behaviour from the manager. I understand that two people from our party were running late for the reservation - however 6 of us were present and ordered. Our friends came from Toronto and the manager came over took a table without asking away from our group to create a table for 4 and proceeded to tell us we had to \"respect the business\" and that our reservation of 8 was now cancelled because when people make appointments they need to respect it. Whag about respecting the customers? His attitude was beyond unacceptable and he gave us zero time to explain what was going on. There were also 2 empty tables of 4 beside us that were not seated and the table he turned into 4 were not seated for a good 20 minutes.  If it is busy and you want a good turnover rate with customers maybe you shouldn't have your customers wait 45 minutes for their entrees to come out? Instead of blaming the customers entirely for this? We heard that he was new - so maybe you should train your staff on how to handle and talk to customers?  Besides that the drinks came out fast and our server, Maria was wonderful and understanding.   The appetizers and drinks were really tasty. As for the entrees, I can't say because I'm still waiting for it.  *EDIT*  Got my food 55 minutes later - food was great! Server was great! Manager was horrible and food wait time was a bit ridiculous."}
{"text":"Great food and great service. They offer a great opportunity for large groups and families to enjoy a festive dinning experience."}
{"text":"Went here for my brothers birthday a while back. Everyone enjoyed themselves except me unfortunately. Let it be known it was not my choice in restaurant but that does not mean I should have a bad time.   I do not like tomatoes which is a death sentence at a Mexican restaurant because everything has them. I ordered some starter tacos as a meal and asked if they were fried and was told no and asked for them with no tomatoes. When they came they were in deep fried shells and covered in finely chopped tomatoes which were very hard to pick off.   Was very upset and didn't even want to eat them at that point (I REALLY HATE TOMATOES).   Ate 2.5/3 before I gave up.   Everyone else's dishes looked great and were huge in portion size. But at that point I was beyond saving. We got the churros for a small dessert and they were great! We almost ordered another round of them before we left, but most people were just too full.   Service was great but it was ridiculously loud inside the restaurant (the music was blaring and people were yelling to talk over it)."}
{"text":"Love the Raja sauce!  I get the Raja bean burrito every time.   Also great chips with quac."}
{"text":"Great Mexican food and an extensive drink menu (margaritas, mojitos, sangria, micheladas). The chips and guacamole were a big hit with our table. Service could have been a bit faster but they were pretty busy. I'd definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Made in Mexico is delicious. I went this week with some friends from work. We went around 1:30 on a Thursday. It wasn't extremely busy, but people were coming and going during our stay. It was a beautiful day and there was room on the patio, so we sat outside. Our server was great, giving us lots of time to order. Two of us ordered drinks, one a peach bulldog margarita and the other a lime mojito. Both very refreshing and delicious (their drinks are awesome!) For our meals, we ordered a chicken burrito, a ground beef chimichanga, and the enchilada/taco combination plate. We all ordered the tortilla soup as a side, a long with the mexican rice, lime & cilantro rice, and a garden salad. Everything was delicious and so fresh tasting. Honestly, I often get cravings for Mexican food and Made in Mexico is the best way to solve that craving. One of my favourite places to hit during the summer."}
{"text":"Great Mexican food in the heart of newmarket.  Typically a busy place but dont let that  discourage you.  Staff is friendly and foodmis very good!  Finally a mexican place worth going to thst is north of highway 7"}
{"text":"Not sure how this gem ended up in Newmarket.  With the limited quality Mexican restaurants around, it's worth the drive here.  Since they moved across the street, they have lost a bit of their flare, but the atmosphere and food is still top notch.  There's no patio in the front, but they open up the wall to wall windows, so we sat right by the sidewalk.  Ordered the margarita, which is made properly.  I got the large size which is huge.  This time I went for the queso with churizo appetizer.  It's served with fresh tortillas.  Very tasty, but filling for just two of us, I would not order it without at least four people.   All the tacos here are really good.  I got the fish tacos this time.  Severed on fresh tortillas with the slaw and lime on the side so you can decide how much to put on.  The fish is made fresh with a crispy batter.    This is a must for Mexican fans.  I only wish it was closer to home!"}
{"text":"My husband loves this place and since his frequent lunch visits he'd been wanting to take me. So we made the trip up there and put some happy food in our bellies.  Happy is an understatement for this place- its down right hysterical! The entire restaurant is decked out in signs and posters making it look like a cantina-esque comedy spot. The posters are hilarious....jokes about bar tenders and beer etc.  The bar is amazing. I had the lime frozen margarita with a Corona. (Its all one drink and if you've never had it- try it)  We waited to be seated and the barista was so sweet with my kids. The staff were friendly and happy. My kids enjoyed juice and chocolate milk while we waited.  We were seated and our waiter was awesome- chatted with us and made us feel like family. I must add- we've been to Mexico more than once and not too an over-americanized touristy place either....REAL MEXICO. I've had tacos pastor and empanadas de cazon on the street. Let me tell you- Made in Mexico is doing it all RIGHT!  Huge portions, AMAZE-BALLS food and exceptional service. I will go back again and again. My kids loved their quesadillas with side rice. That's right- my kids had a side of rice, not fries...cause that's how you do it in Mexico..lol   If you're into tex-mex: you won't be disappointed everything from Burritos, and fajitas to chimichangas (yeah thats tex..not real Mexican).  Come in, have a laugh (with a shot of tequila) and leave so full you had to unbuckle your belt."}
{"text":"Amazing, authentic mexican food. HUGE portions, very cheap--we came by for lunch recently and ordered two entrees, no appetizers or extra sides, and it was easily enough to feed four people for dinner, or five for lunch. Insane portion sizes. You can easily order one entree to feed two people. I love it! Food was absolutely amazing, came quickly, good service. Love this place!"}
{"text":"This place was ok. I had the pulled pork chimichangas, which was decent- maybe lacking in flavor slightly. My dining companions had the nachos which had a great amount of cheese on them, and the enchiladas which she found very dry. Good Mexican overall, good service and prices, nice ambiance."}
{"text":"Who would have thought I would have to go so far north to get a taste of the south!   Had a CMYE here last night, thanks to Kris U for finding such an awesome family run restaurant! We arrived to a buzzing restaurant on a Wednesday night, the restaurant itself was quite nice; dim lighting, clean modern look, and had enough Mexican décor without being too cheesy.   Started with a drink, the mango margarita was quite delicious, it was sweet without being overwhelming and had a good mango flavour (albeit was a little weak in terms of alcohol content). For appetizers the table shared a guacamole platter (nacho chips with 3 types of guacamole) and Queso Fundido (melted cheese with chorizo). Both were on point, the Queso Fundido was absolutely amazing, cheese was perfectly melted (not greasy at all) and the chorizo added a nice spice. The guacamole was divine, hands down the best guac I have ever had, the platter had 3 kinds (1 with pineapple and habaneros, 1 with pablano peppers and the last one was just a classic guacamole) the avocados were clearly very fresh and so creamy, this made for an excellent appetizer. Our server was also nice enough to give use 2 types of salsa (salsa verde and a habanero salsa), these were quite delicious and packed some serious heat, especially the habanero salsa.  For mains I had the steak burrito with bean soup and Mexican rice on the side as well as a chilorio tamale (pork). I have never had a tamale and this was a great introduction to the dish, the corn outside was so moist and tender and the pork inside was quite juicy, the tomato sauce on the side added a nice sweetness and freshness to the dish, I am now a fan of tamales! The burrito was MASSIVE, the tortilla was fresh and they did not skimp on the steak (the steak to rice ratio was 50-50, maybe even more steak than rice), the steak was juicy and had a nice flavour. The Mexican rice on the side was ok, I felt it was a bit dry but overall not bad. The real sleeper on my dish was the bean soup with bacon and sausage, absolutely mind blowing! The white beans were so tender and the bacon added a nice smoky dimension, this one is definitely a must try, next time I will get a big bowl.   For dessert we all shared some churros, hot out of the fryer these bad boys were ridiculous! So crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside, dipping it into the caramel sauce I was in heaven. The presentation on all the dishes was exquisite and prior to getting our food we were all oohing and awing at everything to come out of the kitchen.   The service was awesome, Fernando our waiter kept the mood light and did an unbelievable job describing the menu and making recommendations. His family owns the restaurant and it was clear he was passionate about the business. He did tell us that the service suffers a bit on weekends due to how busy they are so it is probably a good idea to hit this place on a weekday or make a reservation for the weekends. Made in Mexico you are mui bueno, I will be back!    * We were lucky enough to witness their birthday celebration which included Mexican music, sombreros for the table and a tequila shot for the birthday person, this was so entertaining!"}
{"text":"Good and fast lunch service. Food tastes alright and the quantity is good to keep you full until the dinner time.  I had a bean burrito which tasted good at $12.95 plus taxes. The restaurant is kept very clean and lots of seating area for your entertainment."}
{"text":"We found this little gem as a result of a \"foodie\" program on television.  They said it was awesome, and they were right! Very authentic in terms both of food, presentation and the restaurant itself.  The portions are huge, and the real corn tacos are amazing (and made in-house).  Service was great.   We live about 45 minutes from this place and our only regret is that we don't come here more often.  We will definitely be back! (Get there early, the line ups are insane)."}
{"text":"The first time I had he privilege of trying out Made In Mexico, it was their tortilla chips to-go with the side of pico de gallo. Probably the best I've ever had and I had been craving them since.   I returned a couple of months later with my boyfriend, whom I had been raving about this place to. It was pretty busy, so they quickly got us a seat to wait at the bar for maybe 5 minutes and then we got a nice seat near the front of the restaurant. The waitress was sweet, and took our order, my boyfriend getting the burrito (which is HUGE) and since I wasn't very hungry, I got the appetizer chips with pico de gallo and a sample of each hot sauces to try (a mild taco salsa, medium jalapeño, and extremely spicy habanero). Everything was amazing, the atmosphere was great, food was delicious, and service too!!!  The reason it lost a star for me was because of my last visit. I returned with my mom and sister. Once again it was busy, but we were seated right away, but near the back of the restaurant. Our waiter was really nice, and we ordered our drinks. I decided to try the Mango-Rita(small), one of their choices from the famous margarita selection. So tasty!!! :) Problems: - Birthday celebrations: I don't know how there were so many birthdays that night but the excessive noise from each celebration and children running around/screaming made our experience less than enjoyable. -Food: I ordered the carne asada soft tacos. Came out to be extremely dry and tasteless, especially with no toppings. Mentioned to waiter but didn't seem to care.  However, my mom's chimichanga, and sister's enchiladas were great! Would definitely return but on a less-crowded night."}
{"text":"Another visit that doesn't disappoint! Just as satisfied as my first visit;  delicious food with apppetizing presentation, excellent service,  vibrant vibe and overall great experience. Worth the drive up north to Newmarket.   I got the fish tacos ~$15. Quite a filling dish!  I ate all the tacos but didn't even dig into the rice,  even though the rice was very flavourful and yummy. The fish was so crispy and stayed crispy.  Mind you,  I had a cold when I ate this,  so I can't comment much on the flavours,  but I added the guac sauce from my salad side,  and it tasted a lot better with! Adds some sweetness and creaminess. Presentation has bright colours and has consistent and neat plating.   The burritos,  enchiladas and empanadas my friends got looked really good as well.   The waitress was so present,  patient and offered many times samples and explained the different options they have. Exemplary restaurant and would call it one of my faves!"}
{"text":"We have visited Made in Mexico many times since it opened its doors, first at a smaller location across the street from where they are currently located. Service is friendly and the food is good. We especially love the guacamole with its spicy sauces but I would like more tomatoes and onions in the guac. I have had quesadillas, alambres, tacos and enchiladas. Sometimes, I find when I think I am trying something new, that one dish quite resembles or tastes like another. The way celebrate birthdays always makes me smile - they are so enthusiastic and the song is so lively that you also want to sing along."}
{"text":"Amazing restaurant! Makes you feel like you have stepped into Mexico! Amazing food and great ambiance! We went on a friends birthday and they sang her a song and gave her a shot! Such a nice touch! Thank you Made in Mexico!!!"}
{"text":"Newmarket's very own gem, right on main street!!! I love main st newmarket.. how come I feel like they have better food than any other main st?? Made in mexico is huge, with a patio in the front and a large dining AND bar area. Make sure you make reservations on the weekend because it does get busy.  The owner Caesar is absolutely the nicest person ever! He obviously hires staff that are on the same level of niceness as he is, because they were all super lovely to talk to. I brought my friend here to #OrderTheYelp, and he downloaded the app just for it! (yay for me!) With the yelp deal, it was AMAZING - under $8 for a HUGE burrito boyz sized burrito + two sides (rice, beans, salad) My friend and I were seriously going to burst and I didn't even have the filling-ness of the meat and cheese in my meal!! Also ordered a small watermelon margarita, it was a little too much ice, which the bartender apologized for, but IT WAS STILL GREAT! I thought they messed up and gave me a large by accident because the small was so. big. WTF? If I had a large, I would've popped. My friend had the mango mexican bulldog and this is one of the first places I've been where they have different flavours of their margaritas and mexican bulldogs! Soooo deliciously icy and good. Their sangria is also very fresh, as I saw them chopping new fruit for it every few minutes.   They also gave us some churros at the end, and my friend devoured them even though he was past his 'too full, gonna die' point.  I'm definitely coming back. DEFINITELY. Now I need to find a baeritto to buy me burritos.... haha.. ha.. ok, I'll escort myself out now."}
{"text":"I gave it three stars, wanted to give it three 1/2 but its flaws keeps it there. Having said that I continue to go back....  Flaws: - Too noisy;  - can be slow at times; - The birthday BS is tired, this really needs to go, and the way it is done is offensive to Mexicans  A must is the Frijoles Charros, an excellent bean soup with pieces of chorizo, it is to die for and the reason I am under the spell of \"Made in Mexico\".  Nachos are good and most of the food is authentic, I especially like the Hispanic servers, it lends credence to the owners wanting to convey a somewhat realistic experience.  All in all, it has blemishes but the effort is noticeable so it's worth your time at least once!"}
{"text":"Great Mexican themed food! About as authentic as you could get outside of Mexico.   Not the cheapest meal but the quality is top notch and it's a decent value for the money; entrees average around the $14 mark. Portions are quiet generous and the service was pleasant, helpful, and didn't make fun of me for butchering their language whilst I was floundering for the pronunciation of menu items.  If you can't stand the heat, don't mess with the hot sauce, it's made in house and it's legit.  It's good, go, now.  Ray from Beaverton"}
{"text":"I went here on June 27, 2013 and the food was fantastic! The portions are huge and the atmosphere is fun! They brought out these giant hats and sang a song to us. It was so fun! I would recommend going early - we went around 6pm and it wasn't too busy. You may also want to make reservations so that you are guaranteed a table. But, if you have to wait, it's worth it the wait!!! The food is that good!"}
{"text":"You gotta Avoid! The service is awful  We came for a quick lunch on taco Tuesday. We stopped in at 11:30AM and the restaurant was empty. We stopped in at this time knowing it wouldn't be busy.  We sat down they took our drink orders. Then the server disappeared for 20mins.  At this point we really should have left.  She took our food order and it took about 40 mins before it arrived  The food was pretty good but the food and service had really gone downhill."}
{"text":"This was the worst experience I have had eating at a 'Mexican' restaurant.  I lived in Mexico for ten years and never did we eat such terrible tasting Mexican food.  I love Mexican food, but what they serve here is not authentic Mexican cuisine, but some cheap imitation.   I will never patronize this restaurant again."}
{"text":"So not my first time here but this my first time going full out. Probably ordered too much food but who cares! Yolo for my belleh!! Anyhow taco salad was huge and awesome ... The bowl was crispy and so yummy... The bean soup side is great! (Awesome for hangovers too , I've had it here after a long night), cilantro rice as good as well..... Rice And cilantro can be together heh. My chorizo tacos were very very good and now they have Dos Equis on tap now so enjoying a pint or 2 or 3 with this fine meal. Good way to spend you Friday night. Make reservations though, this place is a hot spot in Newmarket so prepare to be in a loud and excited atmosphere but even though noisy its pleasant environment... Just got handed a random bean taquito..... Also good. I'm starting to think that I should have used paragraphs to break up this review and also maybe I should have not been drinking while food blogging . or maybe that's EXACTLY what I should have been doing! Eat Here. Its good stuff!"}
{"text":"Great food! Make sure you have a reservation, or might have to wait 40 minutes for a table.  Many tasty items to choose from on the menu. Many great drinks too. Some dishes a little greasy, but still very good. We will definitely be coming back for more!"}
{"text":"Tough to find, but worth it. Hidden behind the Rexall at the back of the mall, it is tricky to find if you come in from the wrong direction.   Once you make it inside, it's a different story. Like all of the other MIM locations popping up, it has the same decor and ambiance, and a pretty engaging server.   I had the Huaraches for $15. It's an open faced corn tortilla with pork and a variety of other toppings. It comes with two sides, so I made it 2 bowls of the Charros (bean soup). Love that soup!  Stay alert and you'll find the place!!"}
{"text":"There are 3 Mexican Restaurants in Newmarket/Bradford.  The top of the hill is owned by Made in Mexico.  I routinely have the Enchilada Lover's Platter, with a side of the delicious guacamole.  Their quality yields benefits, like a thriving business that causes the expansion to a bigger location across the street, packed houses every day, and a spot on TV's \"You Gotta Eat Here\".  I could go on, but let the experience speak for itself.  Just go, stuff your face, and try to not smile with satisfaction!  Expect to not finish your meal unless you are famished, since the plates are loaded to an extreme.  At least the remainder makes a great snack for later.  Tip:  Make sure you read the walls..."}
{"text":"Thought this place was decent before, doesn't taste authentic but the atmosphere was pretty cool. Price is okay, however VERY IMPORTANT TO KNOW - this restaurant appeared as temporarily closed for a few days as the health safety board found unsanitary conditions .. I found this on the Toronto health website. Just beware to anyone who is looking to eat here."}
{"text":"Best Mexican we have had in a very long time. Definitely on our list of places to bring friends."}
{"text":"First time I went I got the Ground beef burrito with beans and rice. It's a huge meal that's for sure, and it's even enough to split with a friend. Food was great and service was on point!  Second time...a little different. I got the fiesta platter so I could try a little of everything. The cheese empanadas we're definitely a winner! Would come back for those alone. The rest of the platter was a little mediocre. The chips were good, the sauce was a little hot, but the flautas, bean taquitos, and chicken adobo sope I could've done without. They all were just little bits of filling in a fried wrapper and didn't have much taste to them.   We were also there for a friends birthday. As we ordered the birthday special, we got 6 churros on the house with caramel sauce. They also come out singing and put a sombrero on everyone at the table which was fun!   Overall, note to self, stick with the burritos or empanadas next time!"}
{"text":"Ah? Food was ok, service was good but meals nothing I would saw were yelp worthy to brag about"}
{"text":"Great Mexican food and a standout in the Newmarket restaurant scene!  As all have suggested:  1)Make a reservation 2)Have a Bulldog 3)Try the Queso Fundido (with Chirzo and ask for a side of pico de gallo.. YUM)  Everything we had was delicious. The Nachoes, the beef chimichanga, the Fish Tacos... omg. Just divine. Fresh, great salsas, etc  Last but not least, the Frijole Charros soup is just... BANGING. I could eat that every day.  I will be back next time I'm in Newmarket for SURE. A real treat, especially in an area lacking in good Mexican food (the GTA, not just Newmarket, that is)."}
{"text":"I was looking for a good place to have nachos and thought \"Made in Mexico\" would be the perfect choice. To start, I ordered a Mojito and I have to say the best one i've had in this town so far. Unfortunately, this is where my praise ends.  I ordered nachos figuring a Mexican joint will have this dish in spades. Well, if \"in spades\" is over cooking nacho chips until they ooze grease, then they were done just right.  Service was adequate. Yes, she asked all the right questions but her timing was off and for most of the meal our table never had drinks at the same time. Good thing we had nothing to toast."}
{"text":"This is as close to the Mexican food that I've tried in San Diego.  Taste, fantastic! Portions are big. Service is good.  I was surprised to find that it was very busy on a Wednesday night. Good thing we arrived 'later', so I was able to get a table right away.  I loved the Chimichanga - pork. Crispy on the outside, with yummy goodness on the inside, and topped with cheese. The meat was well seasoned, not too much rice. It's just right. It also comes with two sides.  If you like margaritas, you might want to consider ordering one. They are the size of a melon. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Love this place been here lots of times and food is always fresh and tastes so like Mexico without going to Mexico. My go to place when I am in Newmarket"}
{"text":"I realized that i'm not a big fan of Mexican food...too much rice, too much bean, too much corn. But this place impressed me.  a) our waiter was cuuuuuute as hellz. sup Jorge ;)  b) the queso with chorizo dip was PURE CHEESE. just like cheese. and nothing else. holy friggin heaven....  c) guacamole was amazing and came with deep fried chips, so crunchy, so big, so fresh  d) chimichanga. wtf. is this. you could feed all of Africa...or replace the insides with an African child. or any child for that matter. IT'S HUGE! The pork carnitas was just right, soft and cooked to perfection. YUM  The area it's in is lovely, it's close to the trail that me and my parents and my lovely dog come to take walks on, by the lake. It has a cute small town vibe, kinda Gilmore Girls-ish  Salsa was NOT spicy enough. NO NO NO.   PS yeah, i finished everything. my cheese dip, my chimichanga, my friend's left over chimichanga and guacamole. BRING IT, MEJICO!!"}
{"text":"Down hill in the last few months.  Told there was a wait so we sat at the bar and had to clean food off the chair first then waited 10 minutes for someone to even say hello, we were 2 feet away from them!  15 more and we got a table it was not overly busy but whatever. So many people complaining about the cleanliness and the taste of there food. we ordered and waited 40 minutes , no food ,no one even came by to ask if we were OK. We left and won't be coming back."}
{"text":"We will definitely come back. We found the place by accident so we decided to try. Wow food is amazing and we'll worth your money."}
{"text":"Went with my boyfriend for a date night, something different! We had a great waiter, who was fast and friendly! The employees give off a great vibe in this exciting atmosphere! We finished the night with churros- which were absolutely amazing! Try the enchiladas or the chimichangas!"}
{"text":"This place was underwhelming. Heard about it on the show \"You Gotta Eat Here\". 30 minute wait from the time we arrived even though there were many empty tables in the back. We had drinks at the bar while waiting. Lime margarita on the rocks and a mango mojito. Both tasted nice but seemed to be stingy on the alcohol. Once we were seated we waited a while to be served. Once the order was taken we waited at least another 45-60 mins for our food. Apparently the kitchen had ran out of one of the sides that came with the entree and instead of letting us know and offering something they made us wait. Now about the food - We had the mixed taco entree - beef with chorizo and the pulled pork. The beef was dry and tasteless. The pork carnitas were flavorful but the taco seemed empty and should have nicely been paired with some condiments...they were bare. We also had the carne asada chimichanga which also left something to be desired. Maybe it was the long wait and poor service that set the tone for the meal but anyhow, I'm sure that better Mexican food can be found."}
{"text":"Was pretty good food,we ordered almost everything.  I think it's best to eat the food hot and fresh. Took the food home it was stale and after reheating I wondered of the food was horrible to begin with."}
{"text":"Went here with a group from work. Lots of fun, excellent service, and the food is not bad. I'm spoiled for good Mexican food by going to LA so often. The Mexican places there are tough to beat. But the combos here are really big. Even the fish tacos was too much for me to finish. The soft tortillas were a little bit soggy so I just ate the fish and coleslaw. I had a side of lime cilantro rice which was ok. The best thing about Made in Mexico is the Margarita menu. Of course lime is the best but you can also try mango, strawberry or several other flavours. Plus there's the Bulldog with the upside down bottle of Corona in the Margarita glass. They have good quality Tequila if you are wiling to pay extra. I tried a mojito this time and would stick to the Margaritas from now on. So there you go. Great place to go for a drink, not so good for dinner. Chips and guacamole are a good thing to get if you just want a snack.  Tip: Use the tables with wooden chairs. The seating on the red padded benches along the walls is way too high or the tables are way too low. Very uncomfortable."}
{"text":"This is my second visit and the food was pretty awesome. Portion size was definitely decent. The majority of my co-workers weren't able to finish their food. The wait staff were nice and the food arrived together for our large party.   I'm sure I will be back"}
{"text":"Service was slow as they seemed understaffed BUT the food was definitely worth the wait!!!!!!!  You MuST order their nachos!!! Real Watermelons were used in the watermelon margarita which made it even MORE awesome!!!!!!  Polite staff, family run business, a must try."}
{"text":"Okay so I have heard BIG HYPE about this place but I went today for the first time and wouldn't go back. I went with my mom and My grandma. Now my grandma had tried to go here before with her friend but they left because they wouldn't let her friend sit on the booth because she has a bad back so they left since her friend couldn't sit on a hard chair, it would of made her back much worse. So that's why we went here cuz my grandma wanted to try again but none of us were impressed. Okay so let's start from the beginning. We got here at about 1:15pm ish on  a Thursday. We walk in, wasn't very busy, and wait at the desk. Looking around we see one boy who is busy with a table/behind the bar. So we just keep on waiting cuz as u can see he's busy. But Now it's been a few mins and we don't even see a sign that says\"please wait to be seated\" so we start to wonder do we seat ourselves? But then my mom went to ask the boy behind the bar \"should we wait to be seated?\" And he said\" yes I will be with you in a moment\" now I myself am I server too, so it would be nice if someone could say that to you right when costumers walk in otherwise we just stand there awkwardly waiting for someone to tell us what's up. That should be the first thing, is to always greet the customers when they walk in and let them know they will be taken care of momentarily. I don't mind waiting I would just prefer if someone would greet you as because it's the polite thing to do. Okay after a few mins, he leads us to the back and brings us to a table and says \"is this okay\" and it was right beside a group of atleast 12 and they were so loud! I said to the boy \"can we sit maybe away from the party?\" And I couldn't even hear his reply because the party was so loud! It seemed as if he said something like\"theirs no server in that section\" which is understandable I get it, Sometimes at my serving job THeir is no server at the back. I totally get it. So I thought okay let's compromise. So I asked \"how about over there then?\" It was middle from the party and middle from the back. He said \"uhm it should be ok let me check with my manger. \"So at this point we sat down, and then he comes back and says \"sorry my manager says it we aren't able to accommodate you here\"are we were like \"really? \"My grandma then said \"this happened last time, my friend needed to sit somewhere with a booth and they said no, so we left\" at this point I personally would of left but my grandma wanted to try this place. So then a different server comes over and says \"I can just take them here\" and we were like \"okay thankyou\" ... like they want people here to make money right?!? So why not let them sit where the want(within reason) personally if this continues I could see this restaurant not staying open much longer. So after the boy comes back \"may I get a drink before I cash out my big party\" which means he was saying nicely that I will be a few minutes because he needed his big party to pay. He was a nice polite server. I would give him 4/5. So then after we came back we ordered, food didn't take long, maybe 10-15 mins at the most. I got a chicken quesadilla, Mexican rice and a bean soup. Soup was delicious. Rice was quite good as well but the quesadilla was ok. Nothing great considering that was the main dish. Also I never seen a quesadilla in the shape that it was so it was quite different then what I expected. But okay let me back up a bit. Right when the food came I told my mom and grandma I was going to the bathroom but I went to get the bill from my server cuz I wanted to pay for it. Part 2 coming"}
{"text":"Came in for lunch the other day.   We walked in, and stood at the front for a few minutes before anyone even acknowledged us, even though there were three servers at the front, 2 of which just walked by us.   After we were seated, our server turned the experience around. She was quick and tentative.   We ordered our drinks and an appetizer. We got some melted cheese with chorizo thing, I can't really remember the name of. It was pretty good, but it only came with 5 small tortillas. Not enough for the amount of cheese given, so we ordered some chips. The chips were pretty great. I've been to other Mexican places where the chips were stale. These were nice and crispy.   I ordered a lime bulldog margarita. It's basically a margarita with a Coronita stuck inside of it. It cost $10.95, but it was quite large and strong.   I also got the Taco Carnitas with the hard shell. These were pretty good. The hard shell is really good too, but you have to pay an extra $1. My friend got the roast beef ones and those were really good too (we traded). My Fiance got the pork and pineapple ones, and I didn't really care for it.   Overall, it was a decent meal. But I'm not sure it's worth the trek out to Newmarket. I would go back if I were in the area."}
{"text":"I've been here 3 times.  First impression was quite good!  Second visit we got fish tacos, my friends were raw and mine made me vomit.   It's been several months since I've been back but I decided to give it another shot since I love Mexican food.  I walked into the restaurant which wasn't very busy and sat down at the bar.  The staff noticed me sit down but were all standing around chatting to each other and seemed generally uninterested that I was there.  After 10 minutes I simply walked out.  I won't be back.   Bradford has an excellent mexican restaurant and great service.  Go there instead."}
{"text":"It's ok...  I mean I love the fact there is a decent Mexican joint in the area, but the food wasn't \"great\".  Tacos were dry, and everything was just a bit underwhelming."}
{"text":"This place is definitely a must if you like Mexican food. Huge place but gets busy, even on a Thursday night. With a group of 11, including 4 kiddos, everyone had a great time. Nice clean place, amazing service and awesome food. The kids meal (tacos) were a little bland, but once you add the sauces they provide you, it enhances the flavour a lot. The nacho plate, regular tacos, enchaladas and the chimichangas were amazing. All of us can't wait to go there again."}
{"text":"Popped in for a margarita with my wife. Decor is more cafateria then Mexican.  Margaritas were way to sweet and in dirty grimy plastic glass. Bartender was nice enough. Ordered the Chips and Pico de Galla. Chips were stale and Pico was white died out tomatoes. (maybe made in Mexico)"}
{"text":"Ok where should we start. I have been to many Mexican restaurants in California, Toronto and Mexico. This is by far the worst in terms of presentation and food quality. We ordered a piña colada and red wine sangria to start. Piña colada is more like pineapple sugar water with crushed ice. Sangria is like stale red wine with tiny bit of OJ with no fruits at all.  Then onto the food.  We ordered fish and pork taco.  Despite the fact that the taco shell may be pre-made in house, they are cold and mushy.  Fish for sure are pre fried as they are warm at best, soggy and tasteless.  Pork taco is with extra salty pull pork. If that's not bad enough, the tacos arrived with sauce at the bottom and all the taco shells are soaked wet.  While lm typing up this comment and trying to finish our bland sangria, the server came with a bill which we didn't ask for, along with his credit card machine and asking if we are paying by card or cash.  We only arrived at less than an hour ago.  Sorry we won't be coming back and we won't recommend this place to anyone. Gourmet Gringos in Aurora is way better than this place just for the fish taco itself.  As \"Made in Mexico\" isn't even up to chain restaurant's standard.  Again, this proves the \"You gotta eat here\" show is for advertisement only.  So far none of the restaurants I went which John recommended can be considered as \"good eat\".  On a side note, this place has tons of people celebrating birthdays. The music is extremely loud too. Just for your information."}
{"text":"After reading all the mouthwatering reviews and passing by many times, I had wanted to try Made in Mexico for ages. We went in at 5:30 on a Wednesday evening and already it was bustling. As we looked over the extensive menu, we were struck by the steady stream of obviously repeat customers coming in. The atmosphere was upbeat casual with friendly, helpful wait staff. The food was fresh and delicious with large portions. We ended up choosing the nacho platter and a combination platter and both were wonderful. The margarita menu was really tempting with lots of interesting- looking drinks. The location was beautiful and newly renovated since moving from across the street. I am already looking for an excuse to go back to try more items on the menu.  On a side note, they are renovating the old restaurant to focus on fresh fish I believe, with dancing and live shows downstairs. Looking forward to this!"}
{"text":"Food is fantastic...service is thee worst I have ever recieved. The person who \"greeted\" us, was also the bartender, clearly could care less about life. Completely disinterested. The server, took about 10 mins to acknowledge us. Then,  forgot our drinks and we got the appetizer before we did recieve them. We watched as our food sat in the window all the while the \"manager\", a heavyset woman, continuously walked by it. She offered no help to any of the staff. We watched other tables experiencing the same. Tried to speak to tbe manager as we left. She was sitting at a table, really couldnt care less about our feedback, and shrugged her shoulders. Wont be back. Shame too...food was delish"}
{"text":"I saw this place being shown on the episode of \"You Gotta Eat Here\" on the Food Network quite a while back. I have had this place on my \"to eat list\" for a long time now but its far coming from Scarborough so I have been postponing my visit here. Well, I have made a grave mistake in doing so because this place is just amazing. I'm not even a huge fan of Mexican food but everything here was spot on.   Quesadilla gringa carne asada $14.35 - it was like pulled beef put in a soft flatbread. You get to choose 2 sides and I got rice and soup as my sides. The pulled beef had a buttery taste and there was alot of meat to be found in the flatbread. The sides were excellent aswell. There really is no need for me to describe how good the food tasted. I was making \"mmmmm\" sounds throughout my whole meal to show my satisfaction. I felt sad when my meal ended and I just wished it could have continued forever.   Nacho Rancheros $14.95 + $2 guac dip - the nachos are not the ones you see in gorcery stores in the chip isle. These babies are made made from scratch for sure. Loaded with cheese, chunks of beef and some baked beans. Add the sour cream and guac and you have yourself a lethal combination of tasteafication.   Portions on both dishes were very filling even for a big eater like myself. Service was excellent and very friendly. Seating outside on a nice summer day just made the whole experience even better. Just wish the road wasn't slanted on a hill because it made the tables slanted aswell. The other drawback of eating outside are the bees. For some reason everytime I go to a Mexican restaurant I am bothered by bees. I guess the bees love Mexican food. Refer to my review on Planeta Mexico for the bee reference :)"}
{"text":"We had a horrible experience here on Saturday night. I've been to this restaurant before and feel that their food is very over rated but my friend LOVES churros and we were surprising her for her birthday so I went with five other women. They weren't able to give us a reservation for 8:30, and when we said we were surprising someone who would be arriving at that time they told us to send someone early to get a table - so we did.   We finished dinner at 9:30 and asked for the dessert menu - no one came back until 9:57 and when we asked, again for the dessert menu the server told us that the kitchen was closed (technically we still had three minutes but this didn't seem to make any difference). We explained that it was our friend's birthday (I had already told him this and he had suggested that they would sing for her but never did) and that the main reason we came to this restaurant was so that she could get get churros. We implored him to do something so he went to the kitchen and came back saying that he couldn't help us because they were all out of churros (they NEVER run out of churros). We implored with him some more and so he went back to the kitchen and came back saying sorry the kitchen was closed. At this point we were thoroughly disgruntled and asked to speak with the manager.   Ricardo was not interested at all in what we had to say and when we said that none of us would ever come back he said that he \"didn't need our business anyway.\" He also said that they did us a favour by not closing our table early because people showed up late (remember, we were TOLD to send someone early to get a table!)  We finally just asked for our bill and no one came to our table. So we all had to get up and pay our bills on the way out. There were no apologies from our server or the manager and they basically got increasingly snide with us.   I will never go back and am telling everyone about my experience there. I hear that Dos Mariachis in Aurora is worth a try!"}
{"text":"Dropped in here for a weekday lunch. They have a HUGE menu - made it a bit hard to decide what to get especially with a short lunch break! I ordered the pork burrito with lime and cilantro rice, salad, and beans.   Pork burrito is LOADED with pulled pork and very tasty and filling. The salad was pretty good, the lime and cilantro rice was great.  I also tried the Mexican coffee which is made with coffee, cinnamon and pilloncillo (cane sugar). It was not too sweet and has a nice taste - something a little different. Since they don't have take out cups, I got mine to go in a take out soup container with some milk in it :)  Some other menu items that caught my eye but I (obviously) didn't have the stomach for:   5 kinds fresh daily salsas, nachos, appetizers such as guacamole n chips, bean taquitos, queso fundido with chorizo mushroom or poblano peppers served with warm tortillas, soups, tacos, desserts such as chocoflan, Mexican flan, churros and oh also enchiladas, quesadillas, chimichangas, alambres fish tacos tamales and also flautas.......... wow that was quite a mouthful of words.   I'll have to come back to try out more of the menu I just read off because that fondue sounds really interesting right now as I type up this review...."}
{"text":"Made in Mexico is a one of a kind restaurant in Newmakret, Ontario.  This is a two part visit in this review.  It's from visits last year.  I went for lunch on the advice of several friends and the promise of an extensive gluten free menu.  The food was well prepared, there was lots of it, and the wait staff was fantastic.  We sat out on the patio which was quite nice with a picturesque view of Main Street, Newmarket.  I was impressed with the flavours, and the hot sauces that were provided.  They were able to make a combination plate for me that was actually overflowing over the sides of the plate.  I had a great meeting with a friend and decided that I would come back because I was so impressed with the food, but when I came back I was told that the food that I had eaten on my previous trip would not be a good match for me because of the seriousness of my food issues.  I had eaten there a few weeks earlier and hadn't put two and two together.  I can't always tell what triggers a reaction, or when it starts.  If you have a severe issue with gluten, you need to be aware that anything made with a corn wrap has been dipped in the deep fryer to make the wraps more pliable.  I'm hoping that this has changed by now, as I never went back after the first two trips because I was so concerned about how careful they were with the rest of the preparation.  I went to the Bradford location and they made an alternate dish for me that was quite good as well."}
{"text":"Just terrible. From the indifferent service to the bland food, I have no idea why this place is so popular. This was a re-visit to see if they had improved any.   45 minutes for our food to arrive for a table of four. We had a view of the kitchen and it sat there for 10 minutes while server after server walked by it. Who is running this dining room? If the food is ready the next person delivers it. Period.   The service wasn't great at the old location and it's terrible now.   After the food arrived it went from bad to worse. My mother in laws taco salad was missing 3 ingredients from the menu description. I got the nachos with chorizo because I wanted some spice and flavour. Bland. How is chorizo ever bland? The other two meals in our group were no better.   We won't ever be returning and will not recommend."}
{"text":"I really want to give them a 5 star because the food alone is worth beyond that. The service however has to be given some consideration because it's always packed and the wait for a seat can get very long. It's well worth the wait, but it's still a knock against them."}
{"text":"This is probably the busiest spot in Newmarket on a Saturday night. Lee is always wanting to try Mexican places, and this place looked promising, so we stopped by.  It was really really busy, with at least a half hour wait. Honestly, if it was more up to me, I would have probably gone elsewhere, but we were here, so we waited.  Finally, we were shown to a table ... of sorts. It was basically a place where they decided to squeeze more seating in, by putting some barstools up against a high table, facing a wall. It was one of the weirdest places I've sat at in a restaurant, and it was directly across from the kitchen entrance, so a little bit noisy.  Welp, we may as well order some food. I got huaraches with carnitas, which I was happy to get, that's something you don't normally see on a menu. It was good, but a little bit more like a soft tortilla than actual masa dough. The carnitas were quite delicious Lee got the Enchilada Lovers, which was a variety of enchiladas with sauces. He really enjoyed it.  Food wise, this is probably the best Mexican I've had in Canada.  The service was pretty middling at best. Our server committed a pretty big pet peeve in my eyes. She told us our food would be out next. We watched her serve food to 4 other tables before we got our food. If the masa were handmade on the huaraches, I might have been more understanding, because that usually takes time. I just really felt that overall, we were a bit of an afterthought.  I'd definitely go back for the food, but I would probably avoid this place on a Saturday unless I got reservations."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times now but it's been awhile since the last time I went. Food is ok. Not that much flavour, kinda bland. Friday nights are ALWAYS busy and loud. Birthday song every 5 mins lol literally. Service has always been on par."}
{"text":"Family Fun in Mexico Got here from a friends referral to come all the way over to Newmarket for Mexican.  This place is happening with a full house.  Family packed fun. Huge portions and home made hot sauces that go from tame to OMG.   I had the shrimp burrito massive.  Yes they should include the name massive. I could barely put this down.  The mushroom tacos and pork tacos looked amazing with the fresh taco.   The kids had a blast with their choices and the ice cream toppings.  Kids are free on Sundays which was a nice surprise.   Service was great and the staff know how to have fun. I think they had 5 birthday parties and the best out the hats and music every time.   Will definitely be recommending this place to my friends as a great family restaurant and worth the trip.   Looking forward to the summer walks in the area.  The place is set in the historical part of Newmarket."}
{"text":"This place was featured in \"You Gotta Eat Here\"..and they are right!  I discovered this place after seeing many friends check in on Facebook..decided to drop by one day as I was in the area; it is located on main street Newmarket.  This restaurant has a lot of seating, but service can be quite slow sometimes as it is a large restaurant so it can be difficult to hunt down your server.  I have come here over a dozen times now and my favourite is definitely the fish tacos..for $13 you get 3 fish tacos, served with coleslaw along with a choice of two sides (choices are refried beans, lime & cilantro rice, mexican rice, bean soup or salad).  The pricing here is very reasonable compared to other mexican restaurants..and the environment is very lively.  This restaurant is closed on Mondays and Tuesdays."}
{"text":"4.5/5  I just love Made in Mexico. The servers are pleasant and the food is always yummy. If you don't like it, they fix it! I've tried their sangria and a few others like the Mexican bulldog and the drink with the beer, lime juice and salt. All were so tasty. I really enjoy their tostadas, lime and cilantro rice and refried beans. The music and decorations pull you into the Mexican spirit and before you know it, you're wearing a sombrero and taking pictures.   Come here and enjoy yourself! I especially recommend sitting by the large open windows and taking in some sunshine and summer breeze."}
{"text":"Pros: Vibe... Prices.. Service.. Authenticity  Cons.. Wtf.. No Chicharrón on the menu?  The place came highly recommended by many people.. So we checked it out.. We had a party of 4.  Make reservations because the place was packed.  We had a booking and were seated promptly.  The atmosphere is fun, lively and great.  The service is friendly and helpful.. No complaints.  I think k i just ordered the wrong item.. I had the lobster tacos as my main.. Just io much going on... The sauces and the other fixings on the taco overpowered the overseasoned lobster.. And I think it was grilled or charred on a flat top because quite honestly I couldn't taste the lobster.. I couldn't tell if it was grilled shrimp or grilled crawfish.. Like I said.. It was so busy it killed the lobster and ended up being a waste.  My wife's Burrito was really tasty though.. I should have gone with that.   For starters we had the avocado dip with homemade fried tacos... A bit greasy but tasty.  We also had the Empanadas.. These came fried.. 3 of the 6 had broken in the frier and all the cheese has oozed out.  They tasted like mozzarella sticks.. The homemade jalapeno sauce saved what was left of the greasy shells.  Perhaps the bar was set too high or an appearance on the food network show You Gotta Eat Here has made them too busy for their own good but I expected better.  And I meant it when I asked.. A Mexican restaurant with no Chicharrón anywhere on the menu?   My wife's burrito.. The service, the lime and cilantro rice and that jalapeno sauce saved this review from being a 2 star.    I will try it one more time but order different items to give them the benefit of the doubt."}
{"text":"I read the reviews, and had to try it.  Had my first visit, staff was polite and nice. Food was good!!!  Ordered 2 kids meal ( reasonable pricing and good size!). The fish tacos were very good!!,   Downside - Not of fan of wobbly tables, very irritating while eating.  Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Consistently amazing - at lunch and at dinner... We love the atmosphere and the food is always great!"}
{"text":"Made in Mexico is amazing! Always great service (they are all so nice) and the food is always fresh and  yummy! Would definitely recommend, love the Mexican rice!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious food! I was with 3 friends and we all ordered many different things. They had this promotion of specialty tacos they were only making for a week, it was great! I had the shrimp tacos and both friends had the steak one, so flavourful! I had the pork burrito and it was alright but I think their empanadas and tacos were fantastic."}
{"text":"Dinner for Two at Made in Mexico....... Saturday night the restaurant was buzzing, would recommend to make reservations ahead.  We arrived on time and were seated right away.  We started off with a Mango Margarita,and a Bulldog. Natchoes were fresh and crispy. Food was delicious, portions were generous, and the price point was affordable.  Great place to go with a group of people.  Very upbeat atmosphere with good music. Parking in the back, Great for families.  I would go back again."}
{"text":"I had seen this place on 'You Gotta Eat Here\" and I wanted to check it out. I glad I did. Great food with a very comfortable and casual environment in which to relax and enjoy. The prices are very reasonable especially considering the quantity of food you get. I was stuffed. If you like hot sauces you try must the habanero sauce. I don't know if they make it or not but it tastes like they just made it fresh 5 minutes before it was served. By far the best I've ever had and I'll go back just to have some of it again.  The staff were friendly and were helpful in making a selection from the menu. I'll be back to eat again and I'll bring friends to share the experience with."}
{"text":"Used to be great....since they've moved, it's gone way downhill.  Prices are higher, content and service have gone down.  You even have to pay for chips and salsa now....and don't expect ANY toppings for your tacos because they charge for everything.  Food is mediocre at best now too...I can deal with paying a premium if I get something special, but this isn't it."}
{"text":"This place rocks!  Fairly authentic, reasonable prices, good probs, great service.  A family favorite!"}
{"text":"Love this place . Food is always good. Service is amazing . Delivers a great night out every time."}
{"text":"It's quite far out there, but i will say, this is the best mexican restaurant in the north at that price point.  It's tucked away on what appears to be a residential area, and then bam, an old style commercial street with some high end pet grooming stores and restaurants...weird.   I had quite a bit on the menu, coming with sharing friends. I have to say, everything was good and exceeded my expectations for a New Market restaurant. The stars of the dishes always shone through, but certain side dishes could have been a little better. I like that the focus is on simplicity, freshness and making you feel like you've just sinned by eating that much food. The hot sauces are to die for and I'm looking forward to going back and being able to buy that beautifully florescent habanero sauce (the owner mentioned that she would start commercially selling them soon).   I think what you get out of a place like this is a decent value restaurant, where you can casually go to relax and not break the bank. In return, you don't get high end mexican food, but you definitely get a lot more than your money's worth.   Oh and i should also mention, the service was outstanding."}
{"text":"Excellent atmosphere. Great food. Service was very slow. Server did not have much product knowledge. I'll go back again just because the food is good."}
{"text":"Was in nearby Sibbald Point and I remembered the Food Network show featuring this restaurant so we decided to check it out. Decor wise, lots of funny signs and a festive style. Our waitress was lovely but the food took a while to get to us. Thing is, it was the same for the other two tables next to us, it looked like a lot of people waiting for food. I also ordered a blue Margarita,  which was good but way too sweet. By the time our food got to us, we were super hungry but even with a big appetite, I felt let down by the food. We ordered tacos (mix &match), with pork carnitas,  roasted beef with chorizo, chorizo with onions, marinated pork....all were dry and salty. It needed something fresh and crunchy. ..like some pico de gallo! How can a simple taco go so wrong? On a positive note I really enjoyed the homemade corn tortilla, crispy and tasted like it was just made. I had the enchiladas with 4 different sauces, including red, salsa Verde,  salsa Poblana and mole. I enjoyed the mole sauce and salsa verde but the inside chicken seemed like the worst shredded quality of meat I've ever eaten at a restaurant.  We tried different sides, including the Lime and Cilantro rice, Mexican rice, refried beans, and bean soup.  All just ok. Mostly too salty. Overall, I liked the service and the atmosphere but the food left a lot to be desired."}
{"text":"Was I in Mexico or some tacky hybrid of what Westerns believe is Mexico? I came by for a quick lunch and ordered a soup and the taco salad - thinking both would be quick and easy. The soup was over salted and the taco salad was absolutely disgusting - in what universe does deep frying the bowl then layering cheap ingredients, included watery broiled chicken seem like a good idea? I told the waiter I was not happy with the salad to which he asked if I wanted some more shredded cheese on it? Yes, because cheese solves everything. I barely got half way through - thinking what was more important: my hunger or how I would feel after. I asked the waiter for the bill as I was in a rush, as I paid he actually took away my plate. In any other case, my \"hangry\" self would of chased a waiter down with a spoon if they took away an unfinished plate or an unfinished alcoholic drink - but for this act of terrible service he actually did me a favour. This food was so terrible I do not understand why people love it? Do they not know of other epic places to eat? Maybe the fact that it's Newmarket is enough said. Luckily, I don't live here and I'll happily return to my Toronto bubble!"}
{"text":"Made in Mexico never disappoints you wherever you go. I've been to the one at Newmarket which is always good in terms of the food quality, flavour profile and service.   I always get the chicken chimichanga, which is basically a fried huge burrito stuffed with chicken, beans, rice, cheese and etc. Along with the burrito, it comes with two sides of your choice.   You definitely get the bang for the buck with the huge portion size and price."}
{"text":"This is probably the best Mexican food I've ever had. My coworkers and I decided to check this place out but was a little hesitant at first due to the average rating on Yelp. Boy, I'm glad we went to this place - it's legit a hidden gem in Newmarket!!! Service is great. We were seated right away and the waitress gave us plenty of time to look at the menu.   I ordered the chicken chimichangas. The portion is large that's good for two servings. There is chicken, bean, rice and other goodies in the chimichanga. The sauce inside is so bomb - it is so unique. It taste like bbq sauce mixed with ten other sauces. The chimichanga also came with two sides; I think I got cilantro lime rice and salad (i was trying to be healthy).  The only downside is food came out slower than I expected. Every time the waitress brought food out, I was eyeing on the food hoping it was mine. I totally understand why though, they take their time to make the food yummy .  I highly recommend this place! I will definitely go back to try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"I had my second visit to this restaurant tonight, and now I'm even more convinced that this is now on my \"fave\" list.    We ordered the guacamole, chicken burrito and enchilada platter. The portions were more than generous and everything was delicious! Last time I was there I ordered the shrimp tacos which were great as well.  Service was great, drinks were tasty. All in all an awesome dinner. Would definitely recommend if you are looking for good Mexican food in York Region!"}
{"text":"Love this Mexican cuisine. Their food portions like a chimichanga is huuuuuge!! I get full every time I come here (even with takeout on the side). I also highly recommend their sides of the Mexican soup and rice. So much unique Mexican flavours brought out but don't order of you aren't a fan of beans! I love love love their drink selections. Though a bit pricey, so worth it. If I could recommend just coming here for drinks, I would! I always tend to order the Mexican bulldog (Mango preferred) which is a margarita with a mini corona bottle feeding into it. If you're not a fan of corona just opt to get their normal margaritas. Huge cups! Great taste! Great destination for birthdays as well. If you're of legal age, they give you a birthday shot, and sing an obnoxious birthday chant that will for sure leave a lasting memory for the celebrant. All in all, great Mexican eatery and experience. Authentic music, vibes and food. Would definitely recommend and keep coming back :)"}
{"text":"Meh. The food portions were very large but both my kids and I did not find the food very good. It was okay.  I expected better tasting tacos and burritos based on reviews from friends of mine. We went once and have not returned."}
{"text":"Wow.  I don't even know how to describe the unbelievable luck is people North of the 401 are to have a place like Made in Mexico.  This is by no means some humdrum TexMex or pseudo-Mexican restaurant for gringos.  This is the real deal.  If this were downtown, there'd be lineups as long as those ramen shops because of the excellence in all three areas of food, service and value.    I say value, because if this place was downtown prices would probably be 20-30% higher.  In fact, I'd still come here if the prices were higher, but they are not which makes it all the more awesome.  Service wise, I was blown away.  We have a very well behaved two year old toddler, and I am always very conscious as to whether restaurant staff have preconceptions about kids.  Well first off, the people who work here are probably the friendliest bunch as a whole I have seen in a long time.  Not only were they welcoming of us and our toddler, they made us feel very welcome.  Service was attentive and quick, with crayons and something to colour on provided quickly to keep a child busy.  I love that the children's menu not only was great value, but had real food instead of the usual cop outs of chicken fingers and fries.  Chicken Flautas for my daughter was an immediate hit.  We kind of pigged out and I can't exactly recall everything we had, but it was all good.  We had two of their platters, and the soup.  The bean soup with sausage bits in it was very tasty and flavourful.  Their platters offered an assortment of authentic Mexican, again very fresh and tasty.  Their new location is spacious and fantastic!  So happy that Yelp identified this awesome place up North for us to go to."}
{"text":"Seems like I come to Made in Mexico whenever I am up in Newmarket!?!   Dropped by on a Sunday for some dessert and drinks in between half time during Super Bowl. 1 hour before closing and I can just walk in without any reservation.  We shared Chocoflan ($4.95) and of course Churros ($4.95)!  We drank Cafe De Olla ($2.50) and Tequila Cazadore Anejo ($7.95)  The food and the drinks were as good as I remembered. And of course the service is always top notch!   I love Made in Mexico!"}
{"text":"We came here on Sunday with family for dinner. I have been to this place before approx 1 year ago, however I was very disappointed this time. Our waiter was okay, but he screwed up the order couple of times. As usual, place is always packed on weekends. We got wrong items couple of times, food was pretty bland and tasteless.   I don't think I will ever come back again to this restaurant. There are many good Mexican authentic restaurant in Toronto."}
{"text":"It took me about 45 minutes to arrive at Made in Mexico which is located in Newmarket not too far off the 400 exit.    I loved the restaurant ambience, the friendly staff and extensive menu.. Plus the food and drinks were cheap which is always a plus. Many customers were celebrating a birthday and the staff does a great job singing and giving their guests a festive hat for pictures. Highly recommended for embarrassing your friend if it's their birthday.  I ordered the enchilada sampler, sangria to share and watermelon daiquiri. I think the fact that I had a 45 drive in and I read such positive reviews that I expected to be wowed and left feeling mediocre. My enchiladas were quite dry, the lime rice tasted great but was cold and my daiquiri was not made well.  Made in mexico gets 3 stars for their staff, affordable and large menu as well as great sangria!"}
{"text":"We came here based on the reviews on Yelp.  It is not bad - closer to Southern Californian Mexican food than Tex-Mex.  We ordered a fish taco entree and a enchilada platter.  The fish tacos were good; I was glad that they did not use salmon like some Mexican places in Toronto.  The enchilada was better.  For both the tacos, enchilada and the mexican rice, I wished that they had used more herbs.  Mexican rice was too moist; almost mushy in texture, but the colour was good.  Margarita was actually quite similar to what I once had in Tijuana. Service was slower but acceptable.  Table was sticky; it could use a de-grease.  Overall, portion is big, so come hungry.  The average price per entree/platter is $13.  This may sound cheap in Toronto, but it is quite high compared to Southern California (but of course, there is limited competition in Toronto)."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. The drinks are great, food is priced very reasonably, serving portions are huge. This place is one of the only joints in Newmarket I can honestly see people need to visit. Go early and be prepared to wait (grab a drink!).  They have already expanded and it seems more and more people keep filling this place up. I can also say they are THE reason I now even consider eating on Main in Newmarket."}
{"text":"I've never been this far north of Toronto before. So when I was driving past farms, I was very skeptical that good Mexican food can be found so far north of the border. Once I arrived, I found the restaurant bustling with activity, quite unusual for any restaurant on a Wednesday night.  Our waiter was very friendly. We started off with a huge plate of nachos with 3 different guacamole sauces. They were all very good. The waiter also gave us a mild green sauce and a \"Mexican hot\" orange sauce. The Mexican hot was hot hot hot.  When ordering drinks, I didn't find what I wanted on the menu. What I failed to realize was that the menu mentioned that I can request anything I want, because the bartender is from Cancun. So I ordered a chelada. It was what I remembered, except that the drink wasn't spicy, which I thought it would be. Oh well. Not bad at all.  I ordered the enchilada platter, which is 4 enchiladas with different sauces: mole, a green, a red, and one with swiss cheese. The waiter suggested that I eat it from right to left from mole, green, red, then the swiss. Of the four, my favorite was the mole -- very delicious. I found that the green and swiss had too much lime juice for my liking.  We ended dinner with churros. They were nice and crispy with yummy cinnamon and sugar on the outside. It's offered with a caramel sauce, but the churros taste great without. A good way to end a meal.  I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Appetizers were really good! Would highly recommend the jalapeno poppers, really big, tasty and stuffed with beef! I'd recommend sharing between 4 people and having 1 each because they are massive.   The mains were decent but nothing special. I decided to try what I'm assuming is the house specialty - tacos. They seemed a bit under-seasoned and bland. I've been here in the past and had a chimichanga and it was much better than the tacos.   Next time I come I'd stick with the chimichanga but overall a pretty good Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"I have eaten at made in Mexico twice in the last year. The first time the fish tacos were undercooked  and the refried beans were cold. Thought I would give it another shot last month. I have no idea why the guys from gotta eat here loved the place. The food quality and taste are sub par."}
{"text":"Not the best Mexican food I have ever had but pretty good. 3.5 stars.  This restaurant was featured on Food network so we decided to give it a try.  Chips with Pico de Gallo (home made salsa): wow the Home-made chips were a hit; nice crunch and not oily. Pico de Gallo didn't quite live up to all the hype IMO; it was just ok. The appetizer came with generous amount of chips and a very small amount of salsa. We ran out of salsa half way through.   Ground beef Chimichanga came with 2 sides of choice; we went with soup and salad as the fried burrito itself is quite rich and heavy. Server mentioned that this is one of their best sellers and it did not disappoint. Chimichanga is stuffed with different toppings and very filling even for big eater like my husband.   Fish tacos (3 tacos) served with sides. I went with cilantro & lime rice (not a fan of the rice; quite bland and cold) and soup (which I did enjoy). Fish tacos were delish. Fish was thinly battered and fried; tasted fresh. The coleslaw complimented the fish well. I would get this again in future but would pair it with soup and salad instead of rice.   Overall, food quality was good, generous portion. They have all you can eat tacos on Tuesday with a purchase of a drink. I will definitely return on a Tuesday to try that"}
{"text":"Man, does this place put you on the vacation trajectory. Made in Mexico was featured on You Gotta Eat Here a few years back, and after catching the rerun on TV, my boyfriend was adamant we had to try this place out. Clearly, it's gained some popularity due to its appearance on TV, but it does not disappoint and lives up to its name. From nachos, tacos, burritos to bowls - this place has something from everyone and appeals to everyone's palate. From the spicy food lovers like myself, to the spice sensitive. Portions are very generous and in the three times we've been here, we've almost always regretted getting an entrée each simply because it's much too big for one person to enjoy on their own. Suggestion: Don't bother asking the chef to split anything; they adamantly refuse to do so, however the wait stuff are more than happy to bring you two separate plates. They have an arsenal of beverage options that will really remind you of an all-inclusive trip to Mexico - you really do gotta eat here."}
{"text":"Visited this place twice on a tuesday! Love the all you can eat taco!    The taco itself is very authentic. The skin is not like the ones you get from Taco Bell.   There is about 10 different options of Taco to choose from. My friends and I all like the ground beef one.   When you order for the second round, it can be slow! So if you are hungry, make sure you order right when your first order arrives!!    Also, their housemade hot sauce is a must try to go with the Taco!"}
{"text":"Terrible and slow service. Food is bland. Lots of flies in the restaurant. Avoid this place. Go to mexicanada in Bradford for real Mexican food."}
{"text":"Delicious, seemingly authentic Mexican cuisine, just as advertised. A wide variety of well priced and sell stuffed dishes. The chimichangas are a particular favourite of mine. Service is usually friendly and attentive. Orders can take a while but it's understandable due to their size and nature."}
{"text":"The staff is great! Best place for a birthday and large groups of people. They do a little something special for birthday parties. Nice club downstairs that starts at 10pm Fridays and Saturdays. Try anything with pork and the churros are fantastic! Also, bartenders are quick and effective! Awesome drinks!"}
{"text":"We started with the cheese nachos and the medium size was a huge portion. Each of the kids had the virgin daiquiris, lime, mango and strawberry and they loved them.  One person had the quesadilla pork gringa & he loved it..said it was a 5*,  was pulled pork cheesy deliciousness.  Also table had the pork enchilada and chimichanga & huge portions!  I found my enchilada a little salty but still very tasty.  Our waiter was the only negative.  He forgot about us when we got there & was very slow,"}
{"text":"Heard about this place for years... and for some reason, I thought this was a more upper class Mexican dining experience.  This place is very casual.... almost picnic table like setup, with one page laminated huge menus.  We ordered fish tacos and shrimp tacos and some guacamole and nachos.  Service was friendly and prompt.    Food was pretty good... nothing blew us away, but we had no complaints either.  We did notice that these folks do a fantastic job with birthday celebrations though.  I might just have to pop in here on my special day and have a little mexican party at my table.    A-OKay... I'd come back, sure, but I wouldn't automatically insert this place as my go to Mexican location."}
