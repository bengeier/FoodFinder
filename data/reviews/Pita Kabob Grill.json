{"text":"This place has been made from scratch. The owner was kind enough to come and talk to us and ask us about our experience. The place is beautiful, kitchen is open and big. Food tastes great and the outside patio is a great place to sit and have a drink with friends.  Very professional from owner to cooks, and is one of few places open after 9pm. (Open until 2am)"}
{"text":"Delicious, the restaurant is spotless and unlike most restaurants, your order looks like the menu picture! I have been several times and the quality has been consistent. A great beer selection, too!"}
{"text":"I wanted to food but it just wasn't very good.  Chicken was undercooked.  The pita was ripped.  Fries were okay."}
{"text":"Consistently delicious food and friendly service. They don't seem to really be open for breakfast though. I tried twice to get breakfast and they were not open despite the internet saying they were. They make the best falafel I have ever had."}
{"text":"This place ROCKS!  The food is amazing and so is their friendly staff. The Gyro is delicious! I Highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Family organized eatery. The nicest and original people ever. The food was HOT, FRESH, and Delicious."}
{"text":"Wow! Food was great! And Rommel was awesome.  Everyone in our party thought the food was exceptional. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"THIS IS PROBABLY MY FAVORITE MEDITERRANEAN GRILL IN PHOENIX. The head chef came out and talked with us about the different meats they serve and even made a sample shawarma beef and chicken, Just for us! The meat is so fresh and juicy! only had one disappointment.. he wouldnt divulge any information on how he makes his meat so tender."}
{"text":"Was looking forward to trying this new place.  Between my friend and I, we took several items home. The gyros plate had tasty but dry meat and rice, the hummus was good.  The cashier could not tell me the difference between the yellow or white rice offered. The falafel tasted very good.  The chicken Kabab and beef Kabob sandwiches were okay but I don't think we'll order them again. The grill man cooked only one item at a time, so 5 items took 15 minutes. The overhead menu shows a grilled tilapia pita sandwich.  At home I took it out of the plastic bag, the paper wrapped pita dripped with oil.  I brought it back the next day and spoke to the head cook.  He chided me for not driving back & returning it right away.  He then told me that it was not his fault that I did not read the paper menu which said it came with Italian dressing.  I asked him to look at it, dripping oil.  He replied that the heat of the meat makes the oil run.  Then he noticed that meat was salmon not tilapia.  When I told him that was wrong, he insisted that I show him my receipt (it said tilapia) I asked him to replace it without oil.  He grumbled but told the grill man to make it. The cashier made me go back to the counter to pick it up.  I ate it & it was good fish.  But the cook still felt the need to come over to the table to chide me again saying he had worked at Subway for years and 'everyone' knows Italian dressing runs.  He also threw in a \"I'm sorry\".  I was sorry that I ate there,"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite Mediterranean Restaurant because you get great food at a very good price. Pita Kabob Grill delivers all the faves with a tasty twist. It is bright, open, and great for eat in or take out. There is a wide selection of drinks at check out including sodas and a selection of wine, beer, and other adult beverages.   My favorite meal is breakfast because if you ask, the chef will grill your vegetables and choice of meat right in with the eggs which, served up on warm pita bread, make a healthy alternative to the same old same old. Give them a try and you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Very good chicken Schwarma and hummus. I have tried most of their meats and they are all delicious. The restaurant is very spacious and clean. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I think my review was deleted for whatever reason- may or may not have been the owners doing it, but I will write it again.  I went to this place not to long ago to give it a try as I have seen that it was somewhat new- I have not seen it around before and especially not in this part of town. So I gave it a chance and was divided on my opinion. The lady at the register who is the only employee I have seen was very rude and hostile, she was not friendly and she did not give off that she was trying to make friends- she looked like she wanted me to order and leave. Anyways she did not use any bad language, but I got my food, the gyros plate with the fries and had a mixed opinion.  The gyros itself was satisfactory, the vegetables were very fresh and good but the gyros lackd tzatziki sauce, they used sour cream instead. I am Middle Eastern and I have never once heard or seen that someone would use sour cream on a gyros and it was an unpleasant surprise since I do not like sour cream. The fries, the side, was by far some of the best fries I have ever tasted. Overall, the main plate, the gyros, is okay, the fries are amazing, and the service is lacking"}
{"text":"This place was great walked in very clean and welcoming the employees were all very nice and had great customer service! The food was the best part! There falafel was fresh and u can tell it was made from scratch food was better then pita jungle!  Would recommend for a great lunch!"}
{"text":"The food is delicious, and the owners/staff are always very friendly. I highly recommend trying Pita Kabob."}
{"text":"Finally! A Mediterranean restaurant close to our home. My daughter and I had dinner there tonight and it was delicious."}
{"text":"Well, the food was pretty good, but it seriously took 46 minutes to get our food... wasn't a big order, just 2 shwarmas and 2 little side salads... they would have gotten a 3 star from me, but 3 other people that got there after us, got their food before us!? And they weren't even busy, WTF??!?? There are plenty of other pita/shwarma places around that will get your food out WAY quicker than this place, including the dine-in restaurants!! So, personally, I'm not going back here, and I wouldn't bother if I were you..."}
{"text":"Flavorless chicken and rice. Chicken was like rubber. Small portions for your $$. Will not return."}
{"text":"It's a beautiful place, lots of selections, very clean, open late, and it's a good distance from my house but I bought the shwerma combo plate, the meat had a lack of flavor, the rice was a bit bitter,  the hummus could be better. Didn't like the Styrofoam plates feels like I'm in a high school cafeteria. The gyros however was pretty good. This place could be better. The folks are nice."}
{"text":"Was very happy to find out that they were open until 2am. The restaurant was very clean and the vegan options are out of this world! I highly recommend their falafel and hummus are absolutely amazing!"}
{"text":"Clean place with many choices of food! Good prices and friendly staff. They are open pretty late so it is perfect for me and my boyfriend to go smoke hookah and drink whine and eat some falafel. It has vegetarian food as well. The staff was really helpful and very nice wit explaining what they had because we were new she showed us their combo deals and what was in the food."}
{"text":"Extremely clean and very friendly workers. You can tell this is family owned and they are very passionate about making great food. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This is probably my best Mediterranean Restaurant in Arizona. Friendly staff, delicious food, and fast service. Would recommend it to my family and friends. A++"}
{"text":"Very disappointed. The flavors are off for what I expect Greek to trade like.  The hummus is strange.. thick and a citrus flavor.  The cucumber sauce seems like it was out of a bottle rather than fresh.  On the positive side, it is very clean and friendly.   Won't be back.. sometimes trying something new doesn't work out."}
{"text":"I ordered the beef kabob platter combo with the lentil soup. It was very good and I liked that it had a bit of everything. The portions were generous.  The staff was nice. I like the photos of all the food on the tv screens. Very helpful in choosing what to order. However, I would have liked fountain drinks and tabouleh but they didn't have either. It was a great place overall though. We will be back."}
{"text":"Best Mediterranean food in the valley!!!! Staff is extremely friendly. Ingredients are fresh and food is spectacular! I cant say enough good things about this place. We will be customers for life."}
{"text":"Great food at a great price, what more can I say.  Stopped here for dinner the other day, had the beef Gyro and the Kebob beef sandwich with a side of the hummus.  The gyro meat was well seasoned, and tasted very good.  The kebob was good, but could use a little more salt (personal preference I know).  They offer two types of bread, Greek and Arabic.  I was more partial to the Arabic bread, it had more of a chew which I enjoyed, while my wife preferred the Greek.  After spending time traveling the middle east when I was younger, it was a very satisfying experience and we will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Finally decided to give this place a second try. It has a solid 4 stars on Yelp and I figured enough time had passed for them to work out the kinks. It was a little after 1 pm. I am not sure if they get a lunch rush but the tables were a little dirty. Not noticable until you sit.   We got a chicken kabob sandwich, chicken gyro sandwich, and beef shawarma sandwich. I don't think the prices are as great as people claim. It's not expensive but not cheap. Sadly their chicken is still well under seasoned. The chicken gyro was ok as the vegetables and sauce gave a decent flavor. The chicken kabob was super bland. It has no taste to it. It's like they grab the chicken and just throw it on the grill. Surprisingly the beef shawarma was good especially in comparison to the chicken dishes.   All and all this place will stay at 3 stars. I don't know how it has so many 5 star reviews."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with a couple of my friends. The owner was very nice and took the time to explain the differences in the dishes. We each got something different. One got shawarma beef and chicken combo, one kabob beef and chicken combo and the other got souvlaki chicken and beef combo. All the food was so delicious and tasted fresh. Although it's out of the way for a couple of gals from Surprise. It's totally worth it!"}
{"text":"I went here excited about the possibility of having a close Mediterranean place to go to regularly. I took my family of 4 with me and had a Restaurant.com voucher for $15 off a $30 purchase. The owner refused to honor it saying that \"It ended in November, we only had a 3 month agreement with them.\" I tried to explain to him that it is a non-expiring voucher as stated ON THE VOUCHER. He still wouldn't honor it after seeing it in print. So we left. Real smart business guy, turned away potential regulars."}
{"text":"Some of the best Mediterranean food I've had in the valley!  Everything I've had has been super delicious!  The hummus, gyros, souvlaki, lentil soup, rice, all of it has been extremely flavorful, and the portions are perfect!  This place is meticulously clean, and the staff has always been very friendly.  Been here three times, and will most definitely be back!"}
{"text":"So good and fresh. The staff is so nice and great prices, very clean. Love this place! The crispy chicken salad is good and love the Greek dressing. Hummus is flavorful. Only place I really will enjoy a salad and fills me up. I like the combo alternatives because the falafel is yummy too."}
{"text":"Food was really good! Clean restaurant, service was a little bit of a downfall. It took a while to get the food out and all I ordered was a sandwich. Same with my friends. But I do think they were understaffed which is a lot harder on the workers, so that may be why it took a while."}
{"text":"I really liked this place! We tried two items- chicken and steak shawarma. I would recommend the chicken, hands down. This place may have the most perfect yellow rice I've ever tasted. Hummus is perfect also. Location is a little tucked away but keep your eyes peeled and you'll find it. It's worth it! Great hours. Our bill was $5.00 extra for a sprinkle of feta cheese and we weren't expecting it. That's the only bummer."}
{"text":"I highly recommend the beef kabob. This restaurant is family-run by some very friendly people. Extremely clean, open long hours, and presenting a large menu of Mediterranean food, which is a nice break from the other burger and pizza restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"I found this place looking for something healthy near my office. I had shawarma chicken platter it was delicious, filling, and priced well. Lots of the food is made in house and you can tell. The owner is super nice. You are able to phone in an order to save time since the food is made to order. My new favorite lunch location"}
{"text":"I love love love this place! The food is fantastic, the staff is friendly and I always feel like they remember me and greet me warmly.. I go there 2-3 times a week on night I'm too busy to cook.. I'd go 5-6 times if I could! Get the mixed combo, gyro beef and gyro chicken, you will not be disappointed! And their falafel is moist and delicious!!"}
{"text":"Excellent gyro, fantastic service, very clean and has an enjoyable atmosphere. I would definitely eat here again!"}
{"text":"I had the chicken gyro sandwich and it tasted great! The staff is really friendly and the service was good. It's a great place to go to if you're hungry in the middle of the night because they're opened till 2 am. I highly recommend giving this place a try."}
{"text":"Came here around 11:00pm and it seemed like they were about to close but i came and everything was off. The worker here came out (Steven) and he turned everything back on and started making my order. Man this guy here is the best. He recommended me some be Souvlaki Beef Platter and omg it looks great!!! Anyone trying grab something to eat come here and eat Awesome service and The perfect food you can get Thank you Steven You're an awesome dude"}
{"text":"Ordered two sandwiches. A falafel and beef sandwich. Both of them were burnt, and this is not the first time."}
{"text":"Serendipity brought me here on New Year's Eve because the place I wanted to order from was closed and PKG was open.  They were friendly and helpful, and the food...  Amazing!  This was my first taste of fresh (not canned) dolmas.  Wow.  I ordered the vegetable platter with dolmas, falafel, hummus, baba ganoush, and green salad.  It was so heavenly that this will probably become my regular order!"}
{"text":"The BEST food in the area...love the salads and Shawarma ...it's all excellent and for Din they have spirits too.  Breakfast all day..huge pita filled breakfast..very large portions..59th Ave and Thunderbird....the Only Way to Fly for good eats....try it.. you'll see..."}
{"text":"Good food and open late at night.    This is our favorite Mediterranean / Greek restaurant on the west side.   Flavoring is great and prices are very reasonable for what you get.  We have had several dishes - platters and salad. Gyros, chicken and beef are juicy and tender - flavored well. Falafel is crunchy on outside and moist inside.   Hummus and baba ganoush is quite good. So is the baklava. Lentil soup is especially good. Salad dressing tastes like a tahini dressing and went well with the salads we tried. Everything we have tried so far has been  outstanding and this will be one of our regular places to eat out."}
{"text":"I've seen this place while driving by on several occasions and decided it was time to try it out. They have good Mediterranean food. Their menu was straightforward and easy to understand. I had the Kabob Chicken Sandwich and it was delicious! Things here inexpensive and they also give student discounts if you show your school ID.  This place is super clean. Like, the cleanest restaurant I have seen. Everything is neat and sleek. Inside, there is plenty of room to walk around along with many booths and tables. There are a few tables outside as well.  The employees were nice and knowledgeable of the menu. They have good store hours too. The rewards program will give you $8 towards your purchase after you buy 7 lunches.  If you like Mediterranean food I would recommend this place for you to try out!"}
{"text":"They are friendly, but took very long to get your order, also food are good but bit the sandwich is little bit small compared to its price."}
{"text":"Chicken gyro is good. today they had the door open and it was quite warm inside the restaurant. Personally,  I would not be comfortable eating inside the restaurant. I think it's awesome that they are open until 2 a.m. you don't find that much around here."}
{"text":"Nice clean place for lunch and quick dinner. Food was fresh.  Enjoyed the selection-salads, platters and sandwiches.  We will be back. First time here and it is a newer restaurant.  It is in the back corner so I hope they are successful.  Great addition to the neighborhood"}
{"text":"Wife and I stopped in here Sunday afternoon for lunch and had a very nice time. The woman who helped us was very polite and friendly - we felt welcome right away. The dining area was clean and comfortable, but we chose to sit on their patio since it was a beautiful day - the patio is really nice, go enjoy it before it gets too hot :)  I had the chicken shawarma sandwich, my wife had the gyros chicken sandwich. Both were delicious. Excellent flavorful meat, fresh veggies, and really tasty bread. We opted for the combo option and chose falafel as our side - I liked their falafel a lot. It wasn't overly dense or dry, but also not crumbly. Spices were just right for my taste.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"I don't even know where to start with this place. I can't say enough about this place and I love it. The staff/management here are all so wonderful, kind and loving. They are family oriented and it shows in their hospitality. The restaurant is always super clean and the food always delicious. I am so happy this place opened up near me. If you haven't tried it yet you are missing out. I try to eat here at least once a week."}
{"text":"This food was outstanding! Had outdoor seating too, which is a plus for a nice date! The chicken and gyros meat were delicious. It's good for a low carb dinner, which is what I did. I can't wait to come back when not dieting. My girlfriend enjoyed the falafel as well and said it's the best she had in a while.   I will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Really great food and very nice owner. I had the falafel and loved it. The tahini is fantastic!"}
{"text":"Great food! Food is delicious and the pricing is excellent. We make an effort to go every week and help support this local business owner. Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"I work near by and saw they were having their grand opening so I decided to give it a try. I have the beef /lamb gyro and Fry's. Very good food and friendly staff. Definitely will repeat."}
{"text":"I am so happy I finally tried this place. The staff are friendly, the food is fresh and delicious, and the restaurant itself is immaculate. You can definitely tell the people who own Pita Kabob put a lot of heart into this restaurant. I can't wait to come back again for a fresh, healthy meal!"}
{"text":"This place is Aww-mazingThey have vegan and vegetarian options and even better they're open until midnight during the week and 2am on weekends! This is good if your drinkingand need something to eat other the Jack in the Crackor McDonal's."}
{"text":"Slow, Slow ,Slow! And Overpriced. OMG! So slow. $32 for three sandwiches, two fries and a beer. Ridiculous!  Won't be back. There are too many other really good Gyro places in the area that are way more reasonable. Should've gone to my favorite Chicago Gyro place on 59th and bell, Al's."}
{"text":"I feel as though 14 dollars was way to much money for what I received. I ordered a gyro \"platter\" and as you can see from the picture, I couldn't even make a gyro if I tried they're is probably 40 cents of gyro meet in this thing how the he'll does it cost over 14 bucks I didn't even get a drink. What a rip off I'll never go back to this place. Totally pissed"}
{"text":"The food is AMAZING! The restaurant is very clean. The atmosphere is casual. The staff were welcoming and friendly. Thank you Rommel for the awesome food! We are sure to come back!"}
{"text":"Pita Kabob Grill is a newly opened casual Middle Eastern Mediterranean Eatery that serves breakfast and stays open with late night hours. They offer a partial bar of beer, wine and airplane bottles of liquor.  I tried the Falafel Platter. The Falafels are the meatball texture kind and do have some herbs in them. I had my choice of hummus or babaganoush and when with the eggplant. The eggplant spread had an added smoke taste and the eggplant wasn't noticeable in the dip. They gave me a very large order of freshly cooked French Fries with my order and my choice of Greek Pita or Lebanese Flat bread. I picked the Lebanese Style Bread because you don't come across that too often. The Lebanese Flat Bread is similar to a flour tortilla here.  My husband ordered the Three Meat Platter. A Chicken Kabob, Beef Kabob, and Shawarma with Hummus. Our favorite was the Chicken. It didn't seem to have any added flavor but it did have a nice Char taste on the Chicken. The Hummus also doesn't seem to have much or any seasoning in it.  They do offer some interesting sauces that you don't often come by like Shatta Sauce (spicy red sauce). (that I forgot to ask for)  I give them an A-OK because I've tried worst and I've tried better.  The atmosphere is nice clean and airy. They also have a large screen TV for viewing.  Worth a try if your in the area."}
{"text":"Decent chicken kabob pita...the kabob chunks were way to big and should have been cut in half."}
{"text":"We love love love this place. It's such a calm and clean place, especially  at night. Nothing else is open thats going to be fresh. I love eating here. The staff is so nice. I don't mind happy people making us food. Happy kitchen happy food. Don't listen to any bad review. Seriously check them out you won't be sorry. I would never take the time the write a review."}
{"text":"Delicious food and great customer service!! Good portions and most importantly FRESH!! I had the chicken gyro yummy! - The only tiny issue is that they charge you for everything- chili paste, yellow peppers, jalapeños... You get the point! - other than that the food is worth every dollar! (:"}
{"text":"This is one of our go to spots when it comes to Mediterranean food. We love the food, the portion is good and it's always fresh and tastes good. There is Always parking spots available and their restrooms are always clean. Reason that I gave them 4 Star is that some of the employees can't speak English very well and they also could get some training on customer service. We have had times that they couldn't figure out how to split and order into 2 payments using 2 cards or no one acknowledged us after entering the restaurant for few minutes.  But the food has always been great. I always order the mix of beef and chicken kabob with white rice and hummus. I love it !  Also try the yogurt drink it's different but it tastes great, kinda salty but I love it.  Overall it's a great place and we will continue to go back."}
{"text":"The food is Devine, every time it is cooked perfectly and well flavored. The facility is beautiful and the staff is educational and friendly. I'm surprised this place is not busier. It's truly excellent and you won't be sorry!"}
{"text":"Drove by looking for a yummy lunch and this place did not disappoint! Friendly service and amazing food!!!"}
{"text":"Small Mediterranean restaurant tucked in the back of a bustling plaza in Glendale.   Walking into this space, it's clear it was well thought out and a quaint mom and pop shop (and I love mom and pop shops). Beautiful light wood floors, dark counters with granite countertops.   The entry way is super wide which let's folks order and others review the menu without feeling too crowded. The food is cooked fresh in front of you at the grill right by the entryway - the smells are amazing!  We ordered gyros, Greek fries, and hummus. The gyros were delish- you can taste how fresh the veggies are! The hummus is made on site and the Greek fries are perfect!! And I am a tough critic with Greek fries.   The chef came out and chatted with us to check on us about how our food and experience was. This is why mom and pop shops are the best- you may pay a little more but it's all about the service.   This place is open late, has outdoor seating (soon it'll be a full wrap around patio outside), and they have a full bar. If you're in the 'hood stop on in - you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"MMMM, yummy is what I can say about this place.  This place has great food. Very delicious.  The portion size is huge and we could of split it if we wanted to but we didn't because we all wanted to try something different.  Tables and chairs are clean. Small place but those are usually the best ones.  The food is made on demand and the staff is super friendly and will go out of the way to explain anything you want to know about the menu even taking the time to explain the difference on the rice they serve. That was a plus for me and they did it without making me feel stupid. I will definitely come back to this place!!  The food is tasty and has lots of flavor."}
{"text":"Beware! These five stars reviews are either fake or done by friends and relatives. I saw the good reviews and thought why not. First strange thing. Friday 5pm empty restaurant. Second we come in and go to counter and they lady just stares at us, no welcome or anything. Another customer came in right after so I let him go ahead. Once he was done I went to order and the lady took another person's order ahead of mine. I guess he works best door? Ok. Then the price came out higher than i expected. Well apparently the menu I was looking at she handed me was the \"old menu\" and the prices were now higher. (The same menus were everywhere). Then I was offered the combo which I declined. Then a few minutes later I came back to ask if I could add the three dollars for drink and fries. Was told too late. They can't ring up 3 dollars and give fries and a drink?  No. Food arrived. They didn't bring any plates extra for kids. And they told us to go to go to other side of restaurant for utensils. Had to go to counter to get plates. Asked for extra plates she brings one. When I say plates.. she gives me a strange look . No other customers inside now)  . The food was 40 bucks and was very average. Meat was dry and yellow rice. Not sure how they made it yellow. Couldn't be saffron. Two stars for food. One for service. Again gotta be fake reviews Yelp!"}
{"text":"Decided to swing by Pita Kabob Grill on a weekday around 1:00 pm to grab a quick lunch. There wasn't much of a crowd which was great and I was able to put my order in right away! I went with a falafel sandwich which came loaded with falafel, tomato, cucumber, onion, and lettuce. My order came out in a timely manner and held together really well (though it was more of an open faced pita than expected) while I drove home! Now in terms of taste, the falafel sandwich was really good! A bit on the salty side and lacking just a slight bit of acid that I like, but overall tasty as can be!  This location is pretty convenient -- aka go buy groceries at Safeway, then swing by and grab lunch or dinner on the way home! The cashier was friendly and the food was good~  I'll be back in the future for sure!"}
{"text":"Service took an hour to make our food. There  as 2 staff and they took their time making it. This was supposed to be a prompt service not a slow one. Me and a friend came to eat here because we just got out of a concert and there was nothing else to eat. I've been to many pita places before and this is by far the worse one I have been too. I don't think o will be coming back again."}
{"text":"Chose this place since it was open late, and soo glad we did.  Initially was expecting some quick late nite food partially prepared. We ordered the chicken schwarma platter and chicken kebab platter with baba ganoush, and everything was made fresh to order, even the side of salad.  They also gave a stamp card (like Dutch Bros) which i plan to fill up if the food stays as good as it was."}
{"text":"It's been really tough trying to find a good Mediterranean place where the food isn't dry and it's worth every penny. I was very satisfied with the food. The chicken is so good and tasteful. The falafel is my absolute favorite. I've tried many places and this falafel was the best I've had. And they have hookah outside too which is a nice finish."}
{"text":"This restaurant was a last minute selection for my birthday dinner. Based on some of the reviews my group of ten arrived and were pleased to see that they had enough tables towards the back that we could make a big table for us all.   Being tucked away in the Safeway plaza, and on a Monday night, I was pleased to see other families enjoying their meals. The decor was modern, yet subtle. Overall, I found it wasn't overbearing.   My wife ordered a chicken shawarma platter while I ordered the two meat platter (I got the chicken shawarma and beef/lamb gyro). Both of us got the yellow rice with tzaziki sauce and hummus.  I also ordered a side of Dolmas (stuffed grape leaves). This was where things faltered a bit. The chicken shawarma was flavorful yet the pieces were minuscule and dry, as if they were the last bits of larger pieces. Even the chopped pieces of chicken found in a mall Japanese hibachi stall made these look large. The same sizing came about with the gyro I received. Thankfully, they gave us quite a bit. The meat came on the rice which, as with the main protein, was flavorful yet dry.   The hummus was pretty tasty and smooth, better than a lot of prepackaged stuff found in the grocery store. However, my biggest issues came with the dolmas and tzaziki. I found the tzaziki was bland and just tasted like plain yogurt, no dill, cucumber, lemon or even olive oil. The dolmas were soggy, torn and tasted to be remade (maybe canned). I could be wrong, but I don't think so.   Beyond the decor, the real saving grace was the friendly and helpful staff. They were very nice and suggested some awesome beers for myself, my parents and in laws. If it weren't for that, I wouldn't think about trying it again. That said, it could have been an off day and will try once more. If better, I will update my review then."}
{"text":"Really good, fresh food and reasonable prices. The people here are very nice. You can tell they take pride in their food. Restaurant is very clean. Beef kabob platter was delicious and filling. It came with meat, rice, salad, choice of hummus or baba ganoush, and a sliced pita. Portions are generous. My husband said his beef kabob sandwich was great too. Looking forward to trying other menu items. I also noticed they open at 7am and have breakfast options.  This place is kind of hidden in the NW corner of the Safeway plaza, behind the Barro's. Worth seeking out. Counter service. They brought the food to the table. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I thought this wasn't coming up on Yelp, but it is!  Great gyro sandwich and the best beef shawarma I've had!!  No fountain drinks (yet), which was a little bit of a downer, but the quality and taste of the food made up for it more than enough! Shawarma was certainly quality and fresh meat.  They mentioned it was never frozen, seasoned and carved up in house!  Also, they serve alcohol and that is another plus for random late days when a drink is needed with a meal.  Place is still very clean and has a new restaurant vibe to it.  Someone, perhaps owner, still comes up and checked in to see how food was and took the time to chat and answer questions.  They know what they are doing here, best place around for when you are craving Mediterranean/Greek."}
{"text":"Awesome food .best part about this place is that they are usually open till midnight. Most of the Mediterranean places closes by 8-9. Food is delicious. I love the chicken kabob plater."}
{"text":"Honestly pretty good especially for late night fixes, definitely call in if you want something super late so you can make sure they are open still! But to have good food that late, so worth it!"}
{"text":"I have to say the staff was very friendly and I have eaten Middle Eastern, Greek, Turkish, Iraqi, Palestinian, Jordanian etc. food all over the valley and this place is on par with the best.  There are many vegan and vegetarian options here as well so everyone in the family can get what they really like.  Healthy eating at its finest.  Portions and prices are very fair.  Feed family of 4 for less than $30."}
{"text":"BEST HUMMUS I HAVE EVER HAD. My fiancé and I have driven past this place so many times and it did not disappoint when we finally tried it. Everything was made on the grill right after ordering, and the place is SPOTLESS. They told us about the sauces that are homemade, you can tell they take much pride in the food they make.  Can't wait to eat here again!"}
{"text":"This Greek place is in walking distance which is seriously dangerous. The only reason they are not getting 5 is because I was highly disappointed with their hummus.  It seemed like it was lacking salt and flavor but everything else was simply delicious. The place is brand new and beautiful, and everyone is really nice. Odd to not have a soda machine and hopefully that could be an option at some point but it's worth the trip! I had the kabob beef and gyro convo with yellow rice and I almost bought 2 because I fee like I need lunch the next day. Very VERY good!"}
{"text":"Awesome service!! Oh and the food looks just like the pictures that they use for marketing; go figure...you actually get what they advertise. The food is delicious and always fresh and hot. The atmosphere is laid back and chill. The restaurant is super clean as well; this is always a plus as you are eating from this establishment. Keep up the great work."}
{"text":"Amazing food and open until 2 am! Amazing hummus, pita, and falafel. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"The management is very nice and welcoming, the food is average.   Nothing stood out to be better than my usual spot."}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem. Nice location, very good staffs and awesome food at reasonable price. It was our first visit, the person at the counter was kind enough to talk to us and explain things to us since we were new to there. He did offer us some falafel and I must say it was unbelievably delicious. Very much satisfied with the order of chicken kabob n chicken shawarma platter."}
{"text":"This place is awesome and open late! Excellent hummus and gyro platter. Big variety on the menu! Can't wait to go back and try more next time. Fast service, clean place and friendly staff! It was empty at 9:00 pm but more people came in while we were there. They also have a liquor license and beer and wine if you need an adult beverage! :)"}
{"text":"This place is a good place for gyros. I ordered the cheese sticks and the jalapenos poppers with my order. The gyros were pretty good with plenty of onion, lettuce and cucumber. The tzataziki sause is made with yogurt which have a different taste than others who use sour cream. The portions were spot on and would come back."}
{"text":"My family and I have frequented many middle eastern restaurants here in the valley and this is by far the very best one! The food was very fresh and delicious and the vibe in the restaurant was excellent!!  We will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"This is the third time I've visited this amazing Greek restaurant. Every time it has been immaculately clean, the service is friendly and prompt and the food is nothing short of spectacular. They serve all the traditional Greek fare, and they do it very well. The Gyros are the best I've found in the valley and the lentil soup is beyond parallel. Definitely will return, and often!"}
{"text":"So we were planning on going to Jimmy Johns for customer appreciation after our track workout and after seeing the line out the door we realized the pita place around the corner so we gave it a try. And....so good!!!! Nice people, delicious and fresh food!!!! Would highly recommend to everyone!!!"}
{"text":"This place is one of the most welcoming places I have been in a very long time. I am pregnant and trying to start eating healthier and I would go here for the salad alone. Everything was very fresh. I'm pretty sure they cooked the meat after we ordered it. I was already a picky eater but this pregnancy has made it 10 times worse and I literally have no complaints about anything. The service was perfect and the staff was so accommodating. I ordered the souvlaki chicken and beef and gyro beef/lamb on yellow rice with hummus and salad. First time trying it and it most definitely won't be the last."}
{"text":"Not too impressed.  I just tried the new Pita Kitchen(which was amazing) that opened on 67th the other day so I thought I would give this place a shot too.  No comparison.   This place was clean and friendly staff but the food was bland, very little meat in gyro, more lettuce than anything.  No soda machine so a can of soda was $1.65. The amount that our bill came to with two gyros, an appetizer and 2 drinks I could of went to Pita Jungle for that price.  The wait for our food was pretty long too.  Overall the quality and quantity is not worth it to me to ever go back."}
{"text":"We arrived in Arizona after a long day at 11pm. We were so happy to find a quality place open at this hour. The Owner/Chef greeted us and prepared our delicious and authentic meal. Everything was fresh tasting and made with love. We will be back whenever we are in the area."}
{"text":"I hadn't been here for a while, and now I realize what I was missing.  The food is always fresh, never frozen, just the right blend of ingredients so you can taste exactly what is in it, and homemade pita bread.  This place is very clean and service is wonderful.  It is well worth a visit for the prices you pay."}
{"text":"Place is clean, open and inviting. The owner/chef came out to greet us and asked how our food was.   Told him we could taste the freshness in the food we ordered and mentioned we have been to other similar establishments that did not come  close to the freshness and taste of his food.   He mentioned he makes his food from scratch and that soon they will be opening an outside frontend patio for us to enjoy during the cooler weather soon approaching.  We thanked him for joining us and making us feel welcomed.   Since then, I've been back 3 more times.  This place is a hidden gem."}
{"text":"Food is excellent. Growing up in the Middle East and knowing what authentic Mediterranean food should taste like; this place is spot on!!  Friendly people. Very welcoming and warm.   Impeccably clean. Wonderful atmosphere.   We will definitely be return customers."}
{"text":"The menu has many options! The staff is very ind and attentive and the restaurant is  very clean."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped by on our way home to grab a quick bite to-go. What I noticed first was how clean the restaurant was! Absolutely spotless and we really liked the way their menu was set up. The menu has a picture of every dish they have, making it SO hard to choose because EVERYTHING looks so good! We decided to go with classic Lamb Gyros.   Usually, when I order a gyro from other places, the pita ends up ripping from overfilling and gets annoyingly soggy from the tzatziki sauce... I didn't have that experience here.   My gyro was hot, fresh and the pita didn't rip! AND no watery tzatziki sauce mess!! We both thought the gyro was delicious. Thank you!  So glad we have a great Mediterranean spot so close to home"}
{"text":"Great place! Clean, friendly, great food, I especially like that they offer a side of falafel with their combo!  I had the beef Shawarma sandwich, it was delicious!"}
{"text":"Large portions, great price, and tastes amazing. I've had some great Mediterranean food when I lived in Detroit. Falafel is on point. Lentil soup is wow. Great staff. We'll be back."}
{"text":"We went with our two kids and the manager Saba was very welcoming. The food was simply great and the set up is awesome. The food was of superior quality compared to any other Mediterranean restaurants. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I have to say this a a very clean restaurant which is the first thing I look at. Prices are good not expensive at all and the food is great. The couple there are very nice people I felt very welcome and would definitely recommend to stop by and check out this spot"}
{"text":"One of my New favorite places to eat! My family and I tried them out at the beginning of January and have been back two times since. The people who work there are very sweet and the restaurant itself smells amazing and is immaculately clean. I love the fact that they have long hours and that they give us a healthy alternative to greasy fast food when we eat on the run during the week.  We have tried the chicken and the beef gyros and kebab sandwiches which are very very tasty and fresh. I have also tried the lentil soup and a Greek salad as a side and both are also very good. We will continue to come back to this place and hope that this is the place that sticks around."}
{"text":"Loving the gyro platter, it's so good. I found this new local Mediterranean restaurant and decided to try it. Very good food and the ownership cares about the quality of the food. It's worth trying."}
{"text":"I love this place because of the cleanliness, quality and taste of food! I've been here a few times and there was great service every time. Recently, husband and I both ordered the gyro sandwich meal and it was delicious. I love the fact that they serve clean, freshly prepared food. Way better than the other unhealthy restaurants around the area. Great place to hang out also. Check it out!"}
{"text":"Service is on point. This location is beautiful, with a modern ambiance. The menu inside is diverse, clear, direct and easy to read. If you're a regular you can earn rewards and get a free lunch ($8) after seven visits.  Try their Backlava!   I ordered a beef gyro combo with their delicious green tea, and mozzarella sticks. Also a \"fried crispy chicken\" combo meal with fries.  The gyro was delicious and big, the meat in it was tender, and flavourful. It was topped with plenty of fresh lettuce, cucumber, onion and tomato. The pita was delicious as well, overall great choice! If you make it a combo you can choose a side (soup, falafels, fries, or Mediterranean salad).  I'm not too sure what I think about the fried chicken, it looked and tasted a bit... unconventional.  It was a bit dry and tough; the fried that came along with it were delicious!   The mozzarella sticks appetizer was also a great choice, delicious!   I was going to order pizza, but I'm glad I came here instead. What a satisfying meal!"}
{"text":"Excellent freshly made food with the most delicious hummus I've ever had! Great menu options with a full bar and hookah for those who enjoy it! Open late which is great too! Definitely worth a trip and highly recommended A+"}
{"text":"I found this place on YELP, and decided to give it a try based on a few of the reviews I read and the pictures of the inside.  Food was really good!  The service was good, I didn't expect much when by 1:00 I was the only patron in there, but they had a decent crowd when I arrived and everybody in there was smiling and eating which, if you ask me, is a good sign for a restaurant owner.  I think a few other menu options, adding appetizer to a salad dish for a discounted price instead of a \"combo\" meal would've earned a 5 star.  I worry about their location being easy to pass by without stopping, but if you are close don't miss it.  You'll be glad you stopped!"}
{"text":"We tried this place and it was delicious. Courteous staff, very clean , modern dining area. Food was fresh and made to order. Most food prep was done wile you watch, ingredients were fresh and cooked to perfection. Staff was helpful with menu and explained everything to us. The owner came out and spoke with us to make sure everything was good. we highly recommend this place, we will be back."}
{"text":"Got to meet the owner Ramel who was very nice. The food is cooked fresh and delicious. I brought it home and my family enjoyed all of it"}
{"text":"Excellent food!  And great service!  I had another restaurant fall through on a pickup for 17 people (was dropping off lunch at a potential clients office).    I called and within about 45 minutes had potters of amazing food m, and everyone at the office was thrilled.    Definitely check this place out.  They're great!"}
{"text":"The food is so good, so fresh! The owner was so nice and explained the food to us and the ingredients in the sauces he makes himself. Offered us water while we waited for our food to go, small gesture of kindness that we appreciated. One thing I also noticed was how clean and kept the business was, it was a great experience. We're new to this part of Phoenix and now we have a go to! You won't be disappointed and the prices are so fair!"}
{"text":"We ordered the lamb sandwich and the chicken shawarma and the beef kabob platter  All were freshly prepared in order and were very very good.  Great balance of flavors."}
{"text":"Super clean place. Which is a plus. Amazing food and plus they have desserts. Great prices and open till 2 am. They are opening a patio soon."}
{"text":"Awesome little place, highly recommend stopping in. Extremely friendly here.  Our new place to come for Mediterranean style food"}
{"text":"My absolute favorite Mediterranean restaurant close to home! My go-to order is always the Chicken Shawarma platter, which comes with white or yellow rice, Baba ghanoush or Tzaziki sauce, hummus, pita bread, and a small salad mixture. Everything included in the platter compliments well together and the portion is more than fulfilling. The location is a little unfortunate, hiding this little gem behind all the big branded food spots. Overall, this place is a must try if you haven't already, it'll exceed your expectations."}
{"text":"Ordered the chicken it was real good  Come in to eat inside ordered the chicken again   Waited 20min and they gave me lamb don't understand when I tied to ask they all went to the back of the kitchen"}
{"text":"Went in not busy 1 person waiting. they had Ordered.Ordered fafeal salad with feta that cost $1 extra.    5 minutes togo another person comes in orders that order goes out in 2 minutes no kidding still waiting, he ordered at same counter. Another 10 minutes for my salad to go, take to work guess what no FETA cheese. $12'00 for salad .AWFUL Chickpeas so over cooked they crumble like dust. There are so many better Mediterranean restaurant like sabos. Don't bother with this dirty place noted either people committed on how clean was there on 19 Feb tables were dirty like all of them,door wE sticky mess."}
{"text":"Pleas make sure that you know your own store hours. We drove all the way to this restaurant because incorrect info is on here regarding hours. And we arrived a couple hours prior to supposed closing time."}
{"text":"Great Greek food for a good price. They make everything fresh, and, their Chicken Shwarma sandwich is to die for, especially when you add feta cheese to it! Staff is super friendly and helpful, the place is always clean. It takes a little while to get your food if they are busy, but, again, this is because it is all made fresh in front of you. I'm so blessed to have this place right by my house!!"}
{"text":"This place is new, I love greek food and having been trying out places and have hated most of them. This one I LOVE !!! Ok so when you go in keep in mind they are newer, give them a bit of a break. They are still learning. I have to say the place is bigger than I thought and super clean. There are so many choices and I am totally unfamiliar with a lot of stuff but they give you a nice menu to keep. I ordered the chicken souvlaki combo with yellow rice. It was amazing, the chicken was cooked perfectly, the rice was flavorful, hummus decent. The French fries were perfect. One thing I can recommend if they are reading this. Add numbers to your menu in the store and the paper one so things go faster. I didn't see a soda fountain which is odd but they do have cold soda cans. Good amount of food they give you. Most satisfying takeout meal I've had in a while."}
{"text":"Love this place! Here every Thursday and their food and service never fails. Their prices are fair for the amount and quality of the food-- definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Ordered a side salad that had more dressing than the veggies themselves... the place was hardly busy... how did they not notice?"}
{"text":"I would give them 0 stars if possible! The food isn't the problem it is the employees and the owners. We ordered $50.00 worth of food to go a couple weeks ago got home and part of the order wasn't in the bag. I called right away and the girl said she knew she had forgotten it and she was sorry so no problem right?! She said she would leave a note at the register and took down my info. I told her we wouldn't be coming back that night because we have a newborn and would just get it with our next order. So fast forward to tonight... spoke to 3 different people all asking me to explain the story again then asked if I had a receipt?! Are you serious? No I don't have a receipt this wasn't my screw up and was told by your staff it would be taken care of no matter when I returned! Never again."}
{"text":"Some of the worst Mediterranean food we've had around town. The only thing that was good was the fatoosh salad and the dolmehs. The tzatziki sauce tasted just like plain yogurt mixed with a few chunks of cucumbers. The hummus and baba ganouj pretty much tasted the same, bland. The beef/lamb gyro was dry and tasteless. The yellow rice was also flavorless and undercooked. Awful for the amount of money, far better places for less."}
{"text":"Quite honesty the best gyro I've had in Arizona so far. I hit up a different joint every week and this is this first that has me wanting to come back.  Spent a while chatting with the very personable owner about the food and hookah they also offer (they use coconut coals) that I fully plan on coming back and enjoying tonight."}
{"text":"Food was so delicious! My bf had the shawarma plate and I had a gyro wrap. We both enjoyed our meals soooo much. Fried zucchini was also great. Loved the inside - spacious and clean. Staff was nice! Thank you!"}
{"text":"First time here and the owner ran through the menu with me and was genuinely enthusiast about his recipes and the restaurant. Fantastic customer service and delicious food!"}
{"text":"Discovered this gem yesterday and have since eaten here twice already. The food is fresh and they are very generous with the salad toppings. They have a wide variety of protein options--tilapia, salmon, shawarma, kabobs. You can make any dish a meal with falafel, which is a huge plus in my book. It's tucked in the northwest corner of the complex, so kinda hard to find."}
{"text":"The place was spotless and the food was really fresh and flavorful. Enjoyed my visit will be back"}
{"text":"Couldn't decide on where to have lunch and noticed Pita Kabob Grill had good ratings and well deserved! Was my first time and employee was helpful in helping me make a decision. Place is spacious, quiet, and clean. Went with the classic shawarma chicken sandwich and the food came out in a timely manner. Super good! Glad i discovered this place, will be returning to try more!"}
{"text":"The food here is made fresh daily and everything on the menu is good. This is s friendly family owned restaurant. The humus with falafel appetizer and the beef soulvaki are my favorites. The lentil soup is very good also."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem in Glendale. It serves authentic and tasteful Mediterranean food with minimal wait time. The owner and staff is always welcoming. The falafel sandwich is perfect for the vegans out there. Their crispy chicken, chicken and beef shawerma are also delicious items on the menu. We have also catered from here and their prices are very reasonable and they do a wonderful job."}
{"text":"Not sure I was enamored as much as the other two reviewers but to be fair it is new and they have a big menu so I will try again. They also serve breakfast. The place is large but very industrial looking. Not sure if the open roof look was the look they were going for or maybe it is unfinished. The place was very hot and I never complain about that. I leave my house on 85. I ate fast and left I was so uncomfortable. So some things to work on, for sure. Yes, a soda fountain would be great.   I got a Chicken Schwarma sandwich and i have no idea what the issue was. All the ingredients were very fresh, looked great, and cooked correctly but it tasted like air. No taste whatsoever, very bland. Maybe I just like my greek food more spicy? Still I think the place is worth checking out maybe other dishes are more their speciality? The people working here are very, very nice. That's a plus.  I will go again and try something else and update my review."}
{"text":"This is a great place for pita and kabobs.   Third visit here and the food is consistently good. The baklava is authentic in that you can detect pistachio and it is not overly sweet.   Always very clean,  very friendly. Portions are great and the ambience is quite nice.    I would like to see them add a soda fountain for the fifth star.   They can expect my business again."}
