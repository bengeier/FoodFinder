{"text":"Service was somewhat slow but the main issue i had involved the food. 3 of our 4 dishes were pretty bland and serving size not all the big. Also the water had a very bad taste to it. Sitting outside was very noisy.  Just ended up being disappointed and wish we went elsewhere."}
{"text":"L'ambiance est familiale et agréable. Nous avons tous pris une pizza, la pate était trop dure, et la saveur très commune. Jai commande une pizza contenant de la viande alors que je ne mange pas de viande. La serveuse a gracieusement, accepte de me faire une autre commande, et ma dit quelle me chargerait 50% pour la pizza...mesquin surtout que jetais accompagnée de clients réguliers de la place."}
{"text":"Nous avons été très bien accueillis à ce restaurant. Nous avions réservé, mais, comme une table s'était libérée juste avant notre arrivée, ils nous ont placé sur le petit balcon qui donne une belle vue sur le canal et sur le lac.  Le repas était vraiment succulent et le service hors pair! Je le recommande à tous! Nous avons passé une excellente soirée de fiançailles! :)"}
{"text":"Shocking experience. My wife's meal was incorrect not once but twice! We were made to feel like we were bad customers for asking for the meal we ordered. When the correct meal came out, the capicollo was intentionally poorly cut, as if to punish us. I advised that I was very surprised at the experience. The cowardly manager sent the poor server to deal with me instead of showing any leadership and coming out."}
{"text":"Ahhh, Friday night, first real warm day of the year, Terrasse, significant other and old school Italian restaurant...soothing for the soul.   Far from the downtown or Old Montreal \"spots\", family run business.  Honest food, good service and you can stroll along the Lachine Canal to walk off the copious meal.  Strongly recommend the linguini con funghi.   Vitello also very good.  Hadn't been here in a long while, special place for my GF as she used to come here for years with her family. Last second suggestion (literally) as I swerved to take the exit, as we were rather making our way for a night in town...but she suggested this place and certainly did not regret it!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Monday night with a coworker who lives in the area.  This is a good location - right opposite the park and waterway.  Perfect for walking off a big meal after dinner!  We sat outside on the upper deck - much better than the tables on street level.  Service was excellent from Laura.  She was friendly, attentive and dead-on with her recommendations.  She also accommodated my coworkers request to make the gnocchi with alfredo sauce instead of marinara.  I had a caprese salad - the cheese was not buffalo mozzarella, but rather a more firm cheese that also begins with a B.  For my main plate, I had a nice serving of Veal Picatta Al Limone.  Three perfect pieces of veal in a scrumptious lemon butter sauce.  It went nicely with the side of fresh vegetables (broccoli, cauliflower, red peppers).  For dessert, we had a lemon italian ice.  Perfect for two already too full people to split!  Overall, this is a good restaurant that I would not hesitate to come back to.  It was packed for a Monday night.  They also appear to be able to handle large groups because there was a business dinner inside with around 30 people at long tables."}
{"text":"Great place, menu but service was a little slow. My mouth was watering for the food. Excellent."}
{"text":"Great restaurant! We were staying by the airport for the night and il Fornetto was the right choice. I ordered the Veal Parmigiana and started with the Fried Calmari -- both were exactly on point. The experience of sitting outside while dining here was fantastic. I would highly recommend you try this place if you're in the area. Everyone I was with enjoyed their dish! YOU SHOULD GO."}
{"text":"Very cute terrace on canal lachine with nice flowers and ambiance. Ordered the fantasia pizza was delicious!!! Came with a spicy sauce. Fried calamari very good as well. Waitress friendly and good service.Was a hot day filled are glasses with water often!"}
{"text":"Great location with street meter parking. Terrace is nice with view of waterway. Staff is friendly and knowledgeable. Fast service."}
{"text":"I booked 2 tables on the 2nd floor to accommodate a group of 20 relatives during the lunch hour. Our waiter met every request with a smile, our food was served in a reasonable time and everyone left extremely satisfied with their order. Also, the view from the dining room on the canal and river complemented the experience perfectly. I will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"We dined outside across from the canal. The menu .... it was hard to choose ,but we did ...veal scallopini, steak done to perfection, mushroom pasta delicious this is a great little venue in LaChine I wouldn't miss it. The waiter was fantastic and the wine was good too"}
{"text":"The heartbreak! We were so excited to dine here and thought we were lucky that a table on the terrace had just opened up, little did I know we should have kept walking.  The place was full and bustling, the server was kind, but that was the high point of the meal. We split a beef carpaccio, at $24/portion for an appetizer. The portion was big enough considering they piled enough salad to help fill the plate, the problem is that the carpaccio had been left to sit on ice or something, resulting in it being watery and flavorless.   Our mains (two types of veal scallopini were meager portions served with minimal vegetables (literally, one piece of potato, one piece of cauliflower, same for broccoli) and a flavorless sauce. We had to ask for another sauce just to try and make it worth eating. The dish was a total rip off with nothing of substance to justify the price or the time we waited for our meals.  In the end, $150 for a low end bottle of wine and flavorless carpaccio and veal. We both left the restaurant disappointed and STILL HUNGRY. Incredibly disappointing and entirely a waste of money considering the quality of restaurant available a block away."}
{"text":"I would consider this one of the best Italian restaurants in the city. Authentic tasting and the pizza was done properly. The lasagna was very tasty and perfectly layered with thin fresh pasta.. The view of the water is also very nice from the restaurant, and though we say inside, I would imagine that the terrace would be a lovely date setting. I also really enjoyed the waiter's recommendation of wine, I felt that he really knew how to recommend both based on the meal and what we told him we like - so A+ for that."}
{"text":"If you're looking  for a big restaurant, forget it but, if you're looking for a cozy, warm, friendly place, where the people take the time to have a word with their customers, this is the place to go. I'll try to resume my experience in three steps 1- the place itself is situated in the side of the river, wonderfull view! You look at the place and everything is spotless and the smell, wood burning in the oven? What can you ask more? 2- service: greeted by the manager, place by the owner just there you feel you're important. The waitress (marie-soleil) even if she was busy as hell took the time to have a word with every customer at her table. Friendly, smiling and helpful in our choice of dish. 3- the food itself: I've worked in the restaurant business for years and I can tell you this: this food was awesome. Plate and glasses spotless, serve hot, freshly made not like the frozen food or crappy pasta you're going to get in others place Congrats il fornetto, you've got someone hooked"}
{"text":"J'ai eu l'occasion d'essayer ce restaurant avec quelques amis alors que nous étions en promenade au bord du canal Lachine. La section terrasse est agréable avec une vue splendide sur le bord de l'eau.  J'ai n'ai rien à reprocher au service, le personnel était accueillant et ils avaient un bon sens de l'humour.   Le menu est raffiné et fût à la hauteur des nos attentes. Nous avons manger des pizzas gastronomique à croûte mince , de format individuel et nous avons tous adoré.  Les prix sont élevés ... même pour les pizzas qui sont entre 15$ et 27$ mais il s'agit d'une qualité de pizza que l'on ne retrouve pas partout.  Je recommande cet endroit :)"}
{"text":"We went to this restaurant some time ago (before the smoking ban in Montreal) but now the opportunity is up to review on Yelp, I couldn't resist.   I booked a table at Il Fornetto for our wedding anniversary and at the time my wife was around 7 months pregnant. When I called I made strict instructions that the table would be in a non-smoking area.  When we arrived we were greeted and taken to our table. The host was obviously completely blind and stupid because within one minute of us sitting down the large party on the table right next to us finished their meals and all lit up cigarettes! When I asked why we were in the smoking section he looked stunned and couldn't understand what the problem was (my wife was obviously pregnant)  We had to get up, move tables but still the non-smoking tables were in the same area as the smokers, who incidentally were wearing t-shirts and some were wearing baseball caps. They obviously knew the waiters and staff. Really classy!  I honestly can't remember the food and we left quite quickly as soon as the bill arrived. I wouldn't recommend this restaurant to anyone."}
{"text":"Perfect lunch spot on a sunny day. We had the pizza, and the prawns. Delicious food, + fast & pleasant service. Only negative was a pesky wasp intrigued by our food. With a view of the water, and cyclists going by, we felt for a moment that we were back in Europe. Lovely! :) thanks :)"}
{"text":"Magnifique restaurant situé dans un endroit élégant. Service rapide et courtois. Très belle ambiance et prix raisonnables. Parfait pour un tête-à-tête."}
{"text":"Jolie decoration , la saveurs des assiettes sans surprise .. mais contente de ma petite salade cesar à cause du volume satisfaite et mini terrasse toujours agreable."}
