{"text":"Tried this place for the first time and will definitely be back soon!!! Came in for breakfast and got the huevos rancheros, the dish was delicious,  great service and very friendly staff. This place is a must try !"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to eat Mexican food, it is very authentic, the atmosphere of the establishment is great. It is my family's favorite place to eat in the valley, not only is the food great but the waiter, Jose. He enlightens our visit and we actually thought he was the owner, but he makes every visit a great encounter. All of his recommendations of what to eat and drink are never a disappointment. We've also left before because he  wasn't working that day. Overall it's a great restaurant with great food and hospitality."}
{"text":"really great lil hole in the wall Mexican food. the chilaquiles are awesome. careful tho if you don't like super spicy, cause they can make them hot! flautas are also delish. oh, and the micheladas are a must! awesome service, very friendly staff"}
{"text":"This place is really delicious.  I am from out of town and found it on yelp.  Only been here about 15 months and they have really dialed in some delicious Mexican fare.  Some of the best Mexican food I've had in a good number of years.  I got the relleno which was a poblano and it came with refried beans that disappeared way too quickly, rice and an amazing delicious salad garnish - I don't know quite how to describe it, except to say go in and enjoy it! The wait staff was excellent and courteous and I hope this place has great success, as I want to continue coming back to enjoy the rest of the menu!  Thank you yelpers!"}
{"text":"The food was great. Service was great - we had to wait a bit for the food but owner was apologetic and took 5% off our bill. It seemed a crowd walked in all at the same time and they cook everything fresh to order. The guacamole was so good. The tacos delish and the cilantro salad was a yummy plate of goodness. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Look no more.. I found my mammas cooking and here in midtown! Great staff, pleasant polite and welcoming. Food was better than expected! Found my new spot!! Bringing everyone I know!! Foodie Heaven!"}
{"text":"Was greeted promptly and all the service and attention was A+. The mole was tasty in its depth of flavor. Still prefer the chicken shredded.  Definitely worth return visits. The rest of the menu looks as inviting"}
{"text":"Flavorful green chicken tamale  & beans on point! The chilaquilas...cold, pile of chips topped with green sauce seemed more like Nachos. Server brought out a 2nd order since my 1st was too cold,  but that one also was cold.  I was not charged for the cold dish. I appreciated that so much the tip got SWOLE! Only had the opportunity to see the breakfast menu,  so I must go back for lunch or dinner to give them another review, redemption lol."}
{"text":"Had lunch here. Server was attentive & friendly. Food was good, but surprisingly pricey for lunch: paid $40 for two of us with no drinks.   Presentation was colorful & artsy -- definitely a cut above.   Guacamole with cheese sprinkled on top & warm-from-oven chips was our favorite -- excellent! -- $9.95.   Consider splitting the guacamole & chips ordering a taco for a budget-friendly option."}
{"text":"My brother recommended this mid-town restaurant as his new favorite Mexican food place, and are we ever glad he did!  We were seated and presented with ice water immediately by our fabulous server, Jose R.  He shook our hands on greeting and was just wonderful throughout- always attentive but never hovering.  And the food! We shared the carne asada/chorizo plate and the fillet relleno.  Both were tasty, unique and beautifully presented.  But I must also mention the hand-crafted margaritas.  They were the perfect accompaniment to the entrees.  Treat yourself and try Presidio."}
{"text":"The best breakfast I have ever eaten. I was passing through town on my way to LA and stopped here for some huevos rancheros and an horchata, after which I cruised the neighborhood looking for real estate so I could fantasize about living closer to this restaurant.   The smell of roasted chiles hit me when I first walked in, and the sauces delivered on that promise and so much more. My breakfast mate had tamales and eggs, and I was licking the red chile sauce off his plate like a farm animal after I had finished the roasted salsa that had been on my eggs, which were perched atop crisp homemade tortillas with a secret, minimal layer of cheese underneath. The refritos were more velvety than a 70s dinner tux. The chorizo home fries were another whole come to Jesus moment.   After this experience, I'm really not interested in eating any other food in my entire life but Presidio Cocina, but sadly, that will not be practical."}
{"text":"first time here and I loved it! the food is the best food I've had here in AZ. I'm from Texas and have been longing for great mexican food and this is the place!!!! the wait staff is so friendly and professional. I would highly recommend this place to anyone. watch the salsa it's a little spicy but worth the pain."}
{"text":"Just delicious.  Make sure to try the guacamole, the best I've ever had.  Everything seemed fresh and authentic.  Will return next time back in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Just had the huevos rancheros... delicious! The setting is modern, clean, and the staff is friendly. Simple authentic Mexican food at the right portion and price.  Perfect walking distance across from the hospital if you don't want to eat \"hospital food\"."}
{"text":"Really really good food  Don't pass this up ... really nice owner Will definitely be back ... maybe tomorrow"}
{"text":"This is a  fabulous pace for authentic Mexican food. Service is above and beyond. Lucy the chef doesn't cook with oils only butter! Beans are the best I've had,  no lard used."}
{"text":"Amazing quality food. Friendly staff. Clean atmosphere. Close to St. Joseph Hospital. Everything I would want at a Mexican restaurant is on their menu (except chimichangas).   I had the chilaquiles with red sauce. With overeasy eggs and a side of beans. So many flavors, it was almost overwhelming. The portions were huge too. Will definitely be making this a regular spot"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Their breakfast is home cooked and they make you feel as if your home! Food absolutely melts in your mouth, must try! I recommend the tamale comes with two eggs beans topped with queso fresco and a tamale.  amazingly great! Must try! Open Breakfast lunch and dinner! Good place to bring a girl out on a date"}
{"text":"We are so lucky to live within walking distance. This place totally impresses us every time. The margaritas are blessedly the real thing without mixer. Sangria excellent. The food is fresh and delicious. We love everything we have tried. The Pizole is fabulous. Friendly service. Reasonable prices. Super place."}
{"text":"I had the fish, pollo and carnitas tacos. They were excellent. Friendly service, clean kitchen and reasonable prices. Highly suggested!"}
{"text":"This place makes the best chilaquiles in town, and even though they have them in their breakfast menu they're always so nice to make them anytime I walk in, even if they're serving lunch or dinner.  So Awesome!! If you want some really delicious and authentic Mexican food this is the place you need to be at!! Thanks again for great service and the best chilaquiles."}
{"text":"We live in Willo and discovered this one night when walking and man were we glad we came in! The food is amazing and the service has been great each time we have stopped in. This was our third visit and if it's possible the food gets better! All the food is very fresh and flavorful. The spicy shrimp appetizer is SO good, we have yet to be disappointed. Portions are generous as well- fajitas are a favorite of mine as well as all tacos! We will continue to come in- and we can walk there which is even better!"}
{"text":"Great find!  Small restaurant in a small strip mall.  Delicious food."}
{"text":"Honestly the food was delicious. I recommend the Huevos Rancheros. Although a bit spicy they were totally worth it!! Friendly staff and always smiling."}
{"text":"This is our second time here. There is no better no fresher no more authentic Mexican food than here. Family run and mom is the cook. Great friendly family. They just opened in January. The food is UNBELIEVABLE!!! Homemade chorizo and pancakes.  Closed on Mondays. Open till 3pm on Sundays.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Best carne asada I've had, and service was great all the people working are very attentive and the food has the best authentic taste felt like I was eating my moms cooking"}
{"text":"Excellent creative southwest fare, all ingredients house-made, accommodated GF requests, flavorful without being too hot-spicy. Amazing that it was not busy for dinner on a Saturday night. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Stumbled on this place while staying in midtown Phx on a weekend vacation and so glad we did.    Yummy all around.    Good carne asada, margaritas, elote appetizer and even the rice and beans were very good.    Parked in back and came in back door but staff was accommodating and overall was the best place we ate at during our time in Phx.   Would def come back."}
{"text":"Had the chilaquiles with chicken and a michelada literally the best michelada I've had in my life ... the food was to die for and the service was absolutely great, great friendly staff make you want to come back"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and are are big foodies and like to try new place to eat in the Phoenix/Scottsdale area. In support of our local commerce we like to try little hole in the wall mom and pop shops. We came across Presidio Cocina and Mexican restaurant on Yelp saw the reviews and decided to try it for ourselves. When it comes to Mexican food I usually opt out of eating out since I usually am disappointed about the authenticity of the Mexican Restaurant I've tried so far. There's nothing like my mamas kitchen. Upon arriving at Presidio we were quickly greeted by Jose R.  who seated us quickly. Jose was polite and friendly. My boyfriend ordered the huevos rancheros and I ordered the chilaquiles. I'm telling you it was love at first bite .   Both dishes were absolutely delicious, just like my mamas kitchen. For anyone with a Mexican mother that sees going to a Mexican restaurant as a waste of money because their food is always better I encourage you to bring her here. I'm going to bring my mom. I look forward to see the look on her face after her first bite. Raza, you know what I'm talking about. This is by far the highest complement I've given any Mexican restaurants. Service and flavor are outstanding!!!  I would certainly recommend this place to family and friends."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in town! Wonderful service and delicious food makes for a happy customer!   Must haves: huevos rancheros, bunuelos, presidio tacos, Mexican street corn, and pretty much everything else on the menu!"}
{"text":"I can't describe to you just how great the food is here. I have ate all over the valley and didn't no what I was missing until I ate here. we will definitely be back. P.S. the carne asada will blow your mind, the flavor profile is damn near orgasmic."}
{"text":"Delicious authentic tacos made with good ingredients. I normally swear by Joy Ride and have not been able to find anything comparable. This place is like joy ride if it actually was and tasted authentic. Amazing service from everyone even though it was packed. Had delicious vegetarian tacos on corn tortillas which tasted homemade for those vegetarian/ gluten free out there. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Chilaquiles rojas are the way to go. Near perfect crunch accompanied with smokey taste from the salsa rojas. Horchata is creamy and the Jamaica is refreshing."}
{"text":"I don't write reviews but this place was phenomenal. The waitress suggested the shrimp taco which I wasn't in the mood for but I couldn't ignore her suggestion and tried it. Glad I did - The shrimp were tender. I Had the chorizo taco as well and it was amazing. Everything is fresh and homemade and it shows. They don't have a kids menu but we ordered taquitos and rice for my kids and they ate all of it and demanded more. They do charge for chips and salsa but they make the chips to order, they were amazing and the price wasn't outrageous so I didn't dwell on it. I will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"The food and service was exceptional! We are from El Paso, TX and since we're so close to the border, we have access to delicious,  authentic Mexican food.  This place felt like home.  Thank you for the amazing experience!"}
{"text":"Delicious food with great presentation in a cute place with good atmosphere. The cooking staff and the person who checked us out were extremely accommodating and friendly.  The only reason for the deduction of one star is that our waiter acted like he was mad at us for some reason and was rude and short.  When we asked for the check he actually came over and grabbed the glass on the table and dramatically picked it up and then refilled it, then we had to ask for the check again.  Not sure why he was mad as we were having a great time there and nothing had happened before that.  Despite that, I will return to this place and I absolutely recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"What a great restaurant!! Shrimp tacos were delicious, you have to try it! Oh, and the staff is amazing too ! What else can you ask for?!"}
{"text":"Food was very good and I am very picky about authentic Mexican food. The green chile was excellent. Their salsa is more of a condiment rather than eating with chips but very good flavor. I will be going back."}
{"text":"We ate here on a weekday. No problem getting a table. After greeting us, the server brought us 2 bowls of chips AND guacomale. All 4 adults thought that was unusual. When the bill came we found $20 added on for the guacomole we never ordered!! Our food was mediocre, and mine was served undercooked and hardly warm. Overpriced, skip this place!"}
{"text":"In town for business and decided we wanted breakfast burritos. They did not disappoint. We tried a few things on the menu and everything was excellent. One of the freshest is flavorful salsa verdes I have ever had."}
{"text":"I hired Presidio Cocina Mexicana to cater my wedding after having been there for lunch one afternoon with my fiancé at the time. During my first visit there I was very impressed with their delicious authentic Mexican food that's made with fresh ingredients. For my wedding they truly went above and beyond what I expected. When my fiancé and I went in for a tasting they offered entrees off the menu for us to taste. Luci was very attentive and accommodating to our needs. Luci made sure that everything would be perfect on our big day from meeting the expectation of serving delicious, quality food to arriving on time and even maintaining prompt communication and availability throughout the entire process. I was very pleased with Presidio Cocina Mexican restaurant and the services they provided. I could not imagine having anything different catered for my wedding."}
{"text":"The chile relleno is outstanding and so is the green chile verde. You will not go wrong with each either. Also best flan ever!!!"}
{"text":"Superb Guacamole, and fresh tortilla chips.   Everything tasted so good and fresh.  We had carne asada amd fajitas.  Handmade tortillas were amazing.  The service was personable and very welcoming.  Don't let the location fool you, this little place should be on the cover of Food magazone!"}
{"text":"There is a reason this place is so highly reviewed. Great food?  Of course!  Great service?  You feel like family!  I had the fresh guacamole, a cochinita pibil taco, and the huevos rancheros. The huevos themselves were awesome but with the potatoes and chorizo it was perfect. This is what Mexican food is supposed to be.   Matty approved!"}
{"text":"Delicious Mexican food! Came here on a Sunday afternoon with my boyfriend and loved everything about it. We had the carne asada plate and chilaquiles and both were great. Service was friendly and efficient. Nice atmosphere for a small venue. We will definitely be back to try more things on the menu!"}
{"text":"Came here with my husband.As soon as I walk in I knew I was going to like it ...Had tacos and menudo very delicious and tasty authetic mexican food coming back soon."}
{"text":"Very attentive staff. Delicious guac! Just wish the serving was bigger. My only advice would be for them to add spiciness ratings next to the dishes on their menu. One member in our group had a hard time eating their vegetarian meal. A definite recommend for those willing to spend a little extra for quality."}
{"text":"I came here because of the reviews. I was not disappointed!  food was great! The Al Pastor taco was one of the best I have ever had."}
{"text":"Love the chile relleno and chilaquiles. This place has a chill vibe, it's a cozy and clean place, it seems like they cook everything from scratch. I'm not much of a pancake person but I loved the pancakes here. I will definitely be coming back. The prices are reasonable too."}
{"text":"Disappointed. My coffee was luke warm and turned cold quickly. I requested for a hot one and that one was not hot either. I had to request again. They were nice though and brought me a hot coffee, finally. Food was really good, no complaints there. Major disappointment was at the dessert. It was really small, you could eat it all in 3-4 bites, literally. Snickers bar would have been better. They gave us a $1.25 discount for dessert being small, without us asking or complaining. That was nice, but they should have told us earlier. I wouldn't have got it."}
{"text":"Excellent Mexican food. I tried and I highly suggest trying the shrimp cocktail. It was fresh, yummy and delicious. It was a large portion so I didn't even end up finishing my shrimp cocktail at the restaurant. Great ambiance. I will definitely be coming back!!"}
{"text":"I never take the time to write a review but this was an exception! It's been a long time since I've had AUTHENTIC Mexican food at a restaurant, I was ecstatic. Everyone was really friendly, the restaurant was clean and the food was amazing! I could rave on and on about this restaurant. My favorite was the queso fundido appetizer, you have to try it! The prices are so reasonable, I will definitely be coming back. Love this place!"}
{"text":"I'll start by saying that the food deserves 5 stars, but we had a few other issues that are the reasons for only a 3 star rating.   The server and staff were all very friendly and made our group of 4 ladies, 3 toddlers and an infant feel very welcome at their lunch service that seemed to consist only of local professionals.    It smelled amazing as we walked in and i knew we had made the right choice for lunch. Our group started with an order of chips and salsa  ($2.50) and the chips were made to order, I hope it's like this every time. We also ordered the guacamole, which unknown to the person ordering, it was $10. Our chips and salsa were brought out and so was the guacamole which had great flavor, but appeared to only consist of 1 avocado....I wish I was joking.  We all ordered tacos...chicken, pibil, carne asada, veggie etc. The tacos were right on point and didn't disappoint.  Upon looking over the menu I saw that they charge a gratuity for parties of 8 or more, now I know that TECHNICALLY there were 8 of us, but c'mon, who really counts an infant as a diner?! It was petty things like this that really turned my off as a patron and really they're doing their waiters a disservice because our group would have tipped them no less than 20% as they were very accommodating and on top of their service. They also charged for an extra chip and salsa when we obviously only ordered one. We would've been just fine with one too because we had plenty left over. Like I said, petty.  Overall the service, food and staff were all great and I would return because the food IS something special, but I do hope someone is paying attention to reviews and taking these matters into consideration."}
{"text":"This is our favorite Mexican restaurant in town! No dish had yet to disappoint. The staff is incredibly warm and inviting. It definitely has excellent customer service. And their music is just on point!"}
{"text":"Fresh corn tortillas are freakin the bomb. Salsas and the different meats.  Been here several times and it has not disappointing. Another Superb Taco joint in the central line up."}
{"text":"I was looking for a breakfast burrito place and stumbled across this place. They just remodeled the inside and it looks very nice. I got the bacon egg and potato breakfast burrito it was really good. After I ordered I sat there and talked with the owner Sergio. Extremely friendly people. Food was great. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"No wait for breakfast on the weekend- we were the only ones here. The restaurant is clean, staff is friendly. If you get the quesadilla roja- have them throw an egg on it!"}
{"text":"It's been a long time since I've given a restaurant a 5 star review. But this place deserves 6 stars. It was 10 minutes until they closed but we were warmly welcomed. That was just the start of the incredible service we received. We started with a phenomenal Queso Fundido Chorizo and two hand mixed house margaritas. We ordered the street tacos and the mole entree. The mole was hands down one of the best I'd ever had. The tacos were exquisite. The start of the meal was the street corn....fresh and flavorful. Reminds me of the colorful boats in Xochimilco,  MX. If you have a chance to go when in Phoenix, go...it is well worth it"}
{"text":"No stars for this place. OK it made me place 1 :-(  I am a big foodie and previous food service director. when trying this place I did not find there hospitality to be welcoming no explanation of menu when. Stating it was our first time we found you on yelp :-(  Customer service was they never came to check on us we had to flag them down or ask for assistance.  Remind you this is a small place should be no need to lack in this area.  I ordered menudo when it arrived there was no hominy in it only tripe and broth.  When I questioned this serve said it comes that way unless customer ask for corn. He never expressed that to me when I ordered.  The eggs were burnt  and portion small for 4 of us to eat was 70$ not worth it at all."}
{"text":"I went during lunch hours but ordered something not on the lunch menu.   I ordered chilaquiles and they were delicious. The eggs I ordered sunny side up, hard and they were cooked perfectly. There was not alot of people when I went, this can play a factor in how fast my food came; it was quick.   Waiter was very attentive and kind.  I enjoyed it. I will be back."}
{"text":"Great local restaurant ...walking distance from our Willo home...love the Mexican street corn and fish tacos ....( I would love different chips though...) Highly recommend"}
{"text":"I had been wanting to try this new local restaurant because all the reviews were great. We went on a weekday around 4 and we had the place completely to ourselves. I ordered one cochinita pibil taco and the carne asada torta. The cochinita was absolutely delicious! I loved it! Next time I will request that they put the sauce on the side because they were very generous with it and I didn't think it needed it. The meat alone would be just as great. The torta was ok. I could only finish half of it. I don't like mayo but this was a mixed mayo spread so I had thought it would be ok. The mayo flavor was still pretty overpowering so it just didn't sit well with me. I'm sure if I had requested the torta without the spread, it would've been perfect.  We decided to have the buñuelos for dessert but they weren't good. The customer service was fantastic and the food was great. I would recommend the cochinita tacos! Also, if you check in you get 10% off so that's always nice!"}
{"text":"The service was excellent!.. try the huevos rancheros. Tamales are good as well. Great Mexican food all around.. hidden gem!"}
{"text":"I've been trying to get better about writing reviews when I've had a great experience because I and many others (as well as business owners) benefit from these and that is how I found this lovely restaurant. My friend and I stopped here in recovery mode after a fantastically long night....we ordered several items from the menu.   I must say that I am very picky about Mexican food, definitely not all is created equal and this was some of the best I've had. Our server(sorry I can't remember your name) had a delightful personality as did the owner (phenomenal chef)whom we spoke with as well. Very clean and beautiful little hidden gem, I will definitely return. My favorites-everything.   The horchata is homemade and they aren't kidding when they say it's the best in the valley. Tortillas are made fresh right there in front of you, the flour are my fav. The elote omg and the meats are cooked and seasoned to perfection. As you can see, we get pretty excited over good food haha and we know a great one when we find it. Stop by, you will love it. Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"We were in the mood for some really good Mexican Food and WE FOUND IT!  Excellent service and friendly staff. The food is crazy good. One the best guacamole we ever had!  Definitely our new \"go to\" place for great Mexican food!!"}
{"text":"Excellent menu thoughtfully prepared. Polite and friendly Staff. Good for breakfast lunch dinner takeout. Highly recommend. Glad they are in my neighborhood."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food spot I recently found via Instagram,  and I recommend it.  They have great service, the taste of the food is authentic.  So far I've tried their Chilaquiles, tamales and their rice and beans are delicious!! I can't wait to go back and try the chiles rellenos!"}
{"text":"Real authentic Mexican food! Feels like your in Mexico!  Usually I am very picky with Mexican food because my family owns Mexican restaurants but this was delicious!"}
{"text":"This is my second time to Presidio and we again had a fantastic meal! This small gem in midtown packs a lot of flavor into each and every dish they serve. I brought my parents here because it's right around the corner from us and our previous experience was so good. Jose R. was our gracious host who recommended the guacamole and street corn to begin with. The guacamole is the best I have ever had - the avocado was the star while the roasted poblano pepper accentuated the dip. The chips were fresh and warm. The street corn was amazing! Great grilled corn flavor with chipotle mayo and cojita cheese.   We asked Jose what was good as he came out of the kitchen, and with big eyes, he said that the chef had *just* finished making the mole sauce for the dish. It has 25 ingredients and sounded amazing - and amazing it was. My parents both got it and ate all of it and raved. I had a bite and you could just taste the love and care that went in to making the dish. So good.   I had tried their cochinita pibil taco on my last visit and knew I had to try the main dish. Again - epic. Slightly spicy, deep flavor with tangy pickled onions on top served with rice, black beans and a small salad and your choice of handmade corn or flour tortillas.   My mom and I both got a margarita and commented that it was most definitely made from scratch, and the drink was smooth. We actually said that about the entire meal - you can tell that the chef is passionate and that she puts a lot of care and thought and work into her food. It was delicious.   I am so glad this place is so close to us. I used to struggle when out-of-town guests came and wanted to try some \"authentic Mexican\" because we were seriously lacking in that department downtown - but no more. Because of their fantastic food and attentive service, Presidio will be our go-to for guests and for a special night out!"}
{"text":"First time at the restaurant, recommended to us by a local friend.  Some of the best Mexican food we have had in a long while. Everything made fresh,  we loved their salsa, our enchiladas and burritos were fresh and very flavorful.  Service was quick and friendly.  This restaurant is definitely on our go to list when in Phoenix."}
{"text":"The food is really good.  I had the build your own taco plate.  The chorizo was really meaty and it hardly had any fat, the al pastor was delicious and so was the carne asada.  I had the street corn as a side and it was really flavorful.  The cooks and the lady making the tortillas were super friendly.    The waiter was super moody though (big guy).  Im not sure if he was having a bad day or thats his usual personality but if thats the case; management should have a talk with him.  He could bring the business down for being so rude.  I am definitely going back but I'll sit at the bar next time, as the cooks and lady making the tortillas seem more friendly.  ------------UPDATE----------------- Went back for breakfast... and again, i was impressed with their food. The owner came and talk to us for a little while and told us the story of how her son decided to open this place.  Amazing food and amazing people... this place is AUTHENTIC!!!!"}
{"text":"The tacos we ordered were fantastic. The happy hour prices will make your wallet smile. The trio of tacos is the way to go if you want to test the product. Warning, the tortillas are not your white flour, generic, pedestrians boring. The are freshly hand-ground yummy morsels of joy! Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"So glad I came across Presidio. The food is as delicious as it looks in the photos others have shared; the micheladas are perfectly portioned, the staff is extremely pleasant and the music is on point . My new favorite Mexican restaurant downtown."}
{"text":"Two words: Presidio tacos. This place is amazing and has a family owned vibe to it which I love. Their service is great and their food is even better. Friends and I tried several dishes and everything is amazing. Even the food presentation looms great.   Would highly recommend coming here for some great breakfast or lunch!"}
{"text":"Visiting Phoenix and stumbled into this place in a strip mall. The food was delicious and beautifully presented. Not the type of \"Mexican\" food I'm used to. No ground meat or refried beans! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick bite. Love it! Fresh, flavorful, and friendly! Had the chilaquiles, tacos, and bunuelos. Que rico!!"}
{"text":"This place is incredible! The homemade tortillas top off an incredible meal, definitely the best Mexican food in the valley by far. Our waiter Jose R. gave us amazing service and it was all around a great experience that I highly recommend! We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  Every dish had excellent flavor.   The shrimp tacos are a must have.  The street corn was very good and the horchata was yummy. I encourage anyone looking for authentic Mexican to visit Presidio."}
{"text":"Food is okay flavor wise. It's an expensive place for what you get. In addition, our waiter was not too friendly so, we didn't feel welcome. We won't be back. The good thing is that you get your food super fast."}
{"text":"Great service and delicious, authentic Mexican food. The food is fresh and flavorful. Their chilaquiles have a perfect kick of spice. The guacamole is fresh. I have enjoyed this place every time."}
{"text":"We always enjoy well prepared food, and they met our high expectations. Tacos we ordered had a moderate heat level, and the corn tortillas were not the usual commercial style.  The accompanying rice or beans with the tacos was straightforward, fairly simple, but the street corn option was more than worth the extra $2.50!! I'm sure the other options are good, if what we had was any indication, I'm sure they are, and hope to try again on a future visit. Service was attentive and they accommodated our needs to get in and out quickly, however, the dishes are prepared to order, so it will take a little time for your food to arrive, but more than worth the reasonable wait...."}
{"text":"Delicious food & the host Jose makes you feel like home ! Best home made Mexican style restaurant in Phoenix area"}
{"text":"Tried Presidio for the first time this weekend. We arrived around 3:30 and were the only ones there on a Saturday. Ordered guacamole - was good but a small portion for $5. But what really stood out were the tacos. I had the fish, shrimp and chicken tacos while my partner had fish, chicken and carne asada tacos. Cooked to perfection with great sauces and toppings. Attentive service. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Soooo I found this place on Yelp of course and man oh man...I must say it is delicious! I ordered a shrimp, chorizo, and al pastor taco...The shrimp and al pastor tacos were definitely my favorite. I also ordered the street corn as an appetizer and that was also delicious.  But definitely the best part was their HORCHATA! You know a Mexican place is good if their horchata is good and it was bomb!  The sever was super nice and attentive. Everything is made fresh and tastes authentic. I will definitely be back to try their breakfast!"}
{"text":"Tonight me and my hubby decided to try this restaurant because it's right down the road from us. First off, the staff is super friendly, the decor is nice and the place is playing traditional music that's not too loud. After 6pm, they turn the lights down, so if you're on a date - that's kinda nice right?  The menu was full of really great choices but ultimately we decided to try a variety of tacos. We also ordered the \"street corn\" - which you could get on the cobb or in a dish. It was so great, salty, cheesy and spicy. I got the shrimp and fish tacos, both excellent and flavorful. My husband got the the El Pastor and chorizo tacos. So good! We will definitely be back to try other items on the menu. Great place!"}
{"text":"This was a great find. The house margarita was tasty. The guacamole is the best we've had and the fish tacos are amazing. We had a side of street corn. It is a great treat. Another table had a dessert that looked good; we'll have to save room next time we are in."}
{"text":"The presentation and service was great. I definitely gave them a 3.5-4. Iam visiting Phoenix so my expectations are high.  I suggest for lunch if you are nearby."}
{"text":"Perfect mix of a morning brunch but also maintaining atmosphere of a traditional Mexican restaurant. If your in the mood for a morning latte & tamales in one sitting...you've come to the right place!    Five stars because Mexican and coffee are two of my favorite things and they delivered both well.  Only change I would make to the experience is the extra charge for chips/salsa. Not accustom to that."}
{"text":"Wow, finally excellent local Mexican food. Chili Verde is a must. See photo. Home made corn tortillas!!! Fresh chips. Yum!   This restaurant is the best.  I want to leave more reviews:)"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Home cooked Mexican food and friendly staff!  Try the chile relleno and the huevos rancheros! Oh and the chile verde!  everything is awesome!"}
{"text":"Had Horchata and 3 a la carts tacos (shrimp, fish, and carne Assad).  The drink was good, tacos were ok but pricey (4-5 per taco!)  The tortilla itself was strange, a bit hard and lacked some flavor.  There was a huge pile of cabbage and sauce, so it made it hard to taste the main ingredients.  The steak was a bit hard and dry, the shrimp was flavorful and the fish was just ok.  I would go back to try other items but the tacos are a bit pricey for what you get.  Service was ok and place was clean."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem. Definitely would recommend coming here if you want authentic Mexican food. The staff is always so nice too."}
{"text":"The food was excellent! Upon our waiter's suggestion we ordered posole and chilaquiles. The chilaquiles are on the breakfast menu, but the waiter let us order them at lunch time around 130pm. The food was delicious! The chilaquiles had green sauce and were very spicy but had good flavor. The posole was just me as I've had better elsewhere. We will definitely be back to check out other menu items!"}
{"text":"Wow......this place was awesome!  Our family went for dinner last night and absolutely loved it.  We started off with guacamole and had the entree ceviche, both were delicious.    Entree's we had tacos, taquitos, enchiladas, chili verde and garlic shrimp dish that was incredible.   Great little place for a date night, taking clients out or a delicious family meal.    We will be going back for sure."}
{"text":"Prices are affordable. The portions are huge! The chilaquiles were sooo good! The sauce has so much flavor. The tortilla chips are crispy just how they should be. You can't get them like this anywhere else. We also had the huevos rancheros. Nice crispy tortilla under the egg. The salsa on top was nice and spicy, the beans and potatoes and with chorizo were a nice combo. Everything had such a good flavor. Definitely going back!"}
{"text":"Great margaritas and excellent food! I had 3 different tacos and each of them were different, but all were amazing! It's very clean and the atmosphere is great! I will be back!!!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant. We've been here twice and both experiences were great. Definitely recommend the enchiladas! They're soooo good! Horchata is good. Customer service is always awesome. Food has great Mexican flavor with a twist. Great restaurant all around."}
{"text":"Great tacos and delicious horchatas! Authentic Mexican food prepared lovingly by the nicest couple. It's in a hard-to-miss area but is worth a visit. I would be a regular if I lived in the area!"}
{"text":"I will start this review by saying that I am unforgiving about rudeness, arrogance and disrespect.  These three don't go together when one thinks of friendly service and good customer relations.  They just don't.  I experienced all three in a matter of seconds from a hefty \"gentleman\" who was placing orders with the cooks.  Therefore, I shall assume that he is at least a manager or at best an owner.    I accompanied a group of people who were related to a \"non-profit\" agency of which I was not a member. Therefore, I went with the assumption that I would pay for my own meal and that of my dining companion.  The moment I told this \"gentleman\" with the plaid shirt (I'm sure he has on a different shirt by now) that I needed a separate check, he appeared to be immediately annoyed.  He repeated my request with an edge to his voice.    As we perused the menus (which I believe them to be intentionally confusing to pad the bill), he returned.  As I began to open my mouth to order our food, he said in a loud and disrespectful tone:  \"Yeah, yeah, you want separate checks you already told me 3 times\".  I responded that I did not tell him 3 times and I just wanted to order.  Now, mind you, I am not a shrinking violet but I maintained my composure and did not tell him where to go the way he deserved to be told and walked out of the restaurant.  But you know how it is, you don't want to embarrass the people  who are with you.  Would I ever step foot in this place ever again you ask?  ABSOLUTELY NOT.  Mr. Arrogant/Nasty needs to make his money from people who will tolerate his attitude.    And now for the food.  Totally confusing.  I saw tacos and I normally don't eat big portions for lunch so I saw tacos @ $4.50 for two small tacos.  I should have read more closely.  They were $4.50 each and were the size of silver dollars.  I should have taken a photo of the two silver-dollar sized tacos.  So my little mediocre lunch was $9.00 plus tax. My companion ordered two of the tiny tacos as well (also $9) and ended up having to order an entree because of the smallness of the tacos.  So now $16 for a lunch entree was added to the bill.  The carne aside (skirt steak) was tough and he didn't touch the yellow rice which was clumpy and had a strange flavor.  My bill came to $41 for a mediocre lunch for two, sprinkled with attitude, disrespect and arrogance.  I left him a tip because I am a lady but not because he deserved it    I truly don't understand the great reviews unless you consider the fact that this restaurant is opposite St. Joseph's Hospital and near Barrow's Rehab Center and people desperate for non-cafeteria food will flock to this mediocre establishment and pay top price.    I would love to open up a restaurant right near him because my son (a chef) and I would put this rude oaf out of business.  Someone who can't prepare yellow rice 101 deserves to be chased out of the neighborhood.    Good luck folks if you think this is good mexican fare.  BTW, make sure you go to the ATM before you go or borrow from your 401K before you go to Presidio Cocina.   BTW, Presidio means penitentiary in Spanish... Hmmmmmmmm."}
{"text":"Delicious posole! So much flavor ! But my favorite were the Huevos Rancheros. The salsa on the Rancheros is authentic and has a kick but oh so good!! Sergio's service was excellent!!"}
{"text":"I have been to this place several times and still love it each time I go.  This last time I hosted a brunch party there with 10 people who have never eaten here.  In the end...they loved it and you will too!   This time I ordered something new.. chilaquiles with a friend egg.  I wanted red sauce and never regretted it.  This was so good.  I would order it again.   Jamica, fresh made and not too sweet.   No matter when you go, you will find fresh made mexican food from scratch everytime."}
{"text":"Basically this place is authentic, really good Mexican food, without all the lard - Fresh and clean ingredients. Plus the service!!! Our server was so kind."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing and really elevates Mexican cuisine to another level. I had the quesadilla with chicharron and a taco de cochinita pibil and both were great. This isn't just a taco shop but a restaurant were they put more effort into the flavor and presentation of the food."}
{"text":"Took my team here for lunch. Amazing food! Tortillas made fresh. Guacamole was very unique with some fresh sweet corn. The tacos. Oh the tacos. I tried the shrimp, pulled pork and chicken. I'm telling you this is the real deal. The kitchen is open so you can see the chef cooking. The ingredients are fresh. The service was off the charts. I'm taking my team back there again!"}
{"text":"This is some of the BEST Mexican food in the Valley. We came upon this restaurant by accident, and, we are glad we did. They serve fresh, favorable food, with  a modern flair. Their Chili Releno was excellent, and, not at all greasy. Their Flautas were also excellent. Topped with shredded lettuce, Mexican creama, and queso fresco. All entrees are served with excellent rice and home-made refried beans. They have a small selection of beers and tequila. The service was first rate, helpful and friendly. I would certainly recommend this small, excellent find, and cannot wait to return!!"}
{"text":"My buddy and I went here for dinner today and loved it!  The guacamole was amazing and so was our meals. This is a surprisingly good gem downtown. Check it out!  :)"}
{"text":"Let's start with saying I am the daughter of a chef, and a badass Mexican momma in the kitchen. Being spoiled with really good food my entire life I  have very high standards, especially when it comes to Mexican food.  Now, to how I ended up at presidios.... I came from California to visit friends that now live in phoenix. One of them told us presidios served the best chilaquiles, MY FAVORITE FOOD, so of course being the foodie I am we HAD to go. So we arrive to Presidios and are greeted and seated right away by a friendly man. I looked over the menu where I was tempted by many yummy sounding options, but restrained myself from drifting on why I was originally there... the chilaquiles. So we all order our food and chitchat while it gets prepared.  Our food arrives and first thing I do is check my eggs (there is nothing more disappointing then when you order over easy eggs, expect this explosion of yummy goodness, and you poke your yolk and nothing comes out). They were cooked perfectly (yay!). My eggs are right, now I can eat... I take my first bite and instantly get a euphoric feeling (if you're a foodie you know EXACTLY what I'm talking about). The tortillas were fried as they should be, enough to get both crunchy and soft after the sauce is poured over them, speaking of the sauce, it tasted like what you make at home which means no skipped steps and made with love, they were not greedy  with the sauce at all you had plenty to cover all your tortillas. I was so satisfied then bummed when I realized I don't live here and can't get this unless I make it myself (ugh!)... I guess I will be visiting phoenix a lot more often lol.  Besides the amazing food, the staff was super friendly and sweet. The man who helped us was attentive at all times, they even gave us a big container of one of the hot sauces that we really liked because we were going to make carne asada for dinner. I don't have anything negative  to say about this place. Came a second time right before heading back to California, and once again everything was delicious."}
{"text":"Found this place to have a nice atmosphere,  good mexican music, staff very friendly and courteous.  The food....amazing"}
{"text":"Very disappointing, we were served no chips, no salsa.  My meal:  beans were cold, rice room temp.  The flautas hand so much stuff on them, I could not even see them till I asked for another plate to get them cleaned off enough to eat.   My co-workers plates:  the burrito chorizo was awful, they picked out the potatoes and ate them only.  Their beans did not taste well either.  We were never offered refills on our drinks and they must use ice trays because none of us had enough ice for one person.  Never will go back again, and really it was a little expensive for lunch."}
{"text":"Wow!!! This place is bomb!!  Where to start. Everything is freshly made!! They started us with salsa and chips AND freshly made Guacamole!! I ordered the huevos rancheros and I was not disappointed at all!! Plate came with refried beans and papas con chorizo!! My boyfriend got the pozole. So some things up, pretty good spot. Tomorrow is our last day here and we Def. will be coming back for breakfast!!"}
{"text":"Service wasn't bad at all...but the food was not tasty at all. High prices and my enchiladas were red sauce soup. The food needed flavor and the fajitas were beyond bland with rubbery chicken. Flavorless food. Nice ambience. Won't be coming here again."}
{"text":"Presidio is my favorite restaurant. Period. I am a huge foodie and grew with great privilege in that I have been exposed to all different aspects of the culinary world, especially high end. I will tell you right now, I would take a 30 dollar meal for two at presidio over a 300 dollar dinner for two at a high end steakhouse. The people, the service, the food, and the just the pride they take in their work makes presidio a perfect ten. If you haven't eaten here, you need to. If you read this and don't eat their, then you are making a huge mistake.   also, look at the hat they gave me for being a loyal customer :)"}
{"text":"These were the best Huevos Rancheros I've ever eaten. The chorizo is to die for. Highly recommended. Service was great. Wonderful place for Mexican breakfast. Unfortunately I can't make it back for dinner."}
{"text":"Wow.  First time here and I was pleasantly surprised. In an area where there is a LOT of great Mexican options, this place still shines. The carne Asada and shrimp tacos were on point."}
{"text":"We stopped in for breakfast and had fantastic dishes.  We had the huevos rancheros and the omelet.  Everything was made fresh even the chorizo. They loved to talk about how they make their food and they take a lot of pride in it.   We can't wait to come back for dinner."}
{"text":"Hidden gem..... was in the mood for Mexican food and happened to spot this place by the corner of eye. Nice atmosphere and friendly service. The drinks were good and food was AMAZING... will definitely be back on our next Phoenix visit."}
{"text":"I love this place! The food is delicious and not super heavy or greasy like most Mexican food restaurants. I always leave satisfied no matter what I order. The staff is nice and friendly and looks happy to be there. I recommend this place to anyone that wants to try more authentic Mexican food and not your average Mexican American food."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this little place! We got several of the appetizers including the street corn as well as probably all the tacos and the chili verde. The cocktails were tasty, the jalapeño one packing a serious spicy punch! I adored all the tacos and especially loved the chili verde which again was a tad spicier than the usual fare. Service was friendly and prompt, prices are super reasonable, and food is great."}
{"text":"You really should check this place out.   I found this place on yelp this morning. It is near where I was traveling in Phoenix so I popped in. The chips, the hot chips, and salsa, three different salsas, are a great start. I had the omelet which is eggs stuffed with in house made chorizo and Mexican cheese with a side beans and papas. This is truly the breakfast of champions. I also decided to try to posole. Chock full of pork and hominy in a delicious deep red broth.  All in all I'm quite happy. You will be too!"}
{"text":"Accommodated our large out of town group in their cozy local atmosphere. Amazing food & genuine service. Would definitely recommend- it was worth the ride from our downtown conference."}
{"text":"Round 2, Verde Chili and a chicken tamale with 2 eggs over easy. Simply perfect, fast efficient  service and very nice presentation with an amazing flavor. Its a long drive from Cave Creek for breakfast but totally worth it. They have some serious skills in the kitchen."}
{"text":"The food is authentic. I loved the tortllas, chps, guacmle, green salsa & hevos ranchros. Thank you; great service."}
{"text":"Seating felt like a diner. Chile Verde was chewy. Corn tortillas were made from course ground corn. Conchita plate was mild and on the sweet side. Red blend $12 for ok wine. 3 people - 2 with one drink each. One with two drinks. Bill was $103 with grat didn't seem like good value for the dining experience we had."}
{"text":"We find this place through yelp. If you like authentic  mexican food, you should try this place.  However, Price was high for the food they offer."}
{"text":"We've been meaning to try this place for a while, and we're just sorry we waited so long! Brunch is a usual highlight for the weekend, and this place is going to be featured heavily in our rotation. We got seated as soon as we walked in and our server had the best recommendations based on preferences. I ordered the horchata before I saw the \"Best in Phoenix\" award, and it certainly is! Smooth, just slightly sweet, and no pulp - but 100% refreshing. For brunch I ordered the tamale plate with scrambled eggs. The beans are hands down some of the best I've had in Phoenix (I might have eaten most of my fiancé's). Presidio is super casual, but the food is top-notch. This  combination equals one of the best spots for a lazy (or hungover) Sunday brunch. Can't wait to try the lunch and dinner menu."}
{"text":"Just got back from Mexico City and I needed some more delicious and traditional cuisine. This place hits that spot. DELICIOUS. The restaurant is clean, bright, friendly and family run. Mom's recipes and happy customers. You can not go wrong eating here."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Came here at lunch yesterday. The air conditioning was nice and the food was awesome. I had the burrito enchiladas style and my friend got some tacos.   You order at the counter and they bring you your food. It's best to go down 5th and park in the back. The door says \"Mexican food\"."}
{"text":"I stopped in here after an appointment at St Joe's because it is right across the street and looked like a cute place. It has an authentic Mexican vibe and decor. The veggie taco and street corn I got were delicious. The Jamaica was also very good. The taco was light, full of veggies, and had a very tasty sauce. It was well presented by the friendly waiter. I'm already looking forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"This place is awesome it has an industrial modern feel. Food is true to Mexico and American culture. I had the Chile verde and my husband has the carne asada and chorizo plate. Definitely dining here again!"}
{"text":"Excellent!  Best Mexican food in he valley.  Enchiladas are amazing.  Definitely be back."}
{"text":"Glad we found this little spot! Hard to find truly authentic food in Phoenix. So far the menudo and huevos rancheros and home made tortillas have been delicious and can't wait to try new items next time. Definitely worth checking out if you are looking for an authentic Mexican restaurant at a reasonable price!"}
{"text":"I'm suspect of at least one of those 1 star reviews... person has just this 1 review and it's one star?   Anyway, short review: I went there today for lunch and this place has it all, ambiance, great food, pleasant and fast service. I got 3 tacos and they were larger than I expected, in a good way. The fish was outstanding as well as the chorizo taco (!). You don't see those often. The chips were hot just like I like 'em. They provided two dipping sauces for the chips that seem to reflect the current, modern trend of being more like hot sauces than salsas. To each their own, but I would loved to have had something like Via DeLosantos' combo of a slightly chunky salsa with a hot sauce.   Nonetheless, this place has the mojo and 5 star food. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"This is as good as it gets. Presidio is one of those places that you look forward to going to again and again. Our server, Jose R., was very kind and greeted us as soon as we walked in the door. We sat at the bar and he offered to make us \"the best margarita in town.\" Of course we took him up on it. I also had the Jamaica and their award winning horchata. Both were authentic and delicious. We also ordered the guacamole with chips and salsa. The chips were freshly fried and the salsa was the best! (Bonus: ask for the two salsas that come on the huevos rancheros and the chilaquiles.) The tacos were amazing and the tortillas are made fresh in house. Anything they can do in house, from the tortillas to the chorizo to the drinks, they do it! And it definitely shows in the way everything tastes. I was too full to try the flan, but will certainly be saving room for it next time. I can't wait to go back. Their happy hour specials look to be a great deal as well!"}
{"text":"So good! Fresh food with delicious flavors with friendly service while dealing with a full house. Highly recommend the street corn and guacamole to start. I had the chile relleno made with chile yum! Small place but very nice."}
{"text":"Small scale Mexican food spot on Thomas.  Came in with a group of 6. We ordered micheladas, chilaquiles, fish tacos, salads, pancakes, and tacos.  The micheladas took quite a while.  When they finally came out they were on the plain side lacking spices and lime juice.    The fish taco was overcooked and dark colored.  The oil needed to be changed and to be cooked higher so it would have been light, crisp, and fresh like a good little fish taco should be.  The green sauce on the chiliquiles was quite good but other than that they were also very plain.  I would have liked some toppings, cilantro, tomato, queso, something.  The sentiment across the 6 of us was pretty much the same: It's okay.  The waitress forgot our silverware so we had to get up and get them ourselves.  She also gave my wife chicken instead of shrimp with her salad and then instead of accepting responsibility and apologizing she tried to say my wife asked for chicken when 5 of us heard her.  A 3 star is generous as I would not come back nor would I recommend Presidio to others."}
{"text":"Came in for lunch, the food was really good and the staff was friendly. We brought our super picky daughter and they were very nice and accommodating with her food. Overall, I would recommend this place to anyone looking for some great Mexican food."}
{"text":"First time here, I was really impressed. The food was really de-LOY-cious. I ate the Menudo and was really happy with my choice. My boy ate the carne asada torta and he really enjoyed it as well. I will definitely come back again. My boy had the torta de asada and he really enjoyed it, so ultimately this place has a great variety of food."}
{"text":"Le hace falta SAZON!!  1 star for the Agua de Jamaica. (hibiscus tea)  I'm one that never reads the reviews and more often get guided by the pictures posted. In this case I should have had read the reviews because they're spot on.  Someone commented Juan's on their review, Juan's is AMAZING!!"}
{"text":"I am always sadden when I go somewhere that has good reviews and the place is just blah.  I am thinking that it has to do with knowing what real authentic Mexican food taste like and expecting that when I read the reviews. First of all the service at first was great, but the longer we stayed it seemed as if we were forgotten. They don't have free refills on coffee which surprised me and if I would have know that I would have just drank one cup and had water the rest. The green chilaquiles were just ok, I felt they lacked some flavoring. It was a big plate but it wasn't anything that I would come back for. The chorizo burrito was also just ok. It just needed more flavoring, the food is just blah in my opinion. The beans were actually good and the cheese is probably the only thing that I could say was authentic. They do have coke products which if you read my other reviews is always a plus. There is limited parking in the front but more in the back and there is an entrance in the back. Overall this place was just ok nothing to get excited about or come back to."}
{"text":"Seriously the best tacos ever!  We came on Easter Sunday and they were closing early (technically closed when we got there) but they were nice enough to INVITE us in to eat and we are so glad they did because the food was amazing.  Everything was super fresh and flavourful.  It's right across the street from the hospital so great to go get better for than in the hospital.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PLACE!"}
{"text":"I work nearby and try to stop by twice a month for their shrimp burrito.  Hands down the best shrimp burrito I have ever had.  Staff is always awesome.  The wait is not bad at all considering the freshness of their ingredients."}
{"text":"Finally! A Mexican cuisine restaurant in the central corridor worthy of a five star review.  This place is small and unpretentious, but don't let that fool you.   The establishment clean, the staff is professional and friendly.   The menu is full of items prepared from authentic family recipes from the Michoacán region of Mexico.  Sauces are prepared mild to spicy.   We enjoyed the chilequiles with carnitas is a chile verde sauce, served with eggs over medium.   Pork tamale smothered in a rich red sauce.   Also huevo rancheros in red sauce, served with beans, potatoes with chorizo, and a chile relleno on the side.   Everything was served hot as it should be. My compliments to the owners for running such fine establishment."}
{"text":"I was looking for another good place for breakfast and found it at Presidio. The owner's son, Sergio, waited on me. He told me the recipes are his mom's, who was from state of Michoacán - that sounded good! I had to try their chips and guacamole. The chips were light, hot, fresh and unsalted - just like I like them. The guacamole was very fresh and had just the right ingredients. I ordered the chorizo omelette. It was light and delicious, the chorizo is made fresh on the premises and was not greasy. The beans and papas tasted home made, the test of any good Mexican restaurant. Tortillas are also made on premises and are tasty and fresh. I went back for lunch this week and ordered the carne asada taco and seafood tacos.  All had generous portions and delicious. They are awaiting a liquor license so you can wash down all that great food with an adult beverage. I plan on returning again and again!"}
{"text":"Went with some meat eaters and they adored the tacos! My boyfriend loved the shrimp taco the best, but said the carne and fish were fantastic as well. I had a veggie taco which was delicious. Looks like they have a sweet happy hour, but the prices are crazy reasonable already."}
{"text":"I got a chorizo burrito and it was decent. Kinda dry but the green salsa made up for it. Got the iced coffee and wished inhad just ordered water because it was a couple bucks for the coffee and came in almost a champagne flute. A little too classy maybe for ym taste"}
{"text":"Seriously the best Mexican food we have had eating out!  I had the Huevos Rancheras and my guy had a Torta. Every single thing they served was excellent!! From the chips, salsa, food to the drinks. PS he loved the Michelada. Top notch."}
{"text":"The Guacamole and tacos were some of the best I've had! I had a few varieties of the tacos, but the shrimp were the best in my opinion. The house margarita was tasty and fairly strong. I dig the cozy vibe and accommodating staff! Must check this place out of you are in the area."}
{"text":"Wow!!  Upon entering, I was surprised to find such a classy establishment. I started with a perfectly made margarita, a real one.   When we asked if they could modify a recipe, they had no problem.  We waited as our food was freshly prepared.  When it arrived, the presentation was five star!  The mahi-mahi was perfectly cooked, not an easy thing to do.  The bread loaf was deliciously toasted, light and fluffy, buttered- yum!!  I cannot rave enough!!  Phoenix, Get out of your routine and taste the classy delicacies of Mexico!"}
{"text":"Great local business that serves up the goods. Every reviewer is 100% spot on about this being a bombshell of a restaurant. We drove all the way from Chandler to eat here and it was well worth the 25-30min drive and getting through \"the tunnel.\"    Everything we had was well seasoned and had flavor, which is a welcome surprise if you frequent chains like On the Border for Mexican style food. Really a shame what you're missing out on in terms of authenticity and even quality. Service was quick as we went during the Saturday lunch hour; everyone was friendly. Patrons were actually Hispanics.   I will give this 5 stars despite the only knock being that they don't serve frozen margaritas!!!  If they include that then they'll be golden. Until then I'd still recommend this to anyone looking for authentic flavor."}
{"text":"Do you like authentic Mexican food? Do you love amazing service? Do you like to eat? Do you like trying new spots?  Well then I suggest you get yourself over to Presidio!!! They are new, fantastic people and A-mazing food. I'm so happy we stopped in. I wanted to treat my family to something new this Valentine's day. I'm glad this was the place. Food is delicious. The people and service are spot on. It's a small place so it's got the family vibe. Give them your business, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"My wife and I are vacationing here in Phoenix and flew in from Atlanta Georgia. Based on Yelp reviews for Mexican restaurants this restaurant had one of the highest scores. Jose R was our server. Jose was fantastic. Made lots of good recommendations. Ultimately we ended up getting a bowl of guacamole some tacos and chili rellenos. The guacamole was the best guacamole my wife and I have ever had. The tacos were fantastic. This was by far some of the best Mexican food we ever had."}
{"text":"Decided on Presidio after seeing the positive reviews & \"hot and upcoming\" status. And this place delivered on all of it. I ordered guacamole as a starter and it was by far the best guac I've had in a long time. For lunch my friend and I ordered various street tacos and all of them were amazing. Fresh, light, great flavor...I highly recommend the carne asada or fish tacos.   Wait staff was friendly, place was small and cute. Will visit again before I leave Arizona.   This place is a must if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Good food, friendly staff!  Try the Tamales or the cilantro chicken salad!  Definitely coming here again!"}
{"text":"Food was great. Tried all the tacos and they were flavorful, well seasoned, enough meat.  Pickled onions on alot of dishes, they are done well and I assume in house.  Wish the guac was not 80% red onion and had cilantro. Chips are fantastic, light and crispy.   If Beau McMillan had a taco stand it probably would be something like this.   Service was great, dessert was fun and just like I remember from traveling in various parts of Mexico."}
{"text":"Um. Wow. This place is amazing. Get the tequila flight bc it's $14 and perfect for dinner. Enchiladas, Relleno, tacos and guac. All good!! Service is awesome. Parking in back!"}
{"text":"Have I really never reviewed Presidio?!?! You need to come here asap. They have unbelievable chorizo and their food is truly authentic. I would highly recommend their breakfast burrito for breakfast (pro tip: add avocado) with a delicious cup of coffee and I'd recommend their tacos and/or their carne asada con chorizo for dinner. They are a little higher of a price point than other local Mexican food eateries, but it is absolutely worth it. The flavor, experience, and service far exceed expectations. HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!!! **much love**"}
{"text":"I haven't been this excited about a new restaurant for a long time. The food is fresh and delicious. And the staff is helpful and friendly. I got the quesadilla roja con chicharron and I would absolutely get it again. In fact, I have a feeling I'm going to be so obsessed with this dish that I will be back in the next few days. My husband got the tacos, which were also yummy. You MUST try Presidio. Soon. Really."}
{"text":"This little place is simply wonderful! I cannot believe I haven't been here before.   When you walk in, order your drinks at the counter and get your free chips with red and green salsa. While the green salsa is good, I prefer the red. It has the perfect hint of spice without being overpowering.   For lunch I ordered the carne asada and pollo tacos, both absolutely delightful! The pollo taco was a skosh spicy with bold flavor and fresh toppings. The carne asada was surprisingly light and cooked perfectly. Normally, I am not a fan of corn tortillas, but I had no qualms about eating them at this joint.   The service was great and thankful we tried their restaurant!  I will definitely be back. Please be sure to check this place out!"}
{"text":"Amazing Tacos!  Great Guacamole, flautas and Tacos.  Fresh ingredients and spicy salsa. Definitely recommend the carne asada and carnitas. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Don't know what the hype is but for me it was no good .   I had tried it a while back and it was mediocre and the second time was just enough to get me by ."}
{"text":"Excellent brunch - we tried the chilaquiles with eggs (which had a great spicy green sauce), huevos rancheros, and breakfast tacos.  Each was unique and very flavorful. Super friendly staff too!"}
{"text":"We ordered the Chilaquiles with green sauce, Camarones a la Diabla, & the Chile Relleno. Everything was !!! 10/10 for sure ! I've had a lot of amazing Mexican food in SF but next time I come to Phoenix, this will be my go to spot ! Service, Prices, & Food was nothing short of amazing ! I would definitely recommend this place !"}
{"text":"La mejor comida mexicana en Estados Unidos!!! Sin Exajerar!  This place is the best darn Mexican food I've had in the US of A. I travel the country pretty often, I'm a big foodie and always look for \"The best\" of each city. This is a cozy hole-in-the-wall restaurant that without a doubt shows TRUE love for what they do. There wasn't a single thing I could've complained about this place. From their clean, filtered water, to their high-quality food and robust flavors. The Tortillas, Beans, Potatoes, Chorizo, Eggs, Tacos, Meat, rice and desserts, ALL delicious and made with passion. From the bar you can see the kitchen and see your food freshly prepared. I found it VERY hard to believe that I didn't find a single thing wrong with this place, then I thought to myself \"Hmmm, if they only had WIFI\" and here comes the waiter to ask \"Would you like the WIFI password?\". I just Lol'd because he totally shut me up and I have not a single negative thing to say about this establishment."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness, my husband and I had some of the BEST tacos that we've ever had in our lives here last week. Not only that, the service was absolutely incredible. We sat at the bar and felt like we were sitting in a family member's home. Jose, we will absolutely be back to see you soon!   I ordered a Paloma to start and Jose made it perfectly. It was made with fresh grapefruit juice and was so smooth. We also ordered the guac with their homemade chips {they came out fresh and hot!}, and multiple salsas. The salsas were the perfect consistency, I wanted to drink them. Does anyone else ever have the urge to drink salsa? no? Maybe i'm weird but i'm a-ok with that. haha!  For my tacos, I ordered the SHRIMP {my fav fav fav}, carne asada, and a pork taco that had pineapple in it {AMAZE}. They were all SO flavorful, filling, and the homemade corn tortillas were the best ever.   My mouth is watering just writing this review, we can't wait to come back! Especially for Happy Hour! :) See you soon, Jose!"}
{"text":"Very good Mexican food and reasonable prices.  I had the green chili pork, which was solid.  Many of the other dishes were better - especially some of the tacos. Portion sizes are good too."}
{"text":"This place is phenomenal.  Firstly Big Jose was a superb waiter - friendly, great recommendation, excellent service (restaurant management - hats off to him).  The food was excellent - one of the best Mexican meals I have had (including during several trips to Mexico)."}
{"text":"My husband and I ordered our 2 favorites, Carne Asada and Chile Relleno.  Both were excellent.  Good family cooking!  The best we've had in the Phoenix area.  Would definitely recommend this restaurant to everyone!  Back in town and food is consistently delicious.  My husband had the omelette and he thought the chorizo was perfect.  I had the chile relleno and it too was perfect.  Had the street corn and thoroughly enjoyed it.  Will come back every chance we get.  The best Mexican restaurant we've been to in the Phoenix area!"}
{"text":"Very good food. Lots of shrimp in the fajitas. The sangria was also very good but be aware it is enough for two."}
{"text":"Loved the place.  Very modern decor, simple and clean looking.  There is plenty of parking in the back and you can enter from there also.  The menu is not very large, but it has all the main dishes.  We had the street corn, super yummy.  I also ordered the Enchilada and Tamale Plate and 2 tacos, a Cochinita Pilbil and Al Pastor plus two Margaritas.  Everything was delicious.  I loved the enchiladas and the tamale was very moist.  I have to come back to try other stuff."}
{"text":"Before coming to Presidio for Sunday brunch, I honestly hadn't given this place a second thought (or a first for that matter).  The menu as best I can tell is fairly standard Mexican fare (albeit with a few unique items mixed in).  But being the Yelp fanatic I am I took notice of the fact that owners Sergio Nava and Karen Remus went out of their way to make a video introduction of their restaurant on their Yelp page.  They highlighted the fact that much of the menu is actually native to the Michoacan region of Mexico rather than the Sonora region cuisine which most of us here in Arizona are used to.  So with that little bit of extra knowledge and with a 4.5 Yelp score as of this morning, I decided to give them a try.  The restaurant lines the northern perimeter of the Willo district on Thomas Road.  The restaurant faces St Joseph's Hospital just west of 5th Avenue on the south side of the street.  It can be easy to miss amongst the row of businesses as the restaurant is fairly narrow.  There's almost no parking up front so its best to go south on 5th Avenue and park behind the shopping center.  The interior of the restaurant can cram about 50 patrons at time (though surprisingly comfortably), and includes about 8 seats at the front bar area.  As the tables were full at 11am on this Sunday, I grabbed one of the bar seats.  The front kitchen doubles as the bar so I had a front row seat for all the food prep and drink mixing going on.  Sergio himself was my waiter and his Mom Lucina took charge of my food.  As with any Mexican establishment worth its weight I must of course start with a horchata.  Bad horchata usually means a bad forthcoming meal from my experience.  Fortunately, the horchata was just right and got my palate ready for the meal.  First off, their Mexican Street Corn appetizer.  Grilled corn (not corn on the cob thank goodness), chili powder, chipotle mayo, and cotija cheese.  Plus a lime to squeeze for a little extra acidity.  Nice starting dish.  Not spicy, but just a touch of heat and a really creamy mesh of the mayo and cheese.  For my main dish, the Enchiladas & Tamale entree seemed like a hearty (and highly customizable) menu option.  Two enchiladas of your choice (I went with a bean enchilada with red sauce and a chicken enchilada with green sauce) plus a tamale of your choice (I went with a pork tamale with red sauce).  The dish also comes with rice and beans plus a lettuce with a really heavenly cilantro dressing.  The colors on this dish reminded me of Christmas.  The portion sizes of each item were actually pretty modest so it was pretty easy for me to take down.  The tamale was excellent and the pork had a little extra unexpected spice, but didn't take away from the flavor at all.  The enchilada filings were quite good, though I was a little disappointed with the texture of the tortillas they used for the enchiladas.  They were a little rubbery in my opinion.  On the whole though, a good dish.  For dessert, I was torn between a flan and something I'd never heard of before called a banuelo.  Purely to satisfy my curiosity, I got the banuelo.  Basically a small fritter thats fried, covered in sugar and whipped cream and topped with fruit (in my case, a few blackberries).  Eats almost like one of those handheld sugary snacks you'd get wrapped in wax paper at the state fair.  A light, airy dessert that was okay but next time I'll probably get the flan.  Total cost for all the food, the horchata, tax, and tip came to about $30.  Plenty of food to get my belly full, though I'll admit I've gotten similar quality (and more quantity) at other Mexican establishments in town for cheaper.  I like the atmosphere at Presidio as Sergio and his family were all super nice and there were a bunch of families here throughout my meal.  My next trip here I'll probably try the tacos or their signature Quesadilla Roja entree.  Overall, certainly a place worth a try and a nice setup for a relatively small space.  A nice neighborhood spot for a quick Mexican meal from a region of Mexico many probably have never heard of.  But then again that's part of the beauty of food exploration isn't it?"}
{"text":"Setting the standard for tacos full stop.  Best tacos al pastor I've ever had (and I've had a lot). The shrimp tacos are also fantastic. The chips are fresh and perfectly fried to order. Service was a bit bumpy the two times we went during our short trip, but once was because their Elo system had a meltdown. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"On our first visit we thoroughly enjoyed the experience and will definitely be back! Love that it's a tiny little mom-and-pop place in our hood. We started out ordering guacamole, taqueria and the street corn. They brought out complementary red and green salsa and the flavors were spot on.   We also tried the Chilaquiles both red and green with chicken and finished off with the Fillon and a specialty cookie with walnuts in it.  The presentation was nice, service quick and everything flavorful. My top faves are the Chilauiles, corn and flan."}
{"text":"Online menu carne asada torta $6.50, actual price when I went to pick up phoned in order $10.29 Wouldn't honor published online menu pricing. I don't appreciate that garbage or being lied to, because I would of likely chosen something else if the pricing was accurate.   After seeing managements comment (update):  Don't worry I won't be purchasing anything from you ever again, and because of this this review many others will not be either! Own your mistakes, your menu is fraudulent. Here's a bit of education from Webster's Dictionary for the management over there as well:  \"Lie (noun); an inaccurate or false statement; a falsehood.\"   \"Fraud (noun); deceit, trickery, sharp practice, or breach of confidence, perpetrated for profit or to gain some unfair or dishonest advantage.\""}
{"text":"We stopped in today for lunch after reading the amazing reviews!  The staff and cooks were so friendly and welcoming and the food was absolutely delicious!  I enjoyed a half order of the bean enchiladas with red sauce and a side of rice and beans and my husband had the enchilada and tamale plate with chicken enchiladas in green sauce and pork tamales with red sauce and a side of rice and beans.  This place is legit and I can't wait to come back and try other items on the menu!"}
{"text":"The green chile chilaquiles were amazing! Great customer service. We highly recommend."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING. Ordered the huevos rancheros and it was sooooo delicious!!! The portions were very generous and it was authentic mexican. Staff was super friendly (Pearla was our server). She was the best! This place has only been open for 5 months and we hope it sticks around. We will be back!!!"}
{"text":"Limited parking facing the front facade.  However, there's abundant parking in the back.  Pale yellow textured walls add to the cozy ambiance.  Hybrid seating to fit your preference:) A booth lines the entire side wall on one side and then chairs line the aisle.   Since I stopped by for a spontaneous solo lunch I opted for counter seating so I could look observe kitchen prep.  Mexican tunes at just the right level  Ordered the red chili pork tamale with two eggs, over easy and refried beans, sprinkled with cotija cheese. I also ordered   bunuelos with whip cream and berries!  It was photo of this sweet and crunch delight that was the deciding factor between Mexican or Vietnamese for lunch.  Presidio Cocina Mexicana has my savory and sweet tastebuds covered!  The tamale sauce consistency was perfect, flavorful yet not spicy. Eggs cooked to order. Loved the combination of textures and flavors on my plate. It was so delicious, I didn't have leftovers.  Service: Courteous and prompt. The host gave me a tip on how to eat the bunuelos to avoid a mishap;)  Side Note: I appreciate that all the prep cooks use black gloves. Not something I usually think about.  Perks: They participate with the FiveStar Rewards program.   Yelp special with your first check in.  Verdict: Definitely, returning w a friend to sample more of the menu!   If the next visit is this positive They will merit an update to 5 stars."}
{"text":"Amazing margaritas. Super nice staff. Food was light yet filling, tasty but not complicated. Price is on lower end which matches well to the less-than-fancy environment.   Well done guys. Keep it up."}
{"text":"A must-try place, now our favorite neighborhood Mexican restaurant. Delicious margaritas accompanied Mexican street corn for starters. I had the chile relent, which was perfectly spicy under their special ranchero sauce. Hubby has a set of 3 tacos called \"3 Piggies\" and they were perfectly yummy!  We topped the meal off with a light flan.  The family is super friendly, too.  Make this a destination!"}
{"text":"Very pleased with this place. I had the chile verde and ate every last bite. Fresh ingredients and amazing flavor!"}
{"text":"This place has totally tasty vegan options!  No lard in the beans or tortillas.  The veggie tacos are served on blue corn tortillas and the veggies are cooked to perfection and aren't oily like at many other restaurants. They custom made a veggie (peppers, onions, and corn), bean, and rice burrito for me that was so delicious. Again, veggies were cooked perfectly without much oil.  The chips were freshly made and pico de gallo was great.  I'll be going back often."}
{"text":"Well we came back and I tried the tacos, definitely NOT a disappointment! I ordered 3 different tacos and they where all awesome, I don't think any of the food from this place would disappoint.  Just don't let the guy pour your Mexican Coke into a glass as that's sacrilege!"}
{"text":"This place was awesome! Good food and great service! There was not a long wait for our food and waiter was very attentive!"}
{"text":"Delicious food! You gotta try it. All together my expectations where exceeded. I recommend their chilaquiles."}
{"text":"The food here was excellent!  The pibil tacos and the quesadilla were great choices.  The pork belly was to die for!  We will be back."}
{"text":"Five fucken stars, I'm giving 5 stars.  I stopped by this place after having a busy morning.  Ok, I'm still eating as I write this review because the food is freakin amazing. Ok, first of, from the outside it doesnt look like much. Some parking in the front but plenty in the back. Not much to the decor, really didn't notice cuz I came here to eat. It has a open kitchen setting like a small cafe only mexican. Menu is pretty simple but thats where things change. I ordered the green chili lunch.  When it was served, it came on its own plate, ok, but get this, food was fresh off the grill like you can see them chef up your food.  No hot plates.  I repeat. NO HOT PLATES. So how many of you all got your plates at a mexican restaurant that wasn't hot.  These arent, cause they serve people who didn't bring oven mitts to handle hot plates. Ok. The food. The green chili was a bit on the spicy side, but good, like hella good.  Rice and beans were on a seperate plate. A first for me. Green chili had the Mexican cheese topping and I think some sour cream.  The corn tortillas they served with it were unlike any other I seen. Maybe it was blue corn, not sure. Sucks I only got 3 tho. Its ok, the food was plenty. No left overs to take. Come check it out. Its yummy."}
{"text":"Absolutely killer Mexican food! The huevos rancheros, chile verde, shrimp cocktail, and menudo (it's a secret menu item!) are all top notch!! This place is totally worth the money."}
{"text":"Visiting Phoenix for vacation and wanted some real deal Mexican food. We certainly found it at Presidio! This was a lesson in not judging a book by its cover. Found in a little strip, the restaurant's ambience is nice but unassuming.   The menu included lots of upscale entree options at reasonable prices $12-$20, plus tacos, starters, and desserts. We ordered the guacamole to start with hot, fresh tortilla chips that hit the spot. The Chili Verde with pork hunks floating in sauce came with the most delicious, beautiful blue corn tortillas I have ever seen. I added the Mole for $2 to Chicken Enchiladas and LOVED every single bite. Seriously, this was the most well-balanced, scrumptious, can-I-lick-the-plate mole I have ever eaten!!! Wish I had had room for dessert; the flan seemed like the obvious go-to.  Service was quick and Jose R. the server was hustling the whole time. The husband and wife who own the restaurant have brought their family recipes to the world and I'm so happy we found Presidio. $60 for two for dinner with drinks. Can't recommend this restaurant gem enough!"}
{"text":"This is over priced food. The quality is okay, it is fresh but $4.95 for a taco de asada that we were told we \"big\" is too much! These tacos were the size of street tacos...small! Queso fundido was $11 and was the size of a small bread plate and came with 4 small street tacos. You can get better Mexican food elsewhere. I ordered two tacos, queso fundido, horchata and it cost me $25."}
{"text":"Food and service are perfection. Best mole I have ever had. With my boyfriend from Texas who said the fajitas and homemade tortillas at amazing. Everything was so delicious. This would be a weekly plac if we lived in the area."}
{"text":"Presidio is my favorite restaurant in the valley! A hidden gem! 10 out of 10 in food, service, atmosphere, everything! As someone who has lived in central Mexico, I can say this food is AUTHENTIC! Fantastic mole, unbelievable tortillas, out-of-this-world cochinita pibil!! A MUST in Phoenix, and a once a week restaurant for me!"}
{"text":"Our friends who live in the area brought us here for breakfast.  Everything we had was fabulous and fresh with these wonderful southwestern sauces and flavors I've tasted nowhere else."}
{"text":"I always know when I have stumbled upon greatness... for a Mexican food  restaurant it starts with the chips and salsa.... pipping hot chips and amazingly tasty salsa!!! The flavors of the dishes are incredible... I shall return"}
{"text":"Excellent service, but the food was average.  Disappointed that the chips and salsa were extra.  Went there for the chili relleno.  They were good but not great.  Beans were okay, rice was moist and tasty."}
{"text":"If u feel like waiting 45 mins to hr for ur food this the place  Had to ask for my money back left hungry"}
{"text":"This is the 2nd time coming here. Best shrimp tacos I've ever had. My wife likes the mahi mahi ceviche. If you like jaimaca, get it. Beans are good. Authentic Mexican food. They play Mexican music in the background; subtle music, not obnoxious. Mixed drinks are shaken."}
{"text":"Delicious, authentic, great customer service, bang for your buck!! I recommend the tacos al pastor and the tortas! Hands down the best salsas I've had and the beans are to die for! Definitely will be visiting again!"}
{"text":"I will start by saying the service here was phenomenal. If your in a 5 star restaurant you usually will not receive this kind of service. That in itself sets this restaurant aside from others. Now the food. My husband had the chilaquiles and they were delicious. I went with there chorizo plate and that was just as good. I am excited to go back and try all the other plates.  Update: I previously gave this restaurant five stars due to their exceptional customer service however we returned back to this restaurant and unfortunately had the opposite experience.  the food was still very good but I have to take away a star because apparently the high level of customer service does not appear to be there standard we just got lucky with our server"}
{"text":"The food here is AMAZING!! we had the Green chilaquiles and the Pancakes and they were delicious!!! HAVENT had SUCH DELICIOUS food from anywhere else! Staff is amazing, greet you as you come in and make you feel welcomed. Very friendly including the owner. Will not be eating anywhere else when we come to Arizona!!"}
{"text":"The owner was super nice and spent A lot of time making my mom and I feel welcomed. The food was awesome and the people are great."}
{"text":"Good experience.  Waiter friendly & attentive.  Food presentation good.  Clean interior.  Chili rellenos for me.  Cheese enchiladas with hot green sauce for my wife.  Yummy!"}
{"text":"My friend and I came around 6:30 pm on a Friday night and were seated right away. It's in walking distance from St. Joe's hospital, which is nice for my friend and my bf who both work there.  We ordered 6 different tacos and liked all of them except one - we aren't sure which one is was though but it had cilantro and onions on it and lacked flavor. My favorites were the chicken and fish. We also ordered the chile relleno which was really good and spicy. The chile was covered in an egg batter. The queso fundido was disappointing. It got cold pretty quickly and stuck to the bowl, so it didn't even taste good. We gave up about halfway through trying to pull the cheese out because our chips kept breaking.  I would definitely come back for the tacos again and try another entrée."}
{"text":"I hate to spoil the abundance of seating when we go for breakfast on Sunday but this place is the bomb as the young golfs would say I have had the huevos rancheros both times I've been here and the wife has chilliquilles both delish service is great as well great music playing this morning as well"}
{"text":"Came for brunch sangria was phenomenal had carne Asada plate which was flavorful. Street corn was amazing the chili popped in my mouth. The corn tortillas are homemade and oh so good. Even the beans danced on my tastebuds.  I had been here when the first opened and it was ok but I am grateful that I tried this again. If there were six stars I would give them that.  Obviously I'll be back!"}
{"text":"The new look and feel is modern and trendy. Enjoyed breakfast.We ordered Huevos rancheros and couple of vegetable tacos. Food was simple, flavorful.  Will return for more."}
{"text":"This restaurant is easily 4 stars in my book.  I had a unique braised marinated pork entree that reminded me of German sauerbraten (must be European influence in Mexico) and that was a nice surprise.  My dinner date had cheese enchiladas that were a bit too spicy for him, but he enjoyed them.  The food quality was great, but we missed having chips and salsa included in our dinner.  If we're paying dinner prices at a nice restaurant, we expected to get chips and salsa with the meal.  This place would easily be 5 stars if chips and salsa were included with dinner and the interior decor was updated a little more (air vent covers were missing from the ceiling, for example).  This does not strike me as the typical Mexican restaurant, the food is more homemade and of better quality, and it gives a nice family vibe.  I would come back to try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"This place was EXCELLENT! Do your tastebuds a solid and eat here. Great service too! I highly recommend you try it."}
{"text":"Formerly Paloma, this place has completely reconstructed the menu as well as the presentation. Very friendly staff, the gentleman at the counter was very enthusiastic and helpful in my selection. I had a few of their tacos, the asada, the carnitas, the pastor and the cochinita pibil and I have to say all were good , but the cochinita pibil was some of the best I've had anywhere. Tender, moist and with a hint of pineapple as I expected with the pastor, in any case, I was satisfied thoroughly. Would definitely be back to try a few other menu items."}
{"text":"Underwhelmed. Unsatisfied. Empty wallet.   These are my main feelings after trying lunch here. I'd read some of the reviews, seen some photos, checked out the menu, I thought I was safe. It was between here and Juan's down the street. Next time I will know better.   I was pretty surprised to see that the \"lunch\" price for enchiladas as $13.95. That's basically a dinner entree. My plate came out warm, but not hot. Portions were small. Two tiny enchiladas. Small portion of unremarkable beans and a scoop of green rice. (Green? Was this because I ordered green sauce?)  The cheese inside the enchiladas was virtually undetectable.   NO CHIPS. Who doesn't give you chips at a Mexican restaurant?   I'm circling back to the $13.95 for the piddling portions. Their website has the price listed at $10.95. Even at $10.95, this would still be a rip.   The flavors weren't even there. It was just okay. No explosion of flavor that actually makes you want to eat the food. I ate mine because I was starving. I still left hungry. The food wasn't bad, it just wasn't very good.   Service was polite, but inattentive. I had to wait a while for my check when I really just wanted to get out and forget the experience.   Won't be returning. Hard pass. I'm actually sad about my dining experience."}
{"text":"TACOS!!! Yeah, I'm a little excited. Al pastor was very good, pollo was great, and chorizo was fantastic! Also, the rice isn't standard Mexican rice, it's wayyy better. Portions are very generous, and my 3 tacos with a huge scoop of rice was 11.85 before tax. Not bad, right? Especially for a place that has very well made, fresh and delicious food (cute servers too). It's easy to miss this place from the street, but it's definitely worth a stop!"}
{"text":"This restaurant was literally the best thing that happened to me in Phoenix.  I wish I would have discovered it sooner, I would have come back for lunch every day!!!    Staff was incredibly friendly, and the food was to DIE for.  I had the Quesadilla Roja con Chicharron.  The crispy pork was packed with so much flavor!   I will DEFINITELY return to Presidio next time I'm in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Awesome experience and food was excellent! Home made tortillas were just like abuelitas. Excellent work Christian for providing excellent customer srvc. chef senso thanks again"}
{"text":"The good : First I'll start with the service. The service was excellent I can't remember the waiter, but he was very excellent. No complaints there. The food is pretty good, I've tried other taco places(joyride,Charlie's,blanco, and other authentic Mexican food) , the quantity of meat to tortilla ratio was good as well. The atmosphere was nice and was practically empty.  The bad: Prices for what you're getting is a little overboard. 5 dollar for a simple carne asada taco is a highway robbery. The advertised happy hour is no longer there, at this time they don't have their website up that may be different now. Drinks were overpriced and on the small side. 10 dollars for a margarita is definitely not worth it in my mind.  All in all was a decent place but will not be returning for the sheer fact that the food was average yet was priced as a 5star restaurant."}
{"text":"Ordered 3 tacos and a horchata.  Carnitas - excellent.  Chorizo - bland but fine.  Shrimp - no shrimp flavor, no grill flavor, too much mayo.  Tortillas and horchata - good, not great.  45 minutes from order to receipt, in a not particularly full restaurant. Maybe the wait issues will get better with time."}
{"text":"The cutest little place with great service and food! We started with really good palomas and chips with guacamole. I had a salad with shrimp that was really tasty and my friend had the elote that was just amazing! The service is fast and all the staff are sweet and attentive. Definitely a place to check out for some traditional Mexican food and good music."}
{"text":"My first review on Yelp. My experience here was so good I felt compelled to make it known. Small unassuming strip mall family restaurant, but from the moment you walk in they make you feel at home. Clean, comfortable, with soft music in background.  Had the Huevas Rancheros. Blown away by the taste, presentation and value. Will be back again for another breakfast or perhaps lunch. Excellent experience."}
{"text":"My brother and I came here for lunch on a Wednesday. Presidio is probably the best Mexican food in downtown Phoenix. We both got three tacos. I got the crispy fish, al pastor and cochinita pibil. My brother got the shrip, al pastor and carne asada one. All of the tacos really exceeded our expectations. The staff is friendly and attentive too!"}
{"text":"gourmet Mexican food. everything was awesome. the chips were hot and the green and red salsas were both yummy. chile relleno was one of the best I've ever had. beans and rice were also fantastic.   the place is in a strip mall, but inside the atmosphere is nice. the service is fantastic, the waiter was very nice."}
{"text":"If you are looking for your state-of-the-art, text Max, American Style mexican food, this is not the place for you. If you're looking to try something out of the box, unique, and full of flavor , then this is the place to try. Local family-owned establishment. Definitely a place I will frequent more often."}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp.  The green salsa is very good.  I love the menu as its not too much but really has a great variety of options.  I had fish tacos and they were good.  The margaritas are for sure some of the best I've had in Phoenix.  They actually knew what chili torreados were so that's a big plus.  I have to say I totally over-ate as its my bad day but man what a better place to be! We also ordered the Mahi ceviche with guajillo!  The tamale was awesome too!  I'm hooked and now I'll be coming here for sure for fresh food.  Be patient because all the food is made real-time and fresh.  Seriously very good - amazing.  Friendly service and I love the environment."}
{"text":"A very nice place, the food was fantastic. It was too expensive, but the quality should always come first when dining out."}
{"text":"Everything about our meal was fantastic! We walked in to see fresh corn tortillas being cooked from scratch. We were seated quickly and absolutely enjoyed our meal. Everything tasted fresh and homemade to perfection. The food was literally perfect from presentation to flavors, textures to temperature, everything was so good! The chefs were friendly and our server attentive. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Loving. This little place is not what you would expect when you think of a traditional Mexican restaurant. It's quiet and quaint. But full of love. It shows in every aspect of the restaurant. From the floor to the ceiling. But especially from the staff. They might not be the quickest. But the are genuine and sweet. What was really touching was when a woman from the kitchen came out to excitedly exclaimed about how they make everything from scratch when we told her about how much we loved our meals. End with the flan  . We will go back here again and again to feel the love and warmth from this place."}
{"text":"Presidio is one of those Mexican spots you accidentally drive past 3 times before you find it. Parking is back behind the restaurant and you can enter through a door in the back, basically walking by the bathrooms and kitchen before entering the dining room.  The food here is simple, but delicious. Chips seem to always come straight out of the fryer; they're always hot and served with a delicious, smoking salsa. The street corn is some of the best I've had. There's enough spice to make it interesting, but it's not too overpowering and doesn't mask the other flavors.  I ordered several tacos to try them out. All were served on house-made purple corn tortillas, which are not only beautiful, but also delicious. The carne asada and al pastor tacos were awesome and I was shocked by the freshness of the fish taco. The chipotle mayo is really a game-changer.  I wasn't thrilled with the guacamole, especially for the price, and would suggest getting extra street corn for a starter instead!"}
{"text":"I've come here many times and I've been impressed and hairy surprised each time. The tacos during happy hour are amazing and such a good deal! The service is always top notch, I've taken many friends from out of town and they have all loved the food too!"}
{"text":"Mexican food in Phoenix is generally some of the worst, most tasteless, greasiest Mexican food I've ever had. I'm told by many that's because the Mexican food here is based on the style of food from Sonora, Mexico. I don't know if that's true, but I'm always on the hunt for a killer Mexican place that elevates the normally bland, tasteless fare that we have around town.  BAM! Presidio will make your taste buds dance! Located in a small strip mall, it's probably not a place that would command your attention. I found them based on all the great reviews here, and I was not disappointed! My husband ordered the huevos rancheros and he was very impressed. The depth of flavor was unexpected and truly satisfying.  I ordered the carne asada. It was delicious and cooked to perfection. The corn tortillas looked and tasted like they were freshly prepared as they took a bit longer to cook. We also ordered the Totopos con Chile appetizer - forgive the spelling, I'm going from memory. It was super delicious, hearty, and satisfying. Highly recommended.  This is not a fine dining experience, this isn't that kind of 5-star review. But if you want a punch of flavor that will knock you out, in a pleasant atmosphere with cooks and service staff that exude a happiness in what they do, this is the place for you! :)"}
{"text":"I love this place! It reminds me of home cooked meals :) the place is clean and friendly staff! You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This place was great, we went here right before the lunch rush and service was great I highly recommend their breakfast as I'm sure lunch and dinner (if they have it is great as well) but we went for breakfast and it was awesome!!"}
{"text":"So far I'm 2 for 2 with great restaurants in Arizona this spot is absolutely delicious if you're ever in the area I highly recommend the two enchiladas with green sauce and one red tamale :)"}
{"text":"This place is hands down the best local Mexican in CenPho. Still easy to get a table and the food is authentic and really tasty. Definitely a favorite!!"}
{"text":"Tasty Tacos  Take one bite of the Al Pastor taco, and your taste buds will know that Presidio Cocina Mexicana has  taco making down to a science. This  no-frills Phoenix restaurant serves their Al Pastor tacos with slow roasted pork on a corn tortilla with avocado,  spicy tomatillo sauce, topped with onion and cilantro.  These taco are tangy, spicy, creamy, crunchy  a winning balance of flavor and texture.  All their entrees at Presidio are made from scratch. The Al Pastor and Carne Asada Tacos are delicious. Each meat had its own homemade unique and flavorful sauce.  I cant wait to go back and try more of what Presidio has to offer.   In addition, to flavorful food Presidio makes Horchata and Jamaica daily.  The Jamaica is refreshing  and makes a great accompaniment to the meal.  If your looking for great tacos and friendly service, make your way to Presidio, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Good, solid Mexican cuisine. Good service. Nothing exceptional, though - a solid 3-star."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!    Extremely fresh ingredients.  Best shrimp tacos I have ever had, which is insane because I am from California and have had a lot of good ones.    I only wish adding avocado was more reasonably priced, but everything was stellar and even the coffee is great quality."}
{"text":"Excellent meal and friendly service........recently opened so it was slow on the night we went there.  The food and appetizers we ordered were excellent and the service was fast and friendly.  I think everything is made on-site including the tortillas.....prices are extremly reasonable   Definitely you should try it!"}
{"text":"Nastiest menudo of my life! Hard as heck nasty flavor has to have come out if a can. Never going back wanted to try something similar to barrio café but this place will never be as good. Had high hopes but was let BAD"}
{"text":"I don't get to this area as much as I used to. I came here expecting the little old Mexican place that used to be here.  I'm not sure how long this restaurant has been here. They have remodeled completely.   The entire staff was quite pleasant. My enchiladas came out fairly quick.  Boy were they delicious! Covered in what I think was Feta Cheese. The rice was delicious..tasted fresh. I gobbled everything up, I'm full but it tasted so good I want more.  I'll go a bit out of my way to get back here soon to try some other things on the menu."}
{"text":"Came with some friends looking for some good Mexican food. We sat down, took a look at the menu and choose the breakfast menu.   We ordered chilaquiles and added the cochinita... it was spectacular. The chips were hot and crunchy, the eggs were cooked perfectly. The sauce was absolutely delicious and the cochinita was sooo flavorful.   Highly recommend this place. Staff was friendly but the food estaba rico."}
{"text":"We are still mourning the loss of La Tolteca.  The ratings here seemed to be outstanding, so maybe this is a replacement??  The server was very friendly and helpful.  Big guy.  Very nice.  We opted for some predictable Mexican dishes so we could compare to other places.  Normally I use the chimi for that, but they didn't seem to have that on the menu.  We ordered guacamole and chips (this is not gratis), a burrito, a tamale, and two enchiladas.  Nothing fancy.  The guacamole was very good.  The salsas were pretty good too (they come with the guac).  The chips were fresh and hot from the oil.  The burrito was large and flavorful.  The server said he would choose the filling for us, and he chose cochinita (if I recall what he said).  We also got the green chile tamale, two chicken enchiladas (1 red sauce, 1 green sauce).  Plus rice and beans (included with the tamale and enchiladas).  The beans were your basic refried beans.  OK as a chip dip, but nothing special.  The rice was better.  Had a slightly different flavor to it.  It was nice.  The tamale had a little kick.  The masa was dense, but the flavor was good.  The burrito was in a red sauce, and it was really good.  The enchiladas were fine also.  Overall a respectable performance.  As they got busier service became less attentive.  Makes sense, but they should have made a point of checking back anyway.  This is not La Tolteca, but it's pretty good. If we come back we'll have to try some different things."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved this place! Only in town for 1 night and this was the perfect spot for authentic, local flavor. The chorizo and carnitas were perfect, the margarita just right, and the service impeccable. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I had the quesadilla with pork belly.  It was really tasty.  For such a small place, they accommodated our party of 20 well.  Props to them for keeping up with our orders.  I really would like to check out this place for brunch as I do love chilaquiles and huevos rancheros and menudo.  Next time, Phoenix."}
{"text":"Excellent food.  Excellent service.  Excellent everything.  My Mom had the Chili Relleno, and I had the Carne Asada, Shrimp, and Fish Tacos.   The owners, cooks and wait staff were all extra friendly too.  We will return."}
{"text":"Diet Coke - nice little hole in the wall. Decors is Spartan - best thing is that it is right across from the front of the hospital - much better than hospital food. Everything is as it should be - no free chips but this is more of a breakfast lunch place from what I can see.  The music was good - Mexican typical but not too loud and good choices"}
{"text":"Came for breakfast and had the Huevos Rancheros. The food was amazing. Authentic mexican. Would recommend this place to anyone. So good!"}
{"text":"This is a random place off of Thomas across the street from St. Joe hospital. We got an orange juice, cappuccino, bunelos, and breakfast tacos! DELICIOUS!   The chorizo on the tacos was cooked just right flavorful! The eggs cooked medium well came out soooo good and the salsa and cojita cheese topped it off! We we definitely come again!!!! Try it"}
{"text":"Horchata was very nice. Carne asada, fish, and shrimp tacos also very good. Mexican street corn was excellent although a little over-cheesed. Service quite slow. Decor surprisingly refined--not fussy, just clean and elegant."}
{"text":"This place has great reviews and I really really wanted to like them.  The location is kind of odd and parking is slim. There was a lady smoking right by the door (I get horrible headaches from smoke) so that was not a very good start. I think places of business should pay attention to that kind of details, since it is clearly a violation of city codes.  Came here with a group of 4 and they all wanted to turn back when we got to the door.   The place was very small, and it felt kind of crowded. Once we got the menu, we were a little surprised by the limited options and the prices... which seemed not fitting for the kind of location. Again, the rest of my party wanted to leave. I asked them to stay and order an appetizer, and then decide. We went for queso fundido ($10.95).  I am so glad we did this instead of ordering our food.  What we got was a ridiculous tiny portion of queso fundido. Questionable even for a one person portion. It was super tiny...  That said, we all sampled the cheese, asked for the check, and left.  Our server was very friendly and professional, and that part was great. But it would have been very expensive for a group of 4 to eat here if the rest of the items were to be like the queso fundido experience. I am OK with paying higher prices for good food, but I want the rest of the experience to match the price. This is a tiny unremarkable location with tiny portions and sort of upscale prices."}
{"text":"So glad to of found this place. Food is so authentic and fresh. We will come every day while we are here in Arizona visiting with my nephew at the hospital."}
{"text":"My friend and I were in town from Chicago, and were looking for a good Mexican breakfast. Presidio did not disappoint! We started with the elote, which was one of the best we have tried. The Huevos Racheros were flavorful, and not too heavy or soggy. My friend ordered the Chile Relleno, which was also really tasty. Portions were great, the service was casual and friendly. Would definitely go back a second time - we almost did before we went back home!"}
{"text":"So extremely glad that I dropped by this place for dinner! In terms of food, we ordered the totopos con chile elote, the chile relleno plate, 3 al pastor tacos (for my friend), and 1 veggie taco. I know, I know, slight overkill in terms of amount of food for 2 people, but I just wanted to try a little bit of everything!   Now in terms of flavor, everything was literally a 10/10 for me. I absolutely loved every single thing I tried and seriously cannot wait to go back and try even more things!! My fave in terms of appetizers was definitely the totopos con chile. Definitely hit the spot! The chile relleno was a great main dish and came with a hefty serving of rice, beans, a small side salad, and some delicious tortillas! The veggie taco had great flavor and is definitely something I can see myself getting again. My friend also really enjoyed his al pastor tacos! My only regret was that we were way too full to try out any of their desserts (aka this is my excuse to go back and stuff my face full of food part 2).   I highly recommend this place, especially if you are in the area! You do not want to miss out on the great food here."}
{"text":"My wife and I ate breakfast here on a Saturday morning and were favorably impressed. Based on the Yelp reviews we expected that we might find a waiting line when we arrived. To our benefit we were the only ones in the restaurant. We both had the Huevos Rancheros which was two eggs on crisp fried tortillas smothered with a roasted red salsa, refried beans, and pappas fritas con chorizo. $10.95 seemed like a reasonable rice to us. The coffee was HOT which is how I want it to be served. The service was good but their system was never stressed as there was only one other customer while we were there.   My recommendation is visit this place for breakfast before it gets discovered and a waiting line develops."}
{"text":"I live close by to presidio and is always one of my to go places for breakfast. They serve authentic Mexican food. Mostly everything is homemade including their delicious tortillas. This time I had the chicarron quesadilla, lt looks and tasted delicious."}
{"text":"Omg! I think this is the BEST chile verde I have ever had. Delicious guacamole, fresh chips, awesome tortillas and really great service. A neighborhood gem, that is for sure!"}
{"text":"It is my second time eating here and by far, it is one of my favorite Mexican food restaurants already. The food is actual recipes from traditional Mexican food. Hand Made tortillas with menudo just doesn't get any better. So far my favorite dishes are the cochinita pibil and the chile verde. I totally recommend it; the people here are awesome."}
{"text":"Food and service was perfect ! I dont see why there would be any bad reviews on this place , i know forsure I found myself a new favorite spot to eat at . :)"}
{"text":"We went there for lunch the food was very delicious dairy fresh I had chicken flautas delicious There are five of us everybody in the party love the food we all had dessert it was awesome I would highly recommend this restaurant our waitstaff was wonderful he was very concerned and very caring about everything specially the flan which was delicious I will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Best Mexican . Street tacos excellent. Margaritas great. MahI Mahi delectable. Guacamole deelish. On a recent trip to Phoenix went here 3 times in 10 days. Chicken breast was a big hit.  Chef is friendly."}
{"text":"Excellent quality ingredients. More cuisine than just mexican food. Nice presentation. This place is surpriaingly good. And service is fantastic. Great place. Nice ambiance. The corn is a must! Everything I've had is great."}
{"text":"When we landed after our 21 hour journey we were tired but couldn't miss an opportunity for a good Tex-Mex dinner. I have been craving chili verde and finally got my fix here.  This place is amazing. Food is honest, simple, quality.  Service was attentive and polite.  If I am ever in Phoenix again I will come back and eat here"}
{"text":"This place is so freaking delicious. You want real authentic Mexican food? Well this is the place. I ordered the pancakes which were so fluffy and just right and I also got the Huevos Rancheros. I honestly can say it is the best Mexican food in town! Great customer service, clean and friendly place. Can't wait to come back again!!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious, authentic Mexican food for a reasonable price. I had the chorizo and al pastor tacos, plus the guacamole appetizer and it was heaven. The chips came out fire hot and fresh from the fryer, the tacos were on homemade corn tortillas, and I had my bottle of Mexican Coca-Cola to wash it down. Very friendly cooks and attentive staff."}
{"text":"This review is for 3.5 stars.  Just a typical Mexican restaurant.  Food is better prepared than a Tex Mex but tastes pretty similar.  I was hoping for a Mexican flare on food for a fusion type rather than all-but Mexican, but came out disappointed.  The breakfast included Mexican omelettes and chilaquiles and huevos rancheros, but nothing too crazy or experimental.  The regular items were mainly tacos and platters.  I had a few tacos (pollo, steak, chorizo) and substituted my side for some tasty off the cob Mexican corn for another $2+.  The tacos were tasty, especially the corn tortilla and steak variety, but nothing spectacular.  The chilaquiles looked very bland with only a few ingredients.  The chicken was pulled and good but the dish itself had sauce and chicken and tortilla, and that's about it.  A miss for me in Phoenix."}
{"text":"While visiting Phoenix, I decided to try Presidio Cocina Mexicana for dinner after reading the reviews.  The restaurant is a nice, small, simple, local place.  However, buyer beware!  The prices listed on their online menu are significantly lower than the price you will actually pay.  Bait and switch must be legal in Arizona.  Looking at the dinner menu, I was surprised at how expensive all of the entrées were considering this was a \"hole-in-the-wall\" type restaurant.  I chose the chicken enchiladas for $18.95.  (Their menu online lists the entrée as $10.95.)  In addition to refried beans, rice, and a small salad, I got three, chicken enchiladas that were still cold in spots.  Chips and salsa, while standard at most Mexican restaurants, apparently were extra at Presidio Cocina Mexicana.  My total bill, including tax, for the enchilada entrée and a glass of water was over $20.  In my opinion, it was overpriced.    Presidio Cocina Mexicana was nice to try once, but I wouldn't rush to go back there.  I think there are better options."}
{"text":"The more I come here the more I realize it is one of my favorite restaurants in Phoenix.  I brought a friend from Mexico and she came back two days in a row saying that it was the most delicious and authentic Mexican restaurant in the Phoenix area.  Also, for heaven's sakes, have a caffe latte while here.  Everything here is delicious and the ingredients are high high quality."}
{"text":"Adorable venue in a surprising spot as a strip mall.  The food is wonderful, there is a great wine selection, and the service is kind and efficient. It's certainly higher priced for tacos but the food is higher end and worth it."}
{"text":"This is probably as amazing as it gets for stumbling upon a place you've never been before. Yesterday was mine & my boyfriends first time (despite the five minute walk from our place). We were greeted by Jose who ended up being our outstanding server! Our lunch began with two margaritas, house made guacamole & assorted salsas! Being our first time we went ahead and ordered shrimp tacos, Pozole, and a burrito! The food was nostalgic & reminded me of my families cooking growing up! Especially the Pozole! We had to pass on flan yesterday because we left with plenty more to eat! I look forward to my next visit!"}
{"text":"This place is so good. I mean really good. The flavors are fresh, not heavy. The rice and beans are great. You can tell a lot about a place based on their beans...this place delivers. Had the conchinita pibil and my lady had the enchiladas. Both were outstanding. The pork on the pibil was so tender! The agua chile appetizer was awesome with the shrimp cooked in lime juice and pickled red onion! The heat was there but not overly spicy. Also had a nice cocktail with chartreuse, anejo tequila and serrano that was very well  balanced!  Kudos to these guys and a great family owned spot in central Phoenix! We will be back!"}
{"text":"I like this little place!  Most of the breakfast/brunch places around are swamped and slow. The service here is friendly and quick. And the food is really really good. I recommend the presidio tacos for breakfast.   The prices are reasonable too.  It's clean and cute inside. Check it out! You won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"Fantastic, authentic Mexican food, great service and a very short wait!!! Awesome atmosphere, highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Had the al Pastor tacos beans and rice.  The tacos are really good with a nice spice to them.  They are street size and really very good. Beans and rice where ok.  I would gladly go back here when in the area"}
{"text":"The best Mexican food I've ever had! The El Pastor taco was so bomb!! I only ordered 2 but I should have gone for 10!!! Tomatio sauce is the best! Karen is the owner along with her boyfriend and they have such a cute little restaurant with great customer service and an amazing selection of affordable prices dishes."}
{"text":"The food is authentic and delicious, especially the Mexican street corn.  The tortilla chips are fresh made and the guacamole was also fresh made and just as delicious as the rest of the menu items we tried. We had tacos, tamales, enchiladas, beans, rice and all were simply awesome. The service was friendly, fast and accommodating. We highly recommend this restaurant and will return the next time we are in town."}
{"text":"Awesome service! My sister and I had a delicious flan for dessert. We will definitely come again soon."}
{"text":"We Yelped this place and I have to say that the food is +! The food and service was superb! We had the Chilaquiles, Huevos Rancheros and tacos with a horchata. Very delish and we would definitely go there again!"}
{"text":"Very good tacos. Got three little piggies at lunch. The pibil was excellent!  Guacamole appetizer was good but not particularly robust.  Service was very good. Very friendly.  A little pricey for lunch."}
{"text":"Fantastic take on traditional Mexican cuisine.  Customer service was top notch and the tacos are out of this world.  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I was expecting a lot more from the food and service, because has so many good reviews here in Yelp.  I ate in and I didn't get chips and salsa while waiting.  I ordered a $10 Carne asada burrito and it looked presentable and the carne asada seem fresh but it had so much fat that I kept digging it out. I also was expecting good Mexican salsa and I got disappointed too. The place is small inside but is  clean. I probably wouldn't go back for a burrito to Presidio Cosina Mexicana, because I could get the same burrito in any other place for $5."}
{"text":"THE BEST FOOD IN DOWNTOWN.  Try child verde or red pozole . For sweets THE BEST ALFFOGATO. Come early, they don't take reservations."}
{"text":"Great spot for a delicious authentic Mexican meal. Can be a little pricey. But you get what you pay for. I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"Wow!!! I was very pleased with my street corn and cheese enchiladas! The red sauce tasted almost like my grandmothers!!!!! That has never happened before! The host/server was very polite and welcoming. With all of the options in central Phoenix this place is at the top of the list. Please don't hesitate to stop in. I came with my mother and grandmother. There were couples on dates, older couples and families."}
{"text":"Just tried dinner here.  I was the only person there but I went for it anyway. I am so glad that I did! I had the Chile Verde and it was fantastic! I really enjoyed every bite! Then I had the cookie desert thing which was Delish! Great service so people need to go here for dinner it's a great choice!"}
{"text":"Arrived to an empty restaurant so I was quickly greeted and seated - awesome.  Ordered the queso which includes chorizo.  I was expecting a nacho cheese like consistency.  Instead I received what was essentially string cheese and chorizo.  The queso was served with warm tortillas.  It was difficult to scrape the queso out of the bowl and apply it to the tortilla.   I ordered a carne asada burrito for my entre.  Menu says the burrito includes rice and beans.  Well, it does but the rice and beans are inside the burro.  Was not expecting that at all.  Not sure if chips and salsa are extra - I had to ask for them.  They did honor the Yelp check in code.  Food was good - just not even close to what I expected."}
{"text":"Drove a ways to try this great new restaurant based on some friends' reviews. I checked their Yelp page and loved the photos and really loved the video. The food and service were fantastic, I can't rave enough about my lunch.  The menu is extensive but simple and they offer breakfast all day.  The food was fresh, balanced, and bold flavored.  Great job!"}
{"text":"Dear Presidio.    Thank you for lunch. Unfortunately you didn't let my fiancé  add the salsa she wanted on her huevos. Then, when she had to scoop off the salsa that comes with it, you charged her for the other side of salsa and the cheese (about 2 tbsp ea) 2.25 ea and the 2.25 for the same size serving of sour cream and me 2.00 to get half red and half green sauce on my burrito which comes with sauce.  Oh and 1.00 for a tablespoon of onions.  Really?  The bill with the 4x6$ mimosas for three people 75$ including the nickel and dime up charges for the sides is a bit pricy for only ok food. All said the up charging left a pretty bad taste in my mouth. Have been here several times before however we won't be back."}
{"text":"We went for breakfast. Great atmosphere and  they had a unique but small menu. The food was excellent and the chef/owner stopped by our table which is always a nice touch."}
{"text":"Oh wow!!!  So yummy!!!! I got a chicken green tamale and chicken read enchilada. They were sooo very flavorful!!!   I can't decide which one I like more. So I guess I'm going to have to get both next time I come ;)"}
{"text":"We were rather surprised when our group of 8 arrived and the place was not packed because of their 4-1/2 star rating. It did get busier as noon rolled around. Definitely a gem hidden in a strip mall. Within reason they will modify many of their dishes. Very good service. We had 8 different dishes and everybody loved what they ate. I had trouble finishing my red chicken enchilada entree as the portions were generous. We all found parking in front but there is a larger lot out back too."}
{"text":"Some of the most authentic and wonderful Mexican food. I had lamb!!!! So gewwwwwwdddddd!! We had the street corn and pork belly too.  Service was top notch.  Loved it"}
{"text":"This place is easy to miss but thanks to L, she snapped pics and told me what to look for!  We met for happy hour and the place was pretty empty.  It was nice and clean.  And the staff is super helpful and friendly.  I got the chicken taquitos, they were crispy with guacamole, sour cream, and pico de gallo.  They were very good!  I could have eaten other plate.  I ordered the fish taco from the happy hour menu.  OMG, must order and inhale!  It was very good and not greasy!    The server was so helpful to explain the menu and the food.  What he suggested and his favorites.  The buñuelo was so so good!  Crispy, light, and yummy!"}
{"text":"Our new favorite for authentic, beautiful Mexican food. You can't go wrong with any of the dishes. The green chili pork is the best in the valley!"}
{"text":"I can only give Presidio 5 stars? That's a shame. First, the service was excellent. We were a table of seven people. Our waitress, Luna, knew the menu and let us know orders would be coming one or two at time due to every item was freshly made. I can tell you it was worth every minute and penny.  For $15 I got jamaica, Mexican street corn, a veggie  taco, an al pastor taco, and a buñuelo with strawberries and whipped cream.   A long time ago,  let lived in Cuernavaca, Mexico. I would get the street corn, grilled with mayo, grated hard cheese, and chili. I added a bit of lime juice to mine. Seventh heaven! The taco al pastor, street style (soft taco) was so generously filled with bits of pork, guacamole, grilled onion, pineapple, and a bit of cilantro. OMG, really tasty.  But, the vegetable taco, filled enough with black beans, grilled bell pepper, onion, guac, and a mild tomatillo salsa, I had to use my fork instead of picking it up, tasted fresh. I would have ordered another, but I was saving room for my buñeulo.  I was so right... small, crispy, similar to a Swedish rossette, with a few slices of strawberry and a dollop of whipped cream. Worth missing the second veggie taco! The only negative comment I heard was the flan was just average.  Looking around the table, I didn't see any plates with food on them. Hmm... Presidio has only been open three months. If word of mouth will get you here, I'm talking."}
{"text":"Service was great. Clean, Friendly staff, and the wait for our fresh food was minimal! We got the street corn, fish taco, cárnitas taco, chorizo burrito, and green chicken enchiladas. Everything was pretty authentic and tasty! We drove from Peoria to go try this place and we'll be back to try other items next time!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing, great food, awesome customer service. Additional parking in rear. I recommend 100% we will definitely be coming here often! I couldn't believe they have only been open for a month, everything about this place was wonderful!"}
{"text":"This is hands-down the best authentic mexican food I've ever had. Everything is made from scratch and family- owned and run. The the pasole is fantastic! The chili relleno is spot on. If youre looking for an affordable from-scratch meal, this is the place."}
{"text":"Wowww the food was AMAZING!! Hands down, no questions asked!! We were looking for a place to have good Mexican breakfast & we were not disappointed. We're visiting from California & this place has now became a stop on our list of \"must do's\""}
{"text":"Omg! Delicious-Jose was so polite, We had chili verde, green chicken enchiladas  My son taco red sauce and the horchata Everything fresh and home made tortillas everything with Flavor and big portions. We will be back! Jose said ,breakfast too on Sunday's and lunch specials."}
{"text":"With all the great reviews I had high expectations.  I found it to be mediocre food in a drab setting that is priced as if it were a Parisian cafe (ie very expensive for what you get).  Perhaps proximity to the hospital has inspired them to use the health care pricing model. I wont be going back.  There is plenty of better Mexican food at lower prices in this town."}
{"text":"All the glowing reviews for Presidio drew us in, but the food cemented it's 5 star status in our eyes.  The chips came straight out of the fryer so they were piping hot when they got to our table.  The salsa containers were small but each one was very tasty and paired well with our entrees.  It was a little disappointing that they weren't included in the meal, but they were good nonetheless.    We ordered the green chile verde pork with flour tortillas and the chicken enchilada plate.  The tortillas were obviously fresh and came to our table very hot.  The pork was juicy and tender and the green chile sauce was delicious.  The lettuce mixture on the plate of chicken enchiladas had some sort of avocado dressing on it that I wanted to drink.  Yum!  We were very happy with our meal as well as the service.    The menu said that happy hour was from 4-6pm.  We asked about it and they said it was only Monday through Friday.  I think that should be added to the menu."}
{"text":"So so so good. Fresh ingredients with lots of fresh cotija cheese. We ordered Enchiladas with red sauce and an array of tacos. Red sauce was really flavorful and they had Tacos for every flavor pallet (shrimp, carne asada, chicken, al pastor, chorizo, chicharrones, pork- each with different topping combinations) Also, chips are hot and made-to-order. Wish we would have gone during dinner/HH to try a marg!"}
{"text":"Chilaquiles! Chilaquiles! Chilaquiles.  The best place to have chilaquiles. Service is quick and friendly and food is prepared fast.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Excellent meal, a little mom and pop joint that is highly recommended.  Fresh veggies and seafood plus excellent service."}
{"text":"First time here and what an experience!  Home made tortillas, great Alpastor tacos and the ambiance was wonderful!  Thank you!"}
{"text":"Amazing food. Very nice service! Only open in last 11 months but they are rocking. I had brunch here and it was excellent. No layers of cheese but just good quality food cooked in front of you."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery of 2 Carne Asada burritos and the green chicken enchiladas.  Will packaged and great green and red salsa on the side.    1. The good/very good: green chicken enchiladas were outstanding.  Side of beans and rice also excellent.  Really so tasty.  2.  Carne Asada burritos: not even adequate.  Mostly beans and carne asada was sub par and low quality. Pretty much indelible and threw away."}
{"text":"Last day of our AZ vacation we stopped here for breakfast and are so glad we did. Delicious food and excellent service. It was 9:50AM on a Tuesday so we were the only people there and the  staff were so friendly! I had the chilaquiles and husband had the huevos rancheros - both were top notch."}
{"text":"The food here was great, very authentic. Unfortunately the service did not meet the same expectations. Was charged for something I didn't order and the response I got ruined my expirience there."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Just tried it yesterday for the first time and it definitely won't be my last.   I was looking for a good place for tacos in the area because I just started working down the street. This place has some of the best carne asada I've ever had. Plus their Mexican street corn....OH MY GOD. Ridiculous. Not to mention the service is top notch.   I'll definitely be back.  Oh and Jose R. is THE MAN."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Mexican food restaurant! I found this place when my father was in the hospital for a bit. Now my husband and I drive from Ahwatukee when we crave  Mexican food. We have had the Mexican corn, flautas, chili rellenos, all of which are wonderfully tasty but my all time favorite is the shrimp taco. Holy moly those are delicious! We also love their Mexican wedding cookies, so yummy.  Staff is always very nice, even our favorite cook is all smiles when we come in and always wants to know if we are enjoying our meal. You're gonna pay a bit more for the food but hey, you get what you pay for and I don't mind spending money on good food."}
{"text":"Absolutely incredible, no bullshit, straight-up, authentic, sloppy delicious beautiful Mexican food.  My man and I came here one morning for breakfast and unfortunately by the time we got there, they were out of bunuelos. I ordered the Chilaquiles and my man ordered the Chorizo burrito.  My chilaquiles were perfect - juxtaposing textures of crunchiness and warm decadent sauce, traditional spices, a runny egg. The chorizo burrito was packed with mouthwatering flavor and freshness.  We also ordered a caramel iced coffee, which was bold and smooth.  I love simple menus where anything you pick is a winner.   Nothing overdone, everything as it should be."}
{"text":"I think I found my new go-to Mexican restaurant! No wait, not busy, reasonable prices, great service, and tasty food!!! They even have happy hour during the week with $2 tacos.   Our order: two horchata drinks, Chile Rellenos, one shrimp and one fish taco. Everything was so delicious and we didn't leave anything on our plates! We got our check and with a Yelp check in, we got 10% off.   I recommend parking in the back because it can get kinda crazy trying to park in the front of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Very yummy food, but very overpriced. 3 people, 7 bite-size tacos, three small Taquitos, 6 margaritas and a flan... what would you expect that to cost at your favorite Mexican restaurant? $130? That's what it cost us. Outrageous! When we walked in we asked about their happy hour and taco Tuesday that we had read about on Yelp, the nice waiter said that the owners did away with that a month ago. We should have left, but the food had gotten wonderful reviews. The reviews were right, the food was very good.The service was excellent also, although they got my taco order wrong twice. The margaritas were tasty but minuscule at $10 a pop. These are the kind of prices you expect at a fine dining establishment not at a plainly decorated strip mall restaurant across from a hospital. If they bring back their happy hour and taco Tuesdays, I might give them another chance. Otherwise there's plenty of other yummy Mexican restaurants to go to that are more reasonably priced."}
{"text":"My husband LOVED their posole and I had their tacos which were delicious! We weren't that hungry when we arrived, but everything was so good we ate it all! Their salsa is spicy so if you're a wimp (like me), ask for it on the side!"}
{"text":"Delicious food. The shrimp tacos were off the charts!! Great service. Margaritas could be a tad larger."}
{"text":"Delicious!  Friendly quick service. Loved it!  Try the enchiladas. The green sauce was amazing."}
{"text":"Food was ok. Got the omelet, which tasted good. The potatoes were bland with absolutely no flavor. I share my food with my 3 year old, so I was still hungry after and decided to order a desert. Desert was $5/$6. The lady brings out a desert as small as an Oreo cookie! Not at all impressed! It was three butter cookies with Carmel and nuts in between each with some powdered sugar on top. Tasted great, but was done in 3 bites. Waitress brought us the bill and mentioned that she gave $1.25 off the desert because it was actually suppose to be bigger but they didn't have the bigger cookies. So basically we paid $4 for an Oreo cookie. Sorry but this place needs to work on a lot of things before I return. The only good thing going for them is that the server was nice and replaced the coffee two different times (because the first two were cold) and made it in their special espresso machine to make it especially hot for us. 2 stars for that and the ok food."}
{"text":"Where and how do I begin?  I left Phoenix in 2011 but still have a residence here and just discovered this place over the weekend. My husband was on the hunt for Chilaquiles. We found this place on Yelp and as were driving there (30 minutes from our place) i was thinking, this better be worth it.  We had just eaten at Hash House in Scottsdale the day before and I didn't think we could top it. OMG, yes we did.  Presidio food is LEGIT and so, so good. We ended up sitting at the bar, and ended up conversing with the owner who is just so genuine and you can tell they have a passion for serving the BEST food!  We ordered the Mexican corn to start, chilaquiles for my husband and breakfast tacos for me.  Mexican corn, was so incredibly smooth and had a little kick in the end. No way is it healthy for you but worth every kernel.  Chilaquiles was the star.  The red sauce was so good and each chip was covered in this deliciousness.  The breakfast tacos were so filling and the chorizo was not greasy and had great flavor.  THEN, the owner gives us a plate of chips with green salsa.  HEAVEN.  I preferred the green sauce but based on what we ordered, I really don't think you can go wrong with dishes at this joint. I love supporting local businesses and this one is THE BEST!!!!  Please keep serving up all of the delicious food and we will be back the next time we are in town!!!"}
{"text":"We did a to-go order.  We all got items with steak and it was delicious.  Very well seasoned and tender.  Not huge portions, but good quality food.  The only negatives were that the tortillas were left out of the order for the carne asada plate, and while it was delicious, the order of guacamole was quite pricy for the size.  Overall we really enjoyed the food."}
{"text":"Great Horchata! Quesadilla was good, the pork was not warm enough but all in all it had good flavor. I'd say portion size for this item is small. You get rice no beans. I did order a side of beans and they were really good. The service was good, he was polite, attentive and the food was served very quickly! I would love to see more pictures of their menu items. The menu does not show any and Yelp has limited photos."}
{"text":"Met a friend here for brunch.  Had the huevos rancheros at the suggestion of another friend.  So glad I listened!  The huevos rancheros was delicious and the best I've had.  I loved the salsa on it and the heat that accompanied it.  A family was in there and as they paid complimented on the food being 10.  They said they found this place while driving through town on yelp and decided to stop in.  They also left super happy.  This is a great brunch spot.  I look forward to coming back, and hopefully having enough room to try the Paloma drink next time."}
{"text":"Wow!! I am known to be a picky eater, especially when it comes to Mexican food. I want the real deal. None of this chain stuff. This place blew me away. I had 3 tacos with rice and beans. Delicious!! The rice and beans are just like my mother makes and taste just like them. I was literally smiling the whole time. I believe I found my go to spot when it comes to Mexican food. Authentic at its finest. What also blew me away, is everything is made to order.. you can see them putting chopped up tortillas in the fryer to make chips for the salsa. I will be honest, reading past reviews I was skeptical on coming here. Glad I took a chance and for sure will be back soon."}
{"text":"Delicious Mexican food  Style is not Sonoran but rather Michocan style so their spicy runs a little hotter. Classy clean and good food. I'll keep coming back for sure."}
{"text":"Yummy! Frequent many of the fave Mexican places in the area Santisma. Most Wanted Taco shop and I can happily say that Presidio is right up there with the best.   Ordered the green enchilada (cheese) plate, the sauce was wonderfully flavorful with the right touch of heat and a definite must try. It tasted homemade and was wonderful. Haven't had anything better anywhere else.   My wife and I will definitely be back to explore the other menu items."}
{"text":"One of the BEST Mexican food restaurants around town! Came in for breakfast, had green and red chilaquiles, and pancakes. Everything was DELICIOUS! The pancakes had a hint of my favorite spice, CINNAMON!!!!! The restaurant owner Lucy stopped by our table and spoke with us about how she started the restaurant and a little history behind it. She was very pleasant to speak to and enhanced my experience here at the restaurant.   I would OF COURSE come back again, and DEFINITELY recommend it to a friend!!!!    P.S. EVERYTHING is made from scratch using passed down family recipes!"}
{"text":"This small, family owned Mexican restaurant will become an automatic favorite. If not a down right addiction.  Finding parking can be a bit tricky unless you're used to parking around 5th and Thomas, there's ample parking in the back if you can remember how to get there. The location is small so if you're dining in don't be suprised by the amount of foot traffic picking up take out, especially with the proximity to the hospital next door.  Their tortillas are made by hand, fresh, with red corn. Their sauces are delectable but lack too much heat, they're more like a warm blanket made just for your tongue. Their menu changes throughout the day for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.   For their breakfast I've tried their tamales with huevoes and though the tamale was phenomenal, I wasnt a huge fan of the dish as a whole. As for their lunch, their carne asada tacos are delicious, small but perfect for a light lunch. And my favorite of all is their chili verde, especially with their flour tortillas which are even better than their corn in my opinion. The sauce is hearty and the meat falls apart in your mouth. The first time I tried it, it was so good it actually brought a tear to my eye!"}
{"text":"Had the carne asada plate and it was fantastic.  This is the only Mexican place I was impressed at.  The tortillas tasted so fresh and crisp.  Shame they ran out of their famous dessert(hey, it means they sell out quick).  Definitely give this place a shot."}
{"text":"De las mejores comidas mexicanas que hemos comido. La atención muy buena!  Recomendamos el elote y los camarones al mojo de ajo! No duden en venir"}
{"text":"Wow amazing. The service was great and this place became my fav Mexican restaurant in Phoenix."}
{"text":"The food was incredible! They make fresh  blue corn tortillas daily. The beef on my taco was very tender. The grilled shrimp perfectly seasoned and cooked.  I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Great Classy Mexican food in Central Phoenix.  Their Chilaquiles is among the best in the state.  There is nothing fancy here, just good classic Mexican food done very well.  This is our favorite brunch spot in Midtown!"}
{"text":"WOW!!! SO glad we checked this place out!!! It's tiny, but delicious. Very nice atmosphere and VERY clean!!! Staff is SUPER friendly and attentive!!! Food was AMAZING!!!!   For starters, Mexican Street Corn was seasoned perfectly! So much flavor and the right amount of heat! Chips and salsa were SO fresh and warm, both green & red salsa are served! We ordered a variety of tacos that were absolutely delicious! The tortillas are fresh and homemade l, I can't even describe ten! They are not your normal run of the mill yellow corn or white flour tortillas, the grains are so fresh and there is a variety of seasonings and spices that are added, I've never had anything like it!"}
{"text":"Had a delicious happy hour/early dinner at Presidio. Service was top notch (shouts to Big Jose) and food was absolutely fresh and delicious. Ordered street corn (my fave), ceviche, a taco plate combo with rice and beans. Margarita was great as well. Family-style Mexican restaurant"}
{"text":"Hands down the best service I've had in who knows how long. Hands down the best food I've eaten in who knows how long. The best horchata. The best Chilada. The best tortillas. Can I move in? Everything tasted fresh, delicious, and thoughtfully executed. I am more than satisfied and am so upset I am just now eating here. What a gem!!!!!! Chile relleno was amazing, the cochinita pibil was to die for, and the taquitos are not just any ol' taquito. YUM. 10 stars if I could!!!!"}
{"text":"3/24/17: This is now my favorite Mexican Restaurant in Phoenix. Our server (Jose) was amazing. Their house margaritas as delicious. We ordered Chile Verde,  shrimp in butter garlic (sorry forgot the name) and the another pork dish (sorry forgot that name too). All of our dishes were simply outstanding!!!!  Since we can see the chef from our table, we all have him a huge thumbs up!   4/11/17: came back with a friend visiting from New York.  Needless to say she was thrilled with my restaurant selection.  Jose was our sever, again, and I was pleasantly surprised that he remembered me. I think our chef remembered me too. I felt like I was coming home to family.  The food was just as amazing as it was a few weeks ago.  I had the Pork Verde and my friend had the shrimp, butter, garlic dish. Hands down, too die for!!! We also tried the Mexican street corn, yum!!! Jose made our margaritas just as tasty as my last visit.   This gem is tucked in a small strip of stores. Do NOT let the location or size fool you. This is truly am amazing, authentic Mexican restaurant. I cannot wait to bring more friends to this awesome find!!!!"}
{"text":"First everyone is amazingly nice and helpful! My sister had the breakfast burrito and I had the huevos rancheros delicious! We started with the queso and that was AMAZING! We will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"As a Mexican and just a regular ass human, I have to say this place was so good. The tacos were perfectly spicy. Love that they have decent wine! And the desert was so good! Had a cookie thing with Carmel and nuts (can't remember what it's called) and it was very good too! Keep doing your thang guys. My homegirl said: the only thing that would make this better is if she could smoke inside hahahahaha"}
{"text":"Really high quality and delicious food. It's very unique and lots of flavor. The street corn, guacamole, and tacos are great.  The staff was super nice and gave us some horchata to try. It was so good!"}
{"text":"Cute little spot. Not your typical Mexican restaurant... food was delicious and presentation was even better. The flan was a delicious addition to complete the meal."}
{"text":"I've been waiting for them to open, and today was the day!  I thought it was going to be a little taqueria, but it is a little more upscale.  I went simple with a bean & cheese burrito.  If you can't get the beans right...I'm out. The best around, and the salsa verde was outta this world.  So excited to try more items.  Update....returned on a Saturday, labor day weekend. They now have alcohol. This place is still the best selection of Mexican favorites, and the family that runs it...the best!!!!"}
{"text":"Very spicy, and I love spicy. Tried the Chile Verde Pork, rice and beans with corn and flour tortillas, both housemade. Dinner was wonderful, Thank you, now all I need is a Mexican beach."}
{"text":"Kind of a small, hole in the wall Mexican place in Midtown Phoenix, but definitely one that you won't want to miss. The guacamole was excellent, the tacos were good (although a little heavy on the cilantro), and maybe the best rice and beans I've had in a while. Service was a little slower, but seemed like they were understaffed; the wait staff was very nice though."}
{"text":"First meal since we got into AZ and what a great start. Thinking of moving here in a couple of months and have Presidio locked into as our go-to for Chilaquiles already. Staff is super nice, so cordial and friendly--great customer service. Only complaint is for the pancakes which were a little overcooked (that's where one star was loss--we're hoping it was just a fluke because it was such a nice place with nice people) definitely a place we'd recommend on the chilaquiles and staff alone."}
{"text":"I love tacos and guac, and Presidio sent me out with a smile!  They were both some of the best I've had! I had a few varieties of the tacos, but the shrimp (camarones) were the best in my opinion. The house margarita was tasty and fairly strong, I had one strawberry and one lime, but both blended. I dig the cozy vibe and accommodating staff! Must check this place out if you are in the area.  Chips were also warm with the perfect amount of salt."}
{"text":"Authentic Southern Mexican cuisine. Great little spot. Happy hour prices a really great too. I'll definitely be back someday."}
{"text":"I am SO ANGRY ANGRY ANGRYYYY right now!!!  Why? Because this is THE best food I have EVER had in a restaurant .... And I live in LA! Whyyy can't this gem be down my street???  People of Phoenix... what are you doing? Come to Presidio NOW!"}
{"text":"I eat a lot of Mexican food but I haven't felt the kind of elation I'm currently feeling after a meal in a long time. We were brought two margaritas based off of a vague order and were so happy with both of them. The guacamole and the salsas were fantastic. My boyfriend and I both ordered seafood and I'm feeling pleasantly plump and satisfied in a way that is unusually foreign. The vibe was wonderfully mellow for a Friday night. Joy. Total joy."}
{"text":"The food is amazing!! The green enchiladas are my favorite! The chilaquiles were bomb dot com!"}
{"text":"I am not dissing this restaurant, it is an actually amazing restaurant. The only downside here is the poor customer service, they need to smile more and increase the number of the waitresses. One waitress is not enough to serve four tables at the same time. I will be there again and I will be bringing family, it is a quiet and neat atmosphere with reasonable pricing as well, I hope that does not change in the future."}
{"text":"Excellent carne asada platter. Street corn was very tasty, and the cochinita and al pastor tacos were all good. Nice atmosphere. Offers breakfast and brunch options as well which looked great."}
{"text":"This place deserves a solid 5 star review. For all of you that have given this place a shit review because of price, there are a million cheap Mexican food places that you can go to that are lower quality and price. We managed to hit this place on a Sunday for brunch where we had a nice seat and a fantastic server to take care of us. I asked for a margarita, instead of receiving the House margarita I was asked if I liked a smoky or spicy margarita. Sir, a spicy margarita sounds phenomenal, thanks for asking. A sip or so later and my fiancée was raving about her horchata, which she was beyond pleased with. Our next conundrum came when he had to decide what we were going to eat. I was torn between the chilaquiles and the huevos rancheros, and was very fortunately advised by our server that the huevos rancheros were the most popular order and were closely followed by the chilaquiles. My fiancée never looked back and ordered the green Chile tamale with scrambled eggs; which she was thrilled with. I was greeted with a delicious San Tan IPA and my smorgasbord of amazing Mexican brunch food. Super flavorful, not greasy, and very well portioned is the summary of my order. The beans, well those are to die for, and I don't want refried beans from anywhere else."}
{"text":"Presidio Cocina Mexicana is a little Mexican food joint across the street from St. Joseph's Hospital. I'd classify their food as somewhere between upscale Mexican and your more traditional mainstream Mexican chains that flood the city.  We've dined here a handful of times and I can confidently say that their tacos are very good. I've tried the asada, pastor, chorizo, and cochinita pibil. Served on corn tortillas, all have very good flavor and quality. Their guacamole, unfortunately, is hit and miss. The first time we tried it, my girlfriend and I were impressed. The second time, it was so overkill on the lime that the whole thing tasted like some kind of ultra-sour paste. For ten dollars, you damn-well better have some consistency.   Rice and beans are kind of what you'd expect and are fairly standard. During one visit, I took a risk and upgraded to their street corn and was quite pleased with the results.  My girlfriend typically orders their enchiladas plate with rice and beans. Be warned that their red sauce is much spicier than their green, which is typically a reversal of what we're used to. Despite being Mexican, she is convinced that any type of spice is the equivalent of adding cyanide to the food. I don't quite agree with her beliefs, but the server was nice enough to accommodate her request once she realized that she made a tragic error with her ordering.  What about desserts, you ask? When we originally came here, they only had bunuelos, which always seems more like a snack than a dessert. For our second visit, we tried their alfajor, which is more of a Spanish-type cookie (or cookies in this case) sandwiched between some dulce de leche and walnuts. It's a hard cookie, which makes eating with a spoon as awkward as those \"high society\" types who eat their Snickers with a fork.   Overall, I do like their food and feel it's a nice little Mexican joint that's good for an occasional visit. But my level of enthusiasm isn't quite on par with what most people are saying."}
{"text":"Quaint little restaurant.  We started off with chips and salsa.  The chips were fresh out of the fryer and delicious.  The two salsas that came had good flavor.  We tried four tacos:  Chorizo, carne asada, cochinita pibil and al pastor.  All were really delicious but the al pastor was by far the best. We also had the street corn and rice and beans which were all amazing.  Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Came here inspired by their reviews last week. It was nice to be able to see them prepare our dishes in the open kitchen. The service was attentive and everything was spotless. Try the nacho plate appetizer and the chorizo queso."}
{"text":"I was very impressed with this place! It's super cute inside, if you sit at the bar you can watch your food get cooked. The salsa was delicious - probably the best I've had in a while, It was spicy though! The chorizo burrito was very good as well. I will defiantly be back!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I went to Presidio Cocina based on a positive New Times review. The food was perfect, truly authentic Mexican food. Jose R was our server and very attentive. My girlfriend commented this was her best Mexican meal in a year, a 10. I agree. Excellent."}
{"text":"Came by accident but will return by choice. Delicious food, great presentation and authentic tasting. Would recommend the street corn. Yummy."}
{"text":"It's a small but cozy Mexican restaurant. The hostess has a warm smile. When I asked for menu items that have seafood or veggies, she was gracious enough to also show me the dinner options in case I was interested in that. I ordered tacos - veggies, fish and shrimp, in the decreasing order of taste. The tortillas were handmade and were delicious. The tacos and especially the veggie tacos was the best taco I have ever eaten. I also took a side order of black beans. My partner had quesadilla with pork stew which was also Delicious. In short, don't miss this place if u are ever in downtown Phoenix."}
{"text":"My hubby and I stopped here for dinner on the way home from the airport.  So glad we did! The tacos are amazing!  My hubby enjoyed his carne Asada with Chorizo as well. We will definitely be back for more... a new favorite taco place! :)"}
{"text":"Outstanding! Legit and delicious Mexican food. We had the street corn, al pastor tacos, and totopos. Everything was wonderful. This is my new favorite Mexican place. I can't wait to bring family and friends here."}
{"text":"What can I say?  This place is transcendent.  I have spent a lot of time in Mexico and grew up in Colorado so know good Mexican food.  I have been chasing a good authentic Chilaquiles since being in Mexico almost ten years ago and have always been disappointed.  This was it!!! Absolutely spot on and amazing!   Everything we ordered: food and drinks (both alcoholic and non) were fantastic!  The location is unassuming and easy to pass by but need to stop here!  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My party of 10 visited this very quaint and comfortable restaurant for my husbands birthday. We arrived for brunch a few at a time and were immediately seated. We were the first to arrive and ordered the queso fundido and chips and salsa. The tortillas that accompanied the fundido were hot, fresh and homemade. DELISH!!!! By the time everyone arrived I was stuffed. My entree was the red tamale with eggs and beans and oh so good! Everyone had something great to say about their food and the staff were so very kind. What a nice little restaurant with great food!"}
{"text":"I love this place.  Me and my boyfriend tried this place out near our house.  I cannot believe we had not discovered this place before, it was amazing.  The place is small, very friendly service, clean and the food, where do start.  I ordered the presidio tacos; two open face breakfast tacos topped with eggs, cojitia, papas, chorizo and a nice mild salsa.  I recommend ordering them with the flour tortilla to soak up the salsa and eggs.  If you want a really flavorful, SPICY salsa ask for the red that comes on the huevos rancheros.  My boyfriend ordered the huevos rancheros and loved the salsa so much he requested more for the rest of his meal.  The Mexican corn reminds me of the visiting Mexico and requesting the Mexican corn on the cob.   My only suggestion is to move to a better location and space to expand your customer pool like Switch/Fez type of restaurant as Presidio has a touch of modern decor, not the whole in the wall it appears to be from the outside.  This place will be on my list of places to eat often.  Thank you for the welcoming service :)"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!  There are very few times where I finish my meal. Today was one of those times. I had the carne asada, the shrimp, and a chicken taco with some chips and guac. Delicioso! I wish I'd taken a photo of it before it was devoured.  My friend ordered red enchiladas with chicken. She was so impressed, she compared it to her mother's cooking. Gasp. (If my friend approves, then everyone should go try it!) Long story short: Employees are wonderful. Prices are great. Food is legit."}
{"text":"This place is small but delicious! Check them out when you can! DELICIOUSNESS!!! I love the chicken fajitas and I absolutely love the chicken enchiladas with green sauce. The staff is very nice and the restaurant is spotless. This is my new favorite little place!"}
{"text":"Excellent food. Was truly impressed with very authentic Mexican cooking. Yes the real stuff with no freakin yellow cheese!!! Flan and buñuelos are awesome!!  For sure to be back again!!!"}
{"text":"Great Mexican Food! Don't be fooled by the size or location.  They are very unique.  Have a great time the waiter and Team seem friendly"}
{"text":"Very authentic, unfortunately for me too spicy (but I'm a light weight due to younger cancer radiation), but what I could get down was great. All my dining mates enjoyed / couldn't stop talking about the place.  The dishwasher has a easy job at this place, all the plates went back cleaned to the China.  I'll be back, just more cautious about the spicy choices."}
{"text":"-The place : is nice and chill and clean -Service : the guys help us Need to know how to take the order, be more helpful to the customer.  -Food: disappointing in Yelp looks really good food , tasty and inexpensive , I found the food no tasty  and expensive. In the burritos we never find the meat , we ask Guacamole but I never find it. salsa and chips are good. Tacos are ok but for a 5 dlls taco we can find better. Overall I didn't like it I had better expectations :( . Maybe the other food is better.   I agree with Yvonne G"}
{"text":"Best Mexican restaurant in Phoenix. Clean, fresh and true to itself. Was really impressed with the quality and care they put into every dish. Here are all the things it's not; Not overly fancy, not expensive, not a fusion, not cutting corners. They get the essentials right, great chili sauce, great beans, great rice and the rest follows. I only hope it's not too hard to get into once everyone starts to hear about this place."}
{"text":"Best mexican food in town! A MUST visit when in AZ. amazing food, amazing service, and great atmosphere.   You have to try thier pancakes, steak enchilada, and chirizo & potatoes. AMAZINNG."}
{"text":"Great food! Fast service! The vegetarian tacos were awesome! The chile rellenos were also very good!"}
{"text":"The friendliest staff we met on our trip to Phoenix with great, fast service and amazing food. The grilled pineapple on the al pastor tacos is to die for. Ask for the green salsa!"}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best Mexican food places.  Not cheap but worth the $$$. Margaritas are fresh squeezed and no sweet and sour.  Tortillas are all handmade.  Everything I've eaten is amazing. Carne asada is super tender.  Tastes homemade and the quality is unreal."}
{"text":"Delicious, homemade Mexican food in a casual cafe setting. The green chili pork was tender and the sauce had just the right amount of heat. The horchata and Jamaica drinks are made fresh daily. My Jamaica was perfect (not overly tart or sweet). Friendly service too. Can't wait to try their breakfast and lunch menu."}
{"text":"I bought a taco and was disappointed to find it was a street taco. Taking a bite, it was one of the most delicious things I've ever eaten. The food is very authentic and is the best I've had this side of Tucson (maybe including Tucson!). Service was great and I was made to feel at home. I can't wait to go back!   Presidio is located right across the street from St. Joseph's Hospital and is next door to a medical supply store."}
{"text":"Great service, serves coke products! Free refills.  The food is spot on. I had a salad with a chicken breast 1/2 grilled.  Grilled veggies. Big portion. About 12 dollars.  My son had tacos, he said they were great."}
{"text":"This family owned restaurant has an absolutely beautiful and relaxed atmosphere.  The tacos were absolutely OUTSTANDING!  I got the taco al pastor (bottom) and it was absolutely amazing.  The pineapple added a great tang to the perfectly seasoned pork and the tomatillo sauce was incredible.  The chicken taco was nothing like your typical \"boring\" chicken taco, perfect balance of spice and fresh flavors.  The carnitas might have been my favorite, i have never had carnitas so rich with flavor!  And the made-to-order tacos really tie everything together.  I cannot wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Nice space!  Clean, warm, friendly staff...food was pretty good, street corn a bit overcooked.  Overall a very nice date night with hubby."}
{"text":"I had a little time between arriving in Phoenix and checking into the hotel, so I saw this place had good reviews. It's not quite the dive I'm used to, but it was close to the hotel. I ordered enchiladas, it was not bad. Had nice heat, which is something I look for in salsa verde. The beans and rice were flavorful too. Overall, I thought this place was good, but I didn't think there was anything out of the ordinary about it. I had a good lunch."}
{"text":"Very pleasantly surprised with this little local gem, we stopped in and caught the end of brunch, start of lunch. Jose waited on us and was just awesome the whole time. We tried an al pastor and shrimp taco, both very good. We also split the huevos ranchero, they come with chorizo and eggs with some beans. We enjoyed it but would probably try the chiliquilles next time. They have a wonderful menu for brunch and lunch and I can't wait to explore it. They offer lots of tasty cocktails and margaritas. If you haven't been in I would highly recommend you give it a shot."}
{"text":"Holy crap! This place is amazing! I had the quesadilla con chicharrón and it was to die for! My friend had the chilaquiles with carnitas and she loved it. Service is great and super fast. Our food was out in no time. We are visiting from San Diego, CA and this place definitely did not disappoint. I would definitely recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"Updating previous review...and it's still the most amazing place.  Stopped in on our way back home from Phoenix.  Close that browser and go now!  We've tried so many different things on the menu during our brief stay in AZ, and it's all stellar.  Might be the best Mexican food ever.  Prepared with craft, care and skill.  Delicious!!"}
{"text":"these guys know what they're doing. this isnt some sonoran joint where being a hole-in-the-wall is part of the charm. they pay attention to detail. the service is great, the menu reads authentic, and the preparation and techniques are solid. would eat here way more if i lived closer. my favorite mexican restaurant in town."}
{"text":"Rounding up from a 3.5 here. We weren't super hungry so only tried a few things. The steak taco was really good, much better than the chicken. We started with the chips and salsas and a seafood ceviche, which was way too tart. The waiter asked us (very nicely) to move tables twice because of a large party coming in. Not a big deal, but he was nice enough to pack us a free horchata to go when I had inquired what the neighboring table was drinking. I wish we had been able to try some of the other stuff on the menu. Maybe next time."}
{"text":"We stopped in for lunch this weekend & again didn't disappoint us at all! Amazing food as I had the tamale with rice/beans we simply love this place!"}
{"text":"Very good food! We've been coming here and it has never disappointed us. I especially like the menu items with chicharron!"}
{"text":"I am going to be stuck in the hospital for a week and am SO happy I found this GREAT restaurant right across the street! Hubby will be able to enjoy delicious, quality food and decompress with a fresh margarita whilst I look out the window in envy! Staff is wonderful, food is fresh and really good! A gem I tell you, just a gem!!"}
{"text":"I ordered a Horchata (super good. Not too sweet) and Huevos Rancheros (which I have never had before but the side potatoes looked super yummy so I had too)  The staff is super friendly, the manager (I'm assuming) greeted me as soon as I entered and asked me if I would like a glass of water and pulled out a chair for me to sit( Chivalry is not dead.) It's in a great location, the restaurant it's self is really peaceful and relaxing and they play nice mellow music. The only thing I would say is they are a bit pricey because my meal came out to $17 for just horchata and huevos rancheros."}
{"text":"This was my second visit to Presidio and of course I loved the food! Started off with the Elote, which is served how we traditionally eat in when my family gets together. I chose to try the enchiladas, with both red and green sauce. I must say usually (at other places) one sauce is better than the other, but not in this case. The flavor was not overpowered by cheeses or creams and the rice was cooked to perfection. There are varying styles of Mexican cooking here in AZ, and this place has won me over!"}
{"text":"This was a fantastic find, when in the neighborhood looking for a better known taco joint with an.. Eh hem.. 2hr wait. So do yourself a favor. Bypass the pretentious spot, and get your tostadas over here! Fantastic food, excellent attention to flavor and originality, truly worth the price margaritas, and I don't know if it was a family back in the kitchen or not, but the entire staff actually seemed to care about our experience. On top of it, this place had just been slammed with a party of 25 (which is a feat in itself if you know the size of this olace) and the staff made it feel like we were the only ones in the joint.  Go. Run, do not walk. And tell them the kansas citian sent you."}
{"text":"This family run business uses their own original recipes to create everything from scratch.  The red salsa is simply amazing.  Nothing comes from a can.  Their chips arrive fresh and warm, unsalted so that you can taste the true flavor of the salsas (healthier too).  I ordered a carne asada burrito and had it filled with rice, beans and guacamole.  It arrived with a small side salad that had a delicious and light cilantro dressing.  The burrito was probably the best I've ever had.  I'll definitely be back to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Ok, after my 4th visit I have determined this is in my top 3 Mexicana restaurantes. Service is top notch and food is exceptional quality."}
{"text":"Wow. I don't what to say about this place. It would be hard to judge the service at a family members house, right? Well that's exactly how I felt there. My server, which unfortunately I didn't get his name, was beyond fantastic. I was with my son, and he was being finicky as kids do, and this guy talked was able to talk him into a good breakfast. I truly feel he didn't do it for an up sell or anything like that, he was just caring. My son had pancakes that were spiced, and didn't need any syrup and eggs, and we shared a chili relleno. The chili relleno actually had an egg batter on it, not some tempura coat. It was full of flavor and the sauce had enough kick to make your tongue tingle and dive for more. I was sent here with high recommendations so I tried The Three Little Piggies taco plate of their pork options. The conchilita pibil was fantastic, with pickled onions on a homemade tortilla. The chorizo cooked and crisped the way chorizo should be, full of flavor but not burning your tongue. And al pastor was didn't need a thing, no lime, no salsa. Nothing. I also had the flautas, and they were mounted with a fresh, crisp pile of shredded lettuce, cotija, crema, and tomatoes. The flautas had plenty of flavor to complement the coolness of the salad. I will be frequenting this place a lot for taco Tuesday. You should, too."}
{"text":"Mmmm, I'm still thinking about their shrimp tacos. I don't know when I'm not craving tacos so we came in for a late lunch/early dinner on a Saturday. We started off with the guac and it was delicious. I loved all the cheese on it, it added a good twist to it. I maybe could have done with a little less onions, but that's just my taste. The chips were freshly fried too. I got the shrimp, fish, and carne asada taco. The shrimp was by far my favorite. The fish taco was good too. The carne asada was a little spicy for me, but I'm a whimp. The portions are very generous. I have a feeling I'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"This is absolutely devine. We got a late start and had the Huevos Rancheros which are Devine. It comes with beans and homestyle potatoes that have chorizo embedded. Gosh we were full for the whole day. The coffee is gourmet nice and strong and hot. I think it stayed hot the whole time we were there.  First they start you off wth a guacamole on the house. I've lied in Texas and Cali and this is the best traditional (not Tex-Méx) Huevos Rancheros ever! Definitely give  Presidío  a try you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Family run restaurant plus made from scratch Mexican food, my kind of place.  I tried the lunch burritos and they were very tasty and I could tell the ingredients were really fresh.  We got to talk to the owner/chef and she assured us no cans are opened here :) They make their own orchata and agua de Jamaica. So happy for another local gem downtown Phoenix."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch and had the chili rellieno plate.  The sauce is hot and had a nice sweetness.  It was fantastic. New business, nice people."}
{"text":"This is one of my new favorite Mexican restaurants, and I wish there was a spot out here like it. Or if there is, I need to find it!  My family arrived with 1 hour to spare, as most places outside of Vegas close earlier than we're used to. But we were seated right away, drink and food orders taken quick as well. No rush though. I ordered Jamaica, which is always delicious to me. They offer cocktails, but I was not in the mood for one. Initially I was going to order shrimp tacos and an elote, but my mom ordered camarones de mojo I believe, and ordered the same. I love garlic!   I must say this is some of the best shrimps I have had. No shortage of garlic or shrimps. Perfectly marinated in the sauce. And they bring you a plate of warm, slightly toasted bread, which my niece could not put down. Of the whole plate, I ate 2. She ate the rest then moved to the next plate. The rice was cooked just right. Not mushy or dry and went with the beans. I'm not usually a fan of re-fried beans, but these were delicious. Dessert was flan which had a really nice consistency. If there is a place like this in town, I'm down.   Customer service was on point as well. No pen or paper, the guy memorized everything and what other people were requesting."}
{"text":"Just really good. A gem in what is otherwise the food desert of Phoenix. Prices might be higher, but everything here is made with so much care, from the guac, to the Mexican street corn, to the insanely flavorful tacos (those corn tortillas!), to the delicious fajitas. We were so full we couldn't do dessert, but the bunuelos were calling to me. Do not be put off by the location - it's totally worth it."}
{"text":"Was at Saint Joseph Hospital. And decided to walk across the street and try Presidio.Food was very authentic."}
{"text":"I stopped by Presidio on my way home from work for a single enchilada to go.  Man, do I wish I ordered two or more.  The flavor was out of this world delicious.  I'm so looking forward to exploring more of the menu.  See you guys again soon!"}
{"text":"The best Mexican food ever. First off, the chips are freshly made and come out HOT. Guacamole is AMAZING. Chips are the best I've ever had. I ordered the shrimp tacos and they were unreal. Never had shrimp tacos this good. Ex husband got the carne Asada. It was veryyy good. Rice and beans are delicious. I could not stop eating. The place was very clean, and not too busy on a Monday afternoon. I will definitely be coming back here for sure."}
{"text":"Me and my brother were fortunate enough to eat at this restaurant. Originally my brother was very skeptical in regards to eating at previous Mexican restaurants we have been to in Phoenix such as Joyride, Barrio Cafe, and many others that did not live up to their advertisement of serving authentic Mexican cuisine. Thankfully I convinced him to give Presidio a chance.   After we were warmly welcome in by their amazing staff, we sat down and both ordered. I ordered the Chicken Flautas and my brother ordered their Asada and Shrimp Burrito. After just one bite it was clear that this would become our place to go for authentic family made Mexican food. The flavors that burst into my mouth can't be understood until you go and try it yourself. Finally when I glanced up at my brother to tell him how incredible my food tasted I found him preoccupied. He was already in his own realm of bliss from tasting \"the best burrito I've ever had.\"   We ended up talking to the head chef Luci, who's son I believe owns the restaurant. She can be seen standing behind the counter making the most incredible, soulful plates that are filled with the kind of love that reminds me of my grandmothers home cooking. After we were done talking she recommended the flan for dessert. Hands down, the best flan I've ever had. Par none.   We left feeling happy and full in a way that can only be explained by their made fresh, twice daily, wholesome food. All I can say is that the first bite tasted as incredible and flavorful as the last. Do yourself a favor and give this place a chance. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Update to my original review. Came back for lunch and had the Chile Relleno, DELICIOUS. People please come and keep this place open lol."}
{"text":"Family owned and operated authentic Mexican Food. It's a breath of fresh air! I had the Chilaquiles and so did my Girlfriend. My buddy had the Breakfast Burrito. Everyone nearly licked the plate.  I would also recommend the Latte.   All ingredients fresh, all meals made from scratch. Check this place out and support this friendly family. Exceptional food and service."}
{"text":"Great Mexican food in a little dive-ish looking spot.  The waiter was not only very helpful with dining recommendations, but also had a cool sense of humor.  Everything was excellent.  We would definitely go back."}
{"text":"My husband asked me 2 questions. 1) How long have I known about this place? 2) Why has it taken me so long to tell him about it? I've driven by many times but always forget because of the location.   Anyway, we finally tried it out last week. He got the carne asada platter which to his pleasant surprise also came with chorizo.....at least he thinks it was chorizo. I ordered the veggie tacos with a side of street corn. The veggies have a ton of flavor with a spicy kick. The corn was equally delicious. The only reason I did not give 5 stars is because the tacos only came with 1 one tortilla. As soon as I picked up the taco to bite into it things started falling apart. That won't discourage me from returning, but it was a little disappointing (just a little). We would go tonight but they are closed on Mondays. Also, THANK YOU for having gluten free taco shells. Much appreciated:)"}
{"text":"The chilaquiles were a slam dunk. Light, crisp chips with a generous spread of spicy green chile, cotija cheese, and crema, and two over-easy eggs with runny yolk. They made for an incredible breakfast with a nice, hot cup of black coffee. The GF had the quesadilla which had an interesting red-chile tortilla. It felt more like a large taco than a quesadilla, so don't be disappointed if you're expecting a gooey, cheesy mess. The quesadilla was delicious, but there was too little pork (which is a shame, because it was tasty!).   Love the family feel to the establishment and service was on point. Welcome to the neighborhood, Presidio!"}
{"text":"I went to visit a friend who lives in Phoenix and while they were at work I was left to fend for myself and find something to eat. I was craving some legit authentic Mexican food, not that Tex-Mex stuff that they have at a lot of these \"Mexican\" restaurants. I mean seriously Arizona, what's the deal with \"cheese crisps\"?!?!? What part of Mexico is that even from?!?!? I'm from LA and I know good real Mexican food.   So enter Presidio!!! Not going to lie, part of the reason I wanted Mexican food was because I was hungover from hanging out with my friend and I needed a michelada to help me through the day. Let's just say the michelada here were so refreshing that I had two!!! It saved my life!!! I also had the horchata which was a nice blend of sweet and spice. Not spicy, but cinnamon and sugar blend... I can't describe it. As for the food. I ended up having the shrimp tacos which was sooooooooo delicious and bomb!!! Probably my favorite dish!!! It was soooo flavorful and amazing I probably could have had a couple more!!! The next dish was the flutas. Seriously when that came out I already knew I couldn't finish it because there was so much food on it. I really didn't know where to begin and how to it eat. It was visually overwhelming I suppose. Started with the rice which was perfect!!! I really love a good Spanish rice and this one was on point. The beans had cotija cheese which really surprised me because some places just use Monterrey Jack cheese which is alright.  But the Cotija took it to another level. The flutas itself were great, it had a nice crispness and the sauces were paired very well just enhancing all the flavors. Again they had queso fresco to top off the flautas which again is real Mexican cheese. I have to admit I bought some queso fresco before and that stuff is not cheap. So I really appreciate a restaurant that doesn't cut corners and knows real Mexican food.   Next time I visit my friend, this place will be a place I have to come back to. I probably will stop by here again before I drive back to LA!!!"}
{"text":"I love Chilaquiles, and I'm very picky with my breakfast food! That said, this place is delicious!! I had the green chilaquiles and my boyfriend had the chorizo burrito. We both loved our food and were happy with the service. I would recommend this this place."}
{"text":"GREAT MEXICAN FOOD! What a great place. The food was fresh and amazing! I have been 4 times now and every meal has been great. I have not tried the DRINKS yet but that will be tonight's visit.  The people are so nice. My favorite place."}
{"text":"Came here last night with my sister and a friend, had it on my radar, but finally came in. Awesome! Authentic family owned feel, waiter was friendly and had recommendations. They serve wine, margaritas, and beer. Started with appetizers, had the guac which was amazing, fire roasted chiles throughout. The chorizo (made in house) fundido had gooey sticky cheese with great flavor, both apps enough to share with the table. Decided to have tacos, though will be back for their entrees, had homemade from scratch tortillas, tacos were good sized and loaded up. Al pastor and the chicharrones were my fave, sucker for the pork belly, and the pastor had bits of caramelized pineapple! The Pibil was also very good, slow roasted, braised, bit of smokiness. Also had the paloma margarita, quite excellent, on the small side, but quality was on point and they have some very good tequilla selections to boot. We stuck around for dessert, ordered three different ones, the flan was excellent, firm and rich, but the table loved the gelato, amaze balls!!! Very impressed by this place and am looking forward to my next visit to try more of their dishes."}
{"text":"The food here is absolutely amazing. Definitely will be back!! Service was great too! Had 3 tacos and wanted to order 3 more!'"}
{"text":"Terrible service!! Inattentive. Slow. I waited for five minutes for a menu and the waiter walked by with menus from another table. I gave up on waiting for the bill and walked up to the cash register. Not a good option for a workday lunch."}
{"text":"I fully believe Presidio to be overrated, fast-casual restaurant, but it's got some good items so it's cool.   The good: Shrimp tacos were flavorful. Having the tiniest shrimp ever didn't stop them from grilling them with plenty of spice. The aioli was bursting with flavor as well, even if it was on the verge of stealing the show. And at $4 a pop, ordering several of these is probably the most expensive thing you can do here, meaning this is quite the affordable option. The horchata is only lightly sweet and tastes like rice (as opposed to milk), which is how it should be!  The bad: There were two salsas. Like WTF? Only two? That's a major violation in this town. A so-so green salsa that was playing it safe and didn't add much. And the salsa de arbol was the most bland of its kind I have ever seen. I have literally, in the dozens of Mexican restaurants I've reviewed here, NEVER had salsa de arbol that was not even remotely spicy. I didn't think it was physically possible, but Presidio managed. What a disappointment. Additionally, everything is a la carte, with apparently no options to make anything a combination (i.e. add chips and salsa or beans and rice) which is kinda lame, but I'll survive. The soft, intimate atmosphere will fool you into believing it's a real sit-down place, but they're really just taking your order at the front and handing you your stuff like 5-10 minutes later. It's a notch above fast food so don't get your hopes up too high.   The ugly: Worst al pastor I can readily recall. Was this really marinated, or did y'all just coat it with a dusting of chili powder as it came off the grill? Also, I am sure that canned pineapple would compliment this well in a taco, but is definitely not good in the (seemingly) canned beans that comprised about 75% of this burro. I was desperately dousing it in salsa, and it didn't help. Kinda like the opposite of what happens when you reach for water after a REAL salsa de arbol.   I am so down to come back for the tacos, and I trust they'll be made well. Additionally, I like your staff, and am happy everything moves along swiftly. I'd come here again."}
{"text":"Let me say I'm a foodie and I do not do reviews. But I had to make time for this place. We got of the plane and I was after some authentic Mexican food. I had already found this place on Yelp before we left. The food and service was phenomenal! The day shift waiter/bartender/cashier named Louis is very personable and is all about making sure you enjoy everything. The owner Lucy is a sweetheart who takes a lot of pride in her food. I will make this a must on our future trips to Phoenix. Thank you Louis and Lucy for starting our anniversary trip off on the right foot!"}
{"text":"My husband and I were in the area and stopped for breakfast. Best huevos rancheros I've ever had! The pricing was amazing too. The place is cute, clean, and fast. I'm craving the food now and if I didn't live so far I'd be here daily!"}
{"text":"Loved their chilaquiles especially with the cream and cheese that they use. Green sauce has the right amount of taste and spice to it. Horchata was very creamy and tasted pretty good. Very welcoming and soothing environment whether it be breakfast, lunch, or dinner."}
{"text":"It's a very small cute place. The food was delicious. I had three tacos. The Carne, Carnitas and Shrimp. They were all very good.  The service was also very very good. Food was served fast and the waitress kept coming back to make sure I was ok."}
{"text":"My family and I were in Phoenix last week and found this place on yelp, absolutely delicious authentic Mexican food and the service was outstanding. Everyone made us feel very welcome! Next time we're in Phoenix we're coming back!"}
{"text":"Very good place if your not into spice, green sauce is not for you lots of flavor but some kick."}
{"text":"Was waiting for an appointment downtown and stumbled upon this gem. Great customer service and the owner was super friendly. The Verde salsa was AMAZING. Highly recommend the carnita tacos and the burrito. Great food, fast service."}
{"text":"Good food, but the downside was no complimentary chips and salsa.  Friendly staff. I need to go back and try some items on their breakfast menu."}
{"text":"My family and I made a stop in to celebrate my little brothers birthday. One of my younger brothers was very adamant about coming here because he loves this place. After I looked at the reviews on Yelp I was very excited to come and see what all the hype was about. When we arrived the place was empty and we were greeted by a very nice gentleman who seated us right away. The place is very small a quiet but nice and clean.   After looking through the menu I decided to order the 3 little piggie tacos. The plate had 3 tacos one of Chorizo, El Pastor, and Conchinita with a side of black beans. My fiance order the fish tacos and my siblings ordered the Chili Verde, Ceviche, and Enchiladas.  As all of our food came out I was delighted with the presentation because every plate looked delicious. My tacos were very flavorful and the chorizo was spot on! I got a chance to try the Chili Verde, Enchiladas, and Ceviche and it was all delicious. I know the next time I come back I will be ordering the Chili Verde. This is definitely one of those places you have to visit if you're in the mood for Mexican."}
{"text":"Don't let the strip mall location keep you away from the amazing food served at the Presidio.  We love the Mom and Pop atmosphere and the staff members were very helpful and attentive.  The shrimp in garlic and wine sauce was delicious! We will certainly be back!"}
{"text":"I love Arizona for its good food and I'm so happy I found this place! All of the staff was great and the food was amazing. Highly recommended the queso. Definitely going back!"}
{"text":"One of the best carne asada tortas I probably have ever had  in my life here! My friend ordered the menudo. Also delicious"}
{"text":"I was excited to visit this place based on the Yelp reviews. We went early on a Sunday morning after church and it was pretty empty which worried me. I ordered the chilaquiles, and my husband got the breakfast burrito. We also decided to split an order of pancakes. My chilaquiles were pretty solid. Eggs cooked well and sauce on the tortilla chips was tasty. My hubby's burrito was fine but nothing special. The pancakes were solid. I decided to give 4 stars instead of 3 because their horchata was some of the best I've ever had!"}
{"text":"I stopped by yesterday to pick some food up, and I was very impressed.   I ordered aguachiles, and they came out in a timely fashion. Delicious and for such a good price!   Aguachiles is my favorite dish, but I'm usually spending around 25 for a plate.   I highly recommend! It is also in a very convenient area located right next to my school."}
{"text":"I'm in Phoenix on business and wanted to try some authentic Mexican food for breakfast and this place was an amazing surprise! Absolutely fantastic breakfast burrito with chorizo. Get a side of verde and pour it over for a wonderful flavor and spicy kick. I have to get back there a couple of times before flying home. Clean kitchen and eating area and super-friendly staff. Just go there!"}
{"text":"Came here after a long flight, was perfect!  Tacos were huge and fresh.    Cilantro lime salad with steak was enormous and one of the best salads I have had.   Everything is fresh and made in house.  Desserts, tortillas, tea, etc.    Clean, well decorated, and attentive staff.    The flan at the end was amazing as well."}
{"text":"Great place to grab lunch or breakfast. Was very impressed with the food."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in this morning and I had green and red chili con carne with 2 eggs and tortillas. My eggs were over cooked hard and dry  My red chili was awful the green was okay. The water is bad. I asked the owner if he had a filter on the soda machine that dispenses the water he said not yet My plate cost me $16. My taco to go was $2.5 My husbands plate $10. One chili relleno $10. The tortillas were hard and dry If the food was good I would have no problem with these prices  The restaurant looks nice and they are nice I wish them good luck I will not return"}
{"text":"Best tacos in town. Hands down. Fresh ingredients, great flavor. Favorite is al pastor. Horchata is the best. Dining room isn't big but has a bar/counter for single eating."}
{"text":"The carne asada plate was perfectly portioned , not to big not to small. The meat was tender and well seasoned topped with bell peppers and jalapeño. But what really set the meal apart was the beans! Creamy and packed with flavor. The Michelada was out of this world I got mine extra spicy but you can get yours mild. Great spot A+!"}
{"text":"Just left this place. Food is OUTSTANDING. I highly recommend the quesadilla Roja. And make sure to get the green salsa and chips. Service was exceptional. I had the opportunity to meet the owner and he is fantastic. Very friendly and accommodating staff. Check this place out and support a local business!"}
{"text":"The food was authentic and tasty.  Waiter was very attentive.    The only issue was noise level- as the table next to us was playing you tube videos.  Very annoying."}
{"text":"A Hidden Gem - Nestled in a small Shopping Plaza on Thomas Road, The Presidio has a great Mexican cuisine menu, a good atmosphere, fantastic service, and more importantly great tasting food. I'm a vegan and so I asked them to create a vegan burrito for me with potatoes, black beans, Pinto beans, lettuce, and guacamole. They listened and they did that with no problem and what delighted me was it really tasted great!  They had seasoned it using a spice that I haven't had before but that really really made it delicious. I'd recommend the Presidio it's a Hidden Vegan Friendly Gem."}
{"text":"Nice little restaurant in town. Looks like a little hole in the wall, but when you get in there the service is really good and the food is pretty delicious. I got the chili Riano with the Mexican corn and you can't go wrong with that really good. If you open up your rep review they'll give you a percentage off your bill. We just sat at the bar overlookin the kitchen pretty cool. The only thing is the margaritas were a little too expensive."}
{"text":"We live so close and easily drive by the restaurant everyday. It's hidden and easy to miss as its in a strip mall off busy Thomas Rd. The chicken fajitas are so fresh and delicious. The onions and peppers are soft which adds nice flavor. The beans taste authentic. We've have had the cheese quesadilla which comes with sour cream and lettuce. However since we have only got to go every time (usually after a 12hr shift) that the lettuce is unappealing as it looks like too soft/brown after sitting on a hot meal. We will for sure need to actually eat in. The restaurant has always been busy when visiting!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is absolutely amazing. It's tucked away, but this place is the perfect little go to spot for mexican food.  It's family owned, so the genuine kindness of the staff is so welcoming.  The food..... Omg the food.....!!!!! I got an iced coffee with a chicken taco. And they were to DIE FOR.!  10/10 would recommend. I will definitely be going there more often!"}
{"text":"Chilaquiles delicious and spicy! Ordered with a side of beans.  Breakfast tacos also tasty!  Loved the bunuelos!!!!   Looking forward to trying their lunch menu."}
{"text":"DONT BELIEVE THE HYPE! UNDERWHELMING & OVERPRICED  When something is doled out in small portions, at very high prices, many people are tricked into thinking \"wow, this must be a delicacy\". Wrong!  Where to begin, perhaps I should begin with the Queso Fundido appetizer, which was almost good, if only the chorizo had some flavor and kick to it, they did use quality meat, so why couldnt they season it properly? Bland chorizo just doesnt whet my appetite. The guacamole appetizer is good, tastes fresh and just made, but the standing chips presentation just screams of 90s-attempt-to-be-fancy.   On to the actual meals, again with the oh-so-90's molded, round, green (St Patricks Day?) scoop of rice (hasnt anyone told them thats how cafeteria rice is served in grade schools), that was so overcooked, it had no body and simply dissolved in your mouth. Now add to that the cold, rationed, pinto beans and a steak thats literally wet and seems almost boiled. Its like the meat was marinating in oil or something. Although the flavor of the meat was good, it had too much fat and I just couldnt shake that wet, slippery mouth-feel.   If this is how they get down in Michoacan, God help them, the people of Michoacan must be starving to death. But I read somewhere that Mexico had surpassed the US by far in obesity rates, with 7 out of 10 being overweight. Perhaps Presidio Cocina should consider relocating back to Michoacan where they could singlehandedly lower those obesity stats with their rice and bean rations.    We also ordered the 3 tacos entree, and while the blue corn tortillas were awesome, the cochinita pibil filling was cold, but the al pastor was good! Now, theres a fine line between charred and burned, I love charred, but the kernels of the corn we upgraded to were flat out burned, you could taste it. And I would have been happier if they had taken the spiciness out of the corn and put it into the chorizo where it belonged, if I want chili on my corn Ill add it thank you. We also had chicken flautas which were the only option, but I really wanted beef. They were flavorful enough, but the skimpy guacamole, sour cream and beans, along with that perfectly round scoop of horribly overcooked leprechaun rice just ruined it.  Onward to the ONE thing Presidio impressed us with and the only entree we ordered that was phenomenal. All of us had agreed to share our food so that we might be able to sample more that way. But by the time we all had our food my friend was hovering over her bowl of posole and offering very few \"tastes\", and after I sampled it I understood why. She had hit the Presidio jackpot, the only reason for Presidios existence in my opinion (no the horchata is not all that), THE POSOLE!!! But as tasty, delectable and perfectly cooked as the posole was, even with its tender chunks of pork roast, its not enough to carry the whole restaurant, I wish it were. $13 for one bowl, really? Come on now, its hominy soup!  I REALLY wanted to like this place, I was so excited to try it out, and it just didnt live up to the hype. Now for the grand finale, after all of this, to add insult to injury, the surly, bearded chef/cook/waiter/cashier guy shuffles over in his dress shoes, sans socks, to bring your check (yes he handles money  then handles your food, ugh). The prices are outrageous considering the quality & portions. I dont mind paying for good food, just ask the people at City Hall, Im a reg (lobster mashed potatoes YUM! I digress). But when you ration unremarkable, inexpensive fare, made from modest peasant foods, dont try to sell it to me as caviar, I know the difference. And while Ive had some Mexican food that was truly a delicacy (think lobster with mole made with chile, hibiscus and plums) this was not. But most people are too naive and easily fooled to see beyond the BS, or perhaps they fear their criticisms will appear less than pc. It may also be as simple as seeming much better than they are simply because we live in a sea of various and sundry \"Los filibertos\" type junk restaurants.   Its also worth mentioning, that the whole time we were there, the staff kept speaking amongst themselves in spanish then laughing, the majority of customers at the time just happened to be non-hispanics, so it felt rude and uncomfortable. Add to that the curse words they were using, (some  non-hispanic customers actually speak fluent spanish) very low class for a place trying to come off as higher end. Also, I kept having this nagging feeling that they were trying to imitate the the food at another Phoenix restaurant called Asi Es La Vida, unsuccessfully I might add. Not that Asi Es la Vida is all that either, but at least they know what their strengths are, and have more than one dish that holds its own, stay tuned for their review, coming soon!  Dont agree with my review? Ive only written 12 reviews prior to this, 10 were negative reviews, and 3 of those places are now closed, its not a coincidence..."}
{"text":"We went to Presidio on a whim last Sunday...Literally picked the first place (without reading reviews) nearest to where we were at the moment.  Boy Howdy, if this wasn't the best choice of the year!!  Seriously folks!  This place should be tried by all.  Something on the menu for everyone. Super authentic!  Our server was a nice enough gentleman.  He made wonderful suggestions.  I did have their home made margarita...it was good, however, I forgot to say that I did not want salt and he had not asked...I would have enjoyed it more without. I had the  Quesadilla Roja con Chicharron Homemade chile corn tortilla, crispy pork belly, salsa tomatillo, chihuahua cheese, queso fresco, red picked onions and cilantro. Whoa Whoa Whoa!!!  This was hands down the most delicious dish, I may have ever had in my life.   Literally something I would have never ordered had it not been for the servers suggestion. The rice (which I am never a fan of) was outstanding...Unbelievable! My fiance had Carne Asada Plate Grilled skirt steak served with guacamole rice, beans and tortillas. and was hugely impressed.. We had so many errands to do on this day, after this meal we threw all the errands out the window, and had an entire true Sunday Funday!  Unplanned and perfect day...Thank you Presidio, we will be regulars from this day forward..."}
{"text":"This is a fantastic Mexican restaurant ! very welcoming staff and an awesome counter to eat it and watch the chefs work! Once I started eating the rice I knew the meal was going to be great. I had the carne asada lunch that was recommended....I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"It's been a long time since I've taken the time to write a review, but for Presidio, I just had to. My husband, my two girls and I are wild about this place!   First, the decor is clean and modern, and the service is warm and friendly.   Our meals were all fresh, and had that perfect, genuine touch of heat that I find lacking in the heavy, 1980s-style Mexi served up at Pinata and Mi Patio.   For dinner our first night there, my husband enjoyed a selection of tacos, and I had the green chile pork. It reminded me of that dish everyone's Mexican uncle makes that causes the whole family to swoon. So good. They also accommodated the tastes of my girls, and made the youngest a simple bowl of beans with soft, hot tortillas on the side. My eldest had the taquitos, which were not greasy at all, despite being fried. Oh, and the homemade horchata is fantastic.   We went back for breakfast this week. My mother-in-law had the breakfast burrito, and my husband had the huevos rancheros, and both were perfect. I had the chilaquiles and OMG. *Hearts for Eyes* Again, they made some simple eggs, beans and tortillas for my girls, even though such a meal is not on the menu. Everyone devoured their meals.   We can't wait to go back. I want to try EVERYTHING.  Presidio is our family's new favorite restaurant. They're sure to get sick of seeing our faces."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious!! If you want real Mexican food (that actually tastes like it) then look no further! Menu is simple, options not overdone. Plates are a perfect abundant portion.  Today I got the Huevos Rancheros and my Dad got the Chilaquiles. My plate was perfect!! It even came with papas con chorizo which is my favorite Mexican breakfast. The actual huevos rancheros were so good though, and I could tell the tostadas were made fresh which is awesome. My dad loved the chilaquiles and because he's from Mexico I was so happy he loved it here!! He's a tough guy to impress ;)  I also tried their Iced Latte with vanilla and it was very good.   Service was great and a huge plus was the 10% off check in offer! It's also in such a convenient central location, so we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Came in on a late Sunday afternoon and could choose between either brunch of lunch. My fiancé and I went for lunch. Started with the guac (it's amazing) and then we both ordered tacos. I tried the veggie and shrimp he got the piggie plate. We finished with a fried goodie topped with whipped cream and berries. The staff was great! Casual atmosphere and AMAZING food. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This is an update on my year ago review. I decided to give this place a try one more time. Considering all the great reviews here figured maybe they got better since they first opened. Well I had just a small noon snacl I ordered the carnitos taco and the mexican street corn. I was taking it to go so imagine my surprise when I opened my to go bag and found a tiny little taco not worth the 4.95. The taste was good but like I said tiny for the price. next up my favorite..the street corn. Imagine my surprise when I see a container of what looks like creamed corn. They must not serve it on the cob anymore and instead take the corn off the cob mix in the cheeses and spices. It tasted okay but certainly was missing that grilled corn taste and not worth the 4.95... It seriously reminded me off the  creamed corn Mom gave is as kids. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"It pains me to write this review because this place had so much potential. It's ambience is perfect for date night, very cozy with dim lighting and small enough to not be bothered by other patrons, but large enough so you are not on top of one another. We usually try new taco places on Taco Tuesday and I was aware 7pm was cutting it a little late so I called Presidio ahead of time to make sure they were still running the specials. I called a few places before them but the man I spoke to assured us they were still hosting the special for the rest of the night so excitedly we headed over. Our first impression of our server was curt, he did not get us waters or offer us complimentary chips like the rest of the patrons. The restaurant wasn't empty, but it definitely wasn't bustling either. When I tried to converse with him, mentioning we were here for Taco Tuesday, he gave me a puzzled look and said that it was long over. I repeated my conversation on the phone and he went back to check. He returned and said in a very annoyed tone that the manager did say that, (the manager was the man I spoke to), and that he, the waiter, wasn't informed. He muttered that he was working there for years and this was news to him. Okay... awkward. We didn't try to push it and he walked away with our orders. On the bright side, we tried to ignore this incident and focus on our meal, part of which was  a tequila flight - a wonderful helping of three quality tequilas for $14!- and a variety of yummy tacos. Shrimp was the best in my opinion. I could've lived with just eating my tacos and drinking my tequila and chalked up the first incident as a small blip but... we ordered a second helping of tacos. This second order, regrettably, took much too long to come out. As in, someone else at the table next to us ordered tacos after us and he received his order way earlier than we did. At this point, we were agitated but still, trying to be polite. Midway through our meal the manager started to service us because it was clear our waiter was being rude and tensions were high. The owner poured us our water, brought us fresh chips, and tried to keep the peace. He was much kinder than our waiter. But when our waiter came back with the bill, we were charged the tacos without the Taco Tuesday prices and for the chips that everyone else received for free! It took some more time for the manager to correct this mistake- if we hadn't said anything we would've been charged an additional $20, and this time, our waiter gave us an apology for overcharging us. Trust me, this Taco Tuesday drama was not worth our time!  I have no idea of what is going on with the communication with the waitstaff and management but I felt like customer service was so unacceptable that yummy tacos and tequila was not enough to make up for this terrible dining experience. I gave them two stars because the food itself was good and I could see the manager was trying. But customer service is so important, and this was such a disappointment."}
{"text":"I have ate here a few times and it was delicious and the service great each time. I dont get why this place doesnt draw the crowds in, maybe they need some pretentious name (Sauce!) and a modern setting to fool people into eating some epic food, not too sure. We were eating when a group tentatively contemplated going in before leaving, those bastards missed out.  The huevos rancheros have such an awesome ranchero salsa, eggs perfectly cooked, and the fresh from scratch corn tortillas make it perfection. It is hard to order anything else but the corn is good, the enchiladas are delicious as well(warning if you dont like onions much you will want to ask since it had a bit), i love onions so it worked out well. I have yet to try the el pastor tacos but that is my next venture. Also their chorizo is freshly made as well and my wife's favorite.  If you want some authentic mexican food with super fresh ingredients, a caring owner and not some faceless hidden corporations version of urban dining like most of the ones downtown, I would give it a shot.  Things to note:  green stew is tasty and mild  their green chicken enchiladas are really really great without the onions Their totopos with chicken are amazing If you order the tacos, you may want to ask for the toppings on the side They have a great staff with top notch customer service"}
{"text":"Came here with a large work group after a volunteering function and we had the most amazing lunch!  Eating healthy for my upcoming wedding, I went with what I believe was the only salad on the menu. Everyone knows that you don't order salads at Mexican restaurants.. The real flavor is typically in the cheesiest and greasiest dishes... :)  It's be an understatement to say I was pleasantly surprised by how fresh and flavorful this salad was! The dressing had a nice but not overpowering cilantro flavor, the fajita style peppers added a zesty greasy flavor (but without all those calories), and the shrimp I ordered a top the salad was grilled to perfection.   Service was great considering the size of the group. Overall, zero complaints in terms of service and food quality.  Casual and clean atmosphere, would definitely return for that scrumptious salad!"}
{"text":"Whoa.   1. Some of the best tacos EVER. If you were considering traveling abroad for tacos, you would do well to consider this a destination.    2. The corn was just... just... perfect (like triple rainbow good).   Eat here."}
{"text":"After so many 4+ star reviews and was highly recommended by friends, I finally got to try out Presidio. It was sort of hidden and easy to miss the turn into the strip mall. I called for their happy hour specials. The lady on phone indicated it was 4PM to 6PM. Apparently; they must have changed the time and extended another hour ending at 7PM now.   I ordered the fish, Al Pastor, and Caritas tacos.They were all so flavorful, tasty, and so affordable. The fish taco stands out among the three. Save room and try one their desserts. Their Alfajor (sandwich cookies filled with dulce de leche, a creamy caramel confection made from milk and sugar) not to be missed. It will go so well with a cup of coffee too."}
{"text":"Outstanding food and service, in an adorable little restaurant!  We came in for brunch/lunch on a Saturday.  I had a breakfast burrito, which was super tasty.  I saved half of it for my breakfast the following day.  Really clean, fresh little spot not far from the Heard Museum.  Wouldn't hesitate to come back for beautiful and fresh food for a great price."}
{"text":"You want authentic, affordable Mexican food from people who clearly enjoy and care about the food they serve, go here!"}
{"text":"Place is great! Great customer service, and the food is authentic Mexican flavor! We had then chilaquiles and menudo and chorizo burrito, were all on point! Great taste. Food is very fresh so you have to be patient because it's not fast food but worth the wait! My kids loved"}
{"text":"Delicious, fresh, authentic Mexican food that isn't too heavy. Everything is fabulous! Taquitos and flautas are super crispy and full of flavor. Fajitas and enchiladas are made fresh and traditional. The drinks are small, but made with high quality, top shelf liquors. The staff is friendly and very polite. And with drinks and appetizers, our whole meal was under $20 per person. If I lived in the area, I would definitely be a regular here!"}
{"text":"We found this gem after being ignored at Barrio Cafe. That was a Blessing because the service & the food were top notch!  The BEST guacamole & we got the Quesedilla Ron Chiccaron & it was delicious!  Home cooked Mexican and five star service.   Hope to be back soon!"}
{"text":"I found this really rich home-cook Mexican eatery off S. Thomas Street in midtown Phoenix .... The Pozole was divine and the specialty cocktails were reasonably prices ... It's called Presidio de Mexico ....Jamaica drink was real good .   My entree ... Cochinita is a yucatan pork dish ... Braised and tangy orange with achiote spice and coloring and pickled onion .... Delicioso"}
{"text":"One of the best breakfast spots in Phoenix, in my personal opinion. And they deliver! The food quality is very good and great customer service. I would definitely recommend. Keep up the good work"}
{"text":"Walked in and immediately fell in love with the smells floating around, a good sign we were about to eat something amazing. The staff was very courteous and attentive throughout our dinning experience. Great menu and very reasonable prices.  The food was absolutely delicious, you will not be disappointed. We had the tamal     plate and chilaquiles with chicken, so good! We will definitely be returning here again."}
{"text":"I would come back I ordered chilaquiles and they were perfect! Didn't come with beans or rice just ordered on the side. My kids ordered tamale with eggs and beans they say it was spicy but good. Overall I give it 5 stars, a bit pricy but it was worth it. It's very hard to find authentic Mexican food. Good job see you next time we're in town."}
{"text":"The best Mexican food I've ever had!!! We spent several days in Phoenix and ate here for lunch and dinner every day it was so good. The service is amazing, the prices are very fair and the horchata truly divine. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"So I actually came here 3 weeks ago during spring training. My friends and I came upon this restaurant and thought we would give it a try. Thank god I did. The food was amazing. I went on a Sunday so they had menudo. They only have it on the weekends so you no it's good. Their presidio tacos were amazing and my friends had the huevos rancheros and those were good. But their customer service is the reason I will go back."}
{"text":"Food is beyond words... Delicious authentic Mexican food.. I recommend the shrimp tacos... Don't forget to save room for dessert because you want to have their buñuelos ..."}
{"text":"Upscale Mexican fare without pretension. Our preference over Barrio. Noticeable lack of grease on anything fried especially tortillas. I'm a big fan of their chicharones. Has become the spot we take out of town visitors and they love it."}
{"text":"I am sooooooo happy I saw the reviews for this restaurant. They are accurate in their positive assessment. The food is delicious.   We had the Mar y Tierra and the 3 piggies tacos. WOW!  My daughter ordered a side of the rice and it was some of the best I've had.   We loved the food so much we ignored our full bellies and ordered dessert. So glad we did. We got the Flan and the cookies with caramel and nuts in the middle (sorry, can't remember the name).  We are looking forward to our return visit."}
{"text":"Best chilaquiles in town. Geat service and very friendly staff. Drove in from Cali and we were in search of good mexican food. after reading some reviews we decided on this mexican restaurant which serves home style chilaquiles! we also ordered rice and quesadillas and our kiddo really enjoyed it."}
{"text":"What an amazing find. This restaurant is tucked away in a strip mall. I was so shocked from the from the from scratch menu, to the drinks all handmade and amazing wait staff. It was a five star restaurant. I highly recommend this restaurant if you love great Mexican food and are willing to pay for quality."}
{"text":"My husband and I had been meaning to come here for a while as it's only half  a mile from King's Convenience (one of our favorite watering holes) We finally made it there last night.  We started off with, what I think is,  the best queso fundido I've ever had - not just from a cheese and chorizo standpoint, but the tortillas - the fresh flour tortillas that were beautifully charred. My husband got a trio of tacos - carne asada, pork belly and shrimp. All amazing and housed in homemade corn tortillas. It came with a side of street corn (also beautifully charred and taken off the cob - a plus)  I got the chicken enchiladas with the addition of their famous mole - 25 plus ingredients and takes hours to make. I call it the \"crack of condiments\" - generous portion served with rice and beans. For dessert we had the velvety flan - a perfect ending to a perfect meal.  So glad we finally made it - restaurant is quite small, so be prepared to wait. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Eating at Presidio is a delight for all!  I had the chicken enchiladas with he red sauce and they were divine.  The salsa has a nice flavor and a little bit of heat to add to the flavor.  My son had the chilaquiles and I snuck a few bites and have to say they are some of the best I had anywhere.  The combination of the tortilla, eggs and salsa was perfect.  The chicken that was added in put them in a class by themselves.  Si tienes chanza no pierdes la oportunidad de comer en Presidio."}
{"text":"This was our first visit to the presidio and we were very pleased. We were not very familiar with the menu, but we were helped by very pleasant and wonderful staff. The food was delicious, I specifically enjoyed the carnitas taco and the green tamale. We finish with the flan and it was just flawless. Definitely will go back again."}
{"text":"This is the best Mexican food I've ever had, hands down. The street corn is ridiculous, you want a bucket to take it home with u! The tacos are delicious with hand made tortillas. The chips are warm and fresh. The pozole is delicious too. No words...so good!"}
{"text":"Terrific local restaurant, quietly tucked into a small strip center.   Tacos are PHENOMENAL!   And the margaritas were great.  Our waiter was very friendly and helpful with dinner ideas.   A great find for a random search.  You will go back!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing! Great chilliquillas and they make their own chorizo...best margarita and michelada which is a Mexican Bloody Mary!!! OMG! Small quaint clean and vet comfortable restaurant with a family feel. Great service! I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Taco Tuesday is the best here! $2 tacos - great local biz and the most amazing food! You gotta go here!!! Tortas are great and the margaritas are strong! Their green salsa is to die for."}
{"text":"If you like chorizo, this is your holy grail! The menu is extensive and they have a lot of incredibly interesting things on there. We had a really tough time making a decision but settled on the chorizo fundido. Who would've known that just two ingredients mixed together would have such a dynamite flavor?! Our server brought it out in a skillet while the cheese will still bubbling. Nestled beautifully on top was a generous layer of one of the most delicious tasting chorizo I've ever had! They make their tortilla and chorizo in house, and it tastes incredibly fresh and flavorful. I will be getting the fundido every time I visit this place!    After scraping every little bit of this, we decided to order the pollo, al pastor and chorizo (duhhh!) tacos. To be entirely honest, their al pastor was quite forgettable and chicken was alright. The chorizo taco, however, knocked it out of the park! This obviously came as no surprise. Overall, I think this is a pretty great establishment and I'll definitely return to try some more things from the menu."}
{"text":"Everything was alright I guess. The Chile verde was mediocre but the queso fundido was pretty good. The service wasn't that great but probably because they only had one guy for the entire restaurant. Maybe I will try the breakfast there, supposedly it's better??? Definitely way too pricey for what we got, your better off going to the eribertos down the street for dinner."}
{"text":"Phoenix is in for a ride with this spot serving some of the best authentic Mexican food in the city! The real question is what i HAVEN'T tried at this place that I didn't like!?! Talk about ordering the whole left side of the menu! In no particular order of favorites because it kept getting better and better with every plate they came out with.   Chilaquiles with verde sauce jump started my food journey in this place. This dish is actually quite simple to make but when every ingredient is fresh and homemade, you can really experience the complexity of flavors in this dish and every dish they serve.   Shrimp taco was really just life changing and I'll leave it at that! Some placed like to fry it to add texture, but it ends up being oily and overly dressed in sauce. They serve their shrimp tacos pan fried not fried and the dressing gives a great kick to the flavor of the shrimp!   Cochinita pibil taco is as good as you are going to find it in Phoenix. The juiciness of the pork marinate is really soaked up by their FRESH handmade tortilla. Their homemade pickled veggies on top adds a nice acidity to the fatty-ness of the pork.   Aguachile is no joke. Packs a lot of heat, acidity and freshness of the seafood!    Quesadilla - not traditionally made, so don't be surprised if you get more a taco looking dish. That is an authentic quesadilla with the rich flavors of the meat, the fresh cojita and pickled onions!   Their tequila cocktails are a great pairing to any of their dishes!   I will admit that I know the people the work at the restaurant and it can show bias in this review. Then you can also look at the fact that I live in LA and have tried out some of the better if not the best Mexican restaurants in the area that are serving similar dishes so I have a comparison or a standard to go by. You can really just go by the fact that hundreds of people have reviewed this place before me and have already raved about this place! So just call this review as an appreciation and gratitude of the service and quality food I received from a hardworking staff that wants to bring authentic Mexican food to a great city!"}
{"text":"The best Mexican restaurant we have ever eaten at! Very authentic and delicious food! We had the pleasure to meet the owner Lucy. She and her family own and operate the restaurant, they prepare their own family recipes and they are amazing!"}
{"text":"One of the best chili rellenos I've ever had. I really liked how it didn't have a really thick batter on it. My husband really liked the trio of tacos he got. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"This place is half a mile from my house, and I never knew it was here. Drove by it hundreds of times. Never again, it's a favorite.i had Al Pastor, Carnitas, Carne Asada tacos. My friend had the Enchilada plate. All was very good, flavorful, and above all, FRESH!! Give it a try if you're in the area. Right across from St. Joe's!!"}
{"text":"Good food and great service! It was small and while it was lunch time, there was no rush."}
{"text":"This is the second time I've been here and it's more delicious than the first... if that's even possible. I ordered the huevos rancheros, which were amazing and authentic. The person I went with ordered chilaquiles-- delicious. I definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"The food here is amazing.  The jamaica is fresh, the chorizo on the queso fundido was on point, las enchiladas verdes were super tasty. Great customer service and so homely. Loved it!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Mmmm what can I say? I've going here since they open.  I love the authentic Mexican flavor.  They are not afraid to make my food spicy just how I like it. I definitely go here often. There's not a dish I do not like. Although I'll say the green chilaquiles, the flautas and the shrimp tacos are my favorite.  Go here if you want to try authentic Mexican food."}
{"text":"Just finished with our 3rd breakfast visit to this restaurant and we had another great experience. My wife had the chorizo burrito. It was packed full and the chorizo was delicious. Once I find a place that does chilaquiles well that's all I order so I can only say that they are 3 for 3 with this dish. We've decided now we have to try their happy hour specials so I'll review this update once we've been."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food I ever had. And fast friendly service. Had guacamole sprinkled with cojita cheese and fresh warm chips, and the best veggie taco I ever tasted on warm homemade corn tortillas. And a delicious margarita. Husband had tamale and enchilada combo that was out of this world. Super authentic and absolutely delicious. Going back the day we leave Phoenix again next week!"}
{"text":"My cousin and I read the reviews and thought, sure, let's give it a try.  Fantastic! Delicious! Fresh! Authentic, Mexican cuisine.  Located in a strip mall, the staff is friendly and helpful. Margaritas are tasty and fresh (no sweet and sour stuff)."}
{"text":"El sábado fue la primera ves q estuve en este restaurante me encanto el servicio solo contaba con 20 minutos para desayunar y me atendiendo súper rápido y la comida estuvo deliciosa es cómodo y está muy limpio gracias a las personas que nos atendieron recomiendo este lugar si andas por la 5 ave y Thomas no dudes en llegar a disfrutar de una rica comida mexicana!!!"}
{"text":"Came in for lunch had the veggie tacos,  fantastic to say the least  , the people hear are friendly and attentive to your dining experience, so far one if the better Mexican places, I gave tried, strongly recommend it"}
{"text":"This place was absolutely amazing! We went for happy hour and got horchata (to die for), a guava/tequila drink that was delicious, and a variety of tacos. All of the tacos we tried used fresh ingredients and bold layers of flavor - couldn't pick a favorite if I tried. Probably the best Mexican place I've ever been to. The servers were friendly and efficient, the restaurant is clean and welcoming, and the world-class food will knock your socks off for what looks like a hole-in-the-wall place.  Also, the flan is not to be missed. Perfectly set, fresh, homemade. Gorgeous."}
{"text":"Amazing food and friendly staff!  We stopped for lunch based on all the great reviews. You order at the counter and they bring the food to your table.   Some regulars at the next table recommended we get the tacos so we did. I had a cochinita pibil, pastor and fish taco. The pibil and the pastor tacos were some of the best I have ever had!  The fish taco was good but had a little too much mayo in the slaw so I had to scrape some off.  Great lunch spot!"}
{"text":"Presidio was exactly what we were looking for: local authentic spot with great food. We found it here. The Quesadilla Roja con Chicharrón was excellent. Their Burrito with Asada was great too. Very friendly service at this family owned and operated spot."}
{"text":"So so so good!!! Everything is homemade and delicious. The salsas and fresh chips are tasty. The guacamole was extremely good. Our server recommended burritos to the men that weren't on the menu and they both loved them. I had the cochinita pibil and I am so happy and full! The pork was extremely tender and really flavorful. Great with the black beans and delicious homemade tortillas. I wish I lived here so that I could eat here every week."}
{"text":"I went to Presidio with family late on Saturday.  We knew it was highly rated on Yelp, and boy did they deliver.  Chili Verde was awesome!  Everyone enjoyed the excellence of their dishes.  Try this place!"}
{"text":"Excelente lugar de comida Mexicana autentica, todo esta riqusisimo! el favorite de mi esposo es el pozole, a mi me encantan los tacos y el agua de horchata es autentica como la hacen en el centro de Mexico o sea  de muerte...riquisima, super recomendado!!"}
{"text":"Back again, today it was the guacamole, complete with cojita cheese followed by the Al Pastor burrito off the lunch special, knocked back with an Arnold Palmer.   The service again was very good. Attentive but not obtrusive and the fact that our server insisted that my girl order first made the experience complete.   We have know done breakfast and lunch, we will be back again for dinner and margaritas.   Highly Recommended."}
{"text":"I tried this place long time back and that time I had ordered enchiladas with red sauce, it was good but not exceptional.But recently i ordered 3 taco's (shrimp, chicken and fish) with corn on side. It was one of the best tacos I have ever had, the tortilla had a unique flavor, shrimp chicken and fish was cooked so well. Will definitely comeback and will recommend this place."}
