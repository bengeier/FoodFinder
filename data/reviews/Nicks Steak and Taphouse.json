{"text":"Unbelievably bad service.  I would imagine this place will be out of business by the end of the year,  but the restaurant scene in Waxhaw is so bad, who knows.   Food was decent,  even though the firecracker shrimp is five tiny shrimp...not good for a family.  Grill your own steaks at home...you will be better off!"}
{"text":"Ordered the \"feature\" Prime Rib; was told 30 minutes later they had sold out of it.  They offered a Ribeye as a substitute that looked like it was from the Sizzler.  Service was very slow & will not return."}
{"text":"I had a groupon I had to use up by the end of the month and finally went last night. after reading the reviews I was not anticipating a great dining experience.  On the positive side I have to give kudos to the hostess, unfortunately, I didn't get her name, but she has long blond hair.  Very friendly, after she sat us she came back a few minutes later and said the waitress was busy and took our drink order, later in the evening I saw her walk past a table and grabbed some empty dishes.  If their waitstaff worked as hard as this young lady they would be successful.  Our waitress was friendly but inept.  Had to be constantly reminded to do something.  Ordered a sweet tea but received unsweet told her right away but had to remind her that I never got it had similar experience at end of dinner when I requested a tea to go. I ordered the ribeye with a baked potato and my wife ordered the prime rib sandwich with mac n cheese.  The ribeye was cooked perfectly.  Tasted great it could have used better grill marks but still was very good. My baked potato was cold, I sent it back and asked the waitress not to reheat it in the microwave.  She brings me back a different potato about as cold and hard as the first.  I switch to fires.  Unfortunately, the fries didn't come till I was almost done with my steak.  I wife thought the sandwich and mac n cheese was very good. I found the combination of the décor, the music, and tvs all over the walls didn't match. The music was like something I hear when I take my kids to Hollister, the tvs cheapened the place making it more a sports bar, The décor made it look like a nice to upscale restaurant.  I have not been to the other Nick's so I have to compare this to. s I was surprised but not surprised that a manager never came to our table to ask how was everything.  The restaurant was slow and with the lack of stellar reviews I would of thought they would be uber sensitive to guest feedback. Unless ownership does some drastic changes I don't see Nick;s surviving much longer It costs a lot of money to open a restaurant,  but money doesn't make you a restauranteur."}
{"text":"We had our rehearsal dinner here and it was amazing!! I love the old theater feel!!!"}
{"text":"We went to Nick's on their 2nd night after opening, so I expected some hiccups as they worked out the kinks. There were a few issues (mainly the waitress not knowing certain things and having to constantly run back to ask a manager), but the service was prompt and the food was very good. We got the early bird special, which was a great deal ($13.99 includes soup or salad, bread, entree, and seasonal dessert). The bison meatloaf was a pleasant surprise, a huge slab of meatloaf (enough for two meals!) with a spicy aioli and creamy mashed potatoes. My husband's burger was juicy and he loved the pimento cheese spread on it. Even the kids meal, while it looked a little skimpy for $5.99, it was a hit with my daughter! And the dessert portions were substantial and very tasty. I would definitely try them again."}
{"text":"Nick's steak and taphouse is awesome!! Service was GREAT! Food was even better!! Blue chz fondue is a must have. Mmm. Then wedge blue chz salad-perfect! And to top it all off PIMENTO CHEESE FILET! Omg insanely good! Will be back over and over again!"}
{"text":"The food is still good, we had to wait too long for it, but the service is still terrible."}
{"text":"Third time was NOT a charm. The food is good and well presented. The service is horrible. Complaints management get a smile and \" we'll fix it\". But, they don't. Too bad. Nick had a chance to have a great business in an under-served market. But, they're really blowing their chance for first impressions. Save yourself the frustration and dine somewhere else."}
{"text":"Just want to get my two cents in as we were there in August and it was below average.    I do not know why this place keeps going through various iterations.  We have experienced three in the 16 months we have lived in the area.  Location is good, parking is great, but the kitchen just can't come up with decent versions of what otherwise is a good menu.  Maybe the next iteration?  Will let you know."}
{"text":"I've been to Nick's (Waxhaw) three times now, and I have waited this long to write a review on purpose. First impressions are sometimes deceiving, and I believe this is the case with Nick's. This is not to say all the problems are fixed, but they are definitely making improvements.   First, the food has never been a let down. Is there room for improvement? Well, in some areas the portions could be better, but the quality has always been good. I've had a burger, wings, ribs and macaroni and cheese in my three visits, and they were all very good.   However, service is the area where there has always been a problem, not the food. I will say that the service was very good the last two times I have been there. If you're going for dinner, ask for Natalie, she was an EXCELLENT server. Bar service was a little slow, but our food came out fast and was hot. Natalie's attention to detail was very good. So long as we get her again, I would have no issues with eating at Nick's.   Since I am not completely convinced service has been fixed completely, there's a one star deduction there.   The only other issue I have with Nick's is the staff's confusion on the (admittedly large number of) specials. They're rarely rang up correctly, but they have always honored them after the mistake was made. This confusion shows a lack of training, so hopefully this gets remedied, but their specials are fantastic. Lack of training/organization hurts the experience, so there's another start off there.  I wouldn't be scared away of Nick's, it's a solid place that needs some tweaking. It's not up to par with some of the other fantastic restaurants in Waxhaw (not sure what Justin V is talking about), but there is definite potential.   P.S.: Watch out for the leaky AC vents, we had to move twice because of them.   Check them out, it's worth a shot, and is certainly not a 1 star establishment as a whole."}
{"text":"I was really disappointed in this particular Nick's.  The reviews of the Charlotte location are much better.  I sat at the bar and it took the bartenders too long for everything...to notice me, to take my drink order, to bring me my receipt, etc.  It appeared that was par for the course with those around me too.  The folks to my right didn't get their salad before their entrees came out.  The ones to the left had to ask for their check so they could leave.    Since I was by myself, the manager said he'd buy me a beer if I would change seats to accommodate a couple.  No problem.  When he couldn't flag down any of the bartenders to let them know to comp my drink, I guess he forgot because guess what was on my bill?   As far as the food, I ordered a medium well burger and the mac n cheese.  The burger came out medium rare.   Think I'll stick to the Charlotte restaurant.  Not worth the drive..."}
{"text":"I haven't lived in Charlotte that long and I saw Nicks was also new so I decided to try it. Best decision I have made since I moved down here... As soon as me and my girlfriend  walked in we were greeted by 2 very nice young ladies who escorted us to our table. We were greeted by our server very quickly. The atmosphere was very inviting and pleasant. Me and my girlfriend decided to get the blue crab and artichoke casserole as an appetizer to share. The potato chips served with it were fantastic, I would definitely get it again. We then got our salads, I have never been a blue cheese fan but their wedge salad with blue cheese dressing was the perfect size and was amazing, words cant even describe how awesome it was! My girlfriend ordered the Salmon which she actually got to decide how it was prepared which was very nice. It was very fresh and flavorful! I ordered the filet mignon with a pimento cheese crust. BEST FILET I HAVE EVER HAD. The best part about our experience was that we had multiple servers ask us how we were doing, kind of like a team effort which was really nice. We usually don't get dessert but we decided to get the cheesecake with a raspberry sorbet topping, again words cant describe how great it was. My girlfriend ended up eating most of it! I would definitely recommend Nicks Steak and Taphouse and I will be going back as soon as I get the chance!"}
{"text":"Since there are very few options in Waxhaw to dine, I was really hoping for Nick's to be good as I love to support local businesses. Our waitress was very nice and we felt that she was very attentive and we did not feel ignored as others have mentioned. However, we were less than impressed with the food. The Gorgonzola Potato Cake tasted like it was dropped into the fryer straight out of the freezer as there was that \"frozen\" taste to it. My wife's sliced prime rib sandwich appeared to be served on a hot dog bun and was very well-done which made the meat tough to eat. Presentation of the food was simple and looked like I would serve at home rather than restaurant quality presentation. My burger showed up with the burger on the bun and the potato cake on the side, all of which was the same color and looked less than exciting to eat. Even Applebee's puts some garnish on the plate. Sometimes you just know that you will return to a place, but this was our first and last experience here unless there are changes. I hope that improvements will be made that may cause us to return, but, as of now, we will find other options."}
{"text":"I had heard so much about the other location that I really wanted to love this place. Besides it was now only 10 minutes from the house and that would make it perfect. But the food was good, the service was okay , but there really wasn't anything special about the night. We may go back but with so many other restaurants in Charlotte, it may be quite a long time."}
