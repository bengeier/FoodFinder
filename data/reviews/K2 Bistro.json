{"text":"The food is OK the idea is great but I'm not going to go there anymore with my friends because the cashier is a total bitch. I don't think it is normal for someone to tell a customer \"that's the way it works in Qc \" followed by \"the tip ain't included to the bill \" after adding taxes to everything. I was suppose to pay 15 per person. We ended up paying 20 each with taxes then she forced us to separately tip her 4 dollars with HUGE attitude. So we payed 24 dollars. That's a nine dollar difference. Taxes and tip shouldn't be nine dollars extra per person.   In conclusion, you should pay for the food, not her attitude."}
{"text":"I like this place. Been there a couple of times. The food is good and the staff is really amazing. They really care about your satisfaction. I will come back for sure. One of the best \"all you can eat\" in Montreal"}
{"text":"Worst service ever ! The waiter was so rude and careless we asked him to switch tables because the seats were not comfortable and there was so many empty tables he got offended and started insulting us in Chinese so we do not understand .. When u walk in to this place u don't feel  welcomed !!! my advice  is to go to other sushi places out there that offer  you a much better food and service"}
{"text":"PLEASE don't go to K2 Bistro! I've been to many AYCE sushi restaurants in Montreal, and K2 was my worst experience! Not only the food was bad, but the way I was treated by the restaurant was unethical and it is the reason why I decide to open a Yelp account and write my first review. Please continue reading my review to understand how ridiculous and unacceptable the situation was.  My husband and I went to try K2 sushi for supper. We were seated at a tiny table for 2 in the corner of the restaurant. We've placed our order and when most of the food arrived, the table started to lack of space. I kindly asked the waitress if it was possible to use the table beside us that was empty so we can have more spaces. You won't believe what answer I received. The waitress told us that if I want a table for 4, I will have to pay for 3 people! ... Sorry? Did I hear wrong?! There were two 4-ppl-tables taken by two couples, and the waitress said they were paying for 3 and if we don't believe we can go ask them! My husband was going to stand up and ask the other tables, but I didn't want to make things big and ruin our date night, so I stopped him. 1) if they really charged them for 3 ppl, this restaurant is illegal. 2) if they did not charge them for 3, this restaurant is lying. No matter what, this is so wrong! I kind of regret to not let them charge us for 3 people so i can file an official complaint to the Office de la protection du consommateur!   All this to say, don't go to K2 sushi because of their unethical way of doing business! If you really want sushi buffet, there are plenty of choices around that area: Sushi Crescent, Toro Sushi, Odaki, etc. Just stay away from K2!"}
{"text":"So bad! That is the only way i can describe both the service and the food. The waitress was rude, the salmon was disgusting (not bad no, it was disgusting) and we did not get our order in full (had to ask the manager for the lychee jelo...). If possible, go anywhere but here. If impossible, still go anywhere but here."}
{"text":"I went to bistro k2 on Sunday night of May 29, 2016 at 645pm. When I went to pay my bill of $66.06 for only 2 people, I left a $4 tip. It is my opinion that the bill of 66.06 is already high enough for 2 sushi dinners. A $10 tip was too much in my opinion for a quick sushi dinner. A tip is at the customer's discretion. Has tipping become a tax? If so, why is that? The woman taking the payment then proceeded to tell me the tip was not enough and asked me if I had any more money to make up the difference. I explained to her the customer can tip at their discretion and I wouldn't be leaving any more money. I had already paid my bill in full plus some and they wanted me to stay and pay more money to them. I then proceeded to walk out but I turned around and asked to speak to a manager. I felt the woman taking the payment was rude to ask for more of a tip. I asked the manager for the $4 back that I left because I wasn't interested in tipping that night due to their attitude. I was then told by the manager and I quote \"here's your $4 and please don't come back\". I guarantee you I will never return to this restaurant."}
{"text":"I Have eaten at this place about 15 times. Fish is usually fresh and flavours good. They do NOT serve tuna, which may or may not be a big deal for you. The menu has a lot of variety, but they recently replaced paper ordering with tablets and the system is annoying to use. This is a good quick place to eat at, the only real complaint being that there is frequently an odd smell, and that sometimes you get this one middle-aged male waiter who provides horrible service and his attitude is just the worst."}
{"text":"Worst services ever!the waitress and waiter are totally savages! And they even judge other customers by speaking Cantonese! And the cashier is totally a bitch!!! Never refill water and really really slow services.  Never go to this place please!"}
{"text":"As a huge fan of sushi, this place is the best buffet of sushi that I tried. I recommend the k2 sushi roll if you like the cheese. I used to go there 4 times a week. sound so crazy, right?been there so often so that the boss recognize me?Not only the sushi is heavenly and delicate, but also the appetizer and sashimi are great. The service is awesome. It's worth enjoying the meal there?"}
{"text":"This place is fiya. My friends and I go to AYCE sushi places around downtown MTL so often that we're on a first-name basis with some servers. I've tried most options in the area, and as far as AYCE buffet goes, K2 is hands-down my fave. Higher-end decor / atmosphere for an AYCE place, the service is faster than most other places (and more friendly), and the selection is pretty good. K2 is not all of my friends' favorite AYCE sushi restaurant, but it has some unique choices like pumpkin soup appetizer that I personally really like. I mean, it's an AYCE place so don't be expecting too much. But as far as all the other AYCE sushi options go, this is one of the better ones."}
{"text":"To be honest me, my husband and my 4 yr old  son just came here because we saw in the internet it is a 3.9 stars rated. We really liked their signature sushi, ginger beef, but the rest are just okay. We went for all you can eat lunch. The waitresses are a bit intimidating although service is fast and good. We assumed that this is family owned so the food must be good. But overall the food was average. Fresh? Yes. Will come back again? Maybe. No drink refill is a bummer for all you can eat buffet.  Kyoto in toronto is much better when it comes to taste and selections."}
{"text":"I like this place a lot - huge menu, very quick service, very friendly workers, really good sushi! The all you can eat is a great deal! You order what you want on their tablet device and it comes out each time the next dish is ready. The sushi is very good quality, and nice portions. The cocktails seem pretty weak, though!"}
{"text":"I been there twice. First time: all good. Second time: horrible  I appreciate that on the menu it actually lists the ingredients in each sushi unlike other all you can eat sushi places. The decor is very nice and i i'm not picky with sushi so i thought i was good.  Actually we didn't even get to eat the second time. We get there on a busy nice weather saturday and the second floor is closed ...annoying. Then, they make us wait cuz there's not table available. Waiting is fine but what was horrible is the service and how we were treated. When we came in the restaurant, we could telll it was full but nobody even bothered looking at us nor asking us how many people we were. So i had to legit hunt down a waiter and had to ask her MANY times how long the wait was.  She kept saying she has no clue and could not give me any indication whatsoever. I worked at restaurants and it's your job to know who just got theere, who ordered a lot, who seems to leave soon.   So we didn't wanna be rude and decided to wait... 30 min later im starting to get pissed off and notice that many tables had not even received their first round of sushi so it was obviously gonna take a long time. I go back in to ask that grumpy waitress indication about the wait time and once again, she only says rudely \"i don't know, just wait, no guarantee\". She gave me the dirtiest look as if i was bothering her and she was just standing there not doing anything. After waiting 30 min, and being treated like garbage like that, just went the other side of the street to sushi crescent and had a nice meal.   Definitely never coming back. Sushi places generally don't have good service given the cheap price but this time was just too disrespectful. Bad service and rude places like this are the reason why i have a yelp account."}
{"text":"Amazing restaurant! Went for the first time and I was amazed that despite the restaurant being packed we got our food served immodestly. Lots of choice and really tasty. The sushis are fresh and tasty. Meats were really good. I wish I could try everything but there was so much to try. Will definitely go back. The decor is also very nice. Much better than kanda or toro."}
{"text":"best dish is the beef tataki n white fish carpaccio? best roll is k2 and Las Vegas , lots of delicious snacks there, usually wouldn't expect the above on all u can eat restaurant , but this place u can , good service and nice decor place , worth to try , don't forget to leave a good tip."}
{"text":"To begin, I think rating a sushi buffet is quite different than rating a typical a la carte restaurant. I think it's quite common to expect a pretty below average service lol, and if you do go on a weekend night, then also expect the high price combine with even slower below average service. BUT! It's a sushi buffet so let's talk about sushi!   I've being to this place a few times now, and I always order with my friend plenty of sashimi! Personaly, they have one of the best sashimi in town. It's cut in a beautiful portion and tastes delioosiosoo! Their signature sushi is also amazing. Their rice to sushi portion is well controlled unlike other buffets thst puts way too much rice. As for the tempura, it's good but not my favorite since it's served in quite a messy way.   In the end, if you came for sashimi and sushi you won't be dissapointed. If you came to be served like your royal highness, then you clearly didn't realise you came to a freaken buffet."}
{"text":"Not happy. Ordered some tempura, it tasted so SOUR.  My stomach felt weird after the dinner.  Over priced as well.  Not coming back."}
{"text":"Incredibly slow service at this place. As an all you can eat place, you can assume they are disinclined to bring you all the stuff you order. They totally \"forgot\" half our order or happened to be \"sold out\" on items like salmon skin.   In case you were wondering, this place appears to be Chinese owned and/or operated, not Japanese. If you couldn't tell by the typos on the menu or the Cantonese banter among the wait staff, you can tell from the menu. They basically put mayo and teriyaki sauce with crab stick in everything. Very little available in terms of raw fish but it's definitely frozen fish thawed to room temperature. No salmon fish roe or uni, no tuna or hamachi.  I would probably stick with Kanda or Odaki."}
{"text":"Most AYCE restaurants do two things to scam you. 1. Bring out all your heavy food first (rice based rolls, tempura) and leave the more expensive items like sushi and sashimi last and 2. cut you really thin slices of fish for your sashimi, two things my girlfriend absolutely hates. This place does neither. first of all after they take your order sheet they print off a receipt with everything you order on the table. they do this every time you order even if its just two bowls of ice cream (green tea is amazing by the way). The sashimi was beautifully cut and prepared   at least half an inch thick and quite fresh. They have a separate downstairs kitchen for their cooked dishes and we had amazing spicy mussels, a whole grilled squid (slightly overcooked), short ribs and grilled shrimp. We went Saturday night and every table was full, but they had 4 waiters and one hostess and many chefs so we never had to wait more than five minutes for dishes to start coming. As well the waitresses would announce what they had brought to the table for you which was fantastic especially for similar looking maki rolls. My girlfriend and I go to AYCE sushi quite often, and have never had an experience quite like this in Ottawa or Toronto. We are planning our next trip to Montréal just to eat here :P Overall, great food great vibe and great service even though the place is a little small."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time to celebrate my birthday with some friends from school. It's well located and nicely decorated but very strict! The people who serve you are all so uptight. They make sure to optimize the seating and they'll push your bags out of the way if it interferes with the path they've drawn out to serve. There are cameras everywhere, they have two people watching the doors in case you dine and dash I guess? They serve everything really hurriedly. Even the message on the Ipad before you place your order is strict (you will pay for any waste and/or damages).   A waitress did screw up one of our orders, she gave us shrimp tempura by mistake but they took it away without any trouble.   Just like Sushi Crystal, the tablet locks you out after the first order and you must ask a server to unlock it before ordering again.   Prices are a bit more expensive then the other surrounding AYCE sushi places. Quality is good, their K2 roll is original. They had good avocado rolls and the salmon was fresh. I order really basic stuff though so I usually prefer sushi places that charge less and maybe aren't as fancy.   Like most sushi places they will force you to tip 15% and anything slightly below will insult them.  There are tons of AYCE sushi places around Concordia so it's not like this is your only option if you're craving sushi."}
{"text":"It's right next to Concordia so you can go after class :) In terms of all you can eat sushi, this place is absolutely amazing, as the quality is far superior to nearby locations such as Sushi Crescent. The lunch menu is also full of variety- for the sushi itself and items from the wok and more. So so so so so so so yummy and great:)))"}
{"text":"Trop drôle : on commande avec des tablettes tactiles!! Très bon à volonté, et la serveuse (celle à l'étage) est hyper gentille et souriante !"}
{"text":"Très belle endroit, avec un superbe emplacement.  Pour commander nous sommes munis d'une tablette tactile ce qui est plutôt fun.  Très bonne présentation des sushis et ils sont très bon pour du \"à volonté\", en faite tout ce que nous avons mangé était excellent !  La raison pour laquelle je n'ai pas mis 5 étoiles, c'est à cause du service et de la politesse des employées ... dommage pour eux car ca aurait pu être un sans faute :)"}
{"text":"Amazing!!!!!!!! Me and my friend came yesterday and we loved the food so much everything was so delicious and tasted so fresh, the staff were very friendly and helpful which was great as we'd never been to a place like this before. So many good choices that we regret so much that we didn't order more food!!!!"}
{"text":"Ok quality sushi; better than Ottawa of course, but not by much. We were the first table there and service was pretty quick. They did not drop any orders.  However, I would pay more for a higher-quality all you can eat sushi."}
{"text":"K2 is a new sushi volante resto on Crescent, I used to enjoy Kanda around the corner and Sushi Crescent a block away...they have both gone downhill a bit. I tried this place recently and I was very impressed with the choices and quality. Very fresh sashimi."}
{"text":"Sushi was good for all you can eat. Service was a little slow and sloppy - it took a while to get cocktails and drinks. Overall good experience, but could have been a lot better."}
{"text":"2.5/5  A 'meh' AYCE sushi place. I don't have a point of comparison because I've never eaten at another AYCE sushi restaurant in MTL before K2 but definitely incomparable to merely decent counterparts in Toronto. The service was subpar and kinda slow towards the end. I also found a piece of plastic in one of my sushi rolls which was NOT nice. In terms of taste and presentation, both were decent but for value in terms of price, meh. The ambiance was nice though."}
{"text":"Overpriced. Horrible customer service. Waitress at the cashier had incredibly rude attitude. I accidentally dropped one sushi on the floor so I picked it up and put aside. At the end she told me I gotta pay $5 more because I didn't finish my order. After I explained why I had to left it that way, she answered me with despise. I mean, WOW. The total amount was $66 (for 2) plus tips. I certainly will not go back to eat here again because of their service."}
{"text":"They were very fast and the food was good. Small orders not like regular sushi.  Recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Saw in the internet it is a 3.9 stars rated so off we went. We really liked their signature sushi, ginger beef, but the rest are just okay. The grilled mussel tasted really fresh. Fried rice- could have been better! Miso soup - great to have ! Been looking to order beef short ribs but not in the menu in the ipad. We went for all you can eat lunch. ALSO, almost all their sushi dishes are with imitation crab in them which I am not really excited about! What's up with that?   The waitresses are a bit intimidating / sketchy although service is fast and good.    We assumed that this is family owned so the food must be good. But overall the food was average. Fresh? Yes. Authentic?-no . Most  sushi places I have been to in Canada have been modified in a way that most western people would like to eat. Tasty and flavorful? -Yes. Will come back again? Maybe. No drink refill is a bummer for all you can eat buffet."}
{"text":"Came on a Thursday night and the service was great. Lots of staff around to pick up your orders and refill our water. The food was all right-- my friends and I didn't like the salmon sashimi though, but the carpaccio was delicious and we ordered it many, many times, along with the beef tataki. Anything with spicy mayo, including spicy salmon roll, was drenched in spicy mayo though so I didn't enjoy those too much. We also didn't like the K2 roll too much but there were some other rolls under Signature which we enjoyed. Tempera was also enjoyable! Miso soup was a little saltier than I expected. Overall it was a decent experience!"}
{"text":"For AYCE standards this place is pretty great. The service is rather fast and the quality of food is above average. I would say is better than Kanda (Toro now). The portions are just right that you can try all sorts of different things and they have a pretty good range of selection from sushi to ramen.   Would come again."}
{"text":"Great sushi just a little expensive, came out to 81 something at dinner for all you can eat for two people"}
{"text":"K2 Bistro est comme tout le sushi buffets. Le qualité est pas bon, mais vouz pouvez manger jusqu'a vous etes morte. Je recommenderais le sushi ou sashimi saumon (dependent vous allez pour le déjuener ou le dîner) parce que il est normalement le plus frais.   Le service est mauvais mais c'est normalement comme ça pour tout les buffets."}
{"text":"This is a solid all you-can-eat sushi place. I usually don't like all-you-can-eat because the quality is not great and the environment is not the best, but the environment of this restaurant is actually very nice. The service was also better than the other all-you-can-eat places. There were several vegan options including the standard avocado rolls, cucumber rolls, tofu skin sushi, tofu salad, and some vegetable tempuras. They were also nice enough to make a mango tango roll without the crab stick for me. I came here for dinner with a friend on a weekday, but I think it's quite expensive for dinner."}
{"text":"Ive been visiting this place for a few times since they opened. Their selection of sushi is the average of similar buffets. They don't necessarily offer more than other AYCE sushi places but their price has been jacked up quite a lot. It is definitely not worth 32$. Their service has gone worse and worse to the point I would say abominable. The waiters are extremely unpleasant. Perhaps due to a good client base, they absolutely do not care about individual experience. They constantly stare at your plates to see if you have any leftover. They absolutely only take your plate if it's EMPTY. As in, if you take a grilled fish, you need to eat down the the bone or else they would just take all the other plates and leave that one hanging. While wasting food is not good, it's their passive aggressive way of handling this that make the experience extremely unpleasant. I would never go there again even if I crave sushi. There are plenty of sushi buffet of similar quality that offers at a lower price and with better service. Why pay almost 40$ to get some cold looks."}
{"text":"Love the sushi here! The service is minimal, as there are iPads to take your orders. The spot is really strict on waste so don't do it!! As to be expected, the wine list was limited (only one house wine by the glass). Washrooms could use a good wash too but to be brief, the sushi is good and the presentation isn't sloppy like you'd expect at all you can eat spots."}
{"text":"Je ne vais jamais à ce resto. C'est horrible avec la gérante. Elle est vraiment impolie devant les clients:("}
{"text":"My experience at K2 Bistro started out excellently with their nuanced concept of ordering via tablet coupled with a flat rate cost ($20 incl tax) for all you can eat. However, most of their food was mediocre and bland with the exception of their edamame and ice cream. The lunch took a turn for the worse when I commented to a friend I thought the ice cream was mochi (a traditional Japanese dessert) to which the waitress snickered in an overtly rude way. The final straw occurred when the same waitress, unsatisfied with my tip, demanded I rerun the transaction and I quote \"give me more $$\". Having worked in the service industry, I understand the desire and necessity for tips, however, she conducted herself in a completely inappropriate manner that made my dining experience feel more like a shake down rather than a meal. Had the service been superior not only would I have tipped more, but also I would have awarded them more stars for their mediocre \"sushi\"."}
{"text":"Worst experience I had at any restaurants. Do not go there. Insanely rude and unprofessional staff, poor service. Sushi is okay tasting... not worth wasting your time or money."}
{"text":"of the 6 different ayce sushi places I've been to, K2 bistro had the best service and fantastic salmon nigiri (some salmon pieces tasted like 5 star sashimi). our water glasses were always full and the waiter was fast to pick up our order paper  however, most of the food was typical ayce quality, not fantastic but pleasing to eat, and there were no drinks on the ayce menu   the biggest downside was the room we were eating in. it was so COLD that my friend actually put on her jacket halfway through the meal (second floor dining room). perhaps the downstairs room is warmer, who knows. it also took awhile to get the bill but maybe that's cause we stayed until the end of lunchtime and there were bigger tables to clean up  pretty decent price, was 21$ after tip and tax for lunch (dinner is much more expensive!)  overall, the service was great, food was average (with some standouts), environment was subpar but the ambiance was good (it wasn't too loud or noisy).   as a huge fan of ayce sushi, I must say K2 is definitely a great option and now in my repertoire of lunch places."}
{"text":"When in Montreal, walk down Cresent street and you can find a nice Asian fusion and Sushi place. You can order a la carte or pay about $30-$35 each for an all you can eat buffet. We got buffet..nice. The Good: you order everything from a small touchons screen. The good: very knowledgeable and  helpful service staff who help  guide us through the menus and the touch pad. The bar: yup when you eat buffet, make sure you hadn't eaten before otherwise...oh boy. The ugly: A bit crampy.  Tip: how to last long in this buffet. Don't drink a lot of water or rice meals, it makes your stomach easily full. Also they charge you if you leave food behind by not finishing your order. They also opened another similar restaurant in Markham so, you get the same experience. Good atmosphere for that intimate dining. You get a lot of tourists and university crowds from Concordia and McGill Universities. Certainly, our fav hangout and go to place.  $$-$$$(for their buffets)"}
{"text":"Cher mais bon. Les sushis au saumon et au mangue sont divin ainsi que plusieurs autres. Par contre, le service est bien ordinaire et aucune boisson n'est inclus dans le menu à volonté de sushi."}
{"text":"Today is my friend's birthday. We come o this restaurant for first time.  Very good and quick service.   Similar as Crystal Sushi, you order with a tablet. But you have to ask waitress to unlock it every time after each order.  They have their special roll : K2 roll."}
{"text":"Went on a long weekend's Sunday night, so the place was packed. Customer service was great. The standard Jap menu (sashimi, seaweed salad, etc.) was good and came fast, but the Beef Tataki and the Grilled Scallops deserve special mentions. I tried all the desserts but Matcha Ice Cream + Lychee Jelly combo* is gold.   *made this combo on my own so don't find it lol"}
{"text":"Super bon restaurant & service ! Je vous le conseil fortement, c'est l'un  des meilleurs sushi à volonté à Montréal"}
{"text":"Absolutely rude manager.  Nowhere was it written (not made aware verbally either) that there is a 15% \"service charge\" on top of the meal price.  I disputed the charge very politely.  She argued that \"this is how it works in Montreal\"  I replied with \"tipping is not mandatory, it's not the law.\" To which she replied you have to!  Absolutely terrible customer service, she told me I should not eat at K2 ever again before mumbling in CHINESE (they aren't even japanese at this place) to her coworkers.  I know enough Chinese swear words to know she wasn't speaking highly of me.    At least I told her it was illegal and paid not two cents more than the written price.  ( I gave her $0.01 tip for the good laugh I had afterwards about it)   Don't get scammed and have your food spat in.  PS.  The food was actually pretty good to be honest."}
{"text":"Let me tell you something. As you know, when you go to a buffet, you kind of starve yourself the prior 24 hours. So! This is the same thing! Large variety of sushis and sashimis and rolls and so on and so on. A lovely decor,  a nice staff, a relatively quick service. You can also get sake if you'd like to. Go on! Eat like pigs! But don't waste! You'll be charged on your wastes!!!  Warning! If you come in with large group of friends, the tip will be included in the bill. Approximately 35$ plus tips included on a friday night."}
{"text":"The first time I went here, I loved it. BUT, every other time after that has been a let down!!   What made me love K2 Bistro was their big, visually appealing makis, as well as the fun flavours used in some of their more unique sushi choices, such as the mango tango and the K2 roll (both very good, I really recommend trying both of those at least once). After the \"magic\" of my first visit, however, I found that they use WAY too much rice in their sushi. Not only does the excess rice distract from the other ingredients in the rolls (which should not be a thing, I want to be able to taste the freshness and individual tastes in the filling) and make the large makis more difficult than necessary to eat, but it left me feeling  uncomfortably full after one modest order.  Despite the fact that I actually really like the taste of their sushi, I will probably not come back for that reason, because it cut my experience short and made me feel like I didn't get my money's worth. There are many other AYCE sushi bars in Montreal that don't overstuff their sushi with fillers, and I know that I can eat way more sushi at those places ;)  However, the worst part about this place has to be the customer service. The last time I went with my fiancé, it took the staff 15 minutes to acknowledge us at the door (which I was kinda offended by since there were a few staff members chatting idly a few feet away with their back turned to us...) and about an hour to seat the two of us. When we were seated, the waiters weren't very friendly; there was almost no verbal communication between us and them, orders would be served without a word said or a smile cracked. Perhaps some people might enjoy not having to make awkward chit-chat with your waiter, but I personally found that the staff gave off an unwelcoming vibe.   Overall, even if I think that everybody should try K2's sushi once for the flavour, I wouldn't make this place a regular for your AYCE sushi nights."}
{"text":"Poor quality food even compared to other ayce restaurants. Fish is definitely not fresh and the cooked food tasted like fast food. There are far better ayce sushi options out there for anyone to return to this store. The main issue with my visit was that the rice was very hard, as if it was leftovers from yesterday. The menu boasts \"a wide selection\" but in truth it's around the same as most ayce selections, not to mention their cooked foods all taste the same, probably filled with salt and msg."}
{"text":"This is a Cantonese-run AYCE sushi but I love the service!!!! We visited for the $15.99 lunch and it features a HUGE menu.   My only complaint is the soup noodles and the soup, they are quite awful. It doesn't taste too good, but it satisfies your craving if you really want some.  They have squid sushi!  Spicy salmon and salmon rose is pretty good, acceptable. The food I would say is about 3 stars (and probably 2 stars compared to Toronto AYCE) but it's cheap, the sushi doesn't fall apart, it's NOT loaded with rice, and the service is good. The loud waitress, I don't love her though."}
