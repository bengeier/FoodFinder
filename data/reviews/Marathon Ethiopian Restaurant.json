{"text":"Marathon ticks many of the boxes for a Calgarian on the lookout for an Ethiopian food experience: plenty of different meat and vegetarian stews available individually or as shareable platters, an abundance of injera (spongy flatbread) that makes utensils optional, a distinctive, spicy coffee ($3/person) that follows dinner, and a sparsity of service that adds - not detracts - to the pleasant laid-back atmosphere of the restaurant. And if that's all you're looking for, Marathon will not disappoint.

If you're like me, however, and expect good, African flavour for your money, I suggest you look elsewhere. The stews - I had their staple beef, chicken, lamb, and chickpea stews  - are all fairly uninteresting, many of them rich in the flavour of their tomato base and little else. If it hadn't been for the somewhat smokey lamb, I'd liken the experience to eating pasta with tomato sauce at a cheap Italian chain restaurant.  For what you are paying - e.g.: $18/person if you do the dinner combo platter - the serving sizes are quite small and though the injera is plentiful, it is too bland to eat on its own. 

It's unfortunate because there are not many options for Ethiopian/Eritrean food in the city. Perhaps the demand just isn't there. But I can't help but wonder if Marathon's lack-luster (and expensive!) execution of the genre may be partly to blame."}
{"text":"Such good food. If you haven't tried Ethiopian food, you have to come here. It is soooo good. Familiar tastes. Rich flavours. All eaten with your hands and a flat bread called ingera. You will NOT be disappointed with the taste, quality, or quantity."}
{"text":"I've eaten at Marathon twice, once several years ago when I was a bit underwhelmed, and just yesterday via takeout. We shared the vegetarian platter for 2 both times. As is standard in Ethiopian restaurants, the platter for 2 is served on one communal platter, on top of injera (Ethiopian bread) so I was curious to see what they would do for takeout. 

I was sadly disappointed. The meal came in 2 flimsy aluminum containers, with 4 dishes just slopped together. 3 of the 4 were quite runny, which would usually be sopped up by the injera underneath, but this was a real jumbled mess. It definitely was far more mixed together than the usual presentation of the food touching the next dish on top of the injera. It was hard to determine the true taste of each dish because most of the food was blended with its neighbours. The dishes either needed to be shipped in 4 separate smaller containers, or they need serving containers with dividers.

Also, each order had the same 4 items, so we did not get the wider range of dishes offered when you eat in, and there was no salad. (Generally, a lack of green salad would not be a big problem for me - I am one of those really bad vegetarians who isn't a big salad fan - but the hot pepper vinaigrette usually is delicious)

Their berbere wat was the star of the meal (as most are - hard to screw up that spice!), the yellow split peas a bit boring, the greens better than average, and the cabbage/potato/carrot dish was bland (other than the flavours of the 3 other dishes mixing in, that is). The injera was fresh, at least. Not worth my money, though, considering the way the meal was served. 

Still hoping to have great Ethiopian food in Calgary again some day; how I wish the Queen of Sheba was still open!"}
{"text":"The food is amazing! I dream about it!
Service is kind of terrible. They're not very attentive, extremely slow, but always friendly.
Food takes a long time, but it's so worth the wait. Bring snacks and toys for kids.
Still, this restaurant is one of the top ones for our 'celebration dinners'."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants in Calgary! Fantastic food and friendly service! I think it might be a family run business and is all the more charming for it.

l have been to the lunch buffet during the weekdays and also for dinner in the evenings and weekends.The lunch buffet has quite a large selection and is a nice way to try new things on the menu. I always order one of the sharing platters for dinner.

Certainly worth trying!"}
{"text":"This is my go-to when my girlfriend and I are indecisive. Hungry? Get the platter for two and you'll leave stuffed for about $38.00 

This is a great local business. Owner puts his sons to work and they're very polite and respectful. Good waiter decorum, and pretty quick service. 

This place made me love Ethiopian food."}
{"text":"A great food experience with friends! Don't expect very fast or over-the-top friendly service or you'll be disappointed but for a casual, laid back hang out with friends, it's perfect. Order the house specialty platter! Great variety, especially to try some new things. And also plan to hang out for about 2 hours.

I'll definitely return if occasion finds me with time to kill in Kensington!"}
{"text":"We shared an excellent vegetarian platter for two.  The diversity in flavours was excellent and, unlike some other Ethiopian food we've tried elsewhere, it was not too salty.  The restaurant was busy on a Saturday evening with the sun streaming through the windows - a nice atmosphere.  Service was a little slow, but due to our arrival just after several other groups.  Friendly staff.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"The platter for 2 is enough for 3 people. It gives you a taste of chicken, lamb, ground beef and a variety of grains. 
Super delicious!!"}
{"text":"Marathon is one of my favorite restaurants in the city, and by far the best Ethiopian food I have ever tasted. I work across the street and frequent their lunch buffet. For $13 you can eat your fill of some amazing tasting lentils dishes, injera, salad and even dessert. They have loads of vegan and gluten free options, as well as plenty of meat dishes for my omnivore friends. The buffet is clean, fresh and well stocked, with new items appearing all the time. 

I have been a few times for dinner as well and the vegetarian platter to share is delicious and a fun excuse to eat with your hands. Ethiopian jazz and coffee are the icing on the cake. It is also worth mentioning that Michael, the owner, is one of the nicest people I have ever met. You will never receive poor service or be left wanting."}
{"text":"The question about Marathon isn't just \"is it good\" but \"is it better than it's half priced neighbour\". As a blue nile girl myself, I'd probably say no. 

The dining room is a lot nicer, with a laid back coffee house kind of vibe. The food is about the same favour wise, but in their defense you do get more variety (but the same quantity). The service is leagues better, but the food still takes quite a while to arrive (they just make a point of apologizing).

So overall, if you're cool with a dive: go to blue nile and spend $20 on a vegan meal for two, if you want a nice date ambiance then hit up Marathon, but it will cost you (a still reasonable $40 for two)."}
{"text":"We were their for lunch buffet with wide variety of selections and good food. Friendly service and had wonderful time a group."}
{"text":"A huge plate with all sorts of different and very flavorful food...that's what I like! A family business that provides very authentic and tasty Ethiopian food.

When you walk by the place it doesn't look too inviting. The inside is very Ethiopian-looking, but I wasn't too impressed at first, to be honest. The place is a bit worn down, not necessarily the cleanest. The fish tank they have is very dirty and I couldn't see any fish....

...but then there was the food! It is very delicious, so flavorful and so different from what we usually eat, different in a good way. Get one of the combo platters and share with your friends/partner! It is a great experience and I very much recommend to try it! 

The owner is a super nice person! He will tell you all you need to know about the food and make recommendations. His wife cooks the food. Truly a family business, since 20 years now! 

They have a lunch buffet Monday to Friday from 11:30am - 2:30pm, that might be the best option to try all the different dishes. 
It is air conditioned!"}
{"text":"Food was good. 

However, this place is quite expensive.
They didnt have good selection of wine.
The service was slow."}
{"text":"Any amazing hole  in the wall in Kensington! Be prepared to enjoy an amazing meal with two utensils that you never leave home without: your hands! We started the meal with sambusas, an Ethiopian version of an empanada. There's two options, a vegetarian and a beef, served with a red sauce with a spicy kick. Usually I go for the meat, but the vegetarian blows the beef out of the water! You gotta try it, especially if you enjoy spicy and savory. For the main course, we had the combination platter. This is like getting the best items in the menu in one dish. Like lamb? Awesome! Beef? Cool. Chicken, go for it. Not feeling the meats? There's just as many vegetarian options on the platter too. It's served with a Ethiopian bread would be what I imagine a tortilla and sourdough bread had a baby. You use it to grab whatever meat or veggies you want and chow down. Defiantly coming back to this slot again soon!"}
{"text":"The restaurant is easy to find, right on 10th in Kensington, but the door is off to one side which is great - keeps street noise and annoying breezes away from the other diners.  Upon entering the first thing I noticed was the warm colours and rich woods everywhere.  It's very inviting and cozy.  Our group was seated, conveniently, at a series of tables stretching the length of the middle of the main dining area.

We looked at menus for fun, just to see what kind of food they had, though the dinner was pre-planned.  There's a great description of the restaurant, some of the ingredients they use, and how they came inside the front of the menu - they use spices I'd never even heard of which was exciting!  I tried the Pinot Grigio which was light and crisp, great for the hot day outside and the first round brought out was a series of plates with puff pastry triangles and little bowls of hot sauce.  The triangles, which look like samosas, are filled with a delicious lentil mixture for the vegetarian ones (we didn't have the beef ones).  They're great with the hot sauce which sneaks up on you a little but is so flavourful with great spices and a little smokiness.  We each had one and I split an extra with Derek they were so good.

By this point everyone was pretty comfortable and the conversation was getting lively.  The platters brought out were huge for the main course!  There was the giant puffy bread circle, loaded with mounds of Cabbage/carrot (delicious!!), lentils, split peas, lamb, ground beef, and chicken.  There were several rounds of rolls of extra bread brought for us to eat with, and steaming-hot bowls of rosemary beef and mushrooms (I passed on those ones but the beef was delicious).  The food was so good we all stuffed ourselves silly and then had to take leftovers home.  The last time I had Ethiopian I left starving...this time I was satisfyingly over-full.

You can tell they cook from the heart, and I can't wait to eat there again!"}
{"text":"Was here last night as part of a Yelp event.  We all left absolutely stuffed.

The food was incredible.  The service was great.  The prices were well below what I would have expected.  I have found my new Ethiopian food home."}
{"text":"I stopped going to Marathon several years ago due to the quality of the food but decided to give it a try again tonight and have been most pleasantly surprised. The injera was really fresh and Doro wat was available and perfectly cooked.  The lentil wats were great.   I got a huge amount of food for the $20 takeout dish.    If you don't like your food mixed you may want to ask them if it is take out to put it in separate containers as they put all of the sauces and one container they tend to run together. That doesn't bother me but I could see how it might bother some people. All in all, a great experience at marathon and I will be going back frequently after this."}
{"text":"Disappointed with service. I waited one full hour for my food which I had to get takeout instead. really enjoyed their food, but this was terrible. Wish they would have communicated that it would be a longer time.."}
{"text":"Varied Ethopian food with flavours that nicely blended with each other into a subdued 'wham' feeling.

All seated on their spongy injera flatbread that's their signature tradition, we enjoyed one meat platter and tender beef-steak tibs that gave us a cross-section of flavours and textures that nailed the experience.

Out of all such places where've had such fare in Edmonton and Calgary, this is the best horn-of-Africa meal I've had!

Hard to explain the flavours, but the complimentary injira 'rolls' were great for scooping up 5 assorted stewed meat and vegetable dishes, and in the center was a crisp green salad. Please note that you are supposed to eat or take home the injira 'platter' that's part of the meal? A wonderful wee b'day feast for my daughter and I.

To celebrate the graduation of his youngest son, Michael the owner had put up a few big pots or dishes of dark luxurious stews and specialty dishes for his family convocation dinner. If you go there, ask him about those dishes and see if they are available? I will the next time...

Go try it? If you like varied ethnic foods, this will go a long way into walking you into that region's cuisine!"}
{"text":"While I was already more than impressed by the food and the fun, communal way of eating, it was a conversation I had with the owner, Michael, that turned this experience into something much more than a meal. This is what I learned:

Michaels wife and him moved from Ethiopia twenty-one years ago, and within the year they opened Marathon Ethiopian in Kensington - and they've been doing it ever since. He says the restaurant started almost as a joke - he really enjoyed his wife's meals and they'd casually kid about how they should open a restaurant. He says \"I really liked her cooking... we didn't really have anything else to go on, other than hoping that other people would like her cooking too.\" The next thing they knew, they were going for it, and Marathon Ethiopian was opened. Twenty years later, they're business and his wife is still doing the cooking. According to Michael, things have only gotten better for them. \"Calgary 20 years ago - it was tough.\" he said, remarking that people are a lot more open to trying new things now. \"Like this - this is good!\" he said, motioning toward our table.

I don't know how you could get closer to a home cooked Ethiopian meal in Calgary than this restaurant. I asked Michael about the ingredients in a hot sauce I fell in love with and he said \"it's got lots of cayenne\", a few more things and \"the other spices, I don't know if there is even an english word for them. I bring them in right from Ethiopia\" You wanna talk authenticity? Try foods made with nameless spices that aren't even available in this country!"}
{"text":"My visit to Marathon Ethiopian was my first experience trying Ethiopian food.

I visited on a Wednesday evening at 6pm, about a half hour after the restaurant opened. The restaurant had no diners, only a single person waiting for take out. Normally, this would worry me, but I understand that it is the norm to eat later in the Kensington area.

I was visiting with my husband. Given that we wanted to try several items, we ordered the meat combination plate for two. There was a bit of a wait for the food, but the menu warned us that the food takes some time to prepare, so I was not bothered by the wait. Our server was prompt in bringing our drinks and letting us know that our food would be out soon.

The meat combination plate for two included a beef, lamb and chicken stew as well as two lentil stews and some veggies. More than enough Injira accompanied the stews. I found the meat stews very flavourful while the lentil stews I found a bit bland.

Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed sharing the platter and having several foods to try. By the time we left around 7pm, there were two other diners in the restaurant, so it was still quite quiet. We did have to wait for our bill to pay, so I would have preferred faster service at this point."}
{"text":"I was debating whether or not to write a review about this place as I didn't know how to word it because I didn't want to be 'mean', but since eating there a few days ago I've been having daymares about it so I felt like I should. I don't really have anything good to say about my experience except that the waiter was friendly. It was both my friend and I's first time trying Ethiopian food. I've been wanting to try it for some time and the reviews convinced me but I'm not really sure what all the good reviews are about. Disappointing.

My friend and I decided to share so we ordered a chicken dish and a vegetarian dish, one with rice and the other with injera bread. Before going there I assumed the injera was supposed to be gluten-free as it's usually made with teff flour, which it is, but here it's also mixed with rye flour. Good thing I asked the waiter ahead of time. So I only ate the rice with my meal and I don't want to speak for my friend, but he didn't seem that keen on the bread since he seemed to want more rice and still had quite a bit of bread left at the end of it. He's much nicer than I am and more tolerant though, I think. 

They waiter came out at least 10 minutes after we had ordered to tell us they were \"out\" of the first chicken dish we ordered....? The restaurant wasn't even that busy and how do you not know you don't have anymore when we ordered? Meanwhile, other people who came in after us, got their order, ate, and left before we even started eating. Sorry, I digress...anyway, the waiter suggested a different chicken dish but it had the same spices and sauce that the vegetarian dish we ordered and we wanted a different flavour to have a bit of variety especially since it was both our first time trying this type of food. Then he suggested another one on the menu that was made with beef but he said we could have it with chicken.....sooo we know they had chicken, which is why I was so perplexed as to why we couldn't have the original chicken dish we ordered. It's just made with different spices. I even asked him (nicely, I might add) after he said they didn't have the one we originally wanted if they couldn't just make it? He said no. Ok...so we went with the second one he suggested.

Well, our food finally arrived....The vegetarian dish was decent. It was a spicy chickpea stew. The \"chicken\" on the other hand is what I had the problem with and can't get out of my mind (as much as I want to). It makes me cringe when I think about it. It was very tough and hard to chew. I've never had chicken like that before, and I'm no gourmet chef but even I have never made chicken that bad. I didn't even know it was possible. The flavour was not good either. The more I've thought about it since then I'm thinking that chicken had to have been pre-made and re-heated and possibly...*gasp*...microwaved. Ick! Really, how could it have that consistency and texture? Again, ick...yuck..eww! The salad that came with it was not what I was expecting in a simple salad. I was looking forward to at least eating that as I thought it might be a nice, refreshing balance to the spice of the rest of the meal. Not the case; that too was spicy so I didn't finish eating that either.  :(

A friend once told me that you should try everything twice, just in case I guess...but I just can't...well, maybe a different Ethiopian restaurant...one that's highly recommended by someone I trust...after I erase this experience from my memory. I won't be back to Marathon anytime soon....or ever. And I won't be recommending it to anyone either.

Sorry for the long review, but I felt like I needed to explain my reason for the low rating."}
{"text":"It's a very nice restaurant, tucked away in the corner of the busy Kensington street (if you walk fast you'd miss it). The food is soooo delicious, and reasonably price (for Kinsington anyways). I and my friend got a platter for 2 and absolutely loved everything that was presented in that platter.
Lots of Vegetarian options too, and if you are into spicy hot sauce, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"My family and I tried Marathon for the first time on Fri evening 20 Nov, and we were hungry. Little did we know the traditional injera flatbread served with the stew is SO filling! Yes, the service is slow, but the wait is worth it, in my opinion. The food is flavourful and intense, whether meat or vegetarian, but thankfully for me, not to the insanely mouth-searing degree as some Thai or East Indian dishes. A downside for first-timers is that eating with your hands might be disconcerting (just as with Moroccan cuisine), but if you're the least bit adventurous, it's an experience worth trying. Just be warned that the sampler platter for two can feed three or even four adults!"}
{"text":"Food was authentic and interesting. However, took quite a while for the food to come out and it was quite expensive for what it was. We ordered beef, chicken, and two types of lentils for three adults and two kids. Food comes out in a large platter and everyone shares from it. It was surprisingly filling! We tried both their \"bread\" (a very vinegar-y wrap) and their rice that typically come with the large main course. Wrap was too vinegar-y for my taste so rice was better."}
{"text":"Lots of tastey Vegan options if you're into that- and great prices!  Super delicious!!  And that coffee- my new favorite!!"}
{"text":"This would probably be one of the best Ethiopian restaurants I have eaten at since living in Africa. The atmosphere, friendly staff and amazing food were worth the 9 hours driving. Thank you!"}
{"text":"What a fabulous little find.  I participated in my first ever Yelp Supper Club here and despite having a darn head cold I enjoyed myself immensely.  (Being a mom at home with kids all day doesn't allow me much social interaction and so hanging with grown ups is such a treat these days!)

The group that assembled decided to share some Sambusa's (vegetarian & meat) which are similar to Samosa's and very flavourful.  For our entree we shared the House Specialty Combination Platter which consisted of beef, lamb, chicken and vegetarian stews.  The platter that arrived was massive and delicious.  I also enjoyed the scooping up the food with the Injera...what a fun way to eat!!

Despite the head cold I was able to enjoy the different flavours this food had to offer.  I highly recommend coming and trying this restaurant if you want something different and unique.  It's this kind of uniqueness in our city that makes Calgary so culturally alive and fun to live in!  

It's good to be a Foodie."}
{"text":"Great food! First time eating Ethiopian for myself and girlfriend. We were very impressed. The owner was friendly and helpful in giving us an education on Ethiopian cuisine. I would say trust most of the yelpers on this one. It's worth the try, if you've never had or have a craving for this style of food. 

We ordered the combo for 2. Very happy with the quality and quantity. We left full for sure. Don't make the mistake of filling up on the bread! Overall, we have no complaints here. 

The only downside: In a pinch if you're in a rush, this might not be the place for you. The food is not served quickly. If you have time to sit, talk or at least try to relate to the person(s) you're with, then you'll be fine. I don't mind slow. I'd rather have great food than a rushed preparation and poor quality. Just some food for thought. Otherwise, I would have given these guys a full 5 stars. Heck, it's really only worth half a star off for being slow!"}
{"text":"We had a great experience at Marathon tonight. We had the sambusas to start, both beef and vegetarian and they were to die for. Crisp, packed with filling and flavour:) 

We tried three dishes and we were very pleased with our meal. Lamb, beef, ans a cold lentil dish served with injira, a thin bread you use to eat with:)

We loved the lamb the most, but the cold lentils were so fresh and flavourful! 

Do try this little gem"}
{"text":"Finger food... done a whole other way! Imagine curries and meats and veggies on top of this sourdough pancake thing used to scoop it up. And so much food you'll have trouble finishing it.

We ordered the platter for four. The food isn't all that spicy, but is flavourful. It came out on this huge plate for us to share (they'll do individual plates if you're weird about eating from the same big one) with extra injera on the side (the sourdough pancake stuff). $18 a person. I'm imagining the IKEA commercial with the lady running down the road yelling, \"Start the car!\" It's a steal. There was still some food left to take home. 

Marathon's easy to spot if you're looking for it, but also easy to walk right by if you aren't. The door's kind of tucked away to the side. If you've never had Ethiopian food, Marathon is a good choice to experience it."}
{"text":"The Marathon Ethiopian Restaurant located in Kensington area of Calgary, offers the exotic and spicy flavours of Ethiopian cuisine. The food is served in the traditional Ethiopian way, food consists of dozens of exotic pastes served on flat round bread, which also serves as your plate!  These pastes are spicy combinations of lamb, beef, chicken, lima beans and vegetable mixes. There are full vegetarian combinations available as well. Meals are generally communal affairs, with up to four people eating off of one large round-bread, Jackie this does not mean you role it up like a burrito...wrong country.  The decor is a simple, basic with African travel posters. This spot specializes in traditional vegetarian, beef, lamb and chicken Ethiopian dishes served with iujeia: a flatbread made from African tef flour.  Oh and just like the name says...it's a marathon...the service as I have come to learn is very slooooooooooow, and seems to be universally so.  Good service...just sloooooooow..so don't forget to stay hydrated during your wait, and definitely don't go hungry."}
{"text":"Like most people who come here, it was my first time ever eating Ethiopian food! The bread - Injera - is a very fluffy pancake that tastes like sourdough. Of the four vegetable curry/dish things I got in the combo my favourites were the split peas and red lentils. The green lentil dish was cold, which I wasn't expecting and wasn't the best in my opinion (although still relatively tasty!). I would say overall it's not very similar to Indian food (the closest comparison I can make); it's generally more sour (I think?) in flavour profile. It's fun eating with the Injera too! Overall, Marathon is definitely worth checking out!"}
{"text":"Let me begin by saying that this restaurant is without a doubt one of my favourites in Calgary.  Anyone looking for something \"different\" in terms of ethnic cuisine will no doubt appreciate Marathon's unique Eithiopian fare.

Though I have never actually ordered individual dishes, the combination platters are without a doubt the best choice, as you get to share several dishes with your friends.  These tasty platters are served on HUGE traditional trays and are accompanied with a side of injera (a fun and spongy sourdough flatbread) with which you then proceed to eat with your hands.  It's a messy affair, which means it's as much entertaining as it is delicious.  A platter for two could easily feed 3-4 people...and then some!

That being said, don't go to Marathon if you are hungry.  Instead, go EXPECTING to be hungry, as the restaurant's unapologetic and almost painfully slow service will have you practically dying for a crumb by the time you get it.  Order a Ethiopian coffee or an aromatic tea while you wait for the inevitable feast to come your way.

VERDICT: Always tasty, but with slow service and a pricey menu (though comparable with other Calgary restaurants).  A great place to go on a first date, as you will have plenty of time to get to know one another, without all the pretense of fancy things...like cutlery."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in Calgary, with great value for the flavor and the sheer volume.  For around $20 a day, you can enjoy a wonderful ethiopian meal.  Service is a bit slow however, but it's well worth the wait."}
{"text":"The food here is good and is inexpensive.  That's about it.

The service is slow and it's hard to get anyone's attention.  One time we waited 15 minutes to even see a server in the dining room.  We hovered around the kitchen entrance to get someone's attention but no one was there.  Finally someone saw us looking into the kitchen and they said they'd get to us.  Then we proceeded to wait another 10 minutes.

Not acceptable."}
{"text":"The best Ethiopian food in Calgary. A wonderful selection for meat and veggie lovers. Expect to wait 45 minutes for your food. This is not fast food."}
{"text":"While visiting Calgary, I went with a Yelp recommendation.  So glad I did.  What a great dinning experience.  What impressed me the most, was the waiters attention.  He carefully explained all dishes, and the complex flavors of all the spices used in the dishes.  His picks were great.  We tried the Sambusa, delightful.  Try the Yetimatim Fitfit.  Outstanding. We tried the Combo platter for 2 and brought home the left overs. All in all I highly recommend!  Loved the service, the food and overall experience!"}
