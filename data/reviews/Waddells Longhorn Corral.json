{"text":"I've eaten here numerous times and the only thing I could honestly say I liked, was their pizza. Their pizza, although outrageous in price ($20+ for a large), was worth it because it was phenomenal. 
Unfortunately, we just grabbed a pizza to go and it was probably the worst I've EVER had. Not sure why they would change it but it was inedible. If I wasn't already in my pajamas, I'd actually return it and ask for a refund! The cheese wasn't mozzarella. It was white slime and so thick... and hardly NO sauce at all. 
We're so frustrated and disappointed. 
Why on earth would you change your awesome pizza????? The ONLY thing that was decent on your over priced menu?"}
{"text":"Love this place. Go here every weekend.  Always see someone I know. The bartenders are friendly and tend to every need or want.  Food is good. Pricey but good. They have a huge selection of drinks. They always have a events. Kareoke is fun. The patio is the best part of the weekend. The patio is where the party is at :)"}
{"text":"Visited on a Saturday evening around 6PM.  Great service, prompt, friendly.  You could have a conversation,  without shouting.
I think the food is overpriced.  The NY strip steak was  $32, about 1/2 thick, possibly 10 oz.  It was tender, cooked pretty close to medium rare  (hard to cook a thin steak medium rare).  The beans were the best I have had in quite a while.
Waddell's is clean, does not smell of old beer, is well lite.
I probably will return, there are  not many non chain restaurants in Buckeye or Goodyear, & I try to support the small business owners."}
{"text":"This has always been a great bar. Sometimes they work through some kinks and changes but they always come through shining ( can't wait to play drunk volleyball and 2x4 jenga)  This place is seriously a gem in the dessert. The food is always good, the beer is always cold and the people you meet are always interesting. The bartenders are great ( especially Alyssa) , the security staff are respectful. And the Karaoke is always frequent and lively.  So, come on down and find me at the bar or singing Karaoke. :) Don't be afraid to say hello."}
{"text":"Food is bad. Customer service is worse. Management felt our experience was no different than any other customer. My wife and I drove 30 minutes to try this place and it turned out to be a waste of money and time."}
{"text":"Another very good country dive bar close to home.  They have very good food for a bar and live music.  They also have poker night on Monday and Wednesday that I'm sure I will be checking out."}
{"text":"Cool place!  Have lived in Goodyear for over 6 years now and never ventured west to see what was out there eats wise.  New neighbor told us about so tried it a few months ago, pretty good I'd say.  

Menu has variety, appetizers, burgers, dinners, desserts.  I'm a big fan of Pattie Melts and theirs is the best I've had.  Bacon cheeseburger great too.  Burgers come with your choice of 2 sides, fries, onion rings, potato salad, macaroni salad and cole slaw.  Roomate usually chooses fries and fries.  I like to get either fries or rings and cole slaw, which rocks, not many places do slaw well.  They actually have 2 types of fries, natural cut, made fresh and ones called beer fries that are shaped kind of like steak fries but crispier. 

The beer drinker will like the beer fridge.  Variety of bottled beer is huge.  Something for everyone.

Wide range of patrons, cowboys, bikers, Pebble Creekers, average joes.  

Friendly staff too!"}
{"text":"The older lady with short blonde hair and wear glasses is a total bitch! She was rude the whole time taking our order and only came back to the take once. Everytime I've been here she is rude to others as well.

The price for alcoholic drinks are way over priced, and it takes a long time for the food to arrive. They card everyone even if a person is clearly 60 years old, guess they got into trouble one to many times for serving alcohol to juveniles under 21. 

I understand that their theme is to be a country dive bar, but this place has turned totally red neck."}
{"text":"Great burgers, great fries, and the beer is cold. Just your country bar with nice folks . . . well for the most part.
But good food at a fair price."}
{"text":"Absolutely won't dine here again. Just now experienced a new way to over bill...have no vegetables per the menu choices and up charge you to the overly raw garlic chili as a substitute...cash in because your waitress says so....not happening again...nothing about this place is worth the trip...good job of pissing off new customers..."}
{"text":"This is home base.  Old country bar that used to be a hole-in-the-wall kinda place back in the day.  Right off the I-10 and near new neighborhoods so it's more popular now.  Good bar food but WAY OVER PRICED.  Live music on the weekends and great back patio.  People that are giving it less stars are people who don't fit in or come here for the wrong reasons.  If you want a great meal and amazing service go to an restaurant, this is a bar!"}
{"text":"Well this ranks right up there with one of the worst experiences we have ever had.  We went to Waddells last night upon my parents suggestion.  My husband wanted a steak and by the sound of it he was going to get one.  One of the specials was a 24oz ribeye.  Sounded great. Well this was all it was - sounded great.

My father ordered a cheeseburger and I ordered fish tacos ( average).  Our food came out and was completely eaten before the server even came back to apologize and let's us know my mom and husbands steaks would be up soon.  Since it had probably been a half an hour, my husband told the waitress to forget about their food.  

I am assuming that she told the manager/owner what John had said and this person then came over and argued with my husband that \"we were expecting him to eat the cost of their meals and that their food was ready!\" Well my mom finally conceded, she was hungry and the person offered a discount.   When the ultimately brought the food, the potato was so overlooked it was brown and the steak was overlooked also.

We have never been treated so poorly by a proprietor and me father still paid a bill of over a hundred dollars.  I would NEVER SUGGEST THIS ESTABLISHMENT TO ANYONE

Only good point was the server was very nice and honestly did feel awful"}
{"text":"Food is over priced $20 for a burger we walked out before we ordered . Hear its sub par and looking at other reviews not surprising.  I live around the corner would love to love this place but just No!!!"}
{"text":"The Buckeye's finest country bar :)  \"The Longhorn\" is located on Jackrabbit Trail just north of Interstate 10 (Jackrabbit Trail is about 22 miles west of the I-17 stack). The bar has a rural, rustic setting livened up on Friday and Saturday night with a live band (in a separate room). They also have a large \"backyard\" with sandpits for volleyball and port-o-potties. Probably the best bar west of the 101 for singles, although the demographics encompass all ages. The crowd is very regular though, friendly, but not terribly welcoming to newcomers.. Bottled beer is cheap, and flows freely throughout the night without much wait, and the staff is very kind. They also have shuffleboard and 2 pool tables."}
{"text":"I wish there was an option for zero stars. Terrible steaks with greasy  sides, all of which overpriced. T-bone steaks do not include the filet side so it is just essentially an overpriced NY strip with a bone. I wouldn't recommend this place to my worst enemy."}
{"text":"I was told the regulars don't take to kindly to newcomers, and it was kind of obvious with the looks we were getting.  I really wish I could give it a higher star rating, but honestly, I don't think the regulars would welcome that.  It's one of those places they want to keep for themselves.  I'll Respect That.

My friends that have been to this bar more that once, despite the unwelcoming regulars, admit to riff raff hanging out there that are not regulars. Fights happen often.

On my first, and more than likely last visit, I saw a guy vomit on the floor near the pool tables. A \"working girl\" approached me at the bar (scary).

They did have horseshoes and tables out back & Karaoke on the back patio.  It could be a nice place, if only the atmosphere was more welcoming."}
{"text":"My friends and I gather here for karaoke and drinking. It's a very relaxed comfortable atmosphere. They water down their booze a bit and the drinks are a bit overpriced for what they give. They did have ice water in cooler pitchers at the bar for self service. That was great. The ambience is fun and relaxed. You don't feel crowded. The regulars are nice and welcoming. 

I haven't tried the food other than some fries the other night. It was $4.50 for a side of fries. It was a non seasoned sliced potato fries no salt. I had to chase down salt and ketchup from the bar. 

It's not the best but it's not the worse for food and drinks. It is however fun and relaxed atmosphere. Don't go there already hungry and thirsty... lol."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a bar with loud country music, this place is it. However, the food is meh and the waitresses are so freaking rude! Omg. As for the drinks, they meter them, so you get exactly one shot... No over-pouring here... Which makes it hard to tip the bartender above and beyond. I'd come here for drink specials but otherwise, skip."}
{"text":"We have a hiking group that has 15-20 people on Thursdays that this place can accommodate . One of the hikers recommended this place. If your not aware of the menu before you enter your in for some sticker shock. The price for a bison burger (half pounder) with 2 sides is $19 bucko's. If you use a credit card there is a $2 surcharge.
The food was tasty and for the high price the portion size (a whole lot) made some justification. 
For a sports/ dive bar, the place was the cleanest one I've ever been to. 
If I'm jonesin for a buffalo burger once in a while I might go back."}
{"text":"We do love Longhorn's but they never seem to have local AZ sports, so they get 3 stars. Would be so AWESOME if we could hang a while because the beer is cold and the food is yummy. I love their wings and steaks. And the outside Tiki Hut is our fav place to hang."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful meal here! The NY steak was amazing, cooked and seasoned perfectly. Also had the loaded baked potato  & onion rings were awesome. Great atmosphere, super friendly staff and just an all around great place!
When in AZ a place to visit!!!"}
{"text":"First and foremost, this place is literally in B.U.F.U, Egypt... Only one long, dark and dusty road leads to the isolated entrance of this bar, way off the beaten path.

I honestly didn't know what to expect when my friends and I rolled up, but I think overall, I was pleasantly surprised. (Even though the decor both inside and out was decent, it still was less than enticing as other dives that i've had both the pleasure and misfortune of visiting.) 

Inside, there are a number of pool tables and places to sit and grab a drink. Two well-stocked bar areas, in fact. To my delight, there is a nice and cozy area for live entertainment and dancing as well. (This is where I spent the majority of my time.)

 Drink / food prices and service are equally standard.  That is to say, neither great nor horrible. According to the flyers throughout the bar, there is also karaoke in the back patio area on Friday and Saturday nights. I didn't venture outside so I can't really speak on the awesome or lack there of in that department.

All in all, I wasn't overtly disappointed. And though Waddell's is not my top or first choice of places to grab a drink and dance with strangers, I don't have any REAL objections to not come back.  It's clean, it's affordable, and I had a damn good time with the company I was in."}
{"text":"Rudest manager. I waited over an hour and twenty minutes for food and when it finally arrived, the waitress took 25 more minutes to bring me ranch and never brought me a drink. My husband had to go to the front to get a glass of water because I was so thirsty. I could not eat more than a quarter of the food because I was so dehydrated, and so I went to talk to the manager at the front. She was rude enough to reply that I should've still eaten the food, and she argued with me about why I should still pay the bill of $45.

I went home hungry and thirsty - and spent yet another hour waiting for my final bill. The manager would not comp my food and made us all wait yet even longer.

What a waste of three hours.

I grew up in Buckeye and went to this place all the time with family and friends. You will never see me here again, and I will be letting my friends know as well."}
{"text":"Been coming here for years, since before it became \"civilized\". Love this place!  The food is greasy but delicious and lots of it.  They have a decent selection of beer,  albeit, bottles in a standing cooler - not behind the bar.  The crowd is jovial and I did not feel like an outsider like I did a few years ago when I first started coming here.  

The help is polite and fun loving but hit or miss depending on who is working.  Its a little divy but has really become mor civilized since it's roadside biker-bar days of old.  It is a full bar so kids are no longer allowed.  There is a live band on certain nights and karaoke too if you're into that.  You'll have to call for the schedule.  Anyhow, It's a great old school style bar with decent food and lots of rooms and open areas for big groups.  Pool tables etc.  

I think I even saw horse shoes being thrown in back.  Bring friends and enjoy.  I'd give higher marks but I believe the food is too pricy for what it is.  Typical bar food served at over priced foo-foo bar food prices.  Definitely great if you just want to relax and cut loose."}
{"text":"I have given this place a couple opportunities to prove itself. The building and set up have so much potential. The food is way over priced for a dive country bar. I've happy hours and it is like pulling teeth to find out what happy hour specials they have. Then at the end she didn't even take off the happy hour discount."}
{"text":"The food is good, the portions are big since the prices are a tad higher than most sports bars. The establishment is very clean, modern, and has friendly staff. Lots of TVs, off-track betting, and plenty of room to sit. I only go here when I am out this direction for work, otherwise it is way the f*** out of town. If this bar was in a major Phoenix city, I would come here more often."}
{"text":"Husband: Frustrated! Not one to be negative, but for the life of me, I don't understand today's business owners. Where do they fine their employees. It's our first time visiting. We express that to our waitress. Drinks arrive, but the soda in our \"Jack and cokes\" are flat. My wife takes the drinks to the bar, but is basically told we're SOL. Wife brings the drinks back to the table. SOL? Really? Glad that we haven't ordered dinner. Pay for drinks and leave the premises. Wife:let me clarify SOL. I took our drinks to bar because our waitress was too busy chatting on the phone to check back with us. The cute little bartender acknowledged me right away. When I explained the problem with soda she smiled and said  I'm. ( insert someone's name that I didn't get) so I then said. So you're saying I'm SOL ?  She said yes and smiled.  It's then I went back to our table and we chose to leave. Now let me explain further. You may not give a crap but I went back to bar told the young lady here is 11 dollars 10 for the drinks and  $1 for service. Please I said do your self a favor. The next time a  guest asks you  \"am I SOL? \" say no let me get a manager and let's fix this. She was polite and agreed. After 30 years in the business I know it's not her fault. Shame on you Waddels.   If you are gonna charge LA County California prices. Your servers and bartenders should be able to handle their job. Wanted to make this a favorite place but I don't think we will be back. And the sad part is you probably won't care"}
{"text":"It's a fun place to drink with friends. Great music! But they are short staffed on the weekends, had to get up from the table and order at the bar. The wait staff are rude... No smile, no thank you."}
{"text":"Service was extremely slow and it was not busy at all-about half full.  The server never smiled.  I ordered a bison burger, medium, with the green chile.  I had the sides of beans and fried onion rings.
The burger was overdone and had no seasoning. It was very, very dry.  I did not order cheese, but it came out with nasty yellow cheese.  The burger was cold as was the bun.   The onion rings were greasy with old grease and bland, no seasoning at all.  The beans were ice cold.
Two sandwiches, one iced tea, one water-$32.00.  That is insane.  
The music and ambiance were good."}
{"text":"I've had plenty of drinks at Waddell's Longhorn Corral over the last several years. But I've never been in the area at the right time to enjoy lunch. Until today. After celebrating my girlfriends birthday with a trip to a nearby shooting range, she chose the Longhorn (as we refer to it) for lunch.

I'm not sure I've ever eaten anything here before. Neither had I been given any expectations from others who have dined at the Longhorn. Regardless, when I saw the menu, I was shocked by the prices in general. There isn't a burger to be had for less than $11. I crossed my fingers and hoped for the best.

The portions are generous. That's a plus. My lunch included two sides. The onion rings were good, but not the best. I really enjoyed the baked beans though! And my burger was pretty good and I barely ate it all. There are other options on the burger list that justify the prices. Bison burgers are just one example.

The atmosphere was familiar, so it didn't strike me as relevant to this review. It's typical western-themed Arizona rustic with a hint of NASCAR. So if that's not your thing, it may not be worth your drive.

The reason I gave four stars was primarily on the strength of Becky's amazing service. She didn't panic when our party of ten sat down, got our drinks quickly, and made sure everything came out in a timely fashion. No one complained about needing anything during our meal, and we all had a great time. Thanks Longhorn!"}
{"text":"So I wasn't expecting much to be honest, it is a good old country bar. Live music, dance floor and a back outside bar and horseshoes, etc. I had heard the food was good. 

Even though I wasn't expecting much I was sorely disappointed. 

The food is way overpriced. All burgers are $11.99. Nothing special and definitely not worth $11.99. 

All their 6\" subs are $12.99. Yes, $12.99 for a 6\" sub at a dive bar in middle of no where. I was shocked how overpriced they are but figured it must be really good. 

Nope. The food is not good. Worse it is really bad. I got the Philly Cheese and it was horrible. The meat was grisly, tough, dry and had almost no flavor. The fries were so greasy and I got the beer fries because the waitress told me how greasy the normal fries were ... I can't even imagine how bad they are.

I can't believe they think they can charge $12.99 for this sandwich. The Philly Cheese at Subway is way better and that isn't saying much. 

The owners need to get a clue to food quality and pricing. 

If you just want to go dance and drink that is about all this place is good for and even that is just mediocre because it is so warm inside your beer last about 10 'minutes before it is warm. 

The TVs are a joke, too. They have them everywhere and are really nice big screen LCDs or plasmas yet they are feeding analog to everything so every channel looks like garbage. Why don't people understand that if you are going to feed a crappy signal into a TV you might as well keep the old crappy TVs. They have Dish at this location and for some ridiculous reason they aren't paying for HD. WTF?

I would probably never go there again unless dragged there for another party ... Which is how I ended up here first."}
{"text":"Would give this place zero stars if I could. Service is horrible and the greasy discussing food is way over priced. The best thing that could happen to this place is to get a new owner. Since the owner now thinks it's cool to walk threw the bar smoking cigarettes."}
{"text":"My family and I have been going to Waddells Longhorns Corral for more years than I can count. It is such a fun place with a niche for everyone and their unique tastes in what they enjoy. We haven't been in a while cause of different reasons like affording to go out. To my surprise my mouth hit the floor as to the price increases! I wanted to get a Turkey Club sandwich and I about shit myself when the menu showed it was $16.00!!!! The pricing changes that are straight up gouging is uncalled for! My husband works in food distribution and said that the prices they are charging is just plain gouging! I love coming there but my LARGE family of about 20 of us come pretty regularly will not be back until the owner comes to his senses on making his prices more accurate. I definitely expect to pay more for food at a bar but his food is priced like it's a 4 or 5 star restaurant and that's just not the case. If anyone would like me to post what he pays for certain foods please let me know and I can post them here. I really hope that the owner brings his prices down to reasonable prices, if he doesn't he could end up losing a lot of customers which could cost him his business. I hope he reads this and takes this into account. And BTW when a 6oz pork chop cost $30.00 I was flabbergasted. Eric please take this to heart. My husband works for a food service distributor and maybe you could talk to him about maybe getting better prices so you could bring your prices down. It's worth a shot cause we really love your establishment and really would hate to stop going to our favorite place to have fun with our family and the other great people we meet there. I hope you read this and appreciate where I'm coming from. 
Thank you,
Holly Mester"}
{"text":"Great local spot. Stopped in this morning for a late breakfast and it was fantastic! I ordered biscuits n gravy, scrambled egg and country potatoes. Large portion that was delicious. Oh, bonus, order a beer, play a round of pool with your breakfast"}
{"text":"Nasty food. If you just want to go play pool and have beer, this is an ok place. But do not order any food."}
{"text":"Last night (on a Wednesday) we stopped for a cocktail and a salad...it was \"happy hour\". The place is cool from a layout and side of the road dive bar vibe, but get ready for an expensive visit!! I got a chef's salad ($16) and while it looks big on the plate, it's primarily lettuce...which is fine if it were $8-$9 or even $10...but $16?!  Drinks were $1.00 off for happy hour, which are originally $7.00!! But were $6.00 for about a 6oz drink with a regulated pour of 1oz.  (So weak to say the least)  now I get it, they have to make money... but $7 for a tiny glass of vodka/soda in Waddell, AZ?!  
For two of us, 2 salads and 2 drinks each..$64 + tip. If you're having trouble with the math...it's because there is a $4.00 convenience fee added to the bill for using our debit cards!! What? 
For $70 we could've had an amazing steak dinner somewhere. The only reason I'm giving it two stars is the waitress was sweet and the place was cool from a vibe perspective. But, fool me once, shame on you....fool me twice, shame on me. We won't be back."}
{"text":"This place had a dividing wall... one side pool tables and darts... and the dinning area (for normal restaurant hours) and the other side was a full bar with a dance floor.... 

Well wall no more! 

This place is one huge wide open room... its much more spacious and as always lots of seating and tables... it awesome.... 

Outside they have built more to their outdoor bar... laid down more cement for a larger patio.... its a little too cold to be hanging outside for too long.. but once summer hits its going to be the main floor... guaranteed!! 

The bathrooms are clean as always... be careful, the hot water is extremely hot... right away .... ouch... 

The staff is friendly and fun as always.... :) 

Cant wait to get another chance to come back out for a visit! :)

Oh and Kareoke is on Thursdays...."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I live in buckeye and have been looking for a place we can shoot pool. After finding this place on Google we checked it out on a Tuesday night. Not too busy, bartender Sean came over right away, great service from him. Only 2 pool tables inside but out back had TONS of pool tables, a horshoe pit and 3 bars (which were closed). Generally liked the place and especially the decor. Didn't try the food but we will def be back on a weekend as we hear that's when the party is!"}
{"text":"I was recently in the area and decided to give the place another try, because It locally owned. I had a much better experience. The new staff there was great. Very pleasant. Did not seem as conservative as before. I would go back again."}
{"text":"Been to the Longhorn Corral a few times. Each time I think to myself, this is a fun place, need to come back sooner next time. While it is out of town per se, its worth the effort to get there, especially if you are a west side resident. The drinks are reasonable, and while I havent eaten there myself, the food looks delish. And the STEAKS.. my word, they are HUGE. 

The live bands are good and the people watching is fun. Mr C just had his first experience there and he enjoyed it too. 

For a fun night out, give this place a try.."}
{"text":"Everythings over priced,rude staff,this owner needs to step aside and get new career, like picking up beer cans along the hyway. Not sure how long he has owned this place but in four years and four trys.....I'm done with this country bar."}
{"text":"I have never actually had to ask a waitress before if the bartender remembered to put alcohol in my drink. Apparently he did, all of one shot in a pint glass full of mixer, which is all management allows she tells me. Weak sauce. 

Hamburgers were good but took forever to get there. Could be that I was just over the place after getting such a horrible drink. 

Also, they did change. Strictly enforcing over 21. This includes id'ing the guy who was clearly in his 50's and was incredulous that they would ask. 

Overall I think I am mostly upset because I had such high expectations for a fun, cheap dive bar. Expectations that were smashed to a thousand bits."}
{"text":"I've been going to Longhorn's off and on for years. Now, we venture out to Longhorn's occasionally when Roman's doesn't have anything going on. The service is GREAT, though I feel the food prices are a bit high for lunch. The quality of the food is always good and the staff are friendly. I do wish they'd bring back Exit 195 as the house band, but the entertainment they have now is decent."}
{"text":"Always a good time here. Great food with large portions along with affordable drinks. I'll keep coming back for as long as I live in the west valley."}
{"text":"Literally the worst place I've been to here in this part of Phoenix. Rude staff, crap food, and zero concern for their customers. If you feel like being treated like scum, go here."}
{"text":"Decided to try the place out after reading about it.  Food was terrible.  $16 for a burger, only worth about $8, if that.  Fried pickles were like none I ever had before and tasted terrible.  The only good thing was the beer was cold.  Would not go back to order food again.

Update to comment below:  we did not complain about food while there because it was our first visit and it appeared that the food was properly prepared but the bison burger was a single patty that was extremely thin and was not near the quality that the price would dictate.  All menu items were very high priced.  The comment on the other place was made months prior to ever visiting your location so it had nothing to do with being a coincidence.  However since you brought it up, we have since tried the new location and they will kick your butt."}
{"text":"So much fun! Great little road trip stop! :) pool tables, line dancing, and two stepping 6:30 till closing Thursday-Saturday nights! Super friendly crowd and staff"}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere, good food, huge servings, cold beer. Pretty much what I'm looking for in a place."}
{"text":"I'm going to give this place 5 stars for the simple fact we appreciated Tria.. I believe that is her name... It was loud when I asked. She was very friendly and suggestive! It's not very often you can walk into a bar and receive that kind of service! We appreciated her kindness! Wished she had been on the side with the live band so we didn't have to go back and forth! Although, she was worth it!!!"}
{"text":"The waitress was the only good thing about this place. $200 for 4 people with 6 drinks and one beer. The food was not good. The ribeye steak is better at a Sizzler. $23 dollars for fried chicken they called broasted. Very disappointed.  I will never eat there again."}
{"text":"Cleanest eating establishment I've ever seen. Always served more food than we can eat and have a meal for the next day. Food is delicious. They've just redone the decor and it's amazing. Smoking only outdoors so you don't ever smell like smoke coming home. That's a big deal to us. Mostly go for lunch or supper but hear they also have great entertainment. Will have to try out the line dance lessons sometime."}
{"text":"Over priced!  It's happy hour and appetizers are $2 off the regular prices ranging from $15 for Nachos Supreme to $8 for tater tots. Ridiculous."}
{"text":"The antipasta salad is big enough to feed two people.  Good."}
{"text":"So decided to go out for dinner with the wife and neighbors on a Wednesday afternoon. I've been here before but not to eat. I decided to try the Nevada burger. Good choice! The wife decided on the mushroom Swiss ! We were both very satisfied. 
The ambiance is what you expect for a cowboy bar/country western saloon. I liked it. Got a chance to get a look out back where they have an awesome set up with pool tables,video games horseshoe pits and on certain nights karaoke .The service was above average.  
Overall I'm coming back.Can't wait to try the 16oz Ribeye and the rack of ribs."}
{"text":"We stopped in here when they opened on a Sunday to have some Bloody Mary's and a bite to eat. They have done a lot of work remodeling and the place looks better than it used to. There is a ton of space outside and multiple bars to choose from. Our waitress on this day was super friendly and efficient. The food is way over-priced though. ($13 for a breakfast burrito is RIDICULOUS.) The food itself though is pretty decent on the whole. I made a mistake and ordered chili which was obviously not up to temperature yet, but they heated it up and it was tasty and freshly made. It just needed time to simmer and get that deliciousness all married together. The $2 charge to use a card (every time they run it) is dumb as hell, but there you go. They do warn you about it. They also have ATMs which also have a nice fee to use. Do yourself a favor, and get cash before you go. $2 on a $60 tab doesn't mean much, but if you change locations (inside vs outside), they close your tab, and there goes another $2. They do have NASCAR specials and it is a fun place to hang out, just be prepared to spend some moola."}

It doesn't matter that people have been sitting in the bar since 8 o'clock waiting for karaoke to start. I vowed the last time I was here I wouldn't be back and I should have stuck with that. It's even worse this go 'round."}
{"text":"Oh so close . . . We try Weddell's every year and it seems they take a step forward and then two steps back. Previously I mentioned the terrible staff. I'm pleased to report that our waitress was friendly and efficient. But, also previously I mentioned the great burgers, not this time. WHY no toasted bun? Here's a decent piece of meat topped nicely with mushrooms and cheese and it's slapped on a cold, right out of the Rainbo bread package! Results: a soggy mess. Also, this joint makes fresh cut REAL potato French fries that look delicious, but were also soggy. French Fry 101: Fry them once, then drain and drop into the fryer a second time and voilà, crispy fries."}
{"text":"Live country music and a lively atmosphere.  Menu and drinks very pricey compared to other restaurants in the area.  Quite a varied crowd, from 20 somethings to Octogenarians.  No credit cards after 9pm.  Packed on Friday and Saturday night."}
{"text":"Have not been here in a while so took a friend to dinner this week the service was very good but they raised there priced and have much smaller portions  there cheese burgers are over 12 dollars now and this place is not some high class spot for what they charge.  I like this place but way over priced anymore for what you get.  Plus when we went in there might of been 8 other people  I was shocked no one was there"}
