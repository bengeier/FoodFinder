{"text":"Wowww just when I think of food, the only thing comes in my mind is Fairmount grill their food is mouth watering...very well cooked so nicely made chicken and beef so tender worth eating 5 star food quality..."}
{"text":"I tried their Fairmont Grill Special and it was the most amazing Kebob I have ever had!!! The beef they used was tenderloin it just melts in my mouth. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"The food is really good, the meat is tasty and the sides are really great. The people there are amazing and really attentive. If you like to smoke hookah you can do so and they have a variety of flavors. They open until midnight and is really cosy place to be."}
{"text":"Went here on St. Patrick's day so I knows it's busy.  However, I asked for a Falafel wrap with no dairy and the person who took my order and made my food asked \"what is dairy\"?   A little scary for someone who can't eat anything dairy.   The falafel was subpar.  They have vegan and vegetarian options on the menu however they do not clean their work surface after preparing meat.   Be concerned about cross contamination.  Not a clean restaurant in my experience tonight."}
{"text":"We came here after some drinks across the street and were so happy we did! The food was very good! Tasted fresh even at 1am, and the portion was large. We also had a hookah at the table. Definitely don't pass on this place!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant, excellent food, super friendly staff. Eat here you'll be impressed."}
{"text":"Amazing service and amazing food !!! 100% recommend the falafel , garlic sauce!!!, hummus and shawarma."}
{"text":"Amazing place, great food. Love it!! The shawarma just drips and tastes incredible hah."}
{"text":"Best shawarma in town I swear!!! Pita has more of a crepe like consistency which I love, and the flavours are robust, but balanced as I didn't notice an overpowering presence of garlic sauce masking other ingredients (like most shawarmas in town). Superb!!"}
{"text":"My son and I went tonight and really enjoyed the food, which included vegetarian options. The owner's young teen daughter worked very hard helping out at the register and did a good job overall. The owner gave us free water and garlic potatoes to compensate for a couple of minor errors she made. We'll definitely return."}
