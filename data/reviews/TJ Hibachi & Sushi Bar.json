{"text":"im a first timer. id say this place is excellent for being in the mall! ive tried the super dragon roll 2 times, godzilla roll, and have tried their steak. ill be going back just to visit the great positive place. workers were, are, and seem very happy and the food is prepared very well. its nice to see someone take pride in what they do. i was very satisfied."}
{"text":"My wife and I liked the food here; for the price it is of fair quality, and you will likely leave satisfied. However, the customer service here is atrocious.  Between our orders being messed up, and the cook who looks so angry and unhappy you'd think his world had just ended, we will not be coming back. 

Even the manager I spoke with when we had a problem with our order didn't really seem to care.  

TLDR: decent food, fair price, terrible service & hope nothing goes wrong or chef angry face will throw a tantrum."}
{"text":"I don' understand why people give this store one or two star review.

I can sit  front sushi bar relaxing and enjoin the fresh sushi roll.I think it's good place to eat when u shopping inside the mall."}
{"text":"Worst shrimp tempera I ever had. Didn't expect awesome being a mall sushi place but damn it was bad. Rude service and serving trays were absolutely disgusting. Didn't even want to touch them."}
{"text":"We came to Great Northern mall on a whim; we happened to be in the area. While perusing the mall, we got hungry and thought \"Why not try TJ Hibachi & Sushi?\" 

The Hibachi concept is similar to Sarku/Sakkio Japanese food court fare: cuts of meat stir-fried in front of you, served with white rice and vegetables. 

Options include chicken, steak, chicken + steak and deluxe (chicken, steak + shrimp). My husband and I ordered one deluxe meal to share: it was very filling! There was a lot of food in that plate, I almost think it's designed to be shared. The chicken, steak and shrimp were all very tasty and tasted fresh. 

The deluxe meal cost $10.99 and was enough for 2 people. 

I did not order sushi, but the lady behind me did. It seemed they made her sushi order fresh because she waited quite a while for it. Not sure if this is the norm for sushi. 

Decor? It's at the front end of the Food Court. 

Service? About average. Neither friendly nor unfriendly- maybe indifferent? There are tip jars at the cash register and the food prep area. 

Overall: for Food Court fare, the deluxe combo was a great value, filling, tasty and satisfying."}
{"text":"TJ Hibachi & Sushi Bar is the latest addition to the revamped food court at Great Northern Mall.  The basic idea appears to be to offer the same chicken, beef, and shrimp (all with rice) offerings as mall-staple Sarku Japan with the addition of a sushi bar.  The store itself has an interesting setup--lots of space, a clean layout, and even a couple of chairs in front of the sushi bar.

I went with Combo A: an Eel and Avocado Roll with Hibachi Chicken on White Rice ($6.99).  The sushi was below supermarket-quality.  Have no delusions that you'll get traditional grilled eel, particularly after you see the sushi chef pop the 6 pre-cooked pieces of eel in the microwave before putting them on the roll.  The roll itself was far too light on the eel sauce, which would have been at least a decent attempt to mask how mediocre everything tasted.  Amazingly, the hibachi chicken managed to be even worse.  Low quality bits of chicken covered in a tiny bit of brown sauce, the dish managed to be utterly devoid of taste.  The only worse Japanese mall food chicken I've had was at Silver Wok in the basement of the Halle Building (but only by a shockingly small margin).  The chicken came served on top of about 2 cups of white rice.  Vegetables (which I did not get) are $1 extra.

On a whim, I also got a cup of the Miso Soup ($2.49).  This was about at mall food quality-wise, maybe straying a bit on the side of being too watery.  Ironically, the miso soup could have used some time in the microwave along with eel.

The total damage (not including intestinal and spiritual damage) with a large Diet Pepsi ($1.59) came to $11.20 including tax.  Subtracting out the Miso Soup, the one redeeming factor that TJ Hibachi & Sushi Bar may have going for it is that it is a lot of food at a relatively low price, particularly for sushi.  It might not be a bad value if you were really hungry or were willing to split the combo with a friend (preferably one who had lost his or her sense of taste).  In the end, though, this place had me yearning for mall neighbor Sarku Japan, which is a truly scary thought."}
{"text":"I only stopped to get some sushi for myself and my mom. It was a spur of the moment decision, and it wasn't the best one made. The sushi is freshly made, but it doesn't taste like anything. We kept it simple due to being in a rush to pack for a flight later in the day. So we ordered the California roll. It came with six, and they took a long time to make. I believe we waited around 10-15 minutes for our simple order to come up. Service is minimal and there was little to no interaction or charisma."}
{"text":"Very good sushi especially their specialty rolls! Loved their California roll and philly roll!"}
{"text":"The sushi itself was delicious!  The Miso soup was \"less than desirable.\"  We ended up throwing it out."}
{"text":"I stopped here for some sushi when at the mall.  Big mistake.  I had a California roll and a tuna roll.  Never again!  The seafood seemed to be at or near room temperature (not chilled),  and tasted flavorless, especially the tuna.  The quality of the tuna seemed sub-par, with too much marbling of the meat.  I've had much better sushi at various Japanese restaurants in NYC and Cleveland throughout the years.  Long story short, I threw out most of my sushi, and went to the other side of the food court to get a nice slice of greasy, foldable NY style pizza and a bowl of baked ziti.  At least I knew what I was getting with the pizza and pasta!"}
{"text":"Let's level our expectations here: it's mall sushi. That being said you would at least expect to get it quickly. That is definitely is not the case here. You can wait, get part of your order, eat all of that, then get another piece of your order and repeat the same thing for a solid 30 minutes if you order more than three things. 

The food isn't terrible but is overall unremarkable and definitely not worth the insane wait."}
