{"text":"a nice antidote to the absurdly overpriced coffee shops and yuppie emporiums eating up queen street west. honest, unpretentious, affordable, friendly. if you don't like that, there's something wrong with YOU. stick to the wine bars, or the tapas restaurants, or whatever it is that you consider good."}
{"text":"So I went here for their 16oz Burger with Fries for only $6.95. I thought I would be getting a small meal for the price but I was shocked when I saw a huge burger with a plateful of fries. It wasn't the most seasoned burger but it was still pretty good for my taste.
For the price you can't go wrong. Although eating this too many times may take a few years off your life."}
{"text":"Let me first state that I'm giving the Bellwoods Diner 3 stars and giving the girl that works there 5 stars. She's just too cute. Honestly, I'm in love. 

Alright, back to the diner, it's ok. Actually, no, it's better than ok. There are 2 things to get here. The first is the 1 lb burger and fries for only $6! It's big beyond belief. You've gotta cut it in half just to pick it up. However, other than being really big, it's nothing super special. It's a good burger, not a great burger.

The other thing to get is the clubhouse. Now, I've got a soft spot (aka my stomach) for clubhouse sandwiches but this one definitely delivers. Thick, charbroiled chicken and lots of bacon, lettuce and tomato. Good stuff. I don't think you can get it without the fries and you're not going to want to. Definitely do the gravy. Go on plumpy, you're already eating a clubhouse and fries. 

Located on Queen W, just East of Trinity Bellwoods park, this is your archetypal greasy spoon. Somehow I haven't gone here for breakfast yet but I'm sure it's greasy goodness. Of course, there's more to a greasy spoon than just the grease, there's also a fat ethnic owner/cook who is happy to make interesting \"conversation\" with you whenever you come by. And, as mentioned, there's the damsel in distress, the beautiful server paying her way through something. The Bellwood has all of this, so go check it out...just don't steal my girl."}
{"text":"To put this in perspective, I also gave The Ritz 4 stars. And I did so because you have certain expectations when you go somewhere. At Bellwood, expect the greasiest spoon you have ever eaten off of. I'm pretty sure there's even bacon grease in the coffee. It is the classic breakfast joint that is on the verge of extinction with people expecting fruit, or fresh juice, or fancy coffee or other stupid things like that. It is a classic place that makes classic food and if you don't like it, you were stupid to go there in the first place. 

We nicknamed the place \"Four Eggs\" because that's the attitude of ever plate on the menu. Nothing fancy, but an absolute ton of it. One thing I will say is that if you get the breakfast, get the fries instead of the house potatoes because they taste (and look) like slabs of soap. But otherwise, it's a fantastic treat when you want to enjoy your morning and ruin your afternoon."}
{"text":"This one has got to be a matter of personal taste, because I really like Bellwood and wish that more places like it still existed. 
Sure, it may not have trendy decor and its patrons might be mainly old men who start drinking far too early in the day, but the cheap breakfast, of moderate-quality, slightly greasy eggs, bacon, hashbrowns and toast, are exactly what you can expect from a long-lived dive catering more to the working class or down-and-out crowd than the young, arty, hip Queen West residents. 
Bellwood is comfortable. The owners joke around with the regulars, and you can sit down for a coffee, read the paper, and feel at home and invisible. 
My friend used to love ordering the frighteningly huge, super oniony Bellwood burger, but the only other menu item I've tried, other than the fries (with gravy served in a coffee mug!), is their BLT, which I always enjoyed.
But Bellwood is definitely not for everyone, and there are plenty of  joints on this strip serving higher-quality breakfasts for those with a more refined palate. Prague, a few blocks east, is a good bet."}
{"text":"Cheap n' cheerful diner on Queen West that's good for a quick meal. Chad M and I popped in on a rainy day to get out of the mucky weather. I ordered the BLT, which came on thick slices of perfectly toasted wheat bread. Though the bacon was nicely fatty and smoky, the sandwich was a little skimpy on it. But for only $6ish, I'll take it. 

Husband's grilled chicken salad was pretty good, though nothing special. The chicken was moist and freshly grilled, but the salad consisted of chopped iceberg, onions, tomatoes and cucumbers. Nice, but maybe not worth $13. 

Service was decently friendly and fairly expedient, but we were the only people in the diner. I'll probably hit Bellwood up again when I'm in the area and looking for something quick and inexpensive."}
{"text":"I went here after a particularly hard night of drinking so I needed something extra greasy to make my brain stop hurting. 

I know this is a landmark establishment and it's most certainly been around longer than I've been alive, but to be honest it wasn't my cup of tea (or coffee, of which I needed several cups). I ordered my usual dirty hangover breakfast - eggs, bacon, hashbrowns and toast. The food was good - it just wasn't quite greasy enough - the potatoes were a little hard, and the eggs were kind of bland. I guess I just wanted something swimming in grease to make me feel better. The price was right though so if you do want a quick, cheap breakfast, this place isn't so bad. Just make sure you're not still drunk."}
{"text":"If you don't mind your food to be uninspired and greasy, your beer of the flattest consistency, and prepared by a crotchety, shouting slavedriver and served by hired-for-eye-candy, usually only-moderately-skilled servers, this is the dive for you.

Sure, their burgers are the most massive in the city... but is it worth it if they're completely bland?  Sure, it's the only breakfast place between Ossington and Bathurst... but how much grease can two slices of cheapo toast soak up?  Sure, it's a Queen Street staple. But so is syphillis in Bangkok."}
{"text":"Went for karaoke the other Saturday night. It was pretty great. A fantastic book and really great staff. Most any song I looked for was there and the host was on his stuff and kept a steady flow of singers and let people up first who had not yet sung.

Much more townie than hipster which is always good for karaoke.

I'll be back."}
{"text":"I stumbled into this place recently and spying the '16oz burger made fresh every day burger', I ordered it, well you would have to wouldn't you.  Not so much a meal, more a challenge or a rite of manhood.  With cheese and bacon natch!
It was fine, but no more than that.  If they want to make it something really special out of it in more than arterial hardening terms, they should probably add a little cumin and garlic, maybe switch the cheese to a stilton and add some more interesting salady bits.  The home fries were the standard Toronto 'haven't you ever tried crispy on the outside, soft and fluffy on the inside twice fried chips, why do you insist on serving up these boring blackened flaccid potato shards' variety.  The gravy was obviously made from some granulated supermarket stuff.


It's not special, but it is very filling, the staff are friendly and on a cold evening in this part of town you could do a lot worse."}
{"text":"A greasy spoon with a bar. But at $6.95 for a 16oz burger and fries, you absolutely can't go wrong. Not a gourmet burger, but made with angus beef and prepared to order. Mine was delicious. Yeah, I've had an expensive kobe beef burger elsewhere, but this isn't what Bellwood Bar and Grill is all about. To find a flaw at this price is ridiculous. When in the mood for greasy spoon food at unbelievable prices, this is your spot. Period."}
{"text":"This was my first time in Toronto and was looking for a quick lunch on Queen West and ran into this place. I had asked a local about diners and he didn't know so I figured that Toronto was a little too high-class to have dive diners but it would appear not. 

I found the one reviewer who mentioned the slave-driver cook and how rude he was is completely true. Our waitress was foreign and didn't speak English very well but she was trying really hard but the cook was just plain mean to her, despite his apparent lack of English skills as well. The food was ya know greasy diner food and cheap so I couldn't complain. I tried to break a $10 to ride the streetcar and they looked at me and the cook just grunted something and i eventually got some change."}
{"text":"I ate their 16 oz burger. It wasn't very good, but fuck it was filling. 

The guys running the place are hilarious."}
