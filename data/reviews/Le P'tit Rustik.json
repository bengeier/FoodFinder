{"text":"Incredible bistro. Went with 3 friends for brunch and all of us had the eggs Benedict meal. The food was fantastic, in particular the potato fritters were excellent and very unique.   Also worth noting are the super friendly owners, who cook and serve the food themselves, and the reasonable price point - the $16 brunch included a soup to start, eggs bene, salad, fruit, potato fritters, and a desert at the end of the meal.  As two members of our party were vegetarian, we also greatly appreciated the chef's willingness to substitute saut√©ed peppers and tomatoes in place of the salmon!  The place is very new, and will definitely blow up, so check it out soon before they get too busy!"}
{"text":"What a fun new brunch place on the Plateau! We don't do brunch often, but I think we should.  My husband and I came around 12:30 PM on a Sunday and had to wait a while to be seated. It is a small place with one large table in the center and about 5-6 smaller tables around the edge of the restaurant. We ended up sharing the large table with another group, which was totally fine!  There were two specials that were each served with a cup of soup and a small dessert - plenty of food! I loved my egg dish containing a generous amount of feta. The best part was the unique specialty \"bognettes\" - basically fried potato donuts. They were very well flavoured and crispy!   We had a nice chat with the owners who talked about their recent opening and the area in France where bognettes come from. Great local place!"}

{"text":"I went to this place because it's next to my laundromat, and now I'm super sad to be moving away because this place is wonderful!  So I only had 15 minutes to burn before my laundry was dry, but I ended up getting a teapot of Assam!Breakfast (from Camellia Sinensis) and a brownie that was SO GOOD that I actually started writing this review halfway through eating it.   Sadly, the place was empty when I came in :( maybe because it's 4pm on a Wednesday. But this place is so charming, with soft cafe music (Macklemore in this case) and homemade, PERFECT desserts.   Okay let's go back to that brownie though  Soft, melty chocolate chunks, blanketed in a texture so smooth that it's hard to believe it's actually not entirely chocolate. The top has that perfect shiny finish, which makes me think they do something magic in the recipe, because I find it so hard to get it that shiny!  though I didn't try the savoury food, the brunch menu looks particularly appetising- benedicts with gravlax and homemade hollandaise, and french toast made with brioche, topped with honey-roast pecans and salted caramel. Wow!  I sincerely hope this place gets as busy as it deserves to be."}
{"text":"I found this little restaurant through yelp and was very happy to have discovered it. The service was really friendly and the decor is nice too. The brunch menu is short, but their vege benedictine was a nice change to the usual. It also came with a gazpacho and dessert! I really enjoyed my meal and would be happy to return in the future!"}
