{"text":"Abandon all hope ye who enter here.   The food was charred black and really quite poor. They were out of a lot of the menu items we wanted, and it was not even late in the evening.   The service was okay at best.   A fun note: They had some sort of middle eastern music videos playing where the singers danced with swords and guns and footage of marching armies flashed across the screen.   I suppose if you like rice this is the place for you. Each portion came with a pyramid of rice that could probably feed 4 people... So if you like rice and what appears to be propaganda videos this is the place for you, oh ya, and blackened chicken (with out the appropriate Cajun spice), they have that too."}
{"text":"Usually,I do not tend to judge a restaurant from one bad experience. I tried to give this place many chances but I did see any improvement. I was really happy to find about this restaurant and their special menu. I went their many times and every time I got disappointed more and more. The quality of food is constantly unstable and sometime I ordered the same dish but every time it had a different taste and when I brought that to them the owner started to give my really bad excuses. My last experience with them was when I ordered for delivery and I did not receive anything of my order right. I asked for Motabak without meat and it came full of meat and  I also asked for Mantoo dish and I received old green salad instead and when I called back it turned to be that they did not have Mantoo and they decided (without talking to me)  to give me  that green salad and CHARGE ME FOR IT !!!. I think they should learn the principles of customer service and also the principles of cocking before they think to open a restaurant."}
{"text":"The raison d'etre of opening a successful restaurant is to consistently make good, flavorful food, to act as an ambassador of exotic flavors, and to serve as a cultural bridge of sorts.  Profit is the ultimate goal, but in order for you to earn that profit, you still have to create enjoyable food.   If you don't, it's not worth the effort.    Location: Rue Bishop near Metro Guy-Concordia, near Bell Centre and Rue Ste. Catherine  It's near a show venue and a touristy downtown area with limited parking options, so you are depending on constant foot traffic from curious tourists.  Venue - It's clean and cozy, built on a converted townhouse.  Outdoor seating is available.  Service - Well, here's the story.  When me and my SO walked into the restaurant one sunny September morning two Sundays ago we noticed that there are no customers.  None whatsoever.  There were 2 men eating in the dining room...one of which is the owner (who seems to also be the waiter).  He was on the phone most of the time shouting in Arabic or French.  The menu was a binder with photos (but not the actual name of the dish in Arabic or French/English) and a piss-poor description (example: Chicken with olives and herbs), and it was mostly incomplete (a majority of the items are not available).  The owner disappeared for a long period during the service, and when we were done he insisted that we stay for coffee and dessert (I know what Arabic coffee is like.  That's not coffee, and he gave us half a baklava...each)...which took up another 15 minutes. I think he just want to keep me and my date in the restaurant so it won't look as empty.  When I offer to pay using a credit card he ran the card through the machine...and it mysteriously reported it as full (I thought those machines are not supposed to store transactions).  I paid in cash and kept an eye on that card just in case.  Food - The items on offer (Kabsa, Mandi or Mansaf) are meant to be slow-cooked/slow roasted to develop its flavor.  If you don't have a steady flow of customers the items would simply either sit there on the steam table (not good), or made with instant flavoring (just as bad).  That's exactly what it tasted like. My date ordered the chicken with onions and sumac...which was bland.  I ordered the mansaf , and it was also bland.  The owner gave us the sauces, but sauces are supposed to meant as a flavoring counterpoint.  You put ketchup in fries not because the fries are flavorless and needed to be fixed, you want it to develop other flavors.  In this case, that's the only thing I can say about the place.  Bland with flavoring added to make it more palatable.    I would like this place to succeed.  These guys are the banner carriers of the cuisine of Yemen, Jordan, Syria, Egypt and Saudi Arabia, and those flavors deserve their day in the cool Northern sun.   Unfortunately...this place left me  disappointed."}
{"text":"The taste of the food is great! The quality of rice is amazing. Service is indeed very slow.  I forgot the item i tried but it was chicken something. I thought the dish was flavorful. The ambience is super simple and the place is run by a family. I would definitely go twice for the food but not for the ambiance."}
{"text":"Food was alright, traditional middle eastern.   Service was however slow.   Ambience was alright."}
{"text":"This place has a really interesting menu that's also very reasonably priced.  Where else can you have lamb for under $15? The owner, who is also the chef is very passionate about food and tries really hard to please.  This place hasnt been open very long and they may still be ironing out some of the kinks but the food is absolutely delicious. This is authentic homestyle mediterranean/gulf area cuisine, shish taouk it is not, unique and special it is.  Give this place a shot, you'll be pleasantly surprised!"}
