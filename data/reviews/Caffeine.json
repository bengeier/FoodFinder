{"text":"What can I say? Delicious breakfast/lunch combo made on spot, reasonable price, neatly decorated ambiance. The owner is extremely friendly. It's a must-go if you're around in places like the DriveTest Centre or Visa Office."}
{"text":"I've been to this place two times now I love it.  It's hard in today's world to find people who love what they do and are friendly and outgoing like these two owners are. I've only had bagels there but after having it from there I'm never having it from anywhere else. Their bagels are made the way they should be. I also love the feel of the place because they make you feel at home."}
{"text":"I was a little hesitant to head in, since a bistro inside a convenience store isn't generally a sign of good food.  Wow was I ever wrong! I had an iced latte and a wrap, and it was beyond amazing. The owner was so extremely friendly, and you can tell they take pride in the food they serve.  I thought getting a little chocolate with my meal was such a fantastic touch too!  Shame I don't live closer or else I'd be there daily."}
{"text":"The food was really good, I was surprised that they delivered and the coffee was still hot and tasty. I also liked that their creamer was in customized little containers instead of the usual bulk creamers that most restaurants serve."}
{"text":"The owners of this establishment put their heart and soul into every aspect of this place. You can always count on friendly and easy going service. One thing that is really worth noting is how fresh everything has been each time I've been there. Almost everything on the menu is pretty healthy- a super good lunch option if you have to go back to work and you don't want to feel tired after you eat!  They are getting busier and have a limited staff (just the two owners) so if you are in a super rush try calling ahead... But always a good sign when a place is busy! I've seen a few bad comments about the d√©cor.....I think it's adorable in there.. a lot of personality... It's always good to support the local \"little guys\" and this place is much deserving."}
{"text":"To be honest, I wasn't expecting much from this cafe. The decor looks a little dated and it doesn't have the cozy vibe but as soon as I walked in, I was greeted by a guy at the counter. He was friendly, the service was quick and he was so accommodating with my orders. They had scones (I think they're homemade?) and when I bought one, I was expecting it to be mediocre however it turned out to be pretty good which was a pleasant surprise!   I'll totally come back again."}
{"text":"This charming little spot needs more reviews! If you live in East York or Scarborough, Victoria Terrace Plaza is likely your destination when hitting up Toys 'R Us or the DriveTest centre for Toronto East. Caffeine City is quietly tucked away inside a convenience store in this plaza. I didn't have high expectations judging from the outside, but was pleasantly surprised during my visit.   THE GOOD: - CC serves up food made with love. You won't find pre-made breakfast sandwiches here - I ordered a croissant with egg and cheese ($3.99), and after placing my order, the lovely lady at the counter went to the back and whipped it up from scratch. - My croissant was everything I hoped for: soft and flaky, with piping hot egg and cheese oozing out the sides. The white cheddar they used was fantastic - 5/5.  - I didn't have a chance to try anything else, but they had an impressive array of sandwiches, baked goods, bagels and more on the menu.   THE BAD: - Given that they share their space with a convenience store, it's not the type of place where you'd catch up with friends over coffee. There are two leather chairs next to the main counter, so I plunked down in one to wolf down my croissant. Think of CC as more of a grab-'n-go type of joint.   All in all, I'm really glad I stumbled upon this little gem. Don't be deterred by the unassuming sign outside - Caffeine City serves up some mean breakfast, as well as other serious eats that I can't wait to try."}
{"text":"Nice little coffee shop, pretty on the inside, with a nice owner. I just got coffee from here and it wasn't exactly the best cup of joe I've had. I usually get it black with double cream but I don't think they use that system because the guy just put the remainder of cream he had in a milk carton in my coffee, which was not a lot."}
{"text":"The wrap I had there was awesome! Will definitely stop by again when I am on that plaza. It's a coffee shop/bistro paired with a convenience store. The quality of food and service is way beyond expectations in the coffee shop!"}
{"text":"A little bit of a hidden gem, especially when you just want to sneak away for the lunch hour, and find yourself with a drink on the sofa. Service is friendly and welcoming. I would come back as it has a cozy vibe that I like and a good selection of drinks. Next time will be my third time and I will try their coffee/latte and a baked good.  Feels good to support a local cafe! :)"}
{"text":"Friendly service with good prices for breakfast and lunch and hot drinks. I appreciate the warm welcome considering this cafe is located in an area where there are line ups of irritated people waiting  for the drive test centre and visa application centre. Props to the guy for his great service. The pumpkin spice chai latte is excellent and they do have almond milk which is awesome. My boyfriend had a spicy breakfast omelette sandwich which was good. There is seating area in this cafe as well and there's a lot of artwork by local artists. They also have healthy alternatives for snacks."}
{"text":"Amazing food, love their croissant sandwiches and stuffed patties!! They have a huge variety of teas to choose from. The service here is also wonderful. If you're in the area, def stop by this cute little cafe!"}
{"text":"I had my order delivered through the Just Eat app, and had I not googled the place, I would have thought that my food must have come from some chic place at the Shops at Don Mills, not from a little place at the Victoria Terrace plaza (within a convenience store, no less!)  I used to work at an upscale bakery in Rosedale, and I have been craving a good croissant sandwich since I stopped working... And man, I got some good ones here! The minimum needed for my order was $20, and I got a hot pizza sandwich, red potato salad croissant, ham and cheese croissant, 2 Jamaican patties and an organic chai latte plus 15% tip for around $26... A TON of food. And it was GOOOOOD.   Here I am, the morning after, craving it again. Except I will drive over and check it out to avoid having to order that much food again... I don't have my sister with me today to share with."}
{"text":"Cozy little coffee shop at Victoria Park Terrance,  Caffeine is perfect name for one, surprised that it hasnt been taken sooner.  The shop has been there for a few years now according to the owner (Justin) but they been part of a convenience store for most of that. They only recently expanded to it current look. (4 weeks ago)  Despite not being a big location, it looks roomy and the various sitting like from relaxing chairs near the front to couchs and even tables if you want sit down and eat.  I didnt actually eat, I just had an americano coffee (double shot) because I needed the kick to wake me and it was really good coffee. A place I would be a regular if I was closer to area.  Props to Justin and his service too, friendly guy,  able to talk to people and well its the little things that make the experience better.  It could be best coffee in world but if people making it are meserable, you may not visit as often but this definetly wasnt the case.  You get both here, good coffee and good service,    Got to try the food someday"}
{"text":"I ordered just about everything on the menu they are very reasonable price always very quick and very fresh I love the peanut butter and banana smoothie and the potato croissant is a must! Love all the healthy options"}
{"text":"I feel horrible as a lover of coffee and knowing about this cute little place. It's so close to home I can zip out, grab an espresso and groceries, and be home before a commercial is over. Nice people who work there and the music volume is very tolerable. They seem to have various tasty looking treats that I regretfully did not grab but next time......next time....you will be mine. I will definitely come back, I like to play pool in the same plaza so it is very convenient.   A side note.... I believe it was an owner, gave me a piece of chocolate with it.  Nice touch"}
{"text":"This is a great coffee place! The owners attend you when you come in.   There is a wonderful selections of sandwiches, snacks, hot chocolate, cold drinks, cookies, and of course coffee.   There is a nice environment, comfortable couches and a great place to sit do some work or just spend time.   Overall I had a great time while here. I will be back."}
{"text":"Came here for a quick breakfast. 1 Mocha, 1 latte, 2 eggs over easy 2 sausage english muffin and an Italian croissant.  Under $20.  ...drinks ok. ...sausage (one)over done dry leathery. (Look at pic) ...egg was good ...salad taste fresh ...croissant with mozzarella cheese cold  The odd part was that other customers were served with a plate.   I want to support these small places but if it's different with ever customer and no better then a fast food joint. Sorry.  Say this quickly 10x...  Red leather, yellow leather."}
{"text":"I absolutely love everything about this hole in a wall coffee shop. I came here for a meeting but if I lived in the area, this place would definitely be my \"second home\" for where I'll do my work.  The ambience of this coffee shop is super chills and laid back. I love how there's a variety of couches and tables where you can come meet with friends or take your laptop out to do some work--they have free wifi! Prices for the food and drinks are reasonably cheap; I could totally see myself camping out here all day. The staff are super friendly and checked to make sure that my friends and I are having an enjoyable experience.   I got a bagel with cream cheese and my friend got a stuffed beef patty, which is a beef patty with lettuce, tomato, and cheese--what a way to dress up such a common snack!!  If you're in this area, you've gotta come here!! You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"It's been less than a year and what was once a tiny coffee shop sharing a space with a convenience store has blossomed into a full fledged cafe/event space.   I hosted a small, intimate event here and had them cater. Justin and Sophia were an absolute pleasure to work with. They gave us different options and worked within our group's budget.   We were allowed to move the furniture to accommodate our guests. We asked for the lights to be dimmed, we decorated the tables with candles and asked for the faux fireplace to be turned on; it was a very cozy atmosphere.  The food was delicious and the service superb. I appreciated that they treated our guests as warmly as they treat their regular customers: like old friends. Everyone in our party had an excellent time. We would not hesitate doing another event here.  Keep an eye on their Facebook page for events showcasing local artists and musicians."}
{"text":"Friendly owner.  The inferior isn't great, a bit too cluttered.  Too much like a community rec room or basement. Latte was not good at all."}
{"text":"I'm actually surprised by the positive reviews listed below. It may be the owners friends he's a nice guy.  I really wanted to like this place as it gives a chill vibe but it just didn't do it for me. The interior design doesn't make you want to stay for too long. Behind the cash the area is cluttered and messy due to that I didn't feel comfortable eating from there because of it.  The lattes we ordered were not good. I am a bit of a coffee snob and appreciate good coffee, so seeing as I can make a better latte at home I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and it's my go-to coffee place if I'm in the area.  SERVICE = AWESOME! Super friendly owner who really tries to get to know all his customers. You don't really see that kind of service anymore.  AMBIENCE = Cute welcoming decor. Good for those who want to bring their laptops and get some work done. Free wifi is good.  DRINKS = I've had a few of their lattes and specialty drinks. They're pretty decent and have some unique flavors (like Bounty Coconut Latte). Have a loyalty card with drink purchases and you also get a little chocolate with it.   FOOD = Great variety of food, unlike other coffee places that only serve pastries. They have all day breakfast, sandwiches, salads, freshly baked croissants with interesting ingredient pairings inside (like apple, honey, peanut butter, bananas, etc).   LOCATION = I wish for their sake the coffee shop was in a different location. It's in the Victoria Terrace plaza with foot traffic from a certain type of clientele that wouldn't necessarily appreciate what this establishment offers.  Spread the word and come support this coffee shop!"}
{"text":"Great relaxing atmosphere. Welcoming people behind the counter. Love the decor. Good coffee. Avocado and cucumber bagel has good flavour. Good for a casual date, chilling with friends or you just want to spend some time alone with a book or your laptop."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place while waiting for my cousin to do her G1 test. Cute little cafe with lots of comfortable seating. It's gives a quiet atmosphere, would totally chill here on a nice afternoon!  I ordered an americano and a muscle flex sandwich (chicken breast, avocado chickpea spread, roasted peppers and pesto). Americano was great! Very flavourful and smooth :) sandwich was pretty standard and a good size for lunch!   Would definitely come back if I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"Ordered 2 coffee, and two breakfast croissant sandwich for me and bf.   The croissant was very tasty but the size is tiny....so it's quite expensive for the size.  I would like to return but I probably will need to order two just for myself and it would be too expensive for breakfast :("}
{"text":"Very friendly service and staff here. Offers a nice selection of food at a reasonable price. Really a relaxing and comfortable environment to spend time. Definitely a small little gem in the area."}
