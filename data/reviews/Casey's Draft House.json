{"text":"My girl dragged me here last night while we were visiting Pittsburgh...At first I was a bit skeptical, but after 5 mins of chit chatting we had a great time...even came back after dinner.

Only downfall...stools made me feel drunk/topsy turvy...and we missed Midget night, hahaha

Inexpenisve alcohol and great bartenders make the world a much happier place!"}
{"text":"Worst place I've ever been in Pittsburgh, lived here all my life terrible staff and lots of bad attitude here don't waist your Money or time here!!!"}
{"text":"This place can be hit or miss, depending on the night. When I went in September on a Saturday night it was a miss. Drink specials were not as advertised on their website, and there was no midget. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Casey's is a pittsburgh legend. They are famous for midget madness and having incredibly cheap drinks. Always an interesting atmosphere at Casey's.  They don't offer food, but they do allow u to order out from the many neighboring restaurants."}
{"text":"Great bar on the south side to grab a quick beer.  Usually, if i plan on eating at Fatheads, i like to leave my reservation and walk next door to casey's until our table is ready.  The beer is always cold and the bartender is always cool.  I've never seen the \"little person\" but i'm told it's awesome.  This is a Must Stop."}
{"text":"Friends took us to Carson St during a visit and this was my favorite. Best bar on the street! Welcoming, reasonable prices, great selection of beer and whiskey! Was too packed and wasn't pretentious, just a cool hole in the wall bar. Came in for a drink and ended up staying most of the night!"}
{"text":"Very cheap happy hour prices. Last night it was $1.50 domestic bottles. Almost as cheap as getting drunk at home. Very nice bartender. Good time."}
{"text":"A frat bar with the novelty of a midget that pours shots.  You go in, get your shot from a little person, and leave.  This place is only ideal for the quick stop, or once you're already too intoxicated to care."}
{"text":"What a relief it is to find somewhere with a classic cheeseburger that isnt topped with a bunch of fancy/weird cheeses meats and vegetables. Far too often these days I encounter burgers that are way too \"busy\" with toppings for their own good. 

Not at Caseys. They serve a GREAT traditional style cheeseburger. Thinner yet properly sized patties that are juicy on the inside and slightly charred on the outside. American cheese, lettuce, tomato, pickles, and onion. Thats the way cheeseburgers are supposed to be cooked. The price is right too. A double cheeseburger and 3 bottles of beer and I got out of there for under 15 bucks (during happy hour). 

5 stars for the cheeseburger and 4 for the bar. Highly recommend checking this place out."}
{"text":"It's a frat bar where for $10 on Monday, a little person named \"Manboy\" (sidenote: do not google image his name on a work computer, learn from my mistakes) comes down a pole, walks on the bar in a costume, and pours shots down your throat. Nothing in your wildest dreams, could be more messed up than this. They even sell Manboy bobbleheads.

Did you notice I called him a \"little person\"? That's because I'm a sensitive person.  The rest of the peeps in here for \"midget madness\" are not. Hey, I'm only a foot taller and I gots some T Rex arms and the last thing I want to do for employment is shove a nozzle of jager down some screaming frat boys throat and pretend to enjoy that sh**.   To be honest, judging by the look on his face I think he might want to go postal and torch the place.

I could only tolerate this place for one drink. I'll give them kudos for the impressive drafts on tap, a diverse tequila selection, but I had to run out of there before they got the idea I could be \"Womengirl\" behind the bar."}
{"text":"Awesome little bar.  Great beer selection and decent prices.  Also had a cute little bartender working on a Thursday night.  She made sure my glass was never empty.  Downside is that they allow smoking."}
{"text":"Party like a rock star? Pssshhheesssh! I say party like a little person!

-2 stars for the smoking that kills the vibe. Yuck

3 stars for the nice bartenders and the fun environment!"}
{"text":"My favorite dive

Smoky and filthy, avoid

if you're on a date"}
{"text":"On the behest of a business associate, I stopped into Casey's to see \"the show\".  One thing that I'm not used to, is smoking in bars (not a Casey's thing, a Pittsburgh thing).  They stopped this in most places on the east coast years ago, and I forgot what it's like to come home smelling like an ash tray.   The real reason we came was to see what they call midget madness.  Basically a little person gets up on the bar, walking down it and pouring shots into peoples mouths.  Wrong on so many levels, but still entertaining.  Only stayed for about 45 minutes.  Not somewhere I would hang on the regular."}
{"text":"So I came in with my friends on st Patrick's day, after 6 pm. We hadn't been drinking previously and started here. The bartender, after receiving my generous tip, told my friend who had maybe a total of 2 drinks was cut off. She said if he wanted to argue it he could go \"fuck himself and leave\". Confusing because like I said, we hadn't been drinking prior to this bar. This skinny bartender with over pronounced eyebrows lol preceded to then serve the girl who was minutes before puking in the stall next to me. She was clearly more intoxicated than my sober friend and she was so rude I won't return if she is working lol"}
{"text":"on monday's, casey's has a \"little person\" that sits on a loft above the bar. 
for $10 you can buy the entire bar a shot...

when i say a shot - i mean the little person then slides down a fireman's pole onto the bar, grabs a bottle of pre-mixed shots and runs up and down the bar pouring a shots into everyone's mouths.

insensitive? sure.
demeaning? of course.
so weird you can't help but go once? absolutely."}
{"text":"Most people focus in on the \"man boy\" element of this bar because it is the most controversial. For those that think that having a little person dump shots down the throats of those at the bar entertaining you may want to show up here on one of the nights they have their famed \"midget madness.\" If you are against that sort of thing, there are plenty of times to avoid that activity.

However, as a dive bar, Casey's is one of the better ones in town. You should come here expecting cheap drinks by any other bars standards on Carson Street and outrageous specials. While we were here, I enjoyed an IPA from their extensive selection of draft beers. My girlfriend had a few of their special $1 margaritas when we visited.

Visitors should note, that this is a smoking establishment, so if you're bothered by smoke, this may not be the place for you on it's busiest nights.

Men should note that there are no \"number 2s\" in the restroom. The toilet has no seat and there is no toilet paper available in the restroom. Unless you plan on wiping by dragging your butt across the floor, which is not recommended.

Visitors should show up here expecting a \"dive bar\" experience for a cheap and very drunk time."}
{"text":"Hands down, worst service in the city of Pittsburgh. The female bartender was the rudest person I've encountered in this city, and I was shocked at how drunk she was at around 9PM. My friend bought a round of 4 beers, she kept all his change, and when he asked for a portion of it back (still leaving her more than the appropriate $1/drink) she told him to \"f&@! Off!\". Literally awful. I see that others have already complained about her behavior in their reviews, I can't believe she is still employed. I will never, ever go back. I suppose she is one of the many reasons I rarely visit the South Side. I'll stick to my own neighborhood from now on. #northsideisthebestside"}
{"text":"We stopped in here to get out of the cold for a minute. The bartender was very friendly even though he was about to do the shift change. The drink prices were reasonable and the beer was cold. He tried really hard to find the game we requested even though we figured out later it was not available on their subscription. It was a cool bar that will definitely make the list of places to stop again."}
{"text":"Only thing going for this bar is the little person that comes out and feeds people shots.  Otherwise, typical bar that allows smoking."}
{"text":"I avoid Casey's on midget nights, but go for the great happy hour. By great happy hour, I mean cheap beer at a dark smoky bar. As an added bonus, the bartender lets you know when happy hour is about to end, so you can get one last beer in at the cheap price.

The first 5 times I went here, they were playing Family Guy on all their TVs. This is a dedicated bar. 

If you're in the mood for a microbrew or import, Casey's also has a surprisingly large selection of drafts. For the thrifty conscious, you can often find an unadvertised special by looking at the hand-printed signs below the taps for the beers that they're cycling out soon. Last time I was there, they had a $3 Great Lakes draft.

Overall, go for the specials, but don't expect high-class here."}
{"text":"Great tequila bar
Upstairs, just past the midget's
Tiny little home."}
{"text":"An Irish bar that features an insane amount of tequila. 

One of the best bars on Carson. Great bartenders and Jake is great on Saturday nights. Cheap drinks and a great atmosphere. 

You should drink here."}
{"text":"This place is colossally fucked up. I'm almost ashamed to say how much I liked it when I went. But lets be honest here. Good cheap beer and spectacle that doesn't quit. Be sure to check it out on Mardi Gras. Holy eff. pure super-awesome evil."}
{"text":"Midget Madness.  Need I say more??

On Monday and Saturday nights they have a midget that goes up and down the bar pouring shots down your throat.  Several costume changes are involved.  Its maybe one of the best things I've ever seen.  They've got a great beer selection and a few TVs that we found useful for football watching.  But really, who can pay attention to a TV when you have a manboy running around?!?"}
{"text":"I only ran into this place to use the bathroom. Had to show my ID before i walked in though. Standard Procedure!

i walked in and immediately everyone stared at me like ii didn't belong there. A bunch of folks all sitting at the bar. Most of the seats were taken and it was pretty dark and crummy in their. No decorations only beer signs. i believe they had specials on beer and drinks but from the looks of the place thats all they had to offer.

When i walked into the ladies room I was immediately turned off. 
1. No lock on the bathroom door
2. Only 1 toilet
3. No door on the stall

So let me tell you how this went. I walked into the bathroom and closed the door behind me. I went to lock it after noticing that there was only one toilet in the bathroom. To the left was the sink and paper towels.  The only thing separating the toilet from the sink was a measly shower curtain hung by zip ties!! I mean really...zip ties. They couldn't even buy real shower curtain rings. When i tried to slide the curtain shut i had to move it inch by inch because it was too tightly hung. 

Seeing that there is only one toilet and the few people who saw me go inside the stall, i figured i would have my privacy but of course that didn't happen. 30 seconds into my curtain pulling. Two drunk women stumble in loud and laughing meanwhile leaving the door to the girls room open. Did i mention the bathroom is right next to the bar!! So i had to announce to them i was using the toilet, God forbid they open the curtain!!. They were laughing and taking pictures while i'm praying that they leave soon or just don't pull the curtain back. 

I've never had such a uncomfortable experience using the bathroom in my life. This is what it must feel like to be a prison inmate. No privacy, no respect and no doors!!"}
{"text":"My sister, who lives in NYC was in town for the weekend. We had dinner at Ibiza's and did a show at the City Theater.  But really, how do you impress someone who lives in the heart of Manhatten? Stop into Casey's during Midget Madness, that's how!"}
{"text":"Monday.

Midget.

Madness.

Need I say more???"}
{"text":"Listen I've been in every bar in the south side be have been drinking down here for years. I can say without a doubt that Casey's has hands down the best TP on Carson"}
