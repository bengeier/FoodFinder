{"text":"I don't recommend their \"fried noodle \"____. You will get crunchy mush in the mix. You don't even get water and they don't tell you what soup they give you. Waitresses have nothing better to do and stare while you eat. It was a weekday, not busy but 4 other people came in to dine that evening. The spring rolls taste like gasoline probably used previous oil beforehand. Seems more like a breakfast place, but I don't know if i'll even come back here. Mediocre."}
{"text":"Pretty horrible. Got fried chicken with fries and what came were 3 sad pieces of chicken and what looked like microwaved fries. They also premixed their lemon tea so you couldn't adjust the sweetness. Nothing here looks good and I regret coming here..."}
{"text":"Moderate level food and sufficient for the price. Portions seem bigger than when it was Station Asia and edibility is certainly much better. Service is just what you'd expect from a place like this, ok if they even say hi or bye to you, which they didn't.   We ordered breakfast, borscht and CLEAR fish ramen noodles. They sent 2 borsch. Of course they insisted that I had ordered it that way, except when I asked to see the paper to see if I wrote it incorrectly, they wouldn't. As in literally when I was reaching out for the paper she had in her hand she whipped it away and corrected it on the computer, which answers the question of who was incorrect.   They replaced it with a FRIED fish cutlet noodle. Sigh."}
{"text":"Worst costumer service I've ever encountered. I would not step foot in this restaurant - eat at the food court instead! When we entered the restaurant, no one greeted us or even seated us so we asked if we could sit at an empty booth and she yelled at us!!!! Mind you this is on a weekday - not busy at all. An elder also came after us and asked what food they served and he was also yelled at by the waitress!!! I am in complete shock as to how they are still running!   1 star rating is already too generous for this dump. I would give this a negative if I could!   AVOID THIS RESTAURANT."}
{"text":"Standard HK style cafe. Only came here since it was such a long line up at Sam's Congee Delight. tried the satay beef in spaghetti noodle. The soup and beef lacked in flavour. Portion was good size though."}
{"text":"Asia Station inside Market Village has just rebranded itself to a Hong Kong Style Cafe Restaurant called ABC.  Just like typical HK cafe, customer here looking for value, speed and variety.  Breakfast does have a good selection of Chinese and Western options. But for Afternoon Tea, there is only a limited menu mainly of Soup Noodle and Sandwich set from $4.99-$6.50.  Taiwanese Style Beef Stew Sliced Noodle in Soup ($5.99) has nothing really Taiwanese about it aside from the name. Beef Brisket though quite tender and plentiful. The noodle though was kind of sad as it is soft and doughy without the al dente mouth feel. Toppings of mushroom and seaweed was atypical for Taiwanese noodle.  For $5.99 it was not a bad deal as for an afternoon snack.   Customer service was meh. One of the waitress made me seat at a table in the middle with a whole trolley of dirty dish beside it. I was waiting for them to push it to the back away from the sights of customers. But after they gave me my watered down hot water/tea and menu and after she took my order, it was still right there next to me. I finally have to ask her to move it away.........  Cash only."}
