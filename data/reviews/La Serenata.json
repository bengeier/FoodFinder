{"text":"I attended a reunion at La Serenata and I found this resto is as Italian as the Olive Garden, only much more expensive. We were offered a set menu with selections that, IMHO, were non-Italian. Can anyone tell me if snow-peas and stewed carrots are truly part of Italian cuisine?  I don't think so. They had the nerve to charge an extra $5.00 for rapini because i didn't like the vegetables on the set menu. A plate of tortellini and penne that came on one plate,that's gross in it's self, with a generic bottled rose sauce.I had that replaced with a green salad but it was pretty much tasteless. Now I may be too critical but when you order a grilled fish, should it come looking microwaved and greasy?   

Never mind this resto being overpriced I could forgive them for that if the food was at least good, which it wasn't."}
{"text":"It was an okay meal. Nothing spectacular, although I did enjoy the profiteroles and the fireplace!"}
{"text":"Came here with a group of 10 after work.

The location is a bit of a putoff - in a non-descript strip mall, but the bonus is plenty of parking. Outside it is cold but inside it is warm and the staff are friendly. The décor is clean and sort of modern. I ordered from the table d'hote - the minestrone to start with and the grilled veal chop for the main. The minestrone was decent, a bit bland but the saving grace was that they don't add the pasta until ordered so it isn't mushy. The grilled veal chop was nice - very nice presentation, lightly seasoned and grilled well, but overcooked. The side vegetables were pretty ordinary (are snow peas Italian?) and the potatoes were undercooked.
The wine list is underwhelming, full of SAQ standards and a surprisingly high proportion of non-Italian wines.
Overall, an okay experience. The food is okay, the prices are a little high but not outrageous, service is good, the wine list is weak.
We came here because it was close to work, and given the choice, I will not be coming back."}
{"text":"Very nice Italian restaurant. Came here with people from work that come here regularly whenever they are in Montreal. The servers are very friendly and attentive. I had the pasta with aubergine which was really good."}
{"text":"Very authentic fine Italian cuisine close to the office!"}
{"text":"Recently visited this restaurant for the first time, and was nicely surprised on many fronts. There were four of us in our party and we wanted good food in a relaxed setting that wasn't too noisy. We arrived for our 7 pm reservation and we were promptly seated by the fireplace in a very nice carpeted room with about 16 tables. A nice respite from the high ceilinged marble floor places that are the norm these days. 

Within moments of being seated we were given some bread and ice water...and a little bowl dip with some crostini and bread sticks...love bread sticks. The menu is very traditional Italian, no surprises. They have a table d'hôtel starting around 25 and going to 40. Pretty standard Italian fare but prepared well and served with a smile.

Will return here again."}
{"text":"Very fine, authentic Italian dining.  I've had the privilege to dine here twice, both times with business colleagues here in Montreal who are regulars, and I have been impressed with the service and the food both times.  It might be a little bit hard to find if you don't know your way around the area, but if you do find it you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Almost a year ago, my husband and I celebrated our  wedding reception at La Serenata. We had the entire restaurant and it was amazing! The food was spectacular! Having eaten there before we knew the cuisine is excellent, but for a large group of 80 people the quality can change; it did not. Everyone raved that it was the best food they have had at a wedding! On top of that, the service was great. The staff worked very hard. No one waited long for anything, and they were very friendly. They were also very accommodating, organizing the restaurant so that there was  seating and room for a dancefloor. We look back at the celebration with our friends and family with very fond memories. We love this restaurant and cannot say enough good things about the owner, the staff and the food."}
{"text":"Not easy finding an authentic Italian restaurant in the West Island.  I spent 10 years working in St-Leonard and going to some of montreals best Iltalian restaurants including Da Vinci, Luca (on Dante), and many others.  I recommend La  Serenata for a good business lunch or dinner anytime."}
