{"text":"If you're looking for the best food experience, look no further! Hands down, best food in all of Cleveland! Every time family comes into town to visit, they always ask to go back to Cedarland! The owners will treat you like family. Be prepared to eat like you're going to Grandmas house! :) You won't find better hummus or dolma anywhere around!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite Mediterranean restaurants in Cleveland. I just moved here from Chicago and I heard about the restaurant near my office on Superior.  When I heard about the new location I went there for breakfast and it was to die for. The hummus and Shawarma sandwiches are one of the most authentic Mediterranean dishes i've had at both locations. The food is great and the workers are one of the most friendliest people I've met."}
{"text":"Very clean restaurant, health eating , Mediterranean cuisine is on point. Staff very friendly. They also offer a meal prep program called elite eating cle. Very creative idea I signed up my self"}
{"text":"The best, homemade food made by a warm & wonderful family. We have been coming to Cleveland for the clinic for 8 years and we always have to make at lease one stop to cedarland. They just moved and I love the new location, it's not too far from west side Market. 
Thank you again for another wonderful meal!

{"text":"Always a metro employees favorite. Awesome service. Prices are reasonable. HUMUS ROCKS."}
{"text":"I stopped in for lunch, really hoping to find a new favorite. I wasn't impressed with the food, sadly. This place has been open for a few weeks now and with no reviews on Yelp I was getting very curious. I came in at 11:30 on a week day and there was not a single person there yet. Being right next to MetroHealth, I came here for an early lunch expecting to beat a huge crowd from both patients and employees alike.  
I ordered a chicken shawarma sandwich. On the plus side, it was ready in about 3 minutes. It was a small wrap with just chicken, a few chopped lettuce pieces, a pickle, and what was supposed to be garlic sauce but it tasted more like butter to me.  The chicken was tasty and decent quality. I will give them that. But over all it was very plain and small. Wraps are in the $6 range, plates around $14. I would consider coming back to try a plate and the side dishes, but it's not high on my list. Probably would not come back for another sandwich. 

They should offer a lunch special, but I did not see any on the menu nor heard of any when I walked in. I think that would be the key to getting more customers in the store at lunch time. Take advantage of having 6,000 hungry Metro employees right next door and offer a lunch special!"}
{"text":"Really good authentic Mediterranean cuisine. Great falafel and spinach pie.
Great food 
Great service"}
{"text":"Great food and thoughtful staff. Food is from family recipes so it doesn't feel like a chain or mass produced. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Ordered a to go lunch.  Fattoush Salad with chicken was great!  Lots of toppings and chicken.   Hummus was great as well.  Extra creamy and for some reason it had a slightly sweet taste.  Not sure why but it was good.
I would skip the chicken Shish Tawook  pita next time or ask for extra garlic sauce.  Mine was kind of on the dry side and not loaded with lettuce or pickled turnips.
Might have been an off day, but the workers were not very friendly.  A little pleasantry would go a long way in repeat business.  3.5 stars rating rounded to 4 because the salad was so good."}
