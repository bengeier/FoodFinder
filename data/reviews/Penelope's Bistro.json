{"text":"This place is now called \"The Diner\".  I would frequent this place for lunch if I worked nearby. The staff was incredibly friendly and they even made me something that was not on the menu. A chicken gyro.   The food was prompt and tasty. The fries reminded me of the fries at a carnival.   I will go back to The Diner next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"The food is amazing! This woman LOVES to cook!  She does not take credit cards so be prepared."}
{"text":"Occasionally dumb luck takes you into a place that you'd otherwise overlook. That dumb luck came upon me tonight when I stumbled into Penelope's Bistro. There, I ate the best spanakopita I have ever tasted, moaned over heavenly dolmades, and nibbled gyro meat cooked to perfection.  All in an unprepossessing little building on the side of the road in Bedford.   If you go there, Penelope herself will be cooking up your food and serving you her generous helpings. She is a lovely, friendly woman who will greet you like family.   Take an appetite and go. Delicious!"}
