{"text":"Amazing Filipino place!!! Great food .truly authentic!!! The longanisa was great .. people super friendly and helpful ..we are From out of town . Staff made us feel so welcome!!!"}
{"text":"Everything ordered from AMPC has been delicious. I love the sinagang, pansit, garlic rice, etc. Each time I come in everyone is always smiling. Oh and my husband loves the lechon. Will be back for more :)"}
{"text":"Not sure about this place. Second time here, and they forgot my order again. After waiting 15 minutes, they inform me they are out of the special? Let's just say it's no Ludi's. Not even close. Service is the least you'd expect at a philipino place right? Advice on a Ludi's in the east valley? Go to Seattle I guess. The food is ok, but there's some kinks to work out."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing... it's just like my mom's home cooked meals. The people at the restaurant were very kind and welcoming. I highly recommend coming here to get delicious filipino food."}
{"text":"Look no further! I've been settling for pho and other Asian cuisine until I found this restaurant. The portions are huge and worth the price. The recipes are all authentic, with fresh ingredients and made to order. Best Kare-kare I've had in a long time! The place is also very inviting. No need to dress up, you'll feel right at home like you're visiting family. The staff are all very nice and give great service. You'll enjoy your meal every time you go, 10 stars!"}
{"text":"We were traveling back to Dallas when we came across At My Place. Service is quick. Everyone is very friendly. We ordered Sinigang, Adobo and Sisig. Everything taste authentic Filipino flavors. Don't forget to order Halo Halo for dessert. Highly recommended !"}
{"text":"Visiting from out of town. Food prepared fresh. Very tasty. Friendly service! Very clean!"}
{"text":"Ordered pansit, kare kare and bangus silog.  Everything tasted good and fresh.  Good portions and reasonable price.  Took home puto and cassava which were also delicious.    Saw others ordered sisig and lomi.  They look good so will be back soon to try them."}
{"text":"This place is definitely a gem! The food is delicious (I can't put enough emphasis on that!), authentic, fresh, and comes in generous serving. The whole restaurant is spotless, and their service is just exceptional. It really does remind of of home, where you'd go to your tita's house, and everything is delicious and everyone is just so warm and friendly. This is exactly how a Filipino restaurant should be. I can definitely tell you - don't waste your time and money going to Halo-Halo in Phoenix, where the food is stale, people are rude, and they try swindling their customers. For the record, I'm NOT a friend or family member of anyone from At My Place."}
{"text":"This restaurant is fantastic. Great food and awesome service. My favorites were the pancit and the dinuguan. The chicken and pork adobo has a really nice finish to it. Can't wait to go back and check out more of the menu. Thanks for a great meal!"}
{"text":"Durability, reliability and trust are still the values ??that make a restaurant successful. Your management style was very successful and this anniversary is a nice way to congratulate you, all your crew especially your Head Chef Kuya Doy(Nathan Erin SASON) on this achievement. Your business is now one year old, but still very dynamic. Let us go on that way. I wish all the best for the futrure of your food business restaurant and for all your employees. Great & awesome job!"}
{"text":"Food was very good and service was very friendly. We tried the pansit and sweet and sour tilapia.  Pansit had big shrimps and tilapia was fresh and it was a whole fish!  I'd recommend at my place cafe to everyone."}
{"text":"Delicious food! They serve more Philippine food and more American food. The owner came by and talked to us for a bit about the food and history. I'm glad to help support small businesses, especially when they're better than the rest!"}
{"text":"Had the pork and chicken adobo for lunch, it was really good. The workers are so friendly and will give good suggestions. Saw some other people having this ice cream dessert called halo halo which looked so good, so I had to order one. It was so good!"}
{"text":"We are on vacation from Seattle! I got really tired of eating junk food and fast food! Thanks to yelp we found My place! Walking in was just so friendly, they greet you with big smiles, and very helpful. Even the customers were giving feed back on the different type of foods we should try! My sisters and I ordered different types of food. Lisa the owner is such a beautiful person! Lisa if your reading this, thank you for such amazing hospitality.   Very friendly, clean, and food is on point. If your traveling and wants some home made food! My Place is the spot!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite Filipino joint in the valley. They just opened not too long ago and I am glad that they did. I am always in the mood for soul-satisfying Filipino dish and this place just hit the spot. The owner is super nice and sweet and reminds me so much of my mom, actually. We ordered Shanghai, which is the Filipino version of Spring Rolls and some Filipino desserts and we are left craving for some more. Will definitely be coming back in the near future. Probably after this post! Lol!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time on Monday 12-12-16. Food is really good and so was the service.  Very friendly owners. Will definitely stop by again when we're in the PHX area.  Also, some people might be taken to a housing area by google maps.  You need to keep driving straight to where Auto Zone is.   Do not turn right at the housing area.  If that makes any sense... if you do go through the housing area where the map pointer thing tells you to go to, the restaurant is behind that house lol. We thought someone was playing a dirty trick on google maps, leading people to someones house.  But again, good filipino food!  Polite service too =)"}
{"text":"The best Manok Adobo in Arizona is here and their Halo Halo is huge!! It's perfect. The only Adobo I had that was better was in the Philippines. I will make sure I post a review from the PI on my next trip over for those who are interested."}
{"text":"So far the best Filipino spot at Arizona. We would def. come back. Halo Halo, dinuguan, sinagang, and longuenza on point."}
{"text":"Superb food. A single meal consisting of laing, Bicol Express and steamed rice took me back to the days when I was still in Manila. Their servings are huge and perfect for sharing. The service is also superb. This place's owners and staff treat you like family. It won't be a surprise if we become regulars at this place. I felt at home here really quickly that I don't mind calling it \"my place\" and will definitely tell my friends to come enjoy \"At My Place\"!"}
{"text":"I highly suggest eating in this cafe/restaurant because they have of the most sumptous, most satisfying, and most delicious Filipino dishes in Arizona. Not only that, the personality of the owners and their servers are commendable.   We ate here thrice in a week!   Thanks again, At My Place!  #TripToARIZONA #LUTONGBAHAY #BestFilipinoFood"}
{"text":"I have gone here several times because I love Lumpia. I always call ahead and order on the phone and then come and pick up. However today when I called and placed my order of two when I arrived they had only made an order of one. She told me it would be only a few minutes to make another order so I decided to wait. As I was waiting my entertainment book pulled up a coupon for them. When I showed the girl ringing up my order she said no they don't have any coupons I proceeded to show her the coupon in which she told me no. Then she turned to another employee and in another language told her about a coupon and they proceeded to laugh at me. It was extremely rude I knew they were laughing at me and to deny a coupon that was clearly there is pretty crazy to me. Sadly I don't think I will be going back for the poor customer service I received today."}
{"text":"This is a total mom and pops restaurant, I LOVE IT!!! Everyone was great and friendly but most importantly the food was aaahhh oooohhhh so yummy delicious! I enjoyed every bite of it. I ordered the Kare-Kare which came with a side of white rice. The portion was plenty that I couldn't finish the entire meal even if I forced myself to. The meat was tender, lots of veggies, and it was seasoned perfectly! The place was clean. The only down sight to it was that they didn't have their business name on the building which made it difficult for me to find the location. However, as I was walking out, there were two gentlemen outside working on a ladder taking measurement which I assume was in the process of putting up the sign. This will be a good for new customers such as myself. I will certainly be back to try the rest of the menu. Thanks for the delicious meal made me feel like I was back in my moms kitchens"}
{"text":"Nice, friendly, and clean new Filipino/American restaurant. Will come definitely come back again. And  I highly recommend  their tapsilog!"}
{"text":"Just moved to the area and used yelp, found this place and the customer service is awesome. Pancit and the lumpia was good, will be back"}
{"text":"Decided to come here because I was craving Filipino breakfast. I was very impressed by the renovations and the cleanliness of the restaurant. You can tell that the owners truly take pride in their restaurant. Menu was easy to understand and offered breakfast all day, along with your staple Filipino dishes. Lisa and the whole staff were kind and hospitable during the whole visit. I loved how she got to know all of her guests' names! We ordered bangsilog and longsilog and a generous side of chicken tocino. The eggs were cooked perfectly on a bed of garlic rice. All of our food were plated beautifully. The longanisas and the bangus were crispy and delicious! We will definitely come back to explore the rest of the menu. Thank you, Lisa, for having us at your place!"}
{"text":"Love this place....always looking for a good and tasty filipino food which this place offers and much more.  The menu is not as extensive as other places but what they do offer are really yummy.  Would definitely recommend this place for anyone to try.  This place is a bit far for me but definitely worth the drive."}
{"text":"Great, fresh Filipino food, no turo turo here. Food is made to order, and the service is friendly.  Finally an above average place to get Filipino food in the east valley."}
{"text":"This Filipino joint has grown down since they changed from Manila sunrise. The Filipino vibe is gone since the place seems like an American cafe. What I mean by Filipino vibe is the culture with decorations making you feel like you're in the Philippines and watching the TFC channel on tv. The food is always good and recommend it as well as the service but the atmosphere is slowly decreasing."}
{"text":"My friend and I ate dinner here last night.  He is half Filipino and I am white.  The lady working was so sweet and friendly!  She was very enthusiastic and took time to explain what each item was for me.  She was very cautious when I said I was Gluten Free, initially saying nothing was GF.  The more we discussed it, the more she realized MOST of her dishes are GF.  We decided on several dishes including Tocilog, Pancit, Lechon Kawali, Lumpia, and sweet potato fries.  Tocilog had a great texture and was so flavorful!  I love chicken thighs and this dish was no disappointment!  The Pancit was also very good, again, great texture.  It had a variety of flavors and was absolutely delicious.  The Lumpia was NOT GF so I didn't have a change to try them but they sure looked delicious.  I have a weakness for sweet pot fries and would have liked these cooked a bit longer.  I dipped them in the lumpia sauce, very good!  The Lechon Kawali was a nice idea but for me personally, I could have done without it.  We ordered so much food, that is one dish I would have cut out.  The dipping sauce was really quite good.  The meat, sauce, and rice were great together, however I am not a fan of the \"fatty\" part.  That is simply a personal choice.  We will definitely come back to At My Place.  The sweet woman, Liza, sat at our table and chatted up us during dinner.  She was kind and her food is good.  Appears to be a good, honest, place.  I would have loved a glass of wine with dinner, that is the reason for 4 of 5 starts.  Needs a liquor license :)"}
{"text":"Great service from lisa. Fast and the food is very good ! I would have to say its better than filipina casa and halo halo kitchen . Their food actually had flavor and it's inexpensive"}
{"text":"I've only had Filipino food a few times so I can't really vouch for the authenticity but it was really good to me! I had the pork adobo and biskee both really delicious and flavorful. The garlic rice was so soft and melted in your mouth. I would come back to try their roasted pork dish."}
{"text":"We have been going to this place since they first opened. I was impressed with the food, until today it's still good. However, the service is heading in the opposite direction. I came in with friends from out of town, and today we waited for over an hour for food just to find out it was the wrong food and waited another 20 min. The waitress had the nerve to ask me to take what they made cause I will wait again, instead of apologizing and correcting it. Safe to say I won't be coming back anytime soon but to be fair the food is 4stars but service is half a star."}
{"text":"Soooo my boyfriend, who is Filipino and Mexican and loves Filipino food, and I have been waiting for months for this place to open as it is right by our house! We are in love. We got the bihon pancit, the lechon kawali, and the Bicol express and loved all of it!!! Real authentic Filipino food and the owners were very helpful and kind. We got the halo halo for dessert, delicious!!!"}
{"text":"Once I entered the restaurant they greeted me with smiles and jokes. Loves the food and the service was beyond great. I'd recommend this to anyone any day anytime. Food was super delicious and fresh. I'd come back everyday if I wasn't here for one week."}
{"text":"i love this place! The owner is really friendly and makes you feel right at home. My friends and I are from out-of-state, here for school, and it just felt as though we were at an aunt's place. It seriously came at the perfect time since we've all been somewhat homesick.   As for the food, it was really yummyyy! I had sisig for the first time and it was bomb. My friends also had various silogs (with garlic rice..YUM) as well as sinigang. Three people in our group were filipino and they all gave their thumbs up for this place (:  It is a little farther from me in terms of location, but I wouldn't hesitate to go again!"}
{"text":"The Filipino food here was on point! My son and I were craving a homestyle Pinoy breakfast. This was our first time at the restaurant and we crossed our fingers hoping it would satisfy. The service was wonderful and the food was spot on!! We met the owner, Liza,  during our breakfast and enjoyed her story of how the restaurant came to be. She made use feel so at home and we felt like long time friends. Before finishing our meal, we decided to take some food home. We ordered dinuguan and sinigang so we would have dinner for Saturday evening. The meals were fantastic!!! We are now hooked and will be 'frequent eaters' At My Place."}
{"text":"Great food! Just a simple family owned restaurant but they are putting together Phil classics wonderfully! You gotta put them on your must visit bucket list."}
{"text":"The service was awesome the food was even better, we had pancit and lumpia, great value, so good that we too 2 dozen home. The restaurant was immaculate.  We will be back and taking business to give out to friends."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I stopped here thinking it was a coffee place. The lady at the counter kindly explained that the cafe was a Filipino-American cafe. She then explained the various breakfast options and we decided on the Tapsilog, which is steak, eggs and rice.   I don't eat much red meat but this steak was so rich and flavorful. The eggs were cooked perfectly and the garlic rice was moist and tender. I was so impressed with the food and the service that I had to take the time to write a Yelp review."}
{"text":"1st time eating Filipino food.  sisig  was amazing!! Very tasty sizzling plate of roast pork with an egg on it that you stir in.  Pancit canton was decent.  Halo halo was tasty if a little unusual.  Lumpia was very good and the dipping sauce was good!   Staff were incredibly friendly and so kind with our questions.  Place was packed but service was still really really good!  Will go back again!"}
{"text":"This is my comfort spot now when I'm too lazy to cook my own corned beef, egg, garlic fried rice plate.  The owners are really nice and inviting."}
{"text":"@My Place is hands down the best, freshly cooked to order Filipino food in Arizona! They're dinuguan, pinakbet and tocilog are so delicious you'll feel like your in the Philippines! The chef Lisa is so humble and kind. The portion of food is perfectly filling and their trays of sweet desserts are more than tempting but good luck finding room in your tummy after your meal! I love how it's served on real plates and cutlery versus the typical plastic and Styrofoam turo turo places. Perfect mix of cozy and classy!"}
{"text":"This place has great home cooked Filipino food. My favorite was the Pancit Candon, Eggrolls, and french fries are amazing. There is a good assortment of pastries. It's a family owned establishment, it's very welcoming, and their service isn't shabby. Food is quick, priced right, and yummy."}
{"text":"My husband and i used to come here when it was still manila sunrise gourmet. I LOVED how they redecorated the place.. Its alot more open and clean. The food is good! I love the sizzling sisig.. Its been awhile since i had a decent sizzling sisig. The lomi though, wasnt much of a lomi. Malabon was good too! Staff was very friendly and welcoming.  Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"We had basilog, sisig and a taste of bicol express.. For dessert we had leche flan ...  My favorite of all was the bicol express and leche flan - 5 stars!!"}
{"text":"Ordered kare kare and bangsilog to go. Kare kare was tasty but rice proportions was on the small side. Not enough for an entree and two people. Fried rice with bangsilog was soggy. Got stomach ache hours after eating this and felt sick rest of the day."}
{"text":"Visiting the old neighbourhood.  Pleasantly surprise to found this mum and pop eatery.  It's clean, and welcoming. The menu is clearly written with the price. We ordered cornbeefsilog, pancit bihon, lechon kawali,  Mini lumpia, and 2 halo halo.  It was tasty, and service was prompt.  The spot is by Title Max, and Autozone. We had a lil hard time locating the place. It is our first time.  Our experience was pleasant, and we will return with our family and friends!"}
{"text":"excellent presentation of dishes. friendly  warm atmosphere and ambience to follow. being a new arizonian from the sf bay area this is definitely our place to go for the finest filipino quisine in all of AZ."}
{"text":"My church group and myself have visited this place for the first time. The food is perfect, the company and the people here are all friendly. It does not matter what walk of life you are from, of yor enjoy Filipino food your family"}
{"text":"TBH I found the portions to be a little small and the food overpriced for the portion size. I think I might just be picky with Filipino food having grown up with it my entire life.  Lisa, the owner, sat down and chatted with me a little. I found her super adorable and would come back just for her. SHE is why I am giving the place five stars... It's really obvious she cares about her customers because I saw her chat with the 2 other parties before she came to my table.  The menu was a little bit lacking. The dinuguan was decent but not spectacular. ***The garlic rice was perfect.*** I wanted to love everything but it was just OK.  However, the actual restaurant was beautiful and clean. The flowers on every table was a nice touch. It's evident Lisa takes pride in her restaurant.  I'm definitely going to try the halo-halo next time"}
{"text":"My husband n I came to visit my son n his family in Tempe. They took us to a Filipino Restaurant in Mesa. I must say the food there was exceptionally tasty n very fresh. It's the first time I've had sisig n I loved it.  The vegetables in pinakbit was cooked perfectly. I can't stop raving about this place. Food is way better than little Filipino restaurants in the Bay Area in CA. I highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"I have been here a few times and have tried the Caldereta, chicken adobo, sinigang, milk fish, and lumping. Everything tastes authentic and is a great representation of Filipino cuisine. They even serve diniguan (might be a rotational special) if that's your thing! The portions are decent and my only criticism of the food I've tried is the caldereta is a tad sweet. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Good tasting Filipino home cooked meals.  My brother just moved out to AZ, he won't miss moms cooking if this place is just a hop n a skip away."}
{"text":"This place cooks like my mom, they hide the veggies in the lumpia, it's very good, they trim the fat from the adobo, I don't care for it, the halo halo is so awesome I love it better then any halo halo in California"}
{"text":"I came in last weekend to give this place another shot. The food was very delicious. I ordered the Pork Sisig and Longsilog.  The longanisa though, was not the same as the ones I have grown to love. Might be a different brand, but wasn't bad. I mentioned in my last review, about their customer service. Had a similar experience walking in the second time. This time I was waiting behind a family who were also waiting to order. As we waited, I noticed one employee cleaning a table. Again, no greeting. The family waited a few minutes until that person got to the register to take their order. When it was my turn, I stared at the menu and waited for him to greet me. Nothing. He just stood there fiddling with something by the register, most likely waiting for me to order. Don't know how other's feel about this situation or if anyone had ever experienced a similar situation at this restaurant. I give it 4 stars, but service needs to improve."}
{"text":"It was not what I expected. I ordered pancit and it was very dissapointing. I will definitely not come here again."}
{"text":"Finally a great place to get Filipino food in the East Valley. My mom was a cook so I have very high standards when it comes to Filipino food and this place did not disappoint like other places I have been to living in Arizona. I plan on returning here many times in the future unlike the other restaurants I have tried in the past. I tried the longsilog and bangsilog and both were very delicious. Food took a little while but it was a little busy and worth the wait. The owner was very friendly and I would see her walk around asking how everyone was doing. This place seems to value customer service and I love that."}
{"text":"We came here on the recommendation of a friend, and it was SO delicious!! He told us to try the Sisig, and omg.. I'm still drooling thinking about that dish! I also got the Lomi, which had an amazing, complex broth, as well as the Halo Halo (because I always have room for dessert )  Just a heads up tho, be prepared for a bit of a wait -pretty much everything is cooked fresh, so don't expect fast food!! If you're feeling potentially hangry, definitely consider bringing a snack or trying the sweet biscuits. It's totally worth the wait tho, I can't wait to come back and explore more of their menu!!"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times now when a craving for Filipino food hits.  The restaurant is extremely clean and the staff is very friendly.   This is an \"order at the counter\" type place where they bring your food out to you.   I do wish the prices were a bit cheaper.  Considering there are other restaurants in the area that have a better pricing with a larger plate portion.  But then again you pay for the \"order what you want\" style instead of buffet type style. All in all this is a great place and their food is excellent!"}
{"text":"First time visiting the staff was very friendly. The whole pace is very clean and the presentation is very nice. Lisa sat and talked to us and we were treated like friends rather than customers. Very impressed and will come back often"}
{"text":"Please support this amazing business. I ordered take out an was greeted kindly. I simply told them I would be over in 20 mins. I arrived 20 mins later and the food I ordered was ready (kare-kare and sinigang na baboy). I arrived home eager to eat my meal and was so amazed by the careful detail and attention. For the price of the meal, it could not get any better either. The portion size was large enough and the price was well worth it as well. I can't wait to come back and try other dishes."}
{"text":"Been here numerous times,  the owner/cook came out and sat with us last time and interacted with my family and I. Always delicious and fresh,  traditional choices readily  availability. The Halo halo is to die for!!!"}
{"text":"surprised they served a good amount ... gonna go back for Pancit Malabon and Sisig ... to bad they don't have much of Filipino desserts ..."}
{"text":"There are not too many Philippine restaurants here in Tempe/Mesa area, so needless to say, I was pleasantly surprised to hear that I now have a conveniently located place to close to quench my cravings for authentic Filipino food!!  (Btw, never know the rules whether to use Ph or F).  While waiting for my food to go, I heard another customer compliment the dinuguan!  I am glad to hear since it is the meal I ordered for take-out! So I rush home, my stomach grumbling with excitement from smelling this wonderful dish!!! And oh my!!!!  Taste like my mother's cooking!!! I am sure to take my hubby here next time!!!"}
{"text":"We were looking forward to eat here but today's experience is not worth 5 stars. I did put 3 because food still good.   Reasons why I gave 3:  1) I was charged can soda for $2.25!!!! Really?!!! A can of soda when you can buy them in a vending machine for .75 cents. You would think they will give you courtesy and say \"our fountain drink is not working\" but NOPE right away charged me a GOLD soda. Please see attached picture of my receipt; and   2) Too hot. Can't enjoy the food with temperature that feels like I'm outside."}
{"text":"As of the time of this writing, this is most likely one of the best Filipino restaurants in the Valley of the Sun.  Yes, their motif is quite different from the typical Filipino restaurants wherein you choose from pre-made items. However, the care they take to prepare their meals truly shows both in the consistency and flavors of their meals.  We have tried every item on their menu. It's not all that extensive, but we haven't found any one item that has displeased our palates.  The family that runs this are the humblest kindest, and most patient people that you will ever meet. They are truly interested and concerned with your opinions of the dishes that they prepare and serve, and have no qualms in correcting any dissatisfaction that you may have.  On top of all that, their Filipino desserts are unquestionably the best this town has to offer."}
{"text":"First off, the food here was delicious especially for AZ. I would come here again in a heartbeat. The huge downside is that we came in for lunch on a Saturday with kids and they were out of 5 things on the menu which was super annoying but you didn't know they were out of it until it took young kids 10 min to decide what they wanted to just find out they were out of the items. We finally ordered and after waiting a long while, we asked for the last dish for one of our kids (already ordered and paid for)... and they were out!!!! Ugh. Service is over the top slow but friendly. They even brought out some limpia and gave to our table for waiting. Pancit Mahon delicious! Lechon Kawali delicious. Garlic fried rice yum! I could get past all that nightmare ness for some good food and company of my kind! Lastly... it's hard to tell if you walk in and wait for a table or go to the front and order. It's a new business so I am sure it will all get worked out."}
{"text":"I live in the west valley and the drive to Mesa to eat here was worth it. Food was delicious!! Pinakbet was made to perfection. Vegetables were firm and not over cooked at all. They had plenty of meat unlike other places who only add three pieces of meat or sometimes nothing. Lechón kawali was crispy and tasty. Bangus had a nice crisp flavor but I would have preferred a more marinated fish. I personally like the sourness of a marinated fried bangus. Kare kare was too thick for my liking but the flavor was good, there were only two oxtails for the $12.00 dish, they could have added tripe or meat.  Halo halo is really good! Cassava and suman worth buying. Overall it was a good authentic meal and I would rather drive there versus any other Filipino establishment in Az. I'm from San Diego so of course I know my Filipino dishes plus I cook them.  Last but not least, staff is super friendly!"}
{"text":"Wonderful service, everyone was very happy to explain anything to us as we didn't have a lot of experience with Filipino food.  We ended up getting the Tapsilog and Bangsilog. I absolutely loved the Bangsilog and will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"I have been craving for Filipino food the whole week. A friend recommended this place and it did not disappoint. It's a Filipino restaurant but is not the typical \"turo-turo\"(point-point), you order and they bring it to you. They have huge portions and the price is very affordable. The people were very friendly especially the owner Miss Lisa. Their place was the former Manila Sunrise which closed down, so don't be confused with the two. They have daily specials that they rotate so if you are looking for a specific type of food better call first. Give this place a try and you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great food. We stopped in with our kids to carry out some food.  We smacked on a halo halo as our food was being made.  Food was great. Employees were very friendly.  We would definitely go back again!"}
{"text":"Finally, found a \"Pinoy\" place to eat serving very good home cook food. Place is clean and orderly. I hope the owner can maintain it well. Keep it up!"}
{"text":"I headed over to Manila Sunrise this morning, only to find it gone and this new café in its place, having its grand opening.  As soon as I stepped inside, I was impressed with the way they spruced up the interior.  It's bright and clean, painted in warm colors.  At 11am, it was pretty crowded with mixed-generation families.  Menu options were fairly limited, but I was told they may rotate new items as they go.  But if you like silog, you've got some options here.  I opted for the sweet longsilog, and was not disappointed: you get sausage, rice, a fried egg, tomato slices, and a cucumber salad.  The sausage was delicious!  It was nice to just sit at the bar by the window, drinking coffee and enjoying a good breakfast.  I was going to deduct a star because they forgot to bring me silverware and didn't come by to check on me while I was eating (in fairness, first day -- and, they were busy).  But then a lady walked by offering samples of leche flan (milk custard), and all was forgiven, as you can see by my rating.  (I'll overlook a lot for flan.)  Service was courteous and friendly.  Bathroom was spotless.  Food was yummy.  Prices were reasonable.  Definitely worth checking out if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"Visiting my sister here in Arizona and would Like to try this Filipino restaurant.  We only ordered 2 items for to go,  Pancit Bihon and Bicol Express. We got in at 6:15pm and  we got our order at 7:08pm!!! That is 50 minutes!!  Pancit shouldn't take that long!!  As well as the Bicol Express.. i have  always been patient when it comes to food orders as I am in the food industry for almost 2 decades but this one really tested my patience..  As for the quality of food... the pancit was okay but the  Bicol express is bland and lacks flavor  and was not at all spicy which should be.. The server who is aware of the wait  should have at least apologize for  the long wait but nothing..  poor customer service.  Sorry but was really very disappointed."}
{"text":"I tried to have lunch at this cafe today. First of all no one knows how to smile there.  It took 22 minutes to get my meal. I wanted to eat there but had to take it to go. The woman that said she was the cook took time out from the kitchen to help take pictures for a group eating there. The only good thing was that she credited my meal but charged me for the can of soda. I don't need to go back."}
{"text":"I was feeling nostalgic.... Been away from family for awhile, which means lack of home-cooking. Considered a few other filipino spots but At My Place Cafe won. It's very unassuming and a little hole in the wall spot....which I love and gives it more character...so to speak.   Brought back memories....from the uncles and aunties talking outside to the sound of laughter and forks clanging on the plates.  Wall board style menu, basic...basic staple foods. Not confusing at all. It was crowded but festive. No issues with the wait; typical for any restaurant that provides home made, wait to order food. It was worth every mile we drove...every minute we waited....  Loved it. I will be back."}
{"text":"Best Filipino food in Arizona!  Every dish we have tasted here is good.  We are hooked!  Kudos to the chef and nice owners."}
{"text":"first time in phoenix and my friend took me to lunch at this awesome filipino restaurant...  menu looks simple...has the filipino basics...everything written on a chalk board and prices are reasonable & portions big.   ordered the classic crispy pata ( deep fried pork hock), crispy sisig ( sizzling pork on a sizzling plate with a fresh egg on top) ) and pancit palabok ( traditional filipino noodle dish)  for dessert, the always reliable \"halo-halo\" ( filipino mixed ice) ( its basically shaved ice with bits of sweet beans, jackfruit, fruit bits, and yam in a tall glass filled with evaporated milk and topped with mango ice cream and a piece of leche flan( creme caramel on top)  first the sisig....pork was sliced uniformly....seasoned well, had enough fat to meat ratio, but unfortunately sizzled a little too much so came a bit burnt. it was the least fav of our group.  next the pancit palabok...i must say, this dish was very very good. noodles were al dente, the sauce mix was tasty and not overpowering. generous sprinkled of ground pork, and tooped with crispy calamari rings and shrimp tempura. such a good value for money. i couldnt stop eating it.   next was the crispy pata...by far , the best dish! perfectly fried with a crispylicious skin, and the meat was tender, juicy, meaty, and full of flavour, complimented by a nice soy/vinegar dip.   the dessert was also superb! the leche flan was so creamy and silky smooth, it brought back memories of eating from the motherland. the yam and other fruits all came together and made the dish a winner.   customer service was outstanding, we were attended to well, given a lot of welcome to arizona kudos, and lots of smiles and salutations.   i left a very happy man! very satisfied with the meal and promised to come back.   happy eating!!"}
{"text":"Arguably the best Filipino food I've had in a while. It's tucked away in strip mall near a Goodwill. The atmosphere is very comfortable and the food is really good. If you miss home style Filipino food from your childhood like me this is a great place. Great foodie destination for the ethnic food hunters out there."}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE!!!  Wished they had bibinca when I went but I had hallo hallo and omg just like family makes it and the place is clean and inviting the family is truly sweet and their food is to die for GO CHECK THEM OUT!!!"}
{"text":"There are very few Filipino restaurants in Phoenix, and even fewer that are worth visiting.  I think we finally found one in the East Valley that  is really good.  Keep in mind my wife is Filipina, and I've been to the Philippines several times.  So my standards are different.  I know what it's supposed to taste like!  The place is small but clean.  I like that it doesn't have a cafeteria-style presentation like most Filipino restaurants do.  You actually have to order what you want, and they prepare and bring it to you.  Service was kind of slow, but that's the price you pay when the food isn't sitting in a warming pan waiting for someone to order it!  I could see through the kitchen door they were actively cooking as items were ordered.  I'm sure some preparation was done ahead of time (e.g. kaldereta has to simmer for a few hours), but they were cooking in there!  The selection was respectable, and all seemed to be traditional fare (how about kare kare made with actual tripe?).  On to the food!  We ordered several things.  The pancit (bihon) was nothing special.  Not bad, but really lacking in flavor.  This was the low-point. The sisig was really good, as was the kaldereta and pinakbet. Portions may have been a bit small for the price, but not bad.  My wife also ordered a halo halo dessert, and really liked it.  They topped it with a small piece of leche flan.  My wife and her mom both loved everything (except the bihon).  If the pancit had been better I'd probably go with five stars here.  But for five stars they have to execute well everything they do, and the bihon just didn't.  Next time maybe we'll try the pancit malabon (palabok).  Definitely we'll be coming back.  Finally someplace on the east side of town that breaks the mold of mediocrity for Filipino food!  It is one dollar sign (under $10) if you order one item.  But if you add a drink or dessert or a second item, it will become two $$.  They're right on the edge between $ and $$."}
{"text":"If you are wondering where to get really good Filipino food, this is where to go. Well prepared foods do better than I anticipated. Very friendly and clean inside. Reminded me of home-cooked Filipino food at grandmas house. So so good."}
{"text":"Bistec and kare kare on point with flavor...out of lumpia = disappointed hubby....very friendly owners....my usual question- would I go back? Yes!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the food. My fiancé is Filipino and is a total food snob so he compared it to what he was used to and said it was better than most places. But it was exactly what I was craving. We had the bihon pancit and lumpias with white rice. I thought it was great. The only issue was that the service was a little slow, although we got there around 1 PM. Our lumpias and rice came out and then we waited a pretty long time for the pancit. It was still pretty busy, but the employees were rushing around clearly in need of a little more help. We ordered halo halo and I think they forget it so we had to remind them. The halo halo was a little different than I'm used to but it was good! We will definitely be back. Maybe at a less busy hour."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite Filipino restaurants in Arizona. It's clean, good, and authentic! I like how they make their food fresh and not that typical toro toro style (which I really dislike) because half the time those foods aren't even fresh. My favorite dish here is pretty much everything. The owner is very nice and friendly. I hope this place will last in Arizona. I recommend this place to everyone who have not tried Filipino food, just ask the server which food to order."}
{"text":"BEST FILIPINO RESTAURANT I'VE EVER BEEN TO IN AZ!!! As soon as you walk in, the place feels really welcoming and cozy yet still classy. The food is just amazing. Their portions are great for such an affordable price. The food presentation is neat and pleasant. What really impressed me tho, aside from the amazing food of course, is the service. Everyone is so friendly and approachable, and you can tell that they value their customers! Ms. Lisa, the owner conversed with us and was so humble and accommodating. Did not mean to write the review this long, but I just have nothing to say but good things about this place. They are probably going to be my go-to Filipino restaurant. Will definitely be back and will definitely recommended this to my friends and family!!"}
{"text":"I'm such a crazed for authentic Filipino food! Aside from my moms cooking, this place is amazing! I loved their pork sinigang and also their sizzling sisig! And the people that work there, so inviting and easy to talk to ! They make you feel like you're entering into their own home!"}
{"text":"My filipino co-worker recommended this place so I decided to give it a try. LOVE IT. You order at the counter and they bring the food and out to your table, after you seat yourself.  Service A lady (I think she's the owner) helped us figure out what we wanted. She was very nice and helpful in explaining to us what the different menu items were. She checked up on us as well to see how our meal was going. Very friendly and welcoming  Food SOOOO GOOODD. We got the Adobo Silog and the Lomi. Both were very good. Though my over-easy egg was a little overdone, it was still very good.  I can't wait to come back and try other stuff!"}
{"text":"This is probably my new filipino restaurant. Is it very cozy and the owner and the employee are very nice. They greet you with big smiles as soon as you walk in. Would always come here everyday. FYI: i have been here 2 days in a row now."}
{"text":"I think this place is good. I also think I don't like Filipino food. I'm a pescatarian so I ordered milk fish. This is the only place I've ever had milk fish. Not my jam. But the owner stopped and talked with us for a while which was also cool because they were technically closed. I guess they're trying to close on Wednesdays but don't want to turn people away.   My meal came with garlic rice and an egg cooked perfectly to over medium - no place ever gets that right. Anyway, my colleague and I were the only white people in the restaurant so I also felt like that was a good sign.   Good luck!"}
{"text":"All I can say is that they catered more to the customers that spoke Filipino. Im 70 percent Filipino born and raised in Hawaii. Excuse me for not learning Tagalog. Food was alright. Took about 35 mins to get the pancit after we had our first dish. Beef caldereta tasted fine. And on another note I guess you would want to go when there first open. They had a problem with running out of dishes. Wanted to try the crispy pata, dinuguan, kare kare & halo halo. Yet I was told \"we are out\". Tip- speak the language and you'll be fine. TBH- I was hoping experience would have been better I had high standards and good reviews from others abut this place. Totally opposite"}
{"text":"Although the restaurant is fairly new, the first thing you will notice is how spick and span it is. You could eat off the floor it was so clean! The chef and owner welcomed us at the door and were very polite. The hospitality here is unrivaled compared to most restaurants in AZ!  The menu apparently changes daily, so beware as they might not have some items you are expecting. On this particular day I wanted adobo, but unfortunately it was not available. Our table (2 people) settled on Lumpia Shanghai, Kare-Kare (one of the daily specials), and Pancit Canton. Be sure to order extra rice with one entree since it comes with a tiny scoop. The Kare-Kare was tasty and came with plenty of tripe, but not enough oxtail! The one-single-uno-isa oxtail however was fall-off-the-bone good. As for the Pancit and Lumpia... okie lang. The meal was also served some achara and bagoong, which was a nice touch.   It does not get anymore authentic than this place! Be sure to stop by and they will take care of you."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place!  The Chicken Adobo was off the hook!  The restaurant is spotless and the owners are so, SO kind.  I'll be back and I'm bringing my family and friends!"}
{"text":"Great food and awesome service at a reasonable price. We ordered the bistek and beef caldereta. Both were amazing! Will definitely come back to try their other dishes."}
{"text":"I like this place.. I'm semi picky with Filipino food so I can't quite give it a five star because it does lack in certain areas... but overall it's a good place to eat.  I love the pork adodo, when it's available.. and the panseit, without the egg.  Everything else seems to be a hit and miss for me.  My guy really likes the breakfast sausage they have ... longsilong/longanisa. They serve garlic rice automatically so if you want regular white steamed rice make sure to request it that way.  Also, be aware that they cater and because of this they seem to almost always be out of something ... it's frustrating enough that I will call ahead to find out if they have what I want and to make sure they aren't closed due to an \"event\" like a birthday or such. I would hate for you to drive from the west valley, only to find it's not open to the public."}
{"text":"If you're ever looking for authentic Filipino food, this is the spot! Came in for lunch today with my gf.  We ordered the sizzling sisig and the crispy pata. Everything came out amazing. Just the right portion for the two of us to share. Menu design was written on a cart board, which I thought was neat. Overall I really enjoyed this place a lot. Would come back for seconds. Recommended to all if your looking for tasteful authentic Filipino food."}
{"text":"Oh boy! My new favorite food place!  Lisa makes you feel welcome and the food is yum! You must like garlic and salt! Or, have them go lite on both. I had Sizzling Sisig. Filipino breakfast for dinner. Don't know Filipino?  Ask Lisa!"}
{"text":"Hot, freshly cooked, authentic Filipino food in a warm, clean, inviting environment. Absolutely the best with no comparison. Great and friendly service too. Love this place and the food."}
{"text":"Delicious Filipino food. Loved their pancit, lumpia and beef steak. Friendly and attentive service."}
{"text":"This has became my favorite place to go.  The Philippine food is authentic and there isn't another place like that in the area."}
{"text":"The best Filipino restaurant in the valley. Tastes just like the food my family makes. Great service. Clean restaurant and amazing food. If you're thinking about going to another Filipino restaurant in the valley. Don't do it. @ my place is worth it every time."}
{"text":"My husband and I had a delicious authentic Filipino dinner here last night. We had the Pork Sinigang, Pork Adobo (we wanted Chicken but they ran out) and Lumpia Shanghai. Everything was just as good as my Tita's would make! The sinigang was the perfect amount of sour with lots of delicious fresh veggies, the adobo was so tender and the lumpia was piping hot and deliciously crunchy. The food is made to order so you may have to wait a little bit but it is well worth it! On our way home we were already talking about what we were going to try the next time we visit.  I gave them 4 stars instead of 5 because we had to wait at the counter a bit before we were helped, and they brought out the appetizer and our drinks with the main course. These are all a few \"new business kinks\" that I am sure they will work out. Honestly, the food and friendliness made me quickly forget the issues we initially had.  The owners (owners are the chef & her husband) were so friendly and welcoming, the chef was talking with us and entertaining my daughter while we ate :)  I don't have any of my Filipino family here in Arizona and eating the food here made me a little less home sick :) We will definitely be back... a lot!!!    If you are new to Filipino cuisine, they are more than happy to explain the items on the menu and don't be scared, Filipino food is delicious (they also have some American fare on the menu). Support local business and give At My Place a try!"}
{"text":"Really good Filipino food, feels exactly like home made.  Service takes time because all food us cooked to order."}
{"text":"There are no Filipino restaurants in the Metro Atlanta area where I live, so when I spent a weekend in the Scottsdale/Phoenix area, one of the first things I did was to search for one.  Fortunately, a few came up in my online search, but At My Place Café stood out to me because it had a 5-star rating in a popular review site.  I stopped by to have dinner before I flew back East, and I am glad I did.  Despite its westernized name, the moment I stepped in I felt like I was back home.   I ordered sisig and rice (which was highly recommended at that review site) and I am glad I did.  It's one of the best sisig I've ever tasted in my life and I'm not kidding.  I liked it so much that I finished the whole thing even though it was good for 2 or 3 people! I found out that their chef was from Pampanga, where the dish originated...so it's probably as authentic as it can get.  I also ordered their halo-halo - the serving was also huge, and I love that it came with ice cream and leche flan. It tasted great, but to me it missed a lot of key halo-halo ingredients...like the different kinds of beans, pinipig, ube.  Food came out fast, yet it was freshly cooked.  The people who served the food (and I think they're also the owners) are also very nice.  I had some good conversation with them and their chef after I had my meal.  If I lived in the vicinity, I would eat here often."}
{"text":"Just tried out this place! Great place for Filipino food!!  Their Kare Kare was delicious and for dessert their halo-halo was very good!!  Make sure you try out their lechon and lumpia too!!  Hats off to the cooks! Can't wait to go back soon!!"}
{"text":"The restaurant hospitality was fantastic! The owners are really nice! Found out this place has only been open for 6 months, but it felt like they have been open a lot longer. For the quality of food the prices are extremely low, but you should not go in there when you are in a rush because it is a restaurant owned by a small family. I would go there again and recommend it to everyone!"}
{"text":"At My Place Cafe just opened yesterday! We were in the shopping plaza Saturday and had already eaten but saw the large Grand Opening banner and peeked inside to see what this cafe was like. After looking at the menu we knew we had to check it out for breakfast the next day.  This little restaurant serves up a mix of Filipino and American foods. The all-day Filipino breakfast menu is up on the chalkboard while there is a rotating daily menu of breakfast, lunch, and dinner dishes on a clipboard near the register to look at. We decided on the tapsilog and tocilog ($7.99 each). We also shared some vegetable eggrolls.  The interior is cute, with sunny warm accents and a contemporary feel. On the counter there are various pastry items, both Filipino style and American, if you're looking for more of a quick bite.  Our orders were nicely presented, and had a good amount of meat and rice to them. Both the tapsilog (Marinated sliced beef) and the tocilog (Marinated, cured pork slices) had rich, deep, earthy flavor in every bite. I was slightly disappointed that the I couldn't taste more of the garlic in the sinangag (Garlic fried rice). We also received one egg instead of the two that were advertised on the menu. The egg was cooked perfectly to order at least (We requested over easy). There was a small bowl of papaya salad (atchara) that went well with the meal.  The vegetable egg rolls were 4 to an order and were fried to a lovely golden brown color. They tasted decent, although the filling tasted slightly mushy to me.  Service was friendly.  Overall the breakfast was a hefty meal of meat and rice and I'll be back to try some more dishes."}
{"text":"Phenomenal service and the most friendliest restaurant I've been to! As soon as you walk in you are greeted by warm and welcoming staff. The food was delicious and traditional. My favorite was the Halo-Halo, I'd most certainly drive back for the dessert alone."}
{"text":"I had never had Filipino food before until I tried this place.  Every dish I have had there is really good, I don't have one complaint.  Eat here!"}
{"text":"I'm not filipino, but I like the food and this place does a really good job with the food.  They don't have any pictures of the food and they take a long time to prepare it.  But if you want good filipino food with good service, is s good place to go."}
{"text":"At my place is probably my favorite Filipino restaurant in the valley! Fair warning it is really busy especially on the weekends so expect there to be a wait time. I personally order my food to go and then show up about 30 minutes after I order over the phone!   The owners are very friendly and humble, they are very set on providing a delightful Filipino experience to all that come through their doors! Sometimes the staff can be overworked but I think that's to be expected from a family run restaurant. That being said they do keep the restaurant very clean.   The food is always amazing I typically order the sisig which is always warm and crispy! The pancit canton which they nail each time definitely add some lemon to give it that extra kick! The chicken adobo is to die for, it has a unique flavor to it and the sauce is runny enough to mix with the rice!   I always look forward to getting food from at my place!"}
{"text":"Take it from someone that's born in the Philippines and lived there for 5 years recently - this is my favorite Filipino food restaurant. If you want to be satisfied, then come here!"}
{"text":"Best Filipino food I've had in a long time!  We ordered the lechon, sisig, and sinigang and all three were amazing.  The owners were very nice as well."}
{"text":"The food are great..very authentic on Filipino taste and presentation ..place is very clean and admirably presentable to customer ... owner and workers are friendly."}
{"text":"Came here on the suggestion of a Filipino friend, who was pleasantly surprised to find good Filipino food in AZ. I enjoyed my dishes; lumpia, beef caldereta, & sisig. I did think my caldereta needed a little more spice to it. Place was nice and clean, the people were friendly and asked us questions. If I ever crave some Filipino I know where to come."}
{"text":"I wasn't expecting for it to be this good being that I'm not fillipino from previous reviews. This is the best pinakbet I've had in AZ. Pancit is delicious. Lechon is not the best but it's doable. Better than all the other places I've been . Workers are nice and friendly. I'll be back again with my friends!"}
{"text":"Basis for my starred ratings (which skews heavily to the food): 1 star:  Never again. 2 stars:  Poor food, poor experience, extraordinary measures in order for me to come back. 3 stars:  Average, nothing really special, nothing particularly bad. 4 stars:  Very good, would definitely return. 5 stars:  A favorite, one of the best.  Came here after I heard they replaced the old Filipino place.  This review is actually 4.5 stars but I'll show it as 5 for reasons below.  4 for the food generally, with the added 1/2 star for the clean, updated interior and friendly service.  Came here starving at brunch time  so I ordered two entrees:  sisig and longsilog.  It was way more food than I anticipated, so the value is excellent.  The sisig is the best I've had in the Valley and compares well to the best in California.  Based on the sisig alone, I'm showing the 4.5 star review as 5.  It has some crunchy bits, some chewy bits, the egg to really add to the richness and clog the arteries, and the citrus to cut all that richness a bit.  Comes with a side of rice that I did not touch because . . .  The longsilog.  Also a very generous portion and also quite good.  Didn't enjoy it as much as the sisig, was very slightly underwhelmed by the sausages themselves.  They were fine, just nothing special.  But I finished my plate, which says something.  So for next time, I'll have to go with a friend and order the lechon kawali, dinuguan, and adobo.  But I suspect, given my experience here already, that I will enjoy them all, justifying the nearly 5 stars."}
{"text":"The owner is a true Gem! Family owned business with that delicious homemade food. I was craving eggs and rice and went in for Longsilog (I still can't pronounce this properly). The sausage was cooked perfectly! Also ordered the Halo Halo... and now I'm stuffed. Service was amazing, they were so busy at the time the food took a little longer to come so they even gave us an order of Lumpia on the house. How sweet!!!"}
{"text":"Great customer service, food, and ambiance. The owner sat down and chat with us, she's so nice and friendly. The price is reasonable and they serve large portions, so come hungry. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I love the food here. We ordered pork sinigang  which I think is the best in the valley. We also ordered Hinayana langka with shrimp - it's so good. Their kare -kare is great - the peanut sauce is sooo good. It is a little fatty which is probably a deduction of .5. I was not a fan of their lomi- I think it's pretty bland. Overall though I am still giving this a 5 star because the ambiance and how nice the owners are plus the food we had except exceeded our expectations."}
{"text":"The food was really great. We order the pork singang and the tocilog. The wait time was longer than expected. Overall it was a good experience."}
{"text":"Sisig... Not usually a fan of sisig but tried it here today.. They use pork belly n fry it then mix in with n skillet n other goodies.. Very nice texture as most places use other parts of pig n usually not my forté...  Also had some halo halo.. Def top of the list for AZ pinoy places.. About my 5th time here over years n changing their name etc.. Looks like they finally got it down, will be back soon..  Maraming salamat po. Masarap diba.. Lol."}
{"text":"Descent filipino restaurant that serves popular filipino dishes such as adobo, lechon kewaili, lumpia, and different types of pancit.  I've eaten at many restaurants that offers filipino cuisine and by far this pretty good but not the best. The prices are pretty steep for the portions. We wanted to try several dishes however most of them were all out so we settled for their mixed pancit which consist of both canton and bihon noodles stir fried with cabbage, carrots, celery, and chicken then topped with green onions and panko crusted fried shrimp. That was pretty good, either we were very hungry from waiting nearly an hour also we got lechon Kawali which is pork belly deep fried then chopped served with Manag tomas lechon sauce. 6-7 pieces for 10.00 hmmm... also we tried the beef caldereta with bell peppers and bits of fried hash potatos. Not really a stew if the veggies were just topped. Also last but not least kare-kare. Worth waiting over an hour for however we were full so we just took a few bites. I rated this place decent, service- none,  Food-okay not that great, could be better. Pricing- pretty steep for the  portions."}
{"text":"Not point and pick and I'm so sad to say I was  disappointed in the food authenticity. The chicken adobo is runny and not thick like ive had in the past, the Longanesa is more like a hot link, the Lumpia was lacking a lot of flavor.  If your looking for authentic and you have had authentic Filipino in the past this is not the place to find that flavor."}
{"text":"Craving for Filipino food, I go on good ol trusty (mostly) Yelp to find a spot. This place has unusually high rating, good reviews, and the food looks delicious. Unfortunately, my experience was far from the case. Since I was looking forward to try At My Place Cafe, I suggested it to my aunt and thought it would be a nice experience for my grandma who had cancer (RIP) to try something new.  When we walked in, there weren't too many people, the atmosphere was quiet and there were plenty of seats to choose from. Their first mistake was not having a menu that wasn't handwritten and hanging on the wall. This is really inconvenient and for some, very hard to read. We figured out what we wanted and it took a while for someone to take our order. Didn't really think anything of it until we were waiting about 20-30 minutes and watching other people get their food that were there after us.  We asked about it and the lady just said \"yes, it's coming\". My aunt informed her beforehand to bring out my grandma's food first because she was really hungry and she said \"yes, yes\". After 30 mins, she finally gives us our beverages which was water and a fountain lemonade. Five minutes later, she comes out with mine and my aunt's order which is pretty annoying when we asked for them to bring my grandma's order first. Now she has to see our food while she's hungry. We of course offer ours and she says it's too salty. I ordered the chicken adobo breakfast which I felt was basic enough to not mess up and my aunt ordered pancit. Both dishes that seem to be very simple and should not take 35 minutes to make.   Ten minutes later, my grandma's dish comes out and of course it is the wrong order. She had ordered pork with vegetables but they gave her shrimp. It has been 45 minutes now and we are not about to send it back. My aunt said her dish was okay but kind of oily, the vegetables my grandma had were very bitter, and my chicken adobo was salty, bland in flavor and some of the chicken was dry; the egg was overcooked. I had also ordered the halo halo which I did not finish because it was gross.   The only positive thing I can say about the food was that it had good presentation. When we asked why it took so long, someone said it's because they used fresh ingredients (I saw this in a review too). I'm pretty sure most places use fresh ingredients and don't take this long. I might have been more forgiving if the people who worked there were more apologetic. Since we had to pay ahead before knowing what our experience would be like, my aunt really regretted tipping them so much and I ended up feeling bad for being the one suggesting this place. Terrible service and very mediocre food."}
{"text":"My older brother recommended this place to me since I've been wanting a good filipino restaurant to go to. My first visit was today. I had their sizzling sisig and crispy pata. Sisig was delish. It had a nice crunch to it and the spice was perfect. The crispy pata was crispy as it should be. It was perfectly cooked and tasted amazing! It came with a soy vinegar sauce. It was a lil pricey here but as long as the food was delicious, I dont mind. At least I know my money is worth it. There arent a lot of good filipino restaurant here in Arizona. Usually, I find them in California. This would have to be the best one in the valley. Im glad I enjoyed this place. Iwas a little worried at first because I didnt want to go to a place and end up not liking it but I did. So did my bf and hes laotian . Lol we will definitely come back anytime I crave filipino food or in case I feel super lazy cooking. People are also great and very friendly! I highly recommend this place for a filipino restaurant."}
{"text":"I gave 3 stars because of the \"service\" I received. I called up the restaurant to order lunch for pick up. And the lady asked my number so that she can call me back as soon as she is done with whatever she's doing. So I said ok and gave her number.  1 hour had passed and no call. I called up again and a different staff answered. I told what had happened and he just laughed. I felt insulted as a customer. The food is good but I hope you will not accept phone orders if you can't handle it."}
{"text":"I used to love going to this place. Sadly this place went down hill in terms of customer service. They need to hire more servers and cooking personnel. I ordered probably 4 dishes and waited over an hour just to get 3 of them. It was ridiculous! The reason I rated this place a 1 because I gave them several chances, but the service is just too slow. We will not be go by back anytime soon."}
{"text":"It's not the typical Filipino food your used to,?food are not swimming in fat and not over seasoned. Be ready to wait for your food though especially when it's busy but it's all worth it...they make the food fresh and it's delicious, love the kare kare, beef caldereta, lumpia Shanghai, shrimp sinigang and pinakbet."}
{"text":"This place is very good. Traditional food options with great portions and great flavor. Very clean restaurant and nice staff and owner. Closed on Wednesday's but check it out in the days open, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Being from Upstate NY, it isn't often I am able to enjoy some authentic Filipino food, unless it is homemade. So, when I was in town for my brother's wedding, I made sure I got some here!  Everything was quite delicious, from the adobo to the lumpia. The only thing that was missing was the sound of roosters crowing in the background to make me feel as though I was back in the Philippines, as God knows Arizona has the heat.  It was a bit of a wait for my food, but they were pretty busy and we called ahead and arrived a little early. However, the wait was worth it and I'll definitely be back the next time I am in town.   Everything was shared and finished by two happy nieces and two happy parents, as well as myself. My oldest niece even had a tad meltdown over who got to have the last of the lumpia. So if that doesn't tell you anything...."}
{"text":"I was gonna give 5 stars but I give it a 4 and won't lie because I don't think their halo-halo looks like a real halo-halo. I was quite disappointed and didn't even eat the halo-halo after 2 bites cause it just didn't taste well with a vanilla ice cream. It's suppose to be UBE (purple yam) & lots of other ingredients but it was so simple and plain. I didn't like it as much. It's a little pricey here but the dinuguan was worth it except the halo-halo. Also the food takes a while to be ready so be prepared to wait. Overall, the experience was good, just needs a real halo-halo. That's all. Thanks."}
{"text":"This place was close to our hotel and after a few days without rice, my Filipino husband couldn't take it anymore so we found this place on yelp. It was a Sunday afternoon and they were pretty busy, there was no open seating inside so we sat outside. Inside was warm and stuffy, they had ceiling fans but it was just rotating hot nasty air. The tables outside were extremely dusty like no one ever wipes them down. Our food took a while, we figured it would be a while since they were so packed, but took a long time. We didn't get or waters until we went back inside to ask for them and we have to ask for silverware too. However, worth the wait. The bistek was delicious and authentic, so was my husbands tapsilong. The lumpia was just okay, I've had much better. My kids said it everything tasted just like grandmas so that tells you how authentic the flavors were. Overall the taste was there on the main dishes."}
{"text":"My husband and I eat here everyday and considered it as an extension of our home. We've tried all of the nearby restaurants that serve Filipino food but nothing compares to At My Place Cafe. The owner who we fondly call ate Lisa even cooked tokwa't baboy and arroz caldo when we requested for it. We've tried all the dishes and all are delicious!"}
{"text":"Not happy - came because of the reviews - sitting at a dirty table outside - I get they are busy but geez - hell your customers with something clean and presentable - last time coming here"}
