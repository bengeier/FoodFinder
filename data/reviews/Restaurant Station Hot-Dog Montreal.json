{"text":"Best poutine I've ever had in my life!!!!! And I'm not kidding worth it to check it out :)"}
{"text":"With a name like Hot Dog Station, many don't know about their amazing breakfast dishes.  We usually get the veggie omelette and the construction (meat lovers trust me on this one).  Service is great and prices are cheap.  Trust me you won't regret going here!"}
{"text":"A good breakfast/ brunch atmosphere. Staffs are nice and friendly. 4 star for the food. Diffinitely coming back to taste their other breakfast menu."}
{"text":"The new (well at least 2 years now!) has really upgraded this place...  It has really great breakfasts in the morning and fantastic hotdogs, hamburgers, poutine and, those subs!!! Great for take-out - what i usually do.  Breakfasts on weekend mornings are busy so get there early!"}
{"text":"You can't go wrong eating here if you are in the mood for hotdogs. Everything tastes great, the service is quick, and the staff are friendly."}
{"text":"I hadn't been to this place in over 16 years because the cashier back then had helped fill my order without washing her hands. I went on a Friday night last week and noticed it was very busy. They have their act together now. It was like watching Hell's Kitchen. There's one person taking orders and expediting, a cashier, one hotdog guy, 2 on the grill and one on French fries. Extremely organized. The kitchen and restaurant area looked clean and the food tasted good. I will return and can recommend."}
{"text":"Not what I expected. It is ordinary, nothing really special. Very expensive. Ordered 3 steamed hotdogs, 2 small Poutine, and 2 small cokes, 26$! On top of that, the cashier was eating her lunch while she was taking our order. The other lady who was preparing our three hotdogs was also going in the back room to have a bite of her lunch literally every minute. Took us 12min exactly to get our order completed. Owner swears every 10 seconds with his coworker saying stuff like \"this is why the world is going to sh*t\", or \"F this F that. All in front of clients. If you want to be served by employees who stuff their face with food and swear while they prepare your order, then this is the place to go to."}
