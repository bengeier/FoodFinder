{"text":"This is family owned type Chinese food. Good selection. Flavours were good. Enjoyed the basil beef a lot. We'd order again."}
{"text":"I had a craving for chinese food and thought I'll check this place out tonight.  It's a small place, your typical family own restaurant.  The owners are very friendly and my food came out super hot for takeout.  I ordered the house special fried rice, sweet and sour chicken and crispy beef.  I actually enjoyed my meal and I'm glad the sweet and sour chicken was similar to what you get in Chinatown not fried chicken balls with sauce drizzled on top.  The fried rice wasn't bad and the crispy beef was pretty good. A little on the sweet side but I'll still eat it. Lots to choose from on the menu, will definitely try a few more items next time."}
{"text":"Am I ever glad I looked passed the store-front and went inside to order take out from this place. The House Pad Thai and Thai curry peanut were AMAZING! I haven't had this kind of great tasting Thai since a popular Clarkson spot closed down (S&F). I also enjoyed their fresh rolls with shrimp which were big and fresh. I plan to work My way through the entire menu!  Ps. The lunch promo is great value."}
{"text":"A truly bizarre experience.  I really do struggle to give small businesses less than 3*s, unless it's absolutely necessary.  And in this case, I deemed it necessary!  First, the lady at the front acted as though she was being held hostage working here.  Maybe she is, who knows.  Second, restaurant doubled as a daycare on my first (and probably last) visit on Friday night!  Owner/worker's kids were running amuck, blowing a Dollarama kazoo, throwing Lego on the floor, jumping on a chair, and eventually on a TABLE.  AND there were 2 female diners trying to eat!    The counter lady exasperatedly told her kids to be quiet about twice, but she sounded so nonchalant.  Kids ignored her and the 5yo kept blowing that bloody kazoo!  (There is even evidence that children are frequently there as there are car seats, bikes, and toys in front of the counter!!!  Very unprofessional and possibly illegal.)   While I was waiting for my food, I felt as though I was waiting for an accident to happen right before my very eyes.  I asked the 2 women how they were able to even eat with all the noise/distraction, and they said that they were just about to leave.  The owners are Cantonese speaking, so I told the kids several times that they shouldn't be making soo much noise or playing in the restaurant like they were.  And they blatantly ignored me.  When the counter lady finally returned with my takeout, I was about to tell her that she should have better control of her children, but I didn't hafta...her 3yo girl was ON TOP OF THE TABLE playing with the utensils!!!  To top it off, food was like a 2/5, edible, but uninspired, and definitely NOT authentic by any means.  Whomever is giving this place a 5 must have dead tastebuds or something.  Yes, it's cheap.  Would I go there again just because of that, certainly not!"}
