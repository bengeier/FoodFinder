{"text":"We take out about 2-3 times a month. What keeps my family and i coming back is the char pit BBQ chicken flavor. I don't know anywhere else in my area that can offer this. The sides are generous and tasty. The prices are fair and you feel that you got your money's worth. 

The line ups are sometimes comical and while in line you wonder what else would I stand in queue for this long....not much. I think that says it all

Food aside, I think customers would benefit if they improved their process to move customers in and out. By now they should know the demand and prepare adequately. Many of the folks in line are just coming home from work and need to get home to be with their families. Improve the wait time and I personally would go there more often

Great work, keep it up"}
{"text":"Delicious chicken and ribs!!!! Too bad they don't deliver."}
{"text":"You can smell the chicken in the air down the street and it's amazing. 

I usually get the fries and salad as my sides. I love the fries - they're seasoned with a salty-black pepper-oregano-paprika kind of spice mix. The fries themselves are a mix of soft and crispy and it's addictive. Generally, I haven't had a bad side here - the cod, potatoes and rice are good.

I do agree with some of the reviewers comments about how the sauce on the chicken is oily, but the hot sauce is 100% a necessity. This is a dirty bird treat meal at it's finest. 

Side note: The custard tarts on the counter may not look like much, but they're outstanding! I sometimes come here just for them!"}
{"text":"No doubt about it, chicken is really good. Love the sauce, I could drink it straight.

Service was terrible.

Lady with wavy hair (probably manager/ owner) was yelling at her staff the whole time!
Not a very good look to customers who were all watching what's going on.
I found it disrespectful and really demeaning to the people who are under her management. 

I understand that it is very busy, there was a long line up. But this is not an excuse to be rude to customers and to her staff. She should be happy that they have a line up. 
The rest of the staff are doing the best that they can, they didn't have to be yelled at."}
{"text":"I was introduced to this place many years ago by a friend, it has been almost five years since my first visit.

Brasas was nearing the completion of a renovation on this occasion, what was done looked very nice and professionally done.

It is more of lunch/ takeout place based on size and hours, there were no seats or tables when I went (in the process of a reno) but even if there were, there would only be enough space for a few patrons.

There was long line when arrived I started taking pictures of the restaurant but I was politely asked not to take a picture of the automated charcoal heated rotisserie despite there being a picture on their flyer which I have posted.

It is a cafeteria style system you order as they prepare food and pay at the end.

I ordered a half chicken dinner with rice, potatoes, and salad. Parts of the chicken were dry and other parts moist, reason being they cook the whole chicken at once without brine so to ensure all parts (legs and thighs) are cooked some will end up dry (breasts). Food was extremely oily and flavour of rice and potatoes were nothing special. I made the mistake of ordering a dish with eggs, potatoes and fish, seasoning was not spread out evenly and the food must have been in the steam table for a good six hours so the fish became so dry it had the texture of rubber, I could see the potential in it but I could not eat it and do what I rarely do, throw food away.

Place is clean, foods like chicken, potatoes, and rice is fresh while some others are not, prices are reasonable. Seasoning is not great and food is oily, would I come back? Probably not, would I recommend to someone who enjoys Portuguese food? Maybe."}
{"text":"This place has ok chicken, but the service is terrible. They treat their customers as nuisances, never venturing a hello or even a smile. The people behind the counter act as if they're doing you a favour by allowing you to order their chicken. They are not accommodating at all. They have the audacity to charge 50 cents for a thimble full of extra sauce. Most restaurants aren't losing boatloads (or any) money by giving a little extra sauce to go. 

If you pay cash, the receipt suddenly disappears. Why is that?

Lineups are too long and it's just not worth frequenting a place that really isn't that good."}
{"text":"I come here every other weekend when I don't feel like making dinner. Usually get the half chicken dinner with rice or fries and salad. Their chicken is tender and juicy and the spicy sauce that goes with it really adds to the flavor. Also love their fries! They can be addictive. Very affordable and the portions are huge too."}
{"text":"We were sick for two days with the stomach flu.  We had the family pack with their homemade sauce.  Everyone the next day had strong bouts of diarrhea.  We're staying away!"}
{"text":"Can't beat it for the price and quality. 2 types of sauces, a flavorful hot, and a nice subtle mild. Can get 1/4 or 1/2 chicken dinners with 2 sides for under 10$. Good chicken and rice, potatoes, home made fries, veggies, and desert. Also have whole chicken dinners and fish dinners, which I have not tried. 

Update: lately the chicken portions have become smaller and smaller.
3.5/5"}
{"text":"Awesome chicken nice spicy taste and spiced fries are awesome. 
Have to try there ribs and Chechen in future visits. 
Haven't been back to Swiss Chalet trying Brasas.
Generous portions an good pricing."}
{"text":"Best portuguese chicken in the area, better than all the piripiri chicken places around as well 
\"Hot\" sauce instead of mild for more taste. I usually go with the half chicken dinner with potatoes and rice. Good portions, great flavour and friendly staff."}
{"text":"So first off-the hours on Yelp are wrong! Sad but true-the only day they are closed is Mondays.  We learned this the hard way, but no matter!  

We ordered a whole chicken, small round potatoes, and a small veggie.  Together it came to $25.00 or so.  We called ahead to make sure they were open, and when they answered, we put in an order so that by the time we drove over (takes 30 minutes from my place!) the chicken was ready.  We were told it takes 20-30 minutes for a whole chicken at dinner time! 

Well, the drive and wait was well worth it.  The chicken is moist, well-spiced at mild (you have a choice of mild, medium or hot), and very tender.  We ordered a side hot sauce which isn't to my taste (a bit oily) but still quite tasty.  

The potatoes were soft and fluffy, the veggies, boiled and tasteless, but we did it for \"healthy\" time.   Already thinking about next time!  Probably going to try the ribs and fries.   

TIPS:
*Call ahead for your take-out order, chicken is made to order-it takes time! 
*It's take-out only
*Closed on Mondays!"}
{"text":"Great BBQ chicken,moist  not dry like some,decent portion will fill the average person,price average! Service was not bad,cashier was pleasant,and store seems busy"}
{"text":"Best place around for chicken.  Always fresh.  The potatoes and rice are also great.  Their Pri Pri sauce is addictive- (Someone complained on their review about the hot sauce being oily, yet they buy a jar of it...wtf?!)
Not much room to eat at the location but def amazing take-out."}
{"text":"I've been to several Portuguese BBQ restaurants and I have to say this one, by far, is the best of them. I love that they cook the chicken on an open charcoal fired pit and because of that the chicken is moist and never dry. The potatoes, rice, salad and even the fish is outstanding!!! Trust me, you go once and you'll be hooked!"}
{"text":"The best portuguese BBQ i ever ate in my life and the price is really decent that high school students can afford it!"}
{"text":"I was introduced to this style of chicken a couple years ago. The prices are pretty reasonable considering the large portion size you are getting. The chicken is awesome with or without their house sauce (which comes in mild or hot.) I usually order their half chicken dinner which comes with two sides. I usually go for the salad and their potatoes (which are to die for, I might add) but sometimes I'll switch it up and get rice and salad with my chicken. The staff are pretty nice, and sometimes look a little stressed. This is probably because this place is so busy all the time, and the wait is totally worth it. Word to the wise, if you want a couple chicken dinner orders, call it in first so u don't have to wait through the line of 12-15 people with individual orders. My only complaint is that I feel like they could stay open longer, especially on weekends. Otherwise, this is my go-to spot for BBQ chicken and I highly recommend this place if you haven't tried it yet."}
{"text":"Love Portuguese chicken and this is definitely one of the best spots I've ever been to for it! Love it."}
{"text":"It's my first time here, So far it's the best Portuguese Chicken with Potatoes & rice reasonably priced $10.00 for a double leg dinner. Very tender & the sauce is excellent"}
{"text":"Brasas is basically a take out place with some standup counters along the windows should you choose to eat in. I had the 1/4 chicken with potatoes and vegetables. The chicken portion was small and not very flavorful on its own.  The piri piri sauce provided was a bit oily for my taste. Potatoes were a bit dry and not very plentiful. All in all the meal was ok, but not as nice as some in the area."}
{"text":"Quick review:

I wanted to try this place for ever, it is mainly a take out place with some seating, and it gets really Smokey in there, so I am not sure if I am ever going to dine in

Now to the good stuff

{"text":"Ever since I moved to sauga, I spent a lot of time reading insauga to see what's happening in my hood. One of the pages they had up on rotation was the top 5 rib places and lo and behold, one of them was close by my house! 

So I finally picked a day where I wasn't going to see anyone (read: I could sit at home in my fat pants) and decided to grab a rack of ribs for lunch. Lesson learned people: a rack of ribs for lunch for one person is redonk. It ended up being more like a rack of ribs for me and the mister for lunch and dinner and tomorrow's lunch.

Anyways, Brasas is a small little take-out joint with fresh ribs and chicken and egg tarts. You could also dine-in, but this place is quick food only, so no service. The place starts getting busy at the lunch hour, but they are efficient with the orders and seem to move at a good pace. The prices are quite a bit higher than I would've expected, but the food is GOOD. The amount of people that travel to that small plaza just for the food is a testament of how good it is. 

Note: they have two menus up for some reason, with different pricing, so I was confused and sad to have been charged the higher price. I expected as much, but if you want to raise your prices, take down the other large menu that's literally hanging above the pay area. 

The egg tarts were wonderful - flaky pastry with a lovely custard filling and the right amount of char on top. I found them a bit sweet, but everyone else in the household was impressed. 

I'm up for trying the chicken some time in the future, but would I grab a rack of ribs again? At that price, probably only for a special occasion."}
{"text":"Very disappointing experience. 

Ordered a half chicken with salad since they charge $1 more for steamed veggies ( mainly beans). 
Wanted water but they ran out (there is a convince store next door,  they could always stock up)

I asked for spicey but it wasn't hot at all,  asked for some more sauce to make it spicier but they wanted 50 cents extra.  Since I paid debit and didn't have change I just lived with it. 

Basically I had dry chicken without a drink that wasn't even spicey. Place is also a dump,  very unorganized. Only 3 seats for eating in"}
{"text":"Quick, hot and delicious! The price and portions give you a great value. The round potatoes are oily but delicious - you seem to it notice the grease. The hot peri peri is not too spicy. I usually get a whole chicken to serve with homemade sides for guests."}
{"text":"The food here is always good, when you pull up to the plaza you can smell the smoke from their rotisserie.

The only issue I have is that their hot sauce (which is amazing) is really oily, but the food doesn't taste as good without it.  Can't win lol 

Bought a jar of their hot sauce for home for $5 :)"}
{"text":"0* on service! Chicken is damn good, and I won't deny that it is the best I've ever had (Drake voice) BUT, service is HORRIBLE! As fast as they can work, they are far from friendly. I had a younger blond check me out at the cash. She was really rude, and tried to charge me 50 cents for piri piri sauce, 80 cents for a container, and I got a roll eye when I asked for a fork. Is it so hard to smile, or better yet inform someone nicely that it would cost more for an item without the sass? I don't even mind paying, I just despise poor customer service. What happened to manners? Its a shame, this place had to lose a star due to service. Honestly, chicken was sooo moist, flavorful, and worth every damn calorie."}
{"text":"It seems that when you want take out chicken we always go swiss chalet. Try this place. The chicken is roasted on a spit, the baby potatoes also roasted. You will not be disappointed. Tons on leftovers and equally good the next day"}
{"text":"Great take out place, not the friendliest but depends which day and who you get. You can call ahead your order which is nice. 

Normal is a line up to the door with amazing smells of roasting chicken.

The prices are good and the portions are huge. The potato balls and rice are nicely seasoned and cheap. The salad is pretty basic but large. Finally the chicken is moist, seasoned well and a good size. There is never enough sauce on it though. Their spicy isn't really spicy but it's delicious."}
{"text":"Question: what is the best for a super chilly Friday dinner?
Answer: fresh hot take-out! 

Once the temperature hits below 10degrees, I don't want to cook simply because my hands get icy cold from washing raw meat or vegetables (cannot use warm water to soak them). So especially on Fridays my laziness will peak and i just want to sit and wait for food to appear in front of me 

This is my first time going to Brasas and my friend warned me that it would be busy on Friday evenings so I called to place an order in the afternoon. 

I got to the restaurant at 5:20pm and there was a line-up at the order line already. But because I planned ahead I just walked straight to the pick-up line and there was just one person ahead of me . I had some time to look around and I was amazed at how many chicken they were cooking at the back (you will have to go and check it out yourself ). The guy was chopping the chicken at lightening speed too because they have so many customers

Ok back to the food! I got the family pack #2 which comes with two whole chicken, 1 rice, 1 salad and 1 french fries. 

For the french fries, you can substitute with round potato instead, which i did and I loved them!!

For the chicken I got one spicy and one non-spicy. Both tasted good and the chicken breast wasn't dry. The spicy one (I only tried a small piece) has a stronger garlic flavour to it. I asked them for the sauce on the side but they forgot. I should have checked when I picked it up. 

As for the salad, I got the Italian dressing but they do offer other type of dressings. Salad tasted fresh and they probably soaked the raw purple onion in cold water because it wasn't burning my throat. 

The only down side for this meal was that the rice was so so salty..i was hoping to taste more spices and herbs than just salt. I will give it a try again next time."}
{"text":"Hopefully an one off, brown salad was a total turn off to otherwise good chicken dinner."}
{"text":"2 stars off:
- they offer a quarter chicken dinner, but not available during dinner time??? Huh? Only half chicken dinner and bigger items.  Sounds like bait and switch to me.
- came in 15 minutes before closing and was rudely told that they closed everything down and there was no more food.  The why was the door open??

Will be going to other places where they actually sell what is on the menu and stay open per their published schedule."}
{"text":"Got a whole chicken and small round potatoes for dinner. After tax was 21 dollars, pretty good price. Potatoes were good, as what many people said. I remember the first 2 times I didn't like their potatoes, however this time was amazing that I almost ate all of them by myself. They took out a fresh tray when I was in line, maybe that was why they tasted better. Chicken was same as usual, skin a little crispy, dry meat. Not much flavoured. Ask for some hot sauce, that would help. As for service, yes, they were kind of rude but it's understandable that they try to work fast so everyone doesn't need to wait too long. Just make sure you know what to order. It's good for take out, only a few seats to dine in."}
{"text":"Twice now I've done large takeout orders-5+ chicken with rice and potatoes and twice now I've been accused of not paying for everything in my order. First time was a very large order -LRG rice/potatoes salad and 7+chickens. They didn't charge me for the salad or so I assume so when I went to pick up I was accosted about if I paid for that salad or not. I would assume if I ordered it with the rest of the food, I paid for it with the rest of the food. Apparently not. So I paid a second time for salad. But it didn't leave a good taste in my mouth, so I waited a bit to try this place again. Second time slightly smaller but still \"catering\" order. I didn't specify if it was mild or hot sauce so they offered both. I accepted , assuming it was free with the order but the young man put the jarred sauce in the bag. I guess you pay for those kind? He was giving it to me as in like here you go have a nice day- the lady freaked asking if I paid for them. I have no idea lady I just pay the total you gave to me! So she tells the guy to take the jars out and just give me a different container. Fine. Dandy. But again don't question me if I paid for stuff if you just rang up the total and I just gave you 150+ dollars. She made it sound like I told him to give me the jars of sauce like I'm trying to steal lol 

A lot of people have noted the food is good, and I agree. But the customer service is severely lacking. Train the employees correctly and then you don't have to bombard the customers about what and if I paid for everything..."}
{"text":"Location is a bit out of the way from the heart of Mississauga traffic given that it's away from 15 min away from square one. Easy to find however as it's on the corner of major roads. Spacious but all kitchen and line space. Very limited seating with stool bars for individuals for a quick bite. Primarily a take out location. Chicken is tender though on the slightly dry side, though well dressed with herbs and garlic and hints of charcoal taste that brings out the aroma. Can't put my finger on it, the piri piri sauce is slightly off for me in scent. Substitute the fries for the potatoes for +$1.50 is a must as the potatoes are well cooked and very flavourful. Service was fast and courteous, but curt and blunt. Portions were abundant for the family pack #1. Not a bad option in Mississauga, but not the best Portuguese Meal I've had around the GTA. Worth a go though. Dine away!"}
{"text":"I really like this place. Portions are massive and there is always a big line up because this place is in demand. Dunno what else to say, good food, good portions. Why would you go anywhere else?"}
{"text":"WOW, thee best Portuguese chicken joint I've ever tried.

The chicken was juicy, smokey and flavourful and as for the potatoes? Out of this world. The prices are decent for the amount of food you get. Everything is fresh! 

The reason I couldn't give this place the full house of reviews was due to an unfortunate customer service experience that I had to witness and in this case, Brasas did really poorly. 

The lady paying for her order ahead of me spent nearly $35 dollars on three individual plates of food. When she asked for a couple of forks to throw in the bag, the cashier told her they don't give out forks to people unless they order 'dinners'. She asked how she was expected to eat her lunch without any utensils and the cashier got a little snippy and with the rest of the crew jumping to her defence, they claimed that's just how it was and it was up the customer to find a fork. 

THAT'S RIDICULOUS. How hard off are you that you couldn't just give the lady a plastic fork? Would you rather your customers have a happy experience & come back to your restaurant or save half a buck on a fork.. C'mon. So having read this review.. Maybe keep that in mind if you're looking to eat your food on the go! 

But that won't nearly stop me from driving across town for those potatoes.. Bon appetite!"}
{"text":"So since my last review I've been here a few times. The service has been way better!! More smiles, fast efficient service, and they're even better on the telephone. Great improvement Brasas! Updating my review to 5/5!"}
{"text":"Came across this place on Yelp as I wanted to try a few Portuguese restaurants. 

I called in their largest order which is a Family #4 order. It comes with large salads/rice/potatoes, full rack rib and a whole chicken. Person who answered the phone seemed pleasant and helpful.

As I showed up I was very happy that I ordered in advance as this place was packed, which is always a good thing because then you at least know that the food is being replenish constantly.

People working their seemed very pleasant, a couple women greeted me with smiles. The place its self looks a little run down could use some modernizing but no big deal really.

The reason I gave this place 4 stars is because the packaging itself was terrible. It took me twenty minutes to drive home and there was oil everywhere! The girl packaging my food also didn't close the salad well and all the balsamic dressing was in the bag and the carton open.

I understand Portuguese food can be quite oily but then you need to figure out a better packaging system.

The food tasted okay nothing spectacular. I was surprised for it being spicy chicken it really was that spicy.. Maybe it's \"Canadian\" spicy..? I'm used to more seasoned food and it all seemed a little on the bland side.

I was a little shocked at the price as it came to $67 but when I actually took out all the food and put it in Tupperware it is enough for two dinners and we are a family of 4 so it was actually worth it.

I most likely won't be back as I want to try out other places.."}
{"text":"Normally I'm a fan but for some reason tonight's fare was definitely off.. the chicken was off the charts in terms of salt. It was so bad that we had to drink lots of water to dilute our systems after our meal! Think we will give this restaurant a break for a while. Hoping the owners take note of this review and that this is a one off mistake by the chefs!"}
{"text":"I'v been here many times especially on the weekends to get dinner with my family. The chicken here is by far so delicious and the potatoes, salad and rice are good as well. This Brasas is really good, and its always packed, which is a good sign.

Once you drive into the plaza, you will surely smell the chicken, and it will surely lead you in here. The chicken is so good and has so much flavour, its insane. I have yet to try the fish but im soo looking forward to it!"}
{"text":"Had the 1/2 chicken dinner with rice and potatoes. The food here is very good but you have to get the hot sauce on the chicken, the mild sauce just doesn't cut it. I got there about 30 minutes before close so there wasn't a lot of selection for sides. 

Watch out for the heavy front door."}
{"text":"Best Portuguese Chicken in the area hands down! What I like about this place is how consistent they are with their food. Chicken is never dry, rice is always cooked to perfection and so are the potatoes! Their other food options taste amazing as well. They never disappoint here!! Definitely give it a try !"}
{"text":"Tip:  For the extra $1.50, get the potatoes over the fries!  I've never had the fries, but the small, round potatoes were really good.

Note:  This is a TAKEOUT place.  It's a large, open area and an order counter with a cash register at one end.

Even though the chicken + potatoes were good, I cannot give this place 4*s due to the customer service.  P.S.  Aside from the extra $ for the potatoes instead of the fries, they charge you if you want your salad dressing...on the side.  I asked why and girl said it's for the container.  Seriously, factoring price for takeout containers is part of your business.  You shouldn't be nickel and diming patrons for a tiny ass condiment container!

I've never been here, so I naturally stand underneath the sign with the arrow that says \"Line Here For Service\".  Absolutely ZERO acknowledgement and after a customer who came after me, stands in front of a guy working behind the counter, he gets served before I do.  How does that make any sense?

Even though they were fully staffed, and seem to have a system in place, they need to be more proactive in their acknowledgement + service.

Again, chicken + potatoes were very good.  Salad was very mediocre, just iceberg lettuce chopped up with some tomatoes and sliced cucumber with some Italian dressing.  Nothing special.  Rice was ok, but again, didn't really stand out for me.

Stars are chicken + potatoes, but they need to step up in their customer service in order to get more stars!"}
{"text":"Solid home cooking and certainly good portions for the money. Service is getting friendlier maybe they are paying attention to the reviews!"}
{"text":"I wish I could give Brasas 5 stars but I simply cannot do it because of their service. The counter staff is never friendly, they always rush you and sometimes they mess up the order. We always order take out and most of the time they either don't put the extra sauce in the bag or forget to put the sauce on the chicken. It's getting annoying. They also give you attitude when you just come in (like, what the hell, I'm coming to get food, why do I have to call to announce my visit?). They want you to call and place an order in advance. FINE. Then when I do call, they say \"Just come in\" and hang up. Seriously? Ugh.
Having said that, this is the best place in Mississauga for Portuguese chicken, so we keep going back to Brasas, despite the grumpy owner and staff. All of their side dishes are very good as well. I just really wish they tried to be nice and courteous to their customers."}
{"text":"This review is based on the hot sauce!!! So good!! 
I just had it at a baby shower and I already want to get some more chicken just so I can dip it in that delicious sauce...."}
{"text":"I had an orgasm from this. It was my first time and it blew me away. Thank you for showing me what food was what it meant to be."}
{"text":"Best Portuguese chicken in Mississauga hands down.  It's moist and flavorful and their mild and hot sauce is finger lickin' good.. It really takes it to a new level.. Rice and potatoes are good and the salad is fresh.. I love the shrimp patties. Can't get enough of those.  Only problem is now that word of mouth is getting out, there's always a long lineup but it's do worth it."}
{"text":"This is an interesting place. I used to absolutely love this place, but I didn't know about other Portuguese chicken places back then. Since then, it's fallen, not just in comparison but because of the lack of customer service.

There's always a line here, but that's fine, it is what it is. What isn't cool is how I've seen other customers being treated. The idea of the customer always being right doesn't exist here, the customer isn't even remotely close to being right. I say this because I've watched the staff and I can only assume, manager? Yell at customers. Not cool.

Now that that's out of the way, let's move to the food! The potatoes here are amazing, I will admit that I still haven't found a place with potatoes cooked as well as they are here. They're quite fantastic.

The chicken on the other hand, was good for the first 5 or so visits, but in recent times it's been quite dry. Piri-Piri wise, it's tasty. But even the best piri-piri sauce can't make up for dry chicken.

I really did love this place. I was a loyal customer. I even work in retail, so I get it when people have bad days. But I don't take being treated like a lesser person or seeing other customers being treated like human garbage."}
{"text":"This place is very busy all the time.  Great Smokey bbq taste as you can see all the chickens on the rotisserie.  However, they seem to have a tough time dealing with the demand.  I saw an employee melt down and take it out on all the patrons in the store (who where there to pay them money in exchange for their food as advertised).  I left them feedback a week ago via email with no response. If it's too much trouble for you, for us to come and bother you for your food then I'll do you a favor and go elsewhere."}
