{"text":"Enjoyed Juilos on 7/17/16 had a shredded beef bowl and beef taco it was awesome and Patty the worker had awesome costumer service and a great attitude"}
{"text":"Love this place they have great food! They have a great staff and excellent service.They make really good Carne asada nachos."}
{"text":"I'm staying next door at the Super 8 and woke up wanting something that was filling, hopefully healthy, but not greasy and vegetarian.   I'm from LA and brown so Mexican away from home is rarely an option. Alas, I gave in and very happy not to be regretting it right now. There is no veggie option on the menu but the se√±or making me a burrito made it veggie and delicious. Affordable too!"}
{"text":"We came in big group they were closed. Anna saved the day. Took care everything. Excellent!"}
{"text":"The staff was so helpful and friendly I recommend  it. They got soooo good!!! Michelada made by its truly Anna"}
{"text":"Ate here while staying at Tuscany cuz I wanted some good home cooked food. The tacos are good, I recommend the carnitas with chile verde. It's more expensive than usual,but tasty"}
{"text":"It's a tough business when your combining with the greatest chefs and restaurants in the world... But the location in MGM is always going to be healthy. So the authenticity of Mexican food in a food court is always taken with a grain of salt (btw... As some salt people). The tacos were decent and the black beans and rice were also tasty. I'd come here again since the price was nice for the portions provided."}
{"text":"Food quality not that great. Ordered the carne asada bowl. But their carne asada was more like ground beef. Meat was very salty and way too much beans.. the beans overpowered everything.  Their shrimp bowl is very lemony and salty. Flavor isn't balanced with the portions of rice and lettuce and beans."}
{"text":"Employee isn't aware of this app.  I tried to explain 'check-in offer' but she kept saying no. There is no manager. You will never get this offer."}
{"text":"Staying nearby for a convention, we saw this place on Yelp and were impressed with the reviews. When we got to Ellis Island, it was kind of a sketchy place with way too loud music. The taco place was a tiny counter service joint. We ordered two tacos, chips and salsa and horchatas and proceeded to eat at one of the three dirty high top tables. The tacos were ok, horchatas were meh and the salsa was just cut up tomatoes. After this lackluster meal, we were in the bathroom all night with horrible stomach pains. Not recommended."}
{"text":"Customer service was excellent. Quality of food was disappointing. Overall I probably won't be coming here again. If you're stuck and need to eat I would eat here but other than that haha"}
{"text":"My friends got shooed away from the Ellis Island bar, so, as an act of solidarity, I decided to eat here, and oh man, I would have their carne asada burrito and horchata over $5 wings and fries any day of the week.  The portion was HUGE for $7, and you're free to peruse the casino with burrito in hand. If that's not a burrito to rule all burritos, then I don't know what is."}
{"text":"Me and my girls first time there we order  The ceviche is really good the chicken taco it's OK Asada ok ceviche is the best"}
{"text":"The food is fresh, the ladies are always really nice and accommodate my requests. They have a pretty good Mexican beer selection and Mandarin Jaritos."}
{"text":"Fresh, flavorful food. Staying at the Westin and walked here for a quick bite. It's stuck in an old cheap hotel but it was a pleasant surprise. I had the barbacoa salad and my friend had the barbacoa tacos. Great lunch for $8."}
