{"text":"I have been here about 8 times now and I honestly dont understand the bad reviews. Staff are very friendly and pork bone soup is consistent. It isn't the fanciest or the most delicious, but certainly great enough to keep me going! Plus, the old place seemed dirty but this place is not only clean, but you can see a lot of the kitchen, which makes me feel better about the overall hygiene"}
{"text":"missing Danji which used to be my go to for pork bone soup, sadly it was replaced by seoulicious. decided to give this new place a try and i was so disappointed that at noon on a Saturday they are  sold out on pork bone soup! really ? already?  i ordered tonkatsu instead and it waa pretty dry. nothing special.  my husband ordered a bulgogi bowl and the beef looked so pale and again nothing special.  overall i am not going back here.  food is so so, i miss danji!"}
{"text":"The food was great and we had the sweetest server. Three of us got a garlic & bacon pancake to share, and then two spicy pork bowls and a tofu soup. We loved the place and would recommend it based on the food and service, not to mention its affordability. What a lucky find"}
{"text":"Better than the Korean restaurants in koreatown. Deserves a much higher rating than they have now. Food is fresh, good portions, more unique than the usual Korean home cooking, perfect salt levels (most restaurants are over seasoned). Had the pork bone soup, spicy rice cakes (as good as what I've had in LA koreatown which is saying something) and pork belly."}
{"text":"Good flavouring. To be honest as a south-estern Chinese I do not like Korean food a lot because i don't like the combination of spicy, salty and sour. Usually the flavor of Korean Food is just too heavy for me. But this restaurant really gives me another impression of Korean food. wow, the flavor of the bulgogi is just good as perfect and it is not dry at all, which I believe I can eat 2 bowls of rice with it. But still I don't like the side dishes and the soup which is included in the combo. Maybe it will be better if I can choose whether I need them."}
{"text":"This restaurant is ridiculous. I can't believe how can they be so shameful. I ordered a soon tofu stew for takeout. And guess what?  only 1/3 bowl has thing in it, which is 1/3 height of a white plastic spoon.  The onion isnt cooked at all. And I told them that I will come back in 10 mins to pick it up, when i'm back, the chef was sitting there doing nothing. Didn't start to cook mine until I came back and told them I'm here to pick up what I ordered. ALSO, their side dish is soooo bad. like... the kimchi is not even kimchi, it's just raw cabbage with spicy sauce. Don't even go. What a waste of money."}
{"text":"Ordered platter and the seafood pancake. It was very mediocre. The meat is diced up in small little pieces in the platter and the flavour was just okay. You get variety of meat and flavours, but I have been to much better korean restaurants/bars. As for the pancake, the batter was flaky and crusty, not very good at all. Would not go back."}
{"text":"On Nov 12th, I took out LB rib and Kimchi pancake. Kimchi pancake is totally burnt (black area more than 80% in the reverse side - I guess they pack like this on purpose to hide that burnt side). I just dumped it all because it was 8 PM and I do not wanna go back with my burnt Kimchi pancake and complain. It is good if you sit there and eat."}
{"text":"This Korean restaurant opened really recently and replaced one of our old-favourite go-tos, Danji. I'm surprised there aren't any reviews on here yet -- there are a few on google and they were all positive, so we went to try it late on Saturday night.   They changed the interior quite a bit -- it's much more modern now, which is nice. They definitely haven't stopped decorating yet because the walls were bare and there were tools lying around. Everybody who works there seems to be really young, even the cooks. The service was friendly and attentive, and i like the way the food was presented on individual trays.. but unfortunately that's where the positive ends..   We ordered the pork bone soup and the bulgolgi bowl. This is the only Korean restaurant that i've been to that didn't ask us or have spicy options -- that was super disappointing. The pork bone soup was supposed to be spicy but it wasn't. When the soup came, it looked good, and it looked like there was so much meat it was like a mountain.. but when I got to it, they were big pieces of bone without that much meat on it. The soup base was so plain. There weren't any other things in it other than the meat and some bean sprouts, no potato, no other little pieces of vegetables or spice that they used. It was very \"liquidy\" and just salty. The bulgolgi bowl was an even greater disappointment -- my partner said he would only give it a 1 star, but that's also because he usually orders his dishes spicy but there was no option. The flavour was blah. It tasted like they just marinated it in plain soy sauce and some sugar and cooked it up with some zucchini. The side dishes were also not great, and they started us off with some \"salad\" which was literally a chunk of lettuce (mine was barely chopped up, and i got the core) and some ginger dressing.. nothing else!  Overall, if it weren't for the friendly staff and the interesting dynamic of a very young group that seems to run the restaurant, this place deserves a 2 for the food. It was really disappointing and sub-par on all levels. With other Korean food options nearby (and i should mention, this place has a slightly higher price point than others), I don't think we'll be returning."}
{"text":"This restaurant was recommended by my friend so I went there and tried their pork bone soup. My friend ordered fried pork cutlet. I really like the soup since I cannot eat too spicy so the staff made it mild for me. Not too oily and very tasty. Their kimchi is really good. I ate three dishes. Overall, I'll recommend it to my other friends."}
{"text":"I live in Vancouver and I know good Korean food! Unfortunately this place was not good. Here is why! Tofu soup was super oily, I felt sick after I ate it. Too much oil, not enough tofu. All the assortments that it came with were super tiny, they should not have bothered with it. Rice was decent, fluffy and all. Customer service was slow although place was not busy. Price was high for what I got! Overall would not recommend."}
{"text":"Had their pork bone soup today.  I've had fall-off-the-bone pork bone from Yummy BBQ.  Pork bone from Seoulicious was not fall-off-the-bone, I had to struggle for the meat in between bones.  Portion was small for $13.  They also put the soup in a clear plastic bag for takeout, which seemed weird to me."}
{"text":"Worst korean food ever. Tasteless and cannot compare to owe. Food overpriced, not worth it."}
{"text":"These place is recently opened they took over Danji restaurant. So, I went in for lunch and give it a try even though the price is way more expensive from Danji cause I'll pay more for good food. Ordered pork bone soup, taste is totally different from lots of other places pork bone soup not as flavored and spices. Lack of something for sure. I would say is more modern and fusion pork bone soup. For $14-$15 include tips for a pork bone soup is totally a rip off. Danji been selling it for like $9 include tips. Paying $14 in this area there is more better choice to eat around the area. They gotta raised down the price or have lunch specials for people's who work around here cause there is another Korean restaurant 2 mins walk from seoulicious better pork bone soup and cheaper price. Saw some reviews said they made the kimchi better but that is just a side dish."}
{"text":"I do not understand the poor reviews in here... I've been to this place for three times and my experience was great.  I was craving for some Korean rice cake one day that my boyfriend and I happened to discover this new place around the neighbourhood. It was around 5-6pm and the place was almost packed. We ordered a Spicy Rice Cake with bulgogi and a Spicy Pork Hot Plate suggested by the two ladies sitting right next to us. The food came in around 10-15 minutes that was efficient as it was packed. I just instantly fell in the rice cake, so does their spicy pork.  Do not expect authentic Korean cuisine but do appreciate their Western-modified/modern flavoured dishes. I have never tried Danji that was replaced by them and unsure about the pricing. But don't compare and rate this new place with the old one!   I find their food reasonably priced with the newly renovated interior and their quality utensils. Say competitors like Miss Korea on Yonge, this place serves decent food and nothing crappy. Love their black sesame salad dressing! One point to be mindful is that their food are relatively spicy (just a little when compared to most korean place), wish that they'll ask if you want it mild, medium, or regular.   I had never experienced any unpleasant issue such as dirty cups. All three visits had been wonderful and servers are extremely nice and helpful (though they may missed your wave sometimes as they stand behind the cashier chitchatting).  Overall experience has been perfect for my 3-times visits! Love this place!"}
{"text":"Since Toronto is getting cold pretty soon, I got my favourite kimchi stew! Like any other traditional korean restaurant, the meal was served with side dishes. Seoulicious only gives three side dishes: kimchi, these glass noodles with soya sauce, and picked radish which is a step down from other restaurants but they do still do free refills. They also place the meal on a tray for you when they bring it to you. I think this makes it easier for you to eat (AND NOT SHARE YOUR SIDE DISHES) and for them to take it away.  The kimchi stew was a much smaller portion that what I was expecting. The hotpot contained an abundance of onions and kimchi and an underwhelming serving of pork. I usually get kimchi stew since in other restaurants, the pork has very little fat and it's cooked just right. This kimchi stew had 5-6 chunks of pork fat with a small piece of meat on it.They serve the stew with a pretty good size of white rice which was warm.  My sister finished her meal first but I was still eating but the servers brought the bill when we didn't ask for it yet. I felt like the server was trying to rush us out (?) by bringing the bill so early on. The restaurant wasn't too busy as well so I'm not sure why they did that."}
{"text":"Open late at night, Seoulicious is the bomb for midnight dinners when it's a no go for pub food. My friend introduced me to it after we finished our Black Friday shopping.  Luckily, we didn't have to fight for seats.  It wasn't too packed, but there was a constant stream of customers.  Therefore, you know it's probably not too hyped, but it's still highly revered in the area.   The chefs serve standard Korean fare in a more modern setting. The lighting is dim, the tables are black, there are extra lighting fixtures in the corner, and the servers adorn black outfits.  The interior is not over the top, but it's a pleasant alternative to the usual wooden and brown interiors of Korean restaurants (at least from the ones I've visited).   Here, you will find your usual pancakes, ddukbokki, bibimbap, and hot plates. They are reasonably priced compared to other Korean restaurants in the downtown core.  They are certainly not cheap eats, but you would have spent the same or more at a pub anyway.   We ordered the ddukbokki, LA ribs, and Spicy Pork. The latter two came with individual side dishes instead of shared ones, a bowl of rice and a miso soup. All of them were flavourful and large in portion-size. I especially loved my spicy pork because the meat was cut into smaller pieces, thus allowing the sauce to be more noticeable with every bite. My only gripe that night was with the LA ribs because they were overdone. They weren't burnt, but they were unbearably chewy.  If you like your ribs tender, then pass on this one.   There are actually 4 levels of spiciness. My server recommended me to stick with what he called ''regular''. I was initially against it because I thought it would be too mild, but lo and behold, the ''regular'' spiciness was definitely a hot one. It wasn't mild and it wasn't over the top. It was the standard spicy kick you get at Korean restaurants in Toronto. If you're good with spiciness but not an extremist, stick with ''regular''.  Seoulicious is a pretty fail-safe spot for Korean grub. It doesn't have outstanding prices and food quality.  However, they're all fair.  There's really no distinguishable factor between this establishment and others, except for the interior.  It's open late at night, though, so It's a solid option if you're craving Korean munchies after a long day."}
{"text":"Not bad but not great either.. i was a bit disappointed to be honest i ordered the bulgogi below which took a look time before to get served and waitress said it would be spicy but it was not spicy and was actually lacking of flavor, perhaps they forgot my order and had it rushed... I don't know meal was well presented and the place look great. But rather be impress by the taste next time..."}
{"text":"Seoulful korean food? Eh, somewhat. I really wanted to love this place but with each bite I took from my meal, I found everything mediocre. I came here with a friend of mine around 6 pm and the interior was very dark but was lit with candles at every table. Service here was quick, we always had our water filled and our food arrived in orderly time. I ended up ordering the bulgogi bowl ($11) as I saw many photos of it on yelp. Furthermore, my friend and his friend decided to split the seafood spicy ricecake ($12).  BULGOGI BOWL: Everything (Miso soup, three side dishes and the main dish) was served on a cafeteria tray which took me to surprise. The bulgogi bowl itself was quite large and a generous amount of rice is given. Thankfully the bulgogi wasn't dry and it was lightly seasoned however; I wished it had more flavoring as I was expecting it to be very marinated. The bowl also includes vegetables, however; I had an ABUNDANCE of onions and a little cabbage which was very disappointing.  Furthermore, three side dishes were included with each dish, they included: kimchi, fish cake, and radish (?) in some type of sauce (I only tried the kimchi). Normally whenever I go to korean restaurants, they offer at least six side dishes so seeing only three was a disappointment. Personally, I didn't like the kimchi. Yes it had the spice factor but I found it to turn bland after munching on it. I like it when kimchi has an after taste of it being either sweet or sour; but this had none of the above.  SEAFOOD SPICY RICECAKE: Not terrible, but lacked seafood. There was enough spice, a good amount of rice cakes (shared among three people), but spotting any seafood was difficult. When I took a bite out of the rice cakes, it had the seafood flavour but there was literally no sight of seafood in the dish. I found one mussel, one hoop of squid, and there were a few pea sized clams.   Unfortunately, nothing was out of the ordinary and would not come back."}
{"text":"Had a craving for bimbimbap for dinner and decided to give their's a try. Ordered the takowasabi, hot stone bimbimbap and a pork bone soup for two. Takowasabi is extremely spicy, beware if you're used to the ones at nome or guu! Not much to say about the hot stone bowl as it was quite bland (ended up squeezing multiple spoonfuls of hot sauce into it) and wasn't hot enough or the rice was over cooked. Overall, friendly staff, clean interior but mediocre food."}
{"text":"Overpriced, consider that you can get a meal at K-down only cost around $10 per person with higher quality and bigger portion and the variety of side dishes are a lot more at K-town"}
{"text":"A fairly \"modern\" Korean restaurant, with interesting choices of drinks and food, and nice side dishes too. Prices are very competitive and reasonable for the area. In particular, their hot plates and soups are amazing for a cold winter's day meal while their cold noodles can be super refreshing in the summertime. Portions are average, maybe on the smaller side, so splitting an appetizer can be a good idea. Their pancake is also quite different and good to try out as a starter.  Staff are attentive and quite helpful at explaining the menu. Food comes quickly and people tend to leave within an hour."}
{"text":"Like many of the reviewers here, I was upset to see DanJi go, as there aren't very many Korean comfort food restaurants nearby, but I was quickly comforted to see that another Korean restaurant simply took its place. Overall, I think it's an improvement over DanJi though the quality of the food doesn't match the Korean restaurants over in Koreatown. However, if you do have a craving for Korean food, this should hit the spot.  The decor of the place is the biggest change from DanJi, and instead of the mom and pop feel, it actually looks clean and modern. It is primarily a restaurant at night but it is also a good choice to have drinks, as they have set up the restaurant as a bar/restaurant sort of vibe, similar to Miss Korea nearby. Overall the food is slightly better than Miss Korea and serves a lot more food options, not too far off from DanJi's menu.  I ordered the beef soup (yukgaejang) and pork belly - yes I ordered two entrees for myself cause I was hungry, but the portions were in line with what you'd be served at other Korean restaurants. The food comes in a tray in silverware and actually looks kinda... nice? I'm used to Korean food looking very homemade but they seem to actually have put in some effort into the visual presentation. They don't give nearby as many side dishes as the other Korean places but you're always free to ask for more refills.  The taste of the food was ok. The pork belly was a little too salty, and a bit confusing to eat. They gave me salted pork belly with raw green onions and onions and grilled garlic, but no ssamjang, and instead got a chunk of Kimchi pork. Maybe I didn't eat it the way it's meant to be eaten, but I usually consider ssamjang to be a staple with grilled pork belly. Mind you, I didn't bother to ask as I was too hungry, I'm sure they would've had some. The beef soup was ok, more spice than flavour, but wasn't bad and hit the spot anyway.  Overall, I had a good experience at Seoulicious and would likely return. Note though that they stop serving food after 11:30pm or so and turns primarily into a bar, so make sure you come before then if you want to have a meal. I'm curious to see what their drinking experience is like, and will likely return for that on a night when I can afford to be hungover next day."}
{"text":"Seoulicious is a huge downgrade from the prior restaurant of the same location, Danji. Although a much more 'modern' interior, it struggles to deliver the quality of Korean food that is expected, especially from a restaurant that is named after the capital of Korea. Seoulicious maintained the Japanese fusion style of Danji; they now serve a Japanese style salad commonly seen in Japanese restaurants, but I have to say it does not have any freshness (understandable considering they have all their appetizers pre-made and the salad soaked in dressing before it's served)."}
{"text":"Disgusting. They are new. The soup had no taste. Did a takeout - threw it away. Don't waste your money."}
{"text":"I was kinda sad to see Danji go but I was glad it is another Korean restaurant that took over.   The decor is very modern chic. You'll be greeted by pretty boys dressed neatly. Anyhow that doesn't affect my ratings on this place.   My first experience with them was a takeout pork bone soup. I waited about 10-15 mins for my order which was fine considering they're still trying to get things together. Once home I was excited to try my food. Holy plastic bag in a styrofoam takeout container. It was kinda hard to get every time out without making a mess.   Once everything was on a bowl I had my first spoonful of the soup. Yum! It was delicious and I couldn't stop drinking the soup. The pork was soft and every piece fell off the bone. It's a sign the pork was executed perfectly. I have no complaint or whatsoever on the spiciness level. It was just right. I'd say it's on the medium level.   Overall I'm impressed with Seoulicious because my pork bone soup was delicious. I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Had a really good meal and excellent service We had the seoulicious platter...a must!   Also the soft tofu soup was great.  Wish to have korean restaurant like this in Montreal"}
{"text":"I don't get the bad reviews on here. I walked by this place and decided to give it a shot and I was amazed by how much effort the cooks/staffs put in to this place to make this place decent.  First of all, I love the music selection here. They play music that are similar to Starbucks, which is classic and peaceful. It's honestly hard to find a restaurant in Toronto that plays good music nowadays. It's something different that I very much appreciate about this place, since I am so sick and tired listening to loud trashy Rap all the time everywhere else.  Secondly, they served me complimentary salad which I pretty sure the salad dressing is house-made. And I gotta say the salad tastes amazing, honestly the best salad I've ever had in my life taste-wise. Also I ordered the Pork-Bone soup, the portion was huge, it looked good and it comes on a tray with all the appetizers that were also free. I was surprised by how much items I can get when I was just paying $12 for my meal.  I'm certainly going back."}
{"text":"Had a crave for soft tofu, so I went and tried their seefood soon tofu. Tofu was very soft and I love it. I have never had a chance to tried Danji, so there is nothing to compare. Wish they have a bigger portion though."}
{"text":"Came here on my birthday with some friends last month.  Service was efficient for our group of 8.  Food was delicious and servings were large - I had the bibimbap with beef bulgogi and a soju cocktail.  The bibimbap flavour was delicious, beef portion could ha e been larger.  We had brought a cake and they cut and plated without an extra charge. Importantly, I was able to catch up with my friends in a relaxed and friendly environment - we stayed for some time and the staff didn't mind.   Thanks for a delicious birthday dinner!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to eat in the Yonge/Wellesley area. It's quick. The food tastes good. It's priced reasonably and the portions are exactly right.  Having said that: I've been here probably 5 or 6 times now...and I've had only one dish. I really enjoy the kimchi fried rice here. So much so that I basically haven't ordered anything else here. It's spicy, but not overly crazy. There are bits of pork belly in the fried rice...and if I counted correctly one time, it's exactly 3 pieces =) . Not enough that I can't share with someone who is vegetarian and will eat food once the meat has been removed. But so small and few in between that it's difficult to spot. They do keep it somewhat dark in the restaurant, so it's hard to find the pieces of meat . So I have since decided to order it and ask that they just leave out the pork belly. I've also tried their juices. The rice and the pear drinks are both delicious and valuable...we'll get back to why this is.  We've also tried some other stuff as well (just that it wasn't ordered by me!). I will give a warning though. It can be very spicy. This is where the value of the rice drink or the pear drink comes in. The rice drink reminds me of ones I've had growing up. I just never knew that it cuts down the spiciness of the food as well as it does. If you eat something here and find yourself thinking no amount of water is helping..give the drink a try. You're welcome! (j/k)"}
{"text":"I was gonna say a lot but this place doesn't deserve my time. Got a cup of hot tea, the cup was dirty and there was a little piece of Korean noodle stick on the outside where my mouth touched. Disgusting. Ordered a pork bone soup, and waited for about 30 mins when there were only 4 people who had been eating already. Only 3 side dishes, tastes bad af. I have never had such salty kimchi before, and they didn't look fresh at all. And the pork bone soup...so disappointed! The pork was COLD inside! What the heck. I can't believe it. And there was too much peppers/spices on top, as if the lid of the pepper shaker came off and they dumped the whole thing on it. Waited for another 20 mins to get a warm one. I should have just left when they served me cold meat."}
{"text":"Was looking to feed my Korean crave in Toronto and this really hit the spot. Some really good combo options and decent beer prices."}
{"text":"My heart broke when I heard Dan Ji closed down and was replaced. I came out of respect for Dan Ji to see what it's been replaced with. Everything on the inside looks exactly the same, just more modern. The food now comes in trays, which is weird and seems gimmicky to me. The side dishes I didn't even really touch. The beef stew I ordered had pieces of beef that were tough af. And to top it all off everything is quite overpriced."}
{"text":"Affordable and quick Korean dining. I had the Kimchi fried rice which was quite tasty! There's also a few bits of pork belly but not enough to really notice the flavour. Would probably come back again if I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"Yonge Street has needed a decent Korean restaurant for a while.  Most of the places are low quality and dirty.  I appreciate that Seoulicious is raising the bar.  So far I have tried the kamjatang (pork neck bone soup) and dol sot bibimbap (rice, vegetable and egg hot plate) with pork belly.  Both were excellent.  The restaurant is young, clean and hip.  The service is prompt and attentive.  The prices are competitive."}
{"text":"THE WORST FOOD I'VE EVER HAD THE AGONIZING TASK OF CONSUMING (using the word eating would be an insult to food). I told my friend that I was craving spicy chicken. He was quite excited to take me here and I was looking forward to a delicious meal. After a treacherous walk in the pouring rain, we finally arrived to this dump. After being seated, we had to ask for water not once, not twice, but three times. I ordered the spicy chicken bowl. It appears they are unaware of the definition of bowl. Despite the misleading name this was the sweetest (key word not spicy) chicken I've had the misfortune of eating. After only one bite, I threw up in the washroom. This establishment needs to be referred to a dictionary because their menu is FAKE NEWS. I wouldn't even recommend this restaurant to my worst enemy. Don't advertise spicy if you don't mean it as I'm sure I'm one of MANY who has had a similar experience. The staff were quite rude and inattentive which was shocking as they were empty (no surprise there). My friend had the misfortune of ordering the bulgogi and it was completely undercooked. We are currently at a walk in seeing a specialist who is actually qualified for their line or work. I give this place six months before they go under. Soju was ok."}
{"text":"5-star worthy!! Living in New York, there is some good Korean food in Korea town on 32nd street, but nothing beats Korean food in Toronto.  Seoulicious is another example of awesome taste for a very reasonable price.   I ordered the Seoulicious Platter which came with a combination of sausage, spicy pork, spicy chicken and bulgogi.  But the best thing on the platter was the grilled pineapple!  If they sold grilled pineapple as a side, I would have ordered more.  The food came really quick and the amazing smell matched the taste.  I also ordered the Korean Pear juice which was so good. The service was excellent with very attentive servers.  I will come here when I come to town again, thank you Seoulicious team."}
