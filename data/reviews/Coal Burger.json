{"text":"Veggie burgers suck. Decided to try something new today... I totally regret that decision.  We got two different ones and they are horrible not to mention they took 20 minutes to get out and there were only two other tables there.  I won't be visiting there again... EVER"}
{"text":"I like the idea of this place but I fear it has fallen short of my expectation; a little too much 'conscience' and 'eco-ness' has gotten in  the way of producing a tasty burger and fries. The bacon blue burger when asked  to cook it medium rare was delivered with very little taste and not medium rare. If it were not for the blue cheese I don't know if I could honestly say it was a tasteful burger at all. The french fries were fresh and cooked well, however the rice bran oil that they're using that is supposedly full of antioxidants provides for a very bland result.  Sorry Coal Burger, not this time."}
{"text":"Overpriced mediocre food...save your taste buds and wallet!"}
{"text":"Dined at the Coal Burger for the first time last night in Chandler AZ.  I am sorry to say that this is one of the worst experiences I have had at a burger restaurant. Where to start.  My wife had the Asian chicken salad.  lettuce was wilted, the oranges were bad/rancid, and the chicken looked like it came out of precut/precooked bag you get from Costco.  Nothing \"Fresh\" about that.  As for our burgers I was told that they would be cooked Medium.  They were over done, dry and no flavor.  We got the 1/4lb burgers, they were small to begin with but putting it on the large platters make it even look smaller.  We got got the green chile and BBQ burger.  Us and another family were the only ones there and the staff mixed up the order with the other family.  I'd hate to see what they do if it ever gets busy.  We were all still hungry after that horrible experience that we thankful that there was an In and Out across the street where we went after and enjoyed some really great burgers at half the cost.  I really love Grimaldi's Pizza but will pass on Coal Burger."}
{"text":"-Service was very good. -Chicken Burger was terrible. No flavor and very small for the price they charge. -Harvest Salad was very good...would've been better if they didn't forget to put the goat cheese and roasted beets on them as it was described and I was expecting fresh grilled chicken breast meat, not precooked and cold."}
{"text":"Nothing special here, burgers were not anything out of the ordinary. And for the price....Thanks but no thanks, i will stick to making my own."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time the other day and thought it was awesome. The burgers themselves are very good. I had the bacon cheeseburger and my only complaint is that it does not come with tomatoes and the 1/4lb burger can be a bit small if you are really hungry. We also had an order of fries. I didn't think they were anything spectacular but were still good. Finally I had a Black and White milkshake. Despite the fact that they were out of whipped cream it was AWESOME.   A few other items of note from my visit - I love the fact that they use grass fed beef in their burgers and they soft drinks they serve are made with cane sugar and not HFCS!  The only downside is they are pricier than fast food burger places but since their product is better quality and cooked fresh, I don't mind. Overall I would definitely recommend visiting this place if you have 10-15 min to sit down and wait for a FRESH burger."}
{"text":"The food was terrible and cooked unevenly half the burger was raw and the other half was stemming hot. Must be the coal oven.  Over priced was well and lacking fresh fixings.  I wish I had went to IN and OUT instead."}
{"text":"The vegan review sounded a bit OCD to me, but to each their own. We are in agreement with many of the comments here ... uncomfortable dining room, a tad expensive, well done burgers (no choice on how they are cooked? ... what's up with that at a higher end burger joint?). The natural soda pop was great and the sweet potato fries also were very good. No patio ... that's a problem especially with heavy A/C. They did try to take our plates a million times. Overall, a fair to crappy experience. Was hoping for more and unfortunately, we will not be back."}
{"text":"I was really excited to go to Coal Burger. I believe in what they stand for and was excited about being able to get natural / hormone free meats.  Unfortunately, it wasn't up to par with my expectations.    First, the GOOD:  + The milkshake was absolutely to die for.  If I was craving a milkshake, I would go back for this reason alone.   + I also liked the natural sodas.  If you have ever had a soda from a home soda fountain, that is what it tastes like. My husband disagreed, however, and really missed the ability to get a Diet Coke. (he went with the iced tea which was also good). + Employees were friendly and manager stopped by to check on my 3 year old daughter several times + Fries (we got half reg & half sweet potato) were pretty good and definitely tasted lighter due to the type of oil CB uses. (no icky film in your mouth from the grease ala McDonald's!)  The NOT so GOOD: - The burger was just OK, nothing to rave about (a little overdone, dry, not a lot of flavor)  - CB doesn't have any fresh tomatoes, only roasted tomatoes.(Yes, Really!) This was a big one for me, and I heard someone else comment on this while I was there. - I got the \"chicken club burger\" and it was GROUND chicken and flavorless.  I was really expecting a grilled chicken breast.  Maybe I didn't read the description right, but because other places I have been to that referred to a chicken burger served chicken breasts that is what I expected. - I felt like it was a little overpriced compared to other (better) burger places.  For $32 we got: 1 burger, 1 chicken burger, 1 half & half fries, vanilla milk shake, 2 fountain drinks. (disclaimer, not super expensive, but food wasn't great and other burger places are a few $$ less - and better)  Long story short: there are too many other good places to eat (burger and non-burger) in Scottsdale.  I won't visit CB again.  If I want a burger I will go to Smash Burger or even 5 Guys which are much better in my opinion."}
{"text":"The food was generally awful. The sweet potato fries were the only good thing I ate. The chicken sandwich I ate was very dry, and service was not the best. What should have tipped me off was all the other restaurants around were filled and had 20 to 40 minute waits, but Coal Burger wasn't even half-full. Won't return to this place ever. They should cut there loses and close their doors and let another business have a shot here in the Scottsdale Quarters."}
{"text":"Well, VERY pricey. Burgers not very impressive at all. Sweet potato fries were the highlite of the stop. Odd selection of soda's on the fountain too. I'll pass and wont be back."}
{"text":"CONFESSION ALERT - I went twice in one week! First time I had the good ol' Classic Coal Burger w/o cheese, sauce on the side and sweet potato fries. Amazing! I wasn't disappointed in the least bit. I did order the smaller version, which I appreciated was even an option. Not everyone needs a burger the size of your face. (my opinion ...)    Second time I visited ... AKA three days later. I tried the \"Other Coal Burger\" which is the vegetarian version with black beans, rice, and veggies. Pretty good but a little dry. I asked for a side horsey sauce. Made it 10x better!   As far as cost is concerned  I think it is VERY reasonable considering the quality of the food and environment. I think it competes with In N Out Burger (across the street) but better tasting food!   First Visit - $8.00 Second Visit - $9.00  Quality and good tasting costs ... And is WORTH it!"}
{"text":"After reading the reviews about this place, we were a bit nervous.  But, we love Grimaldi's and the concept behind Coal Burger.  They use organic grass fed beef and promote a green style of food production.   We ordered a couple of Cheese Burgers for the kids, Green Chile Burgers for the adults and some fries and sweet potato fries.  The burgers are probably around 4 to 5 ounces which is an appropriate serving.  All of us also chose a whole wheat bun.  After about  5 minutes, our food came out.  It looked good, smelled good and most importantly tasted really good!  The burgers were cooked medium, cheese melted and gooey and the buns were the perfect size for patty.  The green chilies added some nice flavor.  The sweet potato fries were o.k..  I find that they are often dry wherever we go.  The french fries on the other hand were great-cooked to a slight crisp and perfectly salted. I think some people might not be used to taste or the price of a grass fed burger. They have less fat, more nutrients and just are not the same as a grain fed burger.  I also think the first reviewers might have suffered from going right after the place opened.  I believe you need to give a place time figure it out before venturing inside.  All in all a solid meal."}
{"text":"Happy to have an organic, grass fed option when I want a burger. Steak burger is really good and I like the salads."}
{"text":"My wife and I are always looking for new restaurants in our area to try so tonight after our son's swim class we decided to try Coal Burger.  First the positives: The decor was nice and inviting. The staff was friendly, although they seemed to lack knowledge and confidence (I'll chalk this up to it being a new restaurant). The menu has a decent selection touting fresh ingredients, homemade sauces, etc. They have a great soft drink selection with everything sweetened with cane sugar, although no name brand sodas.   Now on to the bad stuff: It was pricey, we spent just over $30 to feed two adults and a 2 1/2 year old. I don't mind spending the money if the food is worth it but this was not. My wife ordered the Chicken Club Burger which came with a ground chicken patty. The patty was dry and over seasoned. After a few bites she couldn't eat any more and spoke with the manager who graciously exchanged it for something else (points for customer service). We were later informed that a lot of people send that particular burger back which begs the question, why is it still on the menu? Or at least why don't they use a chicken breast like most restaurants? I ordered the 1/2lb BBQ Burger which was ok but nothing special. It was very greasy, which was a surprise for a resturant that touts itself as a healthier burger option. The bun was so soggy, from grease and sauce, that after a couple of bites it completely fell apart. We ordered the Kids Grilled Cheese for our son which ended up simply being a slice of \"Kraft\" style American cheese thrown on a hamburger bun. More bread than cheese and certainly not worth the $4 we paid for it. Finall the GM was there and she clearly made the staff skiddish and on edge, it was actually quite uncomfortable to watch which didn't help the dining experience.  Overall, I won't eat here again, which is too bad because I really wanted to like the place. In my humble opinion if you're going to spend this much for a burger and fries (which you have to purchase separately) go to Five Guys or a sit down joint like Red Robin/Chili's. Much better bang for your buck."}
{"text":"Good tasting burgers, decent sweet potato fries, and awesome fountain choices (cane sweetened colas). A little overpriced. Wasn't a fan of the $5 milkshake and the manager/owner gave me attitude. Come on now, $5 milkshakes better be worth it!"}
{"text":"The veggie burger is vegan!  It was pretty good.  Not the best I've ever had, but definitely good.  The sweet potato fries are fantastic!  Love the concept of this place.  They have natural cane soda and stevia to sweeten the tea.  The staff was very welcoming and helpful.  I will be frequenting this restaurant in the future!"}
{"text":"Let me first say, I am a foodie, and I eat out a lot!!  For as often as I eat here, you would think I would give it 5 stars, (I AM the Duchess of Coal Burger!) but I simply cannot. Coal Burgers when they are done right are AWESOME, but this place is so inconsistent!  Sometimes they deserve 3 stars and sometimes 5, so hence, we have a 4 star rating.  BURGERS:The first time I ate here, it was perfect!  I had the regular Coal Burger, it was juicy, not overcooked and I really DIG the Coal Burger Sauce which has Thousand Island mixed with like 5000 other things and it works!  *I typically prefer my meat Medium Rare, just FYI.... Then my 2nd trip, I was so disappointed. My burger was dry and I couldn't swallow my bites without water. I have had the Green Chili Burger and it was good, but I am just not a spicy person fan, although my husband seems to enjoy that one. I do like that you can the burgers wrapped in lettuce as an anti-bread option. Tried the Grass-Fed beef once and I wasn't impressed, but that was also on a dry-burger day so maybe that was why??  FRIES: The sweet potato fries when I do get them are always amazing. The regular fries....well, they are just fries. Nothing special. Have not had them for awhile as bathing suit season is fast approaching!  GELATO SHAKES: Well these things ROCK! My favorite is the Hazelnut Chocolate, although Banana Coconut is a close second. When I was pregnant I always ordered them, now save them for special rewards for myself.  KIDS MEALS: It is just okay. My boys get the hotdogs. My 5 year old is very picky and doesn't love bread so doing a burger is a tough one. But there are not a lot of options for kids. If they do want a shake I make them split it as they are super large for kids and do not have a \"Kid's Size\". They have new crayons which are always nice and a coloring sheet and is kid friendly. I can easily wheel a stroller up to the table when I need to if I am in the booth section.  CONS: It isn't cheap. Sometimes if it is just me and my 2 older boys (2 and 5) it adds up to $25 for a meal which I think is pricey. Maybe they could do a kids eat free day and more families would come in??  I am always annoyed that there isn't ketchup close by for fries and if I am there by myself with all 3 kids I have to \"leave them\" to go get it by the drinks.   PROS: When it is good, it is GOOD! I hope this place does make it as it is very tasty burger when done right. I cannot comment on the chicken as I will probably never order that. Also, you can usually always eat fast which comes in handy if I don't have lunch plans and am by myself because I am always in a hurry. Clean place, nice big bathroom, lots of great soda choices that are healthier even though I don't really drink soda. Service has always been great for me, I have never had an issue there with that in my 15 or 16 visits!  Overall, I hope it makes it as I do LOVE the sauce and the JUICY burger."}
{"text":"Omg....heavenly. I ate the whole thing..and I never eat like that. I'm from LA..we try not to eat..lol! Get the milkshakes! Amaaaaazing and it's so worth a cheat day!"}
{"text":"This burger joint is just 100% average in food. The hamburgers are very very standard (think five guys) and the fries and salads are similar. I think I have to take off a star for the weird cafeteria feel inside, and I'm tired of the whole \"read the menu on a chalkboard at the front door than proceed to check out\" idea. Just like at Sauce and Rumbi grill, it causes some decent traffic jams at the entrance where you feel rushed making your selections. $32 for two burgers and two beers isn't horrible, but it is when you're eating off of to-go trays. Disappointment all around."}
{"text":"Popped in for a quick lunch. The place was fairly empty, but it was still early (11:30). Order a 1/2 lb Green Chili Burger, french fries, and a drink. That came up to just about $15. A bit pricey in my book for a quick serve burger.   However, in defense of the place, they use Niman Ranch beef and are super eco-friendly. That usually costs a bit more.   The burger was good, but not great. I expected it to be crustier. The fries were mediocre, nothing special. The soda was quite good. All Boylan's Cane Sugar soda on tap.  Lots of other choices in the area and not sure I would choose Coal Burger again.  1 man, 2 cents...."}
{"text":"Went to Coal Burger on a Friday night with hubby and brought a coupon they had sent me.  After we ordered I remembered the coupon and noticed it expired the day before.  We asked the waitress could they still accept it and she had to check with the manager.  The coward of a manager made her come back to us to say they could not honor it a day late.  Really!!  They sent the coupon, how does 1 day make a difference!   The place was half empty, it wasn't like they had a line of people trying to get in for a burger and could care less about coupons.  Isn't the idea of a coupon to get people in your business?  We are spending money in your establishment and you won't honor your own coupon??  Needless to say we won't be back.  Shame on Grimaldi's you know better."}
{"text":"I stopped here recently with a friend for lunch. The service was really friendly. The gentleman taking our order answered our questions and made suggestions. We both went with the backyard burger and side of mixed fries. The food arrived quickly The burger was really tasty and great quality. The fries were crisp and fresh and went well with the house sauce. My favorite feature has to be the soda fountain featuring boylan brand made with cane sugar, nice touch. While we were eating the gentleman who took our order came over to apologize as he did not charge us for the lunch combo and we paid more than we needed to. He refunded us the difference and made it right, another nice touch. I work in the area and will be back with friends."}
{"text":"Not a bad spot for a nice Friday evening dinner! There aren't a lot of choices on the menu but the items that are there all look tasty and flavorful. You choose between a 1/3 lb or 1/2 lb burger and you're good to go. My husband had the burger with the horseradish on it and I had the Bacon Blue Burger since I'm a blue cheese fanatic. We got an order of half and half fries - regular and sweet potato - which they were awesome enough to split onto our 2 plates. A plus for me since my husband eats faster than I do and I find myself rushing to scarf down food when we share from one plate! We also ordered a malted shake which our server also split into 2 smaller cups and was absolutely worth the extra calories.   Portion sizes are decent and you don't feel overly stuffed afterwards. Service was super friendly and fairly quick. The place was full on a Friday evening but not overly crowded. Good food, good location, good stuff!"}
{"text":"Took me a while to write this review, but the time has finally come... DUN DUN DUNNN.  By far, WORST customer service I have ever received at a restaurant.  I walked in on a Friday night at about 7:30pm after getting my hair done at one of Quarter salons.  All I wanted was to grab a quick bite, since I had to rush to work soon after.    I approached the counter and waited for one of the many employees behind it to take my order.  I stood there patiently for a few minutes, watching as the servers behind it glanced over and saw me waiting, while they mindlessly polished glasses and did God knows what else.  A few minutes later, my patience was wearing thin and the old \"Good things come to those who wait\" idiom was not sounding so nice.  A young man finally walks up and boldly asks, \"Have you been helped yet?\"  I responded that I hadn't and he began to take my order.  I told him what I would like and he said that he couldn't put the order in right away, because the girl with access to the system was nowhere to be found.  I was confused.  He suggested, \"I can go ahead and place the order with the kitchen, and we don't know where she is, but she will probably be back in time to take your payment before your burger is ready.\"  I thought this was extremely unprofessional and outrageous, but I was hungry, so I agreed.  Then this boy inquires \"It's to go, right?\"    I responded that I would be eating in.  He pointed me over to the hostess and said that she would seat me if that was the case.  I told him that I just wanted to enjoy a burger at the counter, and that I was in a hurry.  He responded that it was full service.  So a quick rundown.... employees staring at me instead of taking my order, my order unable to be entered into the system because the girl with access was \"nowhere to be found\", assuming that this was a carry out order because I was a solo diner, directing me to the hostess to be seated when he could have seated me himself, and refusing to let me eat my burger at the counter because it was \"full service\" and he probably assumed I wouldn't tip.  I can see why this place is closed.  This is horrendous service... take a hint from FOX Concepts and get your act together, Grimaldi's!!!"}
{"text":"First off, this place has a nice organic vibe.  Second the staff was friendly a bit on the helpless side though, still new so no bad marks for that.  Third, great visibility to the coal oven (looks like a brick pizza oven on steroids)  Menu: all grass fed beef (definite +), Vege burger (brown rice and black bean) is a must next time.  Drinks: nice change from the norm, Boylan's Sparkling Beverages (sticking with the natural theme), nice touch, also they serve Gelato shakes (seems like half the customers ordered them).  Devour: kept it simple and ordered the Classic Coal Burger with side of mushrooms and a drink.  Price: $10  Next time: Yes, there will be a next time.  The burger was above average and I can taste the coal flame (yum).   Vege burger and sweet potato fries you mine next time."}
{"text":"I have had the veggie burger and sweet potato fries a few times and they are pretty decent.  I actually like the unique soda flavors it's a bit of a break from the Coke / Pepsi war.  I had a gellato shake and I'm not sure that's the best ice cream to make a shake with. It's way sweet so it tastes like frozen sugar more than anything.  Try: - Veggie Burger - Sodas - Sweet Potato Fries"}
{"text":"I went to Coal Burger with my date for a quick dinner before a movie at iPic. We were promptly seated. The atmosphere is interesting ... sort of like the dark side of True Food Kitchen (same bare bones, simple, but nice decor, but with food that is delicious in a different way - a fattening one!). As usual, here it goes:  I would have to agree that the menu was fairly sparse, which brings up the famed and feared Gordon Ramsay test: Simplicity in menu means absolute perfection is required. I ordered a chicken sandwich with \"ranchero\" sauce, which was unfortunately disappointing. The panko crusted chicken breast was not well done - one side was completely uncoated, and the sandwich did not have much of a taste character to it. I also had a side of fries which were delectable. Just added a pinch of salt.   Price points were actually pretty good for a restaurant in the Scottsdale Quarter. A good place for a quick, less formal meal before a movie at iPic or after a day of shopping in the Quarter.   My date had the bacon bleu burger which looked delicious and had a healthy helping of caramelized onions that looked to be excellently done.   My absolute favorite is their non-Coke / non-Pepsi soda products - for about the same price as Coke and Pepsi products elsewhere (not more). I like \"fake coke\" more than I do the real stuff.   We did not sample dessert or booze offerings, but I did review the booze menu, which brings us to the grading segment of the review.   OVERALL:   B   (3 stars)   SERVICE:    PASS        We were quickly seated and our server was attentive and did the \"first bite check in\" to see how we liked the food. Service deserved a pass. Since this is a \"fast casual\" place, and I did not get to test the server's wine knowledge personally, I graded \"pass/fail\" on this one.   FOOD QUALITY:  B-    There was nothing special about my chicken sandwich. It was cooked ok, and the taste was OK. An average \"meh\" kind of sandwich. Not good not bad. The fries were good, and just the right balance between crispy and soft.  Plus / Minus Points:  Plus points for having an alternative soft drink provider. Minus points for having no beers on tap."}
{"text":"I have to say that today marked the 2nd time I was disappointed with this place after having fallen for it with the first bite.  1-I have noted that they are inconsistent with their burger cooking - my first one was cooked perfectly (a slight pink); the next ones were either overcooked or WAY overcooked and tasted like cardboard. 2-Their servers do not do a good quality check with food coming out of the kitchen (and this is the 2nd time I've observed this - see first review); Our burgers, which both should have come with more toppings on them both did not have said toppings and the server didn't note this until I had to tell her.. which she then brought to us in the most meager quantities.  In the end, we both paid $9ea for a cardboard patty with meager ingredients and left feeling stiffed.  I can forgive oversights or rare one-offs, but when the food is not consistently cooked and ingredients are missing repeatedly, it tells me this place needs to work out the kinks before I want to give them my hard-earned cash again.  I appreciate that the manger came out and offered to comp my burger (but not my friend's, even though she got stuck w/ the same 'lump-of-coal burger patty' and missing ingredients as I did) and did so.. but I'm afraid I have given this place enough shots to know that I get more consistency at some other similarly-priced burger places in Chandler."}
{"text":"This place was pretty good. We walked in and ordered our burgers and fries and took a seat. While waiting we noticed we didnt order any sauces for our fries so we put 3 in hoping to get them at the same time as our food, but that didnt happen...we waited and waited till finally we asked if we were going to get them...The burger i had was the Bacon Bleu Cheese Burger it was pretty good."}
{"text":"Work and live in North Scottsdale and not very familiar with the Chandler area.  After a late morning meeting was starving but did not know where to go. Thank god there is a Yelp app available as it almost never fails me. Launched the Yelp app and saw Coal Burger was only mile away from where I was at. I was craving a burger and saw many good reviews on Yelp so thought it was definitely worth a shot. AND it was so good.  Coal Burger is one I will definitely visit again. The flavor of the meat was really delicious. I ordered a side salad with balsamic vinaigrette dressing and that was very good too."}
{"text":"Overpriced. A burger, drink, and fries was $17. Still, the food was tasty and the location is great."}
{"text":"Food tastes good enough. Way over priced. I tried the 1/3 lb bacon blue burger. I didn't taste any bacon. My kid's kid burger was devoid of any condiments. Even he complained. My $3 side of fries amounted to about 25 fries."}
{"text":"Hmm, I'm mixed about this place. So I'll start from a 5-star since I'm nice.  -Expensive burgers, very small portions -1 -Tasty burgers but I don't see how it tastes better than other gourmet burger joints, nothing special jumps out at me -1 -Grass fed cows and organic ingredients +1 -The ambiance resembles a cafeteria setting (like others have said), just kinda blah -1  Since this place is pretty far away from my house, I'm not sure I'll be making another trip back.  3 even."}
{"text":"We had dinner here last night before our movie... The place was modern, I enjoy lively but don't want music blasting. Menu was easy, I had the steak burger, and wife had the lettuce burger. Service was helpful and I didn't feel like we waited long for food. Burgers are very good, with that charcoal taste like real meat should ! The milk shake was great, when we told waiter we were heading to movie he brought a to-go cup for my shake without asking. I would come again, it was a fun, quick place, and great food."}
{"text":"Never heard of the place, thought we'd give it a try... The burger's coal taste is defiantly acquired and the sweet potato fries were dull and lacked flavor. We were left very disappointed. Our server was friendly but we won't be back."}
{"text":"I have to first say that I have eaten at Coal Burger before and my first experience was a good one.  Since my last visit, probably over a year ago, I have become a Pescatarian. It has been just over 7 months since I've eaten a burger and one night I really had a hankering. I appreciate Coal Burger's grass-fed beef and healthy options, but unfortunately it didn't save my last trip to the restaurant.  My wife and I went in late at night about an hour-and-a-half before they closed to order a grass-fed burger; My wife ended up going with the vegetarian since she doesn't eat meat at all. The first experience at the register was getting incorrectly charged by the cashier. I figured that since it was late, there really wasn't any reason for me to throw a fit. I ordered my burger medium-rare with fries.  What came out was a completely well-done burger and cold French fries. On top of that, my wife's vegetarian burger was burnt and dry. I sent my burger back to have them cook up another one which came back the same, dry and burnt. On top of that, the buns were cold and untoasted, my vegetables were limp, and the soda was way too sweet.  For a company whose claim to fame is their grass-fed beef, they sure know how to over cook it. If their cook paid half as much attention to my food as he was the cute waitresses, we might not have had such a lousy experience.  It's a shame that the food quality has degraded over time...  I will say that the manager did reach out to me and offer another burger. At that point, with a pound of meat already ruined, I decided against another burger and requested a refund. She did give me a refund which I appreciated, but I went home hungry and frustrated with a business that I once enjoyed.  I can easily say that this will probably be my last time to Coal Burger unless something drastic changes to raise the quality of the meal."}
{"text":"I see absolutely nothing wrong with this place. It is more expensive than McDonald's but have you compared the price of organic ground beef to multi-cow chubs at your local grocery store lately? And wait, isn't Five Guys about the same price?   I found the taste to be very good actually. I love the brioche bun. I tasted every bit of coal/wood fire in my burger. I do prefer mine a bit less done, but I didn't ask if it could be cooked to a different temp. I love the bib lettuce instead of iceburg. My salad was tasty with a very good basil avocado dressing and nicely appointed with deseeded and peeled cucumbers and grape tomatoes. And not overly dressed. I tasted my husband's french fries. They were hot and fresh, I agree nothing unique, but good quality. The soda fountain is unique in that it serves cane sugar sweetened soda. Much better than HFCS. And yes I'm sure more expensive.  The service was very attentive, the place was clean, and very \"green\" feeling. They even use L.E.D. lighting.  In summary, if you're looking for somewhere to eat cheap, and gorge yourself silly, and could care less about your carbon footprint, then this may not be your thing. But if you're concerned about the quality of your ground beef and want a great tasting burger that fits into your healthy diet, then I think you'll appreciate what they are offering here."}
{"text":"I don't understand all the negative reviews about this place!!   Ease up, people! I decided to try it anyways and I'm glad I did.  Had the bacon cheeseburger and it was delicious...and, I have to say, I'm usually pretty picky about burgers. Got a side of sweet potato fries and they were ADDICTIVE. SO GOOD!! Tried the hazelnut-milk chocolate gelato milkshake and it was luscious...very, very tasty!   Service was great! My friend and I couldn't decide what we wanted because everything sounded so good. Two servers approached us and kindly offered up some suggestions, even recommending not to spend the money on 2 sides when one side of fries would feed us just fine, without trying to hurry us along. After I ordered a water, I immediately regretted it when I saw rows and rows of natural fountain sodas (like sugar cane soda!).  I didn't try it but will definitely try it next time I go. Then once we finished our meal, the staff didn't try and push us out. They let us stay a bit as we nursed our food comas.   Wonderful food. Great staff. Reasonable prices.  I will definitely be returning to Coal Burger."}
{"text":"I've only eaten here once but it was quite good. My husband and I both had the veggie burger and split an order of half/half fries. It was plenty of food (the burgers are huge) and satisfying after an evening at iPic. It was a little overpriced for the type of food you are getting and everything is a la carte. However, it's probably one of the cheaper options if you're dining at Scottsdale Quarter and I'm sure we will return."}
{"text":"Decent burgers. Sometimes they are a little overcooked but the flavor is good. Prices aren't horrible given the fact you're not getting a pink sludge burger like most fast food places. I'm a fan of their drink choices, which are better than the typical Pepsi or Coke brands available at most places. I think they have a good idea here and hopefully it works for them. It's not a place I'd go all the time, but it's worth the trip once in a while."}
{"text":"Yummers! Tasty, healthy, guilt-free and A-OK. Had a yummy burger, regular, sweet potato fries and a natural root beer. Give it a whirl. You might become addicted!"}
{"text":"My Daughter and I tried this restaurant for the first time and I left feeling extremely disappointed.  I mean, how badly can you mess up a burger?  I ordered my Daughter a grilled cheese, a la carte, and was charged a few dollars MORE than the grilled cheese kid's meal (which includes a side and a drink).  When I asked for a side, the employee's response was \"But you didn't order a side.\"  I said, \"You're right, I didn't.  But I was charged MORE for a grilled cheese sandwich than the kid's meal itself, it should come with something.\"  After arguing my case, I simply said forget it and sat down to eat.  The sweet potato fries were o-k but the burger was one of the worst I've had, hands down.  And my Daughter's grilled cheese sandwich was half the size of my burger yet more expensive.  Disappointed and I don't think I'll go back!"}
{"text":"It's nice to have some healthier options out there for burgers and fries and  Coal Burger gives it to you. They offer grass fed beef for only $1 more and their prices are very reasonable. I also like that they give you the option of 1/3 or 1/2 lb burgers.  Usually places that offer healthy options are pricey but it was nice to see this place is not one of them. They have amazing milk shakes made with organic dairy. My husband and I shared a berry shake and we should have ordered 2 because it was gone in seconds. The burger was cooked exactly how I asked which was medium well and sweeet potato fries were great. My husband loved his bacon burger and my cousins loved their burgers. My two year old even scarfed down her grilled cheese sandwich and sweet potato fries. Normally we have to battle with her at dinner. Our waitress was great too. I can't think of one bad thing to say about this place. We will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"I like Coal Burger!  I've been here a few times, and never really had to wait for a seat. The food is good.  You place your order at the cashier, pay and they give you a number.  It normally takes about five minutes or so, unless they're busy.   Here's the skinny, your only big decision is weather you want 1/3 lb, or 1/2 lb.   The basic is their Coal Burger for $4.99 or $6.99 depending on what size you order.   Their best burger by far and away is the Bacon Blue Burger for $7.49, or $9.49. It's delicious. It reminds me of that old Drew Carey joke \"Okay boys, come on now, next stop is the heart!\"    It is the best blue cheese burger west of the Mississippi, and Hackney's in Chicago.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"We stopped at CoalBurger on the way home from the airport after an all night flight and a long airport layover - so we were looking for good food fast.  I had the basic burger, plain. It was a very tasty burger on a fresh bun. Now that I have read some of the other reviews I think I should have added the brioche bun. Next time. My b/f had a fancier burger, and he liked it as well.  We had both sweet and regular fries, and they were fine, but nothing remarkable. I purchased a side of BBQ dipping sauce for the fries, and it was good, but probably meant for the sandwich.  Like I said, I'll be back, but will skip the fries, which is probably a good thing anyway."}
{"text":"The first time I went to Coal Burger it was due to very poor planning on a Saturday night.  It was the only place without a long waiting list, and we had a movie to catch.  The menu and prices were unspectacular.  None of the salads looked too interesting but I figured at least I was having a relatively healthy meal.  I liked the diet cherry cola.    The friend I went with actually really liked her salad the first time and asked if we could go back.  This time I decided to try the organic, non-antibiotic, free range, etc. etc. etc. chicken sandwich and sweet potato fries.  The chicken sandwich was, in a word, disgusting.  It had those black grill lines that cause cancer and was also covered in flecks of some terrible seasoning powder.  I scraped off some of the black stuff, gingerly took a bite, and was totally grossed out by the texture.    Apparently you can't assume that a grilled chicken sandwich is going to be a grilled chicken BREAST sandwich (yes, I just put the word breast in all-caps).  The grilled chicken sandwich is a chicken patty made from ground up chicken, like a giant chicken mcnugget minus the breading.  It was pretty horrific.    I swiftly traded the chicken sandwich for a veggie burger.  The manager came over and gave a whole spiel about how they've had a really tough time finding quality organic, antibiotic-free chicken breasts that are reasonably priced, so that's why they're serving this awful thing.  Like the chicken sandwich, the veggie burger also had tons of charred parts.  It also didn't really stick together like a veggie pattie should.  At least the sweet potato fries didn't let me down."}
{"text":"I went here last night for dinner with a party of 6.  It was about 8pm and the place was pretty dead so there was no line to order.  The decor is very neat and clean but nothing special.  I do however like the open kitchen so you can see how they cook everything.  Everyone who works there is very friendly and pretty speedy with everything.  Everything looked to be cooked fresh to order and our entire order was out in well under 10 minutes.  * American Salad = very good but nothing very special. * Green Chili Burger = eh.  Sounds better than it is.  The meat is ok I guess but I didn't like the bun because it was too dry or something.  The \"sweet jalapenos\" had an ok spice to it but I couldn't really tell if they were sweet or not.  The green chili looked to be from a can.  There really wasn't too much going on in the way of flavor for this burger. * Regular Fries = very good.  Perfectly crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside.  They were also perfectly salted and not too greasy. * Sweet Potato Fries = these were very good as well. * Soda fountain = very unique.  Not your typical Coke/Pepsi type machine.  Everything is a brand I never heard of before and uses pure cane sugar for the soda instead of chemicals (except for their diet stuff).  The sodas were pretty good but a tad to sweet for me.  Not sure I'm going to rush back here.  I guess I really don't care about the whole organic, eco-green, we-save-the-Earth type restaurants.  I'd rather just have awesome food.  However, I like to try one of their gelato milk shakes though.  They do sound and look fantastic."}

{"text":"Good burger and fries, if that is what you are craving.  Nice place in Scottsdale Quarter, friendly staff and good food."}
{"text":"Just moved over to Ray/Priest and wanted to try Coal Burger. I went in a couple of weeks ago since I saw they had organic choices. I like the set-up, you can eat in fairly quickly or take out. I liked the selections they had and the service was great although they didn't have to do much since I took it home. I got an Organic Hamburger with fries. The fries were just regular fries, nothing fancy but delicious as all fries pretty much are. The burger was tasty but was nothing really special which overall is what I would say about Coal Burger was that it's just ok. The meat and bun were small for what I paid and very underwhelming. I don't think I'll be back, I love San Tan or other burger places too much to come back here."}
{"text":"Been there twice, recommend to all, will keep going.  So far I have had a Green Chili Burger and Coal Original with blue cheese. Both awesome. I can taste the quality of the meat and buns. Even if your palate can't determine a difference your stomach will. You won't feel a lump in your stomach like other burger places. Probably something to do with natural beef and gluten free buns or something.  Sparking lemonde from the fountain is a must. And love the sweet potato fries with coal sauce to dip in."}
{"text":"The bf and I wanted to try someplace different on our venture out to North Scottsdale so we decided to give Coal Burger a try.  The menu is pretty small, which isnt good or bad.  I had the green chile burger and my bf had the bacon blue burger and we shared a side order of mixed fries.  The burgers were not bad but not great.  The flavors were pretty well mixed together but the burger itself was just blah!  The fries were ok as well, nothing special.  I would go back to give them another try.  They have interesting sodas on tap that are natural.  The shakes look good so will try those the next time I am in the area."}
{"text":"Quite frankly one of the worse burgers I've had.  I ordered the signature \"Coal Burger\" figuring this would be the best example of what they had to offer.  After a couple bites, I had to douse it with ketchup and mustard just to choke it down.   Burgers are served medium and are not cooked to order.  That said mine was well done.   On top of this, only being open a week, they are definitely still working out the kinks.  For those of you french fry lovers out there, Cool Burger fries taste a lot like those at Wendy's in my opinion so not bad but nothing I'd call special.  Two stars for good shakes, nice atmosphere, friendly staff, and cool location.  My take is Scottsdale Quarter is a very cool new scene with great people watching so definitely a great location to check out.  Just do so at one of the other numerous restaurants.    Five Guy fans (I'm not) will find one across the street and numerous places in this area will serve up a better burger than Coal.   For those of you able to travel and dying for a truly amazing burger, Zinburger in the Biltmore Fashion Park about 25 mins away is phenomenal !!!"}
{"text":"Interesting atmosphere and decor.  The burgers were great--the coal fire taste was juicy with the right amount of char.  The thicker cut fries were a welcome change and were totally addicting.  I tried the natural ginger ale and it was out of this world!  I couldn't stop going back for refills.  It's was very refreshing."}
{"text":"Coal burger is decent. A solid burger experience. The flavor of their burgers is good, and I like that they use grass-fed beef. They pay attention to the details too: fresh buns, homemade \"special sauce.\" You won't leave feeling hungry--especially if you order a double. They don't have Coke or Pepsi, opting instead for a different, non-corn-syrup brand. Noble and unique.  Downsides? Well, the sides for one. I'm not a fan of their fries. They taste like they come frozen in a bag. Would really love to see some fresh-cut french fries here. Or, if they are freshly cut in-house, I wish they tasted like it. They're bland--the sort you'd get on the side of a burger you ordered at one of those national family restaurant chains. Not the worst things in the world, but certainly not on par with the quality of the burgers.  Also, it's a bit expensive--just slightly. I can think of at least 2 equally tasty but less expensive burger experiences within a mile of this place. So, although I think Coal Burger has a nice product, it isn't really a go-to burger joint for me."}
{"text":"Coal Burger is so yummy we went 2 days in a row! The first day I had a 1/4 lb Bacon and Blue burger - yum. Day 2 was the 1/4 lb Green Chile burger - yum yum! The service is excellent. Prices are a bit high but worth it  - you are paying for flavor!  The gelato shakes are a must have so try and squeeze one into your meal. If not, they offer a number of cane sodas and I believe the root beer is the best. What's cool also is that this place if focused on natural and organic products right down to the bamboo tables!"}
{"text":"Fellow Gluten Free Comrades REJOICE, I repeat REJOICE! I have stumbled upon a fantastic gluten free burger place! Okay, the Williams clan tummies' were rumbling and we decided to try this Grimaldi's sister restaurant, Coal burger. We were greeted by simple and modern decor when we walked up to the counter to order- I find no problem with ordering and sitting down, but I know people who do. When I mentioned I needed to be gluten free, they made sure that all of the extras were okay for me, something I really care about! I mean it seems they care! We didn't have to wait at the counter and they served us our food and any condiments we needed to our table- a nice touch, but possibly because it was not packed.   ORDER THE GELATO SHAKES, yes, I know that they cost more than a glass of wine, but seriously one of the best shakes in my life and with the cutest giant red straws. (It's sad how the little things get me so excited) Also they do all sugar cane sodas- which is always a fun mix from the usual.   Now to the gluten free burgers- you need to understand, gluten free bread is usually gross. I know there are exceptions, but I was expecting the worst when I arrived. The bun was decent- a tad dry, but I will gladly try it again. It was just fantastic to feel \"normal\" again, dramatic I know. It gets annoying ordering just a patty with all the fixins. I am also going to have to try the burgers with the lettuce wraps. We did notice the smaller portions for the expensive price, but I mean it seems to be expected as a trendy place at Scottsdale Quarter...  Both the fries (sweet and regular) were good, nothing amazing but yummy.   Overall if I was just ranking it on being gluten free I would give it 5 stars instantly, I will definitely be back and willing to fork out money to people who care about my health and will do anything to try to not make me sick.  But on the other side as a normal restaurant, it is nothing to rave about, kinda expensive and smaller portions (love the mentality bigger is better) so I would of ranked it a 3. So it seems to be an even 4 stars in my book, a must try for gluten free eaters!"}
{"text":"GREAT PLACE, LOVED IT  We received a 15% off coupon in the mail so we thought we'd give it a try, just figured it was burgers.  This place is GREEN and has little posters hanging all over letting you know what different ways they are doing their part to make a difference.  The beef is all natural, hormone free & for a $1.00 up-charge your burger can be made with ORGANIC GRASS FED beef, which is what my husband ordered in the western style...I ordered the chicken club burger...the way it comes sounded more flavorful than it actually was, but it did seem really lean...next time I will chose one of their other burger types, like the western & I'll just sub with the chicken patty as I don't eat beef.  We split an order of fries & they were fabulous, reminded me of how Wendy's fries used to be...and there is a poster on the wall telling you the type of oil (which I can't remember now) that they are fried in has antioxidants & vitamins in it.  After we ate, I wanted a shake I had seen on the menu...Hazelnut Milk Chocolate, I added malt and chose the coconut whipped cream...OMG BEST SHAKE EVER...forgot to mention that the shakes are made with gelato...even my husband said it might be the best shake he's ever had.  It's the kind of place where you order & pay at the counter & they bring your food out to your table.  A person who seemed to be a manager came over to our table a couple of times to see how we were enjoying our food & offered up some other tidbits on their GREEN products & was super friendly.  Can't wait to go back & give the chicken burger another try."}
{"text":"I called an order for pick up around 6pm for 7pm.  I specifically asked if they could make it for 7 because I wanted to not only makes sure it was ready for me, but that it was fresh when I got there.  The girl on the phone acted annoyed that I was asking this but agreed anways.  I got there and waited for 10 min while 3 girls behind the counter just looked at me then said we will be with you in a minute.  Finally a guy came up and handed me my order.  I got into my car, pulled out of the parking lot and opened the bag to try a fry...well it was cold and dry..the burger, cold.  They did exactly what I asked them not to do.  worst burger and fries, no flavor, cold, stale, do NOT waste your time here."}
{"text":"As a general rule, most people are drawn to things they can't or shouldn't have. And with good reason.  Once you cross the line, partaking in life's ill-gotten fruits, you wish you hadn't. This is where life whips out its great equalizer...the sudden realization that you've just fucked-up....getting involved with something never meant to be.   I'm talking about Coal Burger. The many times we sat on the patio at Stingray Sushi, looking longingly across the way at Coal Burger. Its packed house.  The people waiting for tables. The wafting aroma of flame broiled beef.  It was too much. We were sucked in like a Vietnamese basket-whore, (so i hear) despite neither of us liking ground beef all that much.  Missing lunch, we came here for an early dinner...like way early...like 4:30 early. There was us and one other party in the entire place.  This is where CB defied all logical thinking patterns.  Service was poor, and the burger even worse. We were informed when ordering how all burgers were cooked medium unless specified differently. Fine. I ordered extremely well, asking the meat be caramelized. My wife, medium.  My wife's burger was rare, as in seared outside, tartare inside. Mine wasn't caramelized, unless black is the new caramel.  How does this happen when there are only five (5) guests in the entire restaurant? There was a replacement burger and plenty of apologies, but that's not what I'm looking for when I spend twenty five bucks on two burgers and beers.   CB...if your main product is burgers, and your default cooking method is medium, you might want to weigh the idea of having a timer somewhere in the kitchen...like next to the grill.  What a waste."}
{"text":"I guess this is somewhere between a 'five guys' and a 'grind' in terms of price and quality.  I was hoping that the coal fire would distinguish it a little more.  We'll leave the mark at slightly above average for now."}
{"text":"Terrible.  Way overpriced, worse than it's nearby competitors in every measurable way."}
{"text":"If eating veggie burgers that look as bloody as the real thing doesn't sound appealing to you, don't order one at Coal Burger.  The Scottsdale Quarter eatery's veggie burger ($7.99) looks like and has the consistency of a real rare patty, which made chowing down on it a little weird for me. If you do decide to try one, it comes with bibb lettuce, roasted red peppers and avocado on a whole-wheat bun, though you can customize it any way you'd like.  Coal Burger is a cool, quick, cheap hamburger joint where you order at the counter, and your food is delivered to your table. There are seven types of beef burgers, three chicken sandwiches and a handful of salads to choose from. Fries are extra, but one side ($2.50) is big enough to share between two people--trust me, the portion is huge!  Something uniquely cool about Coal Burger is its vintage-style soda fountain, with all the drinks made by Coal Burger. So, if you're a diehard Coca-Cola fan, you might not be happy, but I loved my diet cola/lemonade combo.  My friend got a Green Chile Burger ($6.99 for a third-pound, $8.99 for a half-pound), and while he said he enjoyed the combination of green chile, jalapeno and provolone flavors, he was expecting whole green chiles on the burger rather than a chile paste."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place 3 stars because, and ONLY because of their shakes. I had the hazelnut gelato shake and it was OUT OF THIS WORLD!!!! Probably the best I've ever had. Their claim to fame, the burger,  however was not so impressive. My burger was a tiny, over-cooked, over-priced, dry hockey puck of a disappointment. The toppings were sparse. the sweet potato fries were so-so. It's hard to mess those up, and they are basically the same wherever you go. So ultimately, if you are looking for a good burger, in my opinion, move along. On the other hand, if you are looking for an awesome milkshake, this is as good as it gets."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I tried this place out last Saturday. Our total was $24 for 2 burgers, 2 fries, 2 beverages. Not bad for a lunch in Scottsdale. We found the burgers to be just OK tasting. Nothin special to lure us back anytime soon. I was satisfied with portions for $. I think people are used to ridiculous huge meals like the ones served at cheesecake factory which are big enough to feed a family of horses so when they see a normal single portion they feel underwhelmed/cheated. I found the restaurant to be clean and nice enough to sit & enjoy the burger & kill some time before our movie started."}
{"text":"I went here tonight for dinner with a friend. The menu was really limited and for being a burger place, they only had 6 burgers to choose from. 5 of the 6 options were out for me because I do not enjoy spicy toppings or bacon. I ended up getting the original coal burger and essentially \"creating my own\" toppings. When we got our food, I was surprised at how thin and small the burger actually was (I got the 1/3 lb) and my friend got the 1/2 pound. His burger was slightly thicker than mine. The food was OK but nothing special. We ordered the mixed fries, which in my opinion were the best thing we ate there. I also would not recommend ordering their soda to anyone who is used to Coke or Pepsi products because they make all their soda in house using cane sugar. My diet coke tasted nothing like diet coke.  For 2 burgers, 2 drinks and a mixed order of fries, our bill was almost $25. To me, it was overpriced and not that great. I will not be coming here again nor will I be recommending them to anyone."}
{"text":"Disappointing. I like the concept but the burger didn't delivered. It was flavorless, even with cheese. I ended up adding salt to it, which is a first.  The bun was harder than I expect a burger bun to be. The fries (half regular/half sweet potatoes) were ok. I liked the soda dispensing machine, the lemon-lime tasted better than any Sprite, 7-Up or Sierra Mist. For a 1/3 lbs cheeseburger, fries and soda it was almost $12.00. While I'll gladly pay that amount for the concept (organic, grass fed, etc) I expect the food to be flavorful and delicious. Unfortunately it wasn't.  *2.5 stars*"}
{"text":"Not many places have a good veggie burger - this place does; black bean, brown rice, roasted tomato. Paired it with sweet potato fries. They have fancy soda \"evenly sweetened with cane sugar\". Try the black cherry, its divine. Good price, good service. The run the place Smash Burger  style. Everything is environmentaly friendly, maybe to offset the fact that they are cooking with coal."}
{"text":"Veggie burger isn't all that. I've had much better at The Lodge and Zinburger.  Sweet potato fries are lackluster."}
{"text":"Had the Burger with Blue Cheese and Bacon with a side of sweet potato fries.  Burger was tasty but very small.  Fries needed a lot of salt and were in very small pieces.  Overzealous waitress kept trying to take our plates.  Two burgers, two sides, one bottled water for $25 is way too expensive for the portions."}
{"text":"The \"chicken burger\" with jerk sauce was gross. It was dried out with terrible flavor. The only saving grace was that it was small, which says enough right there. As another reviewed said, it was a ground chicken patty when I was expecting a grilled chicken breast after going to places like Johnny Rockets where I believe they have a similarly named section of the menu that refers to chicken breast sandwiches. I realize I have myself to blame on that misunderstanding, but it was still a terrible sandwich."}
{"text":"If it had just been based on the burgers, I'd have given it 1 star. I'm sorry, but I don't like a \"bun-dominant burger\", and these buns are dry, tasteless and overwhelm the burger. So, yes, I got rid of the bun and tried to eat the rest, but I did not expect (nor appreciate) that \"hidden spice\" in my veggie burger and definitely did not like the chipotle in the BBQ sauce of my husband's BBQ burger. Not everyone likes spice so I'd have liked the option of sweet BBQ sauce instead. Ended up with a root beer float (okay, but the soda machine got stuck and sprayed me an my son; not cool) and fries gleaned from everyone else's plate. Fries were good! Just the right amount of crispiness, not too skinny, not too fat...and you put your own amount of salt on them. My son didn't like the dark deep-fried breading (Panko) of his Kids' Menu Chicken Fingers, so I ate them. Very fresh. Good for me; bad for him.... My other son did not finish his kid's cheeseburger so that's a bad sign (he ALWAYS finishes his burger). The staff was friendly and management was very gracious for taking the uneaten veggie burger off the bill but it was still too expensive and not a good enough first-time experience to return. Sorry."}
{"text":"There are many burger spots on there, and this one was pretty good! Got the veggie burger with some fries and it was yummy! Boyfriend got the burger, he thought it was good too.  Good service! They got my order right, and believe me..I order special!"}
{"text":"Good burgers, great chocolate hazelnut shake (I would go back just for that) and good service.  Not sure why most people are so negative  about it. It was a good experience and the burgers were delicious."}
{"text":"Imagine my surprise when a Burger Place actually has a Veggie Burger that a Vegan can eat!   The \"Other Coal Burger\" as they call it is a brown rice and black bean patty, it contains No dairy and No eggs! They serve it on a whole wheat bun, which is also dairy and egg free, with roasted tomatoes and crushed \"avocado\".   This is where my problem starts why do you call it \"Avocado\"? It clearly looks and tastes nothing like an Avocado, both times I ate here it was some kind of wannabe avocado spread that turned brown. This burger could be a thousand times better if there really was some fresh sliced avocado on it.  Another thing I don't get it why the french fries are FROZEN, they tout \"Food Matters and where your ingredients come from matter more\",   \"We are committed to great flavor and excellent ingredients\", \"We are committed to food raised naturally and without the use of pesticides and harmful fertilizers\", Yet there is only a handful of organic ingredients on the menu and again they are using frozen french fries!  With those kinds of statements I expect a lot more, like fresh cut fries made in house and all organic ingredients, that would make you stand apart from the crowd.  All in all I give points for the vegan patty but, everything else is just like everywhere else."}
{"text":"I love a good burger. I especially love a good grass-fed beef burger. Since most places do not serve grass-fed beef I was excited to discover Coal Burger. if you don't know, grass-fed beef is healthier than grain-fed, for you and the cows!  Upon my first visit, they did not disappoint. The boyfriend and I went here for lunch on a Sunday afternoon. It wasn't very busy so we hopped right up to the counter and ordered - 2 burgers and an order of fries/half sweet potato.   Our food came out quickly and was nice and hot. I've never had a coal oven baked burger before but it tasted a lot like a grilled burger like you'd have at a cookout (coal - duh, it took me a second to make the connection). Some reviewers have said the burgers were overcooked. I would not agree. My burger was done just right, not dry at all. The bun was also nice and fresh - an important component to a good burger in my book. And the best part was that there was lots of cheese!  The fries were solid. A little too salty but good overall.   I'm very happy to see that they are opening a location in Chandler soon. I will visit them for sure! Can't wait to enjoy yummy grass-fed burgers again."}
{"text":"Well, I couldn't agree more with the two star review that Yelp currently has for this place. I was excited to try it out, as I am a huge fan of Grimaldis and it is one of my favorite places for a decently priced meal. This place was just grossly overpriced for what you get.   My sister ordered a Coal Burger, Sweet Potato Fries, and a small drink. I ordered a bacon burger with normal fries. This came out to 28 dollars with tip. After purchasing this, I thought it'd be a big burger, right? Nope! It was around the same size as In n Out's. The quality wasn't that bad, but it was downright ridiculous for the price.   One moral of this story: Just go to In n Out. It is better and half the price."}
{"text":"I went here the other day, I was craving a burger..and I was thinking hmm In & Out or Coal Burger? Since I have never been to Coal and I wanted to see what all this hype was about.. OoOoOo Organic.... I went to try it out. Well, I only got the Coal Burger itself (I wish I got the fries..), really great service and didn't take long to get my food! The girl who works there even brought it to me.. thank youuu by the way! Very nice of you.  Anywho, soo.. I was like wow Coal Burger, I hope this is good..but.. I kind of want In & Out burger and compare the two... so I did. Don't judge me!  I got home and ate the Coal Burger.... prettehhhh good I must say, wasn't too fond of the sauce but really good, I would go again. But then, I ate the In & Out burger..and then I cried a little only because I love this place so much and it is just SO dericiousss!! I would prefer going to In & Out burger..but yet, I would definitely go again to Coal to try the other options and their fries! :)"}
{"text":"After I wrote my review last week detailing my lackluster experience, the GM of Coal Burger reached out to me and let me know that he was sorry about my experience, and said that if I came back he'd show me what a great burger can be. I was really impressed that they would proactively reach out and try to make it right, and I was happy to return and give them a second chance.  (In the message, he also let me know that you can order your burger cooked to order, and they're happy to cook to medium...That's good to know and a huge plus in my eyes.)   I returned today for lunch and asked for the manager (at his request), he came out, introduced himself and we chatted briefly. He was a really nice guy, took my order, and paid for my lunch. I was prepared to pay, so that was a really nice surprise. I ordered the same thing I did last time (Bacon Cheeseburger, side of fries and a drink) to make it a good comparison.   They brought me my food, and it was night and day from my last visit. The burger was cooked medium, juicy and flavorful. The coal fired cooking process shines through when the burger is cooked like this, and it was really delicious. The cheese and bacon add a lot to that, and their barbeque sauce is a nice addition to the burger. Fries seemed a bit better than last time, they're very crispy which I like. Needless to say I was impressed with my food.  All the other great stuff from my previous review still stands, I love the organic concept, it's really nice inside, very clean, the service is friendly and that soda machine remains great.   I'll definitely be back. It's expensive, but worth it, and the fact that they were so accommodating and willing to make it right for me raises them another couple notches in my book. I highly recommend going, ordering your burger medium or medium well (depending on how you like it) and I think you'll be impressed."}
{"text":"So a friend recommended this place, and it's been bugging me to try it every since.   I wasn't sure what to expect, but you order at a register. After pondering over the menu, I decided on the green chili burger.   Head to the drink station, oh what?! Pure cane sodas with no coke or pepsi? Awesome! I'm immediately a fan.   The food shows up on some interesting over sized plates. I thought the burger was quite tasty. Lots of flavor.   Fries were \"ok\". I actually expected more variety in their burgers, but I can't complain about the chili burger. I'll be back."}
{"text":"On my mission to find the best burger I had seen coal burger from the time the sign went up I had to check it out... I was lucky it was not busy at all was greeted by a friendly smile and was asked if I had been to coal burger before I said no... She offered pointers on what to get I thought that was nice I always have issues with ordering when everything looks good. I went with the Bacon Blue Burger and a side of Sweet Potato Fries with a side of Coal Burger Sauce... I rate the experience as followed.  Bacon Blue Burger - A Sweet Potato Fries - B+ Coal Burger Sauce - A Staff - A++  The Bun was so fresh and the burger tasted great with each bite... The Sweet Potato Fries dipped in the Coal Burger Sauce was a great tip from the greeter... I saw so many other things I need to order on the menu I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Halim took me here while we were shopping one day.  Delicious burgers and black cherry soda.  This is one of those green restaurants too, which is nice.   We both had burgers and had no complaints. Nice atmosphere, decent prices and good burgers.  If you're in the area check it out and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Not the best- or even close!  I would recommend \"the habit\" across the street.  Coal burger burgers were overcooked and tasted like they were frozen.  The kids didn't finish their burger/chicken and that's the kind of food they love the most.  They didn't have regular soda - the drink fountain was filled with all types of cane cola which was dissapointing when you just want a diet coke or pepsi. I appreciate that they are trying to make things more wholesome and organic but they really compromise the flavor in doing so.  I love places like Joe's Farm grill who are able to accomplish the same while delivering delicious food. The sweet potato fries were great though and so was the beer:)"}
{"text":"Yeah, it's a little over priced for fast food.  Even if it is a socially responsible company with trendy, ikea-esque decor, I am not sure I want to pay $30 (for two) to eat off a plastic tray.  Still that did include alcoholic beverages and they were nice enough to give me a fresh orange slice with my Blue Moon.  The service was great.  Even though they are an order at the counter type place they still come by and check on you.  Everyone we interacted with was very friendly.  I had the green chile burger which was right up my alley.  I also got sweet potato fries which were pretty decent but not the best I've had.  Overall, nothing really blew my mind but it definitely earned a repeat visit."}
{"text":"$30 for two people to eat \"In n Out\" quality burgers in a \"Chipotle\" atmosphere. Rip off. Save your money"}
{"text":"This place is trying way too hard to be cool; I wish they'd focus more on making great food. I asked the cashier what cut of meat they used in their burgers, and she said \"Angus\". Well, that's not a cut. So she asked her manager, who also replied \"Angus\". Wrong again. I expect an upscale, artisanal burger shop to know this kind of information. The fries and burgers were only average. I liked that their soda fountain dispenses real sugar Jones products. If you're looking for a great burger, I'd recommend SmashBurger then The Habit, in that order."}
{"text":"Omg!!!! So good, I didn't even finish eating to write this!! Uruguay grass fed and finished beef cooked over coals, gives it that flavor that u can't create wit anything else!! No soy, canola and they can do gluten free. I'm in love!! The fries are done in rice bran oil, no HFCs used either!! Taste is like heaven on earth!!!"}
{"text":"Not bad - I like the gluten free options, the grass fed organic - - that's mainly what I eat.  For all those that think the quality of a grass fed burger vs in and out is the same, you are sadly mistaken, sorry but until people realize this and stop paying so little for crappy food, better quality will continue to cost more.  I did the chicken burger on a gluten free bun - not bad, a little dry, but that could have been the GF bun - they're still not that great (anyone's). I don't equate GF with healthier only more digestible... so next time I'll wrap it w/ lettuce. I like that they cook in some sort of rice oil - hadn't heard about that one yet, i use coconut and heard avocado was good, but I'll look into that one. I like that they have organic shakes, though i wish people would start doing some dairy free ones - - coconut, rice, almond... and everyone's doing sweet potato fries too, i'd like to see more creativity. All in all if i'm gonna do a burger joint this would be my one.  I went back again yesterday - - they get a couple more points for their lettuce wraps and special sauce seems a little different - - i did the beef burger this time wrapped in lettuce... and they used a soft, nutritious lettuce - I believe it was a butter lettuce, nice choice, and it worked pretty well logistically and taste wise."}
{"text":"I really like this place.  Order your food then sit and they will bring to you.  Burgers are great. Had a taste of my bro's 1/2 pound bacon cheeseburger and the meat was so tasty.  I opted to try a more healthy choice, the ground chicken was easily subbed in the green chile burger.   Choices, did I mention that you get choices? Yeah, ya do. Bun choice: white, wheat, brioche, gluten free and lettuce wrap. Can you dig it? I did;I love options.   This time I did white as I already subbed chicken for beef, next time, beef on wheat. One healthy choice at a time.  Oh yeah, no coke or pepsi here, its natural soda with real sugar!!!!!! Does anyone remember real sugar? Its awesome!!!!!   Gotta mention the side salad, fresh greens, cucumbers, tomatoes, onion and slivers of carrots. I chose the lemon and olive oil dressing, so yummy!  I'm coming back here. Who wants to meet me?"}
{"text":"it's seems like medium means well done here so make your self clear!"}
{"text":"We went here for lunch and were surprised to find it more of a fast food type versus a regular restaurant. You order your burger at the counter and they bring it to your table. I ordered the veggie burger and sweet potato fries. I found both to be very flavorful and tasty. The veggie burger tasted homemade and came with roasted red peppers and avocado. There was definitely substance to this veggie burger! The sweet potato fries were some of the best i've had. Very crispy and fresh."}
{"text":"The burgers here have a tasty backyard burger quality to them and thus rank high on my list of decent local burger joints. The half-pound bacon double cheeseburger hits the spot and the french fries are appropriately crispy and delicious.  Although they charge an extra 50 cents for your choice of dipping sauce, I highly recommend trying the chipotle barbeque sauce (especially on the fries). This sauce has an uncommon savory note that I have only been able to guess is from celery seed. Maybe other BBQ afficionados can better deduce the secret ingredient, but I stand by my assessment.  Other reviewers are right to note that the burgers are a tad pricey, but the availability of original flavors (including the soda fountain) and a real homestyle burger makes Coal Burger worth a visit."}
{"text":"Grimaldi's Pizza has always been a hit with me, so when I discovered that they had gotten into the burger biz I had to try it. Yes, the coal-fired method gives the burger a unique charred taste that I will be back for. They also have one of the few independent soda machines I have ever seen."}
{"text":"Went here with some buddies, and we all had something different. The food was really bad, to begin with when my brother took a bite out of his burger, it was raw! ground beef, yuck! The chicken burgers were the same, cold and under cooked. I had the chicken salad, and the chicken was under cooked as well. But here is the worst, we left comment cards, which weren't bad. Just stating the fact that the food was under cooked, and tasteless. As we walked by the waitress and the cook (some punk in a pony tail) were staring at us and the cook flips us off. I was not about to have that! some punk thinks he's all that in front of the girls, So I walk back in, and the goof runs off like a CHICKEN:) I spoke with the manager, and he said he will take care of it. But I doubt that, because I noticed the comment cards in his hands as I was walked out, and he was tearing them up. Obviously  trying to cover up their backs. So stay clear of this place"}
{"text":"Coal Burger offers a healthier spin on your normal fast food burger place, which is refreshing. You can satisfy your craving and not feel too guilty about it after. Also, they  are very eco-friendly, from the straws they use, to the materials their tables are made of, even the bathrooms stress green-ness.   I normally get the 1/3 coal burger on a gluten free bun with mixed fries. This amount of food always leaves me full, but not with the heavy feeling of a greasy meal. Which is something that I love about them - no nasty grease! The fries are cooked in rice oil, the beef is coal fired, AND they have gluten free buns?? It is really nice to have options when it comes to this kind of cuisine.   The service is great, everyone is friendly. My order is always comes out perfect, just like I ordered it.   I give the 4 star rating because I haven't tried a lot of other items on their menu."}
{"text":"I was very excited to eat here, seems like we heard about it 6 months ago or more.  We were very disappointed with our visit.  You order and pay  at the counter and they bring your order to your table.  Basically, we paid full service restaurant prices for take out food.  We ordered the American salad and a 1/2 lb burger to share.  I asked for the bacon and dressing on the side, but wanted the blue cheese crumbles on the salad. They forgot the blue cheese and hard boiled egg. I expected the salad to be bigger as it was $8.95. I could have made a better salad at home. Next-the burger. It was tasty, but nothing special. Not worth $5.99. The sweet potato fries were decent, but not included with the burger. The kids meal was small, just 2 small pieces of chicken (which they called chicken strips), a very small order of fries and a tiny cup of milk. Not even enough food for a toddler.  When the manager asked how it was, we told him about the salad. He offered us a shake, which we declined.  The meal cost us close to $30 for 1 kids meal, 1 drink, 1 burger, 1 salad and a side of fries. We won't be back."}
{"text":"Coal Burger is a good solid burger. But it's not great, and the prices might set you up to expect a great burger. For two cheeseburgers (one 1/2 lb, one 1/4 lb, no bacon or anything), two drinks, and two orders of fries, we were at about $25. Now, the drinks are awesome: not only do they have only cane sugar in the fountain, but they have a Boylan soda fountain. Boylan makes some of my favorite sodas ever, so I was thrilled to see this. (Though saddened they didn't have cream soda.) I didn't even know Boylan offered fountains. Awesome.  The burger came out and it was good. Cooked the right level of medium, slathered in cheese, and fresh tasting. It's a solid, quality burger. But it's missing a bit in the way of flavoring or spice or pizzazz. Smashburger has a flavor to it that really brings it home. Chuckbox has a great mesquite whisper to it. Coal Burger didn't taste particularly much like anything special. I didn't get notes of coal/char. It was a completely serviceable, tasty burger, but it didn't blow me away, and for $12.50, I expected a bit more.  Now, that said, $12.50 is really only a couple bucks more than Five Guys and I didn't feel disgusting afterwards.   It's also worth noting that the sweet potato fries were some of the best I've ever had: crisp, but not burnt, and perfectly cooked. A good portion, but I could've used some aioli, and wasn't really looking to add 50 cent charges to try their sauces.   Overall, I'd probably give Coal Burger a 3.5, but the price and lack of HOLY BURGER impact left me at a 3.5. The sodas are an AWESOME treat, and the fries were perfect. Service was fast, friendly, and spot-on as well."}
{"text":"I loved this place!   I have a weakness for a burger and fries, but try to limit it since it's not the healthiest thing in the world. Plus I'm really trying to make an effort to be more socially conscious about the meat I choose to eat. Coal burger is the answer to this! It's a non-greasy, yet flavorful option that leaves me feeling satisfied and less guilty.   Our order:   *BBQ Burger (coleslaw, chipotle bbq sauce, and cheddar cheese). Great combo of flavors.   *Green Chili Burger (roasted green chilis, sweet jalapenos, and provolone). The spicy-sweet combo was really good, but it was a little dry so we added some the \"Coal Burger Sauce\" to it... Perfection! Coal Burger Sauce is like 1,000 Island but much, much better.   *Sweet Potato and Regular French Fries (cooked in rice bran oil - I've noticed this at a few restaurants. It must be a new trend). I liked them! The rice oil makes them a lot less greasy. I actually liked the regular fries better. Just order one basket for two people - plenty to go around.   *Sodas - I'm not a fan of sodas,  but Coal Burger doesn't carry your regular syrupy sodas. They have natural sodas made with cane sugar and flavors like ginger ale, lemon lime, and black cherry.   A little about portions, since I saw some yelpers comment about that.  The fries were generous and the burgers were normal-sized. I just think everyone is so used to the mass portions restaurants serve now, so these might seem small. I felt full and satisfied and my boyfriend did too (and he's in Fat Burger's hall of fame, so that should tell you something).  My spiel about grass-fed, pasture-raised beef and why I will pay a few extra dollars for it.  1) It's lower in fat (grain/corn diets are not what cows are meant to eat and it makes their meat fattier) 2) It tastes better... less processed.  3) No antibiotics or hormones 4) I just feel better buying meat from cows that were raised humanely.  5) I like to support small farmers/cattle ranchers (vs mass production corporations)"}
{"text":"The food wasnt bad but I have made burgers that taste the same on my own grill.  Serving average burgers wouldnt be so bad if the atmosphere was fun or gave you a happy feeling but that wasnt the case either.  I really dont see what the big deal is here.  30 dollars for a couple to eat and your burger is small.... Sorry I wont be going back."}
{"text":"So I am a HUUUUUUUUGE fan of Grimaldi's pizza so I was very excited to try out their burger joint with the coal oven taste.  However I was very disappointed that the burger and buns didn't have that smokey flavor the pizza's do.    Now I am not saying it was bad by any means but for the $13 ticket for a burger fries and a soda I don't think I will be back.  It's just not that good to demand that price.    It's worth a trip to try it out and with grass fed beef and natural sodas it's better quality than most burger joints.  The space is nice and large and there are many options from sauces to style of burgers.  Overall it's a 3/5 A-OK from me."}
{"text":"Had classic coal burger and fries. Everything was deliciousballs and the service was very attentive."}
{"text":"We went there on a Friday night as a party of 8, with 3 kids under the age 4. Surprisingly they don't list their kids menu on-line but have a friendly kid menu with hot dogs, chicken fingers and mac n cheese. Food arrived quickly and was delicious. I had a harvest salad and added some chicken, lets say delicious! I would definitely recommend it! The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is its a order at the counter and wait... Great food and very kid friendly!"}
{"text":"GOOD BURGER!  First thing i noticed when i walked in the door was all the help in their extremely bright green shirts.  YIKES!    I got the bacon cheeseburger with cheddar.  It was pretty tasty.  I bit heavy on the shredded lettuce, placed under the burger (weird! made the bottom bun soggy quickly too) but the cheese, CB sauce & bacon were good.  The beef was pretty tasty too. The pickles were really good.  What I didn't like was the price.  $9.25 for a burger and a drink.  That's a bit much by my standards.  I mean you could serve me 80 proof beef from cows that were raised on pure Jack Daniels and I'd think this a bit expensive.  Note that the burger was $6 and the soda and tax were the remainder.    Either way, it was good, just pricey.  I went with a coworker and she had a ground chicken burger that should woulda given 6 stars, but I disqualified her from rating since she hadn't eaten in 2 days and I think she would have given my shoe 5 stars.  She said it was really friggin good though."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place because its hard to find grassfed beef in most restaurants but he first time I checked out Coal Burger I thought it was over priced and not very tasty.  When I went back to give them another chance my original thoughts were validated."}
{"text":"I'm giving it 3-stars because I've never actually set foot in the place. My husband brought dinner home from here, so this review is based on food only. Fries-2 stars. Nothing special and not really crispy. Decent flavor, but basically like big, doughy potato strips a la Wendy's. Not my fav. Burger- 4 stars. I actually really like the flavor of the the burger. The crust on it from being seared in that oven- totally different taste from In n Out, which is the only other burger I eat.  The burgers are the same size as In n Out, which is fine with me. I don't understand the folks that complained that the burgers are small...if you need to gorge yourself, get the half-pounder. Sheesh. Also, I'm not a fan of tomatoes on my burger- they just make the bun all soggy, so, the fact that they don't offer fresh ones is fine by me. The \"coal sauce\" is pretty good on the burger, but nothing outstanding. It was really the actual burger that was the winner in this dinner."}
