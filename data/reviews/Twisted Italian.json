{"text":"Went to dinner here w my wife for her bday.  Nice decor.  Food was pretty good.  Calamari was great.  Waitress was a little slow in service.  Overall... I'd go again."}
{"text":"This was our first trip to Twisted Italian and definitely won't be our last.  The restaurant was gorgeous and fabulously trendy.  The television in the restroom was a nice touch.  The food was delicious!! I'm an Italian food lover and this restaurant conquered it.  We ordered the Sweet and Spicey Chicken Pizza and a Chicken Alfredo Pasta dish.  
The staff was friendly and the food was prepared quickly.
Next time we will try the wine (they even carry moscato!) And dessert!

It would be a solid 5 if portions matched the price."}
{"text":"Overpriced and over salted pasta. Don't expect any bread unless you want to pay an extra $.6.50, no salad. Anything added to the pasta will cost an extra $4 to $6 on to of the $11 dish . Service good but our first and last trip"}
{"text":"I was happy with the taste and size of portions here. I heard it was expensive and when I went it wasn't so that must've changed along the line. This is more of a contemporary Italian restaurant but it compliments the area well."}
{"text":"This owner is much more concerned about being 'right' than providing customer service!!  We have been there about 3 or 4 times in the past, but he is just SO Difficult to deal with.  He loves to say NO and is rude about it, too.  The food isn't bad, but it is over priced and he needs to understand that his customers need to WANT to come back, but if the owner does everything in his power to run this restaurant like an ARMY Barracks, then I would not be surprised if he didn't make it through the summer.  I have never written a review before, but we are upset about being treated so poorly.

Some of our complaints are more minor than others, but they all add up:
1 - Small side salad is $3   Large salad is $6.75, but is barely more salad in the large salad than the small one, just put it in a larger bowel.  And there was barely any dressing on either of the salads.  They used to have plenty of dressing on them, but not now. It's a shame, because this dressing is very tasty. Trying to save a penny at the cost of the enjoyment of this salad that we were looking forward to. 

2  The bread used to be served with a mixture of oil and herbs or seasonings, not quite sure what was in it.  We asked for butter with the bread, and got one little thing of butter, and none of the oil mixture.  We were told we could have either the oil mixture or butter, but not both.  He didn't mention that at the beginning, just brought the little butter and no oil mixture.  He said, we can't give things away for free!  What kind of response is that!!

3.  I asked if they could leave the green peppers off of the pasta dish and substitute mushrooms  and he told me NO!  What??  He just said NO.  He again said that he could not give things away for free!  He said he would have to charge us $1 for the mushrooms.  He didn't even say that nicely at the beginning, he just shocked us by saying NO.  I have never been treated this way before.  We should have been smart like some of the other reviewers and gone somewhere else, but we were tired and hot and hungry.  

Like some of the other 1 or 2 star ratings since last year mentioned, he is rude and he doesn't understand that the customer is #1 and should be treated well, not like he can't wait to get you out of the door.  He shoved our bill at us this evening, without even asking if we wanted coffee or desert.  And there were only two other tables during our entire meal, so they can't say they were too busy.  We will take our $30-$40 dinner budget somewhere else in the future.   Maybe we will even spend less and enjoy it more.  

 It is tough out there in this economy.  As customers, we should be appreciated and treated as if they are glad to have us instead of taking advantage and treating us poorly."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a late lunch today.   Alex was great.   The bruschetta we tried was good.  Especially the gorgonzola and honey.   Penne with Alfredo and broccoli was good, but skip the gnocchi with bacon.   Good sized portions and the prices were very reasonable."}
{"text":"Comfortable atmosphere, friendly and attentive staff, plus the food was excellent. I had the eggplant parm and it was delicious. We will come back."}
{"text":"Food was pricey for portion size and staff wasn't very attentive...even with the small location."}
{"text":"Smart & contemporary surroundings blend with warm home-style Italian taste, this new restaurant has the makings of becoming your favorite local hotspots. With a warm staff, stylish bar, and diverse menu, you'll keep coming back for more; Whether for family night out, drinks with friends, or a choice of savoury dishes. Its easy to see why this might be one of the only places to dine on the far northwest side of town."}
{"text":"This place has lots of yummy flavors!  The perogis are delicious.  The French dip is amazing as is the soup!  We will come back for sure!"}
{"text":"Walking in: very clean and modern. Was greeted immediately by friendly server.

Ordered:
Glass of Chianti. High quality and generous pout
Caesar Salad: disappointing. Store bought dressing and lettuce.   It was the add-on $3 version so I wont focus negative energy.

Entree: pasta fresca, perfectly cooked pasta, fresh sauce, generous garlic. A very strong 4 stars.

Overall: between 4 and 3 stars. Entree, Server and value scores the experience a 4"}
{"text":"Outstanding food, service and decor. Owner Mike was our server. Calamari was fresh cut strips, lightly breaded. No tentacles or frozen stuff, not over cooked. My dad had Alfredo with sausage which was all home made, great flavors. I had chicken Parmesan sandwich. Once again great flavor, lightly breaded topped with bruschetta and served on very soft roll. Will definitely go back when I return to AZ."}
{"text":"It had been many months since eating at Twisted Italian. The last time there we were quite pleased with the food. The bread and dipping oil were wonderful. In the past we had ordered the pizza which if memory serves had crust made with the same dough. It was more of a flat bread style but very good. Today being Sunday, we were intending to go to Lakeside as usual for lunch but with football on, it was very crowded. We decided to go back to Twisted Italian but what a difference a few months makes. It was as usual quite warm in there even with the front door open. We waited a few moments to be seated but the waitress seemed very nice. She took our ice tea orders and returned to take our lunch order. We ordered pizza, my husband the pepperoni and I the Margareta. We were never offered or served the bread and dipping oil as everyone else there had on their tables, but with having the pizzas, that was OK. The pizzas were a good size, a large personal size pizza, but that is where the good part ends. Both were bland, greasy, nearly cold and very doughy. We asked for red pepper flakes to shake on them, but even the nearly empty shaker of flakes couldn't help. We were both quite hungry but couldn't stomach more than one slice each. She did ask if there was something else we would like but it was so hot in there and we just wanted to leave. She did comp one of the pizzas which was nice, but we will never go there again. Back to Olive Garden for us for Italian."}
{"text":"Delicious Italian food. We've tried so many things on their menu and never been disappointed. Very reasonably priced and service is good too. They do weeknight specials too! I highly recommend their spaghetti and meatballs. Oh and the owners created this one dish that's like an Italian version of a chili relleno. OMG! It is crazy good!"}
{"text":"The food here is great!  Their marinara sauce has a slight hint of sweetness, just like my grandma used to make .   The Parmesan eggplant was amazing.  The service is always good and the decor is simple but nice .  This is a great local place to eat ."}
{"text":"In from out of town and knew nothing of the restaurant. Was very impressed with both the food and the service. The server was attentive but not annoying. The owner greeted us and asked after our experience. The food was fresh, with excellent flavor. The sauces tasted freshly prepared, with obviously not canned garlic. Our only regret is there isn't one in our area."}
{"text":"Worst pizza ever. Looked like someone took all the ingredients and dropped it on the pizza then let a 2 year old make a picture out of it. Why we ate half of it I will never know but we did. Thru the rest away and will never ever go back. If I could give a '0' I would have."}
{"text":"My wife and I went here for dinner hoping to find another.acceptable choice for dinner in the area. We were really disappointed.  After a nice dinner salad with a good strawberry vinegarette dressing, the meal went totally downhill.  I had the Sirloin Di Pizzaiola which had a strange texture and was very very chewy.  It was hard to even get my fork into it and a real chore to cut it with the provided steak knife.  It was bland and lacking in any real taste.  

My wife had the Chicken Parmigiana.  The breading on the chicken had a bad taste and combined with the sauce to make a strange paste.  The spaghetti with pomodoro sauce that came on the side was average at best.

The service was also below par as our waiter also doubled as the bartender and it took quite a while for him to process our payment.  All in all a very unpleasant experience."}
{"text":"Excellent authentic Italian food. Adorable, friendly and knowledgeable waitress named Courtney. She  was very welcoming and warm. Owner nice as well."}
{"text":"Awesome food great service! My new fav Italian restaurant! Yummy homemade sauce, everything we've tried there is awesome!!"}
{"text":"I have been here twice in the past couple months and this place is quickly becoming one of my mom's favorites in the area.  Friendly staff, good food, we will definitely be visiting again very soon."}
{"text":"WAY OVER PRICED for the type of food served.  Could get better food at Carrabba's Italian Grill for the same price.  Waitress took plate and drink away without asking if I was finished.  There was a black hair on the side of my plate which was obviously from the girl running the food out to the tables.  I would suggest having her hair tied or in a hair net.  Don't plan on going there again."}
{"text":"The Pasta Fresca was perfect. Slivers of garlic with a peppery undertone complimented the chopped tomato & basil. Everything tasted fresh. The angel hair pasta was cooked just right.
The portions are very generous. This was our first experience and definitely not the last."}
{"text":"Best caprese starter-best meatball sand-best chicken parma sand-best chicken Picatta- best pasta Picatta. Attentive service. Great neighborhood place. Been there five times."}
{"text":"Didn't feel like going out so we ordered food from uber eats. I got the twisted ravioli and it was so plain! Absolutely no flavor what so ever. I eat everything I don't complain unless something is wrong but that meal was so bland! The bruschetta and garlic bread were really good though"}
{"text":"We stopped in for lunch on our 20th Anniversary. I have to admit we were starving to. Luckily it was Wednesday and the wine bottes were1/2 off. Our waiter was awesome. We split the calamari which was perfect meaty and tender with a nice coating. The Sorrentino was huge. Everythimg went well with the twisted red zin our waiter picked out. Stop by and ask for Mike. You will be glad you did. Casual dining but real good food."}
{"text":"Clean looking place.  I had the Tuesday spaghetti and meatball special and saved a couple of bucks, otherwise I wouldn't even consider eating here.  They have the basic dishes- and the spaghetti was prepared perfect.  The place is similar to a Babbos.  But, the spaghetti was 100 times better.  The noodles were al dente, they were allowed to set-so you don't have a lake of water in the bottom of your bowl, also.  The sauce was authentico-made only from tomatoes (no Ragu here).  The bread was hot and had your basic dipping oil.  The meal was hot and they put Parmesan on if you want it (higher end places grate real Parmesan).  No surprises and cooked right on the mark and tasty. There were only half a dozen people there so, the food came fast.  the wait staff kept my drink full and never left me hanging.  I gave it 5 stars because I had no complaints and got In and out in no time. They have a bar and big screens.  Not bad- with drink and tip at about 12 bucks."}
{"text":"We try to get here often. Favorite night is Wine down Wednesday. Wine is half price. We love the chianti with any of the dishes. Very good food. Our favorite is the chicken marsala, and the Sorentino. My fav salad is the Gorgonzola Pear! For appetizer I love the mozzarella bread and sauce. The bolognaise sauce is super! Get it on the cheese ravioli!"}
{"text":"Very nice casual Italian family friendly restaurant. We've taken our 2yr old here several times. The owner even brought over a meatball when my dd was so hungry she couldn't wait!  Staff is very nice and food always comes out fast & hot. Food is soo good! Blows all other Italian restaurants out of the water!! Try the twisted ravioli and you can't go wrong w the meatballs."}
{"text":"After reading other people's praise of them having the best ravioli, I had to try it.  It is certainly delicious.  I don't usually see ravioli with Alfredo sauce but I generally like it and this one is very good and creamy.  They put a good amount of mushrooms and spinach in it also.  My son liked it very much and killed it off.  I'm not a big eater and almost always have leftovers but not this time.  I couldn't stop eating it so now I feel bloated.  It's a happy full feeling though :-)"}
{"text":"We use this restaurant mostly for take out but we really enjoy the food.  Our favorites are the Baked Ravioli with chicken and the Mediterranean Salad.  Both are real good.  We absolutely love the spring mix lettuce in the salad.

Some people complain that the place is not full, we find that a plus.  We are older and like the quite.  Too often you get in restaurants that are so noisy you can't talk or hear yourself think.  Even when the restaurant was mostly full, we haven't noticed that it is too loud like some places."}
{"text":"Waiter was great was new but tried really hard good job. However food was terrible pizza was flavorless watery from Italian beef  cheap ingredients also spaghetti was plain tasteless"}
{"text":"Came during lunch time and had a great experience. $7.99 for the lunch special was a great deal for what we got. Got the Italian Stack sandwich and the Chicken Pesto and both were delicious. We also got the garlic fries and they were soooooo good!!!! Will definitely come back and try their pasta dishes. Love supporting local small business and this one is a gem!"}
{"text":"take it from me. I'm Italian American. The Food here is fantastic. The Service is energetic and friendly. I had the sausage and peppers sandwich, my wife had the Lasagna. We were both RAVING about the food. That was our first visit to this restaurant. We can't wait to go back and try the pizza, etc."}
{"text":"Just OK.   First turn off when the server had her fingers wrapped around the rim of  both my water & wine glasses.   Yuck!   My dinner salad (that was not included with the entrée) was filled with diced red onion, so much that I could not pick it out, leaving all the diced tomatoes and carrots with it( 1/2 the salad).  The Twisted Ravioli picture looked really nice and was recommended by the server when I asked her opinion.  Unfortunately it was drowning in the Marcela sauce, which was just too overwhelming with garlic.  The Sorrento was good but not worth the cost."}
{"text":"Went there last night for the first time. The Twisted Ravioli was excellent. The baked Penne pasta was delicious and plentiful. The pepper, onion and sausage pizza was a bit under seasoned but edible. Will definitely go back.
Very attentive service."}
{"text":"Great food, value and service!  Kevin our server was excellent!  Will highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This review encompasses quite a number of visits to Twisted Italian. My wife and I try to go there about once a month. I can say with great enthusiasm that every visit has been a delight. The staff is friendly and attentive. The food is fresh, tastes awesome and very well seasoned. They have specials for everyday of the week; Monday is spaghetti and meatballs for $6.99. Great price for great food. As you can see, we are regulars on Mondays. We have tried the appetizers; garlic parmesan fries, bruschetta, and the mozzarella bread (mouth watering as I write this). All excellent starters. On yesterday's visit, we tried the red Sangria, hooboy was that refreshing! If I wasn't driving, I might have had two plus cocktails. In conclusion, any dish you order will be made with delicate perfection. Go and have yourself a good time at this Peoria pearl. We'll probably be back next Monday...suddenly I'm in the mood for spaghetti and meatballs :D"}
{"text":"Had a taste for a Chicago style Italian beef. Found it and much more at Twisted Italian. Fell in love with the garlic seasoned fries. Excellent food. Generous portions. Great attentive wait staff. Reasonable prices. Can't wait to go back. And it's in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Have been here 4 times and the first 3 times it was great then the last time we took some friends in from out of town and one of them ordered a mandarin orange salad. When she got her plate and started eating, the orange tasted bad. I took a bite out of it and yes, it was rotten. She returned the plate and a new one was brought to her but our server stated that when she took it in the back another server and the cook tasted it and it was just fine. I have opened a can of mandarin oranges before and out of the can I have experienced a rotten one in the can which could have been this problem but they cannot judge another one over the one we tasted. I am a cook and know when one is bad, and the one we tasted was BAD. For that we have not returned in a month and I was going there every week. Besides all this we were charged for this salad and most nice restaurants will not charge for something like this as our friend lost her appetite and did not even take her salad to go."}
{"text":"Great place to eat...good food great prices.....great service...so glag we found this place a mist try."}
{"text":"First of all, I would like to thank the staff at Twisted Italian for keeping their children's high chairs clean!!!  I am sick of greasy, nasty, filthy chairs that I need to put my child in.  I use a slip cover but still that's not enough.  So great job there!  The food was fast, hot, delicious!  The salad was cool, crisp, and perfectly dressed.  Thanks for a great dining experience!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I purchased the groupon and despite the mixed reviews, decided to take a chance on twisted italian. We were very impressed. The server was very sweet and always had a smile on her face, even when the place got busy. Our food was outstanding: Gorgonzola and pear salad is so fresh and the ravioli w Marsala Alfredo sauce was honestly some of the best pasta sauce we've ever tried. The cannoli was good too. Outstanding place and great prices! Would def go back and recommend to friends/family."}
{"text":"Ok the marinara sauce was spicy..? Cayenne pepper?
My daughter could not eat the spagetti.. thought that was safe for kids..
My husband loved the gnocchi, I had the shrimp scampi...4 shrimp! That's all.  Service was aloof especially the hostess"}
{"text":"My wife and I like to eat locally and we're excited to try this place out. We looked at the menu on line and were impressed with both the selection as well as the pictures posted here on Yelp. We arrived early for dinner at 4:30 after reading that it could get crowded.  We were seated immediately and given menus.  There were only two other couples in the restaurant at that time . There seemed to be about 3 or 4 waitress moving around as well as the blond woman who seated us. There was also a middle aged man standing behind the bar .  We had decided to have the bruschetta appetizers, with a bottle of Malbec wine from the wine list. My wife was to have the shrimp scampi and I was going to order the stuffed pepper entre. Unfortunately we weren't able to sample any of this because we were completely ignored by the staff even after trying to catch their eye (s) ...at 5:00 we decided to leave..a total of half an hour with not just bad service but no service at all.
    It's amazing to me how a staff can completely ignore their customers..guess they want to cater to the younger crowd...but this senior citizen won't be back.."}
{"text":"I've given this place more than a few attempts to redeem itself. I personally feel that just because I had a bad experience at first doesn't necessarily mean it'll be bad the second or third time. Could've been a hiccup of sorts or poor staff.

That being said, my latest \"adventure\" was nothing short of a dissaster. Sounds a bit dramatic I know but let me explain. I walk in, look around, place is empty and there's no hostess or a sign that says seat yourself...nothing. My boyfriend and I look at eachother and shrug so we find a cozy spot in a booth/table. It was a chilly evening and some italian comfort food sounded pretty good to me. Funny thing is my boyfriend warned me we should have gone to Olive Garden or something but I didn't want to drive far. 

About 8-10 minutes go by and a waitress who looked like she was not enjoying her day looks at us and sighs heavily. I looked at my watch to check if perhaps we came in right before closing time. (I know I would hate it as a server therefore I try to never do that) ...it was 8:30. 

I shrug it off thinking she's just having a bad day so I'm super nice to her and ask her how her day was...\"fine\" OK I get it cool. I ask for some cheesy bread for starter and a diet coke. (I know it's bad for you and I don't drink it often but I was in the mood for one and so was my bf) She asked us if we were ready to order our dinner, I said no, and she says, \"Well just holler at me when you're ready\" K...

Cheesy bread comes and it's cold, diet cokes are flat and I'm biting my tongue. If there's one thing I hate it's complaining when the server is already upset. I didn't want anyone spitting in my food. My bf looks at me and pretty much reads my mind. We agreed to stay and see how the main course goes. 

At this point, we're ready to order...I decide with the baked ziti and the bf orders just a cheese pizza. Thinking sure that should be manageable right? No...food was cold and the pizza contained onions? Never asked for them and they aren't even standard on a cheese pizza. I'm thinking at this point that someone is totally messing with us. Needless to say, I would not be giving this place a fifth chance. I'M DONE!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this restaurant! Their pizzas are delicious, you can't beat their pesto cream sauce, and the pistachio ice cream dessert is to die for!"}
{"text":"We ordered for take out. Food was amazing and tasted fresh! And the take out wait wasn't long at all. We normally dine in but that take out was just as great! I'd highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Tried this place and for the price...go somewhere else.  The food was overpriced and very greasy.  Not to mention, it took close to an hour to get our order, which was my husband, myself, and my sons kids meal.  I had the Mediterranean shrimp, and my husband had the lasagna special.  At the end of the meal, the waitress had ignored us so long, I had to walk to the bar and pay.  She was in back for so long.  Every once in a while she'd make a quick appearance walking by, then straight back the to the kitchen."}
{"text":"They had fantastic food, I will continue to go to try even more. The price was reasonable, and the staff was quick and super helpful."}
{"text":"This place makes really good Italian food. We had the meat lovers pizza. The crust is thin and crisp with tasty toppings.  We also had a delicious boneless pork chop masala with mushrooms and prosciutto. We have enough good food for lunch.  Good service was an addied bonus"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were craving a great Italian meal, unfortunately we received something less tonight at Twisted Italian. As we walked in the door the hostess looked us up and down in a snarky manner. Our waitress was also a tad snotty. 

Like other reviews say the starter bread is bland and basically is the equivalent of Subway's sandwich bread.

I ordered the eggplant parmigiana which was fine. It came with a side of spaghetti which was topped with sauce from a Ragu bottle (or so it tasted). My boyfriend ordered the Fettuccine Alfredo with Chicken, he says it was just noodles. Nothing great."}
{"text":"I was so appalled by the greeting I received at Twisted Italian today. My friend and I stopped in with our children for lunch and were immediately greeted by the owner, who seemed annoyed when we asked for two high chairs. As he was getting the high chairs, one of the boys (age 1 1/2) was saying something and was immediately told, \"shhhhhhhh!!\" by the man. Not even 2 seconds later one of the boys yelled excitedly. Before we even had a chance to tell the boys to use their \"inside voices,\" the man angrily replied, \" ok...this is not going to work.\" He then proceeded to put the high chairs back. He then told us to \"have a nice day.\" I was in shock. May I also add that we were literally the ONLY people in the entire place. Now I can see why. It was our first time to Twisted Italian and we will not be returning. I suggest not even bothering having high chairs in your establishment when you are, clearly, not family friendly. Makes me sick to my stomach that someone could behave so hatefully towards children."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time tonight, found it by accident. Service was an A+.  Our server was Alex. He was great, super nice and attentive to all the customers. The bruschetta was very good. We had chicken piccata and a margherita pizza. Both were delicious. We will be going back."}
{"text":"Great service. 
Flavorful food. 

My Lover had the meatball sub. Hearty portion of meat and the garlic/parm fries were amazing!

I enjoyed the cheese ravioli in a Marsala Alfredo sauce. Very very good! 

Ended the visit with a cannoli. They make them in house. Very light and whipped perfectly.  

I can't wait to go back. They seem to have great specials throughout the week."}
{"text":"Under new ownership and the ambiance and food quality show it!  Brian, the new owner, is very visible and kind. 

The Pierogies are to die for!!  I had both the Traditional and South of the Border. The latter have ghost pepper influences, but not too hot. Very tasty!

Brian's special recipes are outstanding. He even knows how to use butter correctly!

I highly recommend a stop here for some really twisted Italian."}
{"text":"Went in for appetizer and ordered dinner to go. My friend requested an ice coffee and waitress said they couldn't make that but we could walk next door to Dunkin' Donuts! While reviewing the menu I see under drinks they make cappuccinos but whatever. Apps were fine however shrimp not my favorite (sauce was a little watery) shrimp were over cooked. Waitress agreed and said yeah I thought they looked over cooked!! Ordered side of garlic fries, those were so good! To go order arrived and I didn't see the additional dressings requested. Get home to find no soup which we paid an additional up charge for, salad dressings incorrect. 

I'd go back and try other items on menu mostly because there are not that many lunch spots around. I would recommend your waitress to write down her orders and to offer in house suggestions instead of offering us to leave and go to Dunkin' Donuts. Very tacky I should add we were only one of 3 tables seated so it was not busy. Her service is why I'm only rating a 3."}
{"text":"My husband and I met some friends last Saturday night, walk right in and got a table....no wait!  Our first time eating here so was not sure how it was going to be....pleasantly surprised!  I had the chicken pesto pasta and it was delicious, my husband loved his ravioli.  Reasonably priced - had a special buy one pasta, get one half off. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Had the Mediterranean salad with salmon,   husband had the twisted ravioli and our daughter had the spaghetti with Alfredo sauce.  All was delicious!! Got there during happy hour and drinks were $2 off... even better.  I will be coming back and I definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Here again and it is just as delicious as the first time reasonably priced uncomplicated menu delicious Italian food and I'm from New York"}
{"text":"My husband and I went there last night for the first time and we will be back.  We had a great dinner and the owner stopped by and talked to us for a while, he was great.  The place was packed on a Thursday night and the food was fantastic.  Beer mussels, twistedcitrus salad and Penne Fra Diavio and lots of bread!  Yum!"}
{"text":"Just ate a great meal at Twisted Italian.  Small, casual and very friendly staff.  Manager took the time to introduce himself.  Priced right, nice portion size."}
{"text":"Love this place, so far all the food is tasty and fresh, the sauce is soooo good never tasted anything like it, it really makes a difference in making the pizza! 
The place is super clean and the server is always pleasant 
The ambiance is so alive! Love coming here."}
{"text":"Everything was excellent. Service was timely, drinks were the proper strength and server recommendations were on point. Pricing was better than we expected, especially considering the portion size."}
{"text":"The owner was extremely rude to my friends and I. We wanted to use 2 Groupons and he came out and very rudely told us we couldn't. The restaurant was dead with only 2 other tables seated. Seems to me like he could've used the business even if it was with Groupons. We left and had a very nice dinner at Olive Garden. I will never go back to give my business to a RUDE owner!!"}
{"text":"Great food and service!  We had the cheesy garlic bread, salmon Caesar salad and meatballs special.  Yummy!This is our first visit here and we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The food was great, service was great and décor is nice too.  Also, the prices were reasonable.  Will definitely go again."}
{"text":"We love this place. Nice cozy place and excellent food. We've ordered several different items and everything is good. I've read several complaints about the service, we have had no problems. We've eaten here several times and the staff has always been awesome. Take out or dine in this place is great."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere here and the food is pretty good. Prices are fair and its nice and close. We will be back."}
{"text":"Great food, great service. We were the last dinners on a recent Sunday evening. We wanted to dine outside ( no problem) and rearranged the tables ( no problem). We had a complicated food and drink order( no problem). Our guests demanded a lot of attention from the staff ( no problem). The food was great, the service evening better. I'd go back in a minute."}
{"text":"The sauces are divine! The pasta is always perfectly aldenté. The service is good. They've a nice wine list. And you can doll-up or come in shorts! You kind of forget you're in a strip mall Albert a very nice one. This place is great for date night but not a really big group though. It's not very big and maybe seats 40, that may be generous. Nice little surprise for local Italian!"}
{"text":"Far above the average strip mall Italian restaurant. Everything is fresh and very well cooked.
The selection and service are hard to beat..we eat there a couple of times a month for lunch"}
{"text":"We've given this restaurant three different chances to impress and unfortunately not quite there.  The quality of wait staff and friendliness are great.  Nice environment as well.  Food quality is okay.  Don't expect top notch authentic italian food here.  The last time we went I had chicken parmesan with a side of pasta.  The chicken was cooked perfectly but the sauce was bland on both dishes.  Not a bad place but it is what it is.  Casual italian food around the same quality as Olive Garden maybe just below."}
{"text":"Wife and I visited for date night.  Fantastic food, excellent staff, and great menu choices!  Wife did not like the house cab, took it off the bill no questions.  Asked for a vegetarian version and had no issues!  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"My husband and I returned from a long drive from New Mexico. We didn't care to cook and had wanted to try this new restaurant in our area. We decided to order \"to go\" so we could relax and enjoy what we thought would be a delightful dinner. What a dissapointment.
We both ordered the Pasta Pescadore (of course having seafood it was the most expensive on the menu at $16.75), with it we also ordered the caesar salad at $3.00 each. A grand total of $44.00.
We opened our caesar salad box which was shreds of lettuce, 3 croutons and a container of terrible dressing. A head of lettuce costs an 1/8 the price of this salad. I could not eat mine.
Our \"pasta\" was your basic spagetti. No denying there was a lot. But we had exactly 3 muscle shells, mine minus 1 muscle, 3 shrimp, 1/4 piece of a scallop,and 1 strip of calamari. My husband had no scallop piece.
There was barely any pomadore sauce, no taste, no spice, no spunk.
What a waste of calories and money.

We are not ones to complain but I must say when we got home and I opened the containers my husband was prepared to pack everything up and return it. I was too tired and convinced him to just eat it and consider it a lesson learned.
Now we tried it we will never go back.
Thank God I bought some Dunkin Doughnuts to save the night.
Being in the service industry and knowing a lot of people this is one restaurant that will not get our recomendation. I predict if things don't change your doors will close.

Thanks for giving me a stomach ache."}
{"text":"It was our first time here and we're very welcomed by Marty who served up an amazing lunch and dining experience! A very quaint place with amazing dishes! The meatballs were outstanding!"}
{"text":"Italian with a Mexican influence. It was very good but wished the menu was less generic. That said, I will totally go back. Legit beer menu, good wine menu. Food wise - their tomato sauce is really good. It has a very fresh taste to it that I enjoyed. I had the chicken + eggplant parm dish (Sorrento). Was great - chicken was not over done. 

Totally recommend if you are looking for main stay pasta and Italian dishes. What they do is very good."}
{"text":"We came in for lunch on a Sunday and it wasn't too crowded. It took quite a while for our drinks to come out. They did bring out bread and olive oil. The fiance ordered a Mediterranean Chicken salad and I got a penne dish with artichokes, chicken, and mushrooms. We were both sorely diappointed with the quality of the food. His salad had a few cold chicken strips on it (the same ones that were on my pasta). The pasta was ok, but it was probably something I could easily make at home. It would have been ok if we paid 5 dollars each, but the salad was 11 and the pasta was 13 bucks! We don't mind paying these prices if the food is good, but what a rip off. This place is way too overpriced for the quality of food. The pizzas looked ok, so maybe that would be the way to go. I wouldn't reccomend this place."}
{"text":"The lasagna is excellent enough to share and still take home!! A must have and new to menu.  Hubs shrimp scampi a little bland but he likes spicy that's why he fell in love with me!!!  Again, get the lasagna mine was beef & pork. Very very good. Would be 5 stars except for hubby."}
{"text":"Great place!  We just moved here, and being Italian, I am extra judgmental of Italian food.  It was delicious!  We had the Spicy Meatball Pizza, spaghetti with marinara sauce, and mozzarella sticks... delicious!  We will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"We came to the Phoenix area and had to try this small Italian restaurant. We started with calamari and the they brought out the classic bread and oil. Great experience. Tried an Italian beef sandwich and it was very good. We're here for the week and we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The fried calamari was really rubbery, but the coating was really flavorful. Our server was less than attentive to our party. Drinks were forgotten or never refilled, bread was given to us after our entree. We asked for more and she never brought it out. Their saving grace was the garlic fries and combo beef and sausage sandwich. This thing is a HUNK! I ate about 1/6 of the sandwich and had to stop. They do not skimp on the meat, cheese or peppers. Left overs for daysss."}
{"text":"Went for my birthday,  party of 9, (they took our reservation!) And had a great time!! Food was obviously made to order. We ordered chicken parmesan, chicken marsala, eggplant parmesan, fettuccine alfredo wth shrimp..... all delicious!!! Service was great too... we'll be back"}
{"text":"This was our first dining experience at Twisted Italian.   I have been made to understand that they have been opened for about a month now, and I was surprised to see so many  tables filled. 

We ordered the Twisted Shrimp appetizer. What a treat! Perfectly grilled, succulent large shrimp with a most unusual sauce. The sauce was a little spicy, sweet , perfectly seasoned, and a touch of balsamic. EXCELLENT!   We also ordered the chicken parmigiana, eggplant parmigiana and the chicken Marsala. It was very hard to pick which dish was best.

 The chicken in both dishes was flavor full, and moist , and the breading was perfectly season, and CRISPY.  The Marsala sauce was smooth, buttery, and just the right touch of Marsala, and mushrooms. The chicken parmigiana pomodoro sauce boasted of fresh herbs, garlic and tomatoes.  The pasta was perfectly cooked, 

If you were ever disappointed in ordering egg plant parmigiana in the past , at other restaurants, give it another chance. This is the best eggplant parmigiana I had ever eaten, it WASN'T, greasy, soggy or watery. Rather, a crisp bread coating and again that wonderful pomodoro sauce. 

We could hardly breathe after this feast, but gave in, and ordered the Pistachio Tartufo. Pistachio gelato rolled in pistachios and chocolate shavings, drizzled with chocolate, to die for! 

Generous portions! A very relaxing and inviting ambiance. DEFINITELY, on our \"favorites\" list.

{"text":"We have moved to the area and are trying out all of the local restaurants. This is a cute little Italian place in a busy shopping center. The service was friendly and attentive. I liked that bread was brought out with an oil balsamic mixture that was very good. I ordered the ravioli in a marsala  cream sauce that I thought was pretty good. My husband had the buffalo fettuccine alfredo which he really liked."}
{"text":"This place was good when it first opened but has seriously gone down hill since then. Last night we had a take out order which was not correct. The girl on the phone seemed distracted and confused.  We didn't get some of our order but what we did get was less than great. We are thouroughly disappointed and have taken it off of our go to resteraunts."}
{"text":"I had a Groupon and I wanted to try out the place. It's very clean and has a nice atmosphere. The food was really good, but the prices... Not so much. It costs extra if you wanted to have meat or fish with your pastas. I think it was too over priced. We were the only people there, which also made me question the place. But I can see why there were not that many people. If they just lowered the price a bit, it would attract more customers. Overall, the food was great!"}
{"text":"Have you ever left a restaurant and couldn't wait to tell others about it?  Well, this just happened to me when I visited the Twisted Italian.  At first glace it looks like a typical little eatery. To my suprise this place was more than that, it was perfect.  Only one table was occupied when we arrived, but the restaurant slowly it began to fill.  

I personally sampled: 

Applewood Smoked Bacon & melted Ricotta Bruschetta, 
Pasta Picatta with spinach, roma tomato, fresh garlic and herbs,
Meatball Pizza with housemade meatballs, melted mozzarella and marinara sauce
Tiramisu
Cannoli

The food was so simple and yet it made you just crave another bite.  Everything was amazing, however the meatball pizza stole the show.  Wow yourself with the meatballs and the best marinara suace I have ever had.  

Mike the owner was our server.  He was an excellent waiter, of course he knew every thing about his menu, and he was on top of everything. 

Amazing food, and amazing service.  I did go back the very next weekend and shared the following items: Meatball Sandwich, Meatball Calzone, Pizza Bianco.  Too full for desert.  

This is my first review.  I have threatened to write many reviews, however this eatery really earned this one."}
{"text":"I wanted to keep it my little secret but hey, I'm gonna share.  Twisted Italian is just an amazing restaurant!!  Why, because it works for everyone.  It's family friendly, the staff is wonderful and Brian the owner can cook like nobody's business!!  I'm from the Midwest and I love Chicago style beef, but the salads and the soup and the bread  (did I mention the bread) just remind me of home!!  The prices are great and there are lunch specials,  1/2 off wine Wed. and the deserts just make me smile!!  I had the strawberry salad with goat cheese and salmon today and my husband had the chicken panini!!  They also cater and have food to go so this is my favorite little bistro secret that I've finally decided to share.  Enjoy!!!"}
{"text":"This is a small gem. Good food and prices. Had the Chicago beef and lasagna both excellent.  Homemade soup too. Would have been 5 stars but the service was really slow and they missed some of our order. Still recommend."}
{"text":"Great little place amongst a sea of hohum chains. I had penne far diavolo and it had a nice kick. Husband had pasta Al fresco which was a great combo of crushed tomatoes, garlic and basil over angel hair pasta. Very reasonable and nice choice of wines. Great service too."}
{"text":"We have dined here for three years now and sometimes twice a week we love it that much! The food has always been delicious but in the last year it has been taken to a new level. The service is always great, the beverages have expanded to scrumptious and the menu as evolved to superb! Thank you to the entire team at Twisted!"}
{"text":"The service here was awful.  I'm not sure if the food or the rude management was worse.  There are far too many good Italian restaurants in the area to ever come back here again. Skip it would be my recommendation."}
{"text":"Called to make a to-go order and was put on hold by a gentleman, which was no problem.  A minute later, a woman answer and said, \"yeaaahhh?!\"  It was so rude.  I eat there at least twice a week because I like their pasta diablo, but I will not be returning. Customer service is dying or it's already dead."}
{"text":"Everything we have tried here is amazing! We love the authentic Chicago dishes and their lasagna is amazing."}
{"text":"Ok this isn't going to be like wow that was the best Italian I've ever eaten, but I don't think that is the goal.  I think it is an appealing place this is serving high quality Italian food quick.  We had the calamari, I had sausage/pepper dish, and partner had raviolli.  Service was great, food was good, and wine wasn't bad.  Limited selections but I think that is part of hte charm.  For sure on our regular short list."}
{"text":"Been here since the original owners so wanted to give it another try.
Meatball sliders were good, especially for the Happy Hour price!
Had the Mac'n Cheese w/Pancettavery good!
Will be back! Love supporting local businesses!
Back again and this time tried the Italian Beef with Garlic Fries.OMG!! One of the best beefs I've had and I've lived back east and been to Chicago a hand full of times. Damn good!"}
{"text":"Very reasonable prices for Brunch, Lunch and dinner. This is my second time here, great food and superb service. I will definitely come back for more!!"}
{"text":"We've been going to Twisted Italian for almost 3 years now.  Mostly dinner, bit it's always been a good meal.  The prices are reasonable and the food is simple, but very tasty.  We have recommended the establishment to numerous people and they all comment how much the enjoyed it.  Make sure to try the calamari - you'll be glad you did."}
{"text":"I typically love this place... but have been ordering it Togo lately and it has been SO PATHETIC! Most ridiculous $13 salad I have ever purchased. I'll be finding a new spot for a decent salad."}
{"text":"Started off with Calamari that was the most delicious tender Calamari we've ever eaten.  Cheese Ravioli was delishiously creamy and cheesy and the Chicken Marsala was amazing!

Olive oil, vinegar and bread was fabulous too.

TV in the bathroom was a nice touch!  Ambiance and Service were stellar too!  Hope to be back soon!"}
{"text":"Great food, but very small and minimal seating. I don't recommend sitting at the bar where we were sat due to no tables being available. The bar doubles as the to go counter so too many people standing next to us while we tried to enjoy our food. Other than that, food was definitely worth trying again. The lasagna was amazing, as was the chicken Parmesan sandwich and Chile relleno entree."}
{"text":"We visited on a Saturday evening dining room was half-full, very disappointed in the fact that the complementary bread and olive oil didn't come till after the food arrived! Food was mediocre, OK nothing to write home about! Was excited to try some homemade meatballs but they were fair and marinara sauce was very heavy and the chicken piccata was thick versus ultra thin cutlet like it should be. Waitress was fair not overly friendly or helpful. I was indecisive between two entrées and looking for some guidance but she was just silent so I ended up going with the chicken. The dining room was ultracold to the point it was uncomfortable. With so many other local Italian restaurant probably will not be visiting again!"}
{"text":"We were visiting family who just purchased a home down the road and decided tried this place for the first time!!  We didn't know what to expect but we were pleasantly surprised.  The pierogis were awesome and our salads and pizza were just as good.  We will definitely be back next time we visit."}
{"text":"Nice staff and interesting food combinations! Loved it!"}
{"text":"wonderful Italian in a little place!  if i lived in Peoria i would be dinning there every night.  everything was wonderful and fresh.  the waitress was very friendly and helpful with everything from food to wine ideas.  it was a wonderful dinner and i would go back in a heartbeat if i am in that area again!!!!  we also had a piece of cake for desert and it was sinfully delicious! yum!!"}
{"text":"We love this place. Everything we've ordered has been delicious. Huge portions! It's not a very big place so big parties would be difficult."}
{"text":"My wife and I were out and about and in need of lunch, but we didn't feel like our normal restaurants. We stopped in to Twisted Italian and were happy to find we really enjoyed the food.  Our waiter, Alex,  was personable and seemed eager to help. He made it feel like we were just hanging out with a guy who really wanted to bring us food and make us happy - rather than a waiter. It was fun and refreshing.

We started with the Garlic Parmesan Fries, Pizza Style. Crispy delicious fries covered in pepperoni and melted mozzarella with some marina on the side for dipping. Super tasty - my only complaint was I couldn't stop eating them and grew worried I'd be too full for my entree. 

My wife had the Mediterranean Pasta. She's a pesto lover and said Twisted's pesto is excellent,  creamy with good flavor. I ordered the Italian Deli Melt sandwich - good meats, good dressing, and a nice toasted roll. I would definitely order this sandwich again, and if I don't it's only because I want to try all their other sandwiches.

Good food, good prices, and really friendly and helpful service. Definitely try this restaurant!"}
{"text":"I had relatively low to no expectations walking in the door and I was completely blown away. Everything was fresh and delicious! The marinara tasted great and my meatball sub was fantastic. 

Mike was an incredible host and super friendly. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I typically wouldn't take family to a restaurant that has an overall 3 star Yelp rating. It's not that I blindly trust everyone here, but I have found that overall it is pretty spot on and why take family to a 3 star location? Well, in this case I took a risk and was able to nervously exhale very early in the experience.

Like I said, I had family from out of town in and we didn't want to drive all the way to Arrowhead for Italian food. We had seen the Twisted Italian before but were skeptical. Once in through the front doors, I immediately had to adjust my preconceptions. The Twisted Italian is much more family oriented than I had thought. Very well lit, larger tables, very open. I guess I never really looked through the window to see what was inside. We were seated immediately which scared me for a Saturday night. Did everyone else know something we didn't?

Our waitress came over fairly quick and we had our drinks in a very short time after she took the requests. We ordered some bruschetta for an appetizer even though we all noticed it had honey drizzled on it. The waitress came back after putting our appetizer order in to get our main order. There were 6 of us and she took each of our orders without writing a thing down. Not ever being in that industry, it scared me. I shouldn't assume everyone else has my horrible memory. The bruschetta came and it was pretty good. Fresh chopped vegetables, good crumbled cheese, and drizzled honey. Unfortunately, the honey did detract from the classic bruschetta flavor I was looking for, but I won't ding them for it because I went into it eyes open. My penne alfredo with sausage arrived piping hot along with all of the other guests' dishes withing a very reasonable time in the kitchen. Now, the menu said the alfredo sauce is home made or something, but I don't care where it came from, it was very good. The pasta was cooked just right and the sausage was very complimentary as well. My wife's spaghetti was also cooked just right and the sauce and meatballs were surprisingly good as well. In the first 5 minutes of the meal we looked at each other with a mutual expression of,\"Damn, why haven't we been coming here all this time?\". Better later than never I suppose.

The staff was great. When the door is opened for you as you walk up to the restaurant, they are earning cool points right out of the gates. Our waitress was definitely a cut above what I have experienced in other restaurants. She indeed did remember the order I was worried about previously, never let my tea or my company's drinks get below half full, was deeply knowledgeable of the menu, and was more than happy to adjust the orders to our preferences. She was simply pleasant to have and let us do what we came to do, eat our meals and have a nice conversation among ourselves.

If the Twisted Italian has been one of those places you have walked by and never really paid attention to like I had been, go for it. I can't do 5 stars because it didn't blow me away so this is one of the most solid 4 star ratings I can give. We will definitely be going back. There was a lot more on the menu that I want explore."}
{"text":"We ate here with another couple, one man running the whole restaurant, it took forever to get food! He was not friendly and was robot like taking orders and delivering food! I think it's over priced and small portion! Was surprised no pasta came with chicken piccata, I think I can make it better at home, and I'm not Italian! Not close to home so probably would not make the drive to try again!"}
{"text":"We have been to Twisted Italian many times. This is the first time the food was only mediocre. We started with the calamari. It was overcooked and rubbery. I had the strawberry goat cheese salad w/salmon. The salad was amazing except for the salmon. It was hard and crusty on one side and dry. The piece was thin and clearly overcooked. Our waitress never came by to ask how our meal was so I mentioned it when she brought the bill. She told me I should have told her about it. I would have had she come to the table.   The salmon was taken off the bill but that does not remedy the lack of a good dinner out."}
{"text":"Very welcoming staff. I was here on a Sunday afternoon and it seemed the other patrons were 30-40 years my senior. My little man was drawn in by the colors on the specials menu. Food looked amazing.  We had a pizza and a calzone. Both were good Food came to the table like warm. The crust light golden brown and soft. The cheese was perhaps the most appealing... luscious strands of freshly warmed cheese is always a win. I ordered cannoli and the waiter came to let me know they were out of cannoli cream and making it fresh.:. It only take a minute he said... I was nervous!!! The cannoli was brilliant !!!!! Rich creamy perfection I have not found elsewhere
Strange darker decor complete with fake grape vines wrapped in Christmas lights. The ceiling and mounted wall title scream for a modern presentation but the odd mix of high top and low top tables the. Half fabric covered booths  say no. Despite the lack of decor the food and staff make for a wonderful meal! Updated decor would make this an elite spot sure."}
{"text":"The waitress did an excellent job trying not to neglect tables and make up for the inexcusable amount of yelling and cursing coming from the kitchen.  Eating raviolis made by the famous italian chef Antonio Carluccio while having Luciano Pavarotti sing table side could not make-up for or drown out the vulgar language coming from the kitchen.  The waitress was obviously uncomfortably embarrassed and apologetic for this behavior, but I will still never eat at Twisted Italian again and recommend others to stay away."}
{"text":"This place is not good for pasta dishes. If you want a sandwich...maybe. I ordered the penne baked pasta and it was so overcooked, The sauce was pasty and the mystery meat was dry. My daughters chicken Marsala was so thinly slice it was like paper.. Way overpriced. Will not go back."}
{"text":"My wife and I 'winter' in the Peoria market. We like to try new places out. Checked out ratings on Yelp of Italian Restaurants in Peoria. This rated high so picked up a menu and gave it a try on Saturday late afternoon. They don't take reservations...no problem for us. Greeted at the door by owner/manager...immediate seating. Not large but casual and cool. Big screens on the wall. Great waitress...made sure we had time to check menus. Had cheese bread..GREAT! Bottle of wine..Twisted @ $20./bottle...(tasty Cab).generous portions...ravioli, pasta piccata both great.

This place is priced very reasonably, provides great service and offers great food..All Good! We recommend highly and will be back! J/J"}
{"text":"Chicken Fettuccine Alfredo is great. Friendly people, great service. This is a nice little independent Italian restaurant. I would recommend you giving it a try."}
{"text":"Incredible Italian and great Happy Hour pricing.  Love this place and the Chicago Style Italian beef pizza.  You don't know what you are missing"}
{"text":"Visiting lovely Peoria for the USA 17U Championship.  Family ritual, Italian before the first game.  My son has a team meeting at 9 pm, I look for Italian close by and come across Twisted Italian!  

We ordered take out.  The dishes were well prepared very flavorful.  My daughter who loves ravioli and has it everywhere we go announced it was the best ravioli she's ever had.  My penne with broccoli and shrimp was fabulous -- my son's penne peppernota was very good.

The restaurant is located in a mall, but it is too cute.

Highly recommend -- service was friendly --food was provided quickly -- price was right!"}
{"text":"Twisted Italian never disappoints. Staff are great, even with 1 waitress and a more than half full restaurant, it was fantastic service! Red sangria tastes delicious and is only $5. This time I had the eggplant dinner that came with cheesy spaghetti and I loved it! Will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I met up for dinner here on her recommendation. I had never been here before so i figured why not try something new. The dining room is tiny but well appointed. The tv's on the walls were a great touch to the decor. Service was fast and very friendly. We had the calamari appetizer and it was excellent. My girlfriend had a salad with shrimp and I had the penne alfredo with chicken. We then shared a slice of cheesecake for desert. After dinner i felt full but not as if i were going to explode. The portion sizes were perfect. The food was great and the place was neat and clean, but the biggest reason I gave Twisted Italian 5 stars was the service. I didnt feel rushed and i didnt feel ignored. Our server was friendly and courteous and thats enough to make the difference between a good experience and a great experience. I will be returning."}
{"text":"Not pleased with this place after 4 visits. I want it to get better and alas am always left unfulfilled. Most recently, which has sparked this review, I got the Italian Beef pizza as a take out order.  Picked up on time and was surprised to open the box to a sloppy soggy mess. The crust is not \"Chicago crispy\" at all.  There is no crisp on the entire 16\" pie.  I am very disappointed and will second guess our choice to return here.  

In the past I've had the chicken Caesar, which is just ok -- and the ravioli- which was smothered in cheese to the point of nearly being inedible.  

If you like gobs of cheese and oversized portions... this should pit your bill."}
{"text":"Our first time here, we had fried zucchini, fried calamari, Italian Salad and the Italian beef sandwich.. everything was delicious, service was great (thank you Shane!) and we will be back for sure! 
Note to the owner: we live in the area but have never been in before because the decal of the sandwich on your front door makes it look like a fast food joint.. I didn't know there was such a nice little restaurant in here until I happened to see some pictures on yelp.. so may consider taking that down to give the impression the place is more upscale.. also, open the front blinds at night so people can see what a cute little place it is inside! :o)"}
{"text":"Came back to try this restaurant!  the previous owner and the previous experience was horrible !! Found out there was a new owner so came back today food was excellent our server Heather was wonderful and the owner Brian came out introduced himself and was very pleasant!! We will definitely be back this is our new Italian hang out!!"}
{"text":"The service and food he was perfect! Best bread everrrrr! The place is fun, very clean and lots of smiles on the helps faces. The manager approached us and asked us how everything was which is always nice. We enjoyed our food, we went bland and just had a cheese pizza and salad and wine, but everything like I said was perfect. If you are a bread eater, their crust is awesome too! We'll be back!!!"}
{"text":"Loved it. I ordered a spaghetti with meat sauce,cheese pizza,and a Chicago beef sandwich. All was very good and would recommend and visit again. Pricing was good."}
{"text":"I'm Italian and from NJ. I went here because it was recommended by a friend. The service was great, but the food was awful. I would not go back."}
{"text":"I had the Alfredo and it tasted off. It was not enjoyable. I also did not enjoy the presentation of the food. It seemed cheaper than others in the price range."}
{"text":"We have made this a regular place to eat, went here first because of a Groupon. The calamari is excellent, even my seafood hating kids love it. I have had several of the pasta dishes (that I sample from my boys plates) but I always fall back on the spaghetti and meatballs. It can be a little pricey, but your eating out, expect to spend some money. They usually have a Groupon, so check there first to lessen the bill. Overall, the food is great and the staff has always been good to us."}
{"text":"EXCELLENT was there for Sunday Brunch  and had the beef omelette Did I say EXCELLENT! Have been here many times and never disappointed! Another thing I noticed they use a Clorox wipes to clean the tabletops and seats and throw out the wipe and not reused! EXCELLENT idea and wish other restaurants would use this idea vs using the same old cloth over and over again! Perhaps we can start a trend! Keep up the good work guys IT WAS GREAT!"}
{"text":"This was my second visit and I am a huge fan, officially hooked. Started with the calamari, it was nice and crisp (sometimes calamari is soaked in oil, not here) the breaking was perfect and it came with marinara sauced spiced just right. For the main, had chicken piccata that was so full of flavor I couldn't put my fork down. The Mediterranean pasta was an explosion of flavor with a perfect amount of seafood, I literally licked the plate cleAn. My son opted for the loaded Chicago Italian beef sandwich, tender slices of beef on a French roll with Au Jus.. I finished the last few bites and despite overeating, I still wanted more. 

The restaurant has a nice layout with a combination of high top tables and regular dining tables. The staff was attentive and super friendly, very anxious to please. I'd highly recommend this restaurant, I will definitely return."}
{"text":"We went here and both had meals that were amazing! It's too bad we didn't stop in sooner, as this gem is worth the stop. Strip malls are getting better food each day, and this place is definitely an example of that. I had the pork loin marsala and my husband had the Italian stuffed poblano. Both were amazing!"}
{"text":"I've been eating here since the beginning! It never disappoints. I've also used them for catering! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"We have been to this restaurant several times now, it is a great little Italian restaurant, fabulous food, the twisted ravioli is superb. Wednesday lunch has great wine deal. We'll be back"}
{"text":"Food was good, my Lord beer prices feel like I'm at the ballpark. Way too much. Happy hour???"}
{"text":"Twisted Italian was established in 2010 and Changed Ownership and Menu in late 2015. This is a small locally owned restaurant that serves traditional Italian favorites and some very NON TRADITIONAL Italian Food.

They started us off with complimentary bread and balsamic dotted extra virgin olive oil.

We started with a small order of Pierogi of the month (Corned Beef and Cabbage). The Pierogi were prepared \"crispy\" and were filled with a potato based mixture of flavorful corned beef and a little cabbage. We were pleasantly surprised on how how tasty the pierogi were! ($7.75)

For dinner I tried the European Sea Bass. I received a tasty slightly crusted meaty mild boneless white fish with crispy skin. My patter contained asparagus, grilled tomato and lemony angel hair pasta with capers. Everything was prepared reasonably well and was tasty. ($18.75)

My husband had the Italian RELLENO. It was a Poblano Pepper that was filled with house made sausage and cheese. The relleno was topped with a creamy tomato sauce and big cheese filled fried ravioli were served on the side. ($13.75)

Everything was tasty. Service was efficient. Prices were reasonable.

The food and menu have greatly improved from what this restaurant served years ago."}
{"text":"Very small place! Food was alright. Overpriced znd coke products out of the bottle.. kinda warm inside will not be returning"}
{"text":"Yes one star, I believe I even gave Culver's AKA \"whats wrong with America\" and Kings Fish house \"canned fish on my plate for $25+\" 2 stars, but this place was horrible. I'm not a douche, I don't review cruelly unless its earned and they earned this star.  First off service was fine, waitress was no issue so I'm ok with that but the problem started with the drinks.  Now I understand red wine is served room temperature because I am cultured and a closeted alcoholic.  But this wine must of been stored next to the oven cause it was hot as hades (thats hell for you morons) which although the wine was surprisingly good it would of been better below boiling point.  Now the food, first they bring you \"Italian bread\" which is soft untoasted Texas toast to dip in oil and balsamic vinegar. Why the hell do they use this bread is beyond me but i was starving, so I had a slice and yes it was mediocre at best #shocker.  Next came the meal I ordered the chicken marsala and my lovely date who opted for this place over Squidink #lame ordered the chicken picatta.  The Marsala was ok, nothing special but not bad served with pasta on the side - the pasta was the \"standout\" of everything we ate.  The picatta was so sour it was almost unedible  but being a gentleman and good looking man I traded with my lovely lady and ate as much as I could until I felt sick from the \"sour chicken\" which they should change the name of this dish to because it was ridiculous.  After 2 entrees, 1 glass of wine the total after tip was over $50.  Its times like this when Italian restaurants exist this bad I don't understand how Fazoli's went under in Arizona.  On a positive note they have great new big flat screen TV's, something every good Italian restaurant requires #notreally #hireachefoverbuyingTVs #facts"}
{"text":"We ordered a few different items from their brunch menu. Veggie omelette (grandma loved it), sausage stromboli (I didn't like it), breakfast lasagna (pictured- mom didn't like it very much) and also ricotta pancakes (my brother absolutely loved). Overall we had a great experience. The server was also funny and would come back because of her. Reason for the 3/5 stars is simply because the breakfast items could be better than they were. Normally I'm an omelette guy, but given this was a small Italian joint, we went for the Italian breakfast items. We will try again, but next time for lunch/dinner."}
{"text":"The service has always been spot on here. They treat their customers with a smile and your waiter is basically waiting on you hand and foot.

Their food is also quite well. I really enjoy their pizzas, of course, which guy doesn't like pizza!  My favorite part is the soft and chewy crust. 

Definitely try Twisted Italian! You will not be disappointed. 

Ps. They also have Groupons which come in handy in a pinch!"}
{"text":"I am very disappointed in this establishment. The owner refused to accept a guaranteed party of at least 15 people for a birthday celebration coming up in mid-November. Citing his \"slippery slope\" comment (aren't you tired of that one as I am), it will be a cold day in Peroria before I ever set foot in this restaurant again.  Very poor customer relations there, Mike. If I could rate you no stars, I would."}
{"text":"Awesome meal!  Bread and olive oil and balsamic vinegar to dip it in was a nice start.  House wine was very nice.  Twisted Ravioli was superb, as was the Citrus Salad.  Waitress Caitlyn was attentive, and oh so sweet.  
We will be back, and highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Really good wholesome food and much preferred to sub par chain restaurants, of which I rarely patronize.  Everything we ordered was super delicious and I will bring family and friends for more. Waitress was excellent also.

5 stars all the way!"}
{"text":"My wife and I have been going here since the new owners took over.  We have never had a bad, or even an unpleasant experience until yesterday for lunch.  My wife had the lasagna and I had spaghetti and meatballs.  
The lasagna was over cooked and way to much sauce with little meat or noodles, my meatballs were excellent but the spaghetti (very little) was drowned with sauce.  The service was excellent, but we were disappointed with the food.  I hope it was just.a one off experience."}
{"text":"I've never been to an establishment that treats their customers so badly. The owner literally shooshed my one and a half year old and then told us our children are too loud. I should mention that we were the only ones in the whole restaurant. He didn't even let us tell the kids to quiet down. He was rude and his actions were ugly towards some mommies and their toddlers just wanting to eat lunch. It was hateful and we will never go back."}
{"text":"In the last four months, we've come here about 4 times.  So it's time I said what a great job the new owners are doing in bringing back what at one time we considered to be our favorite.  Then things changed and we stopped going.  Wow, what a difference now.  Today for lunch I had the Italian sandwich with peppers and onions.  What a great piece of Italian sausage!

Friendly service and one of the owners is there...today, both were there and I had a great conversation with Michelle.   Tasted a new (to me) Italian wine that was excellent plus they give a nice pour.

Maybe once again one of our favorites.  Sounds like I need to try the lasagna next time."}
{"text":"Twisted Italian was such a pleasant surprise!! Awesome food but the prices were what wowed me! So incredibly reasonable, dare I say cheap, for such high quality, amazingly flavorful food! 

Michelle was our server and she was awesome! She made sure to accommodate all requests and she was ON the refills! (More Diet Coke please! :) ) She was busy too, but that didn't stop her from taking good care of us and always checking in at the exact right time. 

Tonight I tried the espresso martini, sangria, shrimp Fresca, Italian salad, eggplant Parmesan, and a cannoli. My mom had spaghetti and meatballs which was huge and she said was excellent! They really have a scratch made kitchen, don't let the strip mall facade fool you... no Sysco trucks here!! 

Overall I highly recommend for the food, the prices, and the service! A whole hearted 5 stars all around! I can't wait to come back to try the pizza, the pierogis, and the branzino! 

Also with mentioning that they have lots of specials! Tonight was 1/2 price bottles wine Wednesday and the place was packed! I highly recommend going early (bonus HH menu for the win!) or making a reservation. Definitely going to return next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"Ate there once, and probably would not go back.  Seating was very limited and we had to sit at one of those high-stool type chairs.  Menu was somewhat limited and the service was slow.  I felt it was overpriced and trying to be too trendy for the area.  Neither of us was very impressed.  Better alternatives right in the same plaza where it is located."}
{"text":"We frequent this little Italian joint all the time! Their sangria is amazing! Monday's and Tuesday's are great for spaghetti night and it's super reasonable. One of my favorites is their Chicken Parmesan (it's on special on Thursday). They have a good happy hour for drinks and apps. I also love their lunch menu during the week! I love to mix it up and get Penne Alfredo with broccoli instead of the Fettuccine Alfredo. The servers are great and really take care of you!"}
{"text":"This place was not what I expected. I thought it was some kind of fast food type of restuarant like say, Rubio's Mexican Food.  It was not.  It was a really nice, chic, hip restaurant.  Good Food.  Pizza was great.  Fried Calamari yummy and the Italian Ice Cream is to die for.   They have alcohol too!"}
{"text":"I ordered take out this evening. The the food was good, there was just not very much of it. 5 ravioli's is not really a dinner sized portion. Also the amount of pasta with my chicken Marsala was small. Unfortunately I'm still hungry after eating dinner.  The only thing dinner sized was the price. I'm very disappointed."}
{"text":"We go here regularly. Raised in an Italian household, it's hard to find a good Italian restaurant that compares to that good old home cooking. Regarding the food, it is always delicious! No matter what you order it'll be great. However the three stars is due to inconsistent service. There is one guy there that is wonderful. (He's normally bartending). Every time we get him I know we're going to have a great time. However every other server that we've had is rude and acts like it's an inconvenience to service. Even one time I called in to get a quote on a catering order. We were looking to serve about 120 people. It took the GM three days to call me back and then acted like it was a giant pain to take a catering order? I placed the order with Grimaldi's instead. Unfortunately, their service is more often bad then it is good. I suggest getting take out from them."}
{"text":"I have only ordered take out from here, but I love the decor when I stop in to pick up my order. Food is always delicious and stays warm until I make it home. Love the daily specials. Great meal at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"I love twisted Italian, I eat here all the time and I love all the different food options, they have any Italian food you can think of! The service is great and it is really relaxing 5/5!"}
{"text":"This place is surprisingly good! I'm from the mid-west and had been craving some authentic tasting Italian. This reminded me of food you get in the Italian neighborhood called The  Hill area of St Louis. Try the Italian Margherita and the Twisted Ravioli with chicken. The calamari appetizer is also very good. We will be back."}
{"text":"Third time here, still not disappointed! Great service and yummy food!  Calamari starter is awesome!  Today was meatball calzone, sooooo good!"}
{"text":"Lunch was amazing.
Courtney was a super friendly server she and did a great job.
We ordered two kinds of Pierogies, potato and cheese, and the spicy South of the Border potato with peppers and onions. They cooked these with sauteed onions and it came with sour cream and drawn butter. Yummy.
     The spaghetti and two big meatballs were delicious and the Italian sausage sandwich
was great. Lots of melted cheese, onions and green peppers were included.
   The pasta salad was tasty and so was the Caeser salad.
The strawberry gelato was creamy and full of strawberries."}
{"text":"Very yummy food.  The atmosphere was cozy.  The owner,  Mike, is so passionate about making authentic Italian food, from scratch too :-)!
My husband and I stopped in today and found the place 1/2 full. The tvs were displaying some sports, of course my husband loved that.
He had the spaghetti and meatballs and I had the citrus salad with grilled salmon added.  We loved our food.  We didn't need dessert but did go for the cheesecake.  Not a crumb was left on any of our plates.
Oh, and the fruity sangria was wonderful.
So,  as you can tell, we will be going back for more next time we are in the area!  Yum!"}
{"text":"Simple menu,  delicious food.  Went there for an early dinner and it was excellent.  Alex our waiter was awesome and the entire staff did a good job of attending to tables all around.  We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Wonderful neighborhood restaurant
Pasta delicious
Sauces delicious
Entrees delicious

We found this little gem on group on and have returned a number of times.  We've recommended this to friends with full confidence that they will have an equally delicious experience.  And they have."}
{"text":"We had a large group and the server was able to keep up with us all. She was very friendly and helpful. The food was really good and I can't wait to come back. Everyone in my party was satisfied and happy with their selections."}
{"text":"We were in the area and stopped at this place during lunch time. $7.99 for the lunch special was a great deal for what we got!!!! The Chicken Pesto and Spaghetti meatballs both were delicious. Will definitely come back if we are in the area again!  Service by Courtney was superb!!!"}
{"text":"I don't know what Lynne M. was talking about, but I will come back because of their music! (Pompous people don't belong on yelp). It's nice to see an Italian restaurant that's not so godfather-ish for a change. 

The penne fra diavolo was delicious! The flavors were there but it came a little under seasoned which is nothing a little salt can't fix. The pasta was a bit over cooked which I think most Americans like. 

For an $8 bowl of pasta, it was outstanding. If I'm in the area again, I would eat here again."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful lunch here at the bruschetta was absolutely to die for will be returning very soon. The waitress was quick the food was quick and we got a table very quickly as well"}
{"text":"Polish ? German? Russian ? Eastern European ? Just a lover of pierogis ? What ?  Pierogis in an Italian Restaurant ? And the best other than my own home made hand crafted premium pierogis ? You bet. This is the place. I make the traditional sauerkraut, cheese and potato. But, have you ever had potato with gouda cheese, green onion and bacon ? or Corned beef and cabbage pierogis ? You must try this place. The owner, a Polish gentleman from Chicago makes his father' s pierogi recipes. Now, the Italian. Outstanding. I've had the gnocci and the Penne Fra Diavolo. Both excellent. My wife has had the veal marsala and the pizza. Both great choices. And all entrees always after a full order of the pierogis !! Combined with a full bar, craft beers and a great wine selection, How can you go wrong. Did I mention the very resonable prices ?? Love this place."}
{"text":"My family and I came here after a long day of moving. My oldest wanted some Mac and cheese (which she didn't get anyways). Being new to the area, I looked on yelp for a place that would work. This place is on the smaller side but for the area works really well. If this review was just based off of the food alone, it would have been at least 4 stars but the service was only so so. 

For it being a smaller restaurant you would expect a little bit more attention from the servers. The waitress took our drink order and then didn't come back to take our food order for another 10 minutes. Only after she took our order did she offer some bread. You would think this is one of the first things that they would do.

Now, the food. My wife ordered the Italian beef sandwich. I ordered the Italian stack sandwich. My mom ordered the spaghetti with meat sauce and my kids had spaghetti with marinara and a cheese pizza. All of the food was really good and we will probably go back here because of that fact. Just wish the service was a little better."}
{"text":"Very slow service for family of 4.  Waitress seemed as if she didn't even want to be there for the day.  Took forever to get my refill if soda."}
{"text":"Ashley was superb, very knowledgeable concerning the menu, she had great suggestions for food and wine pairings.
Chicken Picata was very tasty, chicken was done to perfection and very moist, picata sauce was rich and flavorful.
Their pizza was very good and the crust was perfect."}
{"text":"Run, don't walk.  This place is outstanding!  We are here for three more nights, and plan to be there every night. I am 100% Italian, and super picky about Italian food.  We had the pan-fried mozzarella and marinara which was prepared perfectly, and served still hot, which is important for me.  Their sausage is delicious (try the sausage sandwich) and attention to detail and spicing is amazing!  The wine is reasonably priced, and the overall atmosphere is very \"famiglia.\"  We sat at the bar and visited with the owner, who you would have thought we'd known for years.  He was bantering back and forth with the waitstaff, and quickly tended to us throughout our entire time there.  Other patrons included romantic couples, families with children, and several people who were obviously enjoying themselves.  From the outside, it looks like just an average strip-mall eatery. but once you step inside, you immediately feel the warm  welcome of the old country! 

Bathrooms and the dining area were clean, and the acoustics were charming - not too loud, not too quiet.  Overall, this place is a find!"}
{"text":"Great food and family loves it. Only done take out at this time. Cardinale with chicken is my favorite."}
{"text":"First time trying and had the best experience. Wait was a little long but worth it. Our waiter (young man) was excellent in serine. Loved the caprese, perogli, and meatball subs. Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"This was a very pleasant surprise. Everyone in our party enjoyed their meal. We all shared the house special cheese bread which was delish! The Caprese salad was a bit of a disappointment because of the cherry/grape tomatoes and small lumps of fresh mozzarella. I much prefer meaty slices of heirloom tomatoes and cheese. The freshness of the ingredients was excellent and the dressing was lovely.

I had the Chicken Marsala which was very tasty despite what tasted like canned mushrooms. My dining companions had the spaghetti and Chicken Piccata which were equally tasty. Portions were generous and preparation was expert.

The restaurant is small and intimate. The decor is bright and modern. The service is quick and friendly. Our waitress made very good suggestions.

We all agreed that we would like to eat here again."}
{"text":"The ambiance is nice the chicken piccata way too lemony and the sauce not so good .... the service was great ... might give it a second chance!"}
{"text":"Excellent customer service and amazing food! Loved the chicken florentine soup! Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"First time we went had a pleasant experience for lunch...purchased a groupon on February 2nd and arrived with six adults...we called ahead, figuring they would be busy, but they wouldn't set a table aside...after waiting an hour and a half we came to the conclusion that they weren't going to seat us so we left....we came back tonight to give them a second chance to make things right....we called ahead nice again explaining what happened two weeks prior but again they would not accommodate us....we arrived and was greeted by a pleasant host at the door and was seated immediately, we told him what happened two weeks ago and he was very apologetic......a pleasant server took our drink orders....then the owner came out from back of the house and aggressively approached our table and was upset that we told his host that they didn't seat us the two weeks prior...that it wasn't his fault...and there was nothing he could do even though I mentioned to him we observed four 4 tops being seated even though they arrived after us...We once again left without being served......the owner is clearly inexperienced and unprofessional....he would have been better off keeping his mouth shut and allowing his pleasant server take care of business and we probably would have enjoyed our evening..,,but he wanted to make his point to us that our last visit was not his fault...and that we made him feel bad....well, I ask, who's fault was it??!! Mine??"}
{"text":"Six of us ate here on March 13, 2018. If it were all about the food, I would have given a strong 4 or 5 stars because the food was delicious. However, the customer service was poor and very unsatisfactory. 

The waitress never cracked a smile and seemed unhappy to be there. Every time she brought us something we'd thank her and she would simply ignore the gesture; no \"you're welcome\" or even a \"no problem\".

The same waitress literally got into an argument with my mother over whether or not the menu stated there was pesto in the meal she chose. Instead of embracing a \"customer is always right\" service mentality, the waitress wanted to dig her heels in and prove she was right (\"Want me to show you the menu again?\").

I looked around and the other waitresses and staff looked as though they desperately wanted to be somewhere else as well. Where are the smiles? If you can't be happy, at least ACT happy for the customers.

Earlier in the evening, when we called to make reservations we had the following curt conversation:

Us: Yes, we'd like to make a dinner reservation for six.
Employee: High table or low?
Us: Excuse me?
Employee: High table or low?
Us: I don't understand what you mean.
Employee: Do you want a high table or low table?
Us: Um, we just want a table.

And so it went. Upon arrival, and throughout our visit, we were treated similarly. Customer service is a dying art - and this is on full display at the Twisted Italian."}
{"text":"Friends recommended Twisted Italian so we decided to give it a try.  We were immediately greeted by Marty who was extremely pleasant and he provided us with excellent customer service.  We ordered the Cardinale (white wine alfredo, sautéed onion and garlic, crushed red pepper tossed with penne pasta and a Pizza ( sausage, pepper and onions).  The food was delicious!  Overall it was a GREAT experience!"}
{"text":"Super busy on a Friday night but the service was amazing and we cuddled up to the bar and enjoyed ourselves!"}
{"text":"This was a random last minute decision to stop in here and we are glad we did! I have been driving past this restaurant for a while and for our anniversary since I work late and this is close to home, we stopped in for dinner. 

We were immediately greeted and seated right away. I loved the atmosphere and how quaint the place was. We both ordered some wine which was perfectly fine for my taste, I am not very picky when it comes to wine  We were also given some fresh bread and olive oil which I will always gladly nibble on until our food arrives. We were there on a spaghetti special night so my husband ordered the spaghetti with meatballs and I ordered the fettuccine alfredo with broccoli. We thought both were pretty great!

It wasn't anything that totally blew us away but it was excellent comfort food and I would absolutely come back to try more dishes on the menu. They seem to have some weekly specials that seem like an excellent deal so that is definitely worth a look."}
{"text":"Worth the wait! We had the Applewood smoked bacon bruschetta which was excellent. We had the spaghetti and meatballs for our main dish which was delicious!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has the nicest and most attentive staff and the food is very good!! Today I had the calamari fra diavolo and my husband had the meatball sandwich. Both were excellent! The calamari is strips of a steak and not the rings, very tender and meaty. The meatballs are excellent and have an amazing flavor. We also had the Cesar's and they came fresh and the dressing is perfect. A++ highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"Good food, blah atmosphere. I loved the pasta, the sangria was tasty, and the service overall was decent. I'd go here again. They also almost always have coupons in the weekly mailers."}
{"text":"Had Spicy perogies which were good considering this is an Italian restaurant.  They wouldnt substitute a bun for sandwich sliced bread for the Italian Stack sandwich.  Then they gave me my wrong order.  When my order came I noticed they use MUSTARD on their Stromboli...also very strange.  The Italian beef they claim to be the best is no where close to the best. Im from Chicago and only Portillo's so far has the best beef in AZ.  The server was very uninformed about the menu.  Just not a pleasant experience and WILL NOT be returning."}
{"text":"Never again. A group of us went here for a friend's birthday & the service was horrible. The food was fine, but I wouldn't come back just because of the service. Our waitress got our waters in a semi-timely manner, but it all went downhill from there. She was very rude when we were ordering & when we asked anything. We even had to ask for our waters to be refilled. We tried to get her attention numerous times, but she just wasn't attentive enough to notice. Then, the birthday girl's husband went to discreetly ask for a small dessert to celebrate, the waiter that he asks comes over to the table & very NOT discreetly asks \"So did you want a full cake or just a dessert?\" fully w/in earshot of the birthday girl. Of course she knows she's going to get a dessert, but it could've been sort of a surprise, at least!  It's like the guy had never had a birthday table before. The last thing is one of our friends accidentally knocked over a glass of water onto the table and NO ONE, not one single employee in that restaurant, helped. No one came to give us more napkins or anything. We had to all chip in our own napkins as well as take some from other tables to soak up the water before it spilled all over the floor. Those napkins sat soaked on the table the rest of the night. The waitress dropped off the checks & didn't say anything about the napkins. We were all appalled at the service & won't ever be coming back."}
{"text":"Not sure what the one star person is talking about....we have been there 3 times recently and have been talked to immediately, seated immediately and asked if we wanted drinks or appetizers immediately. Our servers have been kind and helpful. The place is clean and well taken care of. We go to Twisted Italian because they have gluten free options. That is a HUGE help due to some our family having food allergy problems. Our portions have been generous and tasty. My only minor and I mean minor complaint is....the meat sauce could be less sweet and have a better quality meat put in it. I think it is sausage in there and I have gotten one or two pieces of gristle in mine. I like my sauce more on the savory side than sweet but that is a personal preference. We will be back and enjoy it just like the other times we have been there. Thank you Twisted Italian for considering gluten free folks!"}
{"text":"We had the penne with meat sauce. Taste like something out of a can. Plus who ever heard of am Italian restaurant that doesn't have rigatoni. If u want mediocre food, this is the place for you. Sorry just not that good."}
{"text":"The food is amazing if they serve you the right plate, the service...... horrible. Came here for lunch on Saturday 3/10 walked in we were seated and then we waited...... and waited. Ordered drinks and waited some more. After about 35 min we finally ordered our food. The food came and looked amazing, tasted amazing. About 20-25 min after we got our food the waited came out and took my daughters plate away apparently they gave her the wrong pasta dish. So instead of just giving her the correct one or not charging us for her meal they took the dish away practically mid bite and gave her the right one . The food is amazing customer service not so much."}
{"text":"Good service. Calamari unremarkable. Good house wines. 

My group enjoyed citrus chicken salad. I liked eggplant chicken dish."}
{"text":"I love the fettuccine Alfredo here. It's creamy with the perfect amount of garlic flavor. I also love that it comes with broccoli and not chicken like most places. The portion sizes are huge. We've been here twice in the last week and both times we had great service."}
{"text":"Italian done right! The food is DELICIOUS!  The menu selections are not overwhelming.  The portions are pretty decent as well.  I always have leftovers to take home.  For me, italian food always seems to take even better as leftovers.  The staff is super friendly.  One of the owners even came over to greet me while waiting for my food.  They take extreme pride in their dishes and for good reason."}
{"text":"This is our go to for a salad in the neighborhood but everything on the menu is excellent, so far not 1 complaint from family or friends when we go here. Always good food."}
{"text":"Great Pizza and Chicken Parm!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a late lunch. I had the eggplant parmesan sandwich with garlic fries and salad with Italian dressing. Sandwich was way too big for me to finish. Not problem, lunch the next day! 
Hubby had the loaded Chicago Italian beef junior with garlic fries as well. The sandwich was huge. I can't imagine what the regular size would have been like! 
A small quaint, quiet restaurant. Two large screen TV's on opposite walls, but by no means a sports bar. Our waiter Shayne was terrific. Fast service and very personable. Food was absolutely delicious and brought to our table in a timely manner. Would definitely go back and recommend to family & friends."}
{"text":"The new owners have done a great job of livening the place up and making it obvious they care! I thought the prices were very reasonable and all of the staff very pleasant. The Italian Beef is so delicious that I had a hard time not getting one to go after splitting one at the restaurant. The Pierogies were so delicious I could have eaten 100. Looking forward to tasting the new brunch menu on the weekend. Exactly what the area needs. We will be back!"}
{"text":"This was my 3rd visit in a year and the food and service have been consistently good. Pizza, pasta, chicken marsala, salads, meatballs, desserts have all been winners. The mozzarella garlic bread was disappointing this visit. It was toast slices with a large amount of dried oregano on top...weird. Otherwise a solid choice in this area. Saw they have started Sunday brunch with full bar."}
{"text":"Incredible place! Stoped in for lunch and had the Italian Beef sandwich..... yum! Salad w Italian beforehand was also great.  Highly recommend!!!!"}
{"text":"First time there.  We read reviews and wanted to try the bread and oil but hubs ordered cheese bread so we assume the waiter thought that meant no regular bread. We never spoke up because then the food came!

Hubs got The italian beef sandwich and loved it.

Kids got meatball calzone and spaghetti special-okay but nothing spectacular.  I think we need to go back without kids and order something more unconventional.

I got caprese and it was yummy.

Hoping this can become our new Postino of the 85383. Going to go back and do bruschetta, and definitely brunch one of these Sundays.  

4 stars for mom and pop, extensive menu, patience for kids, potential, and wine and drinks menu:)"}
{"text":"I went here for the first time with the $20 for $10 groupon deal.  The restarant is located next to Chipotle, Paradise Bakery, Cold Stone etc, and it's a modern Italian eatery.  Ordered calamari and it came as long satisfying pieces of squid and perfectly breaded.  I am a huge pesto fan, so for dinner I ordered the Mediterranean pasta with added chicken.  It was very good in both taste and portion size, mixed with sundried tomatoes, olives and feta cheese.  Bread basket was also good, although smaller in size than I am used to at other restaurants.  Host and waitresses were very friendly and service was fast.  It is not a fancy white cloth restaurant, but it is a eatery with good selection.  It can be pricy without a groupon, but they do have daily specials and weekend buy 1 get second pasta 1/2 off deals.  I would go back again!"}
{"text":"Great local place for us to eat plus I like the app they have set up so it makes ordering for take out a breeze. Had a couple issues with forgotten food when we have done Uber delivery but they have always removed the charge without a fight like some places"}
{"text":"I ordered the Mediterranean pasta and added shrimp. I'm very glad I did because the dish tasted excellent. 

I chose this because of a recommendation from a couple sitting next to me that I happened to see eating that same dish. I'm glad I took their advice. 

The pesto-Alfredo sauce was the highlight of the pasta creation. That, combined with the spaghetti noodles and feta cheese made a great flavor explosion! The kalamata olives added an extra salty taste that I didn't enjoy too much. I just don't like those type of olives.

I also sampled the cheesey bread with marinara sauce. The sauce tasted like it had been made from scratch. Highly recommended to order anything that includes that sauce. 

I will be visiting again to try more dishes!"}
{"text":"EVERYTHING was fantastic from the decor to the excellent service Robert gave us to the delicious food to include fried mozzarella, calamari steak, lasagna, shrimp scampi, and chicken parmigiana. The huge glass of red sangria topped it all off! Just happened up on this fantastic place and can't wait to get back!"}
{"text":"Came here yesterday in a pinch running behind for a movie.  The service was very accommodating.  Nothing like the other reviews described and in fact I would say it was a very classic service that made you feel at home.  I wish we were not in a rush, but we ordered and I got the alfredo which was pretty darn good.  The server said that it is all homemade and I had that feeling when we were eating.  My wife had the Mediterranean salad that looks really good...she said it was OK but not her favorite.  My son had spaghetti and I couldn't help myself so I gave that a try and it was not bad.  Its hard for me to like any other marinara besides my families.  The bread would have been great if it was hot so that was a little let down since it was so soft already.  We will go back for dinner since the lunch menu was very small and I would love to try their chicken marsala."}
{"text":"My husband and I are addicted to this place! The Chicken Caesar Sandwhich is to die for, even though it's not on the menu anymore.  But they'll still make it if you ask them.  It's awesome! Like a Joey Tribbioni level of Sandwhich perfection. If you need wi-Fi, sit on the side of the restaurant close to Dunkin Donuts so you can use theirs.  Lol.  My only beef is, does the TVs always have to be on sports? They're 4 TVs.... they don't all have to be on sports."}
{"text":"The food was average. The service was lacking. The waiter was dressed in a T-Shirt....  we paid $50 (not incl tip) for 2 entrees, 2 side salads, and an appetizer. No alcohol drinks. Another group came in that was obviously friends with the staff and they were loud and annoying. What compelled me to write this review, tho, is that I asked for mozzarella cheese on my entree in lieu of Parmesan and THEY CHARGED $2 FOR IT. Really?

Nothing disgusts me more than CHEAP. We will not go back and pay fairly high prices at a strip mall restaurant w/ a common atmosphere, not great service, and is so desperate to make a buck it has to charge a niggling and squeezy $2 for a cheese swap.... And not even a good quality mozzarella. Never Again.

After reading a few other reviews, if you think Olive Garden is good Italian, you prolly will think this place is good. But if you love Fabulous! Italian.....caveat emptor."}
{"text":"The ambiance is very nice.  Restaurant is clean and nicely decorated and appeared to be a bit more upscale than other restaurants in the area (there really isn't much to choose from out here).  Water was served in plastic \"glasses\" which seemed a little strange to me for such an upscale place.  We both ordered the Twisted Merlot wine and when it came to us, it was COLD!  I have never been served Merlot that was obviously being kept in the cooler.  It is a really big No-No to serve Merlot in any other way than room temperature.  Why don't they know this?  The bread was very dry and cool.  It may have tasted better if it had been warmed.  I had a house salad that was served with a very sweet dressing that I guess just comes with it as I wasn't given a choice of dressings by the waitress.   My husband had the caesar salad that was \"okay\".  I ordered the Sorrentino which was very tasty and a lot more food than I could eat and my husband had the Chicken Marsala which he said was \"okay\".  We wanted to give this place a try as it is very close to where we live, but if we want really good Italian food, we will travel much farther to get it."}
{"text":"Been wanting to try this place out for a while and finally made it over there a few weeks back. We split the South of the Border Pierogis, Caesar salad and Twisted Ravioli. All were quite delicious and I was pleasantly surprised by how tasty the pierogis were. The sangria was also pretty spot on as well. I will definitely return!"}
{"text":"I took my daughter her for lunch one day.  Food was not fresh nor home made.  Flavor was bland and uninteresting.  Presentation was lacking any kind of imagination (fettuccine alfredo on a white ceramics - I thought I was looking at a snow storm in a bowl).  Bread was like what comes out of pillsbury tubes that you get a super market - no substance or texture.  Just white fluff.  Disappointed."}
{"text":"Great Italian food!! The lasagna is very authentic tasting!! We have found our new favorite neighborhood restaurant. Loved the atmosphere and staff."}
{"text":"For a small business to survive around corporate places says a lot.  On the flip side, it's crappy corporation restaurants so, they have the upper hand.  

The service was decent and the food was pretty good.  Each of our party had something different and the only complaint was that the Brochette was average.   It wasn't bad but, it wasn't great.  It wasn't traditional and the added sweetness didn't work for me.  Personal preference."}
{"text":"Experienced Twisted Italian for the first time last night with my girlfriends. Joey our server was top notch and had a fabulous personality. She navigated us through the menu and made excellent recommendations.  Enjoyed the experience and will definitely be back in the near future."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time with my cousin to have dinner.  The moment we walked in we were greeted by an older gentleman who sat us right away.  The server came by, it was a woman with long brown hair. She took our drink order and gave us a few minutes to look over the menu.  

The atmosphere was great, except for the constant flickering of the track lighting (it was quite distracting).  The server had a couple of other tables and for the most part did an okay job.  She came by and we placed our order. 

We got our calamari first, and honestly it was bad.  I felt like I had ordered fish sticks that we're taken out of the microwave.  I was so hungry that I ate a stick but my stomach could not bear another piece.  We asked for a bread basket.  When it arrived the so called vinegar and oil dip, was mainly oil and a penny size drop of vinegar.  The food came out pretty quick, but I wish it hadn't.  I got the penne Alfredo with chicken and broccoli.  I could only take one bite. It was rubbery and tasted like sewer water.  

I was so upset but I did not want to complain.  I love family owned businesses because I know how hard it is to survive in such a tough industry. Although my server did not even ask why I did not touch my food.  She came by gave us the bill and asked if I needed a box.  She seemed so robotic and cold.  I told her yes and we paid for our food.  I was so disappointed that I even left my food there. 

Thank God for the bread basket."}
{"text":"I'm only giving this place two stars because I used to love it. I moved in the area about a year ago. That was the first Time I tried this place. It was awesome! It was my new Italian joint. So we would go there at least once a month.  When I stated school everything got busy do I couldn't go as often. I missed their mozzarella sticks so we went back. I don't know if they got new management or their standards have dropped but everything we got was way too overcooked.  The mozzarella sticks were so burned the cheese was leaking out of them. Also the dish I got had red sauce which tasted like it was straight from the can. I'm sad I used to love this place but I haven't been back there since this happened 2 months ago."}
{"text":"We just did take out and I got the combo beef and sausage sandwich and it was easily the best sandwich I have had in Arizona. It was delicious. Got the pierogies too and they were very good. This was our second time eating here and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Yum Yum Yum. Bread and oil was delish. I had the twisted ravioli - fabulous! Other diners with us had spaghetti with sausage, penne, and meatball sandwich. We are all very pleased with our dishes and would go back. I thought it was much better than the typical run of the mill Olive Garden. We did have a groupon but they also have deals which make it a little more reasonable."}
{"text":"Decided to give this place a second chance after a poor experience the first time of slow service. This time my experience was even worse. I'm not one to give reviews, however my wife and I wanted to go somewhere local for a quick dinner without the kids and were greatly disappointed. When we arrived we were seated promptly by a friendly hostess. Positive and the only reason there is a star. Then we got drinks, ordered an appetizer and our entrees and told by server that she would be back with bread..... 45 mins later our drinks were empty, no bread, no appetizer, no food, no sign of server. Once she came back to table she apologized and asked what it was that we had ordered......what?!!!? We were told that there was an issue in the kitchen and she didn't see our order...AKA she never rang it in and we were completely forgot about. As we told her we had to leave to pick our kids back up and wouldn't have time to reorder and wait another 45mins to eat, she offered us a gift certificate. Valued at $25.... which is a little bit of a joke since there is no way 2 people could eat there for even close to $25.  2nd try and We will not be back. Fool me once, fool me twice....never again."}
{"text":"Wow! We have driven by this place plenty of times but never stopped in. The food was, to say the least, very impressive for a strip mall restaurant.
My wife tried the chicken piccata, it was very fresh, flavorful and tender.
I had the Penne pepperonata. It was very good, lots of flavor and a good sized portion (I had to take about 1/3 of it home and I'm not exactly a small man).
The waiter was very pleasant and attentive, we will most definitely return and also recommend it to friends."}
{"text":"Been coming here for years and I am pleased with the owners and the food here they always accommodate our low carb lifestyle!"}
{"text":"We have been going to Twisted for sometime and always love their food. We ate there last night and had the sausage/pepperoni calzone and it was delicious.  We also tried the sausage sliders and were amazed at how delicious they are!  Raised in NY and being Italian, I love good Italian food and Twisted did not disappoint."}
{"text":"A little Italian gem in the midst of many chain restaurants.  For some reason there were almost no people eating when we were there around 1 pm on a Thursday but the food was great. I had the pear Gorgonzola salad with grilled chicken which was perfectly fresh and tasty. My hubby had the pene cardinal with Italian sausage...also delish.  We finished it off with a very fresh cannoli . They had to have made is fresh right then and there. We will definitely go back. We were sorry that more people seemed to be going to bland chain restaurants instead of choosing this one."}
{"text":"The food was surprisingly fresh tasting and the service was impeccable.  The prices were a little high for what you get but all in all a great experience we will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Very nice modern little place. Clean and tidy. Ceasar Salad was great, service was a bot odd with the cook seating is. But from the looks of it they don't get much lunch business. Will be back"}
{"text":"Super great food. Seated our large group of 10 very quickly. Spaghetti With meat sauce was the best I've ever had and I love spaghetti.  All the staff are friendly and prompt in their service.  Good job. 2nd visit with more to come."}
{"text":"The best service with the best gluten free crust in 25 miles!!! Thanks Alex for the smile and great service even through the dinner rush on a Friday.  Also the gluten free pasta is excellent. The fettuccini, raviolis, and sauces are great."}
{"text":"I brought my family back to Twisted Italian after a not so great first experience.(read my first review from 11/2011.)
We went back during the Christmas season in December. it was busy and was a marked difference from the first time. The wait staff was attentive, knowledgable, and pleasant. The owner came by and was also friendly. The food was very good and my three girls (twins 7 and older 10) loved the alfredo sauce. I think it's notable for an owner to take the critiscism and be thankful for what's written on Yelp (The good & Bad) because Yelp allows people to be more honest.  Every customer will tell you to your face that they loved their experience -- but, will dish the dirt on Yelp.  Bravo to the ownership of Twisted Italian. We'll come back again."}
{"text":"This is the first time we tried this place having recently moved into the area.  We thought it was fantastic.  My wife had the lasagna which was outstanding.  The order was large enough for two or more people.  I had the Chicken Parmesan and again, it was a large portion and just excellent.  Salads were great as was the service.  It was Wednesday night and the added treat was all bottles of wine were 1/2 price!  We got there about 7:00 pm and were immediately seated at the one last tables. The place ended up being packed with many people waiting so I guess it is known in the area to be good.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Was turned away for a party of 5 because we just wanted drinks and appetizers. Second attempt of going the first was unfriendly toward my one year child. Owner is very impersonable."}
{"text":"Really good for a quaint little Italian restaurant. There are not a lot of quaint restaurants outside of your \"run o' the mill\" chain restaurants that I'm desperately sick of. Had lunch there, want to be back for their happy hour. I got the Mediterranean salad and it was better than Oreganos.  Perfect little place to get some good lunch for a decent price on a Saturday."}
{"text":"I was lookin forward to a spaghetti plate done well for a while now.

I don't need fastidious rituals or opulent trappings. Just the reward of terrific food, distinguished by first-rate ingredients. That is exactly what I got, classic garlic pasta with meat sauce 8.95. A Moretti Italian Lager 4.5 Cheesecake 6.

I have to admit a phony accent might have been cool but no matter, my pleasure was intact."}
{"text":"Restaurant was clean which is the most important. I could see into the kitchen from my seat and it was clean as well. Service was average. In my opinion the food was below average. Price was fair."}
{"text":"Went here one time as I am new to the area. It was just ok - so MANY other real Italian places that blow this out of the water.  Best description of their food is \"forgettable\" and overpriced.  The restaurant is really small too!  I Would rather drive out of the area to get much better food."}
{"text":"Great food! Stopped in for lunch, had several things and shared. The owner was super nice and visited with us for a while. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Great food! Great staff! My boyfriend and I unknowingly came in like 30 min from close, we realized this and got up to go and the server and bartender assured us that it was fine, and to stay. So glad we did! The perogies were excellent, pasta, excellent, and the wine pairing suggestion was perfect.  We did eat quickly so as not to keep them too long, but we were both very happy with our meal and service, especially so close to closing, very professional."}
{"text":"My daughter chose italian for dinner tonight and for that she gets the mvp.  The food and service were top notch.  Spinach artichoke dip was amazing and we couldn't stop eating it.  All four of our entrees were excellent.  Our server was efficient and had great personality.

We can't wait to go back but we have to wait until we aren't so stuffed!"}
{"text":"I've been to this place several times the happy hour can't be beat great specials great service the owner cares about the food that he serves I highly recommend it"}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised.  Wife and I along with our 6 year old daughter visited there one early afternoon during  the week. Place was void of anyone except the host. I expected bad food because of the time and thinking Chef wasn't ready but it was great.  Pretty good atmosphere as I prefer more private booths but it was nice.  3 visits here and food is above average and service pretty decent. I hope you support these smaller places as it's tough nowadays."}
{"text":"My husband and I dined at the Twisted Italian this evening with a Groupn and we were pleasantly surprised. The server (Katie) was very friendly and attentive. Food was hot and arrived promptly. I had the eggplant Parmesan and my husband had the cheese ravioli with meat sauce. Both were excellent.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The service was poor...waiter forgot we were even there for a good period of time. The menu was very limited and typical of a run-of-the-mill Italian restaurant. It took about 30 minutes to even get the food! Once arrived, the food was bland and could have been made better at home (ie. pizza had too much sauce and the toppings fell right off the crust, the pasta was under sauced, the Caesar salad was standard...hard to mess it up) 
Raspberry tea was actually just Brisk sugar water that they didn't explain. Bread was additional cost and it wasn't worth the extra $.

Overall, poor experience and will not go back. It was an intriguing name, until we realized the focus is in the wine (a product they don't make) instead of the service and food. We like to support local, but too many cons to consider again.

Save some time and go to Babbo!"}
{"text":"A group of four adults and a toddler went for lunch. We were one of 2 or 3 tables dining in the place and the wait time to get our food was really long. I ordered the prosciutto and spinach grilled cheese, which came with no prosciutto. Despite that, the first few bites tasted pretty good, but then all I could taste was garlic. One person in our group ordered the entree sized Chicken Parmesan and it was a surprisingly small portion. My drink was never refilled and we had to ask another waitress if we could get our check and a few boxes. Our waitress came with boxes, but still no check. She didn't even mention the check. The restaurant still wasn't busy. My husband had to walk up to the bar area to pay so we could leave. We were not impressed and probably won't be return customers."}
{"text":"This place needs a lot of work. How about training your wait staff? We came in, and had to ask for bread (all other tables had it), then had to ask for balsamic (all other tables had it), then waited while the waiter randomly refilled drinks but forgot tables like ours.  Our appetiser, the Caprese salad, was bland, with under-ripe tomatoes. The main dishes we had (mine was pesto primavera) were just so-so. My friend's small pizza was nothing special and Barro's Pizza does a better job. The only bright side of this was the dish another friend ordered, the chicken fettuchini - the chicken was really great, although someone needs to teach the cook how to prepare noodles. I hope this place has some better luck, but so far it's just a waste of your time while they figure out how to train their waiters and their cooks."}
{"text":"I have to go up this way for work sometimes and I drive by A LOT. I finally stopped in during lunch. It was awkward being the only one in there. I am italain american and I have had some AMAZING italian food in my day! I would say this was good but, not  I HAVE TO GO BACK!!! A little pricey too especially for lunch... But, I did enjoy myself."}
{"text":"We had the thin crust Hawaiian pizza and parmesan fries food was great. Good ingredients. The vibe of the restaurant was odd and original. Cross between a wine bar and a family restaurant. Customer service was great."}
{"text":"OK everyplace screws up an order once in a while but only a great restaurant before that provides superb customer service when they do mess up. I would highly recommend them for great food is superb service"}
{"text":"I love this neighborhood restaurant!  Great food and atmosphere. The chicken parm is delicious - a must try!"}
{"text":"This place is so amazing! I have been here 10 or more times and gotten different items on the menu and have never had anything bad. The waiters are kind and helpful and the place just feels cozy. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"We were there for the first time on Saturday and were pleasantly surprised. The garlic fries are to die for. Would definitely recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Food was good bit the waitress was not friendly at all but she loved the regulars didn't want to be bother asked her for something and it was almost like how dare we bother her I wanted a dessert  it I guess she didn't want me to she just left the check and took off but once that money was down she couldn't wait. Then she didn't even ask if I wanted grated cheese on my pasta she just did it. Good thing there was another waiter or I wouldn't have had another refill on my drink. When we were already outside the restaurant the male owner or manager yells out have a nice evening how about ask us how our meal was instead 5mins ago. Like I said it's a good thing I like their pasta"}
{"text":"So far, I've only been here for lunch, but it's the best lunch spot I've found in this area.  

The wife (M) and I had the chicken pesto sandwich and a wrap the last time we were in, both of which were really good, and this time we were looking for salads. We both wound up with the chicken caesar and the cream of chicken florentine soup.  I told M that the next time I'm sick, she has to come back here and buy a bucket of the soup.  It may be the best soup I've ever had.  

The staff has been very friendly and helpful. The atmosphere is very comfortable and inviting.  The food is excellent. It's not a place designed to get you in and out as fast as possible, so if you're in a hurry to get back from lunch, just let them known and they'll make sure that you get done and out in a reasonable time."}
{"text":"What a pleasant environment with great employees. The food is great and is reasonably priced.  We recently ordered catering for our daughters graduation and they again did not disappoint. Although I don't want to share this little secret, its important for others to expierence this great place."}
{"text":"My husband and I went for the first time on a Saturday night.  We were hoping to experience a new, local Italian restaurant that would be closer than the one we usually go to.  First off, our server was very friendly and helpful.  She was attentive to our needs throughout the meal.  No problems there.  She brought us our requested water with lemon.   I have never tasted such bad water in a restaurant.  Like right from the tap.  We ordered a Garden Fresh Salad, which the menu said was made with Romaine lettuce, etc.  Ours came with what appeared to be iceberg lettuce.  BORING!!!   The bread that was served was really skimpy, only 3 very small pieces.  Nothing special.  I had the Mediterranean Pasta.  Flavor was \"ok\".  A bit overpriced at $10.50.  My husband had the Penne Pepperonata.  He felt it was also just \"ok\" and overpriced as well @ $11.75.  We did, however, get a buy one entree' get one for 1/2 price.  So at least that was some consolation.  Simply stated...we will likely not be returning for a second time."}
{"text":"Thought we would try it again with the new ownership.

The worst. Overpriced, nothing but old people in there, and my stomach has yet to recover.

Never going back."}
{"text":"This was the best chicken piccata I've ever had. Nice little place and great service!"}
{"text":"Average is about best, nothing special.  Food was average, prices seemed high for what we got. Service was a little slow. Loud and small restaurant. Has a kids menu but drinks for kids come in adult size cups. The staff was very friendly and attentive. We will probably try again."}
{"text":"I do not remember last time I got such bad service! We went for lunch with the entire family! It was past 2:00 pm and they said they have happy hour! The menu said all specialty cocktails are $2 off. I choose one from the menu and I was told that, that particular one was not on happy hour, although was on the same menu as the rest! So I asked again how come they are all $2 off except the one I wanted! I was told in a rude voice that yes, that was the case. Megan who was our waitress started to argue with me and at the end said, fine, if you want $2 off I'll give you $2 off. Needless to say I did not order anything, I just stuck with the water.  She had an attitude the rest of the lunch! I have no idea how this restaurant is still in business! We will not be going again!"}
{"text":"We stumbled upon this place and loved it. The lasagna is excellent. The place and staff have real character. Already been back 3 times.  The lunch specials are very reasonable."}
{"text":"My wife and I decided to give the place a try since we moved up this way back in March. We were seated right away. The server was friendly and prompt. The food was good and generous portions. The food was a little overpriced but it seems that a lot of places have raised their prices as well. We're going to try to include this place into our regular dining out rotation for sure."}
{"text":"won't be going back... food was mediocre at best.  it is NOT kid-friendly."}
{"text":"first time there and they were great!  Took my order just before closing and that was very nice of them alot of places just say\" we are closing\"

I will return again and dine in next time.... thank you Twisted  Italian!"}
{"text":"I was in tonight with my husband tonight shane was our waiter he suggested we get the Italian beef sandwiches we absolutely loved them! Food was amazing andshane was very attentive. Will definitely be back and recommend to friends and family."}
{"text":"I normally don't leave reviews, however I was very disappointed with everything. The food was mediocre, service was horrible! I ordered a sangria, could of kept drinking, however our waitress never bothered to come back and check in on us. We only saw her when we places our order, and brought our food. In such a lovely afternoon, it was a waste of our day!
Will not be doing this again."}
{"text":"Overall the service was excellent.  Really nice and friendly with great service.  They called me by name multiple times, etc.  we had the egplant parmasean and the penne alfredo.  The eggplant parm didnt have much for flavor and left a bad taste. It was actually pretty bad tasting and my wife threw it away.  Alfredo at most places is hit or miss, and it was better then most mom and pop places.  Most are super watery and not worth it.  Their's was a really good consistency, but didnt have a ton of flavor, and had a hint of country grave flavor (pepper i assume).  The location is great for our area, and the establishment is really nice with tv's etc.  just wasnt super impressed with the food.  We also tried the mozzarella garlic bread. The dipping sauce was good but the bread was not."}
