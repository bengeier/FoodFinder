{"text":"Great food, nice people! Teriyaki sauce is fantastic, try to ask green onion on chicken and shrimp mix with sweet chili Thai sauce, yummmm!!!"}
{"text":"I forgot how much I loved this place. Food was good and fresh as usual... ordered my usual Chicken Teriyaki and no complaints... was yummy!"}
{"text":"Originally me and a friend were going next door to eat at Genghis Grill really quick before hitting up a movie, but the buffet line was incredibly long due to a couple of little league teams and we were pressed for time.  We both were in the mood for something asian-y so we decided to try this place out (right next door)  We had both the chicken and beef teriyaki....no taste at all.  Required a lot of soy sauce and chili sauce to get anything out of it.  If I hadn't watched the dude make it, I would've thought he forgot to put any sauce in it.  The meat seemed pretty low quality as well.  The only thing they had going was that the veggies were really fresh, but that's about it.    I agree with Kevin C...it felt and tasted like we were in the food court at Fiesta.  We were the only people there, while Genghis next door was packed...not sure how this place will stay in business with something so similar and way more popular next door."}
{"text":"Cleaned dirty areas and continuously carried the dustpan over the grill. Chicken teriyaki looked and tasted like dog, felt like i was going to die. 0/10 do not eat"}
{"text":"Decent food for a decent price. It's not the greatest food, but it's decent. Palatable, fresh, and filling. Even though it's filling, it's not very heavy--- that is to say, not oily or fatty.  I had the vegetarian bowl with tofu, and would definitely consider coming back if I needed something fast, cheap, and filling."}
{"text":"I regret eating here.  The food was nothing special.  The cleaning solution they used to scrub the floor before closing had a strong smell that gave me a headache   They were cleaning the floor right beside our table.  Not very appealing. We arrived at 7:30  We were the only diners in the place.  Two people came in for takeout. This is fast food that was not exciting. And not very popular. We are traveling through the area and not local."}
{"text":"I had a great \"Teriyaki Experience\" at the Toronto Zoo and thought I'd try this one as well. Instead of cooking the vegetable and meat \"teriyaki-style\", they just heat it quickly, add some water and then pour generous amounts of sauce on it afterwards, and reluctantly followed my request to cook the chicken a little more. All the sauce stays at the bottom of the bowl so you don't even get to really eat it, the food was bland, no flavor."}
{"text":"Once you try it, you will come back again and again.  Under new management and the the food is great.  The staff is extremely accommodating and very welcoming.  No one seemed to agree on which bowl was the best, when I asked for guidance,  they all had separate favs.  I ended up trying the Chicken Teriyaki.  Loved the fresh veggies, and had a terrific flavor.  Its nice to know there are still places I can go that are healthy for my figure and tastes great on the tongue.   They have a new wheel that they seem to be trying out.  It was nice to have an extra discount and made us all laugh as we spun it.  Seemed silly, but hey anything that makes one smile is always great.  One of the staff came out and made chopstick aids for my kids, so that even they could feel like big kids and eat like the Japanese...lol Jared should give up subway and come here...lmao"}
{"text":"Nice relaxed atmosphere. Wonderful music. Yummy rice bowls. I'll see ya there."}
{"text":"This is a quick food franchise found commonly in malls, serves quick Japanese food.  Well I wouldn't even consider it Japanese food as it is really not, fusion would be the right word.  I came here because I was craving for some rice and I was attending night school at Centennial College nearby.  Teriyaki was very very average, the rice underneath was all mushy.  The sauce is too similar to soya sauce, I prefer the traditional real teriyaki sauce that's got a bit of sweetened taste to it.  The good thing is that they cook to order, portion is reasonable.  Don't expect too much from this place, it's a quick food Japanese fusion place and it's nothing compared to a Japanese restaurant, even though it says Made in Japan."}
{"text":"I love yakisoba noodles - great, healthy, the same at every location."}
{"text":"The worst lunch ever. the food tasted gross and the service was horrible.  I will NEVER eat there again!!!"}
{"text":"This location is supposed to be open till 10 pm. Got there by 8:30 pm and just as I got out of the car they turned off the open sign and closed the restaurant. There must be something really wrong with area. Ugh."}
{"text":"Ordered take out and it was very disappointing! Have ordered from other teriyaki locations but didn't like the food here.."}
{"text":"In terms of fast food, Teriyaki Experience is definitely a decent choice.  Whether it's the teriyaki chicken or the udon noodles with chicken, I find it always a decent meal when I'm on the go.  This location is in a food court, but there are always a lot of seating available & they usually provide good and quick service so I enjoy this location."}
{"text":"One of the worst meals I've ever had. Chicken was burnt, one measly broccoli and they charged my husband $4 for bubble tea without tapioca. Very disappointed!"}
{"text":"I used to come to this place on a regular basis, when I was working nearby. Nothing fancy but the food is tasty (chicken teriyaki with rice is my favorite) and quite light, the quality is very consistent and the portions are just the right size (I usually don't eat too much). And I really like  their teriyaki sauce. I even got a bottle to cook with at home. All in all a solid quick bite option to consider (they have quite a few locations throughout the city)."}
{"text":"Teriyaki Chicken...  A normal chicken teriyaki in 595 bay Street food court.   Overpriced of $9   Vegetables are not cooked at all. Employees are not in the mood.  Not recommended."}
{"text":"Not sure if this place got new owners but the food has gone downhill and it's sad because it's the closest location to me. The rice and noodles are always so soggy."}
{"text":"The food is damn good here!  This place is missing from Yelp and I'm not sure why. The meat is fresh, the noodles are succulent, and the veggies are crisp.  You can't go wrong with whatever you order, but I recommend getting the soup.  The broth is just delicious, and they prepare everything right there in front of you.   The egg rolls are a pleasure to eat also.  I'm always satisfied with my meal."}
{"text":"I wanted simple and easy and came across this place. Super easy to menu and bowls are made to order. The sides that I wanted to try like the shrimp tempura and dumplings are nit made to order. I was disappointed at this so I didn't order any. The dine in experience was just like eating at any fast food place, nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"For $8.58 you were given a small portion of rice, a few slices of badly cooked onion, green and red pepper with a few very thin, small, slices of chicken.  This is not good value!"}
{"text":"Never again! My noodles were cold. They're not supposed to be cold. I waited 15mins for cold noodles that were not supposed to be cold. I think an elementary school kid could have made a better stir fry than what i got."}
{"text":"Been frequenting this place more often now that they offer brown rice.  As far as fast food goes this is pretty healthy stuff.  I usually stick to the chicken or beef over brown rice--have not tried the yakisoba noodles but they do look appetizing.  Extra mushrooms are a must as they really round out the bowl nicely.  Their teriyaki sauce is too watered down for me so I usually buy a bottle of the real stuff and add it myself.  Staff are very efficient.  Same staff have been around for a long time so they will remember your order by heart if your a regular."}
{"text":"Holy crap, this location is bad. Went in today to grab a teriyaki bowl and the worker there was crusty. August 8,2015.  He did not acknowledged us nor greet any customers. The place looked like a damp , dirty tables food leftovers everywhere.   Not sure if he was left alone and was pissed about it , other customers came in and he didn't even come out of the kitchen to check  on them... They ended up leaving.   Found uncooked meat on the counter, wondering how long has it been there.   Avoid and continue driving to the next teriyaki..."}
{"text":"Visited yesterday at lunch and had the chicken with vegetables. All was good except the small portion of chicken they give you, otherwise it would have been a 5."}
{"text":"CLOSED  Looks like another one bites the dust...  great location, great prices, good portions, good service but HORRIBLE food maybe cause its a Canadian company...next time when the sign says \"Made in Japan\"...maybe the food or company should actually come from there."}
{"text":"I eat lunch here on regular basis and I really like it.  It is a small, fast food Asian style eatery that is free of potentious decor or service but is pretty good at what it does.  Choose noodles or rice then choose your protein then choose your sauce and you're done.  Nothing special yet delicious, fresh, cheap and more importantly fast. Very fast.  No brainer choice for quick lunch if you don't want those burger and fries.."}
{"text":"This location is probably the best out of all the ones around the path. They also have a lunch special (Chicken and Beef Teriyaki w. Rice - $8) which cannot be found at any other location! I repeat...CAN NOT be found at any other location. I usually stick to just the Chicken Teriyaki and have not tried any of their noodle items. The beef Teriyaki isnt my favourite either however, if you prefer the beef they do give you a generous portion. The workers are friendly, the portions are extremely generous and you will head back to your desk filling stuffed. Although I am more a fan of Edo Japan, Teriyaki Experience fills the teriyaki void I have in my life."}
{"text":"Friendly, knowledgeable cashier that is flexible in accommodating your requests, and can give recommendations according to your tastes. Large dining area with above table outlets scattered throughout.   Order and pay at the cashier:  -Choose you base - brown/white rice, udon noodles, yakisoba noodles, rice noodles or super grains combo (sprouted brown rice, black quinoa, green wheat freekeh)         -Choose your protein -chicken, beef, shrimp, tpfu, veggie, combo of two). You can double the amount of protein for an additional $2.99. -Choose your sauce (see pic for choices).    They cook up their food Teppanyaki style (prepared on an iron griddle) so it comes out quick and hot. You have the option of requesting for your food to be cooked with water instead of their secret Asian cooking sauce to cut down on salt.  I chose beef with udon noodles topped with hot and spicy sauce. There wasn't enough sauce to coat the noodles so I went back to ask for more and they were more than willing to accommodate me. The beef was mediocre but the noodles and sauce were delicious; you can purchase their bottled sauces 350 ml for $4.99.  Hubby got the Typhoon bowl: shrimp not fresh and the noodles were overcooked and sticky. We tried the gyoza but they tasted bland and parts of the edges were hard. Thought about getting the eggrolls but they looked greasy and not fresh (they were sitting under heat lamps).   Right before we left I saw some fruit jelly cups for $1 so I got one of each flavor: Lychee, Mango, Strawberry and Coconut. You can't go wrong with fruit jellies; my favorites are the tropical fruit ones. You can find them next to the salads.  Would come back to try their spicy udon noodle soup and rice bowls."}
{"text":"Fairly standard \"Made in Japan\" mall-type Japanese food. The meat isn't plentiful and consists largely of over-cooked scraps. It's placed over top a bed of plain rice or noodles. Back in the day it might have passed as Japanese food but with sushi restaurants everywhere it may have lost its place."}
{"text":"This is the very same \"Made in Japan: A Teriyaki Experience\" that you know from the food court in a mall. It is prepared in exactly the same way and tastes the same. So points for consistency. But this is as much the kind of Japanese food that you'd get at a good sushi place as McDonald's is a place to get beef like you'd get at a steakhouse.  The food is tasty enough, but meats are thin and dry and without much taste aside from the teriyaki sauce. Think and expect mall food and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I ordered ramen and got a noodle soup that tasted NOTHING like ramen. I should know better than to expect real Japanese food at Teriyaki experience, but it should at least be somewhat like what it is named. They used udon noodles, not ramen noodles. Broth was very bland and because I asked for spicy, some siracha was squirted on top of the chicken. I've had their teriyaki chicken over rice years ago and it was decent enough (different location). I will definitely not be ordering the ramen there again, may not go back for anything, but definitely not the ramen. If you like ramen, please don't order it there."}
{"text":"The tofu is ok here.  It has a different texture than normal.  I like the yakisoba noodles.  It's about the same as other locations within the chain from a consistency perspective.  When I was at this location, a lady walked in and said she had allergies and demanded they wash everything in front of her.  I didn't hear what she was allergic to, but if I were going somewhere and knew I was allergic to something, I'd probably go somewhere else."}
{"text":"My all time favourite lunch spot. The food is always steaming hot (be careful don't burn your tongue) and delicious! The chef who makes teriyaki is such a nice guy! He always makes my day!"}
{"text":"This is by far my favourite teriyaki place! The food is amazing and the vegetarian option is delicious! I got the teriyaki rice bowl with a spring roll and a drink. The service was super fast and the staff were friendly. I sat down and ate at the place cause it wasn't busy which is when I noticed they had a tv as well which was relaxing. Great fast food place to go! I got my food within 5 minutes. The Spring roll is oily though. The amount you pay for the amount of food you get is very good!"}
{"text":"I am at this place right now, watching the dude behind the counter clipping his finger nails, where my food was just sitting. I am absolutely disgusted. If it wasn't for the the sweet lady who took my order this place would get 1 star."}
{"text":"Haven't been to one of these in a while and saw this was a fairly new location so I decided to try it.  I ordered the protein bowl for dine in which is a new dish I don't remember them offering before. They told me to have a seat and someone from the kitchen actually brought my meal to me. Never had this at other locations, so I dunno if it is only this location or if all do it and I just don't know because it has been so long since I've been.  The protein bowl is decent value for what you get. I came around the end of lunch time so there were still a lot of seats. Good location to visit if you want to sit for a bit. They have a TV there as well to watch to kill time."}
{"text":"I love this place. I always order their beef teryiaki and soak it in hot sauce. Delish!  Friendly staff :)"}
{"text":"I ordered separate entrees for about 12 of us using Skip the Dishes. The friendly guy from the restaurant  called to confirm something about our beverages where I think other similar establishments would have ignored. The food was actually quite delicious! It was freshly prepared, came in nice containers and good portions. I would totally order from them again as it a good alternative to a healthy lunch."}
{"text":"bought here before but first time under new management, cooks are basically college or uni kids. bottom of bowl filled with water from veggies not being cooked. beef was just dry and salty."}
{"text":"The food was good, but it was just a bit pricey. The food comes to you pretty fast and I suggest you speak clearly so the lady knows what to put in, but over it deserves 4 stars"}
{"text":"They ran out of f*cking mushrooms at 2pm in the afternoon on a Sunday. Its only an essential ingredient in their dishes. No big deal."}
{"text":"They are ok - sometimes they are hit and miss.... hopefully they hire more Asian people cause the whites they have working make mistakes and don't cook the food properly sometimes..."}
{"text":"DO NOT EAT HERE YOU WILL GET FOOD POSIONING AND GET YELLED AT BY THE OWNER!!! The owner while cooking the meats used the same utensils to cut the raw chicken that he used to touch the cooked beef. when i asked him to not cross contaminate the utensils he started yelling and then i asked him to give me new beef and cook it with new utensils he refused and kept on yelling. i asked for a refund which he yelled at his employee to do and then left while he kept on yelling infront of other guests. HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!!! HORRIBLE FOOD"}
{"text":"Not anything to write home about.   Went there with two friends since I had a coupon, thought it would be a nice change of pace. I got teriyaki chicken and it was so-so. I'm a fan of veggies, but there was definitely a veggie overload on my plate. And they don't put the sauces on while it's cooking, my friends took three or four little cups of sauce back to our table to try them out.   Probably won't eat here again."}
{"text":"I've always been a fan of this chain .... Most of them have good food and sucky workers. Here the chef is so friendly and makes the atmosphere fun!!"}
{"text":"Just visited this location and it's the filthiest, stinkiest restaurant I've ever walked into.  Floors / tables are filthy and it smells like a dirty bathroom.  It was so gross I had to leave.  Very gross!"}
{"text":"Worst \"Japanese\" ever. There was one other couple in the place, but it still took almost 20 minutes for this fast food fiasco.  They cook the food right at the counter, which helped me understand how it got so bad. The main issues were that the grill was both encrusted in grease (not in a my-grill-is-finally-seasoned way but in a this-gunk-is-sticking-to-everything way) and was set at far too high a heat. My chicken seared immediately to the grill and the cook had to scrape it off in order to turn it. In the end, the meat was shredded and stringy.  There were four or five sauce options; I asked what one with an odd name tasted like, but the employees have apparently never tried it (and one confided that he had never eaten there). Too bad for me, I didn't get the hint when I was ordering so I stuck around for the food. Never again."}
{"text":"Quick friendly service, clean place. I didn't stay in but there's a load of seating for a quick service place. Used an Entertainment coupon here hassle free. I ordered Zesty Pinneapple Chicken and a 6 piece gyoza. Servings didn't seem small to me.."}
{"text":"Great fresh food made right in front of you, prompt service and lots of good comfortable seating !"}
{"text":"I have been visiting this location of Teriyaki Experience for at least a year. When I feel like a fairly healthy meal, I come here.   This location is bright, clean, and pretty quiet for such a place. I like sitting here, eating, surfing with the complimentary wifi, and watch whatever program is on Global TV. Yes, the channel seems permanently set to this one! I don't mind it.   The owner is friendly. The other Saturday, I came in. He told me that the system was down and that the cash register was locked. He apologized and said that he had called his boss to help. I was bummed out and said that I'd come back soon.   I did. I went back last Sunday and said to him, \"Does your cash register work today?\" He chuckled and said yes.   Yes, I paid for my chicken teriyaki on rice with a soft drink with my debit card. It was $10. That's pretty good for the portion size that I got.   I like it here. It's quieter than eating at a mall food court and there is hardly a lineup here. !"}
{"text":"Everything's always fresh and there's a surprising amount of variety.   I've had just about everything on the menu and usually get the daily special because it's a good deal, $7.50 for a big lunch is a great for anywhere in Toronto.  Most of the bowls come with rice or noodles, sprouts, veggies, and your choice of meat. Chicken, beef, shrimp, or combo. Then you have 3 sauces to choose from, sweet chili, pan asian, and teriyaki.  The teriyaki is not very flavorful so I tend to stick with one of the other two.   The soup bowls are also very good and surprisingly filling.   There's brown rice on request at no additional charge.  It's work a try for a quick lunch.   FYI, this place is downstairs in the PATH"}
{"text":"Hadn't been for a while.. weren't prices 7.99 last year? The price is $12 now and they've gone \"eco friendly package,\" sure seemed like I got a lot less in the box then I did in bowl. And they swear the vegetable portions got bigger.. I ordered extra meat, the kid dropped it and the. The boss can from the back, looked at my meal and shaved off 1/4 of my meat... right in front of me they jacked my extra meat...  I had given a 2 star but the more I wrote the review the more mad I got. $19.85 for hot and spicy extra chicken and pop ... Should have handled the too much meat situation differently. Not a fan of new pricing and the boxes.. I mentioned that about St. Louis as well... my box is going on the garbage can that's going to the landfill, tied in a plastic bag... Will I repeat? I won't go out of my way not to go, it was good.. just left sour."}
{"text":"Never again. This place is a joke. They sell their bentos but don't even have any dumplings left that we're supposed to go with it. So instead they give us coupons to claim for our next visit. As if we are going back. They are so stingy with the meat and they give tons of rice and veggies."}
{"text":"I came in here on a Friday night there was a guy ahead of me getting his order made by an old Asian man. By the looks of it the guy ahead of me looked annoyed and seemed like he was waiting there awhile. The young Asian guy took my order while the old man spoke to him in his language he seemed to be yelling at him and at everything he did. The poor kid just put his head Down and ran around as the old man barked orders. Needless to say I felt really bad and angry at the way the old man was treating this young Asian boy he must've been between 16-18 years old. On top of that my good tasted mediocre. I will never go back here not because of the food but because of how this man treated his employees."}
{"text":"This Teriyaki place is conveniently located in a shopping centre plaza and neighbours a Starbucks and Sally's Beauty Supply. The interior is clean, spacious, and there's plenty of seating available. It's probably your best alternative to Thai Express. The ingredients look fresh and it comes out hot, which is why it takes a little bit longer to prepare than regular fast food. You won't fall head over heels but the people are nice and the food is good."}
{"text":"Ordered the pineapple chicken dish with extra chicken ($2.99 plus tax extra) Got the same amount of chicken asa normal portions.  There were only 3 pieces of pineapple in the plate, literally, 3!  2 veggies out of the 5 that has to come with the dish were missing The food taste and quality was great though."}
{"text":"Traveling from the USA, I had my data turned off, so I was not able to yelp for a place to eat as I was walking.....to bad because this was a disappointment.   Nothing was really bad, it was just not really good ether.   I had the rice noodle typhoon bowl, the shrimp, well they were pretty bad."}
{"text":"I suggest you all take another look at this restaurant. It is under NEW OWNERSHIP and NEW MANAGEMENT. Service is much better, and food quality is higher than before.  It's great for those of us who are health conscious that you can choose your meat to be cooked in either oil or water.   Open for business and better than ever!"}
{"text":"NOT impressed. The food was bland, the chicken rubbery, the service was slow despite only one other customer in the joint, and all-in-all, it was a mall-food-like experience.  I won't be back, lots of other options within steps."}
{"text":"Is really nice place ... you can charge your car and grab your food. The employees is was nice and good food."}
{"text":"Potentially a good replacement for the now gone Tempe Kyoto Bowl. The food is very good, and is prepared in front of you so you know it hasn't been moldering in a pot for hours in the back.   The employees upsell a little too much for my taste, but they're new and I think that will stop over time. They also bespeak the healthfulness of the food. (Well really, they talked up the \"healthyness,\" but that's wrong, food isn't healthy. People are.) This may just be my own personality disorder, but I don't want employees getting that chatty with me when I'm ordering lunch. Stop trying to convince me how good your food is Daniel Webster, just rustle me up a plate and I'll get back to you! Sheesh!   It certainly doesn't make me feel sluggish like overly fatty food usually does, it has a lot more vegetables in it, I was able to get my Teriyaki Chicken with brown rice, and it is comparably priced to Kyoto Bowl or Samurai Sams.  While they just opened, which usually means you can't really trust the Yelp review until they've settled in a bit more, it is part of a chain, so I don't think there will be much of a change. The food is yummy, it doesn't take long, and it isn't terribly expensive for what you get. (My Teriyaki Bowl was $6.80)"}
