{"text":"Beautiful decore.  Delicious food. Kind of hard to tell from outaide if its open or closed. But the food is amazing"}
{"text":"Very tastiy food here 
Ambiance is great as it's upscale inside. 
Bathrooms are very clean and has a dish with cotton towelettes.   Very nice touch. 

Great spot for date night. 
A little pricey but tasty food and worth it for the night out to treat yourself.

Value for the money is still Funky Thai on Dundas Street, but if you want ambiance and romantic setting, this is it.
enjoy!"}
{"text":"On a late Friday evening with nothing at home to cook for dinner, we decided to wander into charming, if somewhat $intimidating$, downtown Oakville. (We live north the QEW where the peasants toil.) The Italian joint next door was a bit too busy, but a giant wooden door caught our eye, and we had to step through. Wow! The decor is stunning and the ambiance mysterious but soothing. It looked like it could be formal, but a quick survey of the other diners assured us that it was casual with a mix of couples, families and a girls' night out. The food was delicious, delicately seasoned, not overwhelming like some cheaper Thai joints I usually hit for lunch. Remarkably, the price was actually very reasonable for a great dinner, not as expensive as I was expecting given its premium location, lavish decor and excellent service. This is the new place we bring out-of-towners!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, beautiful decor and impeccable service. If you like seafood, I highly recommend the fish curry - made with red snapper immersed in a rich red curry, this dish is delectable with complex flavors. I had a memorable and enjoyable lunch with family and will definately go again."}
{"text":"This place from the outside doesn't match what you'll find inside, as it surprised me to find how they really did a good job incorporating that Thai theme and making great food to match. I found how they set the place up quite nice and the booths for a larger group very neat, I personally didn't get to sit in the booth but if you have a group of 6 or more and you want to step away from the typical burger, fries, pasta give this place a try. The booths/walls have a cool light effect and looks very cozy as well. 

The prices are a bit on the high side for Thai food I found so be prepared to shell out a few dollars there compared to typical Thai restaurants. The service would be something I would say is so-so because when I called for reservations there was a bit of a language barrier and just gave up and went there and had no further problems."}
{"text":"Decor is beautiful and food is very legit. Everything is fresh with high quality ingredients and tastes authentic. The curries run fairly spicy as a default (I personally love that) so don't miss getting one. Pad Thai was also on point. Only downside is curries don't come with rice so make sure you order a side."}
{"text":"Why do I continue to come back here???
It has beautiful Asian decor, but food and service is...OK......

Location is convenient in the winter when it's difficult to venture out to good thai restaurants in Toronto.

If I wasn't invited to this restaurant for birthdays and other events, I would not care to go."}
{"text":"Went here for an early lunch. When I say early I really mean it. We were the first patrons of the day. We weren't sure if they were even open. The welcome sign was not on. The massive door at the entrance looked intimidating. But my sister was hungry and determined. Though the door was huge and looked heavy to pull,it was actually very light and pulled smoothly open for us. Once inside I was very impressed with the decor. 5 stars. It was dimly lit even for the daytime. We called out to the empty restaurant and someone quickly greeted us from the back. We were promptly seated and ordered quickly. We ordered chicken pad thai,red curry beef and glass noodle salad. Our 2 mains came with sour and hot soup and a veg spring roll. Both were quite good. The noodle salad was slightly more spicy  then expected and needed a little more acid to brighten the flavour. The chicken pad thai was too sweet. Chicken pieces tasted stale and refrigerated. The red curry beef was good. I especially enjoyed the curry sauce. The food didn't impress as much as the decor. The prices are slightly higher then most Thai restos, the portions are average and the quality I would say average to slightly below. Depends on the dish you order. I would recommend this place for a date night, solely on the decor. But for a foodie like me, I wouldn't go out of my way to dine here."}
{"text":"We've frequented this restaurant many times but only for take out, and it has been consistently good...except for today. We ordered 4 dishes -- Pad Thai, their eggplant veggie dish, chicken satay and shrimp spring rolls. I can say unequivocally that all the dishes were terrible.  The Pad Thai tasted like it had been sitting in a pan all day, and they had tossed in some oil to reheat it.  The eggplant dish was cold, the satay was the closest to rubber Satay that I've had, and the spring rolls were tough.

When we called them to complain, they offered us a credit but only for one of the dishes and they wanted us to bring back the left over food. So, let's put this in context. We drove to pick up the food once, it was appalling, and now we're being forced to bring back the food for a credit on one dish. Where's the notion of the customer always being right?  Suffice to say, my advice to discerning patrons would be to steer clear of this establishment because they clearly don't offer good food or good service anymore.  I'll gladly take my hard earned money elsewhere."}
{"text":"I came here on a Saturday night with my boyfriend for the first time. We both enjoyed the decor and the atmosphere with the low lights. It's great for dates. 

The food itself was good. We ordered a hot and sour soup and spring rolls to share.  Nothing special but i felt that the soup was sweeter than what I am used to.    We then proceeded to order the green curry with chicken and pad Thai with shrimp.  I really enjoyed the green curry but we thought it was weird you had to order rice on the side since most restaurants would have it with it.  The pad Thai was good but nothing spectacular. 

My only complaint was the service.  We felt that it wasn't very attentive where several times we had to flag someonw down to get out waters refilled. 

Overall I liked the restaurant but it isn't worth the drive from Brampton to go there."}
{"text":"We've been a few times to this place, and have always left satisfied.

There is a great vegetarian selection.  

The decor is also amazing, which is an added bonus.

THe mango salad, papaya salad, spring rolls, pad Thai and vegetarian soup are highly recommended."}
{"text":"Great Thai food and service, excellent Gewerztraminer by the glass, just perfect!"}
{"text":"Food is delicious and fresh!  Lovely atmosphere, treat yourself and check this place out."}
{"text":"BEST green curry. Vegetables are fresh and cooked crisp to perfection. Excellent balance of flavors in every dish. Warm and cordial service. Love it here!!"}
{"text":"This is hands down some of the best Thai food I have ever had in Oakville or in the Toronto area. It is a little on the pricey side but it is definitely worth the money! The staff is very friendly and the food comes out promptly. Some of my favourite dishes are the fresh spring rolls, fried spring rolls, chicken satay, pad thai, cashew nut chicken, red curry, fried glass noodles, chicken and shrimp fried rice, etc. Any new dish I seem to try ends up being amazing! Very nice spot."}
{"text":"This is the best Thai food that I have ever had. Very fresh ingredients and good service. I would highly recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"This place gets six stars for design and atmosphere.  The decor is rich and unbelievably authentic. 

I really like going to this restaurant when I am trying to impress. The only down side is that there are better Thai food places when it comes to taste. Will be five star if they can master the Pad Thai."}
{"text":"I will start with yelp lead me a stray... not on the food but the parking... they do not have a private parking...street parking and I can't parallel part plus you have to pay to park. But since it was after 6 it was free.
Now to the food omg so good. I asked for spicy and they delivered without going over. The flavors were so good. The potion sizes wasn't too small or big ... just right. 
Now they would had gotta four stars but I had to lower it for service . They forgot about me after I finished dinner. I finished they took my plate and I never saw my waitress again, but she passed right by me and never said anything. I had to ask a random person to order dessert. And that is after I sat for 5 mins of no one."}
{"text":"i liked the place - the decorations and the atmosphere were elegant and quite, and i felt it would be a very romantic place for a date. Food was fine (like above average), but the portions were the fewest i've ever seen in any thai restaurants - almost as little as Japanese a la carte standard portions, haha. i liked the seafood combination in creamy red curry sauce and the green curry chicken."}
{"text":"What you notice first when you enter Soontorn Thai Is the decor.  You feel like your in a plush lounge with low lights and lots of lush purple velvet and silk.  Upon review of the menu we ordered red snapper, hot and sour soup and calamari.  The calamari starter arrived piping hot with a side of a peppery dipping sauce topped with chopped peanuts.  They were enjoyable but we noticed some pieces were rubbery.  My main of hot and sour soup was excellent, not too vinegary in flavor and well stocked with tofu.  The red snapper was the highlight of our meal. The fish was smaller in size but was prepared in a pungent garlic sauce. My partner and I pretty much scraped the plate clean.  The fish was very delicate and the garlic sauce went perfectly with it.  Our server was very attentive prices were slightly higher than your average Thai restaurant but given the location and atmosphere were not unreasonable."}
{"text":"Great food but okay service. The service depends  on what time you are there. They don't like customers after 8 pm, the service becomes pretty lousy and the staff behaves differently that you are not welcome. But in spite  of the service I will give this place 5 stars. The food is super great. I love their mango salad, tom kha soup and their green chicken curry. One of the amazing thai food places. The decor is beautiful, very peaceful."}
{"text":"Soontorn is hands-down my favorite restaurant in Oakville. If I still lived there, I'd probably go every weekend. It's in a great location, in Town Square near the Green Bean, so if you're walking around downtown and haven't tried it out yet, I highly recommend it.

First of all, I absolutely love the atmosphere. To get in, you open a huge wooden door that looks like it belongs on a castle, and then feel your way though a large velvet curtain. Once you step through to the other side, it feels like you're miles away from downtown. It's dark and romantic, with silky curtains hanging from the ceiling illuminated by shafts of light, banquettes covered in satin cushions, and soft music. There are also large, low tables with piles of cushions to sit on if you come in a group. You have to check out the bathrooms, too. They're just really cool.

The other reason I adore this place is obviously the food. I've never tried anything here that I didn't love. My favorites are always the Pad Thai (the best I've ever had) and the Tamarind Shrimp (one of my top 10 dishes ever). It's definitely pricey - you will pay a few dollars more than anywhere else for almost all their dishes, but I swear it's worth it. The portions are also not as large as you may get elsewhere, but I've always left satisfied. 

The Bahn Thai in Burlington is owned by the same people, but the menu is different and the atmosphere is more casual. Even if you haven't had great experiences there, I still highly recommend you give Soontorn a chance.

Oh, and for the Nintendo fans...something about this place always reminds me of Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time. I think it's a combination of the lighting, the music, and the cushions shaped like Triforces. Seriously."}
{"text":"Probably the best Thai food in all of the GTA. Firstly the decor inside is absolutely beautiful! Staff is extremely friendly and able to help you with anything. The chefs are also open to changes and will accommodate any dietary needs. I love their pad Thai and make sure you save space for their sticky rice and mango dessert - it's one of the best ever!"}
{"text":"O.M.G.
Had the red curry fish and the tamarind and beef - orgasmic!!!! Really, do I need to say more?!?"}
{"text":"So again I was craving for Pad Thai... I don't know what it is about it. 

But anyways we ordered take-out from this place but we should have dined in because the ambiance was incredible. So of course I ordered the vegetable pad thai, and it was really good and the vegetable were realllllly fresh!  The only thing I didn't really like is the strong taste of fish sauce. Could have been just that batch of sauce that was made.

p.s. The front door is really unique, have fun figuring out how to open it. ;)"}
{"text":"authentic Thai food, good service, cozy ambience, reasonably priced. Excellent wine selection."}
{"text":"I love their food here it is one of the best in the area. 

They're very accommodating for those with dietary restrictions which isn't always as easy as you may think at Thai restaurants. Some of them make their sauces ahead of time, but not these guys! They make everything fresh. 

My one complaint is the lack of light inside. It is very dark! Beautiful decor but a bit depressing at times. Especially during the day! 

Otherwise I would have given it 5 stars. The food deserves 5 stars for sure!"}
{"text":"Very authentic Thai here. The dim lighting and decor make it feel intimate. Service was great as well. Prob one of the best Thai in gta."}
{"text":"Loved it. Great food and awesome ambiance. The prawn curry is to die for."}
{"text":"Well worth a visit.  Great option when you discover that many restaurants in the Downtown Core close on a Monday. Friendly, attentive staff. Tasty well presented food. At $6 a glass....wine is good value when most are charging $10 for 6oz."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to this place. First we were out on lakeshore road in middle of snow storm yesterday couldn't find the Resturant called them twice they failed to guide properly. Went in cold as hell. Ordered a bottle of wine and they only had normal glasses no wine glasses. They offered to give us champagne glasses instead. Although it was -12C outside. White wine was warm. After 8 mins of my order they brought all the food out and didn't even give us 10 mins to enjoy our first glass of wine. Food was just ok and for the prices they charged we expected much better. Had to return Pad Thai Shrimp because it had a foul smell. Terrible experience."}
{"text":"Every dish Ive had was quite good. The only thing that threw me off was the small serving size for the price. $19 for their chicken cashew dish equivalent to one piece of chicken breast...great taste but costly. I could get this elsewhere for $10 and twice the portion."}
{"text":"Great food. Quiet environment. Is fish crackers and chicken curry were really good. The mango rice was also a great dessert. Service was also superb."}
{"text":"I love this place! First off, the staff is very friendly and helpful. I only eat here once a year while visiting from out of town but the host remembers me and comes to the table to chat and catch up. Second, the atmosphere and decor are great. Upscale but casual and inviting.
The food is fantastic. I had the cashew chicken and loved it. Spicy but well balanced dish with lots of great flavor. Fresh oranges were used to make the sauce and pieces of orange are tossed in. The pad Thai is also a great choice. Would definitely recommend for a casual lunch or a nice dinner out."}
{"text":"Very tasty thai food.   I have been here maybe 3 times over 5 years.   Tonight I had the chicken satay which I would say is the best I have had.   Really soft and very delicious,  really a subtle and yummy peanut sauce.    Then we had tamarind fish which was delicious    We also had basil chicken my favourite Thai dish that I order in all Thai restaurants,  and it didn't disappoint,  it was delicious too.   The staff were very friendly and as others have said it is a beautiful restaurant.   I would come back here again for sure..."}
{"text":"Excellent, slightly upscale Thai restaurant in downtown Oakville. It's in a little square next to L'Atelier Grigorian, through the massive wooden doors. The place is dark and atmospheric with cushy pillows and ornate furniture. Definitely has a lounge-y vibe and would be a nice place to go even just for drinks. Lots of cozy nooks and round tables which are great for groups. 
Thankfully, it's not just style over substance. The kitchen delivers with hearty, authentic Thai dishes with fresh, quality ingredients. My friend and I shared: fresh vegetarian rolls, chicken pad thai, and red curry tofu. Portions were generous (we both ate a lot and still had leftovers). Service was courteous. The prices are slightly more expensive than your average Thai restaurant, but still pretty reasonable. Definitely one of the best Thai places I have found in the west GTA."}
{"text":"I came here with my husband for his birthday a few days ago since we were craving Thai food. We ordered the chicken pad thai and green curry chicken with jasmine rice. Both were good portions and flavourful. Pricing wasn't bad either - about $40 I think for the two dishes. The place wasn't very busy but there were about another 8 couples having a quiet romantic dinner there on a Monday night. The ambience and decor were nice - some areas for dinner and others for lounging around and having drinks. There was plenty of room for groups as well. Staff were nice and hardworking. We appreciated having time to ourselves and not having someone constantly checking in with us. I'd definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"It has been a long time since I had such an amazing fine Thai experience. From the service to the food, from welcoming to the end of the experience it was simply a very fine place. The food was absolutely amazing, so were the cocktails. The staff is friendly and the ambiance is classy. Perfect for romantic dinners or just for lunch."}
{"text":"Maybe we arrived too early in the day (5:45 on a Sunday) to receive their best effort. But we will not return to find out.
A beautiful setting inside 4.5 stars
Satay chicken 2 stars with the texture and taste that suggested reheated. Yellow chicken curry 2.5 stars featuring the same sad chicken but veggies that were seemingly fresh and curry sauce that was at least ok. Vegetable Pad Thai 3.5 stars and easily the tastiest dish. Ginger beef a brutal shoe leather 1 star."}
{"text":"The place was kind hard to find at night. The sign is not visible. It's located in the corner on the inner sides of the street.  

The decor and ambiance of the place looks really good. The place is really nicely designed. It has a lot of beautiful decor that gives it a Thai feel to it. They have authentic Thai style food but the taste might have been altered for others. The waitresses are Thai ethnicity.   

Came here with a group of 8. The wait was way too long and a big turn off. 

Opinions on the food: 

Pineapple chicken curry - pineapples is extreme sour. Not too spicy. The chickens good. The red curry is thick and creamy. $16.95

Yellow chicken curry - creamy and slightly spicy but not too spicy. The yellow curry is not thick enough more watery than the other ones. $16.95

Thai shrimp curry - the green curry was not spicy enough. More of a mild curry. Not a spicy curry. It wasn't really flavourful. It was ok. $19.95

Rice has to be ordered separate. $2.95

Crab fried shrimp - it was ok. Not flavourful enough. Needs more spices. There was little crab meat, it was not really distinct. $15.95

Tom yum soup - too sour. Not a lot of tom yum flavour just overpowering citrus flavour and not spicy. $7.95 

Basil shrimp - it was good, loved it but there was only 6 pieces of shrimp for  $18.95 felt like it was overpriced for that portion. It was mostly vegetables. 

Garlic beef - the flavour of the garlic beef is really good but the beef is a little tough. It's also a little too salty.  $19.95

Thai ice tea - the Thai ice tea is really good but a little on the sweeter side.  Creamy and rich. Taste better than most places. $5

Piña colada - pretty good if you like coconut. It's not too sweet.

Mange sticky rice - the mango was hard and really sour. The sticky rice was warm and soft. It was coated with coconut and sesame seeds. $8.95 not worth it. 

Washrooms 5/5 - lovely design really unique. It's very spacious. It was really clean and the soap smelt nice. They even have lotion. 

I give a 3/5 for the food. 4/5 for the design and cleanliness. 

Overall I give this restaurant a 4/5. A little pricey as the curries don't include rice."}
{"text":"Easily the best Thai restaurant I've ever experienced.
The restaurant itself is stylishly decorated, with consistent sculpture themes and furniture shape, intimate mood lighting and cute little candles at every table.
The menu is diverse with interesting and elegant dishes, often it's so hard to choose I get multiple courses! The ingredients are always so fresh and cleanly applied I don't even feel guilty and bloated after eating, which is hard to find in a restaurant with this taste quality.
I have never been disappointed with a dish, this place is incredibly good at demolishing the struggle between new and familiar when eating out-both are an adventure!
The combination of flavors is superb, I'm particularly fond of the use of lemon grass and peanuts.
I HIGHLY recommend their dessert; \"sticky rice with tropical ice cream\".  Every time my boyfriend and I share it, we're shocked into silence at the first mouthful.
While it is kind of pricey, and the frequent customers are Oakville snobs, it's worth it."}
{"text":"Tonight the six of us went for the first time. 

If you are rating just the food itself then the scores would be 4.5 out of 5.

Ambiance would be a 4.0 out of 5.0. The reason for the less than perfect score would be the less than perfect round tables. They look nice but the seats on the end aren't comfortable; there is nothing to lean back on. We tried it out and then opted for a table.

The dishes we tried were the Chicken Pad Thai, the Shrimp Pad Thai, the Spicy Thai Noodle, the Cashew Chicken and the Chicken Fried Rice.  The Pad Thai was awesome. The Cashew chicken had \"kick\" so avoid that if you don't like a little fire.

The best parts of the evening were the food, the friends and  the ambiance.
The worst part of the evening was the service.
It took a very long time to get out \"mains\" served after the appetizers.

Would we go back? 1/2 our group said yes, while the other 1/2 said no"}
{"text":"Went for dinner here this evening with family.  Brought my parents for dinner for their wedding anniversary (49 years!).  We were a party of 6 and had made a reservation.  

I'll start will the positive.  Most was positive and I want to highlight that. 

The food was fantastic.  Everything was fresh, very flavourful, well spiced.... very impressive.  Nothing was greasy, overcooked, over seasoned.  Perfectly spiced heat wise though I could have handled more but that's me.  

We ordered several dishes to start... Thai spring rolls, chicken satay and mango salad.  Great choice, and the mango salad was outstanding !

Mains were Pad Thai, pineapple chicken curry, Thai eggplant, Thai basil chicken, ginger beef.  All of it was great and would recommend all of them.  

Only negative which is why the rating was not 5 stars, was the service.   Things seemed unorganized and confused.  Drink orders were spotty... needed to almost insist we wanted to order drinks.  My two nephews were not even asked if they wanted a juice or soda.. we needed to flag the waiter down.   They could easily step up the attention to detail and consistence  when it comes to service. 

That aside... all good. Atmosphere and decor is very nice although it was very dark.  

Enjoy !"}
{"text":"Being a sucker for modern architecture and clean lines I was drawn in to Soontorn Bahn Thai by its magnificent  facade while promenading on the Lakeshore.  Hubby excitedly pushed its huge wooden revolving door open and once we spilled inside it was GORGEOUSLY outfitted. Very South Beach...by way of Oakville.

We were welcomed in by friendly Thai servers. Actually we were the only ones there as it was their changeover time from lunch to dinner...dining purgatory if you will, but everyone was super accommodating and never made us feel like we came at an in opportune time.

We ordered the Golden Basket and Shrimp rolls to start.  The golden baskets were light and crisp fried wonton cups with a melange of diced vegetables and chicken inside, and indeed delicious.  Next for our mains we had the Pineapple fried rice and Hubby ordered the  Tamarind fish delight, which was a tangy/spicy sauce on fried red snapper, while I savored my ginger chicken.

I couldn't help but keep admiring the interior whilst eating, the lush modernity of colorful accent lighting along with the rustic wood textures mixed with handsome Thai relics artfully situated throughout.  Hubby of course proceeded to aspirate his food like a Hoover vacuum.  We finished off with paradigm banana fritters.  The meal came to a little over $100 for 2 apps , 3 mains, dessert and 2 beers and an iced tea, we felt this was fine as 1) we got prompt friendly service 2) food tasted freshly prepped and delicious 3) the surroundings made us feel like the Beckham' s dining in some exclusive resto in Koh Samui or something thereabouts.

*Special Bathroom Props - Arguably one of the most stunning Lavs I've had the pleasure to use, a private spacious cubicle with a sliding door entrance with tactful neon lighting , tastefully positioned floor mirror 
( no one wants to watch themselves go...well unless it's Germany maybe...) and decor style reminiscent of late 80's post modernism, I really regret not bringing a camera at this point.

If you love authentic Thai food and love dining in beautiful surroundings then please I urge you to check out the stunning Soontorn Bahn Thai."}
{"text":"Best Thai in Oakville! Pineapple red curry chicken is the best I have ever had and the portion size was generous.  Not a huge fan of the soft spring rolls though - they are also too fancy ... I know a strange complaint."}
{"text":"Excellent decor, attentive and friendly staff and the best Thai food in the Toronto area."}
{"text":"Trendy Thai spot in Oakville's Town Square. You can't miss the huge fortress-like door, that looks straight out of all the dungeon porn I watch. A bold first impression. 

We were greeted immediately, but cautioned that closing was an hour away. Was that necessary? Anyway, we grabbed a table when I noticed these spacepod-looking booths along the far wall. \"Can we sit there?\" I asked the way an eight-year-old might. If my mother was there she would have told me to sit quietly and behave. But she wasn't, so it was spacepod time!

Truth be told, the booth is a little weird. The seats are pretty low to the floor and the booth is backless. It's almost like the area is a pimped out version of sitting on the floor. I liked the moody lighting and the plush triangular shaped pillows, but honestly I wouldn't cram more than four people here or things would get weird.

So the first time I'm in a Thai restaurant, I usually order the pad thai. I decided to branch out and get a spicy Pad Kee Mao (big step, I know). My DC ordered a spicy pineapple chicken curry with a side of rice and we starte with an appetizer sampler (for one) to share. It really is meant for one person: three pieces of fried taro, one chicken satay skewer, one spring roll, one shrimp rolls. It wasn't amazing.

The mains however were pretty good. I enjoyed the taste of the pineapple chicken curry more than my own chicken noodle dish, but both flavourful and spicy! It was a little pricy for Thai (Over $50 for two including tip), so in that regard the food falls a little short of my expectations. But with a great atmosphere and a solid menu, I'm sure to be back.

Obligatory Title Pun: I will come back SOON.

Menu Readability: Very elegant.

Need to mention: Check out their bar made from a tree-slab.

What this place teaches me about myself: I will never not choose to sit in something resembling a spacepod. (Whatever that is.)"}
{"text":"Pro: AMAZING atmosphere and interior decor
Food tastes pretty good especially the Thai spring rolls literally amazing 
Good location 

Cons: We felt very rushed and they took our plates when I wasn't even finished and had to hold the spring roll in my hand as they took all my plates away and I don't know if this is good customer service but it was a bit much for me. When it came one to pay the waitress immediately brought the machine over as I was literally taking my last bite and there was still 1 hour before closing. Other than that the other male waiter was very nice. 

I got the chicken pad Thai and to be honest for the price, I've gotten a lot of much better pad Thai for cheaper but in Toronto so maybe this is good for Oakville standards."}
{"text":"Love this place!! My favourite Thai in Oakville! The food, atmosphere, location, and staff are all excellent. Highly recommend this hidden gem!"}
