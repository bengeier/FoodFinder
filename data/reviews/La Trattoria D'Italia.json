{"text":"I love this place. If you are looking for authentic food this is the place to be! One of their servers an Italian lady is so sweet. I honestly feel like being back in Italy when I go to this place! The food is so good, the calamari is incredible and the price is very reasonable."}
{"text":"Fresh food and you can tell its made with love. I recommend it to many people who end up liking it as well.

The pricing is extremely reasonable and you get excellent size portions, just enough to take home and warm up! 

Favourite pasta: Fettuccini Gigi.. the Spaghetti Bolognese is also amazing. The biggest reason I go though is for the desert - I think it's called Bacho Nero, chocolate encased in chocolate ice cream with a chocolate shell. So yum! 

The biggest downside over the last few years, the service has been going downhill for a long time. As well, the tables by the door against the windows are the worst. Don't sit there - especially in the winter. When people come in and out its freezing and they are practically standing on top of you."}
{"text":"Surprisingly surprising!  We could not get in anywhere else at around 7pm on a, Friday evening.  This just happened to be around the corner.  Awesome veal, great Calamari, stellar service.  I'm a picky eater and they got it right the first time.  I'll be back"}
{"text":"#120 My friend had a Groupon for this restaurant so we chose to try it out. 

Located in the same strip mall as Cal-alta Auto Glass, it is a small but welcoming restaurant.  The noise level is average as far as restaurants go. It is dimly lit, probably for intimacy's sake. Most of the tables seat four but can easily be moved for larger groups.

It has a full bar but I am concerned that an Italian restaurant that serves Sanka instant coffee.

Anywho, our Groupon consisted of two Caesar salads, a pasta (we chose spaghetti carbonara) and pizza (we chose Santa Maria which has chicken, artichokes, red bell peppers, sun dried tomatoes).

The tomato flavour comes out in the pizza which was a pleasant surprise. The ingredients flow nicely (see previous paragraph for ingredients in our pizza). Maybe it is just me but as Simon Cowell would say, the spaghetti carbonara is forgettable. It was not bad mind you; it just did not excite me. It is rather bland. Mamma Mia! What happened?

Bottom line, pizza yes and pasta no.

The service is good; the lady whom took care of us is friendly, prompt, and efficient.

I will probably come back but just for the pizza."}
{"text":"We have eaten here several times both with and without coupons. Always had good service and more than enough food. This is clearly a down to earth family business. The quality of food is very good and we always look forward to a good meal in a relaxed setting. If we wanted gourmet food at extravagant prices we would probably go somewhere else, but for a good meal out this fills the bill very well. We will be back."}
{"text":"Great service, hot food and excellent prices. involtini d pollo with stuffed pepper is fantastico.."}
{"text":"Went with a group of sixteen people and even though the reservation was made months ago, it really seemed like the restaurant was unprepared for our group. The food was pretty good to average, but the service was poor. 3 other couples were greeted, served, ate and paid before we were asked for our order. The food took quite some time to arrive. All in all, food was ok; service was not. I wouldn't return."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time last night with a teambuy coupon. The coupon was supposed to Include Caesar salad for 2, pasta for 2, a 12 inch pizza, and tiramisu.

Where do I even start with this review? The service we received was beyond horrible and hands down THE WORST service I have ever received at any restaurant and I typically eat out at least a few times a week. No food could ever be good enough to make up for this service.

First off after we were seated and given our menu we waited at least 20 mins before anyone came to take our order. We were not asked if we wanted drinks or anything. And when we first arrived there was only one other table seated in the entire restaurant. We told the young man serving us that we had a teambuy coupon and he didnt go over what that included with us at all or show us where to choose from on the menu. He just seated us and took off. We sat there waiting with no drinks offered to us for 20 mins and were starting to wonder if we should just leave because nobody was showing any indication of coming back to take our order. Finally my boyfriend had to call over the server as he was walking by to ask if we could please order now. We heard another server telling the table next to us (who also had the same teambuy coupon) that they each got to select a pasta but our server told us it was one to share only. After he finally took our order we asked him if we could order a drink and asked what they had for domestic beers. He acted all annoyed and named a couple and then said \"well I don't know, I don't really drink domestic beers\". So we asked what the international beers were and he named a few so we chose one of those. After ordering our drinks it took another 15 mins to receive them (even though at this point there were only 2 other tables). Nobody ever came back to ask if we needed another beer even after they were empty for quite some time. After each course was brought out nobody cleared any of the plates. It was like pulling teeth to get any service at all out of this guy aside from him dumping the food off at the table and he was extremely rude when asked for anything ( and we are not demanding customers at all, just expect to actually get served, this guy wouldn't have even taken our order if we hadn't asked him). Finally after sitting there and sitting there forever we decided just to go up and ask for our bill since he showed no indication of ever coming back to offer us our desert ( which was supposed to be included in the teambuy). 

What really baffled me was that it seemed like other tables were being served and everyone was just walking right by us. Though the other tables all seemed to have the same friendly female server and we were the only table with this young man. 

Anyway we decided to mention it to the owner?mangager? whoever it was at the till, that we had received poor service. They told us that the man serving us is not normally a server but is a busser and they called him in because they were short staffed. I can understand that but when we first arrived there was only one other table in the place. And knowing he is inexperienced they should have been following up with him and checking in on us from time to time to make sure everything was ok. Also seeing what a terrible server he is maybe they could have found better use for him.

Either way, we will absolutely NOT BE GOING BACK here despite the food being good. I have not had such a horrible dining expereince in a long time and it was not even worth the price of the coupon. McDonalds gives better service than this."}
