{"text":"Finally stopped here after a friend of mine telling me how good the food was, but he always grabbed it as take-out on his way home.  So, this time I said let's sit in!  We were greeted right away by friendly staff and seated, it wasn't a busy time although I'm not sure if this place gets to capacity given the location.  Plenty of delicious sounding Vietnamese meals on the menu and I chose a lemongrass vermicelli bowl with chicken and spring rolls, my friend had some seafood type pho.  My meal was a good serving size which filled me up and tasted great, a perfect amount of chicken and veggies in the bowl.  My friend was also filled by his bowl of pho, which was tasty and sufficiently spicy - which he likes.  Very nice given the reasonable prices for the meals.  Service was efficient, meals came quickly, and we were able to pay up without a long wait.  The atmosphere may be a little dull, but it's suitable for a nice quick meal.  But, if you're in a rush, do like my friend does and make this a great place for take-out."}
{"text":"Said they were open until 8:00pm on Sundays (also said in their door hour chart). Showed up at 6:45pm to locked doors even though there were people eating inside. Hostess gave us blank stares through the window. Won't waste time trying then again."}
{"text":"This is our favourite Vietnamese restaurant in Calgary.  We have tried others, but always return to Pho 501.  The food is never overcooked and always fresh.  Friendly staff and great prices."}
{"text":"We've been in twice, once last year and again a couple of weeks ago. I found the food this latest visit to be tasteless, bland and boring. I'll give it a miss from now on and search for other places with more flavor."}
{"text":"Ordered takeaway for 5ppl. They do delivery which is exactly what we wanted on a very cold Sunday. The lady taking our order told us it would be faster if we picked up but we were happy to wait. Delivery took about 30min.   Ordered beef skewers which were tender and tasty. Beef salad rolls which had 3per portion. 2x Rice vermicelli with pork + shrimp and springrolls - shrimp was very bland but pork was tasty. Fried rice with pork sausage + egg + chicken - pretty tasty and would order again. More than enough for the 5 of us and came to $100 with beverages for all. Pretty good deal for $20 each.   Not my favourite Vietnamese in the city but good for the takeaway we needed."}
{"text":"Stopped here because we were nearby. Thought why not! It was empty no one except us. Boyfriend asked waitress's what she recommended based on two choices- She's like, \"I don't know\". Alright! I ordered vermicelli noodles with beef & spring rolls but no sauce! What gives? Boyfriend loves his broth at least. I think well continue searching for a better Pho place."}
{"text":"Really good soup with fresh bean sprouts and lots of hot sauce. We have tried other pho places but the broth here is the best so this is where we come. They have rice noodles which is good for minimizing wheat. highly recommended"}
{"text":"Came on a Saturday night and it was pretty quiet.  There weren't a lot of other people in the restaurant.  We were seated right away and got a booth by the window.    The restaurant was clean and nicely decorated.  Nothing too fancy.  Looked it might have been recently renovated.  We ordered #18 and #38 - beef, tendon, tripe, brisket and rare beef, essentially the same except #38 was with satay.    Good portions of meat and noodles. Broth wasn't too salty and the satay had a nice kick and left a decent tingle in the mouth after. The table had all the sauces you need:  hoisin, chili oil, fish sauce, soy sauce, and hot chili sauce. Enjoyed the food here.  The meat was good quality and there was proportionate meat to noodle ratio.  I would eat here again.  It is just a bit on the pricey side, hence the 3 star rating."}
{"text":"This is probably the best Vietnamese place in town. Great food ! You've got to try the Curry chicken"}
{"text":"Pho 501 is one of the best  Vietnamese Restaurant in Calgary,soup is delicious. I. Like the most is fast service highly recommend !"}
{"text":"Having eaten at Pho 501 a total of three times now, I believe I have a fair opinion when it comes to the quality, service, and the vibe. This Vietnamese restaurant is located at the corner of Edmonton Trail and McKnight Boulevard, placed beside a Pizza 73.   The inside is cozy and inviting, with several big booths for groups, as well as some 4 person tables. On each occasion, the hostess and servers were kind and accommodating. The food did not take long to come out, but enough to tell it was fresh. The place was pretty dead each time I went - no doubt the location plays a big part of that, as it's a little off the beaten path.   Let's get to some delicious Vietnamese food! Starting with appetizers, the Shrimp & Beef Skewers were tasty and a delight! These tender bites are one of the best skewer appies I've had in years - plenty of flavour here! On another occasion, I opted for the Wonton Soup, which surprisingly - don't get me wrong, Vietnamese restaurants do their thing well, but rarely branch out to other cuisines - was very good, with what seemed like house-made wontons and a salty but balanced broth.   For the mains, I need to get one point across - this is some of the best pho in Calgary! The cuts of beef came out perfectly raw and still a little thicker cut, rather than the flat, tasteless strips most places dish out. The broth was heavenly! The server was kind enough to ask if I wanted anything extra, such as more cilantro or limes, thus I need to give it A+ for service! Not quite hitting the mark of the pho was the Pork & Spring Rolls on Vermicelli. The noodles were very dry and sticky, the pork shreddings were a little too crispy for my taste, and the spring rolls had a distinct fatty residue that I have had at other Vietnamese restaurants and haven't particularly enjoyed. Stick to the soups here!  On the last occasion, my girlfriend and I had the pleasure of sharing a dessert - fried bananas in a phyllo-like pastry, almost like spring rolls but with bananas inside. We were so full, but it was delicious and I've been meaning to try replicating this one at home.  To wrap it up, there are few places in town that do pho quite like Pho 501. If you happen to be in this Northeast Calgary neighbourhood or on your way up Deerfoot, this restaurant is certainly worth a stop."}
