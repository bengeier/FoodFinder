{"text":"I ordered delivery for my order. I ordered Chicken Satay, Drunken Noodle w/chicken, Fried Tofu w/mushrooms, and the Crispy Duck Dinner.   The food smelled amazing when it was delivered, and this was my first time trying Thai BBQ. Sadly, it was a mixed bag when it came too living up to the smell.   If by Crispy Duck they mean over cooked, with the only flavor being one of stale or mishandled meat. I could not eat the duck at all.   Chicken Satay is usually one of my favorite Thai dishes, but this chicken somehow managed to be both tough and undercooked. Not sure how they managed that.   The saving graces for Thai BBQ were the Drunken Noodle w/chicken, which was delicious and flavorful, as was the Fried Tofu w/mushrooms.   If I ever order from Thai BBQ again, I think I'll stick to the BBQ chicken everyone raves about, and the dishes I just mentioned. No more expensive experimentation for me."}
{"text":"The other day I came here to get a papaya salad. I knew nothing about it but people say it's good. I asked for one without the shrimp stuff in it but when I got it there was clearly some sort of fish sauce in it. Can you please tell me what exactly it was because I had an allergic reaction to it. I'm not going to blame the business for anything I just need to know because I've never been allergic to anything. I don't eat seafood but I'm pretty sure they put a fish sauce/paste in the curry and nothing has happened. I think I'll stick to the chicken sate with cucumber salad, my favorite!"}
{"text":"Ordered for pick up 20 mins before I got there and the food was not ready. When I finally paid my food wasn't ready for another 30 mins. Worst service by far. I come to this place numerous times. But now, not sure if I'll come back again."}
{"text":"Cheap & Delicious!!! This is place was recommended to us by my bf's co worker who stumbled upon this place on his visit to Vegas. On one of our trip to Vegas last year, we decided to give it a try and see if he's coworker's review lives up to our expectation.   Our first impression was ok, there are ppl inside, mostly Filipino nurses. We both ordered Thai Tea, which tasted the same from other Thai restaurants we've been too. Except for the Thai Tea we had @ Thailand.   Michael, ordered their special house chicken over rice and like always, I ordered pad thai.   Our orders came and they looked good, which was a good sign to us. First bit, we were fans and can't wait to come back for more.  Bf's chicken was flavorful and moist. He didn't even need to use the sauce that came with his rice plate.  As for my pad thai, it was good also and it wasn't dry nor sweet. It was the right amount of flavor.   Before we left to come back home, we made sure to return here again and enjoy the flavor of their good food.   I can't wait to go back to Vegas and return here."}
{"text":"Service was poor. Food arrived slowly. Food wasn't bad, but very mediocre and boring. Don't waste your time or money."}
{"text":"I never have had Thai before, the food was very good.  Also had beer I had never tried before.  Service was good and prompt."}
{"text":"I think this one is the best out of the other 3 locations. I started going when they opened in downtown; and felt in love with the Honey BBQ chicken. Since then I follow them wherever they go :)"}
{"text":"NEVER COMING BACK! They added gratuity to a bill for just me and my mom (party of two, not legal) and were completely rude when we asked about it. It's not like we do not tip well we were just questioning the extra charge. Not worth it for mediocre cooked food and a terrible excuse for \"service\""}
{"text":"Highly disappointed! it's always a plea to obtain more hot sauce, if your client is requesting more and willing to pay \"please provide\"."}
{"text":"I have been coming to this place for a long time. It is down the street from where I work. Sometimes I stop in the evenings to pick something up to eat just for myself before I start my night shift at the hospital or sometimes I will order more if we are having a potluck at work. My favorite is the Pad Thai noodles, either the combo or the shrimp. Their chicken satay with peanut sauce is very good and so are their spring rolls. The other night I stopped in to order food for a potluck to bring into work and I got there early so I decided to have dinner there before starting my 12 hour shift. They are so nice and the food is great. I should really try other things they have on the menu. This place is great!"}
{"text":"Ordered online as soon as the place opened. Estaminated time was about an hour. Past an hour and food was still not delivered. Stated that person  is busy with 5 deliveries and keep saying will be there in 5-10minutes. Finally called and person was on Sahara and Las Vegas Blvd. Wouldn't it make sense to deliver order that was closest to the restaurant? Better off just picking it up."}
{"text":"Absoloutly has to be the most disgusting restaraunt in Las Vegas, Nevada.This place smells like vomit.The air conditioning vents are ooozing a black fuzzy grease. The tables are really sticky and greasy. The floors have not seen a vacuum cleaner ever. The place is soooooo dirty.Went into the restroom and was horrified at the way they keep it. The toilets have a black residue all over the bowl. Mold is growing on the bases of the toilets and sinks.The mirrors are in disarray. The smell of feces and urine is overpowering.The reviews are correct.Absoloutly filthy! I haven\"t even got to  the kitchen yet. The owner needs to shame the employees for exposing the public to this cesspool of an establishment. OMG!"}
{"text":"Wanton Soup was ok but the fried rice was disappointing. The fried rice tasted and looked like traditional Mexican red rice, did not taste like Thai rice at all."}
{"text":"THIS PLACE HAS AUTOMATIC GRATUITY.  So they provide you with bad service because they know they get the automatic tip.  Don't tip them again.  Also, they don't listen or understand you.  We had a party of 7 and asked to split the check in 2. They charged our half with an order that came from the other half of the party because apparently \"they (the employees) forgot to put that order in their receipt.\" and it was too late because that half of the party had left.  who's fault is that..?  we noticed that we were also being charged more than what the menu said.  it was a lunch special (less than $8) but we were being charged $14+ each.  how the hell does that happen.  some of us were sharing plates too and it didn't make any sense that we were charged more.  This place sucks."}
{"text":"No good! Co-workers and I ordered here for delivery once. The online menu was lacking details about the dishes so we had a lot of questions when calling. They were late delivering and came half way through our staff meeting. I had the duck something or other and it was basically deep fried to a total crisp. I highly don't recommend this place. Fortunately, the price was pretty reasonable (and I brought a back-up lunch)."}
{"text":"Food is okay, not great, they add too much tip to the bill without letting you know, their service does not merit the amount they add to the bill, the tip should be earned and not demanded in a sneaky way, when I confronted the waitress about the tip and the service, she said my table was being charged tip for six adults, which wasn't true, my table had three adults only and three kids., Never will return to this restaurant."}
{"text":"We always order the barbecue chicken dinner and beef satay dinner. Food is good and flavorful. Portions are large enough to share with 2 people. Service has always been nice too."}
{"text":"I have been going to this place since I moved to Vegas five years ago. However, I have been a eating of Thai Original BBQ since before I could eat solid food on my own.   I absolutely love this place! They have several locations in California as well as this location and each place is consistent in their preparation of the food. The atmosphere is very calm and soothing. It is not ever too busy, the service is great, and it is great for group outings. When you decided to stop by this place, make sure you grab some of my favorite and most delicious items on the menu.   First, I would recommend the Tom Yum Goong (Spicy Shrimp Soup). It is a warm, citrus based, and soothing serving of soup. It does not have any cream, it's more of a shrimp broth, so it's not as heavy as their coconut milk based soups.   For the main dishes, I would choose S1 BBQ Chicken or S8 Chicken or Beef Satay (chicken or beef shish kabobs). The BBQ chicken is moist with a lightly crisped skin coated in a sweet honey sauce served with their shrimp fried rice. I believe the rice is cooked with cocunut milk instead of water and adds a creamy, slightly sweet flavor to it. The S8 is your choice of chicken or beek sticks. I personally get the beef sticks. They are a little crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside. They also have a slightly sweet taste , possibly marinated in coconut milk, and this dish is also served with their delicious fried rice. This dish comes with a pint size cucumber salad and an amazing peanut sauce.  As far as drinks go, I would stick with their Thai Tea. Thai Tea here is sweet and creamy. If you have never tried it, I would definitely recommend theirs. It tastes like an iced tea latte."}
{"text":"We ordered from Thai Original BBQ due to our usual Thai place being closed for renovations and I must say, it was a welcome change. We might have to switch to this place."}
{"text":"Delicious, substantial and reasonably priced food.  Drunken Noodle was sufficiently spicy, the Chicken Sata skewers with flavored rice was sweet as was the Thai Iced Tea.  We went at 3:45 in the afternoon so, yeah it was empty but the server was helpful and friendly."}
{"text":"Always a must when we visit Vegas ! It use to be all you can drink Thai Tea, but besides that great food!"}
{"text":"Nice place... Good food... Food is fairly priced for the portions.    Love the tofu pad thai"}
{"text":"I've been a customer of this place for a while now. Whenever mom don't cook dinner, i run to this place and get myself some beef satè. I barely eat in here, i always order my food to-go. I don't know, i feel like the chairs and tables are so close from each other, i really don't enjoy the ambiance, but other than that, the food is great. One more thing, they offer free delivery, but for some reason, whenever i try ordering my food over the phone, they don't deliver at my place, considering i only live around downtown (which is about 3-4 miles away only)."}
{"text":"Food wasn't that great!  Since I had ordered noodle soup, I asked for a little bit of bean sprout and they had to charge me $1 for just a tiny bit!!! How cheap and no customer service.  And they don't carry soup spoons...big problems when this is an Asian restaurant....All the noodle soup place have soup spoons...tsk tsk tsk!!!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! I hardly ever come to this area so I don't get to come here often but when I do it never disappoints! I always get the garlic shrimp (add mushrooms) and a side of fried rice. Everything is delicious, great service, and I always have left overs. A hidden gem!"}
{"text":"I despise liars and shiesty people and after reading more reviews, apparently this is common practice for them.  Most of these complaints from people are bc of the sheisty way they add gratuity, and don't give an itemized bill unless being asked.  Being sneaky when charging for coffee refills.  It's one thing to add a gratuity, charge for refills, charge for delivery regardless of mileage, but BE UPFRONT about it.  Don't lie on the menu and say over 3 miles we charge a small fee, and when confronted:  lie and say it's close to 3 miles, but then when confronted even harder, admitting it's only 2 miles and consider 2 miles is close to 3.  I HATE sheisty people so much, that as much as I do like their food, it's enough I will not contribute to a business who has such shady business practices."}
{"text":"I'm sorry for a negative review . I literally stood in the front for more than 10 min . And had a couple of employees look at me and ignore me ??? !!!! it's ok just thought I let you know about my experience here :) no service in customer service . :/"}
{"text":"First time back in a long time back and the food is still good :)  BF and I ate the lunch specials I had the Beef Panang Curry and he had the BBQ Chicken. Both were yummy! I really liked the dressing on the salad it comes with. The lunch sizes were a good portion for $8 a plate. I'll definitely be coming back for lunch!"}
{"text":"Great food ordered some seafood fried rice.. and it was great.. would say too put more pics up so we can a nice full menu with pics"}
{"text":"I feel very sorry for those who had this place as their first experience with Thai food. Not only was the food terrible the service was awful too. I've eaten here twice and have had a bad experience each time. Why didn't I learn my lesson the first time... I am also half Thai and have grown up eating this food my entire life. I have a very strong affinity for these folks and doing a negative review was not easy."}
{"text":"My manager had the bbq chicken, fried rice & salad catered in from this restaurant & it was so good. It was a hit with the entire office & we are requesting it for our next meeting."}
{"text":"My colleagues and I order out for lunch frequently and this is one of our favorite Thai restaurants.  The Thai egg rolls are a tasty appetizer. They have a good selection of entrees as well as lunch specials if you prefer a smaller portion."}
{"text":"Food is always tip top! Ordered the panang, and it was delicious. Other dishes ordered were the pineapple fried rice and a shrimp salad. The pineapple fried rice was excellent. A bit on the greasy side, but it was good. Especially as a leftover after coming home from the strip late at night.   The shrimp salad was a bit boring. Just a few pieces of shrimp and lettuce. Nothing fantastic.   Always got to have dinner here with leftovers for the late night snack."}
{"text":"Food is good, I love Thai bbq cause I used to live in California but I went to this location. Lady that took our order seem a bit rude. I believe every customer should be treated the same. they just need to work on customer service. And they'll be a little bit more busy."}
{"text":"You walk in See the A; you wonder how? Look at the surroundings look of the staff take a bath Very authentic the staff looks like from the streets of Bangkok Dirty dirty dirty Portions very small You have to clear your own dishes because all walk by you for an hour Not recommend"}
{"text":"Not bad, not great. I work down the street from here, and come here sometimes when I forget my lunch. They do have a limited lunch menu that includes something with lettuce that is supposed to pass for salad.  They take your order, bring you food, and bring your bill. The service ends there.  The food is somewhat greasy and average. They tend to overcompensate with starches and tend not to balance flavors. In other words, if you order one rice dish, you've tasted them all, one noodle dish, one beef dish, etc.  It's also a bit pricey for the offerings. Why eat here at all, you ask.  As I said, I forgot my lunch. I have to eat something. And in this neighborhood, at least this won't kill you."}
{"text":"Not worth a visit. The employees are respectful and nice, but no personality. More like zombies walking around doing their jobs. I ordered coconut chicken soup. Should have been called mushroom soup as that's the majority in the soup. The soup itself was bland. Bland enough to not want to drink the soup but trying fishing for the bits of chicken inside. My other half ordered mint pork (his normal Thai order). He said the hotness was perfect. And the taste was awesome for him. I suppose if we did come back it would be for him only and to go. My daughter ordered beef broccoli. She liked the beef and broccoli, but the sauce has too much clam juice which made her feel she was eating more of a fish entree. The customers who come in seem to be more on the ghetto side so expect to hear loud mouth complaints. But I must say the employees took at it well but in a robot motion. Think zombies. Lol you know they were cussing the ghetto people out in the kitchen lol. Over all not a place to visit, but if you want to gamble a good visit then go ahead."}
{"text":"Yes, I agree. They do have the best BBQ chicken in town. With or without the sauce it comes it, it is still delish!   I know they usually have lunch specials but they don't have it on the weekend. Boo to that!"}
{"text":"I ordered the B.b.q chicken lunch and the chicken was very dry. This is my 2nd and probably last time ordering from this location. I use to order from the location on Flamingo when I worked over there and it was always delicious. But this location has disappointed each time."}
{"text":"been eating here for 20 years, i miss the Original location but its in crack town,  what can i say I love papaya salad, larb, tom ka kai  soup and pad thai is yummmy,  they have some delicious curry and if you want it hot hot hot theyll spice it up for ya!!!   Also the Shrimp fried rice is the bomb!!! if u dont like this place you suck at life and need to go to Panda Express"}
{"text":"Excellent Thai food that delivered! It was an early lunch and service was excellent. Can't wait to go again when I'm in town."}
{"text":"Ate here on a weekday with family. There were few groups eating, otherwise, it wasn't busy and our group of 8 was seated right away. The dining room was bright, open, and clean. There's plenty of tables to accommodate larger groups.   Service was good, everyone was polite. Ordering and receiving our food/drinks was timely, and our drinks were kept full. We were checked on regularly and empty plates were cleared.   It was president's day (a holiday), so we're unable to order from their regular lunch specialty and had to order from their regular menu.   So, I was hesitant to come here after reading several Yelp reviews, but I was pleasantly surprised. I ordered their BBQ chicken which came with some (red) fried rice. The chicken was very tender and came off the bone easily. The sweet dipping sauce it came with was a nice compliment. I didn't really taste any specific flavor from the fried rice (it was probably overpowered by everything else), but it wasn't oily or greasy at all. Some other things I tried... BBQ spareribs- also tender with a good amount of meat and nicely flavored. Phad Thai- yumMy! Subtle sweet peanut flavor with nice chewy texture. Panang curry- cuts of boneless chicken and potato in a curry soup/sauce. Good flavor and the chicken was tender.   Overall, I liked the food. Nice flavors, Nothing too overpowering or salty. Not too oily either."}
{"text":"I really like their Thai eggrolls, the Pad See Yu, Druken Chicken with rice and of course the Thai Tea (you get this free if your food is take out and $10 or more). The service is friendly enough. I usually get whatever I order to go so I can't comment on how it is to dine in. I only come periodically but everything I have had I have been satisfied with."}
{"text":"I get the ribs and spring rolls every time delivered. Delivery is quick and polite. Ribs are very tasty. Each time I order these two items I make two meals of it. Works out to abt 15 per meal including delivery tip. Pretty reasonable for good food. Ribs come with their very good, sweet bbq sauce. Spring rolls come with two good sauces for dipping. Vegas is a fun town for so many things -- feasting on great  ribs here is satisfying in a primal way."}
{"text":"My wife and I were recently looking for a good place to eat dinner around UNLV. We decided on Thai Original BBQ.  We decided to split The Monster for our appetizer. It consists of shrimp, grilled medium-rare, seasoned with lime juice and fresh chili, blended with sliced cucumber, fresh lettuce and cilantro. The shrimp was nicely cooked and it had a nice balance of flavors.  For my entree I had beef Panang Curry, a rich red coconut curry sauce with fresh green chili. I liked it quite well, but it's not the best panang curry I've ever had.  My wife had the BBQ Chicken Dinner which consists of half of their house special chicken with shrimp fried rice, served with house sauce. She really liked her dish."}
{"text":"Every time I come here I don't understand why it's not more popular. This chain is also in California, every time I've been to one I've had to wait 30 min to an hour. The food here is just as good if not better than the ones in California.  By far the best pad Thai I've ever had was at this location and the chicken isn't dry, it comes off the bone.  I recommend S-1 (BBQ chicken).  There's never a wait here and I really wish this location was more popular because I don't want it to close!"}
{"text":"The last time I went to Thai BBQ was in Carson and was before when I started using Yelp. I loved going there years ago. We opted for delivery since we were staying on the strip and didn't have a car. After we placed our order we were called minutes later that they ran out of wings of angel so we got calamari instead. 5 minutes later we were called again and were told that they ran out of crispy duck and we were mad that even on a weekday night they ran out of the items we wanted. When the food came, it was so average Thai food. The Phad Thai was so bland, it needed lime. We also specifically asked to substitute the shrimp for chicken and we still got shrimp. We had leftovers but we're not compelled it to it again for leftovers. I'd only recommend this place if you really wanted delivered Thai food."}
{"text":"Happy to find this Thai spot  in an unfamiliar (to me) part of town...but concerned when we walked in and were the only other party in there...excuse MAY have been that it was 8:30pm...but it was a Friday...  We ordered appetizers:    Stuffed Chicken wings (stuffed with a sort of pork/seafood meatball)...not my fav...too much protein in one bite for me    Chicken Satay - typical and many pieces..but just okay in flavor  Clear Noodle Salad - was good...I would have liked it spicier and with more peanuts, but I helped to finish it off.  Pork/Shrimp Egg Rolls - these were standard and again just okay.  I would order them again though, as they did the job an egg roll needs to do for me. (some meat, noodles, and cabbage...with decent dipping sauce)  I also ordered a Thai Tea and it was the best part of the meal...was high end of yummy to me...AND...the waiter brought a free refill without even asking me...I was pleasantly surprised I didn't have to pay for 2.  Our waiter was nice...although he failed to bring us the fried shrimp we ordered...but he didn't charge us either, so it was no stress and we had enough food as it was so did not bother to alert him to this fact.  Price to me is fair and food is just okay, but I would return if in the area and needed Thai food again."}
{"text":"I can't say that I'm the most versed person when it comes to Thai food. Generally speaking, I like what's known as the \"white food.\" At Thai Original BBQ I'm a big fan of their lunch specials. You get a great little side salad, then your main course for less than $9, not a bad deal.  So my staple item at this location is good ol' #1, the BBQ Chicken with Fried Rice. 90% of the time the chicken is moist, the skin has great flavor, and it's cooked to perfection. Once in a while the chicken gets a little overcooked and dry. Just a warning, if you get the food to-go, they include the salad with your warm food in the same tray. Not a fan of hot salad, nor am I a fan of salad dressing sloshing all over Thai food - it's like a bad Circus Circus buffet nightmare. So simply ask for the salad on the side. Periodically I'll go off the deep end and get the Pad Thai, which is decent, but I'm quickly reminded that nothing beats the BBQ chicken.  Definitely a good lunch stop, great prices, and quick service."}
{"text":"Tasted like the Thai BBQ at 3rd St in Los Angeles.  Great portions!  Totally loved the Curry Chicken!!!"}
{"text":"I was really hopeful with the great reviews and perhaps it was just a bad meal but rarely do I regret an entire meal, but this one I did. The chicken was not fresh, was old & very dry inside, like it sat under the heat lamps for several hours and the so-called shrimp fried rice consisted of rice with 2 pieces of shrimp on top. Overall really disappointed."}
{"text":"Had lunch with my friends and their kids on a Saturday. We called ahead and they had our table ready for our party of 14 when we arrived.  The staff was great and friendly. We got our orders, mostly all, at the same time. The food was great and we all had a great time catching up and eating Thai food!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty good. Shady, questionable side of town....but good Thai restaurant.   I got the Drunken Thai fried rice. Spicy level: 7. DELICIOUS!!!!! You get your choice of meat: chicken, pork, beef or for an additional charge, you can get shrimp. I chose beef. Besides your choice of meat, the drunken fried rice came with spicy thai basil, broccoli and carrots.   Pretty decent service and everyone in my party enjoyed their food very much. Thai BBQ is located in a deserted plaza alongside with Smiths market, a Jack in the Box and some nail salon. They have other locations here in the city. We came for dinner but they have lunch specials for like....$6-8 dollars I believe."}
{"text":"The sea food combination soup is incredibly good especially with steamed rice! I always order it for take out when I'm sick :)"}
{"text":"Food is good but don't test so fresh.  Employs are nice.  I'll go there again to try it out.  I like they downtown location better"}
{"text":"Ordered the BBQ chicken combo for delivery with beef fried rice, delicious and came on time!!"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery to room in SLS. Aside from the food being very delicious, specifically the S-1 Chicken Dinner, the customer service is amazing. SLS gave the delivery guy a hard time trying to deliver it in the room, let alone the lobby, but the delivery guy made every attempt to get to us. We eventually had to go down because the security guys are so strict about ordering outside food!"}
{"text":"If I could give negative stars I would. I've been going to this location for years. I always order the Thai tea because of the free refills. This time I decided to order a Thai tea with boba. I asked for a refill and the waitress said no that I had to order another Thai tea. So I said ok well just give me a refill on Thai tea no boba. She was stubborn and rude and insisted I order an entirely new tea in order to get the refill. What?! That's like ordering coffee with creamer and then asking for a refill on coffee but the diner denying you because you didn't order coffee black. Ridiculous! There are plently of other locations. AVOID THIS ONE!"}
{"text":"Food never really disappoints. Nothing really sticks out for me to crave this place. Nothing too special.   Ive had the Thai Beef Salad which is pretty good. The spice level at this place isn't too spicy. A level 5 is very tolerable. I don't constantly have to grab my water from the spiciness.   The Pad Thai here is kind of mediocre. The noodles were served to us over done and are stuck together, which I don't like. The flavors did go well together though.  The service is usually quick. They check on you at the right times. The food comes out at reasonable time. The restaurant is usually below freezing so bring a light sweater."}
{"text":"Hello Yelpers!  This is easily one of my favorite restaurants. Large portions of foods, for not a large amount of money. I have been coming here for over 10 years, always satisfied.   Keep in mind, it isn't the \"prettiest\" place to eat, but it sure is one of the tastiest!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I love Thai BBQ. This company is also in LA and I ate there all the time when I lived there. I came to this location in Vegas and it took 5 minutes to even be seated. We sat down and no one even came to take a drink order or food order after 15 minutes. Seriously???? You're going to keep just walking by us without saying ANYTHING? My husband, daughter and I started to walk out the door and all the lady said was \"uhhhhh, Sorry\". So unprofessional. I will never come to this location again."}
{"text":"The five stars I am giving this place is based purely on one dish. I know that's not a good way to write a review but gathering that the dish I'm writing about is basically the name of this place, I thought it'd be okay haha :) I always come here when I crave their Thai BBQ chicken that comes with this amazing sweet sauce and shrimp fried rice. I can't seem to make myself try anything else! I crave this all the time and it doesn't matter whether I to-go it or sit down there and eat it, it's always been amazing. Haha I've been to three of  their locations & this one by far has bigger portions & better flavor!!! This place is a little quiet but that's fine with me. One of my faves!!! I come here just for the Thai BBQ chicken!!!  Must try!!"}
{"text":"This place is not a customer and baby friendly. Had an early dinner 2/7/18 around 5p and we are the only customers with a sleeping infant. The waitress wanted us to transfer on a smaller table and i explained to her that the baby is still on carseat and need a bigger space and we are the only 4 people there.. waitress trying to argue. I threatened to leave and the only reason i really stayed coz my friends w/ a baby has to catch a flight. I think the franchiser was there and same thing.. no customer service! I wont go there anymore!"}
{"text":"Good BBQ Chicken. Delivery took about 45 mins but it's okay since they told us before we placed our order. We had also had the Papaya Salad it's tart and very refreshing."}
{"text":"ZERO STAR REVIEW- I've included pictures as evidence to support my case.   Let me start by saying I love Thai food and am actually a fan of the other Thai BBQ location on 3rd Street. I usually frequent Komol or Lotus 3 times a week, but I was feeling adventurous this day and gave my boss the choice.   Thai Original BBQ  2680 S. Maryland Pkwy.  Las Vegas, NV 89109   (Insert Law and Order music here)   We walk in and the restaurant is empty minus one patron in the corner. We smile at each other. I scope out her plate and to not seem like an obvious food whore my eyes slowly move up the wall above her head to the vent. All I could think of was The Ring when the black stuff starts growing on the wall and than it's a girl's hair and it's really scary.... Judge for yourself.   We will call this Exhibit A or Black Wall Fuzz   http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/QjfCmeznfZC9BPowyO4Npw?select=WsYkefA8OJ9QMtn5lFvlUA   This vent was right above the lady eating...Ewww. The picture doesn't begin to describe the amount of blackness there was. It was on a third of the wall Then the drinks came. I have water and my boss goes with Diet Coke....or so we thought.   Exhibit B- Hell No It's Not Diet   http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/QjfCmeznfZC9BPowyO4Npw?select=H09ukpD5Su2eo-XxaPZWiQ   What is that white residue? Did I mention my boss almost spit this Not Diet Coke in my face? She was scared to try another beverage after that first sip. Smart girl.   On to the food. My boss ordered a beautiful Teriyaki Chicken plate complete with broccoli and a giant's fist of white rice. Delicious. I ordered the Panang Beef no giant's fist of anything. What I received was questionable to say the least. It was Panang FAT and resembled anything, but beef. Seriously.   Exhibit C- WTF?   http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/QjfCmeznfZC9BPowyO4Npw?select=z3-nTlE-I55-UnS6pbjInw   That's the good picture! At this point I'm thinking it might be edible. NOT. Look closer now.   Exhibits D and E- More WTF!   http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/QjfCmeznfZC9BPowyO4Npw?select=1M1JtbrYEKQEUtV8k1Cx_w    http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/QjfCmeznfZC9BPowyO4Npw?select=QtPrV6P7cA8Kk0S3SNVAhw   Where's the beef????? Panang Fat and a fecking giant's fist of rice!!!! Not once did our server not come back to check on us when he dropped off the check and noticed my dissected meal laid out on my place mat he didn't even say a word. Figures.   Here's the best part. It was a Wednesday and all I kept thinking was the Health Department should shut this place down. As we are leaving I start looking for the Rating that by law is suppose to be posted in an obvious spot. WRONG. It was conspicuously hidden behind the tinted glass at the very bottom left of the door!   FML!   http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/QjfCmeznfZC9BPowyO4Npw?select=-A32_f6Jgpw4jdLpp0c4hw   40 mutha effin demerits.    I rest my case."}
{"text":"I wonder what the best words are for a place that has the most succulently juicy fall-off-the-bone BBQ chicken ever? How about fuck yeah! This fat boy would never steer anyone in the wrong direction when it comes to tasty vittles.   For me their chicken is crazy delicious and that sauce, oh that sauce, sweet, delicate with just a slight sourness really compliments the little burnt bits on the chicken. What's funny is that the chicken doesn't taste Asian to me but simply tastes like yummy BBQ chicken. The shrimp fried rice that comes with the dinner portion is moist, shrimpy and compliments the sweet and smokey chicken.   With sauce dripping from my chin and my fingers covered in sticky BBQ madness I couldn't help but think that BBQ chicken doesn't get much better than this. It's the thing to order."}
{"text":"Three and a half, but rounding up. Here's why:  Way way back in the day, this place was my first ever Thai restaurant experience and the gateway to my Thai cuisine craving taste buds. Although the location leaves much to be desired, the food has remained pretty solid overall. I still believe they have one of the best yellow curries -- creamier consistency plus they serve it with ACTUAL chicken portions (not the rubbery pieces some places use). In their pad see ewe the chicken is smoked, which gives it a slight bbq taste, different than most. Food is served hot and promptly. Pricing is average. Service depends on waiter/waitress. We've never had the auto gratuity attached to our bill.   My only gripe is that through the years, this restaurant has never really attempted to renovate much. The bathrooms are a prime example. Every time I use the ladies room, I feel like I'm in a scary movie. It's dark and dingy, sometimes dirty. It's concerning to think that both customers and the employees use the same facilities.   Side note: Their thai tea used to be served in a bigger glass, but they do allow you ONE refill now."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for probably 5 years or so and each time I come to Vegas I have to eat here. I try 1 buffet and 1 time at Aloha Kitchen and 1 time here. The rest of my eating habits are out and about wherever, but those 3 are musts.   I come here because it's never packed the food is good, they used to do free refills on thai iced tea, but now it's a 1 refill limit. The fried tofu is cubed perfectly bite sized and thoroughly fried, the sauce very good. The calamari sauce seems like it's just honey, but the strips are large and not chewy for something that large. I would like the tofu sauce and usually get a 2nd.   S-8 half/half and the pad se eew. The rice is fluffy and consistent, not sticky or clumping. Nice bright flavor, not over infused like Spanish rice or red rice. The cucumber, pepper slaw could be much larger, but the shrimp are percetly done and the trick to the S8 is to de-skewer before eating. The peanut sauce could be thicker, but next time I'll ask for a fried egg. I love egg yolk in my rice, heck if they could I'd get a poached egg on there. Pad Se Eew chicken is more flavorful as a dish than with the beef. The beef is overpowering. I have tried a few other things on the menu, but when your party of 9 orders 9 S8's your doing something right."}
{"text":"Thai Original BBQ was quite the hole in the wall find.  Located right off Maryland Pkwy and Karen, I was a little skeptical given the location, but the food was actually ver tasty.  One thing about when I go to eat, is that I drink my water unreasonably fast. If my cup stays empty, I usually don't hold it against my server, because I'm seriously a fish. However this place kept my water cup full the entire meal, and for me that's a HUGE +. Their menu is broken down into:  Appetizers/Curry Rice dishes Family style \"ala-carte\" Noodle Dishes  We dined with 7 people, and our food came out very quickly. I had the S-8, which is the Beef skewers with house sauce and shrimp fried rice. It was very tasty. Friend had the same thing with Chicken and cleared his plate as well.  Definitely a hole in the wall, so you won't find much in the decor our personality department, but the food is great, and for me, that's more than enough."}
{"text":"Always up for a new place, my wife and stepdaughter wanted to give this a go on a recent trip to the airport.  Ever get that feeling when you walk into an empty restaurant and you know you should just turn around and leave? This is that kind of place. From the decor, sparsely populated fish tanks, plastic foam holding up the fake tree, messy desk area and on top of all that they seat us (almost empty by the way) right where the server goes for water, utensils and all that.  What we ordered :  Read the rest of the review here and others:  http://chefboyd.com/2012/11/25/thai-original-bbq/"}
{"text":"We ordered the Sate bbq Chicken-beef (S-8) and BBQ pork (S-2). Service was slow but the food was pretty good.  Will come back."}
{"text":"The restaurant was super empty, which, to me, says a lot.  I ordered Pad Thai (I always order Pad Thai, no matter which Thai restaurant we're eating at) and I found it to be pretty bland and not spicy at all.  I thought Thai food is supposed to have some spice in it?  Anyway, the waitress never asked if I wanted it spicy, so I just assumed it will be spicy in the end.  I guess that's my fault.  But my fiance ordered BBQ chicken on skewers and it was bland as well.  Needless to say, I've had much better Thai food.  It's safe to say we won't be coming back.  On the upside of things, the service here is good, the workers are friendly."}
{"text":"We were driving up Maryland Pkwy looking for a Thai place and bumped into this place. Absolutely loved it! Ordered some Pad See Yew and BBQ Ribs nice portions size plates and the price is not bad at all. We are definitely coming back and there is no charge for refills on Thai Tea."}
{"text":"First the good points. Portions are large. The rice is as sweet and delicious as I remembered from the Los Angeles locations. This particular location had poor service. The staff was rude, including the waiter. He didn't even make eye contact. Wait, he didn't actually speak to me. He looked at me expectantly when I ordered. He dropped the food off without a word. Never checked was my food ok or gave refills. There was a boisterous group a few tables back who used the n word so freely that I assumed there were Blacks in their party. I was surprised to see when I got up to pay there was not a one. And the cashier-- she has to finish her phone conversation which may have been taking an order for delivery. I always feel staff should attend to the paying customer in front of them and then to their phone customers. That may just be me. Even though I missed this place dearly as I lived in the South for a while, I will NOT be going back."}
{"text":"moving from southern california, i want to love this place so badly as it would be a little  slice of home :( regardless of how many chance i give them, they never cease to fail   -1 : environment, every time i come here the restaurant is full of a disgusting odor. whether it be the smell of old food or strong bleach. can somebody fix their vents?!  -1 : food quality, i'm a huge fan of the S-8 combo and every time i order it the beef skewers are either extremely undercooked or extremely overcooked and rubbery. also, why are my orange garnishes always bitter and old tasting? how can someone serve a bad orange garnish?!  -1 : back of the house cooks, i simply asked for extra crab in my seafood fried rice. they can't do it. i simply asked for some pineapples in my friend rice, they can't do it. do they not understand that this is an opportunity to make more money off of me?"}
{"text":"Saw the cook dropping a deuce and slow jerking it in the restroom. Then sat and waited for him to come out... He was zipping up his pants underneath his apron... Which means he didn't wash his hands... After taking a dump...wiping.. and masturbating.  So Yea, we walked right the fudge out."}
{"text":"$9.95 for three pieces of BBQ chicken and fried rice. Filling and I brought home a lot of leftovers. I would have gave them a 5 but my rice was lacking that Thai fried rice taste.. It was a little bland this time. Otherwise, I always go home with a happy tummy"}
{"text":"This place is classic to me. I think they have a lot going for them and were at one time the standard of Thai food in Vegas. They have good service, a big menu, good food, and is affordable. They have all of the classic Thai dishes: the stir fries, the salads, the curries, and the soups. They do all of these dishes well. My favorite things to get are the curries and the BBQ.  Their name sake, Thai BBQ chicken, is delicious. I've been eating it since I was younger. It is a half chicken served with shrimp fried rice and sweet chili sauce. The chicken is marinated well and grilled. The downfall of the dish is the shrimp fried rice. I wouldn't even call it fried rice. It's similar to a Spanish rice but more sweet that is topped with shrimp. The portion of this dish is generous and can easily feed two. The most recent time I went one of my chicken pieces was ridiculously charred.   They have a great lunch special and are centrally located."}
{"text":"My go-to Thai place in Vegas! I'm surprised this restaurant has so many bad reviews because they never let me down!  Service is surprisingly decent. The only thing is that it takes SO long to get the food out as well as to get a refill on water. Otherwise, everything goes pretty smoothly.   Food-wise, I am completely satisfied with the quality and quantity. My favorites include: -Fresh Summer Rolls: I prefer to get it with no mint and even then, it's still so refreshing! The dipping sauce is great and you get a good amount of shrimp and meat.  -Thai BBQ Spare Ribs: fall off the bone great -Shrimp Fried Rice: can literally eat this on its own! Very sweet and moist  -Pad Thai: hits the spot with great consistency with the texture of the noodles and the its flavor  The portions are all HUGE. Personally I would think that it's more family style versus for one person to eat so it's perfect for sharing. What I like most about all the dishes is that they're all simple but so flavorful!   Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Place is drat awful!! This place was disgusting! I ordered the chicken pad Thai, and it tasted like noodles with ketchup!! Awful! On top of that, the service was atrocious! I do not recomend eating here!"}
{"text":"Ordered here while in Vegas and tried the 2 entrees to split with a friend.  We ordered the BBQ Chicken with Jasmine rice and a curry dish.  They both came out pretty fast. The BBQ Chicken was tasty. It's hard to mess up rice and I am glad they did not.   Total ticket with drinks and tip came right under $30. Not too far off the strip if you want some decent Thai food at a fair price."}
{"text":"The service is soo slow, a pet peeve of mine on a weekday lunch hour. Lunch time servers need to be on their best because business people need to be in and out of restaurants to get back to work. A party of 10 took an hour and 45 minutes... that is too long for people needing to be in court and in front of a judge.  Food was good, but they carry Pepsi Products not Coke... just in case it matters, I asked if they had Coca-Cola and waitress said yes, served it to me and surprise it was not Coca-cola, it was pepsi.  Probably try it again."}
{"text":"I always come back for this place. The recipes are made perfect for my liking. My favorites are the chicken satay & the Hawaiian curry"}
{"text":"When I miss LA Thai food this is where I go. Yes it isn't the best but it does the job. Lunch specials or very good"}
{"text":"This place reminded me of why I miss having thai food (my husband just loves chinese food so much, but I really didn't want that this time). The 1st house special on the menu- BBQ chicken plate, served with sweet sauce came with shrimp fried rice for $8.99- is a steal. This is what the both of us ordered. I've been coming to these restaurants for years (my favorite one was the one on Flamingo/Jones). So, when we were unsure of what to have on saturday night for dinner, I suggested this place (it'd been quite some time since our last visit). Yeah, we were supposed to go to the Vegas Streats festival, but my husband doesn't like large crowds with limited parking, so we had to switch gears (will just have to catch the slider truck some other time). Also, there are quite a few Thai restaurants in the area (Commercial Center) but the prices are a tad higher there.    This restaurant is pretty close to our home, in the Smith's shopping center, on the opposite corner facing Maryland Parkway. The place was pretty empty; there was another party there besides us. The server was a little preoccupied in deep conversation with another patron (had to be a regular). The cashier brought us our menus. We were waiting for a few minutes, and my husband was starting to get annoyed with lack of service. The football games were on tv. I noticed that all three cooks sat down and took a break. Another party entered the restaurant. I liked the two large aquariums giving the diners some privacy and some separation (adding ambiance), in the restaurant. Seating was mostly tables and chairs, and some booths along the wall.   Back to the food; dinner came pretty fast. The amount of food for $8.95 was pretty impressive (didn't finish my rice, the two shrimp were pretty big, not the small salad shrimp size, and the BBQ chicken was tasty, especially with the sweet sauce). My husband dug in, using his fingers, but I didn't want to get messy, so I used my fork and knife. It was really good, but I thought that some of my chicken was at the point of just being overdone. My husband really enjoyed his meal, so I didn't tell him about some of my chicken, because I didn't want to ruin it for him. I should mention that the service got better as we were eating- we were checked on several times and the server came around to refill drinks.   So, why the 4 stars? Well, I've always been a fan for years now, so I am basing it on all my collective experiences as well, plus the house special is just a really excellent value overall. I'm sure we will be visiting again soon."}
{"text":"This is a restaurant that is close to our office, decently priced for good food and offers 1 free refill on Thai Tea!!  We come here so often that the staff already knows what we're going to order before we're even seated, same goes for when we order over the phone! Staff is friendly. Food is full of flavor. Yea, we're here once a week ;)"}
{"text":"Not everything is five stars, but the dishes they are known for consistently hit the spot every time! Delivery Service is fast and extremely courteous! My order is always fresh, accurate and delicious!   A great alternative to pizza delivery!"}
{"text":"This location was not as good as the now defunct location on 3rd Street. I didn't enjoy the ambiance, and the curry was not quite as tasty as I had remembered at the other location. Service was also sluggish and indifferent on Maryland. But, still worth checking out."}
{"text":"Ordered from here earlier in the summer near the end of May as to go food while getting a tattoo done. Food was great, BUT I basically lived in the bathroom for 3-4 days after because of food poisoning I assume. What hoes in tasty didn't come out the other end nicely. Can't say ill ever eat here again."}
{"text":"I'm a huge Thai food critic, because personally no one will ever top my own other but It doesn't hurt trying to find places close to moms home cooking. At least this place will always be my go to spot for fried rice.   Food: 3/5 To be honest their Thai food is okay for a chain restaurant. You don't find that too often. Usually when restaurants become chains they loose quality. This place has awesome fried rice, when you order a dinner entree of Satay beef it comes with a side of fried rice, appetizer cucumbers in rice vinegar, and peanut sauce. Super delicious rice, the satay is a little on the sweet side for me and sometimes a little over cooked. Guess it depends who's working but the fried rice is always on point. My recent go I order the \"kha tew\" which is like the Authentic Ramen or Pho of Thai people. Super delicious Not sure if they knew what I was attempting to order because the waitress (that was also Thai) had no idea what I was order nor describing even though I said it in Thai and she understood me perfectly. Well somehow they threw something together and it tasted decent, I would've loved more meat balls but hey couldn't complain. My table also order the lab pork, which is like spicy grounded pork with lettuce wraps. Honestly these were delicious. I was very surprised how close it came to my own mothers.   Price: 4/5 3 entree's, 1 appetizer, 2 beers, and 2 wines. Not sure what the bill was but each entree was about $8.95 and you got a good amount too. So I would say the value was there. But from a past frequent diner there prices have gone up, and the quality of food has come down.   Atmosphere: 2/5 People who love to come here, trust me don't come for the atmosphere. This place needs some serious updating. Once you walk in you feel like your in an old Chinese restaurant. With cracked leather booths, and a fish tank. This place doesn't even look like a Thai restaurant."}
{"text":"so clean here! can't believe i ate at the jones location! I'll yelp more later... yelling live from Thai BBQ!"}
{"text":"I was shocked when I ate here. This location did not live up to the quality Thai Original BBQ that I enjoyed since I was a child living in the slums of Los Angeles. What seemed like a evening to relive a childhood experience turned into a big disappointment.  I ordered the usual, the S-2 (ribs), and daydreamed about the mouth watering goodness that was about to come. Once my S-2 arrived, I took a carnivorous bite off my rib and scooped a spoonful of rice in my mouth. The verdict - mediocre. Although the ribs were cooked to perfection, the ribs tasted funny and the rice was extremely dry. Even the sauce on the side couldn't save this poor soul. While I can't complain about the service, I wish I could have asked my waiter, \"Was the chef having a bad day?\" No doggie bag for me, thank you very much."}
{"text":"Food is actually good but just don't ask for tum yum soup ( shrimp soup) because they will only put 2 shrimps in a big soup.   I told the waiter thinking it was a mistake and he actually confirmed only 2 come in the sharing size soup.  Badddd"}
{"text":"Had a craving for Thai food.  Ate here today and I was very disappointed.  We ordered chicken curry, garlic chicken and asparagus stir fry.  When they brought out the chicken curry, it was not even warm.  Asked for them to reheat, but it still wasn't hot enough.  Will not eat here again."}
{"text":"This place is underestimated. Some of the best prices and the portions justify any bill. I always get the Thai BBQ chicken dinner here because no other Thai restaurant in Vegas has Thai BBQ chicken like theirs. Any curry here is pretty bomb too. Will always be one of my favs in Vegas."}
{"text":"If I was basing my rating strictly on food, it would be a strong 4 stars. I ordered the shrimp coconut soup that is delicious but could use more mushrooms and a couple more shrimp, Thai tea with Boba also fantastic, and Rambutan on ice. About 20 minutes after ordering, I received a call telling me that they were out of the Rambutan. Now honestly, the only reason I ordered it was to reach the minimum order amount and though it wasn't my fault they ran out of the dessert, I decided to get a substitute to keep that minimum. I asked what my options were and chose the mango and sticky rice. When my food got here, my total bill had jumped from $18.81 to $22+. Now, I don't mind paying for what I order, but when I asked for options and got the mango, I was not told there was a price difference and I was not told a new total and honestly, when it comes to cheap things like drinks and desserts, if you run out, the sub should be the same price or you should adjust the price to be the same. I told the delivery guy to take the mango sticky rice back and he apologized. I definitely would have ordered from this place again, and if you want good Thai food, it hits the spot, but we will not be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"This is my go to Thai restaurant as it is just down the street from where I live. I usually call in my order or request delivery but when I dine in it is usually a nice casual experience. My typical order is as follows:  1.) Thom Yum Kai- Hot and Sour Lemongrass soup with chicken, cilantro and other Thai spices. This soup can clear my sinuses and helps me feel better when I am feeling sick.  2.) Beef Salad- A colorful, tangy salad that brings out the best in Thai cuisine and spices. Along with tender thinly sliced pieces of beef, this dish is a must have!  3.) Chicken Padt Thai- Made with soaked dried rice noodles, stir-fried with eggs and chopped chicken, and flavored with tamarind pulp, fish sauce, garlic or shallots, red chili pepper and palm sugar, and served with lime wedges and often chopped roast peanuts. This noodle dish is to die for and my favorite dish from this restaurant.  As a desert: Mango with Sticky rice. No words can describe how amazing the combination of sweet sticky rice and mango is. You have to experience the amazingness yourself and order it!  Service whether calling in, delivery or dine in is pretty good and fast. Not the best Thai food I've had but it is pretty decent."}
{"text":"My first time here. Hubby wanted me to try it because he loves the food.  ...and he's right. The food is incredible. The summer rolls are huge, and really yummy. I could have ordered those alone and been full.  I got the drunken noodles, spice level 6 with pork. Seasoning was perfect. Serving plentiful. Only complaint is the overabundance of bell peppers, but that's a personal preference. I hate peppers cooked with anything because they take over the flavor. Don't understand why chefs insist on putting them in otherwise amazing dishes, \"Oh, this tastes great! I think I'll add an overwhelming flavor to completely mask that.\" I picked them all out and enjoyed the broccoli, noodles, and tender pork.  Had a bite of hubby's teriyaki beef. Excellent. They weren't as generous with his portion as they were with mine, or I would have stolen more. His was a lunch special, I guess mine was a full entree.  Also had Thai iced tea with boba. Yum!  Service was pretty quick. Building is older and kind of shabby, so not a date-night venue. Kids would dig the big fish tanks.  Only other complaint is that it's positively frigid inside. Bring a sweater."}
{"text":"Came here straight from the airport from L.A. They have a few Thai Original BBQs in Los Angeles and one 5 minutes away from where I live. The food is nearly identical (from the menu and taste of the food) to the ones back in L.A. So I give it 3 stars. However, the place is run-down, old, and the customer service was really slow. There was only 1 waitress working in the entire restaurant and we had to wait a good amount of time to get our bill and ask for refills. Food is great and prices are just the same as back home."}
{"text":"Terrible. Can you take out the word Thai please and just call it \"Original BBQ\"  The most unauthentic Americanized Thai food i have ever had in my life.  If you want to try something new that is NOT Thai food, then sure, go here."}
{"text":"Good Thai food. Service is okay. Really like their Thai ice tea plus they give you a one free refill on it as well which is awesome! Everywhere else I have gone have not done that and favor their seafood soup. Drunken rice is delicious and they give you enough food to share. Prices are decent anywhere from 10 and below."}
{"text":"We used to go to Thai BBQ when we first moved to Vegas 4 years ago.  The food then was soo good - flavorful and just delicious.  We always used to take visitors here and they used to rave about it as much as did.  If i was writing this review back then, I would have easily given it 5 stars.    As for the service, we have always been treated kindly there.  The waiters are always soft spoken and very friendly.  I don't have much to say about the place itself - its not new, but its not dirty or anything.  The prices were also reasonable for what you get.  (And here's the but....) -  But the past couple times we've been, the food quality has changed.  We always get the same thing - the beef satay dinner and pad thai.  Last couple times we went, the meat was bland and missing all the flavor!  It didn't taste like they marinated it at all!  The shrimp in the fried rice was undercooked - we had to send it back.  The pad thai was way too saucy for my liking - it reminded me of the instant pad thai that you can make at home.  The quality of the food has just changed.  Maybe they got a different cook - I'm not sure.  All I know is that its just not what it used to be.  Unfortunately, after two bad experiences in a row, we're going to have to skip Thai BBQ from now on."}
{"text":"Good thai food!  Taste is there, even though they do not seem to be cooking as authentic or produce as much \"heat\" when requested.  When I ask for \"thai spicy\" don't be afraid to make it hot!  They have my favorite dish here that I really haven't found anywhere else..\"drunken noodles\". Very delicious ESP with beef or pork, and can be made spicy!   It is similar to the mint chicken/beef/pork, but with noodles instead of rice.  The noodles absorb all the flavor!  The drunken pasta is also delicious, pretty much the same but with a spaghetti style noodle.  They have great lunch specials too, since they are right down from my work, we take advantage of it at least 1-2+ times a week.  And it isn't too expensive...their lunch specials are about $6-7 each and their normal entree are about $8-10 depending on what you order.  The curry catfish was also delicious!  Older building, but the food is where it is at!    I'd check them out if you are on this side of town."}
{"text":"Food is not good barbecue chicken too dry Pad Thai noodle not good waiter  lousy service  I think the owner is not the same that when I ate there last year I will never comeback to this restaurant"}
{"text":"Best BBQ chicken ever. Las Vegas is where I discovered Thai BBQ and I always try to stop here when in town."}
{"text":"I love Thai BBQ.  There was a time about a year ago that I would come here once every week or two.   The staff is great: they always remember my friend and I, and we never have to ask for soy sauce and cups anymore (what we prefer to have with our egg rolls)  The place itself is clean.  Its a little older looking, but the tables have always been clean, and the bathroom is clean too.   The food is wonderful.  I haven't tried anything here that I haven't liked.   The Masaman and Panang curries are spicy and good.  The Vegetable curry is awesome!  The Hawaiian curry has changed my outlook on pineapple (I used to hate it).  The garlic chicken or beef is very flavorful.  The eggrolls are perfect every time.  My favorite thing to get here, though, is the shrimp wonton soup.  Shrimp, both alone, and wrapped in a wonton served in a delightful, fragrant broth with bok choy and simple spices...this soup is wonderful, and even when I have a cold and my tastebuds are out of whack, this soup is comforting and flavorful.  I love coming here.  I recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"Great Food as always.........wait staff was fantastic and treated us like we were family!!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome food and service! Price is decent too, not too bad for Thai food. I come here once or twice a month, usually with my family and friends. My favorite there is the beef sate dinner. The only thing I wished they have is unlimited Thai iced tea, I love that! Other then that, if you guys are looking for a good Thai food place to go to, this is the place to bring your family and friends! You'll love it."}
{"text":"im updating this to a four star. Why? because after several more attempts in ordering thai take-out i find myself going back here. I guess the large serving I pay for the price is actually worth it. Hahaha.  I do enjoy the food & they do have one of my favorite thai tea & they have free refills on it, too! score!"}
{"text":"Your Yelp says you are open until 10pm yet I call at 9:35 and you say you are closed and only available for pickup. When I asked the man who answered the phone why the Yelp says 10pm, he literally hung up on me. Wow. So glad we drove over here."}
{"text":"This place has very poor service. The food is swimming in grease. Only order the fried rice if you want to have a heart attack. They don't give you a bill on your table, they tell you to pay at the register. Then they just give you a price. I told him I want a itemized receipt and when he printed it out in small print they added gratuity for themselves for a party of three. What a joke we are never coming back here again. They also tried to charge us for coffee refills. Don't trust this greasy ass disgusting restaurant."}
{"text":"I'm surprised this place only has 3 stars. Sure, the restaurant doesn't look fancy or pretty, but it's simple and clean, and the aquariums that divide the tables are a nice touch. The staff is nice and attentive, and the service is quick. They have great food, great portion for great prices. So for me, this restaurant deserves 4 stars. Plus, their BBQ CHICKEN is THE best. I used to go here regularly when I was attending UNLV, but now it's pretty rare for me to be in the area. Though there are times when I would crave their Thai BBQ chicken with their oh so sweet house sauce, so I would drive out of the way just to have some, like what happened last night! FYI, if you love their sweet house sauce as much as I do, you could actually buy a bottle for $3.99!"}
{"text":"My first stop every trip to Vegas. The location Is sketchy, but the food is worth it.    I recommend the curries as that is what have eaten.  My favorite is the Massaman with Chicken or Beef.  The yellow and panang are also very good."}
{"text":"I've always had a soft spot in my heart for Thai Original BBQ.  We know this family-owned chain from the location in Cerritos, CA, my hometown.  That place was a favorite destination for family and friends, with countless meals shared there, so I've practically grown up on their food.  When we moved to Las Vegas in the 90s, I was ecstatic to find that there were locations here, too. I've been to this location a few times as well as the one on Flamingo, but what doesn't change is the menu and the food, whether it's Southern California or Southern Nevada.  My favorites are the BBQ chicken dinner with shrimp fried rice and the sate beef dinner. Unlike other Thai restaurants, I usually only have those dishes here in keeping with the BBQ theme, instead of pad thai or other noodles.  My parents were in town for a visit recently and we ended up here, just like old times, even if it was in a different city.  Thai Original BBQ's food has moved on to the next generation; my son has grown up with it, too.  The restaurant itself is a little old, but it's all about the food and service, which has always been good for us."}
{"text":"Delicious, authentic Thai food! This hidden gem is seriously underrated. Every time we visit my Vegas family, we make sure to eat here. The taste is so savory and filled with flavor, you will be greatly satisfied w/whatever you order. We always get the beef/chicken satay, fried rice, Panang curry, and pad see ew. Never disappoints! Also, the staff is THE BEST. We made a pretty hefty to-go order (super last minute) and not only did they accommodate us, but they did it in a timely fashion. Super good & I can't say enough good things about them. Also! They have great condiments at no additional cost. Love love love them"}
{"text":"Love the summer rolls with peanut sauce and pad Thai with tofu.  We brought the food to a friend's house for potluck and everyone was asking where the food came from. We have only done take out so far but seems like a very nice place to one with the family."}
{"text":"This place is really good.  My family and I come here every time we're in Vegas.  I have been to many Thai restaurants in Los Angeles and this one is one of my favorites.  I really don't know why it has bad reviews.    I can, however, only review the dishes I have tasted.  Before I do, I just want to say that their service is very good.  They are attentive and friendly.  I think they are really striving to improve their rating.  As for the food, we had the following at least once, most twice:  Pad Thai: very tasty and good consistency of flavor and noodles Pad Kee Mao: love the taste of the basil and mint leaves (5/10 spiciness is just right) Pad See Ew:  With shrimp makes it so much better.  It has american broccoli, which is different from what I have had before, but it makes it delicious and adds to the texture. Chicken Noodles:  Light in color with a hint of sweetness.  so good! Shrimp dish (S-3):  Very generous with nice sized shrimps.  The sauce is awesome. BBQ Chicken:  No need to dip it in honey.  The chicken is tender and very tasty.  The fried rice is simple and a great compliment to the strong flavor of the chicken. Green Curry w/ Beef:  I love their curries!  Green curry is lighter on flavor compared to red and panang curry.  This dish specifically has bamboo shoots which makes it so much better.  Panang w/ Beef:  A stronger flavored curry because, like all panangs, it has peanut sauce.  The flavor is very strong but delicious.  You might have to order extra rice to compensate for the strong flavor.  It may be a bit oily for many.  It has big chunks of beef which is great but a little tough to chew.  All in all, I'm a fan of this restaurant and will continue to eat here every time we're in Vegas.  It is a great way to take a break from the ocean of buffets."}
