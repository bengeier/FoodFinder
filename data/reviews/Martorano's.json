{"text":"During a recent stay at the Rio, my girlfriend and I decided to do Martorano's for dinner.  We are vegetarians, so there were only a handful of options for us,  but enough that we felt there was at least some choice.  She had the gnocchi which was quite good,  I had the pizza which I also greatly enjoyed.  I expected a 10\" pizza as most places have for single servings... but this was a 12\" and half of it was our breakfast the next morning.  The meals were good, but the prices for the food and wine were very Vegas, and by that, I mean over priced.  We're both very snobbish when it comes to food, so while the meals were very good, they were certainly not the best we've had.  Dessert was another story.  We decided to split the tiramisu... we were not prepared for this.  Previously the best I've had was at a hole in the wall in Rome where the staff did not speak English (a requirement if I'm going to a sit-down restaurant in a city with lots of tourism).   This tiramisu was leaps and bounds better.  Perfect is an understatement.  When I return to Vegas, I'm coming back to Martornao's just for this, and you should as well."}
{"text":"I don't hand out five stars often - but in this case, I think they are warranted.  We can't say anything bad about this place.  The food is not typical Italian - it's Italian, but with a South Philadelphia flair.  Everything was very good - I don't know how much else I can say.  The tomatoes in the Caprese tasted like tomatoes.  The cheese (both Mozzarella and Ricotta) are made in house.  The meatball is to die for.  The desserts were good.  Our waiter, Ben, was as good as they come - really - his service made our experience perfect."}
{"text":"It was painful to eat here.  The music was so loud that you could not carry on a conversation.  My ears hurt by the time I left. I may have been able to overlook that if the food was somewhat palatable.    I personally am not a fan of violence so when the music was lowered to turn up the volume on the movies playing I did not enjoy watching and hearing people get beaten up.  Again I could overlook that if the food was at least good.    Never again"}
{"text":"If i could give this a 1/2 star I would, but not an option I have to give it a 1 star - so not deserved.  We went to have dinner there after my brother got married. we waited for about 45 min for a table, considering we didn't have a reservation that was ok. when we finally sit down at our table, wow we couldn't even hear the waiter ask us what we wanted to drink. Then when we finally order the time to get our food was average wait time I guess. the waiter brings out our food except for my new sister-in-laws food, she ordered her food specifically a certain way, about 10-15 min after we all had our food the waiter comes up and states there was a mishap with the first order so they had to re-do the order. when they finally bring her food out to her it was totally wrong and had ingredients that were not even asked for (allergies toa certain ingredient) that just made it worse, he then offers her a salad instead, she respectfully declined.  My aunt's food needed salt, and all they had was sea salt, with her medications she can't have sea salt, so he states let me see if there is regular salt in the kitchen, the idiot waiter grounds the sea salt and puts it into a bowl and brings it out to her and claims it's regular salt. we all looked at it and it was sea salt, had she used it she would have had an alergic reaction and would have gone into shock. Most italian restarauts i go to they always have nice music playing very low where tou can hear the person across the table talking in a regular voice, this music was on like if we were in a club, and we had to yell to the person across the table and they still couldn't hear you. this was just such a horrible experience, and will never go again.  I would not recomend this place to anyone even if it was the only place open in the casino."}
{"text":"What an excellent Italian restaurant! At first, though, you have to absorb the mixed atmosphere of a disco ball, tv screens, music and wall of glass overlooking the pool. Once you adjust to the atmosphere, you realize that the owner Steve Martorano is sharing with you his background of food and culture, and it's quite good. But the most important point here is the quality of the food. Fresh mozzarella with prosciutto- excellent. Meatball with salad- excellent. Homemade lasagna- excellent. The special \"pescatore\"- excellent. Then, of course, an Italian dinner isn't finished without a homemade ricotta stuffed cannoli and cappuccino. Also, I want to give a big shout out to Tara the restaurant director.  She answered all of our questions and her passion for the food and restaurant was obvious.   Our server was attentive and made us feel comfortable while we were eating our wonderful meal. So if you're looking for delicious tasting italian food, white tablecloths and a lively atmospere, you gotta' come here \"yo cuz!\""}
{"text":"I ate here back in June 2013, the night before I competed in a World Series of Poker tournament.  Since it was located at the Rio, it looked like a good choice.  Having been in the air for over 12 hours that day, I was looking forward to eating something not in a box.  Martorano's really piqued my interest is I am originally from Philly and so is the owner and namesake.  I've tried New York, and the Boston North End, but the Philly Italian restaurants are supreme. Will Matorano's be the same?   After a consult with my very helpful and friendly waiter, I opted for the $50 prix fixe menu, which was Caesar salad, Veal Cutlet, and dessert.  I also had to try the Meatball appetizer, the true acid test of a good Italian restaurant.  Everything I had was outstanding.  The veal was tender as butter and was seasoned perfectly.  But the meatballs were the high point of the meal.  The blend of meat and the succulent marinara sauce were exquisite.  The server filled me in on Steve \"Cuz\" Matorano.  He is a character -- like something that fell out of a Rocky movie -- but his food is the real deal.  Although I busted out of the poker tournament the next day, I still felt like a winner after eating at Martorano's."}
{"text":"This restaurant I came across after trying to get into another. It has a nice bar in the middle so sat there to dine. Bar tender was nice but talked to much so service was slow for all of us. I ordered the Cesar salad which was good. Then the veal Piccata which the Veal was good but the sauce was a little thick and sweat. They suggested the fried peppers as a side dish which was really bad and as a presentation looked the part. Also they were playing a monster movie on all the tv's that line the walls and it was a scene of a guy getting his face shot up which made eating pasta interesting. I would pass on this pace."}
{"text":"Bottom line don't go !!!  They push the over priced specials.  Will not serve plain old tap water then charge you big time for bottled water.  And the owner says don't break my balls this is the way I cook.  Well first of all your not there cooking.  I'm Italian the food has to much Garlic and to much salt. OVER PRICED OVER PRICED OVER PRICED .  My recommendation go some where else."}
{"text":"Nice view but a very far walk into Rio.  Shrimp scampish bread was great but probably is only enough for one.  Dinner was overpriced and slightly bland.  Wasn't terrible but wouldn't go back for the price."}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place!!!! The amazing food and awesome bartenders and staff you can't go wrong with stopping in here!!!! We always try different dishes and everything is amazing!!! As Vegas locals we frequent here because everyone here is so friendly and helpful!!!"}
{"text":"Let me premise this review with the following: (a) my wife and I regularly eat at fine dining establishments; and (b) we ate here on Valentine's Day.  We came to Martorano's with what we thought were realistic expectations based on the restaurant's own comments as well as others.  We knew it was going to be a loud, fun atmosphere, and we knew that the chef himself markets the restaurant with the tagline that he is not a celebrity chef, his food is \"just famous.\"  Well, the restaurant is loud.  We were surprised that for Valentine's Day at 6pm it was not crowded.  However, it was still loud.  TVs all over and music playing throughout.  Not really romantic but we expected this.  The wait staff was very pleasant.  We truly did enjoy our server.  The food, however, was only average.  We tried the meatball appetizer and while the meatball was good, it was not the self proclaimed \"best in the world.\"  For dinner my wife had the lobster and I had the fish of the day.  My wife originally wanted an item which was listed on the menu online but the waiter said they had removed it from the menu.  Her lobster, while tasty, was a half tail portion the size of her finger.  My fish was very good, but again, for the price, not worth it.  Our dessert was probably the best part.  Cheesecake was marvelous.  Fortunately for us, the waiter directed us to this.  When we were stuck between two choices, he mentioned that the cheesecake was \"100 times better\" than our other choice.  All in all, it was an average meal, but for $250 (we had wine) and on Valentine's Day, in retrospect, I would have passed.  Disappointing."}
{"text":"I had a caesar and the bucatini with meatball.... it was good. The sommelier was well informed and let us taste a couple of reds before we made our selection. It was a little loud but i loved the oldie songs being played and the oldie movies being shown on the lcd screens!"}
{"text":"The employees and manager there were complete snobs. Had a drink and left, super unpleasant experience."}
{"text":"I ate here last Saturday night.  While the food was all tasty (we cleaned our plates), I cannot say that I was amazed- I have definitely had better Italian food.  I did appreciate that you could see right into the kitchen, and they even had seats surrounding the kitchen area if your heart so desires.  This gives me a little more confidence that I am eating quality food that was not premade or thrown around in a dirty kitchen.  For me, what really killed this place was the atmosphere.  There are TV's surrounding all the tables which play scenes from famous mafia-like movies.  The restaurant blasts (I repeat, BLASTS) iconic tunes from these movies, but will occasionally put the sound clips of the movies for particularly vulgar scenes.  If the incredibly loud music/clips does not prevent you from having a conversation, the fact that you are surrounded by distracting TV's certainly will.  As a side note, please do not take children here- the restaurant has made the poor decision of  showing very violent scenes (yes- while people are eating?) and does not bleep out the curses when they play sound clips.  Not very tasteful if you ask me."}
{"text":"Frank Sinatra on the sound system, The Godfather on the TVs...  spare me, please.  I particularly enjoyed the 10 or so photos of the owner with d-list celebrities that kept scrolling on the TVs that weren't playing the Godfather.  The food was decent but the whole \"Staten Island via South Philly\" ambience pretty much ruined it."}
{"text":"I stopped by this place with my girlfriend as we wandered through Paris. The food was great but the service was phenomenal.   We had the shrimp bibsy special (shrimp with a sweet and slightly spicy caramelized coating), the chicken parmesan,  the gnocci, and dessert.  My favorite was easily the shrimp and I am definitely coming back at some point for more.   The service was top notch from start to finish.  I was surprised every time i needed something it was already there before i could even think to ask.  It was truly amazing."}
{"text":"What started out as a sub-par experience turned into a fun night.  We had reservations for 7:15, and the restaurant was absolutely packed when we arrived.  We waited about 45 minutes to an hour after our reservation time before being seated.  We actually had decided to leave because we had tickets to a show and were afraid we'd miss it.  Upon discussing the situation with the manager (or perhaps owner?), he promised to make it work.  We were assigned a manager or some type of higher-up as our waiter, and he was wonderful.  Bread with oil and vinegar was served (one of the things I miss most about Italy!) as an appetizer.  I ordered the tagliatelle alla bolognese and a red wine that the waiter suggested (which paired nicely).  Our food arrived promptly, and was flavorful and authentic.  The other two people in my party enjoyed the meal as well.  We had a great time and made it to the show.  They even gave us our meals on the house!   I deducted one star mostly because of the hostess.  She kept quoting huge parties a 20 minute wait time when it was clearly going to be over an hour.  She seemed quite inexperienced.  That aside, I would definitely go back next time I'm in town, but maybe on a night I don't have other plans."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying- if you want a quiet, candle lit dinner- this is not the place. Martorano's is the \"go-to\" place for a true Vegas experience! They have a great Vegas atmosphere- very fun and vibrant! In the middle of my dinner, a screen dropped down and played a movie scene from Austin Powers. Then a while later, there was dance music and a disco ball!   Food was AMAZING!!! I had the Veal Cutlet Martorano- I mean the guy's name is on it- of course it was freaking delicious!!! I also had the meatball which did not disappoint, but I'm telling you- the Veal Cutlet Martorano is one of the best Italian dishes I have EVER had!"}
{"text":"Stay away. Large portions of mediocre food, and expensive. Staff nice but doesn't make up for the food."}
{"text":"Fabulous.  Best Caesar salad and Carbonara I have ever had.  Excellent and attentive wait staff.  Will go again next time in Vegas"}
{"text":"If you've stayed at the Rio then you've seen the posters for Martorano's.  Big guy, shaved head, tribal ink, and a scowl.  I stay at the Rio 4x or so a year and it's their posters that have helped me resist eating at the restaurant.  As a marketing guy, it was clear that the strategy was to promote this guy's persona and DJ skills rather than focus on the food.  It was a free sample that drew me in.  I was waiting to check-in when a pretty girl came around offering samples of a Martorano's meatball.  I was shocked how good it was...really good...the best I've ever had good... and it was certainly enough to make me want to give the place a try.  Thirty minutes before dinner, I began to have doubts. The reviews for this place were so spotty, I have never heard anyone say anything good about the place, and I wanted to have a great dinner.  Should I risk it? Maybe I should take one more look at the menu.  It all looked good and I was fired up to go there again until I read the end of the menu: ABSOLUTELY NO CHANGES OR SUBSTITUTIONS. JUST LET ME DO WHAT I DO AND DON'T BREAK BALLS.  The \"balls\" thing was kind of Philly-clever and I liked it, but the \"absolutely\" thing reeked of immature hubris. If you're giving it to me, I'll accept that, but since it's my nickle and if my request is reasonable, then it's my way or the highway.  Despite this nagging \"don't do it\" feeling, I decided to give it a shot. Should I have listened to my instincts?  The entrance to Martorano's opens to the bar where it's intimate with a clubby feel.  Before being seated I took a look at the dining area.  Gone was the low light and rich feel of the bar and instead you're treated with a stark open plain and uninteresting room. There's nothing noteworthy about the decor other than there really isn't any. Pretty bland open room.  What I gather is supposed to pass for some kind of industrial minimalist effect simply looks unfinished and incredibly boring. The awesome news is that the dining room blares dance music at ~2 little notches below club volume.  The other reviewers weren't joking; it's loud.  The only other time I've heard music that loud at a restaurant was at a \"rock n' roll\" teppanyaki place where the cooks fling rice at the kid's mouths. BTW, that restaurant sucked as well so I opted to sit at the bar.  Wow, only one other customer at the bar and he's getting his check.  I'm gonna get great service, right?  Hang on....the bartender...let's call him \"Dick\"...wants to bus the guy's area before he acknowledges me.  A long 4 minutes later, Dick comes by to get my drink order.  I get my drink and my menu and try to decide what to eat.  I had a few questions about the menu, but Dick is still really busy...intensely focused...tending to his empty bar.  I called out my questions and he yelled back his answers OVER HIS FREAKIN' SHOULDER.  You see, Dick was far too involved going thru the day's tickets and lining up glasses etc to actually look my way, let alone stand in front of me. Clearly I was an interruption to him.  If I hadn't been starving I would've bolted, so in an attempt to minimize my time here I decided to have just an app  - the meatball with a salad.  While I was waiting for my food, Dick continued to amble about behind the bar, not once coming by (and the waitstaff wasn't keeping him busy). The food came. I ate it.  Dick continued to personify his nickname while doing his busy work.  Wait...2 girls just sat down...busy work is over and he's got all the time in the world for a 10 minute flirt session.  Ah...Dick wasn't that busy after all, was he?!  He was just being Dick.  The meatball was again really good, but a gristle in a meatball is JV and I found a gristle in my last bite, so it wasn't that damn good after all.  I got the hell out leaving a far too generous $2 tip...wish I'd left the goose egg.  This is an odd review but it's an odd restaurant.   The dining room ambiance is such an anomaly that the only crowd I believe this restaurant could appeal to are perhaps some teens and young twenty-somethings that like the loud music and probably haven't had a lot of (any?) fine dining experience.  I'm certain this place thrives on Vegas first-timers and unsuspecting others since I can't imagine anyone enjoying an expensive dinner in their dance floor environment.    Trust the 1 and 2 star reviews.  The bartender appeared to be some sort of manager and with his kind of skills, I'm sure the rest of the food sucks as hard as the service.  A final note:  this is definitely NOT a $$$ restaurant.  If a couple each has a cocktail and splits an app, has a salad and a mid-priced entree with a glass of wine and no sides and no desert, it will cost upward of $180 before tip.  The only way to get out with the $$$ rating is to have no alcohol or under-order."}
{"text":"I dined with my brothers and sisters and got charged twice for the same meal !  Don't trust these people and review your bill very carefully.  The prices are high and the atmosphere way too loud to talk to your table mates.  The salad was dripping in its dressing and the food way over spiced."}
{"text":"Was looking for a place to eat in the Paris Hotel in Las Vegas. Didn't really want Italian but it smelt good from outside. So glad we decided to go in. We had Salad, Chicken Parmigiana and a Cannoli with chocolate chips. We shared this and had plenty of food. It was so good. It all tasted very fresh. I don't like cannoli's but this was the best I've ever tried. The service was very good as well.  I totally recommend eating here."}
{"text":"This restaurant was a complete disappointment. Disappointed because it wasn't very good. Disappointed because so many people told me that they HEARD it was good. AND most of all. Disappointed because we did not go to Carmines in Caesars Palace.    This is Vegas. This restaurant should be good for a few basic reasons.   1. It's Vegas and it's a restaurant in a hotel on the strip.  2. It's in the Paris hotel. This is a nice hotel (for the most part) and to have an Italian restaurant of this nature in this hotel is a shame.   3.  This restaurant is not to far from Gordon Ramsey's steak house. Have you been there?  It's amazing. If I were Gordon Ramsey I would not want to be in the same building as this so called Italian restaurant.     OK. Enough rant. Now the facts. Here's my review.   This restaurant su*ked!!  Plain and simple. I ordered a Cesar salad. If I order a Cesar salad at the Olive Garden I know what I am going to get. I am going to get a mediocre salad with bottled Cesar dressing. Oh.......and not only will I not get anchovies in my Cesar salad, I think most olive gardens do not have anchovies anywhere in the restaurant. But this is not the Olive Garden. This is a fancy Italian restaurant in Vegas on the Strip in the Paris hotel surly they will do a Cesar salad right?  Won't they? .............well......the answer is no. And not only do they do it wrong. They do not even realize it. The Cesar salad at this Italian restaurant doesn't come with anchovies. That is the standard Cesar salad. (I should have left at that point). But.....unlike the Olive Garden you can request them. ....  yea........When my Cesar salad came out, it came with a side of anchovies. ARE YOU FREAKING KIDDING ME. That is not how you do it. You do not add the anchovies that way. Even I know that. What a joke.   OK. One more food item. I know I have rambled on.   I love nochie. It is my very favorite Italian food. Being Italian my self....(well, mostly anyway) I fell in love with this dish when I was a kid and my friends mom in Upper Darby, Pennsylvania would make it from scratch when I would go to his house on the weekends. WOW!!! It was amazing. This was not the same experience. This nochie tasted like chef Boy-Ar-De  make it last March and was kind enough to put it in a can for the Cuz that runs this restaurant. It was hard. It wasn't dumpling like and tasted blan. Yuk!!   A lot of words in this review I know. But in Vegas at a hotel like the Paris the food should be better. I have had a better Italian meal at the Olive Garden.   Stay  away!!!!"}
{"text":"I went there last night. We sat at the bar to eat because the restaurant was full. Which was okay with us. The bartender was great. But the food was not the greatest. We had a salad which was tasty but the spaghetti and meatballs were awful. The noodles were under cook, the meatball tasted like they were raw and the sauce was to bland. I'll never go back to this restaurant."}
{"text":"appetizers were really good! meatball salad & mozarella stack. entrees were salty as all hell... cut back on the sodium, cuz!"}
{"text":"I am in the Paris Hotel every weekend, so I thought I would take family there to try it.   Very underwhelmed and can't really see what the hype is all about.   Service slow (Sunday night in December) we ordered the Calamari as an appetizer (which was OK) and literally a minute after another waiter showed up with our Entrees! The look on his face when I asked him to come back later was priceless!   We both had the Veal as Entrees, when It came back the second time, I was very unimpressed. It was just a piece of Breaded Veal with a thick sauce and sliced Parmesan cheese.  No Veg, no sides, nothing.   The sauce had huge pieces of a very spicy pepper, I love hot and spicy food, but this didn't go with the dish at all.   It's an expensive place, my wife works for Caesars ent, so we got a discount. To be honest.... There's far better Italian restaurants in Las Vegas for the same prices."}
{"text":"Incredible.  I was expecting good, old school Italian. But it was so much better.  Mozzarella made to order. Sunday gravy, best chicken parmigiana ever, and carbonara served with fresh egg yolk cooked into the warm pasta at the table.  One word of advice: as good as the bread and two types of olive oil (plus pecorino Romano) are, skip them.  You will want every bit of your appetite reserved for the main courses.  Definitely a new favorite in Vegas (and we live here)."}
{"text":"4 of us just dropped $500 (five hundred dollars) for dinner and a bottle of wine. We're going to a show @7:00, so we decided we would return and have dessert after the show.  When we returned we were refused a table for dessert and drinks. Plenty of tables available. It was 9:30 pm, restaurant doesn't close till 11:00 pm. They wanted to put us at the bar with music blasting behind us. Are you kidding me? We just spent $500 there 2 hours before.   We travel often and know tons of people that travel also.  We will NOT be recommending this place because of this treatment.    I would think twice about putting my name on a restaurant that treats you're guests this way."}
{"text":"I'll start by saying that the Service was excellent.  Our waiter was super attentive and extremely friendly.  We ordered the salad and meatball as the appetizer.  It was excellent.  For the main course I ordered the Spaghetti di avolo and my finace ordered the lamb Bolognese.  Both dishes were extremely salted.  It pretty much ruined any flavor of the herbs and spices that the sauce had.  I couldn't even finish half of my plate.  The drinks were good.  Overall, the service is top notch but the food was borderline inedible.  Just like anything in Vegas, this was expensive, but I think I would have gotten something better tasting for the money we spent there."}
{"text":"Overall, horrible experience, but let's break it down:  Food - good. Ambience - horrible. Waitstaff & service - slow and unrefined but responsive. Value - 0 stars. Bottom line - never bring a large group here.  My job had me in the Vegas area and we (about 10 people) decided to go for some fine Italian cuisine on a Tuesday night.  The guy heading up the evening's plan picked out the place.  I had miss-givings about the ratings on Yelp, but went along.  At around $50-$100 a person, our expectations were for a trendy but refined Italian dining experience.  We dressed in suits and expected a 3-4 star dining experience (formal dining rating system).  Ambience - promised to be great, but collapsed.  Initially, the light effects, soul / R&B music, and classic Casino movie were all positive.  Upon seating, I noted to my wife that we overdressed for the restaurant (2 stars on the formal rating system).  As the evening progressed the ambience went from interestingly artistic to overwhelming and lewd.  The music got so loud we couldn't hear the waiter.  The movie changed to something that should have been X rated (lots of bare breasts and explicit sex scenes.)  There were 5 TVs in sight; all playing the same show.  We all commented on how distracting it was.  The lighting was so dark that they gave out pen lights to read your menu with.  Between the darkness, overwhelming sound volume, and explicitly distracting TVs, the cacophony was at best poor taste.  Wait staff and service - responsive but not refined.  We made reservations for 7:30 and were seated at about 7:45 (not bad for a group of 10.)  The waiter took our drink orders and explained the specials using an iPad (all good.)   The drinks came and we ordered our meals.  About an hour later we noticed that the bread was gone, the wine and water were empty and still no food.  A little after this the waiter came up and apologized for the delay.  The establishment was not busy, but we were a group of 10, so we were not upset - these things happen.  What happened next was odd:  the waiter brought out 9 of 10 entrées.  The missing meal had accidentally been delivered to the wrong table.  We waited 15 minutes for us to all have food before starting.  At this point the ambience was also starting to collapse (see above).  Once we all had food we started to eat and I ran across a 10 inch hair in my otherwise tasty lasagne.  I lost my interest in eating my entrée.  The waiter was apologetic, made my entree complimentary, and offered free deserts for the table (good comeback move).  He also offered drinks \"to compliment the desert\".  The volume level of the music made us mistakenly think he said \"complimentary\".  Unfortunately, it gets worse.  My desert came out first ... then we waited for 15 more minutes for the rest of the deserts to arrive.  We were not amused.  At this point it was 10:30pm.  The evening was shot.  We left around 10:45pm having paid over $900 for the evening's disaster.  Food - good.  Even though the rest of the evening was pretty horrible, I thought the food was good tasting.  The appetizers were tasty with a nice twist and the wine pairing complimented the lasagna nicely.  The deserts were authentic and also good.  Unfortunately the food's taste lost focus when it became cold from waiting and I ran across the hair in my entree.  Value - bad deal.  For a meal in the $90 range, I am looking for a good experience and great food.  Loud music, porn, and clumsy service heavily detracted from what had potential.  Bottom line, don't go here with a large group or high expectations."}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant before seeing Penn & Teller.  Didn't have reservations, so we sat at the bar.  Bartender was taking care of at least 15 people at the bar plus drinks for the rest of the restaurant.  Service was slow, but the bartender had a lot to do so it was understandable.  I got the linguini with clams, my husband had mixed seafood linguini.  The food was good, but on the salty side.  We each had two mai tais with dinner.  Surprised to see that they charged $14 each for the mai tais which were small and unremarkable.  Total bill was over $160.  I wish we had noticed that we could have saved 25% by showing them the stub of our Penn & Teller tickets.  Won't be going back there again."}
{"text":"Had a very good meal here about a month ago when I was in town on business for a restaurant conference  (Eggplant Parmigiana and a house salad).  Thought I would give it another try this week when I was back for another restaurant related convention. this time, the meal was terrible and the service was indifferent.   The bartender raved about how great the Philly Cheese Steak was and basically told me to order it. when it arrived it was so salty it was not edible. don't misunderstand, I love Philly Steaks and I like salty food as well, but this was disgusting. After he saw I couldn't eat it, he asked if I wanted something else. I ordered a salad and decided to call it a day and chalk it up to a bad meal. However when I received the check, I was amazed to find that the overpriced $18 sandwich  (of which I ate less than half) was on the bill along with the salad.  Bottom line I will never go back. Bad food and Bad service is a lethal injection in our business."}
{"text":"Obscene and disgusting!  Had a reservation at 9:30.  Sat down and the volume of the music from the video displays was so loud that we had to shout at each other at the table.  Asked manager to turn volume down.  He said, \"his owner wanted it that loud.\"  Sat back down.  Video screens switched to a movie trailer.  So now we had Eddie Murphy screaming obscenities: \"c**k s****r  &  m****r f****r at mach 10 volume in our ears.  We got up to leave.  Told the manager.  His response to the obscenities was, \"that's just who we are\".  Really, How sad!  Went across the casino to Mon a Mi Gabi and had a great meal."}
{"text":"A few things  Tile on the floor is the exact same as the bathroom in my house that was built in 1905. True story,  exact same. This part is not a knock, just truth.   Appetizer bread frozen in the middle,  what the heck  Pasta subsitution is apparently a chore, and was looked down upon.   Angelhair pasta not offered here.  Al dente only, dont ask for anything else.  No parmesan offered with pasta  Beer selection limited, bummer.  Table service limited,  meh  Basically, i expect this level of selection and service from fast food, not a restaurant.  Very disappointing.  Asked for refund on entrees, received.   Very disappointing"}
{"text":"Amazing! But be warned it is pricey. My grandma ordered the pig feet and pig skin as an appetizer and I thought omg that is gross but our waiter explained to me that it gets cooked/marinated in a red sauce for about 10 hrs. I ended up eating more than my grandma did lol it was so good. I ordered the eggplant stack which is a caprese salad and geese it was absolutely amazing! The mozzarella was extremely fresh and the balsamic vinegar was aged so it had a sweet taste(i would say this is the best dish I have ever had in my life hands down) my grandma ordered the riggatoni and liked it but said she wouldn't order it again for $28. They also bring you out complimentary bread (which is also awesome) and it comes with a dish of olive oil, balsamic vinegar, and red pepper flakes(i also enjoyed this immensely). So it is a bit pricely but is a great choice if you want to splurge for amazing food!"}
{"text":"i feel bad for those that didn't get the good experience.  i was there w/ a bunch of guys so we mingled at the bar before we got seated.  if you want to a nice quiet romantic date don't come here because your eyes and ears will be occupied by music, tv, and lights.  once our table was ready the waiter greeted us and placed wings on our plates.  we sat and started to grub on our free wings... boy was it good!  they only offer a verbal menu so you have to pay close attention to what the waiter says.  ok, make sure you order their philly cheesesteak appetizer cuz it's freakin awesome!  that thing seriously melts in your mouth.  i ordered their lobster thing w/ risotto and again.. super yummy.  their portions are HUGE so make sure you go on a empty stomach.  chef martorano was there that nite so it was coo to see him in action.  i dunno why people are hating on the location just cuz its at the rio... it might look ghetto but my room was awesome.  maybe they were staying at the cheap towers.  have fun at cafe martorano!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere was definitely different. Every few minutes they play famous death scenes from popular movies at an extremely high volume ... a little ironic in a restaurant that is all white and (sort of) fancy looking. It was interesting to have the entertainment while waiting for the food.    The food wasn't that great however. Steak was boring. Not well seasoned. Sweet and sour calamari was a joke ... completely unoriginal. The gnocchi was good though. Its better with the marinara sauce than the alfredo.  There are so many other great places in Vegas. Martorano's is not worth a second visit when there are so many places I have yet to try."}
{"text":"My family ate there on 4/19, we ordered egg plant stack app.  It was good but a bit unrefined, too thick slices of cheese and tomato. For dinner chicken parm, no pasta...  Was deemed good. As well as pasta marinira. My father and i both ordered the clams in white sauce, we couldn't eat more than 3 bites as it was way too salty and spicy from the chilis..  We sent both entrees back and didn't order anything else.    Unfortunately we will not be ordering any pasta dishes from this resturaunt again..."}
{"text":"Food was ok, host was  horrible and mediocre, slow very slow server even the place was empty, meatball salad is good as reviewed in this site."}
{"text":"I am very confused as to why this place doesn't have a 5 star rating. We went here for my best friend's wedding reception and fell in love with the amazing Italian food (some of the best I've ever had) and the fun atmosphere! My friend and I were singing along to all the songs. :) They really impressed me too when the chapel she got married in was running about an hour behind schedule and I called the restaurant to push back our reservation ON A FRIDAY NIGHT- they were so accommodating and understanding! The service was so great too. I wrote in the Open Table reservation notes that we were there for a small wedding reception and 2 of the staff came by and told the bride and groom congratulations! We will definitely be back next time we're in Vegas. Thank you so much, Martorano's for helping us make October 2nd such a memorable night."}
{"text":"Avoid this place. Seriously. My group wanted to get dinner before a Penn and Teller show, and this place looked promising. My first red flag should have been when we walked in at 7pm on a Saturday night and there were five people in the entire restaurant. We get seated and order. The food was DISGUSTING. My husband got the linguine with clam sauce: clams were horrifically overcooked to the point where they were hard and the broth was bitter and soapy tasting. MIL got penne with sausage and mushrooms. She look about three bites and couldn't eat anymore. Sausage was like hockey pucks and sauce was too sweet. SIL got the baked lasagna. Between and sauce and pasta it tasted like they had dumped a pound of sugar into it. Lastly, I ordered the rigatoni with Sunday sauce. The chunk of pork wasn't pork at all, it's was a fist sized piece of fat. Zero meat. MIL complained to the manager and they gave me a meatball instead, even though I insisted I wanted nothing more to do with their food. The only plus I can give to this restaurant was that the waitress and manager were very nice and apologetic. Service was superb, but that doesn't trump the awful food."}
{"text":"I came here a few weeks ago for a some appetizers and a drink. The bread and chili oil was a really nice start with the Martini that I had. The meatball was flavorful and tender, I would definitely come here again to try one of the entrees."}
{"text":"We had dinner here for my husband's birthday.  I usually stick to cream sauces because I'm picky about red sauces.  I ordered the tagliatelle classic parmigiana cream with chicken and peas which was excellent.  The pasta's had great texture and flavor, definitely handmade, I love that it was thicker than other pastas I have tried.  After getting our appetizer meatball I wished that I had ordered a dish with the red sauce, it was so flavorful and zesty.  I tried some other dishes that my family ordered too, the bucatini carbonara with pancetta was rich and wonderful also.  I liked the very modern decor and loud music.    ****If you are a local show your ID and players card and get 25% off****   The reason's I did not give this place 5 stars: I don't like that the soda comes in bottles.  I'll be forever spoiled by the endless refills that practically every other restaurant offers.   My husband had the orecchiette with hot and sweet peppers which did not look appetizing at all, I didn't even try it.  He thought the restaurant was \"OK\" while everyone else loved their food."}
{"text":"Incredible Food, Service, Ambiance and Drinks!  Louis our server and the entire staff were fabulous!"}
{"text":"Only giving this three stars because I didn't order dinner here so can't comment fully.  I will say the service and friendliness of the staff was first rate -  The place was loud but they have TVs at the bar and cool movies running in the background - lots if DeNiro. For obvious reasons.   I DID order the calamari which gets rave reviews by locals here.  Instead of being covered in batter and deep fried - it was more sauteed and then mixed with both sweet and hot peppers and this great sauce - delicious!  The app portion was pretty big too.  I would definitely return - and FYI - to give you an idea of prices - my app and one glass of port (Taylor 20 year) was $42 and change - place was crowded - reservation recommended for weekends -"}
{"text":"Excellent staff and service. The food was outstanding and I really enjoyed the atmosphere. The eggplant Parmesan was large enough to share so you get your money's worth. A Notable wine list was also a nice compliment. This place is worth a try. Not to mention, for a more upscale place they were not pretentious and also were reasonably priced."}
{"text":"We loved the food here! Very pricey but well worth it! We even had gluten free pasta and it was to die for. If you are looking for a fancy, romantic place? Go here!"}
{"text":"Got there at 9:50 pm last night and they said the kitchen was closed. I told them that I was a tired and hungry traveler and that their posted hours are until 10 pm. They said their last customer came in an hour ago so the kitchen closed early. Is it that hard to stay open 5 hours per night?   This same thing happened last time I tried to eat here but they had closed down even earlier. There won't be a third try. I feel sorry for the chef - his staff couldn't care less about his business or his customers and their indifference is hurting his bottom line whether he knows it or not."}
{"text":"Martorano's in Vegas was the worst restaurant I have ever dined in any where in my life!  The place was way too loud to have conversation, the wait staff were arrogant, condescending, & the rudest ever (turned our backs for a few minutes to talk to the guests at the table behind us & when we turned around again our appetizers were gone without us even finishing them), they tried to up charge us on bottled water & other items and when we said the regular water was fine they gave us some hokey excuse about it not being filtered, etc. & appeared pissed off that we didn't order bottled H2O, the food was horrible & over priced, (veal parmesan floating in a plate of oil). YUK, This place is a sad excuse for supposedly an upscale/pricey dining experience, especially with so many terrific places in town to choose from.  Don't waste your time & money!"}
{"text":"Awesome food and Sunday Gravy!!!  Meatballs are the bomb.... Yo Cuz!!! A must when in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Went there this past week, stumbled upon a great Italian restaurant in Paris...who knew?  But the food was great!!!  We started by splitting the eggplant stack, highly recommend and I had the veal marsala, tender and delicious and my friend had the chicken parm which she said was great.  Super attentive waiter and manager checked in on us, great hospitality.  Check it out!"}
{"text":"Some of best Italian food I've ever had. Some reviews here seem to disparage the place with insinuations about off the shelf ingredients, etc. I don't know and I don't care. The food was top-notch. Three of us each tried different pasta dishes. Ravioli with hot/sweet peppers, the Pork Gravy pasta, and a veal dish. Each was excellent. Larger portions, but not overly so. Also had the calamari with spicy peppers/sauce. Best version of calamari any of us ever had. Excellent wine list for Italian wines.  I rate the food 5 stars, but deduct one star for the \"ambience\" factor. The restaurant in the Rio doesn't seem to know what it wants to be. Nicely spaced tables with white tablecloths, fresh flowers on each table. Pretty classy, but then you see all these flat screens everywhere you look playing gangster movies (Godfather II was playing while we ate), and Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin blaring in the background. We didn't like that.  Food? Fantastic. The room? Not so much. And the disco balls gotta go."}
{"text":"Some time back, my wife and I were staying at the Rio, and went here for dinner, Tuesday night about 7 PM.  Walked in and was told that, since we didn't have a reservation, we would have to wait, which was cool with us.  So, we're in the waiting area, and we see two different parties walk out within 10 minutes.  Within those 10 minutes, we see another couple walk in.  I couldn't hear whether or not they had reservations, but they went right in.  After waiting another 5 minutes, I decided to just stand at the hostess station, thinking that maybe we had been overlooked or forgotten.  Oops, a family comes in (three small children and their paternal units), and gets seated.  I'm standing RIGHT THERE, no meniton of a reservation.  I walk to my wife, sit down, and tell her what happened.  I'm telling her that I'm ready to bounce to eat anyplace else, but she's pleading that we're already there, and to just give them a few more minutes ...  And here comes the hostess, \"We're ready to seat you now.\" Really?  You mean a table just somehow opened up?  Would it be next to that lovely family that just came in?  Because I would love to use some colorful metaphors.  Bottom line for me was, the front of the house really spoiled my appetite. As the first person to greet your mostly out of town guests, why would you want to want to alienate even one?  Is the place really that fiscally sound that they can blow off customers?  Since then, my wife asked me once if we could go eat there but I told her I refuse to go back.  First impressions, indeed.  Yo cuz, mangi questo."}
{"text":"Wanted something to ease our hunger pains,  but now wanting a full meal.  Ordered the risotto at the bar and it was HEAVEN!  Melted in our mouths.  Looking forward to my next visit!"}
{"text":"No. No. No.  I was so hungry and craving spaghetti and meatballs, so since my husband and I were staying at the Rio we decided to give Martorano's a try.  Our server was so terrible.  He was visibly frustrated with us when he asked whether we wanted extra plates and we didn't answer right away (because we were both in the middle of eating).  Our meals came out at different times, so my husband sat and watched his food cool off (I told him he could eat, but he's polite enough to wait).  Then my plate arrived with fingerprints along the edges.  My waiter just stared at me while I wiped down my plate and acted like he was doing me a big favor when I requested another napkin.  At the end of the meal, I mentioned that being served on a plate with fingerprints all over it was very unappetizing, and he just mumbled a completely insincere apology as he walked away.  My husband backed me up by leaving just enough cash to cover the check.  On principle, whenever I don't tip, I always talk to management.  I explained that when you're charging $25 for spaghetti and meatballs, the meal should be served on a clean plate.  I also said that I could even get over that, but when the server doesn't care whether you had a good experience then he doesn't deserve a tip.   I felt better for speaking my mind, but still not so good about dropping $100 for such sub-par service.  Another pretentious restaurant in Vegas."}
{"text":"Excellent Italian. Had the Short Ribs and Pasta. Sounds wierd but was outstanding. We will definitely come back next time in LV."}
{"text":"Unless you have money to burn on \"just ok\" food, skip this restaurant.  I ordered the chicken Marsala that came with no pasta.  I asked for a side of pasta and they brought a minuscule plate of spaghetti.  The chicken Marsala was $38.  The minuscule plate of spaghetti was $12!!!!  TWELVE dollars!  Enough said."}
{"text":"Food was excellent. The service was the best I've ever had or seen. They really combine excellent together. Had Chris as our waiter. The food was outstanding"}
{"text":"I ordered spaghetti with salad. The dressing was too sour and the meatball was salty. For our main entree, we ordered seafood spaghetti and a special item which both were super salty that we didn't finish. We drank so much water! The music was too loud that we have to yell across the table to talk so we didn't say much.  2 stars for the ambience of the restaurant. I will not be coming back!"}
{"text":"I have lived and dined in Vegas for over 10 years now, and I have never experienced such a complete joke of an experience as I had when dining here.  I don't believe for an instant that I can adequately convey how disappointed I was or how many horrible attributes this place has.  The nightmares started when we first sat down and didn't stop until we were out the door, and unfortunately there was a long gap of culinary torture in between.  Most of all, this restaurant is the epitome of a \"tourist trap.\"  It features an extensive yet grossly overpriced menu and a service staff that was obviously hired based on looks rather than on ability - the two main \"tourist trap\" requirements.  The atmosphere is unlike any place you've ever been, but that's not necessarily a good thing.  It's different because nobody in their right mind would ever build a restaurant like this.  Loud, overpowering music and movie tracks that keep you from being able to have a conversation (and likely designed to also keep diners from being able to complain about the food) combine with disco lights and uncomfortable chairs to make sure there's no way anyone could ever experience a moment of peace while dining.  It's like trying to eat in the middle of a dance floor of a Vegas club, except that people on the dance floor would notice you more than the staff at Martoranos does.  Incredibly slow service, requests that went unanswered, one entree served cold and another served only half-cooked (pasta too, not meat) and all the while an unbearable atmosphere that made us all want to jump up and leave at a dead run.  We should have, because when the bill arrived it was completely outrageous even after they took off the half-cooked spaghetti.  If you go, bring earplugs, aspirin, dark glasses, $200 more than you would expect to spend on any meal, a microwave or warming plate, an air horn (to get the attention of the staff or the person across the table from you) and, most of all, bring a whole heck of a lot of patience.   I love the Rio and everyone and every place in it, or at least I did until they put this dump in.  Let's hope people start realizing it for what it is and the Rio replaces it with a real restaurant that's not run by an egocentric maniac who thinks that people want everything his way.  Don't believe me?  Look at the menu carefully (both comments and prices) then ask to walk through the \"dining\" area before you agree to sit down.  I wish we had."}
{"text":"Martarano salad was delicious. A bit pricy, but the food is pretty damned good. Ate at the bar, bartender was very attentive and the food came very fast. The linguine and clams was legit. Giant clam meat within the pasta. Delicious. Some might find it salty, but that dish is supposed to be. I would totally eat here again."}
{"text":"I've been ordering calamari as my favorite appetizer for decades and the Calamari Bisby is hands down without question the best I've ever eaten. It is the most tender bite of calamari you can imagine. The flavor profiles boasts a slightly spicy and sweet Kung poa style  taste leaving you wanting more.  Next time I come to Vegas I will be back for the appetizer alone. I ordered the veal Parmesan for an entree.  My companion ordered  the chicken parm. Both met and exceeded expectations, the chicken outweighing the the veal in tenderness and flavor. I will make an effort to return here next time I come to Las Vegas. The service was above par.  The waiter was helpful and the delivery/bussing service staff was borderline entertainment for the evening.  I can't stress enough to get the calamari Bisby even jf that is all you come for."}
{"text":"I went for dinner at 5pm, sat at the bar and ordered there signature dish, rigatoni with sunday gravy. I thought it was really good, but for $28 I expect a larger portion of pasta. Pasta is not expensive, so they should load all the plates up like many other Italian restaurants do. If so, I would have given a 4 star rating!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went to this restaurant last night and will NEVER go back.  It is outrageously expensive for what you get.  Our waiter was arrogant.  The music was so loud that we couldn't speak and when we asked if it could be toned down, we were told no and to be happy we were sitting where we were since it was louder in other areas.  When the music wasn't playing they were showing an old Rocky movie (again so loud that my ears hurt).  With all the other good Italian restaurants in Vegas, do yourself a favor and pass on this one."}
{"text":"An unexpected find for amazing veal and chicken Marsala! Portions were great and the side of pasta and Caesar salad easily shareable. The atmosphere was fun but not overdone and our waitress amazing. She was so helpful with suggestions and attentive. The wine options also very good."}
{"text":"The absolute best Italian food anywhere!  We go to the one in Ft. Lauderdale often and the Vegas location is just as amazing! The meatballs, the Calamari Martorano, the Sunday sauce!  Just go!!!"}
{"text":"I gave it two stars for the food. When we got seated, we got the iPad with the drinks. The waiter then gives us a spiel about the owner, food served family style, so if one dish is ready and the others are not, you must serve that dish and wait for the other dish to come out. If your other party doesn't want the dish you ordered, they sit and wait...and wait. They brought the appetizer, after yet another bus boy had brought the wrong dish, and we said we were splitting it. The assistant said he would be back to serve it to us. We waited   and waited while he went to get plates. Then waited some more. Finally he came with some plates.  THREE times the \"assistants/bus boys\" brought us the wrong meal to the table. They gave our food to the table next to us. They did let us keep one misplaced dish, but only after our waiter finally showed up and I told him we didn't order this. He said \"yeah, the other table got your food\" so we had to wait again for the food that we ordered. Since there was only two of us, the waiter was doting on the other table with four people. Bigger tip, I assumed. I ordered ice tea, and got a bottle of Chinese tea and a glass of ice. I guess they have various favors of bottled Chinese tea. Once the correct food finally arrived, it was ok. I've had better, but it was adequate. Will I go back? NO. No excuse for a restaurant that has been open for 6 months for the service. If this chef is so great, I suggest he hire a manager who knows how to staff a restaurant. The service was absolutely terrible and totally disorganized, and we were there on a night that it wasn't busy at all. I shudder to think what happens when that restaurant gets busy. My suggestion, go to Buddy V's at the Palazzo for good service and good food and walk past Martoranos at the Paris Hotel."}
{"text":"Cafe Martorano was probably one of my fave dining experiences I have EVER had.    It was my first time in Vegas, and we asked the concierge at the Palms for a good Italian restaurant nearby.  She suggested Cafe Martorano, and I am soooo glad she did!!    As soon as I entered the Rio, i'm not going to lie, I was turned off.  It smelled like a dirty diaper, and could not have cheesier decor or people roaming around.   But, as soon as we walked into the restaurant... it was an experience like none other.    I was with 6 of my girlfriends, and we sat down at a beautiful table, it was quiet, there were a few other people in the restaurant... and all of a sudden BOOM! Disco balls came down from the ceiling, GREAT old school jams were playing, the waiters were wonderful and super fun, the FOOD was amazingggg (make sure to get the eggplant stack as an app).    Then, two men came up to our table, chatted with us for a bit, and then bought our entire meal, multiple patron shots, and 2 bottles of wine.  All we had to do was give our waiter a great tip.  It was a fabulous time, great food, and I am going back in a week.    Don't let the Rio turn you off... this place is a MUST!"}
{"text":"Cliche Italian atmosphere, flatscreens playing various ratpack and bloody action movies which doesn't make the food any more appetizing. Speaking of the food, if you like too much garlic and way too much salt you will love this place. The service is terrible in terms of getting your food. We were sat in a nearly empty room, ordered and a few more tables came in and ordered.. most of the new tables were served long before us. It's not like I ordered something complicated, just spaghetti. The price is laughably high for this food, if you want the same kind of food head to the Olive Garden and save $50."}
{"text":"Jeremy, the bartender, was awesome. The food was awesome. We'll definitely come back. A great experience while watching the Cubbies win!!"}
{"text":"I love Italian food and really wanted to enjoy this place but I didn't like it. The bread they brought was dry and tasteless. It came with olive oil or cheese or spicy olive oil and none of that helped it. Just gross. For my main meal I got the veal piccata and risotto. There was two big pieces of veal and plentiful sauce but just not much flavor. And by the time I was halfway through the sauce was cold and it was congealed into a jelly like sticky glue. Risotto had zero flavor. It was supposed to have fresh veggies and cheese but veggies looked and tasted canned and it was just blah.  I did have chocolate cake for dessert and it was very moist and good. I saved more than half for next day but unfortunately got very sick to my stomach about 30 minutes after this meal so I ended up throwing it away because I don't know what I ate here that did not agree with me.  Service was fine."}
{"text":"STAY AWAY AT ALL COSTS!  This place will not last long.  The servers act like frightened dogs.  The management is argumentative.  Your soda comes in a plastic bottle.  The music is so loud it could make a Slipknot fan complain about auditory pain after dining there.  The server tries to force you to order your entree at the same time as your appetizers and when confronted as to why you need to order our entree right away they smugly answer like mindless buffoons \"Cuz that's the way we do it here\".  By far the worse dining experience we have ever had in Vegas.  We didn't even get past the drinks before leaving that abortion of a restaurant. If you want a comparable dining experience for a lot less money, then do yourself a favor and go to the Double Down on Paradise and scrape the dried sputum off the floor and put it on a plate.  You won't even be able to tell the difference between that and  Martorano's complimentary bread with ground rat meat they place on the table prior to cattle prodding you into ordering.  I know it's an Italian restaurant so mind my French when I say this place SUCKS!"}
{"text":"5 stars for service and food quality! Jessie was our server and she was outstanding. Super friendly, accommodating, and made us feel welcomed. All of her menu recommendations were spot on. For appetizers, we had the Famous Meatball and Eggplant Stacked. So delicious, I highly recommend both appetizers. Perfect sizes for sharing. For dinner we had the Veal Marsala and the Carbonara. So flavorful and authentic. Nice size portions as well. The atmosphere of the restaurant is really cool too. I'd definitely eat here again not only because the food is so good but the service we received was impeccable!"}
{"text":"One has a circus of choice for dining in Vegas ... BUT why in the F*** would you not have a true dining experience.  The Chicken Parmesan is heaven wrapped in the most amazing gravy and fresh freakin' mozzarella.  Not to mention, Paul, our server  sat with us for a true  heart warming chat and laugh. My Silican Great Grandmother will disown me from the grave for this ... Love you Great Grandma Orlando ... The greatest Italian dining experience ever!  You must dine here!    Why are you not here now!"}
{"text":"We thoroughly enjoyed our meal at Martorano's. The food was excellent and the portions were very generous. The servers were friendly, professional, and attentive. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Crazy expensive, poor quality.  That $30 veal parm?  Comes with no sides.  Expect to pay $6-10 add'l for a side.  And it's just ok.  The calamari is horrible.  The best part of the experience is the R-Rated movies on the TV's so you occasionally get to see a topless woman.  Skip this dump."}
{"text":"My husband and I went there for dinner and it was great! The best calamari I ever had. We sat at the bar, and the service was exceptional. We ordered what she recommended and it did not disappoint. The only drawback was the price. It was pretty expensive, but not any more expensive than the other dinner restaurants there in the Rio."}
{"text":"Restaurant was very nice although they play old gangster movies on several tvs throughout which makes it hard to pay full attention to the table... Service was top notch and food was delicious. Had the meatball to start and shared the rigatoni and the chicken parmigiana. The chicken was huge and tender but a bit too much cheese on top. Everything was going great until approx 9:15pm the music went from Sinatra style dinner music to blaring R&B and disco. It was quite strange and took away from the ambiance and the meal. The music was loud and awkward and with poor transitions. Great food and great service - just go before the 9pm discotheque starts!"}
{"text":"Omg! This was my 1st visit and it did not disappoint even the bread was good. I the chicken parmesan and a side of fresh veggie risotto and I highly recommend both! I will totally be coming back next time I'm in Vegas. The atmosphere was energetic and it's a great place to people watch. The music is vibrant and therr were tv's with sports and movies on. The service was also superb."}
{"text":"Looking for italian restaurant? This is the place to go. Great view and place. Servers offer you variety of pasta to chose from and wine, great choices. If you are looking for a first romantic dinner date, this is the place. Great staffs too and very friendly."}
{"text":"Wow. Amazing meal. Read the reviews 1st and they were spot on! Do not miss the meatball and fried mozzarella appetizer and the egg plant app! We were getting full so we split the Rigatoni Sunday Pork and it was AMAZING!!!! Do not miss these 3 dishes. Our Bartender Evis recommended it and he was spot on. Had an wonderful glass of wine with it! We will be back every time we visit Vegas!"}
{"text":"There is not too much to complain about here. Yes there are over priced items from on the menu. Stay away from them. The Carbonara Pasta dish is the BEST I ever had. And the meatball and Salad app was amazing. My Italian grandmother would be jealous of the Sunday \"gravy\" (We call it sauce).   Stay with the classics and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Truly disappointing experience. From the blasé  greeting by the hostess to the rudeness and sloppiness of the bartender to the exorbitant prices for average food and drink, this was the low point of our week in Vegas. We really enjoy Italian and the quality here was unremarkable yet for top dollar. Mr Martorano has his picture prominently displayed throughout the restaurant. One would expect that he would take more personal pride in the delivery of quality and the hiring of professional staff."}
{"text":"Nice decor, cool music. The tv screens were a little distracting for my other half lol The food was great. Had the pizza and it was really tasty. Would come here again."}
{"text":"My wife and myself were looking for a nice Vegas dinner during our stay at the Rio. So we finally decided on this restaurant.  We previewed the menu prior to entering the establishment willing to pay the inflated prices but for a nice Italian dinner.  We were seated and sat there at least 10 minutes without aknowlegement from the staff,  then tha loud music became unbearable.  Couldn't even carry on a conversation with my wife.  The music they think is innovative and customer friendly  \" SUCKS\".  It drove us out.    We took our cash elsewhere.   We'll never return to that restaurant...."}
{"text":"Booked here because the experience in Florida was epic...food, service, atmosphere...well, this was the antithesis, as the restaurant was about 1/2 full (Tuesday eve) and the service was slow.  Food was not nearly as flavorful as I recall, and the portions were overly sauced.  Thumbs down.  Bummed I burned a Vegas meal, and in a gross hotel to boot.  I'll certainly give FL another shot."}
{"text":"Some food is good, some just ok. But the service is slow. Very slow. 35 minutes from being seated to getting our first drinks. This has happened on both occasions I've visited. The servers are friendly, at least. The atmosphere is also very Jersey Shore. If you're in to that, you might enjoy it more than I."}
{"text":"Holyyyyyy Shitballs. This place sucks. (Note: I start every review at 3 stars. You get three stars for existing. Good service? +1 star. Bad food? -1 star. Etc.)  Alright so: The food? Actually not that bad. Pretty decent meatballs, sauce that apparently is called \"gravy.\" (Dear Steve Martorano: it's called sauce. Gravy is what you put on turkey on Thanksgiving. It's made from the juices and drippings of the bird. Look it up, cuz.)  So yeah, food was alright. That's as far as this review goes for positive feedback. Go to Martorano's if you enjoy the following:  - LED backlit menus - an iPad drink menu that gets taken away as soon as you order your first drink (want to peruse the drink menu? Good luck tracking down your waiter to get it.)  - Disco lights that rotate over your table constantly, changing the color of your food from pink to yellow to green to bright white.  - the same 10 loud songs that totally don't fit the meal playing over and over again because apparently whoever is in charge of the music found a mix CD from 1997 in the trash outside of Bally's (Hope you like Doo Doo Brown and Jock Jams vol. 3 while you eat!).  - American Hustle playing on the TV's all around the place. Now listen, I'm into film, I'm a grown ass man, but I don't really appreciate watching permed-up Bradley Cooper mount Amy Adams while I dip my bread in olive oil, ya dig? But apparently they have also been known to play The Godfather pt. 2, which totally fits in with the music. NOT.  This place is what I'd expect from a guy with \"Yo Cuz\" tattooed on his arm. It's like a 14 year old kid tried DJing for 3 years, had no talent, stole his grandmother's sauce recipe (not gravy. SAUCE.), and opened a bunch of restaurants with shallow decor, a limited menu, and ZERO imagination. This is a perfect example of good food with piss poor execution. Slow it down, Steve, ditch all of the flashy crap, and dedicate the place to serving good food. Because the food isn't worth shit when the dining experience is akin to root canal.   I'm looking forward to heading back next year, when this place is out of business and is replaced by a decent Italian restaurant, just like the one it replaced.  Final Verdict: +1 Decent Food -1 Music -1 Lights, TV's, General Atmosphere -1 Service (Wait staff is alright. But ordering from an ipad that you share with other tables? Not so much. Oh and be sure to fill out the survey on the ipod touch when you get the bill! It's SO hip!)  I won't say avoid at all costs - but get the food to go. Do not eat in the dining room."}
{"text":"Simply stated, everyone should be aware that this establishment refuses to accommodate any food allergies or food related diseases.   While I have a number of food allergies, I am definitely not one of those individuals who asks for outrageous customizations to the menu in order to be accommodated and I have never had to walk out of a restaurant due to a refusal to be served - not even in France, where I had to ask (in English!) to have my meal prepared without butter. So, imagine my surprise when I sat down with my extended family, for a birthday dinner for my aunt, and the waiter flat out refused to serve me one of the salads on the menu without dressing and a side of olive oil and vinegar. I did not ask for a dish to be prepared differently, only to not have salad dressing. I explained to the waiter it was a severe allergy and that I would only be ordering wine and the salad and he was so rude and obnoxious in his refusal that he reduced me to tears in front of 8 family members.   Needless to say, my fiancé and I left the restaurant and my aunt's celebration and will never return to this establishment. From what I understand from those that stayed, the salads were all prepared with far too much dressing, their version of \"al dente\" pasta is literally a workout to chew and is really nothing more than under-cooked and the service and attitude of the staff never improved. With so many options available in Las Vegas and even just within the Paris, I would be surprised to see this place still in business when I next return."}
{"text":"Came here for a bachelorette party dinner and it was so yummy. Perfect portions and the menus lit up. So cool!"}
{"text":"I can hardly believe there is only one review on this place! (Forgot to publish this back in February so it  might not be true anymore) Amazing meal. Atmosphere was fun and festive. Service was really good. Food was delicious. We will definitely be back next time we are in Vegas. Location is perfect - right next to Chippendales (here for a bachelorette party) and the voodoo lounge, and if you have a good table you can watch the Carnaval parade go by...  A+"}
{"text":"Played good music - however the food was overpriced.  Whenever I go out to eat, I like to go to places that are unique.  I've had better Italian food at other chain restaurants.  The chicken parm wasn't crispy at all.  The Marsala was to salty."}
{"text":"Where do I begin with this review. Wow is the first word that comes to mind! My family and I had a 8pm reservation. As soon as I gave our name we were seated immediately. The ambiance of this restaurant is FIRST CLASS! The decor, the service, the music, the menus that light up, everything is NEXT LEVEL. We had a wonderful server who came over and seated us immediately. We started off with the Famous Meatball & Salad and Fried Calamari Martorano. One word: AMAZING!!!! The meat ball had SO MUCH flavor. It was very tender and rich but not overcooked at all. It spread apart with a slight push of the fork. The gravy, very flavorful and rich. The salad was fresh and very flavorful as well. The Calamari....seasoned and cooked to PERFECTION along with the sauce and green peppers, hands down the best calamari I've ever eaten, PERIOD! I had actually stopped eating calamari the past 8-10 years because it simply wasn't prepared right the past few times I had eaten it(restaurants should take notes from Steve). These were our appetizers.  Next up, entrees! The kids kept it very basic, spaghetti with sauce(no gravy, sauce) and salad. My wife ordered Linguine in White Clam Sauce and I ordered the Philly Cheesesteak. I didn't try any of my wife's but she said it was fabulous. I was nervous about the cheesesteak because I don't like a lot of bread, especially if it's hard and firm. My plate came out and the sandwich was PIPING hot. So hot I had to allow it to cool down. I finally took my first bite and the flavors oozed inside of my mouth. The cheese, the steak(SO tender and juicy) and the bread roll was not too big and it was beyond soft. The meat and cheese seemed like it sank into the inside of the bread and it made a perfect fit! The peppers on the side were spicy(exactly like I like them), juicy and fresh! I only ate half of the sandwich and I was stuffed! The kids finished their meal off with cake that I didn't try ONLY because I was too full. Steve and Marsha treated us like family! Steve is one of the most humble, authentic people I have ever met in my life. What you pay for when dining at Cafe Martorano is a EXPERIENCE, period! Its truly entertainment: the music, the movies on the big screens, the decor, the service, the food; it's simply on another level. When we visit Vegas again in a couple of months I know exactly what I'm ordering and I can't wait! Hands down the best Italian food in Vegas, no questions asked!  Yo Cuz!!!!!"}
{"text":"I read some of the other reviews and I cannot speak on the ambiance in the main dining room as we sat out in the patio area. I will however speak on the food.  I took a client here for dinner on a Thursday night before a night out. We ordered a bottle of wine and the calamari to start. The service was excellent, the wine was presented well, and the calamari was out of this world (I'm a bit of a calamari snob). I then ordered the Chicken Sicilian. I'll make this short...this is probably the best Italian food I have ever had and I used to manage an Italian restaurant. My client was also very satisfied as we were talking about how good dinner was for the rest of the night.  Again, I didn't experience the atmosphere of the main dining room which, from reading other reviews I could see as being kind of cheesy. But if you are just looking for great food, go here and sit out in the \"patio\" area, which is in front of the restaurant out in the main hallways of the Paris Casino."}
{"text":"I don't know why this restaurant doesn't have 5 stars. Our experience was incredible. The food was to die for, their homemade mozzarella was out of this world. Very authentic food, and we know because we are Italian! Highly recommend!  So we ate again here two days later and AGAIN, the food was phenomenal. Chris our server was outstanding and Jeff the manager was great as well. After talking to them and picking their brain about who Steve Martorano was, we now love it even more. Our kind of restaurant and our kind of guy!   Don't hesitate to eat here. Incredible place."}
{"text":"Give it 4 stars for the food I had, 4 stars for service, 3 stars for price (I understand location costs) and 3 stars on seating (explain below.)  First of all if you are staying or gambling at Paris or Bally's, good Italian, real good. Can I get better in Utica, NY or Philly or Brooklyn or Jersey or....mom's kitchen, yeah, yeah, maybe, but you are in Vegas. If you like veal, you gotta try the house Veal Cutlet Martorano. It is spicy with peppers and really sharp tasty cheese. I get veal all over and am a pretty good cook myself, I'm gonna figure this recipe out (steal it)!  I had it with the sauteed greens (spinach) crisp, fresh & tasty. Why not escarole? I was drinking bourbon, so the food review ends there.  Now if you want a little privacy, stay off the rail with all the casino pedestrian traffic. Interior is ok. I don't get the movies or music, give me Italian music, Martorano!  Wait & bus were attentive and personable. I don't get the lit up menus, but then again I'm old fashioned.  My food was 4 star, I'd give the place 3.5 overall, and yeah I'll be back for the veal & greens."}
{"text":"WORST CASE OF FOOD POISONING IN MY LIFE!  The only thing that my companion and I ordered that was separate from the group was a plate of angel pasta--\"completely vegetarian.\"  Don't know what they put in that pasta, but the rest of our Vegas trip was spent over the toilet or in bed :("}
{"text":"Excellent service, food and ambience. Highly recommend this restaurant, they aim to please."}
{"text":"Just Amazing...There is nothing else to say!  Our server Paul was very knowledgeable and offered several suggestions on what to try.  Food was just like Mom makes...Home cooking and fantastic flavor.  You MUST come and try the rice balls and meat balls!!  WOW!"}
{"text":"Food was absolutely amazing! And our waiter, Matthew, was the best ever! Definitely coming back :)"}
{"text":"Best eggplant I've had in 10 yrs, besides mine... the Martorano salad with a meatball was excellent.  Things are alacart, but dont go crazy ordering too many different things, good to share.."}
{"text":"A relatively new restaurant in between Bally's and Paris, which replaced another Italian restaurant. I will say this place is much better than the previous restaurant, but that's about it. The decor is very nice, modern with a classic touch, very inviting. It's a restaurant slash sort of night club with a DJ slash bar. When we were in there happened to be a Jazzercise convention in town and all of a sudden 30 women from outside and inside the restaurant went to the dance floor and danced their shoes off. It was a nice touch to the evening.  5 of us sat at the bar, which ended up be very nice, since we got a corner.  I will say the whole Yo Cuz thing and life size posters of Steve and him on TV over the bar in a loop cooking just doesn't cut it for me. It was almost a turn off. Seeing a tattooed jacked guy in a tight shirt and cooking with no audio over and over got old very fast. I would rather see a logo spinning or a game on TV.  To start with the menus illuminate! Very classy touch. How many times is it too dark and you can't read the menu, this is the first time seeing anything like this. Their main menu opens up and it has a easy on the eyes white glow. In addition they have an iPad for drink specials AND food specials. We weren't told about this until after we ordered appetizers as it wasn't clear that there was more to the iPad menu. For drinks I had an amazingly smooth vodka martini, highly recommend it.  For appetizers we shared the meatball salad, the eggplant stack and the fried calamari martorano. The meatball salad is a great idea, haven't seen that too much however you need to have a good meatball. Not the worst meatball but frankly it was not good. Way too dry and I believe too much pork. They say it was voted one of the best meatballs around, they probably didn't have real Italians try them. Do not get it, you will be disappointed.  The eggplant stack was good, nice crust on the eggplant again nothing special. Now the Calamari Martorano, that's no normal fried calamari, and this time I mean that it a good way. The sweet and spicy pepper tomato sauce with balsamic vinegar was delicious. The calamari were tender and the plate was full of flavor. For an extra spice drizzle the spicy oil they bring it with the bread! One thing I don't understand is they have a second fried calamari dish, why have two? I would rather see a different dish.  For the main dish I ordered off the specials (see the iPad). I had the double cut pork chop in a vinegar pepper sauce. The pork was cooked through and through, but more importantly the meat was very moist and full of flavor. It's tough to cook pork all the way and keep it moist and tender, these guys know how. In addition it was a very large portion, as we noticed on a lot of there dishes.  Have to give credit to the bar back, not only did she clean up and help the bartenders, she served our appetizers family-style and was on top of anything we needed. Made the experience at the bar feel like we had a waitress, nice job.  You get a lot for the money, big portions and big flavor at Martorano's!"}
{"text":"Over-priced. Over-salted. Poor food quality. Giant hustle."}
{"text":"If you're at Paris and looking for a great restaurant then eat at Martoranos. Excellent service and food is delicious. Big portions which is nice. Our server Jessie was super cool. Great personality and very attentive to our needs. She recommended the eggplant stack... wow!! And the famous meatball is amazing!! Must order this! We had the veal Marsala and penne alla vodka. Food is awesome I'll definitely be back! Great job Martorano you have great food and great employees! Thank you to our server Jessie she was awesome."}
{"text":"First off, the service was good and the appetizers were decent.  We had the mozzarella (good) and the rice balls.  Before I continue I just want to share my qualifications for even giving a review - I can cook a wide array of foods; from Peking duck, to rib roast with béarnaise, to what has been said is lasagna as good as anything that can be found in northern Italy (with homemade sauce).   My wife had penne ala vodka, and while the flavor was good, the plated portion was at most worth $18-20, even by Las Vegas Strip standards, not the $28 they were asking for.  I had the Veal ala Martorano.  The \"sauce\" was basically some stewed tomatoes, chunks of garlic and chunks of Chile peppers (Serrano's), some salt and pepper over fried veal.   Now for those of you who enjoy heat for the sake of heat then you might very well enjoy the \"sauce\".  However, I find that spices-heat should not appear out of nowhere like a left jab to the face, depending on which fork full of food you happen to take a bite of.  They should be infused in the dish and add to the flavor, not fight with the other flavors.  That was not the case with this dish.  If you think you might like the dish then I would suggest trying it this way -go buy a Serrano chile and get a slice of pizza.  Then take a bite of each at the same time.  This will save you the $32 cost of trying the \"veal ala martorano\" to see if you like it, although it may be an insult to your favorite pizza."}
{"text":"We were at Paris Hotel for 4 nights in February 2017. We enjoyed a lot of good food but by far this was our best overall experience. From the reservationist the day before to the hostess the water server all the way thru to our waiter it was primo. Food was excellent as well, we shared the waiter's recommended special of the night - be sure to check the iPad for their specials. Loved sitting out on The Avenue as well. If we are back at Paris Hotel, we will definitely return."}
{"text":"Food varies. My dish, the carbonara, was awesome! Real authentic and even came with the raw egg (Something that most places won't do). My husband ordered the Chicken Marsala. The sauce was amazing, probably due to using a good wine, but I found that the chicken was a bit dry and tough. The Caesar salad was a very large portion and excellent. It was a little heavy on the EVOO but that seemed to be a trend here. Granted it is a very good quality oil, so I did not mind.   The service was real great as well! Table was kept clean, staff was very knowledgeable of their menu, and the remaining staff kept busy and even though it looked a little slow they were working (setting tables, etc).   The decor and location are why I gave it 4 stars. If this restaurant moved to an on-strip location like the Bellagio, Cosmo, or Venetian/Palazzo I think they would do much better. The Rio just does not do them justice. The view of the pool is not so great and the tables and chairs are a bit outdated and show some wear and tear.  Overall, I would come back for a birthday dinner or special ocassion!  We went to see the MJ Live show after and it was very entertaining. Recomendation: Dinner and a Show!"}
{"text":"I wanted to dislike this place.  The life-sized wall posters of the giant tattooed Italian American Cook with his catchphrase \"Yo, Cuz\" along with omnipresent clips of HIS favorite movies and HIS favorite cooking show (himself) should be all the warning you need that you are dealing with a massive ego here.  Oh, if that weren't enough, the entrance to Paris on the Arc has one giant image of Gordon Ramsay and one of this guy.  So, at first glance, I'm thinking, \"Ego, pure and simple, and nothing more.\"  I'm happy to say I was impressed by the outcome, though.  Ego or not, this food is good.  Now, disclosure, I'm not Italian, so I'm probably not as harsh a critic as others.  But, I've eaten at a fair share of Italian places, and I know some authentic Brooklynites of Sicilian heritage who know a thing or two about cooking.  This place nails it.  The fried mozz, best I've ever had.  A giant ball of fresh, in-house made mozzarella, thick sauce with spicy peppers, perfectly cooked and seasoned.  The bolognese (special of the day while we were there) was literally the best I'd ever had.  I mean, just melt-in-your-mouth amazing.  Cocktails were great, no complaints here either.    I'd definitely come back here again if I'm ever in Vegas and craving good Italian.  This was well worth the visit.  For Vegas, the prices were actually pretty decent, too.    It does get a bit loud there, though, especially after 9pm.  They warn you about this, but it's still hard to hold a decent conversation, even with someone right next to you.  Part of the kitsch, I guess."}
{"text":"This place was one of my favorites. The had Emlo as their house wine, which is always a plus. The food was great. I went with a nice Caesar salad and a fish dish. Everything at this place was perfect.   The menus were electronic and very neat. We sat on the patio which is not really outside, but the hotel area had painted ceilings so it seems like you were somewhere else.   Food was top notch! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Not satisfied with this restaurant at all. I went around early afternoon and the restaurant was pretty slow, only a handful of people. You would think we wouldn't have to wait. That was not the case. We had to wait over a half an hour for the waiter to take our order. And almost another half hour for the food to come! It would have been worth it if the food was 5 stars but it was completely average, and for what I am paying (overpriced for the quality) and waiting for, I expected more. Disappointed with the service and the food here and will definitely not be going back."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went there a couple of weeks ago during our stay in Vegas.  I have nothing but great things to say about this place!  First off, WOW on the food!!! It was one of the best meals we've ever had! All the food was delicious.  Beautiful restaurant and cool technology - love the lit up menus and tablets to order dessert and such off of.  We ate at the bar to watch the NBA playoff game and Jeremy took great care of us.  It was an all-around wonderful experience!  If you're in Vegas, eat here"}
{"text":"Very loud inside. All entrees served have no sides and they don't allow any substitutions or anything to their menu. Server was friendly. Managers are very cold, unhappy and look like they hate hate their lives. Ordered the veal marsala and it was ok. Got an $18 side order of spinach, lol. I'll never go back or recommend this place to other locals or tourists. There are better options folks!"}
{"text":"Food is pretty good.  Service is so so so slow.... almost feel like you have been held hostage by hostess.  Price is reasonable. Portions are actually too big."}
{"text":"Service was terrible, we sat at the bar but were basically ignored, we left after an appetizer and two drinks, really annoying, food is good but give me a break, too many options for great Italian in Vegas to put up with that"}
{"text":"This is a very nice hang, catering to a very middle-America crowd.  Points for lovely design, friendly service, and Strip-central location.   Review based on bar service only.  I had a very nice time at the Martorano's bar last night. Very friendly, knowledgable service. Nice lighting and not too Crowded (Wednesday evening after ten).   I had a house-specialty cocktail called \"Angel\" -an upscale twist on a margarita. Sweet, but I knew that going into it. Followed by a glass of Pinot -Grigio.   And here's the thing: I was so distracted by the wine glasses, that I almost forgot about the beverage. Rarely have I heard a wine glass ring so beautifully. It was like an alcoholic Tibetan singing bowl. Truly marvelous.   But the wine: eh..the selection was pretty average -same with beers and whiskys.  The house cocktails are pretty standard for the Strip - as were the prices. Three beverages came to $42 +tip.  And here's the other thing: I love Italian food, and spent many years in Boston's North End - the traditionally Italian part of town. Even the best pasta dish is inexpensive to make, and should not be flamboyant. Simple good food made from fresh ingredient is what it is all about.   Martorano's is \"production Italian\". More emphasis on presentation than is necessary for such a simple cuisine - with prices to match. The gullible are easy to impress. But again, pretty normal for The Strip. I'll go back for the hang, and the singing wine glasses. Probably go light  on the food."}
{"text":"First time and it was very presentable. Had reservations in advance. Waited about 15 minutes because we were early. The menu is right in front and you can scroll through it to see what goodies you would like to eat. When you get seated they have an electronic presentation the waiter does with wine etc... They bring out the fresh baked house bread and several dips for it. We had the big Meatball, which was excellent. Ordered Linguine & the fried Lobster tail. The risotto was the best so far I have eaten. The experience was the BEST! I will be back for more of that. Dessert & everything was the ALL Delicious!! The flat screen tvs were all over, no sound. I heard there is a DJ on the weekend and the floor turns in to dancing which was not the night we were there. It was a good experience. Lots of food that it is ridiculous. But we ordered a lot of food!! I wish they had sample platters for sale!! Guess I will have to eat here again to try the other dishes. Very upscale in price so please see the menu. Ambiance, presentation, food display, employees on top of their game were all Excellent!!"}
{"text":"Great food and awesome atmosphere. I had the chicken with peppers and mushrooms and it was great. The bartender picked a great wine to go with it. I loved the fact the Gm Jeff came by to introduce himself. Definitely will come back next time I'm in LV. (It also doesn't hurt when you're favorite movie is playing in the background, Casino!)"}
{"text":"Now aside from homemade spaghetti and meat balls at home and a pizza from our favorite pizza parlor,  I'm not much for Italian cuisine. That being said, while staying at the hotel my wife and I decided to give Martorano's a try as an alternative to our usual steak house, seafood, and buffet dining. We had a bad experience, first they gave us probably the worst table in the house, right at the restaurant entrance so parties waiting for their table were standing right over our table. Ok we didn't let that bother us to much. Now the food. My wife ordered the Linguine in white clam sauce, what she got was Linguine soaking in olive oil that taste a little rancid. Neither of us could eat the Linguine but she did eat the clams they were ok..  I ordered the Rigatoni with Sunday gravy recommended by the server. A big chunk of roast pork that was fairly tasty but there was not enough gravy to satisfy my taste so I asked for a little more gravy, the server said he could do that for a  5 dollar cup of gravy as a side dish. ( WHAT ) I did not pay the 5 dollars simply out of principal. I could not finish my plate.   I'm not someone that makes a big deal about bad food or service ( service was ok ) in a restaurant because it makes for an uncomfortable situation for all. I just do not return.(  later that night I picked up a couple slices of pizza at JJ Boulangerie )"}
{"text":"That's right...five stars. ..I have had a lot of carbonara Pasta in my life.   This was truly amazing.  They actually stir the egg in at the table.   The pizza my husband had was thin crust and delightful!"}
{"text":"Im giving this restaurant 2 stars only for the food....  the loud atmosphere and the I could care less attitude from the waiter Paul because the owner wants it that way doesn't work for me.   If a customer requests COOKED  pasta and  NOT al dente pasta.... it should be cooked as requested.... it's the same as when someone requests a steak to be cooked  certain way it gets done.... pasta should be no different.    I as a paying customer don't care how the owner thinks it should be cooked.    As a local to Vegas I have to say I will be thinking twice before returning to this restaurant in the future.   Also sound is too loud.... TVs were way too loud.... We couldn't even hear the specials, neither could the waiter hear our order. Again was told the owner likes it that way.    I don't think as a family we should be shouting across the table so we can hear each other."}
{"text":"Cafe Martorano's is absolutely delicious! We are locals, and we like to go there every few months (locals get a discount with a player's card, btw). Every meal has been fantastic; everything is fresh and flavorful. We try something different each visit and have not been disappointed. It is worth the trip! If you go around opening time, it's not as busy or loud. Later in the evening it turns into a club, I think, so that's a little weird. Can't wait to go back!!!"}
{"text":"The ambiance is alright..it is not a romantic place.  I went on NYE with a few friends and we were told going in it is a $50 minimum per person.  we thought, well, it's like 40 bucks a plate so with a bottle of wine and all we should be good.    we had a good waiter, was timely with service.  4 of us got the special which was a chilean sea bass with lemon butter sauce and one had the veal.  the chilean sea bass was ok...because it was an oily fish to begin with, putting on a cream lemon butter sauce made it a little too heavy.  the risoto was a little too rich, but the spinach was good.  i usually like my bass roasted or steamed, this was good but it was a little too much.  the portions were huge.  my friend said that pasta was a little under cooked.  i think he liked the veal though because they finished it.    at the end of the day, don't expect cheap stuff at vegas.  this restaurant is not a lovey dovey place but more for just friends hanging out.  there are better restaurants on the strip though, so this could b a second or third choice if other choices are unavailable..."}
{"text":"After scrolling through yelp reviews, this place sure seems hit or miss, but after getting a raving review from a friend we decided to take the gamble. Let me tell you, it sure paid off. I'm still drooling over my dinner last night.   Let me begin by saying the this restaurant has a modern, club like feel. Blue lights, disco balls, sleek bar....and REALLY loud music (I could have done without the last part. The music was so loud I could not hear own waiter and make it difficult to sustain conversation. On the upside, they were playing my jams so I spent most of the time lip singing in my seat as I waiting for my food).   They provided us with a small complimentary portion of pate on toasted sliced bread. I couldn't hear the waiter, so I can't tell you what is was exactly...whatever it was, it was delicious. Complimentary bread was left on the table with olive oil, cheese and some kind of oil based chili sauce for dipping. I live a gluten free life style and unfortunately they do not offer gluten free bread. (They do however offer gluten free pasta.)  As for my meal, I started with an EXTRA dirty martini which was on point. Props to the bartender. For dinner I ordered the pork chop which was one of the chef specials for the evening. I highly recommend, it was HUGE, perfectly seared and seasoned sitting upon a bed of cooked greens with the most delicious peppers which added the perfect amount of a kick.   I definitely recommend this place, I left stuffed and oh so satisfied."}
{"text":"Seven Stars guest--arrived 10 minutes early--told us we had to wait because the waiter was not available (since when is that the customer's fault?) --asked for another open table--was told the waiter at that table was waiting for a party of 10 and couldn't seat us until that group arrived..wow---decided to wait for the first waiter to become available -even though there were many open tables-finally were seated--waited 15 minutes--no water, no bread, no excuse me I'll be with you in a minute--no nothing---told my fiancé that if no one came our table within one more minute we were going to leave-and we did-went to Mon Ami Gabi--and loved it"}
{"text":"Got a recommendation from a friend to come here for their al dente pasta and great calamari appetizer.  Went with my boyfriend and took my younger brother here too.  The service is great, beautiful restaurant.  The menu even lights up with the open it which really helps since it is a low lit place.  When the food comes out, it is served to you, which is nice, but I like to take pictures of it before it is served, so it kinda messed up their flow.  I felt bad, but I needed pictures....to post on yelp of course! :)  The server was nice, but he pushed too hard on a good review.  He saw I was looking at yelp and asked if i was going to do a review.  i said yes, and he asked if he was going to get 5 stars.  To be polite, I said yes.  The push of a good review was a turn off.  The food was just okay....not much flavor and not good textures."}
{"text":"I had dinner at the bar last night. I had chicken Sicilian and it was delicious. In my view, it was a large serving. I did noticed that the couple next to me ordered appetizers,  the appetizers seemed exquisite. It is pricey, but the quality of the food is well worth it. Exceptional service from everybody."}
{"text":"The food was excellent and the servers were great. Ray and Francisco were our servers and they were so attentive and prompt with everything. We really enjoyed it and we will be back!"}
{"text":"This is probably as good as it gets in the Rio. The meatball appetizer here is delicious...I would come back for more! You get one huge meatball, but it's good to share since the entree portions here are huge. I had the chicken marsala which came with like 4 large pieces of chicken that could feed 2 people! The chicken was moist and cooked perfectly, but the marsala sauce was a bit too salty. Most of their dishes also come with either a side of gnocchi or risotto. I had the gnocchi, which wasn't that great. I also tried some of the chicken parmesan, which was pretty good...I guess you can't go wrong with their marinara sauce."}
{"text":"We came here with a small group.  Our reservations were early since we were seeing a show at the hotel.  They were very patient with us as we had some guests arrive late, but still got us out in time to see our show.    The salads are big.  One ceasar was enough to feed 2+ people.  The entrees are also big enough to share, and the appetizers are easily a meal.  My hubby and I shared a pasta dish with pork.  It was excellent.  We would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Classic American Italian made to perfection. It seems like it all starts with the ingredients here; the house made mozzarella and ricotta were delicious. You can absolutely taste the difference in these dishes compared to any other Italian food you're used to. We started with the shrimp scampi appetizer that out server plated for the two of us to split. The scampi sauce was awesome. I got the bucatini and meatballs and enjoyed every aspect of the dish. The \"gravy\" was simple and delicious, perfect al dents pasta, extremely flavorful meatball, and the final perfect element: that dollop of ricotta.  Aside from the food, the service and atmosphere were also worth the 5 stars! Our server was super attentive, excited to tell us about the food, answer any questions and made a great wine recommendation. (It was their brand that they sell at the restaurants and online which we'll be ordering very soon!). We loved the fun super club atmosphere and you go in looking forward to enjoying this unique fun experience.  My only tip for them would be to make sure the hours are advertised consistently. I went to check out some other yelp reviews while we were dining and noticed it said the location was closed. Spread the word that it's open late & has awesome late night full dinner service!  Will recommend to friends that visit Vegas and return to this spot when I'm back!"}
{"text":"Italian food the way it's supposed to be ! True, genuine Italian with only the freshest ingredients, including homemade mozzarella and they are NOT shy with portions !  Owner Steve Martorano is a culinary genius with a huge celebrity fan base. I was lucky enough to score one of his first edition autographed books while dining there. The ambiance is elegant and tasteful and the menu has a wide variety of culinary treats that anyone can find something they will love. I started with the eggplant stack that was simply rediculous ! HUGE slices of eggplant, mozzarella and tomatoe and moved on to the veal cutlet which is brought in fresh from local farmers. It was so tender I never bothered with the knife. The service was excellent and staff was attentive and helpful. This is not a place to go if you are looking for Pizza Hut quality food or price, so be prepared to pay for what you get but all in all I will be dning there again as soon as possible."}
{"text":"Our server Bryce and Edgar did amazing job tonight as a host. We were not planning to visit here for our dinner but we were extremely pleasantly surprised. I would really recommend here for dinner their lobster with lemon sauce was great."}
{"text":"I can't remember the last time I had Italian food this good! The meatball salad and the eggplant stack are the best appetizers on the menu and are great for sharing. They  advertise having the best chicken parmigiana in Las Vegas and I think they are right! The lasagna was also great. Mark, our server did an outstanding job and made the night that much better. Unfortunately, we never made it to desert, we were way to full. I will definitely return on my next visit."}
{"text":"Our severs Raymond and Francisco were excellent and so was our food. Chicken Downtown was fantastic."}
{"text":"My husband and I were told to have Italian here.. we were on miracle mile.. rt outside the mall a short walk in flats of course to Paris straight through the the cobble stone walkway  Didn't need to wait to be seated at 8:30 hostess gave us out on perimeter dining  Service was not over top but pretty good  Bread was somewhat ignored  Water was on spot! Drinks, order, food, presentation were all very good. Willing to fetch anything we needed didn't anticipate my needs..but still adequate. Linen, nice glass wear and flatware. Our food which I don't recall with all the talking and drinking and more drinking was pretty damn tasty  It was good. Experience given was very nice  Bill was what was expected $$$ Overall I'd do again"}
{"text":"Stopped in to have a cocktail for the first time. Sat at the bar as I am apt to do and was glad that I did. Nathan, the bartender, was a true professional. My martini was made just to my liking. I ordered the special, Bolenese. It was fresh and delicious. I requested a glass of wine and Nathan's recommendation was spot on. I will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"Martorano's is a unique Italian restaurant. The 4 star is based on \"No Ravioli\", which was the most incredible Italian dish I have ever had!  We were there a couple of months ago, and looked forward to it again.  It can be noisy, but it is clean and a great Restaurant. We too love the \"eggplant stack\", that someone else recommended. I had the lasagna trying to get close to the Ravioli's, and it too was amazing.   Please put the Ravioli on the permanent menu."}
{"text":"The food was good but overpriced and overshadowed by the ridiculous in-your-face music and television show. Even the girls in scandalous outfits and guys hanging out at the bar just looked uncomfortable here, like they weren't sure what they were supposed to DO.  The design concept is totally off the mark, and I doubt this place will be open much longer."}
{"text":"If you e ever been to the restaurant in Florida, then don't go here. Will totally be disappointed!  My husband and I started w the meatball n salad app. Which was made for one!! Super small, not enough to share! Sauce was great! Meatball? Eh.. The theme of the restaurant seemed a bit watered down, especially w the wait staff wearing \"yo cuz\" shirts. One word of advice, \"yo Steve, do us real fans of yours a favor. Get your ASS to VEGAS  and tell those Fu-ers at Cesears To let you do your thing."}
{"text":"First time at this restaraunt. Great service and great food. Must try meatball salad. Portions very large and can be shared. Little pricey but worth it."}
{"text":"Cant modify the dishes what so ever, maybe i don't know Italian food but i wouldn't eat here again. I asked for a salad and asked if i could have the dressing on the side cus i hate heavy dressing on my salads.. I was told no that they couldnt modify anything. Came with a crowd of five people hungry and left hungry. No one finished their plate of food and the bill was 300$ There are so many places to eat, dont think its necessary to even try... Staff is friendly but thats about it."}
{"text":"Great place. Great food! Calamari Martorano special is excellent for appetizer. You must have an appetizer before your main course because great food must be prepared from scratch, so waiting is a must. If you are in a hurry I do suggest eating at McDonald's. Please no substitute in the chefs dishes, let it be. Everything is prepared old school traditional family recipes."}
{"text":"We ate at the bar because we didn't call ahead for reservations.  I'm glad we did.  Jeremy, our server, was great.  Made good recommendations, had jokes all night and made it a pleasant experience. By way of food, I started with calamari and then had a seafood pasta special.  I thought all of the food was phenomenal."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here for our 8th wedding anniversary after seeing the Rat Pack show at the Rio. It was seriously the BEST lasagna I have EVER had! And they had a great selection of delicious appetizers and desserts as well. It is a more modern atmosphere with \"club\" type music playing but that didn't bother us, we were still able to have a discussion. Due to the music it may not be the best choice for older couples (60+) but I hear they play more Rat Pack type music earlier in the evening so that would be nice to try! We went at 845pm. I saw they were preparing to open one at Paris on the Strip and can't wait to visit that one as well!"}
{"text":"So I came here on Thursday night this week, no reservation. The hostess was very nice and I got seated in 5 minutes, and dress warm in summer, this place is like a meat locker at this time of night around 8:30 p.m. The hostess was wearing a wrap around sweater too keep warm. Now the food, the House made mozzarella and tomato with basil and balsamic reduction salad, this salad was just average. The mozzarella was tough, seemed like not their best attempt at this salad course. The entree was Chicken Marsala and it was huge in portion size, the chicken was over cooked, the sauce and mushrooms were very good, too bad the chicken ruined it. I ordered a side of vegetable risotto and it was a good choice. The house wine selection Pinot Grigio was very good named after the owners vineyard. The Coffee and Tiaramisu were the highlight of the meal. Brenda my server was vety nice and attentive, she is actually the reason this was not 2 stars for the review. Probably will not go back, the town has far better Italian restaurant choices than this one. I wish only the food was as impressive as the wine cellar."}
{"text":"Yo Cuz!! Because you have to!! Four days in LV eating in the \"well known chef's hubs\" and THIS place rocked it!!!"}
{"text":"I have no complaints about this place at all.  Prior to leaving my review I read through the alot of the others and I have to say that my experience was totally different.  We happened upon the resturant after making plans to see Penn & Teller at the RIO.  Since we were headed to the RIO we decided to eat at one of the resturants inside.  After reading a short description of each in a Vegas information magazine, my wife and I chose Martorano's.    For some reason the catalog said that we didn't need reservations but it was wrong.  When we got to the resturant we had to sit in the bar as a result of my mistake.  The bar was dark and romantic and there were several tv's one of which was showing CASINO and another showing clips of the resturant's namesake Steve Martotano on different tv shows.  We didn't have to wait long at all for our food and for once didn't have even a little buyers remorse about the money we spent to eat.  Great resturant."}
{"text":"Went here for a staff dinner one night. We ordered a couple of meatballs to share. DEFINITELY try the meatballs. They are FANTASTIC! The evening we were there they had a Chilean Sea Bass special. It was melt in your mouth tender. Those of us that ordered the special just about licked our plates clean. Place is a bit pricey... but hey, you're in Vegas!!"}
{"text":"Great place to celebrate a birthday! Food was wonderful, service was excellent. I will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"I was in Vegas this past weekend and had dinner at Martorano's Paris and it was ABSOLUTELY GREAT!!! I had the most delicious sea bass that melted in your mouth in the most wonderful white wine sauce, I mean gravy.  Steve was around and I the pleasure to meet him, he is a super nice guy, down to earth I thought that was so refreshing. I LOVED this place and would go again every time I'm in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick snack at 5:45 and they got us in without reservations. We sat down and ordered drinks and the meatball salad. Was excellent!  Bread and olive oils/butter served as well. Finished eating and were on our way by 6:15."}
{"text":"Came to this place with some family friends for our pre Penn & Teller dinner. Just made sense to do the dinner at the same hotel as the show. And yes this is the restaurant with that cheesy ad (as seen on Tropicana) with the Italian guy (that looks like Pit Bull) and the sexy woman in the background who can't resist the \"Italian\". We didn't realize we had ACTUALLY dined at the place with the horrific ad until post dinner.   Disclaimer: There's a little bit of cheesiness involved in dining here 1) Loud opera style music is playing.  2) Yes there are about six flat screens (estimation) staggered around the dining room. three flat screens were on the wall behind me.   But the food makes up for the cheesiness (if you can get past it). Server was mindful and the busers kept the table clean. Warm rosemary infused bread served with a trio of dipping oils. The extra virgin olive oil was very good. We got some version of a deconstructed caprese with balsamic gastric. Loved the fried basil they gave us with it. They devote a whole portion of their menu to a mozzarella bar. The mozzarella in our caprese was the best that I have ever had. Generally I would say the menu isn't all that revolutionary....lots of fried options and the portions are alot bigger than celeb chef run restaurants (like B&B in the Venetian). I ordered the bucatini all' amatriciana which was perfectly al dente and right on point sauce wise.   For dessert we got bananas foster with waffles and tiramisu. Both were good but oh my god the bananas fosters with waffles sounded disgusting to me (on the menu) but it tasted really good. By the time I got around to taking a bite of it (we were doing family style among the whole table for dessert) the waffles was soaked with the butter from the caramel of the bananas foster. It was like a waffle with seven layers of butter!"}
{"text":"Great service, go between 4:30-8p the music isn't blaring so you can have a nice meal. Beware the waiters are great sales people so keep that in mind when asking for suggestions from them. Hands down the BEST MEATBALLS ever. Penne in Vodka sauce was a bit dry but the chicken parm was everything ! Overall delicious food, pricey but that is what is to be expected from a strip restaurant."}
{"text":"I dined in with my gf on a whim at around 8pm on a Monday night and most certainly regret it. We we definitely not dressed in the typical business casual/business professional attire like the rest of the customers were. I was in jeans, t-shirt, and baseball hat. My girlfriend was in a hoodie and jeans. And let me tell you, our waitress definitely treated us as if we didnt belong there. She glazed through the menu and the specials for us and asked us for our drink orders. We ordered some martinis off their featured list. 10 min later our drinks arrived and she arrived to take our orders.  We decided to do the tasting menu they had available so we could try a couple different things. The Caprese salad came out relatively quick. We both really enjoyed it. It was flavorful and plentiful. Now came the really annoying part. We sat at our table for over 25 min before our entrees came out. The entire time without even a check back from our waitress to see how we were doing. We could see the server station from our table and watched her just sit there talking with other servers and cooks. I got the penne with broccoli and she got the Ziti. My pasta was horrible, no flavor at all. If I wanted pasta with light butter I would have made it at home and saved the $17. The Ziti was much better than my pasta, it had good flavor but was way over portioned with the peppers. I will re-state that even up to this point we still had not seen our server again. There was another waiter (not a waiters assistant) that had to stop and get us refills and check if we were ok. It wasnt until 15min after we had finished with our entrees that she finally came back over and asked us which dessert we wanted to get.   We ordered the canoli. They were decent but you could tell they were not fresh and the outer part was way too hard and slightly stale.   Overall the service was definitely the part that completely ruined my experience at that place. Just because I wasnt dressed in my business attire, does not mean we should have been treated any different than those who were. I will never go back and definitely never recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Very authentic Italian food.   You cannot change anything on the menu  which was a bit annoying but understandable once the food came out.   The pasta was al Dente and so delicious."}
{"text":"Review for dinner, 9:30 pm Saturday 12/12. Reservation made through Open Table. I can't stress enough how wonderful an experience we had at Martorano's this evening. Server Paul went absolutely above and beyond our expectations. My wife and I chose to share an app, entree, and two sides. Paul did us the favor of splitting our order tableside and even served us for an extra personal touch. He couldn't have been more personable, attentive, helpful, and funny.   The food we orders was incredible. The fresh mozzarella and cherry tomatoes with evoo, sea salt, and a 25yr balsamic reduction came out first, and let me tell you, coming from someone who use to sell fine cheese, this mozz was top notch. The 16oz NY Strip was a perfect medium rare, and the blistered shishito peppers were the perfect compliment. The sautéed greens were cooked perfectly as well, and the risotto may be one of the best I've had.   Note to potential diners, on Friday and Saturday they have a DJ performing in house. Great mix, but can be loud in the main dining hall if that's not your thing.   Bonus points for Rocky playing on the tv's in the dining room :-)"}
{"text":"The location in Hollywood, Fl is absolutely amazing, this location however was very disappointing.  I made such a fuss about this restaurant to my husband that we made it a point to go to the Rio so he can taste the great food for himself.  Well, after trying to get ahold of someone all day to make reservations, we decided to make the trip anyways.  When we got there at 5:30PM they stated it was overbooked.  We had to sit at the bar where the Bartender rushed us in and rushed us out.  She literally gave someone our seat while we were still sitting there.  We had appetizers which the bartender served our plates between my husband and I...  WTH what if I wanted more meatballs than him?  Leave the plate there and we'll serve ourselves, thank you very much.  Anyways, the food was okay but the portion size was disappointing. As stated above the Hollywood FL location ROCKS!  Skip this location at the Rio in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"What an awesome place to take a date and enjoy top-notch food & service. We have NOTHING like this in Central Oregon. Our server was stellar in his delivery of the nightly specials...enough that we were sold on two of them. We ordered the Roasted Chicken & Chicken meatball Fusulli, and she had the NY Pizziole (NY topped with fresh herbs & house made mozzerella) OMG...the portions were grande & the food quality? truly amazing... With a waiter recommended glass of red, to go with the meal? This was a great dining experience.  The owner Steve was present 1/2 way through our meal, manning the DJ booth just a hairs split from the open kitchen.  What a cool place, If you dont like \"loud\"...this I will not recommend to you. If you wish to feel like a Queen & KIng while in Rio/Vegas...this is a Top option. I will return later to update more of OUR experience here, later as Im short on time. Namaste~"}
{"text":"Food was excellent. Had the Spaghetti Pescatore.  Music was horrible.  LOUD disco music in an Italian restaurant?!? Strobe lights?!?  Will not go back unless the music changes or better yet goes away completely."}
{"text":"Ok in June my wife and I went there and after waiting almost 45 minutes for our dinner we left because the service sucked.   We when back this trip in sept and unfortunately had the dinner. Horrible and over priced.   The pasta dishes we over salted and just bad. We asked if we could have one of the dishes without hot pepper and were told NO, the chef and owner refuses to accommodate. Well this chef can go F himself. I'll never go back and I would tell everyone else much better places to go in Vega."}
{"text":"Recently in Las Vegas with my husband. Decided to try Martorano's before going to a show. Wise decision. The wait staff was attentive and the food was exceptional. We shared a caprese salad of homemade mozzarella. Delicious ! When one of the staff noticed how much I was enjoying the balsamic vinaigrette, he brought me more. For the main course I had an Italian sausage pasta and my husband had a traditional Chicken Parmigiana. We ended with tiramisu. A very pleasant dinner."}
{"text":"Ate here last night...  NOT IMPRESSED  Food was mediocre, nothing to write home about.  Found that for Italian food, price was a bit high. And the entree I ordered was not served with a pasta."}
{"text":"I just called on 11/24/15 and the reservations operator said this location in the RIO is permanently CLOSED.  RIO LOCATION IS CLOSED!!!  The Paris Hotel Vegas location is open now."}
{"text":"Meatball? Second only to Raos. House Salad - esquisit. Seafood Linguini? - You CANNOT go wrong.   Enjoy!!!"}
{"text":"Rating: 0/5 Date of visit: 5/23/08  We went to Cafe Martorano based on rave reviews from one member of our party (there were 5 of us) who had been there previously. The experience we had was awful. It should also be said that my friend (the one who had been there before) agreed that the experience was awful and the polar opposite of what had happened the last time she came. I have joined Yelp specifically to post this review and hopefully save people from an expensive and altogether disappointing experience. You would be better served spending a similar amount of money at any of the top-class restaurants on the Strip. One big red flag went up when I saw the chef-owner had written on the menu (and I quote):   \"Absolutely no changes or substitutions.  This is how I cook.  Please enjoy and don't break my balls!\"  I don't enjoy references to testicles on my dining menu.   -Initially, they made us wait about 10 minutes for a table. Not bad--until we realized the dining room was empty. Why make the party wait? Another red flag that something was wrong when on a Friday night, there was almost no business.    -We were invited to wait by the bar, but did not want to have a drink until we sat down--at which point the bartender asked us if we thought we were \"too good for his bar.\" As a customer, I don't appreciate being questioned as to why I want or don't want a drink.   -Upon sitting down, we were asked if we wanted \"sparkling or flat\" water--and wanted flat (or rather, TAP water), not realizing we were buying ourselves bottles of water. Later, the waiter sounded irritated when we asked for tap water, although he did give it to us.   -We were never offered drinks or dessert. Luckily, by the time we got to dessert, all we wanted to do was get out of there.   -The wait staff never really checked on us (aside from the one time they refilled our water. when they did come over, they made some snide comment to one of the people in our group. Wait staff was incredibly rude. I guess our first waiter's shift must have ended in the middle of our meal; he just disappeared. I understand that he had to leave, but in most (good) restaurants I have been in, the waiter will at least let you know that they are leaving and someone else wiil be taking care of you. We only realized it when at the end a different waiter brought us our check. (We were not \"checked on\" frequently--or really, at all--as in other establishments.) Customer service is obviously not their forte here. They could take a cue from the bartenders at the casino floor bar downstairs. (At the casino bar, we had wonderful--and fun!--bartenders.)   -The prices are exorbitant. I understand that in certain fine dining restaurants, you expect to pay significantly more...however, $23 for one shrimp appetizer? That only serves ONE person (according to our waiter.) We would have needed to purchase 5 appetizers (or, $115 in appetizers) to have enough of ONE appetizer for everyone at the table. Maybe I'm wrong, but this is what the waiter told us. I have dined in many fine restaurants all over the world and have yet to feel that I've been so ripped off as I was in this restaurant. Needless to say, we skipped the appetizers.   -and, for these prices (heck, for McDonald's prices) the service is severely lacking. I hope this point is getting across.   -and it is, as most people have pointed out, very loud. I liked the music, but it pretty much killed any dinner conversation. Screaming across the dinner table is no fun.   -the food is actually good, but given everything else that was going on, it was difficult to focus on that. i enjoyed my perciatelli ($23) which was maybe a touch salty but overall tasty with the pancetta.    -The kicker: we gave a straight 15% tip because of the poor service--no extras there. They honestly deserved no tip, but in principle our group didn't think that was right. Imagine the shock when my friend who charged the meal checked her online statement and found that they ADDED an extra 5% to the tip--totaling approximately 20% gratuity--despite what she had written as the tip and signed on the receipt. She is complaining to her credit card company today to get the additional charge reversed.   Bottom line: Stay far, far away. Food is decent, but given the complete lack of service and high prices, you can get a much better experience at other restaurants. Hopefully the Rio management wises up and realized that either this restaurant needs to get more customer-friendly or it needs to be replaced. Hope this helps."}
{"text":"I love the meatballs but hate the dining atmosphere here.  It's loud with music and movies etc.  Just a different vibe and not for me so I always order food to-go.  Meatballs 5/5 The meatballs are about as big as a tennis ball and super delicious!!"}
{"text":"The best meatballs on the planet. Period. The meatball with salad option also comes with ricotta cheese and bread... might just be the best meal you will ever eat. I don't care how loud the movie playing is, I don't care how loud the music is... When I am eating this meal, nothing else matters. I'm in heaven.  I have told friends about this and they say \" I don't even like meatballs and if I did, I would want them with spaghetti\"  I just order for them and when it gets to the table and they start eating it.... They convert right away. So even if having a meatball with a salad sounds terrible to you... Try it. You will love it.  Just a note... If not all then 99% of the 1 star reviews are from jack-off people that are upset the restaurant won't make changes to dishes to make them happy. Go to Olive Garden people ... They will do anything to accommodate you. More pepper, less salt, more sauce, no sauce, this on the side, blah blah blah. This place makes it CRYSTAL CLEAR that they will make NO CHANGES TO ANYTHING. PERIOD. I love that. Finally a place that doesn't fold to these idiots that want to have everything adjusted to them. If you want something made a certain way.. Make it at home. If you don't like MARTORANO'S policy.. AWESOME! Don't go."}
{"text":"OMG! Best food I've had in a long time and I have family in the restaurant business! Please open up in the Los Angeles area!"}
{"text":"I've been to this location three times and the old one a couple. I've never had a problem with the quality of the food, it's amazing. If the place is at capacity, the service might be a little slow but that's to be expected. Some of these reviews are from some spoiled ass people that don't know anything about the biz. I'm sorry they don't customize dishes but it states it clearly on the menu! No one put a gun to your head and said eat. Maybe in old Vegas they would have. Then again they would have done us all the favor and buried your fake foodie asses in the desert afterwards."}
{"text":"I'm surprised by some of the bad reviews on this site! The ambiance was great. Service was wonderful... (even with no reservation).... and my Bucatini Alamtraciana' was as good as any I had while I was in Rome. The pricing was a bit high, but no worse than other nice restaurants we dined at while in Vegas (Dinner for 2 with wine & a shared appetizer $120)."}
{"text":"It is definitely not like any other dining experience I've had cause it felt like I was in a nightclub with all the loud music and flat screens but that was where it ended.  I was with 3 other people and we weren't on any type of budget for dinner so my review is primarily about service and quality.  We got there about the same time as a large group but nonetheless that is no excuse for our entrees to take over an hour to receive.  Our appetizers came out in a timely manner and were very delicious (the meatballs do live up to their rep and the pizza was probably the best I've ever had) but our main courses were a different story.  After waiting for over 30 minutes and seeing smaller parties who ordered after us receive their food before us we were more than displeased.  We spoke to our waiter and he explained that the large group had higher priority than us (I think they just forgot our order).  Our entire dining experience took nearly 4 hours and because of our displeasure, they offered to take a few drinks off our bill.  The money wasn't the problem, it was the service.  Our waiter hardly ever checked on us and we constantly had to ask other staff when we had questions.  The only good thing I can say about this place was that they played some Biggie Smalls on the speakers and The Soprano's on the TVs."}
{"text":"My husband and I were pleasantly surprised by just how fresh and good the food was. We normally go outside of whatever hotel we staying in but very glad we checked this place out for dinner before our show.   The portions are quite generous, enough to share. My husband had already eaten a heavy snack just an hour before our arrival.  Even though I'm an eater, I really needed his help with the Parmesan chicken, mozzarella & tomatoes and sautéed spinach. Our server Luis was excellent. Will definitely return here for dinner next time we're in Vegas."}
{"text":"We ate here while showing a friend around the Paris Hotel and we thought we'd be in for some incredible food after hearing all the waiter had to tell us. We were prepared to be blown away by amazing food. It it fell short. I like my pasta al dente but this was just too undercooked almost to the point of being crunchy. The sauce was just ok and so was the meatball. The ricotta was really good. The guys that ordered the veal and chicken parm didn't have any gripes but weren't blown away either. I think if you set people up for greatness as the staff does, then you should deliver. That didn't happen. The mozzarella appetizer was good but not over the top delicious as promised. It was just eh....  I come from a long line of great Italian cooks, especially my Dad, and this stuff just can't touch any of their stuff."}
{"text":"Was part of a large group here on Saturday, The food was very good, the wine was very good, but the place was really loud.   Very Trendy restaurant, but thankfully the food lived up to the hype."}
{"text":"Nice location and atmosphere,  but that's it!! The server we had was unhelpful and messed up the bill three times and still didn't get it righ. A couple of us had the salad and couldn't eat it as it was all vinegar,  them came the worse pasta clam dish ever. Also the pricing is outrageous...this was not a good experience"}
{"text":"Over hyped, over priced, lousy service and UNDERCOOKED chicken Parmesan - we stopped in here after a show and were very disappointed   The topper was RAW chicken served - saw the previous post on the veal and agree - average cut over breaded and just a glob of sauce plopped on top  Diner Beware !!!"}
{"text":"Never have had a bad experience dining here - if you're looking for a nice Italian dining option on the Las Vegas Strip - consider Martorano's! On this visit we sat at the bar and had the terrific Nate for our server - we started off with the meatball & salad (even to share between 2 people) - you get chef's famous big meatball and nicely seasoned Italian salad, for main course we had one of the evenings specials - the You Cuz Linguini with fresh shellfish and one of our regular favorites the Penne al Vodka. We finished off with a slice of decadent cheesecake. The entrees are served family style so definitely suitable for sharing - there's not too many side offerings but I've had the sautéed greens before. They have daily specials so be sure to check on in the Ipad. Entrees range from about $28 - $50 for most. Convenient location at the Paris and since the one at the Rio has been closed - this is the spot! They are only open for dinner. Don't miss out - check it out and you'll leave happy and full! ;-)"}
{"text":"Incredible menu, fabulous service, and a Sunday Gravy worth a second helping. We'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Delicious!  Service is great to start.  I had the rigatoni with Sunday gravy and it was just right. Perfectly cooked. There s a small side of ricotta cheese you mix in to give it a bit more of luxury."}
{"text":"Great food. Meatball was great and succulent. Our server Mike was gregarious as they are. Fully explained the menu, the options and his delivery was personable.  Even his help Jamie was great help, helped serve our food and was attentive,  kudos to both.  Great ambience and good dacor. Only downfall was limited selection on pasta options and hostess weren't the most personable."}
{"text":"Martorano's is soooo good, I came here on back to back nights during my last stay in Vegas. Ask Sergio & Jason -the best waiter and bartender!  Believe the hype! You need to order the MEATBALLS with the Martorano's salad! Please, I beg you. If you're in Vegas and reading this - I'm jealous because you're much closer to heaven in your mouth than me. The salad is magnificently acidic and the meatball is perfection. The other item you must order is the FRIED MOZZARELLA because the spicy San Marzano tomato sauce is absolute crack. I'm addicted! We had these appetizers both nights. They are not light! You could fill yourself up with just the meatballs and mozzarella - you've been warned!  I had the chicken parm my first night and although delicious I couldnt finish. If i ate a quarter, I'd say that was a lot. The second night i had penne alla vodka and although delicious i also couldnt finish. You'd think I learned my lesson. I highly recommend the chicken parm. It doesnt come with pasta but note that it's a massive chicken cutlet.   Beautiful news: you can order a bowl of sunday gravy so you can soak all of your food in it before you go into your food coma. You must order the bowl when you order your food. If you order halfway through your meal it may take time before the bowl of heaven gets to your table."}
{"text":"This italian restaurant is located inside Paris hotel and casino. We came here for dinner one Thursday evening. We did not have a reservation but got a table without waiting. We were given a table near the bar and entrance which was busy. We tried the highly rated chicken parmigiana and spaghetti. We were pretty satisfied with the service and food. The place is located across the hotel buffet. The prices are higher compared to similar restaurants."}
{"text":"Very limited lunch menu, food overall was good, not the best Italian Ive had but not the worst either. When we asked for bread our waitress said they only serve bread during lunch hours..hm, ok. Im giving them only 3 stars because the experience was boring, we were the only guests at the restaurant. Probably wont go back.."}
{"text":"I came to Martorano's with a request: seating for a party of 25, within 30 minutes. After a few escalations, we haggled it for 45 minutes, and only if my party agreed to do things \"family style\" - that is, order a bunch of stuff from the menu, and everyone shares. No problem! This was a great compromise, and I was so grateful they let us do this. Awesome service, both in that regard and once we were all seated. All of our servers were attentive, kept the wine flowing, and were able to talk in an educated way about the food that was being served to us.  There were a couple of pain points though. First, while they wanted us to do family style, they didn't have a policy in place for it. We actually just had to order 3-5 of each menu item, and pay the same price. Not quite what we expected (the manager led me to believe there was a specific family style menu). Second, the food is just fine, but some of it just isn't worth the cost. $30+ spaghetti? It's good, but not quite that good. No one at all in our party liked the  Linguine in White Clam Sauce.  I'd recommend the veal, meatballs, and calamari bibzy. And making a reservation for large parties ;)"}
{"text":"Hands down the best meal I've had in Vegas in my life. I not only love this place but I've been here 8 times. Everything was perfect. Literally. From the amazing food to the amazing service to the amazing bar to the amazing prices to the amazing location. I can't say enough about this meal! One love cuz, one love."}
{"text":"Our server Paul is the man. He took the restaurant experience to the next level. When you get details about the history, about the mozzarella being made fresh daily, the can't miss meatballs, and his favorites...you are set up for success.   The caprese salad is bomb. Fresh mozzarella, tomato, crispy basil and aged balsamic. Yes. Get it. That was probably my favorite.   The meatball is 1 big meatball with a side of a tasty salad. Paul split the meatball for us and some salad, awaited our joy, and we let him know he was right - it's tasty. I wouldn't say the hype is THAT accurate, but it is a nice app. The salad it comes with is a little higher on vinegar which is a nice cut to the meatiness of the dish.   We also split the spaghetti pescatore - aka seafood spaghetti in a tomato sauce. The pasta here is cooked al dente (firm) and this is how I'm used to eating pasta so I was super happy about it. If you're used to a more cooked pasta, don't be shocked.   It was too much food. We were both like a package of crescent rolls - a second away from popping. If you're sharing, I'd recommend 1 app and 1 entree. Or 3 apps.   It's vegas, so somehow this wasn't weird, but they have a dj and disco ball scenario going on in the restaurant. It threw me off because the food quality and service is more upscale, and then you have club music in the background. It didn't detract for us just a talking point. Another, don't be surprised, thing.   I know I already preached about Paul, but I can't say enough good things about him. He's full of fun facts, is super likeable, and at the end you want to invite him to join your table.   Good food, great service, dinner for two around $120 (2 apps, 1 entree, 2 glasses of wine)."}
{"text":"Ohhhhh man, I don't even know where to start with this delicious experience! My best friend and her family make it a tradition to come to Martorano's every time they are in Vegas and this time, I was the lucky guest that got to learn WHY they love this place so much! I'm not sure why they only have 3.5 stars because I thought it was absolutely incredible from beginning to end and left the most full that i've ever been. HIGHLIGHT: The menus LIGHT UP so that you can see what you're reading! I've never seen this before and it is such a cool concept! :)   We ordered a delicious bottle of Malbec to start, and enjoyed it along with their family-style apps {that they dish up for you!} and soft and airy bread with parm and dipping oils. For the appetizers, we ordered their famous Meatball & Salad {a MUST! I could probably eat this for my meal}, the Eggplant Stacked made with house made mozzarella {ANOTHER MUST}, and the calamari. We were honestly full after these apps but then the REAL meal came! I ordered the Chicken Sicilian and it was so delicious. Chicken tenders, mushrooms, capers, and hot cherry peppers. Warning, it does have a kick but I love that! The entrees do not come with a side but I ordered a side of spaghetti so that I could taste their famous marinara sauce. The entrees are HUGE and if you order apps, I highly recommend splitting them. I also tried my friend's Veal Piccata and that was delish too!   All in all, a VERY great experience. Pro Tips: Order an app or two, share entrees and a few sides. This place is pricey and you don't want to be left with a ton of extra food like we were because when you're on vacation, leftovers go to waste! :)"}
{"text":"Got to go to the VIP soft opening last night and it was everything I had hoped!! Also, took my kids but got in by 6:30, so noise wasn't a problem through dinner and they were happy to dance when the tunes started to crank. The food was really impressive--and I eat out at good places a lot!! Fresh, EVERYTHING cooked to perfection, nothing cold or even slightly overdone, and flavors were wonderful! Kids were in heaven! All the sauces were completely individual, no one note bases here, and presentations were creative without being weird. Also, wine by the glass selection was special and perfectly paired to the menu. Had a beautiful Brunello I hadn't seen since I was in Italy! Knocked it outta the park Cuz!!"}
{"text":"Excellent.  Staff is very friendly and Jeff the GM is outstanding.  If you haven't been please go.  Great Vegas experience with amazing food!!"}
{"text":"The veal piccata is $34.00 And the spaghetti piscatora is $38.00 Oh my the best veal piccata was the best I ever tasted....! The wine sauce was amazing...! It came with two nice pieces of veals...! And the spaghetti piscatora came with a lot of seafood...! I was surprised...! Brando was our server and the service was too good! Wow! The manger came and checked on you....! At least once was in Vegas trips...! Worth every penny!"}
{"text":"I read many of the negative reviews and almost cancelled, but was glad I didn't. My family of 5 enjoyed good Italian food at a reasonable price. The calamari appetizer had good flavor. Our server was attentive, but not over bearing. I saw people complain about the lack of substitutions on the part of the restaurant, this is simply not true. They more than compromise, except on the 3 course fixed price menu, which is more than understandable.  My wife had the ceasar salad, which was light, but still had the sardine flavor  one would expect. Although, they do not have a children's menu, the appetizer pizza was more than enough for my 9 and 13 year old to share.  If you choose to go, be aware that this is probably not the quietest restaurant on the strip. If you don't already have a total rewards casino card, you may want to stop downstairs and pick one up as they offer about a 10% discount on most items with the card. Overall, the food was good and the price was on the lower end for Las Vegas."}
{"text":"I went to cafe martarano for dinner tonight and it was terrible.We waited for so long to get our food.  We had spaghetti and meatball which was bland and the noodles weren't cooked all the way so they were still crunchy. We also had the chicken Alfredo dish, it tasted salty and plain. The service was not good and it was overpriced. I will not be coming back and we have had better food at olive garden."}
{"text":"Been here many times and the food though expensive is awesome. Jeff and Nate were terrific and very personable. Highly recommend the short rib pasta."}
{"text":"The server did the best that he could given the restrictions of the menu and lack of substitutions (even with an allergy). The food is bland and overpriced. There are FAR better restaurants in Vegas to spend your money in."}
{"text":"Martorano's can't decide what kind of restaurant it wants to be. Its both tacky and faux elegant. Its kitchen is open yet its ingredients and prep are very basic.  Its prices are high and its quality of food is middle at best.   Steve Martorano is painted as a South Philly goon (Posters of him with \"Yo Cuz!!\" in large print are plastered everywhere\") who somehow learned how to cook despite no formal training. You will see his book, his image, and videos of him talking about cooking during your time there. It's like walking into someone's ego. They are really selling this guy's image along with the food.  The Ego would be fine if the food matched it. Or, at the very least, justified the prices.   None of the food was bad, but it wasn't very good either and, at about $50 a person, I'm hard pressed to recommend this place when there are SO many better Italian options on the strip in the immediate vicinity."}
{"text":"This is a straight to the point kind of joint. The menu is the menu, no substitutions, no hold this or add that or sauce on the side. Just order and eat. That's it.   Best parts: Cadillac Margarita, strong yet tasty. Meatball, GREAT flavor. House made mozzarella, yummy. Light up menu, nice touch. Bussers were nice and efficient.   Decent parts: Everything else. Cesar salad, nothing special. Calamari, nothing special. Veal Marsala, below average. Spaghetti pescatori, lots of seafood, but just good. Gnocchi, bland.  Bad parts: Over priced, shoot em up movie playing on the tvs, no outside drinks allowed (not even cocktails from the casino bar). Not offered fresh Parmesan cheese and no salt or pepper to be found.   We would come back for meatballs at the bar but that's about it."}
{"text":"I love going to different restaurants when in Vegas, but a must stop is Martorano's! Never have I ate such a delicious carbonara than here! You can't go wrong with anything on the menu. The staff is always friendly every time I have visited. Definitely a place to check out if you haven't!"}
{"text":"First, I probably would never return because of the level of noise from the music.  We could not hear each other talk.  And as the night got longer the music got louder.  That is all part of the atmosphere we were told.  They do a great job of pulling off a Philly-style place, but we did not enjoy that. The food-ourparty split the meatball and salad, and the eggplant salad.  Both were wonderful, along with the warm bread.  I could have stopped there and been satisfied, but order a special for the night entree-a short rib dish-disappointed,  the flavor was not good, pasta was bland, and all was too salty.  My husband had a special-seafood dish, loved it. Others liked their choices.  My monitor was great. Service seemed good because when the staff was at our table they were attentive, but when we wanted the check and when my food came a couple minutes after the others the service was slow.  Sorry to say the music level ruined it all."}
{"text":"Great:  Bread Calamari Appetizer Linguini & Clams, portion too much Scallop Special, portion a little light Fried Peppers  Not so Great: Service Fusilli Pollo, portion too much  Didn't have dessert, but they looked great at other tables.  Better choices around."}
{"text":"Get the calamari. It's sooooo fresh and soft. You can cut them in half with a fork they are so soft. We are mostly used to frozen calamari so having fresh calamari is night and day. I would come back just for the spicy calamari. The staff is so professional and attentive. The atmosphere is great with people walking by gawking at the beautiful plates presented from this restaurant. There is a 3 course meal for 50$ or look to spend about 60-80$ per person for dinner, appetizer, sides and drinks. Also try the mini ice cream cone sampler for desert. Is casual wear for men and women but I saw people in shorts at dinner time."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Bryce and Rudy were fantastic servers. Highly recommended if you're in Vegas!"}
{"text":"First off let me say that this place is delicious. For Italian fare in Vegas this place is the right place to go. I have eaten at some of the best in Vegas as well such as Nove. A restaurant should be judged on a few main categories. Food, Service, Ambiance, Uniqueness.  The reviews about the movie clips playing is just dumb. First of all, don't bring your little kids to a place like this. If you want them to eat somewhere nice then bring them to chain like Chicago Grill or McCormick or any other run of the mill fancy place that you can bring kids to. The movie clips are part of this places character and I think it is awesome to be quite honest. This is a cult classic Italian restaurant with a little bit of punch in the face too it. That is what it is going for and if you want some delicious Italian at a place out of the usual boring run of the mill fancy Italian place, this is where you go.  It seems to me the people reviewing this place poorly have no character themselves and enjoy being bored. Go somewhere boring if something different is not your idea fun."}
{"text":"Disappointing to say the least. This is the second time we have been here and I was left not wanting to go back. The service was decent, but the food and the price were really surprising, and not the good kind. We started off with the calamari in the chili sauce, which I think there is a photo on yelp of this dish. The calamari was fresh and so tender, but because it was breaded and then drenched in a TON of sauce, it left it mushy and overwhelming, we couldn't even finish it. Why cover it so much sauce that you completely ruin the entirety of the dish? Usually, you would find this on a place that serves old or frozen calamari, which this doesn't seem to be the case so I just don't get it. It would have been much more enjoyable with a drizzle, or little side of sauce to spoon onto your dish.   Next the entree, I ordered veal parm, which was decent but nothing spectacular. The side of spaghetti I got was remarkable, I must say, it was some of the best spaghetti I have ever had but everything else was quite lack luster and mundane. Not something I would be willing to drop another $200 bucks on. Again, value for money and while I get this is Vegas, I think so many places in touristy spots don't need to count on repeat business that they don't really care if they gouge people because someone else will be checking into the Rio (where this place is located) the next day."}
{"text":"We had a great time here!!! Great staff and the spaghetti and meatballs were awesome!!!  My friends really loved the sea bass but were sick afterwards..."}
{"text":"Just amazing Italian food I had in the long time.  Perfect temperature with fresh everything.   I would recommended 100%."}
{"text":"Hands down the BEST restaurant in Las Vegas! From the service to the food was just simply AMAZING!  Our waiter Brandon was Top Notch! From the homemade mozzarella, eggplant, meatballs, spinach, sea bass, bread, speciality drinks..... ALL extraordinary! Spent my birthday dinner here and it was worth every single penny. Take my word for it, this is the SPOT in Vegas for the best dinner in town!"}
{"text":"We dined at the Paris Hotel location.  I just don't get it.  The food is average at best.   The waiter and the manager were both obnoxious.  It seems to me they are all just Gordon Ramsay wannabes.  \"Yo cuz\".  Really?  How stupid.  Go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Great Place , food is as good as Ft Lauderdale the original . Every dish is amazing  Dessert is amazing"}
{"text":"While eggplant stack was good, very Disappointed in quality of sea bass - tasted few days old.  Ambience was bad night club suck.  Bill came up $150 for two of us with only ordering a drink each which was a rip off."}
{"text":"I've eaten here at couple of times in the past and the food here has always been very solid. This time was no exception.  They have a weird policy not to bring out any bread until the food has been ordered.  Maybe many have left after filling up on their bread and then decided not to order.   So once we ordered our food they brought out some of the bread served with romano cheese, olive oil and a spicy oil to dip the bread in.  We started off with the bibzy fried calamari.  Tender and delicious with a sweet n spicy sauce sprinkled with sesame seeds.    I opted for the protein side of the entrees and ordered the veal piccata.  A generous portion of veal that was ohhhh so tender and delicious.  I could easily cut it with a fork, no knife needed.  The veal was sitting in a delicious sauce of wine, butter, lemon, olive oil and surrounded by tasty capers.  The meal was very filling and by the time dessert was offered I was too full to partake.  I'll definitely have to save room for some tiramisu the next time around."}
{"text":"Me and my home boy just had some grub. We had the ribeye cheesesteak and meatball and salad combo. The chef hooked us up with some sesame honey glazed wings.  But in all seriousness... Service was great, food was awesome, drinks were delicious. Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I made a reservation for my team dinner at Martorano's last week and we had a great experience.  All of the details were considered (including the light up menus - love!), the service was impeccable, the decor was modern, and the food was fantastic!  I started with a peach martini - perfectly mixed and quite tasty.  I shared a caesar salad and fresh burrata to start - spot on!  My entree was the penne with vodka sauce and it was sinfully good.  We shared a panna cotta with fresh berries to close out the meal and it was perfect - light and delicious. Definitely worth a visit when looking for Italian comfort food on the Strip!"}
{"text":"The food won't disappoint. Must have: the eggplant. I don't even like eggplant - it was that good. The pasta is excellent too. Don't miss out on this celebrity magnet restaurant. It's pricey, but a good go-to spot for a nice dinner out. Go late and see Penn & Teller after their show. On a special night, you might see the restaurant's favorite: Ludacris."}
{"text":"What the hell is this place? Fancy looking... but with TVs all over the place. Showing movies (Leon: The Professional was on while I was dining... superb movie, but not really fancy dinner fare). The service was pretty good, but the servers had to wear a shirt that said 'Yo Cuz' on it. Ew.   I really can't get over how surreal the environment was. Just absolutely bizarre. That said, the food everyone had was pretty good. Not really worth the prices, but my calamari and veal parm were good. The cannoli for dessert was sub-par.   I guess if you're really into the Jersey Shore culture and what that while eating a not-inexpensive meal, check this place out. Otherwise steer clear."}
{"text":"This restaurant is located on the 2nd floor of The Rio Hotel/Casino.  The interior is a cool dim blue lighting that subtly changes to violet lighting.  I had a yellowtail snapper that was seared and excellent.  Overall, the place is pricey but with excellent service.  If you haven't won big that night or if you aren't on an company expense card, I wouldn't eat here.  If that's not the case, do check this place out."}
{"text":"Messed up my (simple) order and took a long time to get it right. Waiting so long for average Italian food is nothing to be impressed about.   The place has a good ambience.  That's probably the best thing.  The service was just okay, not even counting the messed up order.   The food was okay and good presentation. However, very overpriced. The pasta noodles were of good quality.  The sauce was nothing special. (I got the red \"gravy\" with the meatball. The meatball tasted fatty.   The Manager did come over and apologize for the mix up on my food.   No way would I take my wife here for a nice dinner. Much better places in the same price range.   It's not romantic. It's not special. It's overpriced."}
{"text":"Amazing food and service!!! The spaghetti al pomodoro and chicken Marsala were delicious!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for about 3years. During the World Series of poker there are few restaurants to eat at in the Rio. My first few times coming here (3years ago) I had an amazing experience the food and service were 5star and it was one of the things I looked forward to while staying at the dingy Rio Hotel. Anyways I ate there 2x in July. The first time just my boyfriend and I dined there and after our meal our stomachs went hay wire for 2days! We got so sick! Then we went back with another couple. Because we werent 100% sure that it was Martoranos that made us sick, but low and behold after the 4 of us went to dinner EVERYONE had horrible issues with their digestive system. I dont know if the food was spoiled or if they just over did it on the grease but we never plan on returning there. It tasted great but the after affects were not worth it. It almost makes me loose my appetite when I think about what exactly they are doing in their kitchen that made everyone so sick."}
{"text":"This place is great for large groups and entertaining customers on business trips... but bring your big boy credit card, cause it can cost you! Was here Monday night with a good friend and customer, and we had some sick insane food. The fried Mozzarella with the San Marzano tomatoes. The Linguine Marinara, and the Fried Lobster all killer. Make a Rez because this place gets packed and you will wait a lifetime. Definitely one of the better places to eat in the Rio."}
{"text":"Amazing Italian food. Service exceptional. Try the veal scallopini. Prices a little high but we'll worth it. A must if you are visiting Paris Hotel."}
{"text":"Outstanding meal. Venue is fun and different. Had the fried mozzarella with a home made meatball on top. Fried mozz was definitely the best I've ever had. Meatball and sauce were the bomb! Linguine and clams for my dinner- simply amazing! This is one of my favorite dishes and it was outstanding. My husband had the chicken parm with a side of gnocchi. All phenom. Would definitely recommend! #YoCuz"}
{"text":"If I could give this restaurant a 1/2 star, I would. The service and food were less then desirable. The menu items sounded delicious, but the actual food served to me proved to fall short of that. While I have never personally met the chef, I can tell you the ladies in my neighborhood church have better gravy and better meatballs then this place.   To make matters worse, the management was completely uncompromising and pretty much ruined my best friend's birthday.   We had a moderately sized party with a special request to order two meals and appetizers separately from the rest of the group. The waiter informed us that they could not do that and that they WOULD NOT DO anything to assist. He sent a manager over and he said he could do nothing for our request, and due to the owner, appetizers could not be ordered separately from our meals. We explained to two different managers our situation and they regretfully informed us that the owner refuses to make any exceptions in how his restaurant is run. Management did nothing to accommodate, even when the situation was explained to them over and over again.   If you want good Italian food I can recommend several other places that severely beat this place. Picasso, Sinatra, Andiamo, Nove, Casa di Amore, MAGGIANOS, PIZZA ROCK, BUCA DI BEPPO...literally pick any other Italian restaurant and you will be happier.    Furthermore, if you have any business colleagues, clients, friends or family that you plan to recommend here, don't.  Steve Martorano and his restaurants will never have my business again."}
{"text":"Great food and awesome service. Water glass always full, waitress came back many times to check on us. Place was pretty busy.  Set us right away with our reservation. Chicken Scilian was very good and pasta was very tender."}
{"text":"Went for dinner. Sat at the bar Evis great and takes care of me. Starving but wanted something quick  Caesar sale fresh dressing great. Philly cheesesteak sandwich surprised me. Meat was delicious great bin. Will try and ho back before I go. Managers always seem to stop buy and ask how everything was."}
{"text":"Wow!! From Jeff the host who was helpful and friendly on the phone, to the hostesses when we arrived.... the bartender was spot on with drinks....Paul our server was on top of his game and he handled us RI gals pretty well lol the gentleman helping Paul was so nice as well.....food was delicious and will highly recommend!! Nice touch for the manager to stop at the table as well!!"}
{"text":"This was our first visit to Las Vegas restaurant. We've eaten at Steve's in Ft Lauderdale. Experience was amazing and waitress Jessica was amazing. Would recommend for foodies"}
{"text":"i wish this thing had an option to vote 0 stars because this place was a piece of shit.  The chef looks like a ghetto wrestler who should be fighting on UFC and his dishes are so unrefined, he probably NEVER went to culinary school, or else he used to be a sous chef at olive garden.  On the menu, he writes,...\"This is how i cook, dont break my balls\" he has got to be the most ignorant uneducated fool who got a chance to cook.  The service was mediocre, food is WAYYY overpriced. NEVER GO HERE.  The food? IT WAS TERRIBLE.  I like my pasta \"al dente\" but he didnt even cook his pasta.  The sauce was OK, a little salty, but i couldnt get over the pasta.  It was like biting into a straw.  This chef needs to learn how to cook pasta.  Thats foundation stuff.  He SUCKS!!!!  FOOD SUCKS, the restaurant vibe SUCKS, and i give it a big FAT ZERO.  He needs to go back to wherever the hell he came from, and maybe try cooking again after taking some high school level foods classes. ugh  ::UPDATE:: this is what the chef of this place has to say after reading a bad review of his place.  Instead of apologizing and inviting me back to redeem himself, he writes... \"From    user photo Steven M. Sent  3 days ago    You obviously have no idea what flavor is.. I'm sure you are accustomed to Olive Garden type food since you seem to be a pro .. However, Cafe Martorano uses only the best quality products... Come in and show your face we will definitely give you a tour and show you products I'm sure you have never seen and with your non existing culinary background I'm sure you cant pronounce \""}
{"text":"The very best in service but the food took very long to prepare on a slow night and it came out with little flavor.  highlight was caesar salad but price and flavor didn't match up.  Better places to go for italian.  oh yeah, bread was good but time to prepare courses meant we ate too much of it."}
{"text":"I'm a seasonal Las Vegas Resident, I've eaten at the best restaurants in town and I've got to say, Cafe Martorano's is one of my absolute FAVORITE restaurants in Las Vegas!!!  When I'm in town I eat here AT LEAST once a week...some of the best italian food I've ever tasted, and the service is impeccable. THE BEST Meatball in town....TO DiE FOR!!! My other favs are the Eggplant stack & the Philly Cheesesteak. SO YUMMM!!! http://thesuiteworld.com/blog/cafe-martorano-best-meatballs-italian-restaurants-vegas/"}
{"text":"No need to look for a better Philly Cheesesteak in Las Vegas because you won't find one. The meatballs are second to none as well. However, i do like Carbone's meatballs a little better, just my opinion lol I love nothing more than Italian American cooking from South Philly it reminds me of growing up in Jersey and my grandmas Sunday gravy every weekend. Shout out to Chef Steve Martorano and his commitment to serving the highest quality ingredients and employing a top notch staff.  YO CUZ!!  Dishes I recommend: Philly Cheesesteak Meatball Salad Sunday Gravy with Macaroni   First Cut Veal Chop"}
{"text":"To make a long story short - great everything! Great service, great menu, great drinks, great fresh daily mozzarella, great decor, great location.... and the list goes on. We had a large party of 10 and we loved where we were seated.   You know how you go to dimly lit restaurants and the older people in your party can't ever read the menu?! Welp, no problem here because the menu is digital! Fancy!   I dare say that you will not go wrong with anything you order. Everyone in my party was ecstatic with their meal and raved about it. I had the most divine braised short rib pasta! I still dream about it. The drinks are great as well.   It's well worth it. I paid for my date and I believe for the two of us ,it was only $200 with drinks. The dirty martini is excellent and I got some sort of pear basil drink that was delicious. Next time wine for sure because the gentleman sitting across from me said it was delicious with his steak. I tried both and he was absolutely right. Can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"All I can say is: terrible , really bad. A simple cafeteria food with a higher price. If you can avoid it do so. Not worth it."}
{"text":"There are no words to describe fresh made mozzarella.  The plastic we purchase at grocery stores does not qualify for this discussion.  After reading an article (years ago) about a woman's search for truly fresh mozzarella, I motivated to find the product of which she spoke.  I order this cheese everywhere it indicates \"fresh\" on the menu and until this dinner, I had not experienced this culinary bliss.  Order it before it is pulled, at which time it takes on the texture of which you are probably more familiar.  It changes the taste, you want the pre-pulled, just drained goodness.    The meal was very good and deserves more stars than I awarded.  The late seating (New Year's Eve) had us eating at 10-10:30pm, which is just too uncomfortable for me.  However, the reheated Chilean Sea Bass was stupendous.  Portion size of the fish was impressive.  It was served with risotto and saute spinach which were good but otherwise unremarkable, the fish was the star of this plate.    My low star marks evolve from the atmosphere.  Clearly this turns from restaurant to club around 10pm on most nights.  The sound system must be automatically set to turn up, way up, at this hour.  I could only nod and smile at comments made by my table mates as I could not hear them.  Given no conversation was going on other than the person seated immediately to my side, my attention often drifted to the movies showing on multiple screens.  WHAT ARE THEY THINKING?  I don't know the flick, but I watch a man get cut into pieces in a shower by mobsters.  Do I really need to go further?    For every downer, there was a counter upper.  The LOUD music was 70s-80s mostly and I will return here for a night of dancing, much preferable over the house throb everywhere else (even Stoney's plays this crap).    As for food, I'll take it to go or you can serve me in the wine cellar.  I don't want to eat in your space again."}
{"text":"Overpriced, average Italian in a hyped-up wise guy environment supposedly reminiscing of the old days of Phili lore.  Italian food should never cost this much.  I tried it twice, twice too many."}
{"text":"I love Martorano's! I have been to the Ft. Lauderdale location before and while in Vegas made a point to visit them and I was not disappointed. I love the upscale table and service, but in the fun format of large TVs, music and lights. The music was fun, but not so loud a conversation couldn't be had. The food is great. My significant others family is Italian and his grandparents were first generation Italian. The Eggplant Stack is amazing and I enjoyed the traditional dish of Meatballs. In times past, I have had the other less \"traditional\" dishes and each one has been awesome.  If you are looking for candle lit romance, this may not be the place, but if you want fun, candle lit romance with fabulous food and service this is THE place."}
{"text":"We had a horrible experience at Martorano's. Staying at the Rio, we were under the impression it was perhaps the best food available. When we arrived without a reservation we were told to return at around 8:15. The restaurant was fairly empty except for one huge party of at least 30 or more. We were bit served for ages, ignored, given the wrong food. This post is being made much later than the event."}
{"text":"Best meal we had in Vegas this trip. Several tables complained about the music being too loud. The response from the wait staff was that is the way the owner likes it regardless of what the customers say. Not a good response. That alone makes me doubt a return visit."}
{"text":"Yes...Lina And I did this up...Martoranos @ The Rio, Las Vegas.   The best Italian food, the Best Service and the coolest Ambiance......try the Meatball and Martorano salad..Chicken Marsala, pasta al dente.....huge servings, great fresh taste....just cooked my first Martorano Tomato sauce using your recipe...Thanks Steve!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent experience. Everyone is very helpful and courteous. Seated quickly and food was very good quality, quantity, and value."}
{"text":"Excellent service and food was incredible.  Great atmosphere with upbeat music.  Bar was very impressive and cool!  Wine list is pretty awesome too.  The servers attire is very New York !! Highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"Loved our first time here. Came highly recommended from a friend who grew up in Philadelphia like the owner here. Everything is fresh and delicious. Prices are very reasonable for LV. Meatball salad app and a eggplant stack app a must. Chicken Parm dinner was spot on."}
{"text":"We went here for dinner and enjoyed it! The carrot cake was \"to die for!\" The atmosphere is nice!"}
{"text":"Great dinner and great service.  Pricing are Vegas high but overall the food and service were better than most."}
{"text":"Love this place and love the atmosphere here! They play movies (The Departed was on when we went) and cool music. Its dimly lit with cool purple lights. Our server was bomb! Now for the food... It was so delicious. My caeser salad was so freakn good! My fiance doesn't even eat salad and he was eating this salad. I got spaghetti with meatballs. Yummy! Their portions are huge too. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Excellent service and scrumptious food.  Meatball and salad was perfect appetizer.   Attentive service never let my water glass go below 3/4.  And the pasta.....yum!  We ordered the bugatini and it was cooked perfectly al dente.  When in Vegas , head to Paris casino and dine here"}
{"text":"If you are in las Vegas go to the Rio Hotel and find Cafe Martorano. It is beyond well worth it. The is quite possibly the best meal I have ever had in my life. It never gets old. I have been there every time and the food is to die for. Rumor has it The Rio paid Steve Martorano 1 Million dollars to open his famous Ft. Lauderdale eatery there. I know why.  First of all this is the coolest place to eat. The dining room is surrounded by large screen TVs playing clips from the best movies on the planet. The will have music playing then all of the sudden you hear the best lines from Pulp Fiction, Casino, The Godfather, No Country For Old Men, etc., and the whole restaurant stops eating and joins in. \"Check out the big brain on Bret\" exclaims Jules from Pulp Fiction. Awesome. Then comes the food. I would highly recommend tossing the menu aside and let them bring you out a sampling. Meat Balls the size of a baseball, scampi that will melt in your mouth, philly cheese steaks that are better than in Philly, and the list goes on and on. This is S. Philly Italian cooking at it's best. Don't be surprised if someone gets on their table and starts to dance, it happens. I love this place. If Steve is there, say hi, you can't miss him."}
{"text":"I'm actually surprised to see this restaurant has less than 5 stars. I have been in Vegas for about a week now for a convention and out of all the restaurants, this place by far had the best service. I came with 3 people and we did a tapas style dinner. We ordered a bunch of appetizers: calamari, meatballs, and mozzarella, which were all delicious! Our favorite was the calamari, which is perfect for anyone who loves spice. I was also really impressed by our server who came by and split the appetizers evenly for us. It was the right balance of quality and service."}
{"text":"Fantastic dining experience - the staff was spot on and the food was excellent. Try the meatball!"}
{"text":"The ambiance was nice with blue undertone lights and disco balls. They have tvs so it is not your typical fancy Italian restaurant. They were showing sports and old movies which we enjoyed. The bread was soft but got cold fast however they make sure it's replaced quickly. Our server was nice and fairly quick with service.  The chicken parmesan was delicious and the penne vodka was simple yet tasy. Overall we enjoyed our experience."}
{"text":"The quality of food is barely a step above olive garden. The owner was the past house DJ at Rain and inside the restaurant are lights like in a club and the music is so loud you can't even hear the people at your table. The music was so loud people actually walked out. When we asked the owner if the music could be turned down a bit we were told \"this is my joint and that's how I like it, so no I won't turn it down\". A few minutes he sent over a pasta dish as an apology and the pasta was not completely cooked. The only saving grace was that our server was fantastic. You can tell he was embarrassed but his performance was fantastic. The final straw for us was when we ordered a bottle of wine and there was a bug in the decanter and our $200 bottle of wine was wasted. I give this place 1 star because I can't give it any less. Do yourself, friends and family a favor and find some place else to eat!"}
{"text":"This is hands down one of the best restaurants in Las Vegas! The Chicken Parmesan is phenomenal with fresh mozzarella; the gnocchi are like little pillows of heaven; the meatball/salad is a must-order. Even the olive oils that accompany the bread are worth raving about.. hello red pepper infused oil. It's one of only a handful of Italian restaurants I'd ever recommend. Our server Paul & all of the staff were nice, helpful & attentive. (P.S. I'm posting from the table because it's so good you have to know now!)"}
{"text":"Far overpriced for the quality of food.  Food was extremely salty, and for the price, did not impress me one bit. Literally one item was slapped on a plate and served, leaving you to pay an exorbitant amount for a side dish. I feel like a was a sucker to pay for food  that was just average. Even Olive Garden is better.  I will say, however that the coffee was FABULOUS, as well as the bread, which is the only reason I gave 2 stars."}
{"text":"Wow.   Holy Crap.  I just had the best Italian meal ever not only Vegas but anywhere .   I would give this place 6 stars if I could"}
{"text":"Excellent Italian restaurant modeled after East Coast Italian! Bryce took very good care of us! Pasta excellent!"}
{"text":"I'm half Italian. My Nana raised me on homemade and handmade pasta, delicious meatballs, incredible gravy, sumptuous salad. She was a spectacular cook. Although she passed on to the great kitchen in the sky, I keep her alive by cooking her recipes and enjoying many of the dishes she would make for me.  So why do I begin my review of Martoranos with that introduction?   Two words - the meatball. Italians do not order meatballs out. Your family's meatball is part of your heritage. No one else's can come close. Or that's how it is supposed to go.   Sadly, the meatball that Chef Martorano cooks puts my Nanas to shame. That is almost sacrilegious to say but there - I've said it. There's a reason this restaurant is famous for its meatball. It's AMAZING!   But I'm getting ahead of myself. Let's start with the cool decor of the blue lit bar and the plasma TVs all around the restaurant showing Classic movies or the DJ playing tunes to dine by.   We ordered the meatball and salad appetizer and were blown away by it. Our waiter also suggested the made-fresh-that-morning fried mozzarella in gravy which was out of this world.   For our main course my lady had fresh fish over risotto. Loved it. I had veal parm with peppers, onions and gravy that was phenomenal. The side of ricotta gnocchi was light and spectacular.   This was one of the best Italian meals I ever experienced. Hands down the best meal I had in Vegas in years.   Service was 5 star. The meal was 5 star. A MUST for lovers of great Italian food!"}
{"text":"WOW!! What a hidden gem in Vegas!  We went to the Rio to go see a show, and decided to grab a bite before. We foolishly did not make reservations (I suggest that you do!) but the hostess offered us a cozy spot at the bar. Which we took.  Had a meatball appetizer, which was recommended by another patron. YES! SO delicious!! I would go back just for that! Then had the specials. One scallop dis and my partner had a sea bass dish. Both were full of flavor, tasted super fresh, and over all great dishes!  I would go back in a second!  p.s.- Locals with a T.Rewards card and NV ID get 25% off! If you are seeing a show, you get 20% with ticket stubs! What a deal for an amazing dinner!"}
{"text":"I love the Martorano's in the Rio Hotel! I am a Steve Martorano fan, for sure!  I was excited to try this new location. My mom was in town so I thought it would be perfect!  It was not perfect, but it was really good. And I am sure once they settle into this new location it will become amazing, like we  are used to at the Rio. The food was good, although it took a really, really long time to arrive. The service was good in a awkward, trying to hard kind of way.   My mom did not lover her entree, unfortunately. So we asked for it to be boxed up, because she only ate 2 bites. Both the waiter and manager knew she did not like it, and after the long wait, If I was the manager, I would have probably comped it.   I am looking forward to going back in to have some amazing Italian food. Once the \"New Restaurant\" jitters are gone, and they have there Martorano's mojo going!"}
{"text":"I have been here multiple times.   I went there this last week and I was highly disappointed. I mentioned my problem with one of our two servers.  Nothing happened.  Then I also wrote about it in the electronic comment section that comes with the bill.  Nothing so I decided to leave a review.    I will start with another patron was extremely drunk and causing problems he was in the table next to us.  It made it hard to enjoy our dinner.  Secondly, they brought me the wrong salad but they fixed that and brought me the Caesar salad I ordered. The problem is it was bad.  The lettuce had many wilted pieces in it and the croutons were mostly stale.  I usually love their Caesar salad.  I quit eating it and showed it to the servers assistant who was helping our table.  They did not do anything about it.  Our entrees were good to a point. I have to say that over all it was a bad experience."}
{"text":"Ok, I have to admit that I was skeptical of eating here just because of how dead it was during prime dinner hours. However, I am happy to announce that I was wrong & anyone that doesn't try this place at least once is missing out. LOL! I had been craving a good beef carpaccio for a long time and that was the 1st thing I saw on their menu. Their service is awesome(we sat at the bar,) their pours are heavy, & their food is top notch. My husband and I shared the fried mozzarella that was topped with a delicious marinara, and their creamy penne pasta that had peas, mushrooms, and chicken. YUMMMMM!! Their pastas and the rest of their dishes are all homemade. No frozen stuff here! The atmosphere was superb as well. I love the lighting. Perfect quiet spot for a cozy dinner date. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The people who gave this place bad reviews must have gone in here thinking it was a regular ol restaurant. Its not This is an experience. The food is plentiful and amazing. The owner came and talked to me and my girlfriend and sent us over a few extra plates of his choosing which were great. This place is Loud and fun. You are in Vegas! it is supposed to be different. go there know its going to be different and have a great time."}
{"text":"This one is a toughie. Rio is my sister's home for 6 weeks in the summer for the WSOP, so we of course frequent every restaurant there. I like the food. I really do. And the service is great. But there is something so Jersey Shore about this place. I know it is Vegas, but after 8 hours in a casino with smoke and lights and ding!ding!ding! of slot machines, I want to have a quiet dinner. Martorano's goes from Italian eatery to nightclub around 7pm when the music starts blaring and the disco balls start spinning (seriously). It just gets too loud for me. One of the guys dining with us this trip said he was waiting for them to move the tables back so we could all start dancing.   That all said, the food is great. The caprese is delicious, fresh tomatoes and mozzarella, a drizzle of balsamic and olive oil and a fried basil leaf. I love how simple and clean the flavors are. Then there is the meatball. OMG. It is so fluffy and flavorful. Served on top of some sort of tubular noodle whose name I can't recall with a fresh tasting sauce and a scoop of the best ricotta I have ever tasted. Everyone at our table ordered that or the rigatoni with Sunday pork gravy, which was also fantastic. The pork was so tender and the sauce again so fresh. You really feel like your Italian grandma made it."}
{"text":"I do not like rating places 5 stars because not too many things can be as goood as it gets.  But, this place is......As Good As It Gets.  The atmosphere is nice, the service great, and the food is incredible.  Yo Cuz Steve was there in person watching his crew cook up the food.  I lucked out at the seating because I could watch the events of the staff as I enjoyed the Company in my party.  The eggplant stack appetizer was pretty darn good.  The speghetti pescatori was outstanding.    The prices were not cheap but not out of this world like some of the other nearby places.  If you pay decent money, you want decent food and this was the case here.  Steve was especially busy during our time here because NFL Quarterback, Joe Montana was dining a few tables over.  But he took the time to come over and talk to us.  This was really special to one of us in our party as he is a frequent diner at his Atlantic City location.  He is one huge dude and takes his craft seriously.  It was nice meeting him.  I would highly recommend this place.  I will be back!"}
{"text":"If you are going to Cafe Martorano make sure you are hungry. These people aren't fucking around with the portions (think Bucca di Beppo portion size but also really fuckin good!) The place is also super loud, if you go before 8pm they are usually playing some sort of gangster movie (think Scarface, Casino or Goodfellas) on all 50 of the flat screened TVs located throughout the restaurant with the sound rotating between Sinatra or Bennet and the movie during a good killing scene. Makes for some great atmosphere. As it gets later in the evening the Executive Chef Joey Martorano (who looks like he was on the Sopranos) will actually alternate his time between the kitchen and the DJ Booth spinning some hip grooves. Literally its like you are having one of the best Authentic Italian dinners at Rain or Tao, its so loud. That being said the place is really good. I am a sucker for good orchiette and bolognese. Both of these rocked. The orchiette wasn't the best I've ever had (I've been spoiled with great orchiette) but it was pretty damn good. One of my clients had the Fra Diavolo with lobster and Crab and it was divine. The last time I went we had dinner at the bar and had one of the best bar dinners I've ever had thanks to Stephanie. She was on point with everything from food descriptions to cocktails and she was super hot and busted my friends balls shamelessly when he tried to throw half ass pickup lines at her. I will definitely be back. By the way the place is not cheap by any means."}
{"text":"Ordered prime rib sandwich and it was good. Meat was juicy and tender and the hoggie was fresh and it came with au juice."}
{"text":"I loved this place!  The food was incredible. We chose the price fix menu for $39 , plus appetizers. The meatball and salad was incredible.  The main course of rigatoni and chicken was perfect, and the cannolis were fluffy and sweet and very fresh.   The Service was ok- not 5 stars, but I liked everything else in this restaurant. YES it is loud and there are strobe lights- Frank Sinatra is blaring. But this place is fun, great food, great wine list, lots of things going on - if you are celebrating something fun- this is your place- if you are looking for a quiet relaxing place - this is not for you. I cant wait to go back -- There is no food that I have tasted like this in CA or NV- you have to go to NJ to italian food this good!"}
{"text":"My wife and I enjoyed the food, very attentive wait staff. No substitutions and Insistent on ordering everything right away, I like to get  appetizers and see how full I am before completing my order but it worked out ok.  Not inexpensive but quite enjoyable."}
{"text":"Had my brother's wedding reception here.  Staff was incredible!! Very helpful, kind, ready and willing to serve! Kept regular drinks filled and we're always around to get you anything you might need.  And food was amazing!!! We ordered appetizers, salads, meatballs, spaghetti, and the chicken Sicilian!! Everything tasted incredible but the the Chicken Sicilian... forget about it! It was amazing!!! Order it now! So incredibly flavorful and tart! My mouth is watering again thinking about it! Mmmmmmmmm!"}
{"text":"This place is great !   Came in and was greeted by hostess immediately, bar / restaurant had some old Blk/Wht movies playing.  My guest was super impressed with the light board menus. Manager came by the table during my meal to thank me for business.  Great vibes just like the spot in Frt. Lauderdale.  Your going to want to grab an order of Rice Balls, Truffle Fries, Clams Casino, Tagliatelli and a Veal Parmigiana and a glass of Barolo.  Thank me later."}
{"text":"ughhhhhh..... Let's negate the price here because the meal was free and I'll still say, quite possibly one of the worst meals I have ever had. My chicken parmigiana tasted like something I microwaved from a Michelinas frozen dinner. On top of that, the waiter was a condescending eegit with a superiority complex. Listen to me and listen to me now, DON'T COME HERE! There are so many good Italian places in Las Vegas, that there is no need to stop at this self-righteous restaurant in The Rio. Do yourself a favor and go to Valentino in the Venetian or Rao's in Caesar's Palace.   Cheers!"}
{"text":"Mediocre service makes for a poor experience...especially when the restaurant isn't nearly full on a Friday night in Vegas. Fails to live up to its hype."}
{"text":"If I could give 7 stars I would. The best Carbonara I will ever have in my life. I'm positive it will never be beat. My boss ordered chicken parmigiana with a side of spaghetti. Everything came out at the same time, at perfect temperatures and cooked to an astonishing perfection. I can't remember the name of my mixed drink, it was pear flavored, was a dream. The waitstaff was very attentive and knowledgeable without ever hovering. I highly recommend"}
{"text":"My mother and I came here for lunch, around 11:30am. We had never been here before and wanted to try it out. We had a really cool server, and the drink I ordered was amazing. Except the fact it was kettle one, and $14. Not cool. The salad was good honestly. Then the spaghetti and meatballs came out. The meatball (yes it is just one huge meatball) and honestly, it was not that good. Anyone can simmer some tomatoes and put salt in it. I was not impressed. And it was $27 for tomato sauce. I do not plan to go back here. Ever. Save yourself money seriously."}
{"text":"Definitely one of the best dinning experiences I've ever had and the food was ABSOLUTELY AMAZING! The staff was excellent! We started on night off with the meatball salad and egg plant stack which both were so delicious. The meatball had such and amazing flavor and the egg plant was cooked perfectly. Then for our Entrée we had the carbonara and I must say it was fantastic! I highly recommend visiting this place. If you don't mind spending money on delicious food this should definitely be the go to spot!"}
{"text":"Absolutely Awful...I just wish I would have read reviews FIRST.. I would have never have gone. SERVICE... Ridiculous. They were not even busy and they let us sit with our menus  menus closed for some time.  FOOD...so NOT good. You know how when you are eating Spaghetti  and the oil is overwhelming? Yep... That's it. Awful  Please please SAVE your MONEY. I suspect they are struggling. I wonder why? Why don't they try and listen to the customers reviews ?  Here is your chance Management... Email me and ask me to give you a full report.... I will be happy to help."}
{"text":"Our family had dinner at Martorano's in April, 2015. Most of the entrees were in the $25-$35 range. Two of my sisters ordered the special which was grouper. They both enjoyed it till they received their bill - $62 each! I realize they should have asked the price, but still, I think the waiter could have given them a clue."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a quick bite go out on the strip where quality and excellent service isn't important. Everytime I am in Vegas I eat at Martoranos because the food is excellent the service is EXCELLENT the atmosphere is excellent and if you the type that believes you get what you pay for then you will see and taste the quality you paid for! The warm Mozzarella is to die for and basically everything else on the menu. Its obvious that Mr Martorano prides himself in running a class act of a restaurant because I will NOT eat anywhere else because Chef Martorano and his staff at this location care and it shows big time!! Give it a try you wont be disappointed! All these negative reviews I think are incorrect or fraudulent regarding service and times for food delivery because NOT ONCE  in the over 20 times Ive been here have I waited more than 30 min max."}
{"text":"Ok, let's start with the important stuff:  Martorano's food is outstanding.  I am from South Philly (as is the owner) and I have to say that his \"gravy\" and meatballs were excellent.  The service was very attentive and, since I was the only one in my party, the waiter was very kind and patient - willing to answer any questions.   I started with an appetizer of Italian Meatball and Salad.  I wanted to try both - and if I did it separately, it would have required me to get a second mortgage:  $18 for the salad / $15 for the one meatball (about 1/2 pound).  Both, together, was something like $20.  And both did not disappoint - the meatball was excellent and salad fresh and very well prepared.  (I'll discuss price later.).  Next, I had the Rigatoni \"Sunday Pork\".  This was so good, it brought back memories of the Sunday dinner's where the pork was cooked in with the sauce ($29),  I was too full for dessert.  Now, there are two issues to be aware of:  Pricing and Ambience.  With the price, come on Chef, one meatball for $15??  Anyone from South Philly believes they have the best meatball, including me, and I readily admit yours is excellent.  But, $15??  It was a good idea to pair it with your salad, but, still, an app for $20 is pretty hefty.  The price for the Rigatoni was pretty steep as well.  I know this is Vegas, but I didn't think I would need to go back to the Wheel of Fortune slot to replenish my wallet.  Here is the biggest issue I had (which almost got me to lower to 3 stars):  With regard to the ambiance, I would consider the restaurant area to be romantic - if not for the HDTV's.  There were 3 TV's side by side.  The middle played a video made by the Chef (OK, though a little narcissistic), but the other two were showing the movie Casino!!  UNEDITED!! With subtitles!!!  Which means that, in this dimly lit, romantic room, I'm being treated with videos of blood, brutality and vile language.  Not what I would have chosen.  Really, if you want to show a video, show Italian scenes or something.  Don't show movies - it's not Chucky Cheese!"}
{"text":"My sweetie and I had dinner here for the first time last night and were blown away by how fabulous everything was. From the atmosphere to the service (Paul is an outstanding waiter who is both friendly and knowledgeable) to the food, it was simply top notch. The Caesar salad is big enough to split and the dressing was flavorful. Both pasta dishes we had we perfectly cooked and seasoned. Wine was reasonably priced considering the quality. This place gets it right on every level. We will be back!"}
{"text":"my wife and i have eaten at martaranos for years...and we keep going back....its simply the best italian food in las vegas... we ate at martaranos on 5/18/17 for my wifes birthday.....our waiters raymond and juanito were excellent....top service...always checking to make sure that everything was alright.....the food was superb...i am of italian heritage....my whole family is from italy....and i can verify to you that martaranos food is 100% authentic italian food.. they use the finest ingredients...and there recipes are right on the money...the restaurant itself is beautiful....well decorated...the manager mike was very cordial...making sure that our dining experience was total satisfaction...then to top it off i found out that martaranos takes off 20% from your total bill including liquor, for all local residents....awesome way to end the evening....i highly recommend to anyone that wants excellent italian food, to try martaranos...you won't be sorry......its phenomenal......."}
{"text":"Expensive as far as Italian food goes but damn good.  Martorano's is located in the Rio hotel and worth leaving the strip for.  The meatball appetizer was great.  People rave about it and it did not disappoint.  A huge tasty meatball with a glob of great ricotta cheese.  For a main course, I had the veal marsala.  It was a huge veal chop which was so tender and good.  The gnocchi that came with it were nice and fluffy.  And the mushroom sauce was great.    My wife had the lobster francaise which was very good as well.  The risotto that came with it was kind of salty and didn't really taste all that great though.  But overall still a good dish.  Our server was great too.  Real Italian food is worth paying for.  So I totaly recommend this place.  Also Casino playing on the TVs was fun.  And that's that."}
{"text":"We were staying at the Rio with friends this past weekend, and failing to have made reservations at a decent restaurant, called down to Matarano's. They made us wait a half an hour for the reservation, and when we went down to the restaurant, had us wait in the bar for another 15 minutes. The bartender was rude and we had a hard time getting drinks. We were finally shown to the dining room, which was about 25% full. Right. Things LOOKED promising at first: three separate servers came up to our table to say they were part of the \"team\" waiting on us. Then one waiter berated another for talking to us. We asked for a wine recommendation, and were poured an absolutlely AWFUL 2007 Chianti that, if it wasn't faulted, really should not have been on the wine list. We are NOT people who send back food or wine, but there was NO WAY we were going to drink this. We ordered a bottle of California wine that we knew was going to be good. Then it took a good 20+ minutes to get anyone to return to our table. Our \"team\" of waiters was no where to be seen. We finally flagged someone down to beg them for bread--which we were CHARGED for!  My BF and I split a Caesar salad (which was the best part of the dinner by a mile) but were brought no extra plates. Nice. I ordered the pork chop special, which, while cooked properly, didn't have a lot of flavor. Interestingly enough, my BF, who ordered the Red Snapper special, had the SAME salty sauce on his fish! REALLY? Our friend who ordered the Chicken Parmigiana got a piece of chicken with cheese & what appeared to be canned red sauce slapped on the plate--no pasta, no veggies, no presentation whatsoever. Our other friend ordered the Seafood Fra Diavola, and said it was quite good.  We'd had dinner the night before upstairs at VooDoo Steak & Lounge, and it was excellent. Skip Matarano's and head upstairs. You'll be glad you did."}
{"text":"Been here many times.     Atmosphere feels a bit snobby and douchy.     If it wasn't for the fact that I am a philly native and crave traditional Philly Italian food, I wouldn't come here.  That said, I love the food at this place.   Not terribly sophisticated, way overpriced, and not much better than I believe I can make myself, but it is good.  Ricotta with anything is good.  meatballs are good, and traditional Philly.   Their cheesesteak is really tasty, but again traditional and not worth the $16 they charge.  Have had numerous dishes, all of which were good for a Philly native."}
{"text":"Love this place, my only reservation is the service has been hit or miss.  I have favorite servers now.    I'm from Philly, and let me tell you their $18 cheesesteak is .....worth every penny.  It is absolutely the best.  Their meatball is spectacular, my only issue is; why the heck they charge extra for a tablespoon of ricotta.  That kind of stingy-ness as well as the inconsistency with service is the only reason I cannot give them a 5/5.       Overall, I have never not been happy with their food.  And locals....there is a discount!!! Great place to go."}
{"text":"Horrid atmosphere, amazing food!  I have never found a restaurant that I loved and hated so much at the same time.  This is an example of a Las Vegas vanity restaurant with an 'experience' I would avoid at all costs but food that begs me to come back for more.  We were seated inside of the restaurant late in the evening, exactly at the time we reserved our table.  The staff were friendly, attentive and professional.  The service staff had spot on recommendations for drinks and appetizers. Stars all around for everyone.  Inside the restaurant was clouded with vanity pictures of chef Martorano in poses that show him as the 'Boss' he apparently is.  Music from the 90s was being pumped through speakers so loud the servers had to shout the specials and signature drinks, and even that was not good enough to hear anything they said.   Much worse, a string of scenes from Martorano's favorite films were loudly played on TV screens throughout.  Scarface, Rocky 3 & 4, and an old Steve Martin film were forced down our throats as we tried to enjoy delicious cocktails.  Why the TV's?  I felt like we were at home watching bad cable.  The food, however, oh the food!  Are you kidding me?  We ordered four items from the regular menu and specials, and everything was just amazing.  Super fresh, top of the line meat, seafood and pasta.  The standout was a sea bass special, absolutely melt in your mouth perfection.  The pasta was perfectly prepared, just as promised on the menu.  Martorano's is loud, loud, loud, so go for great dining with somebody you don't want to talk with."}
{"text":"Food was just ok service was bad. Ordered calamari was tough. For the prices they charge would not go back. Nothing worth shouting about. Water was always empty. They can't service the whole table at one time bring out food when done each plate what a scam"}
{"text":"This restaurant was amazing. The service was great, the food was drool-worthy, and my colleague and I felt well taken care of the entire time. We had the fresh mozzarella, calamari, and shared a chicken Parmesan special and the carbonara. I have nothing bad at all to say about any of the food- every bite of everything was amazing! - but my favorite had to be the calamari, a perfect blend of sweet and spicy without being overbearing. Definitely will be back next time I'm in Vegas!"}
{"text":"My boyfrind and I went to the Rio in search of a good dinner. We landed at Cafe Mortorano. We did the special where you get an appitizer, 2 entrees and a dessert for $44 each. We sat down and the waitress took a good 5 minutes to greet us. My boyfriend ordered his drink and I took water until I made my choice. It took her another 10 to 15 minutes to get the drink and to take our order. The food was semi up to par, however our server was horrid. She dropped off our entree's 30 minutes after our appitizer was cleared. She passed by our table several times without even glancing our way. Another server noticed and he was awesome at checking to see if our dinner was up to par.  No matter the food, the service was terrible."}
{"text":"Extremely overpriced for the quality they deliver. I ordered the carbonara and it was doused in salt and heavy cream. For $28 a plate, you'd expect something more than a heavy slob of cream, plated in a manner that looks like it came out of a cheap cafeteria. Very disappointed. DO NOT RECOMMEND!"}
{"text":"If you are VEGETARIAN , do NOT EAT HERE.. They have nothing for you, the chef won't even make alterations.  We were very disappointed, the prices are ridiculous and the food isn't even worth it... The manager tried to get us to come back again and try their fish, I was like no way... The food is really BAD....you can find a million better Italian restaurants.. When a place tells you we cannot make anything vegetarian, its trouble, I have learned my lesson.. The decor and the color scheme of the restaurant  is awesome, too bad the food sucks....  I  was very disappointed. I don't mind paying for good food, but when the food is bad and overpriced its horrible... DO NOT GO HERE..."}
{"text":"Nice surprise here in Paris hotel. Really good bolognese, pasta, they even created an Alfredo dish for us that the guy said was best he ever had. Good bread, good atmosphere and good for business dinner.  A little slow on service at the table. Fantastic bartender last Thursday night so lots eating at the bar."}
{"text":"Yeah Yeah.  Located at the Rio.  Everyone knows about the Carnival World Buffet and their Village Seafood Buffet.  That's how the hotel pushes it's marketing: \"go to our Carnival World Buffet\".  I don't think too highly about the buffet.  In the 90s, it was the buffet to experience because of the quality and price.  Now it's only about the price.  Well, surprisingly, I was surprised that the Rio has one hell of a restaurant on site.   Martorano's!!!!!  I went with three picky eaters.  We normally stay at the higher end casinos like The Wynn or Caesar's.  But we had to stay at the Rio due to Business reasons.  Well, we were tired so we chose this place.  What a great surprise.  In fact, it was the best meal I had during my 3 day trip, although the Wicked Spoon Buffet also ranks up there!  My friends are picky but they all three decided to have the Meatball Salad.  What a weird choice.  Meatball Salad????  But they LOVED it.  It was so memorable that we spoke about it weeks later.  Me on the other hand, I don't like to follow everyone else so I decided to order something else.  I ordered the Bucatini Carbonara.  I love Carbonara.  I've had it in some of the best restaurants.  Beverly Hills, Paris France, New York.  Well, hands down, this was the BEST Carbonara I have ever had.  Wow.  It was so beautiful I wanted to take a picture but my friends would have laughed at me.  They are obviously not a foodie like me and my fellow Yelpers.  The Bucatini, which is a thicker spaghetti, was al dente.  Perfectly al dente.  The Carbonara was delicious.  It had a raw egg yolk on it and you had to pop it.  It goosed out and made the Carbonara authentically delicious.  I added some fresh ground black pepper and it was PERFECT.  I actually think about it.  I recently had Linguini Carbonara at two fancy places in Los Angeles and was disappointed.  Martorano's has set the bar very high for me and has ruined Carbonara for me......unless I'm willing to make the trip to Las Vegas!!!!  This is one instance where \"What happens in Vegas Stays in Vegas\".  No......spread the word.  The Best Carbonara I have ever had was at the Rio Hotel and not at the Buffet!!!!"}
{"text":"Didn't even eat here. Had a reservation for 7:30. Stood there for 15 minutes and no one helped us so we left. This place is a joke. I've eaten here before and the food is not that good to stand there and wait like this. Never again."}
{"text":"Food was ok was not very impressed I thought it would be a lot better .. The rice balls were great the chicken parm was good but it didn't come with any pasta and for $28 it should my clam sauce the pasta wasn't cooked enough and it was very spicy . The drinks were ok very sweet"}
{"text":"Review only for drinks at the bar--- Great bartender! Sat down and was quickly presented with an iPad of all the various drink options. Lots of cool cocktail combinations made expertly and quick. Really impressed with the fast service here because so many other places I've been to here can be quite slow. Bartender was also cheerful and friendly. Will definitely go back for drinks. Only draw back was a bunch of obnoxious investment bankers lurking at the bar, but I can't really fault them for that."}
{"text":"This was my 3rd time here. Fantastic Italian food. Ordered the special steak and risotto. Cut like butter, awesome flavored mushroom bernaise . The spaghetti and famous meatball was a little dry this time, so did not eat all of that. They comped dessert to make up for it. You can't ask for extra sauce since all is prepared to order, so ask for more sauce in advance. Great wine list, and great waiter. Knew the menu well. Will be back when visiting Vegas."}
{"text":"I will start off with the food was incredible! The service was mediocre at best...the server seemed preoccupied and self serving. One the menu, everything seemed in line with the pricing you would expect with added sides. But  everything is ala-cart ($10 for side of spinach and $12 for side of spaghetti) and served in plates that are their own separate full plates so you are reaching three plates over to get your vegetable or pasta.  For the price and service the food greatness does not make up for the other ineptness!  I would not recommend  this restaurant with so many others in the vicinity...if I could have, 2.5 stars and a pass! Never again."}
{"text":"Just went to the original location in Fort Lauderdale a few weeks ago. That was awesome, and the food was amazing. This location, not so much. It just didn't wow me. It was still good, but just not the same. Even the ambiance was different. It was a busy Wednesday night in Florida. It was a quiet Monday night in Vegas. We were one of 5 tables that were occupied in the quiet place at 8p. But that's fine, I understand.   The meatball was drier than expected, the pasta was undercooked. The chicken parmesean was good, but it was just okay good. The sauce is still awesome.   I find it interesting to see that almost all of the positive reviews of this place include a mention that Steve was there. Could that improve the quality? Possibly. I watched him inspect just about every dish that left the kitchen at the original location. That definitely didn't happen here.   So it's getting three stars. Our service was good, the food just didn't meet the expectations set by...his own restaurant. And thats what brings me back. I likely won't be back to this location. Too many other great options in Vegas. But I am still looking forward to my next visit to the Florida location!"}
{"text":"Would definitely recommend this restaurant. We ate here on a Friday night and we ate a little earlier in the evening. The atmosphere was nice and was not too noisy which I have grown used to in Vegas. We ordered our drinks and I had the Black Beauty (at least I think that is what it was called) which was fantastic. For dinner my boyfriend ordered the lasagna and I ordered the bolognese. They were both delicious and very good portion sizes (I usually have trouble finishing a pasta plate but I was able to here). We really enjoyed the televisions playing old school Vegas movies like the original Ocean's 11 movie. For dessert we had their homemade ice cream and that was also a wonderful addition to our meal. Will be returning on our next visit!"}
{"text":"The food here was phenomenal. Raymond and Francisco helped us out with some recommendations from the menu and took the the time to explain everything. They were a great team and kept us happy throughout the meal. I tried the watermelon martini Raymond recommended and it was great. The pasta was cooked perfect as was everything else. Started with the calamari appetizer, chicken parm, risotto, you name it. It was all great ! Unfortunately we didn't have the appetite we should have coming here but I will definitely be coming back. This time with an appetite big enough to enjoy dessert afterwards. If we're lucky we'll get stuck with Raymond and Francisco again :) they were awesome!"}
{"text":"I came for a business dinner so I have no idea what the bill or the expense was, but the food was fantastic. I'm not sure if they pulled out the stops for our group of 20+ but everything down to the bread was perfect. The little olive oil trio they serve alongside it was a nice touch - and again, the bread was crusty and perfect.  We started with Martorano's Salad and moved into some apps that I don't quite remember but recall being very happy stuffing them into my face hole. A stack of fried mozz with fresh tomato...more please. The meatballs were heaven, the chicken cutlet (City Chicken Stack or some such thing) was divine and a few others were also wonderful. The one glitch was the underdone rigatoni but no matter. I didn't love the trout scampi style but I'm no fan to cooked fish.     There are several big screen TVs to around the room showing Italian genre mob flicks like Goodfellas, Casino and The Godfather so that's fun but it is a little loud and obnoxious if you're hoping for a more intimate experience. Service was tip top and family style dining kept the food rolling in and all of us content. Definitely one of the better spots to eat in the Rio at 4.5 stars.  FYI the cannoli was good but the red velvet cake was OFF THE HOOK!"}
{"text":"We really loved this place inside the Paris! We came here twice while on our vacation and both times we sat at the bar while they were only serving pizza and salads. The Caesar is to die for seriously! And the pizzas are unique and delicious. Great for a little bite mid day around 3pm. Both times the bar tenders were exceptional as well and made it a truly nice experience. Next time we are in vegas I'm sure we will be here again.  Ambiance is cool too with the blue lights!"}
{"text":"PHENOMENAL, I had the Chilean Seabass and I was with party of four, the rest had the stacked eggplant, (not a fan of the eggplant) but it looked good. The place is like a club as well; music were 70s-90s dance hits. Great music great food, great everything. Clean, Well explained about food and beverages, Well organized. I will be going back for sure!"}
{"text":"We had a party of 6 last Saturday night and I ordered the lasagna special the waiter was quick to note that they do not have the special available they were out what Italian restaurant on a Saturday night on the strip runs out of lasagna at 7:30 so I ended up ordering penne alla vodka dish and I asked to substitute for a different pasta he said he would check got back to me said no they do not do that . You would think they would help me out since the lasagna was already out.So when the dish came it was not penne alla vodka wasn't even close wasn't even edible the waiter was more than accommodating to exchange it but by this time I lost my appetite I managed to call the manager over and and  asked him what restaurant at your caliber runs out of lasagna on a Saturday night at 7:30 he said he only makes 15 pieces of lasagna per night the restaurant holds 125 and if you have two or three turnovers that's a lot of people I asked him why he cannot do substitutes on pasta he said that's their policy .At the end of our meal the waiter said he took my dish off the bill like he was doing ME a favor that is horrible customer service every time I go there I have a fantastic time but this time it left a bad taste in my mouth probably the alla vodka hard to say if I will return"}
{"text":"The food was a little on the pricey side, but you get what you pay for, meaning it was well worth it! The staff was very helpful. The food was delicious - I love Italian food!  We walked out of there stuffed and happy. Would definitely eat there again."}
{"text":"So here is the scoop!  Great food!  Great service & great deals for locals.  Downside... The TV's took away from the atmosphere of the place and it was soooo cold in the restaurant.   I would go back and if I could actually stop shivering and could hear my date over the TV ... this would have been 4 stars!   Orders are large so feel free to share!"}
{"text":"A sad duplicate from the greatness in the Rio Hotel.  Staff was rude, my dinner plate had finger prints on it, my wine glass had lipstick.  We were being sea One cocktail menu to be shares by 6 of us, and you only get to see it once as it bounces from table to table. My food was bland and tasteless."}
{"text":"Wow, what an unxepected dining pleasure! First walking in noticing the dark ambiance of a supper club, the cool Philly Sounds music playing and then the food.... mozarella was the best I ever tasted. Wonderful smooth texture, prefectly seasoned. Caprese tomatoes were spot on. I had a simple marinara spaghetti which had a nice flavor, noodles cooked perfectly. Kris' Chicken Maralsa was cooked very good, great flavor. With all that and American Gangster playing in th background, it was all good and more!"}
{"text":"I was really impressed with the food at Martorano's in the Paris Hotel. The decor is quite modern with specials and cocktail menus displayed on iPads and a light up menu.  The customer service from the hostess to the waiter were all top notch.  THE FOOD WAS DIVINE!  I tried the caesar salad, linguine in white clam sauce and the homemade mozzarella with olive oil.  I don't suggest this place for a romantic date night but for a fun night out it fits the bill with fun music and stellar food.  For the cost it would have been nice to not have all the buzz and noise from the casino and for Martorano's to have it's only restroom which is why I deducted a star."}
{"text":"Who knew that an Italian restaurant would have some AMAZING seafood?!?!  First off, the restaurant is billed as a nightclub/restaurant however don't let that fool you for dinner; mind you, we got there about 7pm for dinner so we may have missed the nightclub crowd. Sadly, we didn't have reservations & they were booked until 9:30pm. Luckily for us they serve the full menu at the bar and there were a couple of available seats, so we took them! And after the food, I'm so glad we did! First up were their meatball for an appetizer, which you can order with or without a salad, we ordered without & that was one giant, meaty, tasty ball of meat!! For our entrees, my Partner ordered the scallops & they were probably some of the freshest, most buttery, large scallops we've ever had!! Perfectly moist and perfectly cooked! Just, DAMN good! I ordered the Chilean Sea Bass & let me tell you that was one perfectly amazing plate of food. Fresh, tasty, buttery, flavorful, meaty & perfectly cooked! The Bass was topped with 2 giant grilled shrimps that I believe were some of the best shrimp I've ever had!! The risotto on both of our plates were spot on! When you're there, disregard the disco lights floating around but while you're at the bar, ask for Nathan, he was the AWESOME Bartender/Server!"}
{"text":"The food is really good but I think it's expensive for what you get.  I had the meatball and salad and hubby had the meatball with spaghetti (their version of it).  Pasta was cooked to perfection and really good.  The staff is friendly and is located in a good location in the Paris hotel."}
{"text":"My family and I had dinner here tonight in the paris hotel. Food was nothing special. Pasta had hardly any sauce on it and my sons riggi pasta dish was real hard and under cooked.  The atmosphere is a nightmare . Music blasting it have us a horrible headache could not wait to get out of there.  Why would anyone want to enjoy a nice meal with blasting music. We could not even talk to each other it was that horrible !"}
{"text":"Food was good. Eggplant stack amazing and homemade mozzarella to die for! Service was impeccable!"}
{"text":"Highly disappointed with the food especially after our waiter gave us a long monologue about using the fresh and best ingredients.  Brandon, our waiter is the only reason I give as many stars as i did."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of fresh pasta so when I heard this place imports from Italy I was super excited to try it. But it was mediocre from start to finish and not worth the price we paid.   My husband and I like to be adventurous so we started off with the pigs feet. This was a little too fatty for me but the sauce was adequate and it was interesting to try.   Afterwards, we weren't sure what pasta to get so we thought we'd split the bolognese of the day. The picture on the menu made it look big but when it arrived there was not a whole lot there. I thought the pasta was extremely underwhelming for supposedly \"fresh pasta\".   Because I'm a glutton for punishment, I decided to order the carbonara which I thought would be better. It wasn't. Pasta still tasted stale to me and the sauce was underwhelming as well.   Overall we felt that the price for everything just wasn't worth it. Yes it's the strip and you're gonna pay more but for this price we expected top notch pasta. I felt like the meal was comparable to any run of the mill pasta place on the strip that would be cheaper."}
{"text":"Excellent food, ambiance, and service!!!  We didn't have a reservation nor had any expectations, we were here to see the Penn and Teller show at 9 am and want to good eats nearby....also to celebrate a friends 60th birthday that evening.  We thought we give Cafe Martorano a try...glad we did.  The food was delicious and the service was even better.  We each ordered from the prix fixe menu which include a started, main and dessert.  Also order a bottle of red wine and two expresso....all for about $200.00!! That is considered a good deal since food on the main strip can run you more than $75 for fine dining.   Food:  Ordered their Meatballs, they're suppose to be famous for them (pic).  The calamari with the peppers was delicious (pic), I would go back just for this dish alone!  We brought in our own cake and the server presented with our cannoli.  Made the evening even more special for my friend. Regular menu items are reasonable as well (well reasonable for Vegas anyway!)  Ambiance: White table cloth with five star service, but you can also come in casual as we seen people in flip flop and shorts.  You get the same service.  Overlooking the pool, open kitchen.  Unexpected: The \"Godfather\" was playing on three screen (or maybe more) in the restaurant, which was a little odd, but other than that it was fine as watching a younger Pacino and De Niro was an added bonus to the evening.   NOTE:  The server said we could use our receipt to get into the Voodoo Rooftop Nightclub."}
{"text":"im sorry.. i just noticed i took a picture but never posted a review ;( .. so here goes. Very Loud Very Overpriced \"even for a cleb chef\" - and this guy isnt really in that boat either.. Food Quality - fair.. seriously just fair..  You have to really really look for reasons to go to the Rio.. I mean the rio is a dirty and nasty Casino. This place didnt do the brand any favors.  Penn and Teller are the only reason this Casino exists.."}
{"text":"Second time here and was amazing just like the first time. I have tried many Italian restaurants in Vegas and this one is by far the best. Prices are extremely reasonable considering how great the food is. If you like Italian, you must try this place. I would give it 6 stars if I could."}
{"text":"First I'd like to say that the atmosphere is very relaxing and enjoyable. Sadly however, I can't say the same for the menu options and service. The menu lacks selection and customizability. I asked if the spicy sauce on a dish could be substituted and he said \"no we don't customize orders.\" I then asked if their was another dish that included paste, with chicken, that is not spicy. He replied \"no\". I can't believe that they can't customize an order that costs upwards of $30 a dish. This establishment lacks quality and versatility that many younger individuals desire, due to this I would highly recommend overlooking this place and finding a more \"family\" oriented restaurant (save your money and time)."}
{"text":"My sister and I went here on August 9th. As two Italian girls from Philadelphia we found a place that cooks like our mom does! We used open table to place our reservations we walked in and got seated before our actual reservation time. Which is really hard to do in Las Vegas. Yuri was our waiter and I can't say enough about how wonderful he was!! We ordered the fried calamari to start which was amazing! I ordered the special which was the Sunday gravy with ravioli which are two of my favorite things! Initially I was just going to do the Sunday gravy with rigatoni but then Yuri came over and told us about the ravioli special. There was no doubt about it I had to try it! My sister got the lasagna which was great it was such a huge portion that she couldn't finish it. And the bread was so crusty and fresh which is great for dipping! I can't say how much we felt welcome here. All the staff were extremely courteous and welcoming!!! We will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"Went to Martorano's at Paris on Sunday 5.1.2016 and it was not what we come to expect of this place. We have dined most locations more than once; and this was by far the worst experience that we have ever had. Being from Philadelphia and fairly familiar with the cuisine and the restaurant itself. I will have to say that our waitress (Jessica) was excellent and none of it was her fault. We had reservations at 8:30PM and were not seated until 8:40 PM; everyone was crowding the hostess stand. We were finally seated and looking at our menu I order Veal Parmigiana with Gnocchi which I do every location. I was told at first that veal parm is not on the menu but it was on the menu outside the restaurant and every other restaurant that I have been to; but then I was told that they will make an \"exception\". Then moments later I was told that they were out of Gnocchi (I was the 24th order and they only had 23 orders). How do you run out of Gnocchi on a Sunday night when you have it on your menu and you are still open for another 2-3 hours minimum? This is not acceptable for a place that has reservations and is accepting walk-ins. I got my Veal Parmigiana and it was the size of my fist (which isn't that large) and it was very thick and had bones in it (not usual for Veal Parmigiana)  Martorano's was so much better atmosphere, presentation, and family like at the Rio;  at Paris I feel like its get in and get out not enjoyable."}
{"text":"Good food, extremely loud environment, great waiters.  Staying at Rio it's hard to imagine a really good restaurant embedded in this old world Vegas casino however Cafe Martorano surprises you when you dine there.  A clean upscale looking design with fa very friendly staff greeting you at the door. You immediately get a more hip vibe as your shown to your table.   Disco music was blasting, Godfather 2 was playing on the video screens ( my all time favorite film so right away they got me) and white cloth tables await your arrival.  The menu is old school Italian fare with their signature meatball at the top. We chose to go with a series of appetizers and salads for dinner.  Here's the scoop on the food  Meatball with Ricotta cheese - great and lives up to the hype  Eggplant Stack- pricey but was by far my favorite dish. Can share between 3 people  Martorano Salad - good crisp lettuce, excellent slices of pecorino Romano, light dressing  Fresh mozzarella with prosciutto - nice dish, not buffalo mozzarella but fresh and served with Prosciutto drizzled with olive oil  Baked clams - they have a bit of a kick with red pepper flakes, not my favorite dish  Cannoli for dessert was very good  Two issues I had with CM was extremely loud environment where even the waiters have to scream to be heard and all our courses came out at the same time. I know we ordered a bit different by ordering all appetizers however it should have been paced a bit.  Overall though, great food and great friendly service overcome the two shortfalls. And oh, Godfather 2 playing, well that just makes the whole experience even better."}
{"text":"decided to give another try because of the  billboard I see on the freeways.  OMG I am really beyond disappointed. for a 32 dollars pasta you would think that you get a good service (I mean this pasta is a price of steak)    service is slow and mediocre for high priced restaurant.  we never got our breads. took long time just to get some salt and pepper. chicken marsala chicken is dried out chewy(sign of frozen meat)   people do not go to this place.  I can confidently say that this is the worst high end restaurant"}
{"text":"This place was a joke!  We should have known the attitude we would get when the menu states \"No substitutions\", \"Don't break my balls\".  We went anyway because we were staying at the Paris hotel and needed an early meal before the show.  The atmosphere was very pretentious and awkward.  Almost every server that poured water or wine was a nervous wreck and shook like leaves.  We asked for butter with our bread and they brought one pat on a little dish for 4 people!  The wine was very overpriced ($19 for 4 oz.).  The meal was mediocre, especially for the price.  I'm used to high prices for fine meals, but this one really was a disappointment.  I've been to Italy many times and no place treated us like this one did.  My sister asked for salt when they brought her meal and the waiter insisted that she taste it first and stood there while she did it (she still wanted salt!)!!  They made you feel like they were so superior in their knowledge.  I would never recommend anyone go there!!"}
{"text":"This place looks fantastic! The service once they get to you it's very good. Definitely not worth the hype. I would almost rather go to Olive Garden. There is not a single thing here that I was impressed with except the meatball salad. It is enough for two people to share and has great taste! Had the chicken parmesan and was definitely not impressed. They brought out the wrong order at first and they made it right but by the time they came back I was so full on bread it did not matter that they brought me new food period was not able to eat it anyways. Had a few bites and it was okay period then packed it and gave it away to the homeless. Martorano's you guys really need to step it up. The appetizers came out at the same time as the entrees. They sat us very quickly but the waiter took 20 minutes to come say hello. Once we started eating we realized something was not right and it took them an additional 20 minutes to come but that was only because we waved them down. I think you guys have a great place on your hands, a few tweaks would bake it so fantastic"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time on St.Pattys weekend and absolutely loved it. This past weekend, I brought some of my friends who are big \"foodies\" in as we flew in for a few days to see Elton John. They had the best time and the food was excellent again. The bartenders are fantastic - went above and beyond when I asked for a cucumber martini which by the way was perfect. Make a reservation,  go an hour early, sit at the bar before you are seated at your table, they won't disappoint."}
{"text":"The food was okay at the most. Definitely not worth the price. There was no Frank Sinatra nor R&B playing, as it was said on the menu's introduction. And the cockiness of the chefs statements on the menu's cover makes you lose your appetite. His arrogance is second to none.  Service was good.  Will not come back."}
{"text":"My wife and I have stayed at Paris several times before and this was a new (opened October 18, 2014) restaurant.  We knew going in that it is a bit pricy $$$ but that's why you read reviews.  Our wait staff was great (Chris D).  He was very knowledgable about the food and how it was made.  Plenty of fresh bread to start and a nice wine list.  We ordered the Chicken siciliano (6 tenderloins) and penne ala vodka.  They serve it family style and split it for us.  WOW!!  If I could have sucked the sauce up with a straw I would have.  Worth the price for the quality of the food.  The music was not to loud but there was no DJ on so maybe that was when Slipknot fans come as mentioned in another review.  They also have unlimited tap water not in plastic bottles.  Some of the negative reviews may have been when they first opened but it is running great when we visited."}
{"text":"We enjoyed a really terrific meal. My wife ordered the salad with meatball and I ordered the pepperoni pizza. Great portion size. Very tasty meals. Quick lunch service. They have Lagunitas IPA and I enjoyed that, too."}
{"text":"My wife likes the Matarano story, bought the book, I kind of read a few parts. Great story, pretty good recipes, and was pretty excited to try the new place in the Paris. Went for lunch and was impressed by the trendy upscale decor..Had sports and a n old gangster movie on the t.v.s. I like both so cool. We ordered the bucatini carbonara and the bucatini meatball with red gravy, and truffle fries...both pasta dishes were pretty good. Carbonara had the white Parmesan sauce which was my favorite, other one was pretty solid with one good sized delicious meatball..good but $28 at lunch time good???not sure..Truffle fries were flavorful slash a.little salty..$80tab for lunch seems to make me not like it as much as I hoped..Maybe I'll return for dinner to give a fair review..Cool and friendly waiter was a plus..#yocuz Lower ur lunch prices..haha.."}
{"text":"This was my first experience in the restaurant.  I've never had a waiter so attentive and knowledgeable of the menu.  He has been with the restaurant since opening.  His recommendations for starters were the eggplant stack and the meatball with ricotta cheese.  They were incredible!  The ambiance was great.  Busy restaurant, but you could still carry on a conversation without yelling.  Regarding dress attire:  I would think this restaurant would require dressy attire, but there were some people in casual.  Very much enjoyed my evening and  will be back again!"}
{"text":"Our excellent waiter, Paul, put this review past 3 stars. His manner and passion for the food was entertaining and informative. The food was good...not great and if it weren't for our waiter and the ambiance I'd only give it 2 or 3 stars."}
{"text":"The absolute BEST Italian Food in Las Vegas.  Every entrée is delicious.  Atmosphere is fun and lively."}
{"text":"My friends and I were craving some good Italian food and decided to try Martorano's. It is not really inexpensive, as pasta prices seem a little high.  Our appetizers and server was amazing! The spicy calamari was the best that I have ever tasted! The meal portions are very large so the waiter recommended family style so we all ordered a few items and split it. It was all pretty good, and the service was polite and helpful."}
{"text":"We've never heard of this place until one night when we were desperately looking for a place for dinner while on vacation in Vegas.  I'm glad we went for it.  It was a good experience overall, however the 4 stars are mainly for the service and the calamari appetizer.  I know some people complained about it being soggy because of the sauce but I think it's the sauce that *made* the dish!  It's different from any other typical calamari appetizer I've ever had at most restaurants.  It's lightly breaded and fried, but they put a slightly sweet and tangy sauce on it that made it completely different in a good way.  I ordered the seafood pasta with red sauce (I forget the fancy dish name) and the seafood was obviously very fresh.  I would pick this place over some of the other \"celebrity\" Italian restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"An hour long wait, despite having made reservations more than a month in advance - we were originally seated on the \"sidewalk\" outside the restaurant, with casino guests stumbling past mere inches from our table. Make sure you ask for a table inside the restaurant, but not under the house speakers - it was so loud, we couldn't even hear our waitress, who immediately screamed over the noise, \"Yeah, people complain about the music all the time!\" Do they, now?  We started with the Fried Calamari Bibzy ($20), which was a conflict of textures - some of the larger pieces of squid were completely melt-in-your-mouth tender, while other pieces were crazy rubbery - even the waitress quipped about the half-eaten portion when she finally arrived with our drink orders.  The place has a fantastic wine selection, featuring some really nice and inexpensive offerings, including several of our favorites from the Conundrum Winery by the glass - and we received some awesome suggestions from the sommelier, who had to scream his selections over the music.   My wife's Linguine with White Clam Sauce ($32) arrived under a thick layer of Italian parsley - so much so you would have thought someone dumped a lawnmower bag over the plate. And while the pasta was perfectly cooked, many of the clam pieces were gritty with sand. By the time my wife called it quits, there was such a pile of parsley \"clippings\" floating in the remaining broth, you couldn't see the bottom of the plate.   The Veal Piccata ($34) was tender and the lemon butter sauce was excellent. Just don't forget to order a side of pasta, because everything is a'la carte - an important fact that was either not shared with us, or we simply missed the detail while the waitress attempted to scream over the music.  Oh, and don't ask for salt or pepper - \"The chef seasons everything to perfection.\" Maybe for his pallet, but the veal would have certainly benefitted from a tiny sprinkling of salt."}
{"text":"Once again it did not disappoint.  We got our favorite chicken Sicilian and this time we tried the New York strip steak with sharp provolone and peppers. It was AMAZING?. Cooked perfectly. We also tried the greens which was spinach sprinkled with bread crumbs with big cloves of garlic. So good."}
{"text":"A real comedic event   A good menu, but a bad excuse of a restaurant and a really poor Las Vegas restaurant management team!  Really sloppy - their dress, their presentation, their view on food / service, etc, etc, etc   Just ok service - rushed and unrefined  The food is good, but It is not great by any stretch.  You experience is overshadowed by the management / service.    Find your good customers and don't rush them.    Overpriced even for Vegas. No regulars here, but just tourists who are drawn in unknowingly.  2 years and the location will likely turnover to-another entureprienoer.            Not worth a return trip based on the management, presentation, price, rushed service and poor leadership.    Too many other GREAT options."}
{"text":"Very surprised by the 3 star rating. My wife and I give it 5 stars!   Everything was delicious,  from the meatball salad appetizer  to the chicken parmigiano.  My wife had the special California  sea bass with lump crab. Setting was perfect and service was superb!"}
{"text":"The ambience and the location of this place is amazing . It has an indoor and outdoor seating arrangement .The staff is very friendly and co-operative .  We ordered chicken fussili and a caesar salad , both were good and very filling .We had to take to-go boxes. An authentic Italian restaurant !! Will come back for sure !"}
{"text":"First time in Vegas- wanted to eat well. I love Italian food. My son suggested this place as he had been to it at a previous location. He told the waiter we would start with appetizers and then decide on the main course. The waiter said that he could not take a partial order - we had to order the entire meal at the beginning. I said - I may want dessert... he said we had to decide then. If I had been in my hometown I would have asked for the manager and had a discussion with him about how ridiculous this was. Instead we just ate our appetizers and left - we went elsewhere for our dessert. What a shame."}
{"text":"I reserved my table as Albus Purcival Wulfric Brian Dumbledor and the hostess totally got it.  That made me happy. Great food. I had the meatball. I put that salty ball in my mouth and I was beside myself with satisfaction."}
{"text":"I was very surprised at the quality of food and service i received here. The restaurant is tucked away in the crappy Rio hotel but is by far one of the better places I have eaten at in vegas."}
{"text":"The bucatini  pasta  with a meatball was phenomenal.  Truly  a great dining experience  coupled with a fine wine list. Service could have been a tiny bit better but food was  outstanding."}
{"text":"Wow we were surprised by the number of negative reviews for this restaurant.  We thought this place was awesome.  We totally enjoyed the ambiance of Motown music with mobster movies playing on the big screens throughout the restaurant.  You are in Vegas lighten up!!!  We waited for about 15 minutes at the bar and we were first introduced to the rule that nothing but wine and beer were served in the dining area and at first we felt a bit put off by this but in the end we think it is a brilliant idea.  First of all the portions are HUGE!!!!  We ordered the Eggplant Stack as an appetizer and it was not only huge but very tasty.  For our entree we ordered the Chicken Downtown and let me just tell you it was absolutely foodgasmic.  As we had no room for dessert we can't report on that, but we can say our service was right on and our experience was fabulous.  This is Italian served South Philly style with lots of attitude and lots of flavor."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed dining here at the Paris hotel. I had the meatball salad and the carbonara pasta. My husband had a rigatoni special. Delightful martini choices. Canolli was okay. Pricing is excellent for the quality of food, Vegas experience and the name alone. We will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Fabulous food here!  Wait staff is very attentive and friendly.  We greatly enjoyed our experience with Brandon and the bartender Jenna.    Our first night here we stopped in for a drink and dessert.  We saw someone else enjoying the Cesar salad and knew we had to come back.  The following night after watching a show, we returned....  The Cesar salad is splendid!  Beautiful presentation with large shaved Parmesano-Reggiano pieces on top.  Bread is served wth olive oil, grated Parmesan, and chili oil.    Desserts.... No words, just yummy feelings. We tried the chocolate cake with cream cheese frosting the first night and the following night plus the tiramisu.  Delectable!  Flavors do not disappoint.  I want that tiramisu recipe!  BEST ever...  Atmosphere:  There are TVs playing Vegas mob-type movies with subtitles, music playing, Several disco balls glittering in the back.  The blue colors are inviting.    really cool modern menus... Backlit!  iPad/tablet technology used by wait staff."}
{"text":"This place is awful. I suggest visiting this restaurant only if you enjoy getting an instant heartburn from house salad dressing that consists out of straight up vinegar, consuming overcooked chicken in Marsala sauce that's saltier than the Pacific Ocean, or washing it all down with a glass of Pinot that must've come out of a cardboard box for $5/gallon. To top off your experience, you will wait 1.5 hours for your course to make its way to your table and your dessert will be unavailable at the end of your meal. We came in with a party of 8 people and not one of us had a single positive thing to say about this place. Maybe this restaurant should try to focus on food rather than pretending to be high-end with poorly written iPad apps that aim to replace the drink menu."}
{"text":"Absolutely phenomenal service and by far, the best Italian food we have ever had. The homemade mozzarella is delicious and the pasta cooked perfectly. The meatball is out if this world. Cannot more highly recommend. And big shout out to Raymond for making our first date night as a married couple absolutely perfect!!!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I are here last night and it was absolutely amazing!  The food there is made to order and tastes just like grandma used to make, I couldn't hardly contain myself from ordering more food just to try it. This place has an amazing menu and great quality food, not to mention a very home feel to it, even though its upscsle.  The wait staff is professional, curious, knowledgeable and also very concerned with making you feel like your home. ( as for Paul, our entire menu from drinks to entree were of his choosing and we couldn't have been more satisfied)  To start: the bread and dipping sauces are just amazing. We ordered a homemade mozzarella and tomatoes antipasto, this was to die for! 4 layers of handmade cheese with thick, fresh and ripened tomatoes between them, fresh basil and a 20 year aged balsamic vinaigrette.  I cannot say enough about it.  We also ordered the chicken parmesan that was on special with a side of pasta and their famous meatball....OMG it was amazing! The chicken was perfect, topped with fresh ricotta and mozzarella, not to mention the fresh tomatoe to round it all out. The pasta, always served (al dente) has changed my view on how pasta should taste and that meatball... was worth every stretched out millimeter in my stomach.  All in all, this place was worth the money and time spent, we will be visiting here again on our next Vegas trip."}
{"text":"Stay Away!!!! I went here with a party of 10 for our annual Vegas NCAA trip.The food is mediocre, service is terrible and prices are ridiculous for what you get. They do have a good but overpriced wine list. The music is so loud, you can't even think about having a conversation and the movies with gunshots and blood are completely unappealing while dining.  When I asked if it could be turned down, I was told no and to be happy because it would soon be louder. Is this a restaurant or a disco? Apparently the mis-management seems to attract the \"stripper\" crowd with free food and drinks. You have many choices for good dining when in Vegas so eliminate this from your list."}
{"text":"Fantastic great food and obviously the message not to break his balls about his cooking applies. Great service great wine list. Just a pleasant meal all the way around."}
{"text":"Dined here with my boss on a Tuesday night approximately two months ago. Attention from all staff was wonderful, the food was delicious and the atmosphere was nice as well as we were seated outside. I had some sort of pasta (Can't remember the name but similar to the spaghetti and meat sauce) but it was one of their evening special plates, it was delicious! All ingredients were super fresh and the portion size was perfect.  The bread with oils, vinaigrette and spicy sauce was delicious as well."}
{"text":"AVOID THIS PLACE - BAD FOOD, BAD SERVICE & HORRIBLE ATMOSPHERE  My stomach is still unsettled from last night's dinner.....And so are the stomachs of the other three I dined with.  My suggestion - Go elsewhere in Vegas - anywhere.  For a suggestion as to where to go:  Piero's is far better experience (upscale food and ambiance)  for about the same price.  It's located right off the strip and has been a favorite here for over 30 years.  We are a local Las Vegas family that eats out at good fine dining restaurants regularly.  We know good food when we experience it - and when we don't.  We didn't experience good food here.  Boy were we surprised when the bill came.  I never saw $300 coming.  Now we pay more than that regularly, but never as a surprise.  Here is what we had:  Appetizers: -2 salads $16 each - Mozzarella appetizer special (average appetizer price on menu $18) - Eggplant Stack $23 - Rice Balls $16  Entrees: -  Plain pasta with tomato sauce (as main dish for one person) $19 - Veal Parmesan $28 - Veal Picatta $30 - Seafood special (Sea Bass with two shrimp) (average entree price on menu $28)  One glass of wine $17 No dessert.  Using prices from the menu for items ordered above, the bill should have been $211  So how did they get it to $300?  (That's 50% more than we expected to pay.....)  The bill was filled with extra charges - for items that the server made sound were included.  For example, I ordered the Veal Parmesan, and asked if pasta came as a side.  When I was told yes, I asked for penne, and was told the chef does not allow substitutions for side pastas.  But they charged $10 for that side of pasta - which I did not eat as it was horrible.  I would have sent it back and asked for it done right if I knew they were going to charge.    They also charged for extra sauce on a main dish.  I've NEVER seen that happen - EVER.    And the specials were way above the average price on the menu.  Both Appetizer and entree were $20 each above average menu pricing.  Fine dining restaurants ALWAYS price their specials around the average price of their menu, and tell you when they have something extraordinary that deserves higher pricing.  The service was non-existent.   We were constantly looking for our server when food was missing from the table.  I waited at least 30 minutes from when others received their appetizers to get mine.  No acknowledgement of delay, no explanation provided - until I pointed it out.  And the atmosphere - well what can I say.....Large TV's throughout showing the \"celebrity\" cook on a TV show (he obviously was not in the kitchen).   And about 8 speakers hanging from the ceiling - each the size of a large person - with music so loud that no one could hear each other talk.  Again - avoid this place.  Go anywhere else for better food and an overall better dining experience."}
{"text":"Stay away! This place is insulting to anyone of Italian American descent.  Decor; tacky! Videos; distracting! Music; yuck! And the food; straight out of a food court."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped by Martorano's this evening before going to see Garth Brooks in Las Vegas at the T-Mobile Arena.  We started off with the fried mozzarella appetizer which was the best appetizer we have ever had!   Then we split the Carbonara and it was also delicious!  Our server, Chris was very knowlegable and personable!  Overall, an excellent meal and we will return!"}
{"text":"Went here for a birthday dinner. Food was great! Chicken Downtown was delicious! Eggplant stack and a meatball for appetizer was also great. But what really stood out was our server Brandon, super nice guy and extremely knowledgable about all the menu items. Everything was excellent."}
{"text":"It probably helped to have a great waiter - he helped explain the menu - the food was terrific as was the service.  Prices were on the high side but  the quality and quantity of food were worth it."}
{"text":"We had dinner here twice while we were attending a convention at the Rio. Compared with the other places we dined at the Rio, this was a stand out. In general, though, it was a fairly average Italian restaurant. Prices were a bit high, most likely because the restaurant is in a casino.   We made reservations both nights and were seated promptly - we definitely chose times before the dinner rush started. Service was similarly prompt and attentive. The wait staff helped with menu selections and based on their recommendations we split the chicken parm the first night. When paired with a side of spaghetti (which was incredibly overpriced given the portion size) and a salad it was more than enough for the both of us. The next dinner we both tried the meatballs, which had a nice taste to them and were accompanied with a light sauce.   Another benefit to eating \"early\" (6-7 pm time frame): The music was at a tolerable level. We were worried about the noise when we first read the Yelp reviews, but it wasn't an issue when we were there. They apparently gradually turn up the volume as the evening draws on, so if you want to be able to chat with your dining companions, you might want to dine before things get too loud.  They do have a person going table to table asking if you would like your picture taken. That might be a turn off to some people, but it didn't bother us. The woman was very friendly and we chatted for a while. From what we saw from other tables, she wasn't high pressure: Tell her \"no thanks\" and she is off to another table.  We'd eat here again if we were ever in the Rio."}
{"text":"Food is exception and always enjoy Steve's restaurants!  Server was a bit rude but I can overlook it since the chicken Parmesan was out of this world.  Fried mozz with meatballs is killer and the bread is straight from north east.  Can't go without telling you how good the housemate mozzarella is on top of the tender chicken rolling out the parm.  Excellent five stars all around wish we did dessert but I left half the portion of chicken on the plate because it was so big.  I also got gnocchi with sunday gravy because I can't resist trying Everyhthing on the menu when I dine.  So good & so bad ars #YoCuz I'll be back soon !!"}
{"text":"Excellent experience. I had the scallops while my husband had the veal and both were fantastic. I would recommend and will return when in Vegas. The wine by the glass was surprisingly good."}
{"text":"The American/Italian \"Philly\" style food is delicious across the board. Meatballs, Pastas and Parm style dishes flood the menu and are all very tasty. The restaurant is a relocation or spin off of Cafe Martorano's which was at the Rio for many years. I think this is an excellent restaurant with one severe drawback. At night (weekends?) they turn up the music obnoxiously loud as if it's a night club. It's not a night club, it's a restaurant that becomes impossible to have a conversation in. I have never seen the restaurant packed when they do this, as it clearly drives away more traffic than it attracts."}
{"text":"The Good: The food was very good. Sauce had notable flavor. Wine list was decent. Service was good.  The Bad: over hyped a bit. It was good but about what you would expect. I had a hard time moving from very good to exceptional.  The Rest: overall a nice stop and if you don't mind the higher price associated with vegas fine dinning, you wont be disappointed. If you fine dine frequently you will be satisfied but probably not wowed."}
{"text":"The food here was disappointing. The service was good but I would probably not come back for the food. Maybe, I'm just not the right type of customer. There were there for dinner before going to see the new Inferno magic show.  We ordered, the fried calamari, spaghetti with meatball, carbonara, and cheese steak, and a salad.  First of all, when I order calamari, I expect it to be crispy and temperature hot. The sauce that they put on the calamari made all the pieces soggy. Have you had soggy calamari at a restaurant before? I haven't. This was the first time.  The spaghetti was fine. Nothing special with a giant meatball. For $25 or so for an average bowl of spaghetti wasn't worth it. If the sauce was more flavorful, then sure, but really, I could have made that spaghetti. The carbonara was okay, but I think they must have used swiss cheese, or the combination of cheese they used wasn't as good. It was very strong. I love parmessan, gruyere, asiago, etc. but whatever the combination was - was something that I personally didn't like. The Philly was okay, as well, but nothing special.  Usually price isn't a factor, but when the food isn't great, then it becomes an issue, because it wasn't worth it.  If I had known, I probably would have gone to Maggiano's instead. Oh, finally, the salad. It was swimming in dressing. I ordered the Maggiano's salad for $14. It was just that - lettuce and some tomatoes. I am being critical in that the world of restaurants has made so many innovations in salad that a $14 salad shouldn't be a small plate of greens with dressing that I could have bought at the grocery store.   I love great food and expect it when it is billed as a fine dining restaurant. Mediocre is right. I make better pasta at home than this restaurant. I don't think the chefs understand that people's palate's have changed. We're used to eating at so many great pasta restaurants - Nora's, Buddy Vs, Maggioni's, Wolfgang Puck, and a few more - gosh even California Pizza Kitchen, and I'll say Buca Di Beppo have some solid dishes, so this place is a great disappointment."}
{"text":"This is located in the Paris Hotel in Las Vegas. The atmosphere and the servers are great. But the pasta and seafood dish I had was very spicy. I didn't enjoy it nor did I finish it. Also shouldn't they be playing French music rather than American pop? I enjoyed the Malbec wine."}
{"text":"This place is pretty great. The downside is it is located in old Vegas in the Rio hotel, completely away from everything. The Rio is kind of a scary, smelly place at night. The handmade gnocchis are soooo good. The meatball with ricotta is really great as well. I had the eggplant parm as my entree and it was cooked perfectly. This place would do even better in a better location."}
{"text":"Great service, very friendly staff, intimate ambience. Food was so delicious. I got the shrimp bizby and it was to die for. Perfectly seasoned and cooked, not rubbery or bland at all. The next dish was the meatball and fried mozzarella...again, perfectly seasoned and cooked. I tried some martinis and they were not weak at all. Wide selection of beer and liquor. It was very cozy and romantic, yet somehow it was lively with music and people - perfect balance! I went two nights in a row during my stay at the Paris and it will certainly be my go to place when I'm in Vegas again."}
{"text":"Best Italian restaurant on the strip!!  Beautifully displayed and gourmet cuisine!!  Love their fresh mozzarella and risotto. Scallop and crab dish so delicious!!  Great atmosphere with old movies showing on screens throughout The restaurant."}
{"text":"I was excited to have the opportunity to finally eat here. The atomsphere is dark and modern. I loved it. Our waiter did an excellent job giving us all info necessary on the food and the establishment. He knew the menu very well and explained the items in depth like a pro. I got the meatball and salad for starter. The meatball was huge and made to perfection. It was topped with an incredible red sauce and a nice side scoop of smooth ricotta cheese. It was surrounded by a delicious italian dressing topped salad. For entree i got the carbonara. The serving size was more than enough and it tasted so good with the cream sauce and egg yoke. I have no complaints. None. Next time i'm in Vegas i will be a repeat customer. This place lived up to all expectations."}
{"text":"LOL, this place is a joke, although It's worth a visit just to see how off the wall it is and to bring home a good story of the awkwardness.   I'm a foodie and know for a fact I could cook proteins better than the head \"cook\". I know for a fact there are better tasting pastas from Sysco. I also know when I can taste a marinara that has a base of canned tomatoes yet it's called \"homemade\".. I know for a fact that Lipton style instant Iced Tea out of a plastic bottle doesn't cut it as a drink in a restaurant of this price range.   I've traveled Italy, ate at some of the best Italy has to offer and I have a moderate respect for the cuisine, but even if I do over look the under cooked pasta and a horribly dried out meatball and bring it all down to flavor, this place still just doesn't cut it and dont even get me started on the service..   We tried this place on a whim before the Penn and Teller show as it looked to be the closest thing to fine dinning at the Rio, but we should have known better when there are TVs playing the God Father all over the place.. The Rio really needs to up their dinning game.   If you're a foodie, my suggestion is go for a overpriced poorly mixed drink at the bar to experience the train wreck that is Martorano's and take home a story of a \"restaurant\" you will never forget..  Oh yeah, what the hell was that thing that Martorano's calls bread? Wow, who ever came up with that one needs to be taught the basics of baking bread again.."}
{"text":"This restaurant was a  big disappointment, it looks very nice from the outside but the menu, service and food were really very poor.  I ordered the chicken marsala which I have eaten at many restaurants and it didn't come with pasta, mashed potatoes or vegetables, just over salted pieces of chicken.  My girlfriends pasta wasn't any better and the prices for two salads and two meals and one glass of wine was $137.00.  We should have gone to Maggiano's just down the street we would have had a great meal for about $40.00."}
{"text":"Food is so good here!! Great staff. Me and my wife had an awesome birthday meal thanks again to the chefs and front of the house. We will come back soon."}
{"text":"My wife surprised me with dinner place at this place last night for our first time. I was super excited. Been wanting to try this place for a few years and we are locals!   We got seated fairly quickly because my wife made reservations ahead of time. The ambiance was great. Romantic and classy yet hip. Our server was great. Very knowledgeable of the menu and personable. His assistant and the GM were great. Everyone who waited on us was amazing.   I took off a star because the bread wasn't all the great and my chicken parmigiana was kind of boring on the plate. As for the taste it was pretty good, but I don't think it met my expectations for how much each dish was.   I would still recommend though. It was a great date night place."}
{"text":"Seriously delicious. If you're in the area and hungry for an awesome Italian meal, definitely check out Martorano's new location on the Strip!"}
{"text":"3 course special for $40 - large shrimp scampi, spaghetti and meatballs and a large cannoli is the best deal around. Great music, atmosphere, staff and food."}
{"text":"Here is the bottom line, if you like your pasta cooked Al Dente, then you will probably like the food. But if you don't like pasta cooked Al Dente, then your out of luck, because they will not cook it any other way. I am not fond of Al Dente, or not being able to have my food cooked the way I want it, so 3 stars is the best I can rate this restaurant. I had the rigatoni in Sunday Gravy (sauce) with pork, and the gravy is very good. I also ordered a side of meatballs (which they give you one large meatball for $12). It was OK, but I have had a lot better and it was certainly not worth the money. The bread served with the meal is authentic delicious Italian bread, served with sides of oil, hot pepper sauce, and grated cheese (although I wish they also included butter as a choice as well). The decor is very sleek and ultra modern, and although it hardly fits the theme of an Italian resturuant, it is a nice looking place. The prices are high for an italian resturuant, but when you take into consideration your eating at a celebrity chef's restaurant, right on the strip, the prices are fairly reasonable. There are certainly many better Italian restaurants in Vegas, but if your staying at the Paris, and don't feel like leaving the hotel, you can get a decent meal here (as long as you like Al Dente pasta!)."}
{"text":"Eggplant stack was amazing! Meatballs and gravy, and the gnocchi were delicious."}
{"text":"80s disco Italian restaurant. Yeah you read that right. A total gimmick and a bit cheesy but the food is really good. If you need a meatball while listening to The Bee Gees, then this is your jam."}
{"text":"Typical 'celebrity' restaurant in a big casino. Good place to eat, as long as it's on someone else's dime.  THE ROSES: Fun concept, especially in the bar. There are a battery of large TVs above the bar that offer you a selection of sports and better gangster flicks to watch while you wait for your table. While I was there, I enjoyed scenes from \"The Godfather, Part II\", and \"Copland\". Given the noise level in the bar, it would be nice to have the closed captioning turned on, though; there is no way in heck you're gonna hear the dialogue. Food is actually quite good; served family-style (at least on my visits), everything was uniformly quite tasty and well-presented. Service is quite good as well.  THE THORNS: Very loud; not the place you want to go for a quiet, intimate meal. The other big thorn is that while the food and service are quite good, I honestly do think the prices are a bit steep for what you're getting. Unfortunately, this is the New Vegas Model; where the casinos used to offer great dining deals to get folks in the door, these days the larger casinos apparently have no problems packing the suckers in, so they can charge quite a bit. I dined on an expense account, but if I had to pay my own way, I'd have gone elsewhere, as I honestly felt the value for (my) money wasn't there.  THE VERDICT: Loud, boisterous, fun place with great food, but steep prices create a poor Value Factor and so I have to detract at least 1 star.  If you're dining on someone else's dime, have more money than you literally know what to do with, or if the Rio is comping you, by all means go; otherwise, as they say in the mob movies, 'fugheddabboutit'!"}
{"text":"Had a horrible experience, first of all our bartender at the bar was ver rude and helped other people at the bar before us. Had he been Sincere and helped us during the course of our drinks. The experience would have been better had he only given me a water, really ruined the experience at this place. I'd be happy if they went out of business because of this horrible experience. Took an hour to even be able to get an appetizer."}
{"text":"Do Not eat here unless you like to eat in a disco environment. Went here with a large group at CES.  Appetizers were very good.  Meatballs yummy.  Meals were good.  But loud music plays nonstop, disco, rap, and other weird songs so loud you cant talk.  Movie scenes are played on 25 TV screens and every now and then the music stops and the movie sound blasts the room.  Horrible dinner environment.  Asked manager if he could lower the volume and he said after 8 they pumped it up because people like it.  Note Friday night in Vegas and this place was half full.  Manager take note.  I will never go back and neither will the Herbs 17 people who were in our party"}
{"text":"First time visiting the one at Paris Casino and like the one at Rio Casino they never disappoint. I had the special: Rigatoni Bolognese and it was the best pasta dish I've had at any restaurant. My wife had the Chicken Parmigiano and she said it was the best she ever had. Of course started the meal the world's best tasting meatball.  The server Mike, the manager John and the cook was the most professional and beyond approach when it comes to service. The chef made my dinner twice cause he didn't like how the first one came out and you don't find that commitment to quality and detail like that anymore.  If you come to Vegas and miss this fine dining establishment then you are definitely missing out. Don't walk but run here for a fine dining experience."}
{"text":"Excellent food, Very good servings - and it was fast. One star off however. Apparently owner likes to run his movies as part of the video experience. Maybe - just maybe- a kitschy horror film where there's a decapitation is not the very very very best idea to show when people are eating. I'll come back - get smart (no pun) about the movies and we can get five stars - of course keep the food and service excellent. ok? Ok"}
{"text":"This was some of the best Italian food I have ever had. My friend, who is from Philly, also loved it.   I had the chicken marsala without the pasta, they were out of gluten-free and that's the only kind I can eat.  Our table had the Caesar salad and an appetizer special. I don't remember what it was called but it had mozzarella and prosciutto (I think), tomatoes and Italian spices. It was nothing short of heaven (IMO).   On our other visit, we had the meatballs with ricotta (soooo good!) and I tried my friend's Chilean Seabass. I swear I am now ruined for all other Seabass, ever.  If you're in Vegas I highly recommend this place. And if you're staying at The Rio, you shouldn't eat anywhere else in the hotel."}
{"text":"Everything we had was wonderful. From the cocktails, to the salad and main course.  I would highly recommend to anyone in Vegas."}
{"text":"The only good thing about this place is the service. And it looks nice and has a cool ambiance. Besides that, don't waste your money. The portions are small and it was nothing to write home about. We ordered the calamari as an appetizer and it was like $20 and came with like 10 pieces of calamari. Seriously? For $20? I thought they were feeding mice. The entrees were nothing special. We had the chicken permigliano (however you spell it). It comes with no sides!!! And it wasn't even good. It was a fried piece of chicken with cheese on top. Seriously don't waste your money. This place sucks. Overpriced and they are greedy with their portions. I only gave it two stars because the server was really nice. But they try pushing you to buy more (sides, alcohol, etc.). I felt like I was looking for a used car."}
{"text":"Beautiful decor and has a nice view of the pool. This place serves your classic italian dishes. i don't like huge portions so I opted with the appetizer section? And i still got a huge meatball with a salad. They had risotto with fish as a special that day, and the risotto i tried was delicious. It was very creamy and flavorful. The bread they serve in the beginning wasn't that good but I would probably come back as they have other dishes that sounded good."}
{"text":"The only way this dining experience could have been worse if if the food totally sucked. It wasn't great, and the service was horrible. We ordered drinks and waited over 10 minutes to receive them. We ordered another round and waited even longer. When our meal was served, the entrees came out at different times and my 'salad and meatball' appetizer came out several minutes after everyone else causing their entrees to be cold by the time we ate. After speaking to the manager, twice, he told us that they serve the food as it comes out and that was the way it came out...not my problem! And the restaurant wasn't even 25% occupied. The food wasn't great, just passable, so all in all, won't be going back there again...ever!"}
{"text":"The service was excellent.  Our server was attentive and genuinely friendly.  The bus boy did not let our water get below half full.  The food is tasty.  The bread they bring out is good.  The chili oil dip for it is great.  It has a nice flavor and a little kick.  For my meal I had the philly cheese steak with truffle oil fries.  I love the flavor truffle oil gives fries.  They were great.  The cheesesteak was also pretty tasty.  For desert I had the tiramisu.  It was great.  The flavors were solid and distinct.  My friend had the cheesecake.  It was very good, and was a huge portion.  There is a good wine selection.  It is a bit pricey.  The cheesesteak was $24.  Most of the more formal meals were in the mid 40's.  There are several flat screens televisions through out the dining room.  The Godfather was playing on one, so that made me quite happy.  They also had some games on."}
{"text":"Firs time there had the best veal parmigiana ever. Second time there had the worst veal parmigiana. They need to have consistency with their chefs   So disappointing will not be back."}
{"text":"Best pasta I have ever eaten at a restaurant. I had the Bucatini Carbonara. It was rich, but flavorful and addicting. My gf doesn't even like pasta, but she was impressed with the bite I made her try. I highly recommend this dish and this restaurant. The service was on point. Our server was very professional. The drinks were fantastic too. Lemon drops. The appetizers we had were the Eggplant Stacked and a meatball and cheese appetizer I can't recall the exact name. Both dishes were fantastic. I would recommend the Eggplant Stack. Trust me... Overall I had a great experience. I will be a returning customer.   PS: they have a strict no altering dishes rule. If you're the type that likes to modify your dishes you will not like this place. That being said, I wouldn't change a thing ;)"}
{"text":"Food tastes OK, but is highly overpriced. Plus the atmosphere is incongruous with what you would typically associate with high end Italian cuisine because they have loud music blasting in your face while you try to enjoy your meal for most of the time. So you really can't have a nice conversation with your dining partners at this establishment.   What is even more strange is that, when they are finished bombarding you with loud music, they then replace it by showing movies on a bunch of HDTVs with the volume cranked up all the way. I guess the people who work here must be hard of hearing. So definitely don't come here if you prefer a nice quite and relaxing dining experience.  As for me, I've never been in a high priced Italian restaurant that, to me, has the ambiance of the HDTV and audio sections of Best Buy. These guys need to figure out what they are, either a pricey Italian restaurant or an electronics store. Whatever they are, they need to decide fast because the place was almost empty on a Friday night. Too bad, because the dining here is not that bad, just expensive and loud."}
{"text":"Muscle man Steve Martorano serves overpriced East Coast Italian food at his restaurant in the Rio, where we dined with our foodie friends on Sunday evening. Although nothing we had was bad and everything was well-seasoned, I still left with a bad taste in my mouth due to the prices and the atmosphere. Let me give you a mental picture: disco balls, neon lights, over-sized outdoor garbage cans in the bathroom, and blaring music only turned off so you can watch an equally loud scene from the original Ocean's Eleven on one of six flat screens. The light/video/music show is all orchestrated by DJ Martorano himself, who spends more time annoying his customers with noise than paying attention to their food.  His menu is as beefy as his arms, so I would advise vegetarians to stay away. I actually give him credit for his unabashed use of meat, which he prepares well. Since we were a group of four and didn't feel like eating a ton of food, we ordered a bunch of appetizers to split. Their meatball, which they are famous for, is light with balanced meatball elements. It is served with tasty marinara and excellent ricotta, though these features can't justify the $14 price tag (or $18 if you want a microscopic salad to go with it as we realized after the fact).  We then ordered pigs feet, a dish I would say was the highlight of the meal because I don't generally eat pigs feet and they seemed to be prepared well. But it's also possible my enjoyment was due to the abundance of that San Marzano marinara or the relatively inexpensive price ($10). The feet themselves were not terribly meaty, but the accompanying rolled pig skin stuffed with pork was quite enjoyable (if eaten only a few bites at a time) and tasted like thick, chewy pasta (if pasta was pure fat).   Other above average options included; the eggplant stack, which was crispy but heavy, and not served hot ($19); the gnocchi side, which was light enough but not terribly interesting ($14); and the hot peppers stuffed with veal that I enjoyed, but felt had a bit too much crushed red pepper ($18). He also offers an interesting take on carbonara, which he sent to our table gratis because we are locals (Always tell restaurants on the Strip you are local when making a reservation. They usually do a little something extra for you). I can best describe his preparation as spaghetti (though the waitress called it buccatini) tossed in a white bean hummus. The flavor was fine but it had an off-putting mouth feel, and was not worth the $24 price listed. I'm not sure how he can get away with these prices for dishes that are essentially superior preparations of adulterated versions of real Italian food...   P.S. Don't let the waitress talk you into a specialty cocktail. They taste worse than a melted tropical concoction from Fat Tuesdays. And, if you still want to come, do so before 7:30 or you won't even be able to have a conversation with yourself."}
{"text":"Great dinner and service! Veal Park and Lobster were fantastic. Orders all desserts for a birthday and they brought it all out with great flare!"}
{"text":"Ah, where should I begin? This place started out rough and only went downhill. Our party of 8 had reservations and the restaurant was not all that busy for a Saturday night...now I understand why. We were told that we could not be seated until all 8 members of our party arrived.-Strike one. We went to the bar to have a drink, but it took so long to navigate the cute little iPad menu that all of our party arrived before we could order a drink. At least we were able to sit at our reserved table. We then sat and waited 15 minutes for a server...did I mention it wasn't that busy? When he did arrive, he impressed us again with an iPad drink menu...for 8 people? Really? I asked for a paper menu and was told that it was not updated. Strike two. Good news, we did get water after 25 minutes! The server was pressuring us along after he made US wait?!? Strike three. I haven't even tried the food yet, and honestly don't care if I do. It's like a nightclub more than a restaurant. I would have asked my fellow diners if they felt it was loud too, but you can't hear each other at all. The noise level is LOUD! Skip it and just go straight to the club."}
{"text":"When I'm hungry for Italian...  ... I see the Martorano's billboard and lose my appetite."}
{"text":"We came here just to try the caesar salad because we heard  so much about it. I must say it was excellent, one of the best Caesar's we've ever had. We also had the shrimp appetizer which was just as good. Bryce and Umberto took excellent care of us. The next time we come we will be sure to ask to sit in Bryce's section. We would highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"If you want to spend $161.00 for food that tastes like Olive Garden then eat here.  Be careful with the waiters daily special. My Chilean Seabass was $62.00, now I think he should of mentioned that when I was looking at ordering the veal for $28.00.  I'm a foodie and I don't mind spending the money on good food but this is nothing special at all.  You pay for the ambience and food presentation.   I learned my lesson - always ask the price of their daily special."}
{"text":"Experience:  my friend invited me to go with her, because she had a comped meal and show.  Lucky me!!    Facility:  it is inside the Rio. I liked the decor...it seems a little more high end than it is. It's pricey, but they show casual movies and clientele are in shorts, t-shirts, and tennis shoes.  All tables and chairs and some bar seating.   Service:  the hostess was rude, treated us like we were bothering her, and ignored me when I was talking to her.  Great first impression!!!!   Our waiter, Ben, on the other hand was amazing!!!  He was so friendly, helpful and professional.  The manager came over and asked how the meal was, and as I told her the pasta was a tad under al dente, she talked right past it. Why ask of you don't care?!  Food:  Well, hmmm...what to say.  It was decent.  Some things amazing!!!  Some things not so amazing.  Bread and oil - 5/5 loved the fresh warm bread and different choices of oil and butter.  Spicy Calamari appetizer - 5/5 the best!!! I loved the flavors of the sauce on this dish. The calamari flavor was overpowered, but they were crispy and I don't care, because the sauce is so good.  Meatball and ricotta on bread - 3/5 it was good, but not amazing. The flavors just didn't impress me and this was the signature of the place....the meatballs.  Carbonara - 2.5/5 the waiter raved about this one. He said people from Italy say it's comparable - nope!  Italy is waaaayyyy better. It was bland to me.  It needed salt and the pasta was undercooked. I like al dente, but this wasn't there yet. I did love that they left the egg yolk for me to stir in.   Overall - nice place, food was decent, but not sure I would be happy to pay $100 without the comp for what we got.  They do have 25% off for locals, so maybe I'll come back and try something else.  But not anytime soon."}
{"text":"The extremely poor service outweighed the delicious food. My daughter had just turned 21 and we were in the mood for some fine Italian food so we made our reservations and arrived right on time. We were seated, but no server was to be found for about 10 minutes. We had no drinks, or water. Finally our server Raymond came over and introduced himself, he was pleasant but dismissive, not even apologizing for the wait. We understand the restaurant may be busy, but maybe more waitstaff should be hired because one server can not handle 12 tables at once. We were looking into getting a bottle of wine and he asked us if we were staying at The Paris Hotel. We said no, but staying at The Cosmopolitan across the street. He kept trying to sell us something we did not want but insisted and made us try it anyway, still not liking it we ordered what we originally wanted. Took another 15 minutes for our bottle of wine to come and be served.  The whole time we noticed the table next to us was a bunch of high rollers, and got anything they wanted. There was every server, bus boy, sommelier helping them the entire service. Our server was barely present the whole time, and was mainly focused on the table next to us. A sommelier did not even show us the bottle of wine that we ordered. Then it came time to order our food, and we were excited because we heard the food was amazing and it certainly did not disappoint. Our first course came, we got the meatball salad and it was divine. I noticed though that every other table that got salad got it served to them by their server, in which we did not. Not a big deal, but bad front of house service for sure. Our main entrees were fantastic as well, we got the chicken parmigiana and veal parmigiana. Excellent food, kudos to the kitchen. Overall it was extremely poor service, which is very upsetting due to how good the food was.   Will not be returning due to the service."}
{"text":"If I could choose 0 star, I would do that.  We  were yesterday, Sunday the 25th table of 7 people.  We had the worse server ( The blond lady) with attitude and over 'I work by the book'.  Just to mention we are Diamond guest who spend 10-20K a night in the casino.   First she said on what ever we ask to change or add or remove from a dish ( My wife is pregnant)  ' No! I can't. You can see in the menus no changes at all' and after I asked a few times to ask the kitchen and begging , She came back and said 'oh it's ok the will do it for you'. It happened a few times.   Then one of the pasta dish wasn't cooked, And we know more than her one or two things about pasta, She said it should be like that. 'If you wanna change and make a new one it will take you 40 min for a new pasta'. Are you serious !?! She didn't want us to order a new one.  And so we said yes, And guess what? It took 20 min, half of the time she said.  When we said we don't want it because of her bad service, She was  laughing on front of our face with the manager.  One more thing, The pasta is not fresh, and costs 35$ and up for a poor basic marinara pasta. SHAME on Paris hotel that they let this restaurant to be opened there!  Don't go there. Poor menu, WORSE SERVICE.  Super expensive, You better go eat with this prices at Gordon Ramzi restaurant or Mom ami Gabi, X10 times better value for your money , 10X better menu and food quality and the most important you get an excellent service there."}
{"text":"Truly in my opinion the finest most flavor packed Italian food I have tasted in Vegas. Simple ingredients, but so well balanced and perfectly cooked. Nice elegant place. I tried the veal lemon piccata and it was simply amazing . I tried their signature meatballs with fresh ricotta cheese.... And they were simply \"WOW\" so authentic and packed with flavor... My mouth waters for them even now. Their spaghetti had a wonderful marinara with great toasted garlic and chili, it was top notch on every level . Staff was great and attentive. I spent years mocking the owner because he looks like a juiced up guido from the jersey shore, and I thought what does he know about food? My wife dragged me to his restaurant because she wanted to try something different in Vegas . I was truly humbled  and I stand corrected . This owner knows Italian food intimately and passionately. I respect the man and can't wait to go back on my yearly Vegas trip. You will not be disappointed with this food"}
{"text":"Unfamiliar with Martorano, I was pleasantly surprised with this restaurant.  Overall, the look has a very modern/trendy feel to it, though admittedly a little confusing with the random mob/action movies playing on all the TV's periodically turning up over the sound system for certain scenes, only to fade back into the dj's mix.  Food wise---I enjoyed the meatball over fried mozzarella. The meatball was sizable, tender, delicious and of course fried mozzarella---what more need be said.  My entrée was the lasagna which is better than average, but not necessarily anything to get too excited about.  What I did quite enjoy, however, was the wife's risotto with shrimp and scallops.  Quite possibly one of the best things I've ever tasted.  The risotto was so buttery and rich with each bite--completely flavorful, and the seafood cooked perfectly.  If I were to go back, I would certainly order that.  The price point was a little high, but as expected for this sort of restaurant on the strip in Vegas and certainly not outrageous.  Waiters were attentive and food brought promptly.  Overall good experience."}
{"text":"I really liked this place. Excellent service and food was great. Had the steak and it was amazing."}
{"text":"Came here solo (long story) while in town. Server Paul was charming and informed and made me feel welcome. Delicious food, fun music. Loved it and will be back!"}
{"text":"I was impressed with the atmosphere of this restaurant. The decor is pretty upbeat and unique. They have several tvs which play old movies and at some point they dim the lights and play loud music. It's a pretty fun place if you are in the mood to party. However, if you are not it can be very dark and too loud for dinner.   They have a large variety of dishes. I highly recommend the homemade mozzarella. There are a few dishes with it, so you have several opportunities to try it. For my main entree I ordered the tailgate pasta which comes with ground beef, veal and pork. The dish is super meaty and the pasta was perfectly cooked.   For my dessert I ordered the carrot cake. This dish was good, but easy to forget. Unfortunately they do not have a lot of options for desserts. I felt the five options available were very mediocre.  The service was also ok. The staff was friendly but it took about 45 minutes to get our main entree. Overall, a good option if you are feeling like having Italian food with a great atmosphere."}
{"text":"I had wanted to try Martorano's for a while as it seemed like it would be a great dinner spot.  While restaurants can be hit or miss, they did everything right from start to finish.  We were promptly greeted at check in, as was every party arriving.  We were lucky to have Paul as our server.  What more can I say than \"wow\" about his professionalism, knowledge and hospitality.  He spoke about the menu with a sincere passion for his role as ambassador to our table.  With items I would never order (vegetarian) he spoke about the menu with such confidence and intimate knowledge that he was sharing an insiders look more than just suggestive selling.  The menu was amazing.  Paul prepped us for a fabulous ride and it did not let us down once.  The freshly made mozzarella made it a necessity to have it to start.  We had their version of caprese and fried mozzarella that was evident that everything was made fresh and with love.  Indeed Paul's presentation of the menu was a love story and homage of the chefs vision and passion.   Portlons were abundant and full of flavor where you savored each bite.  Penne a la vodka was exceptional and chicken dish huge.  While the menu consisted of fresh and simple ingredients, it was the symphony of flavors and presentation that made it perfect.  Overall, a great experience from Start to finish and I would not hesitate in recommending it!  I can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"\" FAST FOOD IN PARIS\"  Guest of this establishment during V day 2016. Was excited to spoil my gf to fine dinning VEGAS-STYLE.  What we experienced instead was fast food fine dinning at it's best. It took more than a few minutes for our waiter to introduce himself and serve water.   We ordered philly steak sandwich and Shrimp spaghetti. As expected from menu we were asked to be patient for food, as it was \"made to order\".  We received what I felt was market prepared bread everyone boasts about.    After more than 20min when the food finally arrived I was pissed!!!  The philly sandwhich ($18.00) looked like a complete mess.  I felt that it was purchased from Costco frozen food sandwhich.  The spaghetti was warm-cold not hot as I expected from a freshly prepared entree.  Shrimp was prepared perfectly, wild caught.  The calamari was a F'n JOKE!  It was frozen.....Yo Cuz!  You fed me a frozen entree??????  When it came time to pay this establishment inquired about my experience.  I gave them a \"D\" rating simple fact that it was terrible!  I gave this establishment 2 stars for two reasons; Incredible ambiance & MGR inquiring about our experience prior to completion of our meal.   I will not be returning....."}
{"text":"Hubby and I came here for anniversary dinner since we were staying at the Rio anyways and was recommended by friends.  We both loved the chili olive oil for dipping the bread (different spin and good).  Hubby ordered the Pescadora (Lobster, Clams, and Shrimp over Linguini in a Red Sauce)  Per hubby the seafood was AMAZING but the linguini with red sauce was just okay and not as flavorful as he was expecting.  I had the Famous Meatball Salad and although the meatball was VERY good as was the salad.  Overall the whole dish was too salty for me."}
{"text":"Five stars is difficult for me to give at eatiing establishments, but Mataranos really delivered some knockout flavor profiles.  The service was top notch, the menu is simple but elegant. Get The Cheese!  Because WOW and you are welcome!"}
{"text":"Went there today for dinner before a show.   Fantastic! The food had amazing flavor, service was on point and the vibe of the place was great."}
{"text":"I'm glad I did not read the reviews before i went.  I thought it was great  The girlfriend and I went for dinner after a show.  We were seated near the bar, with a view of the walking area outside the restaurant and could see into the restaurant as well.  The music was interesting, not what i would expect, but since I was a child of the 80s, i enjoyed it a lot.  I guess they have a dance floor as well, since they were playing a lot of 80s and 90s hip hop and dance music.  I liked it, but we did not dance...  I thought the food was good.  We shared the Fusilli Pollo and it was enough for two of us, with an appetizer.  We had good service and the price was good as well  It's not a chain that you see in every town, and that's what we were going for.  And it was close to the hotel..."}
{"text":"Oh I'm sorry but I cannot leave this a bad review at all when I came here to this particular location with my friends from New Jersey we happen to walk by right as they were opening the restaurant and what do you know it was like we hit the jackpot lottery I swear to God it was crazy we were there first table and chef Martorano was there!  He kept coming toward table and bringing us food that we didn't order There were other tables in the restaurant that were two tops but it was so strange because I didn't think that we were the first actual people to be seated I think that maybe we were there first party of six It was my girlfriend Sheridan's birthday that we were celebrating I didn't get the bill if there even was one but my friend had said that the chef had hoped it up somehow it was crazy I'm sorry but I thought the food was good and I will never forget how this big jumbo macho Italian guy with the muscles came up to us and were so friendly and was talking to us I'm not sure that even realised it was Chef Martorano at that point until we had left  I don't know about these other experiences but I had a nice time plus the booze always helps"}
{"text":"My group comes here each time we visit. The food is always great. Love the cheese steak, scallops, and chicken Parmesan. Raymond and Francisco were fabulous servers, we had a group of twelve and they managed us very well. Wonderful food and great service!"}
{"text":"Love going to the spot great service great energy great atmosphere I had the seafood fra Diablo delicious Evis was the bartender or waiter did an outstanding job also the bread with a hot olive oil dip was ridiculous"}
{"text":"This is not authentic Italian. But it's authentic NYC Italian. There's a difference. You don't want to go here for an authentic Tuscan dish, but if you want some spaghetti and meatballs, or what I had - the rigatoni with short ribs in \"Sunday gravy,\" was amazing. There's a barrier between comfort food and high-end cuisine in Vegas. But sometimes you don't want a $100 steak...some home-style pasta and sauce hits the spot. And at $28 for my entree, it actually was a very affordable place with n upscale feel. My meal at Martorano's was exceptional. Filling and delicious.  My only complaint is that the drinks are ridiculously priced. I paid $28 for my entree and $26 for 2 Jim Beam drinks (their house bourbon). Sorry, but Jim Beam is not a $13 per drink bourbon. Especially when drinks are measured exactly in jiggers and the bartender doesn't have the option of making it a bit stronger to please the guest. I'm not so upset about the booze content except that they weren't able to make a drink to my liking because it was 75% mixer.  Next time, I'll do beer. Safer and cheaper. But overall, love this place. Affordable but still pretty upscale. Down to earth with the food, but the drinks are outrageous. I'm basing this review solely on the food - not the drinks. Five stars all the way for food, and this is a restaurant after all, so I'll let the drink prices slide."}
{"text":"Service was impeccable! Make a reservation and no wait! Food is to die for... Large portions so come hungry!  Wine list awesome and reasonably priced. Thank you for a perfect meal... We will be coming back soon."}
{"text":"After a great meal at Capo's on Saturday night we ventured over to the Rio for a shot at Cafe Mortarano Las Vegas located in the Rio Hotel 2nd floor over in the Mardi Gras wing. Arriving to the same look and feel from their other two locations in South Florida, I have to admit other than poking my head inside at the Hard Rock Location, I had not yet tried any of the locations for a dining experience.  I have read mixed reviews from everyone and spoken to many persons in and about south FLA who either swear by the place or think it should be black listed. I thought I'd give my own opinion after this event. Arrived as stated Sunday night 9PM very empty for a Holiday weekend, and I'm guessing the Rio Location is the cause. If this place was in one of the more mainstream malls you probably couldn't get into the place.  After some drinks with Bethany at the bar, we moved to our appointed table 5 of us to dine this evening.   Scott our friendly waiter gave us a rundown and we ordered up some appetizers that showed up in no particular order or together but this is the way it's done as I understand everything fresh & hot.  Homemade Meatball with gravy and ricotta cheese $14, South Philly Cheese steak with caramelized onions and American cheese on a crisp Italian roll $16 and Eggplant Stack with homemade mozzarella, tomato and arugula $23 were the 3 appetizers we chose to share.  Bread was hot and fresh and every single one of the above were 100% on the money.    We decided on 4 entrees for dinner to split for 5 persons. First was Shrimp Scampi Bread with butter, garlic, tomato, peas and bread crumbs $18 which was an appetizer order that we asked to be bumped up to 5 jumbo shrimp one for everyone.  Veal Cutlet Parmigiana with tender cutlet of veal and fresh mozzarella $30 a Linguine and Fresh Clams in light red or natural white juices $25 and the absolute last but not least Rigatoni with a Sunday Pork Gravy made with fresh pork, San Marzano tomatoes and ricotta cheese $28.     All I can say is there was not one single solitary thing left in any plate, the food was absolutely delicious on every level, and although I was told family style meant large portions (They aren't) it was a sufficient amount of food to go around.  Two bottles of wine were consumed on moderately priced list, and the 70's disco music in the place was absolutely perfect.  Scott was an Excellent server and giving my own unbiased opinion this was a winner from every vantage point that I can find.   A definite repeat for me on my Vegas runs and will give the Original South Florida location a go when I get a chance. Enjoyed my best meal in Vegas in some time."}
{"text":"We ate at the bar for quicker service. It would have been a 15min wait, but we were meeting friends, so we wanted to be in and out. Also, we weren't really prepared for a nice meal at a candlelit table, so this was just fine. (We were misleaded by the CAFE in the name).   We ordered a Ziti with Hot and Sweet Sausage and Penne and Vodka. (from Rio webiste; official website does not have updated menus). Both were very good with big portions. We also had a side of bread with some dips that were interesting. There was the usual olive oil, but there was also a spicy dip, kind of like chinese spicy hot sauce (weird, not really my kind of dip). The service was spot on... the bartender would refill our water glasses when needed and checked on us periodically.  On a side note, Steve Martorano looks like a UFC fighter that just happens to own this restaurant. I'm not sure i'd trust him as a chef. Oh, and the prices were higher than i would have expected, but then it's vegas"}
{"text":"Great service! The food was good-- a little pricey. We ordered the calamari, sweet and spicy shrimp, and the salad for appetizer. They were all great. For the main course-- we got the chicken, steak, spaghetti and meatballs. The meatballs were a little salty.  Overall, the food was good and service was great!!! Took off one star for the price -- as it is not a fancy restaurant with a steep price."}
{"text":"Went here on a Sunday evening with a party of 6.  Caesar salad and canoli  were the best parts of the meal, everything in between was just average, and overall everything was WAY overpriced.   Service was adequate but not what you would expect for the prices on the menu.  The atmosphere was not appropriate in our opinion; the music and the movie clips (bloody scenes from Casino and other mob type movies) just did not make any sense to us for a place to feel comfortable eating. Caesar salad was well dressed with a good dressing and croutons, and was a very nice sized portion, enough to share. We (tried to) split the stuffed clams appetizer, but only 2 of our party could eat it because it was so greasy and way too spicy.  I love stuffed clams but have never tasted any with quite as much red pepper as they put in it. For the main dishes, one person in out party ordered the Chicken Parm.  It was a decent sized piece of chicken, but for 24 dollars it comes all by itself on a plate, no side of pasta or anything.  I have heard of the a la carte menu items on a steakhouse menu but would it really be hard to add a little mound of pasta? The chicken marsala and gnocchi were pretty tasty, even though the chicken was on the salty side.  They are very heavy-handed on the salt and cheese, especially the ricotta scoops they put in the bowls of spaghetti and meatballs, which a few of us had.  The pasta was cooked nicely, the sauce was very one-note in my opinion, and the 'famous' meatball was just average.  My mom has been making it better for years, and everyone at the table agreed.   I would not go back there unless I just wanted the salad and cannoli, and even then I might just get it to go."}
{"text":"Great wine. Weird atmosphere. Inside Paris on a fake paris street. Calamari was excellent.  Service was good. Over priced. Ordered the lobster. Good enough. Would never come back here. So many better restaurants. So expensive. And a stupid atmosphere."}
{"text":"The best damn Italian I've had since I was back on the Least Coast!! Service was excellent - the Veal and the Pasta (Bolognese of the day) and Salads were simply delicious and just perfecto. Multo Beni boys!! We will be back whenever we can. In Vegas Italiano is a must and this may be the very best in town."}
{"text":"The only reason why I making this a three star review, is the fact that the meatball salad was off the charts and the wait staff was very courteous. They're claiming the best chicken Parmesan in Las Vegas, if that's the best then I'd hate to see the worst because it was soggy and not very good at all. We had the flat pasta bolognese and it was so salty it was barely edible. I will eat there again solely for the meatball salad and the Motz appetizer."}
{"text":"I have been to the RIO a zillion times. This was the first time i visited this place. It is tucked way back in the corner of the masquerade tower area. Kinda of odd location..i wouldn't be thrilled if it was my place. Anyways....My pops had the seafood pasta special was solid with nice big pieces of creatures from the deep..definetly not chincy or low grade. I had the chicken pasta was also good. The only thing is i had it to go so it wasnt totally as nice when you get it at the table but it was good. Its not cheap like anything in a hotel its a bit costly for what you get. The guy who owns the place looks like vin diesels dad lol...yo rocky!...hes just another character in a city full of them..he fits right in :)"}
{"text":"Great food, exhuberant service in sidewalk style but filteted noise and little smoke."}
{"text":"Surprisingly good!  Best pizza I have ever enjoyed in LV.  Light and crispy crust, balanced toppings, super fresh tasting.   Prices a little high, but the service from the bartender was phenomenal. A fly landed in our drink, and they comped the beverage.   Totally unexpected and indicative of the overall great service.  Will definitely return and try more items."}
{"text":"I really disliked this place, and most of the food we ordered.  The decor is nice, black and white. With blue lighting along the bar and the kitchen, which is open (about a 1/3 wall) at the back of the restaurant.  The environment is odd. From the outside it looks like a typical classy restaurant, but once you're in it's a different story. \"Yo cuz\" is plastered all over the place, I'm guessing that's the chef's catchphrase. Several tv's around the room were playing Mystic River (a great movie but would not be my first choice for a dinner - the concept of having a distracting t.v. while in an \" elegant\" restaurant was off-putting) while funk and disco music played a little too loud.  They try to be trendy and modern, the menus are backlit and the server brings over and iPad that he uses to go over the specials and which serves as a cocktail menu/shop/dessert menu, but doesn't actually serve to order.  The servers were very professional and friendly, and provided their recommendations when we asked.  The fried mozzarella stack was very good, but a bit pricey. $22 seemed a bit much.  The main courses were not very good particularly when factoring in their cost. $28 for what amounted to 6 chicken fingers in marsala was a bit steep, and the carbonara, although a generous portion, was not very good either. The risotto was a little too al dente for my taste, although the portion was generous.  There are a lot of better dining options in Vegas."}
{"text":"anyone who reviewed this place must have not been to the original martoranos! Why this place wasnt packed when we went there on a saturday night is beyond me! The food was the best! I know italian food and this was excellent! The staff was attentive and our waiter recomended the eggplant stack, the best app i had in all my time in vegas!!!! we shared the veal for our main and it too was excellent.  This place would do great if it was like the one on lauderdale. I wonder why it isnt.   This is real italian food, not the olive garden! i thought it was great! im shocked at the other reviews. and the prices werent bad for vegas"}
{"text":"I was able to go here with my uncle because he had a free meal voucher here through Paris.  I enjoyed my experience over all but I feel like the prices do not match the ambiance. The ambiance looks like a lower class Italian restaurant whereas the prices match something more elegant. I feel like they couldn't decide which direction they wanted to go in.   I ordered the three course meal paired with wine. For the first course the wine was paired with the food but for the next two courses our food came before the wine. I feel that the wine should have been brought out first so I could enjoy it throughout the whole meal instead of having to wait for it.   I also wanted to order a coke but our waiter was never in sight. I probably saw every other server but him. He was nice but I just felt he was absent when we needed him. (Side note: I never ended up ordering the coke.)  The food was good though. I started with the meatball which was tender and paired with red sauce and peppers. For the second course I ordered bucatini with red sauce. That was also good and I was lucky enough to have leftovers to take to work the next day. For dessert I ordered their cannoli. I loved it and paired with the sweet dessert wine it tasted really good.   Good food, just ok service and ambiance.   I enjoyed it here but just sub par."}
{"text":"Reservation is recommended!  Our server, Brandon, was very good. He made sure our food and drinks were served on time.   The busser/assistant was also great! Very on top of his game making sure we had our waters and our plates were out of the way.   Food was of good quality. The pasta was perfectly definitely al dente.   They're very accommodating about birthdays, so don't be afraid to ask ;)"}
{"text":"Cuzzzzz... best Italian restaurant ever. Atmosphere is good and the food well... you can't get better Italian anywhere in Vegas. Evis is a world class bartender who remembers your drinks and order:"}
{"text":"Mozzarella was excellent!! Spaghetti al pomodoro was a work of art !!! Beautiful!!! Affordable pricing with quality products"}
{"text":"Great service & excellent food. The fried Mozzarella is out of this world good. My wife ordered and enjoyed the Penne ala Vodka, and I had the Braised Short Rib Bolognese. Both were delicious. We will be dining here again. Chris the Jewish / Mexican was our server and was  so much fun attentive. Cheers."}
{"text":"there was a lot of hyperbole regarding this eatery, so we had to give it a go. when we entered this establishment, our party of four were seated in the main dinning area, much to our chagrin, we were greeted with a cacophony of music, blasting at extreme decibel levels! really?  it was so invasive, that we could not hear ourselves think, let alone carry on a conversation, between consenting adults.   i thought obama had outlawed excessive sound torture, were we to be waterboarded next?  also, there were these funky lights, swirling non-stop throughout the room, really? therefore,  a person is not only unable to speak to your guests, but because of the lighting, you couldn't see them! really?    as a result, we were moved to the outside dinning area, thank you god! once outside, we could at least take advantage of our vision, hearing and remaining senses and  engage in the social pleasantries, associated with fine dinning.  our review of the meals met with mixed results; the appetizers of meatball (yes only one) with a salad, was very good, as was the fresh mozzarella.  however, the main courses of eggplant, ordered by two of our party, was over salty and appeared to have been made sometime in advance. this is against their freshly made food mandate, listed by the owner on the menu, really? they were going to return these dishes but since this place is run by a former mafia chieftain, they decided discretion was the better part of valor and life. my meal, chicken sicilian, was one of the worst meals i have ever been served! the chicken was covered in a thick  sauce, which was made of primarily olive oil and grease! the peppers, which were supposed to add spice and flavor were uncooked! so this chicken dish should really sleep with the fishes, which they will also not eat!  the last dish of spaghetti, was enjoyed by my wife.   so if you desire to go to a place where you don't want to see or hear from your friends, family or associates, martorano's is the place for you, but not me!"}
{"text":"SPOILER ALERT   Here's an example of the impact of ambiance on the dining experience.   There are lots of TVs in the dining area and when we sat down they were showing The Untouchables (with the sound muted) on all but one.   SPOILER ALERT   I had never seen this movie but now I have seen part of the end, including the bit where Costner's character throws a guy off a building and   SPOILER ALERT   After gravity dude takes several physics-defying seconds to fall through the roof of a car  APPETITE SPOILER ALERT   The camera gives the viewer a shot of what gravity dude looks like after his trip down.  So when it was time to place an order, I wasn't very hungry.  Those of you who know the movie know it ended soon after that scene. Then they started showing The Godfather.   SPOILER ALERT   Those of you who are familiar with this movie know that the scene with the horse's head came up soon after."}
{"text":"Simply amazing! Food was excellent as was the service! If you like homemade Italian food you will love Martorano's."}
{"text":"*  Welcome Experience -  Blatantly Bad  Had the same obnoxious vibe as the decor.  I actually got the impression that the hostesses thought we were lucky to be there.  It's odd, like the employees are \"drinking the kool-aid!    *  Establishment -  Blatantly Bad  This place was obnoxious!  Even for Vegas!  Figure out what you're going to be!  And when you do, STOP taking yourselves so seriously!  The endless photos and looping videos of this owner were over the top obnoxious.  I thought it was humor at one point.  Ugh.   *  Service -  Discouraging  The staff seemed indifferent, until I started asking questions about the owner and the decor.  They CAME TO LIFE talking about the \"story\" of the owner who started as a DJ and spoke so fondly of him.  It was a bit off-putting really.  Then I asked for a substitution and they gleefully pointed at the NO SUBSTITUTIONS banner at the bottom of the menu.   NOPE.  If there's one thing I can't stand it's a restaurant that posts \"no substitutions\" anywhere.  Combine that with the odd gaudy decor, looping video of the odd owner and odd sense of pretentiousness from the staff, I was baffled.  *  Food Quantity / Quality / Presentation -  Ordinary  My entree was ordinary.  Really just ok.  The bread, however was OUTSTANDING.  It really shined with the olive oil.  Very good.  We were a party of seven and everyone's dish was just ok.   *  What I'll remember  The gaudy decor, the odd sense of \"brainwash\" that seemed to captivate the pretentious staff, the endless looping video of the garish owner making pasta.  I'm chuckling as I write this.  So strange.  *  What I can't wait to forget  The gaudy decor, the odd sense of \"brainwash\" that seemed to captivate the pretentious staff, the endless looping video of the garish owner making pasta."}
{"text":"Awesome food and great service. This is a must if you're in vegas!! The meatballs are truly famous. Our waiter Brandan was simply the best."}
{"text":"Food was okay. Bread was nothing spectacular; focaccia would have been much more appropriate. Fried calamari was good. Penne pasta with pancetta was nothing taste worthy. Saffron risotto was just eh. Service from waiter could have been more attentive, especially since there were several unoccupied tables for at least ten minutes.  Hostesses were helpful and friendly."}
{"text":"The chicken parmigiana was absolutely perfect. Large portion, great taste, excellent. I would recommend getting this.  Good service and setting. They also serve bread with olive oil. It is very good and super heavy, so coupled with the chicken, you will be beyond full. No need for a side of pasta or salad unless you want it or are sharing.  I give this restaurant a five stars, highly recommend for the food I had."}
{"text":"We went to this restaurant as a fluke.  We picked up our tickets for the Penn and Teller show and decided to have dinner on site.  We saw there was Gaylord Indian restaurant and were so excited to eat there. Alas, the restaurant closed its doors permanently the week before.  So it was suggested we eat at this restaurant instead.  We should have just driven down the street to the In-n-Out burger for what we endured.   We had to eat at the bar since the dining room was booked up. So we sat next to similar patrons trying kill time before the show.  I noticed immediately that most had left most of their food on their plates. That should have been the warning sign!  We first ordered the spicy calamari.  Can you say rubber! They're we're deep fried rubber bands.  Next was our pasta dishes.  On the menu, there was a \" disclaimer\" that they serve their pasta \" al dente\".  Now we are from Chicago and know Italian food and what al dente is like.  This was NOT al dente!  What we ate was under cooked and tasteless.  I had the spaghetti marinara and my boyfriend clams with pasta.  After the first bite, we both asked for Parmesan cheese and pepper to doctor the taste. It literally took 3 hefty servings of Parmesan cheese to put any flavor or mask the tasteless of the meal.  What added insult to injury, was the price. We paid $99 (with tax and tip) for this atrocity!  If you stay at the Rio or go there for a show do not waste hard earned money, time or taste buds  trying to digest a meal here.  You will just go home feeling frustrated and a little queasy!"}
{"text":"The service was terrible (the waiter ignored that I wanted tap water and \"upsold\" a huge bottle of flat, even though I was dining alone... $7.50).  He neglected to bring me a second glass of wine.  I had the 'special' of lasagna, the sauce had zero flavor (and they were very stingy with it), the sausage/meat mix was terrible, chunks of spice and then chunks of zero flavor.  The homemade mozzarella was good, but definitely didn't make the dish worth the $36 price tag. If you are looking for excellent Italian in Vegas, keep walking."}
{"text":"Overall a good meal. Had meatballs, lasagna and scallops as our group shared. Scallops were a little overcooked but everything else was tasty and service was good. Our server was a little slow, but he tried given it was busy."}
{"text":"It was a hot day in Vegas and the first thing I asked for was a glass of water.  \"No tap water, you need to buy a bottle.  House rules.\"  They gave me a glass of ice and allowed me to wait for it to melt.  We got an eggplant parmesan appetizer that was drenched in far too much salty balsamic vinegar.  The \"fresh\" buffalo mozzarella cheese was the toughest, most rubbery mozz I've ever had.  Fell way below expectations for a $25 appetizer.  Finally, the atmophere was bizarre with old-school Italian dark woods and black and white photos of various actors, but the room is flooded with wacky pink and blue neon lights.  With so many other dining options in Vegas, don't waste your time and money on this place."}
{"text":"After arriving in our room at Paris about 8 pm, my daughter and I decided to eat in the hotel.  We don't particularly do steakhouses, but wanted a substantial meal to share after a long day of travel.  The lasagna was recommended by an employee; it was not on the menu.  There seems to be an \"off the menu\" menu which you have to know to ask for.  They were out of the lasagna so we chose shrimp over spaghetti with a lemon butter sauce and the \"famous\" meatball salad.  The meatball was dense and just ok; the salad was drowning in dressing and basically inedible.  The pasta dish was again just ok.  Mind you, we had no alcohol, one salad, and one entree.  The bill was in the vicinity of $88!  For that kind of money, I expect much, much more. Mediocre, at best."}
{"text":"This was AMAZING Place. The food was sooooo good. Our waiter Paul was great. A little bit of a salesman when it came to the menu. Trying to sell the food off the menu was pretty smart Paul. But great service funny guy. The mozzarella with the tomatoes were so delicious. The calamari was very tender and the fresh ricotta with meatballs was to die for. I am glad I trusted him because he knew what he was talking about when it came to the food. Everything was so fresh. I am so going there next time. I wish I can find a restaurant over here in the valley.  Never tasted anything like it."}
{"text":"Great service. The menus are tablets that are back lit for anyone who has trouble seeing in semi-dark rooms. I had the spaghetti with fresh tomatoes and roasted garlic, which was very good. The bread side came with cheese, olive oil, and a pepper oil - all of which were good. The room is filled with TVs showing old movies with subtitles. I'd  return to this place. Great service, great food, and a great location."}
{"text":"I stayed at the Rio with a small group of friends for one night and we wandered a bit to find this place. The menu sounded appealing and at the thought of carbs and red wine, we jumped.   We were told the way would be 25-30 mins are were surprised when barely 15 mins went by and we were seated in the loudest restaurant I've ever been in. There were five of us and we sat at a large round table and could not hear each other other across the table without shouting and making hand signals. It was ridiculous, although we made the best of it and mostly just laughed at each other trying to understand what the person next to us was saying.  After asking the server to repeat what he had said six times we asked how he managed to keep say in a place so loud. He said he used to wear earplugs. I asked if people complain often, and he said yes, but the chef, this Martorano guy, apparently says if people don't like it, they can just leave. Great business model.   What was even stranger was the movie breaks that came on the TV. A loud, obnoxious song would be playing, and then some iconic clip from a movie would start playing and it was so, so distracting. Don't go hear if you'd like to have a conversations with your tablemates.  The service was okay, but not great. Our server forgot to give us the specials menu after we asked for it and came to take our order and we reminded him of his error. He also forgot an appetizer we had ordered. Who knows if he was just forgetful, or couldn't  hear us.  The food was good, but over-priced, even for Vegas. It didn't blow me away and I could get cheaper, better made food on the strip. I don't need to pay $18 for a meatless entree with canned tomatoes, a leaf of basil and a few cloves of garlic.   Overall, I was pretty unimpressed."}
{"text":"Had an AMAZING dinner here!  Stayed at the Rio and wandered in for dinner not knowing what to expect.  Waiter was very helpful in ordering.... we split the caesar salad (delicious except we asked for anchovies and they were not frsh, most likely canned) and the fried mozzerella and they were awesome!  The fried mozzerella \"bricks\" had a spicy tomato sauce which was to die for.  Entree was rigatoni with pork which was great but we were stuffed by then.  Best meal we had in Vegas!  A little loud in the dinning room but worth it for the great dinner!!!!  Would go back!  DELICIOUS!"}
{"text":"A friend of mine had came here a while back and he would always mention it to me. He raved and raved about it so for his birthday we made the trip out here. I continued to tell him that it probably wasn't going to taste as good as he remembered it but that we'd go anyways.   The food is freshly made to order. The hand stretched mozzarella cheese was delicious until they brought our calamari dish out. I ordered a white sauce clam dish and well I guess I'm not a clam sauce type of girl. I couldn't swallow it down. It was too \"fishy-scented\" for me or whatever that even means to me. I did nibble off someone else pollo chicken pasta dish but honestly with appetizers that good it was hard to compare. The service was great and the bill was great too aka expensive. I wouldn't return because the birthday boy raved about a pork pasta dish that I can't eat. Never say never though maybe appetizer pit stop? Only time will tell. Yeah my review was plain and simple I guess it was just like my dinner."}
{"text":"Italian food is top notch. Have the meatball salad and the Chicken Sicilian, that's all you need."}
{"text":"This place was GREAT. shout out to the server MIKE, he was AWESOME. Also to the busser JAIME he was funny and very attentive.  the food was DELICIOUS!! The service was AMAZING. loved it all."}
{"text":"Yo cuz?\" more like, \"Yo clown!\" I don't understand the hype. I couldn't even find information about this chef on Google. The Italian food was subpar. We had the salad and meatball, penne alla vodka, and chicken parm. The meatball was dry and hard. The salad was fresh and crisp, but we didn't enjoy the meatball sauce in the lettuce. The penne alla vodka was a good size serving, but lacked flavor.   Atmosphere - Don't get me wrong I'm a millennial and we're attached to our phones, but the light up menus and ordering cocktails through an iPad was tacky and unproductive. The Disco Balls hanging from the ceiling and the large Virgin Mary statue was confusing and made me uncomfortable. If you're looking for good Italian food on the strip try LAVO or take a hike to Summerlin for Parma by Chef Marc"}
{"text":"The only thing good about this restaurant was the food. Our waiter took our food order before even asking if we a wanted a drink. We were presented our \"specials\" on an iPad. Who wants to hear about a $52 piece of pork from an iPad picture. The place has sports playing on the flatscreens and disco balls hanging from the ceiling with waiters dressed as paper boys from the 40's. I have no idea what this restaurant is trying to be. Our waiter never came over to check on our meal and we were never asked if we wanted another drink. Our dessert was presented on an iPad. There's nothing 5 Star about this restaurant but the food."}
{"text":"Like eating pasta in the center of a discoteque? As if to outdo the cacophonous chaos of the slot machines on the Rio casino floor below, Cafe Martorano pumps the music so loud I can only make my point by spelling it in capital letters: THE MUSIC IS TOO FUCKING LOUD. You know when a waiter asks if you're ready to order and it usually goes along the lines of, \"Are you ready to order?\" Well, here at super hiptastic Cafe Martorano, it goes like this: \"***********?\"  The asterisks denote what apparently was talking, but all I got from the waiter was a screwed-up face like are you gonna respond.  Well, I have no idea what you just said. The sound system is blasting \"Boogie Shoes,\" and there's a spotlight blinding me every two seconds, and I'm supposed to order from a menu I can't read unless the strobe hits it? I pointed to the pasta I wanted (Orecchiette with Hot and Sweet Sausage, $38), and sure enough it arrived at my table about half an hour later. Maybe they give you extra time for dancing. The portion was huge, the sauce tasty but heavy, and I ate about half of it while watching the party people in the place get freaky to flat-screen displays of Matt Damon taking a bullet to the head."}
{"text":"Still the best! Came here after a few mediocre meals and was SOOO happy with my spaghetti and meatball dinner!"}
{"text":"We were in Las Vegas just recently and had heard about this great place from a friend. So we decided to try it out.  I had the Linguini with clam sauce and the calamari.  It was so delish!!  Our waitress, Jessica was awesome.  So friendly, knowledgable about the menu and gave us excellent service. She made our experience at Martorano's just that much better.  We will definitely be going back and asking for Jessica."}
{"text":"I had high expectations for Martorano's because my Italian friend was raving about it.  Unfortunately I really wasn't impressed.  We started with the Calamari in sweet chili sauce which I thought was horrible.  It was a really easy way to ruin calamari.  Two of my friends liked it, and one thought it was edible.  I guess the deal with this restaurant is that Mr. Martorano knows Italian food and he makes it the way he likes it.  I am NOT rushing to eat dinner at his house.  It was a very Northern Italian style that was heavy on the meat.  His famous meatballs are a mixture of veal, pork, and beef.  I don't eat veal and I'm not really a pork eater so I was not interested there.  The rest of the menu was really lacking.  There was no gnocchi or risotto, only one fish option, and really no salad.  I think if I want some spaghetti, I can make that at home (and better).  So most of the entrees are around $20-$25.  When the waiter said that there was a special of Chilean sea bass, I decided to go for it.  It did come with some awesome spinach with huge chunks of garlic and the herb crust was good, but the sauce was drowning the fish.  It was really heavy.  Although it was my fault for not asking, I was REALLY surprised to see that the sea bass was $48.  The service was seriously lacking as well.  We told our server that we had show reservations and needed to be in and out quick, but he was really slow and often seemed confused about what was on the menu and maybe even just life in general.  He also did a weird crumb relocation rather than cleaning before the main courses arrived.  He started to scrape up the crumbs, but just left the piles he made on the table.  He also started to tidy up a little spill, but half way through just left it.  I've definitely had much better Italian food and would not rush back here anytime soon."}
{"text":"I came here to dinner for the first time last Saturday and it was AMAZING! Our server was fantastic; he was very knowledgeable about everything on the menu and gave us drink, appetizer, and entree recommendations when we couldn't decide. The rest of the staff (manager/hostess) were also extremely nice and genuine asking about our time in Vegas.  The meatball salad and veal piccatta were both absolutely delicious!   Next time we're in Vegas, we will definitely be coming back. Top notch restaurant!"}
{"text":"Service - A little stuck up. Reservations - We went late on Friday night but none was needed. Food - Hit or miss.  Overpriced. 1. Short Rib Bucatini Special - Salty 2. Penne Alla Vodka - Just not memorable. 3. Ricotta Gnocchi - Very dense.  The \"gravy\" was delicious. 4. Sauteed Greens - The spinach was perfectly cooked."}
{"text":"This place is preeeetttyyyy tasty. I was craving Italian food (meatballs specifically) and man am I happy I walked in this place.   I saw at the bar, and was immediately helped. The service here was pretty awesome. I started with the meatball appetizer, and it was soooo good. That is a meal in itself with the bread they give you. The chili oil is really good, too. I didn't finish it all to save room for my main course.   My 2nd course was the carbonara. They actually being out an egg to mix on top of the hot noodles like traditional carbonara. The noodles had a nice chew to them and the pancetta is really good. It's a rather heavy dish though... I could barely finish half. Needless to say, I didn't have room for dessert..... Even though I really wants to try the tiramisu.   Overall, I would definitely come back! It's priced like the rest of the restaurants on the strip, but it's actually really good for Italian food."}
{"text":"The food was good. But the menu is overly, almost obnoxiously, strict. I'm sorry but if I order eggplant parm or chicken parm I should be able to order a simple side of pasta. My friend wanted to order red velvet cake for dessert she was informed it's only an option on the price fix menu. She also asked for mozzarella cheese on top of her pasta and was told no. Like I'm sorry since when is the chefs ego more important than the customers prefrence. Like get over yourself. Also while the decor is aesthetically pleasing the music is way too loud you can not have dinner conversation. It's a restaurant not a club. Unfortunately the restrictions are what left the lasting, bitter, taste in my mouth and therefore I will not be returning nor recommending the resturant."}
{"text":"Excellent food.  The wife and I shared the famous meatball and salad appetizer and eggplant stack and they did not disappoint. Very tasty and well seasoned. The main course of chicken parmigiana and seafood pescatore are both recommended.  Wait staff was very attentive and knew there courses.  Would highly recommend"}
{"text":"Excellent vibe and cool decor. Their macaroni (aka pasta) is excellent. The veal Marsala here is fork-tender and flavorful. The Sunday Gravy is the owner's grandmother's marinara sauce and it is delicious."}
{"text":"This is a return visit as I was here last year and definitely wanted to come back. Martorano's never fails to please.  The food is superb as are the wonderful waiters.   They are attentive and cheerful without being overbearing. I will definitely make another visit here when I next come back to Las Vegas. This is my go-to spot for fine Italian dining."}
{"text":"Cool and fresh spin on an Italian restaurant. Located inside Paris Las Vegas, nearly between the Paris and Bally's casino floors.  This dinner spot is popular and busy! We lucked out with bar seating for our group of 4 around 645pm.   Our bartender and server was friendly, attentive and informative.   Started with the Angel cocktail. A sweet option.  Ordered the Chicken Cutlet Parmigiano. Delivered hot and fresh. Great seasoning and texture on the breading.   Menu is high end. Average entree is $40.  Best to call ahead or reserve a table in advance."}
{"text":"For some strange reason, our concierge recommended this place for family dining with a baby. WOW. That couldn't have been further from the truth.  The food was pretty sensational despite it's high prices. ($14 for still water, really?) I had the carbonara, where the yolk was broke and mixed in table side. Our server advertised it as the best pasta on the menu and his description was right on the money.  The environment, however, was extremely odd. In the light up iPad menu, there's an excerpt somewhat warning of the restaurant's unique style of operation. White tablecloths and embroidered napkins suggest fine dining however TV screens playing movies with explicit content, an obscene amount of disco balls and gaudy neon blue lights complete the interior decorations. Very loud music bounces from current hip-hop to 80s pop to 90s r&b, with the occasional pause and dimming of lights to focus in on 90 seconds of the most vulgar scenes of whatever feature film is playing.  All in all, an extremely strange yet delicious experience."}
{"text":"I must have to say. If you love Italian food this is not the place for you. Husband and I went here last night for our Vday dinner.  One it was not packed and hostess sat us near the outside of the restaurant as if the place was packed inside and that was the only choice. Mind you they knew my husband is a Diamond member. After sitting there and no one offering us any drinks or anything. Finally after 15mins the waiter saw I was upset and I asked him to move us so we can enjoy the restaurant vibe. Then after being moved inside. 3 mgrs standing there doing nothing bug chatting and waiters as well. Just as we were about to leave waiter finally comes over and offers us a drink menu.  So faster forwarding to our meal.  We ordered the meatball salad. It was decent. Wasn't dry but nothing great. I ordered penne vodka and husband ordered the chicken parm. My husband is italian from Brooklyn NY. He judges any italian resturant by your chicken parm. We get our food. Husband looks at his plate and asked the waiter where is the gravy(sauce). Waiter says its under the mozzarella. Husband looks under was like what italian eats dry chicken parm. Waiter brings over a tiny side of gravy and husband again says. Chicken parm is suppose to have alot of gravy. Waiter says we can give you a side of gravy but have to charge you. At this point husband just wanted to eat. So he agreed. Get to my penne vodka. TERRIBLE! Penne vodka is my all time fav and growing up with italians back home in NY. This place should be ashamed to call themselves a authentic italian resturant. My pasta was hard the sauce was filled with onions and garlic.  After a while. The manager comes over and asks how's it going. Husnand states about the Chicken parm. Manager says we serve chicken parm dry like that, just a little sauce under the mozzarella. Husband looked at him and couldn't believe that came out his mouth!  After all said and done. I left very hungry and with an upset stomach just for eating some of the hard pasta. So if you really want a good italian resturant. I suggest Pasta Mia across from the Palms, it's not on the strip per say but if you want some good italian good this is your place. Its authentic and delicious! Oh and very afforable!"}
{"text":"Made a reservation for 6:30, tables were empty and they still made us wait. We sat at the bar and everything we asked for, they we're out of. Finally sat down, service was just okay. Food did not have flavor... I ordered the pasta with seafood and the pasta was not fresh. Shrimp were okay. Clams had no taste.. my husband ordered the sea bass and it was just bland... Will not go there again. Food is over priced. Save yourself money and go to the buffet instead."}
{"text":"It is more an experience than great food.  The risotto was crunchy and disappointing.  It's average Italian food, not great.  The wine somnelier was very helpful though in helping us select a great wine.  All in all, unless we just went for drinks, we would not return."}
{"text":"Love the combo of food, gangster movies and lively music! Service is always great, and the food is divine. My fave is the spicy seafood pasta (it's been presented as a special the times I've been). I had the Lobster Francaise on my last visit, which was a great option - light, flavorful, and the risotto was perfect. From the raves I heard from my friends about their dishes, there really isn't a bad choice on the menu. Lay back, relax, eat, dance in your seat, and try not to watch the gory parts of the movie playing while you eat!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here about 5 times... the food is ALWAYS amazing.... get the cheesesteak and the scallops are as good as it gets however, this last trip there was much better due tothe AMAZING SERVICE we received by Ray and Francisco! we were a large group and they were rock stars! Thank you!"}
{"text":"Excellent food!  Everything is made fresh. Raymond and Francisco gave us outstanding service. We found this restaurant when we were in Fort Lauderdale and loved it!!  So glad we found it here in Las Vegas!  Will definitely recommend!!!"}
{"text":"Other than the hostess being a total snob upon our arrival, we had a great experience at Cafe Martorano (our server was much friendlier, so that took the bitterness out of the first impression.)  I went with the pre-fixe menu, which was actually a great price by Vegas standards - $45 for three wonderful courses. Started with the caprese salad (really fresh and tasty), then the tagliatelle with cream sauce, chicken and peas (rich and delicious), and ended the meal with a sweet cannoli.   Our waiter was really friendly and helpful with suggestions - everyone agreed the portions were HUGE (too much, really), but the food was delicious. It's a nice place in the Rio and I'd definitely go again."}
{"text":"What can I say about this place? I have been to this establishement 4 times, and each time it keeps getting better. I usually scoff at going to restaurants in casinos, but I highly recommend this restaurant if you're looking for excellent italian food, and don't mind it being a little bit pricey.  I had the spaghetti, and I know what you're thinking, just spaghetti? I don't know what they do to the pasta here, but its so good its addicting. I dream of going back to Cafe Martorano and having the spaghetti.  The meatball that I shared as an appetizer was huge! Its definately enough for two people, and like anything else I've had is excellent. Make sure to save some room for dessert! Might I suggest a cannoli?"}
{"text":"This is by far the best ItAlian restaurant.  The service was impeccable and the food was the best. I recommend it very highly."}
{"text":"Attended a Birthday party at this restaurant.  One of the best experiences we had in Vegas on this trip.  Home style Italian food, like your mother or grandmother made.  Service was exceptional as was the Sommelier.  Only negative is the location in the Paris Hotel.  Definitely worth the trek through the lobby/casino area."}
{"text":"I'd give five stars but my long island was weak.  Pretty much enough said but I'll add on just for the thrill of it!  We did a \"no penis allowed\" girls trip to Vegas for my daughter's 21st birthday.  Birthday dinner was here, at Cafe Martorano.  Yo, don't bust my balls, man.  It's pretty upscale the whole way around, you know from the linens to the dishes to the service to the ambience to the nasty dude who was running his hand up the thigh of his \"rode hard and put away wet\" date.   Oh wait, that was just nasty, not upscale AT.ALL.  The bread and variety of dipping choices was yummy, the presentation of the food we ordered was beautiful and the complimentary scallop that the cute waiter brought my daughter for her birthday made me scratch my head.  I told my daughter to smile and say thank you, its not every day a girl gets a scallop for her birthday - even tho she is hella cute!  I find that when I dine at fancy Italian restaurants that I'm hungry not long after - the food is very good but they don't really give you hearty portions.  Or, perhaps I'm just a pig.  This place is expensive so don't be bringing your friends who would have rather had McDonald's here - I swear if I see one more person in my daughter's party roll their eyes at me over the price I'm going to throw a scallop at them!  Cafe M - work on your mixed drinks for me - my twins will be 21 in eight years and I'd like to actually catch a buzz over dinner next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Who are you people?  Seriously.  Who are you people that are leaving 5 star reviews for this joint? Saying it's the best Italian food you've ever had? Seriously?! Are you from Iowa? Have you ever actually had Italian food at somewhere other than the Olive Garden? How can you possibly say this is the nicest restaurant you've ever been to?!  So many questions.  Look, maybe I'm a snob. Ok, I'm probably a snob, but what sort of witchcraft is happening in these reviews? Dangit, that was another question.   Tonight, I'm staying at the Rio, so a friend came by and we decided to hit up the most delicious place ever for dinner: Hash House A Go Go. Alas, the Rio Hash House isn't open at any reasonable hour (despite the lies Yelp spreads), so we had to improvise. Italian sounded good, so despite the kind of high prices, we decided to give Martorano's a shot.   First thing's first: it's a Monday night, not Saturday. I see open tables with my eyes. The girl up front asks if we have a reservation, we say no, and she says there's a 30 minute wait. But. . . there are open tables. . . right there. . . ok, fine.   We wait. We wait 45 minutes. They finally sit us down.  We order some waters and sodas. The waiter brings back our drinks. . . and tiny plastic soda bottles. You know the ones you put in like, a kid's lunch? The little shorty, half size soda bottles? That. No free refills, because our sodas came from tiny little bottles (THAT THEY CHARGED US $3.50 CENTS A PIECE FOR).   Fine. Whatever. We  go to order dinner. I tell the waiter I'd like the 'Chicken Downtown' and he immediately asks if I'd like to order something to go with it. I ask what he means. \"It just comes with like, you know, a big chicken breast with stuff on it. Nothing else.\" Oh, so you're charging $30 for a literal piece of chicken with nothing on the side.   Needless to say, I switched over to pasta carbonara. The bread they bring is good, the olive oil is nice, but the pepper olive oil they bring is. . . not good. It was simultaneously needlessly spicy in a not flavorful way and kind of dull tasting (don't ask me how that makes sense). The Carbonara was alright. We both agreed that had our entrees been $15-$18, we wouldn't be complaining. . . but it was $27 for a bowl of carbonara.  The food isn't bad-- don't get me wrong-- but it ain't great.   The service was meh. The waiter gave off a definite 'bro' vibe and wasn't very attentive. The guy who handled bread and water though was phenomenal.  The decor is very. . . look, you can tell the owner used to be a DJ. Probably in the 90s. It's just a weird vibe. Flashing lights in dated colors, Godfather posters, disco balls, and then tv screens playing The 300 (???). Look, I can dig Vegas tacky, but if I want that kind of Vegas tacky, I'll hop my butt over to the Fireside Lounge in the Peppermill, thank you very much.   Now before you think I'm some sort of tasteless pleb, I assure you that I've got no problem paying much more than even that for diner. . . if it's worth it, but this place is NOT worth it. Not by a long shot. And in Vegas of all places? You have so many more options in that price range.   I'm Italian American and I love quality Italian food. . . but this place ain't it. Don't waste your time and certainly do NOT waste your money. Not in Vegas, not when there are some of the world's best restaurants (even at this price range!) right down the road.   You want some good Italian? Take a cab to Nora's on Flamingo (#1 on Yelp and half the price!). Or if you want the real good stuff, take a cab a little farther to the other side of the Strip and hit up Sergio's on Tropicana. It's kind of old and tacky and ridiculous. . . but holy mother of goodness, it'll be the best vodka sauce you'll ever have. Oh, and they even refill your sodas for free.   EDIT TO ADD: Sorry, I'm deducting a star. Both me and my dining companion ended up sick today (the next day). She actually threw up, I just felt like I was going to for the better part of the day. I literally ate nothing else yesterday but that dinner + some Starbucks in the morning, so it pretty clearly made us ill. Blech."}
{"text":"We truly enjoyed our dinner here. Our pasta dishes were full of flavor and freshness. My husband had Bucatini Carbonara a house specialty. Neither one of us had ever tasted anything like it. Needless to say he cleaned his plate and thoroughly enjoyed this meal. I had the Fusilli Pollo this was delisious. It does have a strong bell pepper flavor something im not used to in my pasta. Our waiter took on the style of the resturant making small tall with us. It was nice to enjoy a different dinning experience with different dishes. We eat out alot and it can get boring. So this was a refreshing fun evening. Oh you must top it ofc with the carrot cake, it is out of this world."}
{"text":"Martoranos.  This was the toughest review to write from my last trip, and not sure I'll convey what happened in this review but I'll try.  We visited the new location in the Paris Las Vegas hotel on 10/21/14.  We had walked by it during the day, thought it looked cool...liked the menu...so researched it a bit while sitting at the pool and decided that we had to go, seeing how SO MANY celebs and notable people ranked Chef Martorano's food SO high!  So we were pretty excited to check it all out and enjoy a great meal.  We were seated on time at a table on the 'outside' of the restaurant, so we didn't get that movies on the wall, disco ball in the center kind of experience...but did enjoy the al fresco style dining and people watching in the Paris shops area.  Right next to us was a group of 8 conventioneers, who were a bit loud from time to time and seemed to dominate the service as you will see below.  We were greeted by Georgio (hope I spelled that right) after a good 5-10 minutes of perusing the menu on our own.  He dropped off an iPad with the drink menu, took our \"flat or sparkling\" water order, and explained the specials for the night, which I took note of a seafood selection that he described as a \"seafood party in your mouth\"...something about that was both comical and odd...not sure why though.  We quickly found out that the iPad was malfunctioning, if you pressed on anything it would just freeze.  So we were unable to check out any kind of special drink selection (we were thinking martini style special followed by some wine with dinner).  Georgio then became a bit occupied with pouring wine for the conventioneers so we were able to flag down his 'assistant' Jason (I think he was an assistant, or in training or something) who quickly brought us a new iPad.  Georgio then came back and took our order...not asking if we'd like to start with an appetizer, not asking if we'd like a drink, but simply saying \"are you ready to order\"...which led to her saying \"yeah I want the martini, the seafood special...\" him looking at me so i had to say \"I want a Manhattan up with Makers, we're splitting the eggplant parm and I'll take the Buitoni Meatball\"...just not how you serve a couple in a high end establishment.  So then another 10 minutes passed.  The restaurant was about 70% full and the bar was not busy.  We had no drinks and had been sitting there for a total of 25 minutes.  Jason kept looking and then came over to say \"didn't you guys order drinks?\" to which he promptly went to the bar and resolved..bringing us our drinks moments later.  Our eggplant parm arrived shortly thereafter and I have to say it was AWESOME!!  Probably the best I've had..and was a perfect size to split with a date.  After clearing the plates and then taking a wine order (glasses, not a full bottle) the night seemed to be moving more smoothly....until the entrees.  My entree came out but her food did not.  Jason was kind enough to explain that the food was all cooked fresh to order and sent as soon as it was ready, that they didn't hold anything in the kitchen.  Ok, I'm cool with that.  But who knew a buitoni (think thick linguini) and meatball cooked 5-10 minutes quicker than some seafood (clams, shrimp, etc..seafood party) over linguni?  Throughout this whole process, Jason was super attentive to our needs and seemed to really try and keep things going...while Georgio was busy trying to be cool, pouring drinks for the big convention table, and coming up with cheezy Italian style lines to say to everyone.  The manager actually came over and apologized, and first offered another glass of wine (which we both had a full glass) so we declined..then said \"well, just pick out a desert and we'll take care of it for you\"...seemed to me a nice gesture and the right thing to do.  Her food finally came out and I do have to say we both LOVED our meals.  I had the best friggin' meatball ever and she had an awesome seafood dish.  The food at this place is worth every penny of the price.  Jason continued to check in on us, making sure things were going smooth...while Georgio continued posturing for everyone.  Ever see a person who thinks he's a special gift to everyone, and has no clue he is actually really cheesy and borderline annoying?  Anyway...  We went on to split a desert (thinking this was on the house)...tiramisu.  Now, I'm not even a fan of tiramisu but holy smokes..it was AWESOME!!  We were then brought the bill...which of course did not have the desert or anything comped...but at that point we didn't really want to make a big deal and just settled up.    Funny that on our way out, we asked to have our photo taken and who stepped up?  Yep, Jason!  We thanked him for taking care of us all night and actually tipped him separate, fearful that the tip on the bill would all go to Georgio.  My hope is that if anyone from the restaurant reads this, GIVE JASON A PROMOTION!  He was outstanding!!  Food: 5  Georgio: 2  Jason: 5  Mgr: 1"}
{"text":"Worst Service Ever. I was with 3 friends and we decided to check this place out.  We were thinking we would have drinks and maybe see.  When we didn't order food right away the waiter obviously got upset.  Suddenly the manager was there asking if we were going to be eating.  We said we just wanted a drink we thought.  He told us the tables were reserved for people who were going to eat.  I looked around and there was maybe 2 or 3 other tables with people at them.  One of my friends began to protest but I was just in such shock I said let's go.  The manager said he was sorry.  No he wasn't.  Don't be rude AND lie to me.  We went to the French restaurant in the Paris and had a wonderful meal and spent over $200.  The service was wonderful.  Martorano's is not friendly.  The food may be good but I'll never get to find out because I was asked to leave."}
{"text":"Wow...this place should not have almost 4 stars.  First off this place was had to find, in the corner of the rio, and empty when we arrived.  Should have gone with our gut and left based on how empty it was.   Ordered a couple drinks to start, including a dirty martini and an old fashioned.  Two very standard drinks but could tell bar tender was an amateur.  Very poorly made.    Before dinner we ordered the Ceprese tomatoe salad with warm mozzarella.  This was the only redeemable value the restaurant had to offer.    For dinner my wife and I split the veal.  This entree was horrible.  It was a very thin layer of veal, topped with a huge amount of bell peppers covered in cheese.  It was like bell peppers with a hint of veal.  Just gross. We ordered a side of gnocchi but the brought spaghetti instead.  Realized there mistake and within 5 minutes brought out the gnocchi, which was disgusting.  Very chalking tasting if that makes sense.  After paying over $140 for two people....we were not impressed at all.  I also didn't like the fact that had bottle of wine and marinara sauce placed all over the bar that was for sale.  I hate when restaurants try to up sell.  Especially when it's not good.  Definitely wouldn't come back, one star all the way."}
{"text":"What restaurant tells you very short and plainly you cannot have any sauce on the side...being Diabetic less sauce is best and our waiter would not even ask kitchen!!  No service which seems to explain low reviews.  Bread good, salad good...."}
{"text":"My husband & I were walking around in the Paris Hotel & we had reservation at another restaurant, but after seeing the menu & the wonderful story of Steve Martorano, we wanted to dine here.  We sat at the bar u til our table was ready & the bartender was great she was so efficient & nice.  We were seated at Yuri's section & he was absolutely amazing.  Yuri was very knowledgeable of hr menu, food, taste etc & proudly would say I've been with this great restaurant for almost 10 years.  We had a wonderful dinner, just simply the BEST of all the choices in Vegas to dine, guess what we came back the next night asking to be seated at Yuri's table.  He remembered us, our drinks, dinners & what else we had looked at the previous night to eat.  It was AMAZING, please Mr. Steve Martorano open a restaurant here in Los Angeles please Malibu"}
{"text":"Absolutely,positively, without a DOUBT, the best food I have ever eaten! The Philly cheese steak and carbonara are a must try and then try again and again. We have driven from Newport Beach to Las Vegas just to eat! Pathetic, I know but it's that amazing!!   Steve is opening another location in the Paris hotel that will be open for lunch too! Yay, now we can eat it twice a day!!"}
{"text":"Just went here last night for fight weekend and I was extremely disappointed. Nice venue, nice atmosphere, and good service but the food quality was not up to par. First off getting your food takes forever because everything is \"made fresh daily\". My husband ordered the carbonara which honestly just tasted like a fancy mac & cheese. I ordered the lasagna and I can honestly say I've had much better lasagna frozen from Costco. In addition the risotto we ordered was way over salted. Overall way overpriced for the quality and taste of the food. Save your money and go elsewhere."}
{"text":"I have been trying to reproduce this meatball for a while. Steve claims to give you the scoop on ingredients and the how to via several youtube videos. But alas there are holes (intentional) in his instruction. I don't blame him and yah, the damn meatball is that good!  The next time your walking the strip and are looking for a light meal and a drink, drop in to Paris, plop your butt on a barstool at Martorano's and order a nice glass of red and the Meatball Salad. Trust me."}
{"text":"This may be a little biased- I grew up on Italian food from a mother who was the most amazing cook. The food in my neighborhood was what we referred to as \"red sauce\" or \"italian-american\". Martorano's took his east coast-italian american food that we all grew up on and brought it to Vegas- and good for him. There is an entire population in Vegas who never had this. I should know, I was there Saturday night with 2 very \"American\" friends from California. They LOVED it. Their review would be 5 stars all the way. I just have had this food so much that it is not unique. Strictly local red sauce grub. I had to explain what \"gravy\" was to my friends - which was pretty funny. I also had to hold my tongue at the \"mark-up\" of Proseco ($15 I pay at the market - $40 at Martorano's) - They gave us a nice tasting of mortadella mouse- it was very tasty. I had the linguine vongoli. I thought it was really good. They are very generous with the clams. Usually, you get such a small amount. Very good meal. My friends got the pasta with fish and liked it and my other friend LOVED the eggplant stack and satueed spinach. Good restaurant for Las Vegas"}
{"text":"Meatball with salad.  The best I ever had.  Homemade mozzarella. Delish.  Loud ass TVs, disco balls, pumping music with interruptions of scenes from The Godfather or Pulp Fiction.....it's weird and fantastic and oh so Jersey Shore.  Don't expect to be able to hold a conversation with the person across the table...make sure you sit side by side, even if you have to move your chair....and for God's sake....guys, feed your girls...and drink lots of red wine.  I love this place because it is SO unexpected...don't like it?  Yo cuz, don't break his balls!  In the words of Steve Martorano...Your sister's ass!"}
{"text":"Martorano's couldn't care less about you - it's all about the 'thug' attitude of Steve Martorano who believes the food is better than reality. The staff has nothing good to say about him.  At the Paris hotel, I had a diabetic blood sugar crash. After starting to recover, I was escorted by the EMS of Paris Hotel to the nearest restaurant with the desire of getting simple carbs into my system. Slumped in a chair and sweating profusely, I had to deal with extensive discussions until the manager finally stated that he refused to let me order anything except exactly what was on the menu. It went so far that I requested a pasta dish from the menu and asked that no \"gravy\" be put on the pasta . . . but charge me full price. \"Absolutely Not\" was the response. It was stated many times that Mr. Martorano does not care about my issues and refuses to make any alterations to any of their dishes - regardless of circumstance. Period.  Aside from this inhumane treatment and outrageous behavior, I was forced to eat Martorano's pasta dish prepared according to 'Steve's' menu requirement. I'm an Italian from New York, my grand parents were from Italy and operated a successful catering business after immigrating to the United States. I know Italian food. I cook and have spent 33 years in the food industry myself, and let me tell you, this food is not authentic Italian. Bread is the most basic aspect of an Italian meal and it should be outstanding. Martorano's bread was absolutely horrible: dry, tasteless and without texture. No kidding, the best part of my meal was the water.    Even if the food had been good, which it was not, how can people tolerate supporting an individual who is so egocentric that he would rather see a patron in distress suffer than serve a pasta dish without his precious \"gravy\" slathered on top. The tone of everything Martorano is negative, offensive, insulting and stinks of a pompous individual who would rather intimidate his customers and staff than be a beloved restaurateur. Steve Martorano needs to grow up and respect the people that spend their hard-earned money on his over-priced, mediocre food served with an attitude.  \"YO CUZ\"!!!!!"}
{"text":"The only thing that saves this place is the chicken parmigiano. The best I've ever tasted,  but just know it is served by itself, no sides. Spaghetti noodles were thick and very good as well. The meatball was average. Gnocchi - a waste, I've had much better.   First, decor was nice but really doesn't match the Paris Hotel feel.   Our waiter Mark...ugh...the only time he became somewhat \"attentive/friendly\" was when he realized we started questioning the bill and asked for his name. He was nowhere near friendly right from the start. When I asked if there was a kids menu he said no in a condescending tone, like I was asking a foolish question.  A more professional response would be \"I'm so sorry, no we do not.\" He asked if we wanted wine.  When a few  (but not all) of us said no, he walked away while my father was still deciding what to get. When my mom said it was my birthday he dismissed it right away but then said a brief (\"I really dont care\" tone) \"happy birthday\" when she repeated it. Also, it was disheartening to see what I think was the manager (heavier set older caucasian man) check on everyone's table except for ours. The only pleasant person was our busser. The host at the entrance wasn't as friendly too.  For their HIGH prices (27-62 per plate) and \"fancier/upscale\" dining we expected more. Shame on you for having worse service than the Applebees down the street from my home. We eat at a lot of classy restaurants but this was truly one of the most disappointing places. Please do not even waste your time."}
{"text":"Great place to stop by the bar for a quick bite and a martini when on the strip. I tried the meatball salad and they do a great job creating a tender meatball. Friendly, attentive service too. Will have to stop by again on my next trip to Bally's or Paris."}
{"text":"Went for a late night dinner at the bar. It was a gorgeous and large space, sexy, open, low lighting.No blaring music, it was kept at a low-moderate volume. You can sit toward's the front or the restaurant and watch people pass by or toward's the back for more intimacy.   We ordered off the late night menu. -Caesar's salad was one of very best I've ever had. -Pizza was okay; fabulous thin crust but the cheese was...weak, flavorless. -Good wine list. I was debating wines and the bartender immediately bought me four to taste based on my stated preferences.  -I went big and had a couple glasses of the Brunello di Montelcino $24/glass. They also had a super Tuscan."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite Italian restaurants. Service was wonderful. We were really impressed by the freshness and flavors of all the food. Our pasta carbonara was decadent. Cocktails were great and there was a fun atmosphere in the restaurant. We really enjoyed our visit and look forward to returning."}
{"text":"This is on the second floor of the Casino area of the Rio hotel in the Masquerade tower. I liked the trendy atmosphere very much. We were by the window with a view of the Rio pool. They have TV's there which were showing old movies and the videos of the owner showing you (what looked like) cooking lessons. Our waitress was friendly. She showed us images of the specials on a tablet- which was a big help, and probably the first time I didn't space out when someone went over the specials of the day.  The food was great. The bread brought before the meal was excellent and since we got there right when it opened, it was nice and warm. I started with fried calamari (San Marzano version) and thought it was great.  I had chicken parmesan, and again, it was excellent. Though, after the bread and the fried calamari, I was stuffed. I might not have a starter next time.  I also bought some of his marinara sauce which is sold by the hostess desk.  Overall, I loved it and I'll be back."}
{"text":"Wonderful salad! So tangy and just perfect with a side of spaghetti. Service on point at the bar. Our bartender allowed us to taste a couple of wines...our favorite touch. Paris!"}
{"text":"Meatball salad appetizer is incredible. Anything with the Sunday gravy (marinara) is worth getting. Veal picatta had a great sauce with a perfect texture. Chicken Parmesan was the best I've had. Wait staff are helpful and prompt. Worth trying."}
{"text":"Food = 3 star (good flavor over all) Service= 1 star (inattentive staff) Atmosphere = 2 star (it's like a disco club. ??, but was clean) Quality = 2 star (food was fresh, but seafood was over cooked. Lobster was like rubber) For such and expensive dish, blah and not worth the price tag(s).  Overall I would've given it a 2.5 or less. For a $$$, not worth it. They wouldn't serve us bread with oil and vinegar until we ordered dinner.....and that was sad. Better to spend the money on a cab and go to a better equipped restaurant for $50+ per person/plate without an alcoholic beverage. It's EXPENSIVE and financially and quality worthy of just going to In-N-Out."}
{"text":"Sure, my review is probably biased. I ate for free. Sure, my review is probably biased. I ate for FREE. Sure, my review is probably biased. I ate FOR FREE!!!  Then again, perhaps my review ISN'T so biased, as I would actually pay my own money to go back here.  Since I became old enough to gamble, I was a fan of the Rio. Why? I don't know, but I just had really good luck gambling at the Harrah's casinos (back when it was just Harrah's and Rio in the lineup).  Of course, with lady luck shining down on me with all her glory, I'd up my antes and win even bigger.  With that came the VIP treatment, for shizzle. After my second trip, I was somehow put in touch with a host, and thus began my long and beautiful relationship with the Rio.  Okay, so Rio sort of lost its charm as I got older, but my all-star host Derek was so great that I couldn't be disloyal and stay anywhere else.  Then again, he DID give me free rooms all the time.  Minor details, I promise.  Derek has moved on to bigger and better things, so I haven't actually been back to the Rio in awhile, but the last time I went, Derek treated me to an AWESOME dinner.  Usually, we go to the buffet (because I used to love the Carnival Buffet), but that particular visit, Derek was incredibly insistent on taking me to the new Italian place that had just opened.  Beggars can't be choosers, so I decided to just roll with it.  And boy, am I glad I did!  Again, I don't know how much any of the dishes cost, as I didn't pay for any of them, let alone look at the menu.  All the wait staff knew Derek personally (apparently, he dined here often), and were quick to serve us up with everything we could possibly need.  Derek just said, \"Bring us all the good stuff,\" and like that, magic happened at our table.  Three different kinds of pasta, a little steak something for me, random meatball thingies, and I don't even know what else.  Here's the thing.  I don't like Italian food.  I generally find it too heavy.  And another thing.  Derek himself is of Italian heritage.  When Derek first sat me down, he said, \"Look, I NEVER eat out Italian because nothing compares to my grandma's cooking. But this place is THAT good.\"  Did I believe him?  No. I thought this was some weird promo that he was pulling on me (which is unlike him).  But no. After my first few bites, I was TOTALLY SOLD.  Everything was scrumptious, tasty, and definitely not too heavy.  As Goldilocks once said after eating Baby Bear's soup, \"This is JUUUUUUST right~\"  The appetizers, entrees, and desserts were ALL amazing.  But the piece de resistance of this place is the DECOR AND AMBIANCE.  Holy cow!  At first, I was confused when the lighting changed from violet to blue.  Were my eyes playing tricks on me?  I was too busy savoring my meal to care if I was going blind.  Then the blue light changed to red.  What the???  That's when I realized that the lighting in the room continuously changes color, dissolving slowly from one color to the next!  It adds a totally colorful and fun element to the whole modern decor, and jeebus, the movies!  Okay, so I'm not a classics-enthusiast in general, but it was really cool to have the music and the lighting interrupted periodically for a short showing of classic scenes from classic movies like the Godfather and whatnot!  Totally a cool and unexpected touch!  The DJ played good (if loud) music, and the staff was totally friendly and enthusiastic!  The best part?  I got to go to the kitchen to see where the magic happens.  Derek introduced me to the chef (he looks incredibly like Vin Diesel - another Las Vegas impersonator?), and he was totally friendly and exuberant.  Just my kind of guy!  This place was freaking awesome.  The experience was freaking awesome.  The fact that it did zero damage to my gambling funds was freaking awesome.  When (and I don't mean IF, I mean WHEN) I go back, there is no way that I'll be able to afford such a varied sampling (I think we had like 10 different plates on our table at one point) of all the scrumptious goodness, but I will be sure to try something different every time, just to get my fill!  Are you thinking about dining here?  DON'T HESITATE.  DO IT.  DO IT. DO IT. DO IT."}
{"text":"I ordered what i thought was the sauce that had everything in it with pasta without looking at the menu and I got something totally different that had fat chunks of stringy pork. Was a bad experience as the manager didn't care at all. I went last month and ate with my Diamond preferred total rewards card and the food was great, they gave me a totally different meal and all i can say is i won't be back. Small portions, unfriendly manager."}
{"text":"First time eating here....and...LOVED IT. There are so many dining options in Vegas- but we will return here!  The service was great.   Our waiter was extremely friendly and attentive.   I love the fact that they show you pictures of the specials. We had the pork chop special and the sea bass with lump crab meat. Outstanding!  They make their own mozzarella and it was wonderful.   Great experience!"}
{"text":"First visit, I arrived as they were opening @ 4:30pm. Ordered meatball & salad. $20, one Meatball was good but not enough sauce., salad had to much dressing and only had lettuce and tomato. Waiter service was okay. Pricy."}
{"text":"I went here with a friend. The food was so good. It reminded me of the type of italian food i used to eat on the east coast. It was fresh and tasty. The only areas that could use a little improvement was the time it took for the order t come out and the presentation of the veal. Other than that this is the place to go for real \" Sunday Gravy\" and good food. It is a bit unassuming when you walk by. However, you need to stop! go in and try the food. I reco the cheesesteak sandwich and the meatball salad. A very generous and flavorful salad accompanies a gigantic meatball and plenty of ricotta cheese. The gravy is flavorful and good.   On the veal, i would have dressed it up with some gravy over the top of it and some fresh basil and oregano to give it some depth and color. The taste was good. It was tender and not chewy.   Will i be back, ABSOLUTELY!!!  Already booked a party there.   PS they have tis all around the rest. We were having a terrific meal whilst watching the God Father.  Cannot get better than that!!"}
{"text":"It was ok overall. It's pretty and crisp and has good energy BUTTT they do NO SUBSTITUTES... Meaning you cannot even add chicken to your Cesar salad!!!! You can not substitute your favorite pasta. They cook al Dante but I prefer mine a little over cooked and softer, the ends on some strands were out right hard. But my carbonara sauce was delicious. But I was just especially disappointed that we couldn't add chicken to a salad!!!!!"}
{"text":"This is seriously the only good thing we experienced at Paris. We were so disappointed with everything else, but this saved our evening there.  We didn't order anything to eat, but we came in for a drink at the bar and were pleasantly surprised. The bartenders were super nice, attentive, and knowledgable about their selections. It was nice being able to chat a bit about the different wines they carried and they offered me a few to try based on my preferences. We were impressed.  The decor is interesting with blue lighting and very modern. Not exactly what I'd expect from an Italian restaurant. We came in on a Sunday evening and it wasn't too busy. We were greeted right away when we stepped up and got a seat at the bar. The bartender came over right away to help us.  Although I don't see us ever staying at the Paris Hotel again, if we were in the area and wanted to grab a drink, we would totally come back here. I'd even be open to trying it out for dinner."}
{"text":"I wasn't sure what to expect when I sat down last night, it officially opens this weekend so we were sampling it pre-grand opening. We had fantastic service and the food was incredible! If you're looking for a great authentic Italian meal--THIS IS IT!  I liked the ambiance of restaurant blue light accenting the walls, pictures in black and white (one of the owner), tvs on walls playing movies with subtitles on, and music going. The menus are electronic, a little heavy.  But each table got an ipad that displayed drinks (wine list, cocktails), daily specials. It was very high tech!"}
{"text":"Based on the reviews, it seems you either love or hate this place.    That's what originally drew me to it, i had just checked into my hotel some firends and family to celebrate my 21st, and in amongst some downtime and getting unpacked, i immediately started thinking about where to go prior to the nights out that were soon due to come.  So i opened \"THE BOOK\" in The Hotel and while flipping through the pages i noticed an add for an Italian Cafe that had the picture of a big guy (Vin Diesel Looking) and a 2 paragraph dissertation on how his cafe became.    The long and the short of the ad, is that he loved to cook since he was young, so he calls himself a cook not a chef, and does things his way.  Basically the story said;  A customer came in once and was insisiting that he turned down the music, and he politely said \"Sir, this is the image that my restaurant upholds and what we are, so i'm sorry i cannot do that.\" The customer became extremely mad and began to demand and yell at the owner, and the owner told the man to get up and GTFO!  As soon as i was done reading that, i was sold, \"This was a place i must check out\", mainly becasue it's rare that people and restaurants now a days still have a backbone, and don't let people walk all over them.  The theme of the restaurant is his way or the highway, where from 5-7pm music like sinatra is played, then from 7-8pm it's 80's music, and then from 9-close is club style hip hop since the restaurant turns into a 1/2 club at night.  And throughout any of this, the music will pause, the lights will dim and all of the many plasmas on the walls will show one of his favorite scenes from one of his favorite moives (casino,the godfather, knockaround guys.....) and then quickly before anything gets too gory the music resumes and the lights come back up.   The food, is the best hands down italian food i have ever had and 1/2 of my family is from a little family owned city in northern italy called consa.  We ordered the chef's choice which is an (5 course) assortment of food both on and off the menu, and whatever the owner/cook feels like making.  It was a bit pricey ($125 pp for chefs choice) but i know there are other things for sub $30 and $40 on the menu, plus it's vegas, what isn't pricey if it's not good, i mean really good.  You get what you pay for and you're not in vegas all the time, so indulge a bit.  We also had a personal wine concierge that helped us select wine throughout the meal, and our waiter who's name was meatball was extremely helpful in preparing us for what we were about to experience (the most food in one meal i have ever seen).  One of my personal favorites was the crab and lobster stuffed shellfish (that was not on the menu).  Holy mother that was good!  They also have a more than capable bar, and you can take a photo with \"the cook\"  All in all, it was hands down my favorite place to eat in vegas, and i will definately be returning when i go back there.  If you want some killer italian food, and a memorable atmosphere, you must make a stop here."}
{"text":"This is the second time we've dined here. The first time was in Harrahs in Atlantic City and it did not disappoint ! Paul out server over at the Las Vegas location was awesome! Im so stuffed!"}
{"text":"Family Style This was our convention group dinner.  They closed the restaurant to accommodate over 200 of us.   The restaurant is on the second floor of the masquerade tower at the Rio Hotel.  It over looks the swimming pool.  It has a nice long bar  They had 3 TV in the main dining area, two of which was playing Godfather II, Sweet.  Music playing and disco lights on.  A really nice place to have dinner.   Here's the rundown: The Best Meatball & Salad \"Signature Martorano Meatball\" I have to say, the meatballs are really good. It  was serve with ricotta which made it taste better. The salad it came with was just okay.   Fried Calamari w/ Sweet & Spicy Chili Sauce   This dish was my favorite of the night. Nice size calamari. Perfectly fried. That sweet & spicy chili sauce was dynamite. So good. Thinly sliced Serrano chili rounded this dish nicely  Fried Mozzarella Stack \"Tomatoes, Prosciutto di Parma, Aged Balsamic Vinegar & Extra Virgin Olive Oil\" This was another winner. A thick piece fried nicely and tasted great with the prosciutto and balsamic vinegar. Yum!!  Rigatoni Pollo \"Diced Chicken Cutlet, Hot & Sweet Peopers, San Marzano Tomatoes & Reggiano Parmesan Cheese\" the rigorous was a bit too Al dente for me. The taste was good, just not pasta part for me.   Chilean Seabass Scampi Style w/ White Wine, Garlic Butter, Peas & Cherry Tomatoes. The Seabass was just so buttery, melt in your mouth delicious. The white wine sauce complimented this dish   Chicken Downtown \"Chicken Cutlet, Ricotta Cheese, Spinach, Mushrooms, Vine Ripe Tomatoes & Fresh Mozzarella\" a nice well rounded dish. Crunch from the chicken cutlet and a very flavorful sauce.  Red Velvet Cake. The cake was very moist with a cream cheese frosting. A nice way to finish our meal.   The service was excellent. Sparkling mineral water was refilled constantly. Plates cleared efficiently. Dishes explained as they are served.   What an Italian feast!! Family Style!!"}
{"text":"Food was excellent. Server took good care of us.  A bit pricey,  but it was a special occasion.  We would definitely come back when in Vegas again."}
{"text":"This place I have passed by any of trips to Las Vegas, decided to go and it was fantastic, from the waiter Paul & his busser Charles they were very helpful to make our dinner & nite memorable, the food was delicious from the caprese salad right down to the chicken permagian, we will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"I was stationed in Sicily for three years. I love carbonara and ate it all over Italy.  I'm not sure where the chef learned how to make it but it couldn't of been in Italy. It was an extremely heavy thick dish. It should be much lighter. It just sat in my stomach all night.  The manager came by and asked how we enjoyed our half eaten meal. I told him the truth and he had nothing to say and just walked away. I guess they only want to hear compliments. Definitely will not return. Even the waiter had an attitude. I will say the bread was pretty good though."}
{"text":"I have waited two weeks after eating at Martorano's to write this review, in order to take some of the emotion out of my review.  I left there disappointed, because I like Paris Las Vegas so much.  But if you're looking for Italian in Las Vegas, you can do so much better.  It was fairly simple to get a reservation the same day.  People on walk-up at 8PM were told about a 45-minute wait which, on a holiday weekend in Vegas, still seemed reasonable.  Greeter staff was nice.    Our server was polite, but was very busy in another part of the restaurant.  We waited almost 10 minutes after ordering drinks to get them, and it was only because our assistant waiter (the busboy) saw us looking around, and was alert enough to ask if there was a problem.  Martorano's boasts about their meatballs.  The meatballs get lots of hype.  And the meatball appetizer is OK, but not life-changing.  If you've ever eaten in Little Italy in any city, or at a decent Italian restaurant anywhere that makes its own meatballs as opposed to using those from their foodservice, you'll think the same.  The presentation is nice, but for $20, I expected more from a meatball.    The food was very good.  Please don't mistake the tone of my review, accentuated by what happened when ordering, for putting down their food.  It's pricey, but it's The Strip.  I had Veal Parmigiana which came with NOTHING for $42.   My problem came when I tried to order a side dish.  I wanted a side of pasta, but too much tomato is a very bad thing for me, and I was already having it in the veal. The waiter knew this, because I asked for very light sauce with the veal.    I asked if they could do the pasta with just butter or oil and garlic - very simple, staple ingredients in any restaurant kitchen, let alone an Italian kitchen.  I was told NO, right away.  No discussion.  The restaurant has a firm \"no substitutions\" policy.  I explained to the waiter that it was something akin to a food allergy, and he told me there was nothing he could do.  The answer was NO.  So I asked just for some plain spaghetti, no sauce.  I was going to be sneaky and just take the butter from the bread and put it on the pasta.  Guess they were two steps ahead of me, because that wasn't allowed either.  I was going to take the spaghetti with marinara and LIKE IT!  OK - no side dish.  And, it's not as though Tomato was going to kill me.  I wasn't going into shock...just some discomfort.  But, no dice.  The waiter sensed my displeasure, and the GM appeared later.  He apologized for not being able to accommodate my wishes.  He told me that the chef had full control over the kitchen, and he was adamant about there being no changes and no substitutions for anything on the menu.  I asked to speak to the chef, but was told \"Oh, he's not here, he's in Dallas...but he reads feedback comments you leave when you sign your check\".  For the record, as polite as my comments were, he never responded.  It was simply the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard of.  Celebrity Chefs everywhere make accommodations for guest requests that aren't outrageous. I mean, I wasn't asking them to make me gluten-free pasta.    We ate our entrees - which were good.  Nothing memorable, but good.  We skipped dessert and coffee.  The heavy word:  There are WAY TOO MANY CHOICES for great Italian in Las Vegas - and within a 10 minute walk of this place - for any restaurant to be less-than-accommodating.  I'm not saying you won't have a good meal here; but you can do better."}
{"text":"Great place for amazing food as always. Thanks to Steve for bringing this restaurant from Florida to Vegas."}
{"text":"The food tasted good but my stomach hurt shortly after...  My friends' tummies were OK so guess it was just me.  The restaurant claims to have famous meatballs and their meatballs are indeed tasty."}
{"text":"Service was great. The tomato mozzarella starter was wonderful. All 3 main meals were below average. There are much better Italian restaurants in Vegas and for half the price."}
{"text":"Definite 5 stars plus! Great food. Exceptional service. I had the meatball mozzarella appetizer and a dessert and I was stuffed. The server was knowledgeable and very pleasant. Convenient location right outside of the Paris hotel. The movies that were played made dining feel like I was at home. Beautiful decor as well."}
{"text":"This is supposed to be a fine dining restaurant however..... Do not expect to change one single thing on the menu, even if you have food allergies.  Too bad! Sorry for your luck!  Don't even ask for salt!  They will not even put the sauce in the side!!!! Eggplant stack was delicious, so was the mozzarella appetizer.   The pasta bolognese was over priced and was not worthy of a fine dining restaurant.  Yo cuz!  Get with the times,  people make changes to the food based on allergies and so that they can enjoy your food, you need to understand that and give a little on this harsh policy!."}
{"text":"I've seen the reviews and I have dined at many a restaurant and I can say that this place served me the best meal that I have had in Vegas.  We were hungry and lazy and decided to dine in the hotel and were quite pleased with our choice. Let it be known that we did not order off of the menu, the night that we were there there were two special, one sea bass in a white wine and butter sauce with polenta and the other was a linguini with lobster and prawns. I swear my pasta kept getting better and better as I got closer to the bottom of the bowl.  And my friends sea bass was melt in your mouth delicious.  Our waiter Chris was nice as well."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, excellent service, food was much better than I expected...I recommend ordering the meatball and salad combo; one their signature dishes, My wife ordered a cabanara dish that was just right...I had a pasta and meat dish that was delicious, would definitely visit another Martorano's"}
{"text":"Place is empty and the they told me there is nothing available...dah i can see all the tables are empty"}
{"text":"Always a great place for dinner or a drink with a quick bite to eat at the bar. I'm from the same neighborhood as owner Steve Martorano back in south Philly and friends with 2 of his family members. Martoranos is the only place you will find authentic south Philly Italian cooking. The staff are all very welcoming and friendly with Jeff the general manager and Steve an Bethany the bartenders. My first night there I remember ordering nearly $200 worth of food and drinks for myself and sampling the menu. All of which exceeded my expectations. If you're arriving there just for only a quick bite at the bar a must have whether its your first visit as a tourist or a regular is the homemade meatballs. It's well worth it. The cannoli deserts are amazing, as well as the pasta, risotto, and most importantly the friendly attentive service and overall dining experience."}
{"text":"Staff was very friendly and helpful with the menu. We sat on what would be the outside. We ordered what they call family share appetizers. It basically came with five full size appetizers but you only pick three. We had the salad, calamari, and meatballs. Just amazing. All three tasted great. I wanted gnocchi for dinner. So I had to order an entree in order to get that as a side. Turns out gnocchi is only a side not an entree. No you cannot order it alone. The gnocchi was big enough for a meal. I took my entree to go. Just remember...no substitutions allowed! But seriously great place and food. I definitely want to eat here again."}
{"text":"Basic Italian food nothing spectacular. Portion sizes are decent. The meatballs are sworn to be the best but they contain too much bread. There menu is limited. The ambiance is nice and the service is good. Most items are a la carte. Won't go back."}
{"text":"Italian food was tasty but alittle too spicy on some things ordered. Chicken had sauce alittle too spicy as well as my spinach. If you like spicy this is the place for you. I don't think I will come back here"}
{"text":"This dude Steve Martorano knows his way around the kitchen.  I first visited his Ft. Lauderdale location a couple of years ago, and I ate there twice in one weekend.  I love Italian food and if you do too, do yourself a favor and check this place out.   This was my first visit to the Paris Las Vegas location, and it did not disappoint.  We started with the Homemade Mozzarella with olive oil and sea salt and it just melts in your mouth.  Then I had the Martorano Salad which was popping with veggies, something I love.  For dinner, I went with the Veal Cutlet Martorano which is topped with San Marzano tomatoes and this dish has an amazing combination of sweet and hot that balances your taste buds perfectly.  The table also split the Bucatini Carbonara, which is full of creamy goodness and the pasta is amazingly fresh.    This guy knows Italian food and he is a big guy so the portions are quite large.  I see a lot of people on this site reviewing this place as too pricey and that could not be further from the truth.  Each dish contains large portions, even the salads, so pack an appetite.  If you're looking for a $10 Chicken Parmesan, go to Olive Garden, this place is not for you."}
{"text":"I came here expecting this place to be over rated and it turned out to be some of the best Italian that I've ever had. Best in Las Vegas. The seafood spaghetti had so much flavor that just a tiny taste of the sauce had punch. The appetizers are divine, great vegetarian options and the dishes tasted traditional and homemade. I loved it and can't wait to go back.  I did find a hair in my red velvet cake and they accidentally gave me someone else's doggy bag but the food was so good I'm willing to overlook it. LOL!"}
{"text":"We came here for a business dinner, a huge party taking up 2 huge tables. We ordered a family style feast that consisted of sausages, meatballs, mozzarella, pastas, and dessert. The waiters were very attentive and did a great job with our drinks and clearing up our table. Although, they did give my wife a Mojito instead of a Moscato. Easy mistake considering the place is  loud. Besides their efforts, everything else was awful! The sausage and meatball was ok. The sausage was dry and the meatball was really nothing to rave about.  The pastas were under cooked. I am not sure whether it is the way we ordered our food but I've had better at a fast food joint.  What makes things worse was the atmosphere in there. Very Guido! They were playing on the TV's Martorano cooking 2 meals which looks like something my 9 year old cooks. And in my opinion he looks like a bulky version of Mickey Rourke?.? Which adds to the Guidoness. What also adds to that is that they also showed and blasted scenes from the Godfather and Casino where they F-bombed every other word. That made part of our group who are devoted church goers very uncomfortable."}
{"text":"Delish!!! Top notch service and food. The meatball is to die for and can't complain about the chicken parmigiana, calamari or gnocchi either."}
{"text":"Raymond was awesome!!! Really good food and service! I got the carbonara mhhhhm goooood!"}
{"text":"Great service from beginning to end. We started with an appetizer called Fried Calamari Bibzy which is out of this world delicious!!!  We ordered the Spaghetti Pescatore and the Spaghetti D.O.P. - both were very delicious!!!"}
{"text":"Let me say the review has nothing to do with the food. Been to the one at rio food was awesome service just as good atmosphere amazing.   Service at Paris horrible and slow. They had no personality, just not friendly.  Waited for service a long time then no interaction at all, very different from Rio.   Food. I ordered exactly the same items as last time. Meatball and salad. It was the same, delicious. Bread with oil very good. Spaghetti Dob also very good.   Atmosphere....none there were tons of empty tables inside the restaurant where the theme and atmosphere are yet they sat us on top of a huge party outside in the walkway to hear and see all the drunks walk by, so no atmosphere on the patio....again way different than the cool setting at the Rio with Rocky movies and music."}
{"text":"Food was good, but over priced. 4 people, and we paid $180, no alcohol, just one apetizer and some pasta dishes.   Service was amazing. But the reason I am giving this restuarant 1 star is because they played SCARFACE while I was having dinner with my small chiildren! How can an \"upscale\" restaurant play a rated R movie, which portrays violence, in a setting which is supposed to be relaxing, romantic and classic We had to leave in the middle of our meal, no time for dessert and rush through a few bites My husband had to remove my children from the table during one of the killing scenes I addressed this with the manager, and he didn't seem interested in what I had to say  DO NOT GIVE THIS RESTUARANT ANY BUSINESS!"}
