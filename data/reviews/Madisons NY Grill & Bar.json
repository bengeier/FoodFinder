{"text":"À chaque fois, je suis déçue. La bouffe est correct mais c'est vraiment trop cher pour ce qu'ils offrent. Il devrait au moins y avoir une table d'hôte."}
{"text":"This place was actually not too bad. Reasonably priced and HUGE portions. The service was great and I'm going to go back for Sunday's 2 eat for 22$ on the rib plate with fries."}
{"text":"Excellent chain. The steaks are always delicious here (I am not a fan of ribs in general so I never get them) and I got the ribs here but found the sauce way too sweet (as usual..).  I'd suggest the steak. Forget the salads and all that other stuff, it's a BAR and GRILL. Don't order chicken and seafood from a place that deals in STEAKS and RIBS. If you want chicken, seafood and salads, go somewhere else that specializes in that."}
{"text":"Love this place and the ribs are just the way I like them. The service is fast and friendly so that's nice. The booths are nice and comfortable so you don't feel all cramped out.  The portions are very huge so make sure your hungry.  You have to go on Sunday for the 2 for 22$ deal if not it is too expensive. Went on a regular night and had 2 steak, 2 beers and an entree and it was with the tip 86$ so its a bit much. Also the drinks like Martini 10$ that is a bit much if I can't"}
{"text":"Ive been to this particular location several times and it seems to me that they are friendlier and put more care into serving food that is on par with the Madison franchise. The 2 for 22 special is a very good deal especially if you like ribs, even though they recently removed the clam chowder from the deal. I highly recommend visiting this place on sundays if you want to treat yourself."}
{"text":"I'm caught between a 3-4. This place was a 3.5 star experience.   You know when you go for a day trip to the States, and you're exhausted from shopping and you just want to eat at a sit-down restaurant that doesn't have golden arches (McD's, I'm talking to YOU!)  You would go to somewhere like Madisons.  Casual restaurant, and all brown errythang (...as in furniture). The service is quick and the meals are well-priced for the portions!   I ordered the crab cake sandwich, which was about $15 and came with fries, garlic mashed potatoes or steamed vegetables. I had the side of garlic mashed potatoes. My friend ordered the smoked salmon sandwich with fries. Cleverly, we split our dishes so we could each sample each other's.   Huge portions. Think you're struggling to get through the main meal? Try finishing the sides as well!  First of all, I could barely fit the sandwich in my mouth! The crab cake sandwich was a little flavourless; I couldn't taste really what I was eating. Could've been fake meat for all I knew. The garlic mashed potatoes were decent. Needed a little more garlic or butter.   The smoked salmon sandwich had a wad of salmon in it. Not smokey, and pretty salty. I wolfed it down regardless.   Now let me get to the fries. If you have to choose between the 3 side options, go with the fries. I love 'slim' fries, like McDonalds style (none of this potato-wedge business). They give you a lot. And a lot of mayo and ketchup to go with it. Man, maybe I should've just ordered fries...forget the sandwich!"}
{"text":"Great service. We liked our waitress she was very nice. Food was ok a bit expensive for the taste. If we ever eat there again it'd be because it's practical since we live close by."}
{"text":"Walked in, waiting to place an order for takeout .... Waited at least 15 minutes to be attended to. Jan-27-2018. Garbage."}
{"text":"I'm torn between a two star or 3 star. It's over priced for no reason ($18 for a chicken salad???), but the food is tasty. The staff was nice, but it was a friend of friend (so maybe that's why?). $8 for a beer??? I don't know. For the price I could go to a much better resto. It was half decent..."}
{"text":"Not my favourite restaurant. Ok food , nothing special that mark this place. Good selection menu , good all around without having a distinctive touch or flavours not found in similar type restaurent. What bothered me is the reception ( we were 7 and they refused to make one table outside (rule of the restaurant)  even though it was almost empty. I would had left if it wasnt for the others (really hungry  ) we end up sitting inside in a beautiful sunny day. Server was ok we had to remind him that we still are during lunch hours so we need lunch menus,  the order was quick and it was a relatively short wait for the food to come (almost empty restaurant) . I liked the club sandwich, good flavor and felt fresh ingredients. Not a great selection for kids and the restaurant did not feel kids friendly. In general we all had good meals but like i said nothing that you could not experience in a quick bistro or casual places and definitely with a higher price tag. I dont think i would choose to go back but would not object going there as part of a group ( and definetly not when i need distinctive dishes or sitting outside )."}
