{"text":"Today was the day that we were able to finally go to Cherry Street Restaurant for brunch! 

They have parking spots and a bus stop on the corner - take the Pape 72A to get there. It is walking distance from the Distillery District, just head down Cherry Street. 

The restaurant is in a historical building that has been renovated to perfection. The exposed brick and windows make this a cheery place to have brunch. 

The brunch menu had several choices. I had the Eggs Florentine served on a toasted Croissant with some hash browns. The portion was perfect. Everyone else was quite pleased with their selections. 
  
I would recommend it for a nice relaxing brunch that is off the beaten path that won't break the bank."}
{"text":"Great place to eat.  Warm, clean, and inviting.  
I love the Thursday night Jazz series they are having.  It has a nice initmate setting that is just right for a cozy night out."}
{"text":"Love the casual atmosphere here - very laid back. Definitely not a fast-paced restaurant. Food orders do not particular fast, even for simple meals, but if you have good friends and a drink to chill, and not particularly starving, then you'll be fine."}
{"text":"Excellent brunch place.  Out of the way halfway between Lakeshore and Cherry Beach in the east end of the city but fantastic renovation, great diner food and excellent service.  This will definitely become a favourite."}
{"text":"waited for over an hour for our food, and received a bland, burnt meal. We weren't offered anything \"on the house\", despite the ridiculously long wait for a not so busy restaurant. Will not be going back."}
{"text":"I hosted a private event with Cherry Street. It was wonderful. We had the entire restaurant to oursevles and our group of just over 50 people. Since the weather was nice we had the buffet outside and most people spent the evening outside looking at the skyline.

The food was excellent (we had several different kinds of smoked meats and they even specially made some veggie wraps for our vegetarian friends), the drinks were great, and the staff went out of their way to make the event perfect. We couldn't have asked for a more delightful evening."}
{"text":"Nice place on cherry street near the waterfront. The breakfast is always good. Been here many times and it's always good. The food is good and service is excellent. They also serve Starbucks coffee. Very bright. Large windows. The place was fully restored a few years ago. Free parking in the back. They also have a nice patio. Prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"We had an early dinner here after attending a nearby event. The food and service were great. Our group got a range of different meals; salads, avocado chicken wraps, chicken wings, and fish & chips. Everything came out the kitchen fresh & tasty and well presented & appealing. The resturant itself was very clean and had outside seating. I would definitely stop in again to relax and grab a good meal."}
{"text":"Ok folks, let me start off by saying, they tried, but it did not get better.  Only worse.

We were planning to go to the Cherry Street Restaurant for some drinks and snacks/lunch after a friendly game at soccer world, it's super convenient being a short walk from there.  Knowing we would be 2 teams worth of people, we had someone call a few days prior to make a reservation and check that they could handle a group of about 20.  They seemed psyched to have a large group coming to sit on their nicely appointed patio.   Here's what happened:

Arrived, sign on patio says it's closed due to thunderstorm - yes thunderstorms forecasted for later in the day however - not a cloud in the sky.

Asked about our reservation, no one knew of any reservation for 20 people. 
 
The waitress spilled her tray of drinks down one of our party's back, not a little spill, but completely down the girl's back.
I mean accidents happen, she was really sorry, they cleaned up, we moved on.  However this serves as foreshadowing for the rest of the experience...

Due to the spill, the manager said he would set up the patio for us - great!

Waitress took our orders, wrote down our names, and what we ordered, as we forewarned we would need separate bills.  We went outside and were seated.

We waited over 20 mins for the first 4 meals to come out. the last people who ordered got their meals first.  

We waited another 10 mins before another round of meals came out, my buffalo chicken sandwich was a bun with 3 pre-made chicken fingers, a strip of bacon, and a dab of BBQ sauce.  Not quite the chicken fingers tossed in buffalo sauce as described. no other sauces or toppings on my sandwich either.  By this time the first 4 people had finished their meals.

The next round of meals comes out, most of the orders are missing things. They brought out another buffalo chicken sandwich, yet I was the only one who ordered it...
Next round of messed up meals comes out.
Wait, didn't the waitress write everything down???

We complain to the manager.

By the way there are still a number of people who have not got any food yet. 
For simple sandwiches, and brunch items with eggs, it's taking a looong time.

It just continued to go downhill, I think our original waitress was hiding from us, the girl bringing us our food called the other an idiot, the manager tried to smooth things over, finally everyone got food - except one person.  

At this point our original waitress came out of hiding and blamed the 2 person kitchen, said she didn't know what was going on and would get the last person their meal.

She brought out a wrap - friend ordered a smoked chicken dinner.  This is not gonna work.  Waitress said \"she was used to hearing certain things said a certain way, this is what you ordered.\"  Really? You're going to tell someone they ordered wrong?

Manager says this meal is free and will bring the right one. 
Meal comes out, waitress slams it on the table, correct sides, but instead of the half smoked chicken, we are pretty sure they took the undercooked chicken breast from the wrap and put it on the plate. 

Manager comes out and says: \"This is probably the worst dining experience you've ever had, everything is free.\"  And walks away.  Basically he just wanted us out of there.

And so we left.  Never to return.  
(I'm leaving out a lot of back and forth with the manager, and attitude from 2 servers.  The food was not good either.  Just don't go.)"}
{"text":"Loved the write up on this restaurant and thus thought to venture down. Food was good, omelette was lukewarm and I think because of short staff in the kitchen. Super large patio - had it not been 31 degrees Celsius outside we may have done so. I had a 416 draught beer that was perfect for the day (Amsterdam light lager) and went down quickly. My son and I had the breakfast burrito which really one should eat with the spicy mayo as my son didn't and was not as good as mine. WINGS are over priced for how many there were on the plate. This a great place to eat if you are going for the kart track and or the docks. Just down the street at the lake is the Cherry beach so go for a bike ride and have a break on the patio with a beer and something to eat - perfect for that."}
{"text":"Went there before a Cirque show last week. Nice place. Good atmosphere. Very good service, however the food was not great. A lot of the stuff on the menu on their website wasn't on the menu we were given. My friend and I both had the beef dip and it was one of the worst I'd ever had. It was dry and bland and the bun was stale and crumbled when trying to eat it. It came with a side of homemade chips that weren't bad. My other friend had a buger which she said was quite good. For the price and quality of the food we had, I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"I ventured to this location before heading to see Cirque de Soleil across the street. We arrived at the perfect time before the crowd shuffled in. The patio is quite pretty as is the interior of the venue. They have made incredible improvements.

The drinks were great and the servers were friendly. The food on the other hand wasn't all that incredible. I got chicken wings (which you could only get with Franks Red Hot Sauce). I asked for sauce on the side and I literally got deep fried chicken.... no seasoning, nothing. It wasn't the greatest. My BF got the Club Sandwich which he said was good....

We would definitely go back for the atmosphere. The food, has left something to be desired."}
{"text":"This is the second time for me. The big breakfast is really big and delicious. It's awesome after two hours of work out. The staff is very friendly and helpful. The place is cozy and clean. I'm definitely going back again."}
{"text":"Beautiful atmosphere good drink selection nice staff haven't tried foods yet but can't complain."}
{"text":"Wouldn't stay for the diner ambiance but they do have a patio. It was counter service only, so you'd order drinks at the bar and food from inside (and then they bring the food out to you). There were quite a few flies, but that's just the reality of being outside in proximity to the lake. 

We had the pulled pork and brisket sandwich, which was $9.50 each with no sides. I liked the texture and softness of the bun, the meat itself was pretty rich and greasy. It's a convenient stop if you're in the area already, and there's free street parking as well, but we wouldn't make it the main destination."}
{"text":"Went for brunch today.  I had not been there prior to the renovation.  The space is comfortable with large windows, exposed brick and wood.  There is a huge patio that will be pleasant when the weather is nice.

The good
Fair size portions at very reasonable prices.  We had eggs, toast, sausage, potatoes and fruit for $6 and poached eggs with salmon on a croissant with potatoes and fruit for $10
Excellent service.  Two staff (possibly one was an owner) came by to ask if the everything was OK
Plenty of parking and no wait for a table

The bad
Hard to tell if they are open.  Sign inside tells you hours are 6am to 6pm"}
{"text":"My fiance and I stumbled upon this place during one of our many walks around the city of Toronto.  We were greeted right away by a waitress and she was very friendly.  The restaurant itself looks very clean.  It is a casual setting and I liked how it wasn't too busy.  My fiance ordered the \"triple decker club with grilled chicken, bacon, tomato, micro greens and chipotle mayonnaise\" and I ordered the \"beer battered fish and chips with dill sour cream and a house salad\".  First of all, the portions are ENORMOUS.  Bring a big appetite or share a meal with someone because I don't know how anyone can finish one plate.  The french fries were delicious!  They didn't taste like they were sitting around all day and just refried.  They were good.  The fish was huge and also very scrumptious.  It really did hit the spot however I could not finish this meal because it was gigantic.  My fiance had the same reaction: he loved his food but the portion was just too big for one person to eat.

Overall, great atmosphere if you are looking for casual dining.  Although the food is delicious, be prepared for a large portion meal."}
{"text":"I have driven past this restaurant many times and finally decided to check it out for Sunday brunch. I loved the ambiance of the restaurant -- a good mixture of warmth and informality. The exposed brick and ceiling beams are a nice touch. In terms of service, our experience was quite pleasant. Our server was attentive and friendly. I ordered a vegetarian omelet while my buddy ordered an eggs benny with smoke salmon. The quality of the food was okay. The highlight for me was the creamy goat cheese that's inside my omelet. However, my buddy, who usually is quite easy-going when it comes to food, complained about his food being lukewarm. That said, our server was happy to return the food back to the kitchen and have it warmed up. Overall, our first encounter with Cherry Street Restaurant left us with mixed feelings -- while we enjoyed the charm of the dining space as well as the low-key environment, we were not exactly blown away by the quality of the food."}
{"text":"We stopped here before heading across the street to Cirque du Soleil.

We were seated promptly, served straight away, and the food was quick. The beers were cold and tasty. 

My only complaint is the meal selection. I ended up with a BLT, which I love, but I could easily make at home. Nothing else much appealed to me. My bf had a pulled pork sandwich, which again seems more like a lunch menu item than dinner fare.

It was tasty, but out of the way. I think brunch may be the way to go."}
{"text":"Really nice people. Very reasonable prices. Only open mornings on the weekends to 3pm I believe but definitely worth it.

This is across the T and T on Cherry St. It is hard to access by TTC but if you drive they have about 5 free parking spots behind the building. 

Ambiance inside is classy. Exposed brick, wood joists, wooden tables, old school pictures. I love taking my girlfriend here. One of my favourite breakfast places!"}
{"text":"Last week was the first time I visited this restaurant for takeout. The restaurant looked nice, it also looked busy. I ordered fish and chips and got my order in about 10 minutes. Not bad considering I saw that there was only 3 ladies operating this place. But I knew for next time to call ahead. 
Side note: The server did not seem to know how to pack takeout out, the sauce containers were all over the place on the bottom of the bag with the box sitting on top - one was malt vinegar and I worried about it leaking.

Got back to the office, opened the fish and chips, looked good, but everything looked greasy, probably because they tried to rush this order out from the deep fryer to the box. I got 2 pieces of fish and a bed a fries. Not my favourite fish and chips but typically what one would get in a restaurant.

Had lunch again this week and it was a bit of a disaster this time around. I called in my order and was told that it would be 10-15 minutes. I got there 15 minutes later. The server apologized that it would take a little longer. I was there for about another 10 minutes. She offered me a free drink of my choice, I got a soda. Finally, my order was ready and I was happy to go. 
Side note: There was only one table occupied .

Got back to the office, opened my big breakfast to find that many items were missing that were detailed in the description. I did not see any french toast and beans, and I was missing an egg. I can only assume that the kitchen staff doesn't have their menu memorized and that the server doesn't check the boxes before closing them. I called them back immediately but got their voicemail instead. 

I'm still waiting to see what will come out of this. *sighs

***

ETA:

I received a call back the day after and spoke with the GM, Robert, who offered me a complimentary meal to make up for their mistakes. I love good customer service. :)

I went back for my free lunch today and I have to say I'm a lot happier with this restaurant and I'm glad they actually care about their customers. I understand people make mistakes and I'm glad they corrected it. :) *thumbs up* I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The review is strictly for their Thursday Night Jazz events as this is the only time I go to this resto and can't really imagine when else would I end up on Cherry Street in search of a dinner.

The place is quite charming and even cozy and warm once all the guests have arrived around 8pm and the front door had been shut, up until then expect to feel like you're outside. I suggest reserving a table especially if you go with a date since every time it's a full house and there isn't much rotation throughout the night. 

Bands that play are amazingly enjoyable and if you, like I, derive pleasure from consuming dinner to a fine saxophone tune then Cherry Street Restaurant is the place to be. I won't say the dinner is exceptional but it isn't bad either, nice selection of salads and mains, the steak we ordered was quite alright. I suggest ordering a bottle of wine and stretching the evening consuming it. Cheers!"}
{"text":"the food is bad, the service is even worse! They have a very limited and confusing menu. There were 3 vegetarians in the group I went with, and they couldn't order anything on the menu except for the side dishes (eggs, toast, potato). The server wouldn't even let them order those side items without ordering a main entree, although we managed to persuade after. When the food came, my vegetarian friends found bacons in their plates, they cooked the bacon and potato together! My friends got very upset and walked away. That was probably the worst breakfast experience I ever had."}
{"text":"Was at this restaurant for breakfast many times off and on. First few times it was great and than the breakfast was terrible. Took time off the restaurant and eat at other places then went back to Cherry Street and wow it got good again. When the third time and got bad again.

Waitress can be snotty and stale. When you ask her for certain things she will argue that you never told her. The eggs are good but the multi grain bread slices have gotten very thin and sometimes the food is served cold.

Will be giving this place a break since they have absolutely no consistency including the waitress's attitude."}
