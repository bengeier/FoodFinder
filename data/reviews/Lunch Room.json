{"text":"Ordered from this place and they took 40 minutes past the later time given in the estimate. That is just unacceptable. They didn't even apologize when I called them to ask if my order was coming."}
{"text":"I have ordered from this place probably 20+ times at this point off of the eatstreet app! I usually order the same thing (pastrami sauerkraut on marble rye + potato salad) but I have also changed it up from time to time. Everything I have ever ordered exceeds my expectations! The prices are super low, the delivery is always prompt and friendly, and I have never had a poor experience. This is my go to lunch place if I don't have time to pack a lunch or forgot something at home.   Yay lunch room! :)"}
{"text":"Really excellent seafood sandwiches. Clean friendly and don't forget to ask for a pickle!"}
{"text":"That time you order a fruit salad and you get Dole canned fruit cup. Seriously?"}
{"text":"This is the best hidden lunch spot! Everything is always so fresh and exactly how I ask for it. You almost feel like you went to your parents for a home cooked lunch."}
{"text":"Wow, what a jewel in the desert!  Recently ordered egg salad on marble-great, tasty, fresh.  Came back & tried chicken salad sand on marble.  Fresh bread & ingredients again.  Price is very right & owner takes pride in providing nutritious, tasty lunch.  I am hooked! Best to order online or phone----seriously!"}
{"text":"I ordered a garden salad with a fruit cup.  We also had a ham, turkey, bacon, and Swiss cheese on marbled rye with macaroni salad.  It was delivered fast and fresh.  Will order from them again.  They only had a $10 minimum and no delivery fee."}
{"text":"Best sandwiches in Scottsdale. The egg salad sandwich is killer but I change it up occasionally. Fresh and tasty! Reasonable prices too.  The space is a little cramped so I usually take mine to go."}
{"text":"I really like this place. The free delivery is pretty awesome and I think the food is nice and fresh. I really like the people as well. They are friendly and very accomadating. They deliver to my office in a timely matter and they have met all my expectations. Reasonable pricing and yummy food!!"}
{"text":"I've seen Lunch Room pop up in my Yelp search results for a few years now but never tried it. Sandwiches are pretty much my favorite foods, so I'm always like, \"Yelp, where's the good sandwiches at.\" These guys would pop up with no/very few reviews so I never made it around to visit...until today!  Today I was in one of those, \"I'm not sure if it's breakfast time or lunch time,\" moods, so I got an egg salad sandwich lunch combo on marble rye. Their egg salad is made with regular mayo (not Miracle Whip, I checked), the marble rye is thick sliced and fluffy, soft and delicious, and then it also comes with lettuce, tomato, and mayo if you want. It's a yummy, traditional egg salad!  The prices are very fair at around $6 for a sandwich and $7 for a combo. The next time I go, I'm going to try a macaroni or potato salad side instead of chips and a pickle (not that they were bad, just normal store bought stuff). The places is really set up for delivery or carry out as their slogan is \"You Ring...We Bring!\" but they do have 3 or 4 small tables set up so I don't think they'll get too mad at you if you want to eat there.   These guys do cater so you can have sandwiches delivered to your lunch meeting and get your business on without leaving the office."}
{"text":"The owners are great and frequently deliver the sandwiches themselves!  Great Sandwiches that taste like home, not a chain sandwich shop!  Good portioned salads and sandwiches, I regularly order and will continue to!"}
{"text":"Discovered this place delightfully by accident. My first order was a an egg salad sandwich and it was wonderful, just the right amount of mayo and seasonings and definitely homemade. The macaroni salad was ok but nothing to write home about.   My second order (today) was a hot roast beef sandwich with bbq sauce and potato salad. The salad was yummy and really good! just the right amount of mayo and not too mustard-y. The sandwich was REALLY DELICIOUS and the roll they used was nice and soft.  I chose to pick up my order this time and had a bit of an issue finding it as they are really tucked away in the airpark and not super visible from the road. Their place is really only for pick ups or delivery but I was super impressed with how clean it was. When you walk in, you see a pick up window to the left and a view into the kitchen and everything seemed really organized and tidy.   The staff here is very friendly and the food and prices are excellent. A nice change from the blahs of fast food or chain restaurants in the airpark :)"}
{"text":"Delicious, fast, and friendly. I walk down the street from my office at least a couple of times a month for a BLT and potato salad."}
{"text":"This establishment has changed ownership and sad to say not quite as good. The egg salad sandwich I had no complaints with but my co-workers have not as happy with their lunches the last few times. This time the chicken noodle soup was lukewarm and had hardly any chicken in it and there was a lot less tuna in the tuna salad sandwich as well. I had to downgrade my rating to just \"ok.\""}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing food and service!  The owners are the most delightful couple, and it really makes you want to come back just to interact with them.  Food is always fresh and tasty!  Would recommend it to anyone!"}
{"text":"Ordered from this place for the first time after discovering them on GrubHub and being completely famished. Pregnancy cravings demanded that I find a place that offered meatball subs. Finances dictated that it be cheap and preferably free delivery.  GrubHub delivered with lightening speed and extra pickles 10 minutes BEFORE the earliest point in the expected delivery bracket.   Love their whole wheat hoagie choice as well!!!!!!   5 stars blazing!"}
{"text":"Called at 1045 to place an order for lunch to feed my movers. I wanted six sandwiches. I assumed a sandwich shop would be able to handle such an order. Was told they \" didn't have time to make my order\". Since I just moved into the neighborhood they could of made a loyal customer, instead I will never go there and I hope you don't either."}
{"text":"Very friendly couple who owns the business! Delicious sandwiches! All fresh ingredients and very fair prices. Will be coming here again!"}
{"text":"I ordered online today for the first time and I gotta say, not the best but really not bad.  The ordering was quick and easy - and basic -don't expect this to be a fancy lunch or anything. The prices are right and the delivery is quick and extremely friendly.   I ordered the half sandwich with a large soup, pickles on the side and 2 cookies. For $10 I got what I wanted for lunch and it was pretty good. The soup today was chicken noodle and it wasn't the best I have had but I am REALLY spoiled by boyfriends mom's soup so most places can't impress me. The sandwich was actually really big for a half. I can be picky about how people put my sandwiches together but they did a good job - enough meat cheese and mayo for my liking.  Overall, I would order from here again just because of how nice they are and how cheap they are."}
{"text":"The worst customer service I have experienced. It took an hour and 40 minutes for delivery. We received an email saying the order couldn't be confirmed through Eat24 when I ordered at 11:15 and the email came at 11:55. The order was cancelled (email confirmation) and they reinstated the order on their on to be delivered after 1:15. We have a small window from 12-12:30.   Amelia, the owner, refused to refund my money even though we were UNABLE TO EAT. She said there is no expectation for time even though we were given a 45-60 minute window. I would never order from there again."}
{"text":"Stranded at the office with NO vehicle, not enough time to make lunch @ home and nothing within walking distance. Delivery to the rescue! My old standby is sadly closed and soon to be sold.   Now that I've ordered/eaten from this place, I'm pretty sure my husband used to rave about them.  Online ordering through a third party website is super simple. The delivery showed up just as I was thinking \"Gee, I wonder where my food is??\"  They seem to have a nice selection of both cold and warm sandwiches. I ordered the Italian. The bread is pillowy soft and fresh and fresh can get. They obliged my \"not too much mayo\" request perfectly. All meat and veggies are very super awesome tasty fresh - and they use leafy green leaf lettuce, not iceberg (yeah!!!).   High quality, fresh, tasty food at a great price - and delivery! I'll definitely be ordering again."}
