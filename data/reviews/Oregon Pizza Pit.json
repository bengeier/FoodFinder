{"text":"Had 5 pizza deliverd for a birthday party Saturday. All were good and the veggy was a hit. Came on time, price was good, gave the driver $15 tip. We will order from here again..."}
{"text":"Love pizza pit pizza. ..always been my favorite ordering to the house. We stopped by for Athens Gyros since we saw the neon sign. They were ok but seemed over priced.  The tatziki (sp?) Sauce seemed too thick and was on the side rather than on the sandwich. The meat seemed dry and there were not enough tomatoes. 

The size of the gyro was small and was typically something I would expect to pay 7 dollars for rather than 11. (With fries and drink). 

Sad to say ... no more gyros for me...just staying with pizza."}
{"text":"Actually my most positive pizza experiencing in Oregon to date. I have ordered from Pizza Pit Oregon probably three or four times in the last six months; maybe I should cut back. They deliver in an okay time frame, but given the free pizza coupons I have received (Oregon is great), I tend to pick up to avoid minimal fees for delivery and tip. Their actual delivery fee is so minimal and their website is great. The shop has a dine-in area if you feel compelled. Every pizza box I seem to have gotten has a menu and coupons; being an avid menu reader, this provides me with seven minutes of happiness. These guys are incredibly nice and remind me of the days of I used to work in a pizza shop similar to this setting; don't give them a hard time. They don't mind 1/2 and 1/2 pizza orders like so many specialty pizza shops seem to be hung up about. The best part? Gyros."}
{"text":"Ordered a pizza with no cheese as one of our guests cannot eat dairy. The pizza came with cheese so I called and requested a new one. When the new one arrived, the driver tried to charge us. When explaining the problem, he said \"ma'am I'm just the driver. The receipt says I'm supposed to charge you.\" When he had problems over the phone with the store I offered to call to try to speak with the girl I originally spoke with and he said I would just slow the process down (even more). Terrible customer service. The other pizza was not made correctly either. Pizza Hut is the only way to go. I had been a pizza pit fan from the get go until now :("}
