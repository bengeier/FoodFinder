{"text":"Same filth as it was when it was 'My Donair'.  The parking is horrible in the inside is cluttered and dirty - food is only so so , no real incentive to go there.  Stay healthy and eat somewhere hygienic.  Staff is not the friendliest either"}
{"text":"My wife ordered the mixed platter (chicken and donair meat) and I had the donair platter.  The portions are huge and the food is delicious.  Have been here twice now."}
{"text":"So it seems that the owners of My Donair have done a little re-brand. They've painted, put in some new tables and chairs, new menu boards along with a new menu, new name and signage, and a few other small upgrades.  The phone number is still the same. The decals on the windows are still the same. Your POS receipt still says \"My Donair\" The donairs are still the same, only with medium and large for sizes.  The new menu now has a broader range of Middle Eastern food consisting of plates, platters, wraps, and salads. They also kept the pizza.  I went in for my usual donair and it was pretty much the same experience as before. Good food at a good price."}
