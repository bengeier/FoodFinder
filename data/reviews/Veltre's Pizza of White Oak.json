{"text":"Love this place, have been eating there since i was a kid. Hands down the best steak hoagies around! the cheese balls and pizza are also a favorite of mine. the rest of the menu is also very delicious. i recommend veltres to anyone looking for good dinning, and excellent food."}
{"text":"I've eaten pizza from this location, and their Wilkins Twp location. Both were great. Had delivery service once and picked up in-shop once. Service was excellent for both. Friendly staff. Pizza was better than others in the area. Perfect ratio of crust to pie. I will definitely go back. I've only had their pizza, so can't comment on other food. White Oak location has a diner feel if you eat in. Place your order before sitting down.  My only criticism is of their website. The actual prices were higher than listed on website. I didn't bother asking for an adjustment, but I'm guessing they would have done so. There are always coupons in local papers and online so check them out, I did. If they fix their website they'll get 5 stars."}
{"text":"The best pizza  and hoagies around. Worth the trip - staff is friendly and accommodating. Try a sausage and pepperoni pizza , my favorite - my family loves the wedding soup and white pizza.  The antipasti was delicious - a great place for the entire family."}
{"text":"LOVE this place. Never had a bad meal or experience. Friendly service and speedy delivery."}
{"text":"I have been a loyal customer for 30 years and love the new, expanded restaurant. The food has been consistently delicious especially when you begin your meal with the best Wedding Soup.  Check out the daily specials."}
{"text":"Veltres is not your average pizza shop.  I have never ordered anything I did not love.  Their white pizza is the best around and the tuna croissants are fabulous.  The owner, Vince, is super friendly and runs a great business."}
{"text":"My family has always gone here for pizza and sandwiches.  It is a great local pizza shop where you can always find something you love, either and the specials for the day or the regular menu.  The owners are fun and give you a welcoming feel when you walk in.  Would definitely recommend to others!"}
{"text":"We have always enjoyed  food from Veltre's until last week. The pepperoni and mushroom pizza we ordered for pick up was a real disappointment. It was overcooked with burnt crust . There was way too much sauce making it wet and soggy. We had to eat it with a fork because it fell apart when we  tried to pick it up to eat it. The pepperoni tasted like cardboard, probably because it was burnt like the crust.  We ended up throwing out 8 of the twelve slices."}
{"text":"We've only had their pizza but it is so good. Crust is thin with a little chew and the pepperoni gives it the right touch of grease.  Never ate at their place but delivery is always within their estimated time."}
{"text":"I've been going to Veltries maybe since the day they opened. The pizza is great, the hoagies too, I can honestly say I've never been disappointed with anything I've ever had. Now if they only sold Coca-Cola! Just had my first pizza from the other notable pizza place in White Oak, and I'll stick to Veltries. And delivery to me is always very quick and the drivers very good. Thanks for 30 great years!"}
{"text":"Damn good food, damn cheap. Great hoagies, house made wedding soup, pizza. Ask for an italian dog while you wait, they are amazing!"}
{"text":"You better have deep pockets to eat there a large 1 topping is $17 or more much rather eat a more affordable pizza place since there are so many in the area"}
{"text":"This is pretty good pizza. Good enough that I find it far superior to any of the other local pizza spots and that would certainly include Vincent's Pizza Park."}
{"text":"This is my in-law's spot for pizza since they live nearby, and I make a point of getting some every time we are up north. It's so worth it. Last time we ordered this monstrous pizza - I mean we could barely get the box into the car - and paid only ten bucks or so. Maybe this is normal in Pittsburgh, but living in Georgia for the last few years it's an awesome deal, and tastes worlds better than what we've got back home. I crave Veltre's from afar. My favorite pizza in the world. There, I said it.   The crust"}
{"text":"This is what I consider a BASIC pizza. Nothing special what so ever about this pizza.  I wouldn't recommend.  I got vegetables on my pizza, peppers and onions. $3 EXTRA per topping. So, for the 2 toppings it was $6 EXTRA. I would be ok with that but the amount of toppings they give you is a joke.  All I tasted was the cheese. Do not waste your money on toppings they cheat you out on them.  They were so thin my whole family asked \" is this a joke?\""}
{"text":"This place is boring.  They use below par ingredients, and serve up flavorless fare.  This is yet another one of your suburban pizza and sandwich shops.  White Oak has about 5 too many of these, and Veltre's is one of the worst.    Worst antipasti I've ever seen, the whole menu lacks healthy choices & is defiantly geared toward the blue collar crowd.    My meatball sub was bland, overlooked and had about a tablespoonful of sauce on the whole thing.   The staff is unfriendly and weird, and the food quality is hit or miss on any given night.  On the up side, you won't be wasting much money, because they keep the prices pretty low."}
{"text":"one of the best in my area.   their hoagies are great there pizza is good and their fried food is the best.  its a little pricey but you get what you pay for"}
{"text":"The calzones are HUGE and topped with ingredients. Its like a full pizza just folded in half and baked. You def get your bang for the buck."}
{"text":"They have the best spinach and tomato pizza around. The pizza is done in an oven not a conveyor like most places. In my opinion makes for a better crust."}
{"text":"I LOVE Veltre's! The pizza is always so good and we can't go there without getting some Italian dogs to take home. Never had a bad meal and I highly recommend them!"}
{"text":"Hey man, I have to say that this pizza is about what you'd expect. It's not a bad quality or price it's something I don't crave but they do a good job for being a neighborhood restaurant."}
