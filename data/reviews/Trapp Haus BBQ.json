{"text":"I've never been a fan of BBQ until eating here. The philly crack wings are the only wings I've had where the meat falls off the bone but they're still crispy. And the only wings I've had that I didn't want ranch with. All the meats are slow smoked, seasoned and marinated in house made rubs and sauces, giving each meat it's own unique and delicious taste. The Mac was perfectly creamy without an overwhelming smoke flavor. The slaw was perfectly crunchy and not at all soggy. Both complimented the meats in their own perfect way. The homemade pickles and cornbread just topped it all off. 
The service is as fast as fast-food but the quality of the food is not at all sacrificed in the speed. The atmosphere is fun with good music, sports, and drinks but still cozy and comfortable enough to bring the entire family. The staff has always been great, super friendly, and more than accommodating.  
Overall an amazing addition to Phoenix and a great new place to check out! Very satisfied!"}
{"text":"My family was in town and we were looking on yelp for a good place to eat. Came across this restaurant and thought we would check it out. When we walked in there wasn't much seating and the patio section was pretty small (it would make it so much better if the outside area was bigger) but needless to say the food was very delicious although I really wanted to try Ribs and they were out of it! The pulled brisket was really good."}
{"text":"Ordered two meat platter, hot link(sausage)& brisket with two sides, honey jalapeno coleslaw & mac and cheese. The meats were good but the hot link was outstanding, sides were also good, but coleslaw was great, while mac and cheese was just okay. Place was very tight, but to be fair it was lunch time. Service was good, everyone was personable. The only complaint I may have is price to portion... A hot link and brisket (2 slices) and sides with bottle of soda $20....a little pricey, maybe it's just me. Will come back but not a lot,especially driving from Goodyear."}
{"text":"Man this sure is Trapp House you can't leave without having the wings, the empanadas oh daaaaaaaaaang amazing!!!! Plus they give you this special sauce (make you want to slap your mama) make sure you get plater!!"}
{"text":"We had high expectations for the food.  Two of the four of us really liked our meat, but the \"lean\" brisket was very fatty and the brisket wasn't smokey.   Although we were there before noon, they were out of potato salad, and there were no crispy onions for the pork heaven sandwich.  After waiting in line for almost 20 minutes, it took another 50 minutes before our meals came, and we had to ask twice for our sides.  Sadly, I doubt we will go back."}
{"text":"Today was my 1st visit to this location and I'm impressed with the food despite some bad reviews. I ordered the chicken sandwich which is not on the menu and the \"to die for\" waffle fries. Chicken was moist and juicy and the fries were hot and crispy. Customer service was good and I observed  the cook wash his hands and then put his gloves on. For me that was a huge plus!! Now to the 3 star review...the parking is very limited and if you don't get there right when they open you won't find a spot. Another thing is they do not have lunch specials!  Having a location in downtown Phoenix the majority of their business would be coming for lunch so it would make sense to offer specials. I paid $11 for a chicken sandwich and chips. Does not come with a side so add another $3 if you choose a side. I'm not sure about you but $14 for lunch is insane! I want to support the business however I don't wanna  file bankruptcy in the process!"}
{"text":"I really wanted this place to be good, we need more good bbq in Phoenix, unfortunately this just isn't it.  For starters, the price and the portions just don't line up. The brisket was tender but flavorless and the light drizzle of sauce wasn't doing it any favors. The pulled pork was similarly without flavor. The cornbread was dry. The mac and cheese was below average.  The staff was very friendly though."}
{"text":"This place popped up on my places to try.  We decided to stop by and give it a go and we were not disappointed at all.  

There was three of us and we decided to order three platters.  We ordered a brisket, pulled pork and ribs.  The brisket is some of the best I have ever had.  The ribs and pulled pork was really good too.  
The side of beans and waffle fries were good.  They do not have a soda fountain or ice machine too.  I do not drink soda so that does not bother me.  I just had water.  They sell bottled soda and beer too. We sat outside in the back of the place.  The young lady that took our order was really nice and friendly.  The owner of the establishment was there too and was awesome to chat with when leaving.  

I recommend this place and think it is worth a try.  Just remember all BBQ can be different place to place.  My experience is that each style has a unique or signature trick to make it their own.  

The owner of Trapp Haus BBQ does a little of everything with the meats to give a unique experience.  He was telling us about the wings too.  I guess he smokes them and then gives them a flash fry and seasons them.  

Stop by and give it a try."}
{"text":"Make this locally owned eatery a destination the next time you want to enjoy delicious BBQ in the company of engaging and friendly staff.  This is a new location but the owner is well known for his Food Truck operation.  I had the Brisket Platter that was tender and delicious.  For my Sides, I had smoked Mac and Cheese and Honey Jalapeño Cole Slaw.  My Wife loved the pulled pork sandwich.

Trap Haus is in a newly repurposed building and the inside has the vibe of a comfy, thoroughly urban destination.  Note that 'urban' also means that if they're as successful as I think they'll be, the dining space will fill up fast (we were there at 4 on a Thursday afternoon, so I can't speak to busy times)."}
{"text":"We are on vacation from Chicago and have been to Trapp Haus twice.   There are BBQ places in Chicago and suburbs that we've enjoyed, but nothing compares to Trapp Haus.  Every single bite is delicious.  All of the the sides and corn muffin are from scratch and it reflects in how amazing they taste.   The staff is extremely friendly and helpful, and the restaurant is spotless.  Also, try a parfait for dessert or take it home for later."}
{"text":"AMAZING!! My husband was craving wings so walked into this new place and we did not regret it. We had brisket, beans, wings, bread and waffle fries. We will definitely stop by when we're in the neighborhood. 

PS. Music is on point"}
{"text":"Meats were good. Grits and shrimp was good. Greens were absolutely inedible-so much vinegar I could only take two bites. 
When you just have a few things on the menu you gotta get it right every time-especially for the price.  This is a shame."}
{"text":"For the love of god and all that is holy..when you just open a new business it takes all of five minutes of training your staff to ask \"have you been here before?\" engage in the customers...I will never understand how in the food industry managers/staff of a new place don't try and woe people IN YOUR PLACE of business!! Overall service was just horrible. not a smile to be found...srsly, nobody seemed to want to be working. 

I know everyone is all up in arms over this place..but the food was honestly Meh as best. It is not living up to the hype, (granted there was a LOT of hype) and maybe it was never going to reach any lofty heights..but damn..maybe at least meet me half way? 

I ordered the brisket sammy, meat was warm at best; lacked any foundations of flavoring and gotta be honest..just didn't impress. 

I will go back, one because it's local and i want to support and two maybe i caught them on an off day...."}
{"text":"This place was good when it first opened. I was like \"hey, finally a decent bbq joint that is close\". Like most of these quick open restaraunts showing up all over Phoenix, the quality has diminished severely. I just got a platter of pulled pork and 3/4th of it was inedible fat. Now don't get me wrong I like my gristle and a little fat but this was gross."}
{"text":"Great bbq!!! The staff is so friendly too !!! We had a 2 meat combo with ribs and pulled pork, the Mac bowl, and waffle fries. we will be back!"}
{"text":"I am glad that a BBQ restaurant finally opened in Downtown Phoenix! This place is quaint and has very limited seating so don't expect to sit and eat if there is a crowd. I absolutely LOVE the condensed menu items however, on the day that I visited, (4 days after their opening), I wanted the rib tips but I was informed that \"they had not been delivered yet\". I was disappointed but ordered the Mac n' Cheese rolls with brisket (wrapped up in won ton wraps then deep fried). They were very, very good. I also had the \"Phil 'Em Up Fries\". They were covered with BBQ brisket, cilantro, sour cream and cheese.....I swear they were like Heaven in a basket!!!!

As my co-worker and I ate, the owner's father \"Ribs\" came around, checking on those of us who were lucky enough to be seated. He is a very personable man, very talkative and really tuned in to how we were enjoying the food and atmosphere. He made sure that we were satisfied, and his personality and conversation made the experience even more enjoyable.

I cannot really think of anything that they could possible do at this point to improve, except for the seating but I am sure that will come with time. The food will MORE than make up for the seating! My co-worker and I work in the City Hall building which is about a good 2 miles round trip and we walked there. They did not disappoint at all. 

Welcome to the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"I have officially found the 2nd best brisket in town.  Scott Holmes' Little Miss BBQ may be the barbecue unicorn in the valley, but Phil Johnson's new Trapp Haus BBQ has come out of the gate a very impressive contender.  As my numerous barbecue restaurant reviews around the valley will confirm, I don't say this lightly.  Most valley pit masters fancy themselves an expert on making this tough cut of meat moist and delicious, but most joints around town don't have the product or the skill to extract brisket's maximum flavor profile.  Scott Holmes has proven he's got what it takes, and if my first visit to Phil's place is any indication, it appears valley barbecue fans have another bonafide option for their brisket fix.

Trapp Haus BBQ is the new brick and mortar barbecue restaurant run by Phil Johnson (aka Phil The Grill), a NY transplant who previously ran a Phil The Grill food truck.  After success and notoriety allowed him to take a chance on a permanent location, he took over this newly renovated space at the old Flowers building (now known as The Blocks) on the southeast corner of 5th Street & Roosevelt.  Here you order up front and grab a seat (or stand) at either the front bar, elevated seating around the corner, or one of the tables in the small patio out back.  Altogether they've got seating for maybe 40 total and you'll certainly notice the beautiful murals throughout the interior.

As it turns out, Phil and Scott are friends from the competition circuit and as such have competed in many of the same categories.  So for my first go around I decided to get their Two Meat Platter with two sides.  My two meats of choice this time were brisket (of course) and pulled pork.  I got their pit baked beans and mac & cheese as my sides.  The order also comes with onions, spicy pickles, and a cornbread muffin.  The gal at the register also mentioned Phil's chicken wings being his big claim to fame.  You can get them sauced (with their house barbecue sauce) or naked (in which case you get them with a spicy seasoning rub).  I got them rubbed, but asked for extra sauce on the side to get the best of both worlds.  Also just FYI, they honor the Yelp 20% check in discount when you order up front.  Total cost for my meal including the Yelp discount and tax came to $23.

Let's first talk about those wings.  Full disclaimer, I'm not a chicken wing guy.  I just find them a lot of work for just a small amount of meat.  Phil's wings are no different, but I gotta give him props for the rub.  Its a spicy blend of seasonings (definitely picked up a bunch of the cayenne), but it pairs well with the juiciness of the meat.  Their house barbecue sauce is a sweet sauce with a kick and when added to the wings, elevates the flavor profile that much further.  My advice would be to get the wings sauced, or do like I did and get the sauce on the side and apply as much or as little as you want.  As chicken wings go, Phil's are a tasty creation.

Now for the main event.  Both the brisket and pulled pork come with the house barbecue sauce already applied (I neglected to ask, but they will absolutely serve the sauce on the side if you want).  First bite of pulled pork was solid.  Didn't have an especially smokey profile, but the meat was nevertheless perfectly slow cooked, moist and tender.  Now the moment of the truth.  The brisket.  I was prepared for disappointment.  After two bites, I was still waiting for disappointment to show up, but to no avail.  The meat is outstanding.  Fatty, juicy, pulls apart easily, melts in your mouth.  It's basically impossible to equal the etherial experience of a fatty piece of brisket from Little Miss BBQ, but Phil's brisket came astonishingly close.  I'm not sure if Phil is using the expensive meat that Scott uses or if he's just perfected his technique, but the brisket gets a big thumbs up from me.  As for the sides, the pit beans were delicious with a little extra spice from what looks like chunks of their house sausage links in there.  And the mac and cheese was super rich, creamy and cheesy.  Just how I like it.  Heck even the cornbread muffin was respectable.

I'm overjoyed that Downtown Phoenix's first true barbecue joint is worthy of such praise.  Great location, great vibes, nice staff, and (most importantly) great quality barbecue.  I came in with no expectations whatsoever and left gleeful, sticky fingers and all.  The staff also let me know that they have a Sunday soul food brunch every week which includes Phil's shrimp and grits (something I strongly suspect will be worth checking out).  Welcome to the neighborhood, Trapp Haus.  Keep on perfecting that brisket of yours."}
{"text":"Great place and great flavor, great location to stop and grab a bite, I order Philly cheese something (have a different name) was great, chips amazing and Philly good. Great place."}
{"text":"Ok so I have been down in BBQ lately. Something about it really turned me off but it's my husband's favorite thing to eat. He really wanted to try it but before I said ues, I had to look at the menu online to see the least BBQ thing lol...I decided that I would try the Phil em up Fries with brisket.  OMG!!! I tore it up. It was sooooo so good!!  I also ordered the Mac and cheese and greens to take home...tasted them...OMG SOOOOO GOOD!! My husband had the ribs and the wigs and well he absolutely loved it. They have a DJ in here not loud, very nice atmosphere. We WILL be back!!"}
{"text":"Best BBQ I've had in Arizona. The Mac and cheese bowl with brisket is highly recommended! The pulled pork also amazing. Love having this place in the neighborhood. It's new so we haven't tried everything yet but plan on it!"}
{"text":"Stoped in for lunch Sunday afternoon.   Had the Two meat combo platter, brisket and pulled pork.  The side we had were the beans, mac n cheese.   Everything was good and moist, and the service was very fast.   Only problem I did see is how can you run Barbecue place without sweet tea?,"}
{"text":"Was excited to have a BBQ restaurant in downtown Phoenix, and was also excited to see what Phil the Grill could do in a brick and mortar joint.  I had eaten at his old trailer a couple times, and the food there was decent, but not great.  

Obviously the new restaurant is still coming together, with some final painting still going on and I'm sure there are kinks to get worked out, so it won't be my last time visiting, but I will give them a few months to get good at running the place. 

I ordered the 2 meat sampler with brisket and pulled pork, along with the waffle fries and jalapeno grits.  The waffle fries were the best part (as they were at all my visits to his trailer), and the grits were decent, but didn't really have as much jalapeno or chese flavor as I would generally expect.  The meat is where I was very underwhelmed...

The brisket was cooked well, but was definitely not trimmed properly.  Each slice was about an inch thick, with about 1/2 inch of greasy fat cap on it.  I love fatty brisket in general (and tend to ask for it), but this was just way too much.  The seasoning used was overly sweet for a brisket, and lacked the smoky flavor I would expect. The smoke was there, but was only a faint hickory taste.   Maybe the hickory contributed to the sweetness, because generally the better tasting briskets (in my mind) use mesquite, oak, and/or pecan.  Overall I would try something completely different before trying the brisket again.

The pulled pork was also extremely fatty, to the point where 20% was just an inedible chunk of fatty skin.  Again, it was also somewhat greasy, but generally tasted better than the brisket.  I think the sweet works better with the pork than it does the brisket.  

My top in Phoenix is still Little Miss. And I realize that everyone has their own style.  If you are going to charge Little Miss prices for your brisket, you better have a somewhat comparable product quality wise (taking individual style out).  As it stands now, this place doesn't even crack my Top 5 in Phoenix.   Work on the quality control, and I'll see you in a few months to hopefully update with a better review. 

Also, it's kind of tacky to have your cashier using her vape pen at the register.  I realize it was pretty empty in the place, but pretty sure that isn't allowed by AZ law..."}
{"text":"A great glunten free option downtown! The Phat Bowl is a great blend of all things bbq minus a bun. The dry rub wings are really  good and flavorful."}
{"text":"Three of us drove over to Roosevelt Row to try out Pitmaster Phil Johnson's new BBQ joint. It's a wonderful, tiny space with about ten table tops (including the outside area.) The menu is beautifully simple. We tried a variety of items. Best of the bunch: Mac N Cheese rolls. But my sammich was excellent and the fries are delicious. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Had lunch there today. Amazing pulled pork and their wings, beans and smoked Mac-n-cheese was all great. Friendly service and reasonably priced. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"We stopped in last week to check out the new BBQ restaurant in the Valley.  The staff was so welcoming and appreciative of the business. 
I enjoyed the mac bowl with pulled pork - super rich, but very tasty.  They had already sold out of the brisket, so I am sure it is super tasty too - next time!"}
{"text":"First time and was recommending the brisket. It's really good! The girl working the front is super friendly too! Would totally come back again!

Only 4 stars because the brisket had a lot of fat and didn't seem to be really a half pound"}
{"text":"Great BBQ!  I had the Mac and cheese bowl with brisket on top!  Very tasty!!  Staff was very fun!  Need to stay open later but otherwise worth the trip!"}
{"text":"Brisket was delicious, piled pork was just okay. Wings with dry rub were delicious, mild spice. Mean greens were good but beware they've got a kick to them. It would be awesome if they had more bbq sauce options. I would consider this spot cool for something quick or lunch time."}
{"text":"GREAT LOCAL BUSINESS THAT DESERVES AT LEAST A TRY!! Management was super friendly.. staff was great!!  A pretty good take on what barbecue should be and could be... if you like jalapeños this is a good one to try... I love the Mac and cheese egg rolls!!  JALAPEÑOS IN THE CORNBREAD TOO!!"}
{"text":"I just have to start with how wonderful the people here are. We put in an order to go and sat at the bar, and the waitress/bartender gave us some background on the restaurant and their many accomplishments in bbq. She gave us plenty of guidance through the menu, and the chef was even able to chime in, too! 

Food came out quickly, and they made sure that our order was perfect. Chef was able to modify hubby's order to preference easily, and we left feeling so good about having such a pleasant interaction with them.

The food traveled well home. 

-We got the waffle fries, 10/10 delicious!
-Brisket: sorta dry and stringy but loved having a side of sauce with it. I couldn't finish my portion with how dry it was
-Pulled pork was very good with awesome color
-Wings were good with sauce but I'd like to try them dry
-Rib tips were SO good
-Slaw is crispy and fresh, but if you like creamy slaw, this won't be for you
-Babe got the philly sammich and it was absolutely delish; he subbed the cheese sauce for shredded cheddar and Asiago 

I really want to try the hot link still and I'd also like to try the ribs plate."}
{"text":"I highly recommend the Philly Sammitch.  The brisket was so tender and rocked my world.  GrubHub was super fast too.  Do.  It."}
{"text":"Had brunch there with a friend last Sunday a bit after they opened.  They must've known I was coming, they had some Aaliyah playing right after we arrived.  Good start!  We ate out side because it was a nice day.  I ordered the brisket w/ cole slaw and fries.  The fries were light and crunchy, the brisket was tender with good sauce, and the jalapeno cole slaw was pretty decent.  My friend had the hot link and baked beans. She said it was great.  We just request that they add buns for their hot links.  Where I'm from, that's the only way to do a hot link. Buns people!   Most BBQ places around Phoenix have large prices for small portions.  I was pleased with the amount of food I got for what I paid.  Great experience!"}
{"text":"A Championship BBQ Master has just opened his first brick and mortar restaurant in downtown Phoenix. At the time of this review this restaurant is just newly opened and has TONS OF POTENTIAL for serving GREAT DELICIOUS BBQ because flavors were very good! 

To cut a long story short my reason for two stars is that it's not OK under any circumstances to serve Brisket and Grits before they are ready. Nobody wants hard fat or crunchy watery grits.  It's also not ok to serve food not at the correct temperature (most hot food was almost cold). Not a deal breaker but my sandwich was missing the slaw with someone in charge making the sandwich and they didn't bother to tell me they were out of slaw (any problem is ok with communication). We tried to tell someone about the food and she ran away after we told here about the grits.

If you want to hear the longer story here it is.
This is a very small casual BBQ Restaurant. You order at the counter and come back to pick up your food. They have a few banquet tables, a table by the wall with stools and a few outside tables. 

We ordered a N.Y. Style Pastrami Sandwich, a Two Meat Platter with Two Sides. The Pastrami was pretty good and it was tender even though it was almost cold. Not strong with seasoning or smoke but tasty and tender and topped with a sweet sauce with pickles. My sandwich was missing the slaw (not a big deal but it would have been nice if someone told me they were out of slaw) The sandwich came on very thick nicely toasted marble rye. I did think each bite was too much bread so it became harder to taste the meat but maybe the ratio would have been better if the sandwich had the slaw.

I tried a bite of Brisket. The fat wasn't cooked and was hard so I peeled it off. The meat had a good flavor but was hard and chewy like rubber and also almost cold. I think it would have been really great if it was cooked more. My husband said the pork was good but not hot either. He also said the Hot Link was the only thing that was hot and did taste good but it was over cooked and dry inside and not juicy like hot links normally are.

As for the sides. The Waffle Fries were really great but also served almost cold. They were fluffy inside and seasoned tasty....BUT THE GRITS INEDIBLE the grits were Cold and HARD and CRUNCHY in a thin WATERY sauce. It was like trying to eat SAND mixed with Water.

We were pretty much on our own. A lady did walk by and asked us how things were. We got to tell her about the grits and she ran away. 

This restaurant does have potential.....The Owner is a Award Winning Competition BBQ Master. Flavors were good. 

Under cooked of all things Brisket (and hard crunchy Grits), Most food not served at correct temperature is not OK under any circumstances. That means even if a restaurant is brand new. Really this was one star to me but I'm giving two stars because they are new and have potential."}
{"text":"Not bad, but have had much better elsewhere. You do get a lot of meat for the price. The sides we're satisfactory, Mac and cheese was boxed and then infused with smoke. Beans were just that, beans, nothing exciting about them. Place is super small, no room to sit. Although the food was okay, it will not be very likely that we will ever return nor recommend."}
{"text":"Brought my bbq aficionado friend to Trapp Haus and he agreed with me that it was fantastic! Had the Brisket sammich! Nice sweet brown sugar rub."}
{"text":"The ribs I ordered to go. They melted in my mouth. They cooked them perfectly. I was in and out within minutes. Staff was very friendly. I was referred by a co-worker and can't wait to try more on the menu"}

{"text":"Another great addition to the PHX bbq scene. Pulled pork and hot links were great. The beans were outstanding. Brisket was good too. 
Didn't taste the honey or jalapeño in the honey jalapeño coleslaw. 
The sauce was a perfect compliment to the meat."}
{"text":"Boyfriend and I were in the area and saw this place opened recently.  We shared brisket and pulled port and it was heaven. Both extremely tender, and the sauce is the perfect blend of sweet and tangy.  The pickles and jalepenos were delicious. We will be back for sure for round two."}
{"text":"DAAMMNN! Super good food. Loved it, i ordered the \"Boss Hog\" best brisket ever had. Came with coleslaw though...  hate coleslaw.. No sides which sucked but the sandwich being super flame made up for it.  my lady got the a pulled pork sandwich, and she loved it. So overall the food was amazing! Ok now the server was rude to my lady when she went to get ketchup... So for that reason trap haus gets a 4 star instead of 5!!"}
{"text":"Lets start off by saying AMEN and HALLAJUHA to finally getting a BBQ restraurant in the newly revised Roosevelt area.  

The line was ridiculous, like down the block but it was Friday and the Grand opening ..... I was happy to wait because the streets were smelling of succulent bbq.  

After a 40 minute wait (which was to be expected on opening day) the cutest, bald head, ring in nose girl took my order with lightening speed she turned around and shouted out my order..... NYC pastrami sandwich, bbq brisket, Mac and cheese, greens, coleslaw, crack wings and bbq baked bean..... 

As I walked to the back of the restaurant and  sat outside under the stars. The back yard area is just enough space for you to enjoy your meal while stretching your legs. Omg....is that my stomach!

 Just as I looked up, the waitress had my food....

I think I'm in pig heaven... the aroma was killing my nasal passages. There were so many delightful smells I was on over drive.  

Before eating we must...
FIRST..... give thanks to the amazing brisket, bbq ribs, NYC pastrami sandwich, crack wings  greens, mac and cheese...... 

I started with the crack wings.... I ordered it dry and with sauce. It was delicious, the flavors were all there... as I looked down I saw four crack bones looking back at me. In my Urkel voice \"Did I do that\"!

Mac and cheese : the cheese was so velvety smooth and really delicious.  Just like mac and cheese should taste. Not watery, soupy cheese but that thick cheese. Yummy! 

Greens: the greens were good with a little kick,not spicy but a kick. Just what you need! 

NYC pastrami: this was by far the best. It took me back to Katz's Deli in NYC.  The pastrami melted in your mouth and the marble bread complimented the pastrami so well. I give a NYC/BX salute to this sandwich. It made me proud! 

BBQ beans: just like slow roasted on a stove bbq beans should be. It had an awesome smoked flavor.  

I can't get enough of Trapp Haus...the name alone makes me want to come back.  

I finally get it..Trapp Haus makes the bbq so good you CAN'T LEAVE... for me just throw away the key!"}
{"text":"Good food friendly staff! Nice outdoor patio and tasty greens and brisket, A come and get fed place! We will be back"}
{"text":"Very good best fish I have had  in the valley since I been here. Highly Recommend  the chef brought me some chicken out and was tender juicy and full of Smokey flavors"}
{"text":"This is for the service. 3 of us arrived with two people ahead who didnt order yet...no problem. But, then 3 hipsters walked in liked they own the place and order taker stops and waits on them...they had called in an order...each one payed seperately...then they get their food and sit in restaurant...very poor service so far...then it wasnt just the 2 ahead of us...there were 2 more at bar who didnt order yet either. I know you are new...but come on...either run2 registers one for call ins and one walk ins....or TAKE EACH CUSTOMER IN ORDER OF APPEARANCE...NO PREFERENCE!!! WTF? Food was good. A few bits o fat. The muffin a bit dry...but good bbq all over!"}
{"text":"I grew up eating Texas BBQ, but moved from San Antonio to Phoenix late last year. I had my \"bbq place\" in San Antonio and I'm so happy now I have a bbq place here! Everything was so tender and flavorful. We had the family platter with chicken, ribs, brisket and pulled pork. Everything was delicious and the sides (often sub-par at bbq places) were also super flavorful. They roasted a whole pig and were giving out samples and I have no idea how they did it but the bbq sauce flavor was there throughout- not just smoky, but their house bbq sauce flavor (which is really good) was somehow in every single bite.

Highly recommended! We'll be back many times."}
{"text":"Bomb! The pork heaven Sammy was incredible. Bf got the Mac Bowl  and it was absolutely amazing!"}
{"text":"Food was good I would go back. The only reason I am giving 3 stars is because of customer service, at no fault of the employees.they seemed very eager to do right thing just lack direction from supervision. Also my wings were under cooked, they refunded my money without me having to ask witch was a big plus. Not the best BBQ I've ever had but was good and I would go back. With time and some excellent customer service this place will definitely get 5 starts"}
{"text":"This was opening night on a First Friday/McDowell Mountain Music Festival so take this as a preliminary review and it should be taken with a grain of salt. I will be back to make a revision soon.

There was a short line that lasted a really really long time. That was not unexpected as the neighborhood was pumping. 

It was the young staffs first day and they were really busting their asses.

I ordered the Brisket Platter with Mac & Cheese and Fries. The food arrived quickly (after the long lasting line) and it was \"okay\".

The Mac & Cheese was pretty flavorless, the fries were really good, the corn muffin was unique but a little dry. The brisket was very very fatty and the bbq sauce that was lightly drizzled on it was sweet and tasted alright.

The interior is fun. There's a very short bar as you walk in, then a small dining room with four or five tables in the back and an outdoor patio with a few tables. It's nice. I will be back."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed our visit!! Good portions for reasonable price! Friendly atmosphere- yummy food definitely will be going back! Great family, friends or even day date atmosphere- everyone is really nice! Will definitely be back-"}
{"text":"Quick and simple. Ordered the Family sampler and it was more than enough for 4 people. Soft and tender meat at a great value with delicious sides."}
{"text":"Dang I wasn't ready for Trapp Haus- those wings are FIREEE. I ordered the dry rub crack wings and they ARE ADDICTING. 
I was driving by and literally had to make a U-Turn to try this place out. Wasn't looking for it, never heard of it, BAM! An act of God.... the doors were open and the smell of BBQ lingered in the air. 
Do yourself a solid and stop in.. I dare you not to order.
My only mistake: not going on an empty stomach to order more... it all looked finger lock-in' good."}
{"text":"Ribs were the best! Everything was great, including the service and the cook is a jokester. :)"}
{"text":"I think this is a great concept and an awesome addition to Roosevelt Row. The atmosphere is super cool and I love their music but there is very limited seating so during peak times that may be a problem. I will say their portions are huge and pretty expensive. On their menu, for a sandwich and small side of chips it's $10-$14, when at Little Miss BBQ a sandwich and a side of either beans, grits, potato salad, or coleslaw is only $9.50-$10.75. Now for the quality of the food, it's good. It's definitely better than Rudy's or Bobby Q's but it is not anywhere near Little Miss BBQ or Satchmo's. We tried ordering the rib tips ($7) but they weren't ready yet so they gave us an order of ribs without up-charging us. We also split the pulled pork sandwich ($11), mac and cheese ($3), and beans ($3) and ordered two beers ($6 each). My favorite was the mac and cheese and the house chips, both were delicious. The pork and the ribs were solid but the BBQ sauce is what made them. I think those and the beans were lacking in the smokiness department. We will definitely give this place another try later on down the road."}
{"text":"As much as I want to give 4 stars, this trip only garners a solid 3. Ordered the rib tips which were nice and tender plus I could taste the spicy rub which was great. The down side was they were smothered in a super sweet BBQ Sauce, more like candy than BBQ Sauce, I will try next visit with sauce on the side. I also ordered the Mac Bowl with Brisket which had a base of mac n cheese topped with crispy, dry, Chopped Brisket again smothered in Super Sweet BBQ Sauce. The Mac n Cheese might have been good on it's own but covered in dry crispy brisket and sugar BBQ Sauce was unable to really taste. Again I will try again with BBQ Sauce on the side and hope the Dry Brisket was just a bad day as I know Phil does better than what I was served. I will be back and hope to add a couple stars in the future as well as maybe find they add a not so sweet Sauce to the menu."}
{"text":"This restaurant is in a cute artsy kind of area. There is street parking, which I believe is metered. We dined in on a Tuesday evening. There is a small dining area, which probably seats about twenty, comfortably. There is also an outdoor patio, with a few tables for dining al fresco.

The menu includes bbq favs such as ribs, pulled pork, brisket and hot links; along with side dishes of greens, macaroni and cheese, beans, etc. 

I ordered lemonade (which was bottled), and a meal with a choice of two meats (hot links and pulled pork), macaroni and cheese and greens. 
The meats were glazed with a sweet sauce, which was a nice compliment. Both side dishes were good, but I was disappointed in the serving size. The cups the sides were served in were half the size of usual cups. The cook was particularly stingy with the greens; there was literally two forks full of greens in the cup.
The meal came with a split pretzel bun (slider sized), which I thought was an odd choice of bread for a barbeque meal.
Overall, we were pleased enough to return if in the area again.

I paid about $21 for my meal."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch, ordered the BBQ platter with Brisket and chicken + 2 sides (Jalapeño grits & greens). 

Overall, the place was clean, service was excellent and prices were OK - not too high. Brisket was tender, well seasoned and juicy, I'd give it a 8/10. The chicken was also well seasoned 8/10. The greens weren't necessarily to die for, but they were a decent pairing 6/10. The grits were 9/10 and the complimentary cornbread was 7/10. Overall I think this place is decent. May need to try it one more time but I'd recommend going here if you're looking for a nice location; clean place, friendly service and more than decent food. 3.8/5.0 stars"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick lunch. I happened to be the only patron in at that time, so I must have missed the lunch rush. Great for me since I was hungry, but it left the vibe a little quiet.  The staff was very nice and the Chef offered me a quick taste of their pulled pork while I decided.  It worked, pulled pork it was!  So good.  I had the grits which were fantastic and the baked beans which were good.  They had meat in them which I wasn't expecting, but they were good.  The pork was also delicious and the corn muffin was nice and fresh.  Place is small but I love the decor.  The only reason I am knocking it one star is the food was warm.  I prefer my food piping hot, but I'd even accept hot.  Warm BBQ is ok.  Flavor was great though and the pork was tender so flavor redeemed."}
{"text":"I will definitely be back. The place was good. 

Had the Pulled Pork platter with a side of waffle fries and the greens. Pulled pork was moist and tender, a good thing. BBQ sauce was not overwhelming at all. Waffle fries were amazing. Looking forward to trying the ribs in the future. Keep grilling!"}
{"text":"My mom took me today because she's been raving about this place since they opened. To start, I walked in and this place looks very friendly and cute. As I ordered it was great to be able to see the kitchen from the register and to see the owner making my sandwich. I ordered the Boss Hog to go which has pulled pork, brisket, BBQ sauce, honey jalapeño coleslaw on crispy hero. First thing to point out is that this bread does not get soggy and fall apart when you take it to go like other places. Second the meats practically melt in your mouth and the house specially made BBQ sauce is DELICIOUS! This is now my favorite BBQ place and can't wait to try more of their menu.

Now I will still give this place 5 stars because the food is delicious but I do have to mention that I was not happy with the small eating space or parking space. I know it just opened this month so hopefully more space is coming soon"}
{"text":"The excitement that a BBQ restaurant was going to open in the Phoenix Roosevelt Art District was exciting. 



Outside curb appeal, this restaurant is warm and inviting. When you get in the door it has very little space to place your orders. The menu looks great.  They need to do something with the dining area. It's too small. Possibly advertise that this is a \"food to go\" restaurant  with limited or no seating. While we were waiting in line and lunch time on Sunday afternoon, customers were turned away because of no seating in the dining area or patio. It took a long time to order food. 

The BBQ was bad. I'm from Kansas City. I grew up eating award wining BBQ. My fist job was at a BBQ restaurant. The ribs were over cooked and fatty. The brisket was chopped and had to much fat. The pulled pork was not eatable. Once again to much fat.  The baked bens were disappointing. They tasted like can baked beans. The Mac and Cheese tasted like box Mac and Cheese. 

Maybe this was just a bad day and time that we came to this restaurant. I will be back in a few weeks for another try. I love ribs and brisket. 

I hope the owner is onsite and can evaluate his restaurant. I want it to be a success. I love Roosevelt Art District. We need more private business owners."}
{"text":"Seriously, The BEST BBQ in 63 years of living, no kidding. The place has a nice funky, but relaxing feel to it...take a look at the beautiful wood counter in front. There is a nice patio in the back, flower planters on the fence on the perimeter of the patio. The service was excellent, not overbearing but enough to know that they really want to make sure you are enjoying the food, etc.  
We had the \"Mac Rolls\" which were incredible, deep fried decadance, \"The Philly Cheese Fix\" is my new fav BBQ sandwich and \"The Classic\".  The brisket was so tender and the sauce perfect amount of kick to it.
We'll definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"Sooooo happy to have legit old school bbq downtown! Walking in the door & getting hit with smells of smokey goodness - you already know you're in for something awesome!

Chill, friendly vibe from guests & staff alike, menu reading was a drool-inducing experience. My teen ordered the mac & cheese w/ pulled pork bowl (check her face on the accompanying photo to see how she liked it, lol!) Hubs & I eat got bbq platters, sampling the pulled pork brisket, jalapeno grits (creamy, cheesy comfort food - I couldn't stop eating!), mean greens (smoky w/ a bit of turkey), honey jalapeno cole slaw, home made pickles (crunchy w/ just a bit of bite), and a moist corn muffin that you just need to call \"dessert\". Everything slayed!

I know you're here for the food but the old school R&B jams and the super cute interior with an awesome pigs flyin' cactus celebrating mural is just the cherry on top. 

We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Upsides:
pulled pork sandwich and hot links are way up there on ranking
waffle fries
beans

Downsides:
chips to seasoned
brisket was over cooked and I seen them pulling it out of the fridge
no fountain drinks
no ice(seriously)
water cups for the dispenser for some reason are behind counter
mac and cheese also has weird seasoning

They need to figure out how to streamline ordering, if you have more than two people waiting in line you are basically outside, also it takes too long for simple ordering."}
{"text":"Just go now! Everything was amazing! She had the dry rub wings and waffle fries...  so, so good! I had the 2 meat plate brisket and ribs w/ Mac n cheese and greens.. Listen, if you don't take my word for it, that's your fault...    seriously, everything was amazing."}
