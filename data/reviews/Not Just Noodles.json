{"text":"Not Just Noodles is the perfect example of \"you get what you pay for\".  The restaurant itself looks like a dingy dump, but the food and the price you pay makes you forget all that. The staff is really nice and the food comes out really quickly.  I recommend getting the hot and sour soup. They don't skimp on the tofu and bamboo shoots and it's the perfect amount of sour and spice. The set lunches are definitely the best deals so go between 11-4."}
{"text":"My colleague likes them, so I went with friend for lunch. a typical Chinese take away style cooking. 
Personally I will not return. But the stuff were nice."}
{"text":"Not just noodles!  Stomach discomfort and gas that could kill a small child, too! (presumably from the greasy, MSG-laden food)."}
{"text":"Good old Chinese food, staple menu items, tried and true. Quick service and bubble tea is a plus."}
{"text":"Ordered mixed vegetables and when I got home it was just broccoli.  They never said a thing about having no veggies."}
{"text":"I included tips in the bill through credit card, and then the lady at the counter yelled, \"you didn't tip the serving lady?\" I said I did. Then she looked at the bill and said okay. This a terrible way to treat after actually showing gratuity. Absolutely unnecessary."}
{"text":"Had the beef noodles (Ho fun) for take out, I specifically asked for NO MSG and LESS GREASY and they did at my request. Taste slightly bland as you would expect but still excellent! Lots of beef and noodles are not too salty. Only thing is quite expensive, and portion is a large, not extra large!"}
{"text":"love this place. great for take out - get the \"family meal\" - for $23 bucks 3 people can eat quite a bit of food. They are really nice and fast. My go-to Chinese place outside of Chinatown."}
{"text":"This is a popular go-to for students living around the neighborhood (including myself :) ). The food is similar to New Ho King in Chinatown or really any other msg-filled but nevertheless filling Chinese food. The bubble tea here is decent as well.. they add a little too much to my taste but their avocado one is really good."}
{"text":"\"not just noodles\" .  More like \"literally just noodles\", because that's the only thing worth getting from this place. This was my go-to place way back in first year university. 

pros: The married couple (I think they're married) have a funny dynamic. Sometimes I go just to see them debate over misheard orders. Also the pad thai and Cantonese chow mein are my favourites from this place. The price is relatively cheap and the portions are big. This is the place to go if you're looking to get full, fast, and for a good price. 

cons: Not exactly the nicest atmosphere if you're going to eat there. The service is not always the greatest. And finally, like I said before, anything other than noodles is usually a miss."}
{"text":"It's cheap, it's delicious, what more can you ask for?!

My husband and I used to frequent this place all the time - ate upstairs or took it home with us. We became regulars and they knew our usual order and greeted us when we came in. It was like a second home ;) We stopped only because we realized how fat we were getting from not doing anything outside of eating out everyday, but we still love it! haha. 

We recently got married, and for rehearsal dinner, we actually ordered party platters of some of their more popular items on their menu. The prices for the party platters were reasonable and they were super friendly when trying to set the delivery of it up. Delivery came on time and was incredibly helpful. Even though some of our guests didn't get to eat until an hour after it was delivered (our poor planning meant the food showed up at the beginning of rehearsal, so it sat in chafing dishes for an hour), everyone LOVED it! Some of my friends whom also live in the area started asking us where we got the food from because it was so delicious!

I can't tell you how happy I am with this place!! Definitely a neighbourhood gem. Will always be buying from here!"}
{"text":"Best Chinese food in Toronto, according to my Chinese wife. Food is fresh,  very tasty and cost is very low. If the restaurant nearby our home,  I will eat at least 4 times a week. It was quite fresh and crispy. Yum."}
{"text":"Fairly decent \"western style\" Chinese place with good prices.  Have only tried a couple of dishes here and they were good enough.  Prices are reasonable, particularly if you get a combo.  Egg rolls contain a generous amount of meat, but other than that are not very good (they use cabbage instead of bean sprouts)."}
{"text":"Have never been here before, will definitely be going back,  Food was excellent, picked up take-out and it was still steaming hot when i got home - 10 minute uber away."}
{"text":"The food was decent at best but was quite dry. The upsetting portion of my expericne was that when the food was delivered, the driver harassed us for tips. It was made clear on the phone, when order was placed, that tips and delivery would be covered in the total they provided.

Disappointed with my initial expericne with this restaurant and am unsure if I will be getting food from here again."}
{"text":"Well, you think I would have learned from previous visits NOT to return to Not Just Noodles.

Haven't been there for more than a year due to previous dislike, but wandered in today...  Should have wandered out.  It is still dirty, staff still have contempt for customers, prices have once again increased steeply, uneaten food from tables is still going back to the kitchen instead of into the garbage, and today, the last straw...

I ordered something that was $7.50.  I noticed that the cashier rang up $7.55.  On being questioned about the incorrect price, she explained that the extra 5 cents was for a bag to put the food in. Are you kidding me???  Who does this?

Your dishonesty and greed have finally gotten to me, Not Just Noodles.  I am finished with you.  Make your money on some other sucker.

Oh, I almost forgot, my friend who used to go there told me to count my change.  He has been over-charged or short-changed several times, and in spite of the fact that he caught them every time, they kept doing it.  I was not short-changed, just over-charged.  I guess they knew I was going to carefully count my change."}
{"text":"They lied, waiter told me they were low on stock and only had noodles. Literally only noodles no flavor, nothing added. I don't know what the other reviews are talking about the space being cramped. I am a dwarf. I got a creepy vibe from the waiter looking down on my shirt, but maybe he couldn't help because I am a dwarf. I found the decor very interesting, in that you have to climb into your chairs, and that they have cracks in the wall to make it seem like there was an earthquake. Very Hollywood. You really can't judge a book by its cover."}
{"text":"You get what you pay for and sometimes that's ok. It's our  staple Chinese restaurant for ages and their open late. Their Cantonese Chow Mein is the best!"}
{"text":"Okay Chinese food for the most part. They serve a few Dim Sum as well. My only issue is that there are always fights going with customers being short changed.  Staff sullen to the point of rudeness.  I live very close to them but I wish there were more Chinese food restaurants around so I could stop going to this one. They are always trying to rip people off, happened with me a couple of times. Fifty cents here, a dollar there, I'm sure it adds up to lots of money within a year."}
{"text":"4 stars based on this as quick takeout/delivery food.  This place is really easy, cheap, convenient, reliable, consistent. I enjoy every dish I've had here but would not eat here every day.
It's my go to delivery for that guilty take out."}
{"text":"Cantonese Chow Mein is really good!  Sure the place is cramped and who would want to eat-in, but the food is tasty.  I always get the Cantonese CM because the noodles are crispy and they don't skimp on the meat. They are open late and always seem to have customers."}
{"text":"I always turn to Not Just Noodles when I'm too lazy to cook at home and want Chinese food without spending big bucks. It is steps away from my home so I always get takeout from there (I'm always lazy).

I've only eaten in at the restaurant once as their decor isn't really flattering to their food. They have pretty good dishes there but I would not recommend getting dim sum from there, it just does not feel authentic. Other than their dim sum, everything else is pretty good. With their price, its a steal!

Note: They accept credit cards but charge a small handling fee."}
{"text":"If your craving some standard Chinese fare this is the place to go, it's not Lai Wai Heen but it's not Ho-Lee-Chows either.  But it has enough diversity that the Chinese or non-Chinese would both find acceptable

What makes this place outstanding is that It has two standard lunch specials per weekday that comes with rice/noodles, entre, egg roll and a hot and sour soup for $4.99+tax.  Can't get this good a deal in downtown Toronto, where most lunches have gone up $2-3 in the past year or two.

Negative: It's not food for the health conscious  but then I've never been to a Chinese place that was."}
{"text":"Back when I lived in the village this was my favorite bubble tea in the city. Honey with lemon, all the way. I'm not sure what it's like these days, but the tapioca was fresh every time I had it and they were nice and quick."}
{"text":"As mentioned in a previous comment, always double check the amount they try to charge you, because it's always off by a few cents. I've ordered deliveries 2 or 3 times and every single time I had to argue with with the lady over the phone because she was rounded up to their advantage. Every time, she would turn cold and rude over the phone, and send the delivery guy with still the incorrect amount.
Needless to say that it kind of discouraged me to try again, because surprisingly, when I order in, I don't expect to argue over the bill forever. Anyway, last week end, I went there as I had a craving for their beef ho fun, which costs $8.50. Once I ordered, the lady typed $8.55 as before tax price. I pointed out that she was not using the correct amount. She then gave me the bad look and started to argue. Seeing that I wouldn't let go, she said \"it's for plastic bag\". So first, you charge me $0.05 for a plastic bad and second you don't even ask if I want one huh. An Asian woman walked in and started to speak Asian with her, so I no longer existed. I managed to tell her I didn't need a bag so she corrected the price, all while talking to that new customer. She then turned to me as I handed my credit card, and again: $0.25 for credit card. I told her to cancel the order because she was being annoying. She just turned around to the kitchen, yelled \"cancelled\" and turned to that Asian woman and kept talking.
I don't know if the owner sometimes reads the comments online but no matter where I go, their customer service is tagged as awful. Maybe it's time they do something about it.
I'm not Canadian so I don't know how that works here, but I wish there was a regulatory organism to avoid customers to be scammed by restaurants like that, because between that and those that at the last minute tell you it's cash only, it's really annoying!"}
{"text":"The decor is atrocious! Needs major update but the food is freaking amazing! I usually have take out because the restaurant is incredibly outdated and dismal. 


I always come back because the food is the best! 

People! You must try the spicy squid! They make the best egg rolls!  In history, I go jogging and make a pit stop and grab an egg roll or two....or three. 

Another must have item is the fresh watermelon bubble tea. My other guilty pleasure here. It's the best bubble tea drink ever! The service here is good as well, I always enjoy the staff here, laid back and friendly."}
{"text":"This place has been around for years!

Food is fresh and cheap but it is only edible for 1,2 days. 
They give a lot, so it is very full-filling. 

I love their bubble tea.
I also ask them to deliver all the time, they are fast and good at delivering their food. (The packaging is perfect)

I never like eating there but they do have two floor. Place looks chaotic sometimes because lots of people come in."}
{"text":"Doesn't blow my mind, but sometimes you just want quick, affordable Chinese.  One of the better Chinese joints around Yonge and Bay if you don't want to spend a lot.

I usually go for the General Tso special if I'm there on the right day - comes with hot and sour soup, egg roll and rice for $4.99.

Update: I've been going here on and off for about a year and upped my rating by a star. The same review holds, but I've consistently gotten great service and the food has stayed solid."}
{"text":"Ordered take out from the store, waited 30 minutes and the staff said nothing. Asked why food was taking so long and the food was ready, they just decided not to notify me that my order was ready. I just assumed the order I watched sitting there the whole time was for someone else other wise surely the guy would have said something. Slack."}
{"text":"Definitely won't come back. They always intentionally charge you more than price on the menu. Especially the case when you skip for a receipt. At first I didn't realize that cuz it is not a large amounts. Sometimes I pointed out when buying take out they said sorry and refund you. But if you didn't point out right away at the spot they will ignore and never admit what they are doing. Won't come back again when they treat customers like this."}
{"text":"Love this place. So cheap and the quantities you get are massive.

If you're looking for fancy cuisine don't bother coming here but if you want to gorge out on a giant plate of chicken fried rice for 5$ then this is the place for you."}
{"text":"Terrible food. There is absolutely NO flavor or seasoning in the food. Not worth the money and I have no idea why people are giving rice stars unless they don't actually know what this kind of food is capable of tasting like."}
{"text":"I wouldn't come here again, there are many other great options in the area. I wish the restaurant were cleaner, it smelled like urine the entire time we were eating, and it totally ruined our appetite."}
{"text":"They had a new decoration and the place looks much better inside now. I am giving you a 4 star for the effort and money you spent to make this place better. Food is grease and inexpensive as usual, its not heavy but still much better than MacDonalds' burgers, at least you have real meat and veggies that aren't full with toxins."}
{"text":"Many better options near the area for good, authentic Chinese food (Queen's Dumplings for example). Horrible \"tom yum\" soup, and gave me only 7 shrimp pieces in my $10.50 kung pao shrimp. Why charge extra for seafood AND give me a minuscule amount? The Kung Pao Chicken on the other hand was not that bad. From the other reviews, it seems like this place has a problem with cleanliness which leads me to wonder how they pass their food safety inspections. Would only come back if I'm hungry past midnight and was craving Chinese as this place does have late hours."}
{"text":"I always get the Cantonese Chow mien here! 

Not the best Cantonese chow mien I have had, but for $10 you can't beat it. 
Kind of a dirty place, I would only go for takeout."}
{"text":"Not Just Noodles is my favourite sit down, get out Chinese food restaurant downtown.

The upstairs dining room is small, but cozy and quiet; there are maybe twelve tables, if that. The menu is varied and gives you a lot of options. Want a small meal? Combo? Family plate? Feel like just an appetizer and soup? Not Just Noodles has got you covered.

General Tao's chicken... mm, mm, good. I usually wind up ordering a one item family plate from the special menu, as they all include an eggroll, soup and chicken fried rice. It's filling, and you can toss out the \"just hungry again later\" jokes; it doesn't happen here (to me at least).

As a few other people have stated, the decor of the restaurant leaves something to be desired, but maybe it's in the bad taste that gives Not Just Noodles its charm?

My one complaint against the restaurant is one of the servers, who is just terrible at her job in every way, shape and form. She is unfriendly, rude, blunt, drops the plate on your table, usually spills something as she swipes the dishes off the table as if she was in a huge rush (I have never seen the restaurant packed, so I doubt that would be the case). She is just an all around horrible server and should be in any field with daily, consistent, face-to-face contact with people.

Other than that, Not Just Noodles is a fantastic restaurant, whether you are in the mood for Chinese, or just hungry.

A hearty tip of the hat."}
{"text":"Maybe just being there once is too soon to write a review, but I don't think I'll return.
The place is small and doesn't look clean enough. I order beef noodle soup and dim sum. I can tell the way they made my noodle is just poured the beef to the noodle soup before they served it. I had to stir it to make my noodle. For my dim sum, usually it should have shrimp inside, but they have it on top, when I tried to bite it, the shrimp fell off.
Overall the food taste not bad, but they can be better."}
{"text":"It's cheap and reasonably fast but way too sweet. 

I ordered general tso's and sweet and sour pork and I was really disappointed. The general tso chicken had no spice and was almost pure sugar on batter. The sweet and sour pork was all sweet. Basically it was like eating candy.. way too much sugar."}
{"text":"Living downtown I've walked past or drove past this place 2030 times and each time it was full of people so I thought I'd give it a go. I ordered a head first and went and picked it up in 15 minutes and it was ready in about 20. Besides the five 10-minute delay when it comes to price taste quality, I think everything was quite good. For fast food pick-up or delivery delivery Chinese food at this price is probably the best I've had. The Cantonese chow mein was quite good beef and vegetables was even better and the best of all was the hot and sour soup. It's as good as those fancy Chinese restaurants I charge you $15 a bowl."}
{"text":"Food was poorly prepared and dry. Rather unappetizing unfortunately since I was really in the mood for Chinese food. The cost of the food is unreasonable considering the quality you get. Avoid if you can."}
{"text":"I came by half hour before my lunch break is over and bought beef ho fun and egg roll and said it was for to go, but then realized i have a bit of time to have a quick bite before going back to work. The lady gave me the bag for to go when i asked her if i can go upstairs in the dining room to eat the egg roll and she gave me \"the look\" and said that i ordered take out so next time i tell them dine in.. I explained i'm not eating the noodle just the eggroll trying to explain that i won't waste her effort of packing the noodles for me.. And besides if ever i had decided to dine in i will ask for take out box anyways because I won't be able to finish it.. I clearly to her i just needed to sit but even that the lady is not happy about it.. So i walk out the restaurant and ate my food at the park nearby..

Anyways that will be my last time visiting there.. Even though their food is good.. I won't be able to stomach the attitude and unwelcome in this restaurant..."}
{"text":"OK food in what seems like a divey diner type feel.  When I'm walking down Yonge St and want some Asian food, I'd drop in.

The food is decent price and pretty fast.  Nothing really stands out but nothing I've had here is terrible either.  If you want to avoid the walk down to Chinatown this is definitely an option for you!  It's not as good as some of the places in Chinatown but saves you a walk of 20+ minutes!"}
{"text":"Ordered a Singapore vermicelli. Very flavourful, good ratio of ingredients (sometimes you don't get as much meat and shrimp), price is great...but one star off for the extra charge for debit or credit.  Come prepared with cash."}
{"text":"Food was typical canadianized chinese food (it's okay). Service was alright until the waiter cashed me out, in which the waiter did not give me back the change that was owed to me. I asked for my change, the waiter stated the change was tip. Its upsetting that he took the decision of how much I wanted to tip away from me. I will not come back."}
{"text":"In a nutshell, this place is \"old school\" chinese dive.  Very greasy.  Some dishes I have tried were:  Crispy Beef, Chicken Fried Rice, Egg Rolls, Veg Spring Rolls, Chicken Chow Mein, General Tao, Ho Fun...  I would not order their Sweet and Sour Chicken Balls, nor their General Tao tofu again, nor their fried yellow noodles.  Their noodles were really really greasy - more greasy than standard.  And I ordered their 3 kinds of vegetables stir-fried and the dish only came with 2 and mainly just broccoli.  I still like that they are in the neighbourhood to satisfy cravings for Egg Rolls and Veg springrolls and General Tao chicken.  They really need to clean this place up."}
{"text":"Fast and good!

I got the seafood with vegetables on rice. WHOA the portion was huge! It was enough to feed another person and maybe a half person LOL 

Seriously it was that huge! The flavors were like Starburst. I wish I was with a group so that I could've tried more but if I am ever back in town, I will most def go here for dinner and try out other things. Maybe even lunch. 

OH YEAH I had it to go. The seating is very limited here but then again, most spots in Toronto are like this."}
{"text":"Filthy!
Food is ok if you have very low culinary expectations or experience. 
Perfect for drunk or stoned Torontonians that desire an upscale experience from McDonald's."}
{"text":"Great place to eat! Super cheap and wonderful place to lookout. Right on the intersection and top floor you can see a lot of things. Food was great. One of the best Chow Mein in the city. Upstairs is really quiet so it's great to go for a quick quiet lunch or dinner. Rarely gets busy."}
{"text":"If you are hungover, you must eat here...instant cure, I promise.  The Cantonese Chow Mein is delicious, the chicken balls are consistently moist and the General Tao chicken is spot on.  Really tasty, even better later on when you're feeling slightly less hungover and just need to start mowing down on something."}
{"text":"I have a thing for greasy Chinese food, and this hits the spot.  I love their Beef Ho Fun, and they make pretty good bubble tea as well.

Their staff is friendly every time I go in, the price is right, and it's open pretty late, the portions are huge, so I have no complaints. The \"dumpiness\" of this place I think adds to the atmosphere of a casual, fast, Chinese spot."}
{"text":"This place is the best cheap and fast Chinese joint in the neighbourhood. We usually get takeout as the place doesn't have the best ambiance but I find that is what you get for most cheap Chinese restaurants. 

I always get sweet and sour pork and my bf black pepper beef. We also like to get some yang chow fried rice to go with our meats. 

One of the employees who is an older gentleman who is always at the cash is very kind and makes my trips very pleasant. 

If you want to save time waking for your takeout call ahead about 10 minutes before you arrive to the location and your good should be ready when you arrive. I always have their takeout menu pinned to my fridge so I can call ahead and arrive to my food waiting for me. How convenient :)"}
{"text":"After successfully avoiding this place for the two years I've lived in the area, I finally decided to give it a chance. Huge mistake. I'm not sure what I expected from this sketchy looking restaurant, but I thought I might be pleasantly surprised. The food here is disgusting, every dish, every ingredient tasted rotten. You really get what you paid for, and what are you paying for here is garbage. Also, they will try to scam you whenever the opportunity arises. I ordered the beef in tomato sauce on rice, I simply asked for the rice to be put separately from the beef and tomato sauce, and somehow I cannot do that without being charged more. They also use MSG in everything here by default. If you want fresh, tasty, good quality food, DO NOT come here. No pleasant surprises await you."}
{"text":"The food is OK but be very careful when you place a delivery order because they RIP YOU OFF. Even though I live 2 blocks away she added an extra \"delivery charge\" of 4 dollars! On the menu it says it is supposed to be 1 dollar. I called back and tried to explain with her but she pretended like she does not understand and says its because of where I live. I LIVE 2 BLOCKS AWAY! I added everything up again and called AGAIN to tell them they were ripping me off and I wanted to cancel my order. Then she understood perfectly all of a sudden and removed the extra charges. Please be aware that this restaurant will charge you whatever it chooses to at the time!"}
{"text":"I have only tried little bites from this place but I must say that my Gf who generally has quite the discerning palate absolutely adores this place. Even though it looks just like any other food court Chinese food.

It is her comfort food which reminds her of home cooking I guess.

Whenever she has had a long day or just wants to waste away a Sunday she orders something - usually something called the \"Ji Lunch Special\" with hot and sour soup from what I hear over the phone and seems to enjoy it more than life itself. I think its chicken? 

So long story short - give it a shot and if you ever see me in there looking like a confused bumbling fool and asking to pickup a \"Jiiiii Lunch Special w/hot and sour soup\", don't laugh. I am just grabbing it for her and the people working there are already laughing at me enough!"}
{"text":"Very nice restaurant very great food family owned prices are amazing fast service the chicken balls are fantastic chicken wings are amazing my favorite is the won ton soup. When you first walk in there are a few tables to sit at but if you have more than three people you can go upstairs to the dinning room"}
{"text":"Pretty cheap (under $10) to satisfy your cravings for something Chinese. It's not really authentic let's be honest. If you're hungry before last call or don't want to cook after a grueling day at work, this place is for you. They even have pictures of some dishes to choose from on the wall as you walk in. Take out is quick depending on the size of your order. I usually get the Shanghai noodles pretty average but filling. I kick it up a bit with some chili garlic sauce.  Everything tastes better with garlic chili sauce is my motto or if it doesn't kill you, yolo!"}
{"text":"Envie d'un chinois pas cher et rapide? La chaine Not just noodles vous propose les plats typiques de la gastronomie chinoise sur place ou à emporter.
Ne vous fiez pas à l'ambiance un peu roots et glauque de la salle à l'étage avec la petite radio qui joue du jazz et les employés qui mangent des chicken wings avec une grande passion; ça a son charme ^^


// Need a quick chinese fix? Not Just Noodles will offer the classic dishes of chinese cuisine.
Don't be afraid of the shady atmosphere upstairs, the tiny radio playing jazz music and the employees devouring their chicken wings is kinda soothing ^^"}
{"text":"I've been hitting this Chinese food gem for years--and it's always good and cheap.

Their General Tsao's Chicken is one hearty portion with fresh broccoli surrounding it like the picture, and their House Pad Thai and House Special Rice is seriously delicious!!!!!! 
You have to try their great noodle in soup and won ton soups, as well as the reason why I travel all the way down to Yonge and Wellesley--their Dim Sum. Great siu mei. 

Sit upstairs if you're going to dine in, and take in the passersby on the street below; or sit on the cozy leather seats downstairs for a quick lunch special. They deliver and do take out too, and they are pleasant enough. Service is usually quick and bathrooms are kept clean.

I have yet to find a place as consistent in tastiness and service as Not Just Noodles!"}
{"text":"One of the best Chinese/Vietnamese/Korean places in the area. Humble premises, amazing food and great prices. The staff are also very friendly and polite."}
{"text":"This was one of my favorite places to grab cheap chinese food for lunch. Their lunch special increased in price but is really cheap ($5.99) for what they give you (rice, meat, egg roll, soup, salad). I believe it goes from 11am-4pm. If you get there early on in the lunch special they have hot tables where you can choose how many items you want with your lunch special and they have different tier prices. The food always makes me full and sometimes the lunch special lasts for a few meals. The food is always tasty, I've liked everything that I've ordered there, though i'm partial to the General Tao's Chicken and the Kung Pao Shrimp.

The only problems I have with the place is that it just seems a bit grimey and rundown, the food is really greasy and most likely has MSG in it."}
{"text":"Unfortunate this has happened to many times with this place and I hadn't to write a review. 

Basically 1/3 orders are always messed up. I never make any substitutions just order simply off the menu. Once agiain we ordered and again my crispy beef on rice came with no rice!! 
When I called back to ask what happened, they told me I ordered wrong even though when the order was repeated to me the lady said crispy beef ON RICE. So now I just have a bowl of beef for the same price as my usual meal. 

It's a shame because the food is actually pretty decent and the prices are great. I just wish they got my orders right."}
{"text":"Prettt decent food for the price. I really liked the spicy sauce. The concept of this restaurant is like Thai Express except this is so much better in terms of taste and price. This place offers a more authentic chinese taste. Also it's  near UofT, great for quick lunch."}
{"text":"Advantages: cheap and quick Chinese takeout on Yonge.

Otherwise, there's not much to recommend here. The restaurant is small, grimy and cramped, and the meat dishes seem to contain very little meat."}
{"text":"Great delivery food! Great taste, fast delivery. Will use again for sure. I have eaten take out here for many years but was surprised by getting the food delivered piping hot. Worth a try for sure"}
{"text":"Been here a few more times since my first review. The consistency of the food varies but overall the General Tso seems to have improved and most of their menu is decent as is their hot and sour soup."}
{"text":"3.5 actually. Quick and hot for the late night craving. I won't say it's authentic; some dishes are the classic representatives of canadianized Chinese food. But they just make you missing sometime. And will go back only for those days."}
{"text":"I have never eaten in; my review is based solely on (frequent) delivery.

Delivery is always fast.  Delivery man is nice (some delivery men are really creepy).  The food comes hot and never soggy, even when deep fried items.

Love the beef fried ho fun with soya sauce; jumbo shrimp with sweet and sour sauce; seafood chow main.   A lot of the dishes are pretty nondescript, but the lady on the phone will explain what they are if you ask.  

But the absolute BEST PART is that they deliver BUBBLE TEA!  So you can order Chinese food and bubble tea to get to your minimum $20.  Avocado fresh fruit is great, lychee slush is delicious....mmmmmm.....such a perfect night in!"}
{"text":"For anyone who really love Chinese food this is the place for you. Fantastic prices great food portions. The restaurant is family owned and operated very friendly.  When you first walk in it looks small there are 4 or 5 tables but if you are a group of 6 or more you can go upstairs to the dining room."}
{"text":"Good, quick, cheap chinese food. This is a good place to stop for a cheap lunch. Not a lot of seats, but most of the customers were students getting take-out. I never did figure out why my pad thai was bright orange, but it tasted good."}
{"text":"Not the nicest restaurant but THE best Chinese food in the area. I think I have been going there for ten years and never really had a bad meal."}
{"text":"Kitchen was arguing among each other when I arrived, dim place, and didn't get my food or water."}
{"text":"Is this the best Chinese food you will have in Toronto? No. In fact, let's take a few seconds to giggle openly about that thought: He, he, he, *giggle!*

Unless of course, you are the type who thinks Mandarin (the restaurant) is authentic Chinese,  then maybe yes, or broke. 

However Just Noodles does not sell itself on that. This place is know for cheap, tasty, satisfactory dishes for years. U of T students and local Chinese people can spot this favourite, mostly coming for the convenience of not having to go to Chinatown or worse go to the big boys up in Markham. 

There is more seating on the second floor in case you want to eat here although this place is mostly known for its \"eat and go\" and pick up service from their rather larger menu. 

Table service is next to non-existent so don't expect much of that and... well, again let's not kid ourselves, you are really here for the main highlight: Cheap, large portioned food. That's it.

Would you take some here in your first date. Dear God, no, unless the date is all kinds of wrong and you want to eject OR you have connected in such a deep, resonant, meaningful level that you could both have dinner in an alley and you would still be happy. Then in either case, this is also a good choice for that. :P  

The place looks and feels like a dive. Would you take her here say, after 6-8 months into a relationship to try it out? Absolutely. It cheesy and fun. 

The fact is these guys have been there for ages, at least 15 years as far as I can remember so I am sure they got some of those tastes down pat. 

If you want a good, inexpensive, hearty meal, this is one of the better places in the Yonge and Wellesley area and way, way better than McDonalds."}
{"text":"well they finally gave the place a paint job.. a few months ago actually.. so it looks fresher now. 

the food is still great and the prices are still very reasonable and the staff are still the same great people :0)"}
{"text":"The reason I give this place a 4 star rating is not because it is close to or near the best Chinese food I've ever had, but rather because for what it is, it's pretty good.  This is a run-down restaurant where I only ever get take out from.  The menu is expansive, all entrees cost between $6-$10 and you get really good portions.  I've liked everything I've ever ordered here and it's super fast.  They even have healthy options like steamed baby bok choy for $4.  Lunch specials everyday for $5.99.  If you live in the area, I would suggest getting take out here."}
{"text":"Ordered on dinner for 5 of us recently and I was pleasantly surprised! The food was really tasty and the portions were very generous. I walk by this restaurant often but never thought much of it. I would definitely order again and/or dine in sometime. Great value!"}
{"text":"Disgusting. We just spent $35 on dinner and I just sent half of it down the garbage shute. The fried rice was easily the worst in recent memory: think fish sauce amplified by 12. The greasy ho fun noodles were a highlight, ironically, while my wife only got halfway through her soup. Never again."}
{"text":"Hot. Fast. Tasty. Cheap. What else do you need to know about this place?? Awesome takeout perfect for a quick dinner. Got 4 dishes, 2 fried rice, 4 spring rolls, 4 soups. = 40 after tax. how do u even make money on that?!"}
{"text":"Stumbled across this place with a few friends a few weeks back, and it's the perfect option for an affordable sharable dinner amongst friends. Not high end quality, but the food is quite good and the staff speaks fluent English and Chinese. The interior looked a bit sketchy, but the food was on point. The place is conveniently right across from Wellesley Station at the intersection of Yonge/Wellesley, and I recommend it for students in the heart of downtown area or business workers on a budget. They are generous in their portions for the price you pay."}
{"text":"I tend to eat here often because it's cheap and easy and near my work. Unfortunately, it is not as cheap as I thought. The past few times I've ordered (always for pick up, it's far too small to eat in) I didn't feel like the price made sense. I figured that they had changed their menu prices since their recent renovation, but it's the same as it was before. Somehow, a $5.95 dish comes out to $7.91. That's 33% in tax! I'm confused. Are they mad at me? Is there an extra tax for food that I just haven't noticed until now? Has anyone else noticed this?"}
{"text":"I've been here 4 times, and my experience has been split 50-50 on really good and just OK (or A-OK according to Yelp terms). 
That coupled with it being a cramped space gives this a 3.5 star rating.

The pricing is reasonable, although I feel like Chinatown has better deals to offer, but for the immediate area I cannot think of a better Chinese spot than here. 

It's quick, tasty, cheap and gives good portion sizes, maybe my next visit will tip this in to a 4 star place for me. 

Kept this review short, but there's not much else to really say about this."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery from this place for the first time last night. Halfway through some bland noodles, I felt something in my mouth. It was a staple.

I'm just glad it wasn't a \"big ol' dead fly\" like Jonathan S. got below."}
{"text":"I don't know why this place got such bad reviews. Yes the ambiance sucks, yes its a hole in the wall.... But the food more than makes up for it.  Its not exactly selling itself as high end. 

Somewhere between a \"Dai pai dong\" (cafeteria-style) and an actual restaurant. Service was quick and the food was yummy! We had the peppered beef tenderloin and udon noodle stir-fry.  The meat was soft and tender, and the noodles were cooked to perfection. The black pepper sauce was bursting with savory goodness.  The zing of the black peppers and the soy sauce mixture = one satisfied tummy!"}
{"text":"Good place to go if you're craving some Chinese food. They are open until 12:30am on Sundays and 1am the rest of the week.
Came here with a group of 8. We got a 6 person dinner special which gave us 6 soups (hot and sour or wonton) and 6 spring rolls, plus a rice dish, and let us choose several other dishes from a specific list. I want to say we got to choose 6 dishes, but I can't recall correctly atm. The total was less than $80! And that's with the tip!
We sat upstairs, of course, as there were so many of us. The service was very nice. I didn't visit the ladies washroom, but apparently the men's one has a window that is supposed to be covered, except the cover fell. So if anyone knows to look, they might catch an interesting view....!!"}
{"text":"For Chinese food and for what you get, I thought it was overpriced. Got the curry beef on rice and eggplant minced pork with a bottle of water and the total came out to $23 before tip. There was very little beef in the curry and just didn't think the value was there. Was quick and the eggplant was tasty/greasy, but probably wouldn't return."}
{"text":"Not Just Noodles is a landmark on my personal map of Toronto. This Chinese restaurant was there on the northwest corner of Yonge and Wellesley when I first visited in 2002, it's still there now (a recent closing for renovations made me worry, happily wrongly), and it likely will continue to be there for some time to come. It serves good Canadianized Chinese food (or at least somewhat Westernized Chinese) food at decent prices."}
{"text":"After reading all the reviews, I had high expectations for this place but my dish ended up being just average. 

I ordered the Singapore vermicelli and found that it was lacking in flavour, spices, and ended up being a bit bland. I typically wouldn't order vermicelli as I'm not a huge fan of it, but decided to on a whim because of the reviews, and also it looked really good.

Although the dish was just average, the portion size was huge, price very reasonable, and the service was really fast - I ordered it for take-out and it was ready in under 5 minutes. 

Will definitely come back again but will order something else next time."}
{"text":"Okay, my non-Asian co-workers (that aren't from Richmond Hill or Markham) love this place, however me, my Asian coworkers and anybody from Richmond Hill and Markham think this is the greasiest, saddest excuse for Chinese food ever.  If I ever told my mom I ordered this and passed it off as Chinese food, she would disown me.  

Pros: They have a huge menu.  Not too expensive
Cons: Full of grease, meat seems over tenderized, and the actual decor of the restaurant is very sketch.  Each time I step in here, I feel like I'm in a basement or a really old restaurant kitchen and I want to leave right away.

Verdict: If you are looking for fake Asian food, with plenty of grease and MSG - go ahead, come here (but please don't call it Chinese food, at least have the decency to call it Westernized Chinese), but if you want authentic, don't bother."}
{"text":"My friend lives near here and she always ordered the pork with green beans.  They do this well as well as the shanghai noodles.  I can't say I've tried anything else here  It's very reasonably priced considering where they are located.  Cleaniness is so-so.  We usually get take out but we have eaten upstairs where it is less noisy and you don't have to gets steamed or 'oiled' up by the open kitchen downstairs.  I worked in a restaurant before and it just cakes onto your skin!  
Overall a decent place if you're looking for Cantonese Chinese food..though the pork and green beans dish I think is a northern chinese dish LOL"}
{"text":"Want normaI Cantonese food in this neck of the woods? Try this place. I give it 4-stars, not because it's fine Cantonese fare, but because it's pretty good Cantonese food at Yonge and Wellesley. 
Growing up eating Markham/Richmond Hill-style chinese food, I find it difficult to get anything comparable downtown. This place satisfies cravings at an affordable price--at least until you can make your way uptown."}
{"text":"Greasy food, VERY tasty. 
Ambiance was ok, seemed as if they're trying to attract people to dine in like a restaurant, but it's really just like a Chinese mcdonalds.

Food is super delicious, pretty greasy, very fast food like but I'd def go back and bring friends!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Just got take out after work. I found myself having one of those moments where I was like \"damn, I gotta slow down shoveling this into my face or I'm not gonna be able to breathe\". I should say this review is 90% based on the fried rice. My mom always yells at me because I'll go to a Chinese buffet and eat nothing but fried rice until I explode. This place is exactly what I want. Not stale and crunchy. Not greasy. Just enough veg and not those dry/shriveled manchu bits. A huge amount of egg (I'm an egg person). The chicken didn't have a single stray bit of nasty connective tissue. I am in heaven. So I also had the chicken balls, equally well-trimmed chicken there with a good tangy sauce. I got a mango bubble tea only they were out of bubbles, strike one, went with the jelly. So tasty and so cheap. I ordered an egg roll but apparently the cooks hate me and didn't make it so I did without (strike two). Anyway, the combo was like five bucks and the tea was only like three. I'll definitely be adding it to my lunch rotation."}
{"text":"I love this place. I eat in all the time. Ive seen other places far worst in appearance but THIS place serves the BEST GENERAL TAO CHICKEN! omg and its also at the special menu that is located at the back. To get the best bang for your buck look there you can do a two dish, three dish menu.
 
note when you order two dish (two main menu items) you get two bowls of soup, two egg rolls. if you order three dish (three main menu items) you get three bowls of soup, three egg rolls....so on and so forth...other wise if theres 3 of you and u guys only want to order 2 main menu items either ask for extra or order a big bowl.

there is also an upstairs area...try and sit by the windows so that you dont have people constantly passing by your table.

The order is fast, and when you see them call them over if you need anything other wise if your upstairs they might not come up to refresh your drinks or if you need anything it might take a while. Be vigilant is all im saying downstairs is usually busy with short orders, and or they will be preparing for orders for delivery.

I usually park infront of Wellesley Station bring coins, or if u have your credit card ready pay after (like on your way out). My usually payment is $3. and under.

Appearance of the restaurant needs work but it does not reflect on how to food taste like on how some people judge this establishment.
The washrooms need work as well there is a separate washroom for men and women but each have one stall.

It would be better if you took the subway if you are on a tighter budget or jut a great place to go to if you were in the area."}
{"text":"Returned here and it's consistent and tasty.  The place can unfortunately look a little dirty but can't do much with chinese restaurants.  I recommend it if you want good and crispy chicken balls, noodles.  The meat is a bit sketchy but oh well.  

Their tea was good too along with broccoli/vegetables."}
{"text":"I like this place because it has what any good restaurant should... Good Food! 

It's Dumpy and Dicey but the food is excellent, good Vegetarian and Vegan Fare, The People are warm. The Food is Hot.  The Food Comes Quickly. Not fantastic Service, but you get what you ordered. 

Decor is beat up, but something kind of cool... Is the place itself... Good Amount of AC going... If I was blazing hot walking or cycling in the Yonge and Wellesley Area, I would go here purely based on getting what you order and how freezing (amazing) the AC IS... 

THE PRICE IS LOW... QUALITY IS GOOD & You meet some Authentic Asian Angries Here... I like that. 5/5 on food 1/5 on Ambiance & Cleanliness (even for low end) so 3/5 it is. 

My Husband brings my Dad here every single time he is in town, my Dad who is a purely about the food guy, raves about Not Just Noodles and how it is his favourite place in Toronto."}
{"text":"No frills Chinese with fresh food. 
Instead of trekking to Chinatown after a drunken night we decided to stop here.
The seafood medley, noodles, and general Tso were delicious."}
{"text":"This is a very affordable place to eat with generous portions. I love their lunch specials! The food tastes reasonable, the price is reasonable and the portion is great!"}
{"text":"Spat out the chicken when eating the fried rice because it was a completely unfamiliar taste and texture!  What the heck?  We looked through the fried rice and the chicken pieces had a very strange appearance, as well!  Had the texture of a glob of lard. Picked the chicken out and threw it in the garbage. The singapore vermicelli was ok but was almost completely noodles with just a few sparse vegetables, unlike the photo displayed in the restaurant.  I would be afraid to try anything here again, despite it being a very convenient location. Disappointing."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years now, I can definitely say that they are favourite of mine when I'm in this part of town. Hi lights for me are the General Tao's chicken, Ma Po tofu, any of the fried rices. Their soups are definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"I thought they only had noodles, but turns out they had fried rice too! Had the pork and shrimp fried rice for takeout and it was really good! Best fried rice I've had in a lot of restaurants, and the shrimp tasted really fresh. Really large portion too. 

Would not recommend the bubble tea (it's pretty diluted and uses powder).

Staff was fluent in English and served food quickly. My place to go for a quick large asian rice/noodle meal. The best Chinese restaurant around the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Went here late night, brought it home and wish I didnt go there at all. The  food is gross. It looks shabby on the inside, couldnt expect much more from the food. I honestly believe that if a place looks like a dump 99% of the time the food reflects that. If you cant maintain your storefront why would the back be any better. Some owner need a good shake and slap. I don't mean if the decor is tacky or outdated. I mean if the place looks dirty and under kept. This place gave me that vibe. I dont want to see dirt and grit on the counter or walls. NOT DOWN. clean your shit please and thanks. Thats all I have to say."}
{"text":"I had heard a lot about this place and it's goodness of cheap Chinese food, but I was slightly disappointed when I had some takeout. I got the Chicken w/ Black Bean sauce with fried rice noodles for takeout and although I was impressed that it didn't have the 2cm layer of grease most Chinese takeout places have, I found the chicken had very little taste and the sauce was a little bland. Portions were okay, normal for Chinese takeout but all in all I wasn't too impressed."}
{"text":"This place is okay but very inconsistent with its cooking. Some days the food is delicious some days it's either burnt or too salty."}
{"text":"I came here with a friend last night after a movie at Varsity Cinemas. I'm not sure what got me to ask my friend if he wanted to give this place a try since he was Islamic and I wasn't sure if the place would have any dishes that would be agreeable for him.
Maybe it was just the chill temperature outside since we had been walking all the way down from Bloor, and the fact I was thinking of a hot soothing noodle dish. We were actually on the look out for a Japanese or Indian place but the signage outside of Not Just Noodles caught my eye. Surprisingly he said 'yes' so in we went.
The place was fairly busy with customers getting their take-out for the evening, and there is a larger dining area on the second floor. I had the Special Noodle Soup with a Spring Roll and my friend had a some fried noodle dish which he liked. My dish was filling and not heavy and the soup was also warm and flavorful.
This place is a convenient spot to get some reasonable, tasty and filling take-out after a long day at the office."}
{"text":"The Good:

- the batter on the lemon chicken was sooo yummy!! it was crispy and very tasty! and not saturated in lemon
- the fried rice was also very goood and not dry (as I find a lot of fried rice) and there were tons of chicken pieces
- omg, for under $3, their hot and sour soup is super super good!!!
- they also have a special where you get rice, an entree, soup AND a spring roll for $5.00 (or very very close to that amount; can't remember the exact amount) and the food is fresh

The Bad:

- of couse it's not the healthiest
- the front area is realy small so during lunctime it gets a little crowded
- and for 2 days they didn't have my peach bubble tea syrup!
- their tapioca is too rubbery"}
{"text":"What can I say about this place? It's been around forever but it's a staple on this corner of Yonge street.

Not too much space. Highly recommend for takeout. It's daily specials and picture menu board are very handy.

Inexpensive and greasy but it's fast and decent Chinese for the price. 

I'll definitely go again.

I always order the beef ho fun. I really enjoy it. I've had better but this ones fairly good."}
{"text":"Holy dog shit!

This place has the best Chinese food in the city (from my experience).

Where most Chinese places have nasty greasy food that makes your insides cry, this place's food actually tastes like a proper meal.

I almost always get the Cantonese chow mein and the general tso chicken, there is a great assortment of vegetables, meat and shrimp in the chow mein and its always evenly cooked, delicious and consistent.

The general tso chicken always has a delicious sauce that doesn't taste like ketchup or come in excess, the chicken has a nice layer of batter but it still retains its full meaty flavor. It's perfect, just try it.

It seems these two things are what most people get for take out, and probably the best things to order here.

I've had other chicken that they do, the vegetable plate and the phad thai and its all delicious but their specialty is really the Cantonese chow mein and the general tso chicken.

1 serving of the chow mein and the chicken feeds three people. You get really good quality and value for your dollar here. My favorite Chinese place and the only one I trust.

This was also where I had my first date, as a wee 14 year old. I thought it went great but she never talked to me again. : ("}
{"text":"Surprisingly solid *CANTONESE* take-out/cafeteria that's open late -- in a city full of shitty Chinese take-out options

I stressed Cantonese because that's actually what the staff speak here to each other.  And why is this important?  Well -- you know that deliciously greasy and starchy Chinese food that Westerners have come to love?  We invented that shit.

The chefs here are very consistent and really cook with 'wok hei' ('breath of the wok').  Sometimes, I make the mistake of ordering a Cantonese classic from the wrong place and I end up with limp-dicked soggy noodles like a schnook.

There's an upstairs dining area as well, but most of the patrons grab their food to go. And the place is surprisingly clean and I don't feel that usual grease sheen on floor of cheap Chinese joints.

Also, with the open kitchen - you can see the chefs ply their craft.  The sizzle of the woks, the clanging of the 'wok chans', the occasional flames, and that unmistakable smell of searing grease -- it smells like victory.  Combined with the Cantonese chatter from the staff -- this really takes me back to my childhood (I grew up in the back of a Cantonese restaurant -- I'm surprised that I didn't come up with more oil burns).

I usually come by and grab classic dried-fried beef ho fun with soy (pretty much the ideal dish post-drinking to settle that stomach) - and it's a solid example here.  The sweet and sour pork is passable.  They also bubble tea -- but would recommend sticking with the Cantonese classics here."}
{"text":"(This will be part of my \"Bubble Tea on Yonge Street\" list, so I don't judge anything else here)

This is probably the cheapest bubble tea you will find on Yonge and they even offer some fresh fruit choices (though obviously just a few, considering that it is not a tea-only shop and cheap prices). Quality of the tea is alright if one is to consider the price actually pretty good.

There are downsides though that stopped me from going ever going there again. If you are a fan of tapioca, better call ahead whether they still have some because chances that they're out of bubbles seems to be 50/50.
And when I once was fed up with these chances, had already paid (at which point I got wrong change but I did not bother to complain because it was just a couple of cents) and asked for my money back, they didn't return the proper amount.

Still, even though they lost me as a customer because of these things, I suppose overall it's still an alright choice for bubble tea - as long as you don't expect actual bubbles ;)"}
{"text":"My to go place when i miss eating Chinese food and the people are so nice there too :)"}
{"text":"Doesn't look like much from the outside and the impression doesn't change once inside.  But, I was there for takeout Chinese so ambience wasn't important (thank god.  Upper floor dining room may be nicer though). Whenever I try a new place I always try the Singapore Noodles.  If its not done good, I don't care about other dishes as I won't be back. Lucky for me this will be my go to local for last minute takeout.  The portion size was huge for $7.95 and a very good taste.  They didn't scrimp on the shrimp which is rare.  
Service was great.  The counterperson recognized I needed help and handed me a take out menu.  So I stopped looking at the well lit but a little visually disorganized menu board and took in an expansive menu of the typical and not so.
Looking forward to the next time!"}
{"text":"Okay fine, I tried the noodles, and the chow mein is actually really good. SO i will begrudgingly change my opinion of not just noodles. Like some other people have posted, the name of this restaurant is an oxymoron, The noodles here make up 100% of what IS good! Don't be fooled by this restaurants ironic name"}
{"text":"This place is unassuming and messy but also delicious. I really enjoy the 6.50 lunch specials that come with an eggroll, rice, soup and a main. I have also ordered the noodles and the size was very large, enough to share. I have also gone here for dinner with a group of people and ate in the upstairs. Everything is good, prices slightly higher than for similar quality in Chinatown but it's great for the location and the food."}
{"text":"This restaurant has a scenic 2nd floor with nice lighting, so I highly recommend eating upstairs! The menus are well labeled and detailed. I went here with a friend and had one of the best Hong Kong-style dishes.

I recommend with a group of 4 for maximum atmosphere!"}
{"text":"The food is full of flavor, good portions,  affordable and great service, however....  The only down side I can think of is that its located in a sketchy side on town."}
{"text":"I go to this place a lot for good Chinese food for cheap, great when your in a rush and in the area! I don't always have the time to go all the way to china town to get good Chinese food and so not just noodles does the trick $5.60 for either fried noodles or rice and your choice of meet on the hot table they Also have a menu online and with a little planning you can call ahead order whatever you want off the menu they'll make it fresh and have it ready when you get there! The staff isn't too friendly but honestly I don't really care all that I care about is that the food is good for a fair price.

I don't think I could pick my favourite dish from here it's all good and again a good price flavoured well and the portions are huge and extremely fresh they definitely make it to order!"}
{"text":"Good place to get a cheap bite to eat. Braised beef noodles are good"}
{"text":"Once a weekly staple, Not Just Noodles has lost it! Last Friday night we got: burnt fried rice, over cooked general tao chicken and lemon chicken sans lemon sauce. One mistake, ok. Two, everyone has a bad day. Three, no way, no going back!!!"}
{"text":"Why 3-4 times a week? Because I'm lazy. And that's why Not Just Noodles is great. It's cheap, tasty, and quick. The lunch specials are simple and good too. Just like they say, they're not \"just\" noodles. I recommend this place for quick, lazy, simple, Chinese food. You've worked hard all week. Why not 5 star? well, it's not amazing. It's kinda quick and dirty and you feel a little bad about yourself, but it's ... so good. Why not 4? I've discovered Hong Shing. omg. go check that place out"}
{"text":"Cheap eats with a surprisingly tasty fare. Absolutely a must try here is the Cantonese chow mein, sweet and sour pork  (yummy)!!!"}
{"text":"*Disclaimer: I'm writing the review based on delivery, not in-restaurant experiences*

The menu for this place is *very* extensive and covers a large array of Chinese items. Since I don't actually remember seeing any of this in China, it's most certainly Western-Chinese.

As with any restaurant with a large amount of items, the quality of food tends to go down with each extra item added. And with over 200 items available, you won't exactly be eating Michelin level food.

That being said, for the price and for basic Western-Chinese food, it will definitely hit the spot. It's the perfect amount of grease and flavor, and would probably be best for university students trying to kill that hangover. The delivery speed was reasonable and the food was hot. So keep your expectations basic and you'll be satisfied."}
{"text":"I really like this place.  The staff isn't fantastic and they are rude sometimes but the food is very good, and decently priced.  I come here to get lunch once every 2 weeks.  

It's not the best chinese food i the city but its up there."}
{"text":"Wow, how this place has changed - for the worse. Had been coming here for years, and always asked for no onions. The staff was professional and respected my request. And although the staff is different now, I was trusting. Got home to good full of onions and giant pieces of nasty raw green pepper. Once I removed the onions and peppers, I had 1/2 of the container left. Then I took a bite, and only tasted salt. So I spit it out and trashed it all. Nasty!! Avoid this place. Many other options in the area."}
{"text":"I have walked past this place a billion times and finally stopped in the other day. Now I have a \"go-to\" chinese food place! Everything I've ordered has been good. The portions are a good size and I always have leftovers. Service is quick and friendly. I haven't dined in and the dining room seems a little.. well good for a quick meal. Overall, it's cheap, quick, and delicious.. just the way I like it! :)"}
{"text":"Don't let the name fool you. This place is all about the noodles. Specifically the Singapore noodles aka vermiccelli and the Shanghai Noodles. Can't go wrong with either and both can be done as vegetarian."}
{"text":"Darn right it's \"Not Just Noodles\". 

I was a regular for their lunch special until I had the misfortune of ordering their noodle soup. It wasn't just noodles. It had:
-broth
-bbq pork
-bok choi
-won tons
-a big ol'  dead fly. 

...you can guess which ingredient led to this review. 

I haven't been back since."}
{"text":"Great prices excellent Chinese food, extensive menu with all Chinese basics. Great taro bubble tea for $3.50!"}
{"text":"I went at around midnight yet there were still people coming in to get food. I ordered corn with chicken on rice and got it pretty fast. It tasted exactly what I expected which was decent. The server wasn't extremely friendly but definitely made sure we had everything. For such a cheap eat at this time of the night it's quite a good place. The decor isn't anything too fancy but you pay for what you get. Definitely will be coming back here when I'm in the area craving for late night food!"}
{"text":"Good reasonable prices and most of the food is good or very good.  I might give them 5 stars if I didn't get food poisoning after eating here in 2012.

But after staying away for a while, I'm back because of the terrible prices of some other places for poor food.  This place is a good deal for what you get."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place out last weekend.  It's in our area and seemed to have decent reviews. 

Place feels like a hole in the wall on the corner of Yonge and Wellesley, but we did take out so can't comment on the dining space.

Food is a great price and pretty tasty, with decent size portions. 

Weekly lunch specials are a great option for a quick lunch.  

Did the specials today and was very happy with the meal.   

Will definitely return."}
{"text":"This place is not fancy.  Great for Chinese take-out or very casual eat in.  The seating area is clean but very basic.  The kitchen is right behind the cashier, you order and a very nice Asian lady yells your order to Chinese cooks.  Not sure this food is authentic from Being, but their employees are.  

They also serve Vietnamese and Thai.  I'm so white it's all Chinese to me and it's really good.  When I want fast Chinese take-out this place is it:  good food, fast, and reasonable.  Try the Kung Po Chicken or their big chicken balls or crispy General Tso."}
{"text":"I've lived in this area since the summer of 2011 and I walk by this place almost everyday. Most places like this on Yonge street are complete dives -- well, I guess this one is too -- but a charming dive! I didn't go inside until a few weeks ago when I had a craving for chinese food. I'm glad I did!  It's so close to my apartment and now it will become my regular chinese food joint. 

It's cheap, decent, and close! 

I'm a fan."}
{"text":"You would think finding a dependable Chinese restaurant would be easy. It's not! I used to work by here and LOVE their lunch specials. Plus they are super speedy. Yummy food and reasonable prices... Sometimes I get off at Wellesley just to pick up grub from here on the way home even if it's out of my way. Mmmmm!"}
{"text":"This is a conveneient spot if you are in the area. Not aware of any casual Chinese resto around the Yonge/Wellesley intersection at all other than this one. 

Ordered a \"Beef with Vegetables\" (around $11) for take-out.

Placed in circular aluminum container (glad it wasnt plastic container as that can leech plastic residue into hot food, so that was a minor plus).

Problem is value here: Some of the vegetables were obviously from frozen! (tiny corn pieces, what seemed like crispy white radish chopped perfectly, dont recall if any carrots) and broccoli and bok choy which seemed not frozen (but broccoli might have been). 

The container was packed fully, but
The meat was just enough to cover the top of the  vegetables in the aluminum container without overlapping (maybe 8-10 pieces?).

For the price, I dont want a single vegetable from frozen, which is blasphemy.

If you can, go to Buddha's Vegetarian on Dundas West (east of Bathurst)  for greater value (similar price but 3  times the food and no frozen veggies).

This place is great for people watching (especially during rush hours), and is also doubly convenient for it's late closings."}
