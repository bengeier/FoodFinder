{"text":"I have raved to everyone about the calzones here. They are simply to die for. I go there whenever I'm in town specifically for the calzones. As other food is concerned, I have not been disappointed yet. For the best experience, I recommend sitting at the bar connected to the restaurant and ordering from there. Best place to relax with friends, enjoy a drink, while your taste buds explode and your waist line grows."}
{"text":"Currently going on two and a half hours of waiting for my delivery. We've called twice. Each time it's, \"oh it's five minutes away!\" We live two minutes away from the place. Not once have they apologized or offered to comp any part of the meal during either phone call.   The customer service is always terrible (except for the delivery driver - love him!) and the only reason we've dealt with it is because the food is so good. Not bothering anymore.  *Update: At the three hour mark they call and ask if we still want our food. Umm no! They never put a delivery ticket on it. Fine - mistakes happen. But nobody noticed an order that didn't move for three hours or bothered to check the finished orders either time we called?    Never once did they apologize."}
{"text":"This guy at the front counter is the biggest loser. Just a nasty person. Don't eat here ever"}
{"text":"Really great pizza. I had the white sauce vegetarian and it doesn't get much better. We sat in the restaurant area, but the bar area looked good. I highly recommend the pizza and a side salad."}
{"text":"Looked it up on Yelp and was not let down. Excellent Pizza and service. The restaurant and bar are a great place to hang out. Nothing fancy so don't expect the traditional Italian restaurant just great food!!!"}
{"text":"Went there on a chance at lunch one day at work and tried the meatball sub. It was excellent. Will come back again."}
{"text":"Nice place. We went here before a concert at Nautica. I was relieved to find out that the restaurant has a bar attached. I had garlic bread and a veggie calzone. Both were very good and filling and at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"Homemade & delicious! The owner Lou is an old school Italian man. Takes pride in his restaurant. Spaghetti & meatballs are my favorite. Sauce is delicious. You must try his home made Italian dressing. It is to die for. He sells it in a mason jar. I always have some in my refrigerator. This delicious restaurant also delivers. This time of year I have food from here delivered once a week."}
{"text":"The Pizza is excellent! The italian house dressing is the best! The salad is your typical  Italian ice burg lettuce salad but that dressing... wow!  They sell it by mason jar. BYOMJ.  Eric the Delivery dude is hands down the best in Cleveland we get the biggest kick out of him.  Pizza is always hot and delivered with a smile.  Love this place."}
{"text":"I was here last Friday and was very pleased to find the pizza was very tasty and fresh. C-Town Special Rocks! Will be back again and soon! Best pizza near Tremont blows Edisons away!"}
{"text":"Amaze balls. They were so patient with me,  answered all my menu questions, and the wings were everything.  The pizza was good, not spectacular,  but good. Their burgers on the otherhand, again i say amaze balls. They have definitely found themselves a repeat customer."}
{"text":"This place is convenient for me, and that's about the high point. The owner although friendly seems always distracted and less than involved. On multiple visits I've had pizza and sandwiches with everything being marginal at best.. Edible, but nothing to yell from the mountain. Fine place to stop circumstantially, but don't go out if your way."}
{"text":"Just left Sainatos food was very good and very reasonably priced. Loved the sauce. Service was very good. Owners very gracious and friendly. Will definitely be going back. The chicken Parmesan sandwich was delicious my husband had the deluxe calzone and loved every bite."}
{"text":"We've ordered from them in the past and it was always good.  Expensive, but good.  Tonight was a whole different story.  The guy who answered the phone was confused, sort of like he was a customer and heard the phone ringing so he grabbed it.  The next guy got our address wrong 3 times (there's only 4 numbers in it).    Food gets here and, well, it just wasn't good.  We ordered extra cheese on our pizza and got about 1/2 as much as normal.  We ordered wedding soup.  I have no idea what it was that we got, but it was gross.  It was like some canned chicken broth, little pasta, 3 tiny meatballs, weird green stems and scrambled eggs.  Basically yellow swill with green stems floating in it.  BLECH!  The pizza that really had no taste was $16.50.  The Giant Eagle throw in the oven pizzas are much better than this was tonight.  I think we'll be crossing Sainatos off of our pizza place list.  $40 is too much to gamble with for pizza."}
{"text":"With a lack of great pizza places (that deliver) in or around Ohio City, we have chosen to order from Sainatos several times. All times were pretty much just like the last.  We ordered a large pepperoni pizza and a side order of Jalapeno poppers. The poppers were horrible. They were obviously frozen and heated up, but not even the good frozen brand. The breading was weak (aka soggy) and they had absolutely NO flavor. So very, very disappointed. That was the first and last time we order those.  The pizza, we have ordered in the past and they were just okay. Not great, but edible.  But this time, it was disgusting. The dough was not fully cooked, it was still very doughy.   So the next day we decided to reheat the pizza using our pizza stone (why we didn't think of this the night before, I don't know, maybe just too tired or too disgusted) anyway the dough crisped up nicely and became not great, but edible, just okay.  The best part of the pizza was the toppings. They put a ton of cheese and pepperonis on it which was at least something, but not enough to keep me coming back.  After this experience I don't think we'll order from here again, we have actually been experiencing with making our own pizzas at home, and so far our worst pizza has been way better than the best they have delivered to us).  Any Ohio City people out there reading this...PLEASE open up an awesome pizza place (that delivers).  We are sooooo desperately missing that here!"}
{"text":"Great pizza. Great Calzones. Pretty good sandwiches. The burgers are rough though. Pretty decent beer selection. Overall a great place to go."}
{"text":"Looking for Trouble? You will find her here. My thick friends Charley, Derek, and Rachel wanted some fatso kibble on a Saturday night. And they got it. The calzones are awesome. The service was fantastic--- our waitress, who was trying to manage a private party, tend bar, and serve the other customers at the restaurant, kept us entertained while apologizing for the situation. Two people had called out on a Saturday night, and she was left to bear that cross.   Honestly, the food was still timely.  Cheesy garlic bread, fried veggies, fried cheese, pizza, calzones of every flavor--- it was all well prepared, delicious, and filling. And cheap!!   This is a well kept secret, tucked away in the Flats, and is a better alternative to any of the chain pizza joints that the Midwest has fallen victim to. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Was visiting a friend and we ordered pizza delivery from here last night. Let me start by saying, I was so close to giving them 5 stars, so lets go with 4 and a half for now.   The guy who answered the phone was a real Italian, great sign. 'How you doin' with the finest New York accent I heard since my last family reunion. So I replied like any other good (half) Italian would... 'how you doin' in my fake Italian accent voice. He was so helpful, told me about all my salad options and their ingredients. He took his time with me, just great customer service all in all.   The pie and salad arrived in exactly 45 minutes. I might pick up next time since my friends apt is so close. That chicken salad with Italian dressing looked so big, but we smashed every delicious morsel. Nice leafy greens and quality ingredients, I will order a salad every time.   The cheese pie (medium) was the best. I can't explain it, just trust me and try it for yourself. It's not a thin crust, but definitely a thinner crust. My only complaint, too small. Two girls could have totally shared a large with no leftovers (we had the munchies).   Anyhoo, great experience all in all, delicious!"}
{"text":"Louie makes some of the best pizza in town. I've eaten at their old place back in the old neighborhood for years. I bring my family from Strongsville up to the new location on Columbus often. I've been out in the suburbs for years but still come home to the city for the best food you can find."}
{"text":"I rate this pizza as my #2 fave pizza in Cleveland behind Angelo's in Lakewood.  The sauce, cheese, and crust are good quality ingredients.  Delivery is fast and efficient, and service at the restaurant is good.  I just wish the owner would build a stronger presence for this place because I don't want to see it go out of business because of its weird location.  We stumbled across Sainato's because we got stuck in traffic in the Flats, and we just happened to notice their sign.  Their calzones are good BUT--twice we have asked for it without mushrooms and they still put mushrooms in it.  Grr..."}
{"text":"Solid pizza. Hand tossed, not thin. Crust was pretty crispy. Sauce wasn't anything special. Best part was the meatballs. Definitely getting the meatball sliders next time."}
{"text":"Honestly I love their pizza.  Its best hot from the oven (what isnt?) so dine in sometime!  The ratio of sauce to the crust is perfect.  Not too thick either, which basically tastes like tomato paste to me, but a nice medium \"body\".  The pizza is pretty spot on for your neighborhood pizza style.  It is not gourmet wood fired, but sometimes that is exactly what you want.  Wings are consistently good too.  I hate jumbo wings.  They always seem under cooked, and taste much different.  You lose out on the perfect blend of sauce to crispy skin to meat.  So their wings are perfect to me.  My only gripe is that the sauce separates, so you get some extremely buttery bites without much hot sauce flavor.   Great full menu of pastas as well.  Was not wowed by the eggplant parm, but ravioli and meatballs are all great at this Mom n Pop shop."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery. Good food but when ordering to go they double charged me as they were having issues taking the order and the guy delivered the food expecting me to pay again. It did end up resolving all payment issue. A little pricey but outside of that the food was delivered in about an hour."}
{"text":"I am a big big fan of a good piece of pizza...this is some real good pizza. Good sauce, awesome crust. Laid back atmosphere to the restaurant. Good service. Overall I am very pleased with this restaurant."}
{"text":"Great food (try the specialty pizzas), great and quick service. My favorite neighborhood pizza place."}
{"text":"We stopped here for one of the ALCS games on a whim and we were pleasantly surprised! The set-up is a bit weird- it seems that Rivergate and Sainatos are the same place as you can access either when you walk in. We sat at the bar at Rivergate and were able to order from the Sainatos menu. I had the meatball sub and my girlfriend ordered a pizza. Overall the food was pretty good! It's not a place I will crave enough to have to go back but it was one of the only places in the area where you could sit at the bar and watch the game. We ended up moving to a table in the bar area when more friends showed up. There was only 2 people working so we had to get up and go to the bar to get more drinks. This never really bothers me (well, besides the 5 minutes you awkwardly wait t see if anyone is going to serve you) but if this isn't your thing you may want to either sit at the bar or find another establishment. Overall we had a good time!  There is also a small patio which is nice for summer days and was seemingly pet friendly."}
{"text":"Pretty good calzones. Real italian here right down to the wise-ass answering the phone. Delivery guy was great, saw my son had a Browns jersey on and started chanting \"Go Browns\" guests in the hotel probably heard him 3 floors down."}
{"text":"Ahead-of-the-curve pizza for the west side of Cleveland.  Definitely a step up from Panini's, Map Room, and the like.  Other dishes are ok, but mostly the thin-crust traditional pizzas are definitely something worth getting for either dinner or a late night snack with friends."}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere here! The food is amazing and truly tastes homemade!! I met the owner once and she was super sweet! I've always received excellent service and the location is amazing for getting downtown, to Ohio City or to Tremont. Love it!"}
{"text":"Great pizza, great atmosphere and location, great service, disappointing pasta. The penne pesto was extremely over cooked and over sauced, albeit the portion size was generous. Bottom line: avoid the pastas and you'll have a great visit."}
{"text":"I am new to the area & have heard great things about Rivergate Tavern...now learning that Santiago's is the take-out/pizza side of the tavern! I couldn't wait to try it out as it's in walking distance from west 25th (it will be once the bridge opens) & it didn't let my team of movers down! It was delicious, cheesy, hot & perfect. We already found our local pizza place!"}
{"text":"The calzones here are awesome! The atmosphere is quaint. Unfortunately there is a waitress that is rude and immature. Her name is Elaine. She is young and ignorant. We have had several bad experiences while dining here due to her. Last evening 5 of us met for dinner. One of our friends has a diabetes service dog (4lbs) which helps manage her insulin pump dependent diabetes. She arrived with her service dog and Elaine rushed over with her arms folded and said she couldn't have the dog in the restaurant. We told her it was a service dog. She demanded paperwork/proof, which is not permitted under the ADA. We explained that she was not allowed to question my friend. She said, \"What if someone gets dog hair in their food...are you going to pay for their dinner?\" She would not back off. We asked to see the owner who understood but made excuses for her behavior. While waiting for the owner, we could hear her loudly talking about us at the bar. We told him we like his place but will probably not be back due to this ignorant waitress! Our waiter, Chuck, was fabulous!"}
{"text":"This is the best for calzones or after work get togethers... bartenders are great !!!!"}
{"text":"Good calzones and pizza.  Their prices are reasonable. Delivery in the downtown area is timely.    We've been getting their food for a couple of years and have never had a problem with the quality of the food or the time it takes for delivery. I would recommend to family and friends."}
{"text":"After reading the reviews on Yelp, I had high hopes for this place.  Too bad it just isn't all that it is cracked up to me.  For starters, the website is less than helpful.  In fact, it doesn't even work.  When someone suggests a restaurant for us to try, I like to look it up online, peruse the menu, look at any pictures to see if I can gain any perspective about the vibe of the place.    Okay - so the restaurant hasn't joined the technology at your fingertips age.  I can live without it.  It's just nice to have.  Having said that, when I first walk into a restaurant, I do expect to feel more welcomed than we did last night.  The waitress was incredibly rude from the time we sat down until the time we left.  When we asked about the drink specials, she appeared clueless, and really just acted as though we had ruined her evening because we came in and sat down as she was trying to take her smoke break out on the patio.  Then we move on to the food.  Sub-par at best.  The food lacked any real flavor and was just distastefully bland.  There really isn't anything else I can say on the food.  It just wasn't great.  I could have made better at home.  As dinner progressed it because very clear that Sainatos was not group friendly.  If you want to meet a group of friends at this place do not even bother!  Go somewhere else.  The one brighter spot of the evening was the bartender, who offered to work with our table on the bill.  Granted, when we realized this place wasn't group friendly we should have started texting everyone to go somewhere else, or said bring your debit card for the ATM or cash.  Still, the bartender saw our table was spending $200 in their near empty establishment and offered to help us out.  As a result of her generosity, a self proclaimed regular patron proceeded to berate and verbally harass members of our table because the bartender was helping us out.  How management could not address this, let alone think it is acceptable is beyond me.    Personally, I can say for sure, I will not be heading back to Sainatos - Ever.  It seems this sentiment was echoed by others members of our table as we left that night as well, which is really too bad.  I will gladly pay a couple more dollars on the average lunch/dinner for a local establishment all day everyday as opposed to going to a chain restaurant.  When I pay that little bit of extra to support the local business, I expect it to be better - not just in quality of food, but experience as well.  I can easily find another local Cleveland pizza/Italian place, where I am betting the food, service, and class of the patronage will be of a higher standard."}
{"text":"Honestly some of my favorite pizza ever! Sauce is perfectly sweet and savory. Cheese to the edges, and perfectly crisp thinner crust.  Sainatos!!"}
{"text":"Great owners, felt very welcome being Steeler fans and from pittsburgh.  Great food and and great time.  Best kept secret in Cleveland.  Stop by and check out for yourself"}
{"text":"Perfect pizza, well prepared. Amazing fetticini alfredo with chicken. My dog is picky with what she eats and most pizza crust she dislikes, however my dog keeps trying to do tricks for more pizza crust and i have no more to give her :("}
{"text":"Being from Chicago, I am always skeptical on pizza places in other cities. That being said, this place is great. The phone staff was very friendly and accommodating. The pizza was delivered to my hotel in the advertised time. The delivery guy was also very friendly and helpful (he brought plates and napkins too!). The pizza was hot and it was really quite tasty. I will say this might not be to everyone's taste. If you like a crispy/cracker crust, this pizza might not be for you. Personally i enjoy the bready/doughy crust so this was right up my alley. The sauce was fantastic, sweet but not overly so, and it had the right amount of cheese. So why 4 stars instead of 5? I ordered the half sheet. It was definitely not as large as i was expecting, especially after i was told that it is larger than a 16\". In my opinion it was about the same size but squished into a square. It was more expensive so it should be larger. Also, while the delivery guy i mentioned before was very cordial, he had not mastered the art of not sliding the pizza. I delivered pizzas for 3 years. It happens. But there are ways to prevent it. If i could give 4.5 stars i would. To any Chicagoan coming through Cleveland, this place is safe."}
{"text":"Was looking for a new place to try and after seeing the ratings and reading the reviews decided to give Sainato's a try. Got a pepperoni pizza and it was delicious! They estimated 45 minutes to an hour for delivery but it was here in about 30. Will definitely be ordering again soon!"}
{"text":"I am absolutely obsessed with Sainatos pizza. I only ever order pepperoni pizza bc I'm not very adventurous and also it's like perfect so I don't feel the need to fix something that ain't broke. My only issue is that the service is kinda slow, so I usually just call ahead at least 20 min prior. Definitely better carry out than delivery or sit in. Next time I'll try some of their pasta and apps, but no promises that I won't just buy another pie and call it a night :)"}
{"text":"Sainato's is a Cleveland Institution.  Best Pizza and Calzones in North America, I'm not kidding! You simply have to go try it.  I met Louie the founder and he told me the family is off the boat from Italy and they grew up working in the Steel Mills.  Very interesting guy to talk to.  In Chicago we would call this place a Tavern as it has a bar with the games on with the restaurant, but its a place families and cops and firemen and politicians and judges and lawyers and even the local billionaires go to because the food is that good and because all feel welcome and comfortable with the place that's been in business almost 50 years!   Good for you Cleveland to have a great place like this"}
{"text":"Best pizza in the Flats! This place has become our family's go-to take-out pizza place since moving to downtown Cleveland in June! This pizza is delicious! \"The Flats\" pizza is a fun twist on pizza if you want something different! We love that owner is usually there when we pick our order up. Very friendly staff. We've never eaten at the restaurant but they have a great patio and arcade area. Make sure you get a cannoli for dessert... I'm Italian and it's just like my papa makes- DELICIOUS!"}
{"text":"I am probably rating Sainatos a bit higher than I should based purely on the quality of the food and service, but they are a dearly beloved hold-out -- an independently owned pizza place that isn't trying too hard and, most importantly, actually delivers! The pizza is good, and arrives hot.  The meatballs are super tasty, especially atop their cheesy garlic bread.  Stay strong, Sainatos!  Never change!"}
{"text":"Rivergate Tavern is a brand new sports bar/pub that has recently opened in the Flats on Columbus Road.  Food service is provided by Sainato's Restaurant next door. In fact, we ordered the pepperoni pizza and it was fabulous! Definitely recommend the pizza! Great and fun atmosphere. TVs over the bar will be sure to have any local game on. Great tip...try the mini-beer shot - totally yummy! It may be mini...but it is definitely NOT beer!!!"}
{"text":"*I feel as if the newly opened Rivergate Tavern is owed 1/2 of my recent Sainatos review. They essentially share the same space. The two places are divided by a half wall and a door. The food comes from Sainatos, but I think the tavern is it's own entity.....  Take the hill down Columbus Road, towards the Cuyahoga River, across the rusted Depression-era lift bridge, adjacent to the Heart Crane Memorial Park, just East of Rivergate Park, on the corner of Columbus and Merwin and you will find Sainatos and the attached Rivergate Tavern. A brick monolith surrounded by a sea of industry that used to be.    Sainatos/Rivergate Tavern has become home to many of us at the summer league rowing session at the nearby Western Reserve Rowing Association. It's a place where firefighters, local townsfolk, and rowers converge. A friendly bar staff, adequate beer selections, HDTV's to catch the Tribe game and a huge menu.   A newly formed connected bar has joined Sainatos called Rivergate Tavern. Inside Saianato's doors and through another set of doors to the right takes you to the bar area known as Rivergate Tavern. The food though comes from the same long standing Sainatos take-out kitchen. I'm pretty sure both the bar and older kitchen area of Sainatos are one in the same, although the bar area looks much newer and more conducive for relaxing and staying for a while than the take-out side of this place. Either way, the food, especially the pizza and wings that come out of this place are legit!   The pizza we ordered was a basic pepperoni and cheese. The pie was sinfully good. Greasy pepperoni slices, cheese that strung as you bit into it and a crust that was, as proclaimed by the bartender, entirely homemade, as evidenced on how good it was. No frozen discs of dough used here. Everything's made on site.   After a long evening of water sport, there are fewer things that complete the night than a cold beer, a good pizza and crispy wings. Sainatos is one of the few gems on this barren, almost eeriely deserted industrial side of town that is sandwiched in between one of the many bends of the Cuyahoga River. A gem worth seeking out even."}
{"text":"Solid pizza, decent beer list and a great patio.  The mushroom appetizers were pretty bland and service was okay, but we were there for the pizza."}
{"text":"Not a bad place.  Really sparce and random clientelle.  BUT, drinks were somewhat stong, bartenders were cool, Greg Hovaround was Djing me 90s hip hop songs and the have a Flavor Flav mural dammit!!  If any of those stars were not to align again..it might drop a star..  To quote the immortal Heavy D \"now that we found love, what are we gonna do with it?\".."}
{"text":"We went here on a date night Friday and while the bar was a little busy, the dining room was not and we got seated right away. Of course we ordered the deep fried mushrooms and they were incredible! We also ordered a deluxe pizza and it was equivalent to the pizza of my childhood (I. E. Trio's in Rocky River, Masters pizza in Lakewood) So delicious!!  We will definitely be coming back to try all the other awesome food!"}
{"text":"solid pizza. We tried a few of the vegetarian options and were not disappointed."}
{"text":"It's been well over 10 years I've eaten here actually I forgot about this hidden little gem,  we were actually going to Margaritaville but they were booked for the rest of the night first I've heard of from a restaurant, then my brother renounced me about this Sainato three was 4 of us.           We were waited on by a gentleman with a beard forgot his name, was he a riot we hooked around with him, he had nice comebacks, some places we've gone we couldn't even them [servers] to smile a bit, he was very attentive to us a group of 8 came in shortly after us that didn't faze him one bit just rolled with the punches.      We ordered 2 large 12 cut pies, meatballs appetizers, garlic bread with cheese, 6 garlic wings & 6 BBQ wings,  1 pepperoni & extra cheese, 1 pepperoni & sausage pies, the meatballs were cut in half [8], you can taste the fresh garlic bits it was cheesy & to die for, both flavors of wings were fresh not those previously pre-fried ones & they're out of this world I had the taste of BBQ lingered for a good while which was a good sauce, garlic wings was garlicky, even though they were nicely sauced they were still crispy, every time I get wings from other places either they're soggy or not enough sauce/seasoning.       Wife had a side salad she said it was one of the best tasting salads she ever had, we bought a 2ltr Pepsi which came out cheaper than buying fountain pop, both my brothers were drinking beers they had beer that Rhett never had before & they really enjoyed them,  they asked the server to pick one out for them they really enjoyed it.       The atmosphere/ambiance was nice, love the exposed brick, not many places have them. We highly recommend this place, if I could give it more stars I would, keep up the great job, we'll be back most definitely real soon..."}
{"text":"Even though it was delivery, it was a very Italian experience. From the person who took my order to the marinated olives I had as an appetizer, you can tell this place has some authenticity. 5 of 5 for being a great delivery option; prompt delivery, hot food, good food, and courteous staff. I hope I get the opportunity to visit in person!   I had the assorted olives as an appetizer, a small side salad w/poppyseed dressing, and the vegetable lasagna for an entree. The salad was a typical garden salad, but was very fresh. The dressing was also very good. My lasagna was awesome. All food arrived hot (salad was cold & crisp), and although I finished up some work and allowed the food to cool down before eating, it was still very good."}
{"text":"I will preface by mentioning that I lived in Little Italy for four years and so I am a spoiled pizza snob.   I have been attempting to find a go to delivery place for awhile now in the downtown area. It has been a struggle to be certain but this place meets my high standards. The pizza is great. It's a nice price with great crust, good seasoning and a sauce that balances the whole pie. I got standard pepperoni and it was delicious. The delivery was timely and it was delivered with a smile. Overall, I enjoyed my experience thoroughly and will definitely order again."}
{"text":"Pizza was awesome with a good crust!! Wasn't that enthralled with the Italian sub. Meatballs Appetizer was ok. I'll definitely be back for the pizza."}
{"text":"I've been here twice. The first time I ordered a pizza, ate in (before a yelp event!) and the pizza was awesome. Tonight, I ordered a calzone. Total 180. I ordered a pepperoni, green pepper and onion calzone. When I got home, I had a sausage, green and red pepper and raw onion calzone. There was hardly any cheese in it so everything just kept falling out. Was told it would be ready in 20 minutes, showed up 40 minutes later and it still wasn't ready. Right now I'm 50/50 on this place... will probably try again at some point in the future, but definitely won't be ordering the calzone again."}
{"text":"Checked this place out after rowing last night. Nice little sports bar hooked on to Sainato's restaurant. Beer was pretty cheap with a pretty good tap selection. A few TVs. Not incredible ambiance. Too new-feeling. (white paint, tile, etc). Service - well the bartender was great and doing everything he possibly could. But it was pretty busy and he didn't have much help. Consequently, it took awhile to get our beers and food. Granted, it was a Tuesday night, but still.   Overall, not too shabby, but nothing to call mom about either. Hopefully they'll sort out their service issues. For now, I prefer Hoopples across the bridge."}
{"text":"Tried to order a delivery  pizza this evening, the owner answered the phone was very rude and argued that my address was not valid.  Finally got him to take my order.   He called me back because he neglected to get my name and apartment number.  As I was spelling my name he kept saying the wrong letters.   I tried to repeat the letters and called me a a**hole.  Needless to say I cancelled that order!  To say something positive I have eaten in the bar and the employees are great, the owner should keep out of the business before he loses all his regular customers!"}
{"text":"First time great atmosphere great calzone cheap beer. We will definitely come back. Walking distance to our new digs. Ok so now I can give you a s second review. We took a couple from out of town for lunch. Food was awesome. Service even better. Haven't tried pizza yet but next stop will include a pizza review. So the Italian sausage sub sandwich was delicious as well as the stuffed pepper soup. Rosemary the owner actually gave me a loaf of bread to take home and try. It is so fresh and delicious we made little sub sandwiches on it and it was perfect. They are going to baking their own bread which makes this place a new favorite. Perfect place for pasta, sandwich's, libations, and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Sainatos is in a great location, and should be a much better venue. Location doesn't cover up for \"just ok\" pizza, terrible acoustics, poor lighting, and bartenders who ignore you. The pizza wasn't horrible. It also wasn't the best that I've ever had. On that alone, I would have given three stars. However, the building's acoustics, along with the volume of music, make it almost impossible to hear your dinner companions speak. There is also a terrible glare that comes in from the windows, so you cannot see your companion's face if you are facing the window. The lights aren't bright enough to compensate, and there don't appear to be shades on the windows. Lastly, my friend and I sat at the bar a full 5 minutes and were never asked if we wanted a drink. We gave up. I don't see myself choosing to return to Sainatos."}
{"text":"As I am not from the area, i'm a little confused with the Sainato's / Rivergate difference..  The food (and from other reviews, I'm guessing it comes for Sainato's) is amazing.  Had the PMS calzone (Pepporoni, Mushroom, Sausage)..definitely equivalant to NYC calzones...although I must admit I rarely have had NYC calzones..  Beer is cheep, service is friendly...just what you want from a bar!  If you're looking for something a bit more lowkey, this is definitely the place to go."}
{"text":"This is a nice pizza/wing/calzone/salad place.  It's open and clean atmosphere make it very welcoming and a pleasant place to go.  It's nice to get out of the Ohio City/Tremont area once in a while and pop down by the Cuyahoga.  I've had great service from all the bartenders here, very friendly and 'real'.    We'll be back for food and drinks and maybe karaoke?"}
{"text":"Sweet Sweet Lou's calzones are the best I have had. Pizza is also very good, as are the pasta dishes. Service is great. Overall value very very good. A much needed establishment in the downtown area where you can sit down and have good food, a few drinks and not spend a fortune. Easy parking too"}
{"text":"Great place. Me and my buddy made it there today for lunch. Walked in and we were the only 2 in there as they just opened but very atentative. They have a very large beer and liquor selection. Didn't have any lunch specials but the food was very good and was served piping hot. Just for a quick note there happy hour is from 4-8."}
{"text":"Love Sainato's authentic Italian pizza and calzones...have been eating them since Louie was in Slavic Village. We really love the sauce, and I'm glad that he is selling jars now."}
{"text":"I didn't want to venture out far for dinner tonight. It was rainy and cold. I know that Matthew M has discerning tastes and I saw his review for Sainato's, so I made the call. The guy on the phone was a grouch. He could use a seminar on good customer service because he sounded pissed off as hell on the phone. I am usually a nice guy, and halfway through the call, I was also getting pissed in reciprocation. Angry energy multiples off the involved parties. He told me 30 minutes. I figured, Friday night, they are probably busy. I arrive at 30 minutes on the dot. It took 40 minutes total. I am glad I had nothing going on tonight. He seemed a little more polite when handing the pizza off. Maybe he had a rough day. My friend also commented on the dude being grumpy. I said \"His pizza better make up for it\". It really did. It is a thinner crust cooked in a pan in a classic deck oven. The sauce was nice and balanced, crust, cheese and peperoni were also good. It was really greasy and I needed to dab some of that up. This is way better than Edison's, Big Guys or anything in a few mile radius. I highly recommend this pizza if you live in Tremont, Ohio City, Downtown or the surrounding area."}
{"text":"My family and I used to love getting pizza from Sainatos, but lately when we order a 16inch pizza it is a 12inch pizza (not to be crazy, but we measured it with a ruler just to confirm it). When I called, the woman initially asked how many slices it had, and since it had 12 slices and was in a 16inch pizza box then that was their 16 inch pizza. So she pretty much was telling me that for instance an 8inch pizza cut into 12 slices is a 16inch pizza, of course after it is put into a 16inch pizza box. We will no longer be getting our pizza from Sainatos and do not recommend it. Edisons is much better and you definitely are getting what you pay for."}
{"text":"We ordered take out from here. Pretty good pizza! I was disappointed with the grilled chicken Caesar salad. It wasn't fresh chicken or grilled. The pizza was good though. I will probably order pizza from here again."}
{"text":"There aren't too many unpretentious and \"normal\" bars in the downtown/OC area.  The Rivergate fills the bill though.  In terms of decor, they've managed to put enough interesting artwork in to mitigate the bland walls and otherwise average atmosphere.  They have three large TVs over the bar and another on the other side.  This turns out to be helpful when you're with a Spartan fan on the Ohio State/Michigan game day!  Thankfully the bartender gave us a TV to watch the Big Ten on...something that on this \"holiday\" some might not have done.    The food is average.  We had the mushrooms (frozen, probably from GFS) and the wings (over-done and average sized).  I probably wouldn't go out of my way for the food, but then again, it's priced well, so hey...maybe I would!    I'm happy to have the mix of \"townie\" and \"rower\" bar in my neighborhood.  Worth checking out!"}
{"text":"Great lunch spot if you're downtown in your car and don't want to pay to park. The Sainato family has been in the restaurant business forever and it shows. Awesome calzones, pizza and pasta!  Very reasonably priced and welcoming. Louie, the owner, will probably be around to say hi and make sure you're well taken care of, just the kind of guy he is. Last but certainly not least try the wedding soup on a cold winter's day, hell even on a hot summer's day, well worth it!"}
{"text":"Incredible Pizza and Calzones! I live in Boston and went to Sainato's in the Flats. What good people and a great place! I cant believe the quality. It is better than any pie or calzone in Boston, hands down. What a gem! Does all of Cleveland know about this place?"}
