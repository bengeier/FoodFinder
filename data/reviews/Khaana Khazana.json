{"text":"Took the parents here for a saturday lunch ( they are closed on sundays). We liked the unique offerings on the menu. Try this place for the thalis. That is something you do not get in standard indian restaurants. We tried the khana khazana special and the gujrati thali. Both were good ( though i do not necessarily know the names of everything i was eating) . We also tried the chole bhature and khasta kachori that were decent. The menu is 100% vegeterian.   The ambience is very nice and traditional. Service was good . Price is also reasonable. Just not sure how much traffic the place gets since the restaurant was quite empty. I may not make the drive from Scottsdale too often but would recommend to those in the area to give it a shot."}
{"text":"I have become a fan of this place. We were here for Christmas dinner and really enjoyed the food. We had the kathiavadi, khana khazana special and rajasthani special thalis. All were great and tasty. The puran poli was to die for. Will definitely be back for it. The sweet n mango  lassi n daal baati were average. But overall we are very satisfied. Hoping the taste and standards stay consistent."}
{"text":"We eat here at least weekly.  Great service and the food is tasty.  I am typically not a vegetarian but I greatly enjoy the flavors here.  If its Indian vegetarian food you are looking for, Khanna is the place!"}
{"text":"One of the best indian restaurants that I've been to lately. Authentic food in true sense and the owners are super friendly. If you ever crave for some authentic thalis or just the flavor of spices, this is the place to go. I would recommend to try it at least once while you are in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Wanted to give 5 star, but after looking at my quantity I decided 3 is more than enough. Issue with Indian Restaurant is they bite more than they can chew, menu is all over the place, which make this place hard to run. Orders take ages to come by, and once they are there, you are so hungry Dish ( quantity ) looks like a joke.   Taste : Good ( May be i was hungry enough) Quality : Ok ( Time will tell, if you ask me today it was \"OK\") Quantity vs Price : I had to put it like this, because both are interrelated for me . $14 for ( Limited Thali ) too much, half way in your food you tend to ask, is it worth have buffet than this ( Particularly i am not a big fan of buffet ). But i am not a fan of ridiculous Pricing. I do spend $20+ in some restaurant and quantity is way less than $14 charged here. But you spend $20 + more on the experience of Dining and not eating . $14 for eating is too much for the quantity you get here.   Order: Katiawadi Thali: $14 Pudina Paneer  : $ 6 ( five pan fried piece)  Kasta Kachori : $5  Total bill : 27.25"}
{"text":"Great food. Loved the biryan and kachori chaat. rest stuf was too hot, but tasty. Maybe they should start asking how hot you want it to be while taking the order. Also seemed a bit disorganized, we were waiting 5-10mins, although there were empty tables. But the food was worth the wait."}
{"text":"Pretty tasty dishes, all vegetarian. Many flavors I had not experienced before. Lots of Indian people dining here, which I took as a very good sign. The staff were helpful in explaining their food and certain ingredients to us. Looking forward to my next meal there."}
{"text":"Great vegetarian food. Very fresh and tasty appetizers - tried the paneer wraps which were simply out of this world. The samosas were great - nice filling, just enough, blended and cooked. The  mint and tamarind sauces on the side were very good.  The  owner Arti is  also the awesome chef who totally accommodated  my request for a good mix for introducing  her great dishes to my non Indian clients in terms of spice and that fear of  the unknown.  Our party of 10 loved  the atmosphere and the food. Loads of parking in the front. Back at least twice a week for my desi khaana fix. Love it."}
{"text":"Really good food! This place opened where the former Cafe Krishna was and opened tonight. I thought the flavors were really good but the execution on some of the dishes could have used work. Service was slow as was to be expected for opening night."}
{"text":"I wonder how you make indian Chinese food adding garam masala!! We ordered chilly paneer, Hakka noodles and Gobi manchurian. Hakka noodles came with garam masala and chilli paneer was in gravy of oil with some peppers. And Gobi manchurian was ok.  Also ordered Gujarati thali - which was ok, veggies were just not good - in Thali I look for good veggie options, rotis were good. Anyways, overall it was disappointing for us."}
{"text":"Yum.  I luv South Indian cuisine.   The only reason 4 stars instead of 5 is that they don't have their liquor license.   This would be the perfect byob place but no can do.   But the food is amazing.   Pretty cheap too.  The combination is huge and multiple people can share.   The combo is also a great way for people to try many different dishes.   There is a Northern Indian combo which is also fantastic.   I make sure to go here everytime I am in Chandler (I often take classes in this area).  It's situated in a plaza which is nothing special but don't let that discourage you from stopping in and there's a little bar in the plaza so you can always stop for a Coctails before or after dinner."}
{"text":"This place sucks!!! The owner is clueless and has no idea what customer service means.  1. While taking order he is talking to others, seating others, and we had to repeat our order 4 times.  2.  45 minutes later he comes to tell us that he forgot to hit the send button on our order.  3. Brought food full of hot peppers for a 4 year old when specifically he requested not to.  This is after 45 minutes.  Bad service, no common curtsy, clue less.  Can't believe owner is this way."}
{"text":"Prakash, the owner, made me feel very special and the food and service was very good. I had the North Indian Special Thalis. I think the whole menu is vegetarian."}
{"text":"The idli sambhar was good. Service is a bit slow but do not mind that if they make the food from scratch. The ambiance has improved since they changed from cafe Krishna."}
{"text":"My husband and I just ate here last night for my birthday. We have had a taste or two of Indian food before but this was going to be our first time really sitting down to eat indian cuisine. We arrived at 9:30pm and the place closes at 10pm so we were worried we might not get the best service but the service was wonderful! We were welcomed and seated and given our menus by a nice young girl.       The prices are great, most of the \"appetizers\" are $5 or less and the entrees are about 14$-12$ but they are enough to feed two with just one. We didn't know how big the servings were so we each had one appetizer and 2 entrees and had to bring the second entree home, which we ate first thing this morning for breakfast we couldn't wait to taste their amazing food again.       The food is hot in temperature and full of fresh flavor, and they ask how spicy you would like the food which is nice because I can't handle very much heat but my husband loves spicy foods. The owner was present and came to speak with us, he is very nice and shared with us that they just opened about a month ago.      I live in Glendale and I do not regret driving to Chandler to visit this place, and we will be coming to eat here whenever possible. You just have to give it a try, you will be happy you did trust me!"}
{"text":"I had lunch twice at this place with in a period of a week . Both times the lunch was amazing. First time I had the Gujarati thali and the second time the kathiawadi special thali. I will surely recommend this place to my friends."}
{"text":"Damn.  They closed.  Note on the door from the landlord.  Too bad. This was one of two go-to Indian restaurants for me in the SE Valley. The other one is Taj.  Support your local Indian restaurant - go out tonight!"}
{"text":"I walked out after being ignored. A friend of mine said the place was good, but he is Indian. Apparently a single white female doesn't rate to even get a glass of water. When I was seated, the host informed me it was a vegetarian restaurant... ohkay... I said \"Fine with me\" and I smiled, he turned on his heel as if it was a huge imposition to seat me. I looked over the menu and waited for quite some time. I closed the menu thinking that might bring the waiter. I was disappointed. I walked out and went to Passage to India where I enjoyed their weekend buffet. If you are a large group you might get some service. I have no ideal how the food is, but if you want to eat, someone does have to serve you first. I recommend going to any of the other dozen Indian restaurants in the area instead."}
{"text":"Tried South Indian thaali. TO be honest it was not upto the quality standards and also service in the restaurant is quite slow."}
{"text":"Poor food quality and taste. We went there once and now we refrain from going there again."}
{"text":"I had dinner with few friends of mine and I was very disappointed overall with  food,  service and mediocre decor. The menu sounded too good to be true!! We each ordered a thali (full dinner plate) and one entree (which they forgot to serve). The food was presented well but was cold, tasteless and tasted like left over's!! The Mango Lassi we had was terrible, just milk and sugar, we complained but the staff did not care or seemed to pay attention. The service was sporadic and slow. The waiters were confused and were not well informed about the menu."}
{"text":"North Indian style for lunch menu. I was full after leaving this place. It came with raw onion, who would eat raw onion?  Its an all vegetarian on the menu."}
{"text":"Suspicious, that's the best word I can use to describe the first time I visited this Indian restaurant. Upon my first visit, I was with my parents, and I thought the food was just TOO fresh tasting. I thought it was a fluke, so I came back two more times. I was absolutely stunned. Coming from a 100% vegetarian Indian home in Southern California, I've sampled Indian cuisine from multiple So. Cal. restaurants, Las Vegas NV, and phx. Never have I enjoyed food ever as fresh as Khaana Khazana!! Their food had the feel of being home cooked, fresh from scratch. Their somosa was the best I've ever had, so good I was confused! I could not believe the filing looked as though it was made by hand, amazing. I always love to order the paneer kabob, it has great flavor and the sauce is amazing, once again, best I've ever had. I was lucky enough to ask to speak with the chef/owner of this exquisite Indian eatery. I was greeted with the most passionate and enthusiastic lady chefs live ever known. She explained that all the food she enjoys serving each day is prepped and served the very same day. She became and chef and opened a restaurant because she loves to cook, and offer people clean, fresh, healthy Indian food. I love the food offered at this place, I love the passion behind the food, 5 stars all around! Can't wait to return."}
{"text":"I enjoyed their Mint paneer kabad, Gujarati Thali and North Indian thali. Their chat chat section is also very good I have visited twice and the quality is 5 of 5. Be aware of spice level it might be on higher side."}
{"text":"This is a very good vegetarian Indian restaurant. Recommend the Southern India platter Not a lot of people I fear for long term viability."}
{"text":"First off, the name has changed so not even sure why this site still shows the old name.   We have visited several times. The food has been very good, especially the cauliflower appetizer and a couple of the vegan dishes. The only reason this place gets three stars is the service. Slow, disjointed and super slow to remove dirty plates from tables. Folks, people have choices, make your service exceptional and you will get 5 stars."}
{"text":"A nice place... but I wouldn't order the south Indian Thali...well I wouldn't have done that in the first place had I known it's a Gujarati owned place.  The problem is that south India is a big region and North Indians tend to be rather ignorant about the variety in the South. The South Indian Thali is not up to the par! The serving size is small and there is nothing to eat with the miniscule rice they served.  Starving.... I started stealing food from friends plate... everything tasted fine... but once again lunch thali portions are too small...  All three stars for the taste and simplicity of the food... they have a great potential... if on they improve their combinations!"}
