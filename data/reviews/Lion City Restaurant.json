{"text":"My SO and I have been trying expand our food horizon and try new cuisines. Inspired by our recent trip to Khao San Road, we ventured over to Lion City for a different South East Asian type of food. We ordered two noodle soups, the laksa and another soup that had two different types of noodles in it  (don't remember the name). I was anticipating bold flavors, but was disappointed. The laksa was a little to coconutty for me, and did not seem to have any other seasonings (save for some satay on the side).  Despite this, I chose to give a 3-star rating because of the service. The servers there are very attentive and friendly. The atmosphere was very warm and welcoming. I think that I would go back just for the atmosphere here."}
{"text":"We loved the food at Lion City, the dishes were small as usual but the taste had been excellent every time we ate there. Three days ago we ordered takeout, we live 15min away and picked up the dishes ourselves. My husband and I had stomach cramps same night and our son had diarrhea. We were very disappointed and we wonder if other folks have had the same experience or we were just unlucky."}
{"text":"A unique restaurant I was able to try out that serves a fusion of Malaysian, Indonesian, Singaporean and Thai cuisine. First impression of the place was a typical family run restaurant which I usually enjoy because it gives you the homey and authentic taste to the food. It's a casual place that serves pretty generous portions for a good price and being a huge fanatic of curry, I didn't hesitate at all to order the Chicken and Goat Curry. Both curries tasted really good since it was made in a typical Malaysian/Singaporean style that had a strong fragrance of coconut and spices. They went well with the Roti Canai which was thin and crispy and the Coconut Rice which should have had a more coconut essence in it so I'd rather recommend the Haianese Chicken rice instead. Their Pad Thai was made more on the traditional side so it was a bit sour but not bad at all. Long story short, food was good but the service was a bit lacking as the main server was an old man (about 75 years old?) so I gotta give him some credit at least for trying..."}
{"text":"Have been eating at this place for the past 17 years shortly after they started their business and still eating there. This tells you how much my family and I love the food there. My husband and I are ex-Singaporeans and can certainly attest that some of the dishes are the closest to Singapore food around Toronto.  Love their Laksa, Hainanese chicken rice, Hor Fun, Char Kway Teow, Mee Pok to name a few.  Makes us feel like we never left home because we always ate out back home anyways.  Typical Singaporean lifestyle, huh!  We eat out 95%, if not 99% of our time here in Canada, so faithfully going back there is not something to be ignored."}
{"text":"Dining room was empty at lunch hour. This significantly lowered my expectation. I ordered hainanese chicken, and i was extremely disappointed. I wondered,\" how can singaporians possibly mess up their signiture dish? It's just like Korean who doesn't know how to make kimchi.\" The chicken was tasteless, looked like they simply defrost the chicken and hand it over. This restaurant is a joke."}
{"text":"Shrimp fried rice was good. Ikan Belachan wrapped in banana Leaf was ok, a little over fried. Vegetarian Pad Thai was too sweet, very un-Singaporean. Fried Tafu was ok, no warning from waiter or in the menu that the sauce had shrimp. service was hopeless, and food came out slowly and not together."}
{"text":"Came here after reading pretty decent reviews here and trusting in Yelp's fine reputation. I must say, I am sadly disappointed with my first Yelp-assisted experience.   Food: I came here to have the char kuay teow and malaysian-style chicken curry (as those are my absolute favs at Restoran Malaysia in Richmond Hill) and I also tried the Popiah (I don't know why I was under the impression that it was similar to Filipino Lumpiang; maybe something I read?.. But not at all!!). I was also so excited to get my bf to try something new and this place failed to make either of us happy. We took most of the food home (as I seriously hate wasting food), but even I couldn't have the leftovers. :( It could be the fact that this place tries to cater to so many nationalities (Singaporean, Malaysian, Thai, etc) that it can't perfect a single one.   The kuay teow had more beansprouts than anything else. The curry wasn't saucy enough and actually had pieces of beef in it! We asked the lady, but she pointed to a chicken piece and said \"see? Chicken\". My bf and I didn't want to argue as she was an older lady and didn't speak the greatest English. Also we're not averse to beef or anything, but this could've been a real issue had we had religious reasons for not eating certain meats. Or allergies. And it was obvious that they threw whatever they had altogether as we got there late and they were wanting to get rid of what they had. It was very inconsiderate though.   Service: Also, I did not like the fact that there was absolutely nothing on our table as far as utensils, napkins, condiments, etc so we had to ask for extra napkins one at a time, a fork for my bf, to have our water refilled and so on and so on.   Also, the older lady that was waiting on our table was VERY noisily clearing the other glass-top tables, which added to the VERY loud conversation that was going on at the family table in the corner.   Thumbs way down. I'd give this place a zero-star rating if I could, but I can't. :("}
{"text":"Hate to do this, as the owners were older couple, very nice people, but I was sooooo dissappointed in this place. I was initially craving Laksa. So I found this place on a google search, and was VERY dissappointed with the Laksa; way too coconutty! In addition I ordered Curry Chicken, spring rolls and Pad thai. The curry chicken had a one inch layer of oil on top - I wish I took a foto of it. It was disgusting The spring rolls were flavorless and had been fried in an oil that was obviously quite old as the spring rolls were served a brown shade of grey. The Pad Thai was ok, but wouldnt order it again.   Very upset, was so excited about having Laksa. My search for the best Laksa in Toronto continues..."}
{"text":"Tried the laksa and satay today. Laksa is good, taste authentic, broth is creamy but with cucumber is a little disappointment.  Satay is a definite NO. Dry and very salty."}
{"text":"Great food and very friendly, helpful service.  We walked in at 7pm on a Saturday and were a bit surprised to be the only ones there, given all the good things we've heard about this place. Within half an hour it was packed and everyone was eyeing other tables' plates to see what they were ordering, either out of inspiration or jealousy (I'm not sure!).  The chicken rendang was amazing, as was the oyster omelette. Very unique and flavourful. Another standout was the fried kingfish in banana leaf. Absolutely delicious. The tea was also very good. By the end of our meal we were stuffed and jealous of all the gorgeous-looking dishes posted on the walls that we hadn't ordered; needless to say we were inspired to come back to check some more of Lion City's menu off our list!"}
{"text":"I use to come to this place when I was a kid and the food back then was memorable! Unfortunately, the authenticity and quality dropped since then. Came by with 5 ppl for a lunch and it was quite empty.  Ordered the Teh Tarik drink one with ice and one hot. The drink is enjoyable and tasty i admit.  Ordered the appetizer for Poh Pia (reminded me of eating vietnamese cold roll) which is not that good. 2nd app was the chicken satay. This was by far the best dish of the bunch we ordered. The chicken was well cooked and flavored but the peanut sauce was not that great.   The mains we ordered: Char Kuay Teow (avg with no spice), Wat Tan Ho (avg as well, but the plate was really big), Spicy Grilled Fish (Skate fish but was deep fried). This skate fish is def frozen that's why its deepfried and dry. Did not taste as good as I remembered when I was young.   Dessert: Ice Kachang- Shaved ice with coconut milk, red bean, palm seeds topped with sugar syrup. (Avg as well)  The bill $75 before tips. I was generous enough to tip well eventhough food was not that good. Won't likely come back again."}
{"text":"As Singaporeans who are living in Toronto for a while, we decided to finally check out Lion City after getting bored of the food around downtown.   We ordered:  Hainanese Chicken Rice - authentic. As good as you'll probably find in a typical Singapore food centre. This cannot be compared against the best chicken rice stalls in Singapore, and it wouldn't be fair either. But for us who have missed eating Singaporean cuisines for a few months, I would consider this good. Definitely not food that we would just \"settle for\".  The accompanying soup was tasty, and we were given all the condiments: black sauce, chili and ginger sauce.  The condiments were alright, although the type of chili sauce isn't the usual chicken rice accompaniment that you'll get in Singapore. But it's better than nothing.  Sambal Kang Kung (water spinach in chilli paste) - Nice, but not spicy as sambal should be... but considering this is Canada, it's understandable why it isn't spicy. Still I wouldn't mind ordering this again.  Carrot Cake - It's okay. I wouldn't say that it's fantastic, but it doesn't bad either.   Homemade Soy Milk - Love it.   Service: There wasn't anybody to welcome us when we got in, so we found ourselves a table. We didn't see many wait staff around so we waited for a while. The elderly gentleman came over later and passed us the order chit. After we decided on our orders, we waited again for someone to come to us, but nobody seemed to notice us. Finally, I went to the counter and passed it to them instead.  It was only about 5 - 10 minutes later that a lady came by to ask if we had already placed our order.  Subsequently the service was a lot better with the food coming in good time.  The lady owner of the restaurant came around and asked if everything was good. She was friendly and made us feel at home. We also noticed that a number of patrons who dined there were regulars as the staff knew them by name.   So far, Lion City has passed our Singapore/Asian authenticity food test, and we will be back to try some more of their other dishes."}
{"text":"Ordered dry Wanton mee, Mee Pok, and Orh luak.  Wanton Mee: Overuse of black pepper. I could only taste black pepper and the over sweetness of their sauce. Noodle used is not suitable for the dish as well, at least not according to how wanton Mee is in Singapore. The wanton however is delicious! I will not order this again  Mee Pok, Again, overuse of black pepper, but the overall taste is slightly better than wanton Mee. It's a good thing they did not forget the black vinegar. I was expecting the stewed shitake mushroom, unfortunately none. I will order this again.  Orh luak, They nailed it. Not the best I eaten but certainly the best in Canada. I just hope they will include the sour chilli sauce that comes with this dish.  Seems like they changed the chef. No longer the mother cooking. Does not taste the same as before."}
{"text":"My daughter loves Hainan rice and this place does it quite well and good value.  The satay portions are a bit small and the actual satay sauce could be better but not bad over all.  The beef curry is tasty!  Could of been a bit thicker."}
{"text":"Place was empty during dinner, bad sign.  Old couple seem to be out of it and in their \"I don't give a shit\" age.  Food came out cold and unsanitary.  Wife and I got sick after the meal we had here."}
{"text":"Service was prompt and courteous.   Ordered the clay pot rice, It was a disappoinment.  Rice was not cooked in the pot but spooned in.  The topping was mostly Chinese sausage.  Did not feel it was a Singapore/Malay dish and $8.00 was too high a price.  Can get better hot pots in normal Chinese restaurants.  Chickn satay was O.K.  The sauce was good but notthing special about the chicken..  Pad Tai was very good.  It was better than most Pad Thai that I have eaten.  The portion was small but I would order it again.  Overall,  the food was a little disappointing because I expected something different.  The price was a little hight for what I got.  If you go, make sure you only order the Singapore/Malay dishes but I probably will try other Malay restaurants before I return here."}
{"text":"Went to this place after a day of trampoline dodgeball (I have another review for that).  This restaurant is located in far right end of the plaza (facing the plaza).  I tried a really simple dish, just fried chicken and egg with rice; I did not know it was fried chicken until it came out.  My friends had the green curry beef and yellow curry beef and both of those dishes were pretty good.  My own dish was 'meh' but it wasn't their specialty so I can't really complain.  The hainan chicken with rice looked pretty good and is apparently their specialty.    I'd recommend this place if you're craving for curry but don't expect the restaurant to wow you in any way.  There's not much I can say about the atmosphere nor the decor of this restaurant.  It's very typical of a Chinese restaurant.  Cheers."}
{"text":"Read a lot of mixed reviews, so we went in with quite a lot of trepidation....  We ordered chicken curry, 2 roti chanai, eggplant and hainanese chicken.    The hainanese chicken was quite good, but I felt the portion was small (I think 5 pieces of chicken).  Chicken curry was deep and intense, roti chanai forgettable.  The eggplant ended up being the star with some fermented shrimp paste that made the dish really sing.    Note to the owner-smile more.  He sat behind the cash desk with a frown the entire time....I felt guilty eating in front of him.  Wanted to invite him over and have a Tiger beer on us."}
{"text":"I'm very conflicted about this review. The food was delicious, we had beef rendang, fried noodle dish, and the roll everyone here recommended. We also spent some time in Malaysia, Singapore & Indonesia, and have to say the food is pretty authentic too. The service wasn't great - it was too slow. There wasn't a dedicated waiter, so we had to go up to the counter to try to get someone's attention. But that's not even the problem....  Near the end of our meal, I noticed that some staff members came out to one of the dining tables and started chopping carrots. Not a super common thing to see, but also not the end of the world. We asked if we could pay, and a guy who was just cutting carrots processed our payment and went back to carrot cutting... without gloves or washing hands .... :|"}
{"text":"Went there with a party of 10. Fortunately we had a reservation as the line up was out the door. The service was beyond slow.  Took 15 mins for the waiter to show up and that's after we went up to the counter to get him.  The food is fantastic.  All the dishes were done really well but because they are so slow due to being understaffed only 1 dish comes out at a time.  Have to wait about 10 mins for the next item.  They need to hire another waiter"}
{"text":"Best singaporean/indonesian food in mississauga. This place is a hidden gem. The mango salad was amazing. This is the only thing you need to eat and call it a day.   The lemak has an awesome crab curry taste with perfect amount of spice. We also had a sweet sauce beef noodle dish...cant remeber the name but it was very tasty and unique.  Never had singaporean food before but definately a place you will return to."}
{"text":"Nothing to be stylish or fancy about this place.  BUT, this retro nostalgic atmosphere, elderly gentleman and lady working in the place made me feel homey. So, I keep coming back this place once I tried the Chicken rice..... I LOVED it, especially loved the idea to eat it with the ginger sauce.  Also, I highly recommend the Laksa, too.  The soup is spicy, creamy, and filling! Must try!"}
{"text":"I came to this restaurant before a while back and had a great time eating Singaporean and Malaysian food. A few weeks ago, I had lunch with my father at Lion City Restaurant again. We both ordered the Hainanese Chicken Rice for lunch.   My dad did not think the Hainanese Chicken Rice was anything spectacular. The rice was not as flavourful as he would have liked. The chicken was too soft and tender to his liking. The only thing he enjoyed was the chicken soup that came with the dish.   As for me, I thought the dish was alright. It was not as great as I remembered it to be. My first time trying Hainanese Chicken Rice at Lion City was a bit better than my most recent visit with my father.  However, we did enjoy our Durian Coconut dessert. That's super delicious as the strong scent of Durian got mixed with the sweetness of Coconut. I would definitely order the dessert again for my next visit."}
{"text":"Plane food not  sure how they stay open. tastes like Hospital asian food."}
{"text":"Delicious! Loved the Redang beef! And the mango salad is amazing.  Great food!! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Best authentic Malaysian food in Mississauga hands down. Owners run the place (or used to) and food is amazing.   MUST HAVES Hainanese chicken rice Wan Tan Hor fun  Laksa Lemak Blachan Chicken  Nasi Lemak   My family has been coming here for years. Also buy some green-white pandan rice cakes before you leave -$1.50 each!   Love this place."}
{"text":"This is the best Hainanese chicken rice place in the GTA. I live in Scarborough and work in Mississauga and have been ordering from here for 10 years now.   They serve their Hainanese chicken rice with separate sauces (red, soy and garlic ginger). Other places tend to pre-mix the sauces for you which I do not like. You can also ask for extra sauces if needed.  The staff is very friendly and provides utensils if needed for takeout. A little tip, if you pay cash they will omit the TAX. Everyone wins!   I see quite a few people dining in but I usually order for takeout. Their dining facilities is decent. Don't expect too much since this is a small family business so let's be fair.  I have been to different places from Scarborough to Mississauga and their Hainanese chicken rice is still the best!"}
{"text":"Came across this place while driving by. Portions are large, definitely sharable. I ordered the laksa, it was good but felt it needed a bit more punch. My hubby had Penang Laksa, being not a fish lover (didn't notice while ordering), he found it smelling too fishy. Although I devoured it! The mango salad is AMAZING! Highly recommend. Coffee Tarik is a strong coffee which I had with ice. Loved it. Boboh Cha Cha for dessert was delicious (only if you like coconut milk). Ambience is OK. Service was very friendly, attentive and quick. Will be back with family and friends."}
{"text":"Having heard that this place is now under new ownership and freshly renovated, I decided to give it another shot and try its food! Glad I did so, as I was quite pleasantly surprised by the food! My family of four ordered the following:  Hainanese Chicken Rice This dish was the first to be served, and was surprisingly well done! The piping hot rice (you could see all the steam emanating from the inside of the mound) was extremely fragrant, full of chicken oil and broth flavour. My sister, who ordered this dish, said that the red meat was also very tender and smooth. She practically demolished the entire dish single handedly, and enjoyed it very much. Very happy to see that there's now a solid choice for hainanese chicken rice in Mississauga!   Laksa Lemak This dish is extremely rich and very creamy! There's a generous amount of coconut milk underneath a surface of hot oil. The noodles aren't your typical egg noodle and rice vermicelli mix; rather, they resemble lai fun. There are a mixture of toppings including deep fried tofu pockets, fish cake, chicken meat, cucumbers, and a single small shrimp. My mom thoroughly enjoyed this dish and would recommend!  Nasi Lemak My kind father ordered this for himself, as I couldn't choose between trying the mee siam or the nasi lemak. He got the fried chicken wings, which came in three separate pieces. The coconut rice was extremely fragrant, but not heavy by any means! The rice retained its light texture, but was very thoroughly seasoned so that you could taste the sweetness of the coconut flavour with every bite. He also liked the spicy sambal, and almost cleared his plate with that sauce.  Mee Siam This was my first time trying this dish, and I was quite taken aback to see it served in a flat, slightly curved plate. The rice vermicelli was a little cut up, and was immersed in this bright red tangy tamarind broth (which tasted a little like tomato broth). A boiled egg was artistically cut up and laid across the rim, and there were some short pieces of chives and cut up tofu pockets. Two single shrimps lay in the broth (I've noticed that they're quite frugal with their shrimp portions...). Overall, the dish was good, but I found it a little one dimensional as all the flavour came predominantly from the tanginess of the tamarind.  Lion City serves up some decent options, and I can't wait to try more of their menu the next time we come! The menu explicitly referenced its wok hei, even going so far as to warn of the magnitude of its wok hei and say that for those who prefer less wok hei to tell them so. I found that hilarious, and you bet that I'll order one of their stir fries next time!"}
{"text":"Returned for dinner to intro my gf to this place, what's changed?! Out of Diet Coke, chicken by 6:30pm and bringing a dish to the the table to sub for another instead of asking ahead?  Food was ok. Still seems to command a loyal following, but unlikely to repeat anytime soon. Some have mentioned there is a change in management, so let's see if they get their act together on time."}
{"text":"I'm seeing a trend here, crappy places don't get reviews. I think they deserve a writeup just like any other place and I feel bad about that so here goes... :)  First of all this is a Singaporean restaurant, or at least markets itself as such, albeit not a very good one. The food here was disappointing to say the least. I had the chicken rice which is probably SGs national dish and my wife had the mee pok (pork with noodle dish)  Chicken rice peeves: -lacked the condiments I'm used to like the dark sweet soy sauce, ginger, etc. (had the chili though, you have to!) -servings not big enough therefore not worth it -most importantly the chicken had a lot of bones in it. I'm used to boneless chicken rice which I've probably had 98% of the time everywhere else.  Mee pok peeves: -lacked the dark vinegar it usually goes with. We had to ask for vinegar but all they had was just regular vinegar. -no little deep fried chunks of fat that it should be topped with that really brings the dish to another level -sauce used for the noodles wasn't that good to begin with.  Overall, lazy preparation, not good enough cooking, and not enough dedication to sticking to what makes SG dishes one of my favorite cuisines."}
{"text":"This place is staying 5 star in my books, I don't think that I could eat here and ever give it a poor rating. Each time I've been I've had something different and loved it just as much as previous dishes. I was working in Mississauga last Thursday and got a last minute invite from resident expert David L to come meet him and his wife here for lunch.  Here is the run down:  1) Chicken Briani Rice (Chicken Rendang with Briani) $8.50 - This was incredible, the rice was moist and the Rendang was flavoured perfectly with a good bit of kick!  2) Lontong (curry veg with rice) $7.95 - Compressed rice cake in spicy coconut & shrimp gravy with vegetables. loved this dish I'd recommend this as well. Great flavour!  3) Fried Hokien Mee - This noodle dish was fab!  4) Sago Gula Melaka $4.00 (dessert)  - Loved this as well, was the first Asian dessert that I actually wish I could have had seconds and thirds.  Like I said - I can't find enough good things to say about this place. If you are craving authentic Singaporean food give this place a spin. Locals know this to be legit and I gotta back them up on it now that Yelp tells me I'm a regular :)"}
{"text":"I am a regular here; I usually get the won ton mee soup with extra chili on the side. I also get the Mee Pok or Hee Mee soup sometimes. The BBQ stingray in banana leafs is also good, as is the mango salad.    Singaporean food is distinct from Chinese food, and in some ways even better as it is a fusion of different cultures.   This is one of the better Singaporean food restaurant in the Toronto area.  I also use this place for my dates as most of the ladies have never had Singaporean food, and they all like it once they have tried it, and it is also light on the wallet. Keeps them interested, stimulated, guessing what I will do next,etc. This place is excellent for that."}
{"text":"Angela sums up the problem with most people - while she admitted the food was really good, she basically docked 1 star because the owner was sitting and not smiling. Relax.  On the topic at hand - the two of us (combined bodyweight of 260 lb) had 3 entrees + a starter + 2 rotis. No food was left at the end. It's damn delicious, the staff were friendly, and we had a 5 minute convo with the owner.  I would definitely recommend checking this place out."}
{"text":"Wow, one of the best meals I've had in a long time... And I dine out quite a lot! We ordered satay skewers, grilled fish in banana leaf, belacan kangkong, oyster omelette and rice for four people. After tax, it was about $66, which was a great deal considering how stuffed we were by the end!  The grilled fish was the highlight for me; it's the only dish that reminded me of my time living in Singapore. The sauce was spicy and very flavourful. Ask for extra sambal if you want even more spice! Everything else was very delicious and I'd be happy ordering it over and over again, but they do have an extensive menu which I would love to try. Chili Crab is also available if ordered 24hrs in advance. Give it a try especially if you're looking for Southeast Asian food!"}
{"text":"I came here for dinner recently and decided to update my review since it was over 2 years old and I felt the food game stepped up since then. We were a group of 5 (4 adults and a kiddo) and we ordered: - 2 laksas - char keuy teow - green curry - roti  The food was amazing. The laksa had the most flavourful soup and the perfect spice level, way better than the first time around. The green curry was fragrant and the sauce was beautifully blended to the right thickness with the right spices - perfect for our roti. It came with a good variety of vegetables, so I was very happy with the option.   The keuy teow was also great, with the right amount of char (wok hei) and was great for my little one. We were going to order the pad thai but the colour of it in photos just didn't look appetizing.   Service was good, they kept an eye on our waters and teas, but it wasn't anything to write home about. They were fairly busy at dinner time so I understand that they might have a lot of tables to look out for.  Would I come here again? Yes - it's a good option when you want something other than the Chinese food the plaza has to offer :)"}
{"text":"Got the satay, mango salad, goat rendang, pad thai, and chicken panang curry. Everything was excellent! Will def be back!"}
{"text":"Don't come!! I ordered a chicken curry yesterday to go, which is 11.95 before tax. With that price I assume it would come with rice(and which curry doesn't?!).   However, when i opened it today, there's no rice whatsoever. I called in the store and ask, guess what she said, in the beginning she said oh, its not me, I'm not in the kitchen yesterday. But then, she said the curry doesn't come with rice whether you eat in or take out?! I was shocked, and I asked her, with that price you don't give rice? So you expect me to eat it raw? And she just kept repeating oh it doesn't come with rice.   Anyhow, lesson learned, I will never eat at this place again!!!"}
{"text":"Sadly, this restaurant has declined. It was our go-to restaurant for Malaysian. But the group gave it the thumbs down.    We ordered the Wan Tan Noodle -- pretty good. Satay (chicken and beef) was not well marinated, kind of tasteless. The Laksa was OK. The Roti Canai was not the handmade/flip-in-the air but the frozen kind. It was tasty but I still prefer the handmade ones. The beef curry was really tough and chewy -- I am OK with chewy but this was really chewy. The taste was good though. We also ordered Chendol which was OK."}
{"text":"Food look good smelled good but the guy in the front desk need to learn how to handle pressure called several time the phone did not go throw showed up to order and politely advice him of the phone not working ... he did not give a damn about it but the food was worth the ignorance lol"}
{"text":"Cute hidden gem -  Ive only ordered one dish the few times Ive gone here, so I cant say much for all of their other dishes. The hainese chicken and rice is BOMB!"}
{"text":"The newly renovated Lion City is bright, clean and modern!  We ordered Ngor Hiang, Wah Tan Hor Fun, Curry Mutton (goat on menu), Bobo Chacha and Ice Milo.  Every dish was done in authentic Singaporean style.  Definitely the place to go for SG food fix!!!"}
{"text":"We love Malaysian food, and as we don't have it in S Florida, I usually Yelp for them whenever I travel.    I actually have high hopes for this place, there are newspaper clippings in the restaurant about how good this place is and how long it has been around.  However, the food is just okay, not great. We tried the Hainanese Chicken Rice, Bak kut teh, Char Keuy Teow, sambal shrimp.  If you have not experienced SE Asian food before, this is a good place to start, they do have an extensive menu.  But for people who are used to this cuisine, and have others to compare to, this place may be disappointing, and not very satisfying unless you are crazy home sick for the food.    Worse, as others said, service is ridiculously slow even if there are just a few tables of customers.  Also, on our way out, we saw a plate arranged with some coconut and pandam dessert cakes.  I wanted to buy some but when I reached for them I got yelled out.  Okay, maybe I should asked first, but if you put the plate out on the table, it's not unreasonable for me to assume it's there for sale."}
{"text":"Hi, So I googled seafood in Mississauga and we just went here.  It is in a oriental plaza so may take some time to find.  It is a very small, hole in the wall type of place. The chairs are so not comfy. It looks like the usual small dining spot.  Anyways how I have been tainted with the wrong type of ketchup flavoured pad Thai all these years.  We ordered the  shrimp wonton - delicious. The pad Thai - authentic, delicious, huge portion. This was great thus far.  We craved crab so we ordered the chili crab. OH MAN! It came out after the rest of the food by some noted time, but wow it was a whole entire crab! and a huge one!  The sauce on it was absolutely flavourful and  a sweet chili taste.  It was a hell of a time trying to open the crab, they gave us the utensils necessary but it was too huge. I felt queasy because I had flashbacks to the time I tried to make crab and the grey brain area was in the body of it, so I stopped eating after a while.  Anyways the portions were huge, the food was great. Everything mentioned plus two soft drinks was $55.00. after taxes.   I think back to places like momofuku (i know totally different atmosphere) that offer a large format meal like that for $250 + for 4-6 people. This could have easily fed 4 people. There is value in this restaurant. Their dessert menu isn't anything at all.  I think you have to be well versed in Singaporean, Malay food to be prepared to order something great. Our meal was great and I will come here again. The service was great it was a much old, elder man and a woman who seems to be the famous owner. Very sweet, helpful people."}
{"text":"Lion City is located on Central Parkway West facing an open field at the gate that is more southern further away from Burnhamthorpe.  Lion City has a dining area that's sort of cut down the middle.  While there aren't many large tables, there are a good number of 4 and 2 seat tables.  The table we had was able to fit about 8 comfortably was the largest table in the place (round).  That being said a group is probably the best way to enjoy this place because family style ordering with many different variety of dishes is the way to go.    The extent of my knowledge of Singapore is only what I've seen on a screen like Anthony Bourdain's No Reservations.  I learned that Singaporean cuisine is primarily made of up of dishes and ingredients from neighbors like Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand as well as India.  Thanks to my fellow diners David and Marianne who are both Singapore natives, their knowledge of the food as well as their experience with this particular place make them basically the best possible couple to dine with that I know personally.    Our table consisted of six diners which is an advantage because we can now try many different dishes since there are enough of us to experience a variety while ordering family style.  All the dishes are new to me with the exception of the Hainanese chicken rice dish which is a pretty well known dish.  I had this at at Gourmet Malaysia last year.  Lion City however had the rice in bowls already on the side as the chicken itself is served separately.  One of the true advantages to eating with experienced regulars is that they can explain everything and what goes with what (side sauces or garnishes) or how something is typically eaten right down to what utensils to use.    We started with mango salad and a fried tofu with cucumber and peanut sauce.  Both had peanuts and both were great tasting as starters.  The slices of both mango and cucumber were crisp and fresh and a nice mix of textures whether it was the rich and savory peanut sauce with the tofu or the crunchy peanut topping on the mango salad.  The rest of the dishes just kept on coming.  Beef Randang which is a stewed beef with curry was served with side bowls of steamed rice.  This dish was very tasty and was not overly strong but a milder curry with a very robust flavor.  The meat was in chunks and was slightly oily but had a very tender texture, fall off the bone type of pieces.  Next, the Oh Luak is an omelette with oyster cooked with tapioca topped with basil.  The egg being mixed with the other ingredients had a bit of a crunch texture to it almost like melted and skirted cheese.  Ngoh Hiang was next.  It was a style of fried pork on top of fried noodles.  This pork had a very unusual texture and taste.  Some bits were crunchy while others were soft.  The closest thing I can compare it to is probably Spam.  We however were only half way through the amount of dishes coming our way.  The Hainanese chicken rice which came with a generous serving of cuts of chicken was accompanied with the chicken broth rice in bowls on the side along with all the side servings of sauces and dressing.  The chicken rice experience is just that, it's a dish that although seems quite basic, takes time and care to be done properly for it to appear and tasted to be made the authentic way.    The largest platter was the Wat Tan Hor Fun, flat rice noodles, bok choy, chicken, squid and shrimps.  Almost a soup like consistency, the noodles have that familiar flat rice noodle texture and flavor along with the side of what appear to be serrano peppers, this seafood and noodles dish was my favorite of the evening.    The spiciest dish was Lontong which is a curry soup.  The color is a give away as it's a bright orange oil on yellow broth with bits of cabbage, green beans and tofu.  There's a very different version of rice served in this dish as well that is, they appear to look like chunks of potato but actually they're compressed rice in the shape of cut potatoes.  The texture is unmistakably rice however as well as the taste.  This dish packs a punch so be prepared to get that kick of heat and taste at once.  One of the final dishes we had was Hokkien Mee which is noodles cooked in a dark sauce with the sour taste of tamarind.  It was topped with green onion and tofu.  IMO the sourness of tamarind are an acquired taste.  This dish was very different from the rest.  There was one more dish I didn't get the name of but it too was quite unusual from what you'd find in say Cantonese cuisine.  Overall my experience was top notch not only because I dined with experts of Singaporean cuisine but because there was a wide variety of flavors, textures and tastes from hot to sour to savory we had a true variety from 10 different dishes.  After tax and tip the feast split among 6 diners was barely 25 dollars each.  Lion City serves up a wide variety of flavors of authentic Singaporean and it's also a great value for the money."}
{"text":"Not particularly memorable...we were OK with the food but definitely NOT a cheap eats by any means. The value is just not there. Each dishes seemed to be pretty fairly priced until you see the portions. To be decently full, we ended up having to pay $25 each for 4 people's meal. Fair warning, the food does not appear as photographed. Won't be coming back."}
{"text":"#1. This is an Asian restaurant that is family owned.  The wife is very nice and the husband is actually very nice as well.  He may not smile, but I think he's tired because he's probably been working 12 hours a day/7 days a week for the past 15 years.  He is older and probably in his 60's to 70s.    2.  This is the longest lasting store in this plaza with the same owner, 2nd longest is probably Chiu Chow Man where ownership passed from parents to kids.    3.  Food portion of the review:  Had beef rendang with rice and spiced Indonesian goat soup.  Beef rendang with white rice was good.  Beef was tender and the curry had a slight kick to it with a decent amount of saltiness.  Very good.  Best South East Asian curry I've had.  The goat soup was not bad.  It wasn't too spicy, but it had good flavour.    Overall, I'd visit again.   **Note: I visited before and had the Hainese Chicken Rice, and it was okay, but my mom makes much better."}
{"text":"Was hoping for authentic Singaporean food.  Looked the part, atmosphere, history, management.  Even the food looked like it was bursting with flavours.    Then I ate it.  Totally bland, devoid of flavour.  Even brought half home to try the next day and make sure my taste buds weren't broken.  Same result.    These guys may have had it at some point in the past, but it's long since gone."}
{"text":"This is a small Singaporean restaurant located in a far corner inside a busy Chinese plaza in Mississauga. It's not super popular, but many Singaporean locals and foodies know their way to this homey place. Other than Singaporean dishes, it also serves Indonesian/Malaysian/Thai food.  Kris U. one day asked me what I thought of this restaurant. Seriously I haven't been for a long time and I almost forgot about it. Thanks for reminding me to revisit. LOL.    Anyhow, here's what I ordered on my recent revisit:  Laksa Lemak - $7.95 - I've asked for mild version as I had a bit of throat discomfort. Mistake - while it still had a little kick on the spiciness, I did find it a bit bland as I was hoping for more pronounced flavor in the soup.   Oh Luak (Oyster Omelette) - $12.95 - It was the highlight dish of the night! There were tons of oysters with a really gooey sticky texture. Very tasty. Really loved it!!!  Hainanese Chicken Rice - $7.95 - The chicken, again, as quite bland. Chicken oil rice was alright. I was hoping for a fattier chicken so I could taste the aroma.   Satay (beef and pork) - $7.50 - beef and pork were both quite tender. Peanut sauce was a bit different from what I have tried in other places. Nonetheless it was pretty tasty.  The food on the whole was a bit bland (definitely they used very minimal MSG, which was a good thing). I was hoping for more flavors. May be it's an off night?  Service was warm and friendly. Price was very reasonable. It's a small neighborhood restaurant, so there's not much fancy decor to write about. If you live in this area, I would definitely suggest to come and try. :)  3.5 stars"}
{"text":"Its a small restaurant that hidden very close on the side of the plaza. Plain décor. The food tasted good. Got myself some laksa lemak looks very similar to Vietnamese broth dishes, but instead they used lots of coconut milk. Very tasty and flavorful. I tried the red curry chicken with their roti bread to dip with. Thumb up for it. And also, tried the sago gula maleka dessert. Which was two giant tumbs down.  Service was good. There were four servers for a small place."}
{"text":"I was fortunate to try the food before the change of owners. It's the one and only Singaporean Restaurant that is Singaporean owned as opposed to being a Singaporean Malaysian restaurant in Canada, so I was told. What the heck, it's the food that counts. Having just come back from Singapore, the food was passable.  However here, beggars can't be choosy, so in that aspect, it's pretty good.  Roti Prata- the roti does not resemble roti. Pass on this.  Chicken rice-the soup was good, and nice it came with the chili sauce, black sauce and ginger sauce. Most of the time, it only comes with ginger sauce. Chicken was ok. My second favorite dish. Lontong- It was the best dish, perfectly balanced sauce with the right amount of veggies and rice cake. If I had to order only one dish, this would be it.   Fried rice noodles- ok. Only topping was green onion, and grease.   Overall, good and cheap food. Service was fast and efficient."}
{"text":"Lion City  First of all, let me say I'm no Singaporean/Indo/Malay food expert.   I have been to Singapore once and have tried most of the Indo/Malay restaurants in the city that I know about. For me, this restaurant serves food the most similar to what I ate in Singapore. My Indonesian friend recommended this place to me and I've been loving it since.  It's true that the spices here are milder than what I had there, yes, I do wish for stronger spices here. But after so many trials of other supposedly authentic places in the city (Restauran comes to mind, which to me is just Chinese food trying to be Indo/Malay), this place just gets better and better, and more authentic in my mind it seems.  Some of the dishes I have tried the last few times I've been that I'd recommend are:   Popia: these are a fresh spring roll. Similar to Filipino \"fresh lumpia\". Fresh-wrapped (not fried, and also not similar to Vietnamese rice fresh wrap rolls) and filled with a combination of fresh and cooked vegetables, ground meat and in this case sausage. Comes with two, cut into bite-sized pieces.  Veggie salad with peanut sauce (I forgot the name): this was very refreshing, a nice way to have salad in winter as well. Plate came with cooked cabbage, al dente green beans, sliced boiled eggs, al dente bean sprouts, fried slices of tofu, and small shrimp chips on top.   Hainanese Chicken: Steamed chicken served with rice cooked in chicken stock. Served with several sauces. There are many Chinese restaurants in the city that serve their versions of this so I'd probably pick the other dishes to order here over this one.  Laksa Noodle soup: Rice noodles in a coconut curry gravy with shrimp, egg and chicken as garnishing.   Hokkien Prawn Mee: vermicelli and yellow noodles fried with shrimp, sliced cuttlefish and pork bits.   Beef Rendang: addictive, coconut and slightly spicy, easily pulled-apart succulent beef stew. Ordered roti with this, heaven!  Nasi Lemak: I ate this for breakfast every day in Singapore. A plate served with coconut-scented rice (heaven) with a small deep fried whole fish, boiled eggs, cucumber, fishcake wrapped in leaves, and slightly spicy shrimp paste sauce (I would like more spice in this). A little bit of everything makes this dish heaven for me.   Fried fish served in leaves with Sambal - crispy and addictive.  Martabak - a wrapped roti canai filled with minced meat curry with eggs and onion. Would prefer spicier but this was gooood. Served with hot curry (which again, I would like spicier).   Teh tarik: this is a tea that is mixed with carnation milk and 'pulled' from one mug to another to create a froth when served. I had this a lot in Singapore.  Chendol - icy drink with coconut milk and pandan leaf flavoured jelly bits and red bean. Refreshing, slightly too sweet but these icy Asian drinks (whether Indo Malay / Filipino or Chinese) are always too sweet for me.   I know they fry their shrimp paste there themselves (or maybe use a jarred one and add to it?) as I came once during lunchtime and the place reeeeeked (but for me, in a delicious way but not for my then pregnant-friend) of it!  Décor is simple, looks like a quiet Chinese Restaurant inside. There are many tables inside but I'm not sure how well it would accommodate very large groups. Impressively clean. Food is always served fairly quickly. I will be back again and again!"}
{"text":"Lion city is by far the best Singaporean food in Mississauga. It is always difficult to come by Singaporean good so this place is a gem.  I've been coming back to this place for more than 10 years.  My favourite dish that I order here is the chicken rice, great portion size and lots of flavour.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"We haven't been here since the owners changed and decided to give it a try.  It was the grand reopening day and it was busy.   The seating arrangement has changed and the decor.  We ordered Rendang and Hei Mee soup.   The rendang was very flavourful and spicy.  The noodle soup was delicious.  We spoke to the owners before we left and they seem like very nice people.   We would be back to try some of the other items on the menu."}
{"text":"I love this place.  I missed Singaporean food after moving here and when I discovered Lion City a couple of years ago, I have gone there with a few people so far. Pretty much tried 70% of their menu...few more items to go. Char kway teow , the hor fun and carrot cake are amazing. The goat and chicken rendang are delish. And their nasi lemak. Sooo good.  Its a must go to place if you've never had Malaysian and Singaporean cuisine."}
{"text":"I went here for mother's day and it is horrible.  The food tastes disgusting.  It all tastes the same.  Very very salty and no flavour.  The pictures look great, but when the food comes out, it looks absolutely nothing like the picture.  The servings are insanely small.  The service was more than horrible.   There were dirty tables everywhere.  Our table had a dirty water jug which they did not remove.  They forgot to bring me my soup.  They were rude as hell, especially the woman in the picture on their website.  I asked her about my soup and she gave me attitude and walked away! Absolutely horrible.    Very horrible food.  Very very dirty place, it's sooooooo dirty.  Horrible service.  100% thumbs down."}
{"text":"Singapore is a fascinating City State where the mythical Merlion watches over the Sea. A city that promotes & embraces it's culinary background and diversity thru Hawkers. A city infamous for infinite Hawker Stalls, each with it's own well-known specialty dish. Imagine the day when Toronto will have it's very first Hawker Centre. One can Dream.  Until that day, I truly appreciate Lion City's efforts to showcase Singaporean here. As in Singapore, Hawker Stalls of the same dish will vary in style from one-to-another. I've had mediocre Chicken Rice as well as ones that Anthony Bourdain approved.  Lion City simply tries to do too much with too little, and maybe changes are needed. A lone Singaporean restaurant in GTA cannot produce every dish to top standards. For what Lion City does, many dishes are very much within expectations.   ~3.5'd~ Focus on the promotion of Singapore Food & Culture is big enough a task itself.  The unusual surprises came to me in form of Pine-Cone shaped Pineapple Cake. Buttery crumbly pastry with a filling of Pineapple fresh sweet slightly fibrous filling. Beef Rendang was a dish I have given up on it after a trials at various restaurants. The bland flavours, mushy overcooked Beef turning into shreds. Nightmares. The one I had here was not scared of flavours/spices and Beef just moist enough.  The cons to those lovely dishes is that as many are not as write-home worthy. The same issue seems to happen to various other Southeast Asian resto in GTA. Catch 22 it seems as I do not wish them to take the really good dishes off Menu.  The service does seem lacking but it's more of a slower pace due to understaffing. This does make a challenge to bring dishes out steaming hot when diners hunger. Speed of Kitchen-to-Table will help satisfy some, hopefully without lack of quality.  One factor I hope GTA can appreciate is that even if they do not love Lion City, at least they should appreciate the friendly and willingness of Lilian(owner/chef). Her wealth of knowledge/experience in SG Cuisine to offer GTA is an asset. I look forward to go back and try dishes not too common in these parts of Ontario. I simply cannot wait until I go back for Singapore's ICONIC dish.  -anxious-"}
{"text":"Very good laksa lemak. Almost authentic! I love ordering a side of curry with roti canai. Their char kuey teow is not bad as well."}
{"text":"Poor customer service, bad food.. Grilled chicken was fried chicken. Gave us the wrong bill. Very dirty.. Don't recommend eating here unless you want food poisoning."}
{"text":"I've been here on two occasions now and find Lion City a nice simple place to have some Malaysia and Singapore fare. However some things can be a bit hit or miss.   The shrimp wonton was a great appetizer to start with. There's plenty of juicy meat and shrimp in the filling and skin is nice and crispy.   The curry laksa was excellent. The curry had a great kick of spice to it and the coconut milk. There was various toppings of chicken, fish cakes, shrimp, and fried tofu. It's a pretty loaded dish and I'd recommend this.   The Hainan chicken is also a classic. The rice is excellent: it was moist and flavored. The chicken was really tender and so was the chicken breast. The addition of the three sauces really completes this dish and enhances it. I really enjoyed all three of them - the ginger garlic was my favourite, the sambal was sweet and spicy and the soy based sauce was also sweet and savory.  The chicken curry with their roti was a big disappointment however. The flavor of the curry lacked a certain depth to it (as if there wasn't enough onion or garlic) and the chicken was so so. The roti appeared to be the frozen variety and was rather hard and stale. The worst part was that the curry was on the expensive side and it didn't include any rice or roti.  Service can be a bit lacking at times as they're a bit understaffed but overall it's still a great place for South East Asian food in Mississauga!"}
{"text":"Best Singaporean food in the City and I ain't Lion!  Seriously.   I came here with the family on a Sunday morning - we were the first customers there. Our server gladly seated us and we made our order:  Satay Goat rendang Beef panang curry Beef hor fan Wonton soup Coconut rice Briyani rice  There was not one thing that we were not amazed with.  The satay came with 6 skewers which were slightly on the small side, but they were packed with flavour. When dipped in the accompanying peanut sauce, few things taste better.  The goat rendang and beef panang curry dishes were both seasoned to perfection, both of them equally as delicious.   Beef hor fan - a noodle dish with black bean and large cuts of beef - again, nothing to complain about.   Rices and soup were also up to Lion City's very high standard.   Having tried a wide range of their dishes, I'm comfortable in recommending this restaurant to anyone. Their dishes are flavourful and delicious, their service is great, and the owners are among the nicest people you'll meet. Definitely go check it out."}
{"text":"Update: a new owner took over this restaurant and today was their opening day. I haven't had my char kwey teow fix for a while and was super looking forward to this!   When I arrived at around 7PM, there was even a line and the entire atmosphere has become much more lively than it was before! Too bad there were only two servers to seat everyone. I went there alone and got seated in around 15 minutes.   The place looked super different; there was new decor everywhere, even for the washrooms. The menus have been updated with a new look but had all the same delicious items.   I got a char kwey teow and satay skewers. Both were huge portions for a very cheap and fair price. Tasted the same, if not even better, than before and just like how I had it in Malaysia.   Congratulations on their new opening and I'm definitely going back!"}
{"text":"Am going to be honest that this place is probably the ONLY decent place to eat anything close to Singaporean cuisine..and they also do Malaysian/Indo dishes as well. There's really nothing to compare it with because other restaurants don't really have what they offer on the menu around the city. Its quite a shame for the limited palate experience, hopefully we have more of this cuisine in the future around GTA.  Personal recommendation would be the Hainanese chicken (its basically bland boiled chicken with a side of soup base and a sauces you can dip the chicken in---I like it if am eating it with other dishes that has more flavour to balance), Laksa lemak, and Nasi Lemak. I havent explored enough of their menu but their noodle dishes are always good.  I tried their Satay once and it was okay, am not too crazy about it. I feel like I could get it somewhere else better.  And as always, the dessert menu is amazing. My sweet tooth gave it an approval so you cant go wrong with anything in there. For drinks definitely get Teh tarik (hot or cold).. its like a milk tea beverage.   The service is okay (and I mean it generously) depending on how busy they are. Staff is polite. Interior wise is clean and well ventilated.   Overall, give it a try if your around the area. I would recommend it. Its not exactly inexpensive but its affordable enough to try the cuisine."}
{"text":"This is not the best Singaporean food I've had but it satisfied my cravings for robust flavoured Asian cooking.  Here's what we ordered:  Nasi Goreng: Good but not what I expected.  It was cooked with curry powder but without tomatoes. Whenever I've ordered this dish there is always tomatoes to help bring out the spice notes.   Carrot Cake: Not what I expected.  The texture of the traditional carrot cake (actually it's probably more accurately called radish or diakon cake, as it's made with Asian white radish/diakon) is more mealy.  Lion City cuts the pieces into long strips and pan fries them so that they turn out a bit dryer.  The seasoning was also off - they used soy, sugar and fish sauce to stir fry it when traditionally the dish is made with dried shrimp/shrimp paste, onions, fish sauce, and some kind of spicy sauce that brings out the flavour.  Lion City focused on making it sweet vs. spicy.  Beef Rendang: This was the highlight of the meal.  The beef was tender and moist the sauce was spot on.  Very delicious!  Sambal Kangkong: Their sambal sauce is very good and made this dish very memorable.  The portion was also huge, and the leftovers were just as delicious.  Service: 5-star for sure. We were waited on by the owner and she was very nice and attentive.  Treated like VIPs and made to feel very comfortable.  I would definitely come back, as I want to try their Hainenese Chicken and Oyster pancakes."}
{"text":"Some of the dishes here don't taste authentic, like the Nasi Lemak because they don't add the anchovies. The char kway teow is not bad and the chicken rice is fine too. Chin chow is way too sweet here for some reason. Its an acceptable place to satisfy your Singaporean cravings but don't expect to be blown away."}
{"text":"Went here based on recommendations from other Yelpers and it didn't disappoint. Ordered the Chicken Rendang and it was gooood. If you are looking for Singaporean/Malaysian food in Mississauga  then come and try this place. Only complaint is that it is harder to find as they are tucked away in a food plaza."}
{"text":"Delicious! Really enjoyed the beef rendang and char kwai teo. The blanchan kang kong was good, but didn't quite have the same flavour as I remembered in singapore and malaysia. Will definitely need to make the trek back!"}
{"text":"The goat rending was pretty amazing but it is a bit on the salty side... I absolutely love their toto, it's nice and flakey and buttery (though that may just be in my head too lol) their curries are also pretty good! It's a family run, very casual place that serves flavourful food!"}
{"text":"After seeing the great reviews from my fellow Yelpers and my past visit when I was a kid, I decided to give this restaurant another try. After a long day of work, me and my friends arrived at the restaurant and were quickly seated. Here is the run down:  Chicken/ Beef Satay Skewers $7.50 - had good sauce on the side - seasoned good  Chicken Curry with Rice $9.95 - portioned well - curry was average  This place serves authentic Singaporean food. The décor is outdated and the services are slow. Overall, I would return to Lion City. I recommend this to everyone looking for a quick, tasty dinner or lunch."}
{"text":"I don't know too many joints in Mississauga -- but there is this little plaza with a good Chinese supermarket (BTrust) and a bunch of random Chinese food joints - nothing great, but good value.  We wanted a change of pace, so we rolled the dice on Lion City which serves up Singaporean food -- which in itself is a fusion of SE Asian food, including Malaysian and Indonesian.  I must admit - I was pretty skeptical.  The place wasn't busy and there was no clear 'specialty'.  All the hawker staples were present on the menu: Hainan chicken rice, curries, laksa, mi goreng, etc.  The problem is that these are commonly sold in Asian hawker stalls where each stall specializes in one item -- not from one kitchen claiming to be able to do it all.  The jack of all trades, is the master of none.  I ordered the mee pok - flat yellow noodles tossed in a sauce, topped, in this case, with slices of pork, shrimp, fishballs and cuttlefish cake.  We split the shrimp radish cake and the lady got a noodle soup dish that I can't recall.  As we waited, we noticed another table had ordered Hainan chicken rice and I was getting that dreadful feeling that we ordered the wrong things.  But - I'm not sure if we were just lucky or things are really good here - but the food was damned good and bursting with flavour.  The shrimp radish cake was perfectly charred.  The mee pok was very simple but the layering of all the flavours was so good.  Tried a bit of the ladies noodle soup and it was heavy on flavours -- she was glad we ordered the radish cake to help 'cut' her dish.  I think we paid around $34 for the 3 items all-in.  Good portion sizes and our tastebuds went on a mini world tour.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem! This is Mom and Pop resto. The Mango Sald is a must try and I love their Laksa Lemak. I haven't tried anything else only because I love those two main dishes and I go back mainly for those.  When I do go back I'll be sure to try the beef rendang and chili Crab and see what the hype is all about.  Ambience: nothing special Food: amazing, I do have to try other ones Service: not bad, no complaints."}
{"text":"#SINGAPOREANFOOD #MALAYSIANFOOD #MISSISSAUGA #YELP  Tucked away in the Asian end of Mississauga where I have a few favorites already, this is the newest one that makes it to my list of. I like that it's family owned and serves something different - I haven't exactly found any place in Mississauga that serves Singaporean or Malaysian cuisine. And this was my very first time trying this kind of food.   We started with Beef Satay; which was a tad bit of a disappointment to be honest; I am used to better satay with better tasting peanut sauce that we make at home. This version tasted very turmeric-ky and the peanut sauce didn't taste of peanuts.   My friend ordered the Hainanese Chicken. She did so because she had a Hainanese craving and she's tried this kind of cuisine before. I tasted a little bit and found it quite bland. I wouldn't recommend it to a first timer.   I took to the images on Yelp to select my entree. And ordered the Wat tan hor fun. And oh, this dish is FUN! When the plated soupy deliciousness arrived, I warned the server that I had ordered the regular one, not large. She smiled, and politely let me know that that thing, infront of me, was indeed regular. This regular could feed 4 people, no lies. So damn tasty though!! A little skimpy on the toppings - 4 prawns, 6 pieces of cuttlefish, 4 bok choys aswim - but this can be forgiven. That soupyness was out of the world. As were the flat noodles. I can go back for some more.   Final Verdict: I am coming back. And next time when I do, I am ordering shareables. The portions are massive and the prices are good. I bet I could do a two people meal for $15 here."}
{"text":"I liked this place although the service was slow and it was not that packed when we went. My girlfriend didn't think the food was special but she is a bit picky. Will probably try it again to see what if their other dishes are good.  I had the fried fish that came on a banana leaf which was really great."}
{"text":"My search for a decent Hainanese Chicken on Rice in Toronto is finally over.  I first ate Hainanese chicken in Singapore, and the flavoured rice and fresh, tasty chicken left a lasting impression.  I have tried many widely acclaimed versions of Hainanese Chicken in many restaurants in Toronto, and they almost always get the texture wrong, meaning the chicken meat tend to fall apart on its own.  The Hainanese Chicken at Lion City Restaurant does not fall apart.  It means the chef takes the really long time to cook it, not taking short cut by raising the temperature, and not over-cooking it.  The rice was nicely flavoured and not overpowering.    The only other dish we ordered was Lion City House Noodle, and it tasted too bland for my liking.  It was also very oily; however, I understand and accept that this is one of the characteristics of the cuisine, so I won't deduct rating for the oiliness.  We will definitely be back for dinner to explore the varieties here.  Until then, I have no reservation giving Lion City a 4-star rating based on the Hainanese Chicken alone."}
{"text":"If you'd asked me a few years ago for my opinion of Indonesian food, I probably would've just shrugged my shoulders and mumbled something. But now I consider myself a fan based on the few dishes I've tried.  We'd heard good things about Lion City, so we embarked on a trek deep into the heart of Mississauga to sample their wares. We ultimately wound up ordering Nasi Goreng (\"Indonesian style fried rice with shrimps, chicken, and egg\") and Beef Rendang.  Though I've had both dishes at the far superior Little Sister, Lion City's spin on these two items is quite good. The Nasi Goreng was probably the weaker of the two, as it's a little too greasy and lacking in bold flavors to really warrant a hearty recommendation. It works perfectly when eaten with the Beef Rendang, though.  The Rendang is the real winner. The meat is soft and delicious, while the hearty sauce is full of flavor and spice. It's an addictive dish and I only wish there was more of it.  And as a final note: I've noticed a lot of people complaining about the service, but that wasn't an issue at all for us. We were handed that order sheet that Asian restaurants seem to love as soon as we walked in and it was picked up within a minute or two of us filling it out. No problem whatsoever."}
{"text":"One of my family's favourites.  Sometimes the service is a bit short staffed, but they've gotten better lately with that.  The food is really yummy.  Our favourites are mango salad, satay skewers, and hanoi chicken."}
{"text":"I am at a loss for words in describing the pure deliciousness of this food.  At the recommendation of my Malaysian colleague, Steven, two of my friends and I visited for a late lunch on a Friday. It's a fairly small to average size restaurant, unassuming, clean and quite busy.   We decided to order dishes that Steven suggested. First, we started with \"Popiah.\" I know, I've never heard of it before either but it's basically a \"fresh roll\" filled with warm ingredients such as Chinese sausage, mushrooms, eggs, chicken and some other ingredients that I couldn't decipher as I've never eaten them before. They served the Popiah with fresh, homemade Sambal sauce (homemade chili/garlic sauce). My friends and I could not get enough of this delectableness. The texture and all the flavour contrasts easily made it one of the best things I've ever eaten. It was so outstanding that we had to order a second serving. I could eat that every single day and not tire of it.  Next was the \"Wat Tan Hor Fun\", which was a thick rice noodle with pork, seafood and bok choy in a kind of eggy sauce; \"Oh Luak\", which is basically an omelette with oyster with a similar type sauce to the Wat Tan Hor Fun. Both dishes were remarkable; however, they must be consumed hot, otherwise they become too glutinous once they hit room temperature. I would suggest ordering either one of those dishes if you are in a large group.  What we really, truly loved was the Beef Rendang with Roti. I guess the best way to describe it would be a Malaysian curry. The meat had obviously been slow cooked in thick, rich sauce. I've never tasted a curry like that before so I can't describe the ingredients but there were all the elements of tangy, spicy, sweet and the Roti provided the perfect texture.  We were so impressed that we considered ordering the Mango Salad (albeit a savoury dish) for dessert. Unfortunately, we were beyond fullness.  When the cheque arrived, we were surprised that it was only $55.  I also want to mention that I strongly disagree with the other reviews about poor service. Our server further described the dishes and they arrived quick and piping hot.   We were there for a couple of hours and never felt rushed.  Plans are already in the works to go back next week!"}
{"text":"not the cleanest place but the food's beyond stellar keeps me coming back  flavours and spices varying from dish to dish so many to try!  their laksa, curries, noodle dishes and roti are all delicious  i feel bad for you if you've never eaten here 'cause you're missing out"}
{"text":"Place is a hole in the wall but offers authentic Singaporean food.  Would enjoy the food better as take-out."}
{"text":"I won't return to this restaurant for a few reasons.  1: The hor fan doesn't taste the same anymore. I had the plate of noodle with my family twice since the new owner took over. Its burning taste to the plate of noodle is gone.  2: Everything we ordered was salty. Ikan bakar in banana leaf was salty, oh chien was salty and wat hor fan was also salty. These were some of the usual food items my family orders when the Singaporean owner was still in charge. When my family told the waitress regarding the taste, they told us that we can request for less salt in the future (lol)  All in all, I suspect they may have changed their cook or the cook just can't be bothered anymore. I guess my next plate of hor fan will have to cost me a flight ticket. :p"}
{"text":"I recently had the immense pleasure of visiting the wonderful Lion City Restaurant, a neat little family-run establishment, and enjoyed a very delicious, hearty, and colorful Malaysian/Indonesian dinner, and will definitely keep coming again and again. I loved their sumptuous Chicken Satay Skewers as my appetizer, which consisted of succulent, boneless, and yummy chunks of chicken breast (which they marinate in their aromatic Malaysian spices), accompanied with delicious Peanut Sauce (I loved the sauce so much that I asked for more) and chopped fresh cucumber. I then savored their yummy, colorful, and hearty Nasi Goreng, which was Indonesian-style fried rice, of which I requested a veg version, so it had tasty morsels of tofu, cauliflower, carrots, etc. With the delicious rice, I enjoyed their sumptuous, aromatic, and satisfying Beef Rendang, which was tender, boneless, and delicious chunks of lean beef bathing in a thick and flavorful sauce. Don't forget to grab a yummy and refreshing glass of Chendol, a dessert-like beverage (made, I think, with shaved ice, coconut milk, green dessert noodles, tapioca, and palm sugar), a powerhouse of delicious nutrition. Orders were taken by a very courteous, cheerful, and sweet Singaporean gentleman (I think him and his wife are the owners), who also brought the wonderful food right to my table, with a smile, helped by his wife (who I think is the main Chef) and the couple's adult children, I think. They were all very courteous, cheerful, hospitable, and efficient. Many yummy items to choose from, from South East Asian nations of Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, and Thailand. Large variety. Very high quality food in very generous portions at very good prices. No wonder the place was packed, with many dine-in patrons as well as take-out patrons. The atmosphere is very friendly and relaxed. Great ambiance. The interior dining area is immaculately clean and tidy. Plenty of tables. All forms of payment accepted. Prime and convenient location in the Burnhamthorpe Rd W and Creditview/Central Pkwy W area of Mississauga. Within proximity to Highway 403. Plenty of parking, in front and sides of the restaurant, and in the plaza in which it is located. Bus shelter/stop literally at doorstep for a MiWay local route and more bus shelters/stops just a bit up the road for more MiWay express and local routes. [See my photos I took]. A few steps away is the Erindale GO Train Station. My sincere thanks to the wonderful staff of Lion City Restaurant for making my first visit a very enjoyable one and I look forward to continue dining at your great establishment on an ongoing basis. God Bless."}
{"text":"This restaurant has friendly service, good food, and a small family run feel to it,  which I love. As the weather is getting cooler, I wanted something hot and soupy. It was a Friday night so busy, and we waited about 20 mins for our food. We ordered the laksa, fried chicken and tofu appetizer. The laksa had a spicy but tolerable kick to it, fried chicken was tasty but a little overly greasy, and the tofu app was really good; lots of flavour and textures. Many tables had ordered the Hainese chicken and beef rendeng, ,which I will be returning to try."}
{"text":"SO DISAPPOINTED!!! I'm writing this review shortly after eating. First we arrived here at 8pm for a late dinner. Yes, I do realize it's late but considering it closed later and many more people and family came afterwards, I didn't think the below would be issues. Although I grew up in an Asian family, I've never been keen on Asian food. Having my pick I do prefer Chinese but decided to come here bc my family wanted to come and eat, my grandmother always raves about this place, and I didn't want to fuss. I don't like Malaysian, Indonesian, Singaporean food and I'm not a big fan in Thai. Nevertheless I'd thought I'd go in with an open mind. Like I said earlier we arrived at 8pm. First off this place is SMALL. Theres only 3 tables in the entire restaurant that seat parties bigger than 4 and 2 of 3 of them were taken when we arrived. We asked to be seated at the third one but they said it was reserved. Our group was 5, so they directed us to a table of 4 and added a chair on the end. All tables are small and there's not enough room for your own plates, cups, the kettle pot, utensils and for the dishes that come out. Also, bc we had to add a chair to the end table to seat 5, the person sitting in the end ended up being in the pathway where the waiters come and deliver food which made it aggravating. A couple of minutes later, our waiter came. Now I know this is an Asian place, but I felt like he was very hard to communicate with. Also, which was even more annoying, he looked fed up to be working here.  We started with appetizers. We decided to have 1 order spring rolls and 1 order chicken satay. I was really looking forward to the satay. The waiter came back shortly to inform us that they ran out of satay. Disappointed we tried to understand and made it 2 orders of spring rolls instead of 1. The same thing happened. They came back and said they didn't have enough spring rolls for 2 orders as they ran out. Disappointed again, we kept our original 1 order of spring rolls and ordered 1 order of chicken wings. The spring rolls came. Fast forwarding to ordering entreees, we ordered 1 lion city egg noodle dish. It was #19 on the menu. Egg Noodles are one of the few Asian dishes that i like so I was really excited to eat it. The same thing kept happening. The waiter came back and did the same thing and told us they had run out. Now I was really annoyed and frustrated and it was written all over my face. My aunt ordered a substitute noodle dish instead. We ordered green curry that my mom was looking forward to eating. Again history repeated itself. They told us that they ran out of green curry. I was very upset at that point and wanted to leave the restaurant and go elsewhere but everyone wanted to stay. Instead we substituted a chicken curry.  We began eating. I ate the fried rice and while it was good it wasn't out of this world. I've had better for cheaper price. Next, some green vegetable (I forget the order) came. Ive forgotten the name but apparently it was like the water crest vegetable. It was satayed with garlic. My aunt loves this so i decided to try it. Mid bite on my first try, I see A PIECE OF HAIR IN MY FOOD. It was brown like my hair but way too short to be my own. By that time I was THROUGHLY DISGUSTED. That was the first and last time I took a bite of it. The Substitute noodle dish came and it was vermicelli noddles with pork and veggies. I didn't insist on telling the waiter no bean sprouts bc my family wanted it. Well I should have. The dish was ALL bean sprouts and hardly ANY NOODLES. By this time I was tired frustrated and downright disappointed. Bean sprouts are a topping that's supposed to enhance the dish not be the core of the dish itself. This was the icing on top of the cake. Almost done with eating the meal, the chicken wings come out. Also, my aunt ordered a side of coconut rice to go with the curry when we ordered the entrees and it only came after she asked for it 3+ times.  During our time eating there, The waiters never came by to ask how the food was, and anytime we wanted more of anything, we had to flag the waiters instead of them Coming by to ask about our food. Also, my aunt ordered food to take out early on in the evening and she has to flag down and ask a waiter about her own food instead of the waiter being pro active and delivering it to our table.  Overall, it was subpAr food with even lower subpar service. This was an all time new experience. I've had crappy food at some restaurants, and crappy service at others yet no experiences that had both until tonight at lion city. My grandmother payed the bill and I took a sneak peak at the total. It was about $100 for everything and it was SO NOT WORTH the money! when we left, I realized that there was a Chinese to the left of us and a Korean BBQ to the right of us. I wish we could have picked one of one those places or yet, some other Asian place anywhere else in Mississauga or surrounding area."}
{"text":"We sampled a number of dishes from here:  Nasi Goreng & Nasi Lemak - both delicious! Hainan Chicken Rice - pretty good with the sauces on the side, though I didn't find it very special. Laksa Lemak - not too spicy, I found it a bit bland, actually, but it was an interesting dish Stir Fried Beans - similar to Chinese style, except more flavourful! Baboh Cha Cha - dessert that was similar to the Chinese tapioca dessert (???), except there are the sweet potato & taro additions. I enjoyed it.  I actually haven't had Indonesian or Malaysian food much before this experience, so I have nothing to compare it to except for the Chinese versions of these dishes. I say that many of these dishes are much more flavourful than the Chinese counterparts.   The prices are pretty reasonable, I don't know why people complain about that. I guess the interior needs a makeover, though all the shops and restaurants in that strip mall don't have the greatest interior design.  The service was decent though we had to wave down the waitress at times. We saw the old couple there that day helping out, so I don't think they changed owners.   I would definitely love to come back here again."}
{"text":"Went a couple times before. Once after it is newly renovated. Hainan chicken rice is still my favorite. Their beef brisket curry is pretty good too.  They have changed the menu and options are very limit now."}
{"text":"I have been coming to this restaurant for the past 15 years.  I haven't been back for a long time and IT IS NOT THE SAME as before anymore, sadly to say.   I have been ordering their Hainanese Chicken Rice for ages!  Today, the rice was not fragrant and quite soggy.   Chicken is the key to the dish and it tasted like plain boiled chicken I can do myself at home.  I also use to can choose between dark and white meat and their white meat use to have absolutely no bones in it ~ very tender.  But the girl told me, they don't allow us to choose now.  Anyways, we did get white meat for the most part, but the chicken didn't taste fresh.  Bummer.  Also ordered their Char Kway Teow.  It was soaked in dark soy sauce.   Sorely disappointed.   The Old Lion City definitely is not serving as \"authentically\" delicious dishes like they use to, in my opinion.   Sad to say, I've moved on."}
{"text":"Came here again and was surprised to see the newly renovated restaurant. I was told by the waiter that the owners have changed but the chefs are the same. The Wan Tan Hor Fun is delicious as before. I like that the restaurant is much brighter and more spacious now. Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"When I found out that Kway teow (Malaysian rice noodles that is similar but NOT THE SAME as Chinese ho fan) was being served in a restaurant near by I just had to try it. Imagine no longer having to drive to Richmond Hill or Scarbaria!  But alas reality was reality and the Kway teow was just not that good.  The entire dish had maybe four pieces of shrimp. The roti cannai was not worth my calorie intake.  The place redeemed itself with decent beef rendang and tasty coconut rice. This place is fine if you want your fix on the West end. If you're willing to drive the distance there are better places elsewhere."}
{"text":"After a few visits, I think your rating really depends on WHAT you order.  Their strengths seem to be: -  laksas, love the fish/tofu balls! -  curries -  seafood  Stir-fries, including Nasi Goreng, Pad Thai are done fresh, but average.  Pad Thai, although it was made non-spicy, as per request, was quite bland tasting.  My favourite dish out of everything that I've had there is the Laksa Lemak.  Meat in dishes needs work.  The goat curry and chicken in KL Laksa were overcooked and dry.  Service is really a hit and miss.  The young girl who works there is pleasant with a friendly demeanor.  A younger guy who worked today just had an attitude that was written all over his face!  Owners do seem nice, but they seem to chat only with patrons who approach them.  Prices are good, but they need to review some of their staffing decisions."}
{"text":"This place is great! My boyfriend and I come here frequently every time we are craving Chicken Rice. All of their menu items are full of flavour and decently priced.  Our favourites are the Chicken Rice for main dish, chicken satay for appetizer, iced coffee for drink, and the Sago for dessert. The fried rice is also very good, as are all of the soups.  The service is very friendly and always speedy. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Lion City serves a mix of Malaysian/Indonesian/Singaporean food. We were in Mississauga for a day and I was craving randang so I convinced everyone to come here. The restaurant is owned by a very nice, old couple giving this place a warm and welcoming feel.  We actually had two dinner plans for the night and this was part 1, so we needed to keep the food quantity to a reasonable level.  We got:  Beef Randang Laksa Lemak Mee Soto Wan Tan Hor Fun Fried Shrimp Wontons  The randang was probably best among the 5 dishes we ordered. During my visit to Malaysia, I had randang almost every day so I'm a bit spoiled but it was decent. The beef was cooked tender and the curry itself wasn't bad. I didn't love my cousin's laksa lemak which I found to be a little bland. The wan tan hor fun was not a dish I've had before. It seemed like a version of shrimp with lobster sauce but with the addition of flat rice noodles. Overall, I found the food to be decent but I wasn't blown away.  I did want to try their nasi lemak as well but we needed to save space in our stomachs for dinner part#2  We just had so much to eat And miles to go before we sleep.  Robert Frost just turned in his grave."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place.  The food is amazing , the service is hit and miss, but who cares ! did I mention the food is amazing!!  My go to dish is the red curry with fish. I don't think I have ever had fish like this before. I believe the fish is first deep fried and then cooked the curry sauce. So good! It's a little greasy, but hey! Yolo. (is yolo still a thing?)  We also ordered the herbal pork soup. It was a less than anticipated, just enough to share between 2 ppl. But it hit the spot on a chilly day.  Anyway, just go! Try it out.  **Last time I visited the restaurant with a friend; she is a vegetarian. We had asked if the popiah had any meat in it. The server told us no, but it did. So be careful if you had any dietary limitations."}
{"text":"We've been eating at Lion City for more than 20 years, but this was our first visit in a few years. After this visit, we questioned why we haven't been there for so long.   I ordered the laksa lemak and it was phenomenal. The broth was just the perfect amount of spicy and just the right amount of creamy.  The fried tofu in it was obviously made on site as it was firm on the outside but lovely and soft inside. There was lots of chicken, shrimp and fish cakes and the noodles were cooked perfectly.  My husband had the Hei Mee soup and he thought it was delicious. It was filled with lots of shrimp, fish cakes and pork and two kinds of noodles (rice and egg). The broth was rich and flavourful.  We lived in Malaysia and can vouch for the food here being authentic!  The service was friendly and efficient and the prices were very reasonable.   The dining room and washrooms were both clean.  We'll definitely be coming back much more often in the future!"}
{"text":"We had visited this strip mall during our weeklong stay in Mississauga. Every night, we would come back to this strip mall and try a different restaurant. It was a lot of fun! Lion City Restaurant was our last restaurant to try on our last night there. For dinner, we ordered roti chanai as appetizers and popiah. I didn't like the popiah but my husband did. It tasted bland. The roti chanai was just plain bread. In NY, we would be given a bowl of curry sauce and potato to dip our roti chanai in. But, we didn't get that here. Felt like something was missing when we didn't have anything to dip our roti in.  We also ordered the claypot rice. It had chicken and chinese sausages. That was pretty good. We also ordered the Mee Goreng. That was ok. Service was very friendly. I think it was the owner's father and mother who was working while the chef was cooking. They were pretty nice. Will probably return if in the area."}
{"text":"Lion City serves a mix of Indonesian/Malaysian/Singaporean food. They also have an entire back side of their menu dedicated to Thai food.   My lady had the Laksa Lemak ($7.95) -curry/coconut based noodle soup with chicken, fish cake and shrimp. A little bit bland. Flavors were not as bold and as forward as I thought it should have been. Not as spicy either.   I had the Hei Mee Soup ($7.95) -mixture of rice vermicelli and egg noodle soup with shrimp, fish cake and chicken broth base. More savory, good stock, a bit stronger than the Laksa but still not still on the bland side. Good texture though because there is two different types of noodles -pretty traditional in IMS.   On the plus side, really cheap prices and very friendly service staff. The owners are a bit old but lovely, lovely people -I love old people.   I'd probably go back but not right away. It was forgettable and the flavors were not as bold as I know IMS food should have. Certainly the IMS hotspots are probably in Richmond Hill."}
{"text":"This is one of the only places in Mississauga I've seen that has Malaysian food. My favourite dish is the Nasi Goreng (Malaysian Fried Rice) and their Fried Radish Cake. It's delicious! The curry and roti is also quite good. Also, my favourite drink is the Cold Milk Tea. This is not your typical Asian restaurant because you'll see a lot of dishes offered here that aren't offered in other places. Nasi Lemak is a standard Malaysian dish my boyfriend is a huge fan of.   The prices are a little high, so I only come here occasionally. Service can be quite fast, but a lot of times, it's slow because the owners are an elderly couple. I understand that, and I appreciate that they've brought on other servers for busier days. The restaurant itself is quite small, and service isn't amazing, but that's expected from most of the restaurants in this plaza. If you know someone who can cook Malaysian food at home, then you'll save a lot of money by eating with them! While the food here is not the absolute best, it's good enough for me to say that it's worth a visit if other types of Asian cuisine (IE not just Chinese) appeal to you."}
{"text":"I am so glad I made a repeat visit to Lion City Restaurant and able to try out quite a few more dishes with a few of my fellow yelpers!  Mango Salad - $7 - sweet and sour with chunks of peanuts!  Oh Luak (Oyster Omelette) - $12.95 - A local Singaporean version with this really gooey sticky texture  Hainanese Chicken Rice - $7.95 - Chicken oil rice is the star and the sweet dark soy sauce make this perfect!  Blanchan Kang Kong - $9.95 - cooked perfectly with great bite, but a little light in blanchan!  Hokkien Mee - $7.95 - I never a fan of Hokkien Mee... but my dinner mates really enjoy that..   Beef Rendang - $9.95 - One of the best Beef Rendang I had! Soft, tender, moist and full of flavours! I definitely think this is the best dish of the night! The roti though disappointing hard and bread like...  Dessert!! The Best part of the meal! Ice Kachang - $4.50 Sago Gula Melaka - $4 Pineapple Pastry and steamed pudding I enjoyed all the dessert! Especially the Sago Gula Melaka (Sago pearls with palm sugar and coconut milk!)  Extra 0.5 star is to the homemade sambal sauce! Complex in flavours and has a great punch! Making everything so tasty!  Thanks for an enjoyable dinner and kind hospitality of Lion City! I can't wait to try their chili crab next time!  Services still lacking...  but the food experience is so much better this time round!"}
{"text":"Update on April 21, 2018.  The restaurant has been totally renovated and is now owned by fellow Singaporeans! The cooks are still working here so you can expect the same quality of food here. I'm looking forward to some revamped dishes as well in the near future!  I have over 645 check-ins (as of April, 2018) here over the past 6 years which means I average 2 visits a week. Consider that I have been frequenting this restaurant for over 20 years equates to well over 2000 meals eaten here!  What keeps me coming back?  Two words: The FOOD!  Being an ex Singaporean, I was born a foodie. I still make annual visits to my motherland to visit my folks and gorge on the best tasty food in the world!  This restaurant does satisfy my food cravings for Singaporean food in the GTA. I am very thankful I live only 10 minutes away from this place!  If you are familiar with Singaporean food, you will know that the hawkers will usually specialize in only one type of food so are very good at it. This restaurant however tries to cater to many different types of food so do not expect every dish to be 100% perfect.   My favourite dishes here include the Prawn mee soup, Beef brisket curry with coconut rice, beef rendang, wat tan hor fun, Tahu goreng, mee siam, lontong and even their house fried rice is excellent. My wife enjoys the laksa.   The not so good: Sure this being a typical Asian restaurant does lack in customer service but be patient, you will manage to flag down one of their servers.  After all you are here for the food and that is great!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurant in Mississauga. Try Laksa and durian/ mango dessert if you like the fruits. Authentic Singaporean food is welcomed you at any time"}
{"text":"I would personally give them a perfect score because of its food taste and quality, but the service can be slow and takes a while to get the servers attention. Personally, it's not professional when they're just chilling at the counters."}
{"text":"Their taste are authentic with bold taste. I loved every dishes that brought out to the table. Price and potion are decent, service is friendly and will definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"The beef rendang was fantastic, but the hainanese chicken was disappointing- too bland and average for such praise from Yelpers. The portions are a bit small for the price and atmosphere is chilly and bare, but the service is quite friendly."}
{"text":"WHAT TO TRY?!  The laksas and the flat noodle dishes. I didn't try the flat noodle dishes per se but the dishes are the fan favorites here. Specifically the char kuew tiau, wat tan hor fun, and Thai fried chicken. The grilled fish in banana leaf is also another fan favorite.   Out of the laksas, the laksa lemak is the best one! Comes in a coconut spicy soup, there's abundance of tofu, fish cake and one shrimp. The Penang laksa is alright though. It's a fish soup base with a taste of tamarind. Unless you're a fan of fish, you won't appreciate the fishy taste to this laksa. The laksas in general were somewhat bland in flavor though. Spicy, but not a rich creamy curry.   LAST TIP?!  It's a small restaurant and some of their chairs are mixed in style, so be prepared to sometimes sit in patio chairs, or a regular chair or even a stool. The hainanese chicken with rice is a popular dish with the Chinese people too."}
{"text":"If you think you can find authentic indonesian food in here ,I think you are in wrong restaurant.  They are authentic on Malaysian . The price is pricy also."}
{"text":"I heard there's a new owner now (not 100% sure) but they've gone through major renovations which decreased the number of seats imo but the store def looks a lot nicer, brighter and cleaner.   Food tastes the same as before.  Menu is updated as well."}
{"text":"I have tried the hainanese chicken rice, bak kut teh, singapore laksa, wah tan ho in this place.   Highly recommend the Hainanese chicken rice. The chicken was so tender and the rice has flavour while not too oily which I enjoyed it so much.   It was the first time I tried Bak kut teh, the soup tasted so good but the ribs weren't as tender as I preferred. It was small portion so if you order this, you probably should order something else too.   Singapore laksa was great. I like they used the white noodles  instead of the yellow noodles.   Wah tan ho was below average. The egg sauce was not thick enough for my liking and I found it slightly salty because of that.   The milk tea (Teh tarik) was sooo good!!! A must try.  I think this is the best milk tea I found in town."}
{"text":"I've eaten here once and ordered take out. The staff are friendly and provide great service. The flavors are so bold and authentic. Very reasonably priced. Excellent value due to high quality and generous portions. For takeout it took a long time for 4 dishes but they were apologetic for the wait. The good thing is that it's made fresh. You have to try the Thai fried chicken (sauce is very unique and key to the dish), fried carrot/rice flour cake, laksa, eggplant and pad Thai. I will be back to try the other dishes!! Lion City keep it up! It would be nice if you could invest in some minor upgrades to the decor (fresh paint, new tablecloths or do away with them and add some art from the region underneath?)"}
{"text":"OMG. Jaw dropping deliciousness!!!   CHILLI CRAB BEEF RENDANG CURRY CHICKEN CHAR KWAY TEOW (Singaporean noodles) TAMARIND SHRIMP  ALL WERE SPECTAULAR.   The beef and chicken were so juicy and tender. All the different sauces were a party in your mouth and a punch in the face that you you continue to seek   Wasting is not an option. Scrape, lick and dig, but DO NOT WASTE.   We joked about moving from queen west to this remote area and happily if it meant being close to this diamond in the rough!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Since Lillian n Thomas retirement, service and food quality has been not consistent.  Today was a good visit. Gado gado beige salad was good.  Tofu crisp outside, soft Inside. Dressing okay. Good portioning.   Chicken n pork satay are now portioned better with marinate through meat.  Oyster omelette more crisp, not soggy.  Very good.   Mee poh.  Dry noodles with variety of fish ball, pork, fish cake slices and bean sprout good and consistent with flavor.   Missing various cakes n kueh, Chee kueh and curry puffs."}
{"text":"Ahhh, what can I say about this place except that we have to eat here a minimum of once or twice a week!  Lol.  It's our second kitchen as there aren't any other Singaporean or Malaysian restaurants in the area, plus the fact the quality of food here is great and very authentic.    Their number one seller is Hainanese Chicken Rice.  However, I do have to point one thing out though.  Most Asians are familiar with this dish and it is something that 99% of them will go for.  The non-Asians might not like it as much unless you know what it's all about.  It is mainly a boiled chicken dish.  Sounds boring but it's not!  It is chicken that is specifically boiled to a tender state, not too hard and not too soft.  Just right.  The rice is very tasty as it is cooked with chicken stock and oil.  Now the most important things for this dish are the condiments.  Without those, the boiled chicken dish is not what it is famous for.  It is a must try!  The service here is not the best but we sacrifice that for the good food they offer.  There are many other local dishes they have to offer.  Prawn noodle soup, carrot cake, (this is savoury not a dessert) Fried Kway Teow, Laksa, Lontong, Nasi Lemak, Rendang, Grilled Fish and lots more!  You will enjoy the food here.  Go and try it!"}
