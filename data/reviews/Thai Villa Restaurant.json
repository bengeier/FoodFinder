{"text":"This is an update to my previous review where I had the chance to learn more about the restaurant,  that gave me a better perspective, as well I sampled the dinner menu.  I had ordered chicken satay as one of the starters, and found the satay to be so incredibly mild I had to call our server over and enquire. Satay should have a spicy bite with a healthy heat and I asked why this was so mild. I was told they tamed the Thai dishes down because this was  family restaurant,  and kids would not be able to eat food with traditional spiciness.   Good point! that helped me position the review a little better. The chicken on the Chicken satay, was lacking flavor, lots of chicken but very bland. We also ordered the Thai chicken wings, good size but again pretty bland.  My friend ordered the Pad Thai,  that's not a tough dish to cook, I ordered the Chicken Penang with chicken fried rice. It wasn't bad, again, I have to look past the authenticity and settle for family rated food. So, that being said, you certainly get lots, and the service although very busy, our service was excellent and thoughtful.  It was suggested I try the coconut ice. A whole, small coconut imported from Asia, with coconut in a coconut milk/cream concoction that was delicious, I highly recommend this.  Overall, if you are looking for plenty of family type Thai food with lots of leftovers,  great service and modest prices, this is for you!"}
{"text":"We eat at Thai Villa frequently and always enjoy it. Laksa soup is amazing - chilli chicken is yummy. Find the pricing reasonable and food quality always good!"}
{"text":"Overall a clean nice restaurant. Good food we will return again!"}
{"text":"This used to be a great place for Thai but when I ordered the chilli chicken and could not chew through the dark coloured whatever it was.. I decided to leave it in the napkin !  I can't get that out of my mind and there is no way it was 'chicken' and not even did it 'taste like chicken!'  Unbelievable !!"}
{"text":"Wow. Thai Villa, where's the Thai food?   I went there for lunch with family, and had a pretty bad feeling when we were served Chinese Style Sweet and Sour soup. The soup was way too sweet, but the curry dishes were even sweeter.. So much for Thai food.   Thai villa a relatively clean and efficient restaurant.  But, this place is only for folks that do not know or care about what Thai food really is..."}
{"text":"You know that YouTube video of the two unicorns that convince another unicorn to go to Candy Mountain (look up Charlie the Unicorn)?  Thai Villa feels like that, minus the (SPOILER!) kidney theft.   Everything at the Villa tastes like several tablespoons of sugar.   The hot & sour soup was neither hot (spicy) nor sour. It was sweet like it was made with a few tablespoons of sugar.  The red curry?  Surprisingly not savoury, but sweet again as though sprinkled with sugar.  The only dish that was savoury was the large plate of shrimp chips ($3.99).  The surprisingly large plate of mango & cucumber salad ($3.99) was OK too.    The lunch combo seems like a fair deal, where at $8.50 you get a fried springroll, a curry/main with a bowl of rice, plus a can of soda or hot jasmine tea.  Carbonated sugar to top off your sugar meal, anyone?"}
{"text":"Good Thai, both eat in and take-out/delivery.  The food is much higher quality than Thai One On."}
{"text":"Stouffville is full of fast food restaurants and pubs so Thai Villa is a wonderful break from all of that. Out of all the \"Asian\" choices in this town, Thai Villa is definitely the best one. They have a great selection of lunch specials from $8.50 up and they all come with soup, a spring roll and tea/a soft drink, which I think is a fairly good deal. I had the Pad Thai and the Thai Tao Chicken with Rice and they were both great! The chicken was tender and tasty. The only thing is that the Pad Thai is a little too sweet for my taste.  This is a great choice for a quick and filling lunch and the service is nice and friendly as well. Recommended for those who live in Stouffville or are passing by the town :)"}
{"text":"This restaurant lacks in many ways. It is not a very authentic Thai restaurant at all. They serve up Chinese food but call it Thai.  I ordered the crispy chicken and fried rice. The chicken tasted stale and over fried making the chicken taste very dry like roots. While the fried rice had nothing in it but soy sauce as condiments.  My party also ordered two curries which was basically the same. Over cooked broccoli and tasteless chicken. The curry had no aroma or so spicy flavors in it at all. It tasted more like it was watered down. They also served up spring rolls and sweet and spicy soup which  both are Chinese dishes. I probably would not be back again."}
{"text":"The food needs serious improvement. Thai spicy noodles was way too salty and it did not taste like Thai basil sauce, more like soy sauce. Orange crispy chicken tasted very artificial and chicken pieces were very thin. Both were supposed to be very simple Thai dishes but they both failed at this place. I hope they can compare their own food with the one real Thai chefs make at some of the authentic Thai restaurants in downtown Toronto. The difference is very obvious. The place is very clean though."}
{"text":"ive been here a lot but only for take out for the chili chicken lunch special. i always ask for it without onions and get it with onions. the food is great and the veggies taste fresh and are crispy. its never busy when i go in. the regular menu prices are a bit pricey, therefore i only order during lunch. the hot and sour soup is really good. they sometimes have a veggie soup thats kinda gross. theres nothing spicy about the chili chicken."}
{"text":"This is my favourite Thai restaurant in all of Markham/Stouffville. The mango salad is specifically delicious! The satay and cold rolls come served with a peanut sauce and a vinegar sauce and both are amazing! The service is very good and the food comes out quickly. The plates are nice as they look like leaves. The mango chicken is a MUST try! It is sweet and delicious."}
{"text":"One the better establishments in the town of Stouffville. Been here for a while and probably has been the dinner or lunch spot of many new and visiting people to the town.  Went here for launch and was instantly greeted by what I assume was one of the owners. Really happy and eager to serve you when going into the restaurant.  Ordered a curry and pad thai off their lunch specials. Great flavours, taste and the atmosphere is an elaborate thai design that most thai places do wrong. This isn't tacky, it looks good. it's not bad for a Thai place in town and it saves me a trip going to Markham for example.  my small complaint is that they've raised prices and cut portion sizes recently due to what I assume is cost of food rising over the last few years. and that really takes the value down a big.  But can't complain. 3.5 rounded to 4.0"}
{"text":"ordered shrimp pad Thai with mango chicken.. , didn't taste any close to Thai food.. pad Thai was bland with no vegetables nor flavour... found may be 2 pieces of tofu and just 5 piece shrimp in this whole dish.. mango chicken was served with like breaded. chicken pieces topped with just a little grated mango slices.had I had known there was no gravy I wouldn't have ordered this item. the person never bothered to explain this to us. spent $25 for these 2 regular sized items even after a 10% cash discount. wouldn't consider going back."}
{"text":"Pad Thai was bad Thai unfortunately.  Sping rolls tasted like a barn smells.  Ginger beef was good."}
{"text":"Was in the area and noticed this rest. Ordered the Chilli Chicken on Chow Mein based off the multiple pics shown here. Not going to critique the flavours even though it was dry and bland. But the chicken was definitely more than a day old. Was very dry, oily and rubbery. Was 4pm and there were only 2 customers at 1 table."}
{"text":"I was hungry after running errands on a Saturday. I decided to stop by this restaurant. I have seen it here for a while.   The place only had one other customer. There are wicker chairs and benches with padding.   The lunch specials are extensive. I went with the chili chicken with chow mein. I wanted a spicy dish.   A bowl of hot and sour soup, and a spring roll came first. It was perfect! The soup was delicious. The spring roll with the dipping sauce was light. I liked it.   My chow mein dish came next. It looks small, but it truly isn't. I'm not crazy about zucchini. I was glad that I only had a few pieces to discard. The heat built up as I ate. It was tasty.   Service is fast and friendly. I had to ask for chopsticks and got a disposable pair in less than thirty seconds. Wonderful!  I'd come back here to try the green curry. It's a good place with decent food at equally decent prices.   (76)"}
{"text":"really enjoyed the chicken pad Thai, food was very fresh and tasty. Highly recommend if you like Thai food."}
{"text":"I am not a fan of restaurants in Stoufville (Boston Pizza, Sushi Maki have failed to impress me) but I am giving this  family business 4 stars based on the cleanliness of the restaurant, the service and the food. Really enjoyed the chili chicken, and lightly fried shrimp dish that was served with stir fried vegetables. For me the food did have the wow factor, and if you are ever in this area and have a craving for Thai, give them a chance and ignore some of the negative reviews here. It's very rare that I will go back to a restaurant twice in the same week, but I can't wait to try some of their other dishes as well. Prices are moderate and on par with what you expect to pay for Thai food. I noticed their take out counter was going non stop while we were there too, and and that is a sign that the food is very good as well."}
{"text":"Service was amazing, but the food was just not good. The curry was watery the noodles were hard. Not really delicious."}
{"text":"I have gone to this place maybe four times. It appears to be family run and I like that. The service has been pretty good. Prices fair. However the last time I went with a friend we found a hair in our food. The fellow who was serving stated that the \"hair\" was from a brush used to marinade my chili chicken.... That kind of grossed me right out. Since when did chili chicken have to be brushed? and ugh just yuch..... I was still charged for my hairy experience and that left a bad taste in my mouth ...."}
{"text":"Thai Food in Stouffville?! Should I be eating Fish and Chips?   Lunch Specials at Thai Villa is not cheap as they really have no competitions... so $8.25 it is for a   Pad Thai with Chicken, spring roll, soup and a drink  - I was a little worry at first about pad thai in ketchup..though the noodles looked really orangy but it is really tamarind sauce in heavy dose. The chicken though were white meat but was surprisingly tender.   Surprisingly Thai Villa was quite busy too! Sadly I could not have the restaurant all for myself which happened quite often.   The regular menu are quite extensive, so I would definitely to give it a try during dinner time!"}
{"text":"Went to this chain restaurant last night. It was clean and not  busy at all for a Friday. The service was very prompt and friendly. The beef satay appetizer was really chewy, but the rest of our dishes were good. The hot and sour soup was delicious and after the appetizer and a soup we easily could have shared one main dish. We ordered 2 main dishes and brought half of each one home, which made for a great lunch today! The pad Thai wasn't spicy at all but the coconut chicken rice with fried egg was too spicy for me, even though it is only 1 pepper, then again I really can't handle spice. The prices are decent and there is lots of free parking. Is is located in one of those unfortunate Smart Centre plazas with a Dollarama, Bouclair Home, Walmart, Bulk Barn, Staples and a few other businesses. Based on our experience we will be going back to this location for our Thai fix."}
{"text":"Cheap lunch specials. $8.5 comes with an entree of your choice,  complimentary soup & spring roll & a drink (pops or tea). Food was alright, not the best Thai food.   Only been at lunch, haven't tried the dinner menu. Friendly couple (I guess they may be the owner), and fast service.   Will come back for more lunch specials which are available on  weekdays and weekends too"}
{"text":"I went in here on an empty Tuesday afternoon while my little cousins were going to Popeye's next door.  I absolutely looooove Thai food and I knew it wouldn't be but I wasn't expecting this bad of a buzz kill, I should have just gone to Popeyes!  I ordered a Pad Thai and Druken Noodles to go (Pad See Ew)...my two staple favorites.  The noodles were dry and there wasn't enough sauce in either dish.  The sauces also were not authentic at all and tasted nothing like the millions of times I've had these dishes across the world.  The Druken Noodles also did not have the authentic super wide noodles.  Needless to say, I ate the popeyes over my noodle dishes from Thai Villa.  I will say that the owner and the cook were very nice and thats where the 2 stars come from!"}
{"text":"I feel sorry for those that have rated this place less than 4 stars. The food is great (chilli chicken, glass noodles, pad Thai). I have been coming here for the last 3 years and never once has my food been cold, full of salt, or overly sugary. I will continue to come here hopefully for at least the next few years. Not to mention the friendly staff and fast service no matter how busy the restaurant is."}
