{"text":"Great food! Staff super friendly and remember you each time. Come here every week! Recommend to anyone ! The sushi is amazing!"}
{"text":"I've been to Hillstones a few times.  The service just gets worse and slower.   It's is certainly pretty. But be prepared for poor service.  Go to Chelsea kitchen or steak44."}
{"text":"Yum, Yum Hillstone!!!  Things I love:  the smooth-as-butter, perfectly seasoned filet mignon, crisp, flavorful generous pours of white wine, the fresh, plump crab cakes and the packed with flavor, nutty and sweet cous cous.  My mouth waters thinking of it.  It's been our usual Friday night spot because the bar is beautiful and the patio is wonderfully designed to sit outdoors in the cool spring Arizona air and enjoy all that Hillstone has to offer on their menu.  Let's be clear about one thing however, not one thing on that menu can be on the low caloric side or even semi healthy..in fact, we learned that Hillstone is just Houstons (menu of course gave that away), but under a different name so the company doesn't have to release nutritional values...eeek!)  But I say so-what to that and enjoy this classy joint that offers high levels of fat and goodness.  I promise you won't regret it..."}
{"text":"I go here for their veggie burger which is incredible. I also love their apple crisp dessert. Only real problem is it's ALWAYS packed and I still don't think they take reservations so I've never not waited for a least 20 minutes. But food it great as well as their service so it's worth the wait."}
{"text":"We took a client to Hillstone for dinner. The place is beautiful and the service was great. The food was slightly better than bar food, but certainly not worth the prices they are charging. If you are an advocate of fine dinning: you will be sorely disappointed.  

Go there for drinks, enjoy the gorgeous ambiance, but go somewhere else for a nice dinner.

I had the Cod special of the day, thirty minutes after eating my stomach started feeling queazy and at 5am I was woken by uncontrollable......food poison symptoms! There were four other members of our party and their stomachs were fine, but they were not overly impressed with their meals. Everyone did enjoy the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Hillstone is a great Phoenix area restaurant!  The atmosphere and food is truly exceptional.  I would recommend it to anyone.  I would also like to thank the management for donating to the local charity I work for, it is great to see a restaurant that is truly invested in the Phoenix community.  Thanks again"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and wine prices. Not sure why I didn't give it a 5 star, but it is solid. The Thai Tuna roll is amazing, as are the ribs and french dip. Get the Stags Leap Petit Syrah for under $50 and call it a good day."}
{"text":"Even though the food here is amazing, I'm rating this place 3 stars because of the experience we had in the new location. I loved Houston's, and I think the only reason they moved locations & changed the name was some behind the scenes legal drama to prevent Houston's from being considered a large chain. So Hillstone... somehow seems more pretentious? We went on a Sunday night after 8 and the place was still packed. All the tiny booths next to the bar were empty though. So we head over, thinking it must be part of the bar, and the waitress steers us away and says that it's part of the dining room but they simply don't have enough servers to seat anyone there. And there's a 45 minute wait. My question is, why have the seating at all if you can't accomodate that many people in the restaurant? At least make it part of the bar.

We head out to the patio, which was fine because of the heaters, but then we come to find out they only serve appetizers out there, according to the waitress, because the kitchen is on the opposite end of the restaurant. Well, after we had ordered 3 appetizers at different times, I figured they might as well have walked to the kitchen to pick up what we actually wanted to eat, as I assume they were picking up appetizers there anyway.

Bummer."}
{"text":"Love their hamburgers, both regular ones and vege burgers. The staff, particularly at the bar, are great. (Tom and Al). The wine selection is good. Appetizers I love include the spinach artichoke dip and the grilled artichokes. Yum!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere at Hillstone, no matter which city or location, is always great!  Contemporary, sophisticated vibe in upscale room makes me want to return.  I ate by myself at the bar, but enjoyed chatting with the bar tender and the person next  to me.  I recommend the seared ahi!"}
{"text":"UPDATED 8/2017: My original review was three stars because of what I describe below. I have been there twice since and the service is better. They've definitely improved. Still kind of crazy with so many different people helping you but they have coordinated it a bit better.

-----------------------------------------------------

This review is for lunch on a Sunday. The food is good but the service is not. We've been here twice for lunch, once for dinner. The dinner service was good. The lunch service is quite poor. Keep in mind that the restaurant was not busy at all.

We were served by many different people. One of them identified himself as our waiter. Our waiter asked if we needed anything and we said we needed a couple minutes to check out the menu.

About 10 minutes later, he finally came back and took our order. After a reasonable amount of time (maybe 10 minutes), we got our food - delivered by two different people. Based on my previous experience, I knew I better ask for anything I needed right then. I asked for ketchup and the nice woman who handed me my plate said \"sure.\" She never came back.

After waiting about 5 minutes for someone to come by I finally flagged down someone walking by. I asked for the ketchup. It started to seem like he wasn't going to come back either but then he showed up with the ketchup.

My drink ran out and I was almost done with my meal before the waiter... who we hadn't seen since he took our order... came by and I asked for another drink. My partner's ice tea went empty and was not refilled until I flagged someone else down to fill it.

Ironically, the check came promptly, was processed promptly and the receipt was quickly picked up. If the service during the meal was as good as it was on the check, I would have been much more satisfied.

We're going to give it another try for dinner and see if it is truly just the lunch service that is lacking. 

Given the price and the number of staff they have (we were served by at least six people), there's no excuse for bad service."}
{"text":"A very decent restaurant. Great ambiance. Our waiter was courteous and even brought us a free appetizer since it was our first time in. The spinach artichoke is fantastic, and they bring out more chips for no extra charge if you need them. The sushi was great - they put their own spin on your everyday sushi roll. We tried the tuna mango and it was the perfect blend of sweet and spice. I ordered the California burger for lunch. Best burger I've had in a long time. Three other people came with me and they absolutely loved their dishes as well. The waiters/waitresses made sure our water glasses stayed full during our entire stay. It doesn't get any better than this.
The only downside to this place is we weren't sure where the entrance to the building was. But there's no \"wrong\" way to enter."}
{"text":"Edit:  my review was for Houston's, now closed down.  This place is exquisite.  Mind you, this is the first time I've been here.  However, after a fiasco at trying to get a downstairs seat at Rokerij and then traversing a couple of other places, the only place that delivered was Houston's.  I will say, this is the only bar/restaurant that has merited a 30% tip from me.  Though they were out of the first bottle of wine we selected, they offered a better wine for the same price.  Sweet.  EXCELLENT service and very good food and wine.  That, on top of a really nice low-key ambiance accented by dim lighting, was what earned my rare five-star review of Houston's."}
{"text":"This a wonderful place to take a date. It's very intimate dimly lit and romantic. Unfortunately I was working so, not such a great place to go with a bunch of co-workers. I still have love for you Hillstone."}
{"text":"Went in for lunch today. As I sat there, I talked with my friends at the table about how I rated this a 5 on Yelp, and was surprised to find people on here who rate it less just because it's a \"chain\" and therefore not deserving of a high rating.

The 3 of us sitting at the table all agreed that, given the price point, Houston's is deserving of a 5-star rating. Now, compare this to NOCA down the street... not a fair comparison - different ballpark entirely. For what it is: mid to mid-high level sit down restaurant, it's great.

The staff are all well groomed and well dressed. Everyone puts the guests needs as a top priority and the service is truly outstanding... even compared to some restaurants that are in a higher price bracket. Whatever Houston's is doing to train its staff, it does right. The staff here is great.

The food is consistently well above average. Today I had the fish sandwich for lunch. It was great. Well-cooked, moist fish. Definitely fresh, quality fish. The fries are great.

I'm sure I'll be back again. It's on the list of restaurants that get a repeat visit from me."}
{"text":"I'm baffled by these ratings - my experience was sub par at best. I  will not return for a second visit. Last night was my first time - it was Tuesday and we made a reservation for 8pm and waited till about 8:20 to be seated. The place was packed to the gills so we assumed this place had to be spectacular- Well the first thing I smelled when i walked in was like a dirty lake smell- eventually deciphered it was from the water feature on the front patio. The prices were crazy to me for the simple food on the menu- 20 dollars for a french dip sandwich and 20  for a sushi roll... Seriously? The waitress suggested we start with the spinach dip - apparently they are famous for it... The plate came out with packaged plain tortilla strips - and looked like it came out of Applebee's kitchen. Zero flavor and I could have eaten this out of my freezer on my couch at home vs. expecting to go to an upscale place and be disappointed. After deciding that the menu made absolutely zero sense and the prices just did not back up the food or experience we paid for our appetizer and left ... we went to  Central Bistro and had an amazing pizza for 12 bucks.. Poorly done Hillstone- not impressed"}
{"text":"Went to Hillstone for the second time on Thursday evening, and they are 2 for 2. The service was excellent, the food amazing, and the atmosphere very enjoyable!"}
{"text":"Just another Houston's with relatively the same menu offering. The space however is very modern and classy inside and outside. Solid good food. I am not a big fan of Middle Eastern food, but couscous here is light and refreshing. So I actually enjoyed it a great deal. The steak, as you can expect, was yummy. The noise level was a bit high for conversations. Next time I would go earlier in the day to avoid the crowd, thus the noise."}
{"text":"a fairly well put-together power spot attracting cougars during the lunch n brunch and old money for din din. 

good-to-great service, cleanliness, menu options, lighting, music, etc. price points are on the high side, but all Houston's are like this. great bar/patio. i dunno, just a solid expense account place with often delish albeit pricey food.

why not 5? meh, the food is about as good as chain restaurant food can get...but it's still salty, sugary, fatty restaurant food, so i can't give it a doing-backflips-over-this-amazing-culinary-achievement like a Green/Nami type place. because Hillstoner is not really innovative or particularly healthy. but it IS good, and once in awhile, good is good enough."}
{"text":"Tried their favorite sushi roll and can advise nothing to see here move along. Save your popcorn for the real star the Thai Steak Salad. 24 hours later I am still TiVo-ing the taste to my buds and reliving it all over again. One of those meals that you will never forget. Just perfection!"}
{"text":"Us 3 girls went for an early dinner here last Saturday night.  The service was horrible (more on that in a moment)  but the food and wine more than made up for it.  L had the trout special which was huge, seasoned impeccably and so flaky it melted in your mouth. P had the French Dip which is Houston's/Hillstone's signature sandwich.  It didn't disappoint.   However, both of my friends wished they had ordered my selection - the Hawaiian Ribeye.  OMG- I was in steak heaven! Imagine a prime cut of boneless ribeye- rubbed in pineapple and \"Hawaiian\" spices - don't know what the spices were - all I can say it was one of the best steaks I have ever had in my entire life (and I have had many great steaks). The description initially was a little weird for me but the final product- food for the gods!

Back to the service.  When we first arrived a very knowlegeable and cheerful waitress explained the menu and specials, took our appetizer and drink orders.  She disappeared and several minutes later a male waiter appeared stating that his co-worker had covered for him until he arrived.  He took our meal order and disappeared........ literally.   About 30 minutes later a third waitress - who did not smile and had no personality, delivered our food but forgot our drinks.  10 minutes later she brought out my companions drinks but forgot mine.  Seriously, it took another 10-15 minutes before I could find someone to flag down and ask what happened to my drink.  A couple minutes later it arrived via the robot waitress without an apology or any word at all.  Had it not been for the amazing chefs in the kitchen working their miracles I would have given this place one star.  

I personally thanked the chef who prepared my steak - he was very humble and appreciative.  I then explained about the service snafus to the manager who apologized .  
I definitely will return to Hillstone if only for the amazing food.  Hopefully - the service will be much improved."}
{"text":"Awesome experience and food.  My wife and I always dine are Hillstone when in Phoenix.   Service is on point, with a smile.  Sheree is as good as a server gets.  Not just from our server but every one that walks by our table made us feel special and always smiled.
The food is just as good as the service. The artichoke special was the best. We have a favorite back home but these artichokes were better.  We also split a wedge salad and they bring us 2 ice cold plates, perfect.  My wife always has to have the fries and they were perfectly cooked, crispy on the outside. Finished with sushi, being Japanese descent I normally only eat sushi at a quality Japanese restaurant but Hillstone excels here too.  A basic sushi menu but fresh fish presented beautifully.
We will be back."}
{"text":"The food is consistently delicious.  The martinis are just wonderful.  I've always enjoyed spectacular service.  Never a bad experience.
I am there to celebrate a special occasion, to recover from a rotten day or just because."}
{"text":"I've been here twice for lunch and have had an excellent experience both times. We had very attentive service and the taste and quality of the food is top notch. You will see the clientele is a mix of business formal attire and business casual. The lunches are around $20, and although this is more expensive than a typical lunch place in the area, the quality of the ingredients and very nice open atmosphere make this a place that you'll want to come back to again."}
{"text":"Worst customer service ever experienced! The hostess actually cut me off and blocked me because I was on the phone. She said i had to be off the phone to be seated and kept directing me back to reception. I got off the call and she said would u like to be seated now. No...actually I want to hang out in reception and not eat with already seated party. Really??? This is the customer service you get over a phone??? So aggressive and weird. Manager did Nothing!"}
{"text":"Chose Hillstone because we have always enjoyed the sister restaurant Houstons and were very impressed.   From the contemporary decor to the friendly staff to the delicious food Hillstone hit the mark.  The ribs were so tender with just the right sauce and seasoning, and the Hawaiian Ribeye was so flavorful.   

We were completely blown away when the friendly person who seated us came back mid-meal and introduced herself as the general manager, then told us that dinner was her treat!  WOW! This has never happened to us before and we eat out a lot.  We are so grateful for her generosity. She has earned our loyalty and we will be recommending Hillstone to all."}
{"text":"We had an amazing dining experience at Hillstones  for my wifes girlfriends  birthday . The service was impeccable ( Brittany , tall , attractive , possibly Gay ) , very attentive without being intrusive . The food was expertly prepared and presented. They have a nice wine list with plenty of options , That  happen to be 30 % cheaper than elsewhere . We tried the Kale salad, Artichoke dip , filet mignon , as well as the Rib eye . It was some of the best food and service  we have ever had and the experience was orgasmic . We are Fans for Life  and we will be back . Great Job Hillstones  ."}
{"text":"Hey Gabi M. wish we could agree. On our recent visit there, it became such a comedy of errors that they actually comp'd the entire meal.

A+ for design and architecture, nobody appreciates a fine terrazzo in the bathroom like we do, but D+ for food and service. 

Having said that, it is Hillstone (Houston's) and the one thing they are best known for is their impeccable consistency. 

We are more than confident that they will pull it together in short order and continue to succeed in their real business -- printing money."}
{"text":"My husband I joined friends there for lunch.  I had a fish dish which was delicious.  My husband had a roast beef sandwich which was amazing.  
We will go back next chance we get."}
{"text":"Great restaurant, so much so that my 65 year old father said it was \"one of the best restaurant bangs for the buck\" he's ever been to. The baked potato is epic. Get it. You will love it. Prime rib is excellent. Mini salad was a little too mini, but the beets, goat cheese, and dressing were supreme. Service was great too. Shout out to our server Michael (I think) and his upcoming wedding!"}
{"text":"I am writing concerning a comment that another reviewer made that he felt the clientele was heavily mid 40's  in age. I don't think the reviewer should even mention the age of the customers, as it has no bearing on the food etc. I have not eaten here, yet but found the reviews interesting."}
{"text":"Fantastic!! 

First and foremost, the service here is out of this world!! When you look up.. Bam!! Some is greeting you with a smile!! Food was awesome!! How dredging to find a great balance of what a true dining experience should be!! 

Our guest waitress Allison was so courteous and professional!! The general manger heard it was my visit and she brought over two fantastic deserts!! 

Well, my weekend is off to a great start thanks to everyone at Hillstone!! 

Ps: the music they play is just so soothing and makes you wanna chill!! 

Be back next week for sure!!!

Shahe"}
{"text":"Overall, I was not impressed. We love to go to Houston's, so we figured this would be a great spot as well. Menu was small, food was bland, and we felt ripped off with some of our items. Service was great and very friendly, atmosphere is nice, but food was lacking. We won't be back."}
{"text":"After the amazing dinner experience I had here, I truly can not believe that Hillstone doesn't have a 5 star rating! I loved everything about it. The food. The atmosphere. The service. All top notch! 

Since Tuesday nights are horrible for celebrating birthdays, my boyfriend treated me to dinner at Hillstone the following Saturday. We came around 7:00pm and were told there was an hour wait. (FYI, they don't take reservations). Luckily for us, there was one table open outside that we were able to relax at in the meantime. Never had I ever sat on a patio with air conditioning vents under the table, cooling your legs. Impressed from the start! A really nice, funny server took care of us as we had wine and french fries. At exactly the one hour mark, an inside booth was ready for us!

My bf had the Hillstone Burger with coleslaw. It was definitely worthy of being his only cheat meal of the week. There were multiple items on the menu that sounded great, but I ultimately ordered the Salmon with mashed potatoes and broccoli. Excellent choice, self! It was delicious. Another unique detail that I'd never seen before: Lemons were served in a cloth-like mesh bag to keep seeds from getting squeezed into your iced tea or food. 

Then...surprise! Our server brought out a hot fudge sundae (with a candle on top) and a Nordstrom box. As it turns out, my bf had sneakily ordered dessert and given her my birthday gift while I was in the restroom. I did not see that coming! Haha. It was such a big bowl of ice cream that we couldn't finish it, but I will say that getting to pour the chocolate sauce on yourself was pretty fun. 

All in all, it was a fabulous night and I'm so glad that a friend recommended Hillstone to us. I would definitely come back and suggest it to others for a special night out."}
{"text":"Wonderful service! These restaurants seem to be known for that. Our server was fantastic!

Loved the French Dip here (as always!). Theirs is the best I have had! We all ordered it at our table except for one person ordered the veggie burger, and he is still talking about it a week later. Yummy brownie dessert as well!"}
{"text":"Pretty darn good pork bbq sandwich.
Good service.
Laid back fun atmosphere.

I went for a late dinner on a weekday night.
Was spacey, not crowded at all, and food was relatively quick.

Parking is kinda tricky to figure out at first"}
{"text":"We made reservations about 40 minutes before we arrived at Hillstone.  The place was packed on a Monday night but we were seated within 5 minutes of our arrival.  I had the roast salmon, my son the prime rib.  Both were very well prepared and came out of the kitchen exactly the way they were ordered. Focaccia was an appetizer and was eaten with a glass of Merlot.  With a shared dessert, one coffee and a Coke, the bill came to a little over $120 with a generous tip for the impressive service. This is an imposing amount for a retiree but, probably, the going rate for s restaurant of this caliber.   I was impressed how well management handled the crowd, the kitchen and the service staff."}
{"text":"Great meal!! Crab cakes and asparagus were amazing. Our waitress India was amazing!! Offered suggestions that both me and my boyfriend got. No complaints. Coming back soon."}
{"text":"First time @ Hillstone and my experience here was amazing! Great food and Service (Katie). Will be back soon! Thanks for everything Katie and HBD!"}
{"text":"I frequent Houston's for dinner.  My office is in the Esplanade and I can walk there after work.  

As a favor to some of the previous reviewers, here are a few tips.

1.  Please be mindful of the placard at the entrance of the restaurant.  Hats, cut-off jeans, swim wear, sleeveless shirts, and cell phones are not allowed.  You may be able to get away with the cell phone; the dress code is strictly enforced.  Houston's is a unique restaurant that has a vast client base due to its ambience and food quality.  They respectfully request you to not wear your \"sweat pants\" and find a pair of jeans and polo.  

2.  Houston's has an innovative approach to service.  You do not have one waiter, you have a team of waiters.  This is to ensure your glass is always full an your well take care off.  Do not be offended if you see multiple servers.  As long as your being well taken care off, who cares?

They have an amazing veggie plate that includes fresh seasonal steamed veggies.  It changes frequently, but I am a huge fan.  

If you are in the mood for a steak, Houston's is a great place to be.  Another personal favorite."}
{"text":"Wow... I have been coming here for 10 years...and this something that I never discovered.  The outdoor patio tables have air condition vents under the table top.  Literally at the level of your hands and knees. Not to mention the food is phenomenal!"}
{"text":"Incredible food and priced appropriately. Staff is all very friendly and always paying attention to your needs. My boyfriend says it's the best Ribs he has ever had and he is from Iowa and knows home cookin'. I think the sushi is to die for and I'm very picky on my sushi (it's a texture thing). Tonight we spent $120 (including tip) for his ribs, my sushi and kale salad, 2 vodka waters and 2 crown on the rocks. Perfect evening!"}
{"text":"We tried to make a reservation for a party of seven and were told by Alecia that they could not accommodate us. She did not attempt to make alternate arrangements and was condescending in the process. We were extremely disappointed and will be taking our business elsewhere."}
{"text":"Love the outdoor patio area for relaxing and people watching.  I came for the French Dip sandwich but ordered the salmon instead.  Great meal and everything my friends and I ordered was delicious.  I vow to return to try the French Dip!"}
{"text":"It's Houston's what kind of revelation were you expecting? Uniformly excellent service administered by the manager \"T\", who is always gracious and helpful; and every dish prepared exactly the same way every time. My favorites are the Hawaiian Rib-eye, french dip, and Thai Beef and noodle salad. Ice tea is dark and fresh and cocktails are strong. Nice outdoor space for lunch as well, despite a bit of road noise from Camelback. I eat here at least once a month, typically more and have never had a bad meal or service. True, it's a chain a foodies like to bitch about \"the man\" but they do what they do very well."}
{"text":"I've been to Hillstone 5-6 times since they moved into this new building. First off, the building itself is awesome. The design and layout of the patio, bar, and main dining area is top notch. The servers that I've gotten have always been very attentive and friendly. I took my grandma there tonight (well to be honest I drove and she paid :) and she's 87 so she kind of rolls at a slower pace and doesn't always hear that well. Our server, Kiersten, was very patient and sweet about everything so it seems like they try to hire great people. I've had the French dip, Hawaiian rib-eye, cheese burger, and prime rib. All great. Tonight I subbed in the kale salad instead of the usual side and I recommend that as well. So, yes, this place should be on your list of restaurants to visit in the Biltmore area."}
{"text":"This has always been one of our go too restaurants.  On our last visit as we were enjoying the last bit of a bottle of wine.  Servers picked up 1/2 full water glasses, and swarmed our table, they wanted us out.  we were a party of 4 had enjoyed our dinner and we were just finishing up.  This was just flat out rude and very disappointing.  Since when should you feel rushed to finish your bottle of wine.  Not sure we will go back.  I expect great service.  There are plenty of great restaurants here in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was really nice: chic decor. Service was excellent, very attentive. We picked the wrong dishes though: tuna roll (odd taste since it had peanuts in it) and the seared artichoke (can only eat a small part of the dish).  The ribs were perfectly done. Overall, enjoyed the experience. We would come back and try other dishes. Their menu was very diverse, so worth trying different dishes. Great place to lounge and just have drinks."}
{"text":"I can't count how many times I've heard people say \"It's my favorite restaurant... even though it's chain\" about this restaurant. It's not a crime to like a place with more than one location, even though some chains suck. This one is unbelievable.

Everything is perfect! The service seems choreographed. Somehow you have a handful of people waiting on you, yet everything arrives on time and in front of the right person (why can't other restaurants keep track of who ordered what?).

The food is unbelievable. The menu is small because they only serve what they can do best. The ribs are to die for -- they just fall off the bone. Knife and fork only. The veggie burger is unbelievably good (bran base). The salads are huge but delicious (even though they sadly changed the name of the Evil Jungle Noodle Thai Steak Salad). The lemonade is sweet and pulpy, and the spinach dip puts all other dips to shame.

Houston's is my reference point: if a restaurant is more expensive, it had better be better than Houston's. Few meet that criterion.

p.s. get the warm brownie."}
{"text":"As I begin to write my review I realize the server I am about to disparage is gossiping with the hostess behind me discussing her discontent with her most recent tip. This is NO Houston's! What happened to ensuring a well manicured table, timely service, and a full glass of wine. Boo."}
{"text":"The food was great and it was a great way to celebrate!! It was one of the only places were you can relax and dine in luxury. The noise level was a little out of control but it is a working process. The wait was a little long but it was worth the wait! I had the Classic California roll and it was hard to get it all in one bite but when I did it was really good."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Hillstone. Try the Ahi, Osaka Style Pressed Sushi, French Dip and the Thai Tuna Roll, but you cant go wrong with anything since all of the food is delicious! The service is also completely on par."}
{"text":"Amazing Bartenders, awsome place to meet people if you're in your thirties and single (I met my wife there some years back now).  Food is just fine the menu is simple.  If you want a great meal go around the corner to Morton's.  

Great scene on Thursday and Friday nights, starting about 4:30 pm, but it's  completely done by 7:30 at the latest.  Tip your bartenders well and become a regular."}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about this place.  I love their Martinis, and I love that when you're halfway done with your Martini they bring over another cold glass to replace your existing warm one.  The service is outstanding.  The ribs are amazing, but for $30 they shouldn't be anything but.  I do agree that Hillstone is on the expensive side, but I believe you're getting what you pay for.  Even their sushi is some of the best in town.  It's certainly my favorite.  Is it expensive?  Yes it is, but it's also amazing.  At $13-$21 a roll, it better be damn good!  The cheeseburger and chicken sandwich are very good as well.  You really can't go wrong here.  If you don't like it....I'm thinking the problem isn't the restaurant."}
{"text":"We had a truly memorable evening at Hillstone tonight. The wait staff were absolutely outstanding, and the food was perhaps the best meal we've had. Period.

The salad and focaccia bread we shared as an appetizer set the tone for the entrees. Salmon with mashed potatoes and broccoli for my wife, BBQ ribs for me. We shared portions of each with each other, and agreed that both were exquisitely prepared and tasted out-of-this-world good. 

We are in the Phoenix area on vacation from Minnesota, and we won't hesitate to highly recommend Hillstone to anyone looking for a first-class dining experience. Bravo!!!

My wife insists I say that we're not getting paid to write this...."}
{"text":"Rib Eye from the Islands of Hawaii is on the MONEY ..."}
{"text":"I have been twice in a month which is a definite +  Both times the food great, perfectly cooked prime rib, sides delicious. Spicy tuna roll great, margaritas nice but a little small. Service great first time, second time everyone but my waitress took care of me lol, had to give tip to the person I saw the most. This is the only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5. I will go back soon, prob will sit at bar and avoid that all together."}
{"text":"C'mon man! Really! Your killing me! 
Houston's is such a great food and service oriented establishment that I was excited to take my wife there for her birthday. We were seated right away and the waiter was quick to ask for the drink order. We ordered wine by the glass. I like the service as far as they give, they change out your settings and take away the dishes in an anonymous way. We started with the artichoke, which was a special that night. Really good of course like Bandaras. The sauce was different, but we really enjoyed it. 

The Mrs ordered the Hawaiian ribeye with a weird lemon flavored caesar salad. I had the special NY strip steak Medium rare. We got our wine OK and they stopped by a few times to check on us. We got our entrees and everything looked great. The steaks were good size. The Hawaiian Ribeye was thinner than most ribeye cuts and had a Hawaiian sauce. Mehhhh very so so! The Strip came full of taste but a little tough. It came with fries which were awesome! I wish I had some bread or somethin... After the food came, it was like we were on an island. No one came until we were almost done. The Mrs. needed a refill and they took the glass away, but never asked if we would like another round. Bummer... C.mon - I drop over a Cnote and I cannot get another wine! Someone?... It was like they were just tryin to get us outta there. Boooo!

The vibe was awesome! The interior is great! Next time, I want to go sit at the bar with all the cougars and people wandering in from the patio looking for the front desk - that makes for good people watching. 

We skipped desert there and went to Culvers for frozen custard!"}
{"text":"While my meal was decent enough, despite being of smaller portions and of higher prices than I remember, I was slightly perturbed about other diners around me complaining and receiving poor service, something which I've never experienced at Hillstone's former location down the road Houston's.

Service seemed to be sometimes a mix between neglectful and confused. Hopefully they will remedy this, because it's rather disconcerting to be served well across the aisle from a grumpy couple eying me down and complaining amongst themselves.

I'm not sure if I'll return to give it another try. This definitely isn't the Houston's that I remember. As was mentioned in another review, this place seems to be under new management that doesn't appear to be able to handle such a restaurant."}
{"text":"Food and service was amazing. Our server, Denise, was friendly and made our evening. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I was a fan and frequent customer at Houstons.   After two visits, I am so unimpressed with Hillstone that I won't return.

I will focus on my biggest disappointment.    I used to love their veggies.   They were awesome.    Whatever else I ordered, the veggies were a \"must.\"   One of my favorites was their cauliflower.   It was lightly breaded, crisp, and perfectly seasoned.    Now, the portion is smaller, and the cauliflower is rubbery.    What's fun about that?

I could cite other details, but everything pretty much follows the same theme:  Smaller Portions.   Lesser Quality.    A business model that is pretty hard to understand with the out-of-the-gate popularity of the place."}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants in Phoenix.  I take all my guests here when they visit town."}
{"text":"Tom the bartender is first rate. Always always always get the chicken fingers with honey mustard... sounds basic, but Hillstone's is better."}
{"text":"My daughter and I ate here for the first time. We loved it!! Our server Jimmy did an amazing job. The food was amazing,  we had a hot fudge sundae for dessert,  the best ever!! Definitely a must have. We will definitely be back!!! :)"}
{"text":"Christmas dinner (again?) at the Hillstone! It was a late decision to finally pick this place, how late? We could only get reservation either at 5:15pm or 8:30pm, yeah... So we decided to be the early birds and arrived at 5:15pm, and wow, this place is quite full, and it's a very mixed crowd at 5pm, you can see family with young children, couples, and friends or colleagues, this has to be good, right?

The restaurant itself is very big, plus a big patio/outdoor seating. Interior lighting is to the dark side in my opinion, but at least the tables are not so close to each other, the seating arrangements were nicely done that you would feel spacious.

After a few minutes of discussion, three of us decided to share the Smoked Salmon appetizer, two had the Hawaiian Ribeye and I took the waiter's recommendation,  Loup de Mar it is! So here is a bit recap:

Thai Tuna Sushi Roll - No, we did not order this, yet it somehow showed up on our table when the waiter decided to say it's on the house (but we all know they must have made a mistake on orders), but hey, it's free, we can at least have a try! Interesting enough, this sushi roll had a thinly and a little shinny rice paper wrapped outside of the rice, I assume it can keep the roll stay in shape, and it's a little chewy. This roll was to our surprise, pretty good! It has a taste of coconut, macadamia nuts, jalapeno and avocado. The sweetness and spiciness went well together!

Hawaiian Ribeye - Both medium rare steak came to the table with some 'serious burns', it was later I found out that's caused by the sweet glaze outside of the steak. The steak was cooked well, but a bit too sweet for me, and the baked potato was very big!

Loup de Mar - Grilled Seabass with Butternut Squash over some mariana/tomato sauce, very good combination! However, I personally dislike the presentation of this dish. First, I had expected to see a filet of seabass, instead, i got this center-opened, tilapia looking fish with skin and TAIL, was it all necessary? And the randomness of so many crushed pieces of almonds all over the fish, I guess i shouldn't have too much expectation. But really, I thought you would only see fish tails in Chinese food, lol. The fish was cooked a bit oily, to my guess, because it had the skin on, you just need some extra oil to prevent it sticking on the pan.  I was very glad on choosing the butternut squash, with the sourness from mariana/ tomato sauce, it complimented well with the a bit oily fish. 

Smoked salmon appetizer - We all really liked this! The fish was so soft that it just melted to your mouse like a salmon-flavored butter. Really wish we could have this before the entree!  BUT, our seem-to-be-in-a-rush waiter literally grabbed the plate with 1/3 of fish left, without asking, and took off... excuse me? If we didn't receive the dish until later, at least give us a bit more time to eat!

So this is the order of how we have received our food, the appetizer we actually ordered came 5 mins after the entrees were served.

Service overall was attentive, however, the waiter or kitchen staff first messed up our appetizer order with another table, although we took a freebie, our actual appetizer didn't come till we already started eating the main dishes. Then the waiter took the unfinished dish without asking, and some other helper came to grab my plate, then asked if i was done, it was only 6:30 by the time we were done, why are you guys in such a hurry? I know you want to clean out the finished plates, but next time, please ask before you have your hand on the plate!

With both of the appetizers being very nice, a just a-ok for entrees, and somewhat 'interesting' serving staff, I couldn't pass to give a 3-star rating."}
{"text":"We heard a lot of hype around this place, and were concerned about taking a risk on Valentine's Day,  but we were not disappointed.  It was amazing! We had the Rainbow roll sushi to start and it was the best we've ever had, the tenderloin I had for dinner was remarkable in that it too was the best I've had. I'm on a permanent mission to find a steak better than I can make at home; from Manhattan NY, to Chicago,  Miami, Denver, Calgary and beyond,  I've not met my match until NOW. I'm only sad it's in another state from my home. Bravo Hillstone!"}
{"text":"Jill, Tom and Al are the very best and provide A+ service consistently. The food is second to none."}
{"text":"Two center cut filets, arctic char (split) and cold perrier with lime.  The steaks were cooked perfectly.  The char has been better, but it was still exceptional and the spicy corn and baked potato (with everything but the bacon) was awesome!  Service was prompt and considerate - always love it here!"}
{"text":"We came here today for lunch for my brother James' Bday.

The lighting is very dim inside which I liked. The decor is modern cowboy, not my style but the chairs we sat in were comfy.

There were 6 of us at the table & we all ordered the iced tea, expect my mom who always orders a sprite. We all agreed their iced tea was delicious. For our entrees: 3 ordered the Famous French Dip Au Jus, 2 ordered the Fresh Fish Sandwich & I ordered the Club Sandwich. All came with a side of \"shoestring\" cut fries. The French Dip was overall liked except one said his was a bit dry. The Fish Sandwich was the favorite among the entrees. My Club Sandwich was mediocre at best, nothing special. I'm not sure what the others thought (well besides my mom) but I loved the fries. I ate all of mine!

Overall this place is nice but the food is way over-priced. I think I would have enjoyed my meal more if I had ordered a steak or even a burger but I don't think I will be coming back to find out."}
{"text":"Holy steroids batman, when did you start taking DHEA?
This is my new date place. Great food, good to great service and atmosphere. 
For an upper priced/higher tiered restaurant this is really, really good. I've had just about everything on the menu but I usually order one of the specials which is usually a fresh seafood choice. Never a bad meal, always fresh veggies which are usually cooked al dente. The fish is as fresh as it gets in Phoenix/Scottsdale........probably three to five days from sea to table. 
I think they are trying to source their kitchen locally which really appeals to me. One of the servers was talking about the fresh pecans they got from Tucson and they were using it on a desert. 
The main crowd is the see-me set but that doesn't bother me. Plenty of professionals, families and couples. A good eclectic mix. 
They don't take reservations and they won't seat you unless your entire party is with you. 
The bar is really good. The guy who made my drink was experienced and has many tools at his disposal to make the really great cocktails that you always heard about but you've never experienced. If you want to have a Singapore sling, it will be made from scratch like they do at the Raffles hotel in Singapore(not premixed sugar crap). This is the place to order a tom collins, whiskey sour or even a mojito( they actually muddle the mint)Good scotch collection, not great. 
One other thing, I went there for lunch with a business associate of mine and there must have been a special on the hamburger because every person I saw in there was eating the burger. And, there were a lot of people in there. I would say its a 4 star burger. 
Bon Apetite!"}
{"text":"Wonderful restaurant!  Love the food! We have never had something bad at Hillstone. Our last visit we had the focaccia bread appetizer, sushi, the French dip sandwich....all were delicious.  Love the warm atmosphere too.  We have always found the staff wonderful, but our last visit just a few weeks ago was exceptional.  Haleigh was our server and was so excellent.  She spent time with us giving us suggestions with the menu and was very helpful.  We told her we love the French dip sandwich but wished it was in a appetizer portion as we didn't want to have it for our meal....and a few minutes later she brought us that very sandwich on the house.  She was wonderful, professional, sweet and helpful.  We will definitely be back and will request her."}
{"text":"Houston's is a great upscale rib chain. The location at the Camelback Esplenade is a really nice location (although I've never been to any other location so I can't make comparisons). The place has a great atmosphere; the dim lighting really works. There are often long waits during peak times, but there's a tunnel to Biltmore Fashion Park across the street, so you can kill a little time if you have a really long wait. The service can be a little slow, as it was on my last visit back in December, but the servers are good. I have to say, I've never had the ribs before, but I've heard that they are outstanding. Next time I'm in Phoenix, I'll have to try them. My favorite thing here is the Hickory Burger. It is excellent. It's a burger topped with Canadian bacon, cheddar cheese, and smothered with barbecue sauce. Shoestring fries accompany the burger. The burger just tastes really good. The combination of the barbecue sauce and cheese on the underlying patty works really well. The meat tastes great too, which helps. The bacon also adds to it. The fries are really good here; you have a selection of sides, but the fries are definitely the best choice. They're really thin, but they're full of flavor. I had the Apple Walnut Cobbler for dessert. It's huge! Everything about it was outstanding. The apples with the walnuts, the ice cream, it was all good. Overall, if you're looking for a really good, upscale American place in the Valley, head to Houston's either on Camelback or Scottsdale. It's worth it. Now if only they'd open up a location in NE Ohio (there are a lot of great chains with Valley locations that aren't in Cleveland)."}
{"text":"Great place for a business lunch.  The service is excellent and the food is great.  It is a little on the expensive side, but it's very good."}

I went to Hillstone last Sunday with a friend because of their delicious food and excellent service.  I ordered a lemon drop martini and was still sipping on it when the food arrived.  Then our server, Christina, did something amazing.  She appeared with a new cold martini glass and proceeded to pour my drink into the fresh glass!  Wow!  Great food with exceptional service keeps me coming back."}
{"text":"Their food was super delish. Their portions were huge so next time I prob would have split the plate. Def would go again"}
{"text":"Wonderful food, great service, the manager Joe was extremely accommodating!  Can't wait to dine again at Hillstone."}
{"text":"I went there for lunch and was exciting about eating there.  I have never been to the restaurant and when I walked in I was impressed with the layout of the restaurant.  Our waiter was friendly and came over right away to offer us drinks. 

The menu is rather pricey so I decided to order a chicken waldorf salad and my co-worker ordered a chicken caesar salad.  When we received our salads the first thing we noticed was that the chicken was pink in both of the salads and it appeared that it had not been cooked enough.  The chicken caesar salad is supposed to come with croutons and it did not.  The chicken waldorf salad was ok but the pinkness in the chicken did bother me.  My co-worker and I should have sent the salads back.  

After we got back to the office, we both commented that our stomachs were a little queasy.  I will definitely not be back to the restaurant.  It is way over priced and I believe that if you are going to pay more for your food it should be amazing.  I can make a better salad at home.  Overall I was disappointed with my first dining experience at Hillstone."}
{"text":"This was my first ever fancy steak house dinner. I'm an outback girl. I'm from Florida. I've never been to Charley's or Ruth Chris, this was a first and it was phenomenal. The service was top notch.... I mean, they gave me a new chilled martini glass when mine was no longer cold because I was milking it (it was a little strong). We weren't dressed up like other people & were younger and didn't feel judged at all. The steak literally melted in my mouth & had the most amazing flavor (I got the Hawaiian rib eye) and we also got dessert which came with a ladle of hot fudge. This place was so delicious and I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I've always been a fan of Houston's and I am a fan of Hillstone. I've dined there 3 times since it has opened.

The new location is great (albeit some what confusing to find the entrance - head to the northside of the building -counterintuitive to a building fronting Camelback Road). Love the ambiance on the patio and the bar area, dining room is okay (not a fan of the artwork).

Food is consistently good. (Yes, portions are somewhat smaller than the old Houston's.) The prime french dip and fries are a favorite. Fish is always fresh and its nice that sushi was added to the menu (not amazing, but a solid option). Salads are crispy. Overall a solid dining experience.

Bar service is great - fast and friendly. Dining room service could tighten up, but give the service team a break and allow them to adjust to the new digs. 

For the whinners that have reviewed Hillstone - please stay away. That much faster for everyone else to be seated."}
{"text":"Houston's is incredible!!!!!! Spinach artichoke dip so good the incredible filet mignon. Like butter and delicious. Service was excellent and the food was brought out with perfect timing. What a great place that I can't wait to visit again."}
{"text":"The New York strip is the best steak in Phoenix, AZ. The loaded baked potato is magical in it's saltiness and smooth buttery-sour cream richness. The service is prompt and professional. The restaurant is housed in a beautiful building. The draft beer is a perfect temperature. The apple walnut cobbler is a force onto itself."}
{"text":"went to hillstone with a large group resturant is very nice and lots of favorites from the houston menu but the place really can't seat groups larger then 4 maybe 5 ...ended up in 2 booths separate checks separate waiters.we like to share items so that didn't work out and our patio bill got but onto one check...so one table finished up early the other sat around waiting for the check. i have to say the food was excellent and the decor and patio were nice.."}
{"text":"The Hillstone never seems to let us down. We have been coming here for a number of times since I met my husband over the years and this place has been nothing but great every single time we have been there. Yes they can be kind of overpriced with their $15 dollars sushi but everything on their menu is delicious the Quality and Flavor are worth the money.

My personal favorite is the Hawaiian Ribeye, that amazing marinade punches you with tons of delicious flavor. The Baked Potato is also delicious. With this restaurant nothing seems to disappoint we have ordered several different plates over the years such as the ribs, chicken, tuna sushi, French Dip Sandwich, Spinach Dip and everything is just splendid. The Hillstone is one of my favorite restaurants in Phoenix because of the AWESOME food and Atmosphere."}
{"text":"Still my go to when I am in Phoenix. Same menu as Houston's plus sushi. Some items may have gone up a buck or two, but still fairly reasonable. 

Service was great, I appreciate how they always have a team of people bring out all the meals at the same time.

The new facilities are great. The bar has plenty of seating and the outdoor patio is nice and large."}
{"text":"Hillstone, while on the pricey side, is worth every penny. The service and food are both above par. Though the name wouldn't imply that sushi is a specialty item of theirs, it should NOT be missed! Also, the crispy fish sandwich is delish as well. The only complaint that I have about Hillstone is the lack of Happy Hour. My girlfriends and I would frequent the place more often for afternoon chat sessions but right now, we would break the bank! Hillstone has a trendy feel - especially the bar / patio area but the service and food prove that this place isn't just here for a minute. Give it a try!"}
{"text":"The food is delicious, especially the veggie burger.  It's one of the best that I've had.  I also recommend the spicy tuna roll and Thai steak and noodle salad."}
{"text":"NINJA CALIBER, this spot right here is is the kill from head to toes ,teeth and nose. So the atmosphere is old school wood grain business \"old-fashion\" drinkin (their  old-fashion is perfect BTW) MR boss shit. You can go in a business suit or just look-in like a fly dot.com shark. The chilliest place for business meetings, and nice dinners with the wife. Or you can straight bag yourself a cougar in the bar area. But let me tell you about the food, that shit , the menu is a master piece ; everything is good but the sushi makes Japan feel like they are not doin something right. 5 stars , hands down."}
{"text":"Utter failure of management and customer service on March 17 during a dinner with major clients.  They couldn't seat our party together despite a reservation made weeks in advance. Manager made it worse when they refused to allow our clients to visit with us for five minutes AFTER our meal was complete and we were sharing a final toast.  Manager escalated the problem instead of trying to resolve it.  The rudest service ever.  Thanks for a decent meal, but we'll take our $1,000 dinner somewhere else next time."}
{"text":"Some of the best ribs in the valley!  We love many things about Hillstone except the wait if you don't have a reservation on the weekends.  The French Dip and the Campfire Ribs are awesome as are the fish options!  I even love their little house salad to start!  The chefs are fun to watch and very friendly. The margarita is also amazing!  We go often but def recommend reservations or go early!"}
{"text":"It pains me to write this review as Hillstone, formerly Houston's, has been one of my favorite places to eat for the past 20 years. The food and service have always been delicious and dependable. However, my last visit left me and my boyfriend with such a sour taste in our mouths, I am unsure we will return. 

We arrived on a busy Thursday evening, hoping to sit in the bar area. We enjoy the lively scene and people watching. We figured we'd have to wait a bit, which we have done on countless occasions. There was one seat available so I sat and we were greeted by \"Al.\" Seemed like a nice enough guy, very friendly and quickly served us our first round of cocktails. We asked \"Al\" to keep an eye out for us as we were wanting to have dinner at the bar, he said, \"We'll get you seated, no problem.\" After my boyfriend ordered his second cocktail, we noticed \"Al\" greeting two of his regular customers that had just walked into the bar area. He walked out from behind the bar and greeted them with handshakes. There was a small high top they sat down at, too small for dinner, but would do for drinks. As he walked back behind the bar to retrieve their bottle of wine, I saw him hold up two fingers to the other bartender. Within 5 minutes we noticed them sitting down at the other side of the bar where two people had just got up. After watching this all go down right in front of us, my boyfriend asked \"Al\" for our bill. He had a surprised look on his face that we were leaving, since we told him we intended to have dinner. I told him we saw what transpired with his other preferred guests. He quickly apologized and offered to buy us our drinks. When my boyfriend declined and said we would take our business elsewhere, he came out from behind the bar and continued to apologize and offered to buy us dinner. We declined and left money on the bar for our drinks. How could we enjoy a meal after he made it clear the business of his regular customers was more important that ours? 

Fortunately, we did end up having a lovely dinner down the road at Mastro's City Hall. The bar area was very full and we ordered a couple of drinks and waited for a spot to open up at the bar to eat. Our bartender \"Christian\" looked out for us and we were seated after about 25 minutes. We enjoyed an amazing steak dinner and were treated with first class service by \"Christian.\" We will be back to City Hall, not so sure about Hillstone. Truly a shame."}
{"text":"I have two addenda to Mark D.'s \"Veggie Burger Fix\" list.

First is the veggie burger at Houston's.  I tried it because of yelpers' recommendations.  Thank you!  It was excellent.  It's a homemade, black bean-based patty.  It's moist (although I hate that word.  But it is.) and a perfect texture -- it doesn't feel meaty in your mouth, but it's substantial.  It's just right.  I wasn't a fan of the fries, but I didn't need to get to those because the burger was so big.

I also liked that the server enthusiastically supported my choice of a veggie burger (at a ribs and burger place) rather than poo pooing it.  I realize that is server-specific, but props to my server for singing the praises of the Houston's veggie burger when I ordered it.  Not having to defend my dinner selection makes a difference in my overall enjoyment of my meal.

Thanks to the yelpers who suggested this!  And thanks to Houston's for having a REALLY good veggie burger on your menu!"}
{"text":"It was great. We ate on the patio the first evening. Then went back with friends and sat in the dinning room. Great atmosphere and great food. Excellent wine list. They even gave us French fries while we waited for our table and watched the busy kitchen. Highly recommend it!!!"}
{"text":"love houstons...they have the WORLDS best Veggie burger!!! if you dont eat meat you will lovvvveeeeee it! its a bit pricey....and sometime you have to wait a while....but hey its not the end of the world!"}
{"text":"This place was awesome! The French dip with Au Ju is amazing! Great service, great location."}
{"text":"Food was excellent. I was slightly disappointed that my fish was a little over cooked. My waitress was ill prepared and did not keep up with my table."}
{"text":"My favorite lunch place.
Team at bar very helpful, friendly and cares about their patrons."}
{"text":"Hands down the best tenderloin in town.  Service, ambiance and food can't be beat!!! Wine list is extensive."}
{"text":"I used to love going to Houston's at the Esplanade - even my 3 year old son said it was his favorite restaurant.  After moving to their new location, I have been there twice and have been very disappointed.  Although the food is still very good (I love the grilled artichokes, French dip sandwich and baby back ribs), the service has gone downhill.  Both times we were waiting way too long for our food.  We also had to ask multiple times for items that were ordered to be brought to the table before we just cancelled the order completely.  

As much as used to love this place, I will not be going back as much as I did before (usually once or twice a week).  I am hoping they will get there service back to where it used to be!"}
{"text":"This was our first time to the restaurant since they moved across the street  and changed the name to Hillstone.  The lunch menu is similar to the old Houston's menu, though it appeared to have some minor changes.

Our service today, unlike what some have reported here, was fine.  In fact, if anything multiple members of the staff seemed to go overboard and checking up on us and finding if any issues existed at very regular intervals.

As we stopped by for lunch on Sunday, I just grabbed the hickory burger and cole slaw, while my wife had the salmon with roasted beets.  The food was up to the standards of the old Houston's.  My wife also tried out the sushi (she goes for that sort of thing--I generally don't) and she was relatively impressed.

The new building is similar in layout and design to the old location, but much brighter than the former Esplanade location, now sporting outside seating in the bar area.  There's even a bit of a skylight on the west end of the facility.  Right now it helps show off the local weather, though we'll have to see how well the new design handles Phoenix summers.

For those who haven't been around in a while, the building is a new one, located on the site where the old Chevy's on Camelback used to be--just to the east of the Chase Bank on the north side of Camelback."}
{"text":"This has been my favorite restaurant for about 20 years (obviously when they were called Houston's too).   I've eaten at the newer and older location about 100 times (combined). I have had 2 or 3 occasions that I felt were subpar but I realize everyone has an off-day here and there.  Still my favorite!!!"}
{"text":"Super commercial, but definitely the best veggie burger in town! Seriously, no other restaurant even comes close to this one."}
{"text":"I was really disappointed in this restaurant. Its another fusion restaurant where the combined sum is less than its parts. 

What place serves sushi but no sake or plum wine? The steak was nice but boring. Nothing that differentiated it from any other steak joint. Certainly didn't justify the price. 

Lastly the service was horrendous. The host was dismissive, the waitress rude and completely forgot our drink order. 

Given the hype, I was left wanting a lot more."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Went here for my Mom's 86th birthday. Got there early to beat the crowd. Iceberg wedge salad and steaks were the perfect according to my family. I had the veggie burger which is the best in town. The baked potatoes are the best we ever had. They told me on the phone they would give my Mom a complimentary dessert for her birthday. The waiter set THREE desserts in front of us!!! Hot fudge sundae, key lime pie, and apple cobbler. That was a huge surprise and my Mom felt super special. Best restaurant for atmosphere, food, and service. Highly recommend you check it out!"}
{"text":"WOW.  LOVE this place!  Sexy, relaxed, causal but elegant - this is Phoenix dining at its best!  And Sushi!!!  And great Sushi - it's true!  And check out the Hawaiian Ribeye steak - fabulous.  And don't forget the strawberry shortbread - still thinking about it.  Staff is friendly, and know their food and wines - not stuffy, just right.  Do yourself a favor and dine there NOW."}
{"text":"Consistently great food and great service! This location is much nicer than the old Houston's that was in The Esplanade! :)"}
{"text":"Service-- our server was probably new, she was a bit awkward. my dad wanted to order a Bud Light and she kept pushing all these beers with elaborate descriptions. Lady, just suggest a light beer and be done... That's what's preventing the 5 star review.

Food. THE FOOD. I had the sushi with mango and tuna, and another roll that had coconut. I can't remember what it was but it was delicious and surprising for a steak place. My brother ordered a sirloin that was nicely seasoned, and the Hawaiian rib eye was fantastic-- just maybe a tad sweet for what I wanted.

Definitely will be back the next time I want to treat someone/wow an out of town visitor."}
{"text":"Really great food. Service was awesome and never had to wait for anything. If anything, the night felt like it went too quick!"}
{"text":"Very loud and boisterous and bustling, and thankfully we had a reservation, but spent a great evening here!  The service was fantastic, the food and drinks came out in a timely manner, and there doesn't really seem to be a bad seat in the house.  I went simple and had the cheeseburger and I'm still dreaming about the next time I can go back and have another, it was fantastic.  And then I doubled down and had the brownie and thought I'd died and gone to heaven.  And the wine list was pretty big with some interesting options.  I would go back in a second, just really decent American cuisine well-prepared and served with style."}
{"text":"The spinach artichoke dip is amazing. The steaks are cooked to perfection as well. Everything I have ever eaten here was delicious I just wish they had a slightly bigger menu. My family loves to eat here because of the ribs so we eat here a lot but I'm not much of a pork guy so the menu seems a bit limited.  5 stars if they can just add a few more beef items other than the 2 steaks and the prime rib sandwich."}
{"text":"The menu here is the best!! Honestly, there is nothing you can get on it and go wrong with, but I do have my favorites!

Hands down the best thing on the menu is the chicken sandwich. SOOOO good. I don't think I can come here without getting it. However, if you are looking for a lighter option, the pressed sushi is probably the second best thing on the menu. It is 4 large pieces and comes with a salad, if you aren't too hungry it is probably enough for dinner! 

They also have a really nice outdoor patio area to eat on. If the weather is nice, I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"It wasn't bad, it just could have been better. You cannot build a beautiful space and then just expect that you can get by on \"meh\"

The wow doesn't last"}
{"text":"So...my fiancé  and I road tripped our way to Scottsdale to knock out the 'Arizona' Hillstone/Bandera we had yet to visit. Went to Hillstone for an early dinner before catching the MAVS game. Charlotte was our waitress. She was awesome. So was the smoked salmon, veggie plate and burger that we scarfed down. 
This location was phenom. The architecture was beautiful. Loved the open bar concept and the sculpture. Really added a special ambiance to the evening. 
Above and beyond as usual!!"}
{"text":"Honestly. Won't go back. Totally inflexible regarding the menu. Explain why this can't happen. They were out of salmon poke. So I asked for spicy tuna poke which they clearly have because several rolls are spicy tuna based. The manager said they can't be flexible because it's not on the menu. What!!!!  Spicy tuna is all over the menu.  Just won't serve it they way I asked - no rice.  Not hard to do. ."}
{"text":"We use to live @ 24th and Camelback, so being acquainted  with the vast amount of restaurants in the area was a simple effort.  Without exception,  Hillstone is the best casual restaurant in the valley.  Our only regret is that we have moved to North Scottsdale, but the hour round trip is time well invested.  Thank you Hillstone."}
{"text":"Food is amazing! You have to try the smoked salmon appetizer. Wow! It was very busy at 11:30 am on a Monday. We waited 20+ minutes for a table but had appetizers on the patio. Only disappointment was that we couldn't order main courses on the patio (appetizers only) and indoors was so loud we could barely hear each other talk. I definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"I love the casual ambience of Hillstone's. The food and service are excellent. I love the kale salad and sushi. We enjoy sitting outside on the patio by the humongous fireplace ~ very romantic. This is definitely the place I would bring good friends for a relaxing and enjoyable evening. When I bring visitors from out of town, they absolutely love the atmosphere. Most people have not experienced the impeccable service that Hillstone's offers."}
{"text":"To put this review in context, I was looking for a meal in the same vein as Ruth's Chris's or Morton's steakhouse.  Having eaten at Houston's (in Houston), I thought this would be a great place to get a steak.  I was probably shooting a little high.  Service was good, but there were issues with the food.  First off they ran out of baked potatoes, not a big deal but perhaps a little foreshadowing?  The Steak came out with no red in the center, probably a solid medium.  The redone steak came out a little more pink (not red), but still did not have the deep, meaty flavor I was craving.  The Fish sandwich we ordered was good, as were the cole slaw and broccoli sides.  In other words, I would come back here for lunch (the fish sandwich), but not the steak.  I can't comment on the sushi, maybe this is what they are concentrating on.  I would not avoid this place, but it certainly isn't worth going out of my way to visit."}
{"text":"Service is always nice, professional and prompt!  Management is very accommodating and the food is always consistently great!"}
{"text":"Service top notch
Outdoor seating great
I had the baileys hot chocolate really good
Oysters greasy
Artichoke dip average
Food was wanting"}
{"text":"While your visiting the Phoenix, Arizona area you may want to stop by the Biltmore Mall and checkout all the shops and restaurants in the center. There are many restaurants to meet up at. I met an old friend at Hillstone in Phoenix. My burger was very good but was also $14. Whew this place was pricey with a strict dress code. If you are entertaining and trying to impress someone this is the place. A little pricey for my tastes but wonderful food! Make sure you dress to impress and if need be there is also a valet at the restaurant!"}
{"text":"Yeah, it's a chain and I'm not normally a fan of chains, but Houston's always hits the spot and I've never had a bad meal there. I think Houston's is the most consistent restaurant that I've ever been to and I've been dining at various locations of Houston's since I was a kid. Since I've lived in PHX, the Biltmore location has been my home base and I eat there several times a month. Most of the time, we come in for a late dinner and sit at the bar and let Tom and Al take care of us. These two are among the best bartenders in the Valley and will remember your drink of choice and other preferences after just a few visits."}
{"text":"My husband and I were formerly Houston's Fans.  We were not wowed when Hillstone first opened because we expected that the old food recipes would carry over.  Obviously, when a beloved restaurant for the food and service is closed or changed it is like losing a boyfriend of girlfriend!  Life will never be the same.

A few months ago, I brought my sister in for lunch and we ordered the special,  Loup de Mer with Marcona almonds (it is now listed on the menu) and the sautéed Swiss chard.  Wow!  It was fabulous. The fish was moist and flavorful and the skin crisped!  As always, the vegetable sides are creative and flavorful.  My 5 year old niece ignored her gigantic adult size burger and dug into her mother's fish.  Obviously her mother was ecstatic!  

My husband and I are now finding that Hillstone is our go to restaurant for hamburgers, French prime dip, and the fish again.  My husband had the chicken salad this past weekend and loved it.  Also, the kale salad with a hint of mint is very addictive.

The service, especially at the bar, has risen to Houston's quality service both friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Amazing food and service. I highly recommend it. They were all delicious. The staff is very friendly, and it's amazing how everyone works as a team to improve the quality of customer service."}
{"text":"Stopped in with party of six, snappy friendly service. I love the swarm service. All entrees perfect favorites are the rotisserie chicken and the ribs, need better wine by glass selections, please update 
Be back often"}
{"text":"My wife really likes Hillstone. She always has the baby backed ribs with coleslaw, and loves the ribs. I eat the coleslaw, which is unlike any I have eaten before, fresh, not drowned in mayo, and very good. 

I typically order the salmon, which at $27.00 for a relatively small portion with baked potato is overpriced. My kids always have the burgers, which are very good. 

Lots of leather, pleasant lighting (Hillstone/Houstons tends to be darker). We go perhaps 2/3 times a year, and I cannot remember seeing the same waiter twice. 

Patio is real popular, firepits and comfortable chairs. 

There are plenty of eats in the area go couple of miles East or West on Camelback, Chelsea's kitchen, Postinos, Grand Orange, St. Francis. All worthy of consideration."}
{"text":"Chic consistency is how I would sum up this classic example of what American dining should be.

Another visit Sunday night 7:30 work friend gathering party of 5. The first arrival was seated in a large booth on the north side of this gorgeous spot.  Of course the best views are at the bar but a booth is more spacious & conducive to conversation.  

Our server was Yanni which she was kind, down to earth, and accurate with our requests. She made our experience seem cozy and comfortable.  When I read reviews of pretense at Hillstone, I cannot relate.  Yes the architecture and cuisine is nearly flawless, it does not seem snooty at all.

Our table had the ahi tuna steak, gulf coast fish sandwich, veggie burger, Thai steak salad, tuna mango roll, and bread.  All of us enjoyed the fresh straightforward preparations and delicious flavor combinations.  Yanni suggested the mi sueno el llano Cabernet to accompany my Thai steak salad- great choice.  A smooth lingering berry wine really enhanced the mango & filet mignon.  

We shared a couple key lime pies with the non sweet whipped cream.  Truly a delicious example of classic pastry.  The lime filling with cold and tart not overly sweet and the perfect minty green homemade color.  The crust is a nutty crumble that you press your fork into the last crumbs.

I will continue to recommend this establishment to visiting clients in my nearby biltmore fashion park boutique.

Thank you to Hillstone for their service, food, and chic consistency."}
{"text":"I should have stuck to Donovan's instead of being coerced into eating at Hillstone. We had reservations and waited more than 40 mins to get seated. Service was poor. This place is highly overrated..The prime rib was so stringy I took more than half home to give to my dog. The french dip meat was cold and the chicken was dry. I could go on and on about the other dishes we had. We have eaten at every steak eatery in the Valley and I would compare Hillstone the same quality as The Outback. I expect far better service and quality of food at Hillstone. We will not be eating at this establishment any longer."}
{"text":"To me, Houston's on Camelback is Cheers. Been eating at the bar with Tom and Al for 20 years and they're always fun to see."}
{"text":"This is a really nice spot and I can't wait to return to try another amazing dish from here!

I ordered the Nigiri plate and it was decent although the fish was not as thick as it typically is. It did taste fresh though so that was nice.

The reason I give this joint the 4th star is because I ordered a side salad which consisted of kale and cashews, and I definitely didn't have high hopes for this salad. The salad actually blew my mind!!!! It was so delicious and the texture was perfect. 

Service was good and the restaurant was clean and had a comforting ambience. I will definitely be back to try other items on the menu...and will order that kale and cashew salad again!"}
{"text":"Hillstone and Houston's has been consistently good since I can remember. I have been over a hundred times and have never been dissatisfied. The best cheeseburger in town! Great sushi! Classic atmosphere. I enjoy lunch here on Sundays after a round of golf at the biltmore."}
{"text":"Went to Hillstone for dinner. Had the seafood. Everything was excellent and portions were generous. Would highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Ahh, Hillstone.  Consistently delivers quality service and food.   The biggest disappointment is having to wait for a table on a busy weekend night, but it is always worth it!    

A few recommendations:

- Call ahead for reservations for dinner

- Order a glass of Mi Sueno (yum!)

- Try their California roll.  I know it sounds crazy but it is by far the BEST California roll you will ever have.  I typically hate Cali rolls but this one is legit.  Who knew a place like Hillstone would have great sushi rolls?  They make theirs with real crab and the best part is that they don't skimp on the crab to rice ratio.  Okay I'm drooling now...

- Thai steak salad is delicious and very filling. 

- Although a little pricier than some of the other items, try their Hawaiian Ribeye.   Ordered mine medium rare and it was \"OMG yum\" worthy.

- French dip is also a must try.  Perfectly prepared every time.  Last night I ordered it and they seemed to have changed the cut of their fries (typically shoe string, which I prefer).

- Order the ice cream sundae for dessert and share it with friends.  We like to flip the bowl of ice cream, nuts and whipped cream over into the main dish and drizzle all of the hot chocolate on top.  Perfect for sharing and always a great way to end a delicious meal."}
{"text":"Over priced and the quality of the food was sub-standard. More style than substance. My \"house salad\" was suppose to have egg and bacon and it was near nonexistent. Instead of having lettuce it had more cabbage that you use to make coleslaw. In this economy if your going to charge high end than you must deliver on the product. This didn't happen because their taking short cuts in the kitchen."}
{"text":"The worst service I have had. Told suit would be an hour wait, after calling them and they told us it would be 20 minutes. The mojito was horrible, we never got greeted. For the price of their dishes you would think they would take more pride in ensuring their guests had the best experience. Don't go there. A lot of other places in the area with way better service."}
{"text":"The Oysters St Charles were fantastic. 
The yellow tail sashimi salad was a 4/5, very good.
Hawaiian Rib Eye with loaded baked potato was excellent. The rib eye was very tender with a good amount of grill char on it. I recommend this restaurant.
Eat well."}
{"text":"The food is delicious. The service impeccable. The loud music is unbearable! What addition to an dining experience is enhanced with loud, pulsating drums that only make patrons shout louder?  Ugh, I can see why four people sit silently with their heads down. They're texting their conversations with each other and looking up to laugh or smile."}
{"text":"We were first-time visitors. The service was amazing the food was fabulous. Will repeat visit many times."}
{"text":"I went with a business associate to have lunch at the new Hillstone and we arrived early, around 11:00am.  The staff was practically non-existent.  The entrance is nearly impossible to find.  We stood looking at the hostess for at least 30 seconds before she acknowledge we were alive.  The only way this place will continue to thrive is by the endless stream of business \"professionals\" who work at the Esplanade and nearby corporate centers who have grown tired of the Biltmore Fashion Park's mediocre restaurants.  Ask for your check the minute you order because it takes 20 minutes to get the bill.  Oh, and PAY CASH so you can leave in a timely manner.  Attractive building on Camelback - the only positive thing I can say about this place.  Won't be back there any time soon."}
{"text":"I previously wrote a dissatisfied review about the last time we were in, but instead of \"updating\" my review, I deleted the last one. My reason why is because tonight we had amazing service, food was great, we didn't have to wait a long time (having a reservation), we both got our darn potatoes that were somehow sold out last time, manager came by to check in and was very kind, so it was deserved. Hillstone, keep it up and we will be back (all the time because it's my fiance's favorite place lol)"}
{"text":"Recently went to Hillstone for lunch and while the food was adequate, it was not deserving of the rather high prices. Personally, I had the Thai Steak & Noodle Salad. The salad was confusing, to say the least. The salad is not particularly well thought out. The steak was randomly dispersed throughout the salad and it was neither in bite sized chunks, nor in one uniform piece. The steak chunks also were not uniformly cooked with pieces ranging from rare to medium rare to well done. Additionally, the flavorless noodles were clumped together making it difficult to get one bite with all of the good Thai flavors (ripe mango and fresh herbs) that were present in the dish. In other words it was tasty, but not well executed. 
There is a point at which service goes from being excellent to obnoxious. This line was crossed at Hillstone. The server wiped water rings from the table every single time he would visit. Also, the server circled back to the table far too often and when it was clear that none of the five people in our party wanted anything he would stand there for an additional 10 seconds with a goofy look on his face before again wiping the table and departing. 
The ambiance was excellent (complete with excellent people watching), the food had good flavors (albeit poorly executed), and the server was clearly trying too hard."}
{"text":"After my last review I couldn't wait to come back to have dinner here. I came with two colleagues that are in town for business. We arrived at about 8 PM, on a Tuesday night, and they were still on a 30 minute wait.  The place was absolutely packed, from the bar to the dining room. We waited it out on the nice patio and enjoyed a cocktail. When our table was ready we each ordered something different. I had the Hillstone burger, a take on a bacon cheeseburger. My colleagues had a veggie burger and the other had Chopped salad. Everyone ate every last morsel. My burger was good, not great. I did like their take on a bacon cheeseburger though. Service was outstanding. Our waitress stopped by the table and did not interrupt conversations. Instead she would politely wait until we were done. This is so rare to find these days. I will definitely come back, would absolutely recommend this place to others too."}
{"text":"With an identity change this restaurant is all location, architecture & Super Stylish Sexy ambiance! 

After 23+ years' great epicurean service to the city of phoenix Houston's moved across the street to their own new stand alone building. (Who figured out your parking quota???)

They spared no expense as far as making a magnificent 5 star atmosphere presentation... The ambiance of this restaurant is off the charts! If you have a date you want to impress or clients you want to razzle dazzle this place is off the hook. This restaurant is much more formal, so dress well!  

So why didn't I give them five stars? 

Well I waited for several months before going in, so the hoopla had died down, & they would have a chance to fix any corky things you get with a new establishment! The servers all had the same well trained Houston's' marching army/team getting your dishes to your table as quickly as possible. The only problem was they kept bringing out someone else's dish. I mean the wrong appetizer came out, than the wrong dish, & finally the wrong dessert! The first time I shrugged it off as it happens, but after the second time, I was a little concerned! (I don't like other patrons breathing on my food!)

The Food Quality is exactly the same as all the other Houston's restaurants! They are using prettier dishware than before, & the dishes have smaller portion area on them. My Thai salad was 30% smaller than it used to be in Houston's! (Seriously!!!) The prices did go up again which I didn't like, but you are getting better ambiance. They also added sushi to the menu!

The ambiance, the outside waiting area (Rock Garden with Fire place & Fountain) is very romantic! Great place to have a few drinks with a date before dinner! The Bar is wide open & very loud, a great place to check out members of the opposite sex! A lot of hot cougars congregate here in twos & threes! The restaurant although very noisy is sexy & stylish!

Did I mention the Prices went up! 
I use to frequent Houston's several times a week, because I thought it was a great value for the dining experience!  I regularly go there alone for lunch or happy hour & sit @ the bar alone & inevitably meet a friend! I just don't see that happening here."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with this place. I mean, don't expect the best place ever, just bring a humble taste, sole cash and good company and you won't be disappointed.

I gave this place 4 stars basically for the service and the ambiance. The food is a little above average but nothing to impress.

The service is kind and the decoration of the place is really pleasant.

A good place for a date or friends and family, although a little over priced (for the food).

Cheers."}
{"text":"Okay, I love Houston's even though it's a chain. I travel about 90% of the time with my job and Houston's consistently has good food, clean restaurants and great service (I don't understand why all restaurants don't follow their service mantra...where every server takes care of every table...you never have a dirty dish sitting on your table or want for anything for more than 5 minutes.) It is safe to say I'm probably Houston's number one fan! (Just ask my friends who know Houston's is going to be my first suggestion as the place to go eat.) I frequent the 24th St & Camelback location in Phoenix the most. \"T\" the hostess is absolutely terrific. I ALWAYS feel special when I go in there. All of the food is good. I love the smoked salmon or spinach dip as an appetizer. And the Ahi Tuna salad, the French Dip and the  chopped chicken salad are incredible. I try and make it in to the restaurant on Thursdays for their Chicken Enchilada soup which rocks! Finally, their Sundae is the best I've ever had. Unfortunately, it's difficult to make a choice between that and their key lime pie. I have a few complaints about Houstons, I don't like their tea or lemonade very much. Lemonade is too sour and the tea tastes artificial. I'm also bummed they don't have a blender in their bar for frozen margaritas. Perhaps it's because of the noise, not sure? The ambiance at the place is always relaxing. Portions seem to be getting smaller and prices have gone up (like everything else) so bring your wallet."}
{"text":"Went to meet my mom for lunch last Friday with my little guy.  Instead of being greeted by the host staff, Carol walked up to me and announced that my stroller won't fit in the restaurant and that she would have to take it in the back.  What?  Ok...  This Britax B-Ready apparently warranted a scolding.  Carol was so incredibly rude and my stroller would have easily fit at a table- minus a chair.  What exactly is their procedure for wheelchairs or other special needs devices?  Do they simply not fit or are they not pleasing enough to the eye to accommodate?  They might want to come up with a better story and take a more discerning eye to the host staff.  I've always had such great experiences here in the past; what a disappointment.  We'll be over at Chelsea's.  They're cool with my wheels."}
{"text":"My review is based on nothing but my experience walking into the restaurant. 

Immediately, I felt an air of pretentiousness that couldn't be shook. From the people in the restaurant to the \"fish\" being shown at the sushi station. There was even a bowl of artichokes showcased by the grill that had multiple flies flying in the vicinity. 

I thought, the food must at least warrant this and took a look at the menu. Everything I saw was priced like nothing I had seen before. Nothing I saw on the menu seemed at all worth the price, but I tried it anyway and my initial thoughts were justified. I will not be back to try anything else. 

Try another restaurant in the area. Please."}
{"text":"Houston's/Hillstone is still great with same menu overall, except they now have decent beer on tap.  Love the traditional salad with garlic buttermilk dressing, the vegetable of the day, and jazz you can kind of hear over the always lively chatter.  Like the tunnel under Camelback to walk back to the Esplanade for a movie at the rarely crowded AMC."}
{"text":"I wanted to like Hillstone before we even entered the restaurant.  The patio is charming and romantically lit, and it wasn't overcrowded.  We were brought to a large booth in the back of the restaurant with a party of six and while I enjoyed the ambiance of the restaurant, I have to say I was less than impressed with the waitstaff.  The first server who came to our table (who was apparently only there to take our drink order, but didn't tell us that so it was really confusing when a different server showed up a few minutes later), literally COULD not understand what we wanted to drink.  I was with two moms-to-be who both wanted club soda with cranberry juice and a splash of pineapple, which I'll admit, is a little random and high maintenance for a nonalcoholic beverage but the server should have been able to handle it.  Instead, she just kept saying, \"So, Absolut and club soda and what?\" \"Absolute and pineapple..?\" These women did not want vodka in their pregnant bellies! It wasn't even particularly loud in the restaurant, I think perhaps Hillstone is just doing its part to hire the hearing impaired. Although she finally seemed to grasp that they were ordering nonalcoholic drinks, I seriously wanted to take a sip of the drinks first to make sure they weren't spiked.  The whole exchange was just weird.

The \"real\" server wasn't as bad, just kind of inattentive and awkward.  I did enjoy my food though...I got the spicy tuna roll salad which was really interesting and tasty and everyone I dined with seemed to enjoy their dishes.  I'd consider coming back for the food and the ambiance but it's definitely not one of my favorites, there are better places in town for the price."}
{"text":"Since moving to Phoenix almost 10 years ago, I had visited Houston's only a handful of times.  For many people in the Valley of the Sun, Houston's at the Biltmore Fashion Park was the standard for moderately priced comfort food with excellent service.  With that said, Hillstone Restaurant has stepped in and has garnered the admiration of the discerning clients from the former Houston's.

We visit Hillstone about once a month. The last time that we visited was because a couple was in from Dallas, they were requesting Lobster Mashed Potatoes or something incredibly delectable like it, which is on the menu at the Hillstone in Dallas.  The evening was unhurried and I believe that we were the last ones to leave the restaurant that night.  We will return again soon."}
{"text":"Hillstone was spectacular. walking into the facility, you could see the whole kitchen and basically see them cook everything. Hillstone was very clean inside and out which always makes the dining experience better. 

Our server was knowledgeable on the menu and the current specials they had. He was easy to talk to and fulfilled all of our needs. I ordered the California Burger which was made to perfection. the presentation was very nice and the alcohol drinks were made evenly. 

For a romantic date or a birthday celebration with a classy feel, i would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Wow! Hillstone never fails me - started with the grilled Artichoke which is amazing and so flavorful -followed that with a burger and fries which are always stellar - the burger was moist and cooked to perfection on a handmade bun with the right amount of garnish. My friend had the fish sandwich which is perfectly fried and paired with coleslaw on a delicious bun and a side salad. The key lime pie and hot fudge Sunday just rounded it all out. Oh and the lemon drop and dirty Martinis!!!!!"}
{"text":"I stopped in for a few drinks and some food with a few friends. 
We sat in the bar. The female bartender was really unfriendly in the beginning but eventually warmed up. 
They have fresh squeezed juices and I love that!! 
I had a delicious greyhound and ordered the Ahi salad. 
The salad was wonderful. The tuna was cooked perfectly and not smothered in black pepper like you find in most places. The dressing was a ginger vinaigrette and the accompanying salad had avocado, mango, cabbage and a delicious champagne vinaigrette. 
The atmosphere was nice and it was a good crowd at the bar. 
One word of caution... 
If you are wearing heels be careful going to the bathroom the floor by the kitchen was really slippery!"}
{"text":"Our friends brought us to Hillstone during the Thanksgiving Day weekend and we loved it so much we came back a 2nd time in 2 days!  Service is stellar all the way, and the food is outstanding.  You'd be hard pressed not to find something to your liking here.  Cocktails are great too! :)  My only regret is that we don't have this restaurant in San Diego, but we'll be back to the Phoenix location to be sure!"}
{"text":"This place is delicious! We came here for lunch on a Friday and had excellent service. They literally have an employee for every job. You will not be disappointed as you can feel the \"every guest is my guest\" aspect. 

We started with the chips with guac and assorted salsas which was fresh and delicious. I had the ahi tuna plate, it was AMAZING. I'm craving it again now. 

Everyone at the table enjoyed their meal. It's a little on the spendy side but I will be back for a celebration!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite restraunt right now.  The food is filled with flavor and the service is phenomenal."}
{"text":"Hillstone is good... but it's not Houston's. I was devastated when i found out they are closing the Houston's in Scottsdale next year and heard that Hillstone is basically the same, (it replaced the Houston's in Phoenix). I work right across the street, so finally I figured I'd give it a shot.

The restaurant is beautiful, the staff is nice, but the Caesar salad (my favorite) was terrible compared to Houston's. There was corn in it, which I'm not totally understanding and some larger clumps of lettuce that made the salad uneven and harder to share. I'm afraid to try to the burger... but in fairness, the salmon appetizer was just as good.

CONCLUSION: Don't close Houston's. It's better. End of story."}
{"text":"My boyfriend took me to Hillstone on Saturday night for dinner to celebrate our 3 year anniversary. 

1-The interior is stunning. A gorgeous patio with big open windows, a wrap around bar that is decorated with expensive wines, whiskeys, etc... and fresh fruit, the lighting is dim (for us romantic folks), and the overall architecture is modern.

2-Hillstone has exceptional service. From the second we walked in the door we experienced nothing but real people trying to help us enjoy a relaxing evening with dangerously delicious food and beverage. If you are a wine snob, this place is for you. I LOVE myself a killer glass of wine but seeing as how my boyfriend already spoiled us with two new bottles, (which we've yet to enjoy together) we decided to go with cocktails. Our bartender was fabulous and friendly BUT he didn't know what a Moscow Mule was when I ordered it and my boyfriends Manhattan tasted more like watered down whiskey with muddled orange. With no hopes for a Moscow Mule I decided to order their Margarita on the rocks since I could see at least 4 other people at the bar with one. Can't go wrong right? It was ok. A little too much sweet and sour for my pallet. I was a little annoyed when I asked for a drink suggestion from the bartender he automatically started with \"We have Cosmopolitans, Lemon drops....\" as soon as he said \"Lemon Drop\" I felt my face go blank and in my head I said \"really man? I know I'm a girl but really?\" I almost stopped him dead in his tracks to order a glass of whiskey. Straight up. He was just being a great and informative bartender so I of course understood. Just thought that was fairly entertaining. I'm sure they have both those drinks ordered a lot! 

3- The food is stupid amounts of tasty and the portions are more than anyone would really ever need. Which is good right? Leftovers! We ordered the Cheese Bread, Grilled Artichoke, and The Vegetarian Burger to share. So basically we ordered pizza, one vegetable, and a hamburger and fries. I felt so heavy after ha! But boy or boy, my taste buds were singing and dancing their little hearts out. 

You get 3 large pieces of half an artichoke, which was more than enough for us. We ended up taking one of the artichoke pieces home. you get 6 fairly large sized pieces of soft, warm ciabata bread covered in two cheeses with olive oil and herbs... and the Vegetarian Burger is on a classic hamburger bun with tomatos, shredded lettuce, pickles, and the burger itself has some sort of orange chutney or glaze(?) on it. SO GOOD. This veggie burger is pretty well known and popular from what I hear! Even steak lovers have got to try it.

This place has a higher price point and for good reason. Great atmosphere, amazing service, and food that makes your heart happy. You'll be happy to pay for the experience."}
{"text":"Blue Cheese Wedge Salad, Hawaiian Rib-Eye, Server's recommended Cabernet and a table for one and I'm in H-E-A-V-E-N :)

I've had Houston probably 3 or 4 times over the years.  I had no idea Hillstone was apart of Houston's family until the server told me!  One of my favorite places ever!"}
{"text":"If there were seven stars available, I'd give it seven!! Hillstone NEVER disappoints.  We live across the street from it and are there at least 1 or 2 times a week. We've had everything on the menu and there isn't a single thing that's not delicions. The filet, the Hawaiian rib eye, the ribs and the sushi are the standouts, and my go-to favorite is the Thai steak and noodle salad. It's to die for.  I don't understand what the 3-star reviewer was complaining about. The staff at Hillstone is SPOT-ON.  They never miss a beat and yes they work as a team. We generally have one assigned server by through the course of the meal will see three of for different faces.  Yes, it's pricey but the quality of the food warrants the price.  It's a true dining experience and I can't recommend it highly enough."}
{"text":"This place is excellent. Great tasting food and atmosphere. They have a real comfortable  patio area and the staff are very friendly and attentive to the customers needs. Had some of the best tasting food in a long time here and dessert was excellent as well. Would highly recommend this as a top place to have dinner to anyone."}
{"text":"This place is a joke. Been in twice, place is empty and was told 25 minute wait. Get a clue."}
{"text":"I love Hillstone!!!!!! It is amazing!  I worked at Houstons when I was in highschool and you would think that I would be sick of it, but I am not!! I cannot get enough!  The spinach dip is the best ever created in the world!!!  I actually like the change to the salsa they did!  The Grilled Chicken Salad is a dream with the peanut sauce, or the Thai noodle salad-I love the mangos, tomatos, and avocados its delicious, or the caesar salad, or the hickory burger with fries, or the ribs and to top it off the sundae!!!! The chocolate sauce is orgasmic!!  i wish I could have it everyday! The new restaurant is a little confusing because the front door is in the back of the building and its kind of awkward b/c if you dont know that you will walk right in the middle of the dining room and bar area.  However, the restaurant is beautiful and so open and airy!  The patio is perfect and I wish I could have eaten out there but it was sprinkling and cold!  There is something for everyone here and you can go for lunch or dinner!  Head this way!!!"}
{"text":"Crowded but Definately worth the wait. If there are any single ladies looking for good looking men - not only is the food great but so are the men that eat here - wow! Great staff, very helpful and fun too! This is a chain but for some reason (at least at this location) it doesnt feel like it. Our waiter knew everything there was to know about the menu and was not lazy like most waiters at chains....Great food, great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"So many things on the menu, so delicious. Our service could have been better, but we were there forever so he wanted to turn the table."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely STUNNING! The design of this building is beautiful. St. Francis had been the forerunner of my favorite atmosphere - but, I think Hillstone just overtook it!  It is very open and modern with a mid-century vibe to it.  Love it!  The patio looks cozy with outdoor furniture and a few fire pits.  There is a big piano in the bar area. 

Awesome veggie burger - one of the best in Phoenix!! They make it in-house and it has a great nutty flavor to it.  They have another vegetarian entrée which is some kind of steamed seasonal veggie platter, which seems kind of boring but I would give it a shot.  Not many other veg-friendly items though. 

I know this is silly, but I was really amused by the ice cubes in my tea.  They're the perfect, old-school CUBES!  

My folks are regulars here so when I went with them we got great, VIP service."}
{"text":"Simply the best.  Great food, service, and atmosphere.   Love the filet, salmon and the grilled artichoke.  Love bartenders Brittany, Tom, Al, and Jill.  Consistently awesome!"}
{"text":"CUTTING CORNERS. Unless you're a regular you may not notice, but suddenly they are now serving smaller drinks, less olives in martinis, not supplying you a fresh cold glass at your table if they see you're still nursing your drink, and... after years of gorgeous lush lilies in the women's bathroom there are now weeds that look like they are from Trader Joe's. We've seen a drop in service as well -- don't see many of their longterm staff there anymore, and takes longer to get any attention. My husband and I have been coming here for years as our weekly date night, and last few times we agreed it just wasn't the same special experience. Food still great, but I'm heartbroken as I always set Hillstone as the standard for other restaurants to meet, and talked about it often. Now they are a low 4 out of 5. Hillstone please come back. We miss you. Raise your prices if you must, but don't lower your famous high standards."}
{"text":"Had the chicken, cashew kale salad it was very good. Service is excellent, a little pricey for what it is.  The best thing is the water....I don't know what they do to it but it's really good, comes in a frosted glass with no ice."}
{"text":"We came during a weekday lunch, so they were quite busy. We got seated within a few minutes, no biggie. We got approached by 3 different servers before our actual server came over, which was a little confusing.  

We ordered a California Roll to share, I got the Prime Rib dip and my mom got a chicken sandwich. The roll was OK, I've had better. The dip was pretty tasty and the fries that came with it were well seasoned and crispy- just how I like 'em.

The service here was exceptional. The food, considering the price, just didn't really do it for me. For a $50+ lunch, I wish it was a little more memorable. 

What I did dig tho, were the giant fish outside who practically jump out of the water when you sit by their little \"pond\" thing. Besides the service, they were my favorite thing there."}
{"text":"Really wanted to eat here but after asking twice if somebody was going to provide service at the little bar table nobody came over.  Unfortunately too busy for a single so I left."}
{"text":"This has got to be my all time favorite.  Great ambiance and bar area.  The food is superb and ALWAYS reproducible."}
{"text":"Love this place.   Especially like their fresh veges in the summer, the filet mignon and their apple walnut cobbler...so yummy.  Can't go wrong here.  Great service!"}
{"text":"This place is misleading, and not in a bad way. You pull up to a joint next to the Ritz Carlton.... valet park your car, walk in to a dimly lit swanky area and sit down. Open up the menu and whoa - this place is not as expensive as it looks.

I wasn't sure what to order. I'd been eating steak for the last few days and I was wondering if I should do fish or something else... it was a really interesting menu - lotsa different choices. My first instinct was to go with something safe and order a french dip - it's my favorite sandwich. But I also didn't want just meat and starch, so I got the Thai Steak and Noodle salad instead. It sounded pretty good. I also ordered a Hefferveisen - the last time I had one was on Venice beach with a good high school friend of mine and I remember really enjoying it - even though I'm not much of a beer drinker. The Hefferveisen they brought out was disgusting. No idea where it was brewed. it looked fresh, but tasted like rubbing alcohol. BLEH.

And the thai steak and noodle salad - the first few bites we ok, but it was just a mash-up of all things that might be thai with some avocado in it. It, too was gross. So much so, that I actually sent it back. This is not something I generally do, but I absolutely could not eat it and I was still hungry! So I asked them to bring out something safe: the french dip.

The french dip was good and the fries that came with it were good. 

Don't go to Houston's if you're looking for cultural fare. Go there for their American fare. That's what they tout and that's what they're good at."}
{"text":"Hillstone, meet the Hillstone...Have a yabba dabba doo time, A dabba doo time, You'll have a gay old time!!! 
  I loved this place!! The food was awesome, the service was incredible, our server was super funny and the vibe of this place was so relaxing and fine!!
My favorite thing here was the Shrimp Coconut Sushi!! MUY DELICIOSO!!!!! Oh and the Ribs are a massive thing to behold, at first I though there was no way I would even finish half but I did, it was that good I guess that eating it was a very smooth journey of pure meaty goodness that I was able to accomplish to about 3/4 of the way that was because I was full to the heart!! We really enjoyed and loved this place!! We cannot wait to go back again and sink our teeth into another dish of pure goodness!! This place is a must for those who haven't decided to go on in!! Thank us later!!! :)  High five and an A+++"}
{"text":"Last night my husband and I dined at Hillstone with another couple. The restaurant was very busy, but we were seated right at the time of our reservation. The service was terrific. The hostess and the servers were very helpful and attentive and friendly, even though it was obvious that they were all very busy. We all had delicious entrees - the crispy oysters, the Thai steak and noodle salad, the French dip sandwich and the pan-roasted salmon. The Duckhorn chardonnay by the glass was very good and it was great that they offered a good-quality non-alcoholic beer (Becks), as well. The only downside to the experience was that the restaurant was a bit noisy, but that is a common complaint these days. We will definitely return."}
{"text":"I must have missed something with the prime filet.  It was a tad bit on the saltier side, though the the meat was tender, I couldn't taste much except for the salt.  It came with some mashed potatoes and some broccoli, nothing too special.  Other stuff wasn't bad, the spinach dip ad the yellowtail roll."}
{"text":"We have been going to Hillstone (Houston's) for 20 years and eat there at least once a month. It saddens me to say...the past 3 or 4 times the service has gone down hill.  This is very disappointing since this was our go to restaurant. 

With all the new restaurants popping up we are sure to find another."}
{"text":"This place never disappoints. The quality of the food and service has always been consistent. The nice little salad comes with big chunks of goat cheese and every component of the salad satisfies. The greens are fresh and the beets are wonderfully roasted. The Kale and cashew salad is also a great simple salad if you're looking for a light healthy start. It has a pleasant sesame oil flavor. If you like fish like I do, you will love their pan fried salmon. They cook it medium, the fillet is a good size. You can always change the seasonal side that comes with it. 

The grouper sandwich was superb, serving is huge so if you want room for their excellent sundae which comes with a little pitcher of chocolate sauce, you may want to share it.

I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"In my early yelping days, I used to believe that a 5 star review for a restaurant, should qualify as a 5 star meal.  As my yelping abilities have matured, however, I have adopted a more holistic method for my reviews.  Ambiance, originality, and service are now major considerations as well.  And albeit a rare occurrence, the service here has earned Hillstone Stewart K.'s coveted 5 stars.

Now don't misunderstand the food here is exquisite.  Hillstone stated that it emphasizes local produce to comprise its dishes.  I am all for this, not for environmental reasons (which I couldn't care less about), but rather practicality.  Local food tastes fresher because it generally is.  The \"Nice\" salad proved this point as it tasted fresh and \"green\".  You know that new plant taste that food picked fresh from the field has?  This was especially apparent in the walnuts in the salad which had the imbued flavors of the shell still on it (without the crunchiness of course).  

Ah, but here is where Hillstone's, or rather its server Becca, exceptional service points come in.  I was unsure of what entree to get here.  I asked our waitress for her recommendations.  I expected the usual spiel about how the server coincidentally thinks that the most expensive item on the menu is the best tasting.  Not so with Becca, she recommended the $28 ribs or even the burger.  Both are items that are on the cheaper end of Hillstone's offerings.  So despite how quickly, and almost artificially, she seemed to be able to rattle off the recommendations, she quickly gained my trust and passed my test.

But alas, I had ribs earlier in the day.  I opted for the $35 Hawaiian Ribeye.  It came out cooked perfectly medium rare (red with warm center), but a tad sweeter than I had imagined since it was glazed in something akin to pineapple something or other.  When Becca came by the table and asked, \"How is your meal?\"  I answered exactly as I mentioned above.  I guess my Northeastern bluntness may come across as a bit brash around these parts, but I was being honest and I did say that I enjoyed my meal.  But Becca seemed concerned though, like it was her mission to right some great injustice that Hillstone's chef committed against me.  Again, I assured her the steak was good.  So I rounded off my meal with the brownie in a cream sauce that was good enough to drink but decadent enough to make me sick and a coffee.    

So throughout my experience here, my waitress thoroughly explained each menu item from the Lux coffee (a local coffee roaster) to practically every entree on the menu, with an patience and positive attitude that I'm frankly just not used to back home.  In addition, at no point did my  water or coffee ever reach empty nor ever leave my table for want of anything...but here was the real gem for the evening.  Despite my fleeting, obtuse comment about the ribeye being \"too sweet\", she removed it from the bill!  I assured Becca that I was genuinely satisfied with the meal, but she stopped me and replied, \"I want you to be completely satisfied with your experience here.\"  Then she said something to the effect that if I wasn't completely satisfied, I ought not pay. ....NOW THIS IS THE KIND OF SERVICE THAT TRULY DEMONSTRATES GOING ABOVE AND BEYOND FOR THE CUSTOMER.  So what I would consider about a 3.5 to 4 star meal, has become a 5 star experience.  If I am in the area in the future, I will return and would hope that this level of dedication to customer satisfaction is adhered to by all at Hillstone."}
{"text":"Hillstone needs to learn to not serve the entree at the same time as the appetizer. When my prime rib came out 30 sec after my Sushi Nigri I said something to the waitress. Also that I didn't want my prime rib, a near $40 dish, to dry out under a heating lamp in the meantime. She said she would speak to the manager. Later my prime rib was brought out by the manager, Amanda Murgas, and she said.....nothing. Not a word... With no due respect: what a LOSER! I don't know how she got the job but I do know she shouldn't be keeping it. The timing of meal serving is an important aspect of a multi-couse experience and regrettably mismanaged at Hillstone. And I say this after experiences of this sort in Phoenix AZ well as the Santa Monica CA location."}
{"text":"Food was amazing, drinks were spectacular, wait staff was friendly and anticipated every need. The ambience was fabulous with casual diners seated next to the formally dressed with all having a great time. We plan to go back and bring more friends and family."}
{"text":"I need to tell you about the worst hostess experience I've EVER had anywhere.  Ann was unable and unwilling to even pretend to try and accomodate our simple seating request to have our 2 parties sit near each other, even though I'd made my reservation 2 weeks in advance withthat specific request.  Her attitude was unacceptable."}
{"text":"Love this place. My favorite thing to do is sit at the bar and enjoy the warm atmosphere with a glass of wine and barbecue ribs. It's always a noteworthy experience and the staff is genuine with their hospitality."}
{"text":"Maybe even better than when it was Houstons at the Esplanade. Great building, food and service. The new Del Frisco's management should stop over for dinner. Maybe they could learn how to run a restaurant!!"}
{"text":"I had the most amazing time here tonight! Im new to the area and this place had amazing reviews so I checked it out. Our server Melissa was just amazing. She went above and beyond her duties to make us comfortable, I will defiantly come back to see her! I got the Thai ahi tuna roll, it was incredible! It has cashews in it that make a perfect crunch! My dad got a burger and coleslaw and loved it! They also have have chain breaker! Love it!"}
{"text":"First time going to a Hill Stone, but I was just amazed. It usually doesn't take me long to pick something out of a menu and theirs isn't particularly big, but their selection was so interesting I didn't know what to pick. So we decided to share the Shrimp Macadamia Nut sushi, Smoked Salmon, Rotisserie Chicken, and the Prime Fillet. Very very satisfying. Not the biggest portions but honestly one of my most favorite restaurants."}
{"text":"Awful, awful customer service - so bad in fact that we were too thoroughly disgusted to stay for the meal. We came here on a Sunday afternoon, which was my first and last time.  I've been to other Houston's locations in California - and have had decent times there.  In fact, I love the thai steak salad.

 However, this time some 20 year old idiot host walked us to our table (and before we even sat down) and told us \"My mom taught me good manners, so I've always taken my hat off at the dinner table.\"  

Huh?  First of all, I was dressed nicely in a button up shirt, and was wearing my favorite football team hat who had just won the championship the day before.  Secondly, I hadn't even sat down at the table yet, asswipe.  Thirdly, while I understand this isn't Applebees, this also isn't Ruth's Chris Steakhouse, douche bag.  And don't talk to me like I'm 7 years old.

No sooner had the idiot host left before we walked into the kitchen to get the manager  to bitch him out about his insulting employee.  The manager was pretty much dismissive.  Well, guess what - I'm pretty much dismissive about this poor excuse for a restaurant. 

1 STAR - not going back!!"}
{"text":"Always an excellent meal, one of my favorite restaurants in Phoenix. They never let me down. Great menu, great service, great food."}
{"text":"FABULOUS RESTAURANT, FOOD AND PROFESSIONAL WAITSTAFF !!!! Wow !!  We drove from North Scottsdale to try their Sushi....and found EVERYTHING to be top notch.  We will go there again and again.  If I could rate it more than 5 stars, I would.  Our waiter, Anthony, is the best ever !  A consummate professional, friendly, knowledgeable and what a great guy.  Artichoke was to die for, oysters delish, sushi FAB and Key Lime pie was light and excellent.  What a nice surprise to finally try this restaurant and have the best dining experience in the desert in the 12 years I've lived here.  Go and try it !!    Sam & Joe"}
{"text":"Quick service and great food! Tried the Hawaiian and it was amazing. Definitely worth the try and in a great location."}
{"text":"I remember driving by here on the way to Ruth's Chris back when we were first moving to the area, thinking \"we should come back and try that place!\"...finally, almost a year later, we did.  It's definitely a five star restaurant, for the price.  The prices are reasonable, the service is the fastest I've experienced in my life, and the food was great!  We did have almost an hour wait--but the fish pond outside made the wait seem much shorter.  I would actually give a 5 star score if a) they hadn't run out of prime rib and we had wanted the beef dip and b) the waiter hadn't forgotten to put our (non-alcoholic) drinks on our bill, then asked if it was \"ok\" to add it after giving us the bill.  Normally when a minor mistake is made on a bill ($10-$15ish for four of us), the restaurant will comp it.  Normally with you order something and a server comes back 5 minutes later to tell you that they're out of that item, especially when there's such a limited menu, they'll do something nice for you, right?  I thought the \"free\" drinks were to compensate us for the lack of prime rib, but apparently not...

We'll definitely go back."}
{"text":"So I had a gift card and wanted a fancy lunch while on staycation, so I grabbed my buddy and made a reservation 

I got there early and had a delicious grapefruit and vodka beverage while waiting   The place was packed so I enjoyed people watching for a few minutes while our table was readied 

My buddy showed up shortly after and we had the artichoke appetizer and finished our cocktails while catching up.  We ordered entrees (burgers and fries) and more cocktails but couldn't finish the food.

The service was excellent, with the exception of one bartender who didn't appreciate it when I pointed out that a patron was trying to get her attention so he could pay and leave.  I had watched her ignore him a couple of times already.

So, we enjoyed our fancy lunch...it was expensive but the food, drinks, and service were great.  I may come back and enjoy the patio once it cools off. ;)"}
{"text":"Awful has a new name.  Hillstone.  Just awful; service food...the whole thing.  Food was cold and poor quality.  Service, they just didn't care.  A tab of $187 one would assume you would get mediocre service but nope. I recommend taking your money elsewhere."}
{"text":"This was our first time here. I loved the layout of the patio and restaurant itself.  
We ordered New York's and the Hawaiian Rib-eye.  Everything was cooked to perfection!  And thank you for putting real bacon on the loaded baked potato.  The baked potato needed more stuff though...  kinda dry, but good.

The brownie on a vanilla custard and topped with ice cream with a Carmel sauce... OMG... Fantastic way to get your sugar high on!

Over all Service was awesome, Food was perfect, noise level was moderate.... We had a great time!"}
{"text":"Their kale salad is half the size and is no longer the loved peanut kale. It is now a citrus kale with a ton of cabbage and isn't nearly as good. When we asked what happened our waitress said they switched from a coconut kale salad? Gross.. Glad we missed that one... Unless she didn't know what she was talking about."}
{"text":"My third time here - first two times A+
This time, not the case 
I ordered the French dip sandwich and my girlfriend ordered the fish sandwich; which i had the last time.
She loved hers as did I when I had it. Mine, on the other hand, was dry, bland, and bread was horrible (tasted old, and did not compliment the sandwich)
More so, the waitress had a horrible attitude, unlike the last time (totally opposite). This one  had zero personality! 
She never checked to determine if I was pleased with my meal. So, i took the bread off and just ate it - it was hardly a $20 sandwich.
When she picked up the dish, after having to flag her down for more hot tea for my girlfriend, i expressed my dissatisfaction.
She sent the manager over who was also low personality and very snooty. I felt like I was on trial; she even asked if I've ever had a French dip sandwich before which is quite insulting. She then insisted their bread was made fresh each day - I've had fresh bread - I used to live in Europe - Abd this ain't fresh bread; more so, the comment was made with a snooty attitude!
They took it off of the bill which was not my intent.
My intent was to provide feedback for the rude service more so than the over priced sandwich!!!"}
{"text":"Hillstone is a great upscale yet casual restaurant and bar.  

My man and I have been here multiple times after the change from Houston's to the now newly re-named, re-located and renovated Hillstone...It's a definite winner for great menu options, heavy cocktail pours and nice ambiance.  

My man had been talking about a  specific dish he had discovered during a business meeting for close to a year as of last night. He had been raving about how wonderful it was and how he knew I would absolutely love it...Last night, I FINALLY experienced the dish, and OMG it was/is FABULOUS!  If you're an Ahi Tuna fan, you MUST order the \"FLYING TUNA PLATTER\" off the dinner menu (It's not listed on the lunch menu, but you can ask for it by name and they'll make it for you anyway)! It is divine...Bon Appetit!"}
{"text":"I enjoy going to Cherry Creek Grill/Hillstone/Houston's, because even though they have somewhat limited (albeit absolutely delicious) menu, the service is always impeccable. Unfortunately, such was not the case last night. I found my water glass completely empty on more than one occasion, and we never got the extra ramekin of condiment, because we didn't get a chance to ask for it - our server didn't come around while we were having our entrées, and the other servers walked so quickly past us, we couldn't flag anyone down to pass on the request either. The NY strip feature also had 3 end pieces, and I couldn't help but think that it was somehow \"Frankenstine-d\" together to meet the 8oz minimum. Having worked in a high-end steakhouse myself, I should've known better than to order the \"feature.\" Oh well. Overall, it was a very underwhelming visit. I don't think I'll be in a hurry to return, at least not this location."}
{"text":"We've always had great service and food.  The hostesses and servers have always gone out of their way to make us feel comfortable and that our business is appreciated.  My husband gets the Dink's Crispy Chicken sandwich and I get the Grilled Chicken Salad.  99% of the time we're very happy with our food.  Once I wasn't completely happy with the salad but didn't say anything until we were through with our meal as it had been okay enough to eat.  They apologized and took it off our bill.  They wanted to make me a new one but we were getting ready to leave so I declined.  We've been eating here since it first opened as Houston's on the south side of Camelback.  We love the new building and the parking is so much better."}
{"text":"If you are looking for the best veggie burger in town, look no further.  I first tried Houston's veg burger when my carnivorous friend ordered it a few years ago...I've been hooked ever since.  In addition to a great veg burger, the staff is wonderful and always allows substitutions or clean steamed veggies as side options."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped in at Hillstone on Christmas Eve for lunch. The food was great, I had the prime rib. I was impressed with the service and the professional staff. The atmosphere was great. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Consistency, consistency! How could you not want to go to a place that is consistent every time you go. Great service, great ambiance, great food, great wine, and it's always great quality!"}
{"text":"What a great experience! Food was fantastic! The hit though was the server Johnny (sp) Ann. She was the best! Knowledgable about the drinks and food, and entertaining even more so. She took our fun hassle, while giving it back. If you go in to Hillstone, go for the food just make sure you get in JA's section. You won't regret it one bit."}
{"text":"One of the worst restaurants I've ever been to the servers is very Road the food does not come out the way you think it should come out where do you tell them your food is not right they take forever to bring it back to you and it still does not come out right the restaurant is filthy the bathrooms are filthy they have roaches in the bathroom"}
{"text":"This is absolutely one of the best restaurants in Arizona.  Everything is very good.  The steak is fabulous, the ribs are outstanding the French fries and baked potatoes are excellent.  Cocktails are perfect and actually have liquor...
But what really sets Hillstone apart is the service and the management.  Christina the manager is the best.  As a regular of both Hillstone and Houstons, she has always been incredibly accommodating.  The consistency and high quality are unbeatable.  My family has eaten here at least once a week for (Houstons at Esplanade before moving and changing name to Hillstone) almost 19 years.  The only complaint I have is the menu doesn't include chicken fingers (Houstons on Scottsdale road does).  Our favorite place."}
{"text":"Great food, great atmosphere, The Hawaiian ribeye is my favorite, and don't for get the hot fudge sunday."}
{"text":"Great place to celebrate my husband's 80th birthday. Everything was perfect, but a special treat was having Denise as our server. She is truly a \"professional\" - pleasant, efficient and service par excellence. Be sure to ask to be seated in her area!"}
{"text":"We didn't have reservations so headed to an open table in the lounge. The table, just a few feet from the bar, didn't offer a full menu. Just intended apparently for patrons with reservations.  Ordered from the extremely limited menu (sushi for my husband and a house salad with focaccia bread for me). Don't waste your calories or money on the bread. Champagne by the glass was flat. Our server replaced it and subtracted from the bill. Manager on duty not interested in our comments. Too many good restaurants in the area so we won't be back"}
{"text":"They have the BEST grilled artichokes. They don't always have them on the menu but they usually still have them so ask your waiter. (You're welcome)

The arctic char is super good
The little house salad is super good
They make good whiskey sours

also GET THE FUDGE SUNDAE!! The fudge is ~real~ 
If you \"don't have a sweet tooth\" then get some help.

**the only reason I am not giving 5 stars is because once they gave me blanched asparagus without warning and whoa, not good**"}
{"text":"I went to Hillstone for the first time tonight.  The restaurant is quite striking and in many ways is a homage to Frank Lloyd Wright--very prairiesque in its design.  we sat at the bar--when I got there at 5:30  the wait was a half hour, by later in the evening it had grown to 1.5 hours so, at least now don't consider it if you want a quick bite.  Even at the bar--folks seem to have settled in for the evening --me included--as I was there for almost three hours.  I have to say the wine starts at $9 a glass so if you plan to spend the evening it is not going to be inexpensive--so no so much because of the food--except for the fact that there was one special that was steak and was $40--which I think is somewhat outrageous for this economy

anyway--to get back to the food--I had the club salad--and it was nice--nothing spectacular--i think why I will go back is more for the ambiance of the restaurant it self--service from the bar was okay--they are busy so don't expect a service level that blows your socks off, but I do think they were giving it their best shot.  in spite of it all --there was a nice vibe sitting at the bar that I liked."}
{"text":"I can not write enough good things about Hillstone and my dining experience.  Every time my wife and I dine at Hillstone's we are provided excellent service that goes over and above.  All the employees are extremely knowledgeable about the menu items and their ingredients, which allows them to make recommendations to fit your dietary needs.  Plus for the Gluten Free Avenger.  The quality of food produced in Hillstone's kitchen is amazing, so amazing that I have never had a bad meal.  Yes, not once have I had a bad meal.  High quality food with a fair price point considering the service, atmosphere, and menu options.  

This is my favorite restaurant in the Valley, hands down.  I am extremely impressed by the menu, service, atmosphere choices of patio, bar, and inside sitting.  Only negative comment is that when they are busy, they are BUSY, you have to wait.  But to be expected from a superb restaurant that can reproduce high quality food and service every time.  

Menu Pros:  
Salmom
Trout, if they bring it back
Hawaiian rib eye
The sushi.  Yea, highly impressed.  Knocks most places out of the park.
bake
Nice little house salad.  Simple but amazing."}
{"text":"My #1 favorite restaurant.  Consistently excellent service and perfectly prepared food."}
{"text":"Please please bring back the wonderful vanilla ice cream you used to have for your out of this world hot fudge sundaes!!
The ice cream you're using now is just too blah and tasteless. 
Otherwise I love going to Hillstone! The food is generally amazing!
Go see for yourself..."}
{"text":"Very nice atmosphere. Anah took great care of our party and smiled the whole time. Looking forward to coming back!"}
{"text":"Literally \"As good as it gets\"!!  Everything was top notch!  

Great beer selection; I had a French Kronenbourg, which I can't recall seeing in the US recently.  We split the spinach dip (on a recommendation from my other half's friend) -- amazing. I had the \"Nice Little House Salad\" (which, by the way, is not named after the French city of Nice, rather the English adjective, which proved true) -- extremely fresh, tasty and very generous with the goat and heirloom beets.  Enjoyed THE BEST rib eye I've ever consumed!  Flawlessly prepared and 1000% tasty!  I got a loaded baked potato for my side and I also ate my partner's cole slaw, which was creamy and horeradishy and supremely delicious!  

The ambiance; amazing.   The service; flawless.  The food; divine!  It's a tad pricey for a weekly dinner stop, but worth every single penny of it!"}
{"text":"Good service, friendly atmosphere. Must try the grilled artichoke, it's seasonal and not on the menu."}
{"text":"Came here fresh off the plane while I was in Phoenix for a business trip, and I sat at the bar.  The bartenders were very friendly and knowledgeable, and the food was fantastic.  The place was packed on a Tuesday night, and I talked to several regulars, which indicates to me that it is consistently good.  Overall, the atmosphere and food created a very enjoyable meal.  Thank you!"}
{"text":"The building, ambiance, and interior are gorgeous, warm and relaxing. It's a much cozier restaurant than the old Houston's on Camelback. 
The menu is much the same, thankfully. 
We started out with the grilled artichoke and it was good (it's not on the menu) but I think the grilled artichokes at Wally's and North are better.
We had a party of 7, and 3 people ordered the French Dip Sandwich with fries. Their fries are killer (really thin and yummy), and everyone seemed pleased with the sandwich (at $17 or $18, I wouldn't think of it).
Two in our party had the Thai Steak and Noodle Salad ($16) and I was tickled when I tasted it (still, a salad for $16...NOPE!).
I ordered the Smoked Salmon starter as my entree ($12) and had a side of their braised red cabbage with goat cheese (to-die-for at any cost). The salmon was okay, but I personally think it needs to be smoked a little longer...
All in all, it's a good restaurant with impeccable service. 
Still, those prices seem a little steep to me...."}
{"text":"This is a two star place that gets an extra star for the fantastic house made smoked salmon. I would come again just for that. 
Two people for dinner with no alcohol and no steaks came to $70. To me, that's overpriced for sandwiches and salad. No quality issues on the food, but nothing special or creative either.
Atmosphere was like happy hour at the nursing home. No live music and rather small bar area. Table area was dark except for a spotlight was focused on my eyes for the entire meal."}
{"text":"It pains me to rate this place 5 stars as it is a chain that has roots across our great country but it's well deserved.  I have visited this place at least 6 times a year since they opened and the service has alway been top notch along with the food.  The bartenders are exceptionally awesome! 

My favorites on the menu are the filet, ribeye, burger, ahi tuna, Thai steak salad (pic attached) and the sushi including the poke.  Yeah I said it, the sushi...... You wouldn't think it but it's some of the best around.  

If you're in the mood for food and service that won't disappoint make a stop at hillstone.  The only thing you need to be aware of is that all this awesomeness comes at a price with dinners ranging from $17 (burger) to $45 (filet).  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I like the food, the fillet mignon and chicken are delicious, I love the roasted beets and Swiss chard and the sushi is amazing. Unfortunately the service seems to be on the decline. I visited on my birthday and our server didn't seem to pay much attention to our table, it took a long time for drinks and food to be delivered. Another time
We came there were issues with our reservation and we ended up leaving and not returning. If you can go when it's not busy I recommend it."}
{"text":"I agree with most of the people about the ambience.  It is strikingiy well done.  Great art...just  a well designed, handsome restaurant.
Now, let's move on to the food.  My husband had the cheeseburger.  Very good.  My friend and I both ordered the Ahi Tuna.  I used to go to Houston's all the time and order the Ahi salad.  Now, the lettuce is primarily cabbage, presentation was mediocre, and the dressing just wasn't the same.  Th part that bothered me most was the abundance of cabbage.  I guess maybe it holds up longer, but does not taste as good.  At one time it was $14, now it has crept up to $25.  If I want the Ahi Tuna Salad, I now go to J Alexander's because they have done an excellent job of emulating the old Houston's Ahi.  By the way, server was excellent.  Hillstone's and their organization seem to train and insist on great service, and they do a good job."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant's sister restaurant, Houston's, and was told this one is even better. The menu is similar and the quality of food is top notch. The service is also 5-star. We are big fans of the Chicago-style spinach dip with salsa and sour cream on the side. The Hawaiian ribeye (even well done) has a great, juicy flavor. My husband loves the prime rib and homemade horseradish sauce. The barbecue baby back ribs are also very tasty. . The loaded baked potato with bacon, cheese and sour cream is the perfect complement to the steaks or ribs. We sampled French fries while waiting on a table and they are even tasty. Our conclusion about Hillstone is that it's definitely as good - if not better - than Houston's. A definite 5-star place in our book, and we drive about 30+ minutes to eat here. They also take reservations, which is a plus."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite, if not my favorite restaurant in town. Luckily I started coming in here on crutches so it didn't take long to be recognized but I am always taken care of here. If you are looking for a steak you have to get the Famous Hawaiian Ribeye, and don't do yourself a disservice by not ordering the hot fudge sundae no matter how full you are"}
{"text":"When it comes to food and service, Houstons is as consistent as it gets!! This Hillstone Group restaurant should teach Fox Restaurant Concepts a thing or two about this notion. 

Anywho.... I just wanted to let all Houstons soup fans know that they just changed the Sunday soup from Mexico City style to Mushroom Artichoke. =-0 I'm personally very disappointed with the removal of this favorite. However, I love mushrooms and artichokes. This soup is two thumbs up! 

Bon Appetite!"}
{"text":"Yesterday was my second visit here and it was great.  The patio is beautiful and is a great place to relax with friends and a cocktail.  My dirty martini was fantastic and the waitress even put it in a new frosty class halfway through.  Classy!  The menu is the same as Houston's except for a few sushi rolls.  I've always enjoyed Houston's and this is no exception.  The sushi rolls are tasty too.  The patio only offers sushi, appetizers and dessert.  The hot fudge sundae is the best in town.  It's a house made hot fudge that isn't actually hot and therefore doesn't turn your ice cream into soup 4 bites in.  Genius!"}
{"text":"The place has the best Riesling in the world! Went here on sat night and had the spinach dip ( so good) and for dinner we had Thai steak salad $20 (amazing!) and the Hawaiian rib eye $34 (yummy) and for desert we had the key lime pie, which was great but the ice cream dessert was not good at all, over all the food was amazing but the price was a little high"}
{"text":"We love the chocolate sundae they serve here and recently stopped to get one.  We had to sit on the patio and the table and chairs were both dirty. Also, the hostess stand attendants were quite rude."}
{"text":"Expert service. Exceptional food every time. Beautiful ambiance!"}
{"text":"One of my favorites...was there for Father's Day at an odd time... It was pretty busy and encountered the rudest hostess ever. She basically told me it was going to be an hour wait ( insinuated I should leave) never offered to take my name, so I flat out asked her if she wanted my family and I to leave... I didn't give her a chance to speak and told her we'd be in the bar waiting... Not even 20 minutes later and a gracious new hostess sat us in the dining room. Food was excellent along with the service, it was unfortunate the nasty hostess dampened the visit to Hillstone, Phoenix, AZ."}
{"text":"Food is good. We more often than would like have to send something back because temperatures have not been correct. But still a good staple for a good meat and potatoes type of meal. Or a good sandwich. The reason for the 3 star is because we have had to send food back quite a bit and no matter reservation you always wait at least 15 min to be sat. Which is very annoying."}
{"text":"I met Monsieur here for lunch today and I was so impressed with the new look.  I've always loved Houston's (now known as Hillstone's) and the food, service and decor have always been impeccable.

The only drawback with the new location is that you can easily pass it up and the lack of parking but otherwise, it is still a winner with the best filet mignon ever!!"}
{"text":"Was there for lunch today and the food was great. We started with 2 appetizers, grilled artichokes and spinach dip. Both were nice and hot and delicious. The artichokes had a wonderful smoked grilled taste and the aioli served with them was yummy. 

I had the Thai Steak Salad and everything about it was good. Friends had the chicken sandwich, Grilled Chicken Salad, and shared the burger. Everyone had great things to say about their food.  Only complaint was that it was noisy but we could still hear the conversation and it is quite pricey."}
{"text":"It's a Houston's at the Biltmore w/a different name. Still lots of fun and actually I like this location because of the fun patio and bar. More open concept than the Houston's on Scottsdale. And a cool little fountain in the corner. Same yummy food- Hawaiian ribeye, baby back ribs, key lime pie...
Fun and lively on fri and sat nights. Just wish they had the artichokes year round. They always seem to be out when I want them the most. Tired of hearing \"they just aren't big enough..\""}
{"text":"Hillstone is my new favorite restaurant. The food is consistently good and the service is also excellent. Love the Asian noodle and steak salad, but I substitute steak for chicken. They have the best rotisserie chicken. There is a reason this place is busy seven nights a week. You can make a reservation using their website, which we always do."}
{"text":"So I decide to take my daughter here because she loves Houston's. I know they are owned by the same company but have different menu items. When we walk in I ask if there are any choices for kids and the hostess says yes a kids burger and a grilled cheese. Waitress comes over, not genuinely friendly, more like fake friendly. I ask about the kids burger since that's pretty much the only suitable option. She tells me that there's no difference btwn kids and regular burgers. Both $16. Ok I'll pass and order her a California roll. It was 5pc and very different tasting and still had imitation crab but still cost $13. I've never seen a Cali roll cast more than $8. And that's regular price, not $4 happy hour. 
I order the French dip which apparently is prime rib but mine was more fat then meat. Disgusting...had to return it. The only good part of the lunch was our appetizer, spinach dip. It's always a win. The mgr was mediocre and took off the Cali roll but acted like he just graduated with a hotel restaurant management degree and was not sure how to treat a customer. Honestly, he should've comped me and bought us dessert but knocking off an overpriced piece of sushi was better than nothing. Next time I'll go to the Henry. 100% better than this place"}
{"text":"I either order the Hawaiian ribeye or the Prime rib -- you won't be disappointed with either one, just depends on what you feel like. The prime rib is huge, I can never finish mine. The ribeye has a nice flavor to it, it reminds me of a more upscale version of a Thai bbq pork. I usually start with their house salad -- it is one of the best salads I've had. I order the brussels sprouts as a side if available -- I wish they would keep that on their menu. Love the atmosphere whenever I visit!"}
{"text":"Hillstone is one of those restaurants where you literally can't go wrong. Every time I have been, the service was great and the food was even better.

All of the burgers and sandwiches are always a safe bet (especially the California burger and the prime rib sandwich), but this last time I decided to go with the Thai steak and noodle salad and it was soooooo tasty. The steak was really well done, the noodles, peanuts, thai sauce, avocados, and the sweetness of the mangos really paired well nicely. This is a dish I would for sure try again. 

Hillstone is a great place for lunch or dinner! They are usually pretty busy so be sure to get that reservation!"}
{"text":"Well... 

My mom was still in town when I gave it another chance. She doesn't live in the states and she was so looking forward to having the salad! Can't say no to mom, right? 

So mom picked up the salad to go and again... TINY. $15 for a side salad. (Please see picture of it next to a piece of paper and you'll see what I mean fellow Houston old timers.) 

The great news was that we were able to ADD our own mixed greens to the salad to make it enough for one person + a bite for another person here and there. 

But really? Who wants to add their own greens to a salad? Defeats one of the main reason for restaurants is that you don't have to do anything except eat and enjoy. 

Just not with Hillstone's Grilled Chicken Salad..."}
{"text":"The last time we ate at Houston's, we waited 90 minutes for a table. They had quoted 45. We complained. They told us \"just five to ten more minutes\"  a few times. I was super hungry and expected something to be comped. Anything. I guess they didn't feel the same.

And let's not kid ourselves - the food is just okay. I'm convinced people eat at Houston's because it's at the Biltmore, everyone wears their church clothes, and the decor is pretty nice. Dining here makes you feel like you have money, even though it's not very expensive. Or maybe that's just me."}
{"text":"A beautiful atmosphere to have dinner, drinks, or celebrating a special occasion. The perfect ambiance. Staff was very attentive and friendly. I will definitely be going back! I ordered the Rotisserie Chicken. It was seasoned perfectly and so moist. I also had the boiled cabbage with goat cheese as my side, and a glass of red wine. A beautiful atmosphere to have dinner, drinks, or celebrating a special occasion. The perfect ambiance. The staff was very attentive and friendly. I can definitely see why it is one of the #1 Restaurants in PHX. Did not disappoint and I will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Love this restaurant!  Excellent food, consistent and  great atmosphere. Wait staff is very friendly and professional. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Love the veggie sandwich. Amazing. Fresh. Nutty, filling. The bun is buttery. I usually skip bread and did half. It's layered with fresh tomato, shredded lettuce and cheese. Of course you don't have to have cheese. Sides include killer show string potatoes. Super fresh. Kale salad with cashews. Very flavorful. So I did both. Wine list is nice. A few selections in each varietal by the glass.  I went with the Russian River Pinot after the bartender offered a couple tastes of some other possibilities. 
Great bar that I enjoyed my dinner at. As well as lovely dining in and outside. Bustling with a mix of locals and travelers like myself. The bartender knew his locals but was very attentive. It's pretty noisy. Nice romantic atmosphere however. Great choice."}
{"text":"Hillstone never fails!  The perfect drinks, steak dinner was scrumptious, and the servers are some of the best trained in the Valley.  Always a step ahead!"}
{"text":"Everything was great.  The Tomato soup was blissful.  Beautiful venue and exception service.  Luv it."}
{"text":"Very nice dining, love the food and the restaurant, just don't order the \"deep\" fired oysters. it should be taken of the menu. the sushi was very good. 
Drinks!!!! please serve the Moscow mules in a copper cup... it just does not work in a tumbler glass.
Service / wait staff was good.  I would dine here again.  not fare from 44th hotel alley."}
{"text":"Lunched here yesterday. Service is impeccable and the food was really really good.  Lots of wood creates a warm environment. Nearly all booths.  Beautiful bar area.  I'm going back soon.

Went back for dinner. Tommy is a dream server--really knowledgeable and fun!  Four of us had very different things--I loved my sushi with kale salad. It made for a relatively healthy meal.  Only disappointment was the lack of happy hour menu.  Guess they don't need it.  One of my new favorites."}
{"text":"First  time trying the restaurant.  It was not busy at 11.30 but we were seated  promptly.  The place is nicely Decorated. Service was good.very attentive but I was not a fan of the cheese burger. I do not like mustard . The flavors  was bland and the fries were too thin and overdone. Tried the coleslaw. It was a little bitter. Disappointing. Several friends really like this place"}
{"text":"I am sorry, this is one place I just cannot stop raving about.  We had a law firm night out last night and went to our #1 goto - Hillstone.  As always service was amazing, the sushi was best in town, and the beef dip cannot be beat.  Jamie our waitress made the night absolutely perfect in every way, as did the rest of the team.  Weird to find a restaurant where you cannot find any negatives.  Keep up the good work Hillstone, see you again soon!"}
{"text":"Nice place for a good dinner or to grab a drink. The staff is always inviting and willing to assist with entree choices, drink recommendations, etc. Indoor/outdoor seating available. Large bar area and dining hall. Reservations are definitely advised if you're not going to eat at the bar.  

I love the open kitchen floor plan....not that I sit near there at each visit. But its nice to take a glance on the way to powder my nose! 

I've always been well pleased with this establishment."}
{"text":"It was ok. Not the best. For a place that has so many servers, there service sucks. Plus they try and push you through dinner. They brought out our entrees three times. That means we ate old food :( Buck and Ryder down the street is better."}
{"text":"Welp, I think it is safe to say that Hillstone really never disappoints and it shows by their long wait on a Wednesday evening! {Hint Hint: Always make a reservation when coming here!} Their service is spectacular, prices are great for the quality of the food and the ambiance is cozy and romantic. I have been getting their Classic Caesar Salad with chicken for YEARS and it is the best. I am also in love with their prime rib and loaded baked potato. The sushi is fresh and fabulous too, you really can't go wrong! I know we'll be back soon for another family outing!"}
{"text":"Absolutely incredible experience.  Cozy upscale environment that was very neat and clean.  The service was unbelievable...very attentive and timely and the food to die for.  We enjoyed the mix of flavors in each dish.  If visiting this restaurant, you have to order the grilled artichokes, which aren't on the menu but definitely a dish you won't want to miss."}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best places I've eaten in a long time!!! Had the walnut salad, spinach dip, French dip and the Sunday. Plenty of food to share."}
{"text":"Make a reservation! This place is hopping on Friday and Saturday nights, and probably most other nights as well. I was not prepared for how upscale this place is - I was a bit underdressed. Most men wearing button-downs and sportcoats and most women wearing a little black dress with heels. I can see this as a good place to take a first date to really knock their socks off with fanciness.
I ordered a salad, which was tasty, but should have gone for the crispy chicken sandwich or one of the burgers - they looked delish! I will have to go again and do everything right this time :)"}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite restaurant in the valley. Every meal I've had here has been wonderful and I've never had a bad service experience. The waitstaff is amazing and the ambiance is sophisticated and cozy."}
{"text":"I have always enjoyed Houston's.  I usually end up here on a Sunday afternoon instead of a weekday night, not sure why!  I've never had an issue with the service and the waiters are knowledgeable and welcoming, but it can be annoying that they refuse to seat you until your entire party is present- even if it is only a party of two!  You'll find a pretty diverse group of people at Houston's and like others have said, it makes for some interesting people watching.  I usually suggest this place when I'm meeting up with my grandmother for a late lunch, I can't really imagine going here to hang out and meet people.  But, that might be an age thing- I think the group looking to meet and mingle here falls into the box marked well above my 25 years.

As far as the food goes, the veggie burger is AMAZING!  I eat meat, but opt for this instead of a real burger because it is so good.  The patty is nothing like a garden burger or boca burger, it doesn't pretend to be meat.  The coleslaw is also my side of choice with this meal.  The ribs are fabulous as well, some of the best!  

Overall, great food and nice atmosphere with a slight touch of snootiness thrown in the mix (I have to say- I never really get the snootiness of some of the patrons in this place, where exactly do they think they are?)"}
{"text":"Great restaurant!  We loved the environment and the bar. Tried the coconut shrimp roll and the prime rib, excellent!"}
{"text":"Be ashamed!   This girl is wearing the same outfit as me...Shorts and tank.  And I was asked to put on a long sleeve but she wasn't.  When I say are you going to ask her to wear a long sleeve...your answer is she doesn't have to bc she's a girl.   #discrimination #lasttimehere #repost #badplay @hillstonebiltmore. PS THIS WAS THE THIRS TIME IVE BEEN HERE. SECOND WITH THE SAME OUTIFT TYPE ON...last time was dinner time too.  How ironic...again did I mention discrimination?

Best part is I asked if I wore a wig and identified as a woman would I be asked to put on a different shirt...GM answer was no.  Hmmm..."}
{"text":"Short Version: Consistently awesome service and delicious food. Every time. My favorites: Prime Rib Dip, Thai Steak Salad, Hawaiian Rib Eye, Ribs, California Roll (NOT your typical, trust me) and Chicken Sandwich.

Long Version: Hillstone is consistently busy so get there early (11:30 for lunch or 5:30 for dinner) to avoid a wait.

I have a friend who makes fun of me for this because he likes supporting the small local restaurants, but I'll say it again. Hillstone is my favorite restaurant in Phoenix/Scottsdale. I come very frequently for lunch and on nights out with my wife for dinner. I'd say I've been to Hillstone 15-20 times in the last few months alone. Every. Single. Time. the service is awesome. And again, every single time, the food is awesome. 

My favorites for lunch are the Prime Rib Dip (Best French Dip I've ever had) which, as the name suggests, uses slices of Prime Rib. It's no joke. The Au Jus is awesome too. If I want something a LITTLE lighter, and I say a little, because it still has steak in it, I get the Thai Steak Salad.

For dinner we typically get the Hawaiian Rib Eye and I recently discovered how awesome the ribs are, so I'll be throwing that in the mix too. Since it's dinner, we usually get the California Roll as an appetizer. I'm a big sushi fan, so I understand when every person I eat with is hesitant when I suggest the California Roll. It's truly unique and doesn't taste anything remotely close to the traditional \"newbie\" sushi roll everyone thinks of. Just try it. Also, when it's on season, we will get the grilled artichoke.

5/5 for service and 5/5 for food. Definitely a rare one. I'm sure I'm a bigger fan boy than most and have become biased."}
{"text":"BEST Prime Rib sandwich I've ever had!!! I absolutely loved Hillstone. The atmosphere is really nice, the service is top notch, and the food is amazing. I will def be back very soon.

*Phoenix Foodies Approved!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in Phoenix. Their Hawaiian rib eye steak is to die for. I love a good martini with dinner. Our server actually came and refreshed my drink with a freshly frozen glass midway through the meal. Best service ever!"}
{"text":"This is the best restaurant in the valley.  The filet and salmon are to die for.  Great ambiance and service."}
{"text":"This is the single area chain restaurant that rarely disappoints. The Thai Noodle Salad and the \"Hawaiian\" strip steak are both excellent choices. While I love their loaded baked potato, it doesn't love my waist line. Soooo, try substituting it for their red cabbage with small scoops of goat cheese. It may not be a dieters best choice, but a tad less guilty with it on my plate than their huge potato, plus the red cabbage is super flavorful. You need reservations during \"snow bird\" season because this place is always packed!"}
{"text":"Always quality food and service. Smoked salmon appetizer is excellent.  Better atmosphere at Houston's IMO, but like either place for the food."}
{"text":"i love this restaurant so much. i have yet to have something i didn't like.

i have nothing really special to add to all of the amazing reviews except to order these things:

thai steak noodle salad- mango, avocado, tomatoes, noodles, marinated steak...i meannnnnnnnnnnnn
caesar salad - their dressing is my fav and so are the croutons
bacon, cheddar burger- so juicy, so exquisite
roast beef sandwich- raw horseradish on the side
fries- order extra bc people will eat these babies UP! 


service is ALWAYS good, it's always clean, it's always pleasant. seriously, you can't have a bad time unless you're just a miserable person."}
{"text":"Came here with a couple of family members on a Wednesday night.  One of them had a gift card and was eager to give this place a shot.  Its a good thing she had a gift card because the prices were on the high side.  I sort of expected that given this place is in the Biltmore area, and I'm usually willing to pay a premium if the food matches the hype.  Did it?

The place was packed, so before I could even think about my food I had to shout across the table just to hold a conversation.  Yeah, its loud in there.  Our server was very friendly, though we had to ask her repeatedly to speak up to hear her over the noise.  

We started with the grilled artichokes with remoulade.  This hit the spot since I love artichokes and each had a perfect char.  For my main course, I got the French Dip (in part because my brother claimed it was the best in town).  It was one of the better ones I've had as they used good quality cuts of meat for the sandwich.  For dessert I shared a brownie with nuts and ice cream with the table.  It was adequate, but didn't wow me.

So let's get to the price breakdown.  Artichokes?  $13.  French Dip w/side salad?  $25.  Brownie?  $12.  So before tip, it was $60 just for the food I ordered (never mind the food my other two family members ordered).  Maybe its just me, but if I'm gonna drop that much dough, I'd better be getting a fantastic meal.  The meal, sadly, was not fantastic.  It was adequate, even good in some spots, but not fantastic.  And the items I ordered were actually on the cheaper end of the menu.  Most of their main entree items are $35 and up.  

What this place brings to the table in terms of friendly service, an elegant atmosphere, and artfully crafted food simply doesn't measure up in terms of intimacy, flavor, or prices.  I might be tempted to try this place again on AZ Restaurant Week or another promotion when restaurants like this slash their prices, but would not come here again on a regular night.  Not enough bang for the buck."}
{"text":"MMMMmmm good.  I enjoy their food and really like the salads. It is a fun place to pop in for a lunch.  I can go light or heavy with a meal and get a enjoyable glass of wine to go with it."}
{"text":"Hillstone is a super nice, beautiful place. Great atmosphere. The food is very good, I wouldn't say spectacular, but it was good. I had the French Dip Au Jus. The meat was very pink, looked raw. I didn't really like that. My bf got the prime rib, it was soo yummy. Came right off the bone. All together our meal was about $80. We only got one appetizer too. It's kinda too pricy for the mediocre food."}
{"text":"While considering dining options for our Phoenix trip I skipped over Hillstone once I saw it was affiliated with Houstons.  Chain....skip.  Imagine my surprise then when we were heading back from hiking at the Grand Canyon and we were tired, covered in clay, starving and in desperate need of food and a drink.  We skipped the idea of even going back to our hotel to shower as it was on the later side (9:45PM).  We drove by Hillstone, I recalled the mostly favorable reviews, it was open so we pulled in.  SO glad we did.  We had such a delightful experience at the bar.  The bartender was awesome....from picking out the perfect french white to his service, we had a great experience.

Best part of the meal...the veggie burger.  Might of been one of the best things I ate while in PHX.  Worst...rainbow roll.  They were out of the roll we wanted and the bartender said this one would be great.  It's not sushi if it's rolled with a thick mayo-crab mixture.  yuck.  I want to taste the fish. 

Hillstone has a fantastic patio and great open floor plan. 

Two tired hikers thank you for a great evening!"}
{"text":"IF YOU HAVE KIDS YOU MUST READ!!!
My husband and I have never been more insulted at a restaurant than tonight at the Hillstone Restaurant (Biltmore).
This is the same restaurant group that includes Bandera and Houston's. 

We deliberately went out early-- at 5pm -- with another couple and our son. He started to fuss on and off during dinner. Mind you the restaurant was already noisy when the GM Miranda Geranios instructed us to leave; other patrons were complaining. That was news to us- and we've seen far worse outbursts in the past from children. Ironically, our son at that moment was playing happily with the other couple when she rudely asserted herself. 

We were in the middle of dinner and to add insult to injury, she didn't even offer to compensate us for a future visit without our little guy. Just go home without dinner and pay the bill. Of course, she herself has no children. 
To ask a repeat customer to leave is absolutely disgusting. We will never visit any of their establishments again and wanted to share our unfortunate experience with our friends who also know the challenges of having a family."}
{"text":"The dings crispy chicken sandwich is so good!! I've had it maybe 15 times. Trust me. Try it!!"}
{"text":"Hillstone is a great restaurant.  It has consistently good service and food.  The artichoke appetizer is definitely my favorite!

Hillstone is always busy and for the longest time would not take reservations.  Now they do accept reservations and it is worth your time making one.

I have eaten just about everything on the menu at one point or another and it is all good.  From sushi to the appetizers to the entrees you are good.

In my opinion, this place is priced fairly for what they offer."}
{"text":"Best French dip ever.  Seriously. Ribs awesome as are stringy fries. Pricey but great on occasion."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere great service.  I have had several of there dishes and I haven't had anything that I didn't like.  My favorite dish to order is the Thai Noodle salad with beef.  It's addicting you will be thinking about this salad days after you have eaten it."}
{"text":"Two words: French Martini. I love the atmosphere, food & cocktails. Perfect place to indulge. Don't skip the sushi it is amazing!"}
{"text":"I took my husband here for dinner for his birthday.  Right off the bat, I gotta say that if you are waiting for your table to be ready and there's no room at the bar... you'll be standing.  There's no seating in the lobby of the restaurant so when your wait it 20+ minutes- prepare to be on your feet if the bar is full, which it was.

The menu is small but that always suggests to me that they have really mastered their menu.  They have lots of wine choices and a full bar.  The wait staff is really on top of their game as far as refills and checking on you.

My husband ordered the Hawaiian rib eye and was very satisfied.  It was a generous portion and a huge loaded baked potato.  I ordered the salmon.  The fish was good but be warned that it's all cooked medium.  I had to send it back to be cooked more.  I don't know if that's a fine dining thing but I've never gotten a fish that wasn't cooked all the way through.

Also, if you're a vegetarian and ordering a salad- make sure you ask no bacon.  I got a side salad and it came loaded with bacon so my husband ended up eating most of it.  They don't have many options for vegetarian dining.

For two dinners, a side salad, an appetizer and one drink (my husband had water) our bill came to $88 w/ tip.  Pricey."}
{"text":"WOW! one of my top 5 dinning experiences ever! featuring THE GREATEST SANDWICH I'VE EVER HAD! French Dip sandwich!

Firstly the building and decor look like Tony Starks house in the Iron man movies. Super classy, and cool. Service is phenomenal. 

I've tried a bunch of the menu items and they were all amazing. But the real star of the show is the french dip sandwich. 

It's perfectly constructed, with finely sliced meat cooked medium rare, so it stays in a tight bundle as it's dipped repeatedly in the au jus without meat falling out. The bread is soft yet holds up against the significant portion of meat, and resists getting too soggy from the au jus. Its served with phenomenal fries that remind me of the shoe string fries of Ruth's chris. 

There is a passion for food and customer well-being that comes across in every dish. They are absolutely obsessed with quality food, and it will leave you in awe. 

The french dip is without a doubt the most beautiful thing a human can experience between two slices of bread. 

I think it's worth going to Arizona just for this sandwich and I plan on doing just that in the future."}
{"text":"I went to Hillstone for lunch today thinking wow this place must be really good because I looked up the menu and the prices seem very high even for lunch. Well my oysters were good, but definitely not worth $16 for 6 of them also I had two margaritas which were well margaritas they tasted good but at $10 a pop way overpriced. So my overall impression is why would I spend $39 for two drinks and an appetizer plus a 20% tip when I can get twice as much food for half the price at seasons 52 and seasons 52 has a much better interior design anyway, hillstones decor is nothing special at all"}
{"text":"I love Hillstone because it's also owned with Banderas and Houstons. I would recommend the rainbow roll because of the citrus flavoring they put inside! ( it's amazing) . I would also recommend the tuna roll as well. I love the ambience because it's dark and the atmosphere is very relaxing. You can sit at the bar as well. I would make this my monthly trip to come and eat here."}
{"text":"I wish I could give 4 stars BUT the customer service is absolutely awful!  Turning people away for wearing fashionable attire is ridiculous!"}
{"text":"Let me start out by saying that I really like their food.  I have never been disappointed... but I always leave there thinking why did we spend so much money on two burgers and a few drinks.   I have been other places where I get equally good food with equally good service at half the price.   Maybe the reason for the high priced food is for the numerous servers that come to your table throughout your dinner... one to take your drink/appetizer order... one to bring your drinks... someone to take your dinner order... another to bring it... different one to check on you.  seems excessive and i never know who my waiter/waitress is:).  All in all I don't have anything negative to say but don't feel like I can give them 4 stars."}
{"text":"Really it'd be a 3.5 star, but edged up by the great service and really above par design of the place.

We got the grilled artichokes to start.  It was very simple and good with a tasty aoli to dip it in.  The char on it was perfect and you can really taste it - not sure if its wood?

The burger of course had that great flavor on it as well.  It was a gigantic meat patty full of fatty flavor.  The bun was almost strong enough to handle it all, and there was an aoli it seems on it as well.  The shoestring fries that accompanied both our dishes were a bit greasy - kinda reminded me of In-and-Out but maybe a little crispier.  They have ketchup and a spicy aoli which was disappointingly not as good on the fries.  It has a very asian taste to it - like red pepper, rice wine and sesame oil taste.  It might be better with calamari or something else..

The chicken sandwich was innovative - it was presented as a sub cut into 3 sections which is nice.  It had a kale based slaw on it, which was delicious but a bit too dressed.  The chicken cutlets were VERY thin in some sections (think McDonald's burger patty thin!) so you can hardly taste any chicken.  I even considered taking apart a section to double up the chicken in the segment I ate.  Generally, I don't like too much meat in my sandwiches too so this was definitely a first.

So this far in I'm thinking this is a 3 and I feel terrible from all the grease and mayo-like sauces I just ate.  Then the waiter talks me into a 5 nut brownie dessert that makes me want to go back even now as I write this.  Pistachio, macadamia nut, walnut, and who cares.  AWESOME, and WHY DIDN'T ANYONE THINK OF THIS SOONER??  

I'm definitely gonna check out their happy hour and get that brownie again."}
{"text":"Hillstone: you are overrated. You think you are better than you are. Every time I go, I am disappointed and my friends say we are never coming back. 
We sure miss Houston's in the Biltmore. You tried, but it's not the same. 
There are so many great places in Phoenix. Hillstone is good. Not great."}
{"text":"This is \"our\" go to spot for any romantic date night out with my boyfriend, Erik! We absolutely love the artichoke and I am a sucker for their fudge sundae. I can't for the life of me remember her name, but we always have the best server who somehow remembers us even when it's been month!
Always have a reservation, makes seating go by way faster."}
{"text":"When you have impeccable service and phenomenal food, you will always have my attention and adoration. THIS place is my fave spot for every excuse possible to frequent it. It hits the mark every time. I love sitting at the bar or patio area because Hillstone just attracts quite the crowd of movers and shakers because what's the fun in a staring contest. 

Definitely start with the house-smoked salmon. That in itself could be your entire meal with a couple of glasses of wine, but then I would be short changing you a review of their offerings wouldn't I? On a side note, always order the grilled artichokes if they are available. It will seriously ooze goodness all over your mouth. The last thing I think about is salad at a steakhouse, but I will say that the Blue Cheese Wedge Salad,  Chicken Kale Salad or the Yellowtail Sashimi Salad are my fave side dishes to accompany the Hawaiian Rib Eye, or the Prime Rib. 

Here's the crazy thing. They have sushi and I haven't even tried that because I am so smitten by the other choices. Says a lot for me to give 5 stars without trying everything.  I actually will have to venture back strictly for that feasting. While their sister restaurant Houston is a fave, Hillstone takes the spotlight. It sits in a class of its own, maybe because every outing has always left me with a dazzling smile. Parking can be nuts but I promise it's worth the walk and you'll appreciate the stroll after gorging on their culinary delights."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a steak and Fish restaurant the menu is ideal.  Their poultry is also worth a try.  Go for the grilled artichoke ....fabulous!  The bar waitstaff was very attentive and fun. Definitely a place to revisit."}
{"text":"We stopped in for lunch last month on a Saturday and enjoyed our relaxing lunch.  I ordered a crisp Sauvignon Blanc and the crispy chicken sandwich with baby swiss, tomato and spicy slaw with a side of fries.  We sat at the bar and enjoyed watching some sports on the TV's too.  Really nice atmosphere that makes you feel transported to a Frank Lloyd Wright building, good service and consistently good food!"}
{"text":"There are only a couple of restaurants that I would eat at every day, and this is one of them. My wife and I have eaten everything on the menu at least once with our favorite appetizer being the grilled artichoke, favorite sandwich the french dip, favorite seafood the swordfish (when available), love the hawaiian rib eye and the hot fudge sundae makes sure that I go into a carbo coma and my wife has to drive home. The wine list always has a pleasant surpise on it and the staff are attentive and sensitive at the same time. If you have never had the experience of dining here, don't cheat yourself any longer. I have been an restaurant owner and in the food business for over 30 years and this place is one of the best I have been in for great overall experience."}
{"text":"got the veggie burger after reading it being one of the best.

i liked how it was loaded with lettuce, tomatoes, and pickles.  veggie patty itself was made of a lot of rice, beans, caramelized onions, etc.  good flavor-a tad sweet and sticky.  i did not think it imitated or tasted a lot like meat though.
got barley salad as my side.  i like it. a little on the bland side, which i prefer.  love barley.  mixed with cherry tomatoes and almonds.

creative and decent burger.  very filling.

restaurant looks very nice.   full bar and a patio. they dont serve food in the patio though, only snacks and apps (at least thats what i overheard waiting for my burger..)"}
{"text":"Food is decent, but overpriced. A nice selection of wines -- but once again, overpriced. Hillstone is a bit pretentious -- thinks it is something it is not. There are much better places if you are going to pay those prices."}
{"text":"Before when it was Houston's - it was my favorite restaurant in all of Phoenix. Things have changed a bit when they moved and became Hillstone, but I'm still a pretty big fan. My favorite is the ribs. Super pricey, but really tasty. I don't like the new fries. I loved the old shoestring ones. I also miss the cous cous I used to get but they took away. These are some of the changes I don't like.  Their spinach/artichoke dip is my other favorite that I get every time.  Best you will get anywhere and all made fresh in house.  Best part of Houstons' is that they tend to make all food from scratch unlike other places that use lots of frozen, premade food.

The interior of this restaurant and their patio are really nice.  Love the Koi pond in the front entrance. They used to have a lot of Koi but in the past year there are just a few.  What happened to the fishies????

Service is usually pretty good too, though sometimes you get a dud.  The old Houston's had some of the best servers ever and was the only place where I always tip at least 20% because they deserve it!

In all this is a good restaurant and one of the few I'd recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"Worst service. After being sat way later than our reservation time, our party was Forced to sit in separate tables because they did not have a table
Available to accommodate."}
{"text":"Awesome french dip!  Return just for that sandy.  Fries are good as well.  Make sure to add cheese and extra horseradish sauce.  Caesar salad not bad either.  Will be back, for the same thing."}
{"text":"It was everything I hoped it would be. The food was amazing, ambiance was amazing, and our server was very friendly and attentive. I was surprised to see the sushi menu. Guess I haven't been in a while. One thing I did notice was different was the blue cheese. It was very different than from in the past. Noticed just because it's one of my favorite things to ask for when I'm there, side of blue cheese crumbles for my salad."}
{"text":"It's basically the Houston's menu...but still good. This is a great location and has nice indoor and outdoor seating with fire features. The spinach dip and prime rip dip are two of my favorite things to get here. Wine list has great selection and good prices for bottles even considering the mark up."}
{"text":"I'm still not sure why they closed Houston's and opened this up down the street.  It is basically the same thing.  The only real difference is that the decor is awesome and super swank.  I want my house to look like this place.  The food and service is the same as Houston's and is top notch as always.

I always get some sort of beef when I am there and I swear next time I'm going to get a cooked fish dish or the sushi."}
{"text":"I must admit I am not a fan of the chain restaurant! 

That said I feel this place does a lot of things right and I would certainly go back again. 

The food was very good, not great but it comes at a great price and it's presented well. 

The thing that I was most impressed by was the service. I don't know that I have had service like that in Mpls. The staff backed up each other like no other brigade I've seen. Well dressed and great personalities.

If your in the area it's a must try!"}
{"text":"Last week, we caught bar stools & dinner on a hopping evening at Hillstone. With the holidays approaching, make sure to make reservations here unless you are patient for standing room only!

The sushi is quite cold, tastes super fresh and is memorable. The caeser salad was a bit underwhelming; if you order with rotisserie chicken added, there is an up charge, as well as an assumption that the homemade croutons are not desired.  The great service brings me the side of croutons, with a minor wait. However, it really appeared that there had been portion cost analysis on this entree. Suffice to say, I tried the tuna poke to fill up a bit more.

Beau had the Thai noodle steak salad and it remains a favorite.

So, Hillstone is certainly a favorite but it does not come cheap. It is also the best bar for people watching."}
{"text":"I LOVE this neighborhood restaurant. The best sushi roll on the menu is the Thai Tuna Roll. It's delicious! My husbands go-to menu choice is the ribs. They are consistently amazing. Do yourself a favor and order the red cabbage and goat cheese as one of your side dishes. This seasonal favorite is available in the winter only."}
{"text":"First time trying Hillstone. Went for a coworker's farewell lunch. Wait service was good, not friendly at times. Runners delivered food & picked up empty dishes at times without saying a word. Food was great. The Smoked Salmon was delicious as an appetizer/starter. Ordered Ding's Crispy Chicken Sandwich. It was served like sliders, it came as a trio. Possibly need to rethink the choice of bread for the \"sandwich,\" it was too much bread & fell apart when I picked it up. Receptionist/Greeter seemed a bit frazzled when challenged. I had made reservations for my group, called to increase the number of attendees a few days prior & was  told that they are unable to sit more than 6 people at a table, group larger than 6 would have to be split up & no guarantee of sitting near.  However they would ensure that my group would be next to each other. We did sit next to each other & we had different servers. Tables are all booths-so terrible for groups larger than 6, everyone gets crammed in & they failed to mention that. Had I known I would have moved the gathering elsewhere. 3 Stars only because of the food, if not than 2."}
{"text":"Five stars. Server Allison and general Manager Amanda were amazing. We had made to order Sushi, Poke and other great appetizers. Steaks were cooked perfectly and the French dip is to die for!"}
{"text":"After literally 25 years of going to the Houston and Hillstone restaurants in Phoenix, I am now completely disappointed with them!  For all my daughter's birthdays, they have written Happy Birthday on her plate in chocolate every time we have asked. So naturally when my daughter said she wanted to go there for her graduation celebration,I called to ask if they could simply do a Congratulations plate. I was told \"we have never done that\". Well there's the first lie right there. They've been doing it for years.  Second they said \"we don't have the tools to do it\". There's the second lie. My husband is a chef and has actually talked to their staff about the plates before. They most certainly have the ability. So what this boils down to is that this Manager that has been with the company for only 4 months has now destroyed the awesome experiences I have had with my family for years. What happened to the amazing customer service that the Hillstone corporation used to provided?  When did it stop mattering to them that they had a loyal customer for over 25 years!  Extremely disappointed!"}
{"text":"One of my very favorites in the Valley. Standouts: coconut shrimp roll (the ponzu sauce it comes with is good enough to drink and I ask them to let me keep it bc it's seems to be good on everything...considering using it as a means to get action from my husband bc he loves it as much as me), thai steak salad (for heaven's sake, get it with the steak, NOT the chicken bc GOSH who needs another chicken salad and the steak is alarmingly good) and the key lime pie. YUM. 
Of course, when I first began going here, way back when, the only thing I could ever order was the Prime Rib French Dip because it's PRIME RIB french dip and it's perfect as a sandwich that costs $17 could be. If I was a menu item, I would be jealous of that sandwich. In fact, I would put that sandwich up against any MENU item in town and it would hold up. 
I'm in a reviewing mood, otherwise, I would just continue to take/recommend this place to anyone I loved. I'm trying to tell you, go here. Right away. I've been here many many many times and it is always a treat."}
{"text":"Was excited to try this place in the Biltmore area.. Love the openness of it! It's trendy... Cool.. Nice patio .. Good wine list. Don't like the trek to the restroom as I was lead thru the stand where the wait staff are picking up food and I felt a bit out of place and in the way! Was impressed with the wine stock ,however. The menu was good, although we all just had martinis and wines... A bit of an issue with the bill when mine was placed on theirs... All figured out by finally finding our waitress:-)"}
{"text":"Food is always incredible. Service is the best. Noise level is painfully and unnecessarily loud."}
{"text":"I don't know if it was an off night when my husband and I went to Hillstone, but we did not have a pleasant experience. We are huge fans of both Huston's and Bandera, so we looked forward to dining here. The ambiance is great. I think it has one of the best patios in town. 

We arrived and they were on a 15 minute wait. We sat down at the bar for a drink and no one waited on us. We finally had to flag someone down, even though a bar staff was standing two feet away from us. Our drinks were delivered on time, but we were given the wrong check, which meant we had to wait again. 

We were seated and our waiter arrived right away. It was awkward because the lamp came down so low we couldn't see his face. It was like we were talking a headless body. We ordered dinner and he didn't ask if we wanted salads to start. 

When the food came out, he set the plates down and walked away. Didn't ask if we needed anything else, or check to see if everything looked fine. The food was okay. Not the best. Definitely not Huston's quality. My tuna was medium, and it should have been rare. My husband had a good steak, but it was nothing to write home about. 

I honestly felt like the waiter was already cut and trying to get out for the night. He really rushed us through dinner and didn't try to up sell anything. 

Overall, we didn't fall in love with it. We did love the patio, so think this may be a happy hour spot only."}
{"text":"Visited Hillstone to give them another try a couple weeks ago.  Finally had the time to sit down and write an update.

As usual the food was great.  The service, while better this occasion was still a bit off.  Two examples:

1) Length of time for wait staff to revisit our table for refreshments was fairly lengthy in comparison to the old Houston's.

2) When asked about the sauce used in the Thai Tuna Roll, the waitress looked very blank and then said it was in the roll. She replied, tuna and some sort of Thai sauce.  Noooo kidding.

I will give this place another chance and another star because I really like their food.  I will more than likely return.  However, I will update with new reviews until it's back to the place I remember."}
{"text":"We may not have a lot of bragging rights here in Phoenix, but being able to sit on a patio in November and have a few cocktails is such a luxury, especially when you bring along out-of-town visitors.  My friend from Denver won't see a patio for months, so I was thrilled to introduce her to Hillstone.  Maybe it was the fact that we were just having cocktails and not ordering food that set the weird tone of the evening - or maybe the wait-staff at Hillstone just sucks.

I'd been to Hillstone twice, once for lunch and once for dinner.  I've always found them (Hillstone/Houston's) overpriced, but a nice night out.  The atmosphere is really nice, the food is not exactly innovative, but it's consistent.  I'm not going to get into a Houston's/Hillstone comparison here - the food is about the same as always, but the new location is very pretty.

My friends and I found a table on the patio and settled in for some drinks and girl-talk.  The fireplace was awesome and there are heaters placed here and there for us thin-blooded Zonies.  The waitress came along shortly to take our orders, and our Denver buddy got the first RULE of the evening.  She ordered a cocktail and asked for a double (Hey, we had some major catching up to do - we wanted a little alcohol to get us started.)  She was immediately informed by our sneery server that Hillstone does not serve doubles.  It's just not that sort of a place - they don't want to be known as a drinking establishment.  To break the awkward silence, I joked that maybe the server could bring my friend two drinks instead of a double, that got me nothing but an icy stare.  I ordered a diet coke and a shot of tequila.  I'm not a big drinker, but do like a little buzz now and then, so I get it quickly and then sip on my soda.  RULE#2 - I was told I could not drink my tequila all at once.  Hillstone does not allow \"shots\", so I must sip my shot of Hornitas.  OK, I'm 53 years old and this person is actually instructing me how to drink my beverage?  Really?

While we did enjoy our mandated cocktails and tried hard to follow the RULES at Hillstone, I'm afraid the tone of our much-anticipated evening just never really recovered.  It's a fun place, especially at night when the Cougars are out and on the hunt - great for people watching and relaxing, but I think the drink ordering moment proved so uncomfortable for our server that she left us high-and-dry for the rest of the evening.  We wondered if we were not Hillstone worthy as we searched for someone to bring us a coffee with Baileys.  We eventually flagged her down and got our beverages, but...it wasn't really fun to be there anymore.      

Hillstone staff please understand that your place of employment being kind of cool and pretty does not earn you the right to be jerks to your customers.  I won't be back.  Oh, and on a side note, Hillstone, the kitty litter floor on your patio is just weird.  I had to empty the sand out of my shoes several times.  

I wish Hillstone would get it.  Such potential - such a disappointment."}
{"text":"We wandered in late (9:00pm) on a Monday night and found the place pretty full with happy diners. We really were looking for a good affordable meal and when we found out the high prices, we were a bit wary.  We stayed and cautiously ordered the crab cake app. WOW!  So fresh and delicious with little roasted cherry tomatoes like pieces of heaven.  Our meals were equally good and high quality to match the prices.  I had an asian salad with bits of filet mignon and my husband had the fish sandwich.  Worth every penny with impeccable service. We will return and can't wait to try the sushi!!"}
{"text":"\"Happy houred\" with some friends here...great drinks, yummy food, friendly helpful staff, and a lively atmosphere.  Definitely will be back soon!  Thank you Hillstone."}
{"text":"I had a very nice meal here, definitely a place I'd return to. The place is comfortable, looks great, and has a nice ambience to it.

I ordered the Hawaiian ribeye, with a loaded baked potato. The steak was very good, cooked a perfect medium rare, with a not-overwhelmingly sweet glaze. The potato was pretty decent as well. For dessert, I asked to be surprised with whatever they recommended, and was served a tasty ice cream sundae.

It was very good, on my short list for places to go for a nice night out."}
{"text":"Not such a great place.  Ordered the Tuna Special and within 2 hours at the emergency room with food poisoning.  Their insurance company is not very nice to deal with.  I have taken a number of clients here, I will never return based on the treatment."}
{"text":"Had lunch here and was pleased all around. Very pleasant experience and French Dip was amazing."}
{"text":"Such a lovely place! One of my favorite in the valley. My top dish is the French dip. It's perfect. The kale salad is just as good. It would be my 'last meal', no joke. 

The service is ALWAYS great. Always."}
{"text":"It is a good thing I did not read the Yelp reviews before going, so I went in with no prejudices.  I had a great experience, good food, attentive service, and thoroughly enjoyed the ambiance.  Also, we had a two year old granddaughter with us, and that is the true test of a restaurant's mettle.  They handled that challenge with ease, and while I agree this is not the place for a toddler, it all worked out in the end.  By the way, I had the roasted chicken dinner and it is probably the best chicken ever.  I would love to have the recipe.  It was fabulous!"}
{"text":"hillstone is my new favorite!  

i almost always sit at the bar with friends to eat and watch what ever game is on.  

Jill is usually my server and she is wonderful.

the food has always been perfect.  i'm a huge face of all their sushi as well as the japanese ribeye.  Saturday is their Chili and it is also exceptional."}
{"text":"LOVE Hillstone it never dissapoints.  We ended up at Hillstone last night after being badly mistreated at another restaurant.  (an hour and a half wait that never got us a table)  We arrive at HILLSTONE  hungry & frustrated we explained to the host what happened..... He told us another 20 min. wait we went to the bar and before we had our drinks we had a table! Not to mention a complimentary appetizer and a really lovely waitress.  We were so grateful to be treated so well and the food was outstanding!  Hillstone saved our girls night out and cemented our love of the restaurant!"}
{"text":"Very very very nice place. Indoor and outdoor seating. Romantic dim light and candle light. Service was great. The food was very good. Recommend by a coworker, ordered fried bass which was not on the menu, truth be told it was the best fried fish I have ever had! It is a bit costly but worth it. Ordered the brownie ice cream dessert, it had coffee in it (I don't like coffee) it was good, very rich and chocolatey."}
{"text":"Had a couple of nice times here but my last visit was and will forever be my last visit. Took my wife for Sunday brunch here last summer and it all went horribly wrong. Bad table, bad snooty waitress, disconnected Scottsdale dude who managed the place went through the motions when we walked out prior to getting our main courses. I have never been made to feel like I wasn't welcome somewhere by a server until that time. I told the waitress (who was the cause of 90% of our bad experience) that we were not staying to continue to be treated like this. She suddenly became very worried we were going to \"tell\" on her. It didn't matter much anyway because as soon as I started telling the space-case manager what was wrong, he didn't even let me finish my first sentence before trying to buy my silence with gift cards, etc. I know they are a great looking restaurant and they have good food, but you are NO better than the people you serve, so remember that. Tip: Houston's has  nearly the same menu."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic for a restaurant chain. (It is part of the same group that own's Houston's). The three times I've been there it has been really busy, but we got great service every time. My favorite items on the menu are the Coconut Shrimp Roll & the tortilla soup! The soup changes daily, so they only have it once or twice a week."}
{"text":"A delightful and tasteful restaurant Hillstone is. Not only is the food a real treat, but the atmosphere and architecture is beautiful. A large and creative patio always adds a different vibe to your dining experience. 

This evening I tried their sushi as an additional appetizer and the Spicy Tuna Roll hit the spot. The chefs create and jazz up your typical sushi roll, I would highly recommend.

The staples I personally order are the artichoke appetizer and Ahi Tuna Burger.  The artichoke is a delectable, Hillstone prepares and cooks this dish to perfection. You are able to order a full artichoke or half if you are feeling a little stuffed. Be prepared, the Ahi Tuna is a large sandwich and filling. The ahi is cooked medium rare and placed on a bun with a delicious sauce. I have yet to try any steak/salad but this is definitely next on my list. 

In addition to my list, I would love a nice ice cream sundae with a warm cookie for brownie! I highly recommend Hillstone if you are in this area, you will not regret your experience. The staff are very helpful and friendly to meet your needs on any given night."}
{"text":"Every time I come here I get either the burger or French dip. I think New York Times rated it like the 2nd best burger in the US. I would agree. I don't like that diet coke is by the bottle and you pay for refills - a little annoying - and it is a somewhat pricey restaurant but the food is really really really really really good. That makes it worth it. This restaurant group does have a number of locations, and I have been to a lot of the in different states, but this location specifically on Camelback is by far superior to the others (Dallas, Scottsdale, Boston, etc). Couple other things to know: no mashed potatoes during the daytime, baked potato only offered during weekend during lunch, not on weekdays during lunch. I usually come in jeans and polo shirt and, since it is Arizona, flip flops and I am always under dressed. Highly recommended restaurant."}
{"text":"This review is solely based off of the pretentious atmosphere. Hillstone does have some friendly servers and good food but unfortunately the hostess area can be a little entitled. Being in the food industry you should know to be accomdating and if not at least friendly. We had a reservation for 5 and because my family invited me along there was 6. The hostess with a big bun on her head and white pearls said \"No we cannot fit 1 more person. That won't work\" No sense of respect or an \"I'm sorry it doesn't look like we can squeeze a seat in.\" Etc. Having worked at lower price ticket restaurant when I was 19 I know better that in this type of business you want to be customer service friendly and try to be accomdating. My cousins came in late so there was 6 and I'm sorry but I was going to tell my family member who just moved her to turn around drive an hour back home. He sat down with us in the booth. It wasn't too tight and we were not in anybodys way. Yet even a female manager came over introduced herself with no smile. Explained that these booths are meant for 5 and asked if we are comfortable here in a snooty manner. Then we said yes of course we had an unplanned guest and obviously has a reservation we are fine. But if anything larger is available then that would be amazing. She rolled her eyes and said no and that wanted to make sure... lol if that's your management coming to identity that we are in trouble in a manipulative way, I don't think me, my 85 year old grandma and grandpa and mother and father and cousin are blind to your entitled snobbish personalities that run this place. I would say it's good food but no interest in coming to a place with such low class."}
{"text":"Average expensive food. Service was average too. There is nothing wrong with average. Average sets the standard for above average and exceptional. Just when you are paying premiums, the taste and service should be commensurate.
SIDE NOTE: Coleslaw was way above average. Had to mention that.
I felt like this restaurant thinks their patrons should feel lucky to dine there. I did enjoy my meal, the atmosphere and decor.
Thank you for keeping the statistical bell curve healthy."}
{"text":"It has been months since I was last here but they haven't skipped a beat.

From the immediate attention from the hostess, and our server was flawlessly just steps behind us as we cozied into the best booth in the place. 

Dinner was casual yet way more than that, I wanted it to be perfect and it was just as it was at the Parlor last weekend and again last night it was perfection at Hillstone. I expected no less at either spot, yet at my 2 favorite restaurants in Az both places exceded my expectaions.

Hillstone cuts NO corners ever!!! Even a burger, French dip and artichochoke dip arrive perfectly timed and perfect in every way.

Whats the secret? and why are there just a few restaurants like it?!?!"}
{"text":"Some restaurants are ok but you just don't think about coming back to them. Not Hillstone. I am there at least 2-3 times per month and it is always great. 
The building is new, beautiful architecture, interior has great lighting, both natural during a day and artificial at night. I like cozy relaxing places and I feel always very relaxed after 2-3 hour dinner there. 
Food - always excellent, especially Thai Salad, sushi, artichokes, chicken, soups... everything I tried was good. Service: on a scale from 1-5: I give them 5+. Coffee is local , from LUX. 
The beautiful patio has comfy furniture and a fireplace. 
Sometimes you need to wait 45 minutes for a table,  so it is a good idea to avoid the most busy parts of the day. I took there several of my out of state clients and they all were impressed."}
{"text":"Long overdue feedback missing by me to add to Yelp. I have been a Houston's fan for many years and have failed to give them as much credit as they deserve. The transition from Houston's to Hillstone did not change the great service, wait staff, bartenders  and best quality tasting food. Majority of the same menu items are still being served along with some new tasty dishes and may I add Sushi has joined the family. The new location has a small area that includes Sushi Chefs who make a limited variety of fresh Sushi options to enjoy. The bar area is defiantly happening. You will find me there on Tuesdays or Thursdays because that is the nights they serve their famous Tortilla Soup. 

Some things I would like to add is they patio is beautiful with brown tone desert scenery. There are bar stools and comfy couch chairs to wine and dine in. There is a limited menu on the patio so if you want the real yum-yum you got to dine indoors. During the cold winter nights there is a fire pit that is in the patio and main walking entrance. A small built in pond at the entrance of large exotic goldfish to great you. As soon as you walk through the doors the fresh aroma of food from the Kitchen is right at the door. Along with a visual aid of all the variety of dining options to choose from. There is a hostess to lead you to your table or direct you to the bar. The bar includes a big screen for all you sports fans."}
{"text":"I am noticing a disturbing trend at Hillstone, prices creeping up and portion size creeping down. I am worried execs are trying to squeeze a bit more profit out.  Let's hope I am wrong but I have seen this trend before and it doesn't end well."}
{"text":"Went there for mini date. Had the sea bass I believe. Boyfriend had the steak Thai noodle. The best dish ever! Even better than mines and it wasn't bad for $15 bucks. But there menu doesn't have much, they couldn't make me a sex on the beach :("}
{"text":"Went there with my wife 2 times now and sat at the bar on each occasion.  The bartender Tom was working both times.  His service is really good.  The ribs are phenomenal.  The Burger is awesome.  I probably said out loud a few times, Ohhh my God was good."}
{"text":"Reliably great food with friendly staff. However, their prices can be a bit steep, ie. $21 for a French dip (albeit a delicious one, but it's still a sandwich). Hawaiian rib eye is a great choice if you're a steak lover."}
{"text":"Popped in for a quick midafternoon snack and was blown away by quality food and service!  thank you Jessica for listening to us carefully and checking out our requests.  we had three great sushi dishes and our teenage son had his fries!  best fries ever!   the sushi we chose was wrapped in soy paper and fabulously flavored! we chose to sit outside and a limited menu but nicely featured with a little of everything you might want for small bites. AND the prices were reasonable!  
I had previously had dinner here also and can't recommend more highly the unique and amazing choices!"}
{"text":"Now remember that I will always review based on the type of place I am at.

Cuisine = 5 stars!!  
I had Spinach dip and a delicious burger.  My companions had very delicious meals as well, even the person who received the wrong meal.  Now I will admit that In the dark restaurant, and her being starving due to the late dinner, my young guest did eat her entire meal before realizing it was the incorrect item. She also stated that it was delicious. It was, however the wrong food and there were multiple incorrect delivered items during the course of the meal.

Service = 3 stars.  
Our server, although nice, was not very attentive.  When we asked her for specific items such as refills or warm towels because 2 of our people had ribs, we were greeted with a smile and a yes but a look that made us feel that this was a foreign concept.

Experience = 2 stars
Now let me explain this.  It was not a terrible experience.  However, when at a place such as Hillstone and paying the prices that go with them, I expect better.  We were delivered $30 in drinks we didn't order and sent them back.  At the end of the meal, we were charged with them and had to make the correction. I feel this should have been resolved far prior to me seeing the bill, especially knowing they had been entered incorrectly.  We told our server about the situation, and a good server should review their bill before delivering it to the table.
#2 was the incorrect meal.  One of the main issues was the meal brought was 130% of the cost of the meal ordered.  I give my table some blame for not realizing they were eating the wrong thing, but it should not have been a situation.  In the end, the server offered to charge us for the meal ordered, but then wound up not being able to do that.  They comped an appetizer to help, but that was on anther person's tab.  

All in all, I will give them another shot someday.....maybe.  But with the Phoenix food market being what it is, It is not a high priority."}
{"text":"I have to say the food is very good; however it is absolutely DISTURBING that when you visit on the weekend or after business hours the staff categorizes you as a party that can't afford the visit or \"shouldn't belong there.\"  Very sad because I as a business woman have been present and contributed more than $1k this week.  We came in dressed like we are relaxing this weekend and we were treated poorly compared to other tables.  Sad sad sad ------- why stereotype?  Awful- 

When I am in my business suit (3 times/week), it's a different story.   My a$$ is kissed ongoing during the week;  however, today I was pushed out due to what they \"THOUGHT\" my wallet held.

Though the food is absolutely amazing, I prefer to go elsewhere that doesn't stereotype.  If I can't come back in my comfy clothes - I'll move on----

Hillstone ----- kiss my a$$"}
{"text":"Food was great - yay kitchen,  bar, and hostess staff!  However, our particular waitstaff person was not very good tonight.  They brought water once after we asked when glasses were empty.   In the middle of our appetizer is when they asked for our dinner order, which they could have easily done when they took our appetizer order.  We had finished our appetizer and no one had taken our menus from our humble little table.  When appetizer plates were cleared by a peer, the menus were picked up.

Their peers did their best to keep us hydrated as they passed by, but that individual was not keeping us happy, as they wanted to clear out and go home for the night.  We still had drinks at the table and they took an empty water glass, rather than just refilling it as we had just paid the tab.  It was rather dumbfounding, and we were surprised Hillstone had not kept up their standards service-wise."}
{"text":"Hillstone is the Mecca for impeccable service and consistency in high-quality food. It's the type of restaurant that you visit and expect a flawless evening. The thing is, you expect it because it always happens. Food is never rushed to the table upon ordering different courses, service flows incredibly well, and if there is any sort of mishap they fix it without question.

The burger is fantastic, the french dip is the best in town, and the pork ribs are incredible. They also serve sushi and while the selection is limited, it is excellent as well. 

The restaurant design is brilliant. Low lighting around the tables with a singular light right overhead, making for an intimate dining experience without the distraction of the hustle and bustle that goes on during service. They even designed the \"well bar\" to be set up next to the sushi bar so that servers are not constantly coming up to the main bar to get drinks during lunch/dinner which helps efficiency. Small details, but they were thought out to perfection and it makes a big difference overall.

You know what you're going to get when you come to Hillstone. Consistency is the name of the game, and with so many other restaurants dropping the ball when it comes to food and/or service, it's why I keep coming back time after time."}
{"text":"Excellent grilled chicken salad with a delicious dressing and peanut sauce drizzle. Of course for a $15 salad it should be excellent. No bread given which would have been a nice touch to go with a salad.

I love the interior and the comfortable seating they offer on the indoor/outdoor patio looks inviting.  Our service was impeccable and the entire restaurant looked very clean and bright. My only other warning is it's very loud in here, perhaps the patio would be quieter."}
{"text":"Great food. Same owners as Bandara.

Spinach dip delicious and rich. Will make you full.

Veggie burger is delicious. What a pleasant surprise! Add some bacon and you'll be in heaven. 

Ribs are finger licking good.

Fries are super thin and fun to eat. Cole slaw is pretty good too.

If you get a tea, make sure you take out the tea bag after 2-3 min. They put too much tea in the pot, and by the time you drink your 3rd cup, it's bitter and over seeped."}
{"text":"This a Houston's with a different name. I'm not sure why they used the name Hillstone's and not Houston's when it's exactly the same, but I'm sure there was some corporate marketing decision-making involved. Our hotel concierge recommended Hillstone because we wanted steak but didn't want to pay Mastro's or Ruths Chris prices.

There is a nice patio and we wanted to sit there, but they don't serve the full menu there. Inside it looked exactly like every Houston's I've been to -- dark, kind of crowded, lots of booths. The menu is small and we ended up not having steak after all. Looking at the menu I remembered that I liked Houston's French dip, so I had that. Our party also had a burger and one of the noodle salads.

Everyone was happy enough with the food. Our server was not so great. He was so meek we could hardly hear him. We ordered the spinach dip appetizer, but after awhile I feared he hadn't heard placed the order so I asked. He hadn't put the order in, but once he did it came quickly and he comped it, so that worked out ok. We were also missing a drink when the drinks came. After a couple little blips like that it kind of ruins the meal because you're wondering what else is going to go wrong. But once the food came we were happy."}
{"text":"In town to see my mom and made a special plan to have dinner here with one of our family members who comes here often. 

We have always had stellar experiences at this restaurant from the service to the food. Sadly, our experience tonight was seriously uncomfortable and was going to go further downhill had it not been for the lovely management. 

Beware of the lack of descriptors on the menu. Lovely French Dip sandwich ($22) is slathered in mayo(not on the menu and who the heck puts mayo on a French Dip)? Key Lime pie with graham cracker crust is actually a graham cracker/pecan crust (pecan part NOT listed on menu)- and more.

Hours later and I'm still irked about the way our original waitress handled more than one request from the table (she never gave her name but that was the least of her transgressions) and sadly, even the going above and beyond to ensure we will come back, I can still only give our latest jaunt here 3 stars( it would have been 1).

Disclaimers/Suggestions:
(1) Mayo is my kryptonite. Bring me food with it on it or near it when I wasn't given the option to leave it off is seriously like Superman being thrown off his game.
(2) I've worked in the food service industry and currently have a daughter in college who works as a server. I know how have this business is and am keenly aware of how hard it is to keep places afloat. 
(3) I'm loyal to places and tip well- especially in states that don't pay servers the federally mandated minimum wage due to tipping. It hurts my soul when a server gives attitude when my mom asks for extra lemon for her iced tea or has to flag someone down for soy sauce for the sushi she ordered or if the very loud music can be turned down. For those who care, it can be and was but only after my conversation with management after our server told us it could not be with an astounding \"NO\".
(4) Make some new menus: If your FD has more on it than sliced prime rib on a roll and au jus- put it on the menu. Same thing goes with nuts in a crust. The \"read before you go\" is no way to ensure the waitstaff will ask if there are nut allergies at the table, and some of us have aversions and not actual allergies. Be awesome and just have a menu that says what is in/on your food. Wonder which is more cost effective- making new menus or having food sent back to the kitchen and then comping a meal even after a re-fire.

Again, this would have been a 1 star review (my experience and again, reviews are subjective), had I not been pro-active and asked to speak to a manager, explained the main issues and in turn management having the autonomy and going above and beyond. 

Maybe I'll see you again Hillstone- but not a second time this trip like we would have planned."}
{"text":"I'd been anxious to try this restaurant for quite some time. I was a big fan of Houston's, and when I realized they were all part of the same chain, after Houston's closed down, I looked forward to having a similar experience. 

My family and I went on a Sunday evening, and I must say I was disappointed. When we walked in, we were briefly greeted and then the staff member disappeared. The hostess seemed to still prepping for dinner service and looked over her shoulder while gathering supplies, but did not offer a \"I'll be right with you\" or even a welcoming look acknowledging our presence. 

When she did address us, it was a short wait time before she located someone to seat us. Once we were seated, we were given our menus and before we could touch them we were asked for our drink orders. No greeting, no \"have you been here before\"... We had to ask what was available to drink. We ordered soft drinks and lemonade. 

While we waited for our drinks we searched for a modified children's menus and there wasn't one. When our server returned we inquired and were advised that they grilled cheese and they could modify a chicken dish for children. They referred to it as a big chicken strip. It was not. In addition apparently soft drinks are served in single serving bottles, which was also not mentioned on the menu.

The menus was highly condensed version of Houston's menu with the prime rib and Hawaiian style rib eye one of the only two remaining items reminiscent of Houston's. The \"big chicken strip\" was a flop for my children. It was overly seasoned even for me as an adult. I ordered sides of broccoli to accompany our meals and the broccoli appeared to be steamed with Parmesan cheese sprinkled on it. The menus didn't describe the preparation and one of us at the table had a cheese allergy. In addition it had some add lemon-like tartness to it that rendered it inedible and even though they picked up two orders untouched while clearing the table no one asked how the food was or whether there was s problem.

I ordered the prime rib and it was delicious. My spouse's sea bass was standard. The sushi appetizer, also standard. The worst part in my opinion was the service. The person who seated us, was not our server. He was nice and good natured, but the actual server was iced cold to us, minimally involved, and didn't engage with us at all.

There was a family next to us that she engaged with a lot which lead me to wonder why we got the cold shoulder. She snatched the dishes off the table so fast that my children who's only edible option was french fries stopped eating and gave her their plates. 

I literally felt like my $150+ bill was a waste of time and money and my spouse and children advised that they never wanted to come there again.

(1) It's not kid friendly. Couples may Fair better, but you can have a far better experience at Mastro's or Steak 44 especially if you're looking for steak. (2) Unfriendly wait Staff. Although I tipped my standard 20%, it was the first time I ever consider not tipping because the service was lackluster. (3) Check the menu, if you aren't a fan of something they specialize in specifically, go somewhere where they have more options."}
{"text":"Well I don't know where to start , a while back my friends and went to hill stone for the first time . I myself am a restaurant for many years with hilton hotels . The moment we arrived the customer service we received was above a beyond , it was a busy evening and we got sat on the patio and was told it would be a while so we ordered drinks and an app. About 25 minutes or so went by and we were enjoying the evening and drinks so we were perfectly fine , one of the managers came by to apologize and said they were waiting for a party to leave and would have a table shortly we said no worries and contained talking and enjoying talking . 15 minutes or so went by and they came to apologize once again and said it would be soon , within minutes they came back and said just a few more minutes so we asked for the bill . Our waiter came by and said management tool care if the bill which was not necessary but a very nice gesture . We were taken to our table and and proceeded to look at the menu and order drinks and apps once again , shortly some apps we had not ordered we deliver to the table and we said they were not ordered by us , the runner said its from management .. Wow this was so not expected and very generous !! We ordered and had a great time and once again was taken by surprise when we were brought some dessert on the house as well , the customer service there is far above and beyond and mind you we never felt like we waited too long or had any issue at all there with the staff or the meal . Our meals that night we're outstanding and felt like we were treated like kings , it's now a place we tell everyone about and a place we all speak of fondly and will always patronize !! It's so nice to know there are people like at hill stone that are so concerned about there customers , we are moving back to Phoenix from San Diego at the end of the month and can't wait to go make Hill Stone a regular place to eat !!"}
{"text":"Last night we met friends at Hillstone's and we truly enjoyed a great meal and great atmosphere.  
We were met by a very friendly and helpful server who took great care of us the entire evening.  We started out with a wonderful wine recommended by our server, she let us taste 3 kinds before we chose what suited us.  We went on to enjoy the savory spinach and artichoke dip as well as fresh baked bread served with some olives and olive oil.  The caeser salad was a very large portion almost could have been my entree and the dressing was so fresh and light.  The croutons crisp and fresh baked.  We all ordered the hawaiian ribeye, OMG!! So moist and so juicy - the flavor was so fabulous and I could only eat half of it.  The loaded baked potato was also wonderful and very large.  I ended up taking half my meal home and was really happy that they let us sit quite awhile to chat with our friends after our meal was over (we were way too full for dessert however the server brought us a complimentary slice of key lime pie which my husband and friends said were fabulous I just was too full to try it) we never were rushed out and they kept refilling our drinks I can't wait to go back.  Was always a fan of Houston's in NYC and this was very much the same and enjoyed the jazzy low music in the background and the dim lighting that was warm and relaxing."}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant but too corporate.  They built an amazing patio but for some unknown reason you can't order off the full menu there.  

The bartenders are amazing and the food is excellent.  

Its a who's who of Phoenix"}
{"text":"We are regulars for over 20 years for a good reason; consistently five star customer experience every time!

This American Bistro offers salads, appetizers, sandwiches, burgers and both hearty and light entrees. All ingredients are high quality, offerings excellently prepared and served by a well trained, warm, friendly staff. 

Hillstone's, and its sister Restaurant Houston's, have created a unique market niche for a high quality, up-market, dining experience in a warm, friendly casual atmosphere. Live piano music in the bar nightly begins the unique experience. There is also a wonderful outdoor patio and outdoor fireplace to have a beverage before dinner. The only downside is there is usually a 20 minute or more wait unless you go mid afternoon.  

Tip: Arrive at least 20 minutes before you ideally would like to dine and place your name on the wait list. You can pass the time on the patio by the fireplace or listening to the piano music. If you are fitness conscious walk the neighborhood and look at the shops in Preston Center. Enjoy!!!!"}
{"text":"If you like French Dip, this is the place.  I love the new venue -- the dining area, the bar, and the open patio.  But, the only thing I come for here is the French Dip and fries.  It is the best I have had and I will always come back for more.  Thrilled it was not a casualty when Houston's closed."}
{"text":"I give the atmosphere a 10. Neat place. Very elegant! Tried the homemade fries with spicy mayo. Very salty and sauce tasted nothing different then mayo.  Steak was very salty as well. Cool place but not so much the food for the price."}
{"text":"My husband and I went there tonight to celebrate my birthday because it is my favorite restaurant and tonight It is the perfect balance of amazing food and great atmosphere.  They always run like a well oiled machine so tonight was a bit out of character.  Tonight we ordered our spinach dip ( which is the best I have ever eaten by the way) and our meal.  Well, tonight our meal came out before the dip which is not a mistake we have experienced there before.  I imagine this is a rare occurrence here.  We have come here for years and were very surprised.  We did not say anything but We had a feeling they would make it right and boy did they ever.  We figured they would comp the dip because that is the kind of professionalism they pride them self on but they went above and beyond tonight.   They actually comped our entire meal (drinks and all).  We were beyond impressed and just validates why we absolutely love this place.  Thank you Hillstone!!!  

If I could offer some suggestions ..... We both WISH you would bring back the BBQ beans, shoestring fries and the pork chop!!!  They were amazing and are so deeply missed!!!"}
{"text":"I know when  Iwalk through the doors at Houston's  I can count on great service and great food and those are the things I most appreciate about an eatery. These things make spending a decent chunk of money completely OK for me. I have always have above average food here whether it be the butterfleid fillet, the veggie platter, the burger, or the best veggie burger I have ever sunk my teeth into ( yes you veggie's out there, the best). I usually go with the fish special. They cook over cedar planks and other flavor enhancing woods that really add something that you might not taste at home, and that is what I love about this place; I can leave not thinking I could have made that for half the price and it would have been ten times better at home. The drinks are good but, yes, overpriced. The desserts are awesome the chocolate sauce over the brownie is homemade, and the apple thing is superb as well. I must say the most impressive thing to me about any Houston's, SF, LA, SEA, PHX, the service is some of the best I have had in this particular price range."}
{"text":"Outstanding food, service and atmosphere. Super posh layout and bar and restaurant open up to the natural beauty of Arizona beauty,so fresh clean air flows through. Spectacular atmosphere."}
{"text":"I tried Hillstone for the first time about 2 years ago, and I don't remember it being anything review-worthy.  I have dined 3 times in the past 2 months... I am a fan!  Making a reservation might be a smart choice, there was a 30 minute wait on a Tuesday evening.  (Good for them!)  Try the sushi!  You'll be pleasantly surprised!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants! The food and service is impeccable!! The manager Christina Goodman was absolutely incredible!! She goes above and beyond to make sure guests feel welcome and well taken care of. No matter the issue. Every time I dine here, I cannot wait to come back!! Couldn't have asked for better experiences every time I visit. The fried oysters are Delish!!!"}
{"text":"Oh my... Not what I expected... It's Season 52 with attitude. Not much taste in the Grouper sandwich, but buried in over-mayo-ish cole slaw. Nothing new or original on the menu. The waitress looked irked and corrected my friend when she asked for ice - \"oh, you'd like ice water, not just water\" - we live in AZ and need to ask for ice? I could not find the entrance, and once I did I stood there for several minutes while someone (a server?) was too busy folding napkins to acknowledge us. Not impressed."}
{"text":"My daughter introduced me to this fabulous place....the food is so fresh...hot...and delicious...The menu is not overwhelming and the chicken sandwich is sooo delicious."}
{"text":"This restaurant just bleeds class.  My husband and I went with another couple and we were all satisfied with our meals.  I had the ahi tuna salad (flying tuna I think it was called?) and it was delicious.  My husband and friend had the swordfish special and that was cooked perfectly and the veggie mix was amazing.  My friend's husband had their ribs and they were so tender and literally fall off the bone.  I would definitely go back and recommend it.  The bar is a great 'hang out' also.  2 thumbs up!"}
{"text":"We started with the roasted Brussels sprouts appetizer,  they were excellent and would go back just for that. The entree was the seared ahi tuna with a Mango, Avacado, lettuce salad. Perfect!"}
{"text":"This is a great place for a dinner date. OMG the steaks are so good. The cocktail drinks are great. Employees are very nice. Love it!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite fine dining in town.  I only go here 2 or 3 times a year because it's a little pricey for dinner, but wow, what great food!  Dessert is awesome here too, love the Sundae.  I just went here for my birthday last week and it still lives up to expectations although they don't carry my favorite anymore (double cut grilled pork chop).  They might start carrying it after they move to their new location though, here's hoping!  If you're looking for a classy place with great dinner dishes then this place is highly recommended, just please dress accordingly and don't try wearing a hat, not allowed!"}
{"text":"These guys and Houston's are awesome.  The outside patio makes the food taste even better.   Love it!"}
{"text":"The New York Strip special they have is top two in Phoenix- just have to get lucky when they have it!"}
{"text":"I definitely felt like I was in Houston's, but if I had to pick, I enjoyed the ribs more here. I think because they were not as sweet as Houston's, or maybe I was just hungrier. The service was great and very friendly. As others have said, it's also a great atmosphere with a big patio."}
{"text":"I initially wanted to order something light as I was going to dance my butt off at this Marc Anthony concert. So, I went for the veggie burger which was surprisingly larger than I expected, but equally delicious. The veggie party was rather well structured (a perfect circumference lol) and to complement it, there was the tomatoe, a bit of coleslaw. Not regrets about my decision and I'm looking forward to coming back, basically because the service was amazing!!"}
{"text":"I had been a fan of Houston's (which closed) and was told that Hillstone was the replacement/new Houston's. I decided to give it a try (I was hungry/thirsty driving across town on my way home from being out all day).  I checked in with the hostess and inquired about patio seating (they have a really nice patio).  The hostess informed that the patio seating was limited to sushi menu only.  I asked about bar seating and she said that the bar seating is full menu service.

I sat down at the bar and was sitting there about 10 minutes before I could get a bartender's attention.  A female batender walked to the end of the bar where I was sitting and I asked her for an iced tea and menu.  She brought my iced tea and menu about 5 minutes later.  I waited another 10 minutes before I could get her attention (she was at the other end of the bar chatting it up with some patrons) to tell her I was ready to place my dinner order (at this time, I needed a refill on my iced tea).  The female bartender disappeared right after I told her I would have the prime rib medium rare; I did not even get a chance to also request a refill on my iced tea because she left.  About 10 minutes later, a helper from the kitchen comes out with my prime rib and sits it down on the bar in front of me.  I asked him if I could get a refill on my iced tea and he said that he would tell the bartender and disappeared.  The female bartender was still on the other end of the bar chatting it up with the same patrons/not even looking in my direction so I asked a male bartender, Daniel, that was chatting it up with a group of guys if I could get a refill on my iced tea.  About 5 minutes later he brings the iced tea. The vegetables that came with the prime rib were not what I expected (had some vinegar stuff poured on them and I cannot eat vinegar; menu did not say that vegetables would be drenched in a vinegarette dressing); I was hoping to get a side salad swapped out since I could not eat the vegetables.  About a third of my steak had been consumed and I stopped and was waiting to get Daniel's attention (he was still chatting it up with the group of guys) and a helper from the kitchen came up and was trying to take my plate (thought I was finished).  I told the helper that I would need a box (wanted to at least take the rest of the prime rib home).  Daniel appeared with a plastic take home container for me to put my prime rib in along with the bill.  I asked if I could get an iced tea to go and Daniel informed me that they do not do \"to go\" beverages.

I tipped 15% (I usually tip 20-25%) put was even hesitant to tip the 15%.  No one ever checked with me to see if everything was ok (food, needed a refill on my beverage).  Original bartender walked away and left me to fend on my own to find another bartender to wait on me. Other bartender completely ignored me/would not even look in my direction.  

Prime rib was good but not worth the $43 tab for a piece of prime rib, 2 iced teas and lack of service.  This place is trendy; if you are not a friend of the bartender, not a regular customer that the staff is familar with (and not ordering unlimited alcoholic drinks), do not expect to get any service or attention.  I will not be back and do not recommend."}
{"text":"Great food, amazing service. Reservations are a must if you're looking for around dinner. One unsung menu item is Hillstone's sushi! Best in the valley IMHO. Keep in mind that this place isn't cheap. First timers try the patio - limited menu but faster seating and a great fire place."}
{"text":"My absolutely FAVORITE place EVER!! Seriously I've been going to Houston's concept restaurants since I was a teenager and this along with all the others never disappoints. The Hawaiian Ribeye is melt in your mouth delicious and I dream about it... seriously! Service is always amazing (especially Tom at the bar) and I am full and happy every single time I leave! If it was just a tad bit less expensive I would be there weekly but unfortunately it is a once every couple months type of place for me. That's ok though it gives me time to miss it!"}
{"text":"Welcome to Houston's with a happy Hillstone hat on! One thing that always bothered me about the former Houston's was how dark and dreary it could be, but that is definitely not the case with Hillstone. I absolutely love the architecture, location and openness of this building. It's fresh and airy with plenty of large windows, an open patio, and rock finishing. The restaurant seating isn't cramped and you've got plenty of room to relax and enjoy the meal with those you came with and not 20 other strangers. 

Before I got to Hillstone, I read up on the yelp reviews and noticed Kat S's note about the ice cubes. So, when I sat down and ordered my Diet Coke, the first thing I glanced at were the ice cubes and Kat's right! They are old fashioned and pretty great! They are the type of ice cubes they place in whiskey to make sure they don't crush when they are dropped in, but I also think they make the soda pour without fizzing up. 

So now I will move on to the meal. The reviews are right in saying that this is exactly like the Houston's menu but with a nice improvement. I ordered the rotisserie chicken sandwich with the couscous. Warning: the sandwich is huge and way too big for one lunch, but that could be a good thing if you want to have the other half for lunch. We didn't have dessert but I glanced at the menu and while they have several of the Houston's signatures, I think they should add apple crisp to the list. 

I will definitely be back to Hillstone and think this is a nice addition to the area."}
{"text":"Amazing, friendly service in a warm atmosphere every time. We normally don't go places this \"nice\" because they always seem underrated, but hill stone is worth every penny. Even sitting at the bar is comfortable with impeccable service. Don't skip the hot fudge sundae at the end...best in the world!!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing! 
From start to finish, I have nothing but amazing things to say. The service was incredible. I had the spinach and artichoke dip... don't skip this!! And then the Ribs. Never have I had such amazing food. I just moved nearby and the staff was so friendly I was so happy with this experience, and having grown up in restaurants, I am VERY picky with food and service. This much exceeded my expectations"}
{"text":"Food is great. Especially the smoked salmon appetizer and Thai steak salad. 

Unfortunately, tonight (Saturday) I tried to order take out but was told the kitchen was too backed up so call back in an hour. 

Looks like I'm eating something else tonight."}
{"text":"I cannot say enough good things about Hillstone. I have been going here about 20 years now (when it was formerly Houston's) and I have never had bad service or food. I work very close to this location and was craving their spinach artichoke dip so decided to head over at lunch. I've been a few times and even the bar was packed and their was a wait for 1 person. I got lucky today as there was open seating at the bar! I had the side salad and the dip and it was awesome! I was in and out in less than an hour but never feel rushed.

I will be back in the near future to get my Hillstone fix!"}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant. Food was delicious. I ordered the Thai Steak and Noodle Salad. I don't normally order food that includes the words: Thai, noodle and salad all in one  but I am so glad I did. The flavors were on point and the steak was amazing. Service was up to par (attentive and friendly) with the food and what you would expect at that price point. Patio is great. It's a little dark but otherwise perfect."}
{"text":"The Thai steak salad is overdressed, overpriced,  overhyped and underwhelming.  The french dip looked delicious.  I know better for next time."}
{"text":"I'll spare you the lament over Houston's...you've heard it all.

Hillstone was my immediate pick when I found out some clients were coming to town from the Midwest. I wanted to take them somewhere nice that gave a good representation of the area and offered a menu they would like. I LOVE that Hillstone has fresh & innovative sushi without letting that bleed into \"Asian-fusion\" territory for the rest of the menu. I figured these clients would be \"meat and potato\" folks, and that's precisely what was offered.

We started with Happy Hour on the patio and we were all thrilled with the koi pond, comfy seating and gorgeous overall patio ambiance. However, our group of 7 had a really tough time because the patio is definitely set up for groups of 2-4. Still, we made it work for a couple of rounds of cocktails. When we moved inside for dinner, they offered to seat us at two separate tables, since no tables accommodate more than 6 or something...not good for business conversation. We ended up in a corner booth that suited us fine. It was a little cramped  but after our happy hour drinks no one seemed to mind.

The service was so great, (except the cocktail runner who spilled my wine upon delivery and failed to bring back a napkin or anything...?) and the servers we interacted with were knowledgeable and skilled in the fine dining etiquettes of business entertaining. I was pleased with the overall experience. 

The sushi was okay, and typically priced for that kind of place. The rolls were unique, but nothing to praise. The reason I have for 3 stars is value and food quality, and poor seating options for parties over 6. The $35 filet is enormous (12oz?!) but truly left something to be desired. It was not flavorful, and ill prepared. It did not taste or feel like a quality grade and I found myself wishing I had gotten the french dip or just more sushi instead. The potatoes that come on the side really tasted like they came from a powder pouch--nothing creamy or \"real\" tasting about them. The rainbow chard was good, though. I really really wanted to say the food was amazing but that steak, and those potatoes, were really subpar. I would have rather had 6oz of delicious filet than twice the meat that I didn't enjoy. 

I'll be back for the patio ambiance but I won't be itching to spend the money for dinner."}
{"text":"I feel that the wait staff was mediocre as we only saw our server a few times which is fine because I don't like to bombarded constantly during a meal but I was never offered a refill on my tea and even the water refill was sparse. Our entree was delivered by someone other than our server and she looked like she was not happy to be there. The only person who appeared to be happy was the hostess who managed to squeeze us in since I had made a mistake with our online reservation. 

While the food we ordered was good, I guess I had higher expectations for this restaurant since we were celebrating our wedding anniversary and was hoping it to be special. The next time we have a special occasion, we will plan ahead of time to go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Great ambience, lively crowd and good food. We were in Phoenix in a long layover for a connecting flight and decided to check out the biltmore mall. The restaurant is right next to the mall, the area seemed still getting built and lot of places in the opposite AMC complex were yet to be opened, hillstone is probably the best choice in the neighborhood to eat at. The dishes are a bit pricey. But the food served is worth the price. I had the trout dish and my husband got the pork ribs. Both dishes were equally good. Would recommend if you don't mind spending a few extra bucks for good food and service."}
{"text":"Always perfect. Customer service and food is excellent. Never had a complaint and love to come here."}
{"text":"I've been to Hillstone several times and I always enjoy each time 
Some of their dishes are absolutely wonderful... 
I somehow always manage to get their sushi and it is always good
Not the best but definitely good
The service is always really great
It is a pretty dim restaurant and can be chilly sometimes...
On my last visit I wanted to have a drink with my dinner so since I was having sushi, a rainbow roll, so I was thinking a sake bomb.
Might seem a little odd for the place but I was just feeling it...
Come to find out, they do not carry sake
But they do have Kirin...
Our server was nice enough to go and check to see if the bar had any sake...
Turns out, they had one last small bottle of sake...
I was happy and I would have been happy even if they didn't have the sake but...
For the server to go out of his way to check... It made me happy
Great service...
I had my sushi and it was good
My sake bomb was wonderful...
It was a cool experience...
A bunch of the servers would walk by and notice my sake bomber and make comments like 
\"Sushi and sake go together, idk why we don't carry it all the time\"
And
\"\"People ask for sakebombers but we usually don't carry it\"

Maybe something that will get to the owners/managers...

Overall Hillstone is great and the service is always wonderful..."}
{"text":"However they prepared the grilled artichoke appetizer was amazing! The sushi was so fresh and we had the Dover Sole dinner. Everything was fantastic. Ordered skinny spicy margaritas to drink and they were excellent, too. Hit this place up. A little pricey, but worth it."}
{"text":"LOVE this place! The food is phenomenal the service is five star and the dining experience amazing.  This is a great treat for me and a place I come to a special occasions."}
{"text":"I have been going to this restaurant (and this location) for quite some time now. The food has always been great, as well as the service.

Always great specials available, and great drinks, too! Great for lunch or dinner. I highly recommend Houston's."}
{"text":"Don't know if there is any truth to the contention that the only reason Houston's rebranded itself as Hillstone was to avoid having enough restaurants to be required to disclose its calorie content....I don't care though.  It's still Houston's with the puzzling addition of sushi.  I'm not sure they get many orders for sushi and would as soon see that middle space be used as a dessert bar or extra bar.  
They still have the great veggie burger (although with the recent additon of beets it seems sweeter) and the fried chicken salad.  Again, I don't actually want to know the calorie contents so I'm good with the non-disclosure.  The new location is huge.  There is a piano in the corner and a large patio.  It is much lighter and brighter than the old location due to lots of windows.  I especially love the double doors which are huge and remind me of a bank.  Plus they have a little koi pond even :)"}
{"text":"First time here celebrating graduation from GCU with family. The place was busy- so waited 45 minutes to be seated. Our server was amazing - not the overall service, but our server did a great job of patching over a forgotten appetizer and other very small inconveniences. 

The food was great. Son #1 had hamburger- happy. Son #2 had ribs- #awesome. I had the ahi tuna and it was the best I ever had and wife had the chicken. The deserts were delicious and the wine was perfect - thanks for recommendation. 

Noisy place, but it wasn't so noisy for conversation. Locals obviously love it here. Talked to a woman who has been going for 15 years - got all our food recommendations from her. We'll be back next time in AZ."}
{"text":"This place is a top favorite of mine. So many items on the menu I crave. Completely delicious! My Favorite item may be the Thai stake salad bursting with many flavors, it's OFF the charts! Love the sushi, salmon, Reg burger, veggie burger, great salads. And the best item among all the fantastic desserts is the ice cream with the liquid fudge, so rich, so amazing will cause you to NEVER forget the meal! Very classy place, plays great music!"}
{"text":"I used to love this restaurant. However, despite the consistency of food quality, the menu is short, old and stale. They used to have great specials but not longer. They also, used to have seasonal vegetables and they were so good. But, no more. Char was seasonal and very good, but now gone. Too bad, this place is now lost its standing."}
{"text":"This is our go to place when we want to take friends from out of town to a nice dinner. We have lunch or appetizers after golf. Regularly. When artichokes are in season you'll see us a couple times a month. The beef dip is a must share! Always consistent and friendly."}
{"text":"the chicken salad with the peanut sauce is delicious! its perfect every time. service is stupendous. atmosphere is great for dates or lunch. 

menu can be a little boring, but whatever you choose you will probably like. 

my family cannot get enough of the artichoke appetizer.

wine choices are good, too. 

although ive noticed they dont put ice in their waters automatically. who wants a cup of water with no ice?

also, i just had surgery and went in a wheelchair. they were so accommodating!"}
{"text":"I have to say I have been here a few times but today was extra special. We were the 1st ones at the restaurant and Karen with her amazing personality sat us. Our waitress Christina came over and remembered us from a couple of months ago and told us where we sat last time WOW. We had the spinach dip YUMMMMMM and I had the chicken salad (like a chinese chicken salad) YUMMMMM and my friend had the caesar salad. I love the ambiance. Great for business, happy hour, date night. You can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"Maybe I'm biased because this is the restaurant my boyfriend took me on our first date but I really think Hillstone is something special. I've been here several times and am never disappointed. The location in the heart of the Biltmore area can't be beat and the atmosphere is upscale and classy without being stuffy, making Hillstone a great date night spot. You simply cannot go wrong with the Tuna Mango, Shrimp & Macadamia, or Thai Tuna rolls. If you're me you go ahead and order all three! As for the House Specialties, the pan roasted salmon and USDA prime filet (ordered rare of course!) are phenomenal. For cocktails I like The Crush {Belvedere Vodka | fresh grapes | basil} and a simple (but ever potent) Kettle One martini. Another great thing about Hillstone is the service is always top notch. You can bring friends from out of town or colleagues here and you'll never have to worry about the experience being soured by poor service."}
{"text":"Thank you Hillstone, for taking great care of me when my order was running later than normal. Your customer service is the best of the best. Also, the traditional house salad is amazing!

For those going for lunch or dinner - the food is fantastic so expect to wait unless you get there early; but - it's worth it."}
{"text":"Great food and great service. 

I came here for lunch the other day and really enjoyed their food. My reservation was at 12:30pm, arrived around 5 mins before thinking they will have valet parking available but I was wrong. Took me a good 5 mins to find a spot then a couple of mins to walk, needless to say I was late, last one in my group to show up... I was wearing new heels, walking any distance wasn't what I wanted to do.

When I walked in, they were busy, people were waiting for tables, I highly recommend making reservations.

Our table started with smoke salmon appetizer. Their smoke salmon tasted like what I had at a fish market in Seattle from the first time I was there over 10 years ago. Yes it was that good.

I had ahi tuna salad for my lunch. It was so nicely presented, really loved all the color used, it looked very tasty and it sure was.  Just right portion size for lunch. I got to taste ahi tuna burger, it was cooked and flavored so well, I would be happy to have either ahi tuna salad or tuna burger.

Since I ate well for lunch, I decided to be bad and order dessert. We shared strawberry short cake and browny. Strawberry short cake was just okay but really liked the browny.  Carmel sauce mixed together with ice cream nicely complimented browny.

Service was excellent. They had more than one person assigned to our table, so it seemed, kept coming back to refill drinks. One of a person from our table had Diet Coke. It was served in a bottle. I hardly ever drink soda but it looked refreshing to see soda in a bottle."}
{"text":"Yummmm!!   Took a client there for lunch.  Both of us had salads, me the grilled chicken salad and he the kale salad with chicken.    Came out in a jippy.   Must be ready to go with a toss of the dressing.   The seasoning for the salad was perfect on both counts.    He said his was really good and mine was GREAT!     Just the right amount of crunch and veggies and dressing and chicken.   Added all together, and it can't be beat.   Love their food.    I would definitely return.   One thing I would suggest, since it is so noisy with customers, I think they can turn off the music when it is busy.   It adds to the din and makes it a bit hard to hear conversations."}
{"text":"The phone operator made every effort/excuse to avoid making a reservation for my party. 
This place was highly recommended but unfortunately the phone operator made it clear that the service at Hillstone sucks!"}
{"text":"Had great steak dinner there last week. A bit pricey but it was worth it for a special occasion.  Service was excellent as well.  The patio was very nice but we sat inside it is a beautiful restaurant and it was not noisy as a lot of restaurants seem to be these days."}
{"text":"Amazing cheeseburgers!

The staff is always prompt, the food delicious and the atmosphere is perfect for a date.  My family and I have gone to this restaurant for years and never had a bad meal.  If something was ever wrong with the food they (appeared) happy to fix it.  

The only negative is they only have one or two tables that seat more the four comfortably."}
{"text":"5 Stars for AMBIANCE, AMBIANCE, AMBIANCE. The exposed sandstone brick decor, with rich wood accents, low light and great background make this a sexy, sophisticated yet reasonably priced upscale place for a date or for an intimate gathering with a few friends. The service is also top notch and they have a nice selection of wine.

I have to deduct two stars for the lack-luster prime rib which was so disappointing after a delicious starter salad. I had to give props for the creamy horseradish which singed my nasal passages and brought a few tears to my eye. The cut of meat was generous in size and cooked a perfect medium rare as I had asked but it was on the tough and dry side and completely lacking in flavor. I very seldom send back meals and since there was nothing wrong with the preparation, I chose to just endure it. 

So sadly my first experience here was a bit of a wash after the less than stellar meal. That being said that atmosphere here is just so amazing I will have no choice but to return, if nothing else for cocktails. But I'm sure there's something on the menu that I'm bound to enjoy. I will just steer clear of the prime rib."}
{"text":"this is probably the only steak restaurant that i would go to for a salad. a fish salad. the seared ahi tuna salad is TO DIE FOR! it's simply the best seared ahi tuna i've ever had - and i'm comparing it to meals i had in hawaii! (did i mention i'm pretty finicky about my seafood?)

and of course, their steaks are incredible. the prime rib is awesome. the hawaiian rib eye is fantastic. and the french dip sandwich! it's sliced PRIME RIB. how can you go wrong with that?!?!? best french dip ever. best salad ever. soooooooooo gooooooooooooooood!"}
{"text":"Over the years I've been here several times.  The quality of the food and service are always dependably good. The decor of the restaurant, bar area, and patio is classy and comforting.

One of my favorites is the french dip sandwich and fries.  The seasonings on the meat are great and the au jus and a side of creamy horseradish equate to near perfection.

I did have a little glitch on a recent visit.  We were charged $68 for a bottle of wine that was listed as $60 on the menu.  When we mentioned this to the server the error was quickly corrected. Nevertheless, make sure you check your bill!"}
{"text":"Saturday date night....we had reservations for 7:15pm but arrived early.  We were seated right away in a cozy corner booth.  Loved the wine list and I ordered a nice glass of pinot noir, he ordered a vodka press.  Everything on the menu looked simply amazing.  I chose the Thai steak and noodle salad, all I can say is delicious. His chicken sandwich wad perfectly made.  The service and atmosphere were outstanding.  We will be back"}
{"text":"LOVE the veggie burger!!!  and I'm not a vegetarian.  It has a sweet soy glaze and does fall apart when you eat it so if that bothers you - don't order it.   I order veggie burgers to save on calories and for the \"health\" of it many times - but at Houston's it is a treat!  Yummy!  and the fries are awesome too!  Not sure what all the talk is regarding it being \"pricey\" - it's not fast food but it's certainly not expensive.  Moderately priced for sure."}
{"text":"I took my girlfriend here because she had liked it from before. She has an acquired tasted for fine (cough, expensive) dining. 

We came here and the parking lot was small so we had to parked some distance away in the Biltmore parking lot and had to walk a bit to get here.

We had gotten a nice table by the bar but this place was packed and somewhat loud. They do not have a smoking patio. 

The food was delicious. I had the filet mignon and she had the seared ahi tuna. She also had quite a bit of sashimi. She really likes sashimi. The service was pretty good and we went home with a little left overs since my girlfriend doesn't really eat that much in one sitting. I figured, be prepared to pay a few hundred and I was correct. 

Overall, this place is pretty good."}
{"text":"This place makes me happy! Brenden gave outstanding service. When I asked for a to-go box; he insisted on giving a fresh bag of fries to-go versus simply boxing those left on my plate. That was a first and was very appreciated!"}
{"text":"Recently had lunch here. It is ultra sleek inside, very open with a spectacular patio with a fireplace. Large bar also. Service was attentive and friendly. Had the Spinach Artichoke Dip which I loved, came with tortilla chips, sour cream and salsa The Cheeseburger was delicious and cooked perfectly. Delicious fries. I will be back. Great lunch place!"}
{"text":"Wow, some of the review here are really harsh. I had an excellent experience at Hillstone and cannot wait to go back.

We arrived to a full dining room and went to the bar to have drinks. Within five minutes, the host found us and offered us a table. We had to decline, as we were waiting for the rest of our party to arrive. The bartender was awesome and the regulars she knew seemed to really have a connection with her. When hubby finished his drink and declined another she brought a glass of water over for him so he'd have something. Awesome. The bar vibe is great.

Our table was a cozy L shape booth with awesome lighting. Our server was awesome and knew the menu well enough to answer our questions. She was always around when we wanted her but never too talky. 

The food was great. We started with the pressed sushi--heaven! I cant wait to have it again. The pressing takes the place of the nori to hold the roll together. Never had it before, cant wait to have it again. The caesar salad was good, croutons were a little too crunchy, but they were underneath everything instead of on top---brilliant. The green salad was a little heavily dressed but very good.

Entrees? The NY steak was sex on a plate. The fries were what you'd expect but that steak was perfectly seared and topped with delicious olive and shallot deliciousness. The fish special was amazing too. Cooked to perfection, moist, tasty, and the fillets were still attached to each other and the tail, which let us know they came from 1 fish and recently.

Dessert was the ice cream sundae which was surprisingly well executed except for the fudge--which should have been hotter. The coffee was good too, nice finish. 

The only criticism was the server picked up the finished check, a huge faux pas in my book. Leave it on the table, dont rush your guests.

Hillstone is high on my list to return to and bring my out of town guests to. Bravo."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant, even back when I lived in Houston and the restaurant was called Houston's. The food is always fresh and the drinks are very strong. I enjoy the lemon drop but I can only handle one. I order the smoked Salmon and it comes with toast points and some delicious spread. I don't go often nonetheless everytime I go the food is consistent."}
{"text":"Excellent meal and atmosphere. Ribs were phenomenal. Little house salad ,not so little, was outstanding. Goat cheese,roasted beets and walnuts delicious with greens and flavorful tomatoes."}
{"text":"Very good food and excellent service.  Get's crowded later in the evening, so call ahead or come early."}
{"text":"Great food and great atmosphere. Highly recommend. One of the best veggie burgers i've ever had at a restaurant. Fresh ingredients -- not your typical bland frozen veggie burger patty you get everywhere else. Quantities are huge, but it was so good i ate the whole thing."}
{"text":"Why is this place so damn delicious?! They really NEVER disappoint. My favorite is the pressed sushi. The artichoke, spinach artichoke dip and veggie burger are also musts. It's a bummer that the Houstons in scottsdale isn't as good, they used to be but are now missing the je ne sais quoi, so I would definitely make the drive to Phoenix if you are in Scottsdale and are ready for a wonderful meal."}
{"text":"Meh. Totally overrated. Two drinks, and two sandwiches for lunch. $60 plus dollars. For lunch...

Me, a collins cocktail. Good but no punch...
My date, a glass of chardonnay. 

Me, the veggie burger with kale salad. The kale salad was tasty. The burger not so much. It was ok but very messy and nothing special.
My date, the fish sandwich. Again messy but also undercooked and nothing special..

NOT impressed. May go back for a happy hour or something but was less than impressed."}
{"text":"WOWZA. I'm really good about getting half my meal to go, I love leftovers, but once I took my first bite of the veggie burger, i thought \"ohhhh hel..... no. this entire things is going in my belly.\"

DONE."}
{"text":"Get dressed up and come on down to Hillstone at the Biltmore! Visited for the first time last month, and I have to say, this is a chain I will pay more attention to! Without a doubt, one of the best restaurants in Phoenix. This place has the best rotisserie chicken I've EVER tasted. The texture was absolutely perfect. Juicy...tasty...you get the picture. The pan-roasted salmon was also to die for -- wine selection is just great, and the reds we got were amazing. I've heard this location is known for their sushi, as they had quite a unique selection on the menu. I will definitely have to try it the next time I'm back! The perfect place for a date. The atmosphere, coupled with the higher-touches of the restaurant were so appealing and enchanting."}
{"text":"Client lunch again. 

More snooty staff, again. Not sure I understand this. 

Tried sushi here for the first time, and it was some of the best I have had in AZ. 

Not a huge fan of the bottle coke."}
{"text":"Bye bye Phoenix Houston's, hello Phoenix Hillstone!

I've been a huge fan of Houston's for years, and had mixed emotions when I heard that they were closing the Phoenix location and opening just down the street under their parent company name, Hillstone.  But after one visit, I'm sold... 

Hillstone has the same favorite dishes that Houston's had (spinach dip, grilled artichoke, veggie burger, fresh vegetable sides, fries, desserts, etc...) and they have a huge wine list as well.  Service is attentive and sweet (thanks McKenna who was our waitress last night).  Thanks also for going above and beyond and creating rootbeer floats for our table upon request!

The Hillstone group did a fabulous job building this new restaurant - it's got a great outdoor seating area, a huge bar, an awesome wine cellar, and comfy booths inside as well.

If you still want the old name (Houston's), the location in Scottsdale / Hilton Village is still open, but I highly recommend checking out Hillstone to change it up just a bit.

Welcome to Phoenix, Hillstone, and yay for me... first to review!"}
{"text":"Sea Bass for lunch was awesome!  I asked to have it paired with spinach and it combined brilliantly.  The service was great by not just our waitress but passing waitstaff.  Hillstone is a nice upscale Houston's type of eatery.  The weather was nice enough to be out side.  We ate there for lunch.  The menu was diverse enough for a burger to caesar salad to my sea bass.  I like this restaurant and the atmosphere.  It would be good for a business lunch or happy hour date or just dinner with friends.  Great place!"}
{"text":"I went here with several friends after a Happy Hour across the street in The Biltmore. I ordered one of their daily specials, a grilled fish sandwich with a side of curried corn and white beans. The meal was tasty, but then one of the other Happy Hour participants started raving about their chocolate sundae. So I split one with my friend across the table. He didn't lie. That sundae was PHENOMENAL! And OH so very decadent and (most likely) bad for you. It comes with a carafe of extra hot fudge (PURE EVIL!)...absolutely delectable!"}
{"text":"Every time I come to this place I leave impressed!!!! the food is amazing anything you order from menu hands down!! My favorite is the yellowtail sashimi and my friend Vito loved the California burger with avocados in them!! highly recommend this place to everyone!!! And when they are in the season the GRILLED ARTICHOKES are # 1."}
{"text":"I came in with my family on a Saturday afternoon. We had a large party of 8, with 3 little boys. Unfortunately, the restaurant could not accommodate a large party and therefore separated us into two tables of 4. This was quite disappointing. The food was pretty tasty, but average. My favorite was the hot fudge sundae :) Overall, I would not recommend this restaurant for anyone with kids or larger parties."}
{"text":"They recently switched to CAB for the filet and it is utterly amazing. Consistently tender and flavorful. A great value compared with major steakhouses, too."}
{"text":"Hillstone is one of my favorite restaurants ever!!!!
The atmosphere is upscale, yet very relaxed, and inviting-
The staff goes above and beyond to make you feel like you are their only table, they are very attentive, without ever being annoying-
The food and drinks are amazing to say the least!!!!!!!! I have a hard time even choosing what to order each time!!! The salmon appetizer is the BOMB, the spinach artichoke dip is absolutely incredible, the Prime rib sandwich and the kale salad are mouthwatering and the Hawaiian ribeye is indescribable!!!! You MUST save room for dessert because the Hot fudge sundae is no ordinary sundae! They make their own chocolate sauce and you practically want to drink it! It is deeeeelish!!!!! They top it off with whipped cream and crunchy sugary pecans......, omg!!!!!  Hillstone is the best!
P.S. If you only want drinks and appetizers, sit on the patio, the feel of the patio is wonderful, they have built in ac fans under the tables that actually blow in to your lap to keep you cool-
There is a large 2 way fireplace which really adds to the atmosphere! The hand rolled sushi and margaritas are the best!!!!"}
{"text":"Best ribs you'll ever have in your life. We started a tradition of takeout on Friday and couldn't be happier. The usual suspects: Ribs and fries and the ice cream sundae. Also highly recommend the grilled artichokes and spinach dip.. We tend to stick with takeout these days - guess I'm looking for more of a relaxed atmosphere, less formal and more energetic when dining out. I'm not thrilled with the wine list but who needs it after all that food. And it is consistently amazing food."}
{"text":"Hillstone is one of the new step-children of Houston's (not sure why they're changing the name in every city) but you know you're going to have excellent service when you're here!

I came with girlfriends for a casual lunch to catch up and we definitely enjoyed ourselves.  We have a bottle of wine and the spinach dip o start.  The wine was amazing (but for some reason not at the right temperature, wasn't cold enough) and the spinach dip was pretty good.  

I also had the soup and salad (clam chowder and house salad) which were both fantastic.  My only complaint is that I wanted more of that soup!  With Phoenix being so far from water, good seafood isn't easy to find and this clam chowder tasted like it was fresh and full. 

We were too stuffed for dessert but the options definitely looked yummy!

Oh, one last MAJOR gripe - PARKING!  In Phoenix parking is rarely a concerned.  Well at Hillstone at noon on Friday, I had to circle around the parking lot for 15 minutes before I found a spot."}
{"text":"Came here for HH with some friends.  Love the vibe and feel to the place.  Our server was excellent!!!  One of the best servers I have had in a LONG time.

Chicago-Style Spinach Dip with salsa, sour cream and warm tortilla chips:  the dip is so creamy and flavorful.  Too good to NOT order.

Special App for the day-Brushetta:  I am not sure what kind of cheese or oils was used, but it was too good to stop at one!

Famous French Dip:  Melts in your mouth and the au jus sauce was perfect not too salty."}
{"text":"Good food, great ambiance, call it Hillstone's or Houston's it's all the same. I have always enjoyed this establishment. The only thing I don't get about it is that they try so hard to convince you that it's not a chain restaurant. Hate to tell you that's what you are. Not that that's a bad thing just get over trying to be something else other than what you are. I will have to say out of all the upper crust chain restaurants you are defiantly ahead of the game. You are far superior than any of the Fox concept establishments."}
{"text":"Arrived at 7:00 pm on a Saturday evening Enjoyed cocktails at the Bar while experiencing great service from Michelle (great bartender). After 50 mins our table was ready. Absolutely fantastic fresh burger with the best tomatoes you will ever have. This is the 3rd time eaten here in the past 2 years, as we no longer live in AZ. Each time the food had been over the top delicious.  The family had ribs/Coleslaw/spaghetti squash as well as Sushi. We can hardly wait to come back. I highly recommend this restaurant as well as any of their other concepts - Bandaras, Houston's."}
{"text":"Grilled artichoke was delicious. Sushi was okay. Didn't serve sake.

HOWEVER, after using my credit card here, my card was \"duplicated\" and used for a series of charges. If you dine at this restaurant, keep your wallet close and bring exact change in cash. Unless you want to spend a long time sorting our fraud charges. (Note that in the last 2 months, I only used my credit card once, which was at this restaurant.)"}
{"text":"Excellent place to dine. I met a customer for lunch here and the people are very friendly and attentive. I had the Salmon for lunch with the Kale salad. EXCELLANT on both. I cannot wait to go back when I'm in town."}
{"text":"I love the vibe of the bar here. I come here every 2-3 weeks for lunch. I always get a sauvignon blanc from New Zealand to pair with my meal. I love the people who dine here, as well as the staff. They are friendly and remember regulars! 

Heather, the brunette bartender is on top of things. She remembers my boyfriend's drink and mine after three times of coming in during their busy lunch hour. Courtney, the petite blonde bartender is also a sweetheart and very obliging.

I have recent been enjoying the red Sans Liege Grenache blend wine. I get the bottle and can always take it home if I don't finish it!!! 

Here is a tip, get the rotisserie chicken and sub the fries for the Cesar salad. You will get way more chicken and it's only a $2 up charge for practically the same thing as the chicken Cesar salad."}
{"text":"DON'T EXPECT HOUSTON'S!

We heard Houston's became Hillstone so as very loyal customers to Houston's (going 2+ times per month) for years, we were excited to try Hillstone on Camelback. What a disappointment! 

The service was just awful, very cold and impersonal; one person in our group said \"hoity toity,\" and the food was more expensive and not as quality compared to Houston's menu. Everything about Hillstone is the opposite of Houston's. Where the seating and atmosphere at Houston's was warm and inviting, at Hillstone it is cold and impersonal. 

Yes, obviously much money was spent on Hillstone but in our opinion, to its disadvantage because of its slight ostentatious presentation. It is pretty but something about it felt off.

We tried Hillstone two times in case the first time was a fluke but our experience was the same as the first. Bummer for them because at our favorite restaurants we always tip 30-45% of our bill.

In their defense two things:
1) Our experience was from the first year it opened which I noticed there are so many similar reviews to mine from that time, so maybe they made some adjustments and,

2) Maybe they are not trying to be like Houston's which is fine for them but not for us. We miss Houston's and wanted a version of it. Hillstone is not it. So we will keep searching."}
{"text":"Mouth-watering food, fabulous servers, and caring management make for a perfect combination at Hillstone Restaurant on Camelback Road in Phoenix, Arizona!  Having spent 86 days on the road (flying over 42,000 miles on American Airlines) last year, I have had the opportunity to eat at many, many fine eating establishments.  Hillstone is the very definition of \"WOW\" for the perfect dining experience!  My favorite selection on the menu is their famous French dip sandwich.  That may sound funny for a guy that eats out 7-10 times a week, consuming a weekly dinner consisting of an entire pound of King crab and a side of asparagus, but this sandwich is absolutely scrumptious!  Made with fabulously tender pieces of prime rib, it simply melts in your mouth, as one savors each bite.  The accompanying french fries are the best I've tasted anywhere, fried to perfection!  Allison, my server of choice, takes pride in passionately connecting with every guest, on every visit, through flawless and relentless execution of every detail.  From her warm and sincere welcome to her parting goodbye and thank you, Allison uses positive eye contact and her never-ending smile to make it clear that you are valued and appreciated!  I love how she anticipates my needs before I need to request.  The woman is simply delightful in every way and such a pleasure to have as your server!  Finally, I want to mention Amanda Murgas, Executive General Manager, whose hands-on style of management, assures consistent, professional performance of all staff, truly a team effort.  She always does a fantastic job of accommodating my seating preference.  Her warm and cheerful disposition makes any visit a very positive experience which is her personal goal for every guest!"}
{"text":"There's a good reason the French Dip is the Famous French Dip.  It's an absolute delight. It's tender, juicy, and just downright good.  I've also had the ahi salad and it was outstanding as well.  The place has a great atmosphere and Al is the man at the bar.  Not a large selection of craft brews but the ones they have were not the usual PHX beers and they were on point.  The Firestone Double Barrel Ale was perfect with the famous French dip.  I highly recommend Hillstone."}
{"text":"As always we had a fantastic experience here.  This time was actually exceptional. We brought our son with us and Sophia (our server) was awesome.  Sometimes when people bring kids to a restaurant the staff is put off but this place was just awesome.    Everyone stop by to say hi to him and the manager even brought him cut mango to try.   He loved the attention and we loved the experience.  Thank you Sophia for a perfect experience."}
{"text":"It's been about 3 years since Ive eaten here, it's decent but I never ate anything that wowed me until last night. I ordered the veggie burger and their curry corn side. Let me start with the burger. I dont see what is so outstanding about it. It was good, it wasnt orgasmic. In fact it fell apart when I picked it up because the pattie wasnt packed very tightly, it would have been much better if ordered on it's own and not in burger form. It was a mess to eat. For veggie burgers Four Peaks is the place to go.

Now the curry corn on the other hand...sweet jesus it was good enough to request as your last meal if you become unfortunate enough to be offered one on Death Row. I was actually irritated that my friend left hers until last because after mine was all gone she had a nice untouched pile just sitting their waiting to be devoured. I was green with envy as she ate each forkful without a care in the world while I salivated.

Houstons I beg you to make this a regular dish!!!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch and when I saw the place I expected it to be pricey, but saw the menu and it was decent.  Had the soup and salad lunch for a very reasonable price.

The soup was Tortilla soup and it was very tasty.  Not too spicy, lots of delicious bean taste and some nice sized chunks of fresh avocado floating in it.  My companion saw it and had to order some for himself.

The \"traditional salad\" was even better.  Fresh greens, freshly cooked bacon and croutons - everything was delicious and tasty.  The best salad I've eaten in memory.  Also a very generous serving - I couldn't finish it after the soup.

We ate at the bar and the service from the bartender was very friendly and quick and I'll be back."}
{"text":"Hillstone has such a lively atmosphere and it really doesn't seem like it matters what night you go in on it is always packed. This place has the best artichokes, steak salads, and drinks."}
{"text":"we are really picky-- for our anniversary-- we came back to Hillstone-- it was as good as always- and the service was spectacular!!! great setting, great food , great service!!!"}
{"text":"We were looking for Steak House! Google it.And gave us \"Hillstone\"on Camelback in phx.I'm always fascinated with food Cook by Chef as on T.V. :) . Savor the taste,ingredients.. Etc. Ordered Roasted Salmon w/Salad ( fancy kind!) But,forgot what kind ,had nuts in it. :) It was Delicious.:). Husband was looking for Cowboy Steak!  Turn out,All Good."}
{"text":"My \"go to\" for everything and anything!!
Consistent, superb food, atmosphere and service!  Truly,  the trifecta!!"}
{"text":"It's a gorgeous restaurant but there are 2 things in my head I can't shake....

1. The service is so-so considering how nice the place is..

2. They don't make double drinks per corporate policy."}
{"text":"Always great going to Hillstone for dinner! The Hawaiian Ribeye just doesn't get any better! It seems as if they changed the fries a little bit. I happen to like the old way better, but I'm not complaining!"}
{"text":"Wonderful night at Hillstone.  After a starter of their delicious oysters, I went with the special - 15 ounce steak and baked potato and my husband had the prime rib, mashed potatoes and brussel sprouts.  Everything was well-seasoned and cooked to perfection.  The bar also produced a delicious margarita!"}
{"text":"Well, I almost hate to give five stars because I don't want you taking my reservation spot...ha! But they deserve it. The food is great here, and if there is any problem with anything, which is not often, they make it right and fix it promptly. This is the whole package. Great, and I mean perfect service...not too much, and not to little. And if you need something while your server is helping someone else, any waiter you see coming or going will help you as if they were your server. Now, the food is excellent, real food, exactly what you're craving in well prepared American food or sushi. Steaks, burgers, ribs, fish... When our son comes home from college, this is always where he wants to go. The atmosphere is fantastic, music is at a perfect level and relaxing, and lighting is serine. And the seating, no matter where you sit, is comfortable..thank you. We've been coming here (was Houstons across the street originally) since before our son was born and brought him through the years. When he's 21 next summer, he's going to order a good beer with the rest of us!"}
{"text":"Love this restaurant, but I'm pretty sure other people got seated ahead of us Saturday night, We were out on the patio having a drink while we waited for a table instead standing by the receptionists table.  I had to go in after an hour to see if they had forgotten us.  They said they knew were out there, but it seemed odd to me that it took over an hour. I think if you put your name on the list, you should be seated in order regardless."}
{"text":"Always good!
Whether I am in New York, L.A., Or Phoenix, I can count on getting great food, a nice ambiance and fresh fish."}
{"text":"i like it, i like it a lot! (you must say it like Jim Carrey in Dumb and Dumber.)

We stopped in last night for dinner and cocktails.  I left quite satisfied with the experience.

The atmosphere, service, pricing, and food were all top notch.  

I really LOVED the grilled artichoke...you must try this.

I am excited to check out the new facility that will be opening late this year.  It is right down the street (in the spot that Chevy's was located.)

Check it out.."}
{"text":"Professional wait staff and high quality food. I had the tuna sashimi salad. It tasted great and had a decent amount of tuna. 

There is complimentary valet in front."}
{"text":"I'm never disappointed with the quality of food & friendly service at Hillstone.  Greetings are always warm and welcome a smile. I love the freshly squeezed grapefruit juice for a greyhound, when they don't have a good bubbly by the glass, (the wine list changes frequently).  And unfortunately, I'm not a fan of the bubbly stemware.  It's too thick of a glass to twirl and feels clunky. 

The food is always soooooo good!  Sushi is fresh!  The fries are hot, crispy, d'lish with lots of garlic. The salmon is cooked perfectly. The side veggies (or cheat mash potatoes) pair so well w any entree.  The burger is juicy & prepared as requested.  

The ambiance is energetic & lively.  People watching at the bar and patio is entertaining... And you may make new friends that way too! 

The place is always packed, that can be a good and bad thing.  Parking is tight.  Wait times can be long, but if you're in no hurry, it's a good time."}
{"text":"This review is not about the food, the food here is great!

This review is about the hostess that has us waiting, And Is sitting groups of 3 before us. Was told 20 min wait, but it now has been over 30 min and the larger tables are still empty. We are here for lunch, we could have eaten and left and still would be tables open, also people coming in and bring sitter before us, could this be because the hostess knows them? A lot of hugging going on."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was great, but the food was bad!!  My husband's ribs were burnt and dried out, and my chicken was fatty.  Very disappointed!!!!"}
{"text":"From the fabulous architecture, to the exceptional staff, to the delicious food!! Hillstone is an Arizona delight! One of our favorites!!"}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE this place! Been here about a dozen times for celebratory dinners and the service has been spot on every single time. There's generally a wait, but because they have a great bar and outdoor space - my bf and I have never minded the wait. It's usually about 45 mins or so on a busy night but no wait when going for lunch. I've been to many other steakhouses throughout the valley and have YET to find a better filet than Hillstone's. Came here for New Years and because our reservation was delayed over an hour, they comped our meal. This was such a nice gesture and especially great because our out of town guests that had joined us were blown away and plan to come back. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Despite its corporate feel (dare I say \"Corporationy!\") I have found that the service is always great at Houston's, and the food is just as good. 

For you meat eaters out there, the Hawaiian Ribeye will blow your hair back in the best possible way. They always have a great selection of produce available and veggie dishes are outstanding. 

The only bummer is that it's a bit of a hot spot so it takes a while to get a table, and the clientele are a little douchey. In any case, on more than one occasion I have pulled the dinner and a movie date at Houston's and continued up to the Esplanade above. It's a good bet, but leave extra time at the restaurant to get yourself a table."}
{"text":"We came here on a Friday night with high hopes with great recommendations from friends. Can we say very limited menu? Looking at the prices, I was expecting a more seasonal selection. Our server took forever to greet us. She barely even knew what the daily specials were! We heard the server at the next table list a couple of specials that our server had no idea about. Umm yeah had to pass on the 32 dollar strip steak special. Had the french dip (17 dollars), which was pretty good. The string like fries were tasty, just a bit salty. For the price and poor service, won't be going back."}
{"text":"This is my go to spot. Service is consistently immaculate no matter who you get. Tom the bartender pays attention to the customers names and what they drink with everyone I see. You can't go wrong with any of the food. I've tried it all and love it all. I generally get the Thai tuna roll with a kale salad as it's clean and fresh. Atmosphere is beautiful..lots of celebrities stop by here as they generally stay in the Biltmore area."}
{"text":"Seriously fancy food at a seriously fancy price. Found the food delicious although the service was a bit slow and not up to par considering how fancy the place was. I really like the design of the restaurant specially the outdoor seating and the decor and the architecture. Would recommend for those with fatter wallets."}
{"text":"The ribs are to die for here. It is an extremely busy place so reservations are recommended or come early. The fish was also really good. Wide menu selection and quality food."}
{"text":"Highly, highly recommended.
The food is outstanding and very reasonably priced. The French Dip is as good as it gets. The Thai Steak salad is amazing.
Make reservations because even though it is not a small place, it fills up fast for dinner."}
{"text":"This was simply one of the best dining experiences I've had in some time.  Came here on a recommendation from a Phoenix friend.  I had the chicken salad and my wife had the Thai Steak salad.  I'm not exaggerating when I say both were amazing.  Flavor extraordinaire.  
My daughter had the Filet and I found myself using the cliche, but it so fit... the steak melted in my mouth.  We were a bit full for dessert, but our server brought us some, complimentary... it did not disappoint.  If you don't mind spending a little more for nice atmosphere and outstanding food.  Go here."}
{"text":"Friends had highly recommended this place. After checking out the menu online, I wasn't wowed. The choices seemed somewhat old school, nothing flashy, unlike most of the newer upscale restaurants that have popped up around town over the last few years. However, when these generous friends gave us a gift certificate, reservations were made.
Wow. What a classy place! Really comfortable. The interior was just perfect. Wood and leather but with a sleek modern touch. Not too modern though. This warm and comfy atmosphere set off by a large, bright and bussling open kitchen really set the tone for the great meal to come. 
Just ticking through the items we ate: rainbow roll, each piece a bright explosion in your mouth.  Artichokes and dip, smoky and delish. Wife's filet, best I have ever sampled from her plate. My Hawaiian rib eye, while less tender loaded with flavor. Great key lime pie and excellent coffee to finish it all off.
This is a special occasion place that has truly earned all the accolades it has received. Can't wait for the next reason to try the Hillstone again."}
{"text":"When my husband made reservations he was asked if it was an occasion?, he told them it was my birthday. But couldn't  they couldn't  accommodate 8, really they have four tops they could push together. So we went and spent 600 dollars at seasons 52, but then decided to go the next nite with 2 friends to continue celebrating. First they ran out of crab cake special for birthday girl, then nothing!!!!why ask if its a celebration if u do nothing for the  occasion !! Really poor and disappointing for a restaurant that pro-ports its service."}
{"text":"OK... it's a chain. It's also one of the very few places where my dad, boyfriend, and I can go and everyone can get a meal that they genuinely like. It's a little pricey and their dessert menu leaves a lot to be desired, but their frigging veggie burger is the most delicious one in the Valley. BAR NONE. Yes, it falls apart. I don't care. I slather a bunch of BBQ sauce on it and oh my god..... and the crispy little shoestring fries on the side are perfection. I will have horrible heartburn after every time but that's because I eat, like, three times more than I usually do just because it is so so delicious. 

My main tip is to park across the way in the Biltmore parking lot and walk through the tunnel, because the parking garage attached to that complex with Houston's is a total clusterfuck."}
{"text":"Bad night for our party of three. Shawn, the manager tried making it right. Simply put, we came on a recommendation to order the steak salad as it was reported to be out of this world.  Several suggested this to us.  Thus we ordered after asparagus appetizer, super and martini.   Surprise.  The steak is marinated for ten hours. There was none in the house.  Shawn told us it sold out at lunch.  We were seated at six pm.  My wife did not believe him. She guessed a large party had yet to arrive and had requested this dish. I asked for the check an went elsewhere. My wife recalled we ate at at this chain in San Francisco.  I did not recall.  Must not have been notable."}
{"text":"yes, this is a standard Houstons with a different name
(but the same food)
but what made me happy about my dining experience was the service

i tried their famous french dip which was absolutely delicious
while the bread wasn't my fav
the meat, au jus and horseradish were very good
i also opted for the kale salad instead of the fries and liked it a lot

overall, it was a great spot for a nice family dinner"}
{"text":"Was looking forward to eating here as I don't get down to the Biltmore area all that often and have always wanted to try Hillstone.   Stopped in for lunch last week and was very disappointed.    First off it is hard to find the hostess desk.   When you walk in from the parking lot you walk right into the bar.   They have to have a sign guide you to the hostess stand and even then it's hard to navigate your way.  We got there about 2:00 pm so didn't have to wait.  We were greeted promptly by a pleasant young woman who took our drink orders.  A young man delivered our drinks.   Then we had to wait forever for someone to take our order.   Finally a waiter stopped by but he literally just stood there.    We told him it was our first time in and he didn't ask if we had any questions about the menu or try to sell us an appetizer.   He literally just \"stood there.\"   The items we ordered included smoked salmon appetizer, spinach artichoke dip, prime rib, classic California roll, bread, margaritas, apple walnut cobbler.   The food was not that good.   I ordered the prime rib medium well and they had to sear it to bring the temperature up.   I know prime rib is a fatty cut of meat but this was almost all fat.   It was just awful!!  We asked for bread but did not realize until we got the bill there is a separate charge for bread.   Of course our \"wonderful\" waiter failed to inform us of this.   The spinach artichoke dip was extremely greasy.   The best thing we ordered were the margaritas.   They were excellent.  I believe in giving a place at least three chances but this place does not deserve it.    Try the Capital Grille right down the road.   I've never had a bad experience there."}
{"text":"Been here close to a dozen times, and it has ALWAYS been amazingly predictably great. If you are looking for all around great american food, in a moderately upscale setting, go here, you will NOT be disappointed.  I have had almost every item on the menu, and non have been a disappointment. Highly Recommended for a night out with the significant other, or with some friends to have drinks."}
{"text":"Went they for my daughters birthday on a Monday. Daughter and son in law have been there several times before and had a nice time. This time they didn't have their favorite wine. My daughter wanted the prime rib. The waiter said they are out of prime rib, do she picked the strip steak, they are out of strip steak. She finally had the filet. Waited explained they we're having trouble with the distributor. He went on to say \" distributor was charging to much\". Really, a better steak place that doesn't steaks. Won't be back. If you go, good luck."}
{"text":"This place is incredible and I would highly recommend dining here for a date night or if you just want to have a nice dinner.

We tried the Thai tuna roll, which was probably one of the best sushi rolls I've ever had in my life. It was incredibly fresh and very unique - the macadamia nuts really added a nice touch to the roll.

Ordered the ribeye, was incredible as well. Tender and perfectly cooked. Seared and perfectly seasoned. 


In summary: my girlfriend and I basically talked about how delicious the food was the whole time we were eating."}
{"text":"One of my fav restaurants of all time. I dare you to find better food & better service somewhere. Try the off-menu chicken tenders."}
{"text":"Lack-luster

I have been disappointed the two times I have visited Houston's.  Their veggie burger is soggy and grainy at the same time (I am not sure how they managed that)...not an appealing taste.  Their \"famed\" baked potato was dry and was nothing out of the ordinary.  

Frankly, I could have made something better for myself and saved the money.  The redeeming factor was that the service was decent and the restaurant was semi-attractively decorated.  

Overall I would not come back unless I have to (aka my friends drag me along)

*** Was informed by a fellow yelper that the place re-opened down the block under a different name, Hillstone

I hope the new name was followed by a new menu."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place after learning it used to be Houston's and I used to LOVE Houston's back when I lived in Rockville, MD.  I was extremely disappointed that the hostess and establishment could not seat us outside unless we would only want to order appetizers.  The appetizers menu consisted mostly of sushi and three other items.  I am pregnant so this in no way would work for me!  I thought it was very discriminating of them to not make an exception for me and let me order a salad outside.  The rest of my party would have been happy with just sushi, but I am not about to take chances with sushi and pregnancy.  I am very obviously 7 months pregnant and it is hard enough being pregnant and they just made it worse that night.  We ended up waiting 15 minutes for a table inside and of course I was crying and our poor server was probably thinking WTF.  He was a very nice guy and a very good server and he did make up for a little bit of how I felt I was discriminated against.  I ordered the Thai noodle salad and it was good.  The mango was super ripe and the avocado was also nice.  My husband and his brother both ordered some crispy oysters that were served on a bed of creamed spinach and they loved their meals.  My sister-in-law got the ribs which they are known for.  Her cole slaw was good.  Also we had started with the spinach dip and chips and they were pretty much your run-of-the mill item.  Nothing spectacular.  Not bad but not anything you probably can't get at TGIFridays.  The dessert offerings were only strawberry shortcake, key lime pie or an ice cream sundae so we skipped dessert.  Honestly I am not into fruity desserts or ice cream but probably for the best we skipped it!  If I hadn't been discriminated against I would have given four stars to this place.  It just isn't right to treat pregnant women that way."}
{"text":"Food is good, but not great. Missing the final touch! Ordered the ribs, kale salad and ice tea. Service was excellent, besides the fact that they did not allow us to dine in their patio area. What kind of a policy is that? If we want to enjoy a beer and ribs on the patio then we should be able to, Period."}
{"text":"5/27/2015 - I must be the only one. I must be the only one because the parking lot is packed. 

HAVE YA CHECKED THE PRICES AT HILLSTONE?  Wow!  Have a look:

* French Dip: $24 (really good!  Still not 
  worth $24)
* NY Strip: $54. FIFTY FOUR DOLLARS! 
* side dishes: $8. Side dishes at Tavern on  
  the Green are $9. 
* Jumbo Shrimp Cocktail: $21

THESE ARE NOT MISPRINTS. I found the menu on my phone, AND, since you are not being held captive, you, I, can go elsewhere. Donovan's Steak House serves a better steak for less money. 

I must be the only one. 

I just looked up what I thought is the most ridiculously priced menu I could think of, Tavern on the Green in New York City, and basically, Hillstone was priced the same or more on comparable items. 

The burger at Hillstone is $21. \"Ground chuck served all the way...\"  What does that even mean?  \"...served all the way\"????
The 21 Club in mid-town Manhattan, long-serving a very expensive burger, they charge $18 for a burger, add bacon, $2. MORE THAN 21 Club. Sheesh. 

(You know what I'm gonna do?  I'm gonna go have a burger Hillstone [for $21!] and then I'm gonna have a burger at Houston's [$15] and I'll bet it's the same damn burger.)

Shrimp cocktail at Hillstone is $21. At 21 in NYC is $21. You go Hillstone. I stay here. 

Side orders: $8. Side orders Tavern on the Green: $9.  

Well, \"I may be the only one\", but I'm no fool.  You go. You go fill up their parking lot. Outside of Vegas, I don't believe I've seen a $54 steak.  Thank God.

5/18/2015 got a message today that a burger at Hillstone is not $21 but $16. I googled \"Hillstone menu\" and the menu that came up is, in fact, lower  --  all around. The problem is, Hillstone definitely has TWO menus on the Internet and I'm going to post this higher-than-high menu that is not correct. ¡That's a problem!

Based on the new pricing I'll upgrade: 3 stars. That was a very, very good prime rib sandwich!"}
{"text":"Houston's has always been the \"go to\" restaurant for my in-laws. Whenever anyone is visiting from out of town we go to Houston's for a nice casual dinner. 

We were a little sad when they told us they were closing, but excited that they were building a brand new building just down the road. 

Last night the Hubs, mother in law and I decided to hit up Houston's. We pulled up to the valet and no one was there, we look and Houston's is gone. Then we looked and noticed the Hillstone sign was lit. 

The hubs and MIL didn't believe me that Hillstone and Houston's were the same company. But they are! Woot! 

The new building is AMAZING! I loved the patio, though they will only serve apps and drinks out there, they wont let you have dinner out there which is to bad considering last night was perfect out door dinning weather. 

The new building has that same Houston's vibe, only its way bigger! It now features two bars AND a sushi bar! 

The food is still the same and still just as amazing as it always is! 

One note of complaint however. The old Houston's used to offer a Riesling by the glass, now its only by the bottle, which is a total bummer because that's all my MIL will drink. 

We really had a great experience as we always do with this company."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch the other day, I must say.. this restaurant is sooo pretty! I really liked the patio too..but we didn't eat outside (I wish I did). The service was decent, not the best that I have had..never would I think a man would not know the whiskey at the restaurant he worked at though *confused? How do you not know what whiskey you have? 

So anyways, my friend and I ordered the Chicago Spinach and Artichoke dip and it was really good! I loved it. I would definitely order that again :)  My friend order the Spicy Tuna Roll, I was a bit skeptic at first but yet, it was surprisingly pretty good.

I ended up getting the fresh fish of the day, it was some weird random fish from New Zealand, I really liked it, especially with the lemon sauce on top."}
{"text":"Hillstone is a classy and upscale restaurant located in the Camelback East Village area of Phoenix. The menu features a wide array of options from sushi to salads and from steak to burgers. My burger was very good, but be expected to pay more than you would. It's a little pricey for my taste, but I can't deny that they serve wonderful food here. Make sure you dress to impress and if need be, there is also a valet at the restaurant. 

The staff is friendly and service excellent, adding to the overall experience. Definitely recommended."}
{"text":"Love going here and have never been disappointed. The staff are so well trained and have a great buddy system.. They pay attention to detail and are always put out great food consistently... My family and I have been going here for years and will continue too.... Everything is homemade from the ketchup to the the sweet and sour used in the Long Island.. Drinks are always strong... I always order the Hawaiian ribeye with fries and spicy mayo.. Spinach and artichoke dip.. For desert the hot fudge Sunday and yes it's homemade too! Delish"}
{"text":"I was in Phoenix for business and found this place based on yelp reviews.  I must say, this place is absolutely delicious!!  For starters, the service was very knowledgeable and friendly.  The chef's were extremely creative which led to my questions that the servers explained in completeness.  Lets get to the food... 

I came with 3 co-workers and all of our meals were delicious.  I had the pork ribs and they were fantastic.  I was able to substitute the sides for whatever I wanted without a problem.  Everything came out delicious!  The ribs were fall-off the bone, some of the best ribs I've had.  Extremely tender and not overwhelmed with sauce.  Highly recommend this establishment."}
{"text":"I was introduced to hillstone (houston's) years ago by a friend of mine when I worked in midtown Manhattan. By far, the BEST French dip I've ever had. Hands down. Fast forward to living in Phoenix and meeting hubby and he now is hooked. We've since relocated to San Diego but are coming to AZ this weekend and I'm planning how we can fit in a visit to Hillstone on Sunday before we leave!!

The spinach dip is also awesome. Tons of spinach and love the sour cream and salsa on the side. With the French dip, I like that you can get it done to your specifications--in my case, still mooing! The fries are excellent too. I've literally never had a bad meal here and service is always great. very consistent with food and service across the board. 

Please, please please come to SD!!! Driving up to Santa Monica to get my French dip fix is no Bueno!!"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere and well maintained. Staff are friendly and food is delicious. Took a little long for food to arrive and my steak was over cooked but otherwise a good experience. I will dine here again."}
{"text":"Houston's, Hillstone...they're all the same.  What you get is delicious food, great service, a slick atmosphere, and an expensive tab.  

Hillstone is the perfect business dinner or date night spot.  The bar is nice and the patio is great.  For the food you can't go wrong with anything but my go to is the French dip or the ribs."}
{"text":"Hillstone is one of the best restaurants in town.  Fabulous people, excellent staff, and the food is always fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"While I've been to both Houston's and Bandera multiple times, last night was my first visit to Hillstone, the umbrella responsible for all of them. 

Let's just say I'll be hard pressed to go anywhere but Hillstone from now on. 

There was a wait, so we started on the outdoor patio for a drink. The outdoor space is really amazing. Cool lights, unique furniture and overall a great ambiance. I ordered a Maker's Manhattan rocks, and the drink was perfect...So often Manhattans are \"over Vermouthed\", this one was the perfect blend and let the Whiskey speak for itself...Even the ice cubes looked cool. 

The restaurant is large, spacious and has a cool design. It's very Frank Lloyd Wright esque. We sat at a booth toward the back of the restaurant, near the kitchen and prep bar. Service was prompt and friendly, as I've come to expect at any Hillstone restaurant.

As for the food, it was delicious. As a table, we ordered the Hawaiian rib eye x2 (ridiculous, mine was a perfect medium rare and delicious), the French Dip and the Prime rib. All meals were well received, even the salads were delicious. The menu is really similar to Houston's (read: nearly identical), so you know what you're getting into.

It's not cheap, but it's absolutely worth it. Hillstone is on my list for a return trip, ASAP."}
{"text":"Love the ambiance and the food! Definitely an older crowd, but still hip and happening."}
{"text":"Fantastic, one of the best chain restaurants one can hope for. Atmosphere is 5/5. Food is 4/5 but very good. Limited wine list, but some quality options (which was actually quite refreshing given the trend to have wine list overload)."}
{"text":"Ahh the incredible eatery that is Hillstone! This restaurant is as modern as it is delicious. I may use this phrase a little too much, but in my humble opinion, when I use these two words \"THE BEST\", I honestly mean it...so here goes...I do, humbly, declare this restaurant to have THE BEST (and freshest) margaritas that I've ever had (and I've been to Mexico). I don't declare this statement lightly people; Their margaritas are a MUST order! So what makes this great concoction so brilliant you may be asking yourself? Well, they make their margarita mix in house every single day, so it's as fresh as the sunrise. This means that they squeeze the lemons and limes on the daily and make their own sweet and sour mix. The secret ingredient that makes this margarita so light and foamy is egg white; that's right, they put farm fresh egg white into their margarita mix to add some sort of magical flavor to this magnificent concoction. So *WARNING*-don't drink this magic potion if you're allergic to eggs. I honestly just love sitting on their outside patio (which is connected to their bar area) and ordering a couple of margaritas while eating some sushi (also fantastic) and oysters St. Charles (double-y fantastic) and just enjoy the beautiful weather/hustle and bustle of Arizona.  Main dish wise...you honestly can't make any bad choices; from the Hawaiian ribeye to their prime rib (I'm a carnivore obviously) to their salads, it's all grand! But please, please, PLEASE do yourself a favor and get a margarita while you're here. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Hillstone is one of my go to's. The pressed sushi is something you must get. That is what keeps me coming back. Everything here is delicious. Good wine list. Servers know what they are talking about. Even the nice little house salad is so simple yet divine! I have not a bad thing to say about this establishment."}
{"text":"Hillstone is customer service done right. We had reservations and they were a little delayed. They went out of their way to keep us up to date on our reservation and comped us an appetizer for the wait. The food is always outstanding and the service is top notch.
This definitely one of the great Biltmore
restaurants."}
{"text":"This is definitely a place for atmosphere and ambience. Very impressive exterior patio and interior dining room. The food was delicious, but I did have an issue with the warmth of my steamed vegetables. They got cold really fast. In any event I would go again, but not for a while due to the price point."}
{"text":"Best affordable wine list in the valley. The food is fantastic and the service is even better. Love this place. Think I'll go there for lunch today :)"}
{"text":"I had dinner a few weekends ago.  I had a great time the restaurant is beautiful.   The patio was full but plenty of room to stand. Such great follow up even with a full house."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with mom and bf - it was a great experience. Decor - 5 (like all other Hillstone restaurants), service - 5, food - 5. 

Our waitress had a good sense of humor. She was also very kind and attentive, brought us extra plates as she saw us sharing some of the dishes. 

The food was just as good as always. We were happy to see some new items that were not available in new york. The poke was alright, but the California burger and thai salad were very pleasantly delicious. 

The outdoor seating looked great - but as they only serve mini menu there and we were expecting a solid dinner, we didn't got to try the outdoor seatings by the water. Maybe next time!"}
{"text":"For our wedding anniversary, we wanted to go to a nice decent restaurant. First thought was Houston's, but my husband's work schedule gets him home a little late. Fortunately I knew Hillstone has the same Hawaiian steak, my hubby's favorite,  plus they were also open later than Houston's. Service was delightful and our server, without mentioning it beforehand, brought out a little dish of some kind of garlicky buttermilk spread. She said it goes well with our cheesy toast appetizer, which it deliciously did! It was also good with my hubby's steak. I had the Thai noodle mango salad with steak, also like Houston's. Simply delicious!"}
{"text":"Three words: THAI. TUNA. ROLL.
Get it. You won't be disappointed.  

In addition, the California and the Mango Salmon Rolls were quite good as well.  While Arizona isn't a place known for stand-out sushi, I'd order it here again.  And in fact I did...two nights in a row. 

Night #1 - The bartender was a superb professional. He replaced drink napkins when they were damp and even poured my martini into a fresh cold glass when I was half-way done.  Class act.  He was also the one who recommended the Thai Tuna Roll which adds even more points to his score, if possible.  

Night #2 - CRANKY bartender. While she recommended a nice glass of white wine, she poured me a totally different one the second time.  While it was St Patrick's Day, it's not like this place was packed out with annoying patrons so I'm not sure what put her in such a bad place. It did leave me with a not-so-happy feeling when I left, despite the fact that the food was just as good as the first go-around.  

So, what could be the only gripes aside from the attitude?  
* You will pay a chunk of change for your meal here (but it will likely be worth it) 
* You will also likely order something that they're out of (mango salmon roll the first night, grilled artichoke the second night, and every night I've ever gone to a Hillstone, for that matter)
* It's a chain

Bottom line is that Hillstone is probably one of the better options in this neck of the woods.  Go for a cocktail and a Thai Tuna Roll, if nothing else."}
{"text":"Whoo hooo is this place pricey.  The atmosphere is elegant and the patio is beautiful.  Per a friend's tip, I got the prime rib sandwich and it was delicous.  I was actually taken there by a friend for my birthday. Would I pay nearly $20 for a sandwich? No, but it was good.  We also had the french fries and they were delicous. The perfect middle point between soggy and overdone.  Very good (easily able to split between two people because they give you a ton of them)

A woman next to me had the beef/salad and if I go back again I would order that as I found the sandwich to be extremely filling."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place for a work lunch while in Phoenix.

Pros:

-part of the Hillstone Group, including Banderas, Houston's, Gulfstream. All around great places
-tasty chicken salad
-great outdoor seating with fireplace
-great ambience with dark interior

Cons:

-None

Verdict:

This is a great all around place. Consistent quality food, solid establishment. It's great for work lunches and dinners."}
{"text":"USED TO BE MY FAVORITE RESTAURANT..... I called to place a take out order..... NOW..... you either do take out or you don't. Even if it's busy, you can say it is going to take a long time because we are backed up...... BUT to tell a customer that you can't do a takeout because you're too busy basically says.... we are busy enough today we don't need your business. It's just one more ticket on the cooks line it could take an hour or more.... at least give me the option. The four of us all wanted Hillstone.  
The snobbiness of the staff, that pretentiousness that says.... I work in an upscale, high class clientele restaurant does not make an employee.... upscale and high class. It doesn't extend to you.... so represent the establishment in a manner that says.... you, the customers,are important.  Not, I'm much too busy to help you. You will make your money tonight, but the restaurant lost $$$.00. I'm sorry but I've been in some of the finest restaurants around.....YOU JUST TOLD ME I DONT MATTER TO THIS ESTABLISHMENT.  And I am a regular. Very disappointed that I put up with what I perceived as stuck up employees because I liked the food and atmosphere. This broke the camels back. HILLSTONE..... keep it real.... you are in the HOSPITALITY Industry..... be hospitable. She didn't even apologize or say... please come again we are so sorry. 
Also: please update your website menu. A restaurant of this stature doesn't have someone updating their online menu?"}
{"text":"Place was packed on a Tuesday night so I had high expectations Was not let down The Hawaiian ribeye was cooked to medium rare perfection and I'm a stickler for cooking beef to order. Enough said really"}
{"text":"Terrific food. Innovative and delicious. Portions are huge but lend themselves nicely to sharing. Great variety in the menu and everything was excellent. 

The restaurant tables are not set up for groups larger than 7 fairly skinny adults and that was in a booth. If you have more than 6 or 7 you will have to sit at 2 different tables."}
{"text":"I originally thought the place was a knock of of Houston's and had to visit a couple of times to realize it had it's on personality. The sushi appetizers were really good and I have tried several of the entrees over time and have never been disappointed. The Hot Fudge Sunday dessert is memorable and one of my wife's favorites. 
I did discount one star for the service. It's a little impersonal and doesn't have the sharp edge as other similar places here in town."}
{"text":"So glad Houston's moved their old location to this impressively designed building.  Apparently it is lifted off the ground just enough so no car lights shine into their glass walls....I could go on and on about the design but take it from a FLW/modern/contemporary enthusiast and with a lil Asian flare, you have Hillstone.

Why they decided to not serve a full menu on the patio probably has to do with the fact that they decided to make it like sand box...literally the ground is set up like a zen garden but for dining, it doesn't work.  Having watched almost a half dozen people trip (we started watching and counting....part of the fun from the evening) it was not fun having the small pebble/kitty litter ground dust up my freshly polished, black shoes.

Service was so bad that we got 3 free drinks and an order of sushi BUT the fact they realized the service wasn't atypical for them so it didn't really bother us...although my trying to stay slimmer a$$ didn't have a Mich Ultra option for a beer.....wah-wah. 

Same impressive Cole slaw noted by my guest and their mango, coconut shrimp, Thai, and spicy tuna rolls were ALL fantastic.....also I guess the wasabi is organic so instead of a huge glob that one would assume to accompany their roll, it is asked if desired, and then a small amount is served.....not sure I agree with this attention to detail since I couldn't tell, but that's me.

Overall, it's a Biltmore and Phx-metro must....if they pick up the service and fix those patio issues then they would get a 4.  A place that is too loud to eat in the restaurant and has on the menu \"No Cell Phones In the Restaurant\" would never get 5 from me. The mid to late 40's is the average age which isn their fault but another factor to me that holds a location from perfection.

{"text":"The food, atmosphere and service are always top notch. Recently, a delayed order put their customer service to the test and they passed with flying colors. They were prompt informing us of the issue, ensured we were comfortable (and fed) during our wait and just really took care of us before, during and after our meal. They went above and beyond expectations for customer service. I highly recommend Hillstone and will be returning soon."}
{"text":"Had Happy Hour @ Hillstone last week.  The decor and atmosphere are wonderful.  The patio was welcoming and comfortable.  I'm looking forward to enjoying it once the weather warms up a little more.

The wine selections were nice and the appetizers were good, although they could have offered more selections of appetizers.  No happy hour offerings/discounts."}
{"text":"Ok, I just do not get this place. At all. Packed with traveling insurance brokers, horny 30 somethings, and desperate housewife wanna be's, the scene is kinda terrifying. The bar was ok, except we had these meat head types breathing down our necks behind us because they couldn't sit at the bar and were obviously bent out of shape about it. When the hostess finally came to get us,  she told me I wouldn't be seated in the dining room unless I removed my hat. Is that a promise or a threat? When we were finally seated, the waiter was snooty. Snooty! Why?? You work in a glorified TGI Friday!! 

The food could have been outstanding (it wasn't) and it really wouldn't have mattered. There's so many better places to eat in this town."}
{"text":"Ive been to this place a couple times in New Jersey, i went here with a friend for lunch. I knew already that i wanted the spinach and artichoke dip, something i think they do pretty well. I then decided to go with the Hawaian Ribeye Steak. I asked for it to be cooked medium-rare, it came out medium-rare. Something i am often dissapointed in restaurants serving steak. This steak was fantastic. Every bite just kept me wanting more and more, the sweet glaze they put on the steak tastes soooo good. I wasnt expecting to enjoy it as much as i did, in fact i can't wait to go back and order it again. Its no Ruth Chris or Mastro's quality but still very good for the price."}
{"text":"Service is excellent, the ribs are amazing, and I highly recommend their Moscow mules.  I would call in and make a reservation. Also, their desserts are phenomenal.  I would also recommend the Thai noodle steak salad.  Fantastic experience overall."}
{"text":"Houston's is one of my fav's.  I think the part I like the most, is that they do not allow cell phones in thier dining room...according to the bottom of the menus anyway.  

I have never had a bad meal here, and the service is really good too.  The bar is a bit crowed after work, but the drinks are good.

Parking can be interesting if you don't like to valet (I don't), as the garage can fill up quickly.

If you like steak, ribs or burgers, head over to Houston's."}
{"text":"I have been to Houston's several times now, but always for lunch. It's always been on my company's or boyfriend's dime. To me, it's more than what I like to pay for a lunch. But the atmosphere is very nice and the servers are among the best in the city. 

But the food is amazing. The prime rib french dip is divine and I get it almost every time. The fries are delicious and I over eat and plan on doing so when I go. 

Overall, a beautiful place for a business lunch, date, or place to grab a drink and app before a movie."}
{"text":"Let's start off by saying that Ted was a fantastic bartender and host. He was lively and cheerful, and he definitely made our dinner experience great. He's an older gentleman, who is very welcoming and hospitable. As soon as my co-worker and I sat down, he greeted us and helped us out with menus and information. We asked what he recommended, and he pretty must listed everything on the menu. Lol. 
We chose this place based on reviews, and we were so glad we did. The food was delicious. My co-worker ordered the Thai Sushi Roll with the side salad, and she said it was the best meal she had in the two weeks we were in Phoenix. The roll had avocado and macadamia nuts. The salad had kale. I ordered the veggie burger, and I enjoyed it. It came with fries. 
The place was filled with lots of people from surrounding businesses. All the men were in button up shirts and the ladies in nice slacks and skirts. I liked the atmosphere. It was very social, and the place was lively."}
{"text":"Class act every time. Food is 1000% consistent, and service is always top notch!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a truly upscale dining experience in Phoenix you must try Hillstone.  My brother and I came here for a sushi lunch and were greeted by a hostess in a black cocktail dress with the appropriate jewelry.  She led us past the station where we could see the sushi chefs creating artistic masterpieces and finally deposited us at a dimly lit table that felt secluded even though there were other tables all around us.  This beautifully decorated restaurant has mastered the feel of Old World elegance.  They appear to achieve this effortlessly, though I'm sure it is not as easy as it seems.  The menu does discreetly remind you to do your part \"Please refrain from using cell phones in the dining room.\"

The waitress was very knowledgeable about the menu and was able to accurately describe how each type of sushi was made.  My brother and I were saddened to hear that they did not have their famous artichokes on the menu at this time of year.  The waitress let us know that the artichokes produced by their supplier were better at a different time of the year and would be back on the menu when their high standards were met.

We started our lunch with an order of fresh guacamole, salsa, and corn chips. The salsa and guacamole were beautifully constructed and it was easy to tell they were freshly made that day.  They were gone in no time at all

Our waitress was quite solicitous \"Would you like some warm towels before your sushi?\"  Why, yes, we would.  She brought us warm damp towels to freshen our hands with and chilled bowls for our soy sauce.  We felt quite well taken care of as she unobtrusively came and went.  My brother exclaimed \"She is a ninja\" at one point as she took dirty dishes and unneeded silverware aware without drawing our notice.

I ordered the Thai tuna thai roll which was beautifully plated in a diamond pattern and accompanied by several dipping sauces.  I tried the rolls with and without the sauces and every bite was like a revelation.  Truly the best sushi I have ever had.

My brother, Josh, ordered one of the pressed sushi rolls paired with a kale and cashew salad.  I tasted one of the pressed sushi rolls and it was as magnificent as my rolls had been.  Luckily for me, my brother is not big on kale, so I talked him into letting me have his salad.  The kale and cashew salad was simply amazing and was definitely worthy of being its own main dish.

Unfortunately, we did not save room for dessert on this visit, but I would like to come back when the artichokes are in season and promise to save room for the dessert next time!

This is a very classy (dressy) restaurant, but it is Phoenix so casual is also an acceptable option.  Most of the people in the restaurant when we were there were dressed in suits or designer dresses, but my brother and I were dressed very casually (we went hiking after lunch) and were treated with just as much respect as those who were dressed more appropriately."}
{"text":"First time (yesterday) in for lunch...

Drawn in by the architecture.  Parking was plentiful (and shady).  Beautiful coy fish at the entry.  Peaceful ambiance.  Hostess (who was also our server), was very friendly & accommodating.  We ordered a couple of House Made Veggie Burgers (in hopes of something comparable to the late J. Alexander's in Scottsdale).  I ordered mine without the bun, which was displayed with a bigger slice of tomato & large pieces of lettuce to take the bun's place.  The flavor and texture was great!  Jamie was a great server (we never had an empty glass or our plates sitting on the table).  She was prompt and very polite.  

This was a great experience...we'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"While visiting my brother and family in Phoenix and after a great day in Sedona I took our families to Houston's for dinner. My daughter used to work for the Houston's GM at one of their affiliates, Bandera in Sacramento. The environment was a bit dark and very reminiscent of Bandera, which I like. Due to our daughter's connection out table (two)were treated to a nice assortment of appetizers which were all tasty, The artichoke spinach dip and salmon were particularly enjoyable. My brother and I both had the Hawaiian (teriyaki glazed) Ribeye and they )at least mine, was prepared perfectly, perfectly. Surprisinly they had one of my favorite wines on the list too - Napa Valley's Swanson Merlot (2005) and it complimented the steak very nicely. I finished with the 'Harvest' Cheesecake and double espresso and then we all drove back to my brother's house very content - thank you Houston's."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time with a good friend who recommended this place! Exceeded my expectations. Not only was the food and drink amazing but Al our bartender was spectacular! His customer service was 10/10. Incredibly friendly and full of jokes. I will for sure be coming back!"}
{"text":"The meals here are always CRAZY good.   The staff are the highest level of professionals you can ever experience here in the valley.  So attentive and knowledgable. 

I love the design and ambience here. The diners range from casual tourists to suit wearing business lunchers.  

Not cheap.... but worth every penny."}
{"text":"The food was great and the service was great. Everything was a bit overpriced but I guess it comes with the territory. The grilled artichoke appetizer was creative and yummy. I also enjoyed the khalesalad with cashews in it as a side dish to my French onion dip sandwich. The spinach artichoke dip was also very yummy. The lemonade and tea were not my speed. Go smoke salmon was very delicious, perfectly cooked and most importantly it was juicy and flavorful."}
{"text":"I was super impressed by how fast we were seated on a Saturday night. Although our server was a bit awkward at times, she was incredibly nice. 

I ordered the Thai Steak and Noodle Salad. It was the best thing I have eaten in a while. The salad was bursting with flavor. Mango, avocado, basil and tomatoes, how could you go wrong? The steak itself was incredible. It was so tender and juicy that it seemed too dissolve in your mouth...

I'm definitely going back!"}
{"text":"I love eating IN. The food is on par, the service is above.  
 My problem is with take out.  I've done it twice and I swear they half the portion sizes.  I've ordered the French dip, a huge meaty sandwich in restaurant and been satisfied, take half home. Ordered it for take out and boom, I would have been happier at subway, it's a pathetic sandwich half filled with barely any fries.  
My husband ordered the ribs today and loved them so I ordered it to go for my kids today double fry,  no slaw and and my kid came to me and said \"really mom? 7 French fries?\" That's lunch?\"    I looked and sure enough...they split fries to two bags for to go. 
And it was a pretty pathetic rack of ribs too.  
$80 bucks for 2 and a half meals means I'm aggrevated.  
 Making sandwiches for my kids after I paid  for a meal because I had a shit day and didn't want to in the first place because I needed 1 hour away ?  I'm done.    
0 stars."}
{"text":"This was my favorite restaurant in all of Phoenix until today. It was probably my fifth visit to Hillstone. We went for lunch. It was a nice day outside so we sat on the patio. I order the same thing every time I've been there, the Hiroshima roll and kale salad. Today it just didn't taste right. I would have asked to return it if the server had checked on us even once. But she only came to the table to take the order and bring the bill. She was friendly but the food and service were so bad today I will not be returning. With all the good restaurants in Phoenix it's a shame to pay $50 for lunch with water and have such a bad tasting meal and awful service."}
{"text":"I do love love Houstons! Had lunch here yesterday while traveling on business in Phoenix. I had the club salad! So good! I was so tempted to order my favorite dish- the french dip-but since I  had meetings and did not want to be in a food coma - I opted for the salad. The diet coke was soooo refreshing and the server was on it for refills! It was 110+ degrees out so OMG I needed a great thirst quencher! 

I thought the food was fabulous and the service was pretty good! :-) Great spot for a business lunch too!"}
{"text":"I was very disappointed with the pork ribs that I ordered. They were extremely dry with very little meat. I had heard such good things about this establishment, so this was a very unexpected outcome. My friend was happy with the salmon that she ordered, so I guess that ribs just aren't their forte."}
{"text":"Amazing. So many companies don't understand how important it is for their customers to leave happy. Let me explain. It was Valentine's Day 2015.  They were packed. It is just my fiancee and I. We ordered burgers, some appetizers and drinks.  While we were waiting for our food our server accidentally spilled a bowl of cheese dip on the seat where my fiancee was sitting. It splattered all over the side of her nice purse. (Thank God she was in the restroom at the time). I covered the server and let her know I would make sure she doesn't find out. I felt pretty bad for her because she was sweet. I cleaned off her purse and it was like new. No harm no foul.  That was just the first incident of the evening.  We continued to wait an hour or so for just 2 burgers to come out. I'm sure you are thinking at this point I am crazy to still have this as a 5 star review. Keep reading.  Well finally our burgers come out.  Luckily we had some Artichoke dip and chips to hold us over until the burgers came out.  When the food finally came out the server told us she was so sorry and that the burgers were on them.  Nice gesture. I was pretty surprised. So many people have bad service at restaurants, but half the time I feel like its probably the customers demeanor to their servers.  My fiance and I are the type to be overly friendly to every server so everywhere we go it seems we have great service. Servers make mistakes. They are human. What matters is how they handle the situation after.  By the end of our evening we had ordered drinks, an appetizer, sides, burgers and a dessert. The bill was over $100.  The manager comes out and apologizes profusely for our experience. What he didn't know is that we weren't even mad. It was Valentine's Day so of course it's going to take a while for the food to come out.  When he came out he informed us that the entire bill is covered. Needless to say our server got a fat tip.  I have never seen such a thing before. What most businesses don't understand is that by him taking the financial hit he just ensured #1 me coming back in the future and #2 me giving this restaurant positive word out mouth. You can't put a price tag on that.  What also helped was the fact that their burger was one of the best I have ever had.  All of the rest of the food we got was delicious as well.  The ambiance and layout of the restaurant are amazing.  Everyone on the staff was friendly despite them having a hectic night.  I had a great experience and can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"We absolutely love this place. Food is fantastic, the ambiance great, and service exceptional. The only true downfall is it's rather noisy, so it's difficult for my hearing-impaired husband to hear; but we love it nonetheless. - Muffy Bennett / Gary Bennett"}
{"text":"Recently stopped in for drinks and apps. Loved the place. modern decor in keeping with the Biltmore area. Bar staff were great. Nice cocktails and had flash fried brussels sprouts and the crispy oysters both of which were terrific! It is the first time I have ever seen a fried oyster served on the half shell. Very creative. a slightly older crowd as might be expected. They have a li mites menu that covers most of the bases. This Resto is owned by the same folks that own Houston's and you will recognize a few menu items that are Houston's staples like the Hawaiian ribeye. They do not do happy hour specials but the place is very very good and we will return!"}
{"text":"We ordered about 4 sushi rolls as appetizers -- they were all amazing. I ordered the thai noodle salad which was incredible also. Our service was top notch. This place is a definite after-work favorite easily. I can't wait to try more things on the menu."}
{"text":"Houston's is a franchise.  A fine franchise.  I'm not here to talk about their food, their service, the ambience.  That's all perfect.  What I'm here to talk about is their Bloody Mary.  I

Now, I'm only talking about this Houston's Bloody Mary.  There is another Houston's in Arizona.  Do they make the same Bloody Mary?  No.  All the other food is the same, not the Bloody Mary.

The Houston's in Phoenix uses a chilled glass and fills it with this concoction consisting of top shelf vodka, fresh tomoto and olive puree.  It's so simple and so fresh.  No mix.  It's a homemade Bloody Mary.  A beautiful thing.

Even if you don't like Bloody Mary's or think having a Bloody Mary late at night is not the in thing, who the hell cares...this is the best drink Houston's makes and the best Bloody Mary probably in the entire Southwest.  Drink up.  Drink responsibly of course but drink up.

Since having Houston's Bloody Mary in January, I've been on an avid search to see if some other restaurant can one up them.  I've tried maybe 100 places since then and no one has come close.

No mix can compare either.  BTW...what to order besides the Bloody Mary...A house salad with blue cheese, French Dip Sandwich with the best French Fries on earth, and a big slice of their incredible edible Key Lime Pie.

If you're going to die, have this meal and the Bloody Mary before you do.  You'll leave this planet with a smile on your face guaranteed."}
{"text":"This place has never made a mistake when I've fined here. The service experience and atmosphere are refined, professional and inviting. I love the oversized booths in the dining area but also love the see and be seen bar. Tonight I opted for the Chicken Salad that is reminiscent of an Asian salad, featuring a peanut sauce in addition to the light vinegarette, crunchy wonton strips, corn, and other well selected add-ins. My friend has the Burger and absolutely was obsessed with it. She said the meat was the best burger she's had. Fries are shoestring. If you order a coke, they give you the old school glass bottle with a cup of ice. All fives, all around. Already looking forward to my next meal here!"}
{"text":"Was looking for a standard fine dining Steakhouse restaurant on a business trip in the Phoenix area and just searched on Google Maps for the nearest restaurant with the highest rating and this ended up to be the place.  Was not disappointed--fast, classy,  ice ambiance, great customer service. Great food despite it being very busy on a Thursday night. Thank you!"}
{"text":"I read the reviews before I went so ordered the California Roll, Thai Steak Salad and Hot Fudge Sundae (not on the menu) and was blown away with each item!  
I probably could take it down one star because the service was a little strange, but ultimately, its about the food.  I can't wait to go back and just have a steak...which I never order when I go out, but the steak in this salad was so good, I want to have the whole thing!"}

{"text":"My father was taking very important clients out for dinner during spring training. This included the president of a television sports network, tv baseball announcer, general sales manager of the baseball team and tv station, their spouses, and I. He went in personally to make the reservation two weeks before hand to ensure the restaurant staff and location was up to the standards we were seeking. He spoke to the hostess when he went in and ensured they could seat 8 people for this very important dinner. This restaurant was chosen because of our love for the Rutherford Grille in Rutherford, CA. When we arrived for our reservation at 6:00 pm we were greeted with smug remarks and were told that our party would have to be spilt because they would not and \"could not\" seat 8 adults together. They walked up with 2 hostess and directed us that we weren't sitting together. We asked why we were not sitting together and very matter of fact stated that their tables were bolted to the floor and they did not sit large parties. Embarrassed and mortified that we were allowed to make this reservation, we apologized to our clients and sat separately. After our mediocre dinner and 2 $210 bottles of wine, we all squished around one table to finish our last sips of wine. The waiter came over and yelled at us that he would call the police and fire department if we wouldn't move back. Mind you, we were not blocking any fire escapee route or being obnoxious. We just wanted to sit with the clients we weren't allowed to sit with and squeezed around them. We were told to be quiet and move back. One of the clients actually said \"I've never been yelled at by so many waitresses before!\" Finally, they allowed us to move outside where we purchased another $210 bottle of wine to share and we're placed on mismatched heights and tables, with no apologies. No discount on the bill, no dessert, nothing at all. We were treated like 8 high school drunks. Completely disrespectful and felt quite embarrassed that we gave this place our business. On an upside, we were the highlight of the teams ownership party the next night and lots of laughs were had. We will never return to this establishment and have shared our experience with many others to ensure they will not dine here either. Do not give this place your business, it's not worth it!!!"}
{"text":"What made this place great was the freindly staff.. the great ambience and terrific meal. Ahi Poke was great and really nice well made salads. The rest of the table enjoyed their meals as well. Really great staff!"}
{"text":"Here is my question.... Why are the Arichokes so hard to come by at Houstons?  Its a game now... I called today... ( Both PHX and SD ) to see if either location had my favorite app in this entire world... NOTHING... at either... in fact I have attempted to enjoy these in the last month... always either \"sold out\" or did not get them in.  WHY I ASK? WHYYYYYYYYY? 

They are so yummy... I will continure my hunt and continue to call and call and call...I will have my Chokes!"}
{"text":"I loved it. Went there to celebrate a friend's birthday and was impressed just by walking in. The ambiance was great, the little fountains and the patio area was very cool as well. 
       This is a steakhouse, the better the meal the more it's worth, so you will pay accordingly.  I had a filet and I loved every second of it, not only was is a pretty good size it was done beautifully.  The tortilla soup was even fantastic as well.   Drinks are also high quality. I had an awesome mojito.
 
      I thought the employees were on point, it was a thursday night so I wasn't expecting the A team but they were awesome. Although the place seems kinda snooty the staff was friendly and proficient. 
 
           I've been to expensive steakhouses before, not always do I get one that delivers on all fronts."}
{"text":"This is by far the best restaurant and dining experience your money can buy.  If you are looking for food, service, and consistency this is it.  Top picks; Appetizer Thai Tuna Roll sushi AMAZING!!!  The roast beef sandwich, fish sandwich, and chicken sandwich will always make you satisfied.  If you are looking for the BEST steak in town order the New York.  Really we are foodies and this is the best NY. The service is impeccable.  The staff all works together as a team so your table is clean and you have everything you need."}
{"text":"Decent food. A bit too intrusive service.  And over-priced in general.

The Ahi Tuna salad was good (quality of the tuna was great) but not really memorable.

The grilled artichokes for $12 had good flavor but very little to them (not much meat on them)..."}
{"text":"This place is my favorite restaurant hands down. The food is consistent, you cannot go wrong with a single item on this menu. The service is top notch, I always request to sit with Michael. He is attentive without being obtrusive and makes the whole experience a complete delight. If you are full at the end of your meal and don't think you can make room for dessert, find a way because the hot fudge sundae is a must."}
{"text":"I have read so many rave reviews on the veggie burger I passed up the French Dip and gave it a go. BIG DISAPPOINTMENT. Was it an off day? The patty was covered in a sweet soy sauce that overpowered the burger. It was so sweet in fact I sent it back (I hate doing that). The new burger she brought (minus said sauce) was not impressive either. There was a serious consistency issue, it crumbled with every bite. A good veggie burger should stay formed while eating.. Another drawback is that it is 12 bucks, way to pricey for what you get. I'll happily pay 16 for the French Dip, it's well worth it.

Our server was excellent and all the other options I have tried there have been great earning 4 stars. Word to the wise, if you like syrupy veggie patties that fall apart go with the veggie burger, otherwise be a carnivore and destroy the French Dip. Like I wish I would have today."}
{"text":"I eat here way too often, but they have the best service. Houston's/Hillstone is my family's go-to restaurant. Food is amazing, service is fast."}
{"text":"Hillstone is a fantastic place to grab a lunch. Not only is it pretty simple it is also delicious. The staff is great and the food is great. I would recommend going here very much!"}
{"text":"Nice room inside, and the patio outside is awesome.  Great service, too; very professional and attentive.  But the food is mediocre and overpriced.  Crab cakes ($35)  were bland; loup de mer was greasy and buried in nuts, so much that you couldn't taste the fish

I'd go back for drinks in those comfortable patio chairs, but will pass on dinner there in the future."}
{"text":"Not real sure how to rate this as a major disappointment when we went there for Christmas Eve.  Think our server was her first day as she did not even know the menu or any of the ingredients.  If you are eating healthy food probably not a good place to go as nothing is organic and mainly farm-raised fish.  It is a steak place which I did not want.  It was not upscale even though the website says they are.  If you are going to have wardrobe restrictions listed on your website at least enforce them which they don't.  Highly disappointed with the food and the service.  The servers are more attentive at Fort McDowell Casino and even Denny's.  We had to wait over 15 minutes to just get a refill on our coffee.  The food, I had the sushi and the Kale Salad very boring nothing to write home about.  They do not have many things for non-meat eaters.  Overall it was not a good experience and our server Jessica seemed afraid of our big table, but Shelly was much better even though it took way too long for refills.  I felt like cattle as they try to get everyone in and out in a short time frame and it was very disrespectful, to say the least.  I may try on a different day or even for lunch as they might not know how to do things rights on special occassions."}
{"text":"We decided to try this out and see how similar it is to Houston's (one of our favorite in the valley).  Beyond similiar - it was identical - maybe a bif of difference in decor, but the menu was identical.  

Food was very good and service was excellent as well - but it is basically the same as Houston's.  We dined there for our anniversary on 5/5/12."}
{"text":"I know this is a chain so some will always be against it.  But, I love it.  I've been going here for years.  I think the food is great....I just love it.  And I'm also very, very impressed with the service.  I think the place is very well run.  They must have 25 people working....seems like constant service when you need it.  Overall, one of my favorites."}
{"text":"Had lunch and it was excellent.  We had the Hawaiian Rib Eye and the Thai Steak Salad and they were both super.  The steak was perfectly cooked, juicy and great favor with fresh french fries.  The salad was spicy with large pieces of perfectly cooked fillet. The margaritas were tasty as was the fresh chips and guacamole.  Service was good and the atmosphere was modern and attractive.  There is a great looking patio and the bar was spacious and comfy.  I would recommend this any time for a great dining experience. PS. KeyLime was a hit with us."}
{"text":"I've visited Hillstone several times, and I've never left disappointed. The Hawaiian Rib Eye is simply the best steak in town (and perfectly priced). I've ate at many high end steak houses and none can compare to the flavor of this steak. Props to the cook and the kitchen, my steak has always been cooked to perfection."}
{"text":"I have been to The Hillstone a few times . Each time I notice only  Caucasian staff . Minus one Asian waiter & a few Hispanic cooks .  I  would love to see the place have other ethnic cultures in there . Not Just a abundance of Caucasian bartenders / waitress/ waiters / hostess . Surrounding restaurants in the Biltmore have a diverse staff . So going to Hillstone this truly stands out & not in a good way . In my humble opinion!"}
{"text":"The expression that best describes this self-important restaurant is that they read their own press releases and believe it. This is the kind of place where people who don't know congregate to make you think they do know. Pompous and pretentious, they even feel that allowing overly made-up dyed blondes to sound condescending only makes their locale upscale. No, it does not. The parking is unacceptable and there is no valet. The run-of-the-mill look of darkness and wood is there to hide the small space they allot to their diners. The menu is not exciting and they SO want you to think it is. Again, the place where people who don't know go in hopes of making one think they do. They do pour a good drink. Perhaps if you want a drink and want to people watch, this might be a choice. But with all the marvelous food and great people in Phoenix, this isn't for anyone."}
{"text":"Houston's has the best veggie burger in town! I love it with the traditional salad (sub avocado for bacon) and shoestring french fries. Try it! You won't be disappointed. The only bad thing is, there is usually a wait."}
{"text":"Excellent service and the quality of food is one of the best in the Biltmore area.
I highly recommend it. Price is very reasonable"}
{"text":"We arrived early before the lunch crowd so we didn't have to wait for a table.. this place gets busy at all times (make a reservation!!)

We started with Osaka Styled Press Sushi (very pretty) stacked like lasagna rather then rolled.. fresh clean flavors .. very good!

I had the #1 Ahi Tuna Burger (limited availability) served on a toasted bun with Louie sauce.. it was to big to eat while trying to have a conversation so I ate it open face with a fork and knife.. flavors were on point .. the tuna was flaky and cooked just right..  carb lovers will enjoy the bun.. French fries on the side..

My coworker swears by the French dip sandwich which also looked amazing ..

Service was great.. our server checked on us several times and brought refills before we needed them.. perfect place for a business lunch.. I'll be back to try some of the other items on the menu."}
{"text":"SO--I have had the same problem at Bandera and have asked and the server explained that the supplier didn't have enough.  Don't know about this, probably got left off the order or they didn't order enough.  Or maybe the supplier didn't get their delivery from CA before they delivered to the restaurant.  But I think I'll use your system next time and call first.  Glad to hear I'm not the only one on the short side.  Misery loves company!"}
{"text":"How have I not reviewed this place yet?!

So sweetly dark and romantic.  Gorgeous menu.  Beautiful plating.  The staff is dressed so you feel like you are in a *very expensive* restaurant.  The wine is delicious - I don't care what you drink.  The bar is pleasant to sit in.  The company of other diners is welcomed, not annoying.

I have eaten so many things here - both off of my own plate as well as the plates of my co-diners - and it is all exquisite.

I'm not joking - if you are in town for ONE SOLITARY NIGHT... eat at Hillstone.

The koi pond, the salad, the fries in their cute little carrier, the kitchen staff, the booths...

Mmmmm.

Six stars.  Seriously."}
{"text":"Over the years I have been to Hillstone/Houston's over 200 times and I can easily say that everything is out of this world. The spinach and artichoke dip, cheeseburger, ribs, fish, french dip, hawaiin steak, the apple cobbler dessert...all amazing....They do everything right here and all for a great price. I never decline an opportunity to go to Hillstone. Did I mention they have a sushi menu? Be sure to get the coconut shrimp roll. It has sauce on the tray that it comes with but be sure to ask for extra!
I always imagine if they were to have a brunch/brekafast menu, what it would be like. I think I would cry of happiness if they ever did."}
{"text":"The artichoke was delicious.
The rotisserie chicken was average.
The fried chicken sandwich was not good.
Our server was snooty.
I'm discovering that to be the case in many restaurants these days. If you don't order alcohol the servers just hate you! Why? Because they give you an ounce of wine for the price of a bottle and expect you to be a fool. This runs up your bill so they'll get a bigger tip. Anyway I didn't think the restaurant was worth it ."}
{"text":"My son has been bugging us and he had this craving for Houston's ribs. I know they are really good but..... Houston's only takes reservations for four or less. Otherwise, you got to wait and wait. So what does someone do? Well we found out that Hillstone is a sister restaurant to Houston's with the same menu but they take reservations for more than 4. Yeah. 

So we walk in and it reminds me so much of Houston's. Open kitchen. Pretty wide open and dimly lit. Fairly loud but quiet enough that you can hear and talk to everyone at your table. 

We started off with the Warm Spinach & Artichoke Dip. It comes with tortilla chips, the dip and plus salsa and sour cream. The star is the spinach/Artichoke Dip. Since we had six people they gave us extra chips which I thought was great. I really love that Dip. It's so good. Just enough to wet your lips. 

So I ordered the Hawaiian which is a ribeye marinated in some special Hawaiian sauce. The ribeye was so good. Tender and moist. The marinated made it really sweet. Really enjoyed it. It comes with a fully loaded baked potato. Hugh meal and very filling but really good. Loved it. 

My wife got the barbecued baby back ribs and that's why I got the Hawaiian cause I knew I could get a taste of their famous ribs. Their ribs are fall off the bone goodness. I know fall off bones ribs are boiled but they are so good too. It comes with coleslaws and fries but my wife switched the fires for a kale salad. Like I said she loved the ribs and so did my son and daughter. Hahaha. They got what they were craving. Rib goodness. 

So we always have to get the dessert. It's always a must. They only had a few choices and it's not on the menu. Our server had to explain their dessert menu. We got the walnut Apple cobbler. This was so good. Nice and warm apple cobbler with walnuts and a scoop of vanilla ice cream. Not too sweet but dessert goodness. We shared and everyone loved it. 

The service was pretty good. Our server was really busy but tried to stay on top of us. We had to ask a few times for water refills but she was good and helpful. 

So I would say a nice ambiance, great food, good service and of course they take reservations for parties of 6. So if you have a big party and want Houston's, go to Hillstone. Just as good. Consistently good just as Houston's. So we enjoyed. We will be back again. Hope you do too."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, Awesome service, Great place but it can be pricey $$$. I Love that everything is so fresh! Including drinks I had one or two martinis and every ten min they would change my martini glass so it would never get warm always chill and fresh !"}
{"text":"Excellent food great staff incredible incredible food must try the prime rib if I can eat there every night I would"}
{"text":"Consistently great food and service. Went for lunch yesterday. Ordered the peel and eat shrimp (which came out 10 minutes late and got comp'd) and the sashimi tuna salad- sooooo good. And if you are in the mood for a buzz, they make the BEST cosmopolitan. Really strong and really good."}
{"text":"Over-rated for sure.  Food was average at best, atmosphere was descent.  Definitely not worth the price.  So much better food and value in the area."}
{"text":"We went for a weeknight dinner and loved the place. Started off with the hot spinach dip-amazing! Then had the grouper fish sandwich, it was beyond good. It was a perfect mix of slaw, fish & pickles. Could not stop eating it!  Hubby had the French dip & devoured it! We ended the night with the brownie sundae with toasted hazelnuts...so yummy! Great service & atmosphere, we will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Houston's, you're a national chain.  Please tell your staff at this location that you are not a three star Michelin restaurant."}
{"text":"My in-laws took my husband and I here for lunch one day.  At first it was a little intimidating.  The place looks high end - stone, wood, water, fire elements all represented in one way or another.  The service is excellent.  The waiters/waitresses know the menu extremely well and are very helpful/attentive.  My in-laws ordered the smoked salmon for an appetizer.  It comes with toast points and a fresh sauce that complements the fish extremely well.  I ordered the steak thai salad and everyone else ordered the center cut filet.  I can't speak for everyone else.  However, my steak thai salad was an extremely generous portion.  The steak was buried inside the rest of the salad like a surprise.  It was cooked to what I would say was medium and was very tender and juicy.  Definitely the best steak that I have ever had.  The salad had a bit of spice kick to it - be aware of that if you order it.  There were slices of avocado, mango, and tomato in it as well - a nice blend of creamy, citrus, and sweetness.  The prices aren't too ridiculous for the type of place that it is.  My salad was $17 and the center cut filets were $33 from what I can remember.  I would highly suggest trying this place out if you are up for some delicious steak!"}
{"text":"Eat here. Great food. Great service. Loved the ambiance. Enjoyed the smoked salmon appetizer thingy, and the Thai steak salad thingy was phenomenal. I will return sooner than later..."}
{"text":"If you want ambiance this is the place to go.    The food is ok.  Sure they take their own spin on sushi but I really wish they served a great spicy tuna roll without the jicama.     Was it worth $14?    No.      Our steak was nicely prepared and cooked but for $39 I would have like to know if it was grass fed, humanely raises, locally sourced or even aged.   I'm not sure it qualifies as premium beef.   

The crispy oysters was creative and the capers where tangy.   My son liked them.   

The service was friendly and attentive.   

Menu is limited"}
{"text":"Hillstone = Houston's in a new swanky setting. 

You can walk inside through the awesome patio complete with a fireplace and heaters. Even though it was freezing outside, I think the patio was actually warmer than the restaurant. 

My mom and I sat at the bar. I was happy to see the Hillstone menu is pretty much the exact same as the Houston's menu except they now have sushi. And if that isn't crazy enough, the salmon roll my mom had was actually amazing!

I had the veggie burger, like I did pretty much every other time I've been to Houston's. Don't get me wrong, I am a carnivore, but the veggie burger is so inexplicably good, I usually end up ordering it. I was also happy to see they still have the Thai noodle salad on the menu. Get it with steak and you will be happy."}
{"text":"I was introduced to this restaurant about two years ago.

I've tried the following:

Hand-cut French Fries (excellent, great dipping sauce)
Baked Idaho Potato (plain, bland, but not dry)
Thai Steak & Noodle Salad (a personal favorite, very flavorful, has mango pieces)
Biltmore Chicken Sandwich (a classy version of the McDonald's version, good flavor)
Rotisserie Chicken (very moist chicken, falls off the bone, good flavor)
Barbecue Pork Ribs (disappointing, would rather go to bbq joint down street)
Roasted Prime Rib (excellent cut, well sized, with horseradish and au jus)
Center-cut Filet (very god, albeit a little plain)
Osaka Pressed Sushi (best dish in the restaurant)

It gets busy for dinner, usually Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays. Even if you have reservations, expect a 10-20 minute wait...on a good night! They still take walk-ins on busy nights, but those waits range from 30-60 minutes. 

Very classy, but not in a stuffy sort of way. I wouldn't show up in shorts to this place, but I've seen people show up in t-shirts before. Most men wear button down shirts, and the only people who get away with shorts are the older gentleman wearing Tommy Bahama that sit at the bar. 

Dressing well seems to get you seated faster if you're a walk-in. 

The food is decent, not great by any means. The Osaka Sushi alone is worth the trip. Nothing else on the menu is really of note, but nothing is bad either. They do everything well, but aren't great at anything. They are one of the few places that serves decent prime rib in Phoenix. 

Overall, a highly recommended restaurant for their ambiance and consistency in great service and decent food."}
{"text":"From what I understand this was taking the place of \"Houston's\"..not!!! Pricey, ambiance was very nice but just not my cup of tea.  They didn't have the steak I use to order from Houston's..not a fan but that's just me"}
{"text":"Very poor customer service. I tried to make a reservation for 7 people at 5 p.m. on a Sunday. I was told their biggest table seats 6 and they could separate the party into a table for three and a table for four, but they couldn't guarantee we would be together. How ridiculous. I told them to cancel the reservation and I don't intend on going back there again."}
{"text":"What a great spot! Have been several times since moving to the valley and will be back.

Not cheap, so if you're looking to save some money not the best choice, but the food is AMAZING!"}
{"text":"I craved french fries, not sweet potato fries (I've had plenty of those recently). I quick search of yelp didn't really turn up anything definitive, so I turned to my kids, who suggested Houston's. I was leaning toward AZ 88's waffle fries (which I still want . . . ).

Houston's fries are very, very thin and crispy; not overtly seasoned, but not especially potato-y tasting. The were good-enough and satisfying; I prefer a thicker potato.

To accompany the fries, I ordered the veggie bean burger. This is an excellent burger and if I had not tasted the Fez bean burger, I would rate this very highly. This burger also is stuffed with veggies and grains, in addition to beans,  and lacks the rich bean taste that the Fez bean burger has. It was a good choice, just not the best bean burger in town.

Service at Houston's is always exceptional. The server tolerated our jokes extremely well and dished out a few of her own. My kids enjoyed their meals too - a bit more than me."}
{"text":"I am a creature of habit at Hillstone. I always sit at the bar and order their cheeseburger with a side of their coleslaw. Their cheeseburger is consistently good and served on the perfect egg bun. I normally am not a fan of coleslaw, but theirs is phenomenal! It has a hint of cinnamon or similar spice in it that gives it a distinct twist."}
{"text":"Amazing food. I had the Thai steak salad and I've had the burger. Both are delicious. The spinach dip is also great. Service is amazing and the staff is so friendly. They messed up my burger and definitely made up for the mistake that I didn't even mind at all. Great location too."}
{"text":"As soon as I walked in this place, I knew it was a Houston's-owned restaurant. And that's not a bad thing. I have been to a number of these establishments going back to 1987 when I frequented the Houston's in Silver Spring, MD. The food is always great but they have the habit of taking the best items off of the menu, like the Santa Fe Chicken dish. I was dining at the Houston's in Scottsdale about a year ago and lo & behold, it was on their menu. Amazing. The Houston's locations in Pasadena and Irvine don't have it so....what gives?  Regardless, Hillstone's is worth visiting for some really good eats!"}
{"text":"Great place for Date Night; I had the prime rib with a salad and my wife had the chicken with salad... food was great and the service is excellent."}
{"text":"All things seem SWEET!

We love this place.  We go 3-4 times per month mostly on Fridays for happy hour with full food served as well.  Prefer to sit in bar booth.  We get better service there.  No frosty martini refresher in bar though.

Sushi Press is favorite.  When they are \"out\" we are sad.

The thing is, after eating there so often, we notice almost everything is SWEET.  We love Hawiian Ribeye (sweet), all the salads, except perhaps blue cheese wedge (can't seem to get a dressing that is not sweet), ribs (sweet), sauces seem sweet in all ways.  Like the bread basket and straight up martinis.  They are not sweet:)

Love the ambiance!

We've taken our little boy with no problems ever.

Will keep going back!"}
{"text":"I wish I could rate the food but not tonight.  I loved Houston's but I'm not sold on the new Hillstone.  After sitting at what used to be an open seating table at the bar, I was passed by at least 6 different employees without as much as a smile let alone a greeting.  Finally after 15 minutes one of the exceptionally rude waitresses came by to kick me out of my seat.  Customer service was terrible so i left.  I felt no need to try the food for fear of more terrible service.  I would have to say that most people didn't go to the old Houston's for the beautiful building.  I hope the staff loses the attitude and remembers that customers matter."}
{"text":"I am very lucky. I have a family member employed by Hillstone Restaurant Group, so I get to eat at Houston's fairly often (several times per year). We are very pleased with the food and service every time we go to Houston's, both the Phoenix and Scottsdale locations. 

The spinach dip appetizer is tasty. The accompanying sour cream and salsa are good mix-ins for the dip. 

Houston's serves meat from Allen Brothers and it has to be the best steak I have had. I definitely tasted a difference in their filet after they switched to Allen Brothers. The filet went from a 4.5 stars to 5 stars! Always cooked perfectly, very tender and great flavor. I'm never sorry that I get it every time! Traditional salad is always a good add-on... great combo of big chunks of juicy ripe tomato, bacon crumbles, crisp lettuce with delicious cheese toast on the side. Sides vary - I usually get one of the multiple variations of the seasonal vegetables. Roasted winter vegetables, roasted corn and the brussels sprouts are particularly good. 

Now I can't leave Houston's without at least a few bites of the hot fudge sundae. The hot fudge is thick and delicious. No sundae anywhere can compare. In the fall, the Harvest cheesecake (made with butternut squash) is a must have. 

Service is always top notch. Wait staff are very knowledgeable, attentive without being overly present."}
{"text":"This place is legit.  The lines are long but you can eat at the bar.  I had the ribs and they were great.  Service and atmosphere are both top notch."}
{"text":"Is my love for Houstons waning?! A much anticipated visit to the Phoenix \"Houston's\" turned out to be a disappointment. Hillstone is the parent company as well as a number of other restaurants such as Bandera (Chicago), Rutherford Grill (Napa Valley), and Woodmont Grill (Bethesda, MD). I once had an aspiration to visit every Houston's but am now reconsidering. Unfortunately, the Phoenix visit is where this reconsideration started. 

We went in for an early weekday lunch. Our server was polite but acted like he was being forced to be nice...fake enthusiasm with a lot of teeth showing.  His enthusiasm didn't translate to familiarity with the menu. He told me that the kale chicken salad was like the regular chicken salad - somewhat accurate but much less helpful than explaining the differences to me when I told him that I had eaten the chicken salad many times. NOT the same in volume nor flavor.

And I have more general angst against Hillstone/Houstons:
- Rarely offer open table or other reservation system
- No more off the menu classics but stil a limited number of menu selections
- Wine selections have become more pedestrian over the years 

C'mon Hillstone...step up!"}
{"text":"This is by far the best menu, food, service, and atmosphere, at a modern american restaurant. It comes from the developers behind Houstons and Banderas and is an upscale option for salads, sandwiches, steaks, fish and ribs.  Upscale but it won't break your bank...without wine a typical meal is around $75 inc tip. 

The food here is top notch. When artichokes are in season, they are on the MUST ORDER list--wood fired and juicy with an amazing remoulade dipping sauce. Another great option for an appetizer is the coconut shrimp sushi roll. Unusual and mouthwatering!

For entrees I I highly recommend the French Dip which is the best I've tried anywhere, the salmon (it comes medium rare so make sure to specify if you like it cooked more), and the ribs which are fall-off-the-bone wonderfulness!!!! 

You must get dessert at least once--you may think I'm crazy for suggesting something as simple as the hot fudge sundae. But you will leave with a newfound respect for the simple sundae after trying a sundae at Hillstone.

All in all, there is no finer dining choice than Hillstone."}
{"text":"Mediocre and overpriced. 

There's nothing \"New\" about their \"New American\" menu and underwhelmed is the most positive spin I can place on the entire experience. 

It's a very limited menu with 15 dollar sandwiches and salads, or 25-30 dollar cuts of meat.  Way to cater to the vegetarians out there with a veggie burger or an overpriced \"entree\" of seasonal vegetables. Do restaurants have any idea how boring it is to eat a veggie burger every time you go out? Get a little creative for christsake, it's not like you're lacking possible ingredient combinations.

I had the ahi tuna burger, which was ground down to a mealy consistency and cooked until bone dry.  It was then garnished with grody, unimaginative toppings like pickles and iceburg lettuce. Top it off with a cloying sweet remoulade that did nothing to moisten the sandwich and you've got a bone dry tonsil scraper. The roasted chicken was on the greasy side but well seasoned. The couscous it came with was a misstep though. Someone threw a ton of whole mint leaves into it that made it inedible instead of \"fresh,\" which I'm sure was the intention. The spinach dip was teensy tiny for the price, and why the heck is it served with canned, crappy salsa and sour cream on the side? Weird.

The fries were the one saving grace. Skin on, super slim shoestring cut with the perfect amount of salt. But I've had fried and battered bulls balls and they've tasted good. Fry anything and it'll improve the edibility. 

Service was nearly nonexistant, although as a whole the etiquette was top notch when it was present. But it was a complete disconnect when compared to the cruddy food being slung. You're serving a French dip sandwich, not some wild Top Chef creation. Dial back on the smug.

I don't ever see a need to return to a place that serves traditional (nothing new about it!) American food I can make better in my own home. I expect more from professional chefs than chicken sandwiches and steaks.

Yawn."}
{"text":"Always great. Courtney is awesome behind the bar. All the service has been amazing. The food is awesome and consistent. My kids love the Koi fish pond. Definitely classy and a little pricy but its worth is. One of my favorite spots in phoenix. Great atmosphere. Great wines and craft beers. Love the lup de mer and the grouper sandwhich. My kids crush the veggie burger and the salads are more than on point. Always a great time at hillstone and I feel like a professional baseball player just being there. Go to hillstone, leave happy."}
{"text":"My new favorite place!!!!! Everything we have tried has been awesome.  The smoked salmon, artichokes, kale salad, swordfish, burger, tomato soup & on & on."}
{"text":"Went with a party of 8 and 2 kids for a total of 10. We sat at two tables across from each other. There were some things that were awesome and some that were total fails. Here we go:
Awesome
Rotisserie chicken
Baked artichoke
Broccoli
Loaded baked potato
Cesar salad
Fries
Strawberry shortcake

Lacking
Cheeseburger
California roll
Fish sandwich
Ahi tuna poke
Kale salad

Our waitress was really good! She managed getting our food out at the same time and other food out faster for the little ones. They have a policy that a chair needs to be under the seat that attaches to the table for kids. No one there has a child because if they did they would get rid of the stupid rule. This makes sense for an infant but for a toddler standing on the chair underneath is extremely dangerous because then the child can fall out! Come on people!"}
{"text":"Hillstone Restaurant is definitely something special, from the beautiful outdoor scenery to the perfect arranged seating.  My mother and I came here for brunch on a Saturday and we were seated right away.  We had a couples seat next to the bar that overlooked camelback.  The atmosphere was amazing, it felt so welcoming and relaxing that I wish I could come at least 4 times a week.  My mother absolutely loves the mimosas here and the old fashion I had was superb!! 

My mother ordered their kale salad which she orders probably everytime she comes here, and since this was my first time I ordered the burger (I forget which one specifically) however I must say it was the best damn burger I've had in a very long time.  

I will most definitely come here again it's such a great place, our waiter was awesome and never really left down time between drinks and our food.  He consistently checked up on us which is fantastic.

I will tell everyone I know to check this place out!"}
{"text":"Smoked salmon appetizer -- enough for a meal!!  Don't forget to order the roasted artichokes that aren't on the menu that are only there when in season...  shhhhh.  :)  They make a fantastic rainbow roll with ginger inside, it's amazing!  I could eat here at least three times a week.  YUM!!  Say hi to Tom and Al behind the bar..."}
{"text":"The best rotisserie chicken I've ever tasted. The best swordfish I have ever tasted. The chicken was incredibly juicy, the swordfish perfectly flakey. Get dressed up, the atmosphere is elegant with a massive patio that seamlessly melds into the dinning room. Bravo!"}
{"text":"Great go to place at the Biltmore. The quality and service is always right on. I have never had food at Hillstone that I didn't love. Now, they don't publish their contents and calories of their dishes so I may be loving some heavy caloric meals, but it is worth those calories. Houston's turned Hillstone has been a great change in atmosphere as well. From a dark ordinary layout to an open architecturally stunning restaurant. 

Must haves: 
Artichoke App
Filet Mignon
Any Salad
Fish Sandwich
Cobbler
Kettle One Martini up with Blue Cheese Olives! (Have at least 2)

There is usually a wait of some sort, but they have an awesome patio for those nice Arizona nights. 

I have never been let down by Hillstone and that is why it will always be our place at the Biltmore."}
{"text":"All of the restaurants are excellent:  Houston's, Bandera, Rutherford Grill (Napa), and Los Altos Grill.  Service has been excellent every time.  All the food is excellent, however make sure you get the Tortilla Soup if available.  The ribs, french dip, and hot fudge sundae are great too."}
{"text":"Buttermilk Chicken Sandwich!!! This place is amazing! Service is excellent and the roasted artichoke appetizer was delicious. I wish the parking lot wasn't so crazy."}
{"text":"My absolute favorite veggie burger is at Hillstone! I also love the sushi, the thai roll is excellent. I always sit at the bar, and I highly recommend the margarita. Fresh squeezed fruit juices and good tequila - goes down real easy. The staff are always on their game, always professional and truly like getting to know you."}
{"text":"Really don't get this menu... it's out of the early 90s and definitely for old people... nothing for me here..super over priced and out dated. Extremely basic...sorry not sorry."}
{"text":"Hillstone is a long time favorite! I normally eat the ribs but I had the fish sandwich today with my girl and the kids and it was Awesome! Definitely try the Spinach Artichoke dip and ask for extra chips."}
{"text":"This is the perfect spot if you're looking an intimate date or a Girls Night Out or a celebration dinner or a family gathering. Basically any time. Try the veggie burger -- it's my favorite burger in the entire valley. Oh and the Greyhound! I could wax poetic about this drink, but won't. Instead, I'll just tell you that ordering just one guarantees a happy ending to any night. And yes, feel free to interpret that any way you want."}
{"text":"We went here because it was the only decent place we could find open after the Suns game. Fresh fish sandwich was delicious, as well as the shoestring fries. Great service, nice vibe, I'd go back."}
{"text":"Seriously? As a typically huge fan of Hillstone across the US, this location jumps the shark more often than it should. Cold night in Phoenix. Hour wait for a table. No problem. Party of 5 sit at the patio for drinks and relax before dinner. Patio heaters make it nice but the patio is maybe 20% full since it's cold. Manager says we can't have 5 chairs at our table. Huh? Has us move our chair back to the neighboring table - which remains unused, along with 20 others, the rest of the night (it's after 8pm). What idiot thought up this policy? It's not a fire or safety risk. It's a patio with tons of room. Believe it or not, we'll still come here often as we have faith that they'll pull their head out and get back to a high standard of hospitality. But be warned, this location can require some patience if you expect the Hillstone standard."}
{"text":"The food here is phenomenal! A little pricey, but if you want to splurge a little and have a romantic dinner you should go. Try the ribs or the tuna. Sooo good!"}
{"text":"I felt the need to sign up for Yelp just to write this review for Hillstone. In the hokey world of Phoenix / Scottsdale Arizona it was refreshing to walk into a restaurant and not feel like you were in a scene from \"Hey Dude\". The food albeit nothing surprising was great. The service staff may have beem a bit too friendly for a person used to the Big City, but it was welcoming. All in all enjoyable visit."}
{"text":"This is the third occasion I have been here, and it never disappoints!

To start, I love the setting. Food aside, the architecture of this place is pretty remarkable in and of itself. It had a Frank Lloyd Wright/new age feel, very classy and swanky!

Service has always been attentive and quick. 

On our most recent visit, my fiance went with the New York Strip paired with a baked potato while I went with the seared Ahi tuna and avocado & cilantro salad. I had bites of each and everything from the steak to the tuna to the baked potato was outstanding. The steak had a sweet and savory seasoned sear, the tuna was refreshingly good, and baked potato was filled with chives and grated cheese. The one drawback was the amount of salt on the skin of the potato. Coming from a salt-lover, I will say, it was a bit much and could certainly be a turn-off for those who dislike salty foods.  

Come here for a special occasion, romantic date, or just because. Regardless of the reason, I've consistently found this place to be spot-on."}
{"text":"I really like their wine selection. While it's not very large, they have great wines that aren't usually found at AZ spots. My favorite is the Darioush Cabernet. I sat on the patio. The sushi menu is awesome. I had them make a special roll for me. Avocado only. It was superb. Service is excellent and the heaters and fire pit kept me warm."}
{"text":"Love this place! We usually home here for lunch with friends while in the Biltmore neighborhood or after a fun day of shopping :). Their kale salad is AMAZING!!! Chicken, finely shredded kale, cashews, toasted coconut....OMG I know it may sound a little odd but it is so good that I order the same thing every time. When I'm eating it I don't want it to end. Please don't ever take it away!  Their roasted chicken entree is also amazing. We always order the same things because we crave it.  Nice atmosphere, a brighter more modern version of Houstons with the same great staff, service, and consistently great food. Parking can get busy during peak hours."}
{"text":"Really good French Dip sandwich!!  Asked for some horseradish and they asked \"regular or strong\" asked for the strong...meh..was ok, nothing special. But...the sandwich was  awesome!!"}
{"text":"This place is great. Casual yet refined, low key buzz atmosphere, and perhaps one of the sexiest buildings in PHX. 

That being said, the foods good too. 
My favorites the Hawaiian ribeye, roasted Brussels sprouts, kale and cashew salad, rosemary focaccia, Thai steak and noodle salad, the artichoke dip. And no, I didn't have all if that in one meal! :)

Good bar, wine list too!  

Add a staff with excellent  service, and you've got yourself a fantastic evening!"}
{"text":"One our favorite dinning places around the country!! we go wherever hillstone is located! 
The prices and the services are consistent no matter which one you go to. 
Beware this place can get crowded at anytime"}
{"text":"Amazing sushi!!. Incredible service.  ambience is also outstanding with unique outdoor seating.  Highly recommend"}
{"text":"I had a $20 club sandwich at the Ritz Carlton in D.C. 

I had a $30 lobster roll at Mary's Fish Camp in Manhattan.

And this weekend I had a $19 French Dip in Phoenix.

All of them worth every penny. The French Dip was pure perfection, served piled high on warm, soft bread which soaked up the horseradish cream and au jus served on the side. And served with some of my favorite fries. Skinny and salty. Much like myself so I've been told.

Critics pan the limited menu. Boo to you. I'm so OVER Cheesecake Factory style menus. They scare me. I will say if they claim to be New American, I don't get that. It's American. Steak house style. 

And the decor! I could TOTALLY move in and not change a thing! The sandstone. The masculine wood panels and burgundy booths. And I love the photography, specifically the entire wall of swimming pool photos. 

Hillstone. Good move!"}
{"text":"Visited on a return trip to Phoenix.  I found the food and service to be excellent. It was spoiled by an incredibly rude hostess named Carol. She ignored my wife and I for several minutes while in conversation with a gentleman. No eye contact. No \"excuse me\".  The employee is a poor representative of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Most important...patio weather = patio sitting.  Hillstone has a great patio, even if I did have to stalk someone for their table when they left.  Lovely wine and the best, best, best spinach dip I have had in a while.  So good we ordered a second one!  The foccacia bread didn't look like much when it came but it was delish.  Super staff, delicious food and drink, and a comfy patio.  So fun:-)"}
{"text":"I give the food 3 stars and the service/ambiance 5 stars so 4 is average. For such an upscale joint I was not over blown away by the food its was just average in my opinion. Had the oysters, focaccia, a sushi roll, ribs, chicken, NY strip, key lime pie, and hot fudge sundae. Chicken was dry for being rotisserie cooked. Ribs were pretty sweet tasting but the meat was really good. Mashed potatoes were tasty as was the red meat. Broccoli had some lemon juice and salt on it which made for a great combo. Staff is super professional and prompt with refills and orders. It's a nice place to bring a significant other. Good drink menu."}
{"text":"One of our favorite spots.  We have never been disappointed with the quality of the food or the service.   Fantastic restaurant.   Best things on the menu ate the Thai steak and noodle salad,  the Hawaiian ribeye, prime rib, sundae,  and the spinach artichoke dip.  They recently brought back threw pork chop.  It was also fantastic...just like I remembered it.  Can't go wrong at Hillstone.  Only reason is not a five star rating is the menu isn't very creative."}
{"text":"Loved the food, the service, and the owners. The only reason they didn't get 5 stars is because of the noise.  We are sure to return to this wonderful gen of a place."}
{"text":"This is a personal favorite spot of mine. The food is consistently great. Try the Thai Steak Salad. The bar is a terrific place to grab lunch when you're by yourself. . Plus it's a great place for a business lunch or a dinner date."}
{"text":"Wow!  I love Hillstone!  Came here on a Saturday night and we made sure we had a reservation.  It was packed!  Even with the reservation, we waited 20 minutes.  I did not care.  I know what the food is like.  It's worth it.

We had the salmon appetizer.  Outstanding!  I had the salmon entree for dinner, and it was excellent as well. My fiance had the Caesar salad.  Oh. My. God.  That salad was one of the best Caesars we had ever had.  I wish that I had ordered one, but I was getting full.  He had it with the fried oysters.  Not really my thing, but he loved it.  I must eat that Caesar salad again!  Mine will be without fried oysters.  :-)

For dessert I ordered the ice cream sundae.  It looked interesting to me.  I saw someone else with it, and it had a good sized gravy boat of hot fudge.  I wanted to try it.  I like ice cream, but it is not my \"ride or die\" as they say.  This one might be.  Homemade vanilla ice cream, and chocolate syrup/fudge with the richest whipped cream I have ever eaten.  My first bite was incredible.  I could not believe that it tasted so good.  I was completely blown away by it.  If all ice cream tasted like that then I get it.

Great night!  Great food.  I wish it was closer to Gilbert.  I cannot wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This just in: Houstons is on steroids! Yup, it's true. 

If you're familiar with Houston's you're familiar with Hillstone. But, Hillstone is better in my opinion. Why? 

-Wonderful outside \"first come first served\" patio seating with fireplaces 
-Indoor/Outdoor space for the bar area 
-A sushi bar (and shockingly really good sushi. We had the mango salmon roll - delicious). 
-No need to worry about Valet... lots of parking. 
-Great service.

What hasn't changed is the menu and the crowd. Still your 40+ real estate suits - or should I say jeans + a blazer - and all the cougary women that come along with these men... Not knocking it, simply the truth.

Overall, a great place for a good American meal, people watching or to take your parents. This isn't a place you'll be racing to take your friends who just came into town... it's a chain restaurant. There are way too many locally owned gems in the Valley to spend too much time here."}
{"text":"Houston's is one of my faves---which I cannot believe I am admitting. Who admits to loving a franchise?? BUT...best burger around! (Since Welcome Diner, RIP) I will gladly pay $13 any day for your cheeseburger. Bonus points for a tasty veggie burger, too, as that is a rare feat for a restaurant to serve. 
And, so nice to experience courteous, polite-to-a-fault wait staff."}
{"text":"Just took a Client to lunch and we had the best service.  The food was absolutely amazing! We ordered the focaccia, grilled artichoke, spinach dip, French Dip, Salmon and some Sushi rolls! We left fat and happy and cannot wait to go back and eat again. Everyone that works there is so lovely and sweet! Thank you so much!"}
{"text":"OMG!!! This place is amazing! It was my first time here and I just loved the food. It is a little pricey, but not too bad for what you get. My coworkers and I started off with the salmon and artichoke. I tried artichoke before, but I was not a fan so I was a little hesitant to try it again, but I am so glad I did. Their artichoke was so good and the salmon was even better. MMMMMM...goodness! Then I had the Hawaiian Rib-eye with Fries. My meal was wonderful and I practically ate it all. My boss had the Barbecue Pork Ribs and the meat was like falling off the bones. It was ultra good!"}
{"text":"Although it leans on the pricey side of Phoenix cuisine, Houston's is by far one of my favorite places to go out for a nice dinner. Their veggie burger is beyond amazing (I always get the couscous on the side which is also delicious).

On a recent trip, my boyfriend ordered the ribs on a recommendation. He said they were by far the best ribs he has ever enjoyed."}
{"text":"This is my very first review ever, and Hillstone's definitely earned it!  

I sat at the bar, the ambiance was amazing,  best of all my server/bar tender couldn't have been nicer! I ordered the tuna sashimi salad, it was delicious! The tuna was so fresh, it melts in your mouth, yum!  

If you want an amazing dinner, and an amazing ambiance, then head to Hillstone you will not regret it :)"}
{"text":"Dining at Hillstone is a mouth watering experience!  Food, atmosphere and help are top notch.  We started with the artichoke appetizer, smokey and charred to perfection.  I then had the ahi tuna burger with tabouli on the side.  Ahi seasoning right on and the sandwich had lettuce tomato onion and the green pickle was a nice touch.  Sauce on the bun was a nice addition.  I will definitely go back to this culinary hot spot."}
{"text":"My favorite place to eat.  Food consistently fresh and perfectly cooked.  Outstanding wine list at remarkably low prices (only complaint is quality of stemware).  Service exceptional.  Ambiance amazing.  Food prices very reasonable.  If you want a can't miss meal, this is the place."}
{"text":"While traveling thru the area I stopped here and ate dinner  a few days ago with my college student son   The food was really good.  Son had the burger combo, and I ate the french dip.  We ordered the fire roasted artichoke and it was to die for.  It was so good, i'm now googling the heck out of fire herb roasted artichoke to make my own.  My son told me the artichoke was the best veggie he's eaten and he's a picky eater.  My beer was served very cold, the service was great.  Their menu is sort of basic and not foo foo.....; salads, burgers, steaks, etc. They seem to put a lot of care and quality into each dish.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Houston's is consistent.  The burger always tastes like the burger it was when I was in high school.  It is one of my favorites in town.  The french fries are the crispiest I have ever had, they are shoestring.  Not many people do shoestring anymore, probably b/c they'll clog all your arteries in one serving.

One thing I don't like about Houston's is that they do no accept reservations with 5 or more people-- that is lame.

We had to wait for a table for awhile but we sat out on the patio and enjoyed beverages, so that was nice.  It wasn't so hot yet that it didn't feel like torture. But it will be torture next weekend. 

Another meal I always enjoy is the rotisserie chicken and the vegetable plate.  I wish I could prepare a vegetable plate like that at home b/c then maybe I would eat more veggies. 

Service is always good.  The dark atmosphere is very relaxing as well."}
{"text":"My boyfriend took me here for my birthday. It was my 3rd or 4th time, but his first. 
He ordered the coconut shrimp sushi and we decided to share the huge ribeye steak. The sushi was not only delicious, but was presented beautifully! 
We both like our steak medium rare, but it came out bloody rare. We told our server and it was sent back. We got another one which was cooked perfectly. 
The service is great as is the atmosphere. 
My guy now wants to go back all the time!"}
{"text":"The restaurant is beautiful and the food is delicious. I ordered the French Dip sandwich and it was juicy and cooked perfectly. I also got the spicy tuna rolls and they were big in size and tasted really good. For dessert, we got the tres leche cake and it was the best dessert I've ever had!"}
{"text":"Im a big fan of houstons so when i moved to the biltmore, i knew this was going to be new \"place\". Everyone always talks this place up so maybe i had an off night but the food, service and overall experience was so so. 

I'm a big steak fan - could eat it every night. Again, i hear about their steaks all the time. I ordered a filet and fet it was a cheap one from the store?? Grizzle on it and just lacked taste. And it was in the price range of mastros and ruth's cris. 

Service lacked a bit and just didnt seem like they were on their A game. Again, every visit and experience cant be perfect. We are human. Just wasnt impressed with a $100+ dinner for two."}
{"text":"I have driven past Hillstone a million times but have never eaten there.....why? They are too expensive and they are a chain restaurant. Let's be honest.... I can get the same type of food at many nearby (local) restaurants  for less, so I typically do. I have been to Houston's many times and enjoyed it, but, again, the price point (and location) keeps it from my regular rotation. I ended up eating at Hillstone with my father and grandmother one day for lunch.  We all split the french dip, the crispy chicken sandwich, fries, the cashew, kale, and chicken salad and some spinach artichoke dip (we definitely ordered too much). The food was actually very tasty and the portions were large. The spinach dip was sort of a waste, I wouldn't order that again. The chicken sandwich was decent. The salad was awesome, very flavorful and satisfying for a salad. The real star, though, was the french dip. I don't even like french dips, and I loved this one. The fries, of course, are crispy and delightful (like Houston's). If you have extra money to burn, this isn't a bad place to spend it, I just can't imagine myself regularly buying a 20$ sandwich."}
{"text":"I didn't grow up with too many chain restaurants as a child, I was very fortunate because of this...But at the same time, when we (meaning my family and I) did find one that was decent enough to continue to give our dollars to, we'd become loyal customers. 

I've seriously been going to this restaurant location for as far back as I can remember. And I've never had a \"bad\" experience. Yes some things could have been better, like a waiter not asking me how the food was when I haven't even taken my first bite. Or the waitress that couldn't remember to refill my glass without me waving her down. Its all good in the hood because the food is still good, and the service is never mediocre, and the atmosphere keeps me happy and comfortable. 

Today, was a quick and tasty lunch. Surprisingly, I didn't get the 'hasn't been on the menu since G-d knows when' Flying Chicken Platter, which I don't ever not get. But ordered the Cheeseburger ($12) instead. Leave me alone, we're in a recession! The shoestring fries are something you truly can't not try while you're here. No dessert today, us church ladies had other plans for that slot in our stomachs and fat cells. 

I'll be back in a few weeks guys..."}
{"text":"We were told it was 45 min wait an 1 1/2 hr later we were told 30 min more then the hostess yelled and  berated us for not having a reservation ruined our  evening never got to eat. To hot to be left on the patio just tell us it's a 2 hr wait."}
{"text":"Never been a huge Houston's guy. It's too dark, the menu is too limited, and while the food is good it somehow always fails to live up to the hype. Not bad, but not memorable, either.

From what I understand, Hillstone is an amped-up Houston's, like a luxury badge on a Marriot hotel. Yawn. 

I tell you all this because heading into my first visit to Hillstone tonight I had zero expectations. None. Well, other than expecting to be underwhelmed.

Shame on me, because Hillstone hit a home run.

A beautifully appointed, thoughtfully designed, approachably classy  indoor/outdoor dining venue, Hillstone offers the same dressed-down menu of a Houston's, but in a nicer setting with truly elite service.

Kaitlyn, our server, was attentive and exactly the right level of chipper. She was pleasing to both my 7-year-old niece as well as my 65-year-old mother. That's no easy feat. The burger was perfect, the beverages were never empty, the table was cleared on time, the check was dropped off and picked up seamlessly and the staff was always around but never a nuisance. 

And I love the setting. From the bar to the bathrooms everything just works. There are romantic corner booths and more lively center room talbes and the patio is gorgeous, with a perfect view of bustling Camelback Road. 

Whether it's a business meeting or a first date, Hillstone will definitely get my repeat business."}
{"text":"I was very happy to see that Hillstone is not much different than Houston's. I had been wanting to try this place since I have been watching it being built!

The actual building is really cool. Great outdoor seating area but you cannot order dinner outside.

I had the veggie burger, and it was the best veggie burger I have ever had. 

I would've given this review 5 stars if our total time at the restaurant was not over 3 hours - it gets very crowded on Saturday nights."}
{"text":"IF THERE WAS A ZERO THAT WOULD BE TOO MUCH RIGHT NOW!!!  This star used to be at the 5 mark especially due to their salads, BBQ, and French Dip!!!!  Here's the story!
  
  To give a little background about myself it is that I am married to my husband who is 70 and I around the 40 mark.  We are opposites in sight....He is buttoned up shirt and shorts and I am full sleeved tattoos and am more of a t-shirt kinda guy (The t-shirt in question is a cartoonish glow in the dark skeletal outline)  Don't get me wrong I do dress up well when the occasion calls for it.
  
  On July 26, 2015 at approximately 1 p.m., my spouse and I had run errands, met with people and went home, showered and put on our CLEAN weekend work clothes.  We decided we wanted a good salad and the first place that popped into my head was Hillstone.  We get to the entrance door which was propped open by I am assuming the last patrons who had exited the building.  We walk in and close the door behind us.  We are greeted by a sweet smiling you woman all in black and asks how many; we say \"Two please\".  She says \"Right this way\".  We follow her up a slightly slanted ramp to a dead end and take a right to a standard table for four.  She places down the menus on the table and my spouse begins to sit.  As I pick my chair which was the one where my back would face the window and begin to pull it out to sit, the lady in black says \"Do you have a different shirt with you?\"  OKAY this pissed me off!  I turned around and shooed my hands towards the table in a \"whatever\" type of motion and walked out mumbling things I don't wish to repeat past 3 occupied tables, pushing the door open and realizing how embarrassing that was.  I understand if there is a dress policy (Which we did not see anywhere and later are told it apparently is on one of the doors as we entered, perhaps the one we had to pull shut.  If we were told I had \"inappropriate\" attire on when we walked in the door at the beginning I would not be so disappointed, hurt and embarrassed. On Yelp it states that the dress is \"Casual\" which could mean many a thing.  I am sure professional musicians who have stepped in the doors of this establishment have not even been questioned about the dress code.  

  I felt I was misrepresented as a client.  The worst thing you can do is make a person feel so inferior for the most trivial reasons and think it can just be categorized under an \"oops\" moment.  I am not one to play the \"gay\" card; however, I do feel that tattoos and the appearance of someone based on their tattoos is a different card altogether.....No!  It is a different GAME altogether!  I usually let things slide off and carry on with my day, but this was humiliating.  I don't care what people think of me, but I sure as hell do care about other people like me who have the same type of situations happen to them.  

For being overpriced the food WAS wonderful!  I would take clients as well as family, friends and my attorney here to eat on occasion.  I think its time to look around for less judgmental companies to accept my hard earned money."}
{"text":"Having eaten here many times, I feel that I should write a review.

Part of the group that owns Houston's and Bandera, Hillstone is a wonderful place to dine (as are the others).

When the weather is accommodating, go to the patio because the chairs are comfy, service is great and a decent amount of food is available.

If you want to partake of their full menu, you will have to eat inside. Lovely ambience; perfect romantic lighting, excellent service and the food is always perfect (I have dined there over ten times in the past year or so).  They have one of the best wine lists around, and hte servers know how to advise.  Everything on the menu, from sushi to steaks, is always prepared just right.  They have a kale and cashew salad which is out of this world!

The bar scene is always lively, and Al is one of the best bartenders around!

They have TONS of parking too!"}
{"text":"I got a $100 gift card to Houston's restaurant for Christmas.  I decided to save it for mine and my boyfriend's 7th anniversary in February.  The friend who gave me the gift card recommended I go the the restaurant in 26th Street and Camelback, rather than th one in Scottsdale, which I live next to.  Houston's and HIllstone are the same company, they just name their restaurants different things.  Anyway, my friend recommended the one on Camelback, so we went there.

My guy and I arrived around 6:30-ish, and we had to wait about 30 minutes for a table.  When they called our name, we went inside, and the place was packed to the gills and it was NOISY.  Like, techno-dance club noisy.  We had to raise our voices pretty high as we leaned towards each other over the table to discuss what we were going to order.  We gave up on conversation at that point.

There's not a whole lot on the menu, and it's really straight-forward.  IF you look on the Hillstone restaurant website, you can browse the menu before you go.  

We both ordered the same thing: the hawaiian rib-eye that came with the side of loaded baked potato, both of us ordered a caesar salad, and I ordered us a plate of the grilled artichokes as an appetizer. 

The artichoke came out before the salad, which was weird, but no big deal.  And, the artichoke was heaven on a plate!  Seriously, I could have made a meal out of those things alone.  I think there was olive oil drizzled over them before they were grilled, and then then I'm not sure what seasonings they used, but there was definitely sea salt sprinkled over them before they were brought out.  They aren't on the menu, which is surprising considering how many of them we saw being delivered. 

My only concern was: how to properly and politely eat it in a nice restaurant.  Rather than look ill-mannered, I simply asked our server how to politely partake of this dish, and she laughed and said there wasn't really a polite way, ya just gotta use your fingers and dig in.  I can get behind that! So, I thanked her and we happily dug in, and it was just delicious.

The caesar salads were also delicious, and the dressing was unlike any caesar I'd had before.  Most caesare dressings tend to be more cream-based, or at least have a creamy texture, while this one seemed more oil-based, and wasn't really creamy at all.  But, it was still good, and I'd order it again. 

Our entrees came out after that, and the baked potate was really big and covered with sour cream, grated white cheddar cheese, chives, and real pieces of chopped up bacon. 

The steak was a nice sized.  We ordered them done medium, and I think they were a bit more medium-rare, but that's a chance you take at steakhouses.  Everyone has different ideas of what rare, medium and well mean.  But, my boyfriend likes his steaks pretty pink, and I like mine REALLY pink, we we were both fine with it. There wasn't a description of what \"hawaiian\" meant, but usually it means a sweeter flavor.  I'm not big on sweet flavors combined with meats, so...it was a little off-putting when the steak had a sweeter flavor, but it was still really good.  I'm not a big rib-eye fan, as I prefer leaner cuts like sirloin and filet mignon, but this one was pretty good.  The baked potato was definitely generous sized, but there was no butter on it, and the cheddar cheese and the bacon pieces really overpowered the flavor of everything else, plus no butter meant that the inside of the potato was dry.  However this is easily remedied: next time, I'll tell them to hold the cheese and bacon, and ask for some butter.  Problem easily solved.

All in all, the only issues I had were small ones that weren't really a big deal.  The staff was very efficient and courteous.  

Prices: the grilled artichokes: $11, Rib-eye entree: $28, salads: $4, soft drinks: about $3, I think.  Altogether, with tip, the bill came to about $110 for two people.  And, for some reason, when you order soft drinks, they bring them to you in a glass bottle, with a glass of ice.  Never seen that before in a restaurant, especially not a more upscale one like this.

Bottom line? I'll be back.  Terrific service, terrific food, but be prepared for a long wait time for a table.  And due to the noise level, and crowd, DON'T go if you're trying to have a nice, quiet, romantic evening with someone special."}
{"text":"Hillstone was everything and more. It was my first time visiting Phoenix and wasn't sure on where to have dinner. I found this restaurant on Yelp and all the reviews were great so I decided to try it and I'm glad I did. The atmosphere was perfect. low lighting, a chic crowd and a very nice outdoor patio area. Our waiter Brent was amazing!!! My husband and I tried his recommendations both on dinner and wine. We both had the salmon dinner. It was delicious. I ordered a dirty martini that came in a cold frosted martini glass, halfway through when Brent saw my glass not as cold, he brought me out ANOTHER frosted glass and poured my drink in it. OMG! I was impressed. Great customer service. Both my husband and I are still talking about our experience at Hillstone a week later. LOL! We Will definitely visit them again when we go back to Phoenix."}
{"text":"Kinda bummed we decided to come here to celebrate my boyfriends birthday. I made a reservation for 730 and we weren't sat until almost 750. Our server was very sweet, but almost non existent. My boyfriend ordered the filet (which is his favorite in all of Arizona) and I ordered the salmon. Although the filet was seasoned so perfectly, the salmon was bland and fishy. A few times throughout our dining experience here, our water was empty. Unpleasant experience when you spend $93 on dinner. I most likely won't be back."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Quick service, great atmosphere, pleasant servers.  The French Dip is money!!  The Ahi was tasty and the Salmon was cooked perfect.  Yummy fries too.  So much deliciousness going on with their menu."}
{"text":"Awesome everyday every time! Staff is awesome. Mouthwatering. You can order anything and it's going to be awesome."}
{"text":"living in san francisco, it's really easy to be chain averse...

but when you're away from san francisco, i say, embrace the good stuff!

Houston's is one of the \"good stuff\". i'm not a huge meat eater, but i will never say no to their barbequed pork ribs. no gimmicks or frills, they deliver well-marinated, well-portioned, well-serviced ribs -- and other food for that matter. the ambiance is comfortable, and the service was super sweet with a cherry on top. 

when you're away from home, it's nice to know what you'll be getting is that familiar friendly food."}
{"text":"I was terribly upset with this restaurant. Their prices are absurd for the casual dining experience which made their disinterest in pleasing their customers even more inexcusable. They serve a Caesar salad which is served as a whole leaf. I do not enjoy cutting it up at the table with lettuce sliding off the plate and messing the table area. I requested as I ordered it that it be cut before serving it. They refused saying it doesn't look as good. When I said that i didn't mind if the presentation was compromised and I would enjoy it more cut up. They again said no. They were too busy. Additionally they took some old standbys off the menu. High prices and no regard for customer satisfaction is a bad combination."}
{"text":"Hillstone always does it right.  Every time we go in(1-3 per month) is an excellent experience.  Usually a wait so cocktails at the bar will do just fine. On Occasion we will bring our 15 year old son.  He loves to stand by the open view kitchen and watch the chefs work.  Great move by management by surprising him with a side of fries while we wait.   

Service from start to finish is always on point.  Hawaiian Rib-Eye, Prime Rib and the Spinach dip are my favorite."}
{"text":"Today is one my best friends birthday. Service was horrible. The staff made us wait over an hour an a half just to be seated. Even though she  made reservations. I will not be coming back."}
{"text":"At 8:15pm. ...out of prime rib. ..no prime rib french dip. . .out if the chicken sandwich. . Out of the specials. . . Service slow. . .explained our disappointment and got fake apologies.  Really disappounting."}
{"text":"Enjoyed lunch here recently, was there early and by 11:45 the place was packed. Food was great, especially the tortilla soup that they serve on Thursdays.  A bit pricey for lunch ($40 tab for 2) but well worth it.  They have an outdoor patio as well.  I would highly recommend this place and definitely will be back.  Good location right in front of Embassy Suites on Camelback."}
{"text":"Best ribs ($30) that I've had in Phoenix thus far, hands down. It's even better than Bobby Q's (much less fat on the Hillstone ones). The french fries and coleslaw that come with it are of equal quality and bursting with flavor.  Loooooove!"}
{"text":"Hillstone where did it all go wrong?  Just had lunch and from the parking, the unfinished patio where I can only order apps and what can only be described as the worst sushi second only to the bulk garbage at the supermarket..the experience is a total let down..some one told me the name is a result of the fact if you have more that 20 restaurants with the same name you have to add calorie info. Houston's has 20+  so why not just change 1 or 2 to the awesome, roll off the tongue Hillstone. .Back to the sushi...enough with the sesame seeds ok I want to taste the fish! The rolls were down right gross..and the price...really I don't think so..Stick with the burgers, steak and side and I sure you will be satisfied..
ps..Your sushi stinks get rid of it"}
{"text":"Fridays are our date night and I must say I was extremely happy with our choice of restaurant. Houston's at the Esplanade has been a favorite of ours for years, but last night confirmed our feelings once again. After being told that the wait would be 15 minutes, we decided to go out to the patio and order our drinks. Less than 5 minutes later we were seated at our table. Impressive already! Our appetizers were wonderful! I didn't like artichoke until last night! Total Yum! My husband had the usual, the Pork Ribs and loved them.  As for me, I had the Grilled Halibut and couldn't be happier! The freshness and quality of my dish was to die for! I love Houston's!"}
{"text":"Two hamburgers, two beers, one artichoke appetizer.   $92 including tip.  Food  and service is good but not worth an almost 100 buck dinner in my opinion."}
{"text":"Decided to go to Hillstone after a recommendation from a friend. Read reviews and heard complaints about customer service and decided to form my own opinion. Was served by Cary who was phenomenal. I got the Hawaiian ribeye and it was cooked and marinated to perfection. Cary was very attentive, courteous, and pleasant. Would highly recommend requesting her for excellent service. Tres leches was for dessert - never had it before but first impression was a good one. Key lime pie was also good!"}
{"text":"BAD SERVICE & COLD FOOD

For the past 3 years Hillstone Camelback has been our go to for New Years Eve dinner. Service and food has always been outstanding. 

Had reservations for this evening. When the food arrived my food was cold and order was incorrect. I informed our server and it took about 10-15 minutes to get the side I was missing. 

We decided to order a dessert to go. We waited an additional 20 minutes to receive our dessert. After waiting for so long I had to get up and speak to a manager. Our dessert was removed from the bill, but it would have been nice to be informed that the kitchen was running behind rather than just sitting there with no communication from our server. 

My husband and I left pretty disappointed. Please improve! We really loved this place."}
{"text":"See Houston's. Blows area comp away. Pricey but pkg. burgers are some of the best. Hope you open your seafood concept or other concepts very soon!"}
{"text":"I have to say, wow how bad can you get.  Yes the building is pretty, but everything else is of the poorest quality.  The staff is inattentive, the food greatly over priced and poorer than fast food quality.  We ordered a \"Classic\" California roll and were very surprised that is was not in fact a California roll (enough lemon flavored mayo to choke a horse).  Our entrée which consisted of two salads took over half an hour to arrive, and seriously could have gotten larger fresher salads for half the price at Wendy's.  I ordered the Chicken Club salad, the mixed greens were wilted, the chicken sparse and mostly batter, two small cubes of avocado, and the bacon was leathery not crunchy.  My wifes salad had rotisserie chicken that was hastily pulled from the chicken and included connective tissue, fat and congealed blood.  While waiting for and eating our meal we observed two tables beside us have at least three employees stop by to chat for more than ten minutes at a time.  After our meal we sat and waited for 15 minutes for our server to come by with our check and then another 10 before we could flag down what looked like a manager to take our money.  It took another 10 minutes to get our change.  It was nice however to have the tip amounts printed on the receipt so that we knew what not to give.  I really liked Houston's the few times I was there, Hillstone I will not be returning to."}
{"text":"Steak was really good and recommend the chicken sandwich to try. Also had coconut shrimp sushi and wow is all I have to say. I would go back in a heart beat."}
{"text":"Nice place to grab a business  lunch or meet friends after  work. The interior meshes old dark wood steakhouse with more modern glass and art.  Kitchen and prep area are front and  center.  Nice patio area away from the front door. Staff is usually attentive.  

The food is always great. Foccocia and smoked salmon appetizers can make my meal any day, especially nice when it's  hot outside.  Grilled artichoke is also available when in season. The Thai  steak and noodle salad is fantastic, perfect combination of sweet (mango) and savory.  The French dip is wonderful and perfectly sharable, especially after indulging in too many appetizer selections. 

Desserts are always good!  I rarely  have room. Their sundae is my go to when I can cyrb my love for the salmon appetizer."}
{"text":"We were lucky we found Hillstone. We were shopping at the Biltmore and wanted to eat dinner nearby. Hillstone is just a short drive East on Camelback from the mall. 

We were greeted by our hostess who asked us how we were doing. Well, it was a hard day as we had to say goodbye to our family cat that morning. Our evening at Hillstone was the perfect salve to soothe our sorrows.

The ambiance is dark wood and dim lighting. Though the expansive dining room was nearly full, it was quiet enough for us to talk in a low voice. Even the nearby open kitchen was barely audible. 

We settled into our most comfortable booth for a splendid meal. We were not famished so we ordered light. My wife had the California roll and tabbouleh salad; both were delicious with an unusual sauce on the rolls. I had one of the best fish sandwiches ever. The perfectly breaded fish was cooked to perfection. It was served with a flavorful sauce that harmoniously melded with the fish. I ordered a side of perfectly cooked and spiced fries. It was all too much food as I suggested the fish could be served sans bun but with the fries; just call it fish and chips. It was simply delicious.

The hot fudge sundae and cappuccino were our desserts. Again, perfectly prepared and delicious. 

The ambiance and food were only surpassed by the outstanding service. The attentive waitstaff were genuinely service oriented. Our waitress Katie even comped our dessert after hearing about our cat. Now that is how you give a great first impression. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"It should be a sin this place is so close to my work. It's seriously going to break my bank one of these days but OMG can I say YUM?!

The first time I went to Houston's was with a girlfriend of mine who told me that I had to try the French Dip. It was perfect. Housemade bread, thin slices of the moistest beef. The shoestring fries on the side were ah-mazing as well. We splurged and dipped them in the Housemade Buttermilk Garlic dressing. If you're going to enjoy good food, do it up right.

The next time I went was a few weeks later with my boyfriend. The servers are always hopping and your glass isn't left empty. Those servers can move. It's almost a show to watch. Anyways cutting to the chase. My boyfriend ordered the French Dip and I ordered their Cheeseburger. So moist, so delicious. I can say it's one of the best burgers I've ever had. I had to tap on the table a few times to get my boyfriends attention as his head was in his plate nearly the entire time. \"Hello dude! I'm here too!\"

Two thumbs up to Houston's."}
{"text":"Great ambience.  Awesome patio.  The food is greatly overpriced, in my opinion.  But if you are looking for a casual, upscale place for dinner with friends, give it a shot.  The atmosphere is ideal."}
{"text":"This place is unreal. 

I am actually in awe of how incredible the food and the service is at this place. 

The Ribs and the California Burger in particular are tasty. I've had thousands upon thousands of burgers in my life time and this is definitely in my top 25 I've ever had. 

I also almost never had an empty glass of water which was impressive to say the least. 

The cocktails are great and the wine selection is vast as well. 

At the end of the day, eating at Hillstone made me feel fancy and important. I will eat here as much as my financial situation will allow me to.

BB's Rating: CLASSTASTIC"}
{"text":"We love this restaurant.  But we always wind up ordering the same thing, the French dip sandwich and the grouper sandwich with the fabulous slaw.   We have tried other things on the menu but these two are show-stoppers.  We also enjoy the atmosphere and the servers are professional and friendly."}
{"text":"Classy atmosphere. My Hawaiian Ribeye was cooked perfectly and the marinade complimented the steak very well. I tried the coleslaw as my side. Unique and creamy variation, loved it. Would absolutely get this dish again. Our sever Alison was polite and timely."}
{"text":"Ohh this place was delicious.  I ordered the Hawaiin ribeye and it melted in my mouth and the flavor just exploded!  I loved it!  The baked potato was piled high and I could probably eat that steak over and over again.  Their california roll was very tasty - assuming it must have been real crab - with a \"c\"!  We also ordered the salmon and mango roll which wasn't all that great, but definitely edible.  The wait for a Friday night around 8 pm was about 15-20 minutes which was not bad at all.

Service was impeccable.  Very attentive and different people catering to our needs which was nice.  Drinks were always refilled in a timely manner and they checked on us just enough to make it not seem obnoxious.  I will definitely come back here again and try other menu items."}
{"text":"Hillstone.....yes, there's one where I live, but my friends and I have made it an annual dinner place when we're in town for Spring Training.  Why?

The food....awesome.

The service....awesome.

The ambiance....awesome.

During our last visit I ordered the Hawaiian Rib Eye and baked potato.....yummy.  Let's just say, my friend who rarely eats meat had a slice to try it and didn't stop talking about that one piece that she had. The rib eye was juicy with a hint of teriyaki flavor.

Every time I've come here, I've ordered the Hot Fudge Sundae because of the hot fudge that you get to pour yourself and the best part- candied pecans on top!

See you sometime soon again when I'm back in Phoenix...."}
{"text":"When dining at Hillstone, it is a must to have the Spinach and Artichoke Dip along with the Prime Rib French Dip Sandwich. 

These two items are the standard in dining compared to other restaurants whether it be for lunch or dinner. The Prime Rib French Dip Sandwich is always filled with a generous amount of thinly sliced Prime Rib and the Baguette is crispy and firm. Don't forget to use the fresh and warm Au Jous to dip your sandwich.

The Spinach and Artichoke Dip is top notch and comes with chips, salsa and Sour cream. If you run out of chips, ask for more, the awesome staff will gladly bring more.

As far as the staff is concerned, they are top notch, every time we have been there and this goes back to at least 20 years when this location was Houstons, we have always been served by top notch waitress and waiters along with the entire staff.

The Burgers and Chicken Fingers appetizer are also a favorite of ours, it is just difficult to pass up the Prime Rib French Dip Sandwich. 

Will definitely be back again"}
{"text":"Best French dip ever. Server was excellent.  French fries hot and fresh.  Very nice atmosphere. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"This was formerly Houston's in the Esplanade. In the past 23 years they have been open, my wife & I have dined there at least 2,500 times! You may think that number is ridiculous, but do the math: 2 times/week X 52 weeks X 23 years = 2,392 AND a lot of weeks we are there 3 or more times, so 2,500 is a conservative #.

Not only do they have a great variety on the menu, but it is ALWAYS consistent & delicious! As if those are not reason alone to go back time & time again, the service is the BEST we have received anywhere. The staff go out of their way to make every experience a great one. Sometimes we go just for tortilla soup & toast & they still serve you as if the ticket were $200. 

If you haven't tried this place, you are truly missing a great experience........one of the finest dining establishments in the Valley! Great food, at a reasonable price & the BEST service you will ever get anywhere! Tell them Russ & Tracy sent you!"}
{"text":"One of our favorite restaurants in Phoenix. Just finished an incredible dinner with our kids. Hillstone nails it every time. Around the table we had the Osaka pressed sushi and Coconut Shrimp roll for a starter, the campfire ribs (out of this world), Famous French Dips, and wrapped up dinner sharing a strawberry shortcake and fudge sundae. My son said the ribs were the best he has ever had, I would have to agree with him. Service was top notch as usual. Recalling back to the last 6-8 times we have visited Hillstone they have been right on time with the reservations. My only complaint is that we live about 35 miles away."}
{"text":"I love everything about this place. The atmosphere is so inviting and I'm always a sucker for any twinkle lights and candles. The patio is beautiful and plan on making my way there once it cools down. I've been to this location twice and the food has always been outstanding. Some of the BEST spinach dip ever and this place has one of my top 5 burgers. The shoestring fries that accompany it are delicious! Last trip we splurged after I read about the hot fudge sundae. OMG. I'm still thinking about it!! Great place for date night. Excellent service. Great food. Can think of zero negatives! Well...maybe that I can't afford to go every night!"}
{"text":"I have been so lazy for a year or so that I haven't made time to rate a good ol' 5 stars to any great experiences I've had out and about.  Hillstone moved me out of my lazy state and to the laptop for a moment. 

I have passed by about 100 times always wondering what was inside and finally ventured in on Saturday night.  

The place was absolutely amazing/gorgeous/well-designed from top to bottom.  Purely impressive.  

Service was spectacular.  It's nice to see a restaurant in AZ actually care about service, appearance of staff, and delivery.  Well executed. 

Food couldn't have been any more spot on.  I had the chance the have THE BEST ARTICHOKE i've ever had in my life as a \"special\" app of the night.  Wow!  
I also had the chance to try their Hawaiian Rib-Eye complete with a loaded baked potato and also their Thai Steak and Noodle Salad which was very tasty.  

Easy 5 stars.  Fantastic."}
{"text":"Our last couple servers have been warmer and more professional than that earlier clown, but I cant let go of a lingering disdain for this place - even though they're good at what they do. It's just that what they do doesnt really appeal to me anymore. 

Part of it is the smaller portion/higher prices slam that others have noted. When Houston's opened in a town without much quality going on, little on the menu was over $10. It was a godsend. Then that excellence was understandably incorporated into the pricing structure, but it was still a decent value for a terrific, consistent kitchen, in a culinary burg getting its legs. But now there's half a dozen places within a bike ride of this joint that serve up larger portions of comparable or near comparable quality, far more reasonably.  Oh, I get that you're paying for ambience, but that's the other thing I'm not wild about. 

This is a place that relatively insecure foodies take companions they're trying to impress, by sitting in a nice room and shelling out some dough. Whether it's your boss or client or prom date, you probably wont go too wrong here. The food will be good to excellent,  there will be at least a veneer of fine service. People will say it was lovely at the end of the meal, and in the event that they dont, it wont be your fault. 

It's also the sort of place where everyone looks you over. The maitre d, the other customers. Hillstone attracts that sort of moneyed voyeur, compared to dimly lit, almost semi private Houston's. Now there's a see and be seen element in the dining area that used to be confined to the bar.  It's just me. I get this is a formula for success.  See Scottsdale.  But for me, there are more reasonable nearby places providing quality grub and atmosphere, whether it's Postinos, The Parlor, Sierra Bonita or Hana, or even more spartan spaces like Seekong By Night.  They're all good and fun in their own way. Hillstone is just good. There's no fun in it for me. As a stodgy Phoenician, I feel inexorably ripped off and just dont wanna be around many of these people."}
{"text":"I went to Hillstone with my parents last weekend for lunch, my dad had made a reservation for 11:30am and we were seated right away. When we sat down we were greeted right away by someone and she said she'd be right with us. A few minutes later a different person came to the table and said they would be our server and that \"they would be taking care of us\" we placed our drink order with her. A few moments after that we had another server change and a different person came over to deliver the drinks and said that she \"would be our server and would be taking care of us\" so we placed our meal order with her. Then the FOURTH person came to our table and introduced himself and said that \"he would be our server and that he would be taking care of us\" we asked why we had four server changes in the first 10 minutes of sitting down and he said that it had to do with when he was scheduled to come on and that we were seated in his section. Now I actually used to work at Houston's in San Francisco on the Embarcadero, which is owned by the same restaurant group, and I'm pretty familiar with what is considered spec, and four different servers within 10 minutes is not how it's supposed to be done. Nevertheless the server that we did have was AWESOME. I wish I could remember his name, I think it was David? Maybe Brian? He made up for all the server changes, he was kind, attentive, and the rest of our meal everything was seamless. I had half of a my burger left and he even offered to give me a side of fries to take home which was very thoughtful. I had the other half of my burger and the fries later in the day and everything warmed up nicely and was just as delicious as when I was in the restaurant. Our server saved the experience that day at Hillstone for us. Having frequented Hillstone, Houston's and Bandera we always find the food delicious, you won't be disappointed."}
