{"text":"I used to order take out from this restaurant pretty frequently but haven't been here recently, until today. I am so sad about everything. The atmosphere is creepy. I am the only customer. The tea is served in a dirty metal tea pot. Sugar is served in an old jar with a plastic spoon. It tastes watered down and the tea cup smells like WD-40. The Chinese mustard was not as good or spicy as I have had at other restaurants. The breaking on the general tso's chicken is burned and reminds me of chicken nuggets. There are chewy bits in the chicken that I had to spit out. I asked for water - I did not get ice. The utensils look gross. There are salt and pepper shakers on the tables which are mostly empty with the exception of the rice that was added to the shakers. Very disappointing. I wish I had gone for pizza. I feel bad leaving a bad review because it seems like they are struggling but the food is not good."}
{"text":"Great food and great quick service. Best Chinese Food in Bellevue!!!"}
{"text":"We have eaten in as well as done takeout. We've always been pleased with the food. The folks are nice but usually we're about the only ones in there if we eat in. 

But the Resturant atmosphere is nice and quiet. Give it a try!"}
{"text":"Chinese food should be tasty, fresh and aromatic. Uncle Chen js bland, salty, soggy and plain nasty. Even the tea had a chemical medicinal taste. Every dish tasted as if it came right out of a can. The egg roll was greasy and the filling was mostly bland cabbage. I had better from the supermarket's fast food section. The only good thing I can say about Uncle Chen's is the Fortune Cookie was edible."}
{"text":"Uncle Chen is simply good, consistent, basic Chinese food. There's nothing flashy about it. It won't bring back memories of your recent trip the Shanghai. You won't experience a romantic atmosphere in their dining room. Really, it's just a solid Chinese restaurant with typical Chinese restaurant basics that always come out correctly prepared and tasting as expected."}
{"text":"Did not get to eat there.  Walked in at 9:05 pm.  Was told they were closing 30 minutes and only take out could be ordered.  They close at 10pm.  I was told that service wasn't good.  I agree.  Lousy and lazy.  A disappointment in true Bellevue fashion."}
{"text":"Nothing terrible to say, other than the food was just not good at all. Bad tasting Chinese food. Will not be ordering again."}
{"text":"Two words: Sodium. Bombs. And I love salt more than most people. I ordered shrimp with broccoli, which really could have been anything, heavily salted. The fried rice? Salty. Hot and sour soup was fair to middling, and the dumplings were sadly inedible. It seemed like the filling was heavy on star anise, and also very overcooked; the dough was limp and sad.

A friend says they're really good, so maybe I ordered the wrong thing. I'll give them another shot sometime, but it might be a while; prices are decent, anyway."}
{"text":"Do you enjoy Chinese food with a touch of thai?   Try Dragon Town.  They have taken our favorite dishes too a whole nother  level.  And the owner is very personable.  No matter how busy, she took the time to know her customers by name.  A must try.  Can't wait to go back."}
