{"text":"The Garage does not have great food....but it is a great place to go for a late night cocktail. When I'm not in the mood to be in a bustling bar, but just want to go somewhere for a nice conversation, this is usually my stop."}
{"text":"Favorite Saturday night hangout! Great food and happy hour drinks. Such a fun environment. They have local bands play on Saturdays. They have reverse happy hour! It's seriously a places to try out!"}
{"text":"Comfortable, cool, kinda swank but not pretentious; modern place with a retro attitude. I like it! Great dark brew right off the tap. Great place to be when its freaking 118 degrees outside. Sat next to the owner, Ted. Had no idea. A regular Joe. Fun guy, great sense of humor. Just started coming here and only had the Deviled Eggs, but I'll definitely be back for the atmosphere, the cool and the vibe. Nice job, Ted."}
{"text":"The food was really good. A little pricy though. Seemed pretty \"happy\" We probably wont recommend this place to our straight friends."}
{"text":"This was our first time here and we had a great experience! The food and service were both wonderful and the waitress was sweet to our two young children. The portions were huge and we were really impressed with the size of the children's meal we ordered. So much food for $5! We had the all American burger, spinach salad, and grilled cheese. All great! We'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"I'm in from out of town visiting family and we decided to go for a casual dinner. My aunt and I ended catching happy hour which was way worth it. We decided to go all out and ordered 3 appetizers($5 each during happy hour). We had the fries, chicken sliders and lamb kabobs. Each was delicious. As a main course we had the lamb chops. They were amazing! We also split a mojito. It was seriously one of the best. The balance of lime and mint was perfect. 
The only bad thing is I live in Chicago and can't visit more!"}
{"text":"Food...meh
Service...meh
Ambiance...meh

My husband's french frys were cold.  My cheese plate seemed as though it was prepared in the early morning and let to sit in a fridge for hours.

I would go back to people watch and drink beer, but eat elsewhere."}
{"text":"The Garage is a great new place atop what is slowly becoming my favorite intersection.  The service is fantastic, they have a few good beers on tap, and the food looks to be promising.

They also have a decent happy hour, which as I remember has $1 off tap beer and some wine specials.  What they lack is any happy hour food prices, which would definitely bring me back here often.  

We only had food once, which was a flatbread.  Pretty good although nothing to write home about.  Their menu looks promising but I would consider the food a tad too pricey.  

The atmosphere is pretty good (with the exception of the lighting in the men's room, which can kill you if you're not careful).  I think its a great place to stop in for happy hour before heading over to the Swizzle Inn to get your drink on."}
{"text":"Stopped by for just a cocktail and to check the place out.  The bartender was rude and short with us.  After three attempts of trying to figure out what she was saying, we got it!  We didn't even get a chance to look at the menu as we couldn't finish our cocktails fast enough.  There was not a very welcoming atmosphere, apparently unless you are a regular, and the \"smoking patio\" is a joke.  Because of the non-welcoming atmosphere, we won't be back."}
{"text":"Awesome little area. Was very impressed with their thai chili wings. This place is small so the service was zippy and the Bartenders were very personal. One thing I didn't like is the booth that I sat in - along with the rest of them are far way from where the live band was playing. It was high tops and a sectional seating that were in front of the band."}
{"text":"This place is the epitome of mediocrity. The food is the same quality as Applebee's. In fact, the wings and burgers at Applebee's are better. I like my ground meat well done *if you know what I mean* and they couldn't even get that right. The only saving grace is the atmosphere and the nice staff. The staff is pretty quick, even on Friday at 730pm.  The happy hour is not great if you're a beer drinker ( only $1 off ). And for some reason the whole place smells like wet pennies."}
{"text":"Great service and food! Very good atmosphere, the music is not too loud so you can actually have a conversation."}
{"text":"Met some friends for Happy Hour. I checked out the menu online ahead of time since I had never been here. Beer selection was lacking but HH food look promising. We arrived at about 6ish, place was not busy, took almost 10 min for the waitress to come get a drink order. I opted for a mixed drink which was served in the tiniest glass & missing the lime I requested. Ordered the chicken sliders - they came out pretty quick. Tasteless and buns were brushed with excessive oil or butter. I finally got the waitress' attention for another drink & ordered a flatbread. The flatbread never came! I had already given up & didn't even bother asking what happened. Our entire group could have doubled our drink orders had the waitress been available. She parked herself in front of the kitchen window or was MIA. Sorry - too many other options nearby, won't be back."}
{"text":"The nachos and cheesecake are amazing but the rest of the menu is mediocre. I ordered the chicken tenders for my son and they were far from tender; really dry and overcooked. I got the buttermilk chicken sandwich and had the same issue. The staff is friendly, the location is good but the parking lot makes it tough to get around."}
{"text":"We stopped here this afternoon for a late lunch.  The atmosphere is friendly and hip, the beer cold, and the food delicious.  My Garage Burger arrived with a heap of sweet potato fries that were more than I could possibly eat.  My wife's chicken wings were sweet/savory delicious.  The burger, which we shared, was huge, delicious, and smothered in gorgonzola cheese and bacon.  Wow.  Another wonderful restaurant in this up and coming neighborhood."}
{"text":"My wife and I went to the Garage last night, and to our surprise.
These place was GREAT!
the bacon wraped shrimp and the margarita pizza were so so good.
My wife is a cab drinker and the wine and prices were good."}
{"text":"Fantastic! My new fave! Wonderful elevated food and drinks, fantastic & friendly service! Deviled eggs were divine, street tacos were out of this world. Good place for kids, too."}
{"text":"Went to the garage and have to say was pretty disappointed. Got the Ny steak , 25 dollars , it was just ok, not too flavorful . My companion got the Garage burger for 13 bucks and it was not worth it. Basic burger. The Mac and cheese was tasteless. We were going to try the desserts but our server  brought us our check before we had finished our entrees, probably just as well. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"I have been going to the garage for about 5 years and feel that the service has really gone downhill. It feels very poorly managed. The service is slow and unfriendly at the bar, patio and inside. This has happened 3 times in the last 2 months and I will no longer spend my hard earned money on this spot."}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere but HH deals are not deals.  Still fun and worth ckg out."}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  Went here while on vacation in the Phoenix area.  Cool atmosphere, great service and tasty food.  I'd go again, if I lived anywhere close by!"}
{"text":"Went there with a couple of friends for dinner/beers on a Saturday night.  We were seated immediately, but it took 10 min for the waitress to visit our table.  After we ordered a round of beers, it was followed by another 10 min wait.  BTW, it wasn't very busy and there appeared to be plenty of wait staff.

I ordered the house burger w/mac & cheese - it was good, but I've certainly had better at several places.  The consensus on the mac and cheese (which we tried because people raved about it) was it was average compared to other restaurants.
One friend ordered bacon wrapped shrimp - she said it was good, but wasn't happy with the serving size (5 shrimp).
Another friend ordered the tuna w/ a side of mac & cheese - he said the tuna was good, but they went overboard on the soy based sauce.
We shared the deviled eggs as an appetizer - no complaints here, liked the bacon garnish.

More on the wait staff - they seemed friendly, but possibly new.  Our waitress said she didn't see us and apologized for our initial wait (so it wasn't completely her fault...the hostess should have made sure she knew we were seated).  We overheard another waitress serving the tables nearby and she couldn't answer many of the questions that customers had (which is why I assumed she was new).

Positives:  decent beer/wine selection, I liked the atmosphere (open air, bar & grill type of place)

Negatives:  bad service, mediocre food, pricey dinner entrees, kind of a boring menu

Will I go there again? - with as many restaurants as there are of this type, probably not."}
{"text":"The Garage has a beer and wine selection that is above average though not remarkable by any stretch of the imagination.  The burgers are weak, but I would recommend trying one of their salads, which are some of the best I have had in the valley.

Good job with the interior.  During the winter months, the bar area opens onto a small patio."}
{"text":"We got to the restaurant at the end of  a Friday happy hour  with 10 mature hungry men in tow.  The restaurant was crowded with large parties of \"youtts\", as Vinny would say, in a TGIF mood.  The staff was very helpful in finding us an immediate space, although  small, with a promise to move us when the crowd lessened.  We got really good service and a bigger space when it became available.
The food menu was limited but very adequate for our simple minded tastes.  The wedding soup was among the best and the meat cheese plate was fantastic. No complaints in this group means it was a really good overall experience.
The surroundings were simple, casual and fun.  I'd certainly go back for more."}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere and great service. Great wine list too! Hummus was out of this world."}
{"text":"Well Dicks Hideaway was reserved for a party so walked around the corner to the Garage and it was awesome nice little spot."}
{"text":"Same ole, same ole.  Just another hamburger/brat place.  The onion rings are vile.  I did not bring home the ones we did not eat (almost all of them) as even the birds I feed every day would not want these.  How can you make an onion ring bad?  Simple.  Prepare them like they do, hard, crunchy outside, and by the time you get thru that, little onion left.  Not again."}
{"text":"Great first time! Came to take advantage of the happy hour at a new-to-us restaurant. The vibe is one of a friendly neighborhood bar but it's so much better. The food is great (we recommend the garage fries and burger sliders) with interesting micro-brews on tap. Service by Andi was attentive and very friendly. Made great recommendations for food and drinks. Great place for a chill night out."}
{"text":"TO DIE FOR! The service was superb & the food was amazing. I enjoyed the patio while I was dining, thinking it couldn't get any better than that, until I ventured into the restroom. It has the most beautiful decor- The loo was just as clean & enviting as the rest of the shop! This is now my FAVORITE spot in that complex. I will be back VERY soon. Kudos to those who served me today & made my experience far better than I even expected."}
{"text":"This place is so cute.  To begin, it is trendy but comfortable.  The service is fantastic and the food is really good.  We were a party of six, and ordered a few appetizers (the deviled eggs were good) and for lunch, many of us did half flatbread/half salad..for a reasonable $10.  Mine was delicious.   I had a blueberry salad which was really tasty, and my margherita pizza was great.  The sun-dried tomatoes were perfect.  I will be back for sure when I'm up for drinks....a wee bit early for drinks today as we ate at 11:15."}
{"text":"I love this place. The atmosphere, the vibe, the drinks, the FOOD! All great, 'lil pricey, but worth the extra. Even their ice tea is super tasty. Try their grilled cheese, it's amazing. The flatbreads, nom, mushroom truffle is my favorite. Burgers are cooked to order and onion rings are superb. I'm a fan."}
{"text":"Alright spot, service was okay, and food was mediocre.  Probably will opt for Zipps next time across the street."}
{"text":"I stumbled on to this place by accident and was very pleased that fate brought me here. Great atmosphere, friendly staff, and totally had the feel of a neighborhood bar. Upon recommendation I tried the deviled eggs which is definitely something I have never seen at a bar before and they were great. But the real treat was the macaroni and cheese mixed with chili - WOW!!! This was total comfort food at its finest. 

I wish the tap beer was a little more extensive (especially considering the word \"tap\" is in their name) and they had some more lounge-style seating but overall I was very happy with the find."}
{"text":"Went here to cure the saturday night fun. I ordered a coke, wings, and chili. My only negative was the fact the coke came in a seperate bottle. So I wasn't sure if I had ordered another one, would I have been charge 1.50$ again? The food took a little long to come out but overall, the experience was worth it and  I will be back!"}
{"text":"I have had breakfast here once a week for 2 months and the light pancakes were a treat, but the last 2 weekend's have been disappointing. If you are going to advertise lemon ricotta pancakes than serve them.I have owned my own cafe and cutting corners and not being truthful is a business killer and will look for a different breakfast brunch destination"}
{"text":"This place was so cool on the inside! In fact, it was pretty cool on the outside too. Way too warm to even survive outside, but the back patio had a fire pit and space heaters from when it does cool down. The front patio has spacious seating and light strings drapped about. It'd be a cute Sunday evening/afternoon date place.

The inside is very rustic, dim  lighting, big posh booth with what looked like a full bar too. We sat in a cozy 2 man booth and order the caprese salad and shrimp flatbread. I loved the flarbread. The shrimp wasn't in big chunks which was nice but the feta was and so was the tomato. Bit of a switch up but I liked it. It worked. My friend really loved her salad. The tomato was cut super thick and so was the motzerella. She enjoyed the vingearette dressing too.

Prices were a tad igh for me. I wouldn't have minded paying $13 (including tax) for the flatbread had it been a little thicker or more filling. But I paid it. The service was so FAST! Our food came out in a real jiffy and the water boy was constantly refilling us. The staff seemed pretty knoweldgable about what they were serving too.

I'd go back... if I wasn't paying."}
{"text":"I want the Garage to do well. It is still a work in progress, though. Three of us visited two weeks ago. We were sat right next to a group of 40 - 55 year old ladies out for a surprise birthday. What's with that anyways. Do you really need to go to a somewhat small restaurant with your pack of \"girls,\" and occupy a large swath of the dining area? Do you need all the paraphernalia (collages, centerpieces, hats)? I was seriously waiting to see a youngish birthday girl. Nope, she was the oldest. 60, easy. Act your age. While you're at it, you are not a size six anymore. Needless to say, it was loud. At least one of the revelers apologized right when we sat. As if that's any conciliation for the volume 11 cackling. 

First off, the Garage has good brewskis. Not a huge supply, but what they have is quality. We had wings and truffle oil deviled eggs. Both were great. I had Schriner's Sausage Flat bread, and it was great. Wife had something, I forget, and said it was good. Friend had some large salad and said it was good, too. Overall, food was better than most. 

So, why the three stars you ask? Service. Why do some cool places slip up on this? Is it because they hire \"cool people\" or friends that don't really want to work? First off, a server (we were seated at the entrance/ exit to the kitchen) dropped a glass bottle of ketchup five feet from my foot. My wife and I had splatter on our jeans and glass near our sandal clad feet. Hardly a response. We were handed a rag. Our server not so sympathetically wondered, \"Oh, they almost dropped a bottle of ketchup on you.\" The rest of the night just seemed a little disorganized and not relaxing? Every server seemed in the weeds or confused. Empty beer and water glasses. Entrees arrived and empty app plates sat there. 

$60 for three for apps, dinner and beers."}
{"text":"Great service at the bar and food came out fast and tasty! Definitely a nice neighborhood stop, plus Triple Karmelit on tap... Awesome!"}
{"text":"The food is excellent for pub fare. The beer is cold and always changing so I get to try new flavors regularly. The real asset is their service. You feel like a regular the first time you go there. Even on busy nights, the staff stays and chats a bit. Every time I go in, I see the servers creating personal relationships with customers. You can get a cold beer anywhere, but this place has a warmer feel then the others."}
{"text":"Very Disappointed! 

We were really looking forward to their opening since, we live in the neighborhood and it is within walking distance. It advertised itself as a wine bar...not so much! Postinos and Bomberos are wine bars. This place is more a beer and burger joint! We ordered the garage meat and cheese plate, and when it was delivered may husband and I just looked at one another. We could not believe for the price we were being served what looked like some refrigerator leftovers. I would have been embarrassed to serve this to anyone. There was not even enough meat or cheese for one person and it was served with two little pieces of crostini. Two glasses of wine and the platter with tax was around $40. We left and went down the street to Postino's for their antipasti board...wow what a difference. Their chef needs to visit the competition and learn what is out there. To say the least we will not be returning!"}
{"text":"I liked it. The girlfriend didn't.

I had the burger. It was pretty good. The portions, though they don't look it, as told to me by my stomach, were pretty good. Bigger burger than your eyes tell you it is, and the fries come in abundance. 

Lady friend had one of the flatbread pizzas. Too much cheese, and it didn't settle in well down the road. 

Only complaint from me was that the $5 beer were not pints. They were 3/4 of a pint, maybe. This was kind of a disappointment as I really liked the beer I was drinking. 

Overall, just alright. Nothing amazing, but its a swank looking spot and the proximity to the Camelback area is handy. 

And the bathroom was really clean once I found it. I like a nice clean pisser when I drink beer."}
{"text":"We love chillin' with Kim, our favorite bar tender in Phoenix!  The garage is a very laid-back environment with just enough TV's to watch whatever sport you want!"}
{"text":"Food is awful. Wayyyy to loud there. Wait staff is horrible. It's to bad that its a block away and it sucks, because it has the potential to be amazing, but it's like they just don't really care. My aunt went on a separate occasion and she said that boss blamed my aunt and her part for the service they got that night. Ok, what? Went back again and I change my draft to one star because they're back doors don't work when there's like two spaces only in the front for parking. They made their prices skyrocket for the same disgusting food. (Honestly it's even worse now). It's just a block from home so I just keep wanting to give it the benefit of the doubt. But no more."}
{"text":"Parking is tricky. Service excellent. Food okay. Beer cold!"}
{"text":"I had the smokey BBQ wings. They were good but a little crispy. I think that is the way they are suppose to be but I just wasn't expecting that. They were good but just not what I thought. Then I had the garage burger. It was amazingly good. Love it."}
{"text":"This is a great local find. My coworkers and I eat there virtually every week. The food is great! If you are looking for a delicious burger, flat bread, or even salad, the Garage delivers. To top it off, the service is excellent. 

People may complain about the little things, but I think it is refreshing to find a great local place that isn't owned by a chain and has a little heart and soul. I have been happy with The Garage every time I have gone and it continues to be one of my favorite places to have a good casual meal. I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Their brew fries are AMAZING!! I loved the tempura battered chicken and the delicious Chipotle sauce that came with it. Their ranch is fresh and really good. The grilled cheese was OMG!!! Highly recommend. Definitely going back"}
{"text":"We went for cocktails before dinner. Nothing terribly exciting on the menu. Wine selection was decent, they did carry Layer Cake Primativo, $10 for a glass. We tried the lamb kebobs good but a little overcooked. Not a bad place just a very corporate feel. Think buffalo wild wings with a better selection."}
{"text":"This place has all the elements of a great neighborhood hangout. And I will be here hanging out occasionally for drinks. The service was awesome and the drinks were poured perfectly and delivered quickly. 
Three of us met up Friday evening for a few drinks and a little to eat. The cheese plate was OK. 
The burger my buddy ordered looked delicious, but it was ordered medium rare and it was delivered well done. We both are going to try this one again. It has the makings of a good burger, but it could have been better executed."}
{"text":"We arrived in Phoenix ten days ago, and since our first visit here, this has quickly become one of our favorite places to eat, unwind, and have some delicious food...I almost hate to admit we've been here four times already.

The bartender David is on top of everything, promptly serving drinks, and food, offering introductions between customers, and providing city info. 

This place has excellent food, ambiance and personality. My favorite neighborhood hangout."}
{"text":"I've been here several times, and always have fun.  I remember when this place really was a garage and my dad used to bring the cars here for repairs. 

The food is good, as is the service.  The patio is a great place to hang out and have a pint while your wife goes shopping at Poor Little Rich Girl next door.  (Maybe she should go shopping more often.)  Oh, and they have Stiegl Goldbräu on tap all the way from Salzburg, Austria!"}
{"text":"Your kidding right? I guess this place is cool if your drunk, but they local soup kitchen has a better menu."}
{"text":"Went for a couple late-night drinks, sat on the patio and our heat lamp kept us nice and toasty on a chilly night. Didn't try the food but we were very happy with the beer. We were there for reverse happy hour - discounted draft beers until close. My lady was thrilled to find that they have Triple Karmeliet from Belgium on tap, one of her very favorite beers that is not easy to find in the states. At least in Michigan where we're from :)

My friend and I ordered an IPA, I'm an IPA buff and really liked it. It was more on the bitter end, not very sweet. Wish I could remember the name, will edit this review if we go there again. 

Great service and overall a satisfactory experience for a couple of beers to finish off the night. The inside seemed very nice (fireplace, modern decor) and the bathrooms were very nice as well. If we're back in the area I'm sure we'll return for at least a drink."}
{"text":"I appreciate the friendly bar staff and super quick refills at this pseudo gastro pub slash sports bar.  

Both at the inside bar and front outside tables we've had lovely service from nice down to earth ladies.  I even requested an all lime margarita with no mix and was happy with her version.  She even said \"the mix hurts my stomach...\" We received quick service without that weird feeling of being watched or listened to.

I have yet to try the food but I hear they have a half baked cookie with ice cream."}
{"text":"Quick update: Stopped by the past weekend. The claypot chili wings are top notch. Some of the best wings I have ever eaten. A solid choice. 

Looks like a good addition to the Bethany Home & 16th St area. Really cool renovation of an old mechanic's shop. Slide up garage doors and fold up windows give the place a really open air feeling. 

On to the food! The menu is pretty sparse, but covers the standard pub type fare. Salads, flatbreads (pizza), wings, burgers, etc...

We had an order of deviled eggs to start the night. Yea, never seen them on a menu before either. They were good, but a bit tame. They could be spiced up a bit for my taste. For dinner, I had a bacon cheeseburger. The bun was super tasty. Brioche bread and toasted a bit. 

Beer and wine list was lengthy and reasonably priced.

I would return and would recommend."}
{"text":"The Lamb Chops &Burgers are excellent. great for happy hour"}
{"text":"The Garage was once my favorite little spot but they're starting to seem pretty basic compared to all the other creative options out there. Nonetheless, they have good food and friendly staff. I've never had to wait for a table either which is great when you're starving or on a schedule but makes me wonder why more people don't come to this place? I wish they still had lamb as a starter. That would win my heart back right away."}
{"text":"Rather than say anything negative about the food or service, I'm just going to post pics of the girls bathroom. That's it. The best part about this place is the bathroom. You decide what that says about everything else. I'll try it again sometime. Hopefully the bathroom won't be the best part."}
{"text":"Been twice, not sure I will go back. The food and drinks are ok but we have had lousy service both times. Very slow and unattentive. Sad too because I am so happy they are in the 'hood and what they've done with the space is cool and I like the patio. But damn that poor service is keeping me away."}
{"text":"This may be the first five star review I have ever given. Had a second trip to The Garage yesterday, as it is a bit of a drive for us. Delightful service and good food quality. You may be thinking that five stars is only for high-end restaurants, but The Garage really hits the mark in all ways for me. I had a chicken sandwich, husband got burger. A lot of places offer those items, but here, the quality really shines, which is why I am such a fan. Nice menu, lots of side options that all deliver. I also am a big observer of staff members in action--there is just a good vibe here, where the employees seem happy and engaged. The place is clean and comfortable and has a relaxed feel that is just right. I am sure this is done on purpose, but the ladies' restroom is as nice as someone's home. (Always a plus!) Our server mentioned the great live music, so we will be back for that, too. Keep up the good work, Garage team. I even overheard an employee answering the phone and that was done right!"}
{"text":"We love this place - the service is top notch and they have free wifi! The burgers are excellent and the steak, waffle, brew or sweet potato fries are all good. The Mac and cheese is always excellent and tends to be my go to. We were there during happy hour and hubby ordered the deviled eggs which were great - if you are not a fan of truffle oil order them without it - my son got the Lamb Kabob which per both son and hubby were chewy. My BLT was great and normally comes with an herbed aioli mayo which I asked to be replaced with regular mayo. The chef forgot but my server let him know and he sent out a new one.  My son got a grilled hot dog which looked awesome and came with tons of toppings; he ate every last bite. Stellar service in an awesome atmosphere - definitely a favorite!"}
{"text":"I dig this place for sure.  The wild mushroom and goat cheese flatbread is (in the words of Fergie Ferg) tastay tastayyyy.  They have a decent selection of beers, my favorite is the Left Hand milk stout.  As far as food goes, they have a little of everything: Deviled eggs with truffle oil for a starter, caprese salad, house made soups, flatbreads, burger, chicken sandwich, grilled cheese, steak, etc.  I have heard complaints about the service, but I have never had a bad experience here.  Kim, the bartender is super sweet, and Casey and Dillon (servers) are rad and accommodating.  Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"probably the best bloody marys i've had in phoenix! 

food is good pretending to be great.

(happy hour is 3pm-7pm)"}
{"text":"Cool little restaurant! The garage burger with waffle fries or sweet potato fries is a \"go to\" item!  Their wings are an awesome appetizer! Lots of TVs to watch sports! Recommend!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went there on Friday afternoon for a late lunch. We were looking forward to trying a restaurant that was new to our neighborhood, with outdoor seating. When we sat down, there were only 4 tables being used. We thought this would mean we wouldn't have to wait long for lunch. We were WRONG! We waited for 15 minutes to get service. It took 25 minutes for them to deliever  2 hamburgers that we paid 12.00 a piece for. The hamburgers were good. They add an additonal 3.00 for a side that, we thought was part of the meal. They didn't tell us there was an extra charge for the side.The menu has a limited selection for entrees. The service was terrrible. It was our first and last experience"}
{"text":"For years, in Central Phoenix Z'Tejas was my favorite happy hour spot.  In the last few months, maybe in the last year or so, management changed, the quality of food changed, and it's just not that much of a good time.  So, my friend and I decided to try Garage Wine and Tap for Happy Hour.  I arrived a little earlier.  I walked in during prime Happy Hour time, 5pm on a Wednesday.  There was 2 men on one side of the bar and 1 woman on the other side of the bar.  I was the 4th patron in the entire restaurant.  I waited for about 15 minutes before my friend came.  No one ate any food while I was there but everyone had a few drinks.  I ordered and enjoyed just one Rum and Coke. The bartender did great, spared no corners on the Rum.  I asked for just a splash of coke and that's exactly what I received.

Because it was so empty and boring, I told my friend to meet me someplace else.  We wanted a bit some action.  I'm going back to Garage Wine and Tap with my meetup group because it'd be perfect for a small group.  The décor is nice, small candles on the table and the bartender (although I wasn't there very long) was very attentive.  I think my group would have a nice time."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend who had been there before. My first time trying their food. I had a chopped salad which seemed like a salad I could have made at home. It was good but nothing to write home about! Might try it again. Might."}
{"text":"This place doesn't have many vegetarian options - a flat-bread pizza, a grilled cheese and a few salads.  Boring!  Even their deviled eggs come with big ol' bacon strips on it. 

I ordered the Caprese salad, which was pretty tasty and my dining companions seemed to love the chili and chicken wings.  

We got chocolate cake for dessert and it is huge, rich, and dense!  Our party of 4 couldn't finish it - so, definitely split that one!   

Our sever, Casey, was great and this old garage has a very hep, uptown ambiance to it."}
{"text":"Love their chili mac and french fries. What a great place to hang out on a Saturday night with friends!"}
{"text":"Good food, good beer: rice pudding Porter! I don't like rice pudding but the beer is good. Nice music, a quiet area, they also have a fireplace and outdoor seating. I agree the deviled eggs were very good, fries very good (I'm very picky about fries). Chicken sliders needed more pesto sauce.  

Parking very bad!"}
{"text":"Nothing special here...we saw a review on \"Check Please,\" so wanted to give it a try. We visit on a Sunday night, which was dead. The BBQ flatbread featured nice quality chicken breast, too sweet BBQ sauce, on soggy flat bread. In fact, you had to eat it with a knife and fork. We also ordered the crispy chicken stripes with brew fries (which are excellent). The chicken stripes were quality chicken, but, so dry, they needed a dipping sauce. The offer a large selection of beers on draught, but, overpriced. The wines,also, are overpriced. No wonder this restaurant was dead and \"The Vig\" across the street is packed. The food needs some help, otherwise, this is just another bar food place, not worth the price...."}
{"text":"My amigo and I stopped in here for a cocktail and an appetizer prior to traveling a little further up the road to Rokerij for a dinner with friends. Rokerij bar we knew would be too packed for what we were trying to accomplish, and we both were curious to check this place out. The vibe was great. The bartender was very friendly and just the right amount of chatty. Being a borderline hipster, I enjoyed a lot of the funky things this place had to offer. Sadly I've not gone back for round 2 & I'm trying to decide if it's because this place lacked something \"extra\" or \"special\" or if it's just not convenient for me geograhically. Nonetheless, it's a great place and next time I'm in the neighborhood I need to stop in."}
{"text":"Got off the plane from Sacramento and my buddy who picked me up at the airport suggested we stop here for a drink to catch up. What a great new addition to North Central.16th Street and Bethany Home is really turning into a hot spot with Phoenix Grille,The Vig Uptown and now Garage!

I can't review the food because we just had a couple of drinks but the bartender was very nice and the space is amazing. They've kept the big garage doors which can open to the patio in nice weather. The interior is spacious and open with a big bar and plenty of tables and booths for seating. There's even a fireplace which had a roaring fire going which was perfect for this time of year.

Definitely a great addition to this part of town!"}
{"text":"Ladies happy hour on Thursday. We arrived at the Garage around 5:30 and it was mostly empty. Bonus for us, because the 7 of us could get a table quickly.  As the evening went on, the place filled up.

Tony was our server and he was polite and attentive. Always had a smile.

Atmosphere was fun and inviting. The layout is set up to where you don't feel like you're on top of each other. Bathrooms were very clean. Patrons ranged in age from late 20's to early 40's. 

As for food, my friend and I shared the deviled eggs, Parmesan fries from the happy hour menu and chicken BBQ flat bread from the regular menu. Our food came out quick and tasted great. And based on the clean plates from the others and not one complaint, they enjoyed their food too.  There was a good variety of beverages on the Happy Hour menu, which kept us happy and our tab low.

Overall, the seven of us enjoyed our Happy Hour experience at Garage Wine and Tap. And we'll definitely be back in the near future."}
{"text":"The food is slightly above average. The perceived value is poor. $10.00 for 3 mini tacos and undercooked steak fries. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Love this converted and hip place! 
Met a friend here for \"lunch\" (We didn't eat). So I guess for \"booze lunch\", hence I can't comment on the menu. 
We sat out on the front patio. It was a nice day. Patio somewhat standard and overlooking Bethany Home Road isn't the best of scenery. The back \"patio\" was one small two seater table and reminded me of being punished. This is where people go to smoke it seems. 
The inside was clean- has a large bar and decorated quite nicely. Hip \"garage\" feel. It was empty inside. 
I had a couple glasses of wine. Service a little slow considering we were the only people there. She mainly just talked to the bartender. 
Lots of potential here! They did a nice job with the decorating and the drinks were cold and good. Decent wine list. Average prices. 
I will have to come again and feel the place out a little more and try some food."}
{"text":"Well, we went here for a friend's birthday because The Yard was overcrowded and we wanted to chill. The location is awesome, the decor is cool, & there was live music so that was a plus. I had a caprese salad which was fine. Several people got nachos which looked really good. My hubby got the grilled cheese which he said wasn't great. My real issue was the service. We were a large party & we spread out over a few tables so we had multiple servers. The service was almost nonexistent for all tables. A few times, our server was hanging at the kitchen window right next to our table with no regard for our low/empty glasses, new guests, or desire to order food. In one instance, I had to approach the service well to get another round & request the check. I'm a former bartender so I'm easy to please, but expect a little attention. Get the staff in shape and they'd have a great Saturday night spot!"}
{"text":"My husband and I had eaten here several times in the past and really enjoyed it. Unfortunately it seems that the influx of business they've received through their Groupon deals has taken a serious toll on the service and quality of food. Our last visit went from bad to worse pretty quickly. 

To start out, we decided to sit on the patio, and weren't greeted for about 10 minutes. We ordered the Claypot Chile wings as an appetizer, and waited for over 30 minutes for them to arrive! In the past, the Claypot Chile wings were one of our favorite items on the menu, but this time they were bland (almost tasted like they were coated in oil) and not nearly as crispy as we had grown to expect. The server mentioned they changed the sauce, probably to save money.

For dinner I ordered the Caprese salad with a side of Mac & Cheese, and my husband ordered a Cheeseburger. As I started digging into my mac& cheese I noticed a funky texture in my mouth, and it turned out to be a large piece of paper!! It was so large that I can hardly believe this wasn't noticed before it left the kitchen. Besides being absolutely disgusted, what shocked me the most was that the server didn't even bat an eyelash, and a manager NEVER visited our table AT ALL to apologize for the issue. 

To top it off, in order to salvage the rest of our meal I asked for some balsamic glaze from my very skimpily dressed Caprese salad and my husband asked for some ketchup, and we never received either!

 I am very disappointed in what has happened to the Garage, and will not visit again!!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious. Although I do think the flatbread is EXTRA flat & not worth $10. Everything else is good portions. Hot Tea was great. Atmosphere was chill, but yet fun.

The one thing I find weird about this place is I can't find a website or a FB fan page anywhere. It took me a while to visit this place because I could never look up a menu online. It just seems odd. Especially since social networking is so popular. It's not like this place is for an older crowd. It def attracts a younger crowd. So why wouldn't it have a FB fan page or website? Ya know? Too be honest when I see people \"liking\" new restaurants on FB, it grabs my attention & I usually add it to my list of places to try. I think the owners or Garage really need to take that into consideration. I GUARANTEE they will find their business doing a lot better if they had more than just a Yelp page. Ya know?"}
{"text":"No too bad of a place, bit a bit pricy for what you get. Atmosphere is fairly decent, but parking is terrible for that entire plaza. I probably would not go back unless I was meeting friends there that I really wanted to see. Decent selection of craft beers."}
{"text":"kind of yucky--I debated on whether to do a two or three for the Garage--The restaurant itself is great looking, very industrial--great patio space on Bethany Home.  We went for lunch about 1:30--service was fine, but it took more than 20 minutes for the food to be served and all we ordered was 2 BLT's and a flatbread--and by that time there were maybe three other tables of folks--so they weren't exactly busy.

If you are going to do BLT's you should do them well--spend a little on wonderful tomatoes and put enough bacon on them to live up to their namesake--for $8--i expected more than a strip of bacon--They also put the sandwich on brioche--which is not the right bread for a BLT--the sandwich needs a dense bread--well toasted to offset the moisture in the mayo and tomatoes--this thing was hard to eat at best.

What was really awful though were the fries--first of all the potatoes had no taste and secondly they was a VERY NEGATIVE taste of oil that had been used way too many times--

I have to say a got home after this meal and didn't feel right the rest of the day.  I can see going back to the garage for a drink at the bar--but it will not be on my list for lunch or any other meal  I think these \"mechanics\" need to go back for some more training on quality."}
{"text":"The Garage is yet another central Phoenix building reuse success story.

Much like it's neighbor, The Vig Uptown, this outstanding venue had a drastically different former life, in this case a tanning salon.

OK, actually it was a Garage, and I know this not only because of my amazing powers of deduction, but because my parents actually brought their cars here when I was a kid. I have never had the experience of having dinner and drinks at a place that I was last at when there was oil & grease on the floor, and guys in blue overalls running around.

I've had the opportunity to visit The Garage twice so far, once on a Friday for dinner, and once on a Friday for lunch. A great friend of mine lives right down the street, and he has been telling me that we needed to hit up The Garage.

On my first visit, it was very busy so we grabbed a beer and loitered until our table was ready. The service was quick and friendly, the bartender was attentive. We each got a draft beer of something, it was pretty good, but the glass wasn't frozen. (Perhaps it was cold, but after being spoiled by The Roosevelt and their iceberg cold pint glasses, it was a noticeable difference)

Ambiance wise, The Garage is beautiful. I would have never imagined you could take a working mechanics garage and convert it into an upscale sleek neighborhood bar and grill. Unlike corporate ventures, The Garage keeps is simple, and clutter free. That's not to say there isn't character and charm, because the place is really impressive, it's just not overdone. One of the things that will catch your eye is the super cool huge propeller that occupies the East wall of The Garage. In addition, there are little mechanic related items scattered around the restaurant which pay homage to the building's former life. Seating is comfortable and plentiful, and The Garage gets massive points for creating a comfortable seating plan without placing too many tables and cramming people in (Ruth's Chris anyone?).

Our table came ready and we were seated and greeted by a server named Casey. Casey was friendly and knowledgeable and made some helpful recommendations. We each ordered a burger, and they offer several different sides, but being a simple guy, I went with waffle fries.

The food arrived a short time later, and the burger was truly outstanding. Casey came back around to check us, and he was clearly pleased that we enjoyed the food. It really is a cool thing when employees take pride in what they do, and where they work, and The Garage is one of those places.

Apologies for the wordiness of this review, but it really is worthy of praise and attention. Great food meets wonderful service, with the added charm of a tremendous venue. Prices were good and the crowd seemed really nice, with an eclectic mix of patrons. 

Great job Garage, I look forward to many visits, every three months, or 3,000 miles- which ever comes first- and unlike regular garages, I will trust you when you say \"Try the deviled eggs\" and won't think you're selling me a part that isn't broken, or I don't need."}
{"text":"Here for happy hour. Tried a couple pale ales and appetizers: lamb kabobs and chicken sliders. Nothing special, but good food. 
Service was alright at the bar. Moved to a table and service became very slow. 
I would return again, but not on the top of my list."}
{"text":"We tried the chilli and it's fantastic. Great flavor with a good smokeyness. Also the Thai chilli wing are awesome. They have a nice sweet flavor with a light kick of spice. The wings are meaty and not fried. Too bad it was take out. This place looks like a cool place to hang out and enjoy dinner or a few drinks."}
{"text":"Bleh. 

I have been anxiously awaiting the opening of this spot, since I frequent the other spots on the same corner.  I had some pretty high hopes that this might end up rivaling Postino's or Bomberos... or well... something other than a drive-thru.

I ordered the daily flatbread pizza.  It was a Chicken Teriyaki with prosciutto, pineapple and red jalapenos.  The ingredients didn't seem to be of the best quality.  The chicken was a little gristly (sliced breast meat would have been nice), and the cheese was unspeakable.  It was straight-from-a-bag mozzarella... which was congealed into a huge mass of grease.  The pizza was so wet with sauce and grease and heavy from too many toppings, that I couldn't even identify the crust... it was disintegrating before my eyes.  The prosciutto was all in one large clump, instead of being sprinkled throughout.  So disappointing.  My friend's caprese salad was mainly a plate of tomatoes with a garnish of cheese and a sprig of basil.  I love a good caprese - and especially enjoy when there is a fairly equal amount of all ingredients.  Helps balance out each bite, you know?  No such luck with this one! 

Our service was fine.  Helpful enough in the beginning, but I think once she sensed we weren't thrilled with our food, she just tried to get away with a minimal amount of interaction.  The waitress never asked me how my meal was... even though I was clearly picking at it, and only ate half of it.  She offered to clear it away - not box it - so, she must have realized I didn't enjoy it.

I will definitely wait a while for a return visit.  Since it is close and has a great layout/atmosphere, I am hoping that they work out these rather large kinks and become the kind of place that I would like to revisit."}
{"text":"I really enjoy this gastropub. The bartenders make great drinks and the pours are generous. They have a solid selection of craft beers, but could rotate more often. The dining area is comfortable and they have great TV's for watching a ballgame. The patio is fun when the temps are right. The food is elevated pub fare. Stick with the burgers and sandwiches. Their bacon is delicious! I had the rib eye once and was disappointed. To be fair, it was only $28 and I should not expect prime beef for that price. Our service has always been great. The people are knowledgeable and friendly."}
{"text":"We were so excited to see this place open in our neighborhood, and finally were able to try it last week for happy hour. The atmosphere is cool and open - it's way bigger than it looks from the outside. We sat outside which was nice, although they should probably add some lights to the patio - got dark! The wine selection and menu choices were great, definitely something for everyone. My faves were the onion rings and the bacon wrapped shrimp over lemon risotto - YUM! The prices were kind of high, enough to keep us form going back any time soon, but this is totally a good place to try. Maybe the prices will drop a bit after a few more months, hint, hint :-)"}
{"text":"The restaurant must have changed its menu around I have been eating there for the last year and a half 2 years and it is an awesome place to eat now I wouldn't eat there if I was homeless no really there steak was so awesome at hobes meat but now I am reduced to a simple patty melt whatever the only reason I went there is cause the wings were so damn good I will never eat here again"}
{"text":"My fiancé and I had dinner on a Friday night.  We arrived about 7:00 and I was pleasantly surprised that there was no wait.  The happy hour crowd was still lingering and unfortunately we were seated by two loud women that seemed as if they had been pounding drinks since 5:00.  I was really excited to try the deviled eggs since you don't see them on the menu that many places.  When they arrived the yolk part of the egg looked almost orange.  Weird.  They also had a very strong smell of some kind of spice or flavoring that they must use in making them.  I didn't like the smell but I'm not sure what exactly it was...maybe horseradish?  Unfortunately neither of us liked them and only ended up eating one half each.  For dinner I ordered the caprese salad and he had grilled chees with waffle fries.  When the food arrived it looked pretty good, but again his smelled very strongly.  This time of grease or a deep fryer.  Yuck.  I know French fries are fried, but I've never smelled a grease smell like that in all my years of eating them.  My salad was ok.  I didn't expect it to be great given that the Garage has more of a bar vibe than anything else.  We both agreed we wouldn't go back.  On the plus side, I can cross it off my list of places to try."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of this place.  They have great outdoor seating and staff that is on top of it.  The food usually comes out super fast  - and if there there is any wait - they will tell you.  I usually sit at the outdoor seating during lunchtime and enjoy the sun.  The food can be a little pricey - but its huge portions that you can bring home for another meal.  I would def recommend this place.  The only downfall to sitting outside is that being right on Bethany Home Road - you do hear a lot of traffic.  I saw a few signs for Happy hour specials and while I have not been there yet for that - its something I would def go to!"}
{"text":"Tried the Garage for the first time on 1/15/14. This place is awesome! Their beer selection is killer. I told our bartender what I liked and that I prefer local selections, and he brought me a really good IPA. I consider myself a mac n cheese aficionado, and until now, I thought Cold Beer n Cheeseburgers in Old Town had the best around. Well, this place has it beat, and It is hands-down the best I have had. My date had the chili mac which looked awesome too, but being a vegetarian I stuck with the plain. Good environment and friendly staff make this place tops."}
{"text":"My girlfriend suggested we meet here for our weekly happy hour get together. I live in the area and love trying out new places in Central Phoenix, so I was excited to meet there! To get to the point, my only complaint is that their happy hour was not really a happy hour at all. I think it was $1.00 off draught beer and $2 off their (very expensive) wine list. There were no discounts on food! Definitely no points for a good happy hour. We split the Caprese salad which was very, very good, but again, too expensive for what it is. I ordered the grilled cheese and my girlfriend got the burger. We both were satisfied, but overall, I didn't think the Garage was anything special. I did love the decor and layout though and the service was really good."}
{"text":"Lemon ricotta pancakes......


Dank as fuck.  Come here every weekend for them. 

Chill staff.  Good music.  Good spot.   Always get really good service.  We eat out a lot and this place we always come back to.  Pretty much once we tried the pancakes, we've come back every weekend.  They're that good.  My boyfriend will say every week \"can't wait for Saturday pancakes!!\""}
{"text":"Came to town for the Final Four & was so happy we stumbled upon this place! AWESOME, relatively healthy food & an unbelievable skinny margarita. The owner is also \"good people\" & deserves our support in a world of chains :)"}
{"text":"Loved the BLT on this late afternoon lunch...  perfect with a iced cold Tea on 100 degrees outside !  Freshly toasted bread and the beefy thick sliced tomatoes on this baby were perfect fit with the apple bacon !!!!!   Love the Big Bar as a center piece , and the Atmosphere was just perfect for lunch..   late lunch that is. GREAT SERVICE  and CLEAN CLEAN CLEAN !"}
{"text":"I am going to update my review on the Garage.  This is a local place that we stop in to from time to time on our local bike rides.  I have to say, after going there yesterday I am pretty much done with the place.  The food is okay, not great, but okay.  We ordered the chicken wings and when we got the bill there was a $3 charge for celery.  Okay, I get it you have to make money, but that could at least be brought up in advance (which the waiter falsely claimed he did bring up).  I don't know any other restaurant that charges $3 for celery when you order the chicken wings.  Geex, if we would have got got carrots I guess it would be $6 just for carrots and celery.  Anyway, that was just one of the issues.  The other issue was the lack of energy and enthusiasm from the servers.  I know its not an easy job, but there was a general \"doom and gloom\" vibe which doesn't work for me when I am out trying to have fun.   For me, I won't be going back, and my guests were not overly impressed any more than I was.  For me, I would say hit the Vig across the street, The Whining Pig, or try the Swizzle.  I have reviews on those.  Much better in my opinion.  I would shut the garage door respectfully."}
{"text":"We came here around lunch today. Cute little place with a trendy feel (It probably looks beautiful at night). It's also connected to a couple other stores in a plaza, but don't let that fool you. 

My husband and I shared the french toast, as we were just stopping for something small while traveling with our puppy. (Yes, they allow pets on the patio - major plus!) I also got to enjoy a delicious 'Garage Sunrise' with my french toast. (Perfect combination) 

So, why only the four stars? 

Well, my husband ordered a bloody mary (as he normally does, if not a 'jack & coke') & he barely touched it. So, I was pretty in shock. As I tried it, it seemed very bland. Almost as if it was watered down or not enough tomato juice in it. Other than that though, everything was awesome. I say just tweak that Mary a slight bit & I hope to enjoy more in the future!"}
{"text":"We initially went because my husband had wanted to try out this little gastropub and is a huge fans a trying a variety of beers.  And we've returned because I fell head over heels in \"food heaven\" with their Shrimp and Risotto dish!  Beautiful, large shrimp are wrapped in bacon and grilled.  They are then placed on a bed of a lemon risotto that has the perfect balance of freshness from the lemon and comfort from the cheesy goodness.  There are splashes of truffle oil, balsamic glaze and some other sauce that make this dish a total delight!  My husband typically orders the burger, and said that it is a good and satisfying when you're looking for an All-American burger on a good roll.  I've also tried the lamb, which to me was just okay, and I probably wouldn't order it again.  We've had friends order the flatbread pizzas and the wings and all said they were really good too!  We ordered the bread pudding once too off of our servers recommendation, and it was different than most bread puddings, but really good.

The service tends to be hit or miss... so be aware of that.  You'll probably be pretty upset if you're really into excellent service... it hasn't been awful, but it can be inconsistent (we've had really good, one average, and one that was terrible).  Some nights tend to be really busy, so I'd avoid that as it seems that any service goes straight down the tubes.  But, since I'm hooked on their shrimp and risotto... I will return whether the service is great or just ho-hum.  And my husband really seems to enjoy the beers, while the selection isn't huge, he has really liked what he's had!"}
{"text":"It was a Friday night and my wife and I were very hungry. 

It was around 10 o'clock and we were in the area. Our first thought was, \"Hey, let's go to The Vig!\" We go there and see the looooooooooong line of people waiting to get in. 

Yeah, yeah, I know. Friday night, popular place. I should have expected that. Instead of waiting for an hour to get some food and leaving the area, we Yelped for what was nearby and saw that in walking distance ther was \"Garage\". 

Holy crap. How have I never been here before?! I loved it! 

It's occuring to me now that I've always passed this place, but I just never really noticed it. It was pretty busy when we went, but this place should have the line out the door just like The Vig! 

It looks like, well, a garage. The atmosphere is pretty neat. Very trendy. I had their burger and fries and it was just great. I mean burgers and fries are burgers and fries just abou anywhere, but I liked it here. I wasn't disappointed. 

Our server was nice and attentive. I've definitely got to stop by again. 

I like this little corridor with its local restaurants. It's a shame they're building that Z Tejas right across the street. It hurts this little intersection's charm!"}
{"text":"My first visit was the result of the KAET TV show, \"Check Please, Arizona\". Very impressive. Relaxed atmosphere,  service by Kimberly was sincere, classy and friendly. EXCELLENT clientel. Burger & fries got the job done. I enjoyed the whole deal...I'll be back."}
{"text":"First time there was nice. The place is very cool looking. The service was very friendly. We ordered Salad and Fries which took a little longer than I imagine at other places, but the Thai salad was worth the wait. Nice local place to hang out. I'm not going to trip about the wait for for food. The server kept my glass full so that makes up for what is likely a fluke in the kitchen or something. I would recommend and will def be coming back again!"}
{"text":"The place is really chill. We went at 8:30pm on a Saturday night and it was dead. There's only 6 beers on tap though, and it would get a five star rating if they had more. There's a lot of places around here to compete with, so I feel it would do better with more selection. Carnitas nachos were awesome, as well as their truffle honey wings."}
{"text":"We went here last night as a result of a groupon and we'll definately be back. The deviled eggs were fantastic and the flat bread was excellent. Can't wait to return to try the entrees. Service was great and atmosphere is comfortable. Noise level was just right. And most importantly, the smoking section is out back. So the patio can actually be enjoyed without smelling smoke. Great idea. I wish more restaurants would implement this concept. I would eat on the patio more."}
{"text":"Typically I give a place that falls in the middle of great and bad multiple chances.  For whatever reason it's easier for me to 1, 4 or 5 star a place after the first visit, rather than 3.  As far as yelp is concerned, 3 stars isn't a bad thing - \"A-OK.\"!

The scene is strange.  It's a mix of typical Arcadia, Scottsdale and the like.  This place is more of a sports bar than anything, in my eyes, with better food than your typical sports bar fare.  Seriously.  There's like 14 televisions in here.

Service is quick-ish.  Food is fresh.  The servings are very large.  Some things waver on decent-to-bland, while other things are pretty swell.  The mac & cheese is a pass, in my opinion, and not worth the $5 (for the small cup you get - ah, contradictory to my large servings note!).  Some dishes have an overpowering taste, while other leave you wondering if you're eating food or chewing crunchy water (that sounds gross now that I've typed it out!).

Beer and liquor list is pretty typical; nothing to note really.  A few changes here and there and I could see it as a really decent spot.  The same could be said for the food, really.

I'll be back, yet again, The Garage just hasn't blown me away yet.  Also, on a funnier note: \"Garage\" reads easily as \"Garbage\" on the menu, which was kind of comical."}
{"text":"Very nice staff, fun design, menu a little on the light side. 

Everything I have ordered has been very tasty, but I think they could expand the brunch menu a little. If you go for brunch the lemon ricotta pancakes are wonderful.

The appetizers are great, love the deviled eggs with truffle oil and a small bit of bacon. Also, on the appetizer menu are lamb chops, yum. I really enjoy the cheese plate. Funny thing, every time I order the cheese plate the selection of cheese seems to revolve around alcohol. An example is the Guinness cheddar cheese. It is a nice plate to share. 

Happy hour brings half off appetizers, always a good thing!

I like the patio, it faces the parking lot, but that just gives it an urban feel, like it! The decor inside has an urban industrial feel as well, but is comfortable with the woodwork and booths. The signs on the walls I was told were the original signs when the space was actually a garage, not a restaurant. 

Good food and good people working there. Definitely a place to check out."}
{"text":"I've visited the Garage several times since it's in the neighborhood where I live.  The first time I came here, I thought it was really good.  Each time I've gone back since then, the good impression I had unfortunately keeps going down.  Ate dinner here again tonight and needless to say, was quite disappointed.  My boyfriend ordered the lamb k-bobs medium well.  When they came out, they were rare.  Sent them back and they were still raw.  He could not eat them as they were not cooked, were chewy and had a lot of gristle, etc. in them.  The waiter did not check with us if they were cooked right the second time and he did not care either, which was evident when he picked up the plate which still had most of the food on it and did not say anything.  
I had the patty melt which was just okay.  The wine was mediocre for the price.  Cannot even hold a candle to the wine at Richardson's which is right up the street.  The brew fries, chipotle dipping sauce and the pickles were probably the best thing we ate here!  Not all the food is bad, but for the prices they charge, it is just not worth it.  Very doubtful we'll be going back."}
{"text":"First impression...confusing.  We parked and walked through the patio where a sign read \"See hostess to be seated\".  When we got inside, there wasn't a clear setup for the hostess, there were just these 2 girls ( 1 standing, 1 sitting) by the doorway, but it's not like they were wearing anything that would really clue us in to them working there.  Then they asked if it was just us, then we knew we had found the hostess.  We ended up sitting on the patio.  We liked the patio, it was nice.  Our table was wobbely, but my husband put his flip flop under it...That worked.  Food was good.  I had the BLT with waffle fries, my husband had a burger with steak fries.  The menu however, seemed to not have enough options for us.  By looking at it, we knew this was probably going to be the last time we come here.  It was just kind of, like I said before, confusing.  It's called \"Garage\", the menu items seem to be aimed more towards an Uptown kind of crowd and when my husband ordered a coke, the server brought him a glass of ice with a can of coke on the side.  It was just weird."}
{"text":"Very cool neighborhood place...good beer selection and the flatbreads were great!  The bartender was very friendly and the place just has a cool vibe!"}
{"text":"Miss the old happy hour menu but this place is still good, now a little pricey but always good."}
{"text":"It's always hit or miss.  You either get the right bartender who pours right, remembers your drink, and charges you right.  Or you get a crappy drink double charged and no apologies.  The happy hour lamb kabob is either perfect or chewy.  The burgers are either amazing or burnt.  If you are single and don't have high standards, it's great.  If your wife is picky or you have issues with below standard food half the time, don't bother.  As for me,  I've tried and tried but don't plan on trying again anytime soon"}
{"text":"New to the neighborhood and really wanted to like this place. The hostess was friendly enough, inviting us to sit anywhere.  We took a table on the patio, and after several minutes the bartender brought water and menus, but left without a single word. 10 minutes later and no server of any kind returned to the table. We watched barstaff clean glassware and chat with other customers. Eventually we left without a glance from anyone.  It was clearly not a busy night. Not sure if this is the norm, but it is unlikely we will give it another try."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and service to match.  A great addition to the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"I think Garage has potential to be a great draw to Uptown Phoenix! I really like this place, the renovations are awesome, but the menu lacks balance in pricing and portions. With a name like Garage, I was prepared for a gritty, hamburger-driven menu, but that is not the case. Garage strives for pretty and delicious instead. 

My burger had great size and flavor. Instead of the selections on the menu for cheese, I opted for goat cheese...I highly, highly recommend this! The burger, the bacon, the goat cheese and the bun came together to one fantastic flavor. None of the ingredients lacked any sort of quality, that's for sure.

My girlfriend's salad was kind of small for $10, but also had good flavor. In fact, it was one of the fresher and better tasting caprese salads that I've tasted, but it seemed more like it should have been under the appetizers for around $6 instead of the salad menu. It just wouldn't be enough food for me if I solely ordered that for a meal.

Again, Garage has potential, and a lot of it. The space is gorgeous, the service is friendly and the quality of the food sets a high bar. Since it's close to my house, I will be back. I'm curious about checking out their happy hour."}
{"text":"I have been there a few times now.  Overall, service is solid, although I feel the bar service is faster than when sitting at a table.  Ambiance is solid and generally full during the early evening hours.  They can improve on little things, but overall a good, casual place to go.

Burgers are fantastic.  The horseradish pickles and Havarti cheese is a nice touch.  

Flatbreads are very tasty.

Wings are interesting - off the beaten path a bit, but tasty.

I like how they promote local beers.  Decent wines by the glass as well."}
{"text":"Stopped into Garage Wine & Tap, previously really enjoyed this place for happy hour. Not so much this visit... They were out of the deviled eggs... This is one of the appetizers they are known for... So how can you be out of something you can buy across the street.., we opted for the Lamb skewers unfortunately they were so tough no amount of chewing could get them down... Though our server was aware she did not take them off the bill. The humus was mediocre at best and the wings which use to be awesome were served mildly warm and we had to request celery and blue cheese.. Which took forever to be served... Not impressed.... Management really needs to step it up,.. Could be a great neighborhood go to place but not for this neighbor!"}
{"text":"Love the place. Been here a few times. 

Please Let go your current daytime bartender.  Personality should account for something"}
{"text":"Love this place! Always enjoy the yummy food and fantastic servers. Ask for Tony; he'll take great care of you with a big smile the whole time.  I love their specialty cocktails, especially the Sapphire Basil Collins. If you come for food, try some things on the happy hour menu. Regular menu- My all time favorite thing is the bacon wrapped tiger shrimp...OMG!!!"}
{"text":"-The deviled eggs appetizer was pretty good but lacked in presentation.
-The patty melt had plenty of onion-y goodness and was one of the best I've had.
-We happened to come in during the Arizona Cardinals vs. Green Bay Packers playoff game. Now, as an avid Detroit Red Wings fan, I certainly understand the hubbub of a playoff game. However, our server, Tony, seemed to forget he was at work. He really shifted a good portion of his responsibilities to us on to his co-workers. We didn't lack for anything but we felt like we were an obligation rather than guests."}
{"text":"So typically we go to Lucy's for lunch...but decided today to try the Garage. I like the interior look and feel and of course the free wifi. They were out of the beer we wanted (no biggie). Ordered two different flat breads (the Meat and the BBQ Chicken). Meat was great...but beware of the BBQ Chicken, it has jalapenos on it. Now, I LOVE spicy food and jalapenos....but the Garage uses Fresno Jalapenos and they are FRICKIN' HOT!!!! My lips were on fire!! and anything they touched were on fire as well! YIKES!! makes it really hard to enjoy the flatbread when you are crying. Would have been nice if the staff would have mentioned the burn level of this pizza. If anything, it got me order another beer."}
{"text":"went on monday with the sis in law we split wings yumm develeggs good we each had a house salad and the bbq chicken flat bread a few brews and a bloody mary and took some left overs home service was good nice cool spot"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a beer and it was delightful. Service was fast at the bar and it was reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Well, it's a cute spot, pretty chill. Check out HH for sure, it goes until 7pm. However, while the food is good, there was nothing that felt truly unique about it. Our waitress was awesome, though, so based on my first visit they have good service!!"}
{"text":"Went there for lunch.  Split a chopped salad and a deviled eggs.

Large portions.  Salad was a bit heavy on sauce, but I liked it.  Deviled eggs had some truffle oil which made them pretty good.  

Burger was gigantic.  Ordered onion rings that were just not good at all... must be frozen pre-bought, which sucks.  Burger kind of tasted oily bland.  Tried to add mustard, and it wasn't terrible, but for an upscale burger at $12 expected just a bit better.  Companion had sweet potato fries which were much better.

Service even though the place was dead was very slow.  Not unfriendly, but they need to realize people that go for a mid-week lunch usually don't have 1.5-2 hours to eat.

All in all, it wasn't a terrible experience.  I really like the ambience... love the modern look of brick and blackened steel.  

But I'd probably be more interested in coming here for beers and drinks with a couple appetizers, than a sit-down meal.  For a meal, there are just much better central Phoenix locations."}
{"text":"I recently moved to the Central Phoenix area, and I saw Garage a few times driving by, so we decided to check it out! It's definitely a cool little spot with an interesting menu. They have happy hour till 7pm, which if you live nearby makes it a good weeknight spot because you can quickly stop at home first and still make it :) 

I started with a White Sands Martini - this drink is definitely heavy on tequila, so if that's not your thing or you're more into margaritas I would recommend asking for extra pineapple juice. The taste was a little strong for me! I would have ordered a beer instead, but their list was kind of limited - definitely more of a wine place! 

For food, we decided to stick to the happy hour menu because the prices were a lot better. They have three different kinds of sliders (each order comes with two), and we couldn't decide which to get so we just tried them all. My favorite was the Black and Blue Burger Slider - not too strong with the blue cheese and the meat was cooked really well! The BBQ Pork were really tasty, and the Grilled Chicken reminded me of the caprese sliders a lot of places make, minus the tomato. We also tried the Garage Fries because I saw them in a lot of other Yelp photos, and those were delicious!! I think they'd be better if the Parmesan were more melty, so I might ask for that ;) The chipotle ranch on the side was a nice touch, too, and actually pretty spicy! 

For dessert we split the Skillet Cookie, which I really enjoyed. A lot like the typical Pizookie, but the cookie was a bit thinner. Super yummy, but eating this after all the sliders and fries definitely gave me a little food baby lol. Not sure when we'll be back since there are so many places around here, but I'm really glad we gave this place a try!"}
{"text":"At the recommendation of a friend who used to live in Phoenix, I stopped by fortru happy hour to try the deviled eggs (hello bacon & truffle oil) & a glass of wine.  The Layercake Malbec and service was so exceptional (props to the hostess for making a single diner feel welcome & Tony is attentive but not overbearing - even delaying my eventual dinner order and telling there was no rush - enjoy the wine) that I stayed for dinner.  Yummy, but gigantic Thai salad for me.  If I lived here, I'd be back again regularly."}
{"text":"I wish there were 6 stars for this place. I have been here a few times and think the burgers and fries are world class, but I had to bring my parents who have eaten burgers around the world to make sure I wasn't blowing smoke.
Usually a health food freak, it takes a special burger to bring me to the dark side.
The garage burger has all the things to make you go \"hmm\" in a good way - angus beef (not too fatty), cheese of choice, smoked apple bacon, caramelized onions and a couple of ancillary vegetables (lettuce, tomato). I could sit and eat a whole container of the horseradish pickles without batting an eyelash.
Running a very close second is their American burger.
Usually, if I am obsessing over the burger, the fries will not get my attention, but both their waffle fries and brew fries have crack appeal. The chipotle mayo the brew fries are served with is the icing on the cake.

Happy hour has some interesting choices, shrimp kabobs and devilled eggs, but I would recommend paying the extra for the burgers!
Even if it means you have to run and extra mile the next day :)))"}
{"text":"I've eaten here a few times, and the food has always been good, but I am usually forgotten about by wait staff for a while. Particularly my coffee cup.  Today however, I received stand out service from Kristin. Everything was right on time. Now I can give this place the review I've always wanted to."}
{"text":"Food  was good. Drinks were good. Football on the TVs  and the music was a fairly mellow, light alternative. Love a place where you can talk to people as opposed to having to yell. Live music is just starting to warm up. Very possibly my new favorite Saturday night spot (not that I go out on Saturdays often)."}
{"text":"I love this place. It's a must whenever I'm in town. And try to go on a Monday, the bartender is awesome. Just remember to KCCO. OH! And try the chili dog!"}
{"text":"Saturday night, 8pm, the place wasn't overly crowded (thereby unbearable) so we got in quickly, got seated quickly, got drinks quickly, and were left blessedly alone - the waitstaff didn't hover or check in every 10 minutes.

The background music was cool but not hip, the live musicians were also cool but not hip, very unpretentious and comfortable.  

Drink prices are medium but the tap beer AND the bottles are nice and cold.

Try it."}
{"text":"Great happy hour, even on Saturday. All the drinks are either a dollar or two off and the appetizers are all half price. Plenty of places to sit, provided you get there early or if you call and make a reservation. ( Make sure to do that if you have a large group) The chicken wings I ordered were ok but the sweet potatoe fries were AWESOME! All in all a great place to watch any sport event that may be happening with a group of friends."}
{"text":"I must say that I was amazed that I had purchased a Groupon Now to use for lunch this afternoon and they were not even open.  It looks bland on the outside, I really could not see inside.  I get the feeling that I may have been better off not going inside (but may never know)."}
{"text":"I've been an off and on customer since it opened and am sad to see a decline in quality. I just went for a night cap and the service at the bar was horrible. I even witnessed two guys approach the bar then walk away because they were tired of 
waiting...the same thing happened to another guy shortly after who was by himself. 

The wait staff did not appear to have any camaraderie among them. There were no smiles, no positive interaction and it almost seemed like they were mad at each other. 

Lastly, for some reason the female staff are scantily clad, leaving little to the imagination. This is a juxtaposition with the clientele and it does not do anything for one's appetite. 

Unless I learn of some changes for the better with this place, my future patronage here will be unlikely."}
{"text":"Great happy hour. The waiter recommended the pear martini and it was delicious. 

We also had the sliders (both beef and chicken) the hummus plate and fries. My fav was the fries. Their aioli was yummy! Def recommend getting it."}
{"text":"Great place for happy hour with lots of tasty appetizers to choose from at reasonable prices. Unfortunately, this place isn't super consistent both with food or service. Sometimes, I get someone super nice serving me a delicious meal with a smile, and other times, I get a server or bartender who could care less about getting my order correct and serving me food that's either over or under cooked. Also, when there's live music, the music can be way too loud which makes it difficult to carry on a conversation with your company. Hoping this place becomes more consistent in a positive way."}
{"text":"This place provides one more reason to say goodbye to bs corporate chains forever. a place without pretensions, cool ambiance, friendly inviting service, and food full of robust flavor. This experience totally delivered."}
{"text":"Great spot! Went there last night with a bunch of girlfriends for HH. They had a great band playing (a little too loud for HH ). We shared some aps and flatbreat, their goat cheese flat bread was really good! 
They really did a good job decorating the space and the round bar is great ! I would definitely recommend trying it !"}
{"text":"In the mood for Lucy's after church but not in the mood for crowds and loud people. 
Stumbled on this place and wondered if it was even open as it is super dark and hardly  even has a sign. 
I ordered a eggs Benedict for 9 and a lemonade for 2. Eggs Benedict came with hash browns and were average, but should have included some kind of bread. I guess I like to soak up the runny yolk with like a sourdough bread.
Lemonade was really disappointing.
Fun place to go for a cocktail, but I wouldn't come back for the food."}
{"text":"We only stopped in for a couple drinks.  The service at the bar was very good.  Very nice bartender and very quick.  My problem is that the floor right under the bar was filthy!  There were at least 6 servers just kind of hanging around, on their phones, chatting amongst themselves, etc.  If I owned or managed this place, I would have had someone with a broom on top of that immediately upon us leaving. Although it would never have been there in the first place.  To me, cleanliness is the most important aspect of any restaurant.  I mean what does it say about the kitchen???  And it wasn't like someone just dropped something.  You could tell it had been building up for a while.  Probably won't be back to eat."}
{"text":"One restaurant for many occasions! I can go here for Saturday or Sunday brunch. Bring out of town guests to sit on the patio. Take a date on Saturday night. Watch a game with a buddy. Have lunch by myself without feeling like a dork. Drop by for Happy Hour. Etc. I'm a huge fan of the homemade corned beef hash for brunch. My only complaint about the burger is that it's too big! But that's life in America. I've never had service issues like some other reviews, and I've been there when it's been busy and slow. If you don't see a parking spot up front, swing around back or park next door at night. There are a couple bars within walking distance if you want a change of venue for a night cap."}
{"text":"Service great.. hummus spicy and in lighting looks like a dark pile of something.. non appetizing"}
{"text":"This trendy bar is like Scottsdale.  If you are not in, you are out.  Simply a local bar with cliques.  We went there the tonight to celebrate our success
and were treated coldly. at best.
Stay away from this pretentious wine bar.  It's too bad because the food was satisfying but the staff is very cliquish.  Go to Rokerj instead and have warm, friendly evening.  This is a bad place and don't be sucked in by the eclectic surroundings,  Especially stay away when the bartender Kim is on duty,  She is cold and very unfriendly and preoccupied with the other help instead of the patrons.  This place deserves to close as Scottsdale pretentiousness moves west because of high real estate cost.  Stay away with your attitude."}
{"text":"I'm into lists so I'll just keep this simple.  Here's what I like about the Garage: 
-great vibe
-friendly and competent servers (who also frequent some local bars in the area, so be nice b/c you'll run into them again!)
-caprese salad
-sweet potato fries
-wide selection of awesome beers on tap - bet you haven't heard of several of them!
- nice patio
- nice TVs for the sports fans (though none on the patio)
-hard cider on tap
-tile on the ladies room is very pretty  =)  (yes, I did just write that! haha)
-cute servers (both men and women), there are a fair amount of servers in this area who still have mullets and sport 80s do's so this is a nice change of pace! 

This area of Central Phoenix pretty much has only dive bars or true restaurant/dining options. but the Garage offers the perfect medium in between.  You could go there for food or you could go there just for drinks.   Definitely recommend checking it out if you are in the area!"}
{"text":"I went here for happy hour after yoga on a late Sunday afternoon with a girlfriend. The neighborhood in general has a very cozy feel to it, and this bar/restaurant is another one of those great places with a front and back door for you to feel free to enter. I shared the meat and cheese plate. It was very generous and tasty!"}
{"text":"Been back two more times - still great! Had Caprese salad and burger, and a couple of flatbreads. Both times on a Thursday night, 930, about ten people in the place one night, but the second night was packed. Great food, service."}
{"text":"I was invited by a co-worker to the Garage Wine and Tap for a wine tasting party.  As I have never been to a wine tasting party I was not sure what to expect.  Lucky I am now an expert.  Please use the following as a guide for your next wine tasting event.

1. Stand at the door like a dope and try to make eye contact with someone who works at the event.  If no one comes over to greet you, start waiving your hands to capture someones attention.  

2. Do not attempt to order any food unless you are sitting in a designated food area.  I did not know, but some areas of the Restaurant are non order areas.  We were instructed that finger food would be provided but if you would like a small plate you need to ask for one.  

3. If you wish to have any water you need to ask.

I would like to try this place on a regular night as the food looked beautiful and the staff, although a bit flustered, were very nice."}
{"text":"Overall this place gets 3 stars. The food we had and the service get 5 stars. However the food we Wanted was unavailable and so this is how i arrive at a rating of 3:
A few minutes before 8pm last night when we got to the restaurant, the specials board out front had some kind of chicken thing that sounded delicious to Ben. Ben ordered the special and the server told us that they never change the specials board so she didn't think that was the nightly special but she'd check to see if they had any. She comes back and tells us that what was on the board was indeed NOT the special of the night, but rather a pulled pork sandwich. 
So Ben orders the Ahi tuna and she tells us that they are also out of the tuna. He orders the pork sandwich, I get the chicken sandwich and order mac and cheese instead of fries. Oh, we also got the deviled eggs to start. 
Deviled eggs were great, but i was also starving... Each half had a little piece of bacon sticking out of the middle and was drizzled with truffle oil (which I never can tell if that actually makes my food taste any different, honestly)
Ben loved the pork sandwich. My chicken sandwich was pretty great but the Mac and Cheese... man, oh, man! SO GOOD! 
I ordered a vodka martini- well vodka is Finlandia and cost 8 bucks. I suppose that's \"normal\" for not being happy hour, but I usually only order drinks that are on special, so my average martini was definitely a splurge. Happy hour apparently ends at 6pm and starts again at 10pm.

I'll go back during happy hour and try some more things."}
{"text":"The location of this place is great, and I like how convenient it is for me. I can't seem to get attentive service here. My last visit was no exception to I attentive service; I came on a Sunday afternoon when it was quiet, and sat at the sidewalk-facing bar for over 15 minutes before anyone came to greet me. There were hostesses and servers talking to the hostesses while standing less than five feet from me. As I started approaching the exit, situated right next to the hostess stand, then someone greeted me and asked if I was leaving. I'm glad they noticed! I wish they noticed sooner because I really wanted a glass of wine, and their wine list was accessibly interesting. If you don't mind inconsistent, and occasionally absent, service, stop on by!"}
{"text":"Amazing service, gourmet food, live music, cheap drinks, what more could you ask for? 6 star worthy. Eat local, support your city!"}
{"text":"I've been to the Garage a few times generally for a long lunch, they are usually pretty quiet and I can catch up on some e-mails while getting a quality craft beer. They don't serve the domestic swill so if you drink boring light beer continue on down to your local sports bar. I over heard the owner mention he didn't know what a Gastropub was until someone told him he opened one, he did a good job I enjoy frequenting his place.

The service is good, bartenders and servers make recommendations and I haven't been let down yet. The burger is quality and can't beat the price, I love the flatbreads and they always seem to have a good special at lunch. If you have a chance to have the chicken meatloaf sandwich give it a shot you wont be let down. People have mentioned and complained about service and I can say that this place can get busy especially during weekend dinner hours so if you're impatient, don't be, get a drink and enjoy yourself and the atmosphere and the weather, especially when the doors are open to the patio.

My only real complaints are the rear parking, its tight and limited, people who park out front consistently back into the poles, the rear entrance forces you to enter through a small smoking section that can be dirty and smell of smoke and if you sit in the booths there is a faint smell of tire as there are 3 hanging on the wall... but maybe that's just me."}
{"text":"I was in town visiting for Thanksgiving and my friend suggested meeting up at this spot for lunch. The place wasn't super crowded which I was happy with because that meant we would get our food that much quicker. The place has a cool gastro pub vibe and the outdoor seating seemed popular. I started with a glass of Riesling and my friend raved about the deviled eggs we ordered those for an appetizer. The eggs were def. yummy, the truffle oil and the bacon on top made them extra special! For my meal I ordered the herb marinated chicken sandwich with sweet potatoes fries. The Sammy was tasty, the chicken was actually juicy and the arugula, picked onions and tomato jam were a perfect match. The fries were ok, to me they weren't crispy enough... I'm a little picky when it comes to my sweet potato fries    

Overall a solid meal with solid service, I would visit again when I'm in the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"The garage came out exactly how I wanted and tasted very good, the sweet potatoe fries sauce was excellent also for whatever was in it, tasted a little lemony lol."}
{"text":"I love this place.  Relaxed, cool decor and the best barbecue sliders.  The bartender Kimberly is the best!"}
{"text":"The parking is horrific.  (It's in the same structure as Luci's and a cupcake store).  However, brave the parking situation since this is a much needed local non-chain addition to the neighborhood.  Without dissing Zipps across the street, (I mean, how many Zipps can one metropolitan area really need?), this is a great place to watch football and get a few beers.  
The cons are that there are on a few good beers on tap, which does thankfully include a cider.  The food is good.  I really really like the garage board, which is one of the best cheeseplates in town.  Artfully assembled, with the perfect mix of cheeses, meats and different nuts, olives and sweets its addictive.  The decor is minimalistic and could actually benefit with another mural but overall its a comfortable easy place to grab a beer and eat a deviled egg.  Seriously, they have bacon.  They are delicious."}
{"text":"Met up with a few friends from high school for Happy Hour. It was a perfect meet up place, but also a cozy restaurant and bar. I had one of their recommended happy hour drinks with a hint of pear. They don't spare alcohol here. And, with the Happy Hour price of $6, I was more than 'happy!' We also split three appetizers - hummus, lamb kabobs and parmesan fries... All delicious! I will definitely go back for drinks and a meal with my husband. Can't wait to try other items."}
{"text":"Went last night with a group of 18, a challenge since they don't take reservations. The person I talked to earlier in the day said there was nothing they could/would do, the hostess when we arrived said we should have called ahead and they could have tried to prepare for us.
We ended up splitting the group into 4 tables.

The food: the deviled eggs were bland as hell. Now I know why they add the bacon on top. My burger was good. Meaty and juicy. I'm personally not a fan of sweet pickles at any time, especially on a burger. So many onion rings I couldn't finish them. Other diners at the table had the brats and said they were ok, but not really a lot of flavor, which seemed to be the trend with everything.

Also, the aluminum bottles of Coke are cute and trendy, but I'm not big on not having free refills on sodas at a restaurant, especially when they are charging $2.00 a pop.

I had so been looking forward to returning here after my first visit in January. I would go back, but now it's just another restaurant to me."}
{"text":"So, I too live within walking distance of Garage.  I have popped in on 3 separate occasions & each time I have enjoyed myself.  The menu is small, and I've only have a couple of different flat breads, so I definitely need to venture out.  I also seem to keep stopping by during happy hour.  I'd like to see what their dinner selections are.  
Staff is friendly and attentive.  I'll definitely go back to sample more beers, wines, and food."}
{"text":"The lamb on the appetizer menu is 5 stars!  And if you look through the reviews here, I think the higher reviews are from people who got the lamb.  They're so nicely done (not well done! get them medium rare!), and the chimichurri sauce is excellent.

I've had the garage burger at lunch with a side of their house salad (pesto dressing - yum!) and it's very filling.  Tasty too."}
{"text":"This place is starting to grow on me. I wasn't too impressed the first time I popped in here because despite my appreciation for the beers they had on tap, I really could not a get a feel on the vibe which is VERY important to me. That impression was probably premature because they had just opened.
I've been back a few times and they've added stuff to the walls to give it more personality and I really enjoyed the service the last time I was here. I didn't eat but someone close by was eating something that smelled AWESOME!!! I really love the back patio with the fireplace....nice touch.
This is another one of those places where you'd maybe want to start out the night rather than finish (it closes at midnight on weekends so finishing here would be an EARLY night for this seasoned drinker!) or maybe a good place for brunch."}
{"text":"Finally got to try this place and was not disappointed! I had the pork chop and it was mighty tasty! It sat on a bed of rice/risotto flavored with fennel sausage that I  could eat every day, I  really enjoyed it that much! My wife had the garage burger and enjoyed it as well.  Not the quietest place, but an excellent atmosphere. Nice beer choices too! Front was open and fireplace was inviting.  For a neighborhood spot with decent prices, I recommend you give it a try."}
{"text":"Great new spot!!! Was greeted at the door and quickly seated by the fireplace nice touch by the way. This is an actual old auto garage turned gastro/bistro. The tunes are spot on and they have 4 TV's for all the games. Service staff is very friendly. The food is contemporary punched with lots of love. The wings are amazing an offered in a chile, sweet soy, or truffle glaze. They have shrimp cocktail, deviled eggs, cheese board just to name a few apps. The basic salads and burgers and dogs. (brats and franks!).

The Lamb Chops are awesome dont miss those"}
{"text":"I've been here twice now and definitely think it's a nice addition to the neighborhood.

It's great that they kept a lot of the history of the building and were able to update it and turn it into a nice bar/restaurant. It's a very attractive space and will be even better when the weather gets warmer and they can roll up the overhead doors.

This last visit I ordered the Garage burger and a combo of their waffle fries and sweet potato fries on the side.  The burger was good, but let's face it, a burger is pretty much a burger.  The fries were above average and the portions were huge.

My favorite part of the meal was the Thunder Canyon amber ale.  Brewed down in Tucson, it is awesome and gives Fat Tire and Kiltlifter a run for their money.

The service was friendly and overall I have enjoyed stopping in here for a beer or a bite to eat."}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday night with 4 other guests.  Started with the Garage Board which has a delicious array of meats, cheeses and crostini.  I had the shrimp pasta special which was perfect.  All other guests were very happy with their meals.  Service was attentive and helpful.  Will be back."}
{"text":"Great salad. Loved the flat bread. Good service. If you like European lagers try the Stiegl on draft from Austria. Really good. We will go back soon."}
{"text":"Hubs and I visited for a nightcap and ended up staying a while longer.  Bartender was super nice and the crowd was pleasant.  Drinks were reasonably priced.  Will definitley be back!"}
{"text":"Great service, good beer, AMAZING burger and yummy sweet potato fries.  This place is an awesome bar food venue with a cool interior design, not too pricey or pretentious."}
{"text":"Great experience. Great atmosphere. Yummy food. Will be back and they're open til late."}
{"text":"Here's the deal- I was looking for  happy hour at 5 o'clock on a Saturday, and that's the magic hour when most are ending. So we decided to go down to Garage because their happy hour goes until 7 on Saturdays (every day, I think.) The deals on drinks were unimpressive. The selection of beer on tap was an equal letdown (only 6 beers to choose from.) That was a bummer, for a place with \"Wine and Tap\" in the name. I am tap-happy though so maybe I'm just hard to please. 

We shared an order of fries ($5) before ordering. The fries were crispy and fresh tasting, but definitely not so special in the way of flavor. We ordered a flat bread to share for dinner, which was tasty- but it wasn't really a legit dinner for two people. So we decided it'd be cheaper just to go across the street to Zipps and finish up our night there, with cheaper drinks to boot... 

We'll probably go back because their patio is cool (as small as it is), and maybe next time we'll head across the other side of the street over to the Vig after. I don't see myself ever spending an entire night, or even just a dinner, at the Garage... but it might be a good starter bar."}
{"text":"I maintain my 4 star review, but wanted to say that their reverse happy hour has won over 2 more fans. Get the lamb k-bobs...you won't be disappointed. Unless you don't like lamb. Or k-bobs. Or you do like lambs, but not in the edible sort of way. I won't judge."}
{"text":"It takes a lot for me to write a one star review...but this place was incredibly disappointing. 

I met up with two girl friends for lunch on a perfect Saturday afternoon. We hadn't tried Garage yet, but had been excited to do so as we frequent the area often. The atmosphere was great! We were really looking forward to our experience and our meal. 

Unfortunately, we were severely disappointed. Our server was attentive and nice, but didn't followup the way I expected or hoped. I ordered the Caprese Mozzarella Salad (one of my favorite options on many a menu) and was shocked when my plate came full of tomatoes with two skimpy pieces of mozzarella and a tiny piece of basil (about as big as my thumb). There was no way that I was interested in paying $10 for a plate of tomatoes. I hate complaining at restaurants (being a past server), so I kindly asked ours for some extra mozzarella and basil. My frustration increased when I saw that I was charged another $2 for the extra two pieces of cheese. 

My friend's meal was also a disappointment. She ordered the flat bread special of the day and it was drenched in grease, which made it very difficult to eat, let alone enjoy. She was only able to finish half of her meal. I expected our server to at least ask if she was unhappy with her food, but she just took the plate and walked away. 

As great as this new joint seemed, I will most likely not be returning. It's a shame because the place really looked like it had potential. Unfortunately, the food was overpriced, poorly executed, and lacking quality and flavor. Sorry Garage...you're going to need to seriously up your game to earn me as a customer."}
{"text":"I give this place a 2 star rating because the place is clean and spacious, it has a good vibe to it... but they do not equip themselves with enough staff. The service is extremely slow. I don't know how they plan on staying in business."}
{"text":"Well we wont be back again. This place could be so cool but I don't really care for the menu and we have been unhappy with the food the last two times we have been and this last waitress sealed the deal for me. The waitress we had this time seem to be in la la  land. She forgot about comin back to take our dinner order after we ordered wings, she couldn't seem to finish her sentences, and really didn't seem to give a shit about us and she only had one other table. The chicken sandwich is not the same as the one I had the first time. This was a chicken breast with the fat still on it, totally untrimmed. Chicken fat in your mouth is the most disgusting thing ever. Also the bread was hard and it was not cause it was toasted to much it had dried out from sitting out un covered. Hard as a rock! They tried to tell me it was toasted but, lol, there was  no color at all, meaning not toasted, not dark, I hate being bull shitted, people make mistakes so just admit it don't bull shit me ass hole. I sent it back and did not get anything else. If these cooks here cant prep a chicken breast then who knows what else there doin back there, this is basics. My girlfriend got the grilled cheese and mac n cheese. Again bread not toasted, totally white and cheese not really melted. Um do these people know what a grilled cheese even is. Unreal. The bread was to thick for the amount of cheese. Imagine two pieces of texas thick sliced bread and one slice of cheese, lol this place is a joke. The mac and cheese is watery and no flavor. See ya Garage. If you cant make a grilled cheese, mac n cheese ,or a chicken sandwich that's even acceptable then forget it. I guess if you have a burger and wings here you may be happy that's it."}
{"text":"Showing some signs of age, but still a great spot for lunch or happy hour- with delicious food of above-average quality and presentation, and well-poured drinks.

So, sometimes the menus are sticky from not being wiped down thoroughly, but the cute and kind female servers make me quickly forget about that minute detail. 

If you order a salad, ask for the house vinaigrette dressing. If you go for lunch and order the Chicken & Chips, have someone to share that plate with because it's enough for two people."}
{"text":"Went here for a girl's brunch on a Sunday morning. The food wasn't worth the wait with an empty restaurant which is unfortunate because our server was great. We will not be returning."}
{"text":"Not that great. It's a hip place with a solid atmosphere and great service, but the food fell short for me and my adventurers. The chicken strips were dry as a bone and couldn't be finished, though the Thai Chili sauce was good and imaginative. My partner had the lamb chops and was equally unimpressed.

It's possible we caught this place on an \"off night\" in the kitchen, which so many restaurants fall victim to, but either way we won't be back. If I'm paying $11 for the (usually safe) choice of chicken strips, I'm expecting some freaking awesome saucesome chicken strips."}
{"text":"The garage is in one of the most upcoming trendy neighborhoods of Phoenix! Great vibe, great staff, and most important great food! We all ordered different plates for brunch on new years day! I had the chorizo and eggs, boyfriend had the kaluhua French toast, and aunt ordered the hangover burger which comes with the infamous fried egg on top!  Everyone was super pleased with the freshness and flavor on the plates! I had a tasty bloody mary that had the right amount of vodka to make me leave with a smile! I had a piece of the French toast which is made with challah bread..and let's just say it was super delicious..sweet but not over the top... we will be back!"}
{"text":"Um, is this placed closed for good? Nobody home tonight. hmmm"}
{"text":"Decided to visit this place after reading good reviews. Went in on a Saturday around 1:30. They were only 6 tables seated. Good was ok, the wife's steak and eggs came out not cooked to order. Sent it back and they made the correction. Then the steak was cold. Service was good, a little slow at first but she stepped up. Beers were served in a 12 oz glass $6.00 -"}
{"text":"This has been a favorite place to come unwind after a long stressful day, good food and some good servers. But today on my 8th time coming here, the service was horrible. Servers who can't put the bull  aside and make money. I will not be coming here much longer if the service continues to slack. Poor example of great customer service. And trust me I love this place, from the fries to the bloody Mary's. If myself and the party I'm with is going to be jerked around, and wait over  mins for service I will not be coming, or at least call before hand to make sure the great servers are working. This would be 5 stars if the service was as good as the rest."}
{"text":"Brittany, Sarah and Jenn are absolutely amazing bartenders. Ive been coming here here for two years and I just love being here and talking with my bartenders

They take such great care of me and have amazing conversations with me :)"}
{"text":"First of all, I've got to give some love to local bars that try to be hip, especially in my old stomping grounds uptown. I compare this place to The Whining Pig across the street because they're both wine/beer bars, but there are some differences:
1. Ambiance is the garage is more upscale. Feels more grown up. And it's about 5 times larger, which means it never feels packed. Actually kinda empty.
2. The Garage has an awesome patio for nice nights.
3. Prices at The Garage are higher. They run happy hour specials every day, so everything is still reasonable, just not bargain.
4. The Garage serves food (but we didn't try any).
5. The Garage beer selection is not even close to Whining Pig's.

Overall, I like it. Just wish it was a little cheaper and a little busier.

Also, note to management: maybe you could use some more 'garage-y' decorations. Might liven it up a little, give it a little more personality."}
{"text":"Service and ambiance were great.  Prices were in line with what is expected for a sports bar.  Portions were generous.  Only downside is the food is quite oily."}
{"text":"Tried this place for \"brunch\" today and it was a disappointment. The cream for my coffee was curdled as it poured out of the cup they serve it in but we pushed on and moved to our Chilaquiles and Chicken and French toast. 

The Chilaquiles had all the ingredients but were stale and unimpressive. My husband's chicken was dry and the side of breakfast potatoes was barely cooked. 

The service was also not very attentive since the bartender was multi-tasking as server... I'd suggest some great attention to food details as well as making sure your food is fresher and fully cooked."}
{"text":"Visited with a few friends on Thanksgiving weekend. Location is great, parking is a nightmare. We had planned to go to The Vig across the street and there was no parking so we left. Came here and we luckily found two spots after circling the building 2 times. Would not have done it a third time. 

Service was friendly and relaxed. The food was typical American bar fare. Not bad, but nothing special that would make you want to go back. The patio is on a super busy street and it is fairly loud, and a bit hard to have a conversation. The inside seems nice with the fireplace and garage doors that open up. 

Would I go back? If I was in the neighborhood and there was parking, sure. Would not go out of my way and make it a destination to visit."}
{"text":"A couple things:
Our bartender was prompt, knowledgeable, and attentive. hooray.
We had HH beers, which were nice and cold.
The atmosphere is new and clean, kind of a standard new-style pub/bar
And now to the music.  I must be the only one who is totally turned off by a silent restaurant/bar because SO MANY in the valley have overlooked this aspect of ambiance.  Please turn the music up.  I don't want to hear what the chefs are talking about.  Other than that, not bad.  Rating is on beer and service only since we didnt eat"}
{"text":"Bloody Mary's are to die for (weekend brunch).  Decent draft options. Never been here for happy hour.  Food prices are sort of expensive for the food offered. No doubt though this place has a ton of potential. We'll keep coming back."}
{"text":"Meat Lover's Flat Bread:
Juicy taste to be fed
Like a fix from a med
Satisfies my redhead.

Big-bite Waffle Fries:
Side order I advise
Getting it would be wise
Top-notch fries? It complies.
 
Seasoned Shrimp Flat Bread:
Burnt edges make it dead
Lack of flavor that I dread
Get the Lamb Chops instead.

Fat Burger is real nice:
Seasoned well with lots of spice
I would eat it trice times trice
Def...a culinary vice.

Service is really slow:
Inattention has to go
Staff's distracted, you should know
Needs to get a better flow.

Lamb Chops are the best:
Chimichurri? I'm impressed.
Super flavor, I attest.
Tender goodness, I'm obsessed."}
{"text":"Solid spot for happy hour.  Was able to get a table outside and the service was pretty good.  Parking was a bit of a pain but the nachos were great."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and ambiance. Unique building. Food was good, but not great. Friends had their choice of beers and drinks. Everyone was happy with their beverages as well as the conversation. Great place to hangout."}
{"text":"I would love to be writing a great review of this place.  Unfortunately, this is not a good one and I cannot even review the food since we didn't even get that far..

We were seated and waited for about 20 minutes with no service.  We then went up and approached the hostess and told her no one had come to our table yet.  She said she would send someone over right away.  There were plenty of servers yet no one had stopped at our table and it wasn't even a full house.  At that point after 30 minutes of no service we decided to leave. 
THE END."}
{"text":"The service was appalling. They left us on the back patio and forgot about us.  When something was said, they didn't seem to care.  We left and went to Phoenix City Grill."}
{"text":"Pretty good place for dinner. Not among my favorites, but I'd never say \"no\" to coming here if someone wanted to try it. Nice atmosphere. Friendly service. Tasty food. I'd expect this place to be busier. Z'tajas across the street is always packed, but Garage is WAY better."}
{"text":"The vibe of Garage is awesome...high ceilings, exposed brick, dark furniture, and an awesome fireplace. I went there last weekend for a little Sunday Funday mimosa action and wasn't disappointed. The crowd was minimal and our server was attentive. I went New Year's Eve with some friends for a few before our next destination and Casey was awesome! Made the best dirty martini and was super friendly. 

Garage, I'm determined to give you 5 starts but alas, I can only give you 4 based on the fact that I haven't tried your food yet! Don't you worry, though, I'll be back soon enough."}
{"text":"Happy that this place opened up!  Burgers are amazing...and their horseradish pickles (guessing boarshead brand) are a great addition to the meal.  Havent had anything other than beer to drink, but the Trippel that they have on tap is awesome.  Its pretty rare to see a Trippel on tap.  A great place to go any night and grab a drink.  The fireplaces are a great mood setter and the staff has been great every time I have gone there.  Giving it a 5 because I can walk here, love the the beers on tap and bottle, and food was great!"}
{"text":"Lovely bar in North Phoenix. I was going to say 'little' but it is actually deceptively enormous, going back a long way inside. Very friendly staff and good atmosphere, but not too many vegetarian options. My friend Sage dragged me over here for dinner, so I had to try it. I now live in the north side of town, so this place is convenient. I ordered the grilled Harvarti sandwich paired with Tomato basil soup. The sandwich was good, but I think the soup was warmed in the microwave because the bowl was too hot. The decor is kinda cool though, colorful lighted tires and bar paraphernalia that I am simply not expert enough to do justice to in my description. Parking is not easy, but if you drink you really shouldn't drive."}
{"text":"We are new to the neighborhood so we wanted to give the Garage a try. We both had burgers and he had an iced tea and the bill was over $30. Close to $40 after tip. For 2 burgers, no alcohol, we would have been better off going to The Habit for half the cost. Not sure we will be back. Way too expensive for what you get. Maybe Happy Hour is better..."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. The customer service was great in the beginning, the waitress brought my dog a bowl of water, cleaned our table and brought us water. We asked for one more minute to make our order then she never came back. (?) We waited for more than 10 minutes and no one came out. It was not even busy! They just forgot about us!!! After waiting a little bit more we just decided to leave. The was the first time taking my dog out to a pet friendly bar and he was disappointed as well. He was really looking forward to it."}
{"text":"The team here was so great organizing and executing a wine tasting for my group.  They were great with our larger group, and organized a special menu just for our group!  Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"We made it twice to \"The Garage\" and were easily converted into big fans!  

One of the best things about the place was the ambiance and decor.  The cool layout made us feel like we were in a very cozy and long established bar.  

Like some other Yelpers, one of the things we like to do is check out the bathroom in new places!  The \"garage paraphernalia\" tucked into the walls and the industrial sink are some pretty cool touches.  Think modern man bathroom...with class! :)  Kesha should shoot a video here!

As far as the food and drinks go, we were equally pleased.  We sampled the wings (Chili Claypot...fantastic!), the sweet potato fries, the chopped wedge salad, the meat lovers flatbread, and the bratwurst.  While the bratwurst was very tasty, I was hoping for a big ol' uber-bratwurst.  The rest of the food we had was way above average.  The food definitely seemed dialed in.  Both times we went (more happy hour excursions) our order was quickly delivered....and quickly consumed.

The drinks were a steal too!  The tap selection was very eclectic and if you like Jack & Coke, try their well-whiskey.  Very tasty!  The Mrs. went with a Bacardi (well-rum) & Diet.  Getting back to the beer though...try the Steigel!  If you like Stella Artois, you will love this one.  

This is going to be a frequent spot for us and gives us one more reason to wish we lived in the neighborhood.  This is at least a 4 1/2 star place!

Note:  On our last visit, we had the good fortune of meeting the owner, Ted.  Ted's character comes out in his bar.  He seems like a laid back, enjoy life kind of guy.  We truly enjoyed our time sitting and chatting with him at the bar."}
{"text":"I've been passing by this interesting looking place every few weeks as I travel between up and down town. I finally gave it a shot during their reverse happy hour. The regular happy hour is 4-7 and reverse is 10- close. 

During happy hour theres half price starters and some discounts on drinks. If your looking for something thats a great value the Garage is perfect. No where else can you find great items like 4 medium sized lamb chops, or a giant cheese and meat plate for 7$ each, really cool and good for the price.

We also wanted to balance our our meal with some sides which were about 5$ each, generally you get bland sides at happy hours or many bar / restaurant combos but these were unique and tastefully done. The lemon risotto was executed well but could have used a little seasoning, the mac & cheese was technically perfect. The blend of pastas was done really well, the creamy sauce held up and didnt turn into a giant heavy block like a lot of mac & cheese does. 

Overall i'd recommend this place to anyone looking for good food at a good price. Perfect if your looking to unwind or looking to find a good date spot without breaking the bank."}
{"text":"Good happy hour and dinner place in my neighborhood.  Looking forward to cooler weather so I can eat outside here again.

-Good beer selection
-Great wings
-Tasty flatbread pizzas"}
{"text":"Great place for a ladies lunch and glass of wine on an outdoor patio in the middle of December in Phoenix.  Environment great.  Food great.  Gal pals had the burgers and they were presented beautifully.  I had the Asian salad and found it to be so flavorful that I kept eating even after the sweet and sour chicken was gone.  Wine was a plentiful pour for loosening tongues.  It's also on a wonderful social corner with other restaurants and bars for bar hopping.  Now the downside...servers really young and sweet but not 100% accurate.  Waitress did not write down our orders which had a lot of details.  One of the ladies ordered a very rare burger but it came out medium.  No salt or pepper on table.  No ketchup, mayo or mustard offered.  Had to find the waitress.  Management needs to mystery shop their customer service and train some more.  I will return."}
{"text":"We went here after seeing them featured on Check Please. Because I don't eat meat I always view a restaurants website before venturing out to see if there is anything on the menu for me. I dropped the ball and didn't do that this time.

Cheese quesadilla-boring. Cheese, a tomato and green onion here and there does not make a good quesadilla. The spicy dipping sauce was the best part.

Grilled cheese sandwich-boring. I was hoping for an adult spin on a classic sandwich, didn't  happen.

Chili cheese dog-I think it was okay. My husband wasn't too disappointed.

With all the fabulous restaurants in and around Central Phoenix, there is simply no reason for us to return here."}
{"text":"My watering hole. Upscale sports bar or as they call it \"The Garage.\" I dig this spot, I think you will too. Super clean, very nice staff, laid back, really just a solid place for drinks, grub and to catch a game or live music on Saturday nights....Cheers!"}
{"text":"Tonight was my 2nd trip to this restaurant.  I went several weeks ago for lunch.  They had advertised a lunch special on Facebook but when I got there was told it was for the previous day but they would try to make it for my anyway.  It was a pasta covered in some kind of green sauce which was yummy.  I had wanted to try their bread pudding but they were out of it so I got a piece of chocolate cake.  It was the largest piece of cake I ever saw.  Had to take it home to finish it and should probably waited to finish it the next day as it was just too much chocolate for me and I did not feel good the next day but I must say the cake was delicious.
Tonight 2 friends took me there for my birthday.  We had appetizers of lamb chops, flat bread with barbequed chicken which were quite good except the lamp could have been cooked a bit longer.  I got the special of some kind of chicken fettucine.  My friends had chicken salad.  At the end of my meal I got the bread pudding and I must admit it was the BEST I have ever had.  It even beats the ones I make."}
{"text":"I gotta 5 stars this place. I went twice since I moved back to AZ in late-January, and botrh experinces have been awesome. Super cool wait staff AND the food has been amazing. Their flatbreads are yummy. My kids like it there too."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night.  No energy at all.  Got a dirty look from the manager when we walked in (she was on her phone all night in front of everyone).  One of the servers spit in the garbage can in front of us.  The cook was creeping everyone out oggling the women in the restaurant.  The drain in the bar smelled like sewage.  I hate this place.  Beer needed to be colder too."}
{"text":"I'm adding one star for the patio, because it's a pretty awesome patio, despite the temperature the day I visited.

I had the chorizo and eggs breakfast.

Pretty good, but not great or amazing.

I gather this would be a more enjoyable place for an evening of beer drinking. I'll have to come back for that sometime."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and  I were sitting around this past Sunday afternoon, the weather was great and it was just a perfect day for a burger and a beer. So I go through my list of foodie options Delux...no, The Grind....no too dark....Relish not that nice of a day...The Garage! 

Now I had been to the garage when it first opened a while ago and had a great experience. I remember the food being delicious, the vibe being cool and the beers being cold. What more could you want?!

So we make our way over there and it is relatively busy  but we don't have to wait for a table outside, so far so good. We get greeted by our server quickly for our drink order. Still not disappointing Garage lets keep this going.....

Now this is where the wheels fall off the cart, relatively. Once we get our drinks it takes our waiter another 20 minutes to take our order. Then it takes another 30 minutes to get our two medium done burgers. The burger wasn't as good as I remember the patty was cooked well but the bun was super dry. I got half steak fries half onion rings as a side both were good. 

So overall it was the service that hurt the Garage, there are a lot of burger joint choices in town this one probably would stay in my bullpen and rarely make the starting rotation..."}
{"text":"This house used to be a greasy auto shop now a restored modern-industrial gastropub located in the heart of trendy Uptown. I think I even remember Ladmo's next door.  Anyway we were there for happy hour and ordered the lamb chops and the cheese and nut charcuterie. What an excellent little meal. The beer and wine were perfect compliments.

On Wednesday Wine Maintenance, they had a great selection of six wines to taste this round. For ten dollars you got to sip wine that ranged from $15 to $60 a bottle. 

The house has two cozy patios. I sat on the back patio next to a fire, speaking with the gal from the wine distributors and the manager, both very enjoyable."}
{"text":"Honestly, not my favorite place. Came here for food and I really didn't like the chicken fingers I got. They were pretty tough and made me sick later that night. The fries were fantastic though! I would come back just for the fries, but not really for anything else based on this first time here. I take that back - the pizza cookie was fantastic."}
{"text":"I live in the neighborhood so was hoping this place was going to be a good new local spot and am pleased to say it is.  Nice beer selection and well above average bar/comfort food.  The service was relaxed, friendly and efficient.  Well laid out interior with large bar, table or comfy booth seating.  All the food we tried got the thumbs up and included some excellent deviled eggs, mac n cheese, a cup of their chili and the house burger.  The outdoor patio will be a sweet option in good weather.  Would recommend for drinks and/or a low key meal."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood place! It has nice patio seating as well as inside. Great burgers and beer and an all-around fun place to go with friends to hang out. Parking is not always easy especially if it is crowded."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, good selection of beers on tap, and interesting appetizers. Try the deviled eggs, which are unlike any others I've had, since they feature truffle oil and BACON! I'll be back."}
{"text":"It's been a while since we've been here eating and drinking. Tonight is simple with burgers and cocktails. Tony is our server once again and always does a fantastic job. The Garage is really a great place with top notch drinks and fantastic food."}
{"text":"This review is long overdue.  I've been coming to the Garage for several years. This will stop. Walking distance to home and Sunday Ticket are no longer reason enough to return.  The food is average to slightly above average.  Same with the beers.  Being a hophead, I'm disappointed at the lack of the IPA tap rotation; its always Bells Two Hearted Ale.  I always seem to have the same two or three servers/bartenders.  The Hispanic guy with the gold chain and the neck tattoo ROCKS.  He is on top of his game and knows his stuff.  He's friendly and cracks jokes and is just fun to be around.  That's about the only good thing I can say about the service here.  The blonde male bartender musician who wear skinny jeans and has tattoos is cranky and acts like he is put out by the customer.  I have overheard him talk about how hungover he is/was, and I've also seen him more interested in playing grab ass with the other female employee and or dick around on his cell phone.  He does not work his bar well.  You have to constantly get his attention for service..he does not come to you.  I think his face would literally fall OFF if he were to smile.  

The straw that broke the camel's back was the other night.  The place was dead.  There were two tables seated on the patio and no one at the bar, yet the service was abysmal.  To the point we never got a chance to order because well, we never had the opportunity/got so tired of waiting.  The drinks took long enough (same cranky bartender who couldn't be bothered), I can only imagine how long the food would have taken.  We left without ordering food.  Half of our group walked across the street to Z Tejas and the other half hit the Taco Bell drive through.  I saved their group text as a demonstration of just how bad the Garage was/has become. The online reviews don't allow for photo posting so here is what their text said:
John:  We went to taco bell on the way home and the service was better than the Garage.
Jill:  We went to taco bell and their service was great (plus two emojis of tacos). 


 If your employees don't want to be there, maybe they should be relieved of their duties and management should find someone who at least somewhat embraces the art of customer service and friendliness."}
{"text":"Will Return, tried the Flatbread AND sweet potato fries and they were good. Ambiance and actual design of the place, Just mediocre. The price was good, food was good and I believe they have a full bar."}
{"text":"I walked into Garage on Saturday night around 8:45 after I was unsuccessful in my attempt to find a seat at either of the bars at Rokerij. There was a spot at the bar, and I was happy to be checking out Garage after passing by it a few times.

I liked the vibe right away--the exposed brick, simple layout, understated bar, working fireplace, patio seating, happy-seeming people in conversation, friendly bartender who greeted me.

I ignored the full bar when I saw that the six beers on tap offered all I needed for the night. There were a couple that I had never heard of (imports) and as much as I wanted to explore, I had to go with the Vanilla Porter from Breckenridge Brewery. I was in the mood for a burger and thought that it would be a worthy pairing (it was). Unfortunately, the burger didn't pull its weight.

The Garage Burger is a fairly straightforward offering - Bibb lettuce, tomato, caramelized onions, a few pickles slices (with a touch of horseradish), applewood-smoked bacon, and cheese. I skipped the cheese, and ordered it medium rare with sweet potato fries and waffle fries. (The attentive and accommodating bartender suggested I go 50/50 between the two. She recommended the sweet potato fries, but I was a bit hesitant as everyone today seems to be serving them and not everyone does it well.)

When the plate arrived, I went after the sweet potato fries and was very happy with them. Top notch, top notch. I picked up the burger and had a good first bite: bacon, lettuce, beef, bun (probably not in that order). Unfortunately, the first bite was the best. The bottom half of the bun was quick to give way, and before too long, a few substantial pieces of the patty had fallen onto the plate. I got a good look at a few of the renegade burger bits and saw that the burger had taken on too much heat; it was a few seconds beyond medium (and well beyond medium rare). I also remembered that I had ordered waffle fries and that the onion rings that were on my plate were a mistake. That's not a deal-breaker for me, but the limp rings with a soggy coating were. The o-rings had a prominent oniony flavor (yeah yeah, I know, just stay with me for a second): The onion ring tasted more like a raw onion than a deliciously battered and fried one. While that flavor was too strong, the burger patty was bland. It needed the bacon to have any real flavor, but the applewood notes dominated the burger. No wonder the bartender looked at me funny when I turned away the plate of condiments.

As much as I was underwhelmed and disappointed by the burger, I'm going to come back. I'll try one of the flatbreads and perhaps a salad before I shut the door on this Garage. And, let's end on a positive note--the men's room was worth checking out. The sink looks like it hasn't changed since grease monkeys scrubbed down with Lava. Various tools are set into the walls. But I didn't come here to hang out in the men's room.

I'll give it three stars, but I'm only using pen for the first two. I want to like it more, and I promise to try harder next time if the kitchen does too."}
{"text":"The food was good, atmosphere was nice. I liked the fact that there were large \"garage\" doors that would open up the front of the restaurant to the patio. Our waitress we had to keep looking for and tracking down she would disappear often and the bartender was texting on her phone quite often. I know it's a laid back environment, but you're working and I shouldn't see you going back and forth to your phone even if there is no one to serve."}
{"text":"This was my second time eating at Garage. I'm not a huge bar food fan, but this was a delightful surprise! 

Had the flat bread last time, and it was delicious. This time, had the deviled eggs to start with. The little slice of bacon on top added just the right amount of flavor. Really good. 

Continued with the goat cheese salad with blueberry yogart dressing, yummy! My companion had the Garage Burger, it was huge, and looked real tasty, served with a huge portion of waffle fries. 

Service was excellent, it was pretty quiet in there at 2pm on a Sunday. 

Will definitely return again."}
{"text":"Service was slow at the beginning but i found out later he's on work release from tent city.  So all is forgiven.  Good happy hour, cute place plus an elderly couple was making out by my friend's car when we left.  Good times!  PS i got a ride home, since hearing tent city dui stories made me not want to join anyone there..."}
{"text":"Chill spot for a Friday night. Didn't seem to have an issue getting a table for 8. We ordered beers and bottles of wine. The highlights were the nachos...the cheese board was just average.

I had a cup of tomato soup and a cup of the mac and cheese. It was good but nothing stood out and I didn't finish either. My husband loves their burgers and onion rings. Was told that the menu has changed a lot over the years with different option. The service was fine it was just a little tough to flag him down for the check as we were winding down and the restaurant was barely half full by the end of the night."}
{"text":"YAS! The perfect happy hour spot. Outside with umbrellas near the hustle and bustle. Glass of wine and some bomb food in hand ! Definitely recommend"}
{"text":"Great place, great food...but idk about the service.  One, no silverware, napkins or salt and pepper had to ask the waiter for everything,  he seem annoyed.

The garage fries was phenomenal!!!!!!! I ate those more than my entrée (roasted mushroom flatbread) .  Lolz 
By the way, my entrée came out cold.. :(

I don't know if I will come back to eat dinner here. But I will come back to have appetizer and wine.:))"}
{"text":"Just tried this place, nice atmosphere, food is fresh and taste delicious, a lot of young people hang out there, Saturday night live music for couple hours. We liked it there, good for dinner or just drinks and even for desert and cup of cofee!!!"}
{"text":"Happy Hour until 7pm- this is fantastic, many places end HH at 6pm so this was a nice bonus.  1/2 price appetizers as well.  We had the deviled eggs, lamb chops and chicken wings.  It was a lot of food with a lot of great flavors!  The lamb chops were delicious, cooked perfectly and had the perfect amount of seasoning.  

The crowd for a Tuesday was mellow, there was live music.  

A great spot for a meal or just drinks.  The Garage may be one of my new favorite picks!"}
{"text":"I'd prefer to give no stars. Had dinner with a friend last night @The Garage. It was my suggestion because, the atmosphere is pretty kick back. Our server was great and our table was attended to. I ordered the \"street tacos.\" They were spicy but, after my second taco (I eat slow) I got an upset stomach. Literally, a half hour later I threw up. I had a vanilla porter that I'd had before. Had to have my friend take me home- threw up for hours. The next day, I called management to advise and Kristen who said she was the manager said so, yeah, sorry that happened to you. I've never heard of that happening. Hopefully, my call prompts The Garage to evaluate what caused this to happen. Felt like I was gonna die. I mentioned to my friend before going that there were 35 negative reviews. My advise- read the warnings before consumption. They ain't no lie. Next time OHSO or The Rokerij."}
{"text":"We went between 3-5 on a weekday, so we had no problem with a table or crowds. The staff was friendly, and the food was good. My friend had a burger, and I had a shrimp special. Plenty of food for your money, with leftovers for another meal!. Great selection of beers too! I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Slow and horrible service.  40 mins to take our order and no silverware. This is not looking good.  Grrr"}
{"text":"The food here is pretty good. I had a chicken sandwich with a side salad. Everything was very fresh and tasted great. The prices were slightly high in my opinion but perhaps that's just how things are in this area. We had good service. Not sure I really get their theme. I guess there were a few scattered \"garage/car\" things around but overall pretty plain inside. Very clean and new looking however. I bet when the weather is nice their patio is cool because they have the two huge garage doors to open it, hence the name?"}
{"text":"The BF and I went back here last night because he felt like a burger and it was 9 o clock and we didn't want fast food, so this place came to mind, despite the fact that it is far away from home. I was so impressed because our waiter, Casey, remembered us from the last time we were in and even remembered what was on special the night we came in..... it was kind of crazy, but I think it is so cool that a place like this has such good service. It was definitely unexpected. The BF got the burger again and he really loves it. He gets it with havarti cheese... it is good. I got a different special which was a flatbread with chicken, BBQ sauce, onion, bacon, cheese, and red jalapenos on it. This thing was good! It was spicy and sweet, which is a great combination, and the crust was very crispy, which gave it a nice texture. I also like that the bacon was there just to support the other flavors, it wasn't all about the bacon. I am not a bacon fan (despite being called crazy for this fact), so when I can eat something that just has a slight bacon flavor, that is perfect for me. The portions were large and the prices are pretty close to standard. Again, I would return.... this place has really impressed me."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner with a friend the other night, it was our first time here so of course we're excited. =)

So we started with the garage fries. Let me just say these are probably some of the best fries that I've ever had. They came with this chipotle dipping sauce which was amazing. I almost felt like I enjoyed these fries more than my meal. For my entree I got the garage burger. I didn't feel like it was anything special. I've definitely had better burgers. I got sweet potato fries but the garage fries are wayyyyy better. 

They have a cute little outdoor patio that you can sit at and enjoy the amazing weather right now. As far as customer service, it was extremely slow and disappointing. We had no silverware when we sat down, when we asked for some, for some strange reason the waitress only brought one set for my friend. Not sure if we were supposed to share it or what. 

Everything was pretty pricey as well. I probably won't come back during dinner but will definitely be coming back for happy hour to enjoy their fries and wine.  =)"}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere of this place, hip and modern but comfortable too. Service has always been good.

My only complaint was that after a recent menu change (a couple months ago, which was my last visit), a lot of what we ordered wasn't great. The chicken tender-type dish was way over cooked and my sandwich, while ok, was not what was described on the menu.

Wasn't thrilled with the last visit, but since I've been plenty of times before and been happy, I will be returning."}
{"text":"Nice spot for happy hour our server David was top notch I recommend this spot."}
{"text":"Great new North Central spot.
Nice bar and a good food menu in the location what used to be an old car garage.

Strong drinks and good looking food.
Good parking.
Lights a little bright in the mens room.

Can't wait to try all the stuff on the menu.
Thanks for putting a new spot in North Central."}
{"text":"Came here for happy hour with a bunch of my co-workers and let me just day, totally love this place!! Had the most uh-maze-inng roasted mushroom flatbread with goat cheese plus drizzled in truffle oil, delish!! 
For such a large group, our server was outstanding and on the ball. I live pretty close to this place and plan to come back again. Thanks Garage!"}
{"text":"The Garage is a great relaxed, yet hip, neighborhood spot to hang out and have a drink. The decor is unique and interesting and I love the fireplace. I really like that it's chill enough to have a conversation with your friends without having to yell. I'd definitely come back to try the food."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch today and I definitely liked what I saw/experienced.  It's a very cute place, with great customer service. The people were so nice!  I ordered the BLT, which comes on toasted challah bread, with waffle fries on the side. Yum!  My girlfriend had the sandwich special of the day, which was a chicken sandwich on marble rye, with sweet potato fries on the side.  She got hers on the toasted challah bread too, and she really enjoyed it!

I definitely want to check out this place for happy hour!"}
{"text":"stopped in for lunch to go. the waitress recommended the chicken sandwich. pretty much the worst chicken sandwich ever. won't be back. to bad as i love to support local businesses."}
{"text":"We stopped by a few months before and weren't grabbed by food or atmosphere so we thought we'd give it another shot tonight. We hit HH and had deviled eggs and the sliders, both very good and got two HH drinks each at the bar. Our server was very quick and efficient with everybody she had to serve but not once did she say, \"hello\", \"how was the food\", \"did you like that champagne you tried?\" Nothing to anyone even while sitting the drink down \"did you like the last one you tried?\" No words at all during the hour+ we sat at the bar. She was busy but near the end it calmed down and she stood at the end and didn't interact with anyone at the bar. One girl on the corner was having some sort of celebration and cheering when her drink came but Kim just set it down. No interaction. We were puzzled. She seemed very competent- like an accountant serving you!  I guess you can get friendly and slow service or good service but nothing coming out of the mouth.  We just except a couple friendly comment, not a chatter box.  Won't be back soon if she's at the bar."}
{"text":"Where is my half-star on this one.

It is clear from some of the prvious reviews that this neighborhood place is making an impact on the neighborhood.  Is that too obvious?

Like several reviews before me, The Garage is walking distance from my home.  So, as I anxiously watched grow-up I was hoping it would give us an alternative to the Vig or other related spots.

I would like the 1/2 star on this because there are a few kinks that need to be worked out, but on style, astmosphere and most importantly earnestness, this place deserves the benefit of the doubt.  So 4 stars it is.

Likes:

Comfy and engaging seating for the bar and Patio.  The almost outside bar has a great feel no matter which side of it you sit on.  Service has been friendly and enthusiastic each time I have visited, and the staff truly seems to care about their new place.  That sort of sense of ownership is hard to come by.  The food is definatley tastey and I think their  much talked about burger is one of the best in town.  I told the bartender that it was the perfect balance of a juicy burger you would grill yourself at home, with all of the flavor and quality of a great restaurant burger.  Good stuff.   Location:  I already told you it was in my backyard.

Challenges:

I spoke of the bar and patio as hitting the mark.  The rest of the dining areas seems a bit confused to me.  The cozy booths along the back are nice, but leave me feeling detached and left out of the energy.   The calvalcade of smokers going out to the back smoking patio is also a bit busy. The dining area in front does the opposite, I feel out in the open and exposed.  Not sure what the solution is, but it keeps me at the bar or on the patio.   Everything I have eaten has been tastey, but lack of options and a little priciness keeps me from going back as much as I might.  I want this to be my neighborhood bar, but those things keep me from being too regular.  

All of this not-with-standing 4 stars it is.  There is pride in the place, and they seem to really care about quality.  I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"I've only been for brunch + to catch some football on the weekend, but the $5 champagne cocktails + bloody mary's are delicious!"}
{"text":"First of all I did not try the food. I attempted to order these deviled eggs last night (I'm having a huge craving), but they were sold out. I tried to reorder today at 3 pm and as soon as I placed my order, doordash called and let the phone ring one time. I'm thinking I bet they're out of the eggs again... let me call the restaurant and check. Now comes the part where I will never give this place one cent of my money. When I call a woman answers and I explain that I just placed an order with door dash but missed their call \"is an item missing\" I asked. In the nastiest tone she could muster she said \"No I told them and I'm telling you we are not doing pick up today!\" I asked her \"To clarify just doordash or any pickup?\" She then says \"Nope we're not doing pickup today.\" To which I replied \"Ooh you have an attitude. Enjoy your day.\" and hung up. Not sure what she was going through but I was taken aback at her tone. It's a shame too because the eggs sounded so good I tried to order 2...one for now and one for later lol!"}
{"text":"Real nice neighborhood restaurant. Always happy with what I order. Love the nachos!! Cool live bands and friendly wait staff."}
{"text":"Garage Wine and Tap is on a great corner in Phoenix!  16th Street and Bethany Home.  You have small shops and this corner is home to two uber popular restaurant chains and a locally beloved restaurant close by on 16th street.  That's a tough corner to be on for a restaurant!  But then again, all of the traffic to the other place may work in its favor.

Garage is located in the western corner of a strip of stores on the North West Corner of 16 & Bethany Home.  There's a big sign out front and you can't miss it.  Just be mindful of that parking lot because there is little space to turn your car around.  Parking was easy enough at noon on a Sunday.  

I went here with a close friend to catch and chat over brunch.  This restaurant has a nice space and is interesting and inviting.  A nice big bar is the center focus of the room... one would need plenty of space for all that Wine and Tap, for sure!  

I ordered a Chorizo and Egg scramble with a side of french fries to go with my brunch.  Who could resist the $5 Bloody Mary that they dangle in front of you like a big tease.  I am sorry to say that I did not enjoy the egg scramble at all.  I was not appealing to the eye or the palate.  I was disappointed and couldn't eat it.  But the fries worked out well for my hunger.

Bloody Mary to the rescue though.  Whoot whoot.  Get me another one of those!  That baby was delicious.  

Return Factor: 10%
so many places to see and experience, I probably won't return.  :-("}
{"text":"This place has decent food and tasty drinks but the pricing seems marginally high.  The atmosphere feels slightly contrived but overall a good experience each time we have been there.  The servers and bartenders are nice as well."}
