{"text":"Friendly service. Great overall fitness concept that I would totally be a part of if I lived in Phoenix. Smoothies we tried were delicious and filling and plan to stop by again on our way back to the airport."}
{"text":"A co-worker introduced this place to me over lunch one day...I have been going there daily ever since. Awesome protein shakes with tons of flavors to choose from including blueberry lemon cheesecake (yum), snickers, french toast, apple crisp (the list goes on and on).  I agree with another reviewer that you can taste the protein powder but it is not overpowering and does not bother me. The shake has 24 grams of protein plus fiber and is under 250 calories. The shakes are $7 and come with a separate iced tea as well. Great place."}
{"text":"Love this place. I went to one like it back home and it took me forever to find one when I came to Arizona for college! Great shakes and super great people!"}
{"text":"Great environment!! Love walking inside and being welcomed so kindly! Great place to do homework and have delicious smoothies. I go in almost every week and have never had a smoothie I didn't love. Great environment and I highly recommend trying it! Plus, the owner Steve is amazing! He really knows about the products and can direct you to what you are looking for! Love this place!!!"}
{"text":"Found this place while searching for a place that offered an açaí bowl. After conversing with Steve, I elected to go with the banana French toast smoothie. Very nutritional and had a great taste. It came with a free tea, in which I elected to get the peach. 

Not sure why some low ratings from consumers, but my guess would be that they haven't tried many protein shakes in the past.

I travel to PHX often and will adding this spot to my rotation for healthy food."}
{"text":"Powered up Nutrition is the best place to go for a healthy meal replacement shake!  50 flavors...all delicious!! Shannon Richards and her staff make you feel welcome as soon as you walk in the door.  PUN..total awesomeness. Love it."}
{"text":"Highly misinformed nutritional information. The menu reads like a list of the worst possible foods for your body, and the shakes don't contain actual whole ingredients. You know, like fruits and vegetables. They give you a 'weight loss tea' with your 'smoothie', both are made from a powder and (or) flavor syrups. I ordered the Orange Julius, which I thought might have some semblance of fruit flavor...it did not. The 'smoothie' was grainy, artificial tasting and unfulfilling. There is nothing in the Herbalife powder they use, that offers any real nutritional benefit. Just another method of hocking an ineffective product and furthering a well known MLM pyramid, which is almost as unsavory as the shakes/teas themselves. $7 for a junk, powdered shake that bloats you, doesn't even taste like real food and offers no real nutritional benefit? No thank you!!"}
{"text":"Awesome! Not much of a shake guy but Steve made me a Butterfinger shake and it was great! The atmosphere here is also very inviting for those people who are not a fitness buff. Check it out!"}
{"text":"Great shake, great atmosphere and great people! This is a great place to go to for support for any/all of your nutritional needs. Whether your looking to lose weight or just maintain a healthy diet, Powered Up has staff that can help you learn more about what works for you.

Who would've thought a meal replacement shake could be healthy AND delicious!"}
{"text":"If you are used to protein smoothies like I am then you probably won't like this place. I was expecting a smoothie like drink when I ordered the very berry day shake. I gave this place a second shot and tried the peanut butter chocolate shake because you can never go wrong with mixing that and protein. It was totally drinkable but the texture of the powder is still there. There are different alternatives I would rather take when it comes to consuming my protein which is why I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Great smoothie flavors! Love that there are so many different options. They also have fitness classes!"}
{"text":"The worst smoothie I ever had, the texture was disgusting, to much powder and the taste was bad, we got a strawberry cheesecake and also we got a tea with it both were bad, they should make it more fruity more natural. I'm sorry but we just tried it and throw it away :/

El peor smoothie que he probado, la textura era desagradable, arenosa y el sabor era muy malo, compramos el fresa con cheesecake y también nos dieron un té, pero los dos eran malos, deberían hacerlos con fruta o un sabor más natural. Lo siento pero solo los probamos y los tiramos a la basura."}
{"text":"Slightly disappointed on our visit today. A co-worker and I were approached a couple weeks ago by one of your street-team marketing members with a voucher for free smoothies. We went in today to redeem the vouchers and were advised that if it wasn't our first visit that we couldn't get the smoothie but a tea would be the substitute. While I'm appreciative of the tea, I was very disappointed that the voucher was not honored. No where on the card did it state for first time visitors only. False verbiage or failure to provide all the information is probably one of my biggest marketing pet peeves, especially since I work in this field. Just some constructive criticism to pass on: 1) update the verbiage to be more upfront about the offer 2) Honor your marketing collateral. Your employee admitted that it should be better stated and something that needs to be addressed. What's unfortunate, is that I probably would have been a frequent visitor, but looks like I will stick to bringing in my own protein powder and making it at work."}
{"text":"I just paid $10 for the WORST acai bowl of my life. Tastes like fake flavoring and its gritty/chalky. Doesn't taste anything like acai. Super disappointing :("}
{"text":"Steve was great, very helpful on the best health and diet tricks. Even recommended a book to me that I've now started to follow and feel the difference in my daily routine. I'm pretty skeptical when It comes to diets and usually don't stick with things but since I do not get groggy at 2 PM every day I found myself sticking to this one. They have lots of options with great selection here and it's a great big location just west of the AMC theater.  Very clean in a relaxing place to just hang out, he's got free Wi-Fi and welcomes people to stick around and have conversation. Highly recommend checking this place out if you're in the downtown area or looking for a nutritional guru to talk to."}
{"text":"BEST. PLACE. EVER! A must place to go in downtown Phoenix. The staff members are some of the nicest people around in Arizona. They really care about wellness and making their customers happy. The staff members will ask you how your day is going and make sure you are getting the best possible service around! You have to get the Thin mint smoothie, it taste just like the cookies."}
{"text":"I love going to this place, even though I don't go as often as I should. The staff has always been extremely friendly and it was only a few visits before they new me by name. To all the people talking shit.. if you don't like it, don't go but if you just want to complain for the sake of complaining then boo you. Honestly, I like the shakes and teas and I love getting my body fat measured. If you have the time stop by and give it a try!"}
{"text":"I love ice cream and sweet treats! These shakes satisfy that craving and I dont have to feel guilty! Love this place."}
{"text":"I have class near this this place so I checked it out and picked up a protein smoothie. The second I walked in the staff was extremely friendly and helped me out on my order. I picked the Elvis shake, which had peanut butter and banana flavors- tasted amazing! I will be back again, maybe even for the fitness classes. The shakes additionally come with a separate ice tea, which was refreshing as well. Love this place and the service!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite healthy spot downtown. Every shake comes with a FREE tea!!! How great is that?! They taste incredible and are great for you!! It is a WIN WIN!! Anything banana is bomb.com! But there are over 50 flavors to pick from! Fun place to hang out and do homework too. Oh, and the staff are so amazing!! THANK YOU POWERED UP!!"}
{"text":"I was in town for a conference at the convention center and forgot to bring my protein powder. I'm really glad I found this place to help fill my daily protein goal. 

The staff is very friendly and answered my questions well. The number of available flavors is a little overwhelming, but I liked the ones I tried (strawberry banana and chocolate peanut butter banana). You can slightly taste the soy protein since they use a soy/whey protein blend, but it didn't bother me at all since I'm used to drinking protein powder shakes daily. They also include a thermogenic tea for free with the purchase of a shake, which is a nice touch. All in all I'll be sure to stop back if I'm ever back in Phoenix. Having a healthy breakfast alternative to bagels and coffee and the other areas things is great!"}
{"text":"I was looking for smoothie places after my workout and was sort of unsure about this place from the outside of it you couldn't see inside due to the windows being plastered with a white covering. I came inside and the place was like a smoothie spot that had a billion flavors that I was a bit overwhelmed. The owner was very welcoming and she told me all their smoothies were less than 250 calories or less! A choice of smoothie also came with a free tea, for a total of $7. I got the very berry smoothie and it was delicious! You could definitely taste the protein but that doesn't bother me, and the tea was unsweetened but was tasty! I would definitely come back here again."}
{"text":"Great shakes.  The staff is very helpful and positive, which is important for those trying to get in shape.  Being fat is pretty depressing and shameful and I know people don't always want to ask skinny people for advice.  It's better if they come forward and are sorta pushy with it.

They have plans and product offerings for weight loss and are very positive about it.

Also when they opened up, they gave out free shakes.  I told everybody at work about it and a few went and got the free shakes.  It was neat.

The protein shakes are pricey, but not when compared to a meal.  And if you buy their powder, that's surely cheaper than buying meals.  I'm so glad that there's a local place that will whip up an awesome protein smoothie for me."}
{"text":"I got a strawberry banana smoothie. It came with a free tea. The smoothie tasted like powder and it tasted gross.

I'm pretty sure they put Herbalife powder in all the smoothies. They don't ask if you want the powder in the smoothie.

I threw the smoothie out after I had a couple sips."}
{"text":"I have been waiting for healthy food options in the Downtown area for quite some time. While walking through Arizona Center, I noticed Powered Up Nutrition and I thought I would give it a try. The employees introduced me to the owner and I was shocked by her kindness and genuine desire to please her customers.

Powered Up Nutrition specializes in meal-replacement smoothies and offered more than 50 varieties. The menu board is overwhelming but the employees offered me mini samples in order to figure out what I wanted. I decided on Blueberry Lemon Cheesecake. Now I am skeptical of protein drinks. They are often so flavorless, chalky and never fill me up. I was amazed at how wonderful the smoothy tasted. I was not expecting it to be as good as an ice cream shake! 

At any rate, the smoothy was filling and yummy and under 250 calories, yet has 24 grams of protein. It left me with a full feeling until I got home from work. 

I noticed that they also offer free morning/evening yoga, abs & booty, and other fitness classes along with weekend group runs/hikes. I'm a believer!"}
