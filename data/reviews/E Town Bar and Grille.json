{"text":"had one of the best lunches ever for take out yesterday....keep up the good work,burger was awesome and chicken was perfect ,thank you"}
{"text":"We were looking for a good fish sandwich so I googled best fish sandwiches in pittsburgh and Etown  came up so we gave it a try! This was the best fish sandwich I've eaten. The restaurant is quaint with a nice bar. Prices are wonderful! We will definately return."}
{"text":"This place makes great burgers and wings. I'm always  bragging about the food and always try to stop when in the area.The people are friendly and services are good, but the thing I love most is their coleslaw,it's the best I've ever tasted,I mean it taste so good I ask for seconds. Coleslaw's a side dish but I'd love to get the recipe!"}
{"text":"Get the Fish.  Love the Fish. Must be the Fish.  
I've always had a great meal there, you cant go wrong with E Town.  It's small, but nice."}
{"text":"Good food and really nice people! Thanks for going out of your way and making the fish sandwiches special for my aunt and grandma! They said they were really great and my brother really liked the Italian roast beef and sausage."}
{"text":"The fish sandwich that I had was the best ever! The only problem I had was the staff which was disappointing since I had spent a lot of money. I'm still going to go back but I'm hoping that they were all just having a bad day. Especially when walking in a bar, I should feel welcome and invited. Instead I felt that since we weren't regulars we weren't welcome. I saw about 8 different employees and only one said anything kind and that was when we were walking out. This will only be a Friday take out experience for us. We will not go to sit and have a meal not even a drink."}
{"text":"Excellent fish sandwich, which they are know all over Pittsburgh for.  Staff is very friendly and the prices are fair on all of their food."}
{"text":"This place is an under rated gem. Everything on the menu is good and the Fish Sandwiches and Burgers are excellent. Wait staff and bar tenders are always on top of their game and everything is very reasonably priced. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Love their fish and lent menu. Also they have great burgers.  Can't go wrong with anything ,really, on the menu."}
{"text":"We went on a Friday to try the fish sandwich. I got mine with lettuce and tartar along with onion rings and coleslaw and a side of 5 garlic parm wings, she had fries with hers. 

The fish was not only massive, it was good. A lighter batter than most places, cooked right, not oily. The bun held up to the end and didn't crumble in mid-meal while trying to squeeze that massive sandwich in my mouth. The coleslaw was crisp and tangy with the right amount of moisture. The onion rings were typical, no problems and a good-sized serving.

The wings were good - crispy outside and moist on the inside. The garlic was on the light side, not overpowering. Not the biggest wings I've ever had, but not the smallest either. Pretty typical.

We went a little before 5 PM so it wasn't very crowded initially but by the time we left it was filling up. I was satisfied with the service, didn't have to ask for anything that was forgotten. Didn't try any of the beers so can't speak to that.

It's a neighborhood place, expect to be called \"hon\". Makes you feel welcome. Parking is on the street and not abundant.

Overall a good experience and will return."}
{"text":"Yes, E Town does indeed make a mean fish sanwhich. After my recent disappointment with Coleman's in Wheeling, was prepared to be let down here. Not to be! Really flaky, fresh tasting fried fliets (you get two, and they are huge). Batter is light and flavorful. Tartar sauce is great.....old corner bar atmosphere in a stuck in time little hood called Etna. Definitely will return next time in town."}
{"text":"Huge fish sandwich, not too greasy with bun on the side which is critical for takeout!  Surprisingly clean on the inside of this place too which is nice for a bar."}
{"text":"I walked into this place with some friends and wasn't sure what to expect. The location and parking situation isn't the best. You walk in and there is the bar area. Keep walking through to the back room and there are about 10 tables. We ordered the chicken finger platter. I have to say that it was the best chicken fingers I've ever had. The best way for me to describe it is like long john silver breading without any grease. This isn't something I would normally order, but I heard they were known for the fish and chicken so I had to try it. I got 5 large pieces of chicken, fries and coleslaw for $7.99. My daughter and I shared it and we still couldn't finish everything. The cost for the quantity and quality is amazing. I will 100% be back to eat the chicken."}
{"text":"The definition of an average fish sandwich. Mild in flavor, big but not ginormous, and not one hundred percent crispy yet not drenched in oil, I don't think this is the \"BEST\" fish sandwich in Pittsburgh or an amazing bang for your buck. The accompanying cole slaw and tartar were both mild and didn't add a particularly tangy flavor or or satisfying crunch. 

They do have a decent domestic bar and other  bar type items on the menu like wings and burgers. Street parking outside, a decent local place, not worth a special trip."}
{"text":"Great little dining room in the back- go for fish sandwiches.  Wait staff is super efficient and very friendly."}
{"text":"Always great service and food. Their fish sandwiches are amazing along with their chicken tenders. I always sit at the bar and the service is quick!"}
{"text":"One of the very best fried fish sandwiches in Pittsburgh and perhaps on this side of the pond.  On par with Pipers/Pub Chip Shop.  This sounds terrible, but I actually look forward to not eating meat now on Fridays during Lent if it means Etown.  

Their chicken tenders are quite delicious.  I've picked up platters of them when entertaining and they are always a hit!  There is never a single piece left, even (especially) when it's just a group of adults.  Affordable and excellent quality."}
{"text":"Alright...so either I was here on an off day (twice) or I am ordering the wrong thing!!! Both options are very good possibilities.
 
The first time we went was around this time last year.  Etown is literally a 3 minute drive from my house and Bobby was interested because he thought they probably used their meats from the butcher (whom he so loved before they just closed up shop recently) and really enjoyed his burger.  I think I ordered a side salad and a burger without the bun.  I assume they were both decent, but nothing so amazing that it left an imprint in my memory.

So last night on my way home from work, I called and ordered a takeout order of 10 wings and their taco bites.  I specifically asked for their wings (which are just skin-fried and non-breaded, yay!) to be cooked well so they were extra crispy.  I got there and it wasn't very busy and the girl had my order ready to go.  I contemplated a six-pack with their seasonal beers and they had a decent selection, but I opted against it.

The taco bites were different than I expected but they hit the spot! good flavor and I didn't even need the salsa or sour cream! The wings (hot ranch) had good flavor and were extremely meaty, but they almost seemed under-cooked which was a disappointment considering my special request.  They were to the point where the skin was unappealingly gummy.  I should have thrown them in the oven on high for a few minutes to crisp them up, but I was kind of turned off by the consistency so I ended up tossing them.

I will say that I have been here to drink a couple times and it is a great little local bar.  It has a good selection of liquors and beers and the bartenders are nice and attentive. I would totally be willing to give them another shot food-wise and definitely try the fish sandwich everyone raves about on here!  I'll update my rating if it is warranted when I do so."}
{"text":"Came here two Friday nights in a row for their Lenten dinner specials - yes, the fish sandwiches are THAT good. This place was packed both nights, and the number of take out orders leaving this restaurant was crazy! I couldn't believe how much food they were pumping out of that kitchen. I'm so glad this place is close - less than 10 minutes from our house - a solid neighborhood find. The service was friendly (although a bit slow as they were VERY busy on the Lenten Fridays we were there) and our food was good and came out hot. The fish was REALLY good and HUGE portions. The sandwich comes with two giant fillets, fries, coleslaw and a bun to make a sandwich with. I also tried the shrimp platter - it was generous too and the shrimp tasted good, was hot and was crispy being breaded in Panko. It was however, VERY greasy. I think I will stick to the fish as the Lenten dinners go. We tried the fried apps as well - hush puppies, jalapeno poppers and their house made cheese sticks. All of these were just OK - pretty clearly just freezer to fryer stuff, but it wasn't bad for the price. The house made cheese sticks were crispy on the outside - not breaded. They were also just OK. Other sides we tried were the mac and cheese and haluski. The mac and cheese was almost overwhelmingly buttery - more like  buttered macaroni noodles with some cheese, rather than a macaroni and cheese with a cheese sauce that may have had some butter in it. It was just OK - it was a lot of butter for me. The haluski was also OK, but pretty tasty. Definitely worth at least one Lenten Friday trip! We will be back to try their other \"non-Lenten\" dinner options soon enough, I'm sure. Always love a good neighborhood find!"}
{"text":"Best Fish sandwich in the Pittsburgh area. I go here on a regular basis."}
{"text":"Let's start by saying that E Town is a small place and from the front, you may not even think they serve food.  BUT this little \"Bar in the Front - Food in the Back\" joint is fantastic!  

When you arrive, you'll need to park on the street (like most all places in Pittsburgh) and you'll see their small, lit up, square sign hanging over the door.  Once you enter the door, you can walk straight back and find yourself a seat.

They always have great service by the hard working and friendly servers there.  And the food is awesome.  Mind you, it's not a 5 star restaurant, it's a bar and grille, so you'll find things on the menu like burgers, wings, and tasty appetizers.

The main stand out there is the fish sandwich.  It comes with 2 giant pieces of beautifully battered, fried to perfection fish.  Crispy and perfectly done every time.  And the prices can't be beat.

Try it out, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Seriously the best fish sandwich in town...period!  Not to mention the burgers are delicious!  The heart attack burger is to die for...no pun intended (fresh ground meat, ham, egg, bacon, and cheese).  The wings are also tasty and always cooked to perfection.  The staff is great and friendly!  The restaurant isn't super huge, so you may want to get there early on Lenten Fridays or on game days.  They also make take out orders!"}
{"text":"Won the award for Pittsburgh's best fish sandwich.  It's enormous.  Two fish sandwiches, really, which kind of makes it not fair, since all the other fish sandwich places must have only really been competing with half the fish of this place.

Great beer selection and the prices. . . let's just say you know you're not in the Pittsburgh city limits when you buy five craft beers and your bar tab ends up not cracking the $30 barrier.

Good wings, and huge burgers."}
{"text":"Outstanding little joint with friendly staff, fast service and great food. Their fish sandwich's are amazing, you really get your money's worth here.  This place is worth a visit when your in the area."}
{"text":"Great food great neighborhood bar, the food is really great and the service was just as.  Anytime I'm passing through the small town of Etna I try and stop here if I'm hungry for a bite to eat"}
{"text":"Food is outstanding, Service not so much. Had 3 tables arrive after us order after us and get their food and leave before our food ever arrived. 30 min for 1 app. another app arrived after everyone received their meals. took approx. 1 hour for our food to arrive."}
{"text":"Perfectly crisp golden-brown fried fish. And a lot of it. Shrimp are good too. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Ok, I hate to admit because this review might make the wait longer on Fridays, but this is the best fish sandwich I've ever had. We got takeout and they even wrapped the bun in foil so it would not get soggy on the drive home. The sides are good too. My new lent spot for sure!"}
{"text":"We came for the fish and were not disappointed. Generous portion too. We also ordered the fried pretzels thatvid served with honey mustard. When I asked for cheese sauce they happily brought me nacho cheese and it was OK. A nice beer cheese dip for pretzels would have been better. Still I liked the pretzels.
Fries were frozen -not fresh cut- but were OK. I'm a fry snob, so it's hard to please me there.
Coleslaw was not good.
We will be back and I'll try the wings."}
{"text":"We have been trying different top rated restaurants and bars in search of the best fish sandwich during lent over the past two years. This place went straight to the top of our list. Thanks to all of the other positive reviews we found E Town."}
{"text":"Delicious fish sandwiches and wraps. Good array of beer choices; draft and bottle. The bar area is small and not too crowded when the games are on, which is nice."}
{"text":"Thank you guys so much! I really appreciate you opening up the kitchen on Christmas Eve to make us your famous Fish sandwich! 

I didn't know what to get my 94 year old great aunt and 87 year old grandma for Christmas - but I know they love fish sandwiches - so I wanted to give them the best! I drove them all the way out from Derry  so they could try your fish sandwich - and they loved it!

Merry Christmas!"}
{"text":"It's official. ETOWN may very well offer the best fried fish in pittsburgh. While ETOWN is more a bar than restaurant, it is impeccably clean, bright and NS. Service is friendly, several beers on tap and daily specials. But fried fish is their thing, and they do it right. Flat fillets fried in a crunchy batter, drained from excess grease and served piping hot with tasty french fries and a small container of house made slaw. Fish sandwiches are served on a kaiser roll. 

I've been searching for Pittsburgh's best fried fish for 25 years.  I've narrowed it down to ETOWN for the traditional and Pipers Pub for the beer batter style. 

EAT LOTS OF FISH...."}
{"text":"Casual atmosphere, friendly staff, excellent food and reasonable prices.    We had the homemade mozzarella sticks.  They were crispy and delicious.   My son had the burger and fries and it was enough to fill him up, which is quite impressive.  I had the buffalo chicken salad.  Fried chicken breast, large green salad with fries and hard boiled eggs.  Wonderful salad.  Definitely check out this place."}
{"text":"This place is an awesome local bar. It's my favorite in the area. The service is great and the staff is friendly. Try their fish sandwich if it's your first time. I'm pretty sure it's one of the best in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"solid little place, really good burgers and fries. not that exciting selection of beers but if you aren't too picky it's more than fine.  Staff are super nice and personable . it's clean and not too loud at all."}
{"text":"The fish sandwich is OK... Thats it... Another mediocre bar with below average food.. Even for a bar. The burgers are bigger then average, 1/3 pound i believe, but they have no flavor really. Slow service, even when not busy."}
