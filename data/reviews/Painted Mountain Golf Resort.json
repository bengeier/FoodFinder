{"text":"Golfed Painted Mountain today. Painful. Over priced. Tee times so close together waited on every hole. All 18. Some holes 3 foursomes ahead of us. Should be a $40 track not $70"}
{"text":"What a terrible Thanksgiving! The service was the worst we have ever had. Service and Food was simply awful! 1-1/2 in of a sweet potato. Cold stuffing (a scoop the size of a melon ball, Dried out turkey that had crusted dried edges, cold and fatty. The mashed potatoes were so salty you couldn't eat them without having them burn your lips. We were never asked if we wanted coffee or offered pie! Which also was terrible. How does anyone ruin pumpkin pie! Terrible food terrible service! I understand holidays are busy,  clearly this organization can not handle it. They appear to price gauge. I will never recommend dining here to anyone!  Not only that, multiple members of our party were sick today! Thanks Painted Mountain! If you were trying to be the worst rest ever you succeeded!"}
{"text":"Great staff, excellent on course Marshall and cart girl!  The course was ok, very slow on back nine but not terrible.      Nice course... thanks"}
{"text":"I don't mind the heat at all. So I went today around 3:30. The course was dead,  So I went inside and asked if I could play a round. The employee told me they are wrapping up because nobody was golfing. The next thing he said was, \"sorry.\" I like the course,  but I'm done there. SUMMER IS SLOW, THEY SHOULD KNOW THAT."}
{"text":"We had a 40th wedding anniversary party there on Saturday in their small room. The food could not have been any better, the service was wonderful and they decorated the place where it took your breath away. The wonderful place to come for dinner are to have any kind of party. Thank you Dave and Linda for making it a super day."}
{"text":"Had a Really good time here dinner and kareoke? we're a blast the salmon was cooked perfectly and it's got a lot of good servers and energy. Salad bar could use a little more variety but other than that good place to eat and have fun"}
{"text":"Nice views of the golf course and mountains while dinning.  The food and the service lacked allot.   Living in the area we had out of town friends meet us for breakfast.  The menu was good.  Our guests arrived first and ordered coffee.  We waited for the wait staff to bring cups but ended up going to another table to get our own.  One of our party ordered chicken fried steak and was brought and charged for the more expensive steak.  Another asked for sour cream to accompany an omelette.  It never arrived.  Potatoes were absolutely stone cold.  the farmers scramble was rubber and nearly burnt on the bottom.  Since we were in a time crunch and the waitstaff never checked back we left with a totally unsatisfactory experience.  Should have gone to our neighborhood standby, Cozy Corner Cafe."}
{"text":"Wife & I stopped in for lunch approximately 1PM. We're promptly seated (only several tables occupied). Nice decor.  Waitress was very nice, explaining the special, etc. I ordered the grilled salmon on a brioche bun, wife ordered the fish & chips.  Both were excellent.  Can't think of any negatives. Service & food excellent. Prices reasonable."}
{"text":"I cannot say enough good things about this place!! I was searching for a location to throw my dads 79th birthday party and invite a large group for a private party. Painted mountain really hooked me up with not just a great location, but a great staff and management that helped put it all together.   I rented out the Patio on May 27th and they allowed me to bring in my own caterer, Dj Equipment, and most of the decorations. The staff helped put up all the decorations and set up the tables and chairs to the exact design the food and beverage manager agreed to. They allowed me to bring a Costco cake and kept it in the fridge till we needed it. Honestly, I felt like they were giving us more then what we paid for.    While we had the party we had 2 waitresses getting drinks for the guests and again helping with anything I needed ( I give them a lot of props because they never let me run out of beer)... We had another room off to the side that was empty for our \"overflow\" area. We used their TV to have a slide show of my dad that everyone went in and enjoyed throughout the night. We told them a total of monies we wanted to go towards drinks and they were so great at giving me a heads up when we were getting close to the tab cap (without making it awkward). This was my dads last birthday and it really meant a lot to the attention to detail and how courteous the staff was to us all. The location was perfect and beautiful at night. They separated their karaoke area with sliding glass doors and I could barely even hear anything on that side. They really did a amazing job If anyone is looking for a venue to have a party in the future try Painted mountain, I know I definitely will...   Thank you to all the Staff at Painted Mountain Golf Resort"}
{"text":"Expensive and not worth it.  We stayed at Painted Mountain because it was recommended as being close to the venue for a wedding we attending. Positives: It was reasonably close to the wedding venue. It was clean. As for the rest... Reception staff was surly and unhelpful from check in to check out. Though we made the reservation months in advance we were given a very noisy room on top of a busy street. Both nights parking was inconvenient.  Check out of 10 AM was inflexible- not great for post wedding celebration morning and afternoon flight."}
