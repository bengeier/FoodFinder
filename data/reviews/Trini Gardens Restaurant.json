{"text":"This place is surprisingly good. It's not your ordinary Chinese food though as the Yelp search signifies but does serve a small amount especially the soup selection. 

I decided to give it a try cause I was under the weather and the goat sounded quite delish. Guess what, it is. If you're around the area then check it out and relax a bit inside. 

The owner is nice, there's a huge tele, pool table and if you like Indian music, well there's an abundance of it in the background. 

Also, don't be a douche and forget to tip if you're taking out. And if you're sick Chinese happens to be a fine choice anyways."}
{"text":"The food was great and the owner was really nice! We had a pretty large group and they were able to accommodate our order and quickly replenish food when we ordered more. The owner also saved us from a potential scam. When we left the restaurant, some guy accused one my friends of hitting his car - we didn't - and he was pressuring him and wouldn't stop harassing him. Then the owner came and got involved and got the guy off our backs. Thank you!!! 

I recommend the chow mein - any of them - and the fried rice."}
{"text":"Just started working in the area and on the hunt for reasonable lunch spots. Inspired by the three other revues on here, I decided to give it a try.
Ordered the Pork Won Ton Soup and Jerk Pork appetizer. The soup was okay, decent amount of fresh broccoli, cabbage, peppers. Most likely frozen won tons and that Canadian/Chinese BBQ pork. 
The jerk pork was a disaster. How anyone can try and pass off, the above Canadian/Chinese BBQ pork, heated in some sort of brown sauce, that may or may not have been jerk flavoured, is beyond me. The taste was horrible, the combination of flavours should not be experienced by anyone. 
Needless to say, a major contribution was made to the garbage can.
Probably won't be returning......."}
{"text":"I've been getting food from here for the past 5 years or so. Food is excellent, there is no doubt about it. Pepper Shrimp/Chicken, Jeera(cumin) Pork, noodles, fried rice etc are great.

This is where the fun stops though as service can be terrible based on the owners mood. Unless you are there having a couple of beers and having a quick bite, it's not a place to go eat (especially with little kids). Do yourself a favour and take away the food, you can thank me later. :)"}
{"text":"Trini Gardens happens to be a few steps from my house so I first went there out of convenience. I go back because I love their food. They serve both West Indian and Chinese dishes. The Rotis are large and delicious. My favourite is the boneless chicken dinner, it comes with rice, curry chicken, curry potatoes and cucumber with tomato on the side all for $7.50. Elsie, one of the owners, always gives me extra homemade hot sauce which is to die for but really packs a punch. The diverse menu is great and everything I've ordered from here has been very tasty. The restaurant itself has a bit of a \"dive bar\" feel but the warmth of the service is outstanding."}
{"text":"Used to come here before ALL THE TIME with the attitude. At least the food was delicious. The Chinese guy is making great food but the actual trini food Is now garbage and she is angrier and fatter than ever. No drinks offered and I have to get her attention to ask for food. If I call ahead to order she will take the order and hang up in my face. Go to Granny's, that's where it's real food with good service with a smile. 
I don't know how she's still in business.  I used to bring her in $200 a month and now it's down to $20. There's nobody ever there not even her beer regs. Nobody needs to go to eat home cooking with a horrible person behind it who makes you feel like a piece of crap being there.
Honestly she has lost the feeling for the business. If I were in her shoes, and I'm glad I'm not, I would hire a new cook and hostess and she should just stay home."}
{"text":"Great rotis, haven't tried anything else.  Good mix of people, normally on the busy side.  Owners have always been pleasant."}
