{"text":"I have been eating here since they opened last summer. I eat there at least once a week. I only get my jerk chicken, plantain, rice & peas and coleslaw. I wish they had jerk pork since I don't eat roti or goat meat. My favourite order is always consistently flavourful and hot in temperature and just enough heat that I'm not guzzling back water to recover! ha ha!    It is a family run business; Sandy the mom does the cooking, her daughter Tasha is a server and Natalia is another server. After one visit Tasha had remembered my name, that is part of this restaurant's charm is how they connect with their customers.   I love the projector on the wall.. if I ask they will put on a movie or tv show for me! It's like a dinner and movie all rolled into one!   They are always closed on a Sunday.. everyone needs a day of rest ;0) The prices are reasonable in my opinion for the quantity of food that you get. Most of their business has been call in orders for pick up or take out.. but now they have their LCBO license they are hoping for more eat in diners.   Update: They got their LCBO license about 3-4 weeks ago.. so now you can have a beer or cocktail of your choice. The patio will be opening very soon. And they are starting Friday night Karaoke!!"}
{"text":"Place has CLOSED. But no worries, only 5 minutes walk from this place is another good Jamaican place, maybe even better. It is called Caribbean DutchPot, it is south of Broadview/Danforth on the east side. at the Traffic light, after New York Cafe."}
{"text":"Order: Goat Roti w/ bone ($9.95 or so)  Atmoshphere: The interior is decorated very nicely. Almost fine dining style. It was painted red and black and had a big screen which allowed people to watch t.v while eating! Pretty kick ass, I must say. (Too bad I got take out) The lighting is quite dim. I especially favoured the shelf displaying the wine glasses. It balanced out the darkness. Also, the girl who served me was very kind and welcoming.. sorta reminded me of a girl who I used to work with, ha!  Verdict:  The roti was a bit oily for me, but the spice had a nice kick to it. There isn't a choice for spiciness (or atleast I didn't ask), but I found it just right. I didn't have to chug 5 giant cups of cold water after every bite, however; I was heating up a bit (which I like). The goat was tender, but some pieces were a bit undercooked? I found it a bit pricey as well. I prefer Ghandi's, but it was a nice joint to try out."}
