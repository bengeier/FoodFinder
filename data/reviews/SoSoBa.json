{"text":"This place advertises right on top of the menu that they can do vegan, but really don't bother if your looking for vegan ramen. There's a bunch of ramen options in the valley so save yourself this one. The Tofu isn't vegan (god knows how you screw that up), so you're basically left with broth, noodles and corn when they pull out all the animals. Unless you're me, then they leave the eggs in it and still charge you when you return it and ask not to have it remade. And that's $12 for water, noodles and some corn mind you. Probably do just as good for what you get going to the dollar store, but again, I got eggs in mine, so who knows what it tastes like. I'm guessing broth and noodles."}
{"text":"This is my 3rd time and I enjoyed it once again! The waitress is very helpful with ordering based on your taste. The lemonade is the best! Nice addition to the neighborhood"}
{"text":"I guess I got my hopes up and thought this place would be great. I got the mr. Karl katsu bowl and soup wasn't as hot as I'd hope, egg tasted spoiled. Ramen noodles were a little hard. The chicken katsu was good though. Service was good.  My bf got the mic drop and was disappointed with it.   Would I return back again? Probably not..."}
{"text":"We were excited to find out that SoSoBa expanded to Phoenix. So we decided to stop by on a Saturday afternoon to give them a visit. We had pretty high expectations on the food after trying them in Flagstaff. Ordered the Mic Drop and Mr. Karl Katsu. Our food came out pretty quick. Visual wise, they looked similar to the one we had in Flagstaff, loaded with goodies. BUT the broth was lack in flavors and seems like watered down. Besides that, egg was very salty and yolk wasn't runny. We talked to server and she told us that they are still in the process of setting up the place. Hope things will get better and we will back for another try."}
{"text":"Big fans of Sosoba! The food, service, and atmosphere are always great!! Love having this little gem in downtown Phoenix!"}
{"text":"What happened to SoSoBa? Whatever went down, thank the food gods! I gave up on this place about 6 months ago due to a few horrible experiences with the service and food quality until my girlfriend suggested we give it another go (during happy hour). I'm so glad that we did because the food was absolutely delicious and the service was on point! The menu now has many items that can be prepared vegan style (a BIG thumbs up from yours truly) and between the hours of 5-6 pm you can grab 1/2 off the most popular bowls on the menu as well as $5 cocktails. Consider me hooked for life."}
{"text":"Went here when it first opened and it was awesome. Went back tonight and was a huge let down. When first walking in my boyfriend and I wanted to sit at the bar the only seats available were taken by an employee who was folding napkins while on her phone. I work in the service industry and that to me is a HUGE no no. The second thing that was a let down was the fact that their water glasses smelt like fish. Which to me seems like their dishwasher water hasn't been changed recently. The calamari is delicious as well as the mic drop which are the only reasons they are getting two stars."}
{"text":"I'm glad we ignored the bad reviews and tried this new local ramen house. We thought the food was great. The ramen had a nice broth to noodle ratio and it was delicious. Our servers were nice and attentive. We will definitely return."}
{"text":"Good customer service....considering I lived in Japan for 3 years, the ramen was good...just missing bean sprouts"}
{"text":"I gave this place 3 stars because my 2 experiences have been the same.   5 stars for taste and quality of food. 1 star for service. I gave 3 stars because it was in the middle.  The hostess (during the day with a tomboy-ish hair do) was on point. She's real attentive and friendly. The hostess (during the evening shift, real skinny with glasses) needs to shadow the daytime girl. She can really learn a thing or two, or three from her. She missed her greeting at our table, didn't mention her name, and didn't apologize for being 12 minutes late to our table. Yes, I clocked her ass. Then she didn't take down the correct order, after pretending like her memory was on point. She came back to our table and asked my sister in law what she ordered again. She also forgot to put in my fianc√©e drink order. Geeze. Seriously. Carry an order pad next time Ms. CRS (can't remember s**t, I mean stuff). We are going there again today after Bad Santa 2 to give it one last try. I'm crossing my fingers and toes."}
{"text":"Opening night, stellar performance! Great food, chill atmosphere. The Gose sour beer in tap really contrasted well with the noodle broth.  Only gonna get better!!"}
{"text":"Not worth the prices asked & the service was inexcusably slow for a near-empty resto before the lunch rush."}
{"text":"There is a growing trend amongst hipster eateries that believes that the spicier that the food is, the better that it tastes.  SoSoBa, subscribes to this philosophy, big time.  My rule of thumb is that any restaurant that has to overpower the taste of their food by making it so spicy, is hiding poor cooking or ingredients so that you won't notice. Hereto, SoSoBa is guilty.   Spice should be used to ENHANCE the flavor of delicious food, not overpower it.   Their menu fails to indicate levels of spiciness or even mention that the item you are ordering may be spicy.  We ordered an appetizer (pork wings). The meat was tender and delicious and served on a bed of crispy noodles with a sauce and some sort of fine red thread-like substance. The sauce was mildly spicy and complimented the dish, however, it looked like someone spilled the jar of chili powder onto the crispy noodles.  The taste was overpowering and left your lips stinging from the heat.  The waitstaff seemed indifferent to complaint of over spiced appetizer and tried to explain it away instead of apologizing.  The menu had a poor variety of of main dishes and a repetitive use of pork belly throughout the entire menu. This is a clear indication that the chef is either  uncreative or is unable to work outside their comfort zone.  Their kitchen was EXTREMELY unprepared, they RAN OUT of a MAIN INGREDIENT (Udon Noodle) early on a Saturday evening. For a restaurant that claims to specialize in noodles, this is a faux pas.  The kitchen also took far too long to prepare our meals. This is either an indication of a poorly run kitchen, or I suspect an indication that this restaurant is trying to upsell their clients more drinks...a dubious practice.   Even though I expressed concern to the waitstaff about not wanting my meal to be too spicy and despite my earlier complaint about the overspiciness of our appetizer, I was delivered a bowl of food that was also high in the heat index.   This solidified my opinion that either the chef prefers to serve food the way they want to cook it or that the waitstaff was incompetent.  The final kicker that proves that this restaurant does not have your best interest at heart was the gratuity ledger on the bill that gave you 3 suggested tips:  18% = $9.36 20% = $10.40 84.20% = $43.78  Really...84.20%?  Either this is meant to be a joke, or more likely they hope that you are too drunk from all those extra drinks you bought waiting for thier unprepared, over spiced, and uncreative, food to arrive to notice the amount.   Overall a complete failure, would not recommend."}
{"text":"Ordered the pork appetizers and they were stone cold on the inside. They apologized and \"made\" a fresh batch. They were almost freezing in the middle. I am guessing they were not fresh. The cauliflower was good. The mic drop soup had a lot of ingredients and tasted decent but it was slightly warm and not hot. The pork belly had no crispy texture. This water tasted odd, slightly bitter. They were trying hard to be hip. I would start with getting the food right first."}
{"text":"Yummy, yummy, yummy, I got love in my tummy.  Amazing food; balls of fire, two tso cauliflower, Mothra, tantamen.  Amazingly delicious!!"}
{"text":"Just saw your shop on Japanese TV and the people of Japan are laughing about how terrible and non-authentic your food is. You don't even make fresh Soba, Udon or Ramen. Whomever selects the ingredients doesn't know what in the hell they are doing. Curry with Ramen or Soba mixed in a bowl together? Fail!  Japanese professional Soba maker showed you all how it's really done!"}
{"text":"I'm pissed, I'm totally pissed at this place. This place was delicious! If this restaurant was open 15 years ago at this time, I would have had a delicious place to go to after drinking instead of Taco Bell. But now I'm old, I can only stay up till 1 every 6 months, and I get heart burn. Go, go here. It's a unique food experience and I loved it."}
{"text":"This is a fantastic Roosevelt spot that is open late with bomb, unique food in a chill environment. You can tell they're really into making the food (and drinks) taste as good as possible. Anyone I've ever brought here loves it."}
{"text":"They have vegan options!  We first ate at the Flagstaff location this summer and discovered they opened one in downtown Phoenix. The food was delicious and all of the staff was very friendly. And despite what their website says, they open at 11 am, not 5 pm. They also stay open until 2 am Thurs-Sat. Even though it was a drive for us we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Quick summary: SO GOOD. Great service, decent price, easy parking, Tso Tso cauliflower was tasty, delicious ramen. Ham fries.   My boyfriend and I have been searching for spicy pork ramen in Phoenix that is as flavorful as a place we tried in Denver. We tried the top picks in Phoenix but in comparison they tasted like watered down chicken noodle soup with some Oscar Meyer lunch meat mixed in. Although I work for a local restaurant company and enjoy eating out, I don't consider myself a food connoisseur by any means. However, I can recognize when a dish has a ton of flavor! My friends suggested we all try this place, which they'd enjoyed in Flagstaff.   We went last night (Thursday). The service was great. I wish I could remember the server's name, but he was attentive, knowledgeable, and fun. We shared Tso Tso cauliflower (amazing). The Balls of Fire were pretty good (I mean, it's deep fried Mac n Cheese) but in my opinion they rely too heavily on the Sriracha for flavor.  My friend got the Sweet Chili Glazed Udon, which she enjoyed.   Two of us got the Tantanmen ramen. The server warned me that the bamboo shoots are not listed on the menu and have a distinct flavor that people may opt to leave out. I'm not terrible picky so I left them in, but he was right! It was still delicious, but I'll leave 'em out next time.   My boyfriend got the Mic Drop. Appropriately named. Pork belly, crispy bacon, HAM FRIES (HAM FRIES?!?!) in 15 HOUR PORK BROTH. That's the trick, guys.  After a long search, I think we've finally found our go-to ramen spot."}
{"text":"DISAPPOINTING! People saying the food is mindblowing have not had REAL ramen in their lives. Came here after a concert and was really excited as I was really looking forward to having ramen that night. Lo and behold SoSoBa is open til 2am! Sifting thru the menu my group was really excited having to see 2 magic words, pork belly and bacon. Service was quick, server was courteous, but that was probably only the best thing in this place. We got The Mic Drop, Mr. Karl Katsu and Tantanmen. In a cold fall night, it would be nice to have piping hot soup, yes? No, our bowls came in not warm but TEPID. Too much going on in one bowl, too salty, not enough broth, flavors not complimenting each other. My husband noticed my bowl of half eaten soup and he said we're not coming back here. I asked how his soup was and he said, a chicken broth from the hospital would have done a better job. That sticker on the little \"check book\" saying People Hate Us on Yelp? Yep!"}
{"text":"Located next to Pita Jungle, near Central and Roosevelt. I enjoy both the admittedly inauthentic ramen and the atmosphere. They will accommodate  if you are vegan or vegetarian. I normally do not enjoy mushrooms, but their Hostile Takeover Ramen with meaty mushrooms and a mushroom broth is very tasty. I took a date here, who is from Japan. She agreed it was good, but it is not authentic ramen. She also had a good laugh at the doodle book the wait staff gives you with the check, which had numerous Kanji entires, apparently. I continue to eat eat here at least once per month. They also have a bar and offer Sake."}
{"text":"This was one of the best dining experiences I've ever had. My ladies and I stopped by for some noddles and were so pleasantly surprised by the service and cuisine. Our waiter was excellent and friendly, the atmosphere was lovely, and the food was to die for. Would recommend to anyone in Arizona looking for a great ramen/Asian food place. Get the Mic Drop noddles, fried chicken buns, and seaweed salad. Also in a great location off of a darling street with cute houses that was pleasant to walk down."}
{"text":"So yummy! Definitely have the general Tso Tso cauliflower. The cold noodle salad is killer too!They have vegan, veggie, and meat-eater friendly options.Chill atmosphere.cute patio. Good little date night spot."}
{"text":"Foods on point folks! Great vibe. They're new so a few kinks but the open kitchen killed it! \"The Mic Drop\" will change your world!"}
{"text":"SoSoBa was so so.  Maybe I'm too much of a traditionalist but it just didn't work for me (or my wife).  SoSoBa has non-traditional ingredient combinations - which is not necessarily bad.  The ingredients were all of good to high quality.  The flavor combinations just weren't that appealing.  I had the Tantanmen (I can't remember what my wife had).  We had takeout so I can't comment on the service.  Inside was nicely decorated."}
{"text":"This restaurant is amazing, trendy and modern. Great concept, noodle house with a twist. The food needs a lot of work, same carrot salad on every dish, lack of seasoning and presentations. Please don't drown a crispy calamari in sweet Thai chili. Hope food gets some serious upgrades and this place holds its ground."}
{"text":"Awesome food, atmosphere, staff and drinks! We went with a group of 6 and asked a lot of questions about the menu, as it was our first their. Our server was knowledgeable and attentive. We will be back here we when visit Phoenix again!"}
{"text":"After coming here I realized that I prefer more of a traditional ramen. The pork broth in the Mic Drop  didn't taste like the usual and there was just alot of stuff thrown into one bowl. It was a fusion alright. Too much going on. However, you should at least give this place a chance. The servers were exceptional! Very attentive, professional, and explained everything very thoroughly to us."}
{"text":"Good. Staff was great, bar tender was welcoming. We will be back. Stopped in for cocktails and happy hour. Good happy hour prices and food. Try the cauliflower.  Our waitress was great.  Thank you. Happy to see this restaurant here."}
{"text":"Just an (honestly and truly) awful experience. Aside from the polite and expedient gentleman that packaged and rung my order, there are no redeeming qualities to ensure my return. The entire experience was confusing, repulsive, and pricey given the overall positive reviews provided.   My fianc√© and I ordered two bowls of the pork ramen and an order of the steamed buns totaling to $40, which would've been more satiating to watch burn in my hands.   Do not order the pork ramen. The protein in the bowl was literally ground pork with barbecue sauce, there were a mere two stalks of bok choy, minimal dressing (scallions/sesame/etc...), and the traditional half of a soft boiled egg. There was barely a ladle of broth in each bowl, which was neither sufficient nor palatable! It's as is if they attempted to marry the broth with kimchi, which resulted in something more putrid than pleasing. Nothing seemed fresh, which was so disappointing after a long day at work.  Please coach your staff to keep their cell phones in the back and the sports chatter to a minimum; or at least learn to read the room. Guests were quietly enjoying drinks and dinner-- it isn't a sports bar.  I pride myself in being the furthest thing from a picky eater and someone who can forge through any meal for the sake of being polite, but I was physically repulsed by my ramen. I literally gagged mid-meal. Both my fiance and myself had to chalk it up to a loss and toss the meal, for fear of getting sick.  Next time, I'll make the trek across town where the ramen never disappoints. Never again--you couldn't even get a \"So-So\" review from me, SoSoBa."}
{"text":"excellent service.  waitstaff very pleasant.  lots of good menu choices and the food was all excellent.  We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"[SERVICE: 4] The service was really great here - we came in with a party of 9 on new years eve and since they don't take reservations, when I called ahead of time he offered to hold a table for us. He was very patient with handling all 9 of our orders and answering our questions.   [ENVIRONMENT: 4] The place is medium sized and very clean. However the lighting is pretty dim. Bathrooms are also very clean and the trashcan is automatic!  [PRODUCT: 2] We ordered balls of fire (fried Mac n cheese balls with Sriracha - $1 during happy hour, $3 per ball regular) and tantaimen ($12). The mac n cheese inside the balls were very plain and lacking any real cheese flavor. The only good part about them were the breading and the spice from sriracha. The tantaimen had a lot of good sides and vegetables in the soup, however the noodles were very hard and clumped together. They seemed very undercooked, but the waiter did offer to remake the dish.  [OVERALL: 3] I came here on vacation as I am originally from California so in comparison to the ramen there, this place does not come close. It was a good experience but I would not come back here nor recommend it, at least not the noodle soup dishes."}
{"text":"Seriously guys if you're going to pass on deserts as your own for 8 bucks. At least try to not take the box of moshi that you probably got from Trader Joe's our of your customer's eye. Jesus. Don't get the desert here."}
{"text":"For a late night food spot this is one of the best options instead of just boring ole fast food. We came in here after a day of drinking and walking all over downtown and ramen is always a delicious option after a long day. Ramen is a good comfort food for me and I've had good and bad bowls but I keep looking for the good ones. Sosobas mic drop is bomb it's really good it's one of the few bowls I can remember that i didn't have to add any spices or sauces because the broth was on point. My  ladys bowl of ramen was also so good and she loved it. Also our bartender / waiter was so chill and friendly and very welcoming. Also he made some mean drinks he made us a mai tai and it was refreshing with a perfect amount of alcohol. The place was nice and for a late Saturday night the service was fast and courteous and tasty. Great job guys"}
{"text":"I went with a small group of friends last night. None of us had been before. It was 7pm on a Friday & at first service seemed a little slow, but after the appetizer came, it was much faster! Our waiter was extremely friendly, the type of guy you could easily become friends with. The food was pretty good. We ordered the General Tso Tso Cauliflower to start, which did not disappoint! Everyone at the table raved about it. I got the Sweet Chile Glazed Udon for myself & while it was tasty, it seemed a little confused. I'd like to disclaim though, I tend to be a bit pickier when it comes to Asian Fusion dishes, being as I'm Korean & I think my standards for Asian food are a little different. My husband ordered the same dish & said it was delicious (he is not Asian). It's definitely a cool spot to checkout & I would for sure go again & try some other things!"}
{"text":"Great place. Food is delicious.  Place is clean and chill. Staff was great! Will be back !!the calamari  dish was insane!!"}
{"text":"Went on Saturday around 6:30 ... it was not too crowded, got seated immediately, and staff was friendly.  Waiter forgot part of our order, but apologized and corrected it.  Drinks were good, but unfortunately food was, well, just so-so.  I got the tantanmen, and it was short on flavor, and could have used more heat and seasoning (and more noodles).  We will go back, but they need to step up their game."}
{"text":"Really excited about this place. I went during their sneak peak and got their Balls of Fire, Tso Tso Cauliflower, the Mic Drop, and Mr Katsu (veggie style).   Really cute little easterly. The cauliflower was awesome, my mom is vegetarian and she really enjoyed it! The balls of Fire was FIRE- reminded me of the fried Mac n cheese from cheesecake. My favorite fatty food is mac n cheese so I really like it.   I had the Mic Drop- I thought the flavors worked really well together. The udon noodles were perfectly cooked and the egg was nice and gooey (my fav part). Although I do wish they put the whole egg In there. My mom got Mr Katsu without meat & bacon- she's vegetarian. She didn't really like that but I feel like unless a restaurant is specialized in vegetarian/vegan food- she won't find it good. She's also traditional Asian lady and very judgmental of Asian cuisine lol.   Definitely can't wait to come back for the full menu. Hoping they have a spicy ramen/noodle dish since I love spicy food lol."}
{"text":"Food is damn good. MIC Drop full of flavor and love. Open late. Lovely environment. Hope this place thrives and receives support from the area."}
{"text":"Use to come here all the time and it was good. Came back downtown this week to get dinner here and it was not a very good experience. Service was poor, the waiter delivered our food with a backpack on. Food has changed as well. My noddle bowl was lacking the usual veggies and was only about a forth of the way full. Not coming back."}
{"text":"What a wonderful local find! This is my 2nd visit and I cannot say enough about the noodles, salads, and homemade bitters in my bourbon old fashioned! Atmosphere is intimate but fun. Great spot for locals!"}
{"text":"This is a very original take on a very traditional dish. The atmosphere here is Hip Hollywood with an asian fusion twist. With red and dark wood everywhere and the exposed kitchen speaks Japan teppanyaki (though no teppanyaki is served here) but none-the-less Japanese style.   The bar menu is a mix of original homemade items (i.e. bitters from their Flagstaff location) and fresh ingredients like their shiso, ginger and juices; all are a respectable price too. The mixologist Marie is wonderful to talk to and very lively and fun.   Now of the food. The pork \"wings\" are a must order, drumettes of pork tossed in a cherry teriyaki sauce over a bed of mixed greens and fried togarashi noodles, I mean what's not to like. It pairs very well with the Mai Tai. The noodle bowls here are the perfect size, not large, but enough food for you to feel great afterwards, to have enough space for desert (I'll touch on that in a second). The Mic Drop is a great bowl of everything, some might say it's to busy, but in my experience of Noodle bowls, everything that is in a bowl is there for a reason per the chef, and if you want to customize your bowl, this is not the place to go to. Great tonkatsu broth (cooked for 15 hours) and 6 ways to have pork in one bowl is a great example of what they can accomplish in one dish.   The staff here was very friendly and happy to make small talk, and they are proud of their dishes. The Hatch Miso Carrot cake is a beautiful way to finish the night. It's a rich dessert for one, but a perfect plate to have while sharing a conversation with friends over another libation.   Overall a great place to eat, the atmosphere is laid back, the people who come are as unique as the dishes they order, and if they ever make their way to Los Angeles, I'll be sure to be first in line.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"It saddens me to rate this restaurant so poorly, as we're avid fans of the Flagstaff location and had high hopes for its Phoenix incarnation - but the similarities end at ambience and menu design. The quality of every dish we tried was just so bad: started with the fried cauliflower appetizer, which had none of the umami-rich, fully coating sauce we'd so enjoyed in Flagstaff, but just tasted like dry roasted cauliflower with an oddly lazy drizzle of a sort of peanut sauce? Ever the optimists, we moved on to our respective entrees with hopes still intact - the Mr. Karl Katsu and Hostile Takeover. Oh, sadness. The former was a bland mess of inedibly gummy Ramen, the latter literally fettuccine noodles (seriously, WTF) in an over-salted broth, and both were almost insultingly small portions. Overall, the food here was so bad we couldn't finish it - the two stars are for the gracious staff who took our feedback with understanding and comped the (mostly uneaten) meal. I'd love to see them improve and bring the quality up to par with the original SoSoBa, so we can support the business and staff here."}
{"text":"Spicy ramen isn't typically the first thing I crave when it's over 90¬∞ outside, but it's all I ever usually crave and I wanted to see what the Phoenix ramen scene had to offer. I've had some pretty damn good ramen, so my standards are kind of high, but I like to keep an open mind...  I got the tantanmen with pork belly. The presentation was fantastic! The pork belly was not as tender as I like it, but still flavorful and crispy on the outside. The egg was perfectly soft boiled (whew). The noodles and broth were actually really good! I wished there was more broth, so I ate a third of the noodles and requested more. It could definitely afford to be soupier but they'd need bigger bowls and prob have to sacrifice presentation. But the best part? It was actually spicy! Nothing is ever really spicy when it claims to be so I was especially pleased with this. :)  I loved the cocktails and admittedly got a little carried away. Osaka Smash, June Rose and White Linen. They even serve Fernet! Also shared the Balls of Fire and Cauliflower with a friend but we were too full to really enjoy them. Still tasty.  I feel like this place probably wouldn't fly with pretentious ramen snobs since it isn't really traditional, but I still thought it was delicious and would absolutely revisit!"}
{"text":"The answer to a pesty cold!   The Fire Balls were a tasty treat & The Mic Drop blew my mind!   The service was amazing & the playlist was inviting.  GO NOW!"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time today. It is located in one of my favorite spots to be- Downtown Phoenix! Great location. Our server was nice and informative about the menu and possible combinations so that was helpful. We ordered the balls of fire (mac and cheese balls w/sriracha). They were crispy on the outside. The inside towards the very center was a little cold. :( wish the ball was warmer. My soup came first and the mushrooms were SUUUUUPER salty and tasted really weird. The soup was decent. Was a little bland. Again, not as warm as I would have liked to have it. I have tried the location in flagstaff and I liked it but this location was kind of a disappointment. Womp womp :( sorry guys. Try again!"}
{"text":"I've been waiting for a long time, like everyone else for SoSoBa to open and it was worth the wait! They did a lot with the space and there is ample seating, plus outdoor patio. The bar is basically open to the kitchen. The Mic Drop Udon was incredible. Perfectly spicy, salty, smokey, and the noodles were perfectly cooked. Easy to slurp with the broth. The Kimchi inspired veggies were a perfect crunch to the chewy noodle. Great vibe, great opening night! Super happy I live right there especially with the extensive cocktail menu."}
{"text":"I'm still craving the cauliflower.  We took my daughter and her boyfriend here. They've been fans since discovering the place in Flagstaff and were so excited SoSoBa in Phoenix finally opened. After my big bowl or noodles and flavorflavorflavor, I can see why. Dinner was excellent. Four adults, a couple of appetizers and cocktails and our bill wasn't even $100. We will definitely be back. Soon, because I'm craving the cauliflower. TIP: Go slow when pulling into the parking around here. Take your time and you will find a good spot, but streets are tight, so be careful!"}
{"text":"Had the Katsu Bowl here. Wasn't bad but wasn't anything extraordinary either. Tasted like Instant Ramen Noodles. No flavor. Probably wouldn't come back here. Very small serving size for $12 as well."}
{"text":"Went back after a year and wow have things changed. They have cut costs tremendously and you can really tell the changes in everything! My first sign was I came in on a Friday and there was not a single person in there! One of the cooks were on the patio smoking a cigarette which I found odd. Usually they go out back for that kinda thing...  I usually get the SUV. It's my go to dish. I've had it 10 plus times and remember the good ol days very well. They used to have tons of ingredients and it was a very hearty dish and I left happy and satisfied and full. They had beans and these long red hair things and different greens and a spicy pepper and it was just very hearty. Bursting with flavor!  Now however, the dish is has just changed so min it doesn't even remotely look or taste the same. The broth is more watery. They replaced the beans with cheap potatoes, the red hair things with shaved carrots and tiny tomatoes, and the greens were soggy and overcooked and just not great. Even their ramen noodles taste soggier. It was not appetizing at all. I'm so sad this place has gone downhill. I will no longer come back here. Their time has past and they lost a customer."}
{"text":"We live just yards away from SoSoBa and have eaten there a few times now.  The food is great, cocktails are great and the servers are friendly and attentive.  We will be eating there often.  They have a great location with all of the walking traffic in our neighborhood.  I have one critique though regarding the atmosphere in the restaurant.  They have a good start with the overhead lighting and the addition of the hanging lanterns on the patio.  But there's a lack  of ambiance in the restaurant and patio.  Low lighting in the way of candles is needed on every table and especially on the patio.  In this neighborhood, a warm, inviting patio is huge!  The addition of candlelight would bring in a lot more customers."}
{"text":"Salty. Everything was salty. Even I was in a very petty mood after the first few exchanges with the staff. It was such a strange dining experience. Our server was rude. Out of nowhere his demeanor changed completely and he was extremely personable. He provided decent service with refilling waters and asking if everything was ok but his attitude came back often in the hour I was here with my friends.   We ordered the Yakisoba, Katsu Ramen and the  Tantanmen. Prepared quickly, maybe less than 10 minutes. My friend complained that her noodles were undercooked and her broth had a very salty soy flavor. It was masking the taste of everything else. My other friend said his yakisoba was very bland with no dimensions. Had tons of veggies but all you can taste is soy sauce. My tantanmen was very salty as well. I didn't eat the pork bits in the soup but my friend tried it and she said it tasted funny. I ordered a side of crispy tofu and that was the highlight of the entire meal. (That should say a lot about this restaurant if the best part is basic crispy tofu). The peanut sauce that comes with the tofu was not good. I hated it and I usually love anything with peanuts! There are plenty better ramen restaurants (even in this area). I will consider giving this place another try but not worth the drive or money."}
{"text":"Ooo so sobosoba. Sobosoba has the bed ramen in Phx. Hands down! I order the mr Karl katsu every time I am here. The broth is so flavorful. I don't know how they do it. The chicken is super crispy. Portion size is generous. They are in a category of its own when it comes to ramen in the valley. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Love the katzu!! Never a disappointment. We usually get the edamame as an app, but I would recommend the cauliflower - it looks so tasty!"}
{"text":"Disappointing experience.   Was initially excited to see that this restaurant was opening up on Roosevelt a literal stones throw away from where I live. Although, my experience with this business was bad and undeserving. My girlfriend and I went for a walk with our dog and decided to check out Sosoba as we were passing by. We were looking inside from the sidewalk and then we began to check out their small patio from the sidewalk. At this point we were rudely greeted by a douche employee who walked out and with arms crossed blocked the patio entrance. He processed to say no dogs allowed. Not sure if the kid has a background in bouncing... but that's not how you greet potential customers in the restaurant industry. Anyways, on our frequent walks we have seen a number of dogs on their patio... The odds of them all being service dogs are pretty low...   Attitude like that comes from the top down and we have already let a lot of people in the community know to just keep walking when it comes to Sosoba.   Don't waste your time or money guys.   Guy had a buzz cut btw."}
{"text":"The food was delicious and reasonably priced. The fried cauliflower was great-different but very tasty. There was a delay in getting our entrees and they were unbelievably gracious and comped our food. I'd definitely go back!"}
{"text":"At long last, SoSoBa is open for the business.  It was a lengthy wait after Centurion closed their doors at this location before Flagstaff's most popular noodle spot opened their second location here in Downtown Phoenix.  But now they're here.  So after a long work week, I made the short walk from my apartment to this spot during Friday happy hour.  If you've been to 2nd Ave and Roosevelt in the space that used to be Centurion, the exterior hasn't changed all that much.  The patio outside has some bar and picnic seating, but otherwise the exterior is the relatively unchanged.  The interior however is almost unrecognizable from what it used to be (and in this case, that's a good thing).  They've blown out part of the wall that used to separate the front bar area from the rest of the restaurant and have managed to create a pretty spacious sit down area throughout the restaurant with about double the seating of Centurion.  The lighting, the colors, and furniture are also a huge improvement.  Its quite a startling change as I never knew this space was so big.  Anyways, let's get to the good stuff.  I have not had the pleasure of visiting SoSoBa's flagship location in Flagstaff so I did a little research before making my way here.  From what I read, it appeared the Mic Drop is the bowl that put SoSoBa on the map.  And it reads like a pork all-star team.  Pork Belly, Carnitas, chicharron, bacon, and ham fries in a slow cooked pork broth.  To boot, there's a soft boiled egg, kim chi and scallions.  Oh and some nice, soft thick cut udon noodles.  Took a little over 5 minutes for them to make.  I'll admit, this thing was pretty intimidating when it arrived at my table.  The bowl is huge and I didn't think I stood a chance.  But once I put the first helping of it in my mouth, there was no stopping me.  The broth was out of this world.  And the combination of different types of pork was fantastic.  Admittedly my chopsticks game could use some work as it took me a bit to get some of that deliciousness in bulk.  So by all means make sure your chopsticks skills are on point for this.  Super psyched from a delicious bowl of noodles and pork, I decided I've give dessert a go here as well.  So far there's only two dessert items on the menu.  A miso carrot cake and a grasshopper cheesecake.  I'm a sucker for cheesecake and something cold and dense like cheesecake sounded perfect after a warm spicy noodle bowl.  The specs on this cheesecake incarnation:  A green tea and mint semi-freddo cheesecake with Oreo crumble and cocoa nibs.  The presentation was a bit surprising in that it was served almost like a sushi roll would be served.  As for the taste?  Slight disappointment on this one.  The flavor was very light and almost herbal which was surprising, but not altogether a bad thing.  But it didn't have the cold density that my mouth was craving so that was a bit of let down.  The texture was almost more of a custard than a cheesecake.  It wasn't terrible, just a bit of departure from what I'd expected and hoped for.  Despite a somewhat subpar dessert, I left SoSoBa nevertheless impressed.  Total cost for my meal including tax and tip came to about $25.  The staff was super friendly and they also encourage you to leave a note in the little customer notebook that comes with your check.  So all in all a great successor to Centurion at this prime spot on Roosevelt.  They've done some amazing work with the interior and have given Roosevelt Row its first true ramen spot.  So if you've got a hankering for noodles and a readiness to bring your chopsticks A game, SoSoBa might be right up your alley."}
{"text":"This review is based on the quality of the food alone. On a Wednesday night whim, I decided to peruse my midnight options and I opted for this place because the pictures looked promising - albeit trendy. I ordered the sweet chili glazed udon, the tantanmen bowl, the Mic Drop, and the fried calamari.   I have a tendency to go a little overboard when trying new places and since this was my first time coming here, I decided to sample the selection.   First off - the fried calamari. It was actually very tasty. Sweet, which was definitely not what I expected but still really good. I liked it. No complaints here except for maybe the portion size. It was TINY.   Next is the chili glazed udon. Now, imagine what it would taste like if you mixed boiled udon noodles, fried slices of pork belly, and a bottle of your favorite sweet chili sauce from any Asian market. Are you imaging that? Good. That's exactly what this tastes like. It's lazy and lacks any real flavor.   Now for the Tantanmen and the Mic Drop since they're both in pretty much the same category of horrible. The broth for both of these soups was both bland and salty at the same time. Like, how tf do you do that? I'm both repulsed and impressed. It's like they took whatever no-flavor pan drippings they could find, boiled it in water and added sodium. And that freaking sucks because any ramen lover will tell you that the broth is half the experience, if not 90%. Good ramen can't be done without good broth.   And to add insult to injury, the portions are laughably small. I don't mind paying a premium price for something amazing, but when you're charging me twelve friggin dollars for a bowl of lukewarm, salted sink water, you best believe I'm a take this personally.   Overall, it was over $50 in disappointment and regret. Nope. Never again. I'll stick to Republic Ramen in Tempe where the ramen is made with sunshine and rainbows, their prices are super cheap (less than $10), and the bowls of ramen are literally 3x the size of anything you'd find here."}
{"text":"This a cool little place! Probably the best ramen in town! They have an unique toping and flavors to their ramen! My girl calls this place is MUST TRY ramen! We both just love it! They actually have another location up in Flagstaff. Both are recommended!!!!"}
{"text":"I believe in second chances... which is why I decided to give Sosoba another try after a bad first experience. I have to respectfully say that the ramen here is just not good nor tasty. I've tried a few different bowls, and none of them are authentic in nature. The broth is a bland, lack lustre attempt at a truly flavorful Asian historical art form- RAMEN. I will not be back again, and advise any real ramen connoisseurs to check out other local joints before stopping here.  p.s. Forgot to mention- a big hearty bowl of ramen should only cost $8 at most. Not $12 for half that amount."}
{"text":"This is honestly such a great place for either drinks or food. I have now ordered 3 different drinks from 3 different bartenders(wish I could remember their names, they were so nice) that work here and they all have been excellent! Staff is friendly and accommodating, would definitely come here to study (free WiFi) or for drinks!"}
{"text":"So I walk in, I'm not greeted. I'm looked at like I'm in the wrong place. The chic walks in after me and gets an enthusiastic greeting. Ive been walked by several times and then finally after being walked by quietly I'm told I'll be right with you. now the lady who walked in after me and sat at the other end of the bar is getting served. Then when I address it she then gives me every reason why I was being ignored. Then she tells me oh I know her. Beyond unacceptable. Is this how you treat new patrons or just patrons that are darker because I'm the only one in here that's black. If I wasn't hungry and visiting this city where I know NOBODY, I would leave!!! Honestly I'm not even going to review the food. I asked for the manager of course conveniently he's not available. I hope this is not what I'm going to deal when I move here next month. She credited the buns I ordered, but I don't think people understand the importance of customer service or not being treated like they are invisible. I love visiting new spots and trying little eccentric places this is a place I probably won't return to this place."}
{"text":"I really like everything about this place. The location. The atmosphere. The people that work there. The food. I look forward to going back and having one of their cocktails."}
{"text":"Great noodles and open super late! We're talking 2am! Plenty of options for both Carnivores and Vegetarians alike. If you stop by, make sure to try their Fireballs, these are quite the delicacy when it comes to Mac N Cheese die hards like myself. The staff is very welcoming as well, if I bring my dog along, they have a nice patio and great hospitality for the pup."}
{"text":"This review is solely based on the food.   Let me start with saying that I love ramen and I have yet to find a place that rivals the ramen places in California/Asia. I always crave the traditional Japanese ramen, with pork broth that tastes like it was prepared for hours and hours. With that being said, I unfortunately was not a fan of SoSoBa. It's not that it was bad. It just wasn't my kind of ramen. I ordered the Mic Drop and it had too much going on, too many toppings with little broth - broth that wasn't great either. It was far, far from traditional Japanese ramen. My boyfriend had the sweet chili glazed udon which he thought was good. I thought it was better than the Mic Drop for sure. I'd love to come back and try other things on the menu. The calamari, balls of fire and kim chi look like it would taste pretty good!"}
{"text":"From the Warren G playing in the background, to the minimally beautiful decor to the perfectly cooked, al dente vegetables Sosoba was a homerun. With bases loaded. In game 7. This was PERFECTION! We started with the Tso Tso Cauliflower and Calamari, which we chopstick battled each bite for! I enjoyed the Hostile Takeover. Bulgogi beef tender and just enough for my perfectly proportioned bowl of ramen, broccoli and mushrooms. I literally ate every drop. Hubs had the Mic Drop. It was like Asian Bbq in a bowl with noodles. A party for your mouth. We finished with the Grasshopper because...cheesecake. The presentation was great, the cheesecake cold and oreo crumbles just a perfect amount of crunch. We left full and delighted! Our new date night spot fo' sho'!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious!  We stopped in tonight for dinner and had a great experience.  Great atmosphere, great service and delicious food and cocktails.  I had a June Rose cocktail and the Sweet Chile Glazed Udon Noodles...a seriously perfect dinner!  We will definitely be back to try the cauliflower and the balls of fire along with the noodles and cocktails."}
{"text":"First time and had the Tantanman. Service was quick and waiter was friendly. Chill atmosphere and and enjoyable setting. Parking is tough. Tantanman was delicious and filling with the right amount of spiciness."}
{"text":"I normally don't write Yelp reviews, but this place definitely deserves 5 stars. To my understanding, they've only been open a few days but it doesn't seem like it at all. Our experience was fantastic and everyone was very welcoming and accommodating. We started with the Daily Cheech pork cracklings which were suuuuuper addicting (I'm taking some home). I had the Mic Drop and it was mindblowingly good. My friend had the Mr Karl Katsu which was also fantastic. Our cocktails were perfectly crafted. I'm a gin drinker and loved the June Rose. We finished off with the carrot cake which was VERY unique and delicious. I work just down the street and will definitely be referring this place to our customers. Can't wait to come back and see their full menu."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to eat in Phoenix it is a little pricey but the quality in the food is there! If you go I recommend the balls of fire and the mic drop."}
{"text":"The food was amazing and the biggest selection of hot sauce I have ever seen.   The server was knowledgable of menu and very friendly. A must visit if you are down with good food."}
{"text":"Bad experience with this restaurant and their staff. Employees are rude and not hospitable. Furthermore, management refuses to take responsibility for their employees actions. The negative trickle down effect is more than obvious at this Sosoba location.   I will not recommend this to any of my family, coworkers, neighbors or friends. Just disappointing."}
{"text":"Foodie Friday or actually Foodie Day since it wasn't Friday. My friend an I wanted ramen so we went to SoSoba and it was so, so bad. A foodie fail! The appetizers were good the ramen was not. So bland! Even tried to doctor it but to no avail. With everything they had in it you'd think it'd be flavorful but it wasn't. We sent it back and ended up going somewhere else for ramen. But if you want a really good glass of ice water, this is the place to go. Lol! But for reals they had really good ice water. No funny tap water taste. Sweet chili calamari was delish, spicy macaroni and cheese ball was not spicy at all. Only spicy part would be the little squirt of sriracha sauce that's on it. Pork and kimchi tostada was good. Ramen was bland and awful."}
{"text":"I went in here expecting actual Japanese ramen and was sorely disappointed to see it turn out to be nothing more than a forced attempt at \"Americanized\" ramen. They do not serve typical ramen dishes, so if you're looking for that, I'd recommend somewhere else.   I built my own bowl (ramen, miso base, and pork). It was edible - nothing special really. Good, but not unique enough for me to come back again. The miso base was a teensy bit spicy but nothing too crazy. They give you ground beef instead of slices of pork (comparing it to chashu) and it's hard to pick it up with chopsticks. Regardless, I finished it.   TL;DR, don't come here expecting real Japanese noodles. If you like experimental fusion, then this might just be your place. The place lives up to it's name - So-So."}
{"text":"There is something special going on here... chef has a fresh and unique take on noodles!  Be warned: If you are coming here for \"RAMEN\" you will be disappointed. If you come here for a unique Asian-inspired noodle dish you will be thrilled!  Unique flavors, quality ingredients, inspired dishes. I have to give a 5 on service because everyone including the Chef was so kind however I did go during a slow time.  I'll be coming back to try more of their creations!  Tip: parking can be tricky, go early for lunch!"}
{"text":"This place is a good bowl of noodles, but the location in flagstaff is better. If this place could balance their ingredients a bit better I think they'd be a five star joint.   I still eat there frequently and always enjoy myself."}
{"text":"We ordered ramen and some appetizers and both were not that great. The ambiance and service was really good. The location and the restaurant itself nice and clean. Food was alright though, with so many options, I don't think I'll come back again. This is only on one visit though, so I'm sure there are times that the ramen is great!"}
{"text":"Walked in with my girlfriend, no greeting and no sign to seat ourselves. No acknowledgement by the bartender. After about 10 seconds one of the line/prep cooks smiled and said we could sit anywhere. That was nice of him to do. We sit down order the food. The bartender/waiter that was helping us was friendly and nice. The food was on point. No complaints there at all. I was however disappointed, after receiving my $32 bill, that he decided to put the to go cup in front of me to do. C'mon dude....I know we're a young generation and not so formal but I'm paying $32 dollars for lunch for two. It takes 5 seconds for you to put the noodle bowl in the to go cup. It's completely dead in there so it's not like there's any rush! Then I look and see that the  suggested minimum gratuity on the bottom of the receipt is 18%. Ok so I'm suggested to pay almost $40 for a meal for two and I can't even get the server to put it in the to go cup for me? That's either laziness or lack of focus. I'm sorry, I can look past the other stuff, but when you can't even do something the requires the bare minimum of effort that is irritating and made me resentful of the whole experience. If he had forgotten because he was slammed with service that's once thing but it wasn't busy at all. Maybe it's entitled of me but when I'm expected to pay almost $40 for lunch I don't think what I'm asking is unrealistic. If management disagrees with my assessment that's fine but then don't tell me what my gratuity should be on lunch for two."}
{"text":"Not sure how this place got 3.5 stars. The location and staff was great but thats about it. I had the worst ramen today. I would compared it to a cup of noodle but a cup of noodle has more flavor.  I ordered the katsu ramen and was very disappointed.  There was not enough broth, ramen tasted like it was microwaved, the topping was scarce and overall had no flavor. I'm not sure if the chef is tasting the broth but dang it was so bad. I really wanted a good ramen place downtown but I guess that's not going to be the case. I would recommend using fresh ingredients and go for flavor. It's ramen go big or go home. I don't understand how other people are saying their ramen was good. Is this your first time eating ramen? If so please do not comment.  Sorry one more thing, that huge case of hot sauce in front should be a warning to everyone in saying your broth needs more flavor so pick one..."}
{"text":"There isn't a thing wrong with this cute little place. I, like scores along with me, have waited for months for Sosoba to open. This evening (Monday), my fianc√© stopped in and chose a seat. The restaurant was not busy. The server, Brenden, was extremely attentive and kind. Water test: passed. My water cup was never less than half full. Love that!  I got The Mic Drop. A wonderful dish with a myriad of flavors and textures, all layered over soft udon noodles. The meats were delicious and the kimchi offered a welcome brightness to cut through the fatty broth. I loved this dish and would certainly get it again.   Please do stop by Sosoba for a bowl. No substitutions are necessary; just cozy in and enjoy a nice serving of ramen."}
{"text":"I love SosoBa. It is SosoGood. I drove 40 minutes through Phoenix traffic and I'm not even mad. Ive had the Mic Drop and the Tantanmen and both are on point. On this fine lunch, I had the Mic Drop. It was MONEY. The ham fries, the pork belly, the carnitas and everything else worked so well together. The broth was soulful and full of umami. I'm not a ham guy but those ham fries had so many levels of flavor. The Pork belly was fatty but crispy at the same time and just melted in my mouth. Honestly, the only thing that could have been better was the ramen egg. It was cooked right with the runny middle, I just wished it was soaked in soy before.   I also had the bad bao. I'm like 95% chinese and these baos were sososososo good. I had it with the pork belly and it has forever changed my life. The bun was soft and sweet and a little crispy. The hoisin sauce was sweet with a deep savory flavor. The Pork belly was heavenly. If it wasnt so expensive, I'd probably eat 30 of them.  The restaurant itself is tucked in the middle of a tiny street. Parking was rough. The interior of the restaurant was clean but small. I do not recommend having a large party. There was no wait. The server was AWESOME. Polite, quick and helpful. He hooked us up with some extra sauce and our water cups were never dry. The place is a tad pricey and the servings are small but for a broke guy like me, it was worth it."}
{"text":"I finally was able to try Ramen from here. I have been eyeing it for months but no one I know likes Ramen... crazy right! So I went by myself and I am in love! I ordered drop the Mic but with the ramen noodles. I will def be back when I eat by myself again! I took it to go and it was still yummy! Thanks again!"}
{"text":"I can't stop craving it! The atmosphere is great, the food is delicious, and the wait staff is friendly and helpful. Very prompt service even though they were really busy and have only been open a week. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I stopped here to get some noodles after a whole night of brewery hopping( get it)  in downtown! Does Asian food taste really good when you have had a few beers? Probably! But I am going to try to give my honest( slightly sober) review here. Ordered the General Tso Tso Cauliflower and The Hostile Takeover (noodle bowl). Both didn't disappoint! The place has a quiet ambience which allows for those deep drunk conversations one looks forward to after a wild night!"}
{"text":"Well this place sucks. The ramen literally tastes like the 30 cent package ramen you buy at the dollar store. It's unfortunate because downtown Phoenix needs good ramen places but this isn't it!"}
{"text":"This place is really good but it's always empty! The menu is small but everything is super delicious. I've tried the sweet chile chicken, cauliflower, ramen, and shishito peppers. I love the shishito peppers so much I order them every time I eat here. The drink menu is solid and they have a great happy hour as well. I would be a regular here if I lived in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"We love this place. I can't believe some of the bad reviews.  I think if you are looking for a traditional Ramen house it's not, but wow.  Everything is awesome!  The cold buckwheat salad is great.  Love this place!  Highly recommend this place.  Friendly staff too!"}
{"text":"Good food!! Loved the pork wings with cherry teriyaki sauce. Must try.  The mic drop was pretty good with a variety of pork but noodles was ok."}
{"text":"Well it's my birthday and we thought we would try this ramen place we frequently drive by, it looked very promising!  We get here walk in, no one greets us, finally someone walks by and says sit anywhere. Okay it is a seat yourself place.... cool. We walk by this decent selection of sauces and I see a sticker that instead of reading \"People love is on Yelp!\" It reads \"People hate is on Yelp!\" I tell my fianc√© and we laugh about it think it's one of those punny stickers.   The waiter is legitimately sitting at a table with his feet up. He came by dropped off waters... okay courteous. There is one other table here dinning. He Never once made eye contact, never asked how our evening was, didn't introduce himself, very unprofessional, and just honestly felt disrespectful.   He walked by once after picking up the tab from the other table and gave a thumbs up and said everything good and walked off. No time for a reply, just kept walking.   Food looked really good! But tasted like someone else said, \"Lukewarm, salted sink water\"  We never got straws, I had to go up to the bar and take some, never were asked if we need anything, it was the most unsatisfying experiences I've ever had. We have NEVER left a $0 tip, but when the experience is this bad how can you not?   Gross food, I left hungry, shitty service, no manners, the place was f***ing EMPTY!   It is now just us in here and we are waiting for the bill. We don't get the bill until another customer walks in and he immediately gets up from the booth where his feet were propped up and walks over to make it look like he is working. We get the bill and he returns to the bar where he continues to text and be on his phone.   Pretty big disappointment. I think my 8 year old niece can provide me with better customer service and a better tasting Maruchan or Top Ramen noodles.    Needless to say, I think the sticker wasn't meant to be punny, but true. \"People hate us on Yelp!\" Is probably the only thing this place has going for them."}
{"text":"Friendly great service. Yummy food. Tasty drinks love this place definitely coming back again"}
{"text":"Did you guys get a new chef? I have gone many times before and sang the praises of Sosoba. The food has always been super flavorful, the broths has a lot of depth, but I just went this last week and my boyfriend ordered the katsu ramen and I genuinely felt bad for him because the broth was just WATER. I was floored at how terrible it was. I even gave him the rest of my Mic Drop to enjoy because we were both super hungry when we arrived. I don't know what's going on right now but hopefully management acts fast to get the quality back up."}
{"text":"Came early evening on Saturday. The service was friendly although they could use one more person. The food was inconsistent.  The macaroni fried balls were tasteless.  However the pork lettuce wraps were good.  The green curry was good but the beef noodles bowl wast tasteless and the beef tough. The drink -ma tai -was great   My boyfriend loved the place but I'm not sure I would be back"}
{"text":"I'm always excited when the possibility of something resembling a Ramen place pops up on the radar here in Phoenix. We were spoiled living in Vancouver BC, where you can hardly swing a Ramen noodle around without hitting people standing outside in a rain-peppered line-up waiting to squeeze into a steamy, cramped, Ramen House waiting to gorge on sumptuous broth and the delights therein bathed...but I digest. We went into SoSoBa on a Saturday just after 11am. We were told as we walked in to \"sit wherever we liked\" the place was empty but for one couple seated at the long picnic table on their patio. In my experience, the guests should be seated by a staff member who also puts down menus. We decided to join the people on the patio, menu-less. We were no sooner joined by about 25 really persistent flies. They remained with us for the duration; one of the cons of dining out of doors in downtown Phoenix, unfortunately.  Right away we got the feeling that our server was either really new at serving, or she was just having an off day. Once we sat down it took about 5 mins before she came out to take our drink order, despite the fact that we could see her inside doing random tasks like picking things up from one end of the room and setting them down somewhere else. Once she did finally come outside to take our drink order, we said we'd like to look at a menu first to see what's on offer.  We got the menus and picked out what looked yummy. They have a nice selection of shared plates, noodle bowls and salads, they offer vegan and  gluten-free options and adjustments too which is nice but no concern for us. We couldn't shake the idea that something about this place is off, it's got that \"new-restaurant-still-working-out-the-kinks\" feeling. Our neighbors' order was missing an ingredient. The said they were out of whatever it was. We were told that several items weren't available that day...that kind of stuff. We were joined by another couple at the long table, bring us to six.  We ordered two Mic Drop bowls with the grilled cauliflower to share. Our server offered to bring out the cauliflower first, we said sure, she also mentioned that the tofu was a great option to share if we were interested in a different veggie appy. We said next time. We're not vegetarian, we just like cauliflower. After about 10 min someone else appeared with an order of fried calamari and dropped it between us. When our server came out we said we ordered the Cauliflower, not the squid. She said \"oh..I thought you said calamari\" which was odd because she was the one who mentioned tofu as another veggie appy when we ordered. Perhaps she thinks calamari and cauliflower are both vegetables? Anyway, she took it back and went to order the correct item. The people next to us got their food: he had a noodle bowl and she ordered a gluten-free salad. The server came out a few mins later to inform the woman-half that though the salad was indeed glluten-free, they don't actually offer a gluten-free salad DRESSING \"So I brought you some lemon slices\". If you've ever had raw veggies with only lemon juice squirted on them you can imagine how underwhelming that taste experience can be, which probably explains why the woman barely ate any of her salad. She happened to be pregnant and likely starving. I imagined there would be a snack stop in their immediate future somewhere else. Our bowls arrived as described. I noticed that the portions seemed a tad small, but that might have been due to the fact that having had no appy yet I was starving. The other thing was that both of our soups were warm, not at all hot. No steam whatsoever. I figured they heated it up just enough and then put the soup into cold bowls. I like my soup HOT. Because we were starving we decided to suck it up as by this point it had been almost 30min since we sat down and we never did get the cauliflower. Our server again appeared and said something about some ingredient for the cauliflower was not available so they decided they weren't bringing any out, \"but would we like to eat the bowl of calamari from before instead?\" Um, you mean the one we sent back 10min ago? No thanks. I will say that the soup, albeit tepid, was tasty. However, we live about a 20min drive from this place and are closer to better Asian noodle dining experiences. Perhaps this is growing pains? Perhaps the late-night experience is better with better staff? More menu options available.? We'll never know.  Ironically they have stickers everywhere that claim \"People Hate us on Yelp!\" If only they knew how ironic those are. I think we will just go for Pho next time as we'd planned, and continue our quest to discover a real Ramen experience in the valley elsewhere. SoSoBa is, well, so-so. So not what we were hoping for."}
{"text":"If u looking for something to eat this is the place to be? becuz the food tast just like the name soso."}
{"text":"Update: this place is not what it was before anymore. It used to be my favorite noodle place in Phoenix and I've always get S.U.V. But now, it's basically instant noodle with soup and 2 pieces of bok choy in it. See the picture for proof.  They gave me a discount and offered to make a new one for me. But the taste wasn't there anymore. I really loved this place, so it's really really disappointing :("}
{"text":"What a disappointment!!! LOVE Sosoba in Flagstaff. So when knowing Sosoba in Phoenix opens, we're VERY excited and looking forward to the same experience like in Flagstaff. I could probably overlooked poor customer service if I got great food. Not the case here, food looked delicious but very bland. Shishito peppers app was probably the best meal amongst others (dump truck salad, mic drop udon noodle, and Mr. Katsu ramen noodle). The dump truck salad was looking and tasting different than in Falgstaff. Both the udon and ramen soup broths were bland tasted like water. The ramen noodle was a bit underdone and hard boiled egg white had a weird consistency, almost like melt in your mouth bad. Would NOT be back here again, but most definitely will be back to Sosoba in Flagstaff."}
{"text":"I know, I know, ramen? In the Summer? In Phoenix? Yes!! The service was great. The food was fantastic. I got the \"so you're a vegan\" bowl and it was fantastic. Lots of veg and a zip of heat. My companion got the Mic drop. I'm calling it the pork explosion. He pronounced this our new ramen joint and it should be yours too."}
{"text":"Meh. I'm Taiwanese, and I was excited to try their bao (steamed bun) sandwiches. They didn't taste bad, but it was like the chef had never had bao before. The nice thing about this type of bread is that it's fluffy because it's steamed. That means it can absorb a lot of sauce and flavor. The contents of the sandwich were dry and had zero sauce. To top it off, they stick the bao on a griddle, which meant that this bread, supposed to be steamed and fluffy, was now crunchy. It was super weird. I don't know. It didn't taste bad, but it was nowhere near as good as it should've been."}
{"text":"I was first introduced to Sosoba in Flagstaff. Having had to move down to Phoenix, there have been quite a few things I missed: Sosoba included. Imagine my delight when I remembered there was a Sosoba down here!   I remember reading initial bad reviews and feeling puzzled. But, I figured it was because it was a new restaurant in a new area. Maybe this one had to sort out stuff the one in Flag already had.   Psh. There is nothing to sort out!   My boyfriend surprised me with my favorite: mic drop, and it was better than I remembered! There were so many separate flavors. It was perfect!"}
{"text":"To start off, I'm from California and the ramen there is outstanding. Full of flavor. Me and my boyfriend have been looking for a good ramen place in AZ and heard So Soba come up a couple of times so we were really excited to try it. The atmosphere is great but the ramen was such a disappointment. The broth tasted like water and I couldn't put anything in it to make it taste better. Also for the price of it, it was pretty small. The mac and cheese ball wasn't that great either. It was really bland and not creamy at all. I had high hopes for this place. I gave this place two stars because the servers are nice & it's not their fault the food is tasteless. The food was left unfinished and now we are going to eat street tacos."}
{"text":"This place was fabulous? I really enjoyed the 3 vegan options! SUV and green curry soba! Are fabulous. Service wasn't thrilling but I was there in a very large group. I will be back to give it another try for date night!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place, so I feel bad I can't give it more stars. Honestly, 3 is a stretch, but I so badly want this place to be good that I might even give it another try. I was introduced to their food at the Devour food festival this year. Their kimchee tostada and ramen broth was on point, so I had high expectations coming here. Sadly, it didn't make the mark. Maybe it's wishful thinking, but I'm guessing the place was just having a bad night. First round of drinks came out quickly, but once the place filled up, service got shaky. We waited for a pretty long time and when food came out, we were served way before our friends' plates arrived.  It wasn't all bad, my bonal negroni was perfect- nicely balanced with a big ice cube (which I love).  The dump truck salad was a nice mix of veggies and tepary beans (which you never see on menus- nice touch!). Unfortunately, the soy-citrus salad was lacking both soy and citrus flavoring. It just tasted like the salad was tossed in oil.   We ordered the mushroom lettuce wraps, but were given the pork belly instead. The waiter apologized and eventually brought us the right order. The slices of mushroom were covered in a very thick soy glaze. The sunamono salad was good, but there wasn't much of it. The lettuce we were meant to wrap it in was actually gross- brown on the edges and wilted- the kind I would throw straight into the compost pile at home. Fail.  We ordered the tantanmen ramen bowl The fried tofu balls, which we ordered to replace the ground pork was the best part. It came with a few mustard greens and bamboo shoots. The promised soft egg was missing- boo. I did not like the flavor of the broth and didn't want more than one bite. This is definitely not the same broth they served at the food festival.  I would have given up on this place completely, despite the fab cocktail, but our server made me want to rethink that decision. After my girlfriend (who weirdly loves the color yellow, dogs, and North Korea) commented how much she loved the poster of Kim Jong-un hanging in the bathroom, he gave her one. Super nice gesture... and it was a a cool poster.  Would definitely return for a negroni on the patio, but not sure on the food."}
{"text":"After consuming whole bottle of wine, I was deeply craving ramen. I was in town with my girlfriends for a quick visit, and one quick search on Yelp lead us to Sosoba.   After perusing the menu, The Mic Drop was calling my name. Of course by this point, I was pretty inebriated and didn't realize the dish came with  udon noodles instead of ramen. Good thing the waitress pointed it out and I immediately switched to ramen noodles.  10 minutes later, the 'not-piping' hot bowl of ramen arrives. The first thing I devour is the chicharon (fried pork rinds) that was soaking up the tonkotsu broth. One bite, and so far so good. In about 5 minutes, the contents in the bowl were gone.  Overall, the noodles tasted good cause I was drunk and the place is open until 2 am. However, in retrospect, I think if I was sober, it would only be 'ok.'"}
{"text":"So much potential but it's just so so.   I have been here a few times and tried several of the options.   Location: Great location for downtown dwellers. It is open late for late night bar-goers.  Park in the public parking garage off 3rd Avenue, near the Pita Jungle. This faces south and is within the Roosevelt Square apartments, Building C.   Service: So so. Sometimes, I had a very attentive waiter, but other times, the person is rarely around. I guess it just depends.   Food:  The soups are pretty good though rich.  I wanted to like the mac n cheese ball, but it was just somewhat bland. The texture is just right - delicious fried crusty crust on the outside of the rich melt in your mouth mac n cheese, but the cheese does not have any flavor. The soups are filling, and could easily be shared.   Drinks: Unique interesting drinks. They can be costly."}
{"text":"Had  a great meal in flag had to try it's sister restaurant  closer to where I live and was not let down at all great food and Service"}
{"text":"The search for a true tonkotsu ramen in Phoenix continues. I ordered the Mic Drop. The meats that were in it, while creative, were nothing exceptional. The chasu was almost entirely fat and there was a single piece. The most disappointing aspect was the broth. It tasted very similar to water and had zero umami. When I order tonkotsu I want a thick creamy brown/tan broth that has truly been cooked for 15-24 hours.  Still the ambiance was very mellow. The staff were nothing short of excellent. The music was on point. If only the ramen was any good I am sure I would be back."}
{"text":"Fun new spot downtown. Ramen was good and the mac n cheese balls were a new experience for us. Ambiance of restaurant is really nice and chill, with a variety of good music playing overhead. Appreciated the nice glass that draft beer was served in. Also noticed the restroom was extremely clean, thanks for that! Service and food delivery was a little slow, considering restaurant wasn't very busy, but didn't adversely impact our experience."}
{"text":"Been here at least a dozen times since they opened.  The ramen flavors are very nice.  Great cocktails as well.  I really miss \"half-y hour,\" but so it goes.    Two points for improvement (in my opinion): the last probably six times I've eaten here, the broth/noodle ramen combo is lukewarm to room temp, at best.  Why?  Ramen is supposed to be piping hot, and eaten that way.  Maybe this is by the chef's design, I don't know, but I don't understand it, it's way better when it's hot, and that would seem to be something easily accomplished.  Second point, the ramen is now usually served with minimal broth.  If you ask for extra broth they'll give it to you, so that's an easily solvable 'problem.'    Overall, some of the tastiest ramen bowls I've had in the valley.  And I've been most other places."}
{"text":"BLERGH! When this place first opened they had a great team and they knew how to execute a unique and flavor packed menu. However, I will never go back for even as much as a beer as the place stank to high heaven of rotten fish and my Karl Katsu had zero flavor, other than the rotting Narutomaki I had to spit out. Get your kitchen together and learn your own menu, you had so much potential."}
{"text":"I hate this place so much . I ordered the Sweet Chili Glazed Udon I hated it so much  I ordered more to take home after. The service was so awful!  so tipped her $10 extra! The bar mojito was terrible I had buzz immediately! and I tipped even more cause of that.  I don't recommend this place unless ............ you want the best udon soup in your life!  Then be miserable and go there then! Fair warning!"}
{"text":"I was looking forward to this spot but damn was I disappointed.. the service was bad, it was a slow day and they still took a while to acknowledge I was even there. Plus the ramen I had lacked flavor and tasted like warm water mixed with a bottle of soy sauce.. like I said. Disappointed"}
{"text":"I had high hopes for SoSoBa. We're always looking for places to eat downtown that have decent vegan options. The menu was very promising - several items either were vegan by default or could be made so with small tweaks.   We started with the Fried Tofu and Thai Peanut. The tofu squares were great! They were lightly breaded and fried perfectly. The peanut sauce was more like peanut butter with a bit of soy sauce, with sriracha on top of half of it. It wasn't bad - it just wasn't great. Admittedly, I'm a peanut sauce snob, but this didn't come close to being crave-worthy.  For the entrees, I had the S.U.V. with tofu and my husband had the Yakisoba with tofu. The S.U.V. had a light but fairly bland flavor. The tofu was sparse and the same type as the appetizer tofu. I wanted to spice up the sauce but it was a very unique green curry flavor so I couldn't figure out which of the multiple sauces offered in the cart would work with it. It was a generous portion, so I ate just enough to be full.   The Yakisoba was similarly underwhelming. The peanut sauce was more \"saucy\" than what came with the appetizer, but the dish needed more soy sauce to add flavor. It was actually fairly dry.   I'd like to think maybe I just didn't order the best items, but I wasn't impressed enough to want to go back. The service was fantastic and the location is great. I really wanted to like it more!"}
{"text":"Bring back centurion. If you're a psycho crazy vegan who likes nothing but $12 plates of ramen this place is for you"}
{"text":"We ordered ramen, the fried cauliflower, and peanut tofu to go. I was disappointment with the flavor of all dishes. It just didn't have any flavor. I couldn't even finish the ramen because it was so bland."}
{"text":"I really, really, really, don't understand how this place has a rating lower than Bitter & Twisted (also in the downtown area, for those who may not know).   The food here is similarly priced, but of a much higher quality. The restaurant is smaller, but also doesn't have Kayne blasting so loudly that you can't talk to whoever you came with. The food was warm, cooked right, and very flavorful. As you can tell from some of the other reviews, the typical ASU hipsters (and their parents) from Michigan, Wisconsin, Ohio, etc, come here with a palate incapable of tasting any seasoning other than your basic salt and pepper. Maybe try In-n-Out instead?  I don't like to be such a hater, but I'm just telling it like it is.   We had fun doodling in the waitress' notebook--also, the drinks here are powerful!  Can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"I think I found a new favorite bar. There was plenty of space at the full bar, which faces the open kitchen on one side. We started with a Mai Tai (a bit in the sweet side but unique and delicious), and a Coin Toss Sidecar, Orange. As an appetizer, we got the Sweet Chili Calamari. This is definitely not generic calamari. It was fried perfectly tender and the hint of glaze was super yummy. Our mains were two noodle bowls: the Mic Drop and the Tantanmen.  I am a big spicy ramen fan, so Tantanmen was perfect for me. The noodles were perfect and the broth, although modest in proportion, was super flavorful. I wasn't a huge fan of the kale, but the soft-boiled egg, ground pork, bamboo shoots and green onions made up for it.  My husband's Mic Drop with thick udon noodles was much milder and a pork lover's dream: pork rind, pork belly, bacon, you name it.  As Emeril would say, happy happy!  The service at the bar was excellent and quick. We will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"The ramen here is just okay. It's definitely a fusion type of restaurant. The pork broth did not seem like the traditional pork broth to me. I ordered the mic-drop and felt like there was just too much going on with that bowl. The kimchi was too sour and the egg and meat were salty. The service was really great. They were very attentive."}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant on the recommendation of a friend on Saturday, November 5th for lunch. We sat outside, as the restaurant was close and the climate was very nice outside. Menu was very limited and hard to read as many of the ingredients I had no clue about. Waitress did not know her menu either and apologized by saying that they had changed the menu since she was last at work and that she only worked on weekends. What a brainiac! Why does she even work here? Had to ask for plates and silverware as I don't do chopsticks. They have no knives, so all I got was a fork. Ordered 2 appletinis. Waitress said they don't have the ingredients to make that, so I ordered a cosmopolitan and a whisky drink for my friend. Ordered 4 balls on fire which were okay, but only the sirachi made them this way. Dump Truck Salad with chicken and a noddle bowl. Salad had way too much basil on  it, and was filled with low value nutrient vegetables like corn and carrots. Dressing was okay, but again was overwhelmed by the basil. Waitress did not know anything about the menu, and had to ask others. As for my friends food, it was about as impressive as the salad. $60 was the final bill for lunch. I will never go back. The place was way understaffed and it showed. I could not wait to leave."}
{"text":"Recommended by a friend! And we will definitely come back- we love Ramen! Coming from Hawaii definitely different type (noodle are thicker then the usual Ramen noodle) I prejudged it and all it took was 1 bite and it is sooo yummy! Hits the spot for Comfort food! Would definitely recommend this to anyone! Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Good noodles cute patio that's pet friendly.  They have happy hour with good prices! Very very nice female server but it can get busy and there is not enough staff to service all guests.  Seems they need to hire more people!!!  Our second visit leaving happy!!!"}
{"text":"First time here and service was definitely better than the food but that's okay!!! As soon as we walked in we saw a sticker that said \"people hate us on yelp\" so I didn't expect the best lol... I loved that our server was very knowledgeable and patient when we asked questions about the menu. Food definitely lacked flavor, but I did appreciate the late night hours and that the kitchen was open until 2am. The checkbook presenter was fun to look at, my boyfriend and I added some more art and quotes to it lol Might be back for some more sake ;)"}
{"text":"Everyone who works here is a boss. Chefs seriously take pride in their food and the bartenders make the best drinks! I come here at minimum once a month. My favorite dish is the sweet Chile glazed udon noodles. Really confused as to why these guys don't have 4+ stars, they definitely deserve it.  Thanks for always providing consistency and radical service."}
{"text":"I can't believe I don't come here more often.  The service is fantastic!  The food is even better!"}
{"text":"Wow! So good, fresh and friendly. We had to come two days in a row! Something for everyone and they are great about remembering any special needs. I can't wait to bring my mom here when she visits this winter,"}
{"text":"This is the worst ramen I've had yet. Salt.... so much salt..... it was so salty that it was legit one spoon less of the lethal dosage. I was about to go blind. So soba should be call SoMorton salty. I had their Drop the Mic and let's say I was about to drop the bowl after eating that, cause my muscles were going into atrophy.   I'm just glad I was able to drive home cause I'm pretty sure my visions were getting blurry. Never again, mate. Also, they had one waitress do everything. Come on.... that's kinda cruel. In addition, it doesn't taste remotely like soba or ramen. It's just salty broth with udon. 12$ for that is absurd. And their appetizer sweet chili calamari was just plain diabetic sweet. Where's the flavor and spice man??   Sorry but I'll never return to try anything here when you can't even get ramen right. Peace"}
{"text":"Although the service was great the food was lacking, granted I am comparing it to the Noodle Bar where they import noodles and make broth from scratch. I'm not saying the food was bad, it was actually good but just not as good as other ramen. The matcha tea was super on point and I loved the idea of the chili bar (all types of hot sauce on a rolling bar cart). It's a great alternative if other places are closed, because Sosaba stays open till 2am! Which is awesome for us late night owls."}
{"text":"It was not bad but it wasn't the best. The Noddles where a bit uncooked. I wouldn't go again honestly"}
{"text":"So done with the overpriced mediocre food in  downtown. Sosoba in flagstaff is off the chain, not a bad thing on the menu. Somehow this gets lost in translation at the Phx location. I ordered the Hostile takeover bowl, very bland and very little broth. Also, the lack of 1/2 off happy hour like the flagstaff location makes the  food that much worse. I love this store and want to see it thrive but there are some major things to be addressed before I would call this an equal to the flagstaff location. Also the website is horrible to navigate, has no menu and wrong number for Phoenix location."}
{"text":"So so so good!!! I love ramen but have had a few not so good bowls. I must say this was not what of those. The broth was just perfect, flavorful but not overpowering and those noodles!!! Wow! Honestly i was enjoying the food so much that did not put much attention on the place itself so I dont think i can comment on that"}
{"text":"This quite the satirical restaurant. It has a humor. But it's hard to get. Not for everyone I would say. Laid back in many aspects, but passionate all around. New restaurant with working kinks. Struggling with a poor pool of cooks, who have possibly given the place a bad rep. Homemade kimchi. Home made tofu. Home made broths, as expected, fermented chef inspired spicy sauces.   It's confusing. You walk in and you're encouraged to sit anywhere. No host stand. The joke has started. A bar next to the line. Low light. Hipster Asian inspired decour. Japanese whiskey. Funny name. Get it? Neither do I...   What I can tell you is, the cooks, the two I talked to on a Wednesday night, really cares what they did. Manager and bartender, though at first didn't give me the hour of the day, did provide a pleasant restaurant experience afterwards. Definitely suggest sitting at the bar/chef's table. Get the mic drop bowl. You won't be disappointed. Actually, it made me re think of my life decisions. Share the cauliflower. Sip on a whiskey on the rocks. Enjoy the vibe and local art work. It is located in Roosevelt row after all, the art district of Phoenix.   Phoenix is an up and coming scene. From someone in the culinary industry, though some dishes on the salty side, like the kimchi, you will enjoy a great evening in this restaurant. It's still new, keep that in mind. Give it a chance."}
{"text":"So delicious and pleasantly surprised by their happy hour menu. You must order the balls of fire (Mac n cheese with Sriracha)! They are covered in panko and just oh so good. Awesome food and drink specials. A real treat on Roosevelt."}
{"text":"these guys really set themselves up with their name...  SoSo-Nah, SoSo-Huh?, SoSo-uhhh, SoSo-blah, etc.  Had high hopes for this place bc I love a nice bowl of ramen, but I think Merichelle's review said it best- \"emphasis on the 'SoSo'\"  I came, I ate, and I have no desire to return. A pretty forgettable meal that just really didnt impress on the flavor front. I ordered the Mic Drop- just like a salty cauldron of some items that all varied in mouthfeel. it lacked the complexity that makes ramen great.  I would say try it for yourself. Maybe I am wrong. but I didn't taste what I needed in order to want to return"}
{"text":"Sosoba, is a unique ramen noodle shop, Asian influences also the 2nd location in Arizona. The first one is located in flagstaff. It's located exactly in downtown Phoenix, central and Roosevelt. When you go in you either seat yourself or a host helps you either one depending on how busy it is. When you walk inside the ambience is very Asian fusion and very modern with its lowlights and dark reds palette, energy of the feng shui is good.  The restaurant is fairly new so I Understand. I sat at the bar and I exactly knew what I wanted. Sosoba specializes in specialty ramen and has a house made broth. They can also adjust any recipe for your dietary needs like vegan options and vegetarian options. Everything on the menu looks absolutely delicious, if you are willing to spend menu try one of the appetizers but if you just want ramen definitely recommend that, I ordered the Mic Drop which is 12 dollars and very worth all of your coins. Udon Noodles, Pork Belly, Carnitas, Chicharon, Ham Fries, Soft Boiled Egg, House Made Kimchi, scallions and bacon in tontakatsu 15-h broth. Well if y'all feeling soupy and noodl-ey come by to sosoba! Stay hungry phoenix ."}
{"text":"Coming from two bartenders, this was by far the worst dining experience we have ever had. We frequently go to the sosoba noodles in flagstaff and thought we'd give Phoenix a try. Service was terrible, food was even worse. We were greated at the bar probably 5-10 minutes after we sat, not the worst other than there was only one table in the restaurant. He didn't ask anything other than what we wanted to drink and eat. After the food was delivered I took one bite of the mathra (the same bowl I order every time) and wanted to spit it out. It tasted completely different, no flavor, no spice, different noodles, and the tofu was undercooked. I asked for more curry sauce to try and save it, after the cook handed me a bowl of cold curry I almost walked out. Now my foods cold and I'm still hungry. Our katsu tasted like water... we were never asked how our food was and about 20 minutes later when I was asked if I wanted a box after only taking a few bites I replied no. We were handed our check with out even being asked if we wanted it. Our tab was $40.18 I left $40.25. I have never in my life not tipped someone at least 20% but to be quite honest they didn't even deserve the 7 cents I left. Flagstaff come teach this location how it's done!"}
{"text":"Was delicious , so spicy. Forgot what I had but was amazing. You can change anything you want , broths , noodles and proteins. Slurrrrpppp"}
{"text":"Stopped by for a drink with a large group on a Saturday night. It was pretty dead, so we got seated right away and our orders were taken pretty quickly thereafter. We got drinks and appetizers. The sake was decent, and they even had a local sake that some of the members in our group tried. It wasn't as good as the Japanese sake but respectable. Unfortunately, it was $32 a bottle! Whereas the Japanese sake I got was $12 a bottle and tasted better in my opinion. We also got edamame and their Mac and cheese balls. The edamame was seasoned with a spicy seasoning that was flavorful but it could have used more salt. I didn't try the Mac and cheese balls, but those who did said they were good."}
{"text":"We have lived in the area for a while and ate at this place a few times when it was Centurion (and just mediocre). When we walked in, we were instantly greeted in a kind manner and were able to choose our seats. We were impressed with how well they opened up the inside area. The menu was smaller, but we thought there was a good variety of options with the ability to modify the recipes to your dietary needs (ex gluten free, vegan, etc). We had the mac and cheese balls to start which were good. We both had a different bowl (SUV and MIC) and loved them both! The ingredients and all the flavors were amazing, and the noodles were great!  The portions were generous and enough for two meals. The service was friendly and the food came out quickly. The only recommendation would be to work on the seating on the patio since it is such a small space, especially with fall around the corner. I'm so happy to have a good new restaurant with a different variety of food and late night hours in the downtown area."}
{"text":"So freaking delicious! I am still seated at the restaurant with friends and we all are very happy with the tasty food and excellent service. We started with Pilsner beer and Sweet Chile calamari. We decided to share 3 different bowls of noodles. The Mic Drop was our favorite (for pork meat lovers) followed by Katsu Ramen and Yakisoba. All was delicious!"}
{"text":"Yummy ramen! Good enough service! Get the Tantanmen ramen! Still haven't tried their drink menu but I've heard good things."}
{"text":"We sat at the bar and got to watch the chefs cook all of our food...We started with the Pork belly zzam.. I have to say I am not a fan of fatty meats and it was delicious! Then I had Karl katsu and my husband had hostile take over. We were both extremely pleased with the meals. The chicken on the katsu is to die for.. even ordered extra. Great job chef Tyler"}
{"text":"My first ever noodle experience!!!!! This place is so good and the cook and server made the experience for me! They were super friendly and made great recommendations. The only reason it's not 5 stars is because it was super hot in there."}
{"text":"I don't understand why there are so many reviews 3stars and u see other than the fact that people are being pretentious about a relaxed vibe... my wife, daughter, and I went in this afternoon and it was f**king amazing and the staff was so welcoming and were all about seeing the baby eat kimchi and ramen for her first time. Easily the best ramen I have been able to find in Phoenix hands down! The spice level was on point, the noodles were perfect! The only disappointing this is that they don't do the soy egg anymore but regardless the egg was perfect! I totally recommend adding pork belly to the bowl. It's crispy and the fat was rendered perfectly on the top. The Mac and cheese balls with the \"fire\" sauce were stupid good and I totally recomendable them, super crispy exterior but creamy interior and the pasta inside still had a bite to it. The kimchi is to die for and totally almost ordered 2 more sides just to take them home to have extra in my fridge. If you want to have the best ramen in the valley but feel like your eating at your closest friends house enjoying a meal with chill company this is totally the place for you. I will probably be back on a weekly basis! Thank you SoSoBa staff"}
{"text":"Chill vibe. Staff is friendly and the food  came out quick and fresh. Great noodle spot eat downtown."}
{"text":"Amazing! Totally recommend the fried cauliflower. The service is amazing and very kind. Totally recommend this place to anyone. Very clean, nice thing is it's on Roosevelt row, so it's close to everything."}
{"text":"I went in with no real expectations, but left very happy.  I was impressed with both the food and service. Our waiter was very helpful in explaining the menu and gave us perfect recommendations, as we were vegetarians and not noodle experts.  The flavors in the S.U.V. dish were devine.  I left feeling full but not bloated.  The ambiance was classy yet very low-key, seating outside with lighting also added a nice touch.  Will definitely be back.  Great spot for dates or to catch up with a few friends."}
{"text":"Opening night for restaurants can be tough. Not for these guys. They absolutely rocked it! We were immediately welcomed, watered, and asked what else could be brought. The cauliflower dish is fantastic. The staff is friendly and attentive. We're immediate regulars! Congrats to you, Sosoba!"}
{"text":"Still in search for authentic ramen... Went here and started out with the Tso Tso Cauliflower, which was pretty darn delicious. After that my partner and I decided to try two different types of ramen. We tried the Mic Drop and the Tantanmen.   The Mic Drop was not that great, which might have been because the flavor was so strange....  The Tantanmen was pretty decent. The flavor was quite nice, but still it didn't have that full hearty/savory flavor that authentic ramen has. So I would say it was ok. Nothing special.... Umami's tantanmen outshines this any and every day of the week."}
{"text":"SoSoBa - emphasis on the \"SoSo\"! But I think they know it- the restaurant displays stickers that say \"People HATE us on Yelp\", and though I initially thought this was meant to be ironic, I would soon find out the truth. The d√©cor is Asian eclectic, and it's endearing. There's a cart full of hot sauces for what I imagine is DIY spicing for restaurant-goers, and hilarious posters of Godzilla and Kim Jong Il as a baby on a dog (or what I interpret as Kim Jong Il). The bar stools are a deep red with large cushions for big butts, which I appreciate!, and they have a pretty decent happy hour from 3-6.  We ordered drinks, the Ball of Fire, the Tso Tso Cauliflower, and the Mic Drop. The Ball of Fire was a mac n' cheese ball breaded with a dollop of sriracha on it; it tasted completely bland and unappetizing. The Tso Tso Cauliflower tasted just as it sounds, and had the very familiar taste of General Tso's from a fast food Chinese restaurant at the mall. Finally, the Mic Drop had a lot of things going on, including Ham Fries (ham cut in long strips) and pork rinds, and it felt like someone must have had the munchies when they conjured up the recipe. Unfortunately, the bowl was just too overwhelming and mediocre at best: it was sodium in a bowl, but not the good kind. The highlight of the entire experience was my Mai Tai, which tasted beautifully, and the bartender was very nice, but this is a restaurant, not just a bar. All in all, our bill came out to less than $30, not terrible for the Roosevelt Arts District, but for \"SoSo\" food, so disappointing that we will not return."}
{"text":"This place has the most delicious noodle soup: 'The Mic Drop'. It's super loaded with flat soba noodle (rice noodle is an option if u want), pork belly, ham, bacon, chicharr√≥n, scallions, carnitas, and ...... the result is the best, tastiest, soul warming soup. Love love it. And the drinks are also very tasty. Highly recommend it. Great hospitality from the management and the cooks."}
{"text":"Crazy about the sweet chili tofu! We also love the cauliflower and the bowls. Fun place to hang out, friendly service. Overall a great spot."}
{"text":"I predict this place not lasting too long.   Unless people come here for the drinks, this place won't last based on the food.  Great balls of fire wasn't great and didn't have any fire (heat I'm assuming). The mic drop was way too busy and the flavors fought with each other to where it didn't taste good.  The katsu was better but still lacking anything special. For the price they need to refine their soups to make them better and add more noodles and broth.   I will add this was late, after a night of drinking where anything is suppose to taste good."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I decided to come here for dinner. We love ramen and he's a ramen freak so why not right? This place literally open a week ago when we came here on Sunday. The decor and everything in here was Mediocre. Nothing fancy nor an eye catcher for me.   The fire ball Mac and cheese was good. But it threw me off to have it at a ramen restaurant.   The mic drop - has prom belly in it. He said it was good.   I ordered the vegetarian, Mr. Karl Katsu. I eliminated the chicken, bacon and carrots. (I don't really care for carrots) but he did add broccoli for me since they didn't have tofu at the moment. He was very apologetic and sincere that they just open and they don't have a lot of items.  My egg was super salty. I didn't eat that. The ramen was decent. Edible. The corn was crunchy and it went well with my soup. flavorful and colorful. I wish it was more temperature hot though. And my broccoli to be cooked please.   It's wasn't anything for me to brag about. I'll come back when it's couple weeks in when they're all set and have everything ready."}
{"text":"Wasn't bad, wasn't outstanding. Service was prompt and professional but the food left something to be desired. We arrived at the end of happy hour and I ordered Tso Tso Cauliflower and 2 Balls of Fire. I'd go back for the cauliflower. The crust on the Balls of Fire was rancid, so we peeled off the outer layer and enjoyed the mac n cheese on the inside.  We came ultimately in search of broth and noodles. While I found that with my Mic Drop, mom's  Mr. Katsu was all noodle and very little broth. She had me taste the carrots within her dish, she described it as perfume-y and mushy, the flavor to me was fruity but the one thing it didn't taste like was carrots.  She wanted broth-y ramen and that wasn't it.   As for my Mic Drop, I would have to say the star was the chicarron. The soft egg was strangely mushy and salty, the pork belly good, the ham fries I mixed in along with the carnitas, smokey bonito flakes and scallions. I can't say I was impressed by the broth or flavor, but it was made better when I encountered the brine-y kimchi  in a bite. I did enjoy the texture of the udon noodles.   Would I go back? Yeah, eventually but most likely for happy hour and not necessarily for the food.  Would I recommend it? Meh, it wouldn't be top on my list of other places to try in the area."}
{"text":"After driving back from Hollywood for a weekend trip, I got home tired and hungry. I called in an order for two Karl Katsu's with Tonkotsu broth. Having ordered pho and ramen for pickup before, I asked if they separated the noodles to prevent them from getting soggy and gross. They said not only could they do that but that they typically separate all the toppings from the broth.   Cut to 10 minutes later I pick up the two bowls which have nothing separated. Not a deal breaker but a bummer. At least I hadn't thought it was a deal breaker.   Not mentioned on the menu are the confetti shreds of seaweed in the ramen. Unfortunately it's an intolerable flavor for me. I definitely would've asked for it to be removed. The way it's cut makes it impossible to remove plus the flavor is released into the broth immediately.   The ramen was inedible. The katsu chicken was soggy and lacked any texture. The seaweed wrecked shop on the broth. If the toppings were separated, I could have at least given the thing a chance. Just like that, out $27 and I still had to eat something else.   We tried to pawn it off on the kids who were excited as they like Cherryblossom. Text message a few minutes later: \"Mom take the ramen back. It's bad.\"  Maybe I'll go for drinks but I won't be back for ramen. Consider some standard setting on your takeout orders."}
{"text":"This is NOT ramen, but they don't claim to be, so relax and enjoy the wonderful things they have to offer! The drinks are strong and the food is good and fresh! Fair warning - the ground pork has a kick to it! Great service and laid back atmosphere - you can't ask for more than that!"}
{"text":"Not good for groups. We were a group of 8. Of the 8 orders 6 of them came out incorrectly and 1 never came out at all. Servers kept making excuses and final result was never delivered. One should never spend 2 hours at a restaurant without eating. Think again before coming here."}
{"text":"I am a huge ramen fan, so when I saw SoSoBa was opening near my house, I was hoping the Phoenix location would prove to be better than the Flagstaff location (which has terrible food... I do not understand the positive reviews). Unfortunately, this location was equally not awesome. Again, this place is highly regarded by critics, but I don't understand it because the food is overpriced and just not good. A friend and I came late -ish at night (around 10). We started with cocktails, which were actually fairly good. I tried the Heyday Mainstay which was essentially a moscow mule. It's the reason for the second star. For food, I tried the tan tan men (which I was excited to see on their menu because the rest of their ramen options are taken from the Flag location and I have already tried them and know I don't like them). My friend got the Mothra (essentially noodles in green curry). My tan tan men was 12$ and the bowl was about half the size of any other ramen bowl in town. I asked the waitress if the bowl could be made extra spicy.... it was not spicy at all. She then gave me a bunch of sauces to add to the bowl to make it spicy (which were good, but didn't complement the flavor of the ramen). The ramen lacked flavor and the pork had a weird chew to it. I disliked it so much, I did not eat the leftovers I took home (which is completely unlike me). The Mothra was better, but not by much. The tofu was nicely fried. The green curry was lacking in overall flavor. Both my friend and I were not impressed.   PS - we returned for drinks a week or two after we had the food, and had mixed experience. Their raspberry drink was fairly tasty, whereas the Osaka Smash was pretty much undrinkable...so strong.... ugh."}
{"text":"Came in w a longtime gf last night to catch up and was pleasantly surprised after reading some of the mixed reviews. For those of you who complained that the food is spicy well, don't be such a wuss cuz it was hardly spicy!! Also it wasn't bland nor were the portions small like some of you complained about. It's a ramen/noodle place and it was very flavorful w huge portions!!! So whoever complained that the portions were tiny, well I had to take a to go box since I couldn't even make a dent in my noodles!! I grew up living in LA and being Asian, I have extremely high standards when it comes to ramen/noodle places!! What I really appreciated was all the different types of hot sauces they had that accommodated the dishes you ordered. We started off each with a glass of Sauvignon Blanc wine. The wine was really good and it was a good size pour. We ordered the balls of fire which are spicy mac n cheese balls. Our server brought us different hot sauces that would go well w our balls of fire! I loved this hot sauce pairing!! The mac n cheese balls were amazing!! Crispy on the outside and warm and gooey on the inside! Then I ordered the mothra which is soba noodles, tofu, broccoli in curry. Our server brought out more hot sauces that would go perfect with this dish!! Perfect pairings and the noodles were amazing!! I would have liked the soba noodles a little more al dente but it was still absolute heaven in my mouth. Overall, I am very pleased with this spot not to mention I could walk here. I highly recommend this place and for those of you who try it, to keep an open mind like I did and you will have a wonderful experience!!"}
{"text":"Under cooked clumpy noodles in over spiced soup with crappy service to finish it off. I literally had to go look for my server to get our check because he didn't check on us once after he dropped off our food."}
{"text":"Eh. The waiter wasn't the most pleasant, but he was also the only one serving. The Balls of Fire weren't anything special. The Cherry Glazed wings hardly had any flavor. The ramen noodles were bland and floury. The broth of the Tantanmen was good though. I'm not planning on coming back."}
{"text":"Awesome happy hour. The tostadas were amazing and a great (and cheap) craft beer selection. Great service too!"}
{"text":"The first time I went here, ramen was awesome! I ordered the Katsu Ramen. I was so impressed by the broth which was a blend of miso and corn. So yummy. I went again last night with my husband and mom. I raved to both of them about how good the ramen was. Ordered the same meal last night. The broth was totally different and whole dish overall horrible. Was told the broth changed to miso only. Would have been something to share before we ordered. The whole ramen dosh was bland. My husband and I ordered the same thing and were sick later that evening. We won't be going back."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Try the mic drop, it's ridiculous!! I've been here three times already and I know I'll be back. It's walking distance from my place so I'm lucky. The spot is trendy, hip and chill. I'm in love with the Mic Drop, but the Tantanmen ramen bowl is great too. I found a new place and I can't wait to bring my friends and family. I'm sure they're gonna love it here too."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant. I love the food, the ambiance, the service and the music. It is very chill.  I can get lunch at 3:00pm have an amazing bowl of Udon noodles with vegetables and tofu and one of their amazing Fire Balls - think of a Mac and Cheese ball deep fried.  They are a Ramen house but today special as a bowl of poke, with a lot of extras.  They can make most dishes vegan.  I could eat there three days a week, and probably will.  They have a great bar and a bunch of great draft beers.  If you are working they have Wi-Fi."}
{"text":"Wow where do I start. I'll have to go with our server Christian. Absolutely spectacular. I have not seen any individual in my two years in the valley demonstrate such perfect customer service. He went above and beyond to meet our requests with a smile. I also witnessed him be a genuine good soul to a seemingly distraught/homeless man who came in for water. He did me an awesome favor of holding the last bottle of my favorite beer for my next visit too!   To go on.... the atmosphere was great for the date night I was on with my wife and it seemed like a good bar location too for a cocktail with friends. Outdoor seating looked inviting as well.   The food was delicious. We ordered the cauliflower and peppers and they both exceeded expectations. For entrees I got the cold soba salad which was awesome and my wife got the SUV meal which was good but could've used a little more flavor. It smelled divine though!!   Overall we will definitely be visiting again and bringing friends next time. Thanks for a great experience!"}
{"text":"Nice Place and Great Food! Me and my partner tried this place the first time and we both enjoyed it. In a great location as well!"}
{"text":"First time eating here and it was a fantastic experience! We will definitely be back!  Our server was fantastic, he was very helpful and gave us great recommendations. We ordered the bao buns, shishito peppers, and The Mic Drop.   The presentation was beautiful and the food is very tasty. It has a nice urban, upscale atmosphere."}
{"text":"This place is out of control good. It is a noodle bar made for the millennials. If you like that scene, this is the place. The dishes are great, they have real beer, or you can get PBR in a can. They have an entire cart of hot sauces! Probably 100 different bottles to choose from. The server we had was really friendly and helpful. Bonus points, the check comes in a journal. So as you wait you can flip through the book and see how witty the customers before you were. Good vibes at this spot."}
{"text":"Let's start with the first impression. We came in on a Saturday afternoon. The restaurant was busy. The server said \"take a seat at any open table you can find.\" Two open table both with dirty dishes left from previous customers. We stood by a table for a while out of the way. My wife approached a server and asked for a tray to help clean the table. The server said \"just give me a bit\". Ok, they are busy with Saturday afternoon lunch customers and only 2 servers. The food is ok. That's all I can say about this restaurant.  I went back alone on 10/19/2017. Must have been another bad night. The bartender was the sever and bartender. Only 5 customers in the restaurant all sitting at the bar. I say at a table and asked for a calamari appetizer and one of the entire they have on the menu. The sever/bartender brought the entree first. I asked about the calamari and she said I don't remember that. I did ok. I finished the entree and had to go up to the bar and ask for the bill. No need to go back. The food is ok. The service is bad. The restaurant has so much curb appeal in the area."}
{"text":"First of all, I ordered to pick up in the restaurant. The guy seemed to hate his life so much that he literally ran and practically threw my food at me and ran away again so stressed out. Not even a hello. Not a \"enjoy\"... nothing. It was so rude. And the food was so bland. No flavor. Disappointing."}
{"text":"Very so so soba. The weather finally cooled down significantly today so on this cloudy day with light rain, we were really looking forward to some hot ramen. We've been to the Flagstaff location twice and it was great, so naturally we were expecting more of the same- but it turned out to be quite a disappointment (especially for $12 ramen). I got the Mic Drop. Both of our ramen broth tasted very watered down and tepid temperature as many here have repeatedly noted - same temperature as a cup of coffee left out for 15 minutes. It definitely didn't taste like \"15-hour tonkotsu broth\" as written on the menu. Not only are the portion almost 1/2 the size of the Flagstaff location, but there's also not enough broth for the noodles. When I brought up the issue of the broth not being up to par compared to the Flagstaff location, I was told they opened recently and the kitchen is smaller, so they're unable to make broth to the standards of the other location. That struck me as quite strange as the Flagstaff location is a tiny hole in the wall - like Japanese studio apartment size. However, this location is at least 8-10 times bigger! It's huge. So why would the kitchen be smaller?! It makes zero sense. I was told they will expand the kitchen in a couple of months. We'll see. Maybe I'll give it another try in 3 months during happy hour. The service was good though. But the food portions, flavor, and quality are seriously lacking and need to be addressed quickly."}
{"text":"There are many other restaurants serving good ramen and drinks. This would be my last last choice in AZ."}
{"text":"Great food and wait staff.  We went for an informal business meeting last night and couldnt get enough of the califlower and calimari appetizers, the sauces were to die for.   The Ramen bowls were super tasty!  The Mic Drop was aromatic, flavorful, and it was beautiful watch the flowering  response of whatever it was they put on top respond to the heat.  We will be back!!"}
{"text":"Sosono.  Fire ball - good.  Calamari - great.  Mic drop - meh. Too salty for my liking. Felt like I had a sample platter of bbq with a side of noodles. Not enough broth and it was barely past luke warm.  Service - friendly and attentive.   Maybe I'll try again in a couple months..."}
{"text":"It's a fusion restaurant with an identity crisis. For starters It's so damn dark they ostracize the demographic of people that like to read menus. The local art on the walls doesn't go with the decor at all.. Music: Loud generic rock and roll music, I think \"living on a prayer\" was playing which is ironic because that's what the restaurant is doing. The pork was so dry It felt like I was chewing on driftwood. We sent it back and they comped it. The wings were good. I've heard the ramen is decent. 2/5 for vibes 3/5 for food"}
{"text":"Nice location, setup, and we had great service. The food was pretty good- large servings of ramen, pretty tasty, lots of noodles, and no skimping on toppings, though I have to admit my noodles were a bit overcooked and soggy. My friend's noodles were fine, so maybe I just got unlucky there.   FYI- there's a vegan option for those interested, and it's pretty tasty too."}
