{"text":"They have the best smoothies here on Earth!!!  Not only is this a great breakfast spot, but they have amazing hemp and CBD products.  The CBD patches are a miracle and work when you have pain that won't go away otherwise. Don't forget to have a hemp infused waffle while you are there!"}

{"text":"Friendly staff and their trail mix smoothie is like heaven in your mouth. Definitely coming back to try a latte and everything else on the menu"}
{"text":"I found this place through my sister who was signing up for medical cannabis in Pekin IL.  I placed my first online order Friday, January 19, 2017 and received it Monday, January 22, 2017.  Super impressed with the processing and shipping of my order.  

I ordered CBD oil and Paw Puddy for my old dog and the Flea and Tick spray for all 3 of my dogs. The oil didn't have a recommended dosage.  So, I called the store and talked to Tyler.  Tyler was exceptionally helpful.  


Now, we wait and see how the products work."}
{"text":"Looking to live your life in a more natural way? Hempful farms is an interesting take on breakfast and what it is to be healthy. They sell Hemp based products and offer wonderful breakfast and lunch items on the menu!"}
{"text":"I like it so far!  Veggie chorizo burrito and apple/kale smoothie were great!  Gluten free and vegan options make me very happy!  Nice people!  Welcome to the neighborhood.  Looking forward trying more menu items."}
{"text":"Love the concept! Food was good, I had a pretty standard breakfast meal. I like that my biscuits and gravy were topped with hemp seed, and the gravy itself had a good flavor! I think the food was standard breakfast food- nothing wrong with that- I think they are smart for doing normal stuff to introduce people to what hemp has to offer. I'm glad they are in the neighborhood, I will certainly be back!"}
{"text":"Sadly this place appears to be closed. Building is locked and empty. I hope they're just moving locations..."}
{"text":"I'm looking forward to going back and bringing my vegan friend. My sandwich was great and I had no guilt eating it since they use fresh healthy ingredients. There's a lot on the menu I want to try,  so I gore this place sticks around for awhile."}
{"text":"Love their holistic approach to a cafe! I can only praise them in carrying CBD products made from hemp to help my my son's 8 year battle with schizophrenia. Natural works over every pharmaceutical the FDA has approved for my son. It is more than some new faze. Love ya Hempful Farms Cafe!"}
{"text":"I wish that I could give this place a higher review because there were some things I loved about it! Unfortunately there were a few downsides as well. First off this place is pretty cool, doesn't look like much on the outside or inside, but all of the hemp treats were on display and looked amazing. Also if you check into yelp you can get a free coffee! 
I had never been here before, and both the guys working there were super nice and helpful, one told me all about their food and stuff, was interesting! A unique cafe experience.
One downside was I think there might be a spider problem..found one crawling on my legs, then another customer found one on the ground.
I decided to order a breakfast burrito. I told him that I was a vegetarian and he recommended I get soy chorizo. I don't like soy chorizo so I told him I'd just get it with vegetables instead, he misunderstood and my breakfast burrito came with no eggs in it. Who would order a breakfast burrito with no eggs? Wasn't a huge problem though, they fixed it! Another downside was it took so long it felt like to get the food. Seemed like forever! Then it took super long again to get my order fixed. But it was pretty good when I got it. My only complaints are there was a tad too much cheese and I would have preferred a slightly crispier tortilla. Otherwise it was yummy! Tasted fresh. Also they gave me a free zucchini bread muffin thing. I didn't like it personally, but it was free so I can't complain!"}
{"text":"I am so glad I found this place!  I have yet to eat here which is sad because their food looks amazing but they have the best prices on hemp products including online!  The staff is really awesome and knowledgeable if you need anything. The joint rub and oil works wonders!"}
{"text":"Very thematic restaurant. I like it! Ordered two smoothies. They were incredibly tasty, and the staff was nice."}
{"text":"It was the grand opening - first day - meaning that all businesses should be given a huge pass for most things and a big handshake just for having made it to this point.  I'll share our experience with you, and you can imagine it may be different when you check them out.  I was thrilled to have a new restaurant claiming \"healthy\" and vegetarian options right in our neighborhood.  We went around 1pm for lunch.  One of the two chocolate chip and hemp cookies was really tasty that we tried bites of while our meals arrived - they have a case of sweets that are either made there or by the local Polish bakery, I overheard said.  We splurged and ordered three dishes (each about $10), including their \"special of the day,\" the blueberry hemp waffle.  It was well-cooked, but otherwise not detectably different from a regular blueberry waffle.  Typical Country Time type syrup accompanied it and a cinnamon-y compound butter.  The breakfast burrito came next; the order was to have eggs, vegetarian chorizo, gouda, tomatoes, avocados, and onions, with salsa.  No chorizo (sadly), no flavor to the eggs (which may have been relying on the chorizo accompaniment), one tiny sliver of brown avocado at the bottom, and a cold spinach tortilla wrapped around it.  Salsa was reminiscent of frozen tomatoes blended up with some dried parsley.  Then, we got the veggie burger.  We asked if it was house-made and were told it was, and you could add whatever fixin's on top, including choice of bun - sounded great!  It came on a white bun similar to an Aunt Hatty's or whatever, with a sprinkling of shredded iceberg, tomato slices, red onions in a ramekin on the side (huh?), scant avocado, and a very-clearly-packaged patty (it was fine - pretty sure I've had that one from Costco - but not particularly delicious, and not cooked for any texture on the outsides).  My husband's a big fan of sweet potato chips; the ones on the side of the burrito and burger were what he called \"bottom of the bag\" = a pile of crumbs with a little handful of those veggie straw things on top.  My husband - not unaccustomed to the indulgent all-American meal which you'd think would elicit a response like this one - said his stomach felt kind of terrible a little while after the lunch.  Nothing was spoiled, of course, but we were not left with a light healthful feeling, at the very least, afterwards.  (Note that we did not finish the haul we ordered, as readers might reasonably expect it was the quantity we consumed....)  We ordered five things, thinking we were getting a good sample of our friendly new neighborhood joint's vittles; perhaps their caf√©'s specialty or comfort zone is in the drinks - they have an array of great-sounding juices and smoothies.  I wish them good luck, either way."}
{"text":"A couple of co-workers and I decided to make the long trip up to Hempful Farms Cafe, and it was quite delightful. We all work at a medical marijuana dispensary, and we were interested in the concept of a hemp based, cbd enriched restaurant. As an epileptic prop 203 patient myself, I know the benefits of a CBD rich diet and was happy to see so many options of hemp based products. We got a combo of both breakfast and lunch, along with a juice and a smoothie. Personally, my choice (veggie gluten free wrap and a day lift juice) was tasty and fresh, but my wrap literally fell apart and lost the purpose of being a wrap. Not a huge deal. my veggies were seasoned lightly and my juice was very fresh and the flavor was balanced nicely. Everything was priced fairly cheaply, and the hemp shop was a nice little addition. I also got one a few of the CBD oil honey droppers and enjoyed them alot, especially since they were only a five bucks piece. I also brought a cinnamon roll and a chocolate hemp milk to go, so I could take back to my boyfriend. He loved the cinnamon roll and the milk to wash it down! I highly recommend this place to all of my prop 203 patients and anyone interested in learning more about Hemp! I just wish it was located closer to me! Open a locale in Old Town, and I will be there almost daily!"}
