{"text":"Wanted to try this opening day, but didn't want to wait 90+ minutes. Finally tried a pie for dinner with family the next day and was glad I didn't queue up. For the price, the pies are small, poorly constructed, and light on toppings. I got a single, tasty bite with all the topping flavors represented.   The food wasn't bad, but there are plenty of direct competitors nearby that do everything better."}
{"text":"This was our first time trying Your Pie, and we had a great experience. Hands down better then Pie5 and Mod. I ordered the Nat, and my wife got the Lineage - both on wheat crusts. Great flavor. The crust was perfect - not too thick/doughy and also not overly thin like a flat bread. The toppings were evenly spread, and the pizza wasn't too greasy. My wife had a brownie and said it was great. The gelato and beer/wine were a nice touch, too.I like that they bring the food to your table unlike some of the other fast casual pizza places that make you wait at the register. The restaurant was well decorated and lots of parking. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Your Pie is AWESOME!  The pizza is amazing, and it's the only place I can find in the area that allows you to make your chopped salad with all of their ingredients.  The ambiance is also really nice compared with the other build your own pizza places. On Thursdays they have $3.14 craft beer too which is a great deal. I definitely recommend checking it out!"}
{"text":"Best thin crust pizza in town. Ambience is great in the evening. Nice family setting with some local Gelato. You can call in, order online, take it to go, or dine in. They don't offer just pizza there are paninis and salad also for the people who want to avoid pizza I guess. My favorite topping has to be the mushrooms they baks on site and the ham has to come second. The handmade sauce is better than Fire'd Pies marinara sauce, 100 times better than salty Eklectic Pies. I'd recommend anyone to come in at least once, if you're reading this now go get \"Your Pie.\""}
{"text":"I tried this place today hoping the previous reviews were wrong. Unfortunately they were right. Pros-cost, speed, taste of sauce. Cons, the pizzas are very small, not enough for dinner for some people. They barely give you any toppings. They sprinkle 4-5 pieces of each topping on the pizza, leaving entire portions of it completely bare. They stick a table tent with a number on it directly into your pizza (hopefully someone washes these...?) and then into the oven. Once we got our pizzas they were so wet and mushy in the center that you couldn't pick up a slice without it collapsing and the 1-2 pieces of toppings they rationed you falling off. I ended up rolling mine up like a tortilla to eat it. If there had been a normal amount of toppings and a crispy crust the overall taste wouldn't have been too bad. Unfortunately I won't be back to try it again."}
{"text":"My second pie. Delicious as the first. Ordered this one online with my credit card. 15 min. to pick up. Excellent, quick, easy. My only comment, no napkins offered and none out to take. 8.63$ for 11\" of yum, unlimited toppings. Shared with a coworker. Cheap lunch. I will be back"}
{"text":"I was a big fan of yourpie when I lived in Athens and excited to see they opened one here. The Charlotte store is extra nice inside, and the food is just as good as I remembered. Really fresh ingredients, good service, clean and laid out well. The texture and taste of their wheat crust is great - chewy, crisp bottom, holds up well to lots of toppings. Highly recommend adding it to your pizza rotation."}
{"text":"Great tasting that you can watch be made before your eyes. It's made in a wood fired oven which is the way pizza should be made (in my opinion)!!  Plenty of options for ingredients and the staff is helpful!"}
{"text":"5 star rating should be reserved for only the Best of the Best. Your Pie is Amazing. Remember on Seinfeld when Kramer wanted to open a build your own pie shop...well at Your Pie they have the hands on but it's totally your build. You pick the bread, sauce, cheese toppings...etc. We even asked for our Pies to be Crispy. Not just good pizza, this is delicious Pizza.  But that's not all. The staff is friendly, patient, helpful and even playful and funny. The restaurant is inviting, clean and spacious. Seriously, you gotta try this shop."}
{"text":"The best pizza by far!!!!!!!!!!! Just had it for the first time today, we ordered from foodsby...I most defiantly will be ordering one for my family!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"For real just got done eating our pizza and i knew something tasted wrong on my pizza so i had my friend try it and she even said it tasted funny so we figured out that i put parm on my pizza and she didnt so she picked up the cheese only to find mold . So we went to every table and looked every table had moldy parm cheese. I will never eat here again !!!"}
{"text":"Yay! Two words animal lovers: vegan option. Grilled pizza is always a plus. The toppings are fresh and flavorful. Getting what I wanted without compromise is outstanding. I only deduct points because there is one vegan cheese and it's just adequate. If there was at least one mock meat option, that would be insanely cool. Also, the seating is uncomfortable and sparse Which makes it difficult to be here and have a relaxing meal especially when it's busy. If you want people to stay and don't want them to feel rushed to leave for get it to go, then get some more comfortable hightops and space away from the food line."}
{"text":"Pizza and toppings were delicious! Fresh toppings, staff was great and they have locally made gelato too."}
{"text":"Ordered from here for company luncheon. Flavor was there but customer service was not pleasant. Most build your pizzas were wrong. Out of nearly all sodas and toppings. Maybe dine in would be fine but bad take out."}
{"text":"I was there on the day they gave out free pizzas. It was such long wait but worthed it. They are so neat. Nice staff, very tasty pizzas, and clean. Definately will come back!"}
{"text":"Cool joint. The pizza is reasonable. If you make your own, there is unlimited toppings to choose from(no extra charge).  It is personal pizzas from what I see.  It is clean, very good place for kids. They have drawing crayons and television for kids.  A lot of soda to choose from.  There is even a little bar place for the adults."}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots to grab an amazing pie pizza!   I absolutely love that they have different (fresh dough) to choose from. My favorite is the wheat! I've tried the gluten free and white flour and love all of them!   There are numerous of toppings to choose from! My go to is fresh mozzarella, marinara sauce, tons of veggies (especially banana peppers) with some basil and Parmesan on top!   The price is affordable and I love that you can get gelato and beer there!   I've tried Blaze Pizza, and this place is 10x better in my view. The flavors are more rich and it tastes more hearty.   Definitely a go to place for me! You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Great pies, great price! My only beef is that I found a piece of plastic in my pizza... :("}
{"text":"Perfect neighborhood pizza place! It's located right on South Blvd tucked towards the back of a smaller office building, next to Jimmy Johns.   Talk about options! There are so many different toppings to put on your pizza. Before I get ahead of myself though, they also have different types of dough, sauces, and cheeses. It's fun to customize new pizzas every time you go in.   They also have heavenly gelato and a great selection of local beers on tap.   Check their website and social media pages for specials! Some nights kids eat free, other nights they have $3 discounts on pizzas, etc! Always something good going on."}
{"text":"Ordered 2 10\" pizzas yesterday and was happy with the easy online ordering, a quick pickup time, no extra charges for the toppings and they have Vegan options. It seems they use a generous amount of toppings too which is great. The reason my bf and I ordered here was because of the vegan options. He picked up with no hassle. The only reason it's not 5 stars is I wish they had a larger size option and a thick/regular crust option. They are decent pricing but could definitely use another portion size or two. We'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"My family was very eager to have a new restaurant in the neighborhood and waited a week or so after opening to avoid the crowds. Unfortunately, we were rather disappointed.   We were welcomed and given a 5 second overview by what I'd assume to be the manager/owner as we walked in. He was helpful since we were confused by the lack of menu on the wall, though there are apparently paper menus laying around. We felt rushed to order though no one was behind us. My husband needed vegan cheese on his and they proceeded to put FAR too much, to the point of needing to take almost all of it off to enjoy his meal. The young lady making my pizza kept putting ALL of my ingredients in the center of the pizza. I continuously had to ask for her to spread it out. When I asked for jalape√±os, she literally put 3-4 tiny pieces in the very center of my pizza. They only have booster seats, which is super inconvenient if you have a baby. This of course wasn't sufficient for my 15 month old baby.   All of this said, when we checked out they did accept a coupon that wasn't for their location (we didn't realize going in), which was a nice gesture. Though the girl needed assistance making my pizza, it did taste great. My kids loved the plain cheese pizza and as I mentioned, my husband wasn't a fan of his. We aren't in a rush to go back anytime soon."}
{"text":"The quality of the ingredients were Amazing- so fresh. I do love how they have the wood burning oven and they do it in front of you. Also you can have as many toppings as you want with no extra charge!   I will say though that my stomach couldn't handle everything but that may have been just me"}
{"text":"Really wonderful Customer Service!!!   They have outside and inside seating. It's kind of similar to the set up of Moe's. You pick your dough for the pizza and then unlimited toppings. It's pretty neat for one low price.   ¬∑I had a light red sauce with cheese sprinkled over top and half with buffalo cheese on top. I liked it, but the sauce wasn't my favorite.   ¬∑Rose Wine in the can- Neat concept, just didn't taste that great!  I'd come again to try some other variations."}
{"text":"The pizza is good, you get to choose from a 3 sauces, about 4 or 5 different cheeses and tons of toppings. Good quality food and ingredients, but the biggest complaint is the price. But the taste is better than most chain pizza joints. If you like thin, New York style pizza, this is your place."}
{"text":"My friends wanted to try Your Pie, and being gluten free, I was nervous that I would just have to eat salad for dinner.  I love pizza, but not always easy to find GF.  I was so happy to see Your Pie was able to cater to my needs!    The topping options are awesome!  There are sooo many ingredients to choose from, and I like that I don't even have to  include cheese or tomato sauce (stupid allergies!) on my pizza.  It's pretty nice that there are different options for sauces.  Different, too.  I loved my pizza.  I covered it in so many toppings, didn't even notice there was no cheese or tomato sauce.  Soooo Yum!    Staff is super friendly, nice atmosphere, good place for groups, families.  Would def come back.   ;"}
{"text":"First visit here was a few months back for a special night when they were supporting a local charity (SHRED). Walk in, tell them how you want your pizza and they make it in front of you. I couldn't be happier with how the pizza turned out. Crispy-on-the-outside-soft-on-the-inside crust, great sauce (so important to a good pizza) and the fresh mozzarella and toppings were great too. Will definitely be visiting again."}
{"text":"Greeted at the door with excellent customer service.  Food was prepared very quickly. Great value for the quality of food."}
{"text":"I live down the road from Your Pie and have passed it every day as it was being built and was excited for a new dining option in the neighborhood.  I went the day after they opened and am so disappointed on many fronts.  It seems like the place is suffering from an identity crisis which is surprising for a restaurant with so many locations nationwide.  Is it a bar?  Is it a fast casual concept?  Is it a take out place?  One thing it's certainly not is family friendly.  I went with a friend and our two toddlers and not only were there no tables to accommodate a party of 4 on a slow Saturday afternoon (there's maybe 5 four tops in the whole place) there are zero high chairs. Which of course you don't find out until you've ordered food, have no place to put it, have squirly, hungry toddlers losing their patience, etc.  I know it was only day two of operations but the employees seemed poorly trained and overwhelmed.  The only option listed for a kids meal is a combo for $6.50 which includes a drink and gelato, neither of which I give to my 2 year old, one employee told me yes I could just buy a small pizza, one told me no, and the manager that was asked was incredibly short and responded \"that's just how we do it here\". Welp, the way \"you do it\" isn't worth my time or money so I will continue driving out of the neighborhood to one of the other fast casual pizza restaurants that has much better food puts their customers first."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good! I got the nan pizza which was delicious, a small side caprese salad which was only $2.99 (not bad for all the mozzarella and tomatoes that came with it) and the IPA they have on tap. They have a small draft selection but great beers! I guess quality over quantity. The pizza was smaller than I expected but perfect for one person, Or two if you get salads as well. Overall the place is very clean and well put together. They're brand new so give them some time to work out all the kinks! They don't offer wifi YET but until they do you can connect to the wifi from the Starbucks next door. I'll totally be coming back. #supportlocalbusinesses #golocal"}
{"text":"This is definitely my favorite pizza restaurant in town. My family and I decided to come in and try it one day since we pass it almost everyday. The employees were so helpful and so polite! The food came out fast and the employee even offered sauce to dip our pizza in. They had pizza, paninis and salads, the best part was they were all unlimited toppings! I would definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Quick service, crispy crust, and plenty of parking on a Saturday night!  Your Pie is like a Chipotle for pizza.  Patrons get to select from a wide variety of toppings."}
{"text":"First time here, was delicious an made just for my taste buds. Veru cute an inviting set up along with respectable staff."}
{"text":"I'm into you Your Pie. Some of the many things I love, if you only have a little bit of time, this is totally the place. You can have real food, for a reasonable price and be out the door in less than 40 minutes. Plenty of parking, everyone is super nice and my pizza was flat out delicious. Rock on with your bad self. #noyoureapie"}
{"text":"Pretty sure they are closed...... We went here before and was awesome, but have showed up 3 or 4 times now to locked doors"}
{"text":"I go to school right next to this place and LOVE IT! The service is friendly and the prices are good. I love getting their salads, big enough to split with another person. The pizza is great...cant go wrong when yo build your own. The best part is the GELATO!!! I have tried multiple flavors and all were delicious. (favorite is the tequila lime) Again, the prices are good, especially for gelato."}
{"text":"I am thrilled to give 5 stars and quite honestly I'd give more if possible. Casual,build your own pizza,all toppings possible totally unlimited, 5 or 6 different sauces. Build your own 10 pie, gluten free,white or wheat. I had white and normally I'll eat crust but it's just crust. I've never had a better crust. I honestly wanted to keep eating after full just for the flavor. Have a few beers,soda. Tv screens,kids coloring. Gelato to finish with. I'll go back again and again. My new favorite pizza place. Hands down!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in to try out the place while visiting in the area. Great concept. YOU can BUILD YOUR OWN PIZZA down the line, or pick a menu item. BBQ pizza is the best. Beer and Gelato along with the pizza makes this place a win."}
{"text":"I was able to give Your Pie a try before their grand opening, at a charity event for Ace and TJ's Grin Kids. I expected the service and food to still need some perfecting since they weren't even truly open yet, but to my surprise everything was on point. I built my own pie with marinara and a few toppings. The sauce was tasty, crust crisp and chewy in a good way, toppings portioned and spread correctly. I have been to the competitors (Blaze, Project Pie, Uncle Maddio's) but like Your Pie the best. Gelato was good too!"}
{"text":"Great new spot. Perfect size for one person, made to order and customizable, and tastes great."}
{"text":"The pizza is fabulous and I love the panini! Everything is customizable so it's exactly how you like it!"}
{"text":"Went twice the first week they opened. Staff was very friendly and the pizza was great.  I got the Nat twice and added garlic, parmesan and basil. It was delicious. We will certainly be back!"}
{"text":"I went for the grande opening and enjoyed a nice pizza for 3.14 and also had a brew to pair with it. Since they had the amazing deal, there was of course a wait but that was expected.  They do allow you to make your own pizza(including choosing your bread), but I decided to order one of their preset pizzas to get a good ida of the restaurant. I got the southern heat that had buffalo sauce as the base and included red onions, chicken, onion , and green pepper. I like to have a kick to my food, so this was the perfect match for me.   They also have a few flavors of gelato which is closer to the cashier, and I had a sample and I must admit it was rather satisfying.  They might not offer this deal again, but I would have been content paying the regular price since it was so good."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite neighborhood pizza place.  The GM talks to us every time we come in, and the staff is super friendly and helpful.  The ingredients are fresh and tasty, and the pizza is ready really fast.   I always get \"The Nat\" with the wheat crust and the pesto base and my fianc√© builds his own every time."}
{"text":"It's official, I have a \"Go-to\" Pizza at Your Pie: Wheat Dough, traditional marinara, fresh mozzarella, mushroom, sun-dried tomatoes, with meatballs and salami. Make that extra on the marinara. I don't know why it's so difficult for most restaurants to season marinara properly, but these guys have it figured out.  To be able to go here time and time again knowing you're going to get a consistent pie with outstanding quality, what a gem! Those sun-dried tomatoes for example, perfect pungency, bright flavor, I'd take a pie with these as the sole topping.  Now that I've tried a few, the gelato debate is over: Butter Pecan, NO contest. Gelato is not rocket science, if it's grainy then the restaurant probably didn't keep the temperature stable before serving. Not to worry at Your Pie, the subtle textures of the gelato is always perfect and such a treat after lunch, dinner, or whatever!  The crew here is remarkable as well. The staff here bust their butts to provide an exceptional experience every visit. Tonight they showed their generosity by hosting SHRED (Skaters Helping Realize Extraordinary Dreams) and donated a portion of the day's sales to the charity. I really appreciate the impact that one small business is making to our community, setting the bar for everyone else.  So yeah, custom pizza? Not only can I dig it, I can wholeheartedly say that Charlotte needs places like this. For the food, the people, and the difference they make. Thanks guys, mean it!"}
{"text":"My husband and I tried Your Pie the other night and we were impressed. We got the chicken ranch bacon panini and a BYO pizza.   The panini was LOADED with toppings and was very delicious. The bread was cooked perfectly and the amount of chicken they loaded in it was outrageous. Definitely worth $8.   For the pizza was got regular crust, basil pesto sauce, mozzarella, dollops of ricotta, artichokes, mushrooms, garlic, Italian meatballs with a balsamic drizzle. The pizza was really good and the balsamic drizzle complimented the pizza well. They didn't have any crazy toppings to pick from, but they do have a monthly featured pizza- this months was a baked potato pizza. Looked good- a lot of carbs!   Overall, Your Pie is in par with the other pizza BYO competitors in the area. They also have a nice bar and gelato, which bumps up this review. Plus the staff was extremely friendly."}
{"text":"This is the 4th \"build your own\" pizza place I've visited in the past few months. These are becoming a giant trend lately. YOUR PIE is the one I like the best.  I stopped a little after 2pm.....my pizza and drink came to $7.55 Four peaks beer on tap........big plus for local beer. Gelato for dessert.  TV and crayons for the kids  Since my last review I will remove a star since the owner messaged me an cried I only gave him 3 stars........wanna keep going?"}
{"text":"What are the try it out but was disappointed inside signage  bad,  employees feel like they want to be anywhere but at work and are not really well-trained not a good value for the price."}
{"text":"We went to Your Pie this evening on their first day of a \"soft opening.\" The customer service is quick and on point and they made it a priority to get things right even while they are learning. It's a bright and welcoming dining room (a little on the small side). There is a small bar area for beer and wine (approx 5 chairs) with two TVs. Lots of topping, crust, and sauce options to choose from. They have my vegan cheese... yay! I got the wheat crust but liked what my husband's white crust looked and tasted like better. Parking is easy which is a definite plus. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The Nat and I met in Charleston, SC years ago. I dreamed of one here in CLT since I moved here 5 years ago and then I heard they were opening one..imagine that :) It's a weekly ritual for me to indulge on Pie here. You canNOT compare the freshness. A solid choice."}
{"text":"I have been waiting for this place to open since April. I have to say it was worth the wait! The food was GREAT! Friendly staff! Nice spot over all. They have beer and can wine. I love how you can make your own pizza. It's like Subway you see them make your food and you tell them everything you want on the pizza. And they also sale side salad and gelato"}
{"text":"This is the best pizza I have eaten in Charlotte.  The place also has a small bar with local beers and a couple of TVs with volume.  The staff was friendly and the food was custom made and fresh.  I will definitely be back and will bring the family next time."}
{"text":"Maybe I just got lucky but the thin crust was perfect, the best one I've had in years, tons better than at the now defunct Pie Five for example. The toppings are as good as you can expect for the price :$8 for  a 10\" with everything you may want on it. Please, pretty please open a store in Matthews."}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE!!!! Being from NY I love NY styled pizza, but this place makes me feel other ways. This is more of a personal pizza with a California pizza style. You pick how you want to make your pizza, or follow some of their homemade ones! All wood fired. A super trendy fun place. They also do serve beer! They have a nice gelato choice too. Their pizza, drink and side special is great! I highly suggest trying this place, one of my favorites!"}
{"text":"This place is an all around must go, much needed place in the area. The wood fired pizza is delicious and each pizza has its own name that you feel speaks to you and your desires. How cool was that idea!!! It is very filling and the price is just right. There's also a cute little bar and couch there as well. Can't wait to get back"}
{"text":"This is the first Your Pie location in the Valley (their headquarters is in Athens, GA). They are speedy, friendly, and causal! When we arrived there was hardly a line so we took our sweet time before stepping right up to the counter to order our build-your-own-pizza. The customizable ingredients (40+ toppings) are fresh and our pizzas came out of the brick oven to the table fast!   I got a modified version of The Nat (basil pesto, mozzarella, feta, sun-dried tomatoes, spinach, chicken) and my friend ordered a modified version of BBQ Chicken (BBQ sauce, mozzarella, chicken, cilantro, red onions). We were both happy with our selections. The pizzas were full of flavor and cooked thoroughly, but not overly crispy. The hospitable employees even ask if we would like any sauces to dip our crust and gave us a gracious amount for dipping. THX!!  Other items being served up are chopped salads, paninis, and craft beers (looks like 6 taps at this location - including local favorite - Four Peaks). The whole group can eat here no matter what their dietary needs might be because they have gluten-free dough and vegan cheese.   My only really qualm is that the west side of the building needs blinds or something for the afternoon. It was just too bright! We almost wore sunglasses inside and that kind of ruins the experience a little but...  They have a small case of GELATO!!  And that fixes all. The employee that gave me my scoop of delicious White Chocolate Strawberry informed me that Your Pie is big on locally sourced food/ingredients. This location serves Lombardo's gelato, a local company and flavors will vary based on what is available. Pretty cool stuff (Pun intended)!"}
{"text":"It's very food. Service was great and everything was amazing. Eat there now people. Because it's just that gooooooood."}
{"text":"I called in an order for pick up (6 pizzas all together). The gentleman on the phone was very polite and friendly. He even called back my order to ensure it came out correctly.  When I got to the shop I was not sure if I should stand in line or go ahead to the register...  anyways, I paid and he took great care of me! The pizzas are definitely fresh and tasted pretty good. Only complaint is some of them were over cooked (black edges) and the one pizza we asked for marinara on it (it did not come with any) barely came with any.  I also got a scoop of creme br√ªl√©e gelato. It was so yummy!!!  Overall, my pizza was definitely delicious. And the employee that helped me was nice, polite, and funny.  This was a bit far from my work for a lunch break, but I will definitely be back for dinner."}
{"text":"I love that you can build and see them make the pizza. Its good pizza.  I tried there ice cream. Which was also good bit i was very disappointed in the small size of the scope."}
{"text":"Create casual spot for pizza and salad. Ingredients were fresh, delicious and restaurant was clean. Kiddos enjoyed it as well, thumbs up on  his one!"}
{"text":"Great pizza. Loved the gelato.   The staff is still learning, but they're incredibly nice and attentive during the process.   We'll be back!"}
{"text":"I have been here a few times and let me tell you it had been amazing every single time! The pizza is delicious and cooked perfectly. They also have a great selection of gelatos as well. I would defiantly recommend this to anyone that lives great handmade pizza!"}
{"text":"Yep...... this place is consistant. I came in again and the PIZZAS are freshly made. The manager told me about a Butternut squash pizza,...... not sure about that, but if its as good as all the others it will be worth a try. Thank you to Wes and his team for putting quality first, I really appreciate it.  Oh I just saw they now have Kids eat Free nights on Wednesday.... So worth it"}
{"text":"I loved my first visit to Your Pie, 3/14 of all days ( Pi Day). Pi Day is the day where you can get a pizza from participating restaurants for $3.14. Your Pie was so good though, I'd be willing to pay full price again.  My pepperoni, marinara, mozzarella, green pepper was delicious, hot and fresh. Not over or undercooked either .   They have plenty of options for a create your own options and a few pre-made suggestions. White, whole wheat and gluten free crusts and various sauces .   The dining room is very spacious. It includes table, bar, and counter options and is decorated in an industrial style.  The service is very friendly, lively, and I could tell they wanted to make sure your order was right. I had no issues with my order and the wait time was fine ( for Pi  Day)."}
{"text":"First time here, looking for a place to eat around 8:30 pm on a Saturday night. Didn't what to expect, it's a pizza place. You get your own 10\" personal pizza, and you build it yourself. Check out the pics on the pizza we built, good stuff!"}
{"text":"Great place to have a great pizza with friends. Many different kind of pizza or your can custom make your own."}
{"text":"Best pizza in charlotte in terms of personal pies I use to think blaze was the best but this is much better and fresher ! I got the pizza with marinara and pesto basil - lots of veggies and it was really good . The gelato is surprisingly tasty too .. and the brownie too!!"}
{"text":"We were in the area and decided to give this place a try. Must have been an off night because the pizzas were taking forever to come out and the gentleman behind who ordered to go was missing a pizza. I noticed they did their best to avoid this poor guy and didn't compensate him for the error nor offer any apology. Our pizza arrived and the crust was so thin that I felt I was eating cardboard. We tried the chicken and waffle pizza which was actually a nice combination and had flavor but would have been better on a thicker crust. The cheese bread was better than the pizza! With so many pizza places to choose from, you have one opportunity to make a good impression and sadly it wasn't a good one."}
{"text":"If you like to make your own salad this is a pretty good place to do it. And my boyfriend really likes the pizza. My only complaint is that not all the employees seem to know how to properly make a bread bowl salad. So I end up having to wait for them to read up on how to do it. Probably need to be doing a little more employee training. But overall a nice place and I like it better than Blaze Pizza."}
{"text":"Ok thanks to IG I've found yet another gem! At your pie on South Blvd creates custom 10\" pies and for Pi Day they were offer pies ALL DAY {lunch and dinner} for $3.14!!! How can you say no and be annoyed about standing in the expected lines? I waited patiently with a smile on my face and ingredients that I wanted to add on my pizza in my head.  They have great parking options in front of the restaurant and a parking garage. I loved the P I Z Z A led sign what greeted me when I walked in the door. They had great wood and metal table and chair decor. And of course representing Charlotte's MANY craft beers on tap, bottle and by the can.   I waited in line for about 15-20 minutes and then other 10 minutes to allow my pizza to cook. For this to be National Pi Day and EVERYONE was wanted pizza, I have to give it to the workers at You Pie... they CRUSHED IT! They kept the lines moving, they had smiles on their faces and the were even laughing and joking with us. No one was frustrated air had a irritable look on their face. I even heard the guy making my pizza say, \"I wish it was this busy all the time, because honestly I'm having fun!\" Wow! We're do you hear that now days, hardly no where! Even the cashier guy hurt his finger while assisting me and he wanted to SCREAM but he held it together, gathered his bearings and finished assisting me.  Kudos to you Your Pie and the amazing trading and preparation you all did for this day! I will say when I checked in it offered a free gelato but I forgot to use it. Can I redeem that coupon on a different day? I was too busy taking in the atmosphere and taking pictures  #yelperproblems"}
{"text":"Great fresh ingredients for pizza. Local beer. Happy friendly service.  Parking deck in back."}
{"text":"very good.had the nat.pre-opening staff very accommodating.speedy, well organized.wish bottom crust was little more crispy.tasty pie! mgt very interested in our comments excellent value.will be back. Welcome to the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Well. Pretty disappointed. I hate to give a bad review and hopefully it's just the opening jitters, but this place did not meet expectations. Upon arrival I was not greeted. Walked to the line, and instead of a \"hello\" got a \"what kind of pizza are you doing\". All of the employees were void of emotions and I am not sure whether they are still in training and are nervous or what? After an awkward robotic encounter with the cashier I went to my table and soon my pizza arrived. It came in a timely manner (I'll give em that) however it was the greasiest, floppiest, wettest pizza I have ever had. As soon as I picked up a slice, all the toppings and cheese fell of. I mean all of it. For such a small and terrible pizza and drink I paid about 10.67 which is way overpriced. I would rather eat at Pieology than here anyday.  LONG STORY SHORT: lifeless employess, greasy wet overpriced pizza, unhappy visit"}
{"text":"Have ordered online a couple of times and both times the orders have been incorrect. The quality of food was pretty good but need to ensure the ingredients used when placing online orders is accurate."}
{"text":"Great fresh food with friendly and helpful staff. I like this place as he concept is similar to blaze but the crust is different and has a texture I prefer.  They also have gelato with a yelp check in which is pretty great for the price.   Only downside is it is harder to find from the metro."}
{"text":"Had a great experience here when I was craving pizza and wanted something quick! Super quick service and you can make your own exactly how you want it.  It's personal size btw. I got the wheat crust with red sauce, spinach, artichokes, and mushrooms, with a pinch of garlic.  Full bar and lots of good local beers on tap and a cool couch area in the back for lounging. No one else was really there or hanging around, but maybe if it was busier it would be nice to chill. Maybe over a lunch break?"}
{"text":"First time here. Wanted to compare to mod and the other fast make your own places. First impression of the selection is disappointment in lack of white onions. Seems to be common at these places. We went with the cheese sticks and bbq chicken pizza. Cheese sticks were okay, wouldn't order again. Lacking flavor. The pizza was spot on. The crust is perfect and the sauce amazing. We added bacon and were thoroughly pleased. A bit pricey at 8 bucks for a small pizza but we were pleased. I would come back."}
{"text":"Know what they didn't tell you about You Pie? - You can either build your own pizza, salad or Panini, or order one of the signature ones.  -- Every Tuesday, you can save $3 when you pay with \"your pie\" app. -- Every Wednesday, you can get one free kids meal when you purchase an adult entree & combo. Kids meal includes kids pizza, kid's gelato and drinks (12 years and under) and in-store only. -- Every Thursday, get Cheese stix for $3.14 and Craft beer for $3.14. -- Their Italian Gelato is 93% fat-free, and the sorbet is 100% fat-free and dairy-free.  My friend and I ordered some cheese stix and couple of pizzas. I built my own pizza, and she had the roasted butternut Squash pizza. We loved both of our pizzas, as well as the selection of Gelato we've tried.  Four and Half Yelps."}
{"text":"The food was great and I felt incredibly welcomed into this environment. They made me feel very comfortable and were quick with service. I would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Ya know how like, every time you eat a pizza you wish you could hand select the toppings to customize your own pizza, but you don't want to end up spending 19 additional dollars because of all the toppings? Yeah, happens to me all the time. This place makes those dreams come true.   $7.99 for a delicious pizza on wheat or white thin crust, and any/all toppings in any fashion you want them. Want marinara and pesto, go for it! Want mozzarella and feta cheese, they're all yours! You can use your own creativity to construct a pizza masterpiece here. Get to it!"}
{"text":"They were kind pokey last night. One guy was prepping while the manager was chatting it up (football) with another patron after he paid & the place echoes so we could barely hear ourselves. Why 5?   First, I like custom pizza places.  Tantamount to that I LOVE LOVE they offer daily deals. Specials and an app offering. Plus a yelp check in.   2nd, more than pizza and basic salads. They have Gelato and a full bar. I don't drink bit can appreciate the vibe aND the offerings.   Crust options except thick. With that, the red sauce can be more flavorful but I got it on the side so maybe it's better with the actual toppings and cooked. I had a pesto base. The sun dried tomatoes aren't the cheapos. They're good.   The parking is plentiful. Help us all, it's on dreadful south Blvd which means just park, make a day of it and walk everywhere or catch that light rail.   Next door to Cannon and autoBell car wash. Just go."}
{"text":"When the person making your food is annoyed by your order of 3 veggie pizzas...and then tells you she doesn't even know what a Vegan is...at a restaurant with Vegan options listed on their menu. I feel like this is a flaw in training and super terrible customer service to mock your customers for their dietary choices."}
{"text":"Skip Pappa Johns, Dominos,Pizza Hut, and just go with these guys. Great service and they always deliver great pizza."}
{"text":"Update: unfortunately, Wes is no longer at the location.  You can really see the difference in quality. Toppings are just laid on top, they're not shredded like before to allow flavor to come through. Sauce isn't spread out far enough, the heath score went from A To B 86%.. read the heath violations - not cleaning hands, items stored longer than 5 days, no date.. sanitizer not being used to wipe down tables.  Really too bad, I liked this place a lot."}
{"text":"Great little pizza place in town with really fresh ingredients! I know they just opened so they have the usual kinks to work out, but I'd give the service 3. We were one of only two tables and there were 7-8 employees all behind the counter and nobody was willingly going out of their way to serve us. It basically seemed like oh I guess so and so can help. Will come back though!"}
{"text":"Definitely a fan of this new guy in SouthEnd!  You can easily miss it if you are driving too fast down South Blvd, but the loud neon lights of JimmyJohns next door can seem to overshadow this place.  Look for the \"YOU WANNA PIZZA ME?\" neon lights, and you are in the right spot!  As with all the \"build your own\" places you are shuffled through the line with a plethora of options, but it seems like staff here have a lot of fun and really put a lot of love in each and every pie.  I know some, cough cough, competitors just send you though an assembly line, but here it feels like a different experience (maybe similar) but I feel like the people genuinely care if you are 1) happy with your pizza and 2) you are experiencing this place to the fullest.    The dining area is gorgeous... white subway tile and warm wood tables and booths.  The bar with (8?) tap handles is right around the corner with a TV for sports.  There is also gelato here (that I haven't tried yet)... I know, SHAME on me.  I'm a fan of the \"craft series\" pizzas... so in the fall they had a butternut squash pizza that was delicious and recently was a bacon & date pizza which was very tasty.  Staff is super friendly and I will be coming back for more and more pies... maybe the occasional salad... oh who am I kidding... if you see me with a salad, there may be something wrong. ;)  Thursdays night's special:  cheese bread and $3 pints!  Win-Win!"}
{"text":"My first visit at Your Pie was awesome. My whole group was commenting on how we like the look and ambiance of the whole place. We were the only ones in line at about 11:30 on a Saturday. The worker told us all about how it worked (unlimited toppings made us very happy) and even about some of their daily deals that enticed us to come back, although it's about 20 minutes away from home. The pizza was amazing and reasonably priced! They also had several local beers available which is nice to see. A great deal with good vibes - can't beat it!"}
{"text":"I came here on a Saturday afternoon and it wasn't too busy. It is clean and the pop music is on low. They made the pizza in front of you and I ordered the Nat combo on wheat with root beer and gelato (1 scoop salted caramel/1 scoop taramisu.) They have beer and wine to drink here and bar seats to sit on while drinking and eating. The lighting is good and it decorated well with easy ordering instructions. The TVs have sports on them and overall had a good atmosphere except the workers seemed kind of standoffish. I didn't like how they cleaned around me and seemed to knock stuff my way. The gelato was great though! I'm not a sweet eater, but I was impressed. The root beer was good standard fare. The pizza came out hot and smelled great and was great! I definitely recommend it, they could just work on a few kinks to make this an absolute must."}
{"text":"I mean what's not to like about build your own pizza? They have different crusts (including wheat and gluten free), sauces and topping to choose from. Or you can try one of their signature pizza combinations. All of the staff members were friendly and helpful, especially Wes the GM. Next time I am saving room for gelato!"}
{"text":"Conveyor style prep WAY TOO SLOW for a quick week day lunch! Seems still very unorganized."}
{"text":"Came in on lunch break. The decor has a young/edgy style. They have a good variety of toppings for your pizza available. I got the combo that included drink and gelato. The salted caramel was delicious. I choose the pesto sauce for my base and pesto paste around the edgy...topped with tomato slices, mozzarella, basil, and Parmesan sprinkles. The pizza was a little overdone in certain spots but the ingredients tasted fresh. I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Tasty custom pizza made to order. I had the Linage pizza  swapping out black olives for banana peppers. It was a filling meal but a saved enough room for a scoop of Butterfinger gelato!"}
{"text":"Love this place not only for its fresh ingredients; choice of gluten free dough/crust but also for the low price and location.  Enjoy a cold one at the mini bar as you are waiting on your pizza!"}
{"text":"Fresh ingredients with flavor in each bite makes this one of my favorite pizza spots in Charlotte."}
{"text":"I love the custom made personal pizzas! It tasted fresh and crisp. I tried the extra virgin olive oil for my sauce and it was delicious. They also offer a variety of desserts and a little gelato display."}
{"text":"Great Pizza at a phenomenal price. Courteous service made the difference. The choice is plentiful and you couldn't ask for a fresher pizza."}
{"text":"Order it how you like it. Lots of ingredients and choice with sauces. Oven baked. Now of course I wanted vegan cheese and they were out. Not to worry one of the worker heard the convo and offered me a cup of free gelato. Want a change of pace from the regular pizza route stop in and give them a try. The only reason for the 4.5 star is no vegan cheese. Stuff happens.   Although they were short staffed everyone was professional and attentive to all the customers.   Peace"}
{"text":"Went for opening day when they had a $3.14 deal per pizza. The line was almost out the door and the employees did a great job of getting everyone in and out efficiently. Also loved how they had a bar you could eat at and order drinks. Will definitely go back again!"}
{"text":"Definitely my favorite \"build your own\" pizza place! Food has always been great but what really stands out for me is the service. Everyone has always been very friendly and helpful. There are tons of restaurants to choose from and it is too easy nowadays to just go to a different spot. These guys keep me coming back. They also have whole wheat crust which is a plus for us as well. See you guys soon!"}
{"text":"I'm usually not a big fan of build-your-own pizza restaurants due to lack of actual pizza taste (excluding toppings), but this place is legit. I purposely ordered Cheese Pizza so I could taste the pizza. I guess you could call it Naked Pizza.   Anyway, it was pretty darn good! It was by far the best build-your-own pizza I have ever eaten. After finishing my first personal pie, I wanted to order another one, but I restrained myself. The gelato is good, but I wasn't as impressed by it as I was the pizza. If you want incredible gelato, go to Alino in Mooresville.   Two other big pluses for Your Pie:  1. The owner is super friendly and professional. You can tell he really cares about high quality and taking care of his customers.   2. There is a mini-bar with beers on tap. Pretty cool for a build-your-own pizza joint.   Definitely recommended."}
{"text":"Plenty of these new fast pizza places around.  This is not one of the better one.  My pizza was not cooked enough and had kind of a odd taste. People were very friendly. Hopefully this is a issue cause they just opened but for now skip it.  Also had the gelato. That was good but my portion was the size of a golf ball.  No value."}
{"text":"I'm going to just say if you haven't tried this place, run don't walk. Such a simple concept of building your own ten inch pie but it was truly amazingly good. The toppings are pretty much what ever you would want but what really set this up a notch was the dough they used to make the crust. OMG it was soooooo good. Thin crust, crunchy perfection.  Baked in a wood fired oven. So good. I would give them more stars if I could. Five is not nearly enough. Best pizza I've had in a long time."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite restaurant! Fast and fresh, awesome pizza, craft beer, great atmosphere, and super friendly staff! Not too big or too small, food for any diet, great prices, cant say enough. Love it!!!"}
{"text":"Been there twice for happy hour pizza special.  Delish, fast and great service.  Fresh ingredients.  Cold beer.  Love it. Great ambience."}
{"text":"I can see the appeal of building your own unique personal pie, but I feel the flavor of the sauce and crust is very lacking."}
{"text":"Southern Heat, Y'all! That's what's up!   Had a great lunch experience today at Your Pie. Was impressed with the food quality and the staff attention to customer's (even the manager jumping in head-long to help when the line got only about 4 deep!) Their commitment to fresh ingredients is something a lot of other places could learn from. Beyond the solid food and service, this place is insanely community minded and looks for ways to help when and where they can. I'm a fan. Will be back."}
{"text":"Be warned - this place has a \"B\" rating by the Health Department. We visited and didn't notice the sign until we had already paid.   Background: Couple in their late 20's / early 30's. Lunchtime.   We absolutely love the Your Pie brand. Their pizza is the best, and we go out of our way to find a location when we're traveling.   Unfortunately, the employees and questionable Health Department grade will result in me never going back to this particular location.   -1 star: Employee attitudes. They were playing on their phones the entire time. Going in and out of the store. Having loud conversations. Just not being pleasant in general.   -2 stars: B rating by Health Department. This results in a huge star deduction, because I would never recommend a place to my fellow Yelpers that may not be safe to eat at."}
{"text":"We built our own pizzas. They have vegan cheese and even gf crust! And after we built our pizzas with unlimited toppings, they came out of the oven in no time! Will be back for happy hour soon :) finally an affordable vegan pizza in the area with wheat crust. The staff was also really great about answering our questions and being attentive. Lots of smiles! Thanks!"}
{"text":"Stop getting personal, custom pizzas anywhere else in Charlotte. Not only does Your Pie have the best crust, ingredients, and options, but they GET service here.  Chris T. and Amber were working when I came in today, and I was blown away by their energy, pizza passion, and just overall positive vibes. It wasn't just towards me either. I watched several other customers come in, and they went above and beyond to make everyone feel welcome, explain the process, WOW, just everything!!   Come for the pizza, canned wine, local beers on draft (though they need a better selection here), and gelato. Stay for the awesome vibe, free wi-fi, and killer customer service.  Today was my second time here. The first time here was opening day, with crazy lines and the positive attitude was still there. I just wasn't expecting it to get even better on a slow Tuesday afternoon. Shout out to everything going on at Your Pie. THIS is the place to be."}
{"text":"We had been driving by this place for months as it was being built. Another build you own pizza joint. Oh, the joy of it all.  There are a couple things that set this place apart from the others and there are the things that make it the same.  So, have you been to a build your own pizza place before? Funny, 'cause isn't every pizza joint a build your own? I've never been to a pizza place where I had to order their creations. So I'm not sure why people refer to these kinds of places as build your own. Regardless, this is a fast casual pizza place. The stuff that's the same: You order at the counter, they build it, bake it and bring it to your table. So far, does it sound familiar? That's cause it is. I'm not sure how many ingredients the average pizza joint has on hand to toss on a pie. Never really asked. I think most of these fast casual pizza places have close to the same number of toppings.   I ordered the standard build your own pie, ($7.99). Nothing overly special on my pie. I started with a wheat crust, added marinara sauce, then topped that with Sausage, Roma Tomatoes, fresh Mozz and a little fresh Parmesan. When the pie was done it was very tasty. Winner winner chicken dinner.  C got the kids pizza deal ($6.49).  That means in addition to building his own pizza, he got a drink and a cup of Gelato as well. Nice. Now C, he's even more basic than me. White crust topped with Marinara and Pepperoni. His pie came out the same time mine did and pretty soon all that was left were crumbs. And not many of those.   Your Pie has other items as well; chopped salads, paninis, cheese sticks and some craft beers. Even Four Peaks. Prices are reasonable. Oh yeah, they also have a gluten-free crust and vegan cheese by request, an additional cost of $3 for the crust of course. Very accommodating.  You can make your order a combo which will add a side salad or chips, Gelato and a drink for $3.99 more. That would bring the total to just shy of $12 bones. Not a bad deal at all. Is Your Pie worth checking out? Sure it is. You should try all of the pizza places and find the one that works for you. Remember when I said there were things that set Your Pie apart? Well aside from the Gelato, which by the way was stellar, there's this whole crayon kid thing going on which is amazing for the little rug rats that some of us have to drag along because we can't leave them home alone yet but we just can't wait until we can. Not that C is into crayons anymore, 5th grade, but Your Pie is certainly set up family friendly. No kids, no family, just you wanting a good pie? Don't be scared. The seating is situated to accommodate you loners, ah sorry, single types as well.  Good Pizza. Good Prices. Gelato. Friendly staff. Clean facility. 4 Stars."}
{"text":"Delicious pizza, friendly service. This was our second time here- did not disappoint. We especially like the combo with the gelato! Yummm!"}
{"text":"I am definitely a fan of Your Pie! Over the last few years we have seen several \"create your own pizza\" places open up and I haven't been a huge fan. Well, I can now say that has changed.   First, I love the layout of this location and can not say how sweet and friendly the staff is. On my few visits so far I have had the pleasure of creating my own pizza and have been impressed every time. From the cooking of the pizza, sauce and even cheese, everything has been impressive.  They offer a variety of doughs, proteins and veggies to select from, as well as offer some menu items. Definitely check out the cheese bread!  Why not five stars, their gelato left me wishing for me. It was good, but I have had better. And, the few times I have been they did not have wine, which I believe has changed, but will definitely check that out next time I am in.  If you like to create our own Pie, definitely check out Your Pie!"}
{"text":"This was the 3rd type of build your own personal pizza place I have tried, and this one ranks last.  The pizza is o.k. and the variety of ingredients is sub-par.  That's not including ingredients they run out of.  We asked for some bacon and they said they were out and wouldn't have any until Tuesday.  So basically that tells me that the ingredients aren't that fresh if they have something as simple as bacon shipped in on a weekly basis.  The Gelato is good and the staff is friendly, but not enough to make the pizza taste better.  Highly unlikely to go back considering the countless pizza options around."}
{"text":"Slowest service in town. 5 guys working behind the counter and we have been waiting 40 minutes for 2 pizzas. Just ridiculous. Two guys just came in from outside and never washed up, just went right to work making someone else's pizzas....sure, no problem there at all....can someone call the food inspector....#gross"}
{"text":"The first time I went to this place was for a Yelp Elite event which was very fun and very well done by the owner! So this was our first \"real\" visit there.  I like that they have three crust choices GF, white, and wheat. I have always got their wheat which I enjoy. They have a lot of sauce choices anything from classic marinara to ranch or basil pesto which is what I like. Their topping and cheese choices are a bit more limited then Blaze has which is a little disappointing:(  They have a small but solid local beer selection which is nice. Do note they have salads and sandwiches and not just pizzas which is a nice addition then the other build your own pizza places around.  Their location is a bit hard to find and can sneak up on you if you are following gps so make sure to pay attention.  The reason for my three stars and not four is really the lack of more pizza toppings, but it really is more of a 3.5:)"}
{"text":"When you want a fresh made custom pizza but don't feel like cooking it yourself this is the next best thing. Lots of options and fresh ingredients. Not overly salty or greasy either. They even have sides and dessert for a one stop shop."}
{"text":"I stopped by for the grand opening and have returned 2-3x since. I love this place because the ingredients are fresh and the quality of taste is stellar. I always build a veggie pizza which is so flavorful. The best part is their ranch. It's homemade and is a great compliment to their line up. They have gluten free options as well. I haven't tried it yet, but they have gelato also. This is literally a one stop shop as they have pizza, beer, and dessert. Give them a try!"}
{"text":"Pizza may have originated in Italy but countries around the world have developed their own regional spins on the classic food. In Brazil, chefs top their pizzas with green peas, the French love fried eggs on their slices, and in China a crust made of mini-hot dogs is surprisingly popular!  Your Pie is another pizza-your-way place in Arizona.  I've been scoping this joint out for a while seeing as how they're right by my hair salon. Your Pie opened today, April 15th, and ran a $4.15 pizza special. At that price, why not stop by? Apparently I wasn't the only one thinking this because there was a HUGE line! I waited 1.5hrs total!  After quite the wait, I ordered one of their signature pies, \"Lineage.\"  Described as having marinara, mozzarella, pepperoni, Italian sausage, red onions, mushrooms, black olives, and green peppers, it had a little bit of everything. It was everything to be expected although the size of the pie seems A LOT smaller than the competitors and the toppings are pretty meager which might just be because it was busy as heck and they needed to conserve on toppings. If this is what they're charging $7.99 usually though, I'm not sure it's worth it.  Your Pie is clean, stylish, and new.  I say give it a try and try not to compare them to the competitors.  It's still a tasty pie."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to this place as an alternative to Blaze Pizza, but the pizza was just \"meh\". The crust wasn't very crisp nor was it very flavorful.  The ingredients were ok, but there weren't near as many choices as at Blaze.  The one thing they have going for them over Blaze is that their iced tea isn't rancid like at Blaze; Blaze doesn't seem to know how to keep their tea from turning into bacteria soup.  Your Pie did just open, so if they keep the tea fresh, I'll give them a few more tries to see if they improve.  I hope they do."}
{"text":"We tried Your Pie CLT for the first time tonight. It was outstanding. Honestly, the food far exceeded my expectations. The food was fresh and just really wonderful. The customer service was outstanding! Everyone we encountered was kind and helpful. The restaurant was very clean, and parking was easy. We will absolutely be back. I already know that this will be a regular pizza spot for us. I can't wait to come back with friends. We had such a pleasant experience, I could go on and on! If you like fresh pizza, you have got to try this new spot."}
