{"text":"So I got a flyer for this place like 2 months and just placed it on my fridge. Today I was wanting some pizza, so I figured why not. I ordered a large pepperoni and a dozen wings. While calling my order I requested that my order of wings be all wings with no drums. The guy that took my order had no problem with that. 20 minutes later I go to ck up my order. I take maybe two feet into the door and a large friendly looking guy says \"hey, you've got perfect timing. Your pie just came out of the oven.\" Mind you this is my first time here, ever. I have never lt so welcome in a pizza joint ever. I then get home and lay the huge brown box and open it up...dear lord. This pizza should be in the dictionary under the word \"pizza\", this pizza looked perfect. Huge slices of pepperoni, nice thin and  even slices, and surrounded by a huge nicely browned crust. I then opened the container of wings to be astonished at the size of them! These wings are the size of a babys arm, I kid you not. Overall, Big Gumbas is one hell of a find. Great prices, friendly staff, amazing food, and free wifi. You have to try this place!"}
{"text":"I order stuff based on reviews and I ordered from this place tonight. I guess family members and workers were paid to review this one. Reviews say to order \"Pizza, wings, and garlic knots\"  all 3 three were sooo bad! they use cheap ingredients and even after a drink or 2 the still food sucked. Pizza tasted like chalk, wings were microwaved and had no sauce on them, the garlic knots were dry knots of bread with NO flavor.  Order Papa Johns not this bs review place!!!!"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times and I'm impressed. The pizza is authentic new york style and the atmosphere is great. Good service and good prices. If you're a student, you can get two slices (big ones) and a drink for under 4 dollars. Ordering multiple pizzas is also a great deal so it's a good place to order from if you're having a party of something. The pizza is big and the toppings are fresh.  I suggest this place to anyone, especially students."}
{"text":"OK, so this is my experience with Big Gumbas...

I called for delivery and they put me on hold for like 3 minutes, which is a lot when you're hungry. The whole phone call ended up taking 8 minutes... to order a pizza and some wings. It took them 50 minutes to get here, and the delivery guy was SOOOOOOOO rude. He was a big smartass and when I asked him for a pen to sign the receipt he didn't have one, so I was looking around my apartment for one. He said, \"Uh, there's one RIGHT on the table there.\" Really? Then I told him to have a good night and he just turned and walked away. Alright, so the food. The large pizza was huge and really delicious, which is about the only good thing about the place. The wings -- holy god, most repulsive things ever. They were really big and had a lot of meat, but they didn't even put the sauce ON the wings. The sauce was this thin film on the bottom of the box, so barely any got on the wings. I decided to give them a try anyway, and grossgrossgross... they weren't even cooked all the way.

I'm a really, really unpicky eater. I eat about anything and I'm rarely disappointed by any type of food, but those wings... oh man. Raunchy.

I guess you can't win everything with really cheap prices! I have to admit that $11.50 after the coupon and ASU discount was a steal, but since I had to throw away the wings, it really wasn't that great of a deal... at least the pizza was good though!"}
{"text":"I ordered a lrg mushroom pizza / one dozen wings (half honey mustard, half buffalo *hot*).

They were at my door in under 30 minutes. I opened my pizza and saw that it had canned mushrooms on it and I made a frowny face. I mentioned this to the driver and she was more than happy to run back to her shop to grab me a different pizza. *pretty awesome* Since they just opened they were having to use the canned stuff tell next week.

So while I was waiting I reluctantly started on my order of wings *I say reluctantly because I have been nothing but disappointed in 80% of the wings I have had in the last 6 months*

JESUS SHIT FARM! Easily the best wings I have had in 6 months maybe more. They were perfectly crispy / meaty / flavorful. I have only had honey mustard wings one other time (oregano's) but they are one of my new favorite things in life! The buffalo s were tasty also. I finished those wings in under 8 minutes.

The second pizza was just pepperonis but really good. But those wings!! holey crap!

**3 weeks later**

So they are closed before 9:00 on sundays, don't not deliver before 4 on week days, and just now they didn't answer their phone. I had to knock off a star for the availability aspect of their business."}
