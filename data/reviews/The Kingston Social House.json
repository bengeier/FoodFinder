{"text":"We have been 3 times for brunch. The yogurt parfait is yummy. Thick cut smoked bacon.  Delicious coffee and juice. Fast and friendly service. Clean, bright and comfortable. Happy to have this place in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Went here for brunch and it was amazing. The food is great and they obviously use fresh ingredients. Friendly staff, place is clean and has nice decor, kind of small. When you order the flapjack stack, you might just be expecting some boring old pancakes, but that's not the case. I live in the area so this is gonna be my go-to brunch spot and I'm gonna try everything on the menu. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"We are 3 locals and we're excited to try this place.  Word on the street and dog park was to give it a try. We loved the atmosphere, warm welcome and the layout. We were there at 7 on a Thursday night.  We ordered a glass of wine and a mixed drink. Both were delicious after we waited 25 minutes to get them. There were 3 other couples there.  We then ordered a dip platter, 2 salads, a charcuterie board and lamb skewers. After 1 hour the food arrived.  The only thing that had to be cooked was the haloumi cheese and the lamb. We asked about the delay and the staff politely apologized explaining that the kitchen was catching up from an earlier party before opening at 7.  This was SLOW, shockingly slow. We probably won't go back.  It's too bad as we like to support local and the food was good."}
