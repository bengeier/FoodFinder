{"text":"I love Ryu Sushi. The food is fabulous but the service is even better. My family and I enjoy eating here about once a month. Always consistent!"}
{"text":"We tried Ryu as a spur-of-the-moment decision on New Year's Eve, and it did not disappoint. The sushi was fresh, delicious, and high-quality -- we ordered classics like the dragon roll, spicy tuna + shrimp tempura, and nigiri (salmon and unagi). The fish was cut generously with good proportions and value for the price.   Despite it being packed on a holiday night, the service was good and friendly, and our order came out in decent time. The atmosphere and decor is warm and modern, not cold the way some sushi/Japanese places are.  I look forward to trying more of their rolls (the Lovers roll and Surf & Turf both look tempting) and checking out the happy hour, which we were told is 5-7pm, Mon-Thurs.   Keep it up, Ryu Sushi!"}
{"text":"We come here every week! Dzu is the greatest and Anne is just as sweet as can be. We are always greeted with smiles, the staff is always super friendly, and the sushi is 2nd to none. I am always disappointed anytime we try a different sushi place. Love Ryu!"}
{"text":"I love this place. been going since it opened and I am so happy it has survived and thrived. mama san is the best person and truly cares for everyone and the food is great. the best sushi I have ever had and that is counting from my world travels. the only sushi I have ever had that is so good, soy sauce would be an injustice. thank you so much mama san. P.S. don't put soy sauce on anything until you have tried it first... I learned that from mama san... after she yelled at me for it :) and she was right. and just so you know... this is the cleanest sushi place I have ever been to."}
{"text":"Really delicious food, and I can't wait to go back!  I'm surprised to see negative reviews on the service; our waitress couldn't have been nicer.  The only downside is the small parking lot.  It was completely full when we arrived, yet the restaurant was probably 3/4 empty.  Not a huge deal because the strip mall's surrounding parking lots offer plenty of spaces; you just have to walk a bit.  The nigiri was soft and buttery.  The rolls were good, but were not rolled tightly enough, so they fell apart when trying to eat them and I lost a lot of rice in my dish of soy sauce.  The gyoza was steamed and probably the best I've had in Gilbert.  (Interestingly though, the gyoza that came with the kids meal was fried and not nearly as good.)  The edamame was served salty and piping hot - just like I like it!  At $8, the kids meals are probably the priciest kids meals I've ever seen, but they included salad, miso soup, your choice of entree, and ice cream, so they're still a pretty good value."}
{"text":"So happy to see familiar faces after Way Sushi closed. The sushi is fresh and the specialty roll menu original and delicious (the surf and turf is the BEST). Will be our new go to.."}
{"text":"Had an excellent meal last night with my daughter and husband.   Our first visit won't be or last.  From the warm greeting when entered,  to server who was very sweet, professional and personable, onto the chef at the grill that was enjoyable to watch and chat with right to leaving with another warm comment, the staff was great.  Now the food.  WOW My husband had steak and said it melted in his mouth,  I had seafood combo cooked to perfection and flavourful.  It all treasured so fresh.    I debated yelping because if more people go then I may not get in.  Ha.  Go go go."}
{"text":"Place smells like a dirty refrigerator. Sushi had that flavor in it as well, just didn't seem fresh. My daughter also wasn't happy with the food, we won't be returning."}
{"text":"Fantastic food and service.  They went above and beyond for our son's food allergies.   Had a great time and delicious meal!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went the night after Valentine's Day and made a reservation the night before for the teppanyaki table. We had never been there, never heard anything about it, and didn't even look it up online. It just happened to be near our house. They were really busy and it was taking a little time to get things going. But to our surprise, the manager stopped by and asked myself and the couple next to us, if she could get us another drink on her, to say sorry for the wait. It was unexpected and very nice of her to make sure we were happy and aware that we were seen. She stopped by as we were leaving to say sorry again and explain a bit more, that it was just one of those crazy nights but she had tried her best to keep it together and keep everyone happy and SHE DID JUST THAT!! :) She also reminded us to cover our 6 month old up cause it might be chilly out. I will def be back!!!! Oh....I forgot to mention if the great survive wasn't enough, my drinks were yummy, my Philly roll was AWESOME, and my shrimp teppanyaki was DEVINE!! Fan for life now!"}
{"text":"Great place! I made a reservation and right when we arrived our table was ready. I had the Tootsie roll and my boyfriend ordered the Eel Cucumber roll. The Tootsie roll was amazing definitely a must try! The young lady initially brought him out the wrong roll but let us have it on the house and brought him the correct order. We also got the fried rice with no meat and it was delicious!! The only reason why I didn't give rate it 5 stars is because we had to ask for soy sauce saucers and were brought the wrong roll but overall the service was great, quick, and tasted delicious! We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Love it... Love it, love it.  I've gone to this restaurant three or four times now, and each time I try something different and each time I enjoyed the food and experience.  My friend and I went to the restaurant a few Saturdays go for lunch, they had four large-screen TVs on so we were able to watch the game... The food was good our waitress had a great personality, we enjoyed ourselves. I found out last week he took his wife back for dinner, he liked it just that much."}
{"text":"Visited for the first time for our anniversary lunch. I was pleasantly surprised. The service was quick, food good (especially the Caterpillar Roll and the Alaska Roll) and fresh. My husband complained that the water tasted \"funny\" but I had soda and it was fine.  We'll go back!"}
{"text":"My little kids (5 and 2) love teppanyaki but most places roll their eyes when we come in and don't even give us a chance.  Not here.  They were awesome with out kids, asked us to wait so they could seat us with folks that were compatible (which is great, cause I don't want to sit with some couple who is out to dinner to get away from their kids.  So, food good, staff good...all around a great experience.  Our go-to teppanyaki from now on."}
{"text":"Terrible. First of all we were one of only 3 groups/people dining at the time. The back door was open and the sushi chef was out back smoking with his gloves on-smoke was filtering through the restaurant and he then proceeded to come back in and continue making sushi with the same gloves on. There were several servers wandering around yet we could never get anyone to help us. Our drinks were empty, we got no refills and we waited over 15 minutes for the check once we asked for it. While we waited our server and another stood behind the counter talking. We purposely did not tip after such a horrible experience and yet when I checked my credit card statement I was charged $20 more...they added on a $20 tip for themselves. Luckily my credit card is taking care of the matter. Regardless of this experience the food is mediocre at best. I'd much prefer other sushi joints down the street at the mall. This place is dirty and unprofessional to say the least."}
{"text":"It was our first dinner date out in a long time and my husband and I love sushi! The sushi was great but it took almost an hour to get our order!! We didn't complain because we figured we would just enjoy being together plus the waitress offered us a free salad or soup because it was taking so long. She claimed it was because they got busy but I personally think they forgot our order. It also made us late to our movie that we had  planned to go to. I would definitely go back if wouldn't be a long wait because the sushi really is good and creative! Try the surf n turf roll!"}
{"text":"Eaten here 15+ times and would recommend to others. Not as good as some places food wise but does hit the spot and is close to our house. Service is great they treat us like family :)"}
{"text":"Ryu Sushi replaced Way Sushi.  New owners, but similar teppanyaki experience.  The restaurant just opened, and it currently needs improvement.    First off, the service is slow.  We were promptly seated, but it took some time to have our order taken.  Our drinks were rarely refilled, and it took seemingly forever to receive our bill at the end.  The food choices are typical - chicken, steak, scallops, shrimp, etc.  The usual tricks and obligatory cheesy jokes kept us entertained, but the end result was dry/overcooked food that was underseasoned.  Even the fried rice was too bland.  We also ordered a sushi roll, which was mediocre - only a slight step above what you can buy in your local grocery store.  Price is on the high side, though this is typical for teppanyaki.  Pass."}
{"text":"I had the Ryu roll. It was basically a pile of poke salad, cucumbers, and cherry tomatoes dumped on top of some spicy tuna rolls wrapped in tempura batter. The tempura batter was getting pretty soggy toward the end, I should have dug it out and eaten it first. It was fresh, tasty, and enough to eat for dinner, but it didn't fulfill my sushi craving. The 20-oz beer they offered for $4 would have been most welcome if it weren't Coors Light."}
{"text":"Did a Groupon here and was worth the drive from Mesa! Great sushi and tools. Customer service was good! I will come back!"}
{"text":"Came here for my husband's birthday. Food was very good, service very good, and our a Teppanyaki chef was very entertaining and talented! Customer service was top notch. As we had a 3 and 7 year old in our party, we asked if they had any crayons. They went next door to Dollar Tree and bought some! Then they brought the birthday guy an ice cream sundae with a candle along with mini sundaes for my girls. Very nice, above and beyond service in my book!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time because we usually always go to Osaka for teppan but we wanted to try something new. I was disappointed by the portion sizes. At Osaka when we pay the 7 dollar share charge we get huge portions of fried rice and veggies and only share the meat portions which are still huge. Here we ordered filet and shrimp and only got 4 pieces of shrimp and tiny cubes of filet. We each only got about 4 spoon sizes portions of fried rice. The rice was bland, the shrimp was dry and rubbery. Filet was delicious though. My mom and I were still pretty hungry even though our bill came out to 45 bucks. Calamari was delicious, if I came back I would probably pass on the teppan and just get sushi and calamari. The teppan chef was not entertaining at all compared to osaka. He only entertained the girl who was celebrating her birthday and didn't say one word to the rest of the table. He a couple tricks but kept having to turn the vent and light on and off every time he did them so it got pretty smokey.   The service wasn't very great either. We had to move tables and the server wanted us to stand and wait while she cleaned her dirty tables first....even though there were about 10 open and perfectly clean ones. They only had one teppan chef working so I could imagine people getting frustrated with the wait. I think ill stick to my usual teppan place. Better food, better service, better portions."}
{"text":"There is really nothing wrong with this place. We are loyal customers of Sushiya but got a coupon and wanted to try something new. We liked it fine. The food is good. The place is bigger than Sushiya and staff is good too. But we still prefer Sushiya but if we want something different this one is good too. We like sitting at the counter."}
{"text":"They make some really tasty and good looking sushi. Try the chimichanga roll."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood spot for sushi or tapenyaki.  Owner's were very nice and ran a good operation. Definitely would go again."}
{"text":"Never going back. Just got seated with our 2 year old and were told \"oh I'm sorry, we actually don't have room for you, there's a large party who had reservations.\" 2 year old now crying and our night is shot. Thanks."}
{"text":"Amazing sushi. I don't particularly care for fish, so having a wide selection of seafood sushi is huge for me. Everything always tastes wonderful and we have always had friendly service. Our new go to sushi spot!"}
{"text":"Wish I could give them a 100 stars! My friends and I have been coming here for awhile now. The staff is friendly and you have not lived until you try the food. I haven't ordered too much of a selection but everything is perfectly made, fresh and delicious! A little on the pricer side but you get what you pay for. Never once had a bad expiereance"}
{"text":"Never eaten in (I live 2 min away and get sushi Togo) so I can't attest to the service of the wait staff, but they are definitely family owned which comes with challenges not dealt with at major chain sushi spots.   Concerning sushi, the rice is average no better or worse than 99/100 Az sushi spots. The \"specials\" avail are the big sell. I've had live scallop and uni both were great. Tonight I had legit A5 certified Kobe sashimi, raw snails, Scottish trout, Amaebi raw shrimp, and monk fish liver all fresh and well done.   The best summation I could give is that they are a neighborhood version of something you might find in Bellagio, hard rock, or l.a. I've had all these dishes before, better even, but at 4x the cost and not anywhere around town.   Never done tepan, or had \"bad fish\" I did have a nice pour of very good sake one time on the house while I waited. The value is strong and I would encourage people to eat there that are interested in quality sushi at a fair price. Less of course you \"just love\" California rolls. Then do them a favor and go to kona, or you demand absolute perfection in which case go to masa in NYC or sasabune in Honolulu and pay $200-$400/pp."}
{"text":"The owner, Ann is truly a beautiful gift and her love for life and her customers is transparent and the food was amazing (bonus!)"}
{"text":"Great sushi, teppanyaki and friendly staff! The owner is usually out visiting with people and helping serve food and drinks. Recently, our teppanyaki chef, Chris, came out after his shift and visited with us. I give it 4 stars only because sometimes when we first come in, there is nobody available to seat us and we've waited a few minutes before someone came."}
{"text":"This is my second time hrre within a year and i am once again pleased.  Try the scallop appetizers, they are large and delicious.  we tried the spicy albacore roll and the chimi roll.  The chimi roll is huge and would probably fill you up by itself.  To me the spicy albacore was hotter than the menu said, but is was very good.  We also used a restarant.com coupon and saved bout 12 dollars off the bill."}
{"text":"My husband took me here last night for my birthday. The food was outstanding, service was impeccable and the restaurant was immaculate. This was my first visit here, but it won't be the last. I plan to make this a regular go-to. I am looking forward to the fresh, live uni when they get it this winter. I don't know how I had never been here before!"}
{"text":"We started coming here when it FIRST opened. The Owner is sooo nice and always asks how my son is because she seen me from when I was pregnant to after he was born, now that we live further we do not go as often as we'd like, but on date nights we def go grab some sushi and chat it up with the Owner if she is in. The sushi is always delish, haven't tried the Teppanyaki, but it always looks and smells good! I will say the last time we went it seemed like there was no ventilation for the smoke from the Teppanyaki."}
{"text":"Kevin was our server awesome service!!! Ann the manager came by and talked with us like we owned the place. They are awesome must try!!! We got the chilli cheese it was awesome and the crazy roll was off the hook!"}
{"text":"Overall pretty high-quality. Generally fairly crowded and often a wait at key times, but that's because it's popular for a reason. We have found the service to be slow but otherwise excellent quality with good Customer Care. In general the sushi is way better than the other Asian food they serve."}
{"text":"Great food , order the giant it's not on the menu but was recommended to me. It's a huge roll"}
{"text":"I went with my family for the first time to this amazing restraint! This was one of the best I've had in the Gilbert and quite honestly In all of Arizona! I was so surprised on how tasty everything was and every single time I took a bite I was just like \"WOW, this is Heavenly!\"   The menu meets all of my standards and beyond. All of the menu items seemed so imaginative and delightful! The specialty rolls I ordered were the Boo Ya Ka Roll, Surf & Turf, as well as the Chimichanga, Everything was fresh and thoughtfully made. The ingredients for their sauces they used in some of their rolls were well balanced and made it flavorsome. Their sushi rolls are pretty big too so it's definitely worth what you're paying for. If you leave some room for dessert and try I recommend their Pizookie.  Delicious!  I also noticed they have great happy hour drinks or specialty drinks! The customer service was beyond superior. The lady owner there is super sweet and you could tell she really cares about her customers. She takes the time to talk to every table and makes sure you are enjoying your experience.  I highly recommend this place for sushi! I am planning to be a regular here not only because I want to try everything they have on their menu but because they really truly do have great food!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Teppan is always entertaining but it's the food that keeps us coming back. I'm never disappointed eating here."}
{"text":"Not a good experience. Came for dinner. While we were just seated in the regular dining area, the smoke from the Teppan grill was horrible. It lingered over us. It didn't seem to ventilate. We were seated at a table that was six inches from the wait station computer where the staff entered orders, congregated, argued, etc.   We ordered a dragon roll and nigiri. Sushi was okay. Chicken Katsu was nothing special. Wished they had a bento box or combo for dinner. We won't be back."}
{"text":"Ok so first impressions are everything right,well this place bombed. Went in sat down and waited for over ten minutes for any type of service. Nothing. They weren't busy so no excuse there. Three girls just standing around doing nothing. Waiters and waitresses walking by not even a glance or a hello. Only when we got up to leave we were acknowledged and the only excuse was \"we were out of money \" not going there again"}
{"text":"This place is by far the best sushi in the valley and I've pretty much been to them all. I was impressed at how fresh and flavorful their sushi was. It was amazing. I've eaten there in February, March & May. Service was great. Owner very friendly. This is my new favorite sushi restaurant."}
{"text":"Went on Valentine's Day so it was busy and could have effected my experience. The hostess was rude though, never an excuse for that. The food was good. Not bad pricing but it's not an almost 5 star restaurant. It's a solid 3. Not sure I would go back though."}
{"text":"We wanted to try Ryu since we live in the neighborhood! We were seated promptly and placed our orders. The atmosphere was very nice, fairly upscale for being in a shopping center. We went on a Sunday evening and it wasn't that busy. We had our own teppanyaki grill as the few others had full tables. Our appetizers were served quickly. Both were good (edamame and egg rolls) although fairly small serving size. The soup and salad were what you expect from teppanyaki, both were average. The reason I can't give it 5 stars was how long we waited for the chef to come over and do the cooking of the entrees. After about 30 minutes another couple came in and were seated with us...about 15 mins after they sat down we finally got a chef. He was entertaining and had a few new tricks we hadn't seen before. My FAVORITE aspect of the restaurant, which will DEFINITELY have me going back is that they serve SHRIMP SAUCE!!! I'm from back east and ALL teppanyaki places (even Benihana) serve 3 sauces...the mustard, the soy/ginger and a shrimp suace. I've been in AZ for 11 years and have tried numerous teppanyaki places and NO ONE here serves shrimp sauce, just the mustard and soy/ginger. I never really got too excited about teppanyaki because of the lack of shrimp sauce (it's my favorite of the 3) so to see this made the whole experience that much better!. There is nothing like shrimp sauce on the fried rice (SO SO GOOD!!). So for all you native Phoenicians or southwest folks who don't know what that light colored sauce is...put it on the rice, put it on everything...it's soooo yummy! I'm so happy they serve it that even after waiting almost an hour for our chef to start cooking, I will most definitely be back to Ryu!! My husband had the steak and it was cooked perfectly. I had the chicken and it was good as well. We both loved the fried rice, it was delicious as were the shrimp appetizer. Our daughter ordered the noodle dish and it was good as well. We did not try any sushi but those that we saw others had seemed to enjoy them."}
{"text":"Stick to the Nigiri & most Sushi... All the other items special or Tepanyaki are too pricy.  Benihana is gonna be better cost & put on a show if your I to that kinda stuff.  For a simple bite to eat - nothing more."}
{"text":"I do not know how this place has such good reviews... the sushi is mediocre.  There are some \"interesting\" rolls, but nothing to write home about.  The nigiri we had, had a weird texture and a watery flavor.  I also had some udon, which was \"so, so.\"  I might come back here to try the Teppanyaki... or maybe try another noodle dish, but, in all, this place was nothing to rave about.  I should also note that, while we were there, we observed a waitress drop chop sticks on the ground, pick them up, and place them on a table as if nothing had happened.  Not sure I trust the cleanliness of this place either.  That, and, on top of all this, it was too expensive too."}
{"text":"Food is good. But the tables were still dirty with dishes. We wanted to sit at the bar but the whole bar was dirty......Hire another bus boy or train the one you have...."}
{"text":"We did the Teppanyaki for my husband's birthday last week, and it was so fun! The chef, Benny was a hit with the kids, and they had a great time! The food was delicious, and the atmosphere was great. We'll be back for sure!!"}
{"text":"Great place! We needed to have gluten free food, so they cooked it separately ,in the kitchen, just make sure of no cross contamination!  The food was so good and fresh! We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Filthy. Gas stations have cleaner bathrooms. Lost my appetite after smelling other people's pee pee and poo poo. I don't know how any chef could wash their hands in those bathrooms without them getting more dirty than before."}
{"text":"Amazing service with great quality sushi and it's all perfectly priced. Love this place for a great sushi night."}
{"text":"Acrid New York steak. I sent it back, they had to redo - they recooked in the back, not on teppan grill.  Shrimp was miscounted for table - teppan chef had to step in and manage to get more for table while multitasking.  Was great when it opened, place has taken a serious nose dive.  Go to Rock Lobster by CHoP, corner of Price and Queen Creek in the Cays. Much better."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!  Our teppan chief was Vincent and he was hilarious! Not only do you get dinner but he also puts on a \"show\" for you as well. Definitely will request him again next time!  Got a double order of fried rice with steak and scallop. Yummy! They scallops were juicy, tender and BIG pieces! Definitely worth the price. Double fried rice was a lot of rice but I got to take some home and it definitely taste good the next day! (:   Will definitely come back! Cause I'm dreaming of them scallops -drools-"}
{"text":"I have gave this place a number of chances to be the restaurant is wished it could be. The food is OK the service is always undermanned. (Our sushi can after the fried rice (it was ordered well before the teppanyaki) they messed up a number of orders not to mention it took 45 min for us to get our checks. Sad thing is that's not the worse. The temperature was so hot it was cooler out side @ 5pm in July. So if you like ok food, appetizers after your main dish, the wrong food, understaffed restaurant, sweating on your food, your bill being wrong, (o ya management telling the server she can't go home till she pays it. May I mention never came over once to ask it we had a good dinner *about $1000 with the tip paid out*) then please be my guest. I will never go back and never recommended this restaurant to my worst enemy."}
{"text":"It normally takes awhile to eat in here and so I usually order to go but tonight even that was bad.   I ordered 2 rolls and noodles. I was told 20-30mins and so I went close to the 30 min mark. When I arrived they said they were waiting on my noodles. So I waited about 20 more minutes before finally asking  what was going on. I was then told about another 20 min so I decided to cancel that portion but right as she was going to ask they brought it out.   I should have asked they remake my rolls since they had sat for 30-40 mins and one was a crazy roll which is tempura. When I got home my spicy mama roll was warm and the crazy roll was soggy and cold. I was able to save the spicy mama by putting it in the fridge for awhile but the crazy roll was just gross once soggy.   The noodles were such a small portion that they were only enough for my 5 yr old to eat, we normally order one to split between our 3 kids when eating there and it's always been enough. But they also had zero flavor! Normally they have a sauce but this was was plain noodles and chicken. They were gross!   So I paid $45 for warm, soggy sushi and a tiny portion of unflavored noodles. I would have gone back but I had to be somewhere and didn't have time."}
{"text":"Friday night, first service impression was terrible.  Seating process was haphazard and frustrating.  Ordered salmon teriyaki, super small fish portion and way too sweet.  The sushi rolls we ordered were good, everyone was happy with those.  Overall, mediocre food and a bit overpriced.  Unpleasant Dining experience and poor ventilation, we all reeked of the grill smell.  They did accommodate some food modifications."}
{"text":"Our first time here. We were pleasantly greeted upon entering.  Gentlemen server was kind and answered our questions very confidently when asked about ingredient content.  (We have nut allergies.)   We ordered the lunch salmon bento and nabeyaki udon.  Good size lunch bento.  Salmon was cooked just right with tasty accompanying sauce.  Con:Tempura batter was very sweet and thickly coated.  (Traditional tempura should be lightly coated so you can focus on the meat or vegetables when you bite into it- not the deep fried batter.   Pro:A very generous helping of edamame beans were included in the box as well.  The Nabeyaki udon was fine.   Pro:The female management was visiting all the tables as diners ate their lunch.   I would visit again."}
{"text":"Great food! We love their happy hour that lasts until 7pm.  The owner Ann is so nice. She remembers us when we visit even after a long time not coming and I noticed several other patrons come in over the course of our meal that she was so friendly and familiar with. This is one of our favorite sushi and Teppan places in the valley!"}
{"text":"I cannot say enough good things about this place. This place is truly amazing and the owner is wonderful and always greets me by name. The food is delicious and the price is very reasonable. This place to me is better then Bennihanna. It's a must go to!"}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying that the food is mighty tasty at this restaurant. I had the Teriyaki Teppanyaki and my wife had the Steak and Crab Legs Teppanyaki. That said, you know me, I give credit where credit is due: Jose, our chef was pretty damn cool. In a restaurant like this where they cook in front of you, the chef plays such a critical part of your meal and your experience. Jose, you did a great job my man. Thank you and thank you to the rest of the staff for making this a great experience for my wife and I.   This place is 'Primetime'!"}
{"text":"We love this place, we love that you can order teppanyaki without having to watch the whole show (you know if you go there once a week for the food, not a show, which they are great for too for birthdays and celebrations! Always friendly and good service, even if something takes a little longer they make sure to communicate and please the customer! Big plus that you can make reservations!!"}
{"text":"By far best sushi I've tasted in Phoenix area! The service is second to none, the owner always make it a point to stop by for a chat and usually offer free samples of saki or food. If you're looking for a sushi spot this is definitely the place to eat!!"}
{"text":"I used to like this place.  My first bad experience her today was it took 30 minutes for our sushi to get on our table.  The sushi chef served a family that came in after us before making our order. Very unprofessional! I ordered a spicy beef ramen that was \"ok\". The broth tasted generic. The noodles were excellent.  I was done with my ramen before my husband received his sushi. Very disappointed. I don't want to return."}
{"text":"Sashimi wasn't cut correctly and all fish had a funny flavor. The tuna was pink instead of red. We ordered through door dash and if we'd been in the restaurant I would have sent it back and requested that we not pay for the meal. The wasabi is an odd color and I'm not sure what it was made from. I'm honestly a little worried about food poisoning. There are so many better places to eat sushi. Seriously. Pick somewhere else. The price is too high for such low quality."}
{"text":"This was our first time in. We were really impressed.  A great selection fast friendly service and a good value.  Not cheap sushi- no one wants that. Nice portions great  flavors at a very good price.  We will be back."}
{"text":"We had a really good teppanyaki and sushi experience here. We came on a Thursday around 1 (Teppanyaki closes at 2:30 and opens again late afternoon) and were the only people there. It is a lot bigger inside than it looks from outside- a nondescript strip mall setting. The inside is clean and comfortable with updated decor and the service was phenomenal. In fact, the service is what wowed us the most.   The greeter, who was also our server, was prompt, friendly and very helpful. He went out of his way to get us extra dips, offered to-go cups when we were leaving, and spoke with the sushi chef when he realized I was pregnant to ensure that our sushi ingredients were all cooked and prepared with care. The owner was also incredibly sweet, friendly and helpful and stopped by several times to chat and ask if we were taken care of.   We first ordered sushi, which was a great deal of 2 for $10 on a limited list. Due to preggo status, we went for two cooked rolls, the Tootsie and the Vegatable Tempura. Both were phenomenal. The owner recommended more cooked rolls for next time as well.    I got the teriyaki chicken and my husband ordered the steak and we both liked our dishes very much. They came with soup and salad to start while the chef prepared the meal on the grill in front of you. Vincent was our chef and he was goofy, friendly and talkative with us. His cooking \"show\" was also very entertaining. The vegetables are much more varied than other teppanyaki places we have frequented and they give you sautéed spinach as well. The fried rice was AMAZING and my chicken and hubby's steak were good. The 2 pieces of shrimp they give you were a bit over grilled and tough to chew but we still really enjoyed our food. I was grateful that our server brought us a little side of eel sauce because the teriyaki didn't have much flavor and the two dipping sauces (ginger and seafood sauces, I believe) were lacking some flavor as well. Other than the lackluster sauces and chewy shrimp, everything was perfect!   Please note that there are not lunch teppanyaki prices like at other similar restaurants but the portion size is huge and they do a show for you at lunch as well.  Both my husband and I had a full meal of leftovers, with which the owner placed extra sauces so our rice wouldn't get soggy. We will certainly be back soon!"}
{"text":"Love it here they have great sushi and the teppanyaki was good too !! The staff are super friendly!!"}
{"text":"We have been to a few Hibachi restaurants in the area.  This one is the best we have found in the East Valley.   It also says alot about the establishment when you see the owner running around making sure guests are happy and involved in the business."}
{"text":"Better than Benihana . and much more personable staff.  The chef was funny and really geared toward the kids. It was my grandsons 7th birthday dinner . He and his 5yr old twin brothers and 16yr old big brother. They took really good care of us the food was really delicious and there was more veggies that  Benihanas. It was cheaper too! The food was plenty."}
{"text":"Great entertainment and food. We had the chicken and steak combo with fried rice and it was better than the well-known teppanyaki places. They serve garlic grilled spinach plus the vegetables, which was unusual but very good. They also offer roasted garlic bits for your meal that add extra flavour. The teppanyaki was a lot of fun and a great place for special occasions and families."}
{"text":"Coming from a coastal city, I'm always skeptical of sushi here in the valley. BUT THIS PLACE IS AMAZING! With fresh fish delivered at least 4 times a week and the friendliness of the staff, makes this place hands down the ONLY sushi place for me here in AZ. Their rolls are delicious and the interactions with the sushi chefs (especially John) were entertaining.  Although, I did not try the tappanyaki the smells wafting over to the sushi bar alone made my mouth water. HIGHLY recommend this place as whole. The lively atmosphere and tasty eats make it totally worth it!"}
{"text":"We wanted something fun and out of the ordinary after a Chandler Symphony Orchestra Pops concert. We were dressed up so I thought to surprise my date with Teppanyaki!! She loved it! The chef did a fantastic and fun cooking/chopping/flipping and flame-ball-make presentation. Anyway the food was exceptionally fresh, flavor and the portions were generous. The meal was healthy, hearty and happy! The ambiance was more, \"Asian fusion\" and they have sushi!  A solid 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Went to Ryu for the second time tonight and I have to say that this place is legit! The kids and I had Teppanyaki and the wife had sushi. Tonight was probably the best experience I have had at a Teppanyaki joint ever, outside, of the one in Tokyo where the chef was, I assume, an actual ninja. Anyhow, the chef tonight was awesome. He did all the usual gags that the kids love ie... The onion volcano and the beating fried rice heart but he also displayed some excellent knife skills. Way above and beyond anything I have seen here in the states. My kids really enjoyed him throwing shrimp into their mouths from across the table. So the entertainment was really good but what about the food? Food was amazing too, seriously, it was much more flavorful than my average experience at a Teppanyaki place, which is usually Benihana in Chandler.  The veggies were way more than the typical cucumbers, mushrooms and onions. Those were there but also broccoli, potatoes, and a nice helping of spinach cooked on the grill in sesame oil. I had the filet and chicken combo. The filet was cooked to a perfect medium/rare just as I requested. The kids meals were plentiful and neither of them could finish. The wife had a couple of different kinds of sushi and said they were excellent. I had one piece of some roll that had jalapeño, avocado and some other stuff. I thought it was good and I don't ever eat sushi. As I said before, this is the second time we have gone to Ryu. First time was fine but it was also right after the place opened. This time, all my expectations for this experience were definitely exceeded. Will be choosing Ryu over Benihana in the future."}
{"text":"This place is a great locally owned sushi and teppanyaki spot.  It's mostly modern with a mom & pop down to earth flare.  The Las Vegas rolls never disappoint and they have a couple of signature rolls that are pretty good backups to my favorite (LV).  The chimichanga roll was sort of spicy while the chili cheese roll calls for a mouth fire extinguisher.  The servers, staff and owner are all friendly.  This restaurant is great like Benihana without the pretentiousness and extremely high prices.  However, they werent exactly adequately staffed during lunch (11:30), so don't plan on getting out of there in a rush.  Their lunch specials are good, but some of their rolls when not on special can be a tad costly.  Also, the water doesn't taste filtered, rather closer to hose water. Yuck! I hate when I have to order a soda because a restaurant has gross water.  Lastly, the server had a hard time understanding my request of spicy mayo. She asked me to repeat a few times and upon her request, I spelled it out for her.  Maybe there aren't many people that request it?  But, I love it!"}
{"text":"I'd say better than Benihana for sure! Chefs were awesome! And staff friendly. Well ventilated unlike some places. Def accommodated large group."}
{"text":"My first experience was very pleasing. I was seated accordingly and our server was awesome. I just wish I could remember her name so that I could consciously acknowledge her. My Tenppanyaki dish was absolutely delicious. (I had ordered in regular seating, not the Teppanyaki table) When I have my last meal in this Earth, I hope it can taste similar to the dish I had their! (Maybe I was just really hungry when I visited)"}
{"text":"Our group of nine arrived at 6pm, we had reservations but the place was pretty open. It filled up between 630-7. The sushi was amazing, our teppanyaki chef was fun and everything we ordered was fabulous. The service was great too. We will be back... The kids are already asking us when!"}
{"text":"We come here 3 or 4 times per month.  This is our favorite sushi restaurant in the area.  Service is very good and the sushi is phenomenal!  There are great prices and a huge selection on the happy hour menu.  Give it a try, you'll be glad you did!"}
{"text":"The rolls were ok and Nigiri was horrible. We asked for no cucumber in both roll the dragon roll and the crunchy roll. And they both came out with it in them. The waitress was new and apologized but didn't say she would go remake it. I suggested \"I guess we can pick it out\" and she said \"yah that what most people do with things they don't like.\" She should have remade it right away.  She should have not even brought it out.   Our nigiri was so fishy. The fish didn't  taste fresh at all. The cut of the fish was literally almost a quarter of an inch thick & Barely any rice. Horrible balance and the Nigiri fell apart. We had the Shrimp, tuna, and salmon. All were way below par."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch and it was perfect! I am trying to limit my rice in take and they had rolls wrapped in cucumber and another in a soy paper wrap I think, it was great!"}
{"text":"I called and they made the time for my reservation even though they closed at 2:30 to prep for dinner. Absolutely the best TEPPANYAKI I have ever had. Raul our chef was AMAAAAZING AND SO CARING! The owner was the sweetest and she hugged me and wished me a happy birthday many times. I was given a freee birthday drink and an ice cream at the end. I can't express how amazing my experience was and I will be going back many many more times. I love this place and I recommend it to anyone!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Great sushi, great service. Will be back many times.  The tepanyaki is also very good.  Try the Kobe beef sushi when they get it in."}
{"text":"Low quality, SLOW, and not worth it!   Blegh do not come here!   Came here for dinner with my family, I was looking forward to it because of everyone else's reviews. The tuna sashimi was old, had stringy parts, and was mushy. Couldn't stomach it at all. The salmon was a little better but all of the sashimi was cut way too thick and big which reduced the quality.   The lovers roll was forgettable. Not worth the $12.   Finally, we were still hungry so we ordered a ramen soup and an udon noodle soup. We waited almost 35 minutes for it before being told that they were still going to take 5 minutes. It's unbelievable how slow this place is, the sushi took a long time too.   I wish I could get our money back, what a wasted meal. PLEASE don't come here,"}
{"text":"Service was very slow despite the few patrons for lunch.  Sushi was mediocre.  Won't hurry back."}
{"text":"These guys are friendly! I been here once for a friends birthday all I can say is great food, great service!"}
{"text":"Pretty good sushi. I always take out so I don't know about the service. Love the Hamachi and Salmon Kama, baked mussels are great. Sushi seems pretty fresh for AZ standards."}
{"text":"Hands down the BEST sushi in the valley! The owner is sweet, the sushi chefs put out quality sushi every single time. My favorite is the lollipop roll...no rice which is great for someone on a low carb diet. If you like sushi, you will love this place!"}
{"text":"We love the sushi!  We've been twice and will be back again...sometimes service is good sometimes not. Food is delicious!"}
{"text":"The family and I always have a great time and the have exceptional service. The wife had filet mignon and chicken, I had ribeye and shrimp. The cook was able to cook all the meats to perfection while maintaining high energy and working 2 tables at the same time. This place is great and would recommend it to all."}
{"text":"Just a FYI to other Yelpers -- this establishment no longer accepts restaurant.com vouchers.  IMO, it is not one of the better Japanese restaurants and we used to only go there with a coupon since that made it more affordable, from a cost/value basis.  But this is no longer available so I guess we will be going to other Japanese restaurants now."}
{"text":"This place is great! the teppan here is soo good i think they cook it all to perfection, the chefs are funny, we had Chris he was great to our party of 8 for dinner and everyone was happy with their food choices and all the flavor! would recommend this anytime!! will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I had a great time on Valentine's day here. The food was amazing and it was worth spending the money on the food here. We sat in the grill area and our cheif was funny and not too crazy. We ordered lobster and chicken and it was amazing. What I really liked about Ryu is that you get alot of food compare to other places like these. Our entree included two pieces of shimp, veggies, and rice. We had such a good time last night, we are totally coming back!   ps. The staff is really nice and sweet."}
{"text":"Good food! We all had the chicken steak and shrimp with fried rice. Chicken was the only area I could see an improvement. The fried rice and vegetables were delicious!"}
{"text":"Service was very prompt and friendly. The sushi roll is too big around for my preference, making it hard and messy to eat.  Sushi wasn't bad but didn't taste as fresh as I'd prefer. The sushi bar was fun, I enjoyed chatting with the other people at the bar."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful experience last night at Ryu Sushi Teppanyaki! The staff are professional, warm, and energetic. The food is fresh and properly cooked, compared to some places that have had some inconsistencies. The Chef was entertaining and had some serious knife skills! He also had a talent with fire...sorcery! It's not perfect each visit, but it has become our \"go to\" sushi places in Gilbert!"}
{"text":"Food was good but service fairly bad....everybody's food came out at different times and very little inquiry from the waitress..."}
{"text":"Ryu is our go to for Birthday dinners, Mommy and Daddy date and family time. We love Ryu!"}
{"text":"This is a decent place for not-so-expensive sushi. The sashimi was average quality, but the gyoza and signature rolls were pretty good. Overall a good value for the money."}
{"text":"This was our first visit to Ryu, we made the drive down to this place because of a Restaurant.com coupon, but I'll touch on that in a bit. The restaurant was a very chill place were anyone can come right in and enjoy some good food. We had an opportunity to check out the menu before we got to the restaurant so we had some ideas of what we would be ordering. The staff was friendly and was very helpful describing the different dishes we would be ordering plus some dishes the waiter recommended. We utimately decided on three rolls, the Chimichanga Roll, the Las Vegas Roll and the Shrimp Tempura Roll. They were all very delicious especially the Chimichanga Roll, it had an extra kick that I enjoyed with the spicy tuna, crab, jalapeno and cream cheese. We also ordered the Spicy Beef Ramen and the Chicken Yakisoba which was ok and the Chicken Yakisoba was, surprisingly, a very small portion compared to the $13 price tag. All in all we enjoyed ourselves and would come back next time for the Teppanyaki experience. Oh and back to the Restaurant.com deal, I was told the restaurant does not honor this coupon for reasons of miscommunication between the two companies, this would be the deal breaker for me ever coming back especially for a mistake I had nothing to do with. The waiter stated because of the issue he would have to get it reviewed by the manager. After about 5 minutes the waiter returned and stated to me that they will honor the coupon and gave me heads up about the coupon for the future. Well done! This shows me that they are in the business for customer satisfaction and that is what I was \"satisfied\". Thank you for having us. See you all soon!"}
{"text":"Great Place! Excellent, friendly service. Tasty food. Been here three times and tried many selections from the menu (not sushi). All were very good!! Pretty good atmosphere. Can be noisy when crowded. Reasonable prices and portions."}
{"text":"Food is good but the owners have failed to maintain the place very well.  When the ropened after the previous owners vacated the place was really nice.  But now all the decor is worn (curtains), bathrooms wore down and in need of maint, electrical wires coming out of the floor near the waterfeature, everything just looks worn and dirty.  Lastly we had water dripping on our table when it started raining outside.   When I eat sushi I want the restaurant to be clean and well kept.  I feel if they dont maintain the restaurant itself, then I question how well they keep and prepare the RAW sushi"}
{"text":"We stopped in on a Sunday for dinner.  We ate at the tappenyaki grill with the kids and it was fun.  We had chef Chris.  The food was good and the chef was entertaining.  The service was great add the waitress was on top of our drinks and keeping the foods coming.  I would recommend this place for both good and service."}
{"text":"The service has been getting much better through the years.  Noticing newer wait staff, maybe that was the change needed, to have better service here.  The owner is always so sweet and personable, she always recognizes her customers and takes time to greet them personally even when they are busy.  The food is average compared to other places, definitely better than RA and Kona.  I give this place 3 stars only because there's another Japanese Restaurant down the street that just can't be beaten as their amazing food and sushi chefs speak for itself."}
{"text":"Great place to eat and a wonderful staff very helpful on helping you decide the correct dish for the best first experience of teppyanaki and did I mention it came with a show ? It's a great place to relax with the family and an amazing experience would definitely recommend. I will absolutely be coming back !!"}
{"text":"A very modern and hip sushi/teppanyaki restaurant. The smell and sizzling sounds  tantalizes the senses. You must be thinking, why 3 stars?  What can i say...the food is 'ok', service is 'ok', the price is 'ok'. Basically it's just average Asian restaurant. I may have given a better rating,if I received what I ordered. The appetizers were good. Can't really screw up Gyoza and the rainbow roll was mediocre. Now, 30min later our entree is out. We ordered the the pork Katsu but it's a bit dry. It also stated in the menu it would come with a side salad and soup but never made it on the table. Also the Seafood Ramen would have been excellent. Again the menu stated it would have shrimp, scallops and Mussels.BUT, there were NO mussels. I actually came here just to try their  seafood ramen and they had great Yelp Ratings. I ended up ordering baked mussels just to satisfy my cravings.   You must be thinking, why didn't I complain or give them a chance to fix the meals? Well quite frankly, I didn't want to wait for another meal to be brought out and be Disappointed again.   There wasn't anything amazing about the place. Nothing that would make me come back.Aside from that, the presentation of the food was good."}
{"text":"SO MUCH fun!!!  Our chef was a blast & we brought 4 people that had never seen the presentation at the teppan cooktop.  It was a blast.  Service was amazing, drinks flowed constantly, our waitress never let it get empty before she went back to the bar for another round.  HIGHLY recommend!!"}
{"text":"Tried this spot last night with a group of friends for an early birthday celebration. We were pretty impressed! I split the seafood combo with a girlfriend. Shrimp, scallops and lobster were amazing! They had a couple additions to the grill that I hadn't experienced before including spinach and potatoes! Yum! Husband had steak and it was cooked perfectly and quite tasty. This spot would've gotten a five stars if it weren't for the rubbery chicken served to my friends, it was pretty much inedible :/ not sure what happened!! Fried rice was delicious, and the chef was great, he even let me flip an egg!!"}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant at least a dozen times in the last year and a half. My husband and I sit at the bar every time. The service is always great! The servers will always answer questions about the menu, and they will easily customize a sushi roll for me! I've tried at least 10 different rolls, some straight from the menu, or just making one up. They've always been fresh, and usually come out better than I had hoped. I've never had the teppanyaki, as we usually eat lunch here. But as I sit here now, there is a family getting a great show, the cook is flipping the egg, setting the stove top on fire, and getting all our attention from the bar! Great place for a quick bite, for friends to have a drink, or even a family with kids for a fun show and dinner! Would recommend!"}
{"text":"A little pricey for lunch... But, I suppose I did over indulge a little with a bento box AND a squid salad.   No complaints, the sushi was fresh & the service was quick. The only server handled the entire restaurant by himself with ease. Will definitely make this a recurring lunch spot!"}
{"text":"OK i did a review for this place when it was called Way Sushi and that place SUCKED. Now...this place is called RYU Sushi with new ownership and needless to say, my sushi experience there was one of the best I've had in the Gilbert area. I went with a few of my girlfriends for GNO (girls night out) night and I was so surprised on how tasty everything was and every single time I took a bite I was just like \"WOW, this is so goodddd!\"  Their specialty menu is what got to me. All of them seemed so creative and delish! The specialty rolls I ordered was the Boo Ya Ka Roll (My favorite), Surf & Turf, Chimichanga, Basil, and their Spicy Tuna Pokie Salad. Everything was fresh and thoughtfully made. The ingredients for some of their special sauces they used in some of their rolls were well balanced and made it flavorsome. Their sushi rolls are pretty big too so it's definitely worth what you're paying for. Oh, make sure to leave some room for dessert and try their Pizookie! Yes...I said Pizookie! I was surprised too when I heard this. My girls and I killed it and when I went there again the 2nd time I took my bf and ordered the Pizookie as well and we devoured the deliciousness.   Ryu, also has great happy hour drinks or specialty drinks! So that is also a plus! Their customer service was beyond superior. The lady owner there is super sweet and you could tell she really cares about her customers. She takes the time to talk to every table and makes sure you are enjoying your experience at Ryu. ( I love customer service like this)   By the end of the night after 3-4 hours. Our GNO night ended up to be a Food Coma night...LOL. We were so full but happy full =)  I highly recommend this place for sushi! I am planning to be a regular here not only b/c I want try everything they have on their menu but because they really truly do have great food. Go see for yourself. =P"}
{"text":"I don't dole praise for sushi restaurants easily. My husband and I are our self-proclaimed sushi snobs and we are so grateful that we have Ryu so close to home for a quick and tasty sushi fix.   Specifically, we really enjoy the barbecued salmon roll, spicy tuna roll, veggie roll and sashimi. The spicy tuna roll is what we use as a litmus test to judge if a sushi restaurant is good and worth a return visit. It is and we continue to come back.   The staff is great. Really great. We can put away a lot of sushi and so we're grateful when the waitstaff doesn't make us feel bad for having good appetites. The Ryu staff has always treated us respectfully and we're glad to see them when we stop by or pick up.   I highly recommend Ryu, especially for their sushi."}
{"text":"We came here with a Restaurant.com voucher.  First time.  It was more or less what I expected with some teppanyaki tables and some regular tables and a sushi bar.  We took a regular table (it would have been a wait for the teppanyaki.    Originally I ordered ramen, but it turned out they didn't have any left.  (weird)  So I went with the yakisoba.  My wife got one of their signature rolls (which was breaded and deep fried...kinda weird again!).  We also got the poke appetizer.  The poke was nice.  I've had better, but it was good.  Then came the roll.  It was topped with tuna and salmon (like a poke).  The topping was pretty good (watch out for jalapeños!).  The crunchy roll was unusual, but the flavor was good.  My yakisoba took forever to come out.  They never did say why.  But it finally came.  Portion size was reasonable (could have been more for the price, but not too bad).  The flavor was good.  Not exceptional, but good.  It's an OK place.  The coupon made it a very good value.  Without the coupon it's just \"OK\" value.  Maybe next time we'll try the teppanyaki."}
{"text":"Wonderful chef, funny and engaging we went for my 7 year olds birthday because he wanted Benihana which I find overpriced. He wanted to watch them cook in front of us. This place did not disappoint and to top it off was quite a bit cheaper I call this a win win. Flavors were on point, atmosphere was charming and the waitstaff was attentive and fun. We were seated right away and the food wasn't far behind. We ordered gyoza which was delicious with just the right amount of crunch, the chicken teriyaki was amazing and a sizable portion. The kids had steak and although it was a kids meal the size was enough to feed an adult. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Such an embarrassing night at Ryu. We have been repeat customers at Ryu for years. We made reservations for my family of five. Arrived and the restaurant was very busy. After we checked in with the hostess we waited for about 25 mins. A young family walked in and were immediately seated instead of my family. I inquired with the hostess who then checked with her manager and instead of just asking us to wait and comping a portion of our meal, they actually asked the family to get up from the table. They made a situation worse by embarrassing both the family they asked to get up from the table and my family. I urged the manager to leave the family seated but they decided to continue the path and all parties are now unhappy.   Restaurant etiquette is important, now you have lost many customers instead you could have kept two families as customers. I feel so bad for that family that was asked to get up, I am sorry for how this all played out.   To Ryu I will not be back again."}
{"text":"Extremely poor service. Made reservations one week ago and they called me today to say they had overbooked and couldn't accommodate. Unfortunately I had heard that from several people but wanted to give it a try!  No apology just seemed very confused."}
{"text":"MUCH BETTER that the place it was before, Way Sushi  The rolls are creative and tasty... better than most places, and I eat at a lot of different sushi places in many different states.  The one area they could improve on is to have more rolls/items on their happy hour menu."}
{"text":"Worst customer service ever!! I've never had such a horrible experience paying with a large group, waitress was never around. Took 20mins just to order water, the place was not busy. They added 18% graditutity charge. (Way too much for shitty service) food was good but that's about it! This was a disappointment for sure will not be back!"}
{"text":"We had the best time here! Food was great! Service was great and our chef was fantastic!! I highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Ha-do-Ken!  Just something I thought about when I saw the name of this place.  Ryu Sushi & Teppanyaki is what the name implies; Sushi & Teppanyaki.  Pretty straight forward.  I came with a large group and started with drinks.  Happy Hour can be delightful with great prices!    The place itself is large and open and great for groups if you're planning to come.  Teppanyaki style meals are to West of the restaurant and I can see how in a packed house this place can pop!  For my entree I ordered the Chirashi Don bowl, a rice bowl mixed with crab meat served with seaweed salad, fresh cut vegetables, assorted Sashimi.  Overall, a solid entree, but nothing to exciting for my palate.  As I reviewed the menu nothing really stood out to me as original and quite typical to be honest.    The service is very good here so in the end I guess I'm starting to be more picky with my sushi.  I would definitely come back for drinks and a quick bite though! - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Probably my favorite East Valley teppanyaki spot so far.  Not the most glamorous, however the food is stellar and the service is great.  They don't rush you and the cooks are excellent.  Prices are very reasonable and the sushi menu was pretty good."}
{"text":"One of the best Teppanyaki we have had. Benny was one of the best chef, he made sure the kids had a great time. Next time we go we are definitely asking for him. Next time we are visiting Arizona we will make sure we pay a visit here."}
{"text":"Wife and I sat at the bar.  Kevin was our server.  Thanks Kevin and Dzu.  Loved everything.  Beast roll with soft shell crab was awesome.  We enjoyed the scallop dynamite roll.  The chimichanga roll was tasty and unique.  Great night out.  Love the Sapporo beer as well."}
{"text":"Much better tonight! The Boo yah ka roll was really amazing! Excellent service!  sashimi was kinda on the small side but it was fresh and served beautifully. I'm really glad I gave Ryu another try!   Down side... hoods for Teppanyaki don't actually remove smoke...my eyes are watering and the bad 80s techno music keeps on coming... least they could do is dim the lights so I didn't have to see it..."}
{"text":"Is there a way to give no stars on this thing? Not good. Don't do takeout. If you do, check everything before you leave. Such a frustrating experience. And they actually made me pay (literally) for a mistake... and now I've tried the food. Could not eat the Cali roll. Smelled fishy. Not a good sign. Salmon also not good. Tuna sashimi bad... crazy roll awful... you know what, this was a $70+ way of finding out to stay away from this place."}
{"text":"Incredible food and environment. I always love sushi but am leery of trying new places for it. My roommate recommended this place and I tried it. I was so happy I did, the staff is incredibly friendly and attentive, the sushi bar is so fresh and they will make whatever you want. If you are looking for good sushi or entertaining teppanyaki then this is the place to go. I will defiantly go back!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have been here a couple times and we love it. Great food, fun staff at the cook tables, even our children enjoyed our night out."}
{"text":"I wanted to give this place 5 stars. So....I will give it another try one day.   First, we walked in and we were greeted by no one. Literally....not one person said anything. Multiple people made eye contact. Finally an older women (thinking the owner) came out and sat us.   The waiter was very nice and helpful.   We enjoyed our soup, and my wife said the sushi was not the best she had ever had.   NOW....My food....I started eating my chicken and it seemed a little weird. I spit it out, and it was raw, all of it was still raw. I sent it back and waited for another 10 mins. At this point, everyone had finished eating. They brought it back out.....and it was still RAW!! At this point, I was done. They brought it out again and I just boxed it up.   The flavor and all was good. Just not the experience. Kind of crazy that they did not offer any compensation. I am not want to want free things, but raw chicken is kind of serious. The woman (owner/manager) was very nice, but not once did she apologize, or even acknowledge what happened.   Again, food tasted good. Sushi was ok. Will definitely give them another try....maybe...possibly"}
{"text":"Osaka on Power/Baseline is so much better and  cheaper and they give you FREE sake! This place was not very clean, the waiter sucked and it was pricey, not as much as Benihanna, but pretty close. The lettuce was frozen and watery and the music was loud and awful."}
{"text":"Our favorite teppanyaki in the East Valley. We love the food, the owner is fabulous and when we make reservations we always get seated within 5-10 min."}
{"text":"We stopped in for a late lunch and everything was perfect. Service was excellent and friendly. Sushi rolls were delicious, but the sashimi was beyond expectations. It's been years since I've had salmon that was that good. I'm going to be craving that for awhile! The lunch specials are perfectly both priced and portioned too.  Update: went back for dinner and the rolls were fantastic! Gorgeous ramen. Great service. And the wasabi is better than most places. Excellent quality in everything, which is important in sushi!!"}
{"text":"Amazing. We go every week for the scallop dynamite roll."}
{"text":"Under new management and a remodel! I loved this place before and love it even more now. Sushi and teppan is yum!!! Gotta try it :) very friendly atmosphere :)"}
{"text":"Absolutely our favorite.  Highest grade Sashimi and exceptional presentation.  The Owner, Chefs (especially the Sushi Chefs) and the staff are fabulous!"}
{"text":"My wife and baby daughter came here right at 5pm when they opened. The place was practically empty. They asked if we had reservations, and we said no. The host said that she was going to have large parties coming in later on that evening. She looked in her system and said, \"sorry, we have a few parties coming in about 30-45 minutes.\"  \"Would you like to eat in our regular dining area instead?\" I could not believe what I was hearing. We would be done eating by the time those people came. I'm sure the real reason for them not wanting to sit at the hibachi grill area, was because they didn't want to waste the cooks time with just 2 people and a baby. Thanks for ruining my wife's first Early Mother's Day Dinner!"}
{"text":"We get sushi about every Friday during lent, and wanted something better than Kona Grill and Blue Wasabi. The sushi here is wonderful! Lovers roll was the bomb! The seafood ramen was fantastic too. And don't even get me started on the shrimp fried rice. Awesome quaint place and our waiter, Kevin, was the nicest and coolest person ever! We will definitely be new regulars. Very impressed Ryu!"}
{"text":"Loved this place. Great sushi, nice people, clean. Fair prices and contemporary feel. Definitely a must try for sushi lovers."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a couple times. It's close to home so it's convenient. When you walk in there's regular seating in front of you. Teppan-Yaki grill's to the left and a bar with seating on the right. I don't eat here too much in the summer because the restaurants never cool-AC units seem to be undersized and the heat from the grills is too much for them to keep up so it's usually pretty warm. Just not fun when you're trying to enjoy soon. Teppan-Yaki is decent, sushi is OK-The price is pretty average. The size of the rolls are small in comparison to other places and the taste is average. We've tried so much here and there's nothing that really puts this place over the top. Like I said, it's close so it's convenient."}
{"text":"Best fried rice in the valley!!!! We've had the shrimp and the chicken fried rice and their sushi. I don't think you'll regret anything you order!"}
{"text":"The sushi was great! My favorite roll was the Las Vegas. Definitely a good interpretation of common roll. The service was great and what I believe to be the manager or owner was awesome and very attentive and friendly. A little on the expensive side, but worth it. Oh and the Miso soup was amazing!!"}
{"text":"This place was really great!  I know all Teppanyaki places are very similar, and the \"show\" was typical.  But the food here really was fantastic!  Great fresh veggies and meat!  They also had a sautéed spinach that was part of the meal.  Never seen that before, but it was delicious!  Very reasonable, and large portions.  Their Sake Bombers were also pretty cheap.  Will return for sure!"}
{"text":"Sooo disappointment. In fact, I can't even figure out what people like about this place. The atmosphere looks like an old bar and the water is not filtered.  I don't know how to describe the sushi other than it not being fresh or flavorful. Go else where"}
{"text":"First time visiting Ryu and we were blown away! The Teppan was so delicious! Excellent service with nice friendly staff.   The miso soup was vibrant and delicious. The ginger salad was average... it was bagged iceberg. Nothing special.   Ordered the Gyoza for an appetizer and was not at all disappointed. Homemade dipping sauce had just enough bite.   I ordered the NY Strip with Chilean Sea Bass and everything was cooked perfectly.  The Sea Bass melted in my mouth and popped with flavor. Excellent sear.   Overall dinner was much better than expected and everything was flavorful and delicious. The Sea food options here are the all-stars!"}
{"text":"Don't ever make a reservation at this restaurant! We made a reservation and they seated us and then told us we had to get up because they sat the wrong table. We had been seated for about 15 mins and they rudely told us we had to get back up and go wait again in near the door. Nobody apologized or offered any sort of empathy for what had happened. Everyone waiting for a table was appalled by this behavior. No manager apologized and nobody working cared. We walked out and they didn't even care. Do not make a reservation here if you don't want to wait and be treated terribly."}
{"text":"Got to this place at 5:00 pm on a Saturday which is when they open.  The place fills up pretty quickly if you do teppanyaki.  We had sushi.  The quality of food was pretty good.   Crunch roll:  good but it had a tangy sauce I didn't like.  Next time, spicy tuna roll. California roll:  good, ordered for my daughter Shrimp tempura roll:  very good Tempura vegetables:  greasy and bland.  I won't order that again.  Good atmosphere, attentive staff, moderate prices.  Other menu items look good and I'll go back for another try."}
{"text":"Sushi was okay. Service is a bit slow. Everyone is very friendly but we ordered three rolls and it took 45 minutes. Keep in mind we were one of three couples in the place. It was 1:10 on a Saturday and one couple was done eating. We ordered the rainbow, caterpillar and sour roll. All were decent - not sure they are worth the price but good."}
{"text":"Very good Teppanyaki & Drinks!  We've tried it twice and really enjoyed it.  The service is very friendly, but not necessarily fast."}
{"text":"Seriously awesome! Half the price of any other teppanyaki joint around. Went with my friend for dinner and the chef was really awesome and nice. Had a really engaging experience and the food was fresh and delicious. The waitress forgot that we ordered gyozo but I overlooked that since they really give you you money's worth. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Went there today as my daughter took me there today for my birhtday. My daughter made the mistake of mentioning that she she had a salmon sushi with a sauce at another sushi place. The woman working the floor pointed out the salmon sushi which was 11 or 12 dollars. My daughter wasn't interested. A bit later she came back to us and asked if we want any appetizers. I said I would like some white steamed rice and she smerked at me. I said we also would want some edanmame and. Then we decided to order. We ordered Tina sashimi and a roll. The girl said Ok a tuna sashimi. Your tempura roll and salmon sashimi. I said no not the salmon sashimi but maybe later. She said you order all at same time. Very pushy and nervy. I said no. We are in no hurry. My daughter ordered water as her drink. When they came with a refill it was sprite soda. We just assumed it was a mistake. However, when the bill came we noticed that they charged us for a soda. Some sushi places think they can get away with pressure tactics to increase their bottom line. Problem is, it's glaringly obvious that they know exactly what they are doing, in this case, they are wrong. We won't be back"}
{"text":"The sushi here is very good. The traditional rolls are good. The house rolls are good. My favorite house rolls were the Lovers Roll and the Chimichanga Roll. The squid salad and jalapeño poppers are also very good. I wasn't crazy about the Crazy Roll. If you are looking for a quiet romantic place to dine this is not it. The atmosphere is very inviting to families. The service is also very good. I will return at some point."}
{"text":"Good service. Good prices. The sushi isn't exceptional though. I got the same rolls I get at other sushi places but the flavor was just lacking. The rice was a little dry as well."}
{"text":"Been here at least 3 times. Always had a good sushi experience. Always had friendly service and staff too. One day will go back for some teppenyaki chop chop. It looks fun."}
{"text":"One of the best Sushi places in Gilbert. They have great rolls and semi-decent prices. I believe they got rid of their happy hour on Fridays, so that's a bummer. But they never let you down with their great sushi and always friendly service.   You can never go wrong with the Cali Roll, The Caterpillar, and my favorite...the Tootsie Roll."}
{"text":"Welp...was my first time here/back since new owners took over and then renovated.  Came for a quick bite at dinner. Service great, staff friendly, food good and great prices. Only downside for me is one of the two rolls i got i didnt like at all. Just think it was my taste and was one of those rolls that looks good in the picture but just doesn't taste good. Had two rolls, spicy edamame and a beer for $26. Pretty awesome if you ask me and i will definitely be back and bring friends and family with as well!"}
{"text":"Was here a couple of days ago with my husband and tried several different sushi rolls and the quail eggs.  It was all delicious!  Staff was super friendly and was even going to give us ice for our leftovers if we weren't going straight home.  Will definitely be back to try the teppanyaki side."}
{"text":"We had the sushi so I don't know if the teppanyaki is better.   Overall it was a poor experience.  We ordered 5 or 6 rolls and they were all mediocre.  The rolls fell apart, so much so you couldn't use chop sticks.  The crab tasted like imitation crab meet.    There are plenty of other sushi places so avoid this place if you are craving sushi"}
{"text":"I'll be the first to admit it...I rarely give a place a second chance especially when our first experience has been so poor. However, after seeing more and more positive reviews for the teppanyaki we decided to give RYU one more shot.  We had the calamari and the scallops - both of which were cooked perfectly. The fried rice was great and so where there veggies :)  Our cook also kept us entertained.   We will definitely return for teppanyaki :)"}
{"text":"Roaches! Sat at our table at noon on a Saturday and saw a gigantic roach on our table. No thanks!"}
{"text":"Service was nice but the ramen was just plain bad. It tasted like warmed up beef broth. I didn't get the feeling they spent a lot of time making the core of the ramen which should be the broth. Wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Service was slow but the food was good. The spicy ramen was delicious and I can't wait to go back and try it again. All of the rolls were better than I had expected and I was pretty happy with what we spent in relation to what we were served. We will be going back for the ramen."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar and was greeted with solid staff and good vibes . Unfortunately , the sushi was not very good. The fish did not taste as fresh as well. Would try again.. but it's an L for now ."}
{"text":"Good selection of sushi and rolls The Tepenyaki show is fun..though a little pricey.The staff is friendly and they have the regular Sake bomb drinks which are great."}
{"text":"I have been here twice now (tried to another time, but they were closing between lunch and dinner, I guess), both times have been pretty awesome. We've only had two rolls because I'm allergic to fish, and they have been amazing; the Futomaki and California.   We came for the first time for my boyfriend's birthday and did the Teppanyaki. It was so fun to watch and everyone is super nice. The entree had fried rice, veggies, two pieces of shrimp, and I got chicken, he got steak. You get a good helping of food and the sauces are good too."}
{"text":"Been coming here for nearly 3 years now about twice a month. This is the best teppan in the whole valley I have been to. The service is amazing and we have made some relationships with the people who work here over the years, which we will miss! (We are moving away :( ) very family oriented, good food and times. Do yourself a favor and come here!"}
{"text":"Awesome sushi! Very nice people, very attentive. Good prices on sushi. If I'm ever back in the area, I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"I really enjoy this place. I've come for dinner a couple times, I get sushi. It's been delicious every time. I am very happy with the quality of fish. Haven't had any issues with freshness, even the uni is delicious. Plus they have ranger ipa and santan devil's ale on tap. I had uni, salmon , and salmon roe on my last visit. Plus something callled a ryu roll. It was too awesome that I inhaled it before I could take a picture it was a fried roll topped with chucks of salmon, tuna, avocado, and other delicious stuff."}
{"text":"We've been to this restaurant three times now and three times we've had an exceptional experience. I absolutely love this place. My vegetarian daughter from several options to choose from as well. Some of the roles are very unique and tasted fantastic. I think the best part is the exceptional service. Each time our server has been outstanding and on one occasion the owner, and Asian female, sat down and talked with us extensively about the restaurant and its offerings. She was super super friendly and we thought she was great. This place goes on our regular rotation!"}
{"text":"Very friendly staff. My friend and I went for lunch and to watch the game... I met Andrew, he makes great sushi. I tryed the deep fried bananas split for dessert. Quite Incredible, you must try it. One dessert is enough for two people.   I think I'll go back just for dessert, as soon as I find a date. lol"}
{"text":"We just got back from Ryu Sushi and Teppanyaki, we had a great night there. The service was great! Our server was so sweet and the food was delicious. I recommend the filet mignon. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We stopped in on Saturday to grab some lunch before the world cup started. it was our second visit.  Our first visit was uneventful and nothing special.   This time it was bad. No one greeted us at the door. The waiter eventually saw us and told us to sit anywhere. The restaurant was clean and neat and the service was prompt.   I ordered the chicken teriyaki lunch special. it was served in a bento box. We also ordered three types of rolls and a sashimi combo. Two of the three sushi rolls we ordered came out quickly. The catapillar roll was ridiculous. It was filled with a tiny piece of cucumber and lot of rice then covered with avocado. The menu provides pictures with no detailed description. This roll was an extreme disappointment.  The other two rolls were unremarkable.  The chicken teriyaki was chewy and had zero taste. It was obviously microwaved. It was served third after the two sushi rolls. The third roll and the sashimi combo took much longer to prepare.   One high point was the waiter. He was prompt and attentive. For soup he suggested the mushroom and onion. It was nothing but broth; but exceptionally good. later he indicated it was supposed to have piece's of musroom and onion.   The single star is for the waiter. All in all, not good. We will not be back."}
{"text":"After walking in only 2 tables and a hostess in the phone for almost 10 min and nobody acknowledge I was in front... of her ... decide to walk out . Terrible service ."}
{"text":"Best Sushi in the East Valley.  Great service and sushi is fresh.  We have been here many many times and never disappointed.  We typically eat at the Sushi bar but the Tepanyaki is fun too when with the kids or a larger group.  The calamari steaks are awesome.  Just ask and they will prepare whatever you want!"}
{"text":"This is our go to celebration restaurant. Anniversary, birthday, friends in town or just TGIF we are going to Ryu. My 5 year old boy loves it and eats everything on his plate and loves to talk to the chef while he's cooking. Price is great and the food was quantity and taste is amazing. Even when people want to go out for a steak dinner we recommend Ryu and it's always a hit. Some of the best steak and tuna we've ever had."}
{"text":"I really want to give this place 5 stars, the only problem: WHERE WAS MY WAITRESS?! LoL  Pros: Happy Hour pricing, ambiance, Baked Green Mussels, Yellowtail, Salmon skin Handroll.  Cons: Sticky menus & soy sauce bottles, waitress MIA, dying of thirst...  Anytime I try a new place I ALWAYS order the following:  - Baked Green Mussels (To determine texture & size of mussels & flavor of topping. This gives me a rough idea of how they would prepare other like dishes) - Yellowtail (So I can determine quality of just the fish) - Salmon skin Handroll (many places don't even offer it, barely give you any salmon, the last place I tried over cooked it, amount & size of roll)  All 3 were delicious! Mussel toppings a little on the salty side, but workable. I could taste the light delicate flavor of the rice vinegar in the rice with my Yellowtail.  My greatest happiness: Salmon Skin Handroll. I have looked for so long for a place that makes it to my satisfaction.  My search is over!! - Overflowing with salmon! - Lightly cooked, skin nice & crispy but fish still soft & moist.  - Good size! So many places make it small & skimpy.  This is just part of my review, I need to come back & review the ramen & udon. Until next time!"}
{"text":"Always a great spot for Teppanyaki.  I also really enjoy the sushi here.  I typically get a roll that has spicy crab mix, shrimp tempura and lucky sauce on it, so delicious!  Filet and shrimp is my go to.  Definitely get the fried rice, well worth the up charge.  Great place to bring a group and one of the few places I know that will pair you up if you don't have a group.  Last time I was here it was just me and my little brother, but they were happy to cook for us.  Definitely a great spot and well worth a shot."}
{"text":"Not very impressed. Restaurant seems very popular and was busy. Waitress was kind but not very attentive. She took my water cup and never brought it back. We had to ask someone else to bring me water because we didn't see her. At the end of the meal I finally got some water. Food was ok. I had yakisoba and husband had ramen dish. We both prefer Thai and pho to the ramen dish so we probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Great place to take the kidos for tappenyaki... Took our family here to celebrate our daughter's birthday. The staff was very friendly and attentive. Our kids were entertained and amazed the whole time. Our server was super friendly and made some good recommendation for drinks, sushi, he always carried great conversation, and always smiling. Good food. Great atmosphere. Excellent staff. We look forward to coming back again. Thx Ryu for the extra (3) ice creams for my kids!"}
{"text":"A must try!  Yummy, friendly and affordable. Love, love, LOVE this place. Every single server has been super friendly and the sushi and sashimi is mouthwatering!  The Rainbow Roll never disappoints. I am also impressed with the beer selection. They have a rotation local brew and some classics as well. Didn't care for the spicy tuna roll, but every other thing has been great. My absolute favorite is the salmon sashimi."}
{"text":"Our favorite teppanaki restaurant! We have been coming here since the week they opened. Every time we have a special occasion to celebrate, we go here. The food is delicious, the service is great and the chef Chris is amazing."}
{"text":"Wow! We are not from the area but are here on a house hunting trip. Went with some friends. Arrived at 6:30 and the place was full until after 9 p.m. I had the filet mignon with Chilean sea bass, fantastic! Filet was like chewing on butter and the sea bass was light, delicate and buttery. The entree comes with vegetables, white, fried, or brown rice. A large selection of adult beverages. Very friendly environment and there were kids there too. The Teppanyaki Chef put on quite a show. He even let me stand up there and pretend that I knew what I was doing for a second. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I was very excited to eat here but the whole experience was ruined with the horrible service. After walking in and seeing the bartender look at me, a server look at me (neither of whom said a word to welcome me in) and no hostess/host at the front, I stood there and waited to be greeted. Well, after 10 minutes of standing, with the staff fully aware I walked in, there was still no acknowledgment. They were scheduled to close 40 minutes from when I walked in so all I can think is they didn't want another customer. I was dining alone so it wasn't as if I walked in 40 minutes before closing with a party of 10. Don't waste your time...lots of other sushi options."}
{"text":"Great service, staff and food!  They were very accommodating because of special diet needs. I would definitely recommend giving them a try..I do not think they will disappoint you!"}
{"text":"Their spicy salmon roll is good! It's comparable to Sake Bombers' spicy salmon in my opinion, and sake bombers never leaves me disappointed or not full. Waitress was nice albeit food took a while to come out. Calimari arrived after our main course; waitress apologized and said there was a new chef in training so that's understandable. Nice atmosphere as well and there's the option to have alcohol or teppanyaki."}
{"text":"We moved close to Ryu about two months ago and we could not be happier with the food, the service or the experience.  You can tell that John and the group that manages this restaurant truly care about the experience you have.  The sushi is some of the best I have ever had, which is not something I say lightly.  Having grown up in the bay area, I was exposed to some of the best fish the world has to offer.  Sitting down in Ryu for one of their masterfully created sushi dishes it is hard not to imagine that you aren't in downtown San Fran... They are truly amazing artists.  The Teppanyaki experience is really amazing.  Whether its just for your family or you want to bring in business guests for something unique, you won't be disappointed.  The chefs are masters and your food will be as fresh, succulent as you could ever ask for.  You may have to wait sometimes for a seat, but sometimes the best things come with a little patience..."}
{"text":"So for me and my twins birthday, we decided to come here over Bennihana's because the price was half of that! Same service. The chef cooks in front of you and puts on show. Booked a table for 8 people. The service was extremely slow. We waited 50 minutes after we got there (and the table was reserved at 8) for the chef to come out. No, the place was not understaffed that night. The owner was extremely attentive, very nice, and accommodating. Throughout the time we sat there she was consistently making sure we had drinks and everything was okay. Everything was okay except for the wait time. I'm not gonna lie but we almost left. When the Chef came out he was very unhappy, looked to be pissed off, kept rolling his eyes and making annoyance sounds under his breath, complaining. No we did not have any drinks. He was mad because the waiter accidently gave us an extra small bowl of rice, which we were not charged for, because it was a mistake on them. So because of that SMALL bowl of rice we had to sit there and listen and look at him look down on us. Although everyone at the table tried to ignore it and continue to be happy, it was very hard and the cook's attitude was making a very unpleasant distraction that everyone noticed. He kept looking around for someone as if he wanted them to take his place because he did not want to serve us. In the end everyone tipped except for my brother because of the way we were treated. The rest of us tipped good but only because of the owner NOT the cook. Now that I think of it we should have tipped her instead.  The food was delicious and I wish I wish I would have gotten the guy's name. Through all of this I recommend this place because again the food was good and the owner is amazing but if you sit down to an unhappy cook then please request a new one immediately. I won't be going back because no one else at my table would come with me. I rated this review on customer service and experience, not food taste. Hope this helps. Happy eating"}
{"text":"Horrible. After waiting for over an hour for my Vegas roll, they brought out the worst prepared \"Vegas\" roll I ever seen in my life. It was so ugly but I was hoping maybe it would taste good even though it was falling apart. It was gross, tasted nastier than it looked and also had no rice in it? It was just imitation crab mixed with idk what rolled up in a deep fried strip of shit. The roll tasted like burnt old oil that hadn't been changed in months. There was pieces that were already coming out of the roll without me even touching it. It was the worst place I ever went to and the worst Vegas roll I've ever seen/tried. Still sick to my stomach. Never going back. It wasn't even worth complaining to the server to get another roll I just paid for it and left. I want nothing from their place ever again"}
{"text":"Stopped by Ryu sushi bar for a quick lunch? I ordered gyoza, a shrimp tempura roll and a spicy crab roll.  The gyoza was flavorless and lacked filling. I complained about the seaweed texture and the manager (owner?) stated that I should have ordered some sort of soy product to substitute for the seaweed. The seaweed was tough and chewy.  It seemed to wad up like a piece of chewing gum. I had to spit it out each time I ate a piece of a roll.  I was very disappointed and was not offered a new roll with the so called \"soy\" product or discount on my sushi.  I won't be returning!  I have never experienced this before at any other sushi place!"}
{"text":"Sushi wasn't very good.  They forgot to put in for my daughter's food and didn't bother to checkin with us till we were almost done eating.  I assume they are short staffed.  Service and ambiance are meh.  I assume they don't usually have kids eat there since they didn't bring out crayon set till near the end.  I won't be coming back EVER.   Eastwind Sushi and Grill in Chandler was sooo much better than this and that's a revolving sushi bar."}
{"text":"This is the best spot for sashimi and rolls. You cannot go wrong with the Lovers roll and the Lollipop roll. The cucumber wrap on the lollipop is refreshing on a hot day and the environment is completely laid back. We love coming here for for these two rolls and the small sashimi platter. Yum!  Wanted to update my review to say the Tuna Poke was abso fab! I could not love this place more if I tried!"}
{"text":"Impeccable service, friendly and informative staff, and amazing sushi! Definitely will be returning and recommending to friends coworkers and family. This place rocks!"}
{"text":"Went last night for Father's Day and the chef was on point. Food was delicious. And didn't have any issues with servers. I would definitely come back to this one over Osaka or any other teppanyaki bar in the east valley."}
{"text":"We came on a late Sunday night, so we weren't expecting an extravagant show. We did still sit at a teppenyaki table. Our cook tried to entertain us, but it's hard to do a show with only 2 people. It's cool. We understood! He was a little heavy on the soy sauce, but you can tell, outside of being a little to salty, everything was deliciously cooked. I would say this is by far better than Benihana or Ah-so's! I docked a star because I got a whiff of something nasty smelling while waiting, maybe it's just that Gilbert stench that I'm not used to??"}
{"text":"Always a good time. They treat us like regulars...probably cuz we are. We are here at least once every two weeks and it's great every time. Went for Kobe beef night a couple weeks back...I think you have to experience it once and judge for yourself."}
{"text":"I have been here multiple times and each time the food has been great . It seems this is a family owned establishment.  I keep coming back because the sushi is awesome (:"}
{"text":"Hands down my family's favorite for Teppanyaki and Sushi.  The staff is very friendly and the food and portions are generous.  Prices are fairly priced and service is great.  Only one downside to this place and that is parking.  It is always busy and you might need to walk a little bit.  But hey, the food is well worth it.  My family loves this place!!!"}
{"text":"Very similar to Benihana, where you can sit at a table with other people and have a chef cook in front of you, teppanyaki style. You also have the option to sit at the sushi bar or a standard table with your own party, without a chef. We sat at a table since we were not ordering off the teppanyaki menu.  My boyfriend and I shared the BBQ Salmon Roll, the Golden California Roll, and the Boston Roll. All three were quite appetizing, but my favorite was the BBQ Salmon Roll. It's basically just a Crunchy California Roll with crab mix and salmon, baked in lava sauce. Not really sure what lava sauce is (my guess would be Sriracha, mayo, and some other jazz), but it looked like lava!   The service was fast, though we did eat on the later side so I'm not sure how it is regularly. Either way, I'm a fan of their food and affordable prices. I'm glad this place is located near my friend's house in AZ as I would definitely request this restaurant again next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"I want to give the food five stars but I have to knock off some stars because of the service.  We had a party of 8 and ordered sushi and teppan. Sushi was great. I ordered the sashimi salad and I guess I missed where it said spicy! There were some jalapeños in there that I didn't realize and man were they hot!!!! To the point I couldn't even enjoy the salad anymore. I think I'll stick to the sashimi because the fish tasted great and fresh.  Teppan was fun. Food was Delish. Only problem was the air circulation was horrible. Once teppan was done cooking, stove tops were off, we were all sweating like crazy. It was so hot in there and it made it really hard to enjoy the food.  Next time I will stick to ordering sashimi and maybe even to go. Or just wait until none summer months to go back."}
{"text":"My wife, her sister, and I went to Ryu late one Tuesday night for late night dinner/snacking.  The employees were super nice and seated us right away.  I think there was a party of two at one of the Teppanyaki tables and maybe two or three people at the sushi bar and beyond that, the restaurant was empty... but, like I said, it was late.  We ordered our beverages and soups.  The soups were savory and delicious.  I ordered gyoza and my wife and her sister each ordered soba with chicken.  The soba dishes were overly sweet and not at all what we were expecting, but they were still good.    The gyoza was perfect and exactly what I had expected.  They had mochi on the menu (which I am a huge mochi fan) and tempura fried ice cream.  We were excited and ordered one of each.  The server came back and said that they only had green tea mochi (which I do not like) so I canceled my mochi order.  Then the server came back and said they were out of tempura ice cream as well.  We were disappointed, but, again, it was very late so we understood.  The server was very apologetic about it and everything was fine.  We paid our bill and, as we were leaving, the manager (possibly owner) opened the door for us and apologized again for not having the desserts available.  We will definitely go back to Ryu and, even though there were a few issues, we know how restaurants work and completely understood - we weren't upset with our experience at all."}
{"text":"They food is very good and staff were friendly.  They offered water while I waited for my to go order and checked to make sure I was okay.  The ryu roll came out about 10 minutes before the teriyaki salmon.  The raw fish sat at the hostess counter...might not be the best idea.  Everything was delicious.  I did find some bones in the salmon, so be careful.  My stomach made some funny noises after eating but went away in a few minutes.  Wonder if it was the raw fish sitting out."}
{"text":"We eat here often enough. The food is good but the service can be really terrible. One night we were waiting over 45 minutes to get a chef when two other tables started around us that arrived way later than we did."}
{"text":"Very reasonably priced for happy hour!   We ordered the tootsie roll, philly roll, chili cheese roll, salmon roll spicy tuna, and some edamame. Including drinks everything came out to around $40ish. Not too shabby right? Ok so of course I always have to try the philly roll because that's my favorite. Most places always skimp on the cream cheese or salmon. But no problem here! There were huge chunks of it in there for you to enjoy! The chili cheese roll was different. I liked the sauce, however, it doesn't come with much inside besides a jalapeno. Everything else was mediocre for me.   For drinks I ordered the Asian Sangria. This was good but a bit sour. My friend ordered the Peartini. I felt like this was really bland. I tried it and it had no flavoring whatsoever. However, $3-$4 for a drink, get what u pay for folks!   The service was really good. We were always acknowledged and helped. I'd come back for happy hour if I was in the area."}
{"text":"Kind of found this place by mistake and we are really glad that it happened.   We got there when it opened for lunch and we're greeted right away and served fast. The owner which we believe she came out to say hi to us and explain how she made some minor twists to what she ordered and we were perfectly fine with that.   The first think that came was the poki salad and it was phenomenal the flavor was spot on and for my girl to eat in when it's not to much her thing means that it was amazing. Then the rolls started coming and just as expected after the first item we were not let down, loved the twist of the sour roll with the lemon on top. The only complaint if there is one is that the edamame was to salty.  Other then that this spot will be revisited many times."}
{"text":"this is always our sushi pick!!! Their service is great!!! We got there 20 minutes prior to closing bc we had no clue it closed soon, but they still took care of us with smiley faces! Plus, it's clean! :)"}
{"text":"First time trying this place out, I wasn't too happy with the service.   The food was ok, the waiter forgot my order and I had to remind them.  The food was ok, price not bad at all and that's why I rate 3 stars and not lower.  We had the California Rolls a fish and Fry rice with Chicken."}
{"text":"We bought a restaurant.com certificate to try out the restaurant on 5/27. I tried using it on 6/26 but the waitress said that they do not honor it because restaurant.com should have stopped selling it on 5/23. She finally let me use it after telling her that it is ridiculous and it is not my fault that restaurant.com still sells it.  The service was terrible. We have asked for water refill several times but no one refilled it. We ordered ramen noodle and some sushi. The ramen tasted terrible, even my teenage son complains about it. The sushi was not as tasty either.  I will not recommend this restaurant to anyone."}
{"text":"My wife and I came here for our anniversary,  great food and drinks.  Sashimi was very fresh and Lobster roll is a must."}
{"text":"This is the first time I've been to this place after the change of ownership from the Korean owners to Japanese/Chinese owners and it was good.  I've ordered Uni (Sea Urchin), Monkfish Liver (Ankimo), Chirashi Sushi Bowl, and my friend ordered Teriyaki Chicken luncheon special.  My dishes were beautifully presented starting with Uni freshly order from the fish market (no wasabi nor preserved ginger needed for this dish), Monkfish Liver were decorated with black caviar on top for ($7 2p & $8 3p) respectively with generous serving since most place offer only 2 pieces for $15.  The Chirashi were served on a plate which was a little different (wooden bowl was the norm).  The server were friendly and attentive and told us we got there at a great time since Friday was the day seafood supplier delivered the fish.  They did lost a star from undercooked Chicken Teriyaki which taste rubbery but that is how Japanese way of cooking but my American friend didn't care for due to the rubbery texture since he likes it slight cooked due to Simonella concerns.  Overall, the experience was great and will be gladly return again."}
{"text":"We love coming here!! We have also had two parties here for the last 2 years for my husband. The owner is very accommodating and super friendly! The food is amazing and so worth it.  The guys doing the grill are so fun and make the night exciting!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. The chefs are very experienced and the owners are absolutely committed to make it a great experience - lot's of care.  Much better than the other teppanyaki places around.  Try the filet and Alaskan Roll!"}
{"text":"This place is great and everytime I go there I have excelent service and food! The first time I went, the chef said that that was his first day and we were his first customers at Ryu. That was amazing, because he was probably the best I've seen, and the food was perfectly cooked. Recently, we went back to celebrate my fiancees birthday. We sat down with another family and the chef prepared us some deliciousness with a hint of comedy. It's a comfy atmosphere, fun and relaxed, the bathroom is relatively clean and the staff is very friendly. It's a \"I will certainly come back\", four stars."}
{"text":"Loved it last christmas and back again.  A new family tradition perhaps? Typical fun teppanyaki experience with fun staff"}
{"text":"All I have to say is spend your money on Teppanyaki somewhere else. We had some sushi which was good but the Teppanyaki was terrible. They screwed up our steak and it was way over cooked (we did the table service to be faster, not the full show with dinner). We said it was over cooked and we had asked for rare so the girl just took our plates & came back about 5 min later with our initial rice & veggies which were now very cold and some medium rare steak. The steak was bland and a terrible cut of NY strip. It was incredibly chewy & the rest was just so cold by the time we got it back. I won't be coming back, I'll stick with consistent Benihana."}
{"text":"Hubby and I love this place! When we decided to move to Gilbert last year our first priority was finding a sushi joint in the area. After a few misses we found Ryu, conveniently less than 3 minutes from our house!   The decor is great. Very tasteful and cool, not over the top like a lot of sushi places tend to be.   The owner is seriously the sweetest person the planet. Whenever we come in she comes over and hugs us, asks how my parents are doing (they're snowbirds). She's always happy to recommend things for us to try, and so far we've loved everything she's suggested.   Anyway, onto what you really care about, the food! Their fish is always fresh and the rolls are always tight. I can't stand when my roll falls apart after I dip it in soy sauce! If you like salmon, you MUST try the rainbow trout and salmon belly, they're seriously to die for. We always order a sour roll (without lemon juice as sometimes they put way too much on) and the BBQ salmon roll along with sashimi. We've tried a few of their other rolls, hubby and friends more than me as most of their special rolls are spicy and I don't do spicy. So far everything's been delicious.   Their Teriyaki chicken and salmon is also really good according to my parents.   Our only complaint is that they don't have much in the way of specials or happy hour, so it's a bit expensive. Definitely worth every penny though!"}
{"text":"There are many Japanese restaurant in this area and this one was one of the best. My friend loves Japanese food very much especially Sushi. She recommended me to come this place to have a try. Now I am falling in love with the food here....."}
{"text":"We love RYU!! We come here all the time and have never been disappointed. The kids meal prices seem higher than most, BUT they seem to get the same amount of food as the adult size. The last time we went we brought a friend of my daughters who has  an allergy to gluten, dairy and nuts. They made her meal separate for her and went out of their way to find sauces and dessert she could have!! So classy RYU!!! The only reason I cannot give them 5 stars is because I think their sushi prices are too high and I am bored with the same old tricks done by the cooks. We need variety, more excitement!  Think outside the box. These things will not keep us away though. We love RYU and will always be back."}
{"text":"I love this place!! The owner is always very welcoming. We always order lots of sushi and it comes very promptly no matter how busy they are!  Sushi is fresh and not skimpy at all. Our favorite is the Beast!! So yummy!"}
{"text":"I had purchased a gift certificate on Restaurant.com and knew nothing about this business. I do love sushi and Teppanyaki though and was excited. When I went in to use it, they refused to honor it. We ended up having a terrific meal but the aggravation from the server and the manager was not worth it. I went back to use the gift certificate for take out and was told I could not, that it was only dine-in. Again a big hassle. I talked to the manager and she did not care that I was put out; she did not care that I was trying to patronize the restaurant (albeit in the comfort of my home). Very nasty and they don't care about making new customers or keeping the ones they have. Must be the reason it is so empty the two times I have been there and the reason they are having to discount and advertise on Restaurant.com so heavily."}
{"text":"Service here was terrible. We are a party of 12  celebrating a birthday and our waitress couldn't even offer us a glass of water until we flagged her down and asked for drinks and sushi menus. I mean this is a sushi place right!!!!! Negative experience, the customer service was uncomfortable from the start. Won't recommend this place to anyone nor will I be back here"}
