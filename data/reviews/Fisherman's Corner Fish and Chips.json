{"text":"My first time here, I've been wanting to try this place for years.  The decor is outdated but the food hit the spot!  I had the halibut and fries and they give you the smallest portion of coleslaw which was tasty and leaving me wanting more.  They lady gave us a York Peppermint Patty at the end of our meal which was a perfect ending."}
{"text":"Such a great little gem within a short walk of @Yorkdale. Wonderful food, a very homey feel at a decent price. Sit in of take out... you will be back."}
{"text":"I love fish and chips and I try to find places that are good in quality and price.   Popped in here as well as Katz's Deli just to see what the menu was like.  It is rather old timey and dated but authentic.  Fish was fresh and not frozen bricks and fries were Yukon Gold.  I know because the sacks were in the dining space. Food was a bit squished in the old school cardboard boxes but lots inside and flavour was good. I got the 2 piece haddock with chips @$18.35 which came as 4 smaller pieces and plenty of fries.  The fries could have been crispier but tasty nonetheless.  Batter was good but not better than Seawitch on St. Clair Avenue. The prices were obviously adapted for regulars since they have options for fewer fries, a snack pack, 1&1/2 fish and an all you can eat weekend price.   This would be a fun place to go after a day of shopping at Yorkdale or Orfus Road bargains.  Support independent restaurants! Good alternative to deli sandwiches."}
{"text":"My favourite fish and chip place in the entire city. Their halibut is fresh, and the batter is tasty with just the right crunch and thickness. Prices are reasonable. I like to come here at least once a month for my fish and chip fix - I don't want to waste my calories on any other shop because it won't be as good (I've pretty much tried them all!) I hope this place sticks around forever - I love it!"}
{"text":"Almost every fish and chip place seems to be about the same in decor and style.  This place offers daily deals so it's good on the wallet when you need a filling meal, but short on cash.  The chips are old school - first oil-blanched and then crispy fried to perfect."}
{"text":"Been here twice.. first experience was good .... I got fresh fish and chips. It tasted quite decent.  Second visit.. ordered the same meal. The fish was stiff and bit overcooked... And the fries were soggy and drenched in oil.  Disappointed with the lack on consistency. Maybe it was just my bad luck that they served me such bad food. Will update this review if I visit again."}
{"text":"I'm gonna make this short and sweet. I try to come here every other Friday because they have a halibut special. This is the best fish and chips I've ever had."}
{"text":"Very tasty fish and chips joint!  Very homey!  Very crispy batter!!! Chips are also good!!  Everything aboutthe food is great....  BUT....  i wish they would make there own in house tartar sauce.  I'm sure if they made it, it would be great!!!!!  Will, FOR SURE, come back!!!!"}
{"text":"Everything was just ok, not great.  I feel it deserves 2.5 stars out of 5, but I'm rounding-up and giving the extra 1/2 star based on the fact that I opted for the all-you-can-eat 'white fish' & chips Special, rather than the haddock or halibut, so I chose the low-cost fish, therefore they get the benefit of the doubt.  Now I really have to say that just $9.99 every Saturday and Sunday for all-you-can-eat fish and chips is a surprisingly low price, so I was not surprised that the fish was more batter than fish, described as \"just whitefish\", even when I asked, with no more origin or breed information apparently available.  What I was not prepared-for was, how greasy and crunchy the fish was, (and one of the things I usually like about fish & Chips is that it's greasy and decadent), but this was excessively oily without that moist inner lining to the batter, that I personally enjoy, plus the chips were just \"ok\", which is not okay for a fish and chip shop, in my opinion.  The owner was friendly, the service was good, and the portions were generous, with no reluctance to deliver on the all-you-can-eat concept, and I took full advantage, unfortunately the food was just okay.  I may give them another shot, and try their haddock or a platter with scallops and shrimp, or I may just stick to more reliable locations like St. Andrews or Olde York on Laird."}
{"text":"Fish and chips... why do you do this to me? Despite the fact that I always regret eating it after, I get fish and chips with some regularity. I think my body just doesn't like the sudden influx of deep fried goodness. But my brain does. Oh yes.  I pass by this place a few times a week and decided that it looks so old, and the strip mall is so sketchy, that it HAS to be good. It is. For one thing, the prices are great. They have a $5 take out special every day that is basic whitefish fish and chips. Then they have daily specials that come to a bit less than $10 after tax. We got the take out special and halibut special. The fries are your regular thick cut, kind of soft fish and chip fries. The fish was very good, cooked perfectly with a thick batter.   The lady at the counter was super friendly and mentioned that the lasagna and stuffed peppers are homemade and incredible. I'll have to try the stuffed peppers next time I'm there. At $5, how could I not?"}
{"text":"Cute little shop in a random mall - it was so fresh and homey. The owner/chef/cashier/waiter was a total one man show. it's a no-frills kinda place, with lots of greasy awesomeness. will come back again!  cash and debit only"}
{"text":"We ordered the small fisherman's platter between the two of us. More than enough food! The scallops, shrimp and halibut was very delicious and juicy. Oftentimes, scallops and shrimp are overfried, causing them to be tough and dry, which was not the case at Fisherma's Corner Fish and Chips.   I took one star off because of the chips. I like my chips thinly crispy on the outside and mushy on the inside. I think these were missing the crisp element.   Nonetheless, excellent seafood! Can't wait to come back, I'm craving it."}
{"text":"Solid choice for halibut and chips. Nothing fancy at all but the food is classic.   Friday special is great value"}
{"text":"Driving near Yorkdale, we did a Google search for a Fish & Chip joint....this place popped up. After reading reviews, we decided to give it a go and were stoked thinking we may have found a great fish and chip joint.  Alas, the search continues. Located south of Yorkdale Mall on Dufferin, the restaurant is located in a strip plaza on the east side.  Decor is basic...nothing fancy in this place. Service was good...attentive and friendly. Food...meh...not the best I've had. Halibut was heavily battered and VERYgreasy...perhaps the greasiest I've ever had while dining out. Chips were good...a bit on the over-done side, but there was plenty of them. Fish portion was a decent size vs. price point. Coleslaw (included) was in a vinaigrette dressing.  To me, it tasted as though the oil the fish was fried in needed changing. I'm writing this review a good three hours after dining there and I've got the worst heartburn and can still taste the fish grease in my mouth. So...it's not the worst fish and chip joint I've been to and it's certainly not the best. Total cost for 2 halibut and chips, two Diet Cokes, tax in...just over $32. Debit machine wasn't working the day we were in, although a sign on the cash register clearly said Cash and Debit only."}
{"text":"This place was okay. I'm giving it a 3 but if I could give 3 1/2 I would.  The fish itself was good. Lightly battered which I like. Very greasy tho but what do you expect, it is fish and chips after all lol I got the haddock and my boyfriend got the halibut both were good but the fries was a small portion which was disappointing considering how much it came up to.    I got the Tuesday special which is: 1 piece halibut with fries for $9.95 I added haddock for $6.95 and it came up to $18 just for me and my boyfriend got the Tuesday special as well with 1 piece of added halibut on the side for a whopping $9 his came up to $20 something dollars.   I just thought the price was a little bit crazy.  I may go here again but who knows."}
{"text":"60 years in the biz, and Peter who is currently the owner for the past 25 years seems to factor in the length of dedication with a warm smile.  Yes, the place could go through some much needed renovations, make that the whole plaza in fact, but the history of batter and cooking oil have left their mark on these walls.   I noticed a group of men in their 70s dining in and sensing their comfort in a familiar place justifies the glory days of this place, however fishy it may be for some.   This place is home for the good ol' fish and chips with 'em extra tar tar sauce."}
{"text":"Not that big and fancy inside but the food was amazing. I ordered salmon and chips. The salmon tasted great and it was huge. The chips were delicious. Definitely suggesting this place to friends!  It isn't that busy and the price is reasonable. Would come back again!"}
{"text":"This place is my hidden secret.  4.5/5 actually.   If you  love cheap eats in non fancy restaurants,  this is your spot.  I ordered the halibut- batter is golden yellow light crispy goodness. Only thing is coleslaw isn't the creamy ones.....  And no cheese to make my fries a poutine..  But otherwise the fish is one of the best I've had."}
{"text":"This is a great little place that is close to work and offers some good cheap grub. They have a $5 walk in special that will get you two smaller pieces of fish (down from one larger piece it was before) and more than enough fries.  The decor is nothing fancy so dont be surprised on your first time coming in but the food more than makes up for it. If you are in the area and dont want the typical fast food I highly suggest to try it out."}
