{"text":"We were warmly greeted by Giovanni the owner upon arrival.  He has a lovely Italian accent that is most charming.

The waitress Barbara provided superior service. The lemon pie - both in presentation and taste was fantastic.  Thank you we'll be back."}
{"text":"Given the price and location (in a strip mall with plenty of parking), this is an amazing restaurant. We were there a couple of weeks ago for a birthday party as a group of 10. Service was excellent and prompt and recommendations were well thought out.

The family tried many items on the menu and most were hits, from the lamb to the muscles. I personally had a well balanced mixed greens salad to start and a vegetarian pasta similar to angel hair with roasted peppers as my main. The pasta was truly delicious. Their chocolate mousse cake was also a great treat.

I recommend this place for family gatherings and will go again."}
{"text":"Been coming here for years. My moms favourite restaurant. Blackened Sea Bass is a must. I've also had the veal chop which is great! To start try the warm woolwich goat cheese salad."}
{"text":"I've been here many times since it's my favourite restaurant. Tonight I came here with my bf and his family members because I highly recommend it. But this time really disappointed for their service.

Food- excellent 

Service- our server had terrible service, he was outwardly uncomfortable and impolite. 2 hrs in the restaurant and 1 1/2 hr with empty water glasses. I had to repeatedly ask for water refill. When we ordered dessert, boss gave us dessert for free, but I heard our server and his BOSS had big argument for that! End up server still charge us $60 just for dessert, so PLEASE DOUBLE CHECK your bill before you pay! 

All in all we will never come back here nor will we recommend it to any of our friends. Our server made me so unhappy tonight, hopefully the boss will notice this serious problem!"}
{"text":"RACIAL SEGREGATION AT ITS FINEST!!!!

Our party of 5 went to Tutto Bene for dinner and had arrived early. Around 6 or so. We were one of the first tables there. When you walk in, there's a dining room to the left and one to the right. We were seated in the dining room to the left. 

Midway through our dinner, the dining room became full. And we realized that ALL the tables were asian customers. We just thought, a restaurant in Richmond Hill, just attracted a lot of asian customers. However, I took a trip to the washroom (which was located in the other dining room) and noticed that EVERYONE was either white or black. Not a SINGLE asian customer. 

It was so blatantly obvious that I had to stop and look around just to make sure I was not mistaken. I was definitely not mistaken. The dining room on the right were for NON-ASIAN customers, while the dining room to the left were ALL ASIAN customers. 

WOW!!! Talk about racial segregation at its finest!

What an insult...Would I ever go back? Not after the way we were treated."}
{"text":"Hey reader of reviews...read the review with an open mind. It's a subjective opinion and may not click with your expectations. So hearing what is being said does not mean you must agree. However, critique the restaurant, not the reviewer.

Tutto Bene was an excellent eatery...but my last visit was in 2013...so things may have changed. I hope not because they were an eatery that tried harder !!

     Head chef Kee and pasta prince, Delroy, prepare every menu item perfectly. Tutto Bene has been my \"go to Italian\" restaurant for years because it consistently gives value for the buck. Not just value, but QUALITY. Every meal produced by Kee and/or Delroy is superb. They have their menu down cold, oops, hot...and delicious. My favourite dish is the veal chop, humongous, prime cut, and always properly cooked. I always take the bone home to my dog, Fermo, but it has been picked clean already!
     Pick any pasta...perfect. Fish, oh yesh !! Pizza, indeedsa ! Wine list to satisfy the pickiest but stick with the house red, 1/2 or full litre, terrific. Salads, scrumptious. Appetizers, desserts...just ask. Whatever they have prepared for that period of time, is smack on ! 
    Food...FIVE STAR, unequivocally. 
    Service, as good as anywhere in Tor
, cycling themselves as hosts for lunch or dinner, authentic Italians dedicated to satisfying their clients, and they do.
    Having a special celebration, the osteria has a smaller private dining area, ideal for large group celebrations which may want to be away from the general dining room.
    Reservations are a must as at this family friendly eatery is jammed, every night, for the usual supper hour between 7 and 8, every night!!! Closed Sundays.
   Pricing is in line with any restaurant of this calibre, not inexpensive, but not expensive. This means, expect to pay about $40 per person for appetizer, main and dessert. Even with wine, breaking $50 per person is a push. The short of it is, this restaurant will exceed your expectations for quality, excellent food, prepared well and served properly.
    It would be a real challenge to find an Italian restaurant superior to Tutto Bene. Buon appetito !"}
{"text":"If you have eating restrictions, avoid this place.

The so so: The food is decent. The prices are steep ($17 for a vegetarian pasta). The decor isn't fancy, but the restaurant is clean. The location is in a strip mall.

The bad: Two members of our party had eating restrictions (no dairy). Two members of our party requested modifications. The modifications were relatively simple (i.e. please remove the cheese which is added at the last minute and please do not serve the side dish which contains dairy). Neither of these modifications required modifying the preparations.  Both dishes were served as reported in the menu, ignoring requested modifications. When asked to fix the dish, the dairy was simply removed from the top (note that the cheese had melted already, which was not fixed). No attempt was made to remake the dish, no apologies made. This is not a place that is willing or capable of making any modifications, even simple ones."}
{"text":"Recommend:
Veal chop , whole fish, great thin crust pizza and must try sea trio for appetizer!"}
{"text":"I really like this place. 
It can be intimate or loud.
Tutto Bene is a really nice family style italian restaurant. 
We always have the lobster bisque, beef and tuna carpaccio, veal chop and blacken sea bass with a tartuffo to finish. 
Service is usually quite good with knowledgable staff. 
They have a wonderful wine selection that would suite any palette. 
Whether you're with friends or family or on a date this is a great place to go."}
{"text":"Great restaurant and food but the portions are way too small for the amount you are paying. Approximately 27-30 for an entree that is the size of a small dinner plate. 

Food was above average but not amazing. It's just another expensive bit above standard italian restaurant. 

There are many alternatives which are better. Also the restaurant is extremely crowded as it is a small venue. I had bumped elbows with a gentleman seated at a table beside mine."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem.  It's in this unflattering plaza and if you don't know it's there you likely won't notice it.  But this place has passed the test of time.  It's got old school Italian waiters and chefs, but they still continue to change their menu to meet the season and avoid the monotony of places like the Octagon.  One of the few places around the area that you can get a decent fish dish.  Has a small patio and nice decor."}
{"text":"This restaurant has very good food. Everything I order tastes really good. Especially the fish and spaghetti. The service is very good. Well manner from the time I walked in and walked out. Really recommend this restaurant and definitely will be back very soon."}
{"text":"On a weekday, it was almost full house, it's a small restaurant with tables packed very close together, with very homey decor.

Tables are a bit too closed together, but it's a small place, they try to place as much in there as possible.

The service was OK, nice and all but a bit impersonal, But I'm here to eat and for the food.

everyone at almost every table orders lobster bisque (daily special, not on menu, there's no price on it, didn't find out the price till the bill came $10) But it was extremely salty, a few tiny tiny pieces of lobster (or whatever it is) imagine minced beef but instead it's minced lobster.

My partner got the veal chop, it looked very nice and big, but it because the bone was huge, and the meat that was too close to the bone can not come off, so there was very little meat. and it's a bit on the tough side (medium rare) the mashed potatoes & asparagus was ok.

I ordered the beef lasagna, off the daily specials menu, and it was so disappointing, it came in a personal size casserole dish (oval shaped) however it was extremely oily, and salty, I started from the side and made my way to the middle, the sides has no beef or cheese, all the cheese and beef (very little beef) was all in the middle. It was a horrible lasagna, I can make better at home, and I'm no cook. 

The best part was dessert, the tiramisu cake, it was nice and homemade (but a bit too watery) I've had better. but it wasn't too sweet, which was good, and i was able to finish the whole thing.

oh and this place can get VERY loud, cause it's in a small confined space with a lot of people. And if half the tables in there was laughing, it could get scary."}
{"text":"We had good meals here in the past, recently returned and was less than impressed. I had the gnocchi and they were blobs of dough with a heavy bolognese sauce, others had the Rigatoni Porchini was gritty to the point my son didn't want to scarpet (dunk bread to pick up remaining sauce). The highlight of my dinner was the polenta under the Quail appetizer (the quail was a very strong gamy flavour)
My impression; Apps and pasta dishes were  expensive based on comparable options, however the place was busy."}
{"text":"ooooh YUM! super delicous food here - I love the rustic atmosphere that is not expected from a strip mall restaurant!

The restaurant is cozy and quaint with FRESH food - I feel like I'm eating at a little restaurant in Tuscany!

Perfect for romantic or special occasions - wouldn't recommend for big groups, but great for dinner out with a few friends on the north side.

Convenient parking makes it attractive too!"}
{"text":"Cozy family style Italian restaurant that's been in the neighborhood for a very long time. Packed during dinner time when we went and lots of tables with the reserved sign, so nts make a reservation next time! Service was great -  attentive, efficient and friendly. 

We got a beef carpaccio arugula salad to share. We each got a pasta dish, one grilled shrimp spaghetti and a seafood marinara linguini. Both were delicious with a good amount of seafood (they don't cheap out). The  seafood such as the grilled shrimp were big portions and tasted fresh.

Their menu is on the pricier side but lots of options and great quality food. They have a tasting menu where you can try bit of many dishes, but I think that needs to be pre-ordered/rsvp."}
{"text":"Speed Read:
1) Blackened Sea Bass - Highlight!!
2) Chef Menu: Sesame crusted tuna, Risotto, Fois Gras, Roasted and Slow Cooked Duck - All food taste great
3) Service - Excellent
4) 5 stars - good service, great food, reasonable price.

As highlighted by other yelpers here, the blackened bass is the highlight.  Rich (fatty) sea bass, cooked to just the right tenderness.  It's multidimensional flavorful, it's probably cooked with fruit and vegetables to give it that flavor.

Another one to mention is the mushroom risotto with truffles.  Mushroom risotto is not hard to cook, but they do it right.  Risotto is done to Al Dente, rich taste and aroma (truffle did the trick).

The duck is serve in one dish, but it is prepare in 2 difference ways.  Where the duck breast is roasted, and the quarter duck is slow cooked.  

We have the chef menu, so the portion size are smaller than a typically entrée.  This allows us to try different dishes before getting full.

Thank you for reading it this far, here are some tips.
1) Call ahead (few days) if you want chef menu.
2) Ask for their wine recommendation, the Italian wine they recommended is amazingly good with reasonable price."}
{"text":"What a big let down. Service was great, but food was horrible. Ordered a vegetable pizza with pear and goat cheese. This was the most tasteless pizza I have ever had! My wife ordered a steak. The meat was tough and full of fat and sinew, she barely managed to eat much of it. Potatoes tastes reheated and not fresh. For a $36, I would expect a decent cut! Have no desire to ever return.  Food is one star, but server tried really hard and setting decent, so extra star for that."}
{"text":"Authentically Italian-owned restaurant, but the chefs are all Indian (we sat right next to the kitchen). Came here for a friend's birthday - they wanted to be a little classier. Food was okay (I had the mussels in a tomato fennel broth), service is a hit and miss, especially if you come during a busy time (like we did on a Saturday night). Price-wise it's similar to other moderate fine-dining establishments, not my usual watering holes."}
{"text":"Came on a weeknight and it was a full house. This is family owned and gives a warm feeling in the restaurant. I ordered a beef lasagna and creame brûlée . The dessert was sooo good. So creamy with a touch a nice aroma. The beef lasagna was good, nothing too special. 

2nd time here and will be back as the owner is very friendly.

The house wine was also not bad."}
{"text":"Lobster bisque to start was not bad.. not as thick as I would've liked, but flavour was there.  The breads were delicious, and had the seafood special of the day with three kinds of fish.  I remember enjoying one of the fish a lot.. the mackerel I think?  The linguine my coworker had looked great, portions are really big here for the pastas.  This is supposedly our client's fave Italian resto in the area but I was a bit let down."}
{"text":"It's an ok place. A bit expensive for what u get but the food is never terrible. Nothing very creative and nothing stands out. But probably won't be disappointed by anything either."}
{"text":"I've been here multiple times since it's my mom favorite restaurant, but I am Not much of a fan. Maybe it's because of the bad experience I had there. The service is amazing and so are there chefs always accommodating for your preference. I had lasagna and honestly I didn't like it one bit. Horrible and weird flavor to it which I believed was nutmeg which went bad with everything on the plate. I switched to grilled seafood and it was good you can't go wrong with that. Next time I go I'll have to try something else on their menu-which isn't extensive by the way."}
{"text":"This place has great Italian food.
Had the Lobster Bisque, and it was quite nice. It kept getting better as I consumed it.
I was also lucky enough to try from three of the pasta dishes. I got the spinach gnocchi with meat sauce, and it was freshly made and yummy. The other special pasta dish was the agnolotti with smoked salmon, and this one had by far the best sauce. I was a little jealous I didn't order it myself, but was happy I got to have from it.

We were able to get trays to sample all the desserts. Not sure if they typically do this, or if it was just because we were a big group. But the lemon meringue and chocolate mousse were my favs.

I would definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Very unassuming place from the outside, simple décor inside, food though was superb, service was satisfactory. Went here with friends, with at least a couple guys having come here many times so it was well recommended. Did not disappoint. For the app we had the Carpaccio which came with aged parmigiano cheese, interesting combo, liked it a lot. For the main I had the spaghettini with grilled shrimp, perfect al dente pasta with 4/5 large juicy butterfly shrimp, tomato garlic sauce was delicious (this dish is currently one of the pictures on front page of the website). One of the guys (new to the restaurant) had the sea bass, which looked amazing and he said it was one of the best seasoned pieces of fish he had every tasted. From that I assume it was good ... haha. For desert I had the lemon meringue pie and also tasted the creme caramel, not big servings, I am not a big desert person and think in terms of whether it is worth the calories, portion size here and quality was, good end to the meal. Atmosphere had a family feel to it with lots of repeat customers, although not sure how good I am at gauging \"repeat\" customers. Service was slightly distracted, like they were on auto-pilot, maybe because it was late, I did not read too much into it. Highly recommended and would definitely visit here again when in that neighborhood"}
{"text":"Pretty average, find-it-anywhere Italian food. Everything is decent, but nothings stands out, so I definitely will not return. 
Didn't find the decor particularly charming and the overall atmosphere was of an average neighborhood diner. Their wines by the glass list is quite poor, so if you are a wine enthusiast, this is not your kind of establishment."}
{"text":"I've got to say, Tutto Bene is a real hidden gem and one of my favourite Italian restaurants to go to. Every time that I go I'm met by the owner (who knows my family and I by name) who graciously seats us. Tutto normally has anywhere between three and seven specials all of which, when spoken out load, sound even more incredible than when read merely off of paper.

I have never had a bad meal here, every time that I go I am always met with exactly what I was hoping for. MIf I had to narrow it down to one meal though, it would be the pizza. Fresh basil hits your nose, roasted garlic, house-rubbed chicken, simply delicious. And in my always continuing pursuit to tack on mass, I'm big on portions. I enjoy a healthy amount of food and in this category, Tutto does't disappoint. The pizzas are filling and the pasta dishes are BIG. Plenty of food for anyone with a good appetite, and if you're a light eater you'll be heading home with lunch for the next day.

They have an excellent selection of wines as well. The staff have even been known to open bottles for us that aren't featured on the menu, but don't tell anyone! They only have three or four beers, but that's no matter. If you're there you should be getting a nice glass/bottle of wine anyways!

It's a small place and it's easy to miss when driving by. It looks rather small from outside (and in all honesty it is relatively small) but it is always busy and always delicious. I would highly recommend if you are in the area and looking for some EXCELLENT food, check out Tutto Bene."}
{"text":"This local Italian eatery in a nondescript strip mall has been here for years and years. Several of the owners still actively work the place, and are friendly, efficient, and welcoming. It's not a large place, so can get a bit noisy when its' busy, which it often is, especially for dinner. Food is consistently good, if a tad standard, but it remains the go-to place for locals. While it won't blow you away, you'll always walk out satisfied with the experience"}
{"text":"How I ended up at Tutto Bene? I don't really know...

Canada Day last minute dinner plan with my Yelp Friend and Hot Yoga Date was not easy..as the challenge is finding a place that is open, decent and none of us been to and have food that all of us enjoy.

Italian restaurant is always a safe bet if you go out with a vegetarian as there are always even choices of pasta and vegetarian and cheese at least you don't feel too deprived with the lack of meat.

Grilled Melody of  Seafood: Shrimp, Scallop. Calamari in Bouillabaise Broth ($12.95) of course was not a vegetarian choice but the seafood was fresh and the broth just seasoned perfectly.

Riagatoni with Porcini and Portovello Mushrooms in Roasted Garlic Tomato Sauce $16.95 was decent, pasta cooked al dente. However, Tutto Bene believes in portion control, I need more!!

Pizza with Sweet Basil Pesto, Grilled veggies, ripe pear and goat cheese ($14.95) was a little disappointed... hardly any pesto sauce on the pizza itself and where was the pear?? The pizza itself was a tad dry...

Services though is quick, but our server was a little impersonal... and I hate when wait staff trying to push me to order more food...

The atmosphere at Tutto Bene can be a little loud... however, I think that fit me perfectly because I did get loud after half a glass of Pinot Grigio!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is a pleasant surprise in a small strip mall.  Their pasta are excellent and with good portion.  Their pizza are all made from a stone oven.  Other than the regular Italian items, they also served special entree such as lamb shank risotto and calf liver.  They are both very outstanding dishes with very tasty sauces.  The restaurant is always pack, it is better to call in early fir reservation."}
{"text":"My boyfriend made a reservation here for my birthday and neither of us had been before. When we arrived, we stood in the entryway for 10 minutes while people continuously walked past us without acknowledging our presence. After 10 minutes, a group of 4 came in - the owner of the restaurant went right to them and say this party before greeting us. THEN, a party of 2 came in and the owner completely ignored us and walked straight over to the party of 2 that just entered. Trying to keep my cool, I interrupted him and said \"excuse me. We've been waiting and have a reservation.\" To which the owner was completely patronizing and rude to me. He's lucky I didn't walk out. 

Once we were seated, everything was great, though the restaurant was very squishy - we felt as though we were basically sharing a table with the people next to us, that's how close together we were. 

When we were ready to go, the owner approached us and was once again completely patronizing to me. 

Though the food was great and our server was funny and very good at what he does, we will NEVER return here due to the owner."}
{"text":"I have been eating at tuttos for years. if you're looking for good authentic Italian food good service and a nice atmosphere there's no better place. It's not a huge place and it gets very busy on the weekends so if you're going make a reservation."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Tutto Bene.  It's my favourite Italian restaurant in the GTA to date.

I first came here at the recommendation of my aunt, who was an expat at the time.  She highly recommended the blackened seabass.  It's very good, but my ultimate favourite dish is the seafood linguini.  

BEST SEAFOOD LINGUINI EVER.

That it contains good ingredients is a given, but the one thing that really sets it apart is the fact that the fish (cod?) oil is infused into the sauce.  It's incredible.  I mean, not very many restaurants include cod in their seafood dishes, first of all.  But Tutto Bene also allows the cod to simmer in the sauce for some time, so that the cod (and other seafood) flavours totally meld into the light tomato sauce (which is tasty and not too acidic) - it is just divine.  If you go with someone who orders a different pasta dish that also contains tomato sauce and you taste their dish before yours, you can really taste the difference.  It's amazing.  I also like that the pasta is perfectly al dente.

The smoked salmon salad is also delicious - it comes in this delicious maple dressing that's just lightly drizzled on top.  So restrained and so perfectly paired.

I also love their mussels as an appetizer.

Dessert-wise, I usually get the chocolate-raspberry tartufo or the house-made tiramisu.  I'm not sure that the tartufo is house-made - I've never asked - but it's good because the chocolate is potent!  The tiramisu is always reliably good.

Service is also dependably good.  The decor is also really cozy and nice, with the open kitchen and old world charm.

This is an excellent place for date nights, and I highly recommend it!"}
