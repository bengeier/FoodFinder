{"text":"What a great new restaurant! Lots of vegetarian options. All the dishes we tried tasted great and the service was phenomenal! Don't miss the desert!"}
{"text":"A nice surprise for lunch. Hot & Sour Soup, Pad Thai and Satay Salad all good, split between two of us. Enjoyed our conversation with the owner."}
{"text":"Best Thai Food we have EVER had, including downtown Cleveland, Tremont, and nationally.  In fact, the family that dined with us during the first two weeks of opening felt that Thon Buri's food was hands down better than anything they had when visiting Thailand for two months.  Service is very friendly. The young wait staff work very hard and it is obvious they wish to please.  We have tried most everything on the menu. From the Panang Curry to the Pad Thai, to the apps and desserts- everything is perfectly flavored, FRESH and HOT!  Salmon and Shrimp are high quality and abundant!  We will continue to regularly frequent Thon Buri -this restaurant has raised the bar of what one should expect in a neighborhood restaurant. Thanks, Thon Buri!"}
{"text":"Tried this place last night for the first time with my wife. Best Thai food I have had in Cleveland. The Pad Thai and Curry were exceptional!  This is a simple place that does really good authentic food."}
{"text":"Wow. This is my new favorite Thai place. The people who work there are so gracious and really like what they do. The flavor in my dish was spectacular. My girlfriend loved the Tom Yum soup and the Chicken Red Curry. I had the Pad Kee Mao (Crazy Noodles). Best flavor I've had in in a while. If you are looking for a simple, quick date with some delicious Thai food and wonderful service, you need to try it."}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time and it was nothing short of amazing. Had the pad Thai and it was delicious and crab Rangoon to die for! Owned by a lovely family that is making Bainbridge even better. Cleveland people should definitely come this way if craving Thai."}
{"text":"Delicious! The Ka-Pow shrimp was about the best thing I've ever eaten. Been there several times and the food is always great!"}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor and try the awesome non-curry dishes (which are also excellent).  My new favorites are Bangkok Noodle Soup and Spicy Beef Salad.  Awesome alternatives.

Also, please spread the word about this gem!  We want this place to succeed!"}
{"text":"I order the Vegetable Pad Thai and ask for tofu to be added and it always tastes amazing! They're always very nice about adding ingredients to your dish (or taking things out that you don't want) The curry dishes and spring rolls are also really flavorful. The people that work there are all very friendly. Great place for take out!"}
{"text":"Delicious Thai food! Had Thon Buri pad Thai and it was wonderful! Husband had Tom yum soup and loved it! Great to have a local Thai restaurant!"}
{"text":"Great little place. Been here a handful of times. Service and food get two thumbs up."}
{"text":"Great food and great service. Their classic Pad Thai is well seasoned and not spicy at all. (Although mildly spicy and very spicy are also options on their menu, if that's what you like). They serve perfect size portions. Will definitely go back to this place!"}
{"text":"Really fresh and delicious. 

Started with the vegetable spring rolls, then the vegetable pad thai. 

It's unfortunate that this restaurant is in a \"strip\" of businesses; I live nearby and didn't know until today that it's here. 

The interior is modest and simple, but the food is great!"}
{"text":"Came for the Greek restaurant that went out of business and stayed for the Thai.  This is a hidden gem.  The service was impeccable. The interior is clean and fresh but, very small,  The day we arrived it was hopping.  Regardless that they were so busy, our appetizer arrived before we could make a decision on our entree.  We chose the  vegetable and Thon Buri pad Thai and again on the table with shocking speed, piping hot and OH OH OH so delicious.  What a great place!"}
{"text":"Went here last week and got carry out. Big draw for me was the bubble tea as nobody seems to ever have this in the Chagrin Area. The good was good and the tea was good as well. Is it amazing, not sure . Would I eat here again- yes. They are new and I am sure once they iron out kinks they will
Be great."}
{"text":"So excited to have Thai in Bainbridge!!  

Shrimp in a basket and beef satay was great!!
I was disappointed they don't make yellow curry but the Massaman Curry more than made up for that.  It was so delicious, tiny bit of spice and a rich pea-nutty taste.  

We also tried the shrimp pad Thai and beef pad see-ew - both were also delicious.   

My daughter had the strawberry bubble tea.  I prefer the tea but they served it frozen which I didn't love.  

For dessert we had sticky rice with one scoop of green tea, one scoop of mango and one scoop of vanilla ice cream.   Must try if you've never had this dessert before 


We will be back!!!"}
{"text":"Don't order the Pho. The meat doesn't seem to be cooked per order because it was tough. Good service. Meh for my Pho. But will try it again because everyone loves the food here."}
{"text":"A newcomer to the CLE/Bainbridge dining scene which frankly was in need of quality asian cuisine.  Get past the strip center appearance and your first impression upon walking in the restaurant and you will be pleasantly surprised.  

It is clean but about as plain as it can gets.  Plus, there is an eyesore straight ahead as coolers cover the back wall and frankly their fans are annoying.  Some background music would help.  So dining in albeit acceptable may not be my first choice going forward.

However, the food is excellent.  Literally crave worthy as we \"took out\" the following night.  The quality of ingredients is spot on but the taste is what keeps you.  The food is worth making this a regular stop if you live in the Chagrin Falls zip.  

Would I drive all the way out if Im in downtown traveling to CLE?  Likely not as we do have a wide array of asian cuisine downtown.  But if your in the beachwood/orange/solon zips, make the trek."}
{"text":"1st time but not the last. We both really liked our chicken Ka-Pao and our apps. Did take out with quick service and nice people. We will be back."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious!  We are from out of the area and decided to try it from the Yelp reviews. We had appetizers of chicken spring rolls, bar-b-q wings and another appetizer that I can't remember the name. When are meals came, red curry chicken and rice, garlic sauce with chicken and a green curry with chicken. It looked so good I forgot to take pictures!  The food was wonderful and our server Laura, was excellent. If you like Thai food I highly recommend this gem!"}
{"text":"The curry dishes are fantastic! Pad Thai is great as well, all around awesome food. Looking forward to trying more!"}
{"text":"Terrific food, terrific service. The folks who run Thon Buri are keen on ensuring you have a great experience."}
{"text":"Found this on a Yelp search and wanted to try a different Thai restaurant since the one more local to me feels somewhat \"Americanized\".  

Service is top notch!  Feels like the spirit of Thailand.  We felt welcomed and attended to.  Waiter was happy to explain parts of the menu. Even though the decor is lacking, the service made the dining experience worthwhile.  

I had the cashew chicken, it was very good.   Glad to have more food options in this area.   Use Google maps to get to this place as i hear the directions via Yelp are not accurate.  Go here if you like Thai food. I'll certainly be going back."}
{"text":"Delicious food and fast service. The decor is very sweet and the staff are very polite and accommodating. A new gem in Bainbridge!"}
{"text":"Amazing meal. Great service! 

Didn't know that this amazing spot was here!   So happy to have walked in and experienced the best Thai food I have ever had.  Best surprise in chagrin!"}
{"text":"After reading the many great reviews, I had high hopes for this place.  It was clean, but lacked any atmosphere.  Tom yam soup was tasty but terriaki salmon was flavorless.  Unlike the great photos posted by others, the food presentation was uninspiring. Service was poor, with side dishes arriving 10-15 minutes after entrees."}
{"text":"This is probably the BEST Thai food in Cleveland!  I highly highly highly recommend this place. Pearl and Chomooh (owners) are quite possibly the sweetest ladies around. Their food is AUTHENTIC and DELICIOUS!! They will alter anything on the menu to accommodate food allergies. Truly a hidden gem!"}
{"text":"We got food as takeout. It was not very good. The brown and white rice were totally mushy. We ordered a salmon dish. The salmon was cubed, batter dipped and fried, which was really weird. We thought it was tofu at first, it was so unrecognizable as fish. We ordered a beef curry and the beef was really chewy and bland as though the beef had been boiled separately and added to the curry. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"My son and I have had carry out twice from here. Everything taste extremely fresh and delicious. The Pad See-Ew, and the Thon Buri Pad Thai (spicy,) are fantastic. Only criticism, a little too oily. I'm looking forward to trying other dishes."}
{"text":"Visited during lunch hour with three colleagues and we all agreed that the service was great and the food very good.  We shared beef satay that was cooked perfectly with peanut sauce and a vinegar and vegetable relish.  Individually we had the beef green curry, chicken mango curry, chicken massaman curry, and chicken teriyaki.  All were delicious.  My water glass was never made it to being half full b/c the server was really on top of things.  Will definitely head back for dinner sometime soon."}
{"text":"My wife and I got takeout from here tonight. I got the Kung Pao which didn't have much flavor. The Pad Thai noodles were over cooked and bland. Not sure if the chef was scarred of seasoning tonight. Best part of the meal was the fresh rolls. Not sure what the hype is about maybe it was just a bad experience."}
{"text":"Great Thai flavors! The main downside is that while the flavors are authentic, they are not nearly spicy enough. Even their \"Thai spicy\" level of heat that holds a warning barely registered as a level 1 in Thailand. I actually had to ask for extra chilis after tasting it. The portions at lunch are the same as at dinner but at a slight discount. I may have to get takeout for lunch sometime!  I'll just be sure to ask for the extra chilis when I order"}
{"text":"Very good red curry shrimp, pad thai \"not heavy\" like some other restaurants.  Massaman curry dish also excellent.  Good service and reasonable cost."}
{"text":"We were in town visiting family and tried Thon Buri Thai based on the reviews.  The food was good but they only filled the rice containers half way, so for the price I expected to have the rice container full.  There wasn't enough rice for the amount of sauce.  We got four things and the price was $50.  The food was good but not THAT good."}
{"text":"Finally! A great Thai restaurant in Chagrin/Bainbridge! The food is fresh and very good. Try the Fresh Rolls as an appetizer. The Panang Curry is among the best I've ever had. They have a dining room or a takeout option. I am over the moon to have this place so close!"}
{"text":"Best Thai food in Cleveland. Try the Beef Satay and the Panang Curry. You won't be disappointed. It's wonderful. The dining room is small but comfortable and they have a wide assortment of bubble teas as well as Thai iced tea. It's a must try if you are in the East Side suburbs."}
{"text":"First time take out, Basil fried rice was delicious! Also had chicken teriyaki, huge pieces of white meat was also good. Try this place out!"}
{"text":"The food is very good here. I have eaten here twice and the first time the food had more taste, tonight was a little off. The Massaman had no potato which does add flavor and the Beef Pad See-Ew was better last time as well. My waitress and I both forgot to ask about spice level which also played a part in not having more flavor. While we were there the kitchen burned something and my clothes smelled when I got home. I am sure the chef just had a bad day. I still recommend this place and tonight really was 3 star but last time it was a 4 star. 
I will still go back."}
{"text":"This place is very good for the area. I will definitely go back when I'm in Chagrin. As a comparison, I live downtown and frequent China town or Tremont for Asian, Thai food. Thon Buri is just as good. They have a couple items on the menu I am not sure about though - a thai hamburger and roti style tacos. We were tempted to try but played it safe with the Thai food. They have a couple of Thai items on the menu that I've not seen elsewhere. Definitely, check it out!"}
{"text":"Food is really delicious and consistent, friendly service, and quick. Food presentation is excellent! Highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"So fresh and yummy, I had shrimp basil rice, husband had gReen squid curry. Both tasted fresh and had excellent flavor balance! We shared the mango sticky rice, and it was delicious as well."}
{"text":"We visited during the week at an off hour and so there were only two other tables seated besides us.  Server gave us excellent descriptions and recommendations for drinks.  I got the thai iced tea and my husband got bubble tea.  We've had these before at other places, but none like these!  So unbelievably fresh and tasty!  Despite telling myself, I wasn't going to (yet again) order Pad Thai, I couldn't resist and ordered it anyway.  Oh my!  I have never tasted that dish the way it should have always tasted!  The presentation was flawless but the taste was out of this world!  My husband ordered a tofu signature dish (the name escapes me) and he was also extremely pleased.  I practically had to stop him from licking the plate!  I would definetly recommend this place to anyone who loves and appreciates great Thai food!  Only recommendation might be some decor on the walls or some plants.  Don't be deterred by its location, it's worth visiting over and over"}
{"text":"The food here is pretty good and I wonder why Yelp did not show this restaurant when I searched for a dinner place close to Chagrin Falls area. This restaurant showed up in the Ads section and that's how I landed here. I am here to say I was NOT disappointed at all since this place is in the area. 

The food was really good & the waitress was very considerate and gave us a full attention. I would definitely recommend you to try if you like Thai cuisine like I do."}
{"text":"I love the food and the people. I am on a low sodium diet so they are able to make me a special low sodium Green Curry with chicken. It is fabulous.  We have taken several different people there all with high praise for the food. Our new favorite place."}
{"text":"ALERT! Bonafide strip small secret. When I found this place on my Yelp app, no one was more surprised then me that it was in a strip small. I almost wish it wasn't, because it has so much character, so I hope it doesn't get overlooked. But so often, the best places have unassuming exteriors. The interior, however, is really endearing. The restaurant has bright colors, cute seating, and darling little flowers on every table. If you love Thai food... this place will not disappoint. This place felt so authentic, the staff was super caring, and they seem to have their place down to a science. Our server was helpful and walked us through the menu with all her favorite items.

Loves:
+ Bubble tea! BUBBLE TEA! Good bubble tea.
+ Beautifully plated dishes. Seriously. Just look at the pics.
+ Super fast. Like, lightening fast service.
+ Huge menu and everything seemed delicious. 
+ They like Yelp (I wish I could give them 6 stars just for that!)

We had the fresh rolls, the mango curry and the pad thai. The fresh rolls had an awesome rich brown sauce with them and the mango curry was fresh and bursting with flavor. Literally, by the time we got through a couple of bites of our entrees, we were already pretty full. Overall: i'll totally be back to Thon Buri. I think this place is legit."}
{"text":"Tonight was my second time eating there, I got take out the first time. The food was AMAZING.  I ordered Panang curry and asked for the tofu on the crispy side and they did it perfectly...just how I like it. Service was friendly and fast. Just the right amount of food too...not too much...not too little."}
{"text":"OK! Let me eat my words, because I went back and was happy. So I think it's important to distinguish that the takeout did not reflect sitting and eating experience. So to be clear: I would go here to eat, I would not get takeout.

They do not seem formally trained as servers, which is fine. As long as you're nice and helpful that's all the matters to me. We were asking a bunch of questions about all the different types of curry, and so the server so kindly brought out a sampling of all four! So sweet, so we could pick definitely a curry we would like.

Do I think this place is the best? No, but it is probably in my top three... I mean, that makes it far from last place in terms of CLE Thai food availability. It is a good option for this locale and adds some nice diversity to the cuisine in the area."}
{"text":"2nd time here. Tonight mango fried rice with chicken and Thai rice soup. Both were great. Last time I had the pad Thai, also great. Keep the good food coming, Thon Buri and we will keep coming back."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprising! Quaint little place, yes it's in the strip mall. But you shouldn't let that stop you. I thought some of the other reviews may have been paid for, but after going there I really doubt it.  There is not much in the way of ambience. But good restaurants don't always need ambience. I would put this Thai food into that category. It was just the wife and I on date night. We ordered three entrées and appetizer of edemame and two Thai iced teas. We got enough food for a second meal. Wife got vegetarian pad Thai, I got mango curry and we shared a tofu fried rice.
We have commented in the past that Cleveland's Thai food scene has left a little bit to be desired because places we've been haven't had much of a flavor wow factor. This place wowed us with the food quality. 
The service was friendly but with only one waitress it was a little bit slow but not outrageously so. 
Our entire meal came to $54 which we felt was more than reasonable for the amount of food we got. 
We will be back with more relatives and for takeout in the future even though there are other Thai places closer to us.

Update 8/3/17: still excellent! Please go there so they have enough business. This is seriously becoming my favorite restaurant in the area."}
{"text":"Excellent Thai Cuisine! Highly recommend coming here. The service was very friendly and the atmosphere is peaceful. Try the Curry and Crab Rangoon; you won't regret it!!"}
{"text":"Excellent new placed in Bainbridge.  Did not even know it was there.  In a strip mall so it looks a little boring, but don't be fooled.  Really awesome food and the people who work there are nice and very friendly.  Had the beef Pad See Euw and the shrimp tempura appetizers which were great.  Everything else that my friends had was excellent as well.  Curry dish is amazing and really top notch.  Definitely check it out."}
{"text":"When I read the reviews I was so excited to eat here. When when walked in no one was there not a single table. Well any way my wife and I decided to give it a try. We ordered beef satay and chicken spring rolls. The beef satay was ice cold the spring rolls ok nothing special. Our meals where nothing special. We where very disappointed in the food. Not a place I would go back to. The people working there where very nice."}
