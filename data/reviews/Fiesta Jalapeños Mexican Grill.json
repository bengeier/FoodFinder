{"text":"This is solid Texmex food, I've been there many times and have never been disappointed.  I totally recommend this restaurant, glad it's close to my home!"}
{"text":"We eat here al the time. Including tonight. The food is always delicious and very reasonably priced"}
{"text":"If you're looking for super fast \"Mexican\" food, then this is the place for you. If you're looking for flavor, authenticity or a broad selection, then you'll want to keep looking. Most dishes tend to be slathered in cheese and/or cheese sauce, and taste like they're fresh from a can. If anything on the menu is homemade, they've done a great job of mimicking the taste of canned, institutionalized food that suburban middle America thinks Mexican tastes like."}
{"text":"Service is very fast.  Waiters are courteous and very helpful.  Food is also very good. In fact, I have never had a bad meal or bad experience here. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Fast service, great food, and huge margaritas!"}
{"text":"We have been coming to Fiesta since they first opened and this is by far our favorite Restaurant. The staff is always friendly and fast. As mentioned by pretty much everyone else the chips and Salsa are always great. Their salsa has a little hint of spice, but if it's not enough for you they have a much hotter version per request. The food is awesome and made the way we ask. By far the best thing on the menu is the Chipotle Chicken. And they will make it fire hot if you request it. 
And I can't forget to mention Lupe he makes the best drinks around and is always fun to hang out with."}
{"text":"ABSOLUTELY the best Mexican Restaurant we have ever been to, & we've been to many. The service is superb. Margaritas, food, & warm complimentary chips & salsa were fresh & delicious. Cannot say enough about this place. Highly, highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"i love the food you cook it's great first time i been there .i will tell all my friends. i will give your place 10 stars. thank to my friend santo rodriguez."}
{"text":"This is a tasty place with fast service. They have the usual selection of Mexican food and fresh salsa. My one wish is they would have more cheese on most items. Many things barely come with any cheese and that's my favorite part of Mexican meals."}
{"text":"From the looks of this place I thought my parents were nuts or just being swayed by their senior coupon in hand but I was wrong. This place is REALLY Good. Living in Chicago there is a mexican joint on every corner but I can honestly say this is some of the dishes are the best of their type that I've had, Chile Relleno hands down. I'm a fan."}
{"text":"The service is a great and the staff is friendly. The food seems to be quite authentic. Their chips and salsa are awesome. I recommend this place highly. It is the premiere North Ridgeville restaurant in my book."}
{"text":"Best mexican food.  Better than Nuevo Acapulco and Cozumel.  The chicken is delicious. Great service too!"}
{"text":"Lived in Ohio for 20 years.. small town atmosphere, great food.. this is a gem. Simple and casual. Stop by every time I'm in town."}
{"text":"We had heard good things about this place and finally had the opportunity to go tonight. We were seated right away. The server was friendly, fast, and attentive. The food came out super hot and was really good!! I can't wait to go back here. We used to drive to another Mexican restaurant but now we have this gem close by!!!!"}
{"text":"I live across the street from this place and I would still travel to North Olmsted to go to my favorite Mexican place, Nuevo Alcapulco.  It was a craving for Mexican food and a laziness to drive that I found myself in this quaint Mexican place for dinner.  

There is something seemingly authentic when your waiters have a heavy Mexican accent and I surely believe the only English they really know is the crappy Americanized pronunciations we give their food.

I noshed on a couple of Quesadillas and a rather large and in charge pitcher of margaritas.  My fellow diners decided on the fajitas, which as they come out sizzling, I am pretty sure, had the sprinkler system actually worked, I am sure it would have set them off.

The food; terrific.  The ambiance; awesome.  The price; extremely affordable.

The next time you find yourself in North Ridgeville and have the need for mexican, give this place a try.  You'll come out full and drunk, the way Mexican food should be eaten."}
{"text":"We heard good things about this restaurant so decided to put 'em to the test. And wow, they delivered. Food was ready less than 10 minutes after we ordered it (and it was pretty busy at the time too). The food was delicious, reasonably priced and good portions to fill you up. The staff is great (even with kids) and very friendly and patient. The decor is very unique but not cheesy (not much anyway). It's no fine dining experience by any stretch of the imagination, but it has become our favorite Mexican place near our home."}
{"text":"Good prices, great food, nice and open inside, tables not packed tgether.  5 mins from order to eating"}
{"text":"I seriously thought my husband was kidding when he told me he wanted to try this place, as I have not yet found a decent Mexican food place here in Cleveland (except for Nuevo Alcapulco). I am very picky about my Mexican food as I have lived in Southern Arizona for a little over a year and know what \"real\" Mexican food tastes like.

 It was a Friday night and the small little parking lot was packed. I figured that the cars had to be for Fiesta or Verizon Wireless really sucks for their customer service! We walked in and were seated right away. Large front dining room had a group of at least 15 people in one party. We were seated around the corner though in a smaller area that was a bit less noisy. Service was fast, chips were warm and the fresh salsa was awesome. We rarely ever finish a bowl of salsa, but tonight we asked for a 2nd bowl. I ordered 2 tacos and rice where as my husband ordered a beef burrito and the Azteca Sampler. Tons of food for both and the Margarita was huge! The server gave me the wrong taco filling but realized this on her own. She asked if I would like the correct ones, and when I said, \"YES, please\" she had the new tacos out within a minute later!!! 

I highly recommend this place to anyone who is looking for decent Mexican food!! Great food, very decent prices, and awesome service!! This is my new favorite place to eat!!"}
{"text":"My family and I tried this place for the first time for a late dinner. I ordered a fajita burro (large burrito) and was rather disappointed. The chicken and steak in the burrito was not very flavorful and it didn't come with rice or salsa. If you want an excellent, tasty burrito I'd recommend Nuevo Alcapoco in North Olmsted.  My brother was happy with his dish, el tapatio. We had great service and the decor was great. I don't think I would be back for another meal though."}
{"text":"My husband and I got take out from here. I used the \"explore the menu\" on Yelp. Neither of us had ever had flautas but we gave them a whirl. Upon calling in our order we were put on hold for a couple minutes. When she came back I asked for the flautas and she kept insisting they were just an appetizer. She eventually put me on hold again and she said she found it and placed out order. Just 15 minutes later my husband picked up the food and it arrived to us hot and tasty. The quantity was good and it was well packaged. We would return if we were in the area."}
{"text":"So I was super-duper excited to try the new Mex place I hadn't been to.  The waiter brings over chips & great salsa that actually had a mini-kick.  And yes, upon request they had hot salsa!  When I ordered my marg he asked if I wanted a strong one.  Ummm YES!?  I was so pleased w/ the chips, salsa, and marg that I just knew the food would be awesome.  Le sigh....not so much.  Overall the food was kind of bland.  
The best thing was the stuffed Poblano pepper.  

Service was great.  The restaurant seemed clean. 

Would I go back?  For chips & booze....heck yeah.  Food...not so much."}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican place close to home.  Its cheap, quick and the food is really good and fresh.  I met my mom for lunch today and ordered the lunch-portion of the chicken fajitas.  The meal was only $7 and there was enough for two people!  Our waiter wasn't exactly friendly, but he was efficient which is welcome when you only have an hour for lunch.  He did win major points because he brought me extra tortillas and a separate container for salsa to take home with my leftovers.  Personality or not, going the extra mile is a big plus for me when it comes to service.  I may have said I had a 5 star experience today, but we were seated behind some obnoxious patrons.  Apparently Tammi (I know her name because she was talking/yelling so loudly we couldn't help but overhear her entire conversation) was having some baby-daddy drama.  Travis's (the baby-daddy) new girlfriend (Stacy) called Tammi white-trash.  Sorry Tammi, but I think Stacy might be on to something..."}
{"text":"The food is good and the margaritas are just okay. The one downfall of this place is that you feel like you are being rushed out. I could never just sit and enjoy a margarita or two or three with friends because I feel the servers rush you out the place. It gets really busy at times and it is really really loud in the restaurant. If you have children and want a place to go where they can get you in and out in no time, then Fiesta Jalape√±os  is the place for you!"}
{"text":"Very very very good. I had the Chile Verde Burrito. I love Chile Verde, but this was seriously one of the tastiest burritos I have ever had, I can't even tell you why. Service was very speedy too. I wish I lived closer. Not only have I moved to a different state, but when I come home, I'm almost never in North Ridgeville."}
{"text":"Quick friendly service and good food. I just wish certain items came with cheese. I forget what I ordered. But something that normally has cheese on it didn't have any and I was sad."}
{"text":"Food and service was A1. Food came out quick and sizzling.  Staff was friendly and very attentive.  Would definitely recommend and have recommended to friends.   Great variety of hot sauces already available at the table,  and they have some awesome salsa.    

Chicken and steak fajitas had great seasoning and flavor. 

Chicken and beef rancheros were delicious."}
{"text":"This is absolutely my favorite mexican place for sit down dining in the area.  (and I've been to 'em all).  

The staff is fast, pleasant and accommodating.  The servers heavy accents make me feel like I've gone on a trip far far south of my less-than-caliente geographic location.  The food is authentic enough to make this feeling last.  

The food is always served quickly and is delivered hot enough to allow you to finish the conversation you're having with your mealtime companions before chowing down without fear of digging into a cold plate of mexican goodies. 

I recently took family here who have seriously discerning tastes and they were so impressed with the quality and authenticity of the food, as well as with the extra large portion sizes,  that they will be taking friends here within the week.

Perfect for a fun family dinner or date night."}
{"text":"Amazing, amazing, amazing!!! From service to cleanliness, from food to drinks... This place is fantastic! First time here and will return!  

So good, I want to hug the chef. And that says something!"}
{"text":"I'm going to have to disagree with the other reviews. I was not impressed at all.   Very crowded and extremely loud. The food did not come out quick like most of the other reviews mentioned. We waited about 30 minutes for our meals. It was a Saturday night and they were busy so I expected some kind of wait so i wasnt upset about that. The food was really nothing to brag about. 

I had the #29 enchiladas supreme it came with 4 enchiladas beef, bean, chicken and cheese also a side of rice. My enchiladas were average. The rice was very soggy, not good at all. Our chips and salsa were less then ok, chips were stale or maybe over cooked either way they wernt good. The salsa was pretty salty. We ended up adding some of the hot sauce from the table because it was just blah! I had a pi√±a colada that was pretty good and my boyfriend had a long island iced tea. Both drinks were OK, again nothing spectacular. The service was pretty slow, about 10 minutes to get another drink, not good!

After our cheese dip, 3 drinks & 2 meals our bill was right around $55 before the tip. Kinda pricey for blah food! I wouldn't say it was horrible, but I probably won't ever go back. It was just OK!"}
{"text":"Went yesterday for $1 taco Tuesday. This is a good deal that makes you feel ok about the fact that you just drank a $17 pitcher of margaritas by yourself."}
{"text":"Yum!!! Much is lost on the decor, nonetheless, the food here is definitely authentic and downright delicious!!!"}
{"text":"Great Mexican food in Cleveland area. Very fast service, festive atmosphere, helpful staff, and very cheap. They have a secret spicy salsa for chips, well worth a try; chips tasted fresh."}
{"text":"Thursday night visit...I've driven past a few times and saw the parking lot jam-packed, so we came early.  The place was still over 50% packed at 5:30, and was almost full when we left around 6:15.

Great service - very friendly, and when we had the wrong order brought to our table, the waiter took care of it immediately.  Food came out quickly (which seems to be the norm for Mexican restaurants), and was pretty good.

I had the chimichangas - the chicken one was incredible, while the beef one was a little different from what I've had before (because of the red chiles they use, giving it a sweet, almost ketchup-like flavor).  The rice was also very good.  Chips were warm, and the salsa was good.  I did catch a bite of my daughter's carnitas, and the piece I sampled was a little fatty, unfortunately.  They also didn't serve it with lettuce and guacamole (must not be included?).

Overall, I can see why this place is so popular, but it wasn't necessarily better than the Don Tequila in Elyria.  We'll probably be back."}
{"text":"Situated in a strip mall, one's initial impression may be somewhat underwhelmed,  yet every time I've eaten here, the place is packed.  Then again, it's the only Mexican restaurant that I'm aware of between Elyria and North Olmsted so they don't need to try hard.  

Still they've managed to turn out some really delicious food.  Chips have always been warm and served with a fresh salsa with a little bite.   The menu holds the standard tacos, burritos and enchiladas that every Mexican restaurant in the Midwest seems to have, but they do a fairly good job with all of them.  If you're looking for an icy cold way to chill out, try the Frozen Margarita Texana.

Good affordable restaurant for large groups or families."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant. Ever. Lupe holds down the bar with tequila shots. The service is sooooo fast. The food is authentic Mexican and I've never eaten anything there I didn't like...and trust me, I've tried almost everything on the menu. Favorites are the taco salad, quesadillas, queso dip, Popeye's Pollo, & recently just tried the fish tacos. YUM! 

The place is huge so there's hardly ever a wait unless you want to sit at the bar. The Texana Margaritas are fun :) You only need one... 

Everyone is so friendly and the service is great! Everyone I take here loves it!"}
{"text":"I'm not big on Mexican food, but when I want a good lunch I go to Fiesta Jalapenos. You can always rely on them for good, filling food. I personally really like the lunch #7 & 17. They're fast, filling, and tasty! Plus $6.99 for a lunch, you really can't go wrong. 

Plus I'm a huge fan of the cheesy decor they have going on, it puts me in the festive mood :)"}
{"text":"Fantastic little spot!  I just love the Mexican-mod decor.  The service is always fast and efficient.  The food is delicious.  The bar is also a fun place to hang out.  This is the busiest restaurant in North Ridgeville, but you never have to wait very long for a table.  Put this on your list of regulars!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy the steak ranchero using the pablano sauce! This will satisfy all taste budz, especially those that enjoy \"grilled jalapenos n onions\" for that extra kick!

Not to mention, you'll get a big kick if you sit at the bar and Ro serves you. Hang on!"}
{"text":"I am from Cleveland but live in New York now and come home a few times a year. We are always looking for a good restaurant, and we found a great place.  I had the carnitas, and this was the best carnitas I have ever had.  Everyone in our party enjoyed their dinners and the pitchers of margaritas were great.  We all had a great time, even our little one had a great time.  Service was excellent!!!!"}
{"text":"I was tired of Mexican food because it all tastes the same.  I was asked to go here by a few friends and I was reluctant to go.  I even tried to change it a few times.  Anyway,   we went and I got the Chipotle chicken.  The flavor was wonderful and the chicken was moist and tender.  This was by far the best Mexican I've ever eaten.  I can't wait to go back and try something else"}
{"text":"I really like this place. We have been here several times and have never been disappointed. 

Very Good food
Fair prices
Good drinks
Great staff"}
{"text":"Good stuff here. Only complaint is the food comes out to fast. Let me get a margarita in me first!"}
{"text":"Food sucks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Won't go back! Where is the REAL Mexican flavor? Don't go here unless you just want to eat chips & drink! Sucks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Can't go wrong if you like quick mexican food.  Where I usually like my food a little spicier, the meals came out fast and tasted great.

The carnitas tasted like they had been slow-roasted for hours like they should be.  As with most mexican restaurants, the chipes were fine and the salsa was very mild.  

Quick, pleasant service and a good margarita round off a decent meal."}
{"text":"The best Mexican food and margaritas around! I'm a regular. Treat yourself to the Texana Margarita and a fried ice cream to share. Service is beyond exceptional!!"}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with this place.  Amazing Authentic Mexican!  The staff is awesome and service is very quick.  Place is clean and good size.  Great for families and groups.   Margaritas are amazing. Prices are great.  Every dish we have had has been great.  Bottomless chips and salsa!"}
{"text":"Service isn't always best, but we used to go to Fiesta all the time when we lived in North Ridgeville.  The food was always tasty.  We now live in Streetsboro and have yet to find a mexican restaurant that is as yummy as Fiesta.  
     We recently went back to Fiesta (after a 4 year hiatus because we moved an hour away) on a trip from Cedar Point with my brother and his girlfriend...they live in Atlanta.  My brother kept eating even though he was full \"because the food was so delicious!).  All of our meals were great!  We were thrilled that it was just as good as we remembered.  Looking forward to going back as soon as possible!"}
{"text":"Fiesta Jalape√±os is, hands down, my favorite Mexican restaurant.  The complimentary chips and salsa are great, the margaritas are delicious, and the food is always hot and fresh.  When I go with family or friends, we usually start off with the tamale appetizer.  It comes with a creamy spicy sauce that does not accompany an a la carte tamal. I love the enchiladas with the mole sauce, the chimichangas, the special fajitas...it's all good.  I've never had dessert here, so I can't speak to that, and my only complaint would be that sometimes the shredded beef can be a little dry.  I highly recommend Fiesta's.  Don't forget to stop and have a chat with Lupe at the bar; he's the best!"}
{"text":"My coworkers and I love going here for lunch.  Taco Tuesday is the best day to go since all regular tacos are just $.99!  You have your choice of hard or soft tacos filled with ground beef, shredded chicken, shredded beef, carnitas, or steak.  A couple times when we've gone, they charged a little more for carnitas or steak tacos, but most of the time they're all the same price. I guess it depends in who your server is...weird.

The warm tortilla chips and fresh salsa are great!  I haven't tried their margaritas since I've only been there during my lunch break, but I've heard good things about them! The dining room is spacious and clean and they have a nice little bar inside too.

The workers are friendly and attentive. This place is owned by the same people that run the S√≠ Se√±or restaurants and a few others in the Cleveland area. Food is pretty consistent and service is quick."}
