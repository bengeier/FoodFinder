{"text":"This place has a lot of things going for it - it is just off the beaten path so that you can sit on the charming patio and it feels quiet and hidden.  And....they get the most important component of pizza right - the crust.  It's chewy and flavorful at the edges and thin in the middle while still standing up to the toppings and not getting floppy.  My only complaint is that they don't have a margherita pizza on the menu.  In my opinion, the margherita pizza is the true measure of a neopolitan style pizza restaurant, but Il Bosco does not offer one.  Their most simple pizza is this Adrianna, but instead of being dotted delicately with Buffalo mozzarella, it's spread liberally, American-style, with melted cheese."}
{"text":"Phenomenal pizza, quaint atmosphere, fresh ingredients. There was 2 of us, we ordered the Lucia and the Dona and inhaled both of them ! I'm from Chicago, and I have finally found pizza that can be called pizza !! Delicious crust, very friendly staff, excellent service, and tasty complimentary olives while you wait for your pizza .... can't wait to go back !!"}
{"text":"Our favorite pizza place in town! We took local friends for their 1st time and they loved it! It was packed when we arrived at 7:30 but Barbara and Bill welcomed us with hugs and wine - we were seated within 10 min at a great table on the cozy patio- under strung party lights and outdoor heating - resting on pillows at our seats I told Bill the atmosphere is like heaven. We shared the kale and spinach and caprese salads before sampling a few of the specials pizza and my favorite, the Biaggia. We're all coming back, especially to see Arturo, the mystery guest- chances are he'll be there for your next visit too."}
{"text":". We were in Phoenix last week and decided to try this place based on all the great Yelp reviews. I'm glad to say we were not disappointed. The pizzas are absolutely amazing. The owner runs this place himself and takes great pride in making sure that you are fully satisfied. The next time that we are in the Phoenix area we are definitely going going to have to make a return visit if I could I would give this place 6 stars"}
{"text":"I just found this review saved as a draft from my trip to Scottsdale in March. I still feel just as strongly about it today...  I can honestly say that my meal at il bosco tonight was one of the best overall meals I've ever had. I can not think of a single thing I would change about this place, aside from putting it in my neighborhood at home in Denver. From the stellar service to absolutely delicious food to comfortable ambience they have truly done everything right. Trust me when I say that the reviews do not lie."}
{"text":"I went into Il Bosco for lunch and found that my party was the only group in the restaurant (okay, we were getting lunch at like 3 pm, which I guess is weird). This actually turned into a charming experience. We talked to the owner for a while and he told us the story of how he got his start.   He served us himself, and the food was fantastic! Super fresh, and we got to watch them make our pizza in the brick oven! We ordered the Biaggia pizza off the lunch menu, and it was topped with figs, prosciutto, cheese and arugula. Totally excellent combo! The Bistecca sandwich, with steak and mushrooms, was also good. Menu items were simple but fresh and clearly from high quality ingredients. I loved talking to the owner as well, it seems like this whole place was made with love!"}
{"text":"I took my family of seven to IL Bosco's last night and was I ever happy I did. Coming from the Pizza capital of America, Connecticut, this restaurant would be one of the best against the nationally ranked pizza places there. My wife had the Fig, Goat cheese, Prosciutto and Arugula pizza,what a pie. I had the Lucia, and the kids had normal pepperoni, which they all raved over. You also have to have the Caprese salad, very, very good. The service was very friendly and informative. My only regret on the restaurant is that it's here in Arizona and not Connecticut. Well done."}
{"text":"Hard to find and very small but would go back many times. Great pizza and very friendly staff. Snug and cozy works well at this wonderful find."}
{"text":"Read such good things.  What a disappointment. Really? Five stars?  Maybe for attitude!  Paying for \"still\" water is really a joke when you are spending $27.00 on a bottle of wine  plus the cost of two pizza's - you would think water would be free.  If we were you we'd try Fate Brewing just down the street for a great wood-fired pizza and all the FREE \"still\" water you can drink without attitude.  Sorry, we only wish it was better as it's just out our back door.  Best of luck to Bill."}
{"text":"I've tried every pizza place in the area and this is By far the best place to get pizza in Scottsdale.  They use only the best ingredients on their pizza.  Also have excellent root beer."}
{"text":"Very solid pizza with great atmosphere!  Low key, friendly, and all about excellent pizza with fresh ingredients.  I knew as soon as I saw the brick oven and the simple wine glass that I was in the right place.  Just wish I found it sooner"}
{"text":"This hidden gem offers delicious food with an authentic Italian ambiance. The menu is simple, yet incredibly flavorful. The ingredients are fresh and the wood fired pizza oven cooks everything to perfection!"}
{"text":"Well, we were swayed by the reviews and good press, so we went.  Not overly impressed, but I guess it is in what one is looking for.  This place has one size pizza, 11 inch, and a pizza variety limited to eight or so.  None are standard Italian fare.  Salads are limited to two pretty ordinary selections.  Our pizza was VERY salty, with a remarkable blandness.  My wife, who has a very limited capacity for pizza was still hungry after we split a salad and a pizza.  Also, beware ordering the $3 bottle of water.  It is very large but non-branded.  Folks who like this type of pizza are those taken with botique kinds of food given a liking for something non-traditional.   Pizza Bianco folks would be happy with this as would Barrio Mexican food fans.  For us, these offerings were lacking in flavor, spice and quantity.  I'm sure the quality of ingredients is good as the proprietor seems to take great care with his product.  However, in the final analysis, we cannot agree with any 5 star rating.  PS.  The owner responded to my comments saying he was happy to be compared to Pizza Bianco and Barrio.  I wasn't suggesting those spots were bad.  However, what they offer is  \"Foofey Food.\"   If that is the kind of fare one likes, so be it.  For those looking for something more substantial, \"Foofey Food\" doesn't do the trick."}
{"text":"We were introduced to Il Bosco by a very close friend who is a chef. Looking through their Yelp reviews and website I saw that they also cater! Our first dinner was fabulous and I knew I wanted them to cater my upcoming wedding. Their pizza is delicious, ambiance is great, and staff are so friendly. Bill made the process so easy and their catering prices are fantastic. My guests LOVED pizza at the wedding. Who wouldn't like fresh pizza at a wedding?! With the pizza oven parked in my driveway, they did passed appetizers, salad, pizza, and cannoli for desert. This was the best decision I made for my wedding. Out with cold catered chicken piccata and in with IL BOSCO!!!"}
{"text":"I found Il Bosco on Yelp and came because it had so many 5 star ratings. It's for good reason this little hole in the wall has garnered such positive remarks.  First thing: it's tough to find, but don't give up. The restaurant can be found behind their portable wood fire pizza oven. Once inside, wave to the owner. He's wearing a white chef coat and has grey hair. Even if you don't wave, count on a table side visit.   Second: he's a former golf pro who tired of traveling and thought opening a restaurant would be fun.   Third: get the homemade meatballs to start. Delicious and served on a plate of homemade tomato sauce that's also delicious.  Fourth: order the Joanna or Biaggia. Every pie comes in just one size. The Joanna has hot Italian sausage that's home made. The Biaggia is the PERFECT combination of sweet and savory. Yes, it has figs in it and yes, they are delicious.   Fifth: be prepared to come home with money in your pocket because Il Bosco is very affordable.  I brought two buddies from SoCal and all agreed we would return. Lots of people talk about Pizzaria Bianco, and for good reason. Il Bosco is right there in terms of food quality but you don't have to wait four hours. It's the PERFECT local Pizzaria."}
{"text":"As close as it gets to a real Italian pizza here in Phoenix. I am an Italian and I have only been here for a few years, and let me tell you, it is refreshing to finally get a taste of home. The crust is just the consistency that it should be. It's not an American pizza, it's much lighter and not as greasy. I will most definitely return on a regular basis."}
{"text":"Recently moved from the East Coast. So glad Yelp introduced us to Il Bosco. I highly recommend the Biaggia pizza. It's amazing. Great food and great hospitality from this small little spot."}
{"text":"David P.   You're sub part review is nonsense.  The owner is the most hospitable owner we have ever encountered !   Just a great environment and friendly people.  We chose to sit at bar and watch all the pizzas being made in the brick oven.  It made us change our mind 4 times in which one to choose!!   We had the special app of stuffed peppers and the spinach & kale ceased salad. Both amazing!  And then the owner asked us to taste the salsa di parmigiana with his homemade crostini, compliments of the house. Wow!!  Now my wife and I are enjoying and Italian beer and Italian wine, both great, while we decide what pizza to order.   We frequent the foodie town of Austin often and this place would kill there !!"}
{"text":"After reading reviews on Yelp, we left a different pizza place to come here.  I'm glad we did.  The pizza was fantastic; I could have stayed there and watched them make pizza for hours.  The wood fire oven is right there and watching them work is inspiring.  The owner, Bill Forrest, was there and took our order.  It was so nice to see an owner go and visit with the patrons, calling most of them by name, to make sure people were happy with their experience.   Bill cares...about the food they make and about the people who visit.  What a great combination.  I love to eat quality food.  I don't exercise like a should, so I do my best to have a healthy diet because I still have an active lifestyle.  I have become passionate about food, usually preferring to make/grow my own food.    Some day, when I get \"20 seconds of crazy insane courage,\" I will follow Bill's example and do things the right way...the way he does it at Il Bosco Pizza."}
{"text":"Great pizza!! One of the best pizza places in AZ. Very convenient location near Scottsdale and Shea. So good!"}
{"text":"Came here based on the reviews and this place exceeded my expectation. The service was excellent; we took the suggestions of our server, who I think could be the owner. We shared three pizzas between the 4 of us and it was the perfect amount of food. The biaggia was our number one and is also a house favorite. Do not leave this place without a pour of the after dinner amaretto!"}
{"text":"The best pizza we've ever had. Incredible service...they make you feel very welcome. Beautiful patio. We'll be back again very soon!"}
{"text":"Came here late night after a day of hiking and exploring. First of all, I would have given this place 4 stars because the food did not live up to the rating based off yelp. I came here with high expectations, and I was with my family. The kids wanted ice cream, the waiter recommended us a lemon sorbet but did not state the price, and since the menu lists a sorbet a certain price we thought it would be the same price we would be charged. Turns out, they were very misleading (minus one star) and we were charged almost 2x as much..I believe it was $7 for half a lemon sized sorbet! Outrageous, esp when we got three of them! Total of three of the sorbets cost the same as one pizza. Pizza is overpriced also, esp since their toppings aren't that much. Disappointed as they did not meet the expectations as I thought they would based on the yelp review."}
{"text":"This place was a little tricky for us to find, but we weren't disappointed! Great food and awesome customer service! Make sure you get the fried raviolis, they were amazing!!!!"}
{"text":"Eager staff, like they are on a mission to serve.  Quiet and cozy place.  Not what you want for a first date if you need a little energy from the enviro.  Well-crafted za, and baked by a guy watching the flecks of dough cook to perfection.  Their idea of perfection looks a little dark, so you should like a slight charring.  The prosciutto ingredient is the real thing.  The crust is lean.  It seems like flour, water, yeast, salt - no or little shortening.  This is not the golden pie where your hand comes away greasy after grabbing a slice.  Excellent salad - fresh romaine, good sharp cheese.  If you don't like a healthy dose of dressing ask for them to lighten up, but the caesar - it's tasty!  Interesting selection of italian wines at $8-10 for a small-med pour.  This is an artisan's pizza and deserves a try to round out the rich, cheesy pies that are found elsewhere."}
{"text":"Make sure you make your way here! Great service, incredible food, and very Mom & Pop feel. The meatball appetizer was delicious, and can't go wrong with any of the pizzas here. I would definitely come back here, and soon!"}
{"text":"Great pizza and friendly service. We had tr biaggia (goat cheese, fig, prosciutto, arugula, and parm) and the Dona (fresh tomato, pancetta, and cheese) - both were great. The crust is crisp with a great chew and good flavor. We also tried the meatballs which are small but flavorful with a touch of fennel for extra flavor. The fried ravioli is a far cry from the fried ravioli you're probably used to and definitely worth a try. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We are foodies from Portland Oregon. We saw a positive review so we gave this restaurant to try. It was excellent! We had a Caesar salad and a margarita pizza. They were delicious!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite pizza place in the area. It's a cute little restaurant where the owner actually cares to stop and have a conversation with you. I get take out from here often and the pizza is always fresh and never disappoints. Best place in the area!"}
{"text":"We ate there a few nights ago with our kids and it really was perfect. The atmosphere is charming, our server was fantastic, and the pizzas were exceptional!  Such a special and wonderful place. Hope to go every time we are in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"The food is EXCELLENT!  We have been 5 times now, and everything we have had has been delicious!  We will continue to dine w Bill and IL Bosco!  The Caprese is AWESOME!"}
{"text":"romantic atmosphere, all the food was perfectly handmade and rustic."}
{"text":"Pizzas are amazing but much of everything else on the menu is not all that great.  Example:  my salad consisted of wilted, slimy, and old lettuce.  The replacement dish that the waiter brought to me was no better.  However, the waiter took the salad off the bill so at least the customer service is up to par.  Again, pizzas are unique and delicious.  I would go back for the pizza."}
{"text":"We're from Northern California, so finding good pizza is almost a mission for us. We drove 15 miles to find Il Bosco, and the food did not disappoint. The outdoor patio seating was a nice bonus. Do be aware that in Scottsdale, most restaurants button up tight at 9 pm, so be sure to allow enough time to order and eat before closing. We arrived at 8:15 and got a chilly reception. The person waiting on us splashed the wine into our glasses and I ended up with some on my jeans. Plates and dishes were removed without asking before we had finished eating. Since others on Yelp have praised the service, we're chalking up our experience to our poor timing."}
{"text":"Can't say enough about my meal here. From start to finish it was a pleasant, enjoyable dining experience. Friendly, attentive service and delicious food. Three of us shared a bottle of wine, caprese salad, Biaggio and Carmela pizzas, and a taste of their homemade amaretto. Wonderful homemade crust and top notch toppings make Il Bosco a special place. They seem to do a brisk carry-out business, too. They also have a portable wood-fired oven to do catering. Wish I lived here so I could be a regular!"}
{"text":"We have been here 4 times now and have never been disappointed. Small bar so we try to sit there. Great owner, a taste of homemade Amoretto for desert.  Pizza is awesome. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Our new favorite place for pizza! Friendly staff, fresh ingredients and great service."}
{"text":"This place is great! I went there with my mom and my sister. We figured we would order two pizzas and take the rest home as leftovers. Well, the pizzas came and we ate every last bite! So much for those leftovers!   After dinner we had the brownie sundae, which was also to die for. We loved this quaint restaurant and their friendly staff. The owner is so welcoming and pleasant. Thanks for the amazing meal!"}
{"text":"Visiting from California and Bill was the ultimate host and the food was excellent. Salads were fresh and awesome. Pizzas were crisp and inventive.  The wine was delicious and very reasonably priced (and served at the correct temperature to boot). It's a great little space in a city full of cookie-cutter restaurants, this is a unique gem.  I recommend it highly."}
{"text":"My husband and I ordered the Joanna and the Donna for dinner tonight.  Because we had such a great pizza a few weeks ago we wanted to try it again. BIG MISTAKE.  We each had one slice and threw the rest  out.  Didn't taste like pizza and the  crust was not done at all.  One of the pizzas was so bad we were afraid to eat anymore of it, nothing tasted right, didn't even smell right.  When we called to complain and let them know about the pizzas we were met with \" well we haven't had any complaints tonight and I'm sure when you come back in you will find it better\". No offer of free pizza and no apology.  Never going back, too bad, we like supporting local small business."}
{"text":"Il bosco reminded me of a pizza place on lago lugano in switzerland.  The owner is very laid back and generous; he even bought me a \"campari\" soda.  It's obvious he has a lot of passion in his restaurant.  The ambiance is intimate and the staff is attentive and on their game.  The flavor from the wood fire oven was as expected.  The pizza dough was over kneaded...also, if the portion of bread/crust was less I think I would have been more pleased.  The ingredients seemed fresh but average quality.  The amount of cheese and sauce was perfect though...  I'm honestly unsure if I'll return.  My expectations were higher.  Still, give it a try if you want a decent pizza with great service and atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Stopped at Il Bosco after seeing a story about it on TV.  It was great!  We had a brunch pizza with chorizo, topped with an egg, then a pizza with sausage and spinach.  Both were really good!  We sat at the counter and watched the pizzas being made.  The cooks and hostess were all so nice.  It was a fun, unique, out of the way place--we will definitely stop in again on our next vacation!"}
{"text":"This place is always fantastic and there is always something unique available to try on a regular basis (the daily pizza white/red specials are always fantastic!)  That said, this truly is a special place beyond the amazing pizza (and bread and olives and wine and....) and it's a result of the special attention that the proprietor Bill Forest gives to each and every customer that has the privilege of dining here.   My fiance and I try to go 2-3 times a month or more (we'd go 2x a week if we lived closer) and we're never ever disappointed, in fact, there is no other pizza that we will even eat now that we've found il Bosco.   Always fantastic, always personal, always amazing, I cannot recommend this place enough and implore anyone who's interested in pizza to visit here."}
{"text":"YUMMY!!!  My husband and I had a delicious lunch today on the patio.  We shared a salad and 2 pizzas.  The owner Bill had us try this pizza that was AMAZING!  The salad was yummy too :)    We will definitely be coming back again!  A hidden gem right off of Scottsdale Rd and Shea  LOVED THIS PLACE!!!"}
{"text":"Tried it out on 7/3/12 with my husband and 2 friends. We each ordered a different pizza so we got to try a nice variety. Loved the pizza especially the crispy crust. Very fresh ingredients. There is no reason to drive into Phoenix for pizza at Bianco or Cibo when this gem is in the neighborhood! I will be back."}
{"text":"The best wood fire pizza I have ever eaten.  Good variety, indoor and outdoor seating.  Owner came by our table to ask about the meal.  Decent beer selection (local).  The charge of a couple bucks for tap water is something that the owner needs to reconsider, leaves a bad taste after a great meal.  Upcharge something else to make up for this.  Otherwise great pizza."}
{"text":"Awesomeness. Came from out of town and this place crushed it. Great service. Fantastic food. We'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Great wood fired pizza. Appropriately chilled wine. Fresh organic ingredients. Delightful conversation with the owner."}
{"text":"This is a bold statement you can only make once in your life, but this is best pizza I've ever had.  Eaten there twice in 4 days. You taste the freshness of ingredients with every bite & dough is so fresh it doesn't stay in stomach making you feel gross & like you have pizza hangover. Also try the meatballs - exceptional. Owner is cool guy trying to take a swing at his passion - have to respect an entrepreneur following his passion."}
{"text":"Wonderful little spot where you could blink and miss it if you don't know where you're going.  Pizza's are as authentic a Neapolitan style as you will get in Arizona.  Small, simple menu that won't overwhelm, great service, cozy atmosphere...... Worth the trip!"}
{"text":"Went to Il Bosco last night for the first time and was not disappointed!  The Joanna pizza was delicious.  Can't wait to go back and try the other pizzas :)"}
{"text":"We have been here twice now and love everything about it! The owner is very passionate and involved in his restaurant. He was serving customers, busing tables, and even sat down to have a conversation with us. The brick oven pizza is excellent! We also had the fried ravioli, which was a special of the night and the house made red sauce that came with it was the real deal. Beautiful property.. Would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"I've been waiting too long to write reviews, so all I can tell you is that the food is quite good. It's four stars. If you want the best, go to Pomo in Phoenix, Piazza al Forno in Glendale, and maybe Bianco.  The owner didn't think I was legit when I walked in. I came in for a late lunch, as usual, well after 1:00. It was quiet, might have had the whole place to myself. When I walked in, the owner did some kind of read on me and pegged me as someone who might be looking for a random pizza place, might not appreciate the kind of primo place this was. Picture a Mexican dude walking in in khaki shorts, polo shirt, nice sandals. Call it a graduate student uniform, or an Arizona uniform, but maybe it's a big departure from the normal North Scottsdale lunch crowd.  Anyway, I sensed the vibe come from him -- he thought I didn't know what kind of place this was. So we were talking, and I mentioned that I'd been to Bianco and Humble Pie, that I took Alan Richman's Top 25 pizza places in America and used it as a guide for my trip through the northeast (try Bob and Timmy's in Providence, RI -- they grill their pizza, man). From this, it seemed like he understood that I was a serious individual, someone who was there for the real thing."}
{"text":"WOW ...  some on Yelp feel  there is a controversy about the quality of pizza at Ill Bosco?  You have to be kidding me ...  I challenge anyone in a very loving way  to take a drive out to this very centrally located location (Shea and Scottsdale rd) and sit down and try one of the pies.  Bill is not only a wonderful host, but the food is consistently superb and the overall energy (especially at night) is incredible.  I was there with my husband last friday night and it had the feel of a booming New York restaurant on a busy night.  Best of all ... you won't be paying New York prices, because everything is reasonable."}
{"text":"Great place. Pizza and dessert were both amazing.  The atmosphere and staff were very homey and inviting. We will be going back."}
{"text":"Great place for great pizza done right. The owner is always on site and the service is spot on."}
{"text":"Il Bosco is an excellent little restaurant and pizzeria.   warm, fun decor.  the food is fantastic.   the food on the menu is fresh and creative.  the owner, Bill Forrest, has a very personal touch and oversees it all quite well.  it is a hidden gem in Scottsdale but once you know where it is you will go back again and again!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I'd heard about Il Bosco from Yelp, was in the area, and thought I would try some of their pizza.  It is very small, with a small outside seating area.  The menu has pizza, salads, two appetizers, and two desserts.  They have a wood fired pizza oven, which gives their pizza the perfect crust. They do have beer and wine, although a limited selection.  I ordered the Joanna Pizza - pepperoni, sausage, cheese and tomatoes, and had them add onions. It was delicious, one of the best pizza's I have tasted.  I was going to give it a four star rating, but had several pieces left over, which I took home for breakfast the next day.  Wow!! It is the only pizza I have had that actually tasted better the day after!! That in and of itself, bumps them up to a five star rating.  Another plus is their prices are very, very reasonable.  All in all, a great little restaurant."}
{"text":"Just awesome. Had the Biaagia and I was blown away by it's flavor and how crunch, yet chewy the pie crust was. They don't get cheap with their ingredients and offer the toppings generously. Nice fresh meat and vegetables.  Friendly staff, every time I come here.  Try the Caprese. It's incredibly fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"I'm new to the area, so I've been slowly trying local pizza places trying to find my new favourite pizza.  This was the worst one so far.  I ordered through DoorDash.com, which was a disaster unto itself.  I can't blame Il Bosco for the fact that my pizza arrived cold. What I can blame them for though, is that the pizza was inedible because it tasted like a salt lick.    My Order - The Adrianna (cheese, tomato sauce, basil)  I have had some bad pizza in my day, but I can always power through, because even bad pizza is usually has some redeeming quality.  This, however, I had to throw out.  It was burnt in places (I know wood fire pizza is going to have some char marks, but this was flat out burnt).  I would have been willing to deal with the burnt parts, but it was so salty I couldn't choke it down.  Believe me, I like salt - I add it to everything. If I'm saying it was too salty, it's because it tasted like someone dropped the entire jar of Morton's in the sauce, then tried to hide the spill with the cheese.    Perhaps dining in would yield a better pie, I don't know.  It would take a lot of me to take the risk though."}
{"text":"This East Coast girl was a very happy camper after our visit to Il Bosco! (we have high pizza standards where I come from).  We were group of 5 in town on business. Our original plan was Romo, but the 1-1/2 hour wait deterred us and we found Il Bosco and what a find it was! The atmosphere was comfortable and casual. The owner was very attentive with a great sense of humor. All good, but nothing compared to the quality of the food. From the delicious olives and bread with seasoned olive oil that got us started, to the fresh salad and finally to four of the best pizzas! We tried white and red; all had perfectly thin crusts with the right amount of dough around the edge and each was topped with wonderfully fresh cheese or other inventive ingredients. Exquisite!  The party didn't end there - we finished off with lemon sorbetto which just perfect and the youngest members of our group had the stamina for the pumpkin brownie.  We all decided when we left dinner that this place was going to get a return visit on our next business trip."}
{"text":"We  came here and were so excited to see Forrest but when we drive up we. See they. Are closed august he closed for the month of August.so hopefully they will open  After aug. Looking forward to pizza making"}
{"text":"We're staying nearby at the Hyatt Regency for a weekend getaway and wanted a change of scene with a small local restaurant that would appeal to me, my husband, and 5-year-old son--and weren't disappointed with this choice.  We sat outside on a pleasant evening and enjoyed a couple of pizzas, Caesar salad, wine, and gelato. Pizza was nicely crusty and slightly charred at the edges. Staff was kind, vibe was good, a winner all around."}
{"text":"I searched on Yelp for \"best pizza in Scottsdale\", and this came up #1.  I thought it was great.  The service was wonderful.  The pizza was great, probably thanks to the wood oven."}
{"text":"I'm seriously wondering about all of the \"5 star\" rave reviews here. I went to il bosco last weekend with a couple of friends.  We sat at the bar right in front of the pizza oven.  The first thing I noticed was a giant bag of pre-shredded mozzarella cheese sitting on the counter. For an authentic Neopolitan-style brick oven pizza place that is unacceptable. As expected the pizza tasted like it was made with processed cheese.   The sauce and mozzarella just melted into a big gooey mess in the center and the crust was pretty dry and flavorless.  This pizza is average at best. I was really disappointed in this place, especially after some reviewers compared it to Bianco's, Cibo and Pomo.  Hate to say it, but il bosco isn't close to being in the same league as those places.  If I didn't know better I would suspect most of these reviews are the usual friends and family pump-up."}
{"text":"Have loved this restaurant since the first time I ever ate here. I own a salon in the area and can say that Il Bosco is responsible for feeding us multiple days out of the week. Love the changing specials and charm of the quaint atmosphere. Staff is friendly and accommodating, but not overly intrusive. Love the caprese panini and the biaggo pizza! All the food is extremely fresh and always tasty."}
{"text":"My wife and I love this place. The pizzas are cooked perfectly and topped with creative and very tasty toppings. Each one has a story.  Ask the owner. All of the staff are very friendly and helpful. Our new favorite place!"}
{"text":"Great hidden gem. Delicious wood oven cooked pizzas. Nice, small lunch menu and very fair prices, about $7-$8 for a lunch sized 8 inch pizza.   To add to experience, the owner and staff are incredibly friendly and welcoming.   Well worth a visit."}
{"text":"The pizza is very cheesy and delicious. Their sodas are just fresh and amazing. The owner Bill is very nice. The whole place is very comforting. If possible, I would rate this place 933 stars!!!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing Pizza!  We ordered 8 pizza's and there was not a slice left.  Even the kids had great things to say.  The service was awesome.  When we are back in Scottsdale we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Delicious! Everything!! Pizza, salad, wine, olives & people! Wood fired pizza wedding was perfect from start to finish and would highly highly recommend! Owner Bill Forest made us feel like family so, of course, anniversaries will be celebrated here too! If you're looking for that JUST right feel & flavor for your big event .... il bosco!"}
{"text":"Food was great but what happened?! Service started off amazing then plummeted. No matter how the food is, it's not worth being treated like that. Will never be going back."}
{"text":"I live in Chicago. I've visited Rome. I don't dream about places like I do Il Bosco. I'm not a chit-chatty person, but I always find myself wanting to talk to the owner. Everyone that works here makes the experience impeccable. You really can't go wrong with any pizza here, my favorite is probably the Carmela. Also, if you ask the owner he'll make this salsa cheese dip (pictured in my photos. Please go out of your way and ask, he makes it and is never annoyed with the request. This is hands down the best place in all of Phoenix/Scottsdale for pizza and I feel strongly about that statement."}
{"text":"Super sweet and attentive (without being overly attentive) service and fabulous food - we had the caprese, kale caesar and the kids had plain pepperoni pizza - we had the sausage and onion (dee-lish)!  And the beers were amazing! Pleasantly surprised at how wonderful this restaurant was.  Outdoor seating was the perfect temperature at 6pm-ish in April!"}
{"text":"Excellent food. Very small seating area and eccentric owner, but this actually makes the experience so unique. Not your run-of-the-mill pizza place. Very authentic brick oven pizza. I go often with my family."}
{"text":"Some of the best homemade family-style pizza you could ask for is right here in the heart of Scottsdale.  Everything here is made with extreme attention to detail and the staff exudes this sense of family and graciousness in everything they make. Truly a mom and pop restaurant that's worth visiting again and again.   Don't forget to ask for their amazing crème brûlée from their dessert menu, this stuff blows franchise restaurant Crème brûlée's  out of the water and then top it with fresh fruit of the day."}
{"text":"After scouring the United States to find the best pies, I would go on a limb to say that Il Bosco is within the Top 5 Pizzerias in the Nation! The sauce, the cheese, the quality of the toppings, and, most notably the crust, are all exactly what you'd expect from a proper thin crust pizza. If you live in the Phoenix area, don't eat pizza from any other restaurant until you get your butt to Scottsdale to try this place out. If you're visiting Phoenix from somewhere else, you need to try out this joint. It's truly a hidden gem."}
{"text":"Delicious find that we discovered after tailing a pizza oven on wheels (turned out Il Bosco was catering an event in our neighborhood). Start g from the fabulous in-house brined olives to the delectable bread to the fabulous roasted rappinni & garlic to the cheese salsa the the amazing pizzas, this place in an undiscovered scottsdale treasure! Just remember it is closed in the month of July, so get there soon!"}
{"text":"Who said that a great pizza has to be done with imported ingredients? California grown tomatoes, and local ingredients make this an amazing Italian style pizza. Checked by an a Italian born and raised in Italy now living in New York"}
{"text":"Best pizza I've had since I moved to Phoenix six years ago. Super friendly staff very friendly and the best part of it all is it is family owned. In addition to the pizza we had the caprese which was delicious and the creme brûlée. Definitely a must if in the area!"}
{"text":"Open for lunch! My first time here I want with a group of girls from the office. Upon walking in the place is super cozy and welcoming. The owner greeted us right away. He began telling us about the restaurant and gave us great suggestions about what to order.  We had two pizzas and a sandwich to share. The steak sandwich was ridiculously good! The pizzas were just the right size for one person and the crust was awesome. The homemade olives are so good as well! They even have unique sodas in glass bottles. I am loving this place and the price for lunch is great too!  You have to check out this hidden gem, but don't take my seat!"}
{"text":"It is not often that you run across a hidden gem such as this during the weekly business travels.  Today I did just that.  I stumbled into Il Bosco Pizza in Scottsdale, AZ.  I was greeted at the door by the owner/ Bill Forrest.  I received nothing but wonderful hospitality throughout my dining experience from both Bill and Barbara as well as some entertaining dialog with the kitchen team (a penquin tattoo, really?). The wine list was well thought out with very reasonable by the glass and bottle prices.  The menu selection was focused.  By that I mean, it stayed true to what they do and they do it well.  Too often you find the restaurant that wants to be everything to everybody.  Not here.  They do pizza very well.  I have traveled to Italy many times in my career and this place nails it.  Great dough coupled with the finest of ingredients, prepared in a minimalist style that lets the food do the talking.  I am truly impressed.  I will be back often.  I hope for Bill and Barbara that this is a hit but deep down I love the hidden gem.   If you are a foodie and love food without pretense, you will love Il Bosco.  This is a foodie find.  I am a chef and I absolutely love this place.  You will not be disappointed.   Cheers,"}
{"text":"Weather was beautiful so we sat outside.  Great service and the pizza was very flavorful.  The restaurants uses quality ingredients from the organic flour, simple yet tasteful tomatoes for the sauce, and olive oil.   The pizzas are simple yet packed with flavor.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We will absolutely be going back! I had the patate pizza, my son had the mussels  and my husband had a pizza that had sausage and peppers on it (sorry I can't remember the name of that one). Seriously good food, all the way around. Normally we are Pita Jungle nuts and we will always love that place, too -- but now there's a wonderful alternative next door. GREAT JOB GUYS!"}
{"text":"This was our second time eating here, but it will definitely not be our last!  We had the pizza again, and it was excellent.  This place also has Italian beers and craft sodas.    It's a nice, welcoming divey place, where you really feel comfortable.  And the prices are very reasonable, especially for such premium wood-fired pizza."}
{"text":"Great service, great spot and great pizza. Fresh ingredients, the real deal oven, the professional service. I went for lunch, but will definitely come back for dinner."}
{"text":"Saturday afternoon. Went in with a party of 5. Actually, you know what, I'm just going to cut to the chase. The entire party thought the service was surprisingly rude and the pizzas were all incredibly salty.  The dessert spumoni (why did we bother), was an over frozen artificial tasting chocolate covered block of ice cream.   Maybe a bad day for the business, but a terrible experience for me."}
{"text":"The pizza is awesome. Its like a Neapolitan -- smaller round with a softer crust. We also had their seasonal vegetables, which were roasted brussel sprouts with burrata and balsamic. To drink We had prosecco and Moretti on tap. We were very pleased with everything, from food to service to ambiance (reggae playlist, ftw). I hope to visit again soon. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Quickly becoming a favorite spot. Nice patio, great pizza! My favorite is the Gisella - pepperoni and jalapeño."}
{"text":"Pizza  is amazing! Elana Pizza is the perfect balance of sweet savory and salt. Definitely a must try. Meatballs are better than my Nona's and best I've had. Menu is compact but everything is excellent!!!"}
{"text":"Great fun pizzas. Good wine. Would give 5 stars if service was better to ask about a second glass!"}
{"text":"I have now eaten here several times and the service as well as the food has been top notch. I only wish they had a slightly more diverse menu, but that is not a deal killer for us. We love their pizza and my wife enjoys several of the other dishes. I nice find in Scottsdale that I highly recommend for anyone looking to dine in a nice comfy Italian bistro style restaurant. Great job guys!!!"}
{"text":"We ordered take-out from Il Bosco last night and was extremely pleased with the food but also the service. I wasn't expecting much since it was almost closing time and from my experience with other places is that the employees usually want to get out of there so theres attitude or a sense of being rushed to get me out the door, but when I arrived to pick up my order, the owned greeted me with such a cool calm and collected demeanor which  was such a pleasure, he even helped me carry my food and walked me out to my car. The place itself had a great atmosphere, I can see myself and my husband coming back to eat in next time! I would definitely recommend this place to my friends and family!"}
{"text":"Seasoned Phoenix/Scottsdale area diners know the usuals when it comes to great pizza: Bianco, Cibo, Pomo....Il Bosco deserves to join that list.   They serve pizza cooked in a wood-burning oven. Each pie (only one size here) spends about 90 seconds to two minutes in the oven. The result is fantastic. What separates great pizza from good? The crust. And the crust at Il Bosco is the right combination of the three Cs: char, crisp and chew that you can only achieve with an extremely hot pizza oven. If you judge your pizza on the crust, first and foremost, as I do, you'll love this place.  Of course, pizza is more than simply great crust. Pizza varieties, all named after women, should be enough to please everyone. Il Bosco offers a good variety of red and white pies. I didn't try any of the white pies yet, but they looked very good. I can heartily recommend the following red pies: Joanna, Elana and Lucia. Elana was my personal favorite, with mozzarella, olives and sopressata salami.   Beverages are somewhat limited, but that doesn't mean you'll be disappointed. Bottles of wine are affordable. The Italian Pinot Noir was excellent at $25 for the bottle. They also have two types of beer on tap, Four Peaks Kilt Lifter and an Italian brand I cannot recall. Soft drinks include cane-sweetened colas and root beers.  Dessert options were also limited, likely because the pizza is so good most don't have room for dessert. The creme brule was topped with fresh fruit (strawberries and blueberries). The flavor was quite good, but I felt like it should have had a thicker layer of burnt sugar.  The size of the restaurant adds to its charm. By my approximation, it seats no more than two dozen diners at one time. Bill, the owner, was working with just two employees Saturday night. At times the action became frenetic, but they worked with a smile, and were never too busy to engage in conversation. Despite the fact that there were people waiting to be seated, we never felt rushed.  Get here before the AZ Republic reviews this place. Because the line will be out the door once the word is out!"}
{"text":"This is the finest pizza in Scottsdale and maybe all of Arizona. You're crazy if you don't come here and have a dinner. Service is wonderful and you can sit out door on the patio."}
{"text":"We have been to Il Bosco a number of times. Hands down the best Gluten-free pizza in Scottsdale. Love that they use organic ingredients, Fresh toppings and great pizza combinations, not to mention the lovely outdoor, courtyard dining. Well paired wine list enhances the meal."}
{"text":"As an Italian with high expectations in this area of food, I went into this restaurant with high expectations. In doing so I look for two primary concepts in a restaurant, the food itself and the environment. Bosco Pizza implemented both the food and environment excellently.  Environment: Once I walked into the restaurant I immediately felt welcomed. I was hit with the aroma of the Italian pizza as well as a welcoming environment from the owner himself named Bill. While the restaurant was completely full, he managed to get the five of us a table within five minutes. Once we received our table, Bill was incredibly friendly and the restaurant itself gave off a social vibe to it. I was incredibly impressed by the look of the interior design. It was small, yet filled with more than one would expect from an Italian restaurant. There were multiple unique decorations and the specials of the day labeled clearly near the kitchen. When we ordered the food, Bill was incredibly informative as well as clear of the kind of food we may want to order. We had a friend who was dairy free and he was clear on what she may enjoy as well.  Food: I was thoroughly impressed by the menu. There were a myriad of options and unique menu items. I order a pizza called the Biaggia. This masterpiece of a pizza consisted of prosciutto, fig jam, goat cheese, and arugala. At first bite my taste buds were hit with a plethora of flavors without being overwhelmed. While it was on the expensive side for the amount served, I was given a great return in flavor. If I was to give a complaint, it would be that I wish it was a larger serving. With this said, one should know coming in that Italian pizza is thin crusted and generally served for one or two people.  TL;DR With this said, I would highly encourage anyone to try II Bosco Pizza. This restaurant has combined both environment and the food itself for a masterful combo in order to provide the most excellent dining experience. I rarely give five stars, but this restaurant greatly exceeded my expectations. I will be returning soon.  (The pizzas are named after the owner's acquaintances)"}
{"text":"Superb service, food ! Eat local!!! Casual, indoor/outdoor seating,  Restaurant full of great decor,  character, very cozy, friendly, warm, what more can I say!!!"}
{"text":"I cannot recommend this place enough. The food, staff and location are fantastic. Quaint but very happy and the salads and pizza are fantastic. Their prices are so reasonable you can afford to come often - and should .  We are visiting from out of town and found this place on Yelp. Great find!"}
{"text":"I am a Chicago born and raised pizza lover . I have had many Brick Oven pizza's. Found most to be ok. I am in the valley for several weeks. I decided to give II Bosco Pizza a try. It's location was easy to find and it is a small and inviting. I walked in and was greeted by the owner and I took a seat at the counter which gives you a great view of the Kitchen.I ordered a Caprese Salad and the Biaggia Pizza.  The Menu is small but easy to navigate. My server was friendly and from Chicago as well. The salad came and it was like no other caprese salad I have had including Italy. Fresh Mozzarella along with Barrata Mozzarella which has a creamy center topped with airloom tomatoes dizzled Balsamic and a light touch of pesto. it was served with olives cured in house with several slices of in house made bread. I watched my Pizza being made and it was timed perfectly to arrive just as I finished my salad. The Biaggia Pizza might sound odd but it will be the most AMAZING experience you will have in your pizza eating experience. The dough has a slight wheat taste that compliments the fig jam which is lightly spread on the dough, then goat cheese is added baked to perfection. the pizza is cut and topped with prosciutto slices  on each piece and topped with arugula and evo dizzled on top and some custom house mixture of grated cheese.   You must try this  6 Star Pizza Restaurant. You will not be disappointed by the Food, Service, and Price. It is a valley hidden treasure."}
{"text":"We love everything about il bosco..the food is first rate, and delicious . Not too pricey. The owner is terrific..friendly and accommodating. Our go to pizza choice!"}
{"text":"First time customer and will be back. Good Caesar salad and 2 delicious pizzas. Met the owner (very kind) and they placed the pizzas in the oven so they were hot after baking for 2 minutes. Tasteful and they have a family that will return."}
{"text":"Great addition to the cookie cutter North Scottsdale food scene.  No better pizza anywhere in the country.  My wife and I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I generally don't write reviews after 1 visit unless things were really great or really horrible. I had seen this place on yelp and it was pretty highly rated and I had a cousin visiting from out of town so I thought, pizza, why not, lets try Il Bosco!  We walked in the door and we were immediately greeted by \"we have no room\" from a white haired man named Bill (who I later deduced was the owner because he had his tweenage son working there as well). Hi to you too!   Alas he found us some space at the bar. I set my things down at the bar, and I happened to have a bottle of water with me that I didn't want to leave to roast in the car because it's Phoenix in July and that would be a waste. I had every intention of ordering a drink. He confiscated my bottle of water and placed it behind his counter, looked at me like I was some sort of village idiot and asked me if I brought my own food in for him to cook, too. I was dumbfounded. He only returned the water after my mom insisted she would put it away.   After reviewing the menu I ordered the Elana pizza without salami, as my cousins requested. Again, I got the you're-an-idiot face from Bill, and a \"you just want a pizza with olives?\" Why yes, sir, is that gonna be okay with you? I'm freakin paying aren't I? He did seem to be very friendly with customers that he knew or were regulars. Sorry you didn't give us that chance.   I was literally OVERWHELMED by the condescension. And then to add the icing on the cake he kept coming by to make sure everything was great and acted all reverent and friendly when we got done and were leaving. Its too freaking bad, Bill. Because Brent(?) and Gerardo and even your son Max were all lovely human beings and the pizza was pretty good too.   But if I wanna feel like an idiot I'll take a calculus class, not come to your pizza joint. Wont be returning."}
{"text":"I love finding little Phoenix gems. il Bosco did not disappoint. There were fresh herbs growing on the patio and wood being put in the fire. The menu was very small, but the prices were good for the size of the pizzas. You could tell that the pizza ingredients were fresh and top notch. The place is very small but feels cozy."}
{"text":"Best pizza in AZ!!!!! Having been from the east coast, I know pizza quite well. And during my 5 years living out there, this was hands down my spot! The owner is very friendly and his product is reminiscent of the pizza I got back in NY!!!"}
{"text":"I am an Italian who has travelled the world and has been a high level chef for 40 years. This is \"hands down, the best pizza\"! I judge pizza on 3 things: crust, sauce and cheese. Il Bosco is the only place that I have awarded 5 stars to all 3.  Extremely quaint & charming. I love that it is kind of hidden. My only suggestion would be for more consistent, knowledgeable service staff."}
{"text":"This is some seriously good pizza!  We read the reviews on Yelp, and gave it a shot last night.  We called in our order, and the staff was very friendly on the phone, and explained that they would not put the pizzas in the oven until we got their, so that they would be fresh and hot for us to eat.  We got the Dona and the Biaggia.  I was worried that they would be tiny after some of the reviews, but they were both a decent size and bursting with flavor.  I was a little reluctant to try fig on a pizza, but the previous reviews told me I had to.  It's a winner!  If you have not gone here yet, give it a shot.  Very excellent pizza for not a lot of dough!"}
{"text":"This delightfully charming pizzeria has impeccable food and superb service. I live in Los Angeles but make a point to come here each time I'm in town. There's a darling patio with heaters in the cool months; the indoor dining space is rather small, but it's part of the charm.   If you're not making reservations (only taken for parties of 6 or more) you might have a little wait, but not to fear - you can have an Italian beer or nice glass of wine at the bar, and you'll probably make friends with the regulars sitting to your left...and right. This place is popular, and for good reason. The quality is unparalleled, and yet the owner is as humble as can be. Tonight I watched a Postmates guy wait for the pizzas he was delivering. The staff made him at home with some ice water and a dish of their signature olives; how very charming, I thought."}
{"text":"I don't get it.  Highest rated restaurant in this area??  Do not be suckered.  Service was poor with zero personality.  No water was served or even offered.  Wine served in a cheap juice glass.  Only two beers on the menu, two.  Oily Caesar.  Pizza was okay.  People review this place like they've never had a wood fired pizza before.  Trust me, go to il Capo up the street for a better experience in every way.  Or even Gramaldi's.  Yelpers, you are often right on, but you let us down this time."}
{"text":"Simply the best pizza!  We have been frequenting this AMAZING find since relocating from Charleston, SC where we left behind our much beloved EVO.  Il Bosco never disappoints!  The service is warm, personable and top notch!  And the pizza !!!  We adore the caprese salad, any pizza on the menu and dessert here is a must... the warm brownie with ice cream is to die for!  Our southern hearts have found a new pizza haven in Il Bosco!"}
{"text":"Went here for my birthday and had a great time. Only negative was they ran out of bread and our server had obviously not been serving long. The pizza is by far the best in the state!"}
{"text":"Phoenix is a pretty good pizza town, and this place is definitely in the middle of the pack. Nothing really bad about it, but not much stands out either. Honestly, I think my favorite bites were the complimentary starter olives.   My friend and I split an order of fried ravioli and a margherita pizza which was plenty of food, and our whole tab was only $20. The ravioli was fine, but again, nothing remarkable. I liked the pizza, but I felt adding a little red pepper and parm helped the flavor. At better places, I don't have to do that.  I wasn't particularly happy with our server because he was very condescending when I told him we needed our check right away because we were late for a movie. He said, \"You know, no one in history has ever been late for a movie because they were eating at a restaurant.\" Then he proceeded taking his sweet time getting our check and making change. Prior to that exchange, he was much more pleasant."}
{"text":"Needed to find a new lunch place in Scottsdale so I searched YELP..found this one and we tried it..   Very charming little spot. We ate outside and that was absolutely pleasant! Asked what to have and we were recommended to have the Biaggia. (Fig, prosciutto, arugula oh my..!) it was perfectly devine.   Prices were perfect for the individual sized wood fired pizza. Def going to go again! We have been looking for a good wood fired pizza with similarities to the el Vicino Pizzas(CO) styles. yaaaa :)"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious. I thought I was teleported to Italy! Excellent service and food. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great dinner!! 15 years in the f&b business and this will be my most favorite spot going forward. Everything from the house brined olives to the amazing pizzas. Everything has the authentic touch were missing in Scottsdale. We will be back so often"}
{"text":"Il Bosco has nearly 300 awesome reviews for a reason.   The pizza is tremendous in every way. Everything is homemade and you can tell from the vivid flavors.   Mr. Forrest and his family operate this gem and are nothing short of wonderful. Having a meal here is like going to a good friend's home for a relaxing, perfect meal. The ambiance is warm and cozy, the music is on point- the service is spot on, and again- the food is epic.     It's worth noting that they also do a great job with takeout. Simply place your phone order ahead of time- and when you arrive they will fire your pie- and two minutes later you're out the door.  One other thing I must highlight is the bread you get with dinner. If you are a bread aficionado- you will flip out when you try their house made bread. It's incredible and they would be a successful bakery if all they did was sell that bread.   The location is great and they also have a lovely patio for dining when the weather doesn't feel like the surface of the sun.   Give this wonderful spot a try. I have tried all the \"best\" in AZ and I unequivocally rate Il Bosco #1.  Try it and you will too.    *Bonus pro tip- if you have leftover pizza, for the love of God don't reheat it in your microwave. Either reheat in the oven or fire up your BBQ for a quick warm up. You'll thank me."}
{"text":"Unexpectedly great.  Ate outside and listened to live country music from the bar next door.  Fantastic food, friendly service."}
{"text":"Il Bosco is my favorite pizza place in the valley!  I have been to all the ones you know and all the ones that your friends tell you about with glowing eyes having just been to some great new hidden pizza place that they think they have just discovered. Let me know tell you, none of them compare.   It's a cosy place where you feel like family. The Canadian owner is super friendly as are all the servers. You are served some delicious olives which you can buy a jar of to take home. I prefer the Lucia pizza which normally has sausage and mushrooms but I get with pepperoni and mushrooms instead. The pizzas are all wood fired and when you take a bite you feel like you are in Naples instead of Scottsdale. My friend gets the Biaggia which is their prosciutto and argula pizza and if that is your thing this is where you want to come. It is so well balanced with the fig jam and earthy.   Go to Il Bosco! You will love it, scout's honor!"}
{"text":"Great little spot. Service is killer. Great variety of unique pies. Or traditional if you want. You can tell they use the best and freshest ingredients. In all honesty, I can't believe there isn't a line out the door."}
{"text":"This is great small italian restaurant. It's very small but has a nice feel to it. The food is excellent."}
{"text":"Very good pizza in a small restaurant that also does catering.  The owner is a nice guy who really cares about service and the quality of his food.  We will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"My husband and I first learned about Il Bosco when they were catering a friend's party. I thought the mobile wood fired oven was a great idea. It was parked in the driveway, and the pizzas were served up fresh.   Since then, we've visited the restaurant numerous times. We usually go for lunch as the 8 inch size pizza is just right. All of the toppings are good. The crust is super. It's crispy on the outside and tender inside. The fresh made dough has a good taste, too. It is as close to the pizza in Italy as we've found.  The owner, Bill, is usually there. His hospitality is great, too. There is a nicely arranged patio up front. t's a small, friendly local place. Try it!"}
{"text":"Yes! Yes! Yes! Pizza. Service and an authentically wonderful owner.   Why haven't you been here yet?"}
{"text":"We love wood fired pizza restaurants and this one was quaint.  The owner and staff were great. We were asking the owner a ton of questions about the place, food, etc and he was very generous with his time. The pizzas were really good, sausage good, cheese was yummy. The bread, also made from the pizza dough was nice and crusty with a chewy center. The caprese salad was grape tomatoes with fresh mozzarella and a nice surprise, burrata. Very fresh and good.  He grows his own herbs too.  This is a must try!"}
{"text":"I have been a patron of Il Bosco for a while. Being an X New Yorker I love pizza and noisy restaurants.  I have noticed that Il Bosco hardly ever has hardly any patrons in the restaurant.  The wine pours are very small and that bothers me ($8.50-$10.00) for a 4-ounce pour.  Some of the appetizers are quite tasty but recently the Cesar Salad (twice) has been tasteless. The pizzas are always tasty.  The restaurant looks old and tired, I believe this is a major turnoff to visitors and is a reason the place is never busy.  Basically, it lacks any atmosphere and character of an expensive restaurant.  Plus there is lots of noise from next door from a cowboy bar which is very annoying if you eat outside.  The bottom line, good pizza but when you drop $50-$70 for dinner expectations are not met. I hope the owner totally renovates or moves and builds an upscale place.  It will drastically improve the image and make him more profitable."}
{"text":"This wonderful hideaway has truly gourmet wood fired pizza, fresh salads and a very nice wine list.  The staff is attentive and personable. The owner takes an active and engaged role in the establishment. The bread and olive standard appetizer is a scrumptious treat!  The patio is beautiful at night (too sunny during the day) with a casual elegance perfect for an Arizona supper."}
{"text":"Great decor, bright and open.  Wood fire pizza oven is right in front of you.  Ingredients are high quality and the owner Bill is a really great guy.  The prosciutto, fig and goat cheese pizza was amazing.  Also, the housemade burrata was incredible.  They just installed a herb garden out on the patio.    I used to frequent this place when it was a previous business and owner.  It is completely flipped the mood of the environment and is a great new addition to the neighborhood.  We plan to frequent and often.    Don't ask if they are going to be open to the wee hours as in the past businesses.  It's not gonna happen.  Nice."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Scottsdale! Authentic and quick with good service."}
{"text":"Thoroughly enjoyed our Mushroom/Sausage and Basil pizzas accompanied with Moretti draft and Pino Grigio.   Capped off the great meal with the Chocolate Chip Cookie Ice Cream desert.   AWESOME.  Thanks Bill (owner).   We will be back often!"}
{"text":"Been there twice for lunch. First time was pizza. Second time sandwitch.   The menu is inexpensive, however you dont get much. These are light faire. No stars taken off for that, just letting you all know that a pizza here is about a slice and a half by weight compared to a normal 18\" pie. For me to get full I ordered a salad $6 and entre $6. You might be a smaller eater and get either or. The execption on pricing is the beverages. I ordered one ice tea and was unpleasantly surprised when I saw the bill for it was $5.75. EDIT: The ice tea was 2.75 and the tap water my coworker ordered was 3.00."}
{"text":"The owner was our waiter and he was very nice. He even started the deep fryer so we could have fried ravioli even though it was lunchtime and they usually only serve that at dinner. The ravioli and pizza were excellent and prices reasonable."}
{"text":"Awesome restaurant! The pizza is so delicious and the service was fabulous! Judith was such a fun waitress and Bill (the owner) was very attentive and extremely friendly. Would go back in a flash."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of rustic, delicious pizza and Il Bosco is \"winning\"!  In the same style as Pizzaria Bianco and Pizza-a-Metro, this place is small, intimate and does pizza the best way.   Totally worth the visit."}
{"text":"OMG! Pizza heaven. I just had my first pizza here and it has jumped to the top of my list. Similar style to Pomo or Bianco but something about this one....crust was just perfect. Toppings not overly done so you can taste each ingredient. Friendly staff and a nice , cozy setting. Will be back soon!  Joanna , I love you ....."}
{"text":"I love this place. Starting with the ambiance, which is small, dark, cozy, and Italian, I was impressed. We came on a cool rainy night and sat at the bar, right in front of the wood-fired oven, and the owner made friendly conversation with us the whole time.  We split the Biaggia (prosciutto, goat cheese, fig spread, EVOO) and the Dona (mozzarella, pancetta, roma tomatoes, parmesan, and tomato sauce). The crust was perfectly chewy and had a slightly sweet flavor, which I love. The toppings were fresh and high-quality. I just wish we had more room, because we also really wanted to order the egg and pancetta pizza. Next time... and there will be a next time!!!"}
{"text":"The place is cozy and the owner is typically the server which is great.  Loved the varieties of pizza, amazing flavor from someone who knows how to make a great pie."}
{"text":"Had the pleasure of dining at il Bosco last night for my birthday and just wanted to share how great of an experience it was. The restaurant is small and does not seat many people so we were sure to make a reservation (they only offer 2 slots each night). At the last minute, we had to add 2 more to our party which they took on with no issue at all and were able to accommodate all of us. The food is awesome, the ambiance is great, quick and friendly service. All around, this was a very authentic Italian experience at what I consider to be a fair price point. The pizzas are intended to be personal size but if you're not starving, they could definitely be shared. For dessert we tried to vanilla gelato, spumoni tortufo, and a brownie. All of them were delicious but the spumoni was definitely the winner. At the end of our meal, the owner offered us all a taste of his homemade amaretto which was fabulous. Absolutely recommend this place for anyone looking to enjoy a good, affordable, authentic Italian experience."}
{"text":"We got a Joanna pizza to go. Pizza was good. One pizza fed two adults. They are about the size of maybe a medium. Atmosphere inside was nice. I will be back."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best pizza!  Salads, meatballs, olives...you name it - everything is 5 stars here."}
{"text":"Awesome Pizza!  My favorite is the steak salad and bread, served with the olives.  Yum.  Perfect meal and I never feel heavy or overstuffed, just the right amount with great ambiance. A perfect cozy clean unassuming gem!  A mastery of sauce, bread, quality cheeses, and freshness."}
{"text":"What a wonderful experience. One of my regulars keyed me into this place and I was beyond impressed.  Friday night during prime dinner hours and we were lucky enough to get a table inside. They have lots of seating outside which would be perfect come warmer weather. For now they have heat lamps.  Service was impeccable. The owner floats around and helps his staff and enhances the dining experience (completely unlike the other review mentioned). We were brought a carafe of water, olives and bread to start. We ordered the caprese salad to start. I would eat this EVERY DAY. They use a pesto balsamic glaze that is to die for. The mozzarella is fresh and the cherry tomatoes were bursting with flavor. Next we had one of their specials, fried ravioli. Simple and tasty. Portions here are well sized without going overboard like the chain Italian restaurants do. To finish we ordered the Becca pizza, another special. The crust is delicious here and not one you would want to leave uneaten on the side of your plate.  I can't stress how fresh and wonderfully prepared everything was. I personally cannot wait to go back (did I mention how amazing the caprese salad was?!). This restaurant earns the five star rating because our experience was flawless and anyone who experienced otherwise must be mistaken."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed my meal at il Bosco pizzaria. The restaurant was small and had a quaint feel. Wood fired pizza is my favorite. I was with a group who ordered 3 pies which were all delicious. I didn't have the peppers stuffed with sausage but apparently they are \"to die for\"."}
{"text":"We come here about once a week. Hands down my favorite place in the valley and the best pizza we've ever had. Bill is always there and gives the place a great feel-most of his family works there too-rarely have we found a place like this in the US."}
{"text":"Delicious! I had a personal cheese pizza for lunch today and I loved every bite of it. The atmosphere is super cool. I loved sitting outside. The staff was very nice. It's a little far for me so I probably won't make it back again but if I did I would try to come for dinner. I bet Il Bosco is even prettier at night. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I just went back to Ct. for  the wedding of my business partner (one of the greatest events I have ever attended) and visited World Famous Pepe Pizza in New Haven, Ct. on a Sunday Night with my Mom and nephew to do a direct comparison of Bill (Scottsdale) vs. the Legend (Frank Pepe: New Haven, CT)  ...  Do a Yelp search ... Frank Pepe Pizza, New Haven, CT ... they are world famous.  Ronald Reagan and Frank Sinatra used to have pizza flown to them from New Haven, Ct. as it was so highly regarded.  When I lived in Ct, we would drive from Middletown to New Haven at least once a month.  The final results are in ... (Frank Pepe will not be happy)  Bill in Scottsdale is better (it even surprised me) ... Everyone who reads this should give Ill Bosco one try and understand that the absolute MOST delicious pizza in America is in of all places Scottsdale, Arizona and produced by someone who was once the premiere PGA Golf Coach in America (2006 PGA Golf Coach of the Year)  in a location that is virtually impossible to find.    How is this possible?  ... Most of the pizza in Arizona is sub-standard and everyone living here knows it  ...  You mention going out for pizza in Arizona and most everyone from back east figures they are going to suffer through a lousy meal.  But Bill has done something different.  In a state filled with mediocrity (or less), he has taken pizza to an art form.  You think Pizza Bianco with all their national publicity  is Number 1 in the state of Arizona ??? ... WRONG ... Yes Bianco has great pizza (i've eaten there and enjoyed it even though they have the most uncomfortable seating as everyone is packed together like sardines), but Ill Bosco is better (check the other YELP reviews to see if i am just blowing smoke).  And eating at Bill's is comfortable ... plenty of elbow room and a vibe that makes you appreciate Scottsdale ... you just want to sit and enjoy which is something very rare in 2014.  And to top it all off the owner is a Gem ... When you walk in, it's like being part of a family.  You won't be coming just once ... Give it a try ... You'll see."}
{"text":"What a great local pizza place!  Neat outside atmosphere and the kale salad and pizza was delish!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in the valley without a doubt.  Absolutely excellent, better than Biancos, Pomo and some other very good places.  Had the kale and spinach caesar with pancetta.  It was incredible.  Also had \"the Elana\", pure heaven.  So flavorful.  My new favorite place.  Open on the weekends for lunch and dinner; during the week for dinner only."}
{"text":"The very best italian pizza in Phoenix, we take everyone that comes to town here. Yum! Try the biaggia"}
{"text":"Friendly staff.  Great casual yet intimate atmosphere. Get there early! It's a small place and fills up fast.  Very accommodating to get you a table as soon as possible.  So great to find a Super T glass of wine.  Love the house made sparkling water.  Meatballs were flavorful and hearty.  Pizza had yummy fresh ingredients and sauce was perfect.  Next time I'm getting dessert!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff. Cozy restaurant with a wonderful patio. Started with olives and bread (free) and then ordered the Caprese Salad, which was wonderful and our delicious wood fired sausage pizza! Definitely will return."}
{"text":"Place is amazing!!! Pizza was the best hands down. So close to real Italian couldn't believe!! Highly recommend to try!!!"}
{"text":"We were just talking about the best pizza we've ever had and my wife and son realized they had both been here on separate occasions. Both emphatically agree it was the best pizza they have ever had ... and our family appreciates great pizza - very discerning"}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped here for dinner this evening, after reading several rave reviews on yelp.  We were not disappointed!  We had the Carmela and Joanna pizzas, both of which were fantastic.  In my husband's words, the crust/ topping combination was \"orgasmic.\" We'll definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"Watch out Pizzeria Bianco, this place is just as good without all the hastle. My wife and I shared a salad (don't remember the name but it had lots of steak in it) and a Lucia pizza for lunch. Wood fired pizza was perfect and the salad was huge. Can't beat the bread which is actually made from the pizza dough. Service was excellent. It's a small place but they do have outdoor seating. Give it a try, you will be happy"}
{"text":"The most fantastic pizza, appetizers, and lovely service.  Do not miss the homemade amaretto! Like liquid butter!  I could not be any happier! We go out every Sunday but this was by far the best Sunday meal we've had for a very very long time!"}
{"text":"Wonderful wood fire crust and great 'guenuine' sausage slice from Guido's of Chicago (in Scottsdale)....that crust with the wood fire flavor...wow!!!"}
{"text":"Really excellent thin crust pizza. Salads were good but not great. Very cozy and friendly ambiance."}
{"text":"Wow, this place is so cute and on top of that, it is delicious.  My hubby told me about this place almost a year ago and he was raving about the pizza.  Then, I have seen all the check- ins from Anna M., so I kept trying to make time to come and check it out myself.  I wish I had come sooner, although my hips and thighs might not appreciate that.  We ordered the Biaggia pizza.  I learned it is the most popular, I chose it mainly because I saw figs and prosciutto on it, two of my favorite ingredients.  Then we noticed the next table having a salad I didn't see on the menu.  Well, duh, it was in the specials.  They have daily specials on boards above the bar area.  We decided to share the spinach and kale caesar.  It was so fresh and tasty.  Then on the other table, I saw a dessert that was not on the menu either.  The owner told us it was an apple pizza, part of the special menu also.  Yes, I love to check out what everyone else is eating.  Our dessert was warm and amazing, and the scoop of vanilla  ice cream completed this perfect meal.  We were offered a taste of their homemade Amaretto.  What a treat, it was delicious.  This place made me very reminiscent of my daddy, we used to cook all our italian dishes on Sundays and my daddy used to make his own Lemoncello.  I definitely will come back and I won't wait almost a year to make it."}
{"text":"Amazing staff and authentic fire wood pizza. Fantastic outdoor patio. Catering is available. It has a cool vibe and relaxing atmosphere. It's next to Handle Bar J and is somewhat hidden. There's a good wine selection and awesome appetizers."}
{"text":"I wandered in here last week, late on a Friday evening, and found the place almost deserted.  Bill greeted me at the door, I asked if I could have a meal, and he sat me down at the bar.  Almost immediately I was impressed by the hospitality.  I looked at the menu, which is just a sheet of paper with drinks on one side, and pizzas, salads, desserts, and antipasti on the other, and found it promising.  Why?  Not because it was extensive, but rather because it was limited.  I like a place that just does a couple of things, and does those things well.  Each day there is a different pizza of the day, salad of the day, and I think antipasti of the day.  My first visit, I went with a split pizza--half Maria (pesto, garlic, and tomato) and half Biaggia (prosciutto, goat cheese, fig, maybe something else)--along with a Boylan's root beer.  The root beer turned out to actually be a Boylan's Creamy Red Birch Beer (Bill said he promises his customers this is the best root beer they'll ever have.  It's partially true, in that it's better than many root beers, but it's technically not a root beer. Get it anyways.), which was actually a nice surprise. (Boylan's Birch Beer would be even better...)  I liked the Maria, but I LOVED the Biaggia.  This was a very good pie, and based on the other reviews here, it possibly could be considered their signature pie.  On my second visit, a week later, I had the Dona, a red pizza with tomatoes and pancetta.  The pancetta was nice and crispy, and of course, delicious.  They also serve you olives while you wait; these were some of the best olives I've had.  I couldn't stop eating them.  They actually tasted fresh (well...as fresh as an olive can get, considering you have to basically wipe out their original bitter flavor when you cure them).  The best part about this restaurant is that it has the feel of a small neighborhood restaurant.  It gets busy during the dinner rush, but if you come a little later, it'll be more relaxed, and you can actually strike up a conversation with the staff.  Good pie, excellent establishment."}
{"text":"Best wood fired pizza in the Valley - my wife loves the Biaggia - I like to check the specials (last year, when they were in season, they had a Hatch Chile pizza that was the best pizza ever!).  Bianco?  Pomo?  pfffttt!  - Il Bosco!!!  Great pizza, cool vibe - check it out!"}
{"text":"We happened to stumble upon Il Bosco by chance. The service was wonderful and the food delicious. The owner made sure we were taken care of and enjoying our meal as well as our server. Very helpful with recommendations. We had the Adrianna, Biaggia, Joanna and the special of the night. All were wonderful but the Biaggia seemed to be the table favorite! I've found my new pizza place."}
{"text":"I love living in Arizona. Everything you need is within 10 minutes of each other. We were looking for a good pizza place and this little gem just might be it. It's cute and quaint and offers excellent wood fired pizza! It was cooked perfectly and had that delicious wood fired taste to it. Delicious home made pizza sauce as well.   The owner was incredibly kind and welcoming as well. He spent a lot of time talking to us and making lovely suggestions for us to explore our new city.  He really knows how to run a business and make his patrons feel comfortable.   I can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Loved the pizza and atmosphere is intimate and fun! Have the Valentina spicy with a bit of sweet it's awesome!!!"}
{"text":"We genuinely enjoyed our evening at Il Bosco, a tucked-away restaurant just off Shea and Scottsdale. The owner and staff were super friendly, the ambiance was what a good neighborhood restaurant should be (though so many aren't) and, of course, the food was great! We began with an appetizer plate of roasted brussel sprouts with mozzarella, an unexpected combination that really works! We then had the Joanna pizza, a fantastic, wood-oven, thin-crust sausage and pepperoni that had great flavor and crust. For dessert, the days special was a lemon sorbetto, packed into a real lemon, a perfect ending. I should also mention the great music selection which added quite a bit to the flavor of the evening. I'm already looking forward to the next visit!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for gourmet wood fired oven pizza, this is the place to go!  The prosciutto, fig, goat cheese, arugula pizza is absolutely delicious!"}
{"text":"Great food!! Fresh bread with perfect chewy crust! Their wood fire pizza was cooked to perfection with the crispy soft crust and perfectly charred bottom. We chose the Baggia pizza which had prosciutto, fig jam, four cheeses and arugula. Wow!! What a great combination! I love this style of pizza!! For dessert we had spumoni encased in dark chocolate. OMG!! So rich and delicious! Will certainly be back!!"}
{"text":"We had a great meal and experience at this local family run business. If your staying in the Scottsdale area this should be on your list. Awesome homemade ingredients, friendly staff and an owner who takes great pride in his pizza. Well done!"}
{"text":"I got the Joanna from here and the pizza taste as good as it looks, I give it a 10 and the customer service was outstanding and the workers were very friendly, I'll definitely be back for more"}
{"text":"This place is a bit cozy, but once you've settled in it's not very noticeable.  The set up is very shabby chic, but its clean and appealing.  The owner runs the service very well.  He was on top of all his customers' needs the whole way through, directing the kitchen and the supporting waitress and chipping in himself to make sure everything was well.  The complimentary bread looked disastrous - it was cold and looked like it was undercooked.  One bite though and it was the best Italian bread we'd ever had.  The flavor was so good.  The caesar salad was also excellent.  We had the mushroom and sausage pizza, which unfortunately was burnt.  It was a bit bitter, or else we probably would've eaten the whole pizza.  The red pepper flakes were super flavorful which I appreciated a lot - most places' flakes are stale and doesn't provide this much kick.    So usually the burnt pizza at a pizza place would definitely lose a star or two, but I can't help but love this place.  The owner was so nice, and even gave us some homemade amaretto that was off the charts.  It was great on our dessert of chocolate covered ball of chocolate, pistachio and strawberry gelatos.  The hospitality of the place, the quality of the food and service, and the set up of the place are why I'm a super fan of this restaurant.  I'm hoping the pizza will be good next time too!"}
{"text":"We were welcomed by Bill the moment we walked into this cute pizzeria. The caprese  salad was outstanding as were the meatballs. I had the prosciutto, fig, and goat cheese pizza. Amazing. Give this place a try. You will be happy you did."}
{"text":"Oh how I love pizza and this place was just great!  The space is cozy and really comfortable, the staff is amazing - we had the opportunity to talk to the super friendly and knowledgeable owner - and the pizza ranks up there as some of the best in Phoenix.  If you like hand crafted pizza, definitely check this place out!"}
{"text":"I appreciate when I have been to a place and  they # 1 remember my name, #2 thank me for my business and #3 give me the same excellent product every single time I come in. As I told them, my daughter may rip into the box the second I picked her up, 30 minutes away and she did! I called her and said I had a surprise! She got in the car, saw a science experiment kit...long face.then her nose ever so slightly caught a quaffed of what? what? \" Is that Il Bosco?!!!\" in the highest pitch thrill. \"Pull  over! Pull Over!!\" I said, \" Roll down your window\" in my best Corleone voice,\"Pizza Delivery is yours\"..so as we sat along Osborn and devoured pizza, her inside, me out. A sense of complete sublime bliss was the picture I foretold. As I said before, I am not a pizza girl, but there is something about the encumbrance of Il Bosco pizza that I needed tonight. They had no idea that I would be sitting and watching and weeping to a cancer benefit on TV, because of family and friends and Taylor and Ronan. Yet I picked their pizza to comfort me. The Biaggati)?) Salty and Sweet and different  and wonderfully complex yet  simple in crust. l  know this was without doubt the exact comfort I needed and will yearn for  because of all of  the above mentioned reasons.  It heats up perfectly at home, and although you may not have the same charm as being at Il Bosco in person, you have the same love ensconsed in their box of pizza pie."}
{"text":"It was ok. Ex New Yorker, like the pizza.  Small wine pours, limited menu,waiter a bit unpleasant...when finished seemed like they wanted us out of there quickly. Not impressed. Music next door not great. Probably won't go back."}
{"text":"This is so good. All good pizza and every thing on the menu is meant to be there. Great hipster soda and great service. Go here!"}
{"text":"Delicious food, excellent beverages, and employees that become your friends during dining experience!"}
{"text":"I had worked around the corner from this cute place for years, and for some reason everyone at my work raved about it... and I never went! Fast forward to a couple weeks ago, when I was craving a good pizza, but didn't want to make that infamous drive/wait in downtown Phx.   Me and my best gal showed up, and were promptly seated for dinner on a Thursday with little to no crowd around 6 PM (that quickly changed). We started with water and some delicious olives, and moved onto to the pizza... Let me tell you, if I could have one pizza for three meals a day, it would be the Valentina. Sweet/spicy-all in one. You NEED this in your life.   I woke up the next morning so sad we didn't order two pizzas and have leftovers honestly. So if I could change one thing, it would be that! Also, the owner is ridiculously sweet and stopped by the table. I will be back, and telling everyone about this place!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic pizza! Hand stretched dough, house made ingredients, wood fired deliciousness! Staff is attentive and genuine! The space is cozy and its just the kind of restaurant I like to eat in. A true local business!"}
{"text":"Just had our first pizzas from Bosco. Great pies, great flavor. Nice people too. Only dissapointment was the Ceaser salad. Overpriced for a simple small dinner salad."}
{"text":"Just the best. Fantastic owners/chefs/staff.  Delicious, fresh & such an intimate little setting.  I'd recommend their pizza to anyone - it's SO good!!!"}
{"text":"We've been searching for a quality pizza place for a while, and this weekend, we found it in Il Bosco! The owner, Bill, waited our table himself and was so friendly, attentive and conversational. You can tell that he and the staff take a lot of pride in the quality of their food!   We elected to sit inside, which seemed to be the right choice, since the music next door was pretty loud and could have easily overwhelmed the outdoor seating area. The place was small, but quite cozy with a great view of the food preparation and pizza oven. Seriously, I watched that oven, and nothing sat in the window for more than a minute before it hit a table (impressive!!)   We started with some of the most tender, delicious meatballs I've had, sopping up the delicious marinara with our fresh, hot bread. Sooo good! We went for the Carmela pizza and both loved it!!! The ingredients were of very high, fresh quality, and it was piping hot! The wine was okay ($9 a glass is a little high for table wine in my opinion), but they kept our glasses full and we loved it! I hope to save some room for spumoni next time... Give this place a try! (They also offer take out if you're more interested in pick-up pizza!)"}
{"text":"food was good place was quaint and fills up fast so go early or extra late. we all tried different pizzas which are fire baked, was it the best pizza ever no... but definitely worth another visit"}
{"text":"Excellent service, quaint, adorable ambience, and wonderful food!!   I was greeted by an incredibly kind manager who took me to my table and also checked back twice throughout our meal. Our server (I wish I could remember her name!) gave excellent, thoughtful service and went above and beyond to accommodate our requests.   The entire staff works like a team - anyone who brought us plates or drinks was equally as friendly and attentive. This is a great little gem in North Scottsdale definitely worth checking out.   I especially recommend it for date night on the patio - very romantic and intimate setting. I look forward to coming back!"}
{"text":"Excellent! My husband and I are visiting from NM and had heard great things about Il Bosco. We were not disappointed! Jered our server was attentive, knowledgeable, and answered all my questions about the menu. My husband got the Lucia pizza with tomato sauce, mushrooms, cheese, and sausage. The mushrooms were small and quartered, which really added to their flavor. I got the Adrianna pizza with tomato sauce, cheese, and chiffonade basil. Both pizza's were delicious and the crust is to die for! We'd never had such wonderful crust on a brick oven pizza. It was crispy and chewy, absolutely perfect! I had the lemon sorbeto for dessert and it was wonderful! We will definitely be back to this wonderful pizza joint."}
{"text":"In the area and felt like pizza.  This place had a good rating so we tried it.  Had the kale and spinach salad.  It was good, not a big fan of kale.  Also had the fried ravioli which was ok.  It was on special so wet tried it.   My wife and I both had a pizza.  We should have shared one as they were bigger than we thought.    We actually had a whole pie to take home.   The service was great, they keep on top of where we were with our meal and timed the pizza to arrive when we finished the ravioli and salad.   I definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Great pizza cooked in a coal fire oven.  Light crust, great ingredients and they wait till you get there to fire the pizzas.  Perfection!  What I would love to see is a Margherita with bufalo mozzarella on the menu!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, great service.  Authentic Neapolitan style pizza.  You can hear the live music from The Handlebar next door - if you're OK with Country/Western while eating Italian food, that is.  Not the very best old world style pizza \"I've\" ever had, but it's pretty good - and very good for Scottsdale, which can get a bit tourist-centric.  Very good."}
{"text":"First time to Il Bosco and I was not disappointed. We shared a Calabrese salad and the pizza special. It was a perfect amount of food for two and delicious. The timing of delivering the pizza to our table was great as was the consistency - no soggy middle like you get other places. The proprietor was friendly and helped us make good choices. The spot is cozy and their brick oven catering looks phenomenal."}
{"text":"If you have not been here it is a must try! The food is incredible and the owner is great. The restaurant itself is small and the outside is nothing fancy but once you try the food you will understand what is so special about this place!"}
{"text":"We love this place. I have been working on and off in Scottsdale for the past 5 years. I always try to find a night on each trip to take a pizza or two out for dinner. Friendly people, great wood fired pizza and always done to perfection!"}
{"text":"Found this place on yelp and was amazed by all the five star reviews. Finally went in last week with the wife and sat at the bar.   Food was great. We had the two pizzas. One was the fig and arugula and one was red sauce with pancetta. Both were great. I'm picky about pizza crust and this place nails it.  The owner seemed super nice added to a great experience. Looking forward to going back to try other pizzas!"}
{"text":"Small yet perfect. I always worry if there will be room for me but some how there always is. I love this food! I love this restaurant! I get the Mia pizza, its heavy but it is so good. They have a wonderful small staff. Food to go and food there, both are amazing!"}
{"text":"Awesome pizza! We will definitely be back when we come back to Arizona. Being from North Dakota we don't have a ton of good restaurants so this place will be on our list for future visits! The owner was super nice and the patio seating was great. The crust on the pizza was perfectly toasted to perfection and it had some amazing sausage and Italian bacon!"}
{"text":"Really good pizza try the Carmela and lucia. Don't forget to order the cesar salad best ever. Not the classic pizza something really good made wood fire"}
{"text":"Your standard Neapolitan pizza set up that gets a couple of bonus points for its mobility and flair for getting creative with their pies."}
{"text":"I loved everything about Il Bosco from the food to the atmosphere but did not appreciate it when the man serving us rolled his eyes at me when I asked to sample a wine. Now had this been a server who hated his job, I could've shrugged it off but this man was the OWNER. Then after I enjoyed it enough to order a glass, he forgot to bring it to me (we were one of two tables on a Tuesday night). This is why I'm giving three stars instead of four, possibly five. You can't skip out excellent service just because you have excellent food (which Il Bosco truly does) and the owner of the establishment should know this and provide this and if he can't, he should hire someone who can."}
{"text":"Great food, check.  Convenient location, check.  Friendly local owner, check.  I had been referred to Il Bosco by a fellow yelper some weeks back... And finally decided to venture out for a casual lunch. So happy that I did.   The pizza here is wonderful-fresh ingredients in yummy combinations, straight from a woodfire oven. I tried two different pies, the Caprese salad and their creme brule.  All were well made and the service speedy and friendly.    The store front can be hard to spot (blink and you might miss it), but I actually like the \"hole in the wall\" feeling of a smaller local business. Take the time to seek this gem out!"}
{"text":"The owner is sooo nice and friendly! He makes you feel welcomed! While the restaurant is small, the food is INCREDIBLE! When I close my eyes and take a bite of the pizza, I feel like I am in Italy! Even charging for the bread reminds me of Italy and for this place, I am OK with that,"}
{"text":"Mouthwatering cuisine really can come in a small package and Il Bosco is here to prove that size definitely does not matter! I met the lovely Anna M for lunch recently and much to my delight, she introduced me to Il Bosco.   Hidden down an alley on the north west corner of Shea and Scottsdale Road, Il Bosco is a humble abode filled with a whole lot of flavor. The restaurant itself is tiny and probably only hold around 50-60 people. Upon walking in, I was immediately greeted by the scent of pizza baking in the wood fired oven and a feeling of hominess with dark wood and brick paneling and close seating. You know those restaurants where they offer you an \"eating in the kitchen\" experience and make you make a reservation months in advance for the chance to \"dine with the chef\" Well here, you get to do so every time you visit because the open kitchen is just steps away from the seating. Therefore you get to see the pizza being created from scratch and here's the best part of the entire experience...the pizza cooks in 90 seconds! Yes 90 seconds!   I ordered the Biaggia which comes with prosciutto, figs, four cheeses, arugala and evo. The lunch pizzas are personal pizzas so Anna ordered the Lucia which comes with cheese, tomato sauce, sausage and mushrooms. I could smell the pizza being made and I started to drool with anticipation. Finally a whole 90 seconds later, poof! The pizza appeared and I took my first heavenly bite which turned into many more heavenly bites. This pizza is some of the best pizza I've ever had and I have had my fair share of pizza! The crust is a combination of crunchy and chewy and it's seasoned to perfection. The toppings are a perfect combination of sweet and savory and compliment the crust perfectly. I must say that the Biaggia was by far the most superb pizza I've had in quite some time. The Lucia was also extremely good but the Biaggia stole poor Lucia's thunder. It was a delicious lunch and I really enjoyed the atmosphere. It's one of the best kept secrets around but I don't think it should be a secret. Everyone should experience this pizza!   I will leave you with one more little fun fact. They have a portable wood fired oven that they use for catering! It's amazing and would be great for a party. I also noticed that they have a walk-up window where you can order take-out."}
{"text":"We have gone here twice so far and both times we were very happy with our pizza. We usually call in and pick it up with no issues. The owner seems really nice and the restaurant is beautiful. We have yet to sit down and eat there but I am sure it would also be a great experience. We take our pizza seriously so it's always refreshing when we have awesome pizza choices nearby."}
{"text":"SIRI found Il Bosco for us last summer when we asked for pizza on our way home from Kierland.  There are many good pizza spots near our home, but we are always hoping for something more artisanal.  This small, almost hidden wood-fired  pizzaria was the find of the year for us.  We have brought family and friends many times and have never been disappointed. When our company needed to find a caterer for a two hour event for 100 guests at the Phoenix Children's Museum I did not immediately think of Il Bosco.  The event was to be akin to a happy hour with wine/beer/soda/appetizers.  I really didn't want anything to do with the planning or execution of the event - I am not good at such things and I don't enjoy the process.  It wasn't until after seeing quite a few other options that I raised my voice.  The Phoenix Children's Museum is a wonderfully playful and unique setting and I felt we needed a more comfort oriented option. I remembered the pizza oven on wheels that sits in front of Il Bosco and asked my assistant to call the restaurant to see if Il Bosco offered event catering. We promptly received a catering menu with set prices based on number of guests.  We liked what we saw immediately.  A few days later, I met the planning team at the restaurant for lunch where we were offered samples of 5 or 6 pizzas that could be made on-site at our event.  It was a hit.  We selected a salad option, drinks and desserts. We received a VERY reasonable quote via email immediately.  Bill Forrest, the owner, went personally to the museum to meet with our team and museum staff to coordinate the set up and execution.  Bill offered suggestions without being intrusive and in every way demonstrated a willingness to \"make it work.\" The event came off without a hitch.  The food flowed at a perfect pace - it takes just a minute or two to cook a pizza in that 800 degree oven.  Pizzas were consistently hot and in keeping with demand.  The salad and desserts were top notch.  Everything was perfect.  The sight of a wood-fired pizza oven at the event raised a few eyebrows and added to the anticipation of the evening. The absolute crowning contribution of Il Bosco to the evening was their having the forethought to bring pizza boxes and offering our guests fresh pizzas to take home.  It was a very nice and unusual courtesy as many of our guests had children at home. Il Bosco made us look good.  Our choice of a wood-fired pizza caterer made our event stand out.  Their professional appearance and behavior were exactly what we would have expected.  Il Bosco shines not only as a restaurant, but as a caterer.  Most highly recommended."}
{"text":"After a long day of moving and stress we hit this lovely local pizza spot with fabulous staff in Barbara and Bill.  Their Kale Spinach Ceasar salad is one of our favorites. The wood fires pizzas are amazing. Bill's homemade Amaretto is divine. Good service, fab food, reasonable pricing, casual ambience, perfection!"}
{"text":"Came here before going to the movies and we will definitely be back. The food and the service was top notch! Very happy we stumbled upon this gem."}
{"text":"Okay, I'm from NY.  This place is mere blocks from my house, and I've never been there before.  That will shortly be rectified.  Simply put, the best pizza I've had in Scottsdale.  Or in Phoenix.  Or in Arizona.  Hell, the best I've had west of the Poconos (I'd say west of the Hudson River, but there are some REALLY good pizza joints in Jersey).  Can't wait to try their Pananis.  I just keep saying to myself WHY haven't I known of this place before.   All that lost time.  Sigh."}
{"text":"Just went here and really loved it.  The owner is pleasant without being obnoxious.  The pizzas lie somewhere in between a high quality American style pizza and a Napoletana pizza.  We had a caprese salad with high quality tomatoes and medium quality mozzarella.  The basil, olive oil dressing was wonderful.  The pizzas are tasty with excellent ingredients.    The atmosphere is simply wonderful and cozy.  It's a small space but interesting and nicely decorated.  For amazingness I still rank Pomo #1 for pizza, Andreoli #2 (they only serve pizza a couple of nights a week) and Bosco is in the next category.  This is a great place so make sure and give it a try."}
{"text":"Second week in a row I ate here. As close to perfection as you can get. From the Caesar salad to the pizza to the creme brûlée and espresso it was wonderful.  I am a new regular. Thank you"}
{"text":"Wonderful wood fired pizza. The Cremini mushrooms are wonderful on the sausage pizza. This little hole in the wall pizza joint is worth searching for, just east of Handlebar J's.  They even have a portable wood fire pizza oven for catering."}
{"text":"So so cute! I had no idea this place was tucked away here. There are so many good restaurants in this area, but this one I would've never even known about if it weren't for yelp. I came here tonight with my sister, and we both thought it was nice, the inside is a bit small and no one was sitting inside when we came! Outside we could hear the live music from next door which was fun haha. I loved the little lights. One complaint is it was too crammed..it was basically like sitting at the same table as the people next to us which was a little bit weird. Also we had to pick up and move the table to get in and out of our seats haha. But it didn't look like all of the tables were like that!  The bathroom was nice and clean which is a bonus. The lady who seated and served us was nice, everything done in a timely matter and she made sure to check up on us! My sister wasn't sure if she wanted the meatballs or a salad. She got the salad and wasn't a huge fan. It's a small portion for $7 and didn't even have caesar dressing, it had some other type of dressing. The croutons were weird too, I didn't like them. The bread with oil was tasty! And luckily, the pizza made up for the mediocre salad. Very good quality stuff! A tiny bit too soggy in the middle, but otherwise totally excellent. I'd love to come back and try out the pesto pizza! Would recommend this place too!"}
{"text":"Great pizza. Device was friendly and polite. Very patient with my kids had 1 million questions. We will definitely be back"}
{"text":"(Lyrics - Kelis - Bossy)  Il Bosco It's a fresh bite to scream up my Yelp It switched up the beat to my heart That's right it brought imported cheese to the boulevard And that's right, it's the one who's firewood oven to start   Il Bosco It's a place y'all love to date It's a place that's raised the stakes I told Yelp Phoenix there's no debate I'm back with an appetite cause it's Bosco   Il Bosco Pizza is a locally own spot quaint and popping with some firewood cooked pizza; this place definitely has a lovely charm to it.    I came on a rainy evening so the place inside was packing!  I would say the inside seats a max of 35 people including the bar.  The open kitchen where you can see the firewood oven was an allure while chef craft his work.    We started with a bottle of wine plus some Fried Ravioli.  The ravioli came along with some sweet marinara sauce and had a decent soft doughiness to it.  Next we shot for the Caprese Salad; which was my favorite.  It came with Burrata cheese along with the traditional Mozzarella cheese, tomato, and balsamic.  Overall, one of my favorite bites of the night.  Fluffy burrata along with smooth and stringy mozzarella cheese ending with a sweet balsamic punch.    For our pizza we ordered their Biaggia & Carmela.  The Biaggia came with prociutto, fig jam, four cheese, and arugula.  Overall, a decent bite but I felt the arugula was over-powering.  The fig jam was light and I wish they would put more on it.  The Carmela came with tomato sauce, sausage, spinach, and caramelized onions.  The tomato sauce was a welcoming pairing with the saltiness of the sausage and sweet onions.  In the end, Il Bosco Pizza is a little sweet spot for some farm to table pizza.  Traditional Italian bites with some allure of the ambiance.  The firewood oven is awesome to watch, but not sure how well it fares during the summer months. - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Such a fun little hole in the wall! We're from out of town and found this place on yelp. We were expecting something hoity-toity but it wasn't pretentious at all. The pizza was amazing and a surprisingly affordable lunch option. So fresh and you get your pizza in less than 10 minutes after ordering. Great little unique place and the owner was very friendly and made us feel right at home!"}
{"text":"My family and I have made this a regular in our local dining rotation and it is by far our favorite pizza in the valley. QUALITY ingredients, and the staff is always warm and friendly."}
{"text":"Consistently exceptional fare, great service, neighborhood ambiance. Don't miss this place. Pizza, salads, appetizers, desserts...all top notch."}
{"text":"Il Bosco is a hidden gem with authentic \"real\" Italian pizza like the pizza you get while in Italy. Everything is made from fresh organic ingredients and \"il capo cuoco\" just doesn't cut corners. Everything is delivered with pride and care - fresh olives, thick-crust fresh bread and olive oil to start and the water and ice tea are served extra chilled. Love this place and we often find our regular table to enjoy the best pizza in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Just plain awesome pizza and staff.  Kinda hard to find but you should definitely seek them out.  This will be our new Scottsdale pizza stop!"}
{"text":"Food was great, prices were incredibly reasonable for the quality of the food,  the best caprese salad appetizer you will ever have , pizza was cooked to perfection with layers of flavors and textures, get the goat cheese and Fig house specialty, you won't regret it ! Dont forgot to enjoy the home made amaretto to finish off a special meal. Enjoy Italy for one night in Scottsdale. Cheers."}
{"text":"The food and service are beyond exceptional! They had a nice selection of wine. I had a red that was delicious. The creme brule' with fruit was maybe the best I've had. I'm looking forward to going back soon."}
{"text":"With a 4 1/2 star average on 155 reviews, there's little I can add that hasn't already been said.  It just feels good to add another 5 star vote for a pizza that is unusually good.  Standing out as much as this pizza stands out should mean something.  From every big city to every rural town, there is always a pizza place.  Our own USDA published a scholarly paper earlier this year calling pizza the world's most popular food.  On top of that, I've lived my entire life in Chicago, and notwithstanding the ridiculous notion some New Yorkers have that they know good pizza, most knowledgeable foodies agree that Chicago is the pizza capital of the universe.  And we do have terrific pizza in Chicago.  Lou Malnati's, Fox's, Toni's, Pequod's, Vito and Nick's, and on and on.  But there's something about Bill's pizza here that seems to always be served with a kind of pride and love and devotion to the product that is plain and simply rare.  The mozzarella is exquisitely fresh, and every single ingredient, from veggies to meat, is fresh and flavorful.  The tomato sauce rivals the best in Italy itself.  The crust is so good that it stands alone as a homemade bread of the finest ingredients.  And yes, I've had the famous Pizzeria Bianco, and Grimaldi's, and Oregano's, and they are all perfectly acceptable pies.  But Il Bosco is simply in a class by itself.  It's all done in a very small space, no reservations accepted, a little hard to see from the street - no matter, do whatever you have to do if you want one of the absolute best pizzas in a world full of pizzas.  I'm lucky, because when I visit Scottsdale several times a year to see my son and his family, he lives very nearby, and we can go at odd hours and avoid the crowds.  But whatever it takes, do it.  You'll see what I mean."}
{"text":"Love this place! It's dark, intimate and they do pizza really really well. The limited menu tells you how serious they are about getting the pizza right. The brick oven makes the crust so crispy and their toppings are always very fresh. If you're looking for a casual place to have great pizza...look no further!"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem. Tucked back in an awkward shopping center, I would have never expected this greatness. Il Bosco offers one of the three best pizzas I have ever tried. The atmosphere and ambience of the restaurant was great and I hope I am in the area again so I can get another taste of greatness."}
{"text":"This place was great! Pizza was absolutely delicious and the atmosphere was amazing. The setting was perfect for an intimate evening with my partner and his mother"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner after finding it on Yelp (or course). The food was good. We got the pizza with the figs and arugula (sp?) on it and it was delicious. The owner was friendly but maybe a little too friendly. It's hard to eat when someone is trying to talk to you the whole time. We had 1 slice of the pizza left and asked for a box. He took it to box it up. Finally when we paid and were wanting to leave we asked for our box and it turns out the food got thrown out instead of boxed up. No big deal since it was just 1 slice but if it had been more we definitely would have asked for another pizza to replace it."}
{"text":"My wife and I revisited this place after hearing from multiple people it was of the two best pizza places in the greater Phoenix area. To start, the vibe is great. Very small, tucked away Italian shop where you quickly get the feel that you have known the owner/waiters for months already. Needless to say, the service is great. The owner came by on both our visits and chatted with us about whatever it was we wanted to talk about - this time, restaurant reviews :) Now we ordered a Cesar Salad to share, 3 pizzas between 4 of us (we had guests) and a cookie dessert. The salad was delicious. Very light dressing with farm to table greens. It isn't your typical Cesar though, much more airy. The portion size is on the smaller end. The pizzas are incredible. We tried the classic margarita, Lucia and fig spread one (can't remember the name but definitely their signature pie). It has a classic Italian touch to it but not as thin; more of a hybrid between the thin Italian and doughy New York."}
{"text":"One of the best pizza places in the valley. Very small inside but the food is fantastic and the service is awesome.   Nice touches of comp olives and bread.   Expensive wine by the glass but decent selection.   Definitely worth the drive from Chandler."}
{"text":"Wonderful! If you are a fan of thin crust pizza without overpowering sauce - THIS IS IT! Noyt a lot of variety, but I have tried four different ones and they are all excellent, brick oven done. You won't be dissapointed and the place is very cute/casual! Has become my \"go to Pizza\" for both \"eat in\" and \"take home\""}
{"text":"A hidden gem in Scottsdale. The pizza compares favorably with the best in Arizona (Pizzeria Bianco), the patio is lovely and the service is great. Run, don't walk to Il Bosco!"}
{"text":"The food is incredible! The staff is friendly and helpful. Joe and I tried a date night there, the problem for us was that toddlers love pizza! Inside the restaurant is small so once the kid started throwing silverware we moved outside. The Caprese salad was awesome though!"}
{"text":"Yup. It's all true. Great food, super charming place, very intimate.   We sat outside on the patio under a heat lamp. Enjoyed the olives as a starter, as well as some fried raviolis (yes, please) and a caprese salad app.  Outstanding artisan pizza, with as good a crust as I've ever had, and homemade mozzarella. Wine was just ok, but very reasonable. Server was attentive, helpful and friendly. Owner came by a couple times to check in on us and was absolutely delightful.   Deduct a point for the proximity to the Handlebar J Saloon and the faux-cowboys arriving in limos with 10-gallon hats. Then add a point back for the near-fight we got to watch between a biker and the faux-cowboy who almost hit him with his Cadillac.  We'll be back, and with more friends."}
{"text":"This is my favorite pizza place in the valley. The fig, prosciutto, goat cheese & arugula pizza is out of this world! The owner operator is super friendly. Last time he sent us home with a loaf of fresh baked bread!"}
{"text":"I don't write Yelp reviews, but this place deserves it. Il Bosco is amazing. If you want authentic pizza, from a real non-chain family business, this place is it. Great place for a date, or to have dinner with family or friends. The service here is personal, authentic, and just enough. Your server will likely also be the proprietor. The pizza is stellar. Order meatballs for an appetizer. Order whatever is on special for the evening. This place is small and intimate, in good ways. Sit outside when it's nice out. Support small business, authentic pizza, and visit Il Bosco aka The Forest."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants. Always get their Mia wood fired pizza. The owner Bill is one of the nicest a guys you'll ever meet. This is a MUST visit if you are in town."}
{"text":"The pizza was so authentic, it brought us right back to our summer in Rome. The ingredients are fresh and wonderfully prepared. We got the Valentina and the Biaggia; both were very special, with great complexity of flavor. However, I'm not sure what all is included in the dining experience. For example, we got complimentary olives, but larger groups got bread and olive oil too. Large groups also had a water decanter on their tables for refills. We were sort of neglected after we got our pizzas and were left sitting without any water for most of our meal. Furthermore, some tables had flowers, others didn't. Since the restaurant is really only open during the evening, I would suggest a candle on each table, instead. This would be more cost effective, and would give the space an even more romantic vibe. Lastly, my amoretto was complimentary at the end of my meal. It was incredible (like butter), but the restaurant shouldn't just be giving that away for free....it's too good. Bottom line, everything needs to be consistent. Every table, every group (no matter the size) should have the same service and experience. That being said, I loved the food here, and would gladly return."}
{"text":"Listen guys. I got a pizza from this place. The fungi. It was picked up by my wife and got to me about an hour later. Still one of the best pizzas i've ever had. It was unbelievable and they definitely don't skimp on the toppings. I have no problem going out of my way to eat here. It's totally worth it. If every pizza I get here from now on is 80% as good as the one I had I will be eating here forever."}
{"text":"Bill and his crew treat everyone like family. The food is excellent and at-home hospitality cannot be beaten. We've been here a dozen (or more) times and have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza, service and reasonably priced. We will be back again to this hidden gem. We found it quite by accident and I am glad we did. Just the smell of the wood fired oven was worth the trip. Watch out for the serrano peppers growing outside, they have a bite!"}
{"text":"I'd like to say it was good but we haven't had a chance to eat there recently. The last three times we've gone in the owners tell us they're closed, this time closing in 10 min and then give us a blank stare. That was at 8:10 on a Saturday night! Look the pizza is good, the appetizers not so much, we've been going there for years but this is a new thing, closing at 8:20? Looks like they're doing so well they don't need our business anymore. Pomo pizza a few minutes away sure was happy to have us."}
{"text":"The pizza may be good; however, we didn't get that far!  Atmosphere might be like eating in a morgue - owner is rude and a terrible host!  We walked out and will NEVER return.  On to POMO - OUR FAVORITE!"}
{"text":"I found this place a couple of months ago and it is hands down the best pizza in Arizona. I come from the East Coast where pizza was invented, and Il Bosco Pizza rivals the best pizza restaurants there including Pepe's. Service is always great and the pricing is very fair. Bill the owner is super friendly and cares about what he does. There is magic in the pie because of the blend of cheese, sauce and dough. If you are looking for the best pizza in Arizona, you better try this place so you can compare the rest to the best!"}
{"text":"Not sure why it took soooo long to discover this GEM!  Great little place for wine and pizza.  Service was excellent and the owner was very attentive to all his patrons.  Felt very warm and inviting.  The meatball app was cooked to perfection.  All the pizzas were spot on and delicious.  Will be back again!"}
{"text":"5 stars across the board. Excellent service, very cool owner who came over to talk to us, great dessert, and awesome homemade amaretto to finish the night off. Will definitely be going back  soon with friends."}
{"text":"Best wood burning gourmet pizza ever!!!  We loved it and our kids loved it!  Fresh ingredient and the crust is cooked to perfection, not too thin and too deep.  We spoke to the chef and he is super nice and friendly and it was really quick!  Love the little restaurant but it is small and it gets packed during dinner time.  Lunch was great and their lunch prices can't be beat!"}
{"text":"Great, intimate wood fired pizza place. Delicious crust and simple well balance ingredients. The focus is a top notch, simple delicious pie. Wine is served in water glasses, just like growing up in an Italian household. Owner Bill is almost always there with a friendly welcome. The staff is attentive, friendly and casual. Small 5 seat bar that puts you basically in the kitchen... love it. 5 stars! Come here you will not be disappointed. Oh nice big patio also."}
{"text":"Wow..  Amazing wood fired pizza.  The owner was very friendly and nice.  Hand thrown pie.  So delicious daily specials on pizzas.  Caprasi salad with fresh mozzarella.  Stone ground bread with very tasty Italian olives on the table. We felt like we were in Italy.  Well worth a try."}
{"text":"The BEST olives, root beer, roasted vegetables, bread and pizza I have ever had!!! Better than Pizza Bianca by far!!! Addicted!  Jan. 21, 2015 - and I'm still addicted but I'm as thin as ever!! My wildest dreams come true!! A pizza that doesn't make you fat!!!"}
{"text":"We ordered takeout pizza from Il Bosco after reading the Yelp reviews. My pizza had a burnt bottom...like it was dusted in flour and then burned. It ruined the whole thing. The sausage was just fair. My husband's pizza was soggy and \"wet\" as he called it and he said it was one of the worst pizzas he has eaten. We so wanted to like this place--the patio and interior were charming. Still, food is what makes the rating for us and this hardly deserved even the 2 stars."}
{"text":"A friend told me about this place, saying it has the worlds best pizza! She had taken her food to go, but I went and ate on the enchanting patio. It is a very charming place that made me want to stay there all night eating and talking. I had one of their specialty pizzas. It was absolutely delicious! Our server was very nice. There was another male server, Zach, who stopped to help and chat with us. He was such a doll, and went above and beyond any service expected from a waiter. I will absolutely go back. What's even more exciting is that in a couple weeks they are will be offering brunch as well! With the chefs taste palate for the unique combination of tastes- I can't wait to try more!"}
{"text":"Great neighborhood restaurant! Went for the first time for a late dinner and was very impressed. Adorable, chic, intimate restaurant that feels very authentic Italian. The menu is simple and straight forward, again a nod to true Italian Pizza and Salad.   A friend and I split the Kale and Spinach caesar (excellent flavor)  and the fig, prosciutto, arugula, and goat cheese pizza. Literally the pizza had all my favorite flavors in one, and with the perfect crust it was excellent. Great over all restaurant and will be back again soon!"}
{"text":"I went to Il Bosco with my mom and sister last night and it was fantastic! The small atmosphere is so fun, and the pizza was some of the best I've had in a long time. The owner and staff were all incredibly nice and very accommodating. This place is a gem in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"This place is the bomb. Wood fired pizza...we had spicy sausage and peppers (the day's special). Get a red root beer too, a new staple for us."}
{"text":"Great service, great pizza, amazing dessert!   Found Il Bosco on Yelp and I'm so glad that we did! As soon as we got here we were greeted by the owner. Although there was a short wait (5-10 minutes) he found us a spot to sit and got our drinks right away. We ordered the Dona which was delicious. The crust, cheese and sauce were amazing! We finished with splitting the brownie a la mode and considered ordering another because it was that good!   Would absolutely recommend this to anyone in the area! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"It was our first time here for dinner. We had very delicious wood oven pizza and appetizers. Servers were pleasant :) this is very low-key and lovely cozy place!"}
{"text":"This is our neighborhood restaurant, with a great location and great atmosphere.  We especially love the outside patio area.  They grow their fresh herbs right outside on the patio.  We've been coming here since day one, and it just gets better and better! Tonight we had the caprese salad which was amazing as was the handmade wood fired pizza. We topped the night off with the Creme Brulee with fresh strawberries.  Everything was so delicious!! This place is perfect for any occasion. Dinner for two or something larger. In the past, we've held my daughters sweet 16 party as well as my 50th bday surprise party.  This is a place you can always count on.  Thank you Bill!!!"}
{"text":"My guy and I have been to Il Bosco twice now and it is quickly becoming one of our favorite pizza places.  Both times we got the meatball appetizer, a salad and a pizza.   The meatballs are delish - not spicy but very flavorful and the sauce is great for dipping the bread that they give you.  We've had the traditional Caesar and the kale spinach salad. Between the two we definitely preferred the kale spinach. The Caesar has a thinner dressing on it that isn't bad, it's just not the creamy Caesar I was hoping for. I believe the same dressing is on the kale spinach salad and it fits better with the thicker kale. Plus the kale spinach has pancetta on it - can't go wrong there.  The pizza is definitely the standout here. The crust is done perfectly - not charred and not soggy in the middle. The sauce has a nice flavor and the toppings are placed in just the right amount.  The owner has been there both times and is very warm and welcoming. On our second visit his son was our waiter and was very pleasant as well. The service is fast and the atmosphere friendly.   We will definitely be returning. How else would we become Il Bosco regulars?"}
{"text":"This is the best pizza in Phoenix, no contest.  I've eaten at pizzeria Bianco many times and I will be moving my business to Il Bosco. You can read my review on Grimaldi's and how i stated it was missing something,  well Il Bosco has the \"it\" factor.  My wife and I dined here tonight and it was just a great, refreshing experience.  The place is on the smaller side, we sat outside which was great.  The menu is very limited but everything on it looked fantastic.  We opted for the Biaggia which consisted of prosciutto, arugula, a fig sauce, a squeeze of citrus, parmesan shavings and goat cheese. The other pizza we split was the special Zita. This was a white pizza with meatballs and carmelized onions.  Both pizzas were phenomenal.  The flour they use is organic so the pizzas are super light and do not sit heavy at all.  The service is also fantastic as both our waiter and the owner checked on us multiple times and were very informative.  Also, the pizzas came out extremely fast, like less than 5 minutes fast. I can't rave about this place enough, it's worth going out of your way for. ."}
{"text":"I absolutely love pizza. I would have it for every meal if my family would let me. This place has amazing pizza and the service to match. It is very small so you might have to wait for a table or have to eat at the bar but the food is definitely worth it."}
{"text":"Charming place, the owner and Forrest is an great, very nice and so helpful made my husband , me and our 2 daughters feels so welcome and comfortable. He explained very well the menu, the special and told us they could make whatever we wanted that wasn't on the menu . It wasn't the place we chose to stop at first but were happy we did  . Will definitely come back again , not for the free bread and olive oil basket he gave us but for his welcoming and the charming atmosphere"}
{"text":"My daughter found this in Yelp when we were in town on vacation from the East Coast.  Four of us went and ate indoors.  Small casual place with a wonderful owner.   We ordered the salsa, the stuffed peppers, the toasted ravioli, caprese, and one Eggplant pizza for all of us to share.  This was more than enough for the four of us, especially since we were originally not that hungry but wanted to try the various antipasto dishes.  The stuffed peppers aren't the large green peppers, but small red peppers with a nice bite to them and delicious sausage inside.   The bread was delicious.  My mother doesn't usually like cheese (except on pizza) but she liked the toasted ravioli so much that she wants to learn how to make them.  The caprese had fresh mozzarella and sliced cherry tomatoes.  The pizza was superb.  A nice change not to have breaded fried eggplant on a pizza but fresh cubed eggplant.  Everyone there was so nice and the food was delicious and came out quickly.   We were able to enjoy the food without feeling rushed.  I would definitely go back if we are in the area again and recommend it."}
{"text":"I love wood fire & brick oven pizza. So, found this tiny (and mean TINY) restaurant  by accident after ditching Jack N the Box. Its tucked behind fast food, big name franchises on the North/East corner of Scottsdale & Shea and is a nice little gem.   Besides how small the place is, the first thing you notice is the menu is very small (dinner menu is a little bigger), so me and my friend picked different things and shared. We got a personal pizza and a meatball sandwich. The sandwich was good, but not spectacular, but the pizza is awesome! I went back again for dinner and again the pizza was terrific, as was the salad; delicious. We asked them to do a half and half and they said no problem which is great; I hate when places won't compromise for make you feel guilty for changing their stuff. I loved it and my girlfriend loved it. Also something fun is their soda is not fountain drinks, but bottled real-sugar cane sodas that are delicious.  The only strange thing I have to say is the owner doubles as the server and he is very chatty. That's not a bad thing; he is a very nice guy but be prepared to have a conversation with the guy.  Recommend for a casual lunch and dinner for gourmet pizza & salad.  Pros: Amazing pizza, great food, great service and inviting setting. Cons: Very small menu; caters more toward veggie eaters rather than meaty pizzas."}
{"text":"WE LOVE il Bosco.   cute little sit down restaurant. I would imagine little cafe's in europe to be like their place.  The pizza's here are amazing. My wife ordered the one (forget the name) but they said it was their best seller. Obviously know why because it was AMAZING. mine was good, but her pizza made mine taste like crap.   If you like olives they serve a small tray of it before your food. I am not  a big fan of olives so this wasn't a big deal to me. But my wife loved it!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and not just the pizza! We got the meatballs which were delish and the olive oil that we dipped our bread into was very sweet. The pizzas are perfectly per portioned and the crust perfectly cooked.   The owner was the one that served us and told us that the names of the pizzas have a story behind them which was fun to hear some of them.   It's an eclectic restaurant with church pews for some seating and unmatched chairs and tables which I loved. We sat outside because the weather is great this time of year.   What we ordered: Meatballs- juicy and tender and hot! The \"Adrianna\" pizza  because my fiance's nieces name is that and the \"Gia\" which was amazing.  PROS: everything CONS: nothing  We have found our go to spot now :)"}
{"text":"Il Bosco has the best pizza in town! My go to place for my pizza fix. Bill is wonderful and always makes me feel welcome, and part of the family. Do not hesitate to make this your go to pizza place as well. You won't be disappointed. I have never had a bad meal here."}
{"text":"Il Bosco offers some extremely respectable pizza that is good enough to where my girlfriend and I come back once every few months. And with so many great pizza places in Phoenix, this definitely says something.  We've tried a handful of different pies, but thus far, the Mia (eggs, pancetta, chives) and Biaggia (prosciutto, figs, goat cheese, arugula) are two of our favorites. Ingredients and crust are high quality.  Even their bread with olive oil impresses, having that lovely rustic flavor that can easily stand on its own. The complimentary olives are a nice touch - if you like olives, of course. I rarely drink wine, but choosing a soda line that's exclusively from Boylan is enough to keep a soda junkie very happy.  The location is tucked away in a Scottsdale plaza. We almost missed it on our first visit, but I really like both the indoor and outdoor atmosphere. Tiny wood-fired pizzerias always work best in smaller spaces, because the lovely aroma immediately greets you when you walk in. Additionally, I've always liked places where the owner is actually there, working, serving, and interacting with customers. He seems to be very passionate about his pizza and clearly knows the craft quite well.    As for desserts, you have several options. We've tried both the regular brownie and pumpkin brownie, which were pretty standard fare. They have a chocolate chip cookie, which was incredible the first time we ordered it. Served warm and soft with a scoop of ice cream on top and consumed via spoons, it was a surprise hit! Think of a \"pizookie,\" just baked a little further. The second time, we expected the same thing, only to get a charred cookie that was completely burned black, much to our disappointment. We have also tried the lemon sorbetto, which is served inside an actual lemon. Excellent stuff and probably what I'd consider to be your best option.  While I won't jump on the \"So much better than Bianco\" bandwagon, I still consider this to be one of the better options in the surrounding area.  Easily one of our favorites!"}
{"text":"Great quality food with great personable service and a nice ambiance. What more do you want? The employees really were so friendly, we felt very welcomed. My husband got a sausage mushroom pizza and I got a cheese and basil one. One pizza could feed 2 people if you weren't extremely hungry. The pizzas were very fresh and seemed made from scratch. We also got a brownie ala mode for dessert. A bit pricey for the small portion ($7) but it was delicious."}
{"text":"I loved this place: They have burrata cheese! Loved the pizza and the people...cozy place to hang out on a regular basis to have a great glass of wine or beer on tap."}
{"text":"WOW!!! I see why this is the highest rated restaurant in 85260!!  I am super picky about pizza. I had Bianco, Grimaldis, pomo and on. None compare to this. MOST of those places that make brick oven pizza are too thin, the sauce bleeds thru in minutes and does not reheat well. This place has the best pizza of this kind I have had.  Not thin in the middle, amazing quality cheese!  Also got the meatball appetizer. 3 meatballs with marinana sauce, easily the best meatballs I have ever had. Not over seasoned or weird tasting."}
{"text":"came here a few weeks ago and the pizza is STUPID GOOD!!! :-)  its been a few weeks so i forgot the name of the pizza but it wasnt on the menu, it was written on the board, a daily or weekly special? it has peppadew peppers and i hope they have it as a special a lot or add it to the everyday menu. cant wait to go back  oh yeah, almost forgot about the olive oil. amazing !"}
{"text":"Owner operated adding to a friendly environment and service.  A genuine establishment starting with quality ingredients and prepared with care right in front of you.  Delicious pizza!  I had and will definitely recommend the Biaggia pizza with prosciutto, fresh arugula, and a light sweetness from fig jam.  The Elana is very tasty as well with a nice savory and salty combo.  I look forward to returning and exploring more of the menu and specials."}
{"text":"We loved Il Bosco, we sat out on their patio with a heater and it was perfect.  The owner was so helpful in accommodating a group of 7 on a Saturday night, and provided great recommendations.  We had appetizers, salads, and pizza, and all were wonderful.  Don't miss the sausage stuffed peppadews or the caprese salad, the Caesar was great too.  We ordered 5 different pizzas thinking we would have plenty to take home, but it was so good we went home with 3 spare pieces lol.  Two thumbs up, wonderful find."}
{"text":"our friends recommended this pizza place and we have tried their pizza when it was catered to their house. This is our new pizza place. Authentic pizza not loaded with a lot of toppings and not too doughy. They come in one size only, 12 inch. They brought out small tray of 10 olives to nibble on. We started with Cesar Salad,$7.5; glass of Chianti $9 and Boylan Root Beer, $3.5. Followed by the Adrianna pizza and Lucia Pizza, 11.5 and 13.5 respectively. The Lucia pizza had sausage and mushrooms which was proportional and the crust was yummy. You could actually taste the mushrooms because they were quartered instead of sliced. My wife enjoyed her pizza and mentioned that if we want pizza, this is where she wants it. We finished our meal with a Lemon Sorbetto which was an actually lemon hollowed out and the sorbet was packed into it. Refreshing!! When you come, parking can be a problem and you might have to park north, a block away."}
{"text":"Pretty authentic Napoli style pizza place. Tastes great, and they have good salads and wines as well."}
{"text":"I came here on a double date with the Tasia, her brother and his wife. That in itself made the night a blast because to be very blunt and straight forward, her brother and I are hilarious and we make every occasion fun. So, if you need to liven up a party, give me a call, we will jump in his truck and rock your world    Now for the pizza. We came for the pizza, and we loved it. The pizza was delicious. We got 3 different pies ( 2 biaggias). We loved the pie biaggia, that was every ones favorite. We also had the Joanna and Lucia. I loved them all - they were delicious.    Why 3 stars:  1) We waited like 15 minutes for everyone to get a water. They ran out of glasses...This was ridiculous, and we got refiled about once in the hour and a half we were there  2) we were sitting outside, and the heat lamp was broken...tough to enjoy the meal when your shivering - This was in February, so hopefully some of the kinks have been worked out.  3) the meatball appetizer was subpar. Small portions, 3 tiny meatballs, and they were nothing to write home about  4) I like that they have boylan soda brands, but seriously, I would rather have refills on ice tea and a soda on tap then spend 2.75 for like a sip of coke   I will def come back here for the pizza. It is awesome, but I will bring a bottle of water with me"}
{"text":"I don't get it. Maybe we just happened to go on a bad day, but there were 5 of us, and the food experience was severely lacking for each of us.   We all ordered different pizzas - each one was very, very salty. Uncomfortably over salted (and I like salty foods).   Spumoni was just taken out of the freezer and served to us. Tasted just like ice cream you'll get from the grocery store - in fact grocery store ice cream is better.   We all had a serving of mediocre food, followed by more of the same in the desert department. Oh, and it was all topped of with a healthy dose of service reeking of attitude.  Maybe our experience was an anomaly, but it was bad enough to dissuade us from any future visits."}
{"text":"I discovered II Bosco while searching on Yelp. WOW...what a great find!  The pizza was incredible, great service and really nice outdoor setting to enjoy the evening.   Finished off the meal with dessert, a delicious chocolate chip cookie a-la-mode and it was really wonderful! I'll be back asap to enjoy more pizza and probably another chocolate chip cookie a-la-mode.  Also worth noting the menu prices were very reasonable for the quality of pizza!"}
{"text":"Words don't even begin to describe the love I have for this place!  The food is outstanding, as is the service.  I crave their pizza (and olives!) weekly and just wish I had the time to eat there more frequently!  Bill (the owner) is extremely kind and it's clear that he really wants his customers to be satisfied.  This is hands down the best pizza in town...yes, better than Pizzeria Bianco.  They've also catered a few events at my house and for my kid's school and done a great job!  Bryn DeFusco"}
{"text":"We've been in search of great pizza with no \"attitude\" since coming to Scottsdale seven years ago and Il Bosco has been added to our great list.  We ate at Il Bosco last night and had a lovely evening.  The outside patio area is very cozy and quaint.  Service was outstanding (Pomo could really take lessons from the Il Bosco servers).  We ordered a Caesar salad to share which the server (who I think may have been the owner) happily offered to split.  Our pizza choice was the Dona which was delicious with melty cheese, perfectly seasoned red sauce, salty pancetta and sliced Roma tomatoes.  Before dinner teasers of delicious olives and fresh sourdough bread with a fruity yummy olive oil to dip in were an excellent appetite opener.  The after dinner homemade amaretto was a perfect ender. During our visit we noticed several take out customers leaving with not just one or two boxes of pizza but three, four and five boxes.  We knew we had arrived at the right place to satisfy our pizza cravings.  Thanks Il Bosco for a great experience."}
{"text":"Family operated and excellent service, Il Bosco serves up some excellent pies! Imports a ton of items from Italy. We love this place!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Amazing wood fired pizza at an affordable price. We've eaten in the restaurant 4-times and have always had great service. We also order out and they wait for you to get there to fire up the pizzas. It's a must try!!"}
{"text":"This is a tiny place that does an excellent job with Pizza.  The owner is friendly and involved with greeting and making sure that you are enjoying your meal and your time in the restaurant.  My wife split the roasted vegetables and a Caesar salad.  The vegetables were terrific, the salad was the only miss of the night.  We were expecting more and will skip it next time.  There will definitely be a next time as the pizza was terrific, great crust and flavorful.  Near Scottsdale Rd and Shea, find your way to this place."}
{"text":"Great hidden treasure.  Go there now, it wont be long before the entire valley finds out about this place.    I LOVE the essence of this place.  This is exactly what we need as a developing restaurant city.  Charming, high quality products and OWNER occupied (Refreshing).  From the moment you walk through the door, you know this place is different.  Rustic Charm.....  This owner backs it up with great personal service and a high quality pie.  NOTE TO OWNER - RAISE YOUR PRICES!!!  Yes, $12 was the most expensive on menu....  I thought it would 7 inches....  Great value but I felt guilty.    Try this spot out.  I hear they are opening for lunch in October!!!"}
{"text":"The best gourmet pizza in the valley.  Forget all the other wannabes. Creative apps, salads and pizzas. Ambiance is fantastic. My wife and I come her all the time and are true foodies.  You won't want to go anywhere else after eating pizza here."}
{"text":"Small and quaint...until we got there that is. This restaurant is tiny.  There are about five tables inside. Somehow that was enough for us because they weren't busy at 8pm on a Friday. There are only a few choices of pizzas that they offer. The choices are good ones though. There is amazing free bread while you wait that is warm and soft. The pizzas are big and more than enough for the average person. The desserts were very delicious as well. I know this is a small complaint but the sodas are disgusting. They don't have Pepsi or Coke products just these custom cane sugar drinks. No bueno. The owner talked with us half of the time we were there. He is a cool guy. Just don't ever ask him for ranch, ham or pineapple for your pizza. It offends him rightfully so because his pizzas are pretty good. The service was okay but the server rarely came around. We didn't get our check until 30 minutes after we were done."}
{"text":"AMAZING. Best pizza place west of the Mississippi hands down. Perfect dough, and sauce. Quality that other places lack."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Great atmosphere! Mr. Forest himself went to of his way to explain all of the food/specials to us!   The short rib pizza was probably our favorite, but nothing a disappointed!"}
{"text":"Amazing. Great service - unbelievable sauce. Had the caesar with meatballs to start. Half pepperoni pizza with the kids. So good!"}
{"text":"If you want some of the best tasting pizzas with a creative flair at an awesome price without then attitude---Go here!!!!!   Food was great, we were surprised when the chef came over and gave us a taste platter of olive oils breads and even there own home made olives. My wife and I had a great time. We are going there again."}
{"text":"Some of he best pizza I've ever had. The atmosphere is amazing and makes you feel as though in you're in Italy. The owner came to our table and gave us personal recommendations. This is a hidden gem!"}
{"text":"On a recent visit to Phoenix we were headed down Scottsdale Road looking for a place to eat. We decided on Il Bosco. Fellow Yelpers never let me down and they were giving this place 5 stars so I decided we needed to try it ourselves.   We were greeted by Bill, (golf professional) and now owner of Il Bosco. Inside the restaurant is tiny but charming. The menu includes starters, salads and pizza but before ordering check out the \"special board\" that hangs from the ceiling. We finally decided on the Biagga. It came topped with prosciutto, fig jam and goat cheese. It was incredibly tasty and the perfect combination of ingredients.   What makes this place special is the personal touch of the staff and the quality of the food. They are there to make sure you have a good experience. After only one visit I'm hooked! Some of the best brick oven pizza I've had and I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"If this place becomes too big of a deal and I have to start waiting a long time I'm going to...well, I'm going to not be happy.  Tiny ceramic olive dishes! Calligraphy'd menus! A pizza oven that's RIGHT THERE! Dim lighting, a cute little (emphasis on \"little\") patio, perfect service and THE PIZZA. GAH.  Never mind. I was going to elaborate on the pesto-ridiculousness I've experienced both times we came here, but I don't want to share. Forget you read this. Carry on."}
{"text":"This was such a great find. In town for the weekend & having drinks next door. Decided to try the pizza and I have to say it's probably the best I've ever had !! The service was great, the good was excellent and the owner was very friendly & welcoming. Don't know if I'll ever be back in Scottsdale but if I am I will definitely be back!! This little place is a Must!!"}
{"text":"The food is really good.  Pizzas are baked in wood ovens.  There is a smokey taste profile that differentiates the flavors from other places.  We got there early in the evening so seating was not a problem.  The staff was very pleasant.  They knew the menu and offered suggestions that were helpful.  We would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Definitely a fan - made the pick from Yelpers' reviews - and you all didn't steer us wrong.  First time hear - and not sure when the next time would be, so tried a few things:  the meatballs, the Biaggia pie and another special pie - red sauce, pancetta, red onions (I think) - all was delicious!    Like some other reviewers have mentioned, we had the opportunity to meet and chat with the owner - a very nice guy, who's really mastered the pizza art.  We ate outside - enjoying the nice cool evening air.  All in all a great experience!  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Every visit is as great as the last!  We love to introduce locals as well as out-of-towners to this best in class pizza place.  What a special gem.  Another Phoenix downtown pizza place has garnered much nation wide coverage, but night for night we would pick Il Bosco over Bianca's!  And importantly, you don't have to wait 2 to 4 hours!  You won't find a better pizza in all of Arizona!  Not to forget, the Caesar salad is a winner too!"}
{"text":"4th time at IL Bosco's and it gets better every time.  Sunday night light crowd and open until 8pm.  The fresh dough and custom high heat oven makes a perfect combination for a browned crust.  I must say my favorite pizza pepperoni, sausage and olive.  Appetizer was a Caprese  cheese and tomatoes which just is out of this world. We also had some cooked red peppers to die for.  Service was quick yet a nice dining experience with friends.  Two thumbs up! #bestPizza"}
{"text":"I was so disappointed. After drooling over these pictures and rave reviews for weeks  I finally drove the ten miles to get my fantasy pizza. Imagine my surprise when they handed me this tiny box weighing almost nothing. I actually asked the waitress if she gave me the right order. Funny, she asked me where i'd heard about the place and I told her the internet, she said \"Yawp (sic) ?..yeah most of those are family or friends, we got 5 stars or somethin'.\" That explains ALOT! Gee, good thing me and my husband weren't really hungry, twenty bucks for a snack? Not bad quality but tiny quantity for price. Sauce is kinda raw, undertaste of wine and exactly two nickel sized slivers of  garlic sausage per slice. Cheese is good quality. I see why the place was empty at 7pm on a Saturday. If your single or on a date and don't mind high prices go for it."}
{"text":"Great hole in the wall type place with excellent service. Great 12\" pizzas and salads. Loved the sausage, carmelized onions pizza."}
{"text":"Wow. I made the special trip to Scottsdale to try out this pizza place. It is a small quaint little place. There was no available seating inside so we had to eat outside. If I were to come again, I would wait until Winter, because eating outside when it is over 100 degrees is really not enjoyable at all. I can see where eating outside during the nice time of year would be really fun though. I ordered the pizza with goat cheese, fig, arugula, citrus and Parmesan. It was so amazing. I loved the way my taste buds danced as I learned the different flavors in each bite. The pizza was a little pricey for what you get $15. But I loved it. I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Aaaaah!! I love this place!  Fantastic food in a casual environment, and the staff treats customers so well.  It's tiny, so everyone is up in everyone's business which creates this happy family atmosphere.  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing! It is better than all the pizza places I have been to across the valley. My friend told me it is the best pizza he had since Italy, so I decided to try it. Definitely extremely impressed and will probably be back this week."}
{"text":"Really good, fresh pizza. Very small inside but seems family owned and the staff is super nice and really take care of you. Fried ravioli is also great."}
{"text":"Il Bosco aka \"The Forest\".  Excellent wood fired pizza and wine!  Good lay-back atmosphere.  This place is a little hole in the wall located in a strip mall.  You might drive right by it and miss it.  They have seating outside so when the weather cools down that would be a plus.  My only complaint is they weren't that busy and our waitress hovered and tried to take away plates when we were still eating.  All in all, I'd give it another try because the pizza was so good.  PS - they need to work on their Caesar Salad.  Dry and tasteless.  If they made homemade dressing it could be a star."}
{"text":"First time at this little hidden gem. Pizza was tasty and came out fast. Bread and balsamic is a great starter. The service was exceptional, our server was very knowledgeable and attentive!"}
{"text":"We were starving and wandering around Scottsdale Quarter, so we decided to pop into True Food to eat. In spite of there being lots of open tables, they said there would be an epic wait - or we could sit with some strangers or on a sofa outside. I didn't feel like doing either of those things, so we split and headed south. I used yelp to find the best place that was still open and on the way.   Il Bosco showed up with the best overall score, and neither of us had eaten here so we decided to give it a shot. It's tucked away in a little nook next to Handlebar J's and looked cute and inviting. We wandered in and were seated right away. It's a cozy little place - clearly decorated with care and love.  We both ordered water (sparkling and still) and they came in these fancy artisan bottles that were left at our table along with a pair of small glasses filled with ice. I like when restaurants do this. They also brought out a tiny strange plate with olives on it. Neither of us eat olives, so we sorta poked at them, puzzled over them and dared each other to eat one.   The menu was elegant and beautiful - simple and hand written. We later got an explanation from the owner that he had a local artist make them by hand. Details details... this place is rich in details. The items on the menu were pretty much just salads and pizzas.   Everything about this place says \"fancy fine-dining\" and if I hadn't looked at the prices I would've thought it was going to be too rich for my blood. As it turns out, the prices were VERY reasonable. The only thing I thought was a little pricey was the water - on any other night I would've ordered wine though, and the wine prices were appropriate.   We ordered a pizza (half and half - something you can do as long as the sauces match) and a caesar salad. They brought some artisan bread with herb oil for us to snack on, and we made that disappear. The salad was split into two plates and we quickly ate that up as well - it wasn't drowning in dressing. It was an excellent presentation and a good salad.   The pizza then arrived... it was about a 10-12\" woodfired pizza. My half was pepperoni and sausage. Her half was just cheese. Each half had a name on the menu - girls names if I remember correctly. We each took a piece over to our plates and started digging in. Right off the bat, I noticed how rich and creamy the cheese was. The pepperoni was light and had a perfect amount of spice behind it. The sauce was flavorful. The most notable part was the crust though - light, crisp, airy, and delicate.   We both cleaned our plates - the only things we left behind were the olives. We also ordered a dessert - creme brule - it was one of the best I've ever had. We were both full, but we didn't feel like we needed to be wheeled out to the car in a cart. It was the perfect amount of food. It was also pretty inexpensive for what you get. This is high quality fine dining with great atmosphere and attentive staff. This is a new date-night spot for me. It's also inexpensive enough to make it a regular spot.  Had a chat with the owner who was waiting on us most of the night, and he seems like a great guy. We could tell that he loved his business. I like supporting local businesses, and this 5 star review is one of the most deserved that I've ever given."}
{"text":"Caprese Salad, Lucia and Adrianna were absolutely delicious!!! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Been waiting to try this place for a while to feed my pizza addiction. I take it this spot depends on word of mouth because you would never know it was there unless you went to Handlebar-J's or paid attention while you hit Jack in the Box at 1am. Anyway wood fired pizza that is excellent, lots of nice combinations, we had the special called \"Juania\" that had spicy sausage, caramelized onions, and Jalapeño. Nice little wine list that had some Italian classics, very affordable bottles no more than $40. Overall a great spot to kickback and have a few bottles and pies. I have to say lastly that the quality of everything was great, extremely fresh and creative combinations on the pizza and apps for example the Caprese salad came with Burratta cheese as well which is something I haven't come across."}
{"text":"I've had Bosco's bookmarked for a few years and never had a chance to try this place. Decided to give this place a go today and boy have I really missed out on a really good place. Shame shame on me.   It's a small place that is somewhat hidden but we had no problem finding it. They have a decent amount of outdoor seating but indoor is quite small. About seven or eight tables. Very homie with a long wooden bench on one side with throw pillows all over the bench making it very homie. Most of the tables are two people tables but they do push the tables together for bigger parties. They also have an open kitchen. I think it's has a really nice ambiance. Somewhat loud cause everyone's enjoying their food.   Well, we were started off with some tasty olives and sour dough bread which I thought was really good. Olives weren't to sour and very tasty. We ordered the Roasted Seasonal Vegetables with Burrata. Today's veggies were Brussel Sprouts. My favorite. Very fresh and really tasty. Really loved it. The Burrata was lite and really went well with the Brussel sprouts. Really good dish.   Next, we got the Lucia pizza which had sausage and mushrooms. My wife was a little worried it was going to be salty but it wasn't. Sausage was fresh and really good. Mushrooms were really fresh. All the ingredients were really fresh. It was a good sized pizza and the crust. I enjoyed the crust. It was not too thin and not to thick. A little chewy but everything came together. It was a really good pizza. Probably the best I've had on this side of town.   For dessert, they have so many choices and the owner recommended the Lemon Sorbetto. It had lemon sorbet in a real lemon frozen. I was really surprised. Very light. Not to bitter. Very refreshing. Really good.   So we came to Bosco's on a Friday night but pretty early. We beat the crowd. Our server greeted us quickly and brought us water and our own bottle. There were at least three or four different people serving us and making sure everything was okay. Excellent service. Friendly service which followed the homie feeling inside.   I would say I really enjoyed our whole meal at Bosco's. Great food. Fresh food. Really good service with a wonderful ambience. The prices were even reasonable. All I can say is I can't wait to come back. They have speciality pizzas on the board and can't wait to try them plus their desserts. Need I say more.  Enjoy."}
{"text":"Great pizza! Nice atmosphere. I like the Lucia - cheese, tomato sauce, sausage, and mushrooms. My wife likes the Biaggia - prosciutto, figs, four cheeses, and arugula. Not a ton of options on the menu but that's because what there is is enough :-)  Check it out if you're in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Love! Amazing quality of food, love the quaint ambiance and rustic decor, and the service is phenomenal! We will definitely be back! Perfect little spot for a date night! :) pizza was delish!"}
{"text":"Checked this place out last night, and I thought it was great. Everyone who worked there was really nice, pizzas came out pretty quick, and food was great! Atmosphere was also really cute & the patio is decorated nicely."}
{"text":"Fantastic pizza spot.   I probably come here once a month when I'm up in the area.  Really nice owner and staff.  Usually sit at the bar and watch them fire up the pizzas.  Favorite pizza is the Carmela which has spinach, onions, and sausage.  Have tried many of their other pizzas as well and all have been delicious. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Small and un-assuming.  The pizza is excellent if you like real Italian thin crust done in a real wood burning oven.  Slightly burnt crust, fluffy edge and chewy. Service is prompt and friendly. My wife and I shared one salad, which we thought was little small, however the lettuce was cold and didn't come out of a bag like many restaurants. They make their own sparkling water which came in a very cold bottle - a nice touch.  Wine selection is small, but reasonably priced. The patio is small, so get there early if you want to sit outside.  We will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Not sure if I'm too happy I order a pizza 37min before I arrive and the place is empty and they are just finishing making my pizza to put it in the oven? I sure hope it taste as good as the wait time?"}
{"text":"Best wood fired pizza I've had by far. Love this place!! This place is tucked back on a side street and has quite a bit of outdoor seating. Being from North Dakota we took advantage of this and had our awesome pizza out on the patio. The owner came out and checked to see how we were doing. Super friendly guy and if I didn't say it already three times...this pizza is dope!! Highly highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Excellent.   Wife and I wanted to try something new. After seeing a good review for Il Bosco in an AZCentral story, we gave it a shot. It lived up to the hype. Great caprese, fried raviolis were excellent, and we got the Joanna pizza. Quality crust, good meat, nothing to complain about.   Bonus: they give you olives and great service."}
{"text":"A great little intimate spot and the pizzas are wonderful. Afterwards, ask for their homemade amaretto - spectacular."}
{"text":"Found this place after a quick scan of Yelp and we were very glad we did. Excellent food, service, and healthy wine pours...what more could you want? We started with the meatballs and they were phenomenal...a must try! After the first glass of wine was finished I ordered another and was pleasantly surprised to find around half a bottle in my glass, what service!! Finally, the main course arrived and the pizza was phenomenal. Crispy crust which you would expect at a wood fired pizza joint and the freshest ingredients. You can tell they really take pride in their food...   In summary, if you want pizza in the Scottsdale area look no further than il Bosco!!!"}
{"text":"Ok, why is it that when it comes to writing REALLY good reviews, or REALLY bad reviews, I usually (not always) get it done straight away. But when it comes time to write the less than 5 star but more than 1 star review I procrastinate. In any case, here's my review of il Bosco, finally.   Where to begin, well, when you price your pizza in the same range as say Pizzeria Bianco, and you model your whole concept on them as well (more on this later), you better be phenomenal. But lamentably Il Bosco isn't phenomenal, theyre ok, the pizza is good, just not great. That said, the owner must have cajones the size of Texas to have priced his pizza in the same range as Chris Bianco's, or maybe its just his ego that's over inflated hence the over inflated price. As I've already said, its not bad, its just not $12-$15 per pizza great, the crust is good, but so delicate it cant handle a trip up the street a few blocks without completely collapsing into sogginess (I tried to take one home to my bro). I deduced that this must be the reason I saw 3 customers come in for take out and all of them had to wait as their pizza was cooked, after their arrival. They simply will not cook it until you are there to pick it up, which means you will always have a bit of a wait. We also had the meatballs al forno, which were not only small, but one of them was burnt, and I mean black spot burnt, but they served it to us anyway. Again, 2 of the 3 small meatballs were ok, they were good, but not, \"hot damn I'm coming back here again soon\" good, and the burnt one was not good at all of course. The caprese salad was probably the best thing we had there, but again, it was good, not great. The wine selection was decent, although I would say the reds are a better selection than the whites.   Now back to the afore mentioned similarities, like Biancos, Il Boscos menu features 2 salad choices, 2 small plate choices, and a variety of pizzas. Again just like Bianco's, they also offer house made mozzarella and bread, though the bread seems suspiciously dense, thick and un-Italian, not to mention nowhere in the vicinity of Bianco's quality either. This is where the menu similarities end though, Il Bosco offers 4 dessert options, but oddly, save for the the gelato, none of them are Italian, no tiramisu or cannoli here. Along with the gelato, a root beer float, brownies, and creme brulee are offered. What is a French dessert doing on the menu of a decidedly Italian restaurant (judging from the name Il Bosco which in Italian means woods or roughly forest)? Again, that suspiciously un-Italian vibe creeps up.  I bring my tome to an end by saying that a google search of Il Bosco filled in some of the blanks for me, and now I understand why my experience was what it was. Il Bosco is not Italian owned or operated, its actually the artistic retirement endeavor of a retired golf pro who isnt even close to being Italian (maybe THAT'S why the meatballs were so close in size to golf balls, lol). Well I'm old school, and for me, when it comes to better dining, you have to be Italian to make Italian food, and Ill pay more for the luxury if need be. That said, this place is ok if you're really hungry, in the area, and don't mind paying Pizzeria Bianco prices for pizza that is lesser in quality than Il Capo, which is right up the street."}
{"text":"This is a great neighborhood find. If you drive to fast, you would pass it. It's worth the stop in. Great wood fire pizza, salads, and service. Great decor and ambience. Very clean and well maintained restaurant. We will definitely be back in. Thank you !!"}
{"text":"Great service, Awesome pizza and great desserts.  Great little place with amazing pizzas. Hatch green chili pizza is a must try!"}
{"text":"Ok, seriously???  This place is still awesome.  The last time I was in was over six months ago and when I visited just recently, the owner, Bill came out and said, \"I think this is yours, you left it last time.\"  (A scarf) Can you believe that? Thought I should share the good news.  Food is still amazing and the service..... 5 star."}
{"text":"Excellent.  Get the borrata appetizer.  I've had it at a few places here since moving from San Francisco but nothing seemed to compare to SF.  They nailed it!  Pizza was very tasty and the place has a great feel to it.  Great for a date.  A little challenging if you have kids.  It's small and tables are close together.  Might be able to sit on the patio if you have a few little ones."}
{"text":"I work in this area and have visited most of the local restaurants in the past few years. Came in at 2pm for a late lunch on a Friday and ordered the Lucia (sausage and mushrooms). Once the pizza is prepared, it takes 90 seconds to cook in the 700 degree pizza oven. For me, the amount of pizza was perfect. Great flavors, cheese, and sausage. I was also served a small dish of olives which they brine themselves...tasty. To drink I had a red birch beer...very tasty too. The pizza was $7 and a couple of bucks for the birch beer. Very reasonable for lunch in this area.   I'll be back.;)"}
{"text":"I think I may have discovered pizza nirvana.   I am a firm believer that a restaurant should pick something- and do it well. Il Bosco embodies this philosophy completely. The place is small and cozy, with a warm, rustic environment. The menu is simple with very few options- which I appreciate. It's even written by hand by an Italian calligrapher (then copied, but still!)   We were immediately served a small plate of olives upon being seated. I hate olives, but I appreciated the sentiment! I even worked up the nerve to try one, but it just confirmed that I do, in fact, still hate olives. The homemade bread and seasoned olive oil that followed was fantastic though.  My beverage of choice was sparkling water, which even that is made in house! It was served in a pretty glass bottle, tastefully etched with their logo. It was a little spendy at $4, but it was nice to have the bottle at the table to refill my cup as needed. The drink really was the only thing that was a little high priced, the pizza and appetizers were VERY reasonable- low even.  I opted for a plain cheese pizza with red sauce and basil. I had sort of high expectations after seeing that this place only had 5 star reviews, but even still I wasn't disappointed. I've had wood fired pizza at a number of places in Arizona, and this one really stands out to me. I think I could safely say that this is my favorite pizza in the valley. The crust is perfect. Not too fluffy, not too thin. Crispy parts, with doughy bubbles that are chewy in the center. The sauce was the perfect balance of savory and sweet, and I could taste a hint of red wine. The cheese was out of this world. I actually meant to ask the owner (who was waiting on us) about what made the cheese so fantastic. I will next time for sure.   They knew my dessert weakness, and had creme brulee with berries on the menu. I couldn't resist. I went against the owner's recommendation of the Lemon dessert, and I'm glad I did. The creme brulee was amazing, and each berry on top was ripe and sweet.  Seriously, I have no complaints about this place. It was a great date night dinner and I enjoyed my experience from start to finish. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"My favorite local pizza date night.  Definitely prefer over Cibo. Priced fairly and the bread is to die for."}
{"text":"Very cute (small) neighborhood restaurant. Amazing specials in addition to the already amazing menu. Pizza is to die for.  They had a special pizza that was a white pizza, which usually I wouldn't order but this one had bacon and an egg on top. AMAZING! Toasted ravioli appetizer was also amazing. Friendly staff and very fast service. Great place to take out pizza as well. I will be back!"}
{"text":"LOVED the pizza! Little neighborhood place with great, casual atmosphere. A few cozy tables inside and decent size patio outside. We are TOUGH pizza critics and this place is now on the top of the list. Going back for 2nd time in a week. Female server was very easy going and pleasant. Whole thing was totally relaxed and delicious. Owner present and engaged.  Will up this rating to a 5 if it's as great again...... AND if no one takes the offensive-smelling garbage out during our meal and stinks up the whole place. It's a good thing we were finished eating, because if we hadn't been, we would have had to abandon the meal. Poor staff judgement to do that. Poor management judgement to leave the trash long enough to smell that bad and to not clean the bin."}
{"text":"What's not to like about this great little Pizzeria?  Tucked away next to Handlebar J's, this cozy place has all the charm you would expect from an owner that has a passion for creating an authentic Italian experience.  We have visited Il Bosco now on several occasions since its opening, and have yet to find a flaw in the service or food.    Having the owner personally wait on you is always a nice touch in a locally owned restaurant, and Bill makes sure that you always feel welcome and appreciated.    Il Bosco has an excellent wine list that compliments the eclectic selection of wood fired pies, including a refreshing Procecco that really hits the spot on a warm Arizona evening.  These guys even produce their own sparkling water!  Complimentary in-house marinated olives and artisan bread baked fresh daily make a nice start to the meal, while Il Bosco's version of Caprese salad will make you think you've died and gone to heaven.  The fresh, local ingredients Il Bosco uses makes all the difference, and has this starter bursting with flavor.  Chef Dennis is the \"mastro pasticciere\" at Il Bosco, turning out crispy/crunchy deliciousness from his 700+ degree wood-fired oven.  It is obvious this ain't his first rodeo, and is happy to explain his technique to anyone who is lucky enough to grab a front row seat at the bar to watch him in action.  The pizzas he serves up are nothing short of amazing.  The Biaggia - a goat cheese, fig and proscuitto really took me by surprise and has now become one of my favorites.    Last night I had the Domenica - a spicy sausage and leek pizza that redefined my opinion of what a sausage and leek pizza should be. :)  There are pizzas for the less adventurous, I encourage you to go to the Il Bosco website and take a look the menu, then call for a reservation to experience this outstanding Scottsdale treasure!     Support your local restaurants, folks!  They are what gives a city it's uniqueness."}
{"text":"So happy I found this gem. The wifey and I were in Scottsdale for approximately 2 seconds for work. We were starving, took to yelp and found Il Bosco. It's tucked away in an unassuming lot but the pizza is decadent to the max. Some of the best pizza I've ever had. The restaurant itself is small but the decor and outdoor patio are gorgeous.  Great service, GREAT food, I dream about the prosciutto, fig and goat cheese pizza."}
{"text":"Lovely, quaint place away from the usual Scottsdale & Shea crowd.  Great pizza, amazing service and attention to detail.  The proprietor is warm, friendly and knows his italian food."}
{"text":"Fail.  Walked in on a weeknight around 7 p.m. Tiny seating area all but full. One 4 top remaining. We asked to be seated there. A worker said that he'd rather we sit at the bar. Well, um, you have an open table and 2 people who want to sit and spend money here. No, I don't \"do\" bar seating to eat dinner. I'll sit at a bar if I want to knock back a drink or two, maybe have an app. and then take off. Sitting at a bar is not a comfortable way to relax over dinner and unwind after a long day.  So, no thank you. Despite awesome reviews that suggest the food is good. Attitude is important, too. There are ways to handle this kind of thing. And, there are ways to not handle this kind of thing.   Probably will not make another attempt to try this place. I don't need attitude at the end of my long day.  NOTE: To the person who decided to call me out - by name - over this review, this was my legit reaction to my experience. I'm glad you had a better experience. Clearly many reviewers find that this place offers amazing food. I wish I'd been treated well enough to have been able to discover this for myself. No need to call anyone out by name, sir. Our experiences are our experiences. The Yelp community can help one another by providing honest feedback.  Second update: I've been debating whether or not to write this for a while. First off, there wasn't just one, but two fellow Yelpers who chose to call me out by name for the above review. Not cool! Like it or not, it's a legit recap of my experience. And, I was able to get one of those people's reviews taken down. No idea why the other stays put. Whatever. Here's the reason for this update: five months after I posted this review, the owner reached out to me via private email. Props to him for that even if it came five months after the fact. However, in his explanation, which was, actually, not unreasonable, he decided to say that I had \"stormed out.\" Well, sir, that isn't true. How is it that I made such a memorable impression if I was in and gone in under a minute and it was many months ago? You said to our request to sit at a 4-top and I quote, \"I'd rather you sit at the bar.\" You didn't say something like, \"I'm sorry but that table is reserved and we'll have another table in a few minutes.\" Had you said that, sir, we very likely would have stayed. Clearly your food is very good; I dine out a lot and I rely on Yelpers to give good advice. Congrats for the good reviews on your food quality. But, don't take an opportunity and turn it right back on me saying that I \"stormed out\" before you could explain. Just for future reference, because it is truly awesome you can fill your restaurant, and serious congrats for that, it's not your customer's fault that you are full up. A friendly, \"we'll have an open table in just a bit\" works. \"I'd rather you sit at the bar\" doesn't play well. Good luck."}
{"text":"Since I'm on a never-ending quest for the best pizza with figs on it in the world (life's too short for quests of any actual importance), I had to check out the Biaggia, made with goat cheese, fig, arugula and proscuitto. It put forth a decent effort, but needed more fig and goat cheese. However, the crust was dreamy and the service was friendly, which sort of compensated for a few extra dollops of flavor-balancing pizza toppings. Il Bosco also offers small, tasty desserts, topped with Sweet Republic ice cream. Double local business points for ordering one of those after (get the brownie, warm.)  The bill came out 50 bucks for two pizzas and three desserts, which I'd consider a good deal for ze quality. The crust is truly awesome, the patio's relaxing and pretty, and the free olives are always appreciated. You can pretty much taste the integrity in the pizza at this little local spot, and you probably should if you find yourself in the area."}
{"text":"We were on a mission, not one of pizza in general, we just didn't want to go home. So we roamed the streets of the North/Central Valley.  It started with a late breakfast with drinks which kept taking us North and then East, eventually arriving at Il Bosco.   We were the only patrons in there at the time the staff was hustling and bustling.  Come to find out they had a large catering event that evening (love their portable wood fired pizza oven)  and they had also started the preparation of a Superbowl party they were catering on Sunday.    Even with all the Prep going on  Bill greeted us upon entering.  My accomplice (Anna M) had been telling me about this place and we finally stopped in.  Each of us decided on the house Pino Grigio and we decided to split the Biaggia.  I came to this decision with some reluctance, I love fresh figs and find that dried figs can be overly dry and strange when sliced on a pizza or bruschetta  and when it is more of a jam it is often too sweet or applied in a quantity that overwhelms the palate.  Appropriate in their place but often not done well figs can be hit or miss.   I was reassured by both Bill and Anna that all would be ok.     It wasn't long before the pizza was before us.  This was the perfect personal sized lunch pizza (just smaller than the pizza's at Bianco's) . Fresh arugula,  Prosciutto, 4 cheese, evoo  and fig; each cheese was identifiable but none was over powering.  The salinity  of the cheeses and prosciutto really lent themselves amazingly to the lightly sweet caramel earthiness that was the fig component of the pizza.  A perfectly measured drizzle of fig puree, intermingled with extra virgin olive oil and the green peppery nature of arugula... I was sold on the Biaggia.  But what really made me think perfection was the crust.  Having just eaten at Bianco's earlier in the week the essence of their crust was still fresh in my mind as I compared  flavors and textures.  Il Bosco totally wins, tender chewy and crispy, light and slightly sweet not overly toasty or \"burnt\".  The bottom of the crust was cooked at a heat high enough to give the pizza a sturdy base without altering the tenderness of the crust.    Just when I thought it couldn't get any better I was introduced to the house cured olives.  These were heavenly, ripe, flavorful, gently cured and far from the salty, brine-y  commercially available olives commonly offered up at other establishments.   I noticed they sell them by the jar and I regret not picking up a jar before I left, as I find myself  daydreaming about these rich dusky pearls.   Oh well it is not like I needed an excuse to go back but this will give me a reason to go back sooner than expected."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza with fantastic ingredients. Ordered the Valentina with sausage and it was a wonderful spicy with sweet finish thanks to the honey they add. I highly recommend for a quality wood fired pizza."}
{"text":"Great vibe ! Delicious  Pizza. Will be back often."}
{"text":"We needed pizza, and we needed it now.  But not the kind of fast delivery or bake at home kind. No, we wanted GOOD PIZZA. And lo amd behold,  Il Bosco was a stunner. The place has a great patio area, though in the smaller side,  it had ample seating.  We ordered the meatball al forno and they came out quickly and piping hot.  Seriously amazing meatballs! Then the pizza came out not long after. The brick oven they had was the secret to making one of the best pizzas we've enjoyed in AZ. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Very Good fresh wood fired pizza. We came here for lunch and had a sausage, mushroom, cheese and fresh basil, red sauce pizza. It was baked in a wood fired oven and it was absolutely delicious, served piping hot, right from the oven. The owner goes out of his way to make it right, using fresh ingredients and keeping it simple. We had a root beer and a cola soda from a very old company in NY. Again, the owner brings in this product because he thinks it's the best. Inside and outside seating. It's a nice place & maybe a little hard to fine, but it's worth a little effort. The finished product is well worth it. Give them a try."}
{"text":"This is the best pizza in the valley.  It is a small pizzeria, tucked away in a quiet shopping center.  Use your navigation system because it is worth finding.  The pizza is amazing.  I love the Biaggia.  The desserts are excellent too.  The owner is personable and friendly.  I can't imagine anyone having a problem with this place unless they expected a large, hip restaurant.  In that case, they can have their crappy pizza.  My husband and I will keep returning to Il Bosco."}
{"text":"Best pizza I've had in Scottsdale. Wonderful staff. what can I say- this place is great!!"}
{"text":"A small restaurant that does provide some amazing pizza. Had a simple pizza with sausage and pepperoni and was just amazing. I like how they serve their olives as a snack for the customers. It may be hard to find but it is right next to the handlebar."}
{"text":"I have always had a great experience at this understated restaurant. The first time I ate here I ordered pellegrino and I was impressed that they make their own sparkling water. This set the stage for everything being made from scratch with fresh ingredients. The gentleman who I presume to be the owner, wearing a plain white t-shirt, and the staff were all very welcoming and non pretentious. The appetizers (meatballs and veggies) and pizza (Adriana + a few extra toppings), were excellent. I have been here both on dates and with my kids (ages 5 and 7) who like to sit at the bar and watch the pizza cooking in the pit. There is a small TV that sits in the corner by the bar which is convenient if you want to see the score of a game, and much more appropriate than an obnoxious big screen on the wall."}
{"text":"Awesome wood fired pizza!  My husband and I just happened to drive by and decided to try Il Bosco and are so glad we did!  We shared a Caprese salad and a pizza and it was PLENTY for the two of us.  The Caprese was seriously the best I have had.  It had house made mozzarella and was drizzled with yummy balsamic glaze, olive oil, and a pesto sauce.  We got the Elana pizza - salami and Gaeta olives.  SO good!  We are so happy to have found such a gem so close to our home!"}
{"text":"Very good italian style pizza. Visited this evening and got free olives and bread as a starter. They have a nice outside seating area in a quiet side street. The service was very good and the staff friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"The pizza is cheap (price) for the quality given. I've had 3 pizzas from here and they were all fairly decent, but their Biaggia pizza is the best by far. The prosciutto layer covering the entire top of it would cost a quarter of the price they ask for it, and the flavors go amazingly well together. The light sweetness of the figs balances the saltiness of the prosciutto, and the olive oil, parmesan, and arugula finish the visual appeal and further melds the flavors together. Incredibly savory all together. Unfortunately, I couldn't really taste any of the goat cheese, and the prosciutto make the pizza difficult to eat without a sharp pair of teeth.   The only cons are $3 for a bottle of water (premium filtered) with no option for free tap water . The lower than expected cost of the pizza evens it out though. That and I ever got to try their bread, don't know why some people got it and I didn't, but maybe it's because we didn't order an appetizer? (confirmed with the owner, the bread is complimentary but is usually served with a starter because they don't think serving bread with more bread (the pizza) really makes sense) The free olives were nice and tasty."}
{"text":"Il Bosco was a very pleasant recommendation from a friend. We sat outside on the small patio and let the aroma of burning oak wood waft over us as we ate. We had the fried ravioli appetizer followed by the prosciutto, fig, & arugula pizza and the sausage & mushroom pizza. The pizza was delicious. I'd put it on par with another valley favorite, Pomo.   What made the experience special was meeting the owner Bill and his son. Bill is an example of a life well-lived and his warmth and enthusiasm was pleasant.   We don't live close by, but when in the area, I would definitely go back to Il Bosco."}
{"text":"Look, I understand people dillude themselves into thinking a restaurant that's contrarian and hip has food that magically tastes better.   And don't get me wrong, the pizza here was good. But not great.   The place is a dive, which is usually find, but the place smelled like bug spray. The server (I think owner, too) was nice, but not overly friendly.   The food was certainly fast, and the bread was good.   Overall, the place is fine. But it's getting great reviews simply because it's counter-culture and organic."}
{"text":"From the super friendly owner to the excellent excellent EXCELLENT pizza I can't recommend this place enough.  It's my go-to restaurant when out of town friends visit and I want to impress. It's the restaurant my girlfriend will always say yes to. It's the place where I get the best olives around.  Just go, you've spent too long reading this. Go now and enjoy."}
{"text":"The best hidden gem in Arizona. This place doesn't just have the atmosphere that you want for a nice lunch, or romantic dinner, it has the artisan hands-on quality you would expect from the best pizze in Italy.    They give you a plate of in-house marinated kalamata olives that are just to die for. I could eat just the olives all day. They also give you fresh baked bread with the best olive oil you've ever had. At this point in the meal, I was already thinking about my next trip back.   Both the antipasti, packed with flavor and excitement. The meatballs, in an excellent marinara, just perfectly cooked and seasoned. Roasted veggies with burrata, equally as great. The burrata was fresh, light, creamy, and tart; paired perfect with roasted beets. We also tried the special, peppadew peppers stuffed with Italian sausage; one bite of intense flavors perfectly combined. I'd try any special they offered, and I will for future visits.  The wood fired pizze? Amazing, to say the least. We had the Elana, sopressata, olives, amazing tomato sauce, and fresh hand formed mozzarella. I will be back to try every single one on the menu.   I have nothing bad to say about this place what so ever. The owner, who served us, is friendly and very accommodating. They have something very special going on here. They have made a regular out of me.  Update: Went back again today, yes two days later. This is the kind of place where you find yourself saying, \"Yeah maybe I don't like anti-pasti because I've had it before and it wasn't very good\", but you order it here, and it becomes the best thing you have ever had. I suggest, if it's something you wouldn't normally order, order it here, because it may just become the best thing you've ever had."}
{"text":"My boss used Il Bosco to cater a function we were hosting at his house.  They brought a 900-degree brick wood burning pizza oven on wheels to his house, and made the pizzas fresh.  It was all very cool!  With a staff of 3 (2 people making pizzas and one person serving as a \"hostess\") and enough pizza to serve 20-30 people, the cost was $750.  They also throw in Caesar salad, which was really tasty!  The couple of pizzas I tried were all very well made and tasted really good.  My only gripe was that they charged a $150 \"service fee\" (which is in addition to any gratuities given to the staff), which was not disclosed at any point during the reservation process.  Other than that, the experience was flawless!"}
{"text":"Went here the other day for lunch and it was excellent. Both I and my friend had different pizzas at lunch and we were both very impressed. I'll definitely be back to try out the rest of the menu. The service was very good as well.  The only negative to the place is the seating is very cramped and it's pretty small in general. Not a huge fan of almost knocking elbows with the people at the tables next to me.  The food and service are outstanding and make up for it however."}
{"text":"This was an amazing Gem! Small place big flavors. The experience was great and we felt like we were in a small trattoria in Italy."}
