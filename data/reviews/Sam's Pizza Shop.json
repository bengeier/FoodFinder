{"text":"Best Pizza Ever!! The crust is absolutely amazing! Every time I come to Canonsburg, I have to stop by and pick up some Sam's Pizza!"}
{"text":"This pizza joint has been the best experience in the area. The dough is fresh and the toppings are just right. Besides the pizza, the hoagies and the strombolis are a feast for the taste buds as well. The friendly welcome by the workers is a nice added bonus as well. You cannot go wrong with Sam's pizza!"}
{"text":"Out of all the pizza in the Pittsburgh area this place is my personal favorite. The pizza is thick with ample amounts of some killer sauce. The topping options are vast and the prices are amazing. 20$ for a tray of pizza is unstoppable in my opinion it's 4 boxes of pizza. Only heads up is they don't take credit cards but they have an ATM right in store so it's really not a problem at all!! If your in the area I recommend stopping by and trying some of the best pizza around!!"}
{"text":"Sam's pizza has consistently been my favorite pizza since I was just a kid and I am now a mother of grown children, Sam has moved, but the people that took over his shop still come through with the magic that Sam started way back when.  It's always my first stop when I come home to visit Canonsburg.    The only other pizza I have had in my life that is as original and as good as Sam's is Beto's of Pittsburgh. Every other state I have lived in and the dozens of pizza shops I have tried don't even come close to Sam's. Everyone I have ever introduced to Sam's has fallen in love with the pizza too. I wish I knew how to make this pizza myself, and I have tried! Close, but no cigar.  The new (now getting old) owners do a great job. I absolutely recommend trying this pizza if you visit Sarris' Chocolate factory. Put an order in, then browse around Sarris and come back to pick up your delicious pie. It's pick up only. THE BOMB! :D"}
{"text":"The food is great, but that's not what makes Sam's so special. It's the people, the owners are so friendly and personable. You feel like your visiting very special friends when you walk in... Excellent food and charming service"}
{"text":"Nothing like sams pizza use to be when sam was cookin it  up, but through the years the new owner has been tweaking the crust the sauce and it seems to be improving. don't think it will ever be like sams again but its still a great cbg staple pizza and still the best in cbg. the hoagies are a treat try an italian...yum yum.wish they delivered but i think half the luster is going to the shop, use to have sam telling you how many pieces you could have, now you just order and go. good stuff."}
{"text":"When you walk in you feel canonsburg at its finest. The mayor is the co owner and he does a fine job. The pizza is square slices and very good. I recommend getting the whole tray, you will want some for later! I'm a huge fan."}
{"text":"Crust is thick and crunchy and resembles cardboard. The sauce is bitter and has no seasoning; just a bland tomatoey goo. The pepperoni is put on the pizza after it's cooked, so it's ice cold and floppy. This pizza is going to be gross to any outsider who didn't grow up eating it. The place is clean and the service is very good and friendly, which is the only reason I gave it more than one star."}
{"text":"Sam's pizza is flat out amazing!  The best shop in canonsburg and one if the best in the area!"}
{"text":"The Italian hoagies from Sam's Pizza Shop are great. I think that the only place that has better Italian hoagies anywhere near here is Fiori's Pizza in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"The pizza seems different than when sam made it. The sqaure slices are small, the crust is good the sauce is just okay. It's in an old house which the Sarris Candy factory had to build around because they refused to just move to another old house."}
{"text":"Excellent little pizza spot in Canonsburg. The pizza is extremely cheap, even with toppings. I really like that you can buy pizza by the slice or tray.  So often I don't want a whole pie and it's nice to be able to grab a slice or two. This isn't the best pie I've ever had but for the price it can't be beaten."}
{"text":"I crave this pizza all the time.  My husband and I only eat heavy carbs once a week so I don't get to eat it as much as I'd like, but this pizza is seriously so good.  Since I'm not from Pittsburgh, I was really confused about the cold cheese at first, but it somehow works.  And I love how the dough is so fluffy and airy yet still crunchy.  It's just perfect.  I want some now.  This review is making me hungry.  I'm glad my husband knows how to order because thinking about having to call and order makes me nervous, haha!  Oh and you need cash.  That also makes me nervous, because I hardly ever carry cash.  But despite the qualities of this place that induce anxiety within me, it's worth it!"}
{"text":"A lot of people love Sam's Pizza, but I always found it to be mediocre and overpriced."}
{"text":"If I were on my death bed I would probably request a box of Sam's pizza with mushroom and pepperoni."}
{"text":"Pizza by the slice! Sam's is my husband's favorite pizza joint in Canonsburg. He's a very frequent customer, and Sam and his family always treat him so nicely!"}
{"text":"Gotta love small town America. The Mayor of Canonsburg actually owns this pizza shop, and his name's not Sam. Let's go back a few years, Sam's pizza was actually owned by an older Italian fellow named Sam. He was a hoot too. Say you wanted ten slices of pizza and he had nine slices ready, you got nine slices. He'd never make a whole pizza (28 cuts is a whole pizza) just to fill an order. On the other hand if you wanted ten slices and he had twelve, you'd GET twelve slices and pay for twelve slices. He was a real Pizza Nazi to borrow a Seinfeldism.  Today \"Mayor Dave\" is a little nice to his customers. The pizza still tastes the same. Sam made sure Dave knew how to make the pizza exactly the way he did.  Square cuts, garlicky sauce, a bit on the sour side for my tastes, and lots of cheese. Toppings of course are extra but you get a lot. The crust is crispy and not chewy. Thin and airy. If you're looking for thick pizza with a chewy crust, go elsewhere, they only serve it Sicilian style. Great sandwiches too.  Located right next to Sarris' Candy and Ice Cream Shoppe on Adams Ave."}
{"text":"Awesome pizza place! My wife's favorite for 30+ years.. We grab a tray every time we pass through Canonsburg. ."}
{"text":"I absolutely love the pizza here! It's by the slice so you can get a different topping on each piece if you want! Quality ingredients and always fresh plus it's very reasonably priced !! Their newest topping is bacon and it's a must try!!"}
{"text":"First time here, found out the hard way they don't except plastic! There was a ATM inside not a fan about paying $2.50 to get money for a $5 order but it is what it is. Nowhere to sit and eat here so i has to eat out in the car. The crust was good , but and yes there's a but hardly any cheese on it . They add the pepperoni on at the end so it's not cooked and the sauce pretty much tasted like a tomato. Not my style of pizza . But hey I tried it !!!"}
{"text":"Honestly, if I wanted a pizza that looks and tastes like I made it myself I would not pay $32 for it. Maybe some like thick, mushy crusts and uncooked pepperoni, though. Also, you can't pay with a credit card. But don't worry; they have an ATM in the shop with a $5 fee per transaction. Score!  (My first and only order was around July 2015. )"}
