{"text":"Great little bistro with excellent coffee and food!  Excellent home made pastries--love it for breakfast and lunch!"}
{"text":"SB3 as I call it, has the best coffee and pastries ever! The staff is always accommodating and friendly!  I can't wait come back again and again."}
{"text":"This is an incredible little coffee shop with so much more!  I love the breakfast options and the pastries are awesome!  There's something for everyone!  Great place to meet in downtown Harrison City!"}
{"text":"Great Food! Coffees are great and makes a great place to hang out with friends and be social. Gone there a few times and the staff is great!"}
{"text":"Food was good. Service was so slow we almost asked for money back. Not a good place to go for a work lunch. Takes way to long"}
{"text":"I want to give five stars and if the service wasn't so slow or awkward I would. This area needs way more places like this.   Food and coffee is really good.  Custom milkshakes are great. Everything just takes forever to come out and the kids working there are not properly trained. The layout is also completely awkward. The line to order forms through the seating area. Please train these kids better. My last visit I ordered two milkshakes to go and only one came out to go. It was also a solid 15 minutes for a milkshake with no one in the place."}
{"text":"It took eight employees ten minutes to make one sandwich, one soup, and one salad.  I wouldn't mind if the final product was worth the wait.  The salad was par with Panera (except $2 more).  The sandwich the Buzz  though was a few slices of meat on a small bun.  Very disappointing.  I am always willing to pay more and wait but this food was mediocre and over priced."}
{"text":"A group of us went to Sweet Buzz for lunch. We sampled several things on the menu. I got the Queen Bee Burger....beelicious !!!!!. Another friend had one of the salads filled with quality ingredients & wow the homemade soups, great on these cold days. We would recommend Sweet Buzz to anyone. Prices were fair for the amount you get I Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Great coffees and smoothies but service is hit or miss... I had great service once the other times made me not want to come back."}
{"text":"I really wanted to give this place a good review but I would put it in the \"overpriced for what you get\" category.   My wife and I recently had lunch there and we both ordered salads.   I ordered a cobb which was 90% weeds.   Maybe this is a breakfast/coffee place and not a place for lunch.   That's my guess."}
{"text":"Went there on a Friday at lunchtime. Husband and I both got the footlong hot dogs.  He got a side of tater tots and I got a cup of chili.  The food was delicious and enough to feed four people.  The chili was the best I've ever had outside of my own.  I can't even describe how the hot dogs were covered in toppings.  Setting was very homey and comfy.  So happy to see a sandwich shop open in Harrison City that has really good food.  Eat there, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I loved Sweet Buzz.  As soon as I walked in I felt that this was a cozy and relaxing place.  The staff was very nice and helpful.  They had lots of choices to choose from and their \"shakez\" are delicious.  The staff all had smiles on their faces the whole time that made me feel welcomed and relaxed.  They had very good food so for me, this was a positive experience and I would mention this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!  Every time I'm in town I go and buy coffee to bring it home to Texas.  Food is sooo Fresh and amazing!  Gotta go!"}
{"text":"I have visited this place three times, each time greeted with smiling faces and courteous service.  The coffee is good, the atmosphere is great, and the breakfast menu delicious. I have had the scrambled egg dish.  Lunch will be my next visit! This is my new favorite coffee shop."}
{"text":"What an amazing place...comfortable yet very high class, fabulous food and wonderful service..I can't wait to go back to try another dish."}
{"text":"Food was fantastic. Very pleasant staff. Relaxed atmosphere.  So far, only been here for breakfast, but sure intend to try lunch. Cinnamon roll was to die for!"}
{"text":"Great little place so glad it opened in our township.  The witches brew coffee is delicious.  My husband and sons are huge fans of the burgers.  The salmon BLT is a must try."}
{"text":"I am impressed with this place.  I've been here for breakfast twice now, and both times it's been fantastic.  Be advised, they stop serving the breakfast menu at 10:30am, and if you're in a hurry consider calling ahead to avoid the wait time.    Sweet Buzz offers a few loose leaf teas and specialty drinks, including smoothies and chai lattes, for non-coffee drinkers.  They also have gluten free bagels and wraps on hand!!  Pretty rare for a breakfast cafe.  I was not aware of that during my first visit, so I had the \"skillet\" - eggs scrambled with veggies and meats and served in a mini skillet atop signature tater tots.  For my second visit I ordered the \"breakfast buzzer\" on a gluten free bagel - ham, spinach, cheese, bacon, and fried egg, also served with tater tots.  Both were excellent, and both were full meals that would easily last me an entire day.    Definitely a good spot to hit."}
{"text":"I go here about once a month. My reason for going is the food is very good and has great healthy options. The staff is always so friendly. Yesterday I ordered two dinners to go and ended up coming home with extra soup before they closed. I thought it was so nice that they offered me a quart instead of throwing it out. I suggest getting the avocado turkey blt or one of their 26 homemade soups."}
{"text":"I loved this place! One of my friends lives close, so we visited for lunch one day. I loved all of the coffee d√©cor and beautiful colors. You reach the counter and are greeted by so many delicious looking pastries. The environment as well as the staff were very welcoming and friendly. I love the feel of the local hometown coffee shop where the employees get to know the customers and the owners have their hands in the product instead of a chain coffee shop.  I saw they had chicken tortilla soup on the lunch special menu, so I was ecstatic since it is my favorite. However, when I went to order they were out of it so that was a bummer. They have a pretty large menu consisting of breakfast, burgers, hotdogs, sandwiches, soups, and quesadillas. I decided on the BeeLT with tater tots. The bread was hearty, the bacon was delicious, and the tater tots were perfect! We went during lunch hours and I was worried about the amount of time it would take for our orders to come out based on other reviews. However, they came out extremely quick so I was very impressed!    I am dying to try the breakfast - who doesn't want an egg and cheddar waffle sandwich?! I would also love to try the coffee and a pastry! I highly recommend the Sweet Buzz Bean & Bistro!"}
{"text":"I've never tried their food but have gotten lattes from here on a few occasions and the majority of the time they are excellent."}
{"text":"Great local spot! The hazelnut latte was amazing.  We tried the Waffle sandwich and the Breakfast Buzzer.  Both were very tasty and filling. I will definitely return to try lunch."}
{"text":"The food here is great. The wait time is ridiculous. Over 15 minutes to get food. If you are in a hurry you just can't stop here. Even if you are the only person in the place."}
{"text":"Quite good coffee, and excellent breakfast options.  I stopped in and got a breakfast sandwich (egg, portabello mushroom, swiss cheese) on a glutein-free bagel, which was very good, and the Witch's Brew coffee, a dark roast, comparable to French. The coffee was good, not exceptional (sorry, I have a high standard), and I'd get it again. The Sweet Buzz roast, which I also tried, was quite good, more of a medium roast.  The place was quite nice and quiet -- as a coffee shop *should* be (I'm glaring in your direction, Starbucks) -- and there were a number of reading options. You have to love (okay, you don't, but I do) a place where there are books. (Note to younger yelpers: \"books\" were popular 20th-century devices that contained paper with writing upon them, sort of a solar-powered Kindle. And \"Facebook\" is not an actual book, sorry.)  Anyway, the food was good, the coffee was good, the service was ... well, it took a while. Bug or feature? It might be a lesson to be patient, to slow down and to savor the moment ... and the coffee."}
{"text":"Hmmmmm. Not sure where to start!  First, the atmosphere is fun and a sweet spot for coffee or lunch.  The greek salad is awesome! Plenty of chicken and good greens, almond milk latte that is not outrageously priced. Yummy chocolate covered oreos, good sandwiches!   I have been here at various times and they always have my food out faster than a Panera, and it is twice as good!   All employees I have interacted with have given good recommendations and been welcoming !"}
{"text":"Our order took excessively long, 20 minutes for two sandwiches and even longer for the coffee. Our order came back looking awful and completely incorrect, missing ingredients that were in the name of the sandwich. They get two stars because the people were friendly and it wasn't a hassle to get a refund."}
{"text":"I was glad to see this bistro take over the spot once belonging to a bank.  This little plaza is located on a prime spot along Route 130 and it certainly would be a shame  to see a vacant store front.  Having said this, I finally had a chance to stop in on a Saturday.  I had no idea they offered so many different food options.  I figured they had coffee, teas and light bakery and snacking items but I found out that  they also have a great breakfast menu that is served daily up until 10:30AM  During the later part of the day you can order burgers, footlong hotdogs, various sandwiches, wraps and at least 8 different salads,  soups, and quesadillas. I am curious in trying the Salmon BLT with chipotle peach sauce.  By the way, everything ending in an \"s\" is converted into a \"z\" on their menu to go along with the bee theme.  Clever. Oh, and yes, there are plenty of good coffee and dessert options to choose from.  They did a wonderful job converting this former bank into a fun and inviting bistro. The only drawback that I noticed while I was there is that the ventilation system seems to be lacking and all the cooking odors weigh heavily in the eating area and on your clothes."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, warm, inviting and for lack of a better word hip. It is a locally owned business, and as it says on the door owned by a veteran.  They have inside seating and a nice outdoor patio that pets are welcome on. The food is great. I have been hooked since the 1st time I tried it. The only down side would be that sometimes the food isn't as good at it was the 1st time. Staff is always nice and helpful even though some seem a bit young. All and all it is a great place, my newest favorite place. I am hoping the longer they stay in business they better they will become. They also seem to use natural fresh ingerdiants."}
{"text":"I love this little bistro. My only issue is that there quality is inconsistent. When there drinks and food are made right they taste amazing, but too many times my drink was made wrong. The price and proportions of food and drinks are great though. I just wish the quality was consistent."}
{"text":"Love all the food here. It is such a nice and inviting atmosphere to meet friends for lunch or have breakfast with the family."}
{"text":"After a few not-so-great experiences here, I decided to update my review from last year. First of all, prices are higher than what is stated on their website. Example: Bacon Cheeseburger is $9.50, website says $8.50. Also, they no longer have cole slaw, but website still says it is a side for sandwiches and such.   I used to order their tortilla salad that comes with chili, jalapenos, avocado, tomato, cheddar, red onion, corn, cilantro & tortilla chips. I always substituted the chili for chicken - and have done this on at least 6 or 7 occasions. One day for lunch, I ordered said salad with chicken and went to pick it up, the girl tried charging me $2 extra for subbing chicken. I told her that I have ordered this multiple times and have never been charged an upcharge. She said, \"well you should have.\" I asked her if she was the one who took my order over the phone, and she said she was. I asked, \"Well, then why didn't you mention it to me on the phone?\" She said she didn't know. Well then, I said, either charge me the regular price or I don't want it. Needless to say, she didn't charge me the extra $2. She said, just keep in mind for next time. Well, I've order the tortilla salad with chicken a few times since then, with no extra charge.   More comments: I work nearby and have ordered salads and sandwiches a few times. More than half the time, there is a mistake. We're talking about for one salad or one sandwich and a side - not like I calling and placing orders for an office of 15 people.   Lastly, I have been in here to eat a few times, mostly last fall, and tables will go un-bused and dirty for a long time. Sometimes, there is actually very few places to sit because of all of the tables with dirty plates on them.   I will most likely still stop here on occasion, because there is not much in Harrison City. However, Sweet Buzz is sadly no longer my go-to lunch stop."}
{"text":"Great food, great service, fresh ingredients, and good size portions. Will definitely be returning here! Don't forget the Rice Crispy treats!"}
{"text":"One of the best breakfasts I've ever had - Got a chocolate chip milkshake and bagel with eggs, bacon and a whole lot of other stuff & my mom got a waffle sandwiched with eggs in between. Quick to come out with friendly service - 10/10 recommend"}
{"text":"We love sweet buzz. We make sure we visit everytime we are in the area.  The Jamaica me crazy coffee is worth the trip alone.   We tried their breakfast for the first time and lived it.   We each had breakfast sandwiches.  They were huge!!! All the hot sauces are a nice touch as well.  Not only is this place good, the ambience is also awesome.  Such a perfect little hometown cafe!"}
{"text":"Fantastic surprise. Found on yelp, staff very friendly and pleasant. Food excellent. Will stop again if I'm nearby for sure!"}
{"text":"I really really want to love this place and give it 5 stars. The food is incredible, atmosphere is comfy and cute, and I love small business coffee shops. However the service needs a lot of work.   The first time I visited was not long after they opened. I ordered a cup of soup that they had on special. It was lunch time so I expected them to be busy. My friends and I took our seats and waited for our cups of soup to come out (we all ordered the same thing). We waited...and waited... and waited. Finally after 20 minutes one of the \"servers\" came over and asked us what we ordered. We told her, and she disappeared into the back. about 5 minutes later we came out with our soup and rolls of utensils in napkins. Starving, I undid my napkin to find that I was not given a spoon. I went back and waited in line for another 5 minutes to ask for one. The soup was really great, and the bread that came with it was just okay- probably would've been good if it wasn't cold. The \"server\" definitely was having her patience tested and seemed to be stressed out because she rolled her eyes a few times and mumbled things under her breath.  Giving this place a second chance, I decided to get a latte to go on my way to class. Thank goodness I had extra time on my hands because after I ordered my latte (with no line in front of me) they gave me a number and told me to have a seat. It took just under 8 minutes to finally get my latte. Delivered in a paper cup with no lid. Coffee isn't incredible but its not bad either.   This place absolutely has potential and as a business I understand that they need to get their kinks worked out. I would suggest this place if you aren't in a rush. I will be back again hoping to have a better experience."}
{"text":"This place was great!!! The service was even better!!! keep up the good work!!! I had the iced green tea which was made to order.  The lady I had was wonderful and very friendly!!!  Customer service at its best!!  thanks again!!!"}
{"text":"I love love love sweet buzz! The environment is so cozy, the employees and the customers are so friendly and wonderful! The prices are good and the portions are pretty big. The soups are homemade and out of this world! One of my faves is the spicy black bean. I reeeally like the coffee! There are so many flavors and you can customize your coffee any way you like. They also have almond milk, which most places don't have as an option. Go visit! :D"}
{"text":"Delicious breakfast - had the breakfast buzz bagel with egg. Coffee was pretty good! Had a Latte but wished for a stronger espresso flavor. Great atmosphere for meeting with a friend or doing some work. Very comfortable."}
