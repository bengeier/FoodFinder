{"text":"This is yet another restaurant in Chinatown which specializes in homemade dumplings and Northern Chinese cuisine. 

I came here only because Yummy Dumplings was closed for lunch on Wednesday, so I ended up here to satisfy my dumpling cravings. 

I ordered the pork & chives dumplings (boiled) which was so so. The skin was thicker than I'm used to but still acceptable & you get 16 dumplings for $7.99. The XLB soup dumplings came next. It was presented in the usual bamboo steamer and you get 10 small bite size pieces. It certainly wasn't my favourite because the skin was thick & some seemed under cooked. The pork filling was okay but the soup content wasn't very consistent. Some were not replete with soup when biting into them and overall wasn't very satisfying. Also it's typically served with some fresh ginger on the side to make your dipping sauce but they don't here. Maybe their Xian style dishes are what they are best known for but it certainly wasn't the dumplings."}
{"text":"Really disappointed. We ordered two dishes and wait like an hour for the fish. Maybe it is because we did not order the right thing. But generally i would not go there again."}
{"text":"I am giving them five stars because I know how hard they work everyday and they produce good authentic Chinese food.

The service quality might upset some people, but it won't be too bad. The owners are very friendly, so make sure to choose the lamb peta"}
{"text":"Really good Northern Chinese restaurant. Came here with 2 friends and got the Lamb Pao Mo, Lamb noodles, and Beef Noodle Soup. They were all super filling, the noodles were handmade and really chewy. I would definitely come here again."}
