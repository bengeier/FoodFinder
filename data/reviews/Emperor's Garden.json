{"text":"The place was almost empty when we arrived on a Saturday afternoon, only 3 other tables were filled. The service is average and the servers don't seem to speak much English or maybe they are just very quiet. We ordered the seafood chao mian and the general's chicken. It was very good, and greasy like most of the authentic Chinese food I've had. I would go there again. If you're looking for five star butt kissing service you wont find it here, but if you're looking for authentic tasting food its a good pick."}
{"text":"Good shanghainese food. Their dishes aren't too greasy, which is a pleasant change from your typical Shanghai food.

We ordered the beef sesame rolls. Wow, did not expect it to be that spicy! But it was pretty good. The chili oil soaks into the roll and it kind of tastes like a Dorito after awhile. Still good though.

I'd come here again if I'm in town and craving some light Shanghai food, for sure. Also, if you write a review they give you 10% off!! :)"}
{"text":"This is the place you don't to give it try.  Wait for 40 minutes for just 2 beef noodle soup. And food is so bad and salty. And price is too high. Also ask soup and noodle separate apart.  After go home noodle and soup still in one container. The noodle is so soft. Can't even eat. I will give this place -5 star.  Hope this place will close down soon."}
{"text":"Walked in randomly on a late afternoon looking for sichuan food. Not authentic Sichuan as marketed. Blah food."}
{"text":"The food tasted like someone shitted in my food and put pee in my tea and water. People took a shit in the urinals and peed in the sinks. Not to mention they force you to tip them for shitty service and horrible food. Panda's Express is more Asian than them, and it's not even Asian. I also heard disturbing noises. I never ever want to go back there ever again!"}
{"text":"Don't go! The service is awful and the price is pretty high. Please be careful the amount on the bill before you sign it. They will automatically charge you 18% gratuity without your permission; even you only have three people dining. They should be shame of their service and very high gratuity."}
{"text":"If I can I would give 0 star. Nasty place!! Open the door first you can get the smell like shit and the floor already turn all black. Super nasty. Bad service. Waiting about a hour for a cup of soy milk and a piece of egg roll. I know they don't care all the review here. I just wait share with you guy how bad experience I got here. Totally fail."}
{"text":"If you are looking for delicious, authentic asian food, this is the best place to go! I come here for the lamb, but they have so many other options as well. Service is great! The waiters speak both English and mandarin."}
{"text":"This place is a disgrace to Chinese sichuan food. We went to this place to celebrate my daughters birthday and it was a disaster. The food is expensive and no good at all. I ordered crispy duck for $16 and not crispy at all. Ordered the Sichuan crab $40 and Sichuan pork intestine $12 as I said it was a disaster. The waitress and waiter are counting their tips from table signaling each other using their fingers how much they got from each table. Don't know how can this place survive. Sichuan food here is all oil and not even hot or spicy. Wow not even a half star for this place."}
{"text":"I shouldve used yelp before i went into this place. This place seems to be remodeled and claims to offer taiwan breakfast and sichuan style cuisines. So we ordered steamed dumplings and fried duplings, soy milk, crispy duck etc. And these things tasted no thing like chinese, worse than avg midwestern american chinese food. And the bill was add 15% tips dispite i disliked the food. The thing amazed me was there was about ten people waiting in the line most of the time. Use yelp, PEOPLE."}
{"text":"Very poor service, slow, gave us the wrong check, and auto charged 18% gratuity, DONT GO HERE!!!"}
{"text":"We went for dinner the first night of CES (probably one of the biggest shows in Vegas).  Every restaurant in the area was packed, including Emperor's Garden.  We had to wait about 15min for our table.  When we got our menu, we were surprised by the care the owner took to explain the background of the cuisine as well as origins of well-known dishes.

We were intrigued by the story of the Husband and Wife Beef Lung Slices (lung has been replaced by shank and tendon in modern times) so ordered that.  It came in a deceivingly spicy red chili oil, which was just mildly hot and had a complex fermented flavor which we really liked.  There was great contrast in texture between the tender shank and crunchy tendon.

I've been on a hunt for authentic Dan Dan noodles, which I was excited to find here.  This one was perfectly spiced with lots of ground Sichuan red peppercorns that linger on your tongue making it salivate.  This stuff is addictive if you like the sensation - I do.

The mini pork dumplings had silky smooth delicate skins which helped take away the spice of the other dishes.

The fish filets in Hunan sauce were super tasty with just the right amount of spiciness - enough to not overwhelm the other flavors.  

The string beans were fried perfectly without any hint of greasiness and well seasoned, reminding me of good french fries.

A native Sichuan customer we met gave it a 7 out of 10, which is pretty good for this side of the Pacific.  I've got to make a trip to Chengdu to find the 10/10 restaurant he's talking about."}
{"text":"Food are ok, portion is relatively big, but very expensive.   Salty Tofu brain is good. Egg pancake is ok. Youtiao is too much you. Fantuan is ok.  Jiucai hezi is ok, but expensive. Chili pepper oil is not good, typical Cantonese restaurant type of chili oil. 

When I ordered a lot of food and ask one waitress if we ordered enough, she said it depends.  But clearly it was too much. She could at least say we ordered enough food."}
{"text":"This is the worst Chinese breakfast I ever have. From a stand point of Chinese, I will NOT recommend! Food is so bad and expensive. We got scammed by the famous brand they put on their store! Cheaters!"}
{"text":"Oh no, no-no-no-no.  How could so many things go wrong?

While I wore my \"asian-service-glasses\" to this restaurant (please see explanation in my Boiling Point review), this was just a terrible, terrible experience.  The owner of the restaurant was clearly overwhelmed and she could not muster up any sort of decent service.  I've seen much busier restaurants so I actually questioned her competence plus that of her waiting staff.  Here a few things that happened:

-we were told to go sit down at our table...while the previous occupants were still there
-no waiter came for a long time after being seated
-there was a good 20 minute gap in between courses...
-...until we realized that had forgotten multiple orders of our meal (I'm not talkin' about (1) order, more like 6 orders of dumplings, 4 orders of something else, another order of noodles...it was pretty bad
-their explanation to their forgetfulness? Sorry we were so busy. Yikes! 

I've been known to be swayed by food even when there is terrible service, but not this time. The food was bland, sub-par and not even worth good service.  Dishes were extremely oily and the silverware was dirty.  The bathroom had a wastebasket that was overflowing and clearly being ignored.

The only good thing was we had a great busboy who was attentive when we needed waters/napkins/etc.  Not a very good silver lining I'm afraid...

AVOID AVOID AVOID. There are tons of other restaurants in this plaza.  Go there and never look back."}
{"text":"Brought my book club here for an evening of discussion and great Chinese food. In addition, the website boasted 1.99 glasses of house wine. We checked with server and asked about the wine specials and were advised, no, they were 2.99. Still a great deal, wine for all!

The place was packed, the 6 of us ordered our entrees and were told it would be awhile as they are busy. Within 5 mins, one meal came out, 5 mins later, the next and so it went for 5 entrees.

One of our group ordered combo fried rice, which finally came out 15 mins or so after our last served entr√©e. They should call this \"fried rice\" white rice with peas. Looked awful, boring and bland. The taster confirmed this was the case. As was the case with the tofu meal ordered by someone else.

Garlic eggplant was good, lo mein was good also.

The kicker came with the bill, three glasses of wine $14.98. Also on the bill, 3 side orders of rice, which were not ordered or received.
I call the owner over and advise we were not charged correctly as the wine should be 1.99 according to webpage or even 2.99 as confirmed by the waiter. Well, this woman just screamed, \"website old, not good prices, new owner, no you pay this price!!\" on and on. When we advised the waiter stated 2.99, she then yelled at him, handed me back the bill and said \"no, pay this thank you\".

Really?? 

Then, as we were leaving after paying the bill , she comes and says \"give us another chance, we will give you free dessert next time and we will change the website\". I think not madam.

There are plenty of good places to eat in Chinatown, this place is not one of them.

From their website: Apparently, you pay what they say, regardless of what is advertised.

{"text":"My son (ABC/American Born Chinese) went w/ his girlfriend & a friend (African American) to this place.  They were placed at a distant corner table. For 10-15 minutes, no server came to us.  When he finally got their attention, they gave them plastic utensils.  The service, of course, was terrible throughout the meal. 
When my son got the bill, he was charged 21% on top of the total bill (for tips, I guess).  That was highway robbery & illegal! They should be reported.   And they made no disguise in discriminating against anyone who didn't speak Mandarin, especially if you have an African American in your group!"}
{"text":"Horrible service. My family have been coming here everytime we visit Las Vegas, however this time, their service was less than mediocre. Their fried breadsticks were extremely hard and difficult to chew. When we brought it up to the chef, the chef told us \"who the fuck cares\" in Chinese and stormed back into the kitchen."}
{"text":"This is the only place in LV (that I've found) that serves Mandarin/Taiwanese style breakfast: sao bing, yuo tiao (Chinese pocket bread and donuts), and dou jiang (soy bean milk).  They also serve xiao long bao (Shangai-style steam dumplings), fan tuan (rice roll w/ yuo tiao and pickles) and a bunch of other Mandarin-inspired treats.  They serve breakfast from 8am-2pm, which is convenient for both early and late risers, but the taste is no where near anything you would get in Monterey Park or Cupertino...But hey, this is Las Vegas, so where else are you gonna go?  
Located on the second floor of \"Chinatown Plaza\", this is one of the very few non-Cantonese style places I've found in LV.  I've also had several dishes from their regular menu, I even had my baby's Red Egg and Ginger party there, and each time I walked away dissapointed.  I've had the Five Items Cold Dish (they just drizzled chili oil on everything), Shark Fin Soup (pretty flavorless, unless you douse it with the red vinegar), Spicy Braised Shrimp (quality of the shrimp was great, but flavor was too flat), Sea Cucumber in Brown Sauce (they only gave us the small, hard pieces), Peking Duck (NASTIEST \"Peking\" duck ever!  The meat was so dry, and the skin fatty and limp), Scallop in Garlic Sauce (the quality of the scallops were outstanding!), Crab in Ginger & Scallion (they didn't even crack the crab before sauteing, so no flavor went in the crab), Steamed Whole Bass (very overcooked), Baby Bok Choy and Mushroom (can't really mess this one up), Special Szechuan Fried Rice (can't really mess this one up), Ba Bao Fan (didn't all all resemble ba bao fan.  They just mixed all the ingredients and steamed it in a cylinder shape), Plate of sliced oranges and grapes (can't really mess this one up), Honey Walnut Shrimp (tastes like something Panda Express would make), Sichuan Spicy Beef (NASTY concoction of flavorless sliced beef that has been slightly deep-fried, then drowned in chili oil), Tofu and Spinach Soup (They substituted spinach for bok choy), and Sichuan Cold Noodles (can't really mess this one up).
All in all, it's definitely a 2-star place, but they get another star for being the only place that serves sao bing yuo tiao."}
{"text":"Horrible experience.   They already added tips in your bill and did not tell u!!

The waiter saw you writing tips on the
 check? but they did not tell u they already charged.  u are like an idiot in their eyes. We paid tips twice! How shame on them!!

Never come again."}
{"text":"Ill agree with the others and say that this place was completely empty when we came in.  but besides that the food here was great!  i got the szechuan beef cause i have a cold and needed something spicy to clear my sinuses.  it came out and it was easily enough for 3 people!!!! my GF got the sweet and sour chicken and it was freaking amazing!  neither one of us could finish our meals.  they only lost a star because of the horrid drink service.  it took them till after we got the check to give us a refill on water  (about an hour).  i understand its because they dont speak english well but cummon!  im coughing my lungs out, give me a drink. 

that is all"}
{"text":"As an avid lover of Taiwanese breakfasts, I was extremely excited to come here and try the egg pancake and XLB. 

My family and I ordered 2 servings of XLB, potstickers, vegetarian dumplings, sweet soy milk, salty soy milk, egg pancake, and youtiao. 

The XLB was mediocre. Not the freshest and could improve.

The potstickers had beef filling and were extremely dry and oily. 

The vegetarian dumplings were oversteamed. The wrap was dried and the filling was mushy. 

The sweet soy milk was pretty standard but the salty soy milk tasted sweet...

The egg pancake didn't make it out because my family and I had enough and left. 

The food totaled $40something but they added 15% tip. We ended up paying $50 flat. Be careful of hidden charges. There were no signs indicating a tip charge would be added. 

Don't come here unless you want overpriced and disgusting food."}
{"text":"We arrived at the restaurant during lunch time (on a weekday).  There were two other customers at the time.  We stood at the entrance for almost ten minutes, none of the waitresses/waiters/manager even bothered to greet us, so we sat ourselves down.  Another ten minutes go by, still, no service.  The waiters are just sitting at the bar chatting.  So I had to walk over and get a set of menus from the manager's table.  After we were done looking through the menu, I had to walk over and get someone to come and take our order.  The food came out pretty fast, considering there's almost zero customers.   I had read through yelp, customers complained about the restaurant over charging, so I checked my bill, and... of course, we had been over charged as well.  When the waiter came back to get the bill, I showed him the mistake, he didn't even let me finish and just grabbed the check out of my hand and walked away with a HORRIBLE attitude.  When he came back, he just threw the bill and walked away.  
Horrible service!!!!!!  I was shocked."}
{"text":"WORST RESTAURANT EVER. 
(@#$@#!$ so mad that i even made an acc just to leave this reply)

This restaurant does not even deserve 1 star!!!

I went there with my family/friends about 2 weeks ago for lunch and decided to go in after looking at the menu posted on the outside. 
However, when we sat down and looked at the menu on the table, it was a completely different menu. Not only were there less choices but the prices were also ridiculously high (close to doubled the price) compare to the menus posted. 

After discussing with my family/friends we decided to stay. We thought maybe the price is higher because it is a bigger portion. 

So we ordered around 4-5 dishes.  
When the dishes arrived, i was EXTREMELY shocked to see the small portions on the table. 

the service was HORRIBLE. it seems like the waitresses/waiters purposely try to avoid direct eye contact with the customers so they dont have to do anything. whenever we raise our hand they look down (right away)

After eating the mediocre dishes we got the check which came down to $95. (EXTREMELY overpriced & TOTALLY NOT worth it)

After we paid, i went outside to double check the menu and looked for the ones we had ordered to match the prices. 
I saw that the prices posted on the outside was almost 1/2 the price in the menu we were handed. 

So i went in and asked one of the waitress why we were not given the menu on the outside and she said, \"that menu is for white people for people who know english and have different taste\"
Her reply just made me so angry. Basically they mean that just because we are asians we have to pay double the price? and its not like we dont know english. and who is she to judge what i like to eat? 

Overall, i would NEVER go back again. and if anyone still wants to go please ask for the \"white people menu\" because it is a lot cheaper and surprisingly the same portion with more choices to pick from."}
{"text":"The food there is not fresh and tasteless with high price. This is the first and last time I ordered food there. Save your penny!"}
{"text":"We visited there during our stay in Las Vegas. Fortunately, I hadn't taken a look at its review on the yelp before we went there. The food service is very good and we had a good time and especially authentic yammy sichuan foods there."}
{"text":"We so regretted to have visited this place. We ordered 2 traditional chinese dishes. One is pork on preserved vegetable. The meat is tough which is the opposite what it should be and the preserved vegetable only taste extremely salty. The other dish was Gailan which is so hard to screw up but they managed to do that: the vegetable was tough as any un-cooked over-grown gai lan can be. To worsen the situation was the price. We noticed that similar dishes here sell about 40% more than Joyful Garden which is on next small plaza down Spring Mountain Rd from this restaurant. To make it the worst dining experience for our Vegas trip was their enforced 15% tip on the bill."}
{"text":"I went here for breakfast the other day.  For typical Asian breakfast place it was ok.  I might just feel that way about Asian places because I'm use to it.  We ordered the soy milk, oil sticks, sweet tofu, Shanghai dumplings, and green onion pancake. The oil sticks were really oily, but that's kind of expected because of the name.  The sweet tofu was tofu covered in this sweet sauce thing which my friend really likes.  I think it tasted better at KJ's kitchen.  I loved the Shanghai dumplings.  I really like it when they're a bit juicier, though. The green onion pancakes were nice and crunchy and flakey.  My friend really liked this place, but he's not use to Asian breakfasts.  This place was okay, and I would come back here again."}
{"text":"Sorry but the price kinda pretty high for an ordinary taste of their shrimp and scallop. It was $18.95 per plate and served with a raw cabbage. The place is pretty big enough but not really a lot of patrons during dinner time when we went there."}
{"text":"The restaurant is shabby but the food was decent; however, the service ruined the entire experience. No service whatsoever; had to ask for everything. Waiters were slow and walking around, not making eye contact with the customers. To top it off, the lady (owner) tacked on an automatic 15% tip (we had a party of 5).

Looking at other yelp reviews, it seems this is a common occurrence with the tacking on an automatic tip...even for a party of 2.

Run from this place!"}
{"text":"I agree with some of the reviews about some menu items being plain. The dimsum wasn't that good but the shrimp and vegetables was great, as well as the other seafoods. The fried rice, likewise was good. Nothing extra special about this place but will come here again...;-]....maybe..."}
{"text":"If you decide to eat here, take a barf bag. This may be some of the worst food I have ever eaten in any type of restaurant. We ordered the hot-and-sour soup for starters. It tasted OK, but had the consistency of a light pudding.

Next on the list were Spicy Sichuan Pork and Spicy Sichuan Fish, both rated hot, hot, hot. The bowls arrived at our table. The pork turned out to be pork belly--unsmoked, uncured bacon--apparently boiled in grease with a few vegetables added to contrast with the reddish fecal color. The fish, tilapia, was served in another bowl of the same disgusting grease, in which it had apparently had also been boiled.

$40 poorer and not sure whether we could drive back across town without having to stop at a few public restrooms we left. The waiter asked if we wanted to take our uneaten dishes with us. We only smiled sickly and declined."}
{"text":"For Taiwanese style of breakfast.  The  seasamebaked bun is as hard as a stone.  Disappointed!"}
{"text":"I would give it 0 star if I could. The food is very mediocre but way overpriced. The most outrageous thing is that they serve you small pickled vegetable buns purchased as frozen food from the supermarket and they just heated them to lukewarm. How could you tell?  By the label on the paper underneath the bun. It is a complete rip-off."}
{"text":"We visited for Taiwanese style breakfast based on the store name (????). Food quality is so bad and pricy! We will never come back again. Sorry."}
{"text":"This place is  possibly the worst Chinese food restaurant I've ever had.  I'm talking about fried pork chops and the meat was actually rotten.  the walnuts in the honey walnut shrimp was burned to crisp.  btw,  way to much mayo on the honey walnut shrimp.  had to send it back.  please,  for your health and your palates.  Stay away from  this place. The food here is not edible for human consumption."}
{"text":"This restaurants is so bad I don't even know where to start, shit food taste with annoyed faces from the server every time you ask for anything.
When we sat down at the beginning, we realized our plate had a greasy spot that's clearly wasn't being wash off from whoever had the last meal, that right there is just pure gross..
I swear this will be the last time I ever dine in here, don't waste your money, there are plenty of food here in china town."}
{"text":"The food is not good, and the service is really bad. They added the tips to the bill by themselves, which is very rude."}
{"text":"Bad food and service AND they try to cheat you on the tip!

I should have listened to other Yelp reviews but I was craving some of the menu items that you can't find in other places.  The food was mediocre to bad and the portions are small for the price they charge.  The soy sauce soy milk had a burnt taste; sesame pancake was hard; I won't go on. 

When I received the check, the server already included a 15% tip (for lunch) when he provided no service (one of our items never came, teapot was never refilled, had to flag him down for every little thing we needed).  I paid with credit card and on the signature slip, it said \"PRE-TIP AMT\" next to the total which clearly included tip.  For folks who don't look at their bill closely, they will end up over tipping for non-existent service."}
{"text":"Very bad experience, we ordered one dish per person but ended as still hungry. The dishes were so small. each was like snack size. But the prices were higher than that of other restaurants. I will definitely not come back. Anyone wants to try, double your orders and pay 2.5X."}
{"text":"I DO NOT recommend this place. Food is mediocre, service is mediocre and on top of that, they automatically charge gratuity to your bill regardless of the party size."}
{"text":"Can't believe it is two stars. Food is awful. Tasteless, and not refresh. Dirty carpet. Mandatory tips. Worst."}
{"text":"My family and love this restaurant. Every time we have come, we are warmly greeted by the hostess. The food is always tasty and fresh. You must visit this restaurant when next you are in Chinatown. Well worth climbing the stairs to the second story for a great meal."}
{"text":"Richard Pro returns with a fresh review after 6 years of being MIA from this location.

As mentioned in my previous review, this place used to be SWAMPED. When I finally returned, it was virtually empty. Unable to resist sampling their changes, I proudly present my updated 1-star review.

I ordered what they used to be famous for: xiao long bao. It came out lukewarm as though it was microwaved. There was no soup in the dumpling, and the meat was very tough. One of the worst xiao long bao's I've ever had, to be quite frank.

Next on my list was the salty rice roll. This was excellent, and I give them full marks for this. However, it's such a banal dish that it's really child's play.

Finally I had the spicy chilled cucumbers. This was absolutely awful. When prepared properly, the spicy sauce is hot and addicting and delicious. When made incorrectly, however, it's just like mixing a cold vegetable with tons of hot sauce. It won't taste good.

1 star."}
{"text":"This place was so bad. Easily the worst restaurant I've ever visited. The soymilk was made from powder and all the food we ordered tasted awful and seemed to be leftovers from yesterday. The dishes were way overpriced. AVOID THIS PLACE AT ALL COSTS. We will never come here again."}
{"text":"Meh.  I've experienced better. (haha Yelp took the words right out of my mouth).

So I came here over the weekend looking for some Taiwanese breakfast and figured Chinatown must have it.  Got to Chinatown, saw \"YongHe\" outside which means Taiwanese breakfast so I was pretty excited when I went in.  

I'm grateful that they are attempting Taiwanese style breakfast but I feel bad for the people that actually think this is good.  Being a Szechuan restaurant, naturally they would have a lot of spicy food.  I ordered a beef wrap/roll and some Chinese donuts (youtiao).  Pretty much it was different cuts of beef marinated in chili oil that's usually served as a cold appetizer but then they stick it in the middle of a shaobing (Taiwanese-style bread). Kinda of a lazy way of doing things. I guess it is smart, using the same ingredients for 2 different dishes haha. Not really authentic. The youtiao was pretty good.  Kinda hard to mess THAT up since it is just frying dough!

Their soymilk tastes like soymilk and the fantuan (rice roll) looked ok but that's hard to mess up too.  Overall for a Taiwanese breakfast place, it's whatevvvss.

Service wasn't the greatest either.  We waited over 15 minutes to hand our order slip to the waiter and the tea took forever to arrive.  It seemed like they were understaffed but the restaurant wasn't even half full.. Maybe dinner service would be better but it's not really on my radar anymore."}
{"text":"Worst dining experience anywhere ever. Have to correct our order twice. Food is really salty. Don't bother going there, please!"}
{"text":"Omg!  I just had the worst shanghai steam dumpling and the preserve pork is too salty. I failed to run a yelp review prior to going in."}
{"text":"Not bad but nothing special.
I certainly would not recommend, or go again!
States full bar , but wine was only Merlot or Chardonnay 
Did not have nay Asian alternatives to offer. Seemed to want to sell liquor!"}
{"text":"If you like Szechuan, go here!  I love szechuan chicken and picked this place b/c they have a szechuan menu.  The regular szechuan chicken was good, and the special spicy szechuan with its own section on the menu was deadly spicy and equally good.  Their hot and sour soup is also good (it is very thick and chunky).  One person in our party like their shrimp noodle bowl.  Someone else ordered mushroom chicken and thought it was so so.

Our waitor could be best described as completely indifferent.  He literally sat at the table and behind us and ate and drank his own food while we were eating.  We had to turn around and waive at him if we needed anything.  No prompt refills or responsive service whatsoever.  It was 4:00 in the afternoon, which I assume is a dead time."}
{"text":"I had been visited the Sin City more than 20 times for busienss and personal trip. Before the China Town was up and running in the late 90s, I usually had to stay with the Casino's meals. It's not great, but was OK. For the breakfast though, I usually would rather to go to the McDonald, IHOP or Denny's, than to go with the Casino breakfast buffet, which made you felt silk after three consecutive mornings.

Then the China town was open, and I had much more choices to select from ever since. The best one that I like to go visit is the Emperor's Garden. It's lunch and dinner were quite good, authentic Chinese foods. What I like the most is the traditional Chinese style breakfast. It offers fresh soy bean milk, green onion Pancake, Fried fritters, Chivas boxes, among others. I would order different dishes every time.

For those ones who come visit the Vegas, and are looking for some traditional, authentic Chinese food, I would highly recommend this restaurant.."}
{"text":"2people, $98 , I will never forget this price !! Worst Chinese in LV ever!!!!!! Believe me, u will see what dishonest trader they are!!! They add tips automatically, and when I order sour soup fish, they wanna put a whole fish in the soup!! can u believe that ? Because they said that taste is good !! I am a Chinese, but I have never heard that sour spicy soup fish will put whole fish in the soup! Oh , by the way , the smell of the restaurant is sucks!!"}
{"text":"do not go this resturant! they never acknowledge you and you need to do every thing for yourself. finally, they still charge you good service fee  mandatory!!!the food is so so .  very disappoint breakfast experience!"}

{"text":"I hate writing one star reviews but this place is so awful that I need to warn those who are foodies like us.This should get a negative star if available.

We had a party of 18  and was so excited that they seated us so quickly.  However we can not order because all of our group have not arrived. What the f@ck??????    Why seat me? We have 7 kids with us and they served us only their diluted tea. My sister asked for water for the kids at the beginning when seated....waiter shakes his head yes,yes..water for kids. 
Finally my Asian time family has arrived now we can order. We put in our order for all kinds of dishes, ma po tofu, string beans, fried rice, fish filet, stir fried veggies, steam flounder lastly....Water,please, kids thirsty...waitress took our order and yes, yes water.

15 or 20min later the food came...salty!!!!!! all of it...and no water for the kids. we walk over to the same waitress, to ask for some water for the kids..eating salty food. Again shaking her head \"yes, water..kid..water.\"
We finished eating our food and still no water husband got up to ask for water Finally 2pitchers of water came....wait for this....no drinking glasses....wish I knew some mandarin or Cantonese or what ever the f@$k this $hit hole speaks. They even made my sister pay full tips. Nasty people. Never coming back."}
{"text":"I don't think some of the previous reviewers were being fair.

You ARE in an area boasting the best asian restaurants in town - and they're usually relatively cheap, or affordable at least. You had a choice, and something must've made you go here instead of somewhere else. My older brother, nephew and I decided to stop in for lunch here.

Everything on the menu sounds good, and the meny is NOT limited. The sichuan dishes ARE authentic.
They bring out hot tea (infused with jasmine, but not overpowering). I think they do this partly because you DO NOT GET REFILLS. This is a major downside. I wish we would've ordered water instead of cold tea as well. I'd hope they'd refill water...

As a previous reviewer stated, yes - their \"iced tea\" is Brisk Lemon Iced Tea in a can. Disappointing. I wanted a big, cold class of tea. Did not get that. The hot tea is standard. When you order another drink you'd better pace yourself, because all you'll have left is the hot tea, and if you're eating something that requires a cool drink - S.O.L.

Service was good when we got the food. Otherwise, there are two waitresses and they have to run to the kitchen a lot. The younger one is less attentive.

The bathroom door and kitchen doors being visible kind of bothered me, but whatever.
The entrance is nice, at least. They have fish tanks. The kids always want to sit near them.

We ordered:

- Fried wontons (8 - cream cheese/crab)
- Steamed dumplings (8 - not a big fan at authentic asian places, they were out of pan-fried).

   * For some reason, I like potstickers better. Even Ling Ling's. The steamed dumpling pouches always taste a little off to me at some restaurants. Not as much flavor.

- Combination Fried Rice (ham, shrimp, chicken - plenty of egg, just the way I like it)
- Three-Flavor noodles (they bring a plate of dry noodles and a pan with veggies, meat and sauces and put it on top. The noodles are then cooked and it's de-lish. The shrimp is cooked perfectly).
- Scallops in Garlic Sauce (OH. MY. GOD. This was THE best dish, the sauce is to DIE for).
- Sichuan Beef (not too spicy, cooked perfectly).

You also get steamed white rice. We were so full we couldn't finish. I reaaaaally wanted to order honey walnut prawns, but I was too full. That would've been the dish to make me love/dislike the place, for sure.

I cannot say enough about the Scallops in Garlic Sauce, though. It comes with some veggies thrown into the mix, but if I wasn't in a public restaurant I would've licked the plate clean!

We decided to get boxes. I had the brilliant idea to put the plain rice into two separate boxes and poor the scallop garlic sauce over the rice. YUMMY! I would go back just for the scallops and wontons, and end up trying the honey walnut prawns and probably loving that dish as well.

I wish I knew how to make that sauce. I swear...it's magical. Hahaha."}
{"text":"First strike: We order the chinese donut, and 2 main dishes (vegetable and beef)
The beef comes out first so we dive right in because we were starving.  About halfway through we ask our server when our other dish will be coming out.  After about 5 minutes she comes back and says \"we ran out of green beans, do you want to order another dish\"  Um....shouldn't you have checked this when you first put our order in the kitchen?  We decided not to get the vegetable dish and just finish our meal.

Second strike:  They put extra charges on our bill.  They charged us for 3 chinese donut when we only ordered one, and they kept the vegetable dish on the bill.

Third strike:  On the final check that was handed to me, the total had gratuity included.  Really?  Mandatory gratuity for a party of 2?  Whatever.  I gave them my card and when it came back to me for my signature, it said in BIG BOLD LETTERS \"PRE TIP AMOUNT\".
First off, this is the first place that I've been to where they actually had \"PRE TIP AMOUNT\" in bold caps.  It's like they were trying to draw attention to it.
Secondly, W T F?  You include a mandatory gratuity that wasn't mentioned ANYWHERE on the menu, and now you try to get tipped twice by saying the FINAL amount w/ gratuity is the pre-tip amount???
Shady shady.  I won't be coming back here ever again. And if you read this and still end up going, double check your bill.  Who knows how much extra cash this place managed to squeeze out of unsuspecting patrons.

Another thing I remembered, they give you white rice without asking if you want it or not, and then they charge you for it."}
{"text":"We ordered two main dishes,it was like they double the salt for one and didn't put any for the other. They also forced a big tip without providing any service."}
{"text":"I don't write reviews much, but I do for exceptionally good restaurants and exceptionally bad ones. This one falls into the exceptionally bad category.

What a terrible experience! They used to be pretty good a few years back - but trust these reviews, as this place has really changed!! 

Came here over Christmas break 2014 with the family. Being from the Bay Area, we know what a good Taiwanese breakfast entails, and this place is far from it. It was way overpriced as well.

What we ordered:
Salty soymilk: Tasted bland and flavorless. 
Sweet cold soymilk: Way too sweet. Lukewarm, not cold. And $2.85 for a glass of sweet cold soymilk? Average nowadays should be $1.50, maybe $2. 
Egg taco: Edible, but just some plain eggs around a flat pancake. Quite boring. Didn't even have green onions.
Mixed noodles (??): Where are the noodles?? Barely any noodles on the bottom of the bowl with some strings of cucumber. Not worth the $7.95 at all!
Spicy beef pancake (????). The beef was OK, but the pancake was hard and tasteless. Not at all fluffy the way it should be.

The final kicker; they add a mandatory 15% tip. WHAT?? I've only known fancy Western restaurants to do that, and even then it's only at dinner time. They must be losing business and is desperate to try and get whatever they can from their customers. No one's coming back again anyway, I guess there's no harm in ripping that extra tip from them now."}
{"text":"This place serves a decent chinese breakfast - the yo tiao are fresh and the dan bing is decent.  Plus, they have this house special rice roll (fan tuan) that has chopped bean curd with vegetable in it, which is pretty tasty.

BUT...

My family and I went here for dinner and made the horrendous mistake of ordering steamed fish.  The fish tasted like it had been dead for centuries, and I felt nauseous for hours afterwards.  No amount of ginger or soy sauce could cover that smell up.  To make this even more egregious, the waiter had RECOMMENDED this fish to us (it was flounder).  This place may have been good in its heyday, but every time that I've come back, it's only gotten progressively worse.  DO NOT COME HERE."}
{"text":"Guess I'm not the only customer who was taken advantage of with the tips. Had lunch with a family member. Food was so so. When we left I wrote an appropriate tip amount (16%). The following when I went to check my credit card balance, the waitress CHANGED my tip to $10.00 when I spent less than $20.00. Ridiculous! This is probably why they are losing customers."}
{"text":"F this shit.  I've been here many times in the past for breakfast, but what a difference 6 months makes.  Bonus: Public Service Announcement.

Cliff's:
Service sucked, even by Chinese standards.
There were hairs on a plate.
They served the soybean soup 10 minutes before the donuts.  WTF they're pairs.
The soybean soup was clearly microwaved.  How do you know?  The temps were different within the bowl.
Portions are way small.

Lastly, on the bill, they add in their own \"gratuity\".  Granted, I know that they do this because China Chinese visitors don't tip - it's even illegal out there, btw.  So, this joint just adds it to the bill.  Nowhere is this posted on the menu or signage.  I ask about it, and say I pay the food and tax amount, and add in whatever tip I want.

Can a local please drop a dime on these M-Fers???"}
{"text":"This the the most expensive Chinese breakfast restaurant. We have 4 people and we spend about $70 dollars. I was shocked when I see the check. We only ordered about 5 small things including milk and Chinese donuts and the Chinese small steam dumplings which they are already dried inside without any juices and so tasteless."}
{"text":"Worst Chinese/Taiwanese breakfast I've ever had!ever! Don't be fooled by their ads and the innocent people who wait in the line as most of them are just tourists like us. Service is really bad and the manager doesn't seem to know what she's doing. I ordered HOT salty soy milk and it came out as Cold. I told the waiter. He brought it to the kitchen. 5 minutes later, he brought it back and told me it's warmed up but it's still lukewarm. It tastes like it's sitting in the kitchen for a long time or they don't have time/appliance to cook the food right. My friend ordered rice ball and that's another tragedy. The texture is literally like mochi. I really feel sorry for people that ever get a chance to try their food. If  I wish I could give them zero star. Stay away from this place. There are tons of nice restaurants in Vegas to try out!"}
{"text":"I was visiting and noted a lot of Asians in this restaurant and thought it would be a good place to eat. It was not expected to serve the American taste because it is very traditionally a northern Chinese menu. My husband had the wonton noodle soup which was very bland but my congee was good with peanuts and salted fish added to bring it flavor. They served a sticky rice concoction that I enjoyed but their Shanghai dumplings were not very juicy and just okay. I could have done better. I would not recommend this place as the service and selection on the menu is poor."}
{"text":"The only place open today before 11. The breakfast menu is very small.

Interior: Pretty shabby...

Service: Nothing spectacular

Food: the green scallion has too much pepper, covering the tastes of the scallions, the soybean milk is meh, the xiao long bao isnt soupy at all...

Overall: pretty close to AJ :/"}
{"text":"The place is an EPIC Fail.

The restaurant wasn't all that busy when we came and yet, their 3 servers weren't able to bring a menu to our table when we got seated.  Where the hell was our hot tea also?  I thought that was an automatic when you go to a Chinese restaurant?  And then why the hell did it take so damn long for the waiter to take our order, especially since we were right next to a couple who just ordered and we were ready to order then?  Not only that, one of the employees (maybe the owner?) actually sat down on a table next to ours and ate her dinner while we waited for the watier to come by & take our order!  Total BS.

It took a while for the food to come out though and I have no idea why.  Our soup didn't come out first, by the way.  Our noodle dish did.  Then when the soup came, the waiter did not scoop out the soup into the bowls.

The food itself wasn't bad.  The crispy noodle dish that we had tasted ok (although not better than some of the restaurants in Rowland Heights or SGV).  The sauteed chicken with vegetables were commendable and looked pretty healthy.

All in all, I would never come back.  The service was just so poor I would hate to go through the same torture again.  All I did was get all frustrated when seeing what was going on and why it took so long for things to get done around this place."}
{"text":"I will give zero star if I can.Worst experience in Las Vegas.Came in with my friends for breakfast?bad hygienic environment?dirty table surface with full of oil stain?and the food is not fresh cooked?we ordered one hot soup wonton?I even cannot say the soup feels warm.The price is unreasonable high?cold dish like spicy cucumber they charge about $8 ?usually should around $3 in LA?never know vegas people spend such much money for only breakfast?or maybe we choose the wrong place.The food tasted sooooooo bad?that's why I cannot understand the high price.Don't come here if you want a good or even ok breakfast.Never come again?I will tell all my friends about this."}

-misleading advertisement with a chinese sign (?????but it has nothing to to with it.

- rush and poor service.

{"text":"????

????"}
{"text":"Not the greatest Chinese restaurant but definitely not the worst. Dark,  dingy lighting with pigeons eating off the floor, at 11am no less. We came for the chinese breakfast.

Food was okay. Tasteless or at least very little sodium.  Service was okay too. They get a lot of Chinese Mainland tourists, who dont tip, so the gratuity is added onto your bill as a suggestion. Keep this in mind for the other off Strip Chinese eatablishments like Jumbo Buffet and the sort.

It's hard to compare to food in LA, San Francisco, and Jersey/NYC but is easy to see why they're still in business...  There's no good Chinese food around so you start missing the taste of well cooked food. Add that and the plethora of Chinese American retirees and you've got a recipe for business."}
{"text":"Ive been coming here for years. Its right in the Chinatown district. The food quality is very high & very good. You consistently get the same quality every time you come here. If you decide to eat in, the restaurant is cozy with ample table room and is a very quiet setting. Service, however is hit or miss."}
{"text":"If I could pick no stars I would. First off the lady who greeted us was very rude! She told me to wait outside with my 6 month old in the cold and wind! Then when our table was ready she pointed to our table that wasn't still had the people before us food still on the table and said \"go and take care of your baby\", no she didn't take us to out table. After 10 minutes of sitting at the table my father in law got up and got a waitress to take our drink, appetizer and lunch order, yes all at once. Still took another 10 minutes to get our drinks. Food was okay nothing special. The guy plopped the food on the glass and walked away, didn't say a word to us. Seemed like we were bothering him.  Waited for refills and our check way too long. Didn't seem like we had a certain waitress, because nobody came back to check on us. Will not be back here ever. If you want rude people then this is the place for you but I'll be going to the delicious seafood restaurant on the corner, that place was delicious and the owner comes out to talk to you. I recommend that place well over this place."}
{"text":"Today, I was lucky because I went with co-workers who one of them is from the Sichuan Province. He ordered for all of us and got 4 dishes which were all Szecuan Cuisine. He ordered in Chinese and he did not know how to translate in English to us. Please check out the photos that I took for the delicious dishes that we ate.

Emperor's Garden is definitely not for the American Chinese Cuisine, which I can see why this restaurant has mostly bad reviews. You will not find Chinese Broccoli with Beef if so, it may not be good. 

However, the authentic Szecuan Cuisine was really really good and very spicy which I love. 

I will definitely come back here as long as my co-worker is with me."}
{"text":"This is one of the few times where Yelp reviews have let me down... because I LOVED the food here. I came here reluctantly because of the low rating, but my Aunt really wanted to eat some Szechuan cuisine while we were in Las Vegas. But maybe my low expectations were a good thing, because I was pleasantly surprised at how good the food was.

Here's the breakdown!

*Food:
-Pork intestine in clay pot: SO yummy!! This was flavored with a sour and spicy sauce, it was really delicious and the intestine was cooked perfectly. It didn't taste too pungent and it had the right amount of softness. 

-Sizzling rice dish: Delicious. The sauce was sweet and savory, and I loved how it complimented the texture of the crispy rice. One of my favorites from what we ordered.

-Eggplant with garlic sauce: Cooked to perfection! It had the right amount of spice and sweetness and the eggplant was soft with a bit of crisp on the skin.

-Szechuan beef: This was okay. You get A LOT of beef, but it was just all spice and salt and lacked that extra pinch of flavor to take it to the next level.

*Service: It was a little slow because there was only one waiter for the whole restaurant. He was pretty nice and accommodating when he was serving us, but we had to flag him down sometimes. 

*Price: Pretty cheap. Around $10-12 for each dish, which is not bad for dinner.

*Ambiance: The restaurant is pretty spacious, however, some of my dishes weren't very clean prior to eating and I had to switch them out. But that's pretty typical of most Chinese restaurants, so it wasn't a big deal. 

So this is one of the few times where I'm just going to have to disagree with the majority on Yelp. The food is great here and they know how to cook most Szechuan dishes just right. 

*They also offer free wifi inside!!! What Chinese restaurant does that? MAJOR plus!!"}
{"text":"I will not recommend this restaurant. They used to be good two years ago. I dont know if they change their chef."}
{"text":"Had a party of 75 this weekend in the private room. Most of our guests thought the food was great and beer was cheap, but the service was POOR for the price we paid and the reassurance from management!!! Our complaints noted:

1) No water was served until after asking more than once! Anywhere I've ever gone to dine at (buffet or dinner service), water is the first thing served upon being seated. There were no pitchers of water anywhere, and in fact, one of our guests actually went to the bar to get water! When we asked for water to be served on the tables, the wait staff was not very friendly about it, and it seemed we were a bother for asking them. 

2) We chose a buffet style service, which the staff was not prepared to handle our capacity. Even after letting the staff know the approximate number of guests we were expecting (which they reassured us that it would be no problem) food ran out after the 3rd table got their servings and we had a few more tables to go... our guests waited at least 15 minutes or more before the food was replenished and the staff was nowhere to be found when they should have been monitoring the food levels. They were too busy catering to the regular diners, and it wasn't even that busy!

Overall, good ratings for food (thought the soup was bland) and party decor, but POOR for the service our party received. I would NOT recommend this place for large parties of 50 or more."}
{"text":"I really wanted taiwanese breakfast...so I came here.

The restaurant is really tacky. As you can expect from old, run-down chinese restaurants. 

If you're going to order soy milk, yu-tiao, the rice roll and the egg taco, then you can't go wrong. 

If you stray from that (at least for breakfast)--then you might run into some trouble. I was also really craving onion pancake...boy did I regret ordering that. First off, it was a dark, odd color. It looked like the onion pancake was once frozen, heated up, re-frozen, and now re-heated for me. It also didn't have the layers...it was just a blob of onion pancake. It was pretty disgusting...."}
{"text":"Do not go there?They put extra tips on your bill! I paid 178.49 and they put about 32 tip on my bill (because of party over 6). When I check my bank record, I saw $230 for this bill!!!! How could I add more than 50 on my tip? R U kidding me?????? Not going there again. ??? ???? ????"}
{"text":"I think some of the previous reviewers weren't being fair. Husband and Wife Beef Slice is supposed to be beef tendons, plain and simple. The only reason I gave this place only three stars is that the food wasn't as authentic as the one in LA with the same namesake (that's where they started, it turns out). The ground peppercorn spice is tasteless comparing to the real stuff. The \"water boiled lamb\" is otherwise pretty good, while the aforementioned beef slice is mediocre. The Yan Jian Rou has too much fat and wasn't done properly. Overall it's fairly authentic, but not quite up to LA or SF standard."}
{"text":"The service is horrible!!! They do not give any utensils for the dishes. The waiters attitude is bad!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I feel bad for this place since it serves a terrible Chinese breakfast poorly.  I don't think there are too many options around for this in the area but really it should be shut down since it is so bad.  We couldn't eat the dumplings and left a whole tray of it after having eaten one tray between the six of us.  They should try to hire a new chef and revamp the menu, PLEASE!"}
{"text":"Holy shit this place is hilarious. The food is overpriced, the portions are tiny, and the taste is too salty. The only upside is that the food came out pretty fast but only 3 parties were here. Don't come here"}
{"text":"Horrible, horrible breakfast experience here....please do yourself a favor and go somewhere else. 

Family friend took us here for breakfast and we ordered soy milk, salty bean curd, fried bread stick, sticky rice rolls, egg pancakes, congee, etc etc. The salty bean curd was supposed to be good, but was horrible (lukewarm and tasteless). The egg pancakes were wayyyy too greasy. Fried dough/break stick, sticky rice rolls and soybean milk were alright. 

Service was extremely slow. They definitely need more helps/servers. Nobody was cleaning the tables after customers left and they keep new comers waiting just cuz nobody was doing the cleanups. Also, it took them forever to come by to take orders and had to wait another day for us to actually get the food."}
{"text":"Not sure why there's a two star average, because this place is great. I've only been here for the Chinese breakfast.  Soy bean drink/soups are really good, especially the soy sauce one.  spicy pickled cucumbers, scallion pancake, and Yu Toai (fried bread) also very good.  Yes the place needs an update but the food is excellent."}
{"text":"The service is slow even when the restaurant is near empty.   The war wonton soup was done perfectly.  Shrimp and vegetables are well cooked and of good quality.   The red bean Bao is standard.   My Szechuan whole fish was not spicy enough.   The white rice was fluffy and served hot.  Chinese broccoli in Hunan sauce was perfectly cooked.  The spicy noodles were not spicy.  

The food was better than the service.   I would go back but make sure to go during an off-time."}
{"text":"The food was okay, and I ate until I was full - but I was also reallllyy hungry when we got here. The three cup chicken was about as far from the real thing as possible - strips of chicken and super sweet sauce. Soup dumplings didn't have much soup in them and the meat was a little dry. Best dish we had was the spicy boiled fish, which I'd never had before, but am now a huge fan of! Filled with chunks of fish, but I would've liked it to be spicier.

We ordered a total of I think 5 dishes and the bill came out to more than $100. What a rip! Overpriced for mediocre food that even raised the bf's mom's blood sugar level through the roof!"}
{"text":"This is a GREAT Place, and always PACKED with Asians, Believe me
if a place is crappy in Chinatown, it would not be that busy
I have been there a dozen times, and ALWAYS had a great meal."}
{"text":"Very good taste, and clean environment. 
Authentic Chinese food. 
I like it, will revisit for sure."}
{"text":"They have great Chinese breakfast. I felt like I could skip everything else. Their decor is very old school Chinese. The owner is trying to sell the place, and the servers are constantly in the weeds and look annoyed when anybody asks for anything extra. Their food is hit or miss. I had the fu qi fei pian xiao bing, and only the outside was truly edible. The soybean milk was good. The cruller was slightly going stale, but still \"okay\" enough to eat with the soybean milk or their complimentary rice porridge or jook. Their dumplings are store bought, their xiao long bao was okay. Their noodles were okay. It took quite a while to order and quite a while to check out.

I would definitely go back for Chinese breakfast when craving, but everything else I have had better."}
{"text":"We arrived at the restaurant during early evening on a Thursday.  There were only two other customers at the time sitting at a corner table.  The female at that table was having an extrememly loud cell phone conversation that we were not interested in. We stood at the entrance for a minute. No one greeted us.  Two Asian males were just sitting at the bar chatting, not paying attention to us.  One had an apron on with the nametag \"BAI\".  The other one just read a newspaper at the bar.  So I began to walk over and get a menu from the shelf at the rear of the the two males.  

I was interested in some spicy Szechuan cuisine. The other two in my party wanted something not so spicy.  The female in our group asked if everything was spicy.  Bai finally interupted us and stated with a sarcastic glare, \"the one with the chili (icon) is hot!\"

We agreed to eat here and told Bai that there were three of us dining.  Bai immediately attempted to sit us at a small table adjacent to the the loud lady on the cell phone.  I gestured to the larger table and Bai asked,\" how many?\"  We said, \"Three\".  Bai gestured us away from the larger round table, towards the smaller table adjacent to the loud female on the cell phone again.  Bai stated,\"you have three, three sit here!\"

There were maybe 30-40 EMPTY tables in the entire restaurant and he refused to have us sit anywhere but near the loud lady.  We finally told him that we would like the larger table to make room for the many dishes we were going to try.

Bai became disgruntled and we sat at the larger table.  As we were looking at the menu items, I noticed that Bai had walked towards the bar and muttered something to his Asian friend
 reading the newspaper.  Bai then turned around and glared at us.

I finally had had it and decided that a sour attitude would probably be present during the entire meal.  I wish I had read the YELPS on this restaurant prior to considering it.

I stood up and stated to my friends that it would be of best interest if we departed now since we felt uncomfortable by the ungracious staff.

I should have also noticed that no one was breaking the door down attempting to dine in this awful place.

All three of us are Asian, so I don't think there was any unpleasantries due to race.

We ended up next door at the Capitol Seafood Restaurant where we were pleasantly greeted and respected during the entire meal.  We were even given free desserts, which no one else received that we noticed.

We should have waved a $100 bill at Bai as we passed leaving the area, because that is what he lost his restaurant that evening, not to mention this AWESOME review."}
{"text":"Don't go here again!!!
This is a note to remind myself not to go back to this restaurant.
Don't be tempted by the lure of Sao Bings or other Taiwanese Breakfast foods. 
The ?? you tiao inside my ? ? fan tuan was so stale or tough that it hurt my teeth. 
I asked if they would still have Sao Bings if I came back at 1:30pm, just before they end breakfast. I was assured that they would have everything available until 2pm when they stop serving breakfast. I hoped rather than believed it would be true. I went back at 1:30 to get Sao Bings for my husband. They told me that they couldn't put an egg inside. That the Sao Bings came plain. That I would need to order the \"egg taco\" and put it inside. Since my husband said a Dan Bing was ok, I ordered it.
When they brought me my wrapped up to go bag, they said that they were sorry but they were out of Sao Bings, but had put in extra you tiaos in my order. I reminded the lady that I had been in earlier, and asked if they would still have Sao Bings at 2pm. She said they can run out of things. (Duh)
The next step was my fault. I should have checked my FOOD thoroughly before paying my bill. I should have checked my BILL thoroughly before paying my bill. I did neither. I accepted the wrapped up to-go bag, paid my bill, and left. 
When I got to the car, I opened the bag and found 4 you tiaos that were so stale and hard that when I squeezed them in my hand they didn't give or break. It was like they had been microwaved 2 or 3 times and left to sit for hours in-between. I couldn't give them to my husband. I was embarrassed to admit that I had ended up paying for them even though I didn't order them at all. (I knew better from earlier) I threw them away at a gas station before I picked up my husband.
When I checked on what I thought would be a Dan Bing, I realized that \"egg taco\" was too generous of a description. It was some eggs cooked onto a tortilla. No green onions, no sit sauce, no garlic chili paste. My husband makes WAY better food than that at home!!! I ended up just throwing that away too. 

So basically, I ended up spending $15 at the restaurant that day for some sweetened rice. 
Don't go back! If You Mei Champion Taiwan Deli is closed again, just head over to Denny's and have some pancakes. It'll be a better experience!"}

{"text":"On our last visit to Vegas, we craved Chinese food and went to their Chinatown hoping to enjoy some authentic Sino cuisine.  We had eaten here before and didn't have any negative thoughts that prevented us from trying it again.

We entered the restaurant at lunch time and the place was mobbed. They had three waiters running to and fro taking orders and delivering food to tables.  It was extended period of time before they came to our table to give us the menus and finally take our order.  We had to ask for water three times.  It seemed like an endless amount of time before our food arrived.  The wine chicken was dry.  The Kung Pao chicken looked and tasted like it was reheated.  I ordered the lunch special and it was supposed to come with soup.  However, it never came and based upon the quality of food here that was just as well.  The special did not include rice so it we had to pay for it. My wife asked several times for the check (in Chinese) and they took their time bringing it.  By the time we finished, I just wanted to leave this place never to return.

All-in-all, the Emperors Garden is full of weeds.   As they would say in Chinese, this place is Boo Hao (bad!)"}
{"text":"Very disappointed about this place!
The place was dirty!
Horrible service and automatic 20% service charge for the brunch. I have 10 family member came with me and I am find to be charged the service fee if the service is good. However, the waiters did not give the good service. We ordered the wonton which tasted like long time ago, and we complained to the waiter. The waiter gave the respond was: the chef said the wonton it must find, and we made two days ago. The they didn't do anything else and even did not ask the chef to try the bad wonton! Moreover, the food were very oiled! The little pork bun was very dry and had bone inside! 
When we were finished, we had waited a long time for the bill came! I was very shock my bill was over $200 which it just a brunch! 
I won't recommend to my friend to this place!"}
{"text":"*Review is strictly for the Taiwanese style breakfast*

Do you know what's worse than losing money in Vegas? The answer is coming here for Taiwanese style breakfast  ...

I don't even know why I came here in the first place, but our group saw the word \"Yong He Soybean Milk\" (????) and the rest is history. \"Yong He Soybean Milk\" symbolizes a famous Taiwanese breakfast restaurant and everyone nowadays just abuses the name. Breakfast is available from 8 AM to 2 PM.

There was only one server at 8 AM and he doesn't seem to speak English, but at least he speaks fluent Mandarin (errr ....... yay)! 

Soy Sauce Flavored Soybean Drink (\"Salty\" Soy Milk, $3.25): \"Salty\" soy milk is one of those Taiwanese breakfast item not everyone would love. It contained vinegar, Chinese oil stick (youtiao), sesame oil, and some green onion. Emperor's Garden version of \"salty\" soy milk was a bit disappointing. (2/5)

Shrimp & Chicken Wan Ton Soup ($9.95) - Wow ... $10 wonton soup. I would THINK all food items here would be pretty cheap because we are in the middle of Chinatown. Tasted really whatever and $10 price tag didn't help. (2/5)

Chinese Style Egg Taco (Taiwanese egg pancake, $4.5): One of the most tasteless Taiwanese egg pancake I've had ever. (1/5)

Expensive food, below average taste, somewhat dirty restroom, and pedestrian service. I mean ... talk about ONE (like one-star) amazing experience that I probably want to forget.

P.S. - Emperor's Garden serves Sichuan style cuisines for lunch and dinner."}
{"text":"OMG! A big mistake to go there! 

I would say that the food was Okay, but the service sucks! It was really a chaos when we were there. All the waiters seemed unhappy and not willing to help guests. The elder female, owner-like lady, kept yelling at all the employees, trying to get things done in a good manner. However, this seemed helpless and everything was still in a big mess. We ate up all the dishes and soups but the Twisted Cruller never came up, which was our main target of the visit. Will never visit again!"}
{"text":"EDC weekend, wanted some Xiao long bao's and we yelped this place. Worse XLBs I have ever heard, meat was bland, wrapping was mooshy and each one popped its soupy goodness before it even got to our plate or in our mouths. Also ordered some other dishes, but they were all terrible except for soy milk. Place smelled sour inside, restaurant was dingy. I can't believe anyone would eat here. Worse experience in a long long time."}
{"text":"We came in for a weekend brunch and were really disappointed. We came in for the soy milk (????) but also ordered some other traditional breakfast items. We got green onion pancakes (???), potstickers (??), egg crepe (??), and a rice burrito-like thing (??). I love all of these items usually, and they're all pretty standard Chinese dishes so you'd expect most places to get them right. However, this place produced the most flavorless food I've probably ever had. Everything they served seemed to be missing salt and was covered in oil.

Maybe they avoid putting in too much salt to allow for customers to adjust according to their own tastes. However, with the food they served, no amount of soy sauce could save it because deep down, the food is flavorless.

The worst part about this place, though, was the service. When we came in, there were about 4 tables full of dirty dishes. The waiter hastily pointed to a table without silverware or plates and told us to sit. We were later given some plates and a menu and ordered. The food actually came out pretty quickly, but it was served by some guy with the worst attitude I've seen in a waiter. He dropped the food in the table (spilling a lot of the soy milk) and failed to tell us what any of the dishes were (we knew what they were, but not every customer would). I also saw the same waiter blow off a customer and tell him to \"ask someone else\" when he was asked a question.

When we finished, we were waiting for someone to bring the check, but it never came so we just went up to the cash register. Like some people have mentioned, a 15% tip was included, but definitely not deserved. Chinese brunch with my family is usually my favorite time, but they somehow managed to screw up the food and the experience."}
{"text":"The dishware is dirty. I can see leftover soy sauce on my spoon. Cup are also leftover tea marks."}
{"text":"I wish I can give no star. The service was really really bad!!! The waitresses never come to take order and refill water. Food taste was just acceptable. Plus only 2 of us dine-in and ordered 6 dishes, they automatically charged the gratuity without my permission. I will never come back to this restaurant."}
{"text":"If there was a negative rating, this place would deserve it!

It was advertised as a Dim Sum place and when my family and I visited the place there were no carts going around, like a normal dim sum, and the menu was very limited!

Hard enought that we did not speak the language, and the server spoke little english.  We pretty much had to point at what everyone else is ordering and there were only a few customers at the place.

When we got the food, it lacked meat in the Char Siu Bau and the Shaomai was salty, plus no Sesame Ball!  The order was incomplete and the place did not have regular ICE TEA!  They only served Brisk Ice Tea in a can.

The only restaurant that will make you feel hungry when you walk out!

My departing comment is \" You should never go in when you see a restaurant with few patrons\"."}
{"text":"Do not go to this place if you are looking for a good Chinese food. They don't know what they are doing. 
Here is why:
1. Bad service. They spilled tea on my moms clothes and didn't say anything. The empty tea pot was never filled. So we asked them to fill it up. They forgot and had to ask them again. 
2. Food is not Sichuan food. We ordered chongqing fried spicy chicken and it was not spicy and didn't have any Sichuan peppercorn. It was like a joke. I can make it better. 
3. As other yelp reviews mentioned, 15% tip is already included so make sure you check the bill. 

Again, if you know Chinese food, you will find this place very disappointing. If you can't distinguish Sichuan, shanghainese, Cantonese and other Chinese cuisines, this place might be ok (food-wise)."}
{"text":"This place is getting worse every time I come here. They now started adding in gratuity even though there is a party of 2. They add it too even if your order is take out. Total fucking bullshit. 

The service is horrible. The girl working there looks like a fucking bitch who doesn't seem to want to be there so I wasn't happy that I had to pay a higher gratuity then what I would have given.

Be warned!

Update: My mom called later to complain (same lady that took care of us and added in the gratuity)....and the lady said, next time let me know that you are local and I will not add in gratuity...uhhh what?!? I didn't realize tipping was \"required\" now. You should be lucky if you get tipped for such horrible attitude/service!"}
{"text":"I haven't reviewed in forever. And this is not an angry \"I hate this restaurant.\" But truly, you should pass on this restaurant. After much contemplation (initially wanted the Shanghai soup dumpling but saw the next table literally left it untouched), we ordered the Dry Noodle with Chef's Special Sauce. Let's just say I should have busted out Top Ramen and it would have been ten times more satisfying but then again 0x10 would still be 0 so I'm actually doing a disservice to Top Ramen. The dish consisted of thick ramen, carrot strips, and mushroom, and a boiled egg. The sauce? Plain water with a bit of soy sauce for color and not for taste. I didn't know the chef's name was Kikkoman. When I told the waitress it was tasteless and asked if I could substitute out, she took the bowl back and added black vinegar. My pet peeve is having a disappointing meal. Anyway, should have read Yelp before stepping in. Hope you don't make my mistake."}
{"text":"Very nice restaurant with free wifi. They are fast. The food is also delicious. Don't believe the rating."}
{"text":"so overpriced! it cost us 50 for bruch (4 people) and we nearly order anything. the waiter complains that we order so little. RU kidding me? never go there again."}
{"text":"Had been here before and the food was always fairly good and quick.  Ordered the Crispy Beef, which was listed under the house specials for $12.75 (specifically pointed to the item on the menu).

It was okay, but when the bill came it was changed to Tangerine Beef at $16.95.  Was also charged $2 for white rice for the two of us; without being asked if we wanted rice or being informed there was a charge.  When did Chinese restaurants start charging for white rice?  I've seen this in Indian restaurants, but they usually tell you there is a charge.

Did not have time to argue about the overcharge on the beef due to having tickets to a play.  

Won't be back."}
{"text":"Three main points: horrible service, terrible food, overly expensive menu with extremely small portions.

Conclusion: a total failure. 

What else? Uncut vegetables, leftover ingredients and what looks like expired sauce are all cooked together in your meal. Every single dish looks the same and have the exact same taste. Imagine eating fish, beef and/or tofu but they all have the same texture and same flavor (not to mention the same leftover ingredients again.)

Last verdict: do not attempt to go unless you want to leave Vegas in disappointment. 

I'm very sad. Waste of money with garbage in my stomach :(

Yelp, can I give them 0 stars?"}
{"text":"Came to this area to try Noodle Pot, found the place packed with no place to sit, so we walked around to try another restraurant in this shopping center.  Walked in to find only one other couple in this large restaurant.  First cue.... We sat down to dirty dishes and cups, I grabbed clean (i hope) dishes from another table.  Server asked my husband what he wanted to drink, then turned his back on me and walked away... Ok.... saved me 1.75 for a can of Diet Coke, I will just share his.....  Ordered Lunch special, came with egg drop soup, weird gelatinous consistency, and needed seasoning... Chicken with garlic sauce came out, not too bad, best part of meal.  Husbands noodle bowl came out, broth was tasteless which makes rest of ingredients very bland.   So many better places to try... Wont come back"}
{"text":"I don't think food is that bad.
Just a bit greasy and salty.
It is pricey though.
The waitress was very nice and friendly.
They open until very late so if you are hungry around 10pm.. this will probably the only place you can eat!"}
{"text":"This place was very disappointing. The food was not fresh, the price was expensive, and the quality was not great. We came here because of its well known brand, but the food fell below expectations."}
{"text":"Not bad, I enjoyed my beef noodle stew, but there were only 2 pieces of beef. Good lunch prices, but I wouldn't come back just to eat here. At least they were friendly"}
{"text":"The only good thing here is the hot soy milk. But the soy milk was room temp today. Service wasn't so great. Waitress sorta kept ignoring us. The plates and utensils were dirty. Again, try to come here for breakfast only for the soy milk."}
{"text":"We went this place because it's advertisement for sezchuan dish on the chinese newspaper. However  I have to say it's some of worst food I had, plus the place is really empty even during prime dinner time. I guess that's the first sign of trouble. If you're going please only order sezchuan dish they are edible but by all mean STAY AWAY from SEAFOOD, they're not fresh and stale."}
{"text":"Why they wrote the tips for me and then asked me to sign it?? The taste was just ok but I will never recommend this place."}
{"text":"First of all the portion of the food definitely does not equals to the price they charged, food was okay, don't expect the service is any better, you serve yourself, at the end there is a 15% mandatory tips."}
{"text":"This restaurant serves Szechwan and Mandarin cuisine.  We each started off with a cup of corn and chicken soup that turned out to be egg drop soup with a few kernels of corn tossed in for good measure.  We shared entrees of shrimp lo mein and spicy chicken with peppers.  Neither dish scaled any culinary heights, but at least I was able to use a 20% off coupon printed off the LVRJ website to ease my disappointmen"}
{"text":"Great place.  The service was fast and the food was fabulous. 

It had the BEST Kung pao chicken. And the orange crispy chicken had so much flavor. 

I got a good family vibe here for sure. 

Some suggestions would be to attend to our water faster and it was a little run down. With a little cleaning and a fresh coat of paint it would be great!"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times. Last time we went though, the \"spicy\" dishes weren't very spicy at all... This normally doesn't happen to us at Asian restaurants, especially since I don't order in English. The food tasted decent, and the cut of beef for our beef dishes wasn't fatty and gross like at some places. It's not terrible like a lot of people on here seem to think, but at the same time, there's many better Chinese places in San Fran and Seattle than here."}
{"text":"Standard fare Chinese. Got Kung pao chicken. It wasn't bad. They were able to follow instructions and hold the onions but apparently this place isn't much for service not to mention niceties. Like, water. Which I didn't get any of ;) The egg drop soup included w lunch is huge but wasn't anything special flavor wise. 

I'm sure there are other better experiences out there for Chinese. Hole in the wall or not."}
{"text":"My family and I ate at Emperor's Garden on Christmas. Due to the holiday, there were more people there than usual. Because of that, we only got a limited menu that was only in Chinese. Since my siblings and I can't read too much Chinese, we asked for English menus, but they refused to give them to us and just told our parents to help us order.

The plates and cups they brought out were visibly dirty. I don't even know how a cup that would only be used for tea could get so dirty. There was also still a significant amount of dishwater left in my cup when I got it. Busy or not, there is no excuse to have dishes brought out like that.

When we got our food, it wasn't horrible but it definitely could have been a lot better. My brother and dad both ordered noodle soups and while eating they both found pieces of string in their soup (probably used to tie the noodles together prior to cooking). We complained to the manager, but she just kept using the excuse that they were busy. Speaking of the manager, she was just yelling orders all over the place, across the whole restaurant. It was very annoying and ruined the atmosphere.

My parents also kept asking for soup spoons. They asked 3 or 4 times, but we never ended up getting them.

Maybe we had this experience just because we went on Christmas, but it was definitely not a good one."}
{"text":"Went there on a holiday for brunch and ordered sticky rice roll, red bean buns, soy bean drinks, bean noodle from the bilingual slip of paper.  Decent food, fast free hot tea refills, easy parking, and good price.  I would go back."}
{"text":"We came here for breakfast as hubby wanted salty soy ($1.95). Lil guy wanted cong you bing ($2.95). We also ordered a dish called husband and wife beef slices ($5.95) which is deceiving since it's beef and tendon slices in a spicy sauce and not just beef on its own. Well the flavor of this dish was ok but not spicy enough and not nearly enough of the Sichuan peppercorns. Salty soy wasn't bad but not not as flavorful as it could've been. But the worse part of all was the cong you bing. OMG it was SO greasy and just disgusting. The service was also awful. The servers' lack of enthusiasm just made me want to get out of there ASAP."}
{"text":"Unfortunately the service here has dropped off in the past few years. Every family trip (about once annually now) we would come down to Chinatown to grab some good eats. In the past this restaurant was bustling full of people, service was quick, and portion/food was great.

Seems the prices haven't changed too much but the food quality, portions, and slow service (with noone else in the restaurant) have dropped off. Some of the plates were okay, but most were bland, over-salted, or had enough oil to make a soup out of."}
{"text":"Grateful for the fresh soy milk offered here. Hubby and I tried both the hot and iced, can't vouch for the Yong He authenticity but nonetheless they were good drinks, helped us wash down the Sticky Rice Balls. Another good find of mine that day was the deep fried mantou with a side of sweetened condensed milk for dipping. God knows how much I crave these little things!

We only had breakfast here so can't say much about lunch or dinner foods. The service seems a little better than the Cantonese style restaurants'. I'd come again!"}
{"text":"Honestly, this restaurant is just a piece of shit, I would rather choose McDonald's rather than this one,the first restaurant that chose tips it wanted,feel so bad,food is expensive and terrible."}
{"text":"???????????????????????????????????? ?????????????????SB???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????15%????????????"}
{"text":"Was not happy with this place at all. Took my nephews, who are locals, for lunch here, and was sorely disappointed. I order the shrimp with sizzling rice, and got a very mediocre and slightly slimy concoction, but it did sizzle. 
We ordered a pu pu platter, and it gets very mixed reviews. the beef sticks were good, the fried wonton tastless, and the ribs looks so dehydrated, we didn't even try them. 
The sevice was worse than the food. First, they do not include steamed rice with their entrees, so we ordered 2, which never came even after we reminded the waiter we ordered them, but of course were included on the bill. 
They basically dumped our food on the table and then ignored us. We even had to literally get up and get our waiter for a bill when we were done after waiting 20 minutes to see if he would come around on his own. This place wasn't busy, only 2 other tables with diners at them. there was no reason for the bad sevice except the waiter was more interested in his cell phone then serving his customers. 
There are lots of other places in Chinatown, give this one a pass."}
{"text":"Maybe I was in a bad mood this morning. I have eaten at Emperor's Garden for Chinese breakfast probably 3 previous times, and I've never left thinking: \"Well, that's it. I'm not coming back.\" Quite the contrary, I have obviously returned! So, maybe they deserve 2.5 stars, but this morning was a little saddening.

We ordered their soup dumplings, which definitely look homemade, but they were lacking soup. The scallion pancake did not have light, flaky layers; instead, it was dense. I opted for the last soupless dumpling over the last pancake triangle. The salty rice roll with the dried beef inside did not seem fresh, and neither did the you tiao. The you tiao was tough, like it had been fried earlier and then reheated. I left feeling icky, and not even a blissful icky like you experience after a glazed doughnut.   

Sigh. The place is always pretty busy with a breakfast crowd, but I think it is a matter of limited supply."}
{"text":"This place is so bad.... 

Hot tea tastes like colored water. Probably watered down 10x before i got it. 

Only got xiao long bao and boy does it sucks. Looks like xiao long bao but tastes like a steamed pork dumpling. There are no juices to it. The ones i but frozen at the market has more juice than this"}
{"text":"Ordered over 10 items on both the breakfast menu and the Szechuan menu. First of all, their steam buns were ready-made and re-steamed when we ordered, so taste like shui Mai.... Omg and everything comes afterwards are either too salty or tasteless.

OMG this is one of the worst Chinese food I've ever has in my life."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch on a Tuesday and ordered off their lunch special. 
1. Broccoli beef, 7.95
- soup
- egg roll
2. Lunch rice, 50c
for $10.13

- 2nd floor. Seated and ordered quickly. Received food less than 10 min. 
- I was surprised that I had to pay for lunch rice! haha. Felt like some kind of hidden fee. Maybe bc I can't read Chinese? I assumed that a lunch special was going to be all on one plate. My mistake. They did give me way too much rice for one person. This should have been shared. 
- Broccoli beef was fresh and tasted good. 
- My soup had a huge serving spoon in it!!! xD! My spoon is tooooo big. lol 
- good soup. average egg roll. 
- I thought I was going to get tea, but they gave me water instead. I actually had to ask if I can get a drink. fail. 
- Come for lunch for more than one. Not just one."}
{"text":"Can't believe their foods could be this disgusting. Wonton taste like rot dumpling?their wonton don't even use wonton paper), soup is salty to hell, the soy milk got no taste at all but sugar. ???? is one of the well-known Taiwanese breakfast, and this rubbish place literally ruined it....."}
{"text":"I would consider my family and I really good critics of chinese food as we have been all over the country trying chinese restaurants.  This week we were looking for a chinese restaurant in the Las Vegas Chinatown area and found this place.  We should have been wise and not bothered when we only saw a few people in the restaurant for dinner.

There seem to be only a chinese lady(I think the owners wife) working all aspects of the restaurant.  She was taking orders, getting drinks, cleaning table, etc.  She was all over the place which had us waiting.  Needless to say the serve was extremely poor.  The food we ordered was even worst.  No flavor, no taste.  One of our crispy fish dishes was not crispy and was very soft.  We told her the problem but she didn't care.  Please save your money and go somewhere else.  Panda express is way better than this place. By the way, the owner was having dinner and never bothered to help her, even when more people arrived.  Stay far away from this restaurant."}
{"text":"The CHINESE Broccoli... Divine 

The shrimp fried rice. Stale and not fried, more like tossed over a dead flame.
The only thing in this concoction fried were the scrambled eggs. even the shrimp were tired and limp.

And the prices are NOT worth coming back or ever letting the emperor know you were in his presence.

DEFINITELY AVOID at All costs. LITERALLY"}
{"text":"We decided to grab some Taiwanese breakfast on our last morning in Las Vegas.  Now that Vegas has a large Chinatown, I wish we tried someplace else.

There's a lot of variety on the menu, and we ordered a lot:.  We had xiao long bao, soy milk, egg pancakes, onion pancakes, and noodles.  Everything came out cold and was very doughy.  

Service was almost nonexistent as the servers seemed more interested in talking to each other."}
{"text":"I came here for Taiwanese style breakfast and I thought everything was good. 

The space is on the second floor of the strip mall in Chinatown. The ambiance is your typical Chinese place. Not dirty, not immaculate, Asian style decor, well lit, small and large tables. 

We ordered the fried dough with soy milk for dipping, the roasted peanuts and anchovies which normally goes with congee but we ate it straight as a snack, the rice ball, egg crepe and soup dumplings. The soup dumplings were average but the other items were good and satisfied my craving. 

True, their tabletop chili oil is not as hot but I've been told that's the Taiwanese style and I believe there is beauty in every hot sauce. 

The service was lacking but not horrible. They only had two servers staffed so they did what they could and at least brought the food out promptly. You don't go to Asian restaurants for their smiling service. It's efficient and to the point."}
{"text":"The Dan Dan noodles were AWESOME!! We are glad we chose this place prior to looking at Yelp reviews. I am a Dan Dan noodle fan, and I rate this location as my favorite place to get them now."}
{"text":"Completely waste of money. Everything taste bad. the food was not fresh. Waiters are really rude. The plates are dirty. The food are overprice comparing to other Chinese restaurants. I was wondering how can they still open with that quality of food and service. However, It was a life time experience to dine at Emperor Garden . I would recommend everyone to try the worst Chinese food in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Our friends ordered for us before we arrived, so I don't know the names of all the dishes.  We came here for the szechuan food, and for that, it simply was not spicy enough.  Likely,they altered the flavors for the western palette, which is disappointing.  We got the usual fish in chili broth.  Lots of veggies.  If you don't like oil, then this is not for you...actually, a lot of chinese foods would not be agreeable:)  Then there was the dan dan mien.  4/10...not a single note of spiciness.  Other dishes- 

fresh cucumber in chili sauce- went well with the meat dishes, but nothing special
a lamb with bell pepper dish- 8/10.  Wish I knew what it was called.
chicken with bell pepper dish- good texture for the chicken.  5/10

Service was quick.  Probably won't be coming back though, since there are other great restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"My GF is looking for a real old school Chinese restaurant that serves Family Style. This place was recommended to me and I made reservations for Mothers day before reading the Yelp reviews.

Im glad I did it that way as we would have missed out on a wonderful dining experience. 

The three of us ordered appetizers and four meals and shared everything. It all tasted perfect and even a dish I know I didnt like (at other stores) turned out to be delicious here. Made me wonder if a mild narcotic had been added to it.

There was two other tables and a party in the banquet room but our drinks were always full and the waiter seeing I was having problems eating noodles with my chop sticks brought us all forks and didn't embarrass me like Ive seen other servers do. 

It was a wonderful and authentic family style experience but my GF said it wasnt like how she remembered it as a child. If you know of another place in Vegas that does old school family style Chinese food and even includes the MSG; drop me a message Id love to hear about it and put a smile on her face."}
{"text":"Crappy food, waiters rush everything everyone. And they add tips in your bill regardless how you like the service. The worst part is they use ????brand to fool the unknowings. Stay away"}
{"text":"I see a lot of negative reviews here, but my experience today couldn't have been more opposite of the reviews I read.  Very friendly service...felt welcome and right at home.  Amazing food!  Highly recommend the Dan Dan Noodles and Orange Chicken.  Will definitely be back to try other things on the menu.  Great value!"}
