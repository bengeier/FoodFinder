{"text":"What a perfect addition to Weston Road! From the moment you walk in you feel that this should be a place you would find in a nicer, pricier Vaughan/Woodbridge area, it's a pleasant surprise. The menu selection for Panini's and crepes are excellent and they make original and inspired food without over complicating the menu or ingredients. I had a super tasty authentic Greek salad with added chicken and the portion was very generous. The bakery items look delicious and fresh, their chocolate croissant was amazing and I was tempted to go for more but I was being a good boy that day...next time!"}
{"text":"I like this cafe and I think it is a welcome addition to a wonderful neighborhood that is slowly making a comeback. Weston has had its ups and downs, but I think it's headed upwards for good now. I live south of the Village of Weston but I'm happy to see businesses like this investing here. Thanks for being a good neighbor."}
{"text":"Their strength is in their baked goods which they make fresh in house in a limited quantity every day. Each day there's a new selection but you need to go early because they will run out of certain items. Nice decor and sweet staff. A bit of a wait if you're ordering a sandwich since they make it to order.   Tried a number of things: -Cheddar Cheese & Herb bagel -the middle tastes like regular bread, it doesn't have that satisfying chew that bagels are suppose to have. Tasted better toasted. - Southwestern panini (Chicken, Bacon, Tomato, Spinach & Chipotle Sauce) is their most popular panini. Loved the crusty bread. Good ratio of filling to bread, tasty. - Iced mocha had a peculiar taste to it and I wondered if it was from the plastic cup it came in BLEH! - Caramel Macchiato was pretty decent. Didn't need to add additional sugar or cream. - Minestrone soup was chunky and filled with beans, pasta and tomatoes. It tasted ok.  - Greek salad doesn't come with lettuce so I added it for $1 extra. Small portion, tasted alright but was drowned in dressing. -Lemon blueberry tart paired well with my Caramel Macchiato. The crust was crumbly and delicious and the filling tart. -Chocolate chunk cookie was my favorite: packed with decadent chocolate chunks, a crisp edge and a satisfying chew to it.  Would definitely come back for their hot drinks, affordable sandwich specials and delicious baked goods."}
{"text":"Got the coconut cream tart, so delicious!! Perfect not too sweet. Soft crust. Good coffee.  ham & cheese sandwich was very good."}
{"text":"We don't have a Starbucks anywhere in Weston, alas. The nearest Starbucks is at Royal York and Eglinton where a local Blockbuster outlet breathed its last before they all went bankrupt. But until we get a Starbucks on Weston Rd, Jane St. or Keele St. (or anywhere in poor neglected Downsview) this Perfect Blend Cafe is the nearest thing we have to a Starbucks. Good coffee and tea? Check! Nice fresh pastries and sandwiches? Check! Nice chairs & tables & ambience? Check! CrÃªpes and gelato? Bonus! Weston Road finally gets a touch of badly needed class! May it last! Gentrification can't come soon enough around here!"}
{"text":"I live close by and have been here a few times. The food is incredible, the bagels are the best I've ever had. The staff are really nice and friendly. Sometimes if I go later in the day they've run out of a lot so make sure you go early!"}
{"text":"Don't let the location and neighbourhood fool you, this bakery is quite the hidden gem. Family owned and operated, this small business brings a much needed personal touch to the area. I had the Southwest Chicken Sandwich which surprised me with how tasty it was considering its otherwise unassuming appearance. To drink I followed a recommendation and had a milk hot chocolate.  It was the right amount of rich chocolate taste without any hint of being watery (unlike certain other coffee chains)."}
