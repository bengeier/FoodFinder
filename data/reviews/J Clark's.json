{"text":"Great place to eat. Ate lunch there earlier this week. The waitress was friendly and the food came out really quick. Have ate there a few times. Would go back again. They have a great wing night special too on Mondays."}
{"text":"It has been several years since I visited this restaurant.  Due to previous experiences, it has not been on my list of places to visit again. We decided to give it a try last night and were extremely happy.  There were six of us, and our demands were not simple.  We had two children with us, and they were very happy with their meals (mac and cheese and a grilled cheese).  My son even wanted a second grilled cheese and it was done in minutes.

Three of us had pasta dishes, the portions were generous and we had enough to take  home for lunch the next day.  I had the Eggplant Rotollo which was lightly breaded with a pink sauce served over penne.  I thought it was excellent! 

If you are taking more than 4 or 5 people, it's probably best to call ahead of time, as they will save tables for you.  We were fortunate that it wasn't too busy and we were able to be seated right away.

Our waitress, Jamie, was amazing and she didn't skip a beat.  If you are looking for fine dining, this isn't it.  The bar/lounge is very large and you walk into it as soon as you walk into the Restaurant, but there is no smoking so it wasn't a problem for us.  We will definitely be visiting again, as this experience was really good."}
{"text":"Went here tonight with my wife as we had a coupon from Restaurant.com.  I have driven by it many times, thought it was just a sports bar and was pleasantly surprised that they do in fact have a nice dining area.  Started out good - seated very fast, waitress came for our drink orders almost immediately and was very nice, even giving suggestions and answering any question we had about the menu.  After taking our order, however, the entire experience changed.  First off, I ordered a bowl of soup and my wife ordered a cup, and the waitress brought us both what we assumed to be a cup (as it was the size of a cup of soup at any other restaurant).  We got the bill and found we were both charged for a bowl.  Aside from that, our waitress hardly came to check on use, and if she said anything to us it was very short and usually as she was walking away from our table.  

The prices weren't horrible, and the food was alright, but I highly doubt that we will be returning to this restaurant."}
{"text":"My daughter wanted to order salmon but it said it had old bay seasoning.  So she ordered the broiled cod.  No mention of old bay.  Came covered in old bay.  She is 10.  She tried scraping the seasoning off.  Ordered smothered chicken without onions for myself..  First came with onions.  When the waitress brought it back it was minus the onions and minus the taste.  Chicken was tough as nails and could barely cut it with the butter knife I was given.  My baked potato was hard as a rock.  I asked for  fries and told her about the bad chicken and my daughter's fish.  She did bring me fries, took my meal off the bill and got my daughter a new piece of fish minus any seasoning at all.  Kuddo's to a great waitress but I won't go back and I used to eat there all the time with  my family.  Was a disappointing meal  to say the least."}
{"text":"I have to say that I've now become a fan of this place.  The food is so greatly improved I literally cannot remember the last time I had a bad meal here.  The servers are all friendly and efficient, too.
Best French Onion soup around, and they have a Philly-Style burger that is great, too.
Or try the Gyro.  You won't be disappointed.
Kudos to J Clark's."}
{"text":"This place is my ABSOLUTE favorite! The owner is so friendly and accommodating and the bartenders have the best personalities. The FOOD is the best in the area- personal favorites- Monday- wings! Salmon on a bed of spinach and Tuesday for Karaoke is the most fun I've ever had in the North Hills.  whole heartedly recommend."}
{"text":"I've been going to this place for years. It does have some issues but it is cheap and they are good at \"All American\" food.

The Good:
- They have really good appetizers and a nice selection. I recommend the pretzel and the wings. When they make wings right, they are second to none.
- Their burgers are great. They are just traditional burgers and are very soft.
- I've been going there for years and I don't think I ever waited more than 5 minutes.

The Bad:
- This place has had a problem with flies for years. They are everywhere in the summer and it ruins the experience.
- They don't do a good job on their salad's. Make sure you get Heather, as she can make a good one.
- They refuse to put sauce on their wings. 
- They always take forever to run your card and give you your receipt. Not sure what the deal is with that.
- Their seats and booths are all broken in one way or another. When I sit in their booths, my body goes one way and the cushion's go another. The chairs are wobbly too."}
{"text":"My mom always told me. If you have nothing nice to say then you shouldn't say anything at all.. We had dinner here. I got pretzels and beer. The beer wasn't terrible."}
{"text":"I had dinner with an old acquaintance here a few days ago because it's near where he lives and where I work (also, he had a coupon). 

It's a bar/restaurant and thus has the usual bar/restaurant menu and feel to it. The front of the building has the bar, the round tables, a slot machine, and so forth - things that give it a bar feel. The back has a quiet seating area. I actually like that this place offers both seating arrangements, so that was fine by me.

My dinner was just a salmon burger, which tasted ok. It wasn't the best salmon burger ever, but I do give the place credit for bringing me my food not totally assembled; I could choose which toppings I wanted and how much dressing I wanted, which is something every place should do in my opinion.

Also: the fries here are delicious. Really, truly delicious.

But still, this place is a bit out of my way for some good fries. If I need to grab a quick bite with someone after work, maybe - otherwise, I may never eat here again. The food wasn't bad. Just wasn't amazing, either."}
{"text":"If I lived closer, I would be a regular here. It's the perfect dive bar with great specials, strong drinks and good food. Always a lot of locals at the bar but never overcrowded. Bartenders are super nice as well. While we've had some pretty small and over-cooked wings, the majority of the time they are delicious. And it never fails.... the buffalo sauce is always amazing. Great flavor without being too spicy. I love that it's true buffalo sauce and not \"mild, medium, or hot.\" Love!"}
{"text":"I've been to better places and definitely had much better food. A bar trying to do food.
I had a steak, string beans, fries, apple juice. The steak was a good softness, but no flavor at all, usually you salt & pepper the steak before grilling it, the string beans were fresh but under cooked, the fries were crunchy, I wasn't expecting that, but they were some what adequate. My apple juice came warm with no ice. A least I won't die of hunger, but if I had to choose again, oh HELL NO!!!!"}
{"text":"Food was good but wasn't served hot as waitress was too concerned talking to her friends for a long time and ignoring customers"}
{"text":"Stopped here just to check out something new. Waitress was nice but very busy because we inadvertently stopped in during wing night. We ordered wings and tater tots (which seemed like was a local favorite or something). Wings were greasy and sauces were mediocre, buffalo and honey bbq. Tater tots were also greasy and tasted like the oil they were fried in. Btw, was told upon ordering that we had to buy at least one drink if ordering wing special. Atmosphere was small and cozy but just crowded during wing special night. Both our stomachs felt weird after eating (probably from the grease). Maybe other food is better,  might check it out again,  but doubt it."}
{"text":"I have always enjoyed coming to J Clark's over the years. When every other typical chain restaurant is running on an hour wait, you can count on this place to seat you when you walk in. I like that they have the bar and restaurant separate. This way you can enjoy your dinner without bar noise. 

I have tried their buffalo chicken wrap, baked cod dinner and buffalo chicken salad. The buffalo chicken wrap is sub par. They do pack it with a lot of chicken though. The baked cod and buffalo chicken salad are probably my favorite. With the dinner you get two sides and a roll at a reasonable price. The buffalo chicken salad is really big and they are never stingy on the dressing. Win win! I also just found out that they serve breakfast on Saturday's and Sunday's!"}
{"text":"I ate here this past Friday evening with my girlfriend.  Whenever we were seated I looked up and saw many turn of the century pictures of downtown Pittsburgh which I enjoyed.

For dinner I decided on having the eggplant rotollo and chose a side of French onion soup.  The soup was flavorful with the onion and cheese adding to the salty broth.  I was a little disappointed in the lack of croutons though.  Whenever my entree came out I was excited as it looked good.  However I was not a fan of the eggplant as I thought it was a bit greasy.  So I ended up eating the ricotta cheese out of the middle of them before my girlfriend finished the eggplant.  The tomato cream sauce ended up being the best part of my dish as it had a good thickness to it and tasted rich.

The bottom line for me is that I would probably not head back here in the future. Nothing really stood out to me and I was not overly enthralled with my entree."}
{"text":"2.0* Good location, neighborhood bar, but unfortunately poor service and meh food left us hungry and wanting to never come back

Good:  full bar with wide selection of beer and liquor. Good spot to watch Steelers football games. $10 buffet on game days.Food is also reasonably priced.

Not-So-Good:  Food is meh.  I had the Tuscan chicken wrap ($7.99) and my boyfriend had the German stacker ($7.25). We each had a cup of chili - it wasn't anything special and lacked any heat. There was something extremely peppery in the wrap that distracted from everything else. The wrap was served sliced on top of a bed of shaved iceberg lettuce, tomatoes, and black olive slices. The German stacker was a greasy mess. We had to check the menu to verify the kind of meat sitting in between the pretzel bun. Wilted lettuce sat on top of a piece of melted American cheese.

During our visit, we dealt with three employees, including the manager. Each were unique in their own way, lacking service skills. The manager noted that she'd never \"seen anyone order a Smithwick's beer\" before asking us for our identification. Very strange. Servers seemed uninterested and preoccupied. Our chili and entrees were hurriedly placed on the table.

In return for the level of service, we left a 10 percent tip.

We won't be back."}
{"text":"Zero stars
This was the worst dining experience ever. Worn out dirty atmosphere that just begs for help. We ordered nachos for an appetizer and the jalapeno peppers were bad, possibly moldy. I informed our waitress of this and suggested she report this to kitchen. No apology or resolution, item was not removed from bill. Buffalo chicken wrap was just soaked in hot sauce and inedible it was so spicy and overwhelmingly hot, could not eat. Pittsburgher burger was a grease soaked mess. French fries tasted of old burnt grease, it was obvious that fryer oil needed changed a while ago. And to top it off, a nice long black curly hair in the bottom of my wife's salad. We asked for our check with more than half our food still on table. Waitress was not concerned that we were leaving and our meals were unfinished.  I typically don't send food back to kitchen. You have one chance for a first impression with me. I chose to spend my money and time at jclarks and they failed. My first impression is that this place is terrible.  Food is not fresh, it is not prepared properly,  it doesn't seem to be a sanitary atmosphere and I don't think employees give a hoot. I would never go back nor recomend this establishment to anyone. It always amazes me how sub par food and service have become acceptable.  Shame on jclarks. You should and can do better."}
{"text":"Great service from OriAnna. She is always kind, attentive, and friendly. We have been seated with her many times now and will request her upon next time we go back. The food is delicious, my favorite thing to get is the pretzel melt or the gyro. And they have the have the best fries. They have a low key bar atmosphere which is great for after a long day of work. We will definitely be back in the near future."}
{"text":"Consistently neighborhood-dive-bar food. Inexpensive, good wings, GREAT happy hour."}
{"text":"Very accommodating when making tweaks to an item to your satisfaction, at least for me.  I've been there several times & generally ask to have something made slightly different than their usual & they always comply, and I've always been pleased.

Their selection of items is decent; typical American & Italian food.  My dining companion says the hamburgers are very good.  I often get one of the main course salads & have never been dis-satisfied.  

There's a full bar with Happy Hour + in-game specials in the lounge area.  The restaurant is located in the front of a large shopping center on the west side of McKnight Rd, just south of Wexford.  There's also plenty of free  parking."}
{"text":"Hit or miss. We've been here a few times and is either really good or not. Occasionally service is really bad and the employees seem to only cater the the other employees that are around drinking at the bar."}
