{"text":"Food quality is poor, nutritional value is  worse and customer service, non existent.  Frozen dinners at any local supermarket are superior to Freshly.com, and 1/2 the cost!"}
{"text":"I was excited when I saw the meal descriptions online. First disappointment was I had to wait a week for the meal service to get started. Come on. A company should be able to move faster than that. I then loved the meal arrival - simple packaging. Gel cold packs are a bit bulky and wasteful, but the rest is streamlined. My first salmon meal was okay -- because you have to reheat it, the salmon gets overcooked. The peppers meal was also okay but made me question if I would like the rest. Next meal of pecan pork was awful - weird texture to the pork; definitely not high quality meat. Final meal of herb chicken was very good. After the pork I canceled my service. I couldn't tell if it canceled the next week's delivery but assumed it did since not message came up saying it didn't. But they sent another set of meals, saying I had to cancel by 5 pm on Thursday - the day after I received my first shipment on Weds afternoon. Ridiculous. They could have easily canceled my service (I canceled on Friday for meals that wouldn't even be packed or shipped before Monday). Don't use this company, especially if you have high expectations for good-tasting meals."}
{"text":"Was pretty unsure after reading the reviews so figured I'd share my thoughts. I am someone who HATES cooking so I never do it.  Better than I expected actually. The pictures of the packaging don't make the food look too flattering but you can definitely tell it's good quality. Several levels above what you'd get at the frozen food isle, as you'd hope.  Shipping: You pick what meals you want about a week in advance (for example, if you choose delivery on Thursday, you have until the preceding Saturday at 5pm to change what you want). It's shipped via overnight fedex.  Packaging: The food is packed into one box with lots of insulation and 2-3 giant ice packs depending on how many meals you get.   Reheating: Each meal has a specific microwave time listed, which I've found to be perfectly accurate (though my microwave does match the 1100 watt spec on the boxes).  I was surprised that the meals come out of the microwave pretty much at the perfect temperature, with no cold parts, and nothing burning hot either. I rarely even have to let it sit before eating. The food does appear to be cooked ahead of time, so it's not like you're cooking it from raw.  Expiration Time: All meals seem to have an expiration date about 6 days from the delivery date. For example, one set was delivered on Tuesday and the food was use-by the next Monday. Another set delivered on Thursday was use-by Tuesday. This suggests they make the food almost daily, because it doesn't really matter what day you get it delivered.  They do note that you can freeze the meals to keep them longer, then add an extra minute when reheating them.  Meal Choice: There's about 30 different meals to choose from at the moment. 5 of these are breakfast specific. They've also got vegetarian-only meals and let you filter by different ingredients like dairy, pork, etc. It's a pretty good selection in my opinion.  Conclusion: Worth trying out."}
{"text":"Got 6 meals, first time. Have eaten 4, accompanied by 4 stomach aches. Trashed the rest........"}
{"text":"Got my box last week and it was packaged as said and was still cold upon arrival to my house. I was very excited to not have to worry about dinner. My Teenage son came home after a long day and asked whats for dinner?- I appropriately told him he has a choice of 6 different dinners. He opened the refrigerator and immediately took the steak out microwaved it and ate the whole thing... veges and all. For a picky eater, I was shocked. Throughout the next few days he managed to eat almost all the meals, only saving a turkey meal for me, which was very good.  I do really like the ease of Freshly, but I do understand the $ is a little high. Its just a personal preference on whats important for you to spend your money on. My time is valuable so the most help I can get works for me."}
{"text":"This is a second rating.  After earing most of the meals delivered, I must change my rating.  This food is nothing but glorified frozen  (not frozen) dinners.  Don't waste your money, unless you like very substandard food."}
{"text":"I do not understand the bad reviews.  We absolutely love these meals and have been eating them for at close to a year.  We have two young adults with us in our house, and they eat them happily.  They are fresh, taste good, and offer great variety.  If you want to eat healthier food or need to be gluten free (as we do), you MUST try this service."}
{"text":"Very unhappy with delivery. Tracked meals all day,, were supposed to be delivered today,, never came,, so now I'm waiting an additional day where they will be sitting all day long in the sun. Called and they were not helpful, stated I was still within the transit time of 48 hours and 12 hours to sit on your doorstep. I have always received them late on the following day from being shipped, however,  3 days is a long time for food to get shipped, get it in the fridge and then try and eat 6 meals before they go bad?? I end up freezing a lot of them.  Not for me,, had it for about 5 weeks but I have cancelled. Food is ok tasting but not that great.  Easy decision to cancel. Would not recommend.  UPDATE Megan reached out to me and we have resolved the issue. I appreciated the quick response. She truly cared about my issue and I am updating my review to reflect the excellent customer service."}
{"text":"@freshly had the worst customer service experience with Jashana (Supervisor Customer Experience). Anyone thinking about trying this company should steer clear.  I signed up a trial using a special promo code and when requesting to terminate the service and a refund I meet resistance. Jashana lead me to believe one thing and then tried to switch things up mid conversation. The issue has escalated to the point of having to contact my credit card company to investigate charges. Again steer clear of this company."}
{"text":"We LOOOOVVVVEEEEEE Freshly !  We are busy working parents and Freshly has been a real game changer.  In my head, I am the Mom who can spend hours roaming the aisles of Whole Foods reading labels. In reality, I am a hot mess who barely has time to shower. I pull up at work on 2 wheels and then burn rubber leaving the parking lot to pick up the kid and get her to gymnastics on time. I don't have time to cook healthy meals. Period! I tried food prep and Plated and found all that to be nice, but still a time suck.  Freshly takes all the label reading out of my shopping and guess work out of weeknight meals.  My favorite thing about this service is the list of 85 banned ingredients.  I feel good about what I'm feeding my family and that's VERY important these days. You never know what the heck you are eating. I save SO much time NOT going to the grocery store or cooking. Plus, I really end up saving money because I am not throwing all kinds of unplanned crap into the basket. I see people complaining about the lack of flavor.  It says right on the label to season it yourself.  Little sprinkle of this and that, pop it in the microwave and Bam! Dinner is served to your taste. Salt and pepper are usually enough for us.  I also see people talking about the meals going bad. Ummmm I guess they don't have freezers?  I don't get it.  Certainly, we have had a few that we didn't love, but there have been fast food and restaurant meals that we didn't love either. No biggie! We just don't order it again. We had one order that didn't get delivered and the customer service was awesome about it.  We didn't know what to do with ourselves without our Freshly meals that week.  We have really come to depend on the service and highly recommend it to anyone who has more desire to eat healthly than they have time to actually do it.  I think of it as Whole Foods meets, Kroger Click List meets Plated (or the likes) because they are strict about ingredients like Whole Foods, it's as convienent and time saving as click list and you get to try things that you may not cook otherwise like Plated.  Where Freshly wins is the fact that it's already cooked. That's hard to beat!  Keep up the good work Freshly!  And I have to mention that one reviewer who didn't like the service said to the company to be Nespresso instead of Keurig.  Funny thing is Nespresso is a Nestle brand who is also a stakeholder of Freshly.  LOL !  They are kinda Nespresso already. (Eyeroll)"}
{"text":"Absolutely AMAZING!!!!!! I am so impressed by everything that I haven't stopped talking about it to everyone I know. Customer service EXCEEDS any I have encountered. I found a Groupon for Freshly & had many questions. First I emailed & had a response in 24 hrs. As a result placed my first order. Despite a minor error in my order I am still giving 5 stars for the customer service. I called & spoke to Sunny (sp?) She was a sheer delight & not only did she apologize & accept responsibility on behalf of the company she credited my account.. Talk about SATISFACTION!!!. But the kicker, the food is 5 star quality. The meals look just like the website, were packed in dry ice & more ice blocks than I could hope for, we live in the desert. I was blown away, I mean blown away by the food itself. Never had vegetables so delectable & perfect the flavor was phenomenal. I look forward to every meal. The portions are hefty & filling and my favorite EVERYTHING is blanket across the board GLUTEN FREE. This can't be beat. My life just became so much more manageable thanks to FRESHLY!!!!! Thank You FRESHLY!!! Sincerely a beyond satisfied, happy customer"}
{"text":"Tried Freshly for two weeks, using coupon for the first.  Ordering was easy.  Delivery was as promised.  Packaging was simple and well done. Food was an upgrade from a standard microwave meal/first class airplane meal.  Generally tasty (except for the TERRIBLE breakfast porridge).  However, I canceled my subscription for the following reasons-  -All of the entrees had very high sodium content and pretty high calories (400 for the breakfast porridge) -Unacceptably limited vegetarian/pescatarian options (two shrimp, one fish, one vegetarian)- gets very old, very fast -Very expensive for what you get- for me, money better spent locally for more healthy, fresh meal delivery with variety of menu options."}
{"text":"I wish there was negative ratings, one star is too much for this business. They deleted my review off their facebook page, and blocked me from posting a new review, and deleted my review off their website.... no wonder, when you visit their website they have all 5 stars reviews.   Horrible customer service. Only after the money with extreme disregard to their customers.  I would definitely not recommend Freshly to anyone.  When a company decides that it is ok to ship perishable food to an empty house, despite me giving notice that I want to cancel the order if the week, 5 min after the deadline on Friday for a wednesday delivery, it just speaks loud to their extreme greed and unprofessionalism."}
{"text":"Every thing seemed like a great deal at first - especially given that your first order is half off......however after waiting for what felt like an eternity for my order to arrive one o f me=y neighbors informed me my package had been delivered upstairs to one of my neighbors and had gone bad by the time i got it. I was not thrilled about this and let freshly know. I received an email telling me they would comp 100 percent of my next order which i thought was fair - however when i did get around to ordering from them; obviously i had reservations by now, i was in fact charged the full price.......i have written them back in regards to this but all in all this is not ok by me"}
{"text":"Sort of surprised to see such harsh reviews, I think freshly is really good. I would probably give it 4 stars (mostly just because of price), but I think I need to give them 5 because they are looking under-appreciated here.  I actually freeze my meals so I don't feel pressured to eat them right away and they are still great. Haven't done any of the breakfast or fish dishes, but the chicken, steak, and pasta ones are on point. Originally I just wanted to do the promotional deal, but after I was pleasantly surprised with my first 6 I've now ordered 3 more times.   I wish they were a little cheaper, but they are still very good and easier / healthier than what I'd be eating otherwise. Steak Peppercorn is probably my fav. Folks seem to be expecting gourmet cooked dishes from a microwave, but as far as microwaved dishes go, these are as good as it gets."}

{"text":"I love this service so much! My husband and I are used to eating out every night and we knew we needed to change that as our weight was starting to get out of hand. We started to look in to the home delivery food services that send you your ingredients, but since I am not big on cooking, I kept searching and found Freshly! I love everything about this company!! From the neat packaging that your order comes in, to the food, to the pricing, to the convenience. This service gives you extra time in the evening to do what you want if you don't like spending your time cooking like me! Knowing that you are eating something that's healthy is the cherry on top. Also, if you don't eat your meal by the date listed on the packaging, you can freeze it so that it doesn't go to waste. My husband is usually picky with food and he has enjoyed everything we have ordered so far. Any time we have tried to clean up our eating habits in the past, our meals were very boring and bland which turned in to us going back to the unhealthy foods. Freshly keeps it interesting with all of their meals and it really has made us excited about eating healthy. Thank you Freshly!!!  ****For those who are giving this company a bad review based on your inability to  follow directions, that is all on you. The directions are all over the Freshly website as well as an email they send you after you purchase your meals. You have a certain day that you must either choose your meals by or pause your subscription, or it is assumed you want the same meals as your previous week. Do not give a bad review based on your own ignorance.****"}
{"text":"I didn't realize these were microwave meals, it wasn't very clearly announced anywhere before I signed up, and they don't taste very good. I have tried 3 and haven't eaten more than a few bites of any of them before tossing them out."}
{"text":"I'm really disappointed in this service. We've been using Freshly for almost a year, and it started off great. However, we've had a number of issues during that time, including food poisoning from their shrimp/scallop risotto, meal substitutions without our approval, extremely poor cuts of pork/beef with excessive grizzle (we're talking half the protein being straight flabby fat), and now they're quietly shrinking meals and using cheap filler so they can say the oz are almost the same. For example, we loved their sausage/peppers dish when first introduced. It was full of sausage and peppers, and was only like 450 calories. The package came in a divided dish, with riced cauliflower on the other side. Then, after a few weeks, it arrived all mixed together and there was like 6 tiny slices of sausage and the rest was cauliflower and peppers. It also dropped to 380 calories. When I complained about this, I was told they're trying to cut calories on their dishes. This is bull, and I'll tell you why: they always try to fly these \"improvements\" under the radar, by sneakily shrinking the dish gradually over a few weeks. (I have yet to receive an email blast informing all their subscribers that they're sending half the food at the same high ask price). They're just trying to cut costs on the more expensive components. This dish was already low calorie!  This is supposed to be dinner?! On what, a 1200 calorie a day diet?! I'm not a 14 yo girl, and neither is my husband. I didn't sign up for a diet plan. I  signed up for a meal service. 500-700 calories is acceptable for dinner. Having to make side dishes on our own to feel satiated isn't making our life easier, which is the whole point of a meal service.    I use this dish as an example, and if it was only this dish, I'd get over it. However, if you pay attention, they do this to most of their dishes. Their shrimp risotto (now always without scallops, which I'm guessing is because we weren't the only ones to get food poisoning) is a joke. It's half the size it used to be.  Pay attention to dishes, and take photos every (and I mean every) time you order; you'll see what I'm talking about yourselves.  In the end, the only thing that saved them from cancelling our weekly 12 meal plan subscription is their customer service, which is nice, helpful and quick to offer credits for bad service. But, we've had it. The Freshly experiment is over. May it die a quick death. We've switched to the 6 meals for a few weeks, and then we're cancelling. We live in Chicago. There are plenty of other meal services to choose from."}
{"text":"After the first lost delivery and absolute immediate and fantastic customer service the order arrived Saturday, Sept 24, 2016 about 9:30 in the morning. I had ordered the deal for first timers of 9 meals for $49. - Had to give it a shot. It's okay the first meal. Notes of herbs in the potato hash, the creamed spinach is pretty okay with the Flat Iron Steak dinner and the steak itself seems okay... until you hit meal number 2 or 3. -- Then I found it difficult to work eat my way through meal 3... not because of the size, these are very, very small portions: 3 brussel sprouts cut in half making 6 pieces as a serving of veg with about 2 tablespoons of chopped bacon tossed in - but because - it's - just - icky. It feels wrong... And after meal 3 you might have digestive issues - I did. The first day after only 2 meals I definitely had so much sodium on deck it made my eyeballs pop. Do not order these meals. They are in no way worth the price - even if they were free. - Horrible. - As a barometer -  I'm not a processed food eater. No frozen Stoffer's or anything like that is ever in my normal food intake. No fast-food. Not much sugar except a few super good quality delicious things once in a while. - I am a foodie and love wholesome well made food: not all organic, not vegan or veggie - though not a mandatory meat at every meal person, or even every day. -- This food is Sh-t. - Threw away 5 out of 9 meals."}
{"text":"This service has so greatly surpassed my expectations I had to write. If you want a calorie-controlled, convenient, tasty and extremely healthy program, this is your best bet. I had looked at other sites since I got very busy and wanted a solution to help manage calories but eat well. All of those programs use loads of white flour in their meals or are frozen, dehydrated, etc. Yuck. Freshly cooks fresh food and seals it up (no freezing) and then you just treat it like leftovers (heat it up and way you want - I hate microwaves so I don't use one). The presentation is great and the food tastes so wonderful and has a lot of variety. I haven't seen anything with white flour (I had a noodle dish and didn't realize until the end that I wasn't eating noodles but zucchini in perfect noodle form). The package you receive is well-packed and kept cool (and I am so thankful they don't use UPS) I can't say enough good things about this service...absolutely love it."}
{"text":"I think that this is a quality company. I originally tried a 1/2 price order for 9 meals in a 1 week period. The food was packed beautifully and was indeed fresh. The taste of the food was good, the vegetable sides were not as tasty as if I cooked them fresh but then that defeats the purpose of the convenience. I had a family situation and had to use the \"skip a week\" option for my next order. Unfortunately, it slipped through the cracks and I received the order. I called and my complaint was heard, my money refunded and all was handled very professionally. I am unable to continue using their service on a regular basis but I will use them for periods that I need the extra help and I am using meal prep time for other things. Great concept, I wish them the very best!"}
{"text":"The concept sounded good but I was disappointed with the food. The flat iron steak was a third of the size shown in the picture and the meat was chewy. The Chicken Parm was so salty and chewy I didn't finish it and the pasta was mushy. The meatballs were dry and the spagetti squash was nothing like the picture. It seemed like shredded squash instead. Not worth the $40 trial price."}
{"text":"Horrible service.  I did not know it was a recurring service.  Then email.  Your next meal is shipping.  I'm like, \"wait did I order this one?\"  I never made meal selection either.  I cannot cancel the order because this is already shipped etc.  meals were expensive and not worth buying either.  Not much better than the freezer section.  watch out."}
{"text":"TLDR - Great service for those that like/ are used to microwavable/TV dinners or have a busy schedule. Definitely healthier and fresher than other frozen meals. As far as meals itself, they leave a lot to be desired considering the portion size (not adjustable) and cost.   Was looking at alternatives to cooking for weeks when I'm too busy and don't really want to eat at a restaurant and came across Freshly and managed to get a $30 for 6 meals coupon so figured it's worth it to at least try. Looking at the meals, I did see that they were microwaveable. Though I'm not the greatest fan of microwaved meals, I did want to give them the benefit of doubt and try out the meals.  Ordering: Very simple and straight-forward. Enter your zip so that you know you can receive it, choose how many meals in a week (6-21), the delivery date, and the meals you want. Looking at the menu compared to the order sheet, the only complaint is that the sizes were different than what I received. Looking at the menu on the week I had my food, it did match so there might be some difference there.  Delivery: Had it delivered to my building and while the box was big, they claim everything is recyclable. Food was chilled properly and packaged neatly so no issues there.  Presentation: Meals were in their own containers and protein and veggies are separated. Only issue was the wrappers were difficult to get off. This has been stated in many reviews and there is supposedly a fix coming.   Food itself: I ordered 6 meals as follows: - Asian-Style Steak With Vegetable Stir-Fry - 3/5 - Beef Provencal With Polenta and Roasted Vegetables - 4/5 - Chicken Milanese With Braised Green Beans  - 2/5 - Chimichurri Salmon With Succotash - 3/5 - Roasted Turkey With Apple, Almond Butter Gravy - 2/5 - Garlic & Herb Shrimp - soul crushingly horribly/5  Overall, the food was really lacking to me. Sauces had separated partially so there was a colored liquid and colored textured portions separated. Having the sauces in separate packets would help this. While most of the meals tasted decent and did taste fresh, the vegetables were not too happy to be microwaved and most of the protein portions were underflavored. Being healthy doesn't mean you can't have flavorful meat.   I did want to call out two meals to show the difference between them. Beef Provencal - Great meal overall with some small callouts. The vegetables were in no way roasted and boiled instead. Whoever thought it was a good idea to boil brussels sprouts should be force fed them. Roasting them greatly improves the flavor, or at least does for me. The Polenta tasted fantastic but had an almost chunky and separated texture, especially once mixed with the remaining sauce from the beef.  Garlic & Herb Shrimp - Honestly, tasted like something repackaged from Lean Cuisine style meals. Vegetables were mushy, shrimps had no seasoning and were very rubbery/chewy, and the whole meal lacked flavor that was anything but depressing.   For $30 for 6 meals, it would be worth the service. Good variety and decent flavor for most meals and definitely a step up from other microwaveable meals. For $70, way too overpriced in my mind, especially for such small sized portions. I know it's not the target audience but you can make these meals for the same if not lower price, adjust it to your liking, and actually have a fresh cooked meal. For now, canceling the service and going back to home cooked meals.  For consumers, if you're used to microwaveable meals or need something that's quick and easy, it's worth a look to see if it's something you like. For Freshly, giving the option to cook the meals and separate the sauces, it will definitely improve the service."}
{"text":"There is too much salt in their meals.  Several have over 1000 mg in them.  I had hoped for a healthy meals, not one using salt which shows they are not using 'fresh' ingredients."}
{"text":"PROS:  Extremely convenient; no shopping; delivered right to your door; no prep time/just heat and eat.  CONS:  Meals are not always tasty; limited variety that becomes monotonous week after week; only a small step above the frozen TV dinners you get from a grocery store.  With a name like \"Freshly\" you get the image in your head of freshly made meals delivered right to your door.  However, these are still frozen dinners that you have to microwave, which is not my idea of fresh food.  Some of the meals are great, but not all.  After only 2 weeks, I realized this was just not for me and that I'd much prefer truly fresh (and not frozen) meals that were cooked (and not microwaved).    If you live a busy lifestyle with no time to make your own food, this might be a great option for you.  Or, you can go to the grocery store and buy (almost) the same frozen dinners at half the cost.  Otherwise, you can simply cook your own food to assure it's healthy, fresh, and delicious."}
{"text":"Used the Facebook discount for $49.00  Food was to be delivered July 29th.  It is now August 1st, and it has not been received.  if this was candy, shoes, or even a book, I would not be worried.  But it is perishable food.  YUK!  No ice packs are going to keep this cold for that long.   Also, when I go in and look at my order, there are several items that were changed.  I did not order salmon.  I cannot eat salmon.  Again, I did not order Salmon.  There is a salmon dish on my order.   Called CS and was told that someone had changed my subscription to a \"free\" 1 weeks delivery, so yay for me.  Well, my card was charged, so there was nothing free about it.   Was also told that it was the delivery people's problem that it was late.  May be, but I never even received an email from Freshly saying that it had shipped, and providing me with a tracking number.   Only offer was to change the date to 2 weeks from now (this was food we were going to use on our vacation) or to refund my money.  I asked for a refund.  I will let y'all know if I receive it.   I am afraid now I am going to get home from vacation with a box of spoiled food on my front porch that has been opened and enjoyed by raccoons.   There is also no way to cancel your subscription once they have you.  You can only pause it, or skip weeks.  I would really like to cancel and have proof that they no longer have my credit card number."}
{"text":"Food is great communication has been great and I can't think of a better way to get pre-made meals that are healthy."}
{"text":"I thought this would be similar to Hello Fresh and Blue Apron where they send you the ingredients and you cook it. I do not know how I missed that, but these are prepackaged frozen meals that you heat up in the microwave. The quality is equivalent to any other frozen meal (maybe on the higher end of frozen meals?) but still, pretty bland and left much to be desired....I cancelled my subscription immediately."}
{"text":"This food service provider is the worst. I tried it as I have a very limited diet to see if I could make it work. It could not work for me so I wanted to cancel my subscription. They made me go through a cancellation agency that charged me $35 to cancel my subscription. I had also tried Hello Fresh & Purple Carrot & they were wonderful about allowing me to cancel. Beware of this company's policies."}
{"text":"This is a refrigerated version of a Lean Cuisine. It is pre-made and has zero taste. I had to cover it in cheese just to eat it. Low end of edible for sure. It's marketed as a make your own dinner box, like Blue Apron or Plated, but it is most definitely NOT that type of service."}
{"text":"My introductory order of 6 meals arrived Saturday... Sunday morn I had been charged for 6 more meals. I had time to try one meal, and it was bland.   My first mistake: Dont assume that something called 'Freshly' is local.  I didnt know they were going to cook it Wednesday, ship it on Thursday from Phx to SF to arrive on Saturday, to be eaten over the next 6 days. 'FRESH'?    My other mistake is having a busy week and 'missing' the warning email... I still can't find it, but it was supposed to give me the option of skipping a week. I thought the promo offer would allow me to try the food first, before I had to take measures to keep them from charging me for more. I was wrong again.    They refused to cancel or refund the second order. I have to pay $60 for 6 more wk-old airline meals to arrive next Saturday. I feel a little taken advantage of, scammed. I really wanted to try their food with a little time to decide if it was for me. A weeks worth of meals should be allowed to be eaten over the course of a week before a new charge applied.     Support said \"While I certainly understand your frustration, please understand that we prepare your food from fresh ingredients and take the time to cook them properly and with care. Our meals are perishable and require a strict production schedule that, if deviated from whenever someone wishes, would damage the integrity of the meals. This is why it is so critical to give ample time for changes or cancellations\".   Today is Monday, my meals are scheduled to ship Thursday. I suggested there was plenty of time to cancel and credit my card. They could keep their meals and have a satisfied customer. Satisfied customers are apparently not their priority. Had they cancelled, and refunded as I requested I might have better enjoyed the meals remaining in my fridge, and re-ordered at a later date. Now I have a sour taste in my mouth to go with the bland food.     I'm eating the Chicken Caponata while I write this so you can get a 'fresh' review. The broccoli has good texture, a hint of garlic flake (which looks a bit odd, like a hint of grated cheese), but is bland. The chicken is tender, not dry, the toasted almond coating is there, not sure it adds anything. The eggplant Caponata with raisins and capers is ok, but lacks a flavor punch that one would expect. I think all the flavors have melded and mellowed in shipping. I added salt to enhance the flavors and it did, quite well. However, at 640gm of sodium it's already on the high side and shouldn't need more.   Last night I had the Pecan pork, the pork also was tender, not dry, but the 'gravy' and pecan coating were insufficient and flavorless. The only real flavor in the meal was the raisins and cranberries with the green beans.   I don't have a 'refined' palate. I consider myself an average American. Though I live in a city with many excellent restaurants I eat and enjoy most everything, from street vendor fare to occasional 5star dining.   This experience left me disappointed with the food and the customer service.   If you like bland meals shipped long distance via FedEx, this service is for you, but I think you would do better with a local service."}
{"text":"Subscribed for a few months. Meals are okay. I feel like they were better when I first started, then the portions started getting smaller, the taste more bland and the delivery late. I was recently double billed and that was my straw with this company and I cancelled. The meals look very gourmet on the website, but this is not the case. I recommend if you want to try, only do this with a promo code."}
{"text":"I spent more time than I want to admit researching meal delivery services. I'm very happy with Freshly so far and will update my review if anything changes or I have more to add. I saw the negative overall rating and was worried, but I think they must have stepped up their game recently. Here's why I chose Freshly over the others I was considering, which included anything from frozen to fresh to easy meal kits (15 minutes or less prep). So this comparison included Munchery, Factor 75, Fresh n Lean, Gobble, BistroMD, Fresh Chef, and MagicKitchen. Others were even more expensive.  If you don't give a hoot about health or high carb/high sugar food, eating tons of gluten, etc, Freshly might not be for you. But I promise this doesn't taste like diet food (it's not), and it's actually still cheaper than the less healthy competition, surprisingly. I calculated plan costs for pretty much every offering out there, and all were either close to the same or more expensive. Now, I'm NOT celiac or Paleo, but I eat moderately healthy - less so when I'm extremely busy, which I will be very soon...thus the subscription. I do have a gluten sensitivity, though (I get bloated and foggy brained when I have a lot of it), so I really wanted a place that had lots of low gluten options, without being strictly Paleo (sorry, but I love my dairy and legumes...especially dairy!!) There isn't as much cheese as I'd like in the Freshly menu, but at least there's some. :)  I was only going to get this for the upcoming crazy-busy month or two, but I can already tell that the time it saves me just might make it worthwhile.   CONS: -They really need to offer Monday or Tuesday deliveries to Seattle! We're a big enough city! I don't want my deliveries at the end of the week when weekdays are when I'm busiest...  -I do wish they'd have more seafood options, but I understand that it's hard to ship those. -I'd love even more cauliflower rice and spaghetti squash base options instead of the carbs, although they're still better than most other places I considered in that regard. :("}
{"text":"Out of the nearly two dozen meals my husband and I tried from Freshly we found two or three acceptable and worth re-ordering. The rest were mediocre or unpleasant tasting or had strange components or fillers. Quinoa and mashed cauliflower seemed to take the place of, or supplement, nearly any of the usual starches....grains or potatoes, unacceptable substitutes for us.  Sadly their chili and the bolognese sauce for penne tasted almost identical - tomato and ground beef with carrots and celery. I mean, carrots in chili?  Oddly the best tasting meal I had was one sent to us by mistake - an omelet, for which customer service removed the charge. I had refused to order the breakfast items because $10 is outrageous to pay for a small helping of oatmeal or a 2 egg omelet with a few veggies."}
{"text":"Like others have said there are a lot of things wrong with freshly. I'll list a few.  1. The food is really not that good. It's mushy and bad quality.  2. The subscription settings are wacky and confusing. 3. It's not a good value.  If you are curious to try it. Use a promo code otherwise you are without a doubt wasting your money. Also don't forget to PAUSE OR CANCEL YOUR SUBSCRIPTION. They don't give refunds."}
{"text":"Great food. Love the chicken parmesan, chili and buffalo chicken. Customer service was great when I needed to have a shipment delivered to a different address. They handled it very well. Prices are reasonable and I'm losing weight. Can't think of anything bad to say about this company. Do be aware it's a subscription service. But if you like the product that's even better."}
{"text":"Where do I start? Expensive, looks like a frozen dinner, uneven quality, doesn't keep very long, issue with deliveries and lots of salt. Most supermarkets have ready to eat meals that are fresher, have more choice, you get to see what you are getting and you are not trapped in a subscription.   Never going back to Freshly ever again!"}
{"text":"I don't understand the people giving 1 star reviews. Lol.  Where does it say you HAVE to consume the food in 3 days? I get my delivery on Mondays and I have until Friday/Saturday to finish my 6th meal. Each meal has a \"use by\" date and I haven't seen one that suggests 3 days - it's usually 5 (maybe they're getting their shipments late).   I've had 12 different meals so far and they have been surprisingly good, although some are better than others. Pretty fortunate I haven't had any stomach issues, but I also make sure there isn't anything I'm allergic to in my orders. I've also had my share of Hungry-Man's and Lean Cuisines and Freshly is a definitely better than that for those people comparing it to TV dinners (it doesn't even come frozen, so how is it a TV dinner)."}
{"text":"I have tried several home delivery food companies and I absolutely love Sunbasket for the quality, flavor, creativity, recipes,etc. When I saw the opportunity to \"try\"\"some of the meals for $39  on a facebook promo, I opted to do so with great excitement and anticipation because these were already prepared.  I was absolutely shocked when I tasted two of their recents offerings. The penne pasta was mediocre at best. The BBQ like chicken with broccoli and potatoes I literally spit out!!! It was absolutely vile! Flavorless, soggy, worse than any third rate TV dinner ever tried. I was so taken a back I requested a refund for my \"trial\" which they denied. Not surprising! This company won't last and will get many people \"trying\" for $39 and never have repeat customers again. I was so excited to have prepared food of quality that I could just heat up  and was just blown away that someone could put out such a poor product in this day and age. Please beware and don't waste your money! You will be sorely disappointed. I cancelled immediately and requested a refund because it was that bad. I almost never give negative reviews but felt so strongly that I wanted to protect others from going through this. This is truly a consumer rip off."}
{"text":"These Freshsly meals are so clutch! No preservatives and delicious. I had this steak peppercorn, mashed potatoes, carrots, and green beans for less than $8. I've paid $50+ for a similar meal. Use promo code EAT639 and we for yourself- $20 off."}
{"text":"I had to create a Yelp acct just so I could review this business.  I'm not sure what more anyone could want from a meal delivery service, honestly some people just like to complain.  I think most people don't review unless they are unhappy for whatever reason, so more need to get on board with supporting a business they love. Fantastic food and great customer service! We've had several dinners and not one complaint! I was actually amazed at the amount of flavors they have all had! I was hooked after the cod cakes, I couldn't believe how much flavor was packed into the entire dinner! My husband is a huge flavor guy and even he was shocked at the flavors in these meals! Love love love your company!!! I wish I could do a 10 star to help with the silly reviews from others."}
{"text":"I've been ordering freshly on and off for a few years. Overall the pros are the high quality and very convenient food. Yes you microwave it, but it is nothing like a microwave meal!   I don't order it as often as I use to because I would like more variety. They did add a few new meals over the 2017 holiday season but now I've tried those too. A few meals I don't mind having every week - the chicken livorno is my favorite, and my husband loves the baked penne marinara.   If you haven't tried freshly yet, it is definitely worth a go. On the rare occasions I haven't been able to finish the meals before their best by date (about 5 days from the day they are delivered) I've found that some meals freeze and reheat well. You can use my coupon code for $20 off the first and second weeks of freshly. Enjoy!  https://refer.freshly.com/s/Jessica137"}
{"text":"I can't even describe how horrible this company is!  They simply don't understand customer service!  I forgo to cancel my subscription due to a busy life and I sent them an email requesting that the ext shipment of meals not to be sent to me and to refund me $65.  They refused and shipped me their nasty food anyways.  I asked for a refund and told them I didn't want their food and they REFUSED to refund me!  I couldn't believe it.  This is a great example of a company stuck in the dark ages.  If your corporate sees this reviews, i expect a manager or someone higher up to email me and provide me with a proper refund.  Your food is atrocious and will never use your service again."}
{"text":"If I could give them negative stars I certainly would!  I was so excited to sign up for a healthy- food delivery service for my family's busy weekdays but I haven't even received my first delivery yet and I'm already disappointed!  After seeing their ad on Facebook, I went to their website and everything looked amazing so I proceeded to sign up.  The default delivery date showed this Friday and I discovered I was unable to change the delivery date to next week (as I know I will be out of town this weekend for Easter).  On this same screen it states, \"You can change the day later,\"  so I went on through the purchasing process.  I selected the $129 plan for 12 meals a week which I felt was worth it considering the time I would save during the week.  After completing my order I could not find anywhere that would let me change the date.  I searched all over the site and the Help section with no luck so I emailed customer service with my concerns immediately after placing the order.  Their reply was absolutely shocking.  Shocking because it's 2016 and Customer Service is key to the success of any business and Freshly could care less if they address my issue.  They basically told me that the order was already processed and suggested that I donate the food or give it to a friend if I don't want it.  I never said I did not want the delivery, it just needs to come next week because I will be out of town Fri-Sun so no one would be there to receive the order.    I cannot wrap my mind around how they believe this is an acceptable reply to my email.  I'm a brand new customer that expressed my concerns about the delivery date 4 days prior to delivery and literally as soon as I placed the order."}
{"text":"After getting an email regarding by box being unable to be deliver the customer service rep let me know they would be kind enough to credit MY MONEY FOR A BOX I PREPAID for to a future order. AKA no compensation offered at all. When I expressed my disappointment in this solution and said I would not likely use the service again, instead of seeking to right the situation the rep (Robin W) cancelled my subscription. Can not believe the level of disregard. We were relying on these meals and do not have a lot of funds to replace meals now with our money tied up with Freshly."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service and they suck you into a subscription for simply wanting to try their product.  Meals aren't that tasty only positive is the convenience."}
{"text":"The bad reviews about subscriptions and customer service are the customer's own fault. Freshly clearly explains how their system works, so customers need to read before signing up. Some people even complain about the plastic covering the food. I just use a knife to cut it off. Not a big deal! The food is great plus it's gluten free. For those of us who have to avoid gluten, this is a dream come true. The food is fresh and much better for you than a typical frozen dinner. The delivery and convenience of microwaving the food is well worth the price. Plus the more meals you order the cheaper it is. I made a complaint about a side dish being too watery and they promptly refunded the price of that meal! They really do care. Give them a chance!"}
{"text":"So, here we are all these months later.  I continue to love the comedy writing here from the disgruntled people: \"It didn't have enough pepper or salt.\"  Here's a crazy idea - go to your cupboard and get out those little shakers that say salt and pepper.  Shake them onto your food.  I know this requires some effort but the exercise is good for you.  Same with any other seasoning you may want to use to perk things up.  Then there are the \"three days to eat everything\" folks.  Not quite - I eat them over four days and have never had an incident in doing so, plus they can be frozen, rather like some people's brains.    Here's the thing about Freshly and probably any of these services - learn.  Learn what you like and don't like, when it's best to receive, how to parse them out.  I frequently eat one for lunch, jog, then later eat one for dinner - easy to lose weight that way.  Another thing to learn: You can cancel a week anytime you like - very easy to do, you're always sent an e-mail and there you are.  I don't do it every week, and sometimes a month goes by, but I usually come back to it because it's just convenient.  The one time I either didn't get the e-mail or it went into the ether and I saw they charged me, I simply picked up this thing called the telephone, called their easy to locate phone number, and even though it was a day after the cancel time, they canceled anyway and immediately refunded that money.  Whether you end up loving this company or not, the one thing you cannot say is that they don't have great customer service, because if you say that I will come over to your house and conk you on the head with a Freshly meal or, maybe even a churro.    The meals: They switch 'em up every now and then, which is nice, but I tend to like the ones I like.  I've tried a lot of them - they're all well prepared but obviously not everyone is going to like everything.  For example, I would rather have a truck drive through my forehead than order anything called pork carnitas.  I'm very fond of the meatloaf (I do add ketchup, just because I do that), I like the sausage and peppers, the bolognese, the chicken risotto used to be better but it's still pretty good, the chilis are all good, so plenty to choose from.  And to the people who say there isn't enough variety - my guess is that the people saying that go to restaurants and always order the same thing, and when they cook at home they always make the same five dishes.  What's the difference, folks?  I haven't tried the breakfast stuff because I don't like eating in the morning.  I've recommended Freshly to any number of people - people on diets tell me they prefer it to Jenny Craig, for example.    And once again to the people who say these are like frozen dinners - go have a frozen dinner sometime, because these are nothing like any frozen dinner I've ever had.  Also, as they recommend I, too, would recommend plating the meal.  Good delivery date is important, too - Monday - Wednesday work really well - I do Wednesdays but the arrive very late in the afternoon thank to the always non-superior delivery skills of ONTRAC, so I usually eat one that evening, two on Thursday, two on Friday, and the final one on Saturday.  Works really well.  So, that is my update for Freshly, whether you want it or not."}
{"text":"I tried this service for the first time.  My order was not delivered on the day that was choosen. For that inconvenience, I was issued a credit on my next order. The food wasn't bad at all. There were one dish I will pass on next time, the meatloaf.  I just didn't care for it. I plan to use the service in the future.  It was one less meal a day that I didn't have to prep for."}
{"text":"I don't usually write reviews because I work 80 hours per week and don't generally like the standards of decorum of such online social spaces, however I feel inclined to speak up when it comes to this company. I have very high standards for everything in my life and when I ordered these meals it was more for the convenience as I did not think they would really measure up to what I am used to eating in terms of taste and quality. But I must say I was wrong in that regard. Not only did it exceed my expectations as far as convenience, simplicity, and service, but the food is exceptional to taste. Every meal is amazingly prepared and tastes great. With my busy schedule, this is the company I have been waiting for!  Bravo!"}
{"text":"My husband and I just finished our first 6 plate trial, and loved it! We will be reordering! This time we'll include some of the lunches."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best prepackaged food around. Be as skeptical as you want to be, this is the real deal. Portions are great, food tastes delicious, and delivery is quick. 5 out of 5 stars for me. American owned and American made. Feel proud to serve your family some of the finest meals available."}
{"text":"The menu is very limited with mostly chicken options. We got the veggie pasta which was good. The steak with pepper sauce not so much. The beef had that stewed flavor. The pork with rosemary was really tasteless. If their was rosemary it was undetectable. Dumped bbq sauce on it . Veggies with this no flavor either. Will not be ordering from them again!"}
{"text":"Too expensive for the food quantity/quality of each meal. The meals can be tasty (depending on which you order) but are inconsistent with the quality of each meal and seemed like the cooks cared less with each week. The quantity is under what I believe it should be for the price (an overall judgement, one or two seem barely justifiable for price), the main course is often overwhelmed by the sides in regards to the portion. The \"main\" sides that should count such as rice and potatoes are often lacking. Overall I think there is a good concept here but the value isn't there as advertised.  I do have to say that the chili has incredible flavor and I was impressed by that, however the meal being only be a few spoonfuls conjured up some major disappointment. Chili being rather inexpensive to make should have at the very least matched the size of the other meals."}
{"text":"Do NOT order from Freshly - the food never arrives.  The customer service is awful as well.  Worst experience."}
{"text":"I've been ordering Freshly for over a year and some of the meals are hit or miss, but it's rare they are bad. The portions are pretty decent and consistent. I'm a busy person and work out daily, so it's important to me to eat clean and just know what i'm eating so i'm not thinking about it. Freshly is totally reliable. My delivery was late once and they refunded me, but other than at, my meals are always cold and packaged well... just wish all the packaging wasn't so wasteful.  Every meal does seem fresh though and clean ingredients.. I don't eat junk food, so Freshly hits the mark. I don't recommend their breakfast. The omelets are small and don't hold up well in the fridge and i just don't like the flavor and ingredients of them. They should had a side to the breakfasts to make it feel comparable to the dinners.  The food isn't over salty or seasoned, so I add salt to mine and usually steamed kale to make it feel a bit bigger. The chicken is sometimes really lean and sometimes very fatty... it used to always be great, but not sure if they changed their meat vendor. The gluten free pastas are the best and the pork quality is top notch.  I wish they'd stop discontinuing my favorite stuff like the Spagehtti Squash Meatballs.  Also they have promos for $39 all the time, so they should just make your meals $39 and no promos. I cancel my subscription all the time until i get a new promo because $39 is the price point for me.  I really like Freshly, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I was pretty pleased with the food and have ordered 4 times from them.  I still question the freshness of it but if they say it's and healthy I trust them.  Their Facebook page posts promo codes, which I recently used.  Every time I do it I confirm the price and the delivery date before I submit my order.  They did not honor it when I got my credit card statement.  I'm very skeptical since you can't review past orders online receipts.  The customer service rep I dealt with online would not credit my money.  I kept sending screenshots on how the flaw was with the promo code and they kept coming back with excuses.  I sent 3 screen shots confirming all the error on their end.  They would rather keep the $35 and lose me as an unhappy customer than continuing.  Honestly had they resolved it I would have continued making orders. Michael Wystrach, if you're ready this please enjoy the $35 you got to pull over me!"}
{"text":"My first trial order has finished not being started yet. People used to order such food for lunch, so they are at work as well as me. I ordered in my office, so had only provided Saturdays as delivery option. Last Saturday Fedex delivered it \"somewhere\", so I had no idea as my office was closed. After the call we had to close issue by refunding. So my opinion: - more flexible schedules should be available - closer work with delivery service, as currently no clear view of what's going on (delivery is a black box for me and Freshly), it's better to integrate delivery in web site - $10 is quite high price for such meal as Downtown SF (expensive place) provides fresh food for the same price, and it's cooked right there without any deliveries"}
{"text":"We've only had it for a week now with 6 meals. Both my wife and I have been very positively surprised I must say.  Over the years, we tried all kinds of home-meal delivery services, out of a desire to eat fresh and healthy food at home. Usually we gave up with the first shipment already when we realized how much work it is to actually prepare a meal. It's just not something that we enjoy after both of us spend the whole day at work, so normally we would just order something from Doordash or Postmastes. We basically never cook at home.  Freshly is a perfect addition to that. It's a lot cheaper than getting food from Doordash and in many cases also cheaper than getting takeout from other places that we love, like Tender Greens or Sweetgreen. Sure, it's not the same thing, but it also has the convenience that it's already in the fridge and only takes about 3-5 minutes for a decent quality meal.  I also like the packaging, which seems very environmentally friendly and the whole philosophy of using natural, high quality ingredients. Wish they would offer organic as an upgrade.  My only complaint is portion size. 400-500 calories is just not enough for a dinner. Eating two meals doesn't seem to be a good solution because then it's too much. The price is really low at about $10 per meal, especially if you consider the cost of packaging and shipping, but honestly, we would happily pay more and have 30-40% larger portions. It would be awesome if they had a way to let you choose portion size.  Overall, very happy so far. I think we might stick with this service."}
{"text":"Just got our first trial order.  It came nicely packaged, and it is very Easy to prepare.  They come packaged like a TV dinner.  We tried the meatloaf dinner and the roasted turkey dinner.    Taste was OK, not great.  It doesn't taste like a homemade meal, but it's not terrible. So, for a busy working single or couple that really has no time, it's better than a frozen grocery store entree, but we will not order again...cancelled."}
{"text":"I'm kind of sad to see the bad reviews. I've ordered from them several times and I've liked the majority of the food I've gotten. I love that it's low-carb, high protein, and gluten-free. Every delivery I've gotten has been on time, packaged well and very fresh. There is a good variety of entrees to choose from as well as the option to get some entrees without cheese which is great for me bc I can't do dairy. The food is really healthy with whole, simple ingredients, no preservatives and nothing artificial. My only concern would be the salt content but I'm not parched like I am say, after a pizza or a burger so it can't be too bad. There is nutrition info available in case you wanna be sure of what ur eating. There are a few plans to choose from in terms of number of entrees delivered. You can also skip weeks and pause or cancel your subscription with ease.  They usually have deals or offers so definitely be on the look out for them in your email. I took away one star bc any way you look at it, it can be a lil pricey."}
{"text":"Just say no!! These are just Unfrozen TV dinners. Overpriced, so so quality. Home Chef way better (we like this over blue apron). My wife cancelled and they sent ANOTHER batch of the SAME dinners (we don't even want the first batch). The subscription model is set to rip you off. Called and complained, and wife was too nice, and only got half $ back. Don't let them get you like they got us!. - although I think we may refuse the second CC charge anyway."}
{"text":"Solid three stars from me. I tried Freshly because if their promotion for $40 for 6 meals. I got the pork carnitas, shrimp scampi, and beef stew.  The best of the three was definitely pork carnitas. It was filling and had great flavor. The shrimp scampi had too much liquid, although the flavor wasn't bad. The beef stew had no liquid...so not really a \"stew.\"  The main issue I have was that I only had 3 days to eat the 6 items before it expired. So for those who say they got about a week expiration date, they probably get deliveries on Wednesdays (I had mine delivered on Friday).  I'm not going to be continuing this subscription. The full price is not worth it for me. I can see how this service can be useful to some, especially for the convenience...just can't imagine myself microwaving my meals on a consistent basis (I do love to cook)."}
{"text":"Buyer BEWARE. READ THE FINE PRINT. Bought this deal off of Groupon hoping this would be a perfect answer for a single that doesn't like to cook anymore. Beginning this review with a positive--it was nicely packaged - when it arrived food was still frozen. BUT I found the food very disappointing then lo and behold here came another package that I wasn't expecting. Turns out once you have ordered, they keep sending. YIKES. So called them right away cancelling , asked for a refund and to pick up the delivery, but they refused. So the package sits in my patio and rots because it's not worth taking up space in my small freezer."}
{"text":"I have just started using this service, but I must commend this company on it's extraordinary customer service first and foremost.  My initial order was due to come on a Saturday when pretty much all of the Eastern US had gotten pounded with winter storms.  Unfortunately, my delivery did not arrive that day; however, I didn't have to do anything!  Freshly reached out to me that evening and advised that they had learned my shipment wasn't arriving in time, expressed apologies, and not only did they promptly credit my account for that shipment, but the next shipment was free.  The following Saturday, my order arrived right as scheduled, and I was quite excited about giving the food a try.  It did not disappoint.  I particularly enjoyed the turkey chili, and other than adding a tad of salt and pepper to season to my taste, all of the meals were quite good- and the veggies were delightful.    I order 6 meals a week currently (3 meals for my son and myself each), and I find that this is ideal for me to not worry about cooking every single night after work.  I would highly recommend giving Freshly a try!"}
{"text":"I just started receiving my meals these past two weeks.  I cannot say enough good things about this service.  Dinner is cooked in 3 minutes and the meals are delicious.  The ingredients are fresh, and the best part is when I come home from work, dinner is already cooked and there is no mess to clean up!  Thank you Freshly!"}
{"text":"What it is. Pretty tasty refrigerated pre-made dishes that are healthy and delivered to your home. Who it's for. Someone who doesn't want to shop and is cooking for one and doesn't want to go out to dinner all the time every night because that is either too expensive or has too many calories. Why it gets negative reviews. You only get a day after delivery to suspend delivery for the next time and likely those people are just bitter. Calling it a TV dinner is completely inaccurate. A TV dinner is Frozen. This is refrigerated and healthy. Still, at $10 a meal what you're paying for is time not spent cooking to have something healthy. That can be quite valuable for a young professional. And these are for one. Also, at between 5 to 600 calories depending upon your weight and size you could make this into two meals as I do. More calories and more expensive than Trader Joe's meals but also again the key is they are delivered right to your door and they give you a good bit of variety."}
{"text":"I am not feeling enamored with Freshly right now. My very first week with them, I see what is no doubt a not uncommon occurrence--I get an email warning me my food \"might not arrive on time\" and to throw it away when it gets here and \"we will refund your money.\"   Freshly, this is your one and only chance. When this happens again, I will immediately cancel my subscription. What the hell good is it if you can't get my food to me on time? Now I have to re-plan an entire week of meals. I don't have time for this kind of headache and what is supposed to be a convenience with Freshly so far has been nothing but a hassle.   Also--that seems like a good way to eliminate one week of my twenty-dollar discount, so you will also give my my full forty dollar discount by extending the discounted price an extra week. If you don't, I'll be adding to this review. And yes, I WILL be sharing the hell out of this review on Facebook."}
{"text":"Excellent customer service.  The food is delicious.  My favs are the peppercorn steak, meatballs pasta, shrimp and the penne.  I love their service and the food.  I just cancelled my account because it's kind of spendy.   I will go back and order again."}
{"text":"I have tried multiple prepared meal delivery services and so far Freshly is my favorite. The meals are delicious, made with fresh ingredients, and well packaged. I have no idea what some of these other peoples expectations could have been at around $10 a meal made fresh delivered to your door. Some of the meals could use a little salt and pepper is my greatest critique. All of their packing material is recyclable with recycling or reuse instructions printed on them. I am even saving the denim insulation packages to insulate my garage!!"}
{"text":"BUYER BEWARE: If I could give 0 stars for this review I would.   My first Freshly meal, the Peach Balsamic chop, turned out alright - except for the carrots which tasted an awful lot like burned plastic. If you've ever had a bad TV dinner, this was like that, x10. Wound up tossing the whole thing, because why flirt with fate?   Little did I know that a few days later I would get taken down by another meal which I finished in full, the Buffalo Chicken entree. Within a few hours of consumption I started to feel ill, and wound up with food poisoning, which till today is still acting up.  I ordered Freshly as I'm going through a particularly busy period at work right now, and to be felled by food poisoning as a result of my hoping for some convenience now seems completely moot. I cancelled my subscription today, and won't be looking back."}
{"text":"Disgusting.   Not only the food, but also the atrocious amount of waste.    I weighed the packaging after I removed my meals from the box.  18 POUNDS OF WASTE.  About 2 pounds of food. It is the most ridiculous thing to see. This HUGE box holding cardboard and insulation and enormous ice packs ... And then, these little packages of food (in plastics trays with a cardboard cover wrapped around it to make sure they are being as environmentally repugnant as possible)  The food is quite awful.  But, hey, it could be a great weight loss method. Buy food that you will only eat a few bites of, and do overhead presses and squats with the 20 pound box of garbage.    Totally makes sense."}
{"text":"First order and I was pleasantly surprised! I had the Toasted Almond Chicken & Risotto. My husband had the Grilled Flat Iron Steak with Potato Hash & Creamed   Spinach.  My portion was pretty huge...almost 700 calories, so I only ate half. Really surprised how moist the chicken was after I microwaved it to prepare it. Very flavorful.  Husband was pleased with his steak. Steak portion was smaller, but filled him up. He really enjoyed the vegetables, definitely good.   Comes out to about $11 a meal, but for what you get and the convenience, it's definitely worth it. Considering I can get two meals out of 1, it really is a great deal.  Food was packaged nicely, tons of ice containers surrounding..super cold when we pulled them out of the box."}
{"text":"I'm here to set the record straight. I've been using Freshly for about 2 years and they're great. Before Freshly I was using Snap and here's how Freshly beats Snap.   Convenience: Freshly saves me about 10-15 hours every week. I don't have to cook for 2 hours a day, nor do I have to go to the grocery store. That equates to almost $100,000 a year in saved time when multiplied time saved by my hourly pay rate. Hands down, a no-brainer.   Taste/Food: I cook professionally, dine at high-end restaurants, I'm a foodie that only eats at the highest rated restaurants regardless of the price. Freshly's food is good. It's usually not highly seasoned, which is OK because I can season it.  The food lasts over 7 days in the fridge and I can freeze and reheat the meals all the time and the taste is consistent. Snap's meals don't last for more than 1-2 days.  Portions are about right. Not a lot of small portions - just right.   Delivery: When I started the service the delivery was on Thursday but I was able to change my delivery to Mondays starting the next week. The deliveries are always on time, intact, and still cold.   Menu: They have a good menu and change selection. Of course, more selection would be nice, but they change it around often enough to make it OK.  Customer Service: Support is great about doing everything they can to take care of their customers which is rare these days. GREAT customer service.   Price:  Unlike a lot Yelper's, I'm not broke and don't make references to prices specifically. Value perhaps, but not price. Freshly is cheap. I order 12 meals every week and I pay around $9 per meal.   CONS:  They need organic meals, more beef meals (I'm Blood Type O), fresh salads and snacks would be nice, more breakfast options,"}
{"text":"I'm definitely a fan. When I know I'm going to have a busy week or I just don't want to cook for a while (it's not something I enjoy), I order 6 meals for the week.   Taste: The meals are good for what you're getting. And what are you getting? A pre-packaged meal. Yes, yes, they're made fresh and all that, but if you're trying to make them last the week, you'll have to freeze at least some of them. For that reason, it'll never taste like a meal that you had just cooked yourself piping hot or ordered in a restaurant. But don't be disappointed, this is definitely not lean cuisine*. I genuinely enjoyed the taste and flavor of some of the meals and those are the ones I order again. The portion size is also really good (unlike lean cuisine*) and I say that as a bigger girl who likes to eat a lot. Basically, for a pre-prepared non-restaurant meal that you didn't buy frozen from the grocery store, this is as good as it gets.   *Despite the shade, I usually have lean cuisine for lunch.   Convenience: I come home from a 10 hour work day, and I'm exhausted. I used every ounce of my will power not to stop by Taco Bell because I'm trying to pretend I'm better than that. I pop the freshly meal into the microwave for a few minutes and I don't bother to plate it because nobody loves washing the dishes. Done. It's that easy. The packaging IS annoying, though. So much for helping the earth...  Health: Look, it depends on what kind of person you are. If you're kind of a piece of crap (like me) who eats a lot of fast/fast casual food or makes huge bowls of pasta or potatoes at home, this is great. I'm always the worst at dinner and these meals are usually healthier than whatever I end up making. In fact, I use the meals on the lower end of the calorie count for weight loss. However, if you're actually a pretty healthy person, these aren't the best. Some of the meals have a lot of sodium and they could probably go a little easier on the carbs. But look at the menu for yourselves.   Price: It's okay, not great. I do the 6 meals a week plan for $60. It doesn't break the budget but there's no doubt it's cheaper to cook at home. But like.... the convenience, though.... If you take too long of a break between weeks, they send out $20 off coupon so that's pretty cool.  Overall, I recommend."}
{"text":"TLDR: an easy and relatively low-priced option for paleo/GF meal service with low calorie counts. I don't see myself being a regular customer, and I wasn't thrilled with the lack of contact with customer service, but flavors and portions are better than they appear.  Issue #1: my order arrived 24 hours late. Scheduled for 12/15, not received by 10PM, no email notifications and no way to track. I confirmed that they took money out of my account and that I had the delivery date correct. There's no way to contact anyone directly, but if there's a delay with your order, the FAQ page says to email their support department the following day (implying that this is fairly common?). Convenience of preordering is irrelevant if they can't keep to stated delivery time and I end up without lunch/dinner, waiting an extra day. So far no one from the company has acknowledged the delay or even reached out with a form letter or link for feedback.  Issue #2: Full disclosure: I ordered with their half off promo. I can't imagine anyone paying $10/meal for this. It's essentially TV dinners, one step removed from the Atkins line. The food doesn't look appetizing and it literally arrives frozen solid, further lending the comparisons to your grocery-store aisle food. Fresh =/= frozen. The cook times are not accurate- all of meals needed at least an additional minute, if not double the listed time just to get heated through. I'm aware that there can be cooking variations with microwave wattage and elevation, but this is ridiculous. Food is icy inside when following directions.  THE POSITIVES:They offer large menus of over 40 breakfast, lunch, and dinner meals each week, and I like that you can fully customize each meal instead of just in pairs like with other services. But the food is not exciting and service so nonexistent, it's not worth the price or arguable \"convenience\". Note that you have to join, order, and check a specific page, then download a PDF simply to view calorie counts or additional nutrition info. Not sure why this isn't just printed on the label. However, counts are very reasonable for portion size.  TIP: After placing your first order, immediately put a hold on all additional weeks until you try and decide if you want to continue. Freshly one requires NINETY-SIX hours (four whole days) notice in order to change or cancel any service, which is barely enough time to even eat what they ship before another one is on it's way."}
{"text":"no no no don't do it!!! I have gone with prepped meals in the past and have found them tasty but a little pricey. Had a coupon for this and thought i\"ll try it. The food was distasteful. Bland NO wow factory any where. After tasting for the week end went on line Monday and canceled. got an email confirmation. but received a email after hour on Thursday that another coarse of  foul food was heading my way.chat with customer service and they are not willing to work with you. Save your money. sAVE YOUR TASTE BUDS."}
{"text":"\"Healthy food for lazy people\" is the way I like to describe this service for friends.  Freshly gets 5 stars from me for being super convenient, tasty (I recommend sticking with mostly chicken dishes which have all been excellent), affordable, and great customer service.  I had a small issue with one order and after jumping on customer service chat they resolved quickly and above my expectations.  I have been a happy customer for about 12 weeks now and don't see me looking elsewhere anytime soon.  Thank you Freshly!"}
{"text":"The food is ok & I for the most enjoy the meals, but the customer service leaves much to be desired and most recently, completely awful! - my account was charged 3 times because it said it was declined but my bank saw three times that it was approved and therefore money wasn't available to pay a bill that was due to another vendor because freshly took money that wasn't theirs and held it and never contacted me about it. I've been a long time customer I am completely livid about this whole situation the way that it was handled, the way that it was unprofessionally managed, the way that I wouldn't be reimbursed, and I am no more going to be a customer of theirs nor am I ever going to refer anybody to them ever again because of how I was treated. This is unacceptable customer service!! I am completely done with freshly and I hate the fact of how I've been treated!! Anybody want to contact me to discuss this further feel free to do so but until then, these guys have a lot to learn about customer service and how to treat others. I have nothing more to say."}
{"text":"They just lowered prices to $8.99/meal!  I'm on my 7th week with Freshly and love it so much that I increased to 12 meals a week and eat it 2 times day on average.   Taste amazing, surprisingly filling  I'm not interested in cooking so it actually saves me money and time not going going out to eat or ordering delivery.  No cooking, dishes or messes to clean up.  They have great meal options for those counting calories and macros and it's all made with good fresh ingredients.  Their variety is excellent and I'm yet to eat one of their meals that I disliked."}
{"text":"I'm still amazed about how how 'un-user friendly' their ordering system is. It is sketchy at best. The entire premise of this company is eaSe and online ordering. When ordering online, I want a cart to go to that clearly has the items WITH THE SUMMARY OF PRICE.  These meals are a big part investment for me. They don't even have an app yet. The food however is pretty good but the hassle has not been worth it. It just feels deceitful."}
{"text":"This is a subscription service. That charges you well before anything is made or shipped. I did not like this at all. (the forced subscription) I have canceled and will not return. Its ok food, barley above a frozen dinner at walmart. And its 4x the price. If they let you order when you like, and not force you into a subscription it might be ok and I would consider continuing. But, as it stands. I am done with this service, I rather cook and use one of the other ones that send you fresh ingredients instead of something that was cooked no sooner than 2 days before you receive it...... Nothing fresh about that whatsoever......"}
{"text":"This sounded like a great concept when I signed up through the targeted advertising on Facebook and I thought the food came well packaged. (They do claim everything is recycled/ recyclable, but I remain a little skeptical of the plastic ice packs!)  Anyhow It's not until I saw the individual meals in little frozen food plastic containers did the realization hit me that if you're gonna poke a plastic film, and microwave food placed in a plastic container it won't really be \"freshly\". Besides, this food was prepared at least 2 days before it got to me and  6 dinners would expire before 6 days were up, so unless I ate more than one dinner a day I'd be throwing away at least 2 meals.  I still gave it a shot and ate 3 of the 6 meals and while they all smelt very good they did taste like TV dinners.   Sadly, A better alternative = Lean Cuisine!"}
{"text":"I have been ordering freshly for a few months. Meals usually had good portion servings, decent taste and reasonably priced. However, off late there were too many wrong orders been sent. The excuse always given was that they ran out of ingredients. This is when I placed my orders in time and a week in advance. There was no communication or emails in advance to let me know about it. I would only know about the wrong orders once I received my meals!  Sometimes, the wrong orders were refunded for but other times had to contact the suppport for refund. I cancelled my subscription for good when the wrong orders became frequent. I would rather have the right meals than get refunds."}
{"text":"I did the promo from facebook because it was a really great price. My family and I did enjoy the food, my only hang ups are:  The delivery: the only delivery option I had was Thursday or Friday. I wanted these for dinner after busy work days -- not on the weekend when I have time to cook or go out! It ended up putting a bit of stress on ME to make sure they got eaten before they expired (on Monday).   The Price: Promo price was A+ very good. The regular price? Not so much. $10+ dollars a meal? I can make food at home for much cheaper and I just can't justify spending this much on a glorified tv dinner, even if it tastes so much better than it's cheaper alternatives. I really tried to justify the expense, but at the end of the day, it's just not going to work with my lifestyle. If it ever dropped down to the $7-8 per meal and became available for delivery on Monday's I will come back happily. They would make a great work lunch for me if that ever occurred."}
{"text":"They say \"all natural\" on their site but when I contacted them to ask if they have GMOs in their food or if there are antibiotics in their meat, they said yes. GMO stands for genetically modified organism and antibiotics are man made chemicals. There's nothing \"natural\" about either of these.  This company is pretending to be something they aren't and are misleading the public into thinking there's nothing bad in their food.  It's a shame because their food looks good."}
{"text":"The breakfast options are the same thing they microwave and serve at a Hampton Inn. Basically a $1.20 omelette from Sysco marked up and shipped overnight. Neither of us could finish.  The rest of the meals are hit or miss. Most have missed. As many others have mentioned, I get a delivery on Saturday and the food expires Wednesday. I like to cook on weekends so that leaves little time to eat the mediocre TV dinners. And for the person reviewing that said, \"It's not even frozen so how is it a TV dinner?\": You're just being silly.   I wouldn't recommend Freshly."}
{"text":"UPDATE. Freshly since has accommodated to my needs so I figure my review does need an update they promised they are working to fix the issues with the soggy water meals I have recently reviewed. They also have put value in their customers and I am i impressed with the customer service. Hopefully in the future when the product improves I will try freshly again to see what they have to offer."}
{"text":"The packaging was well done. The dry ice froze some of the food. Other meal service companies that provide a better product. The  zucchini pasta was good. Turkey meatballs were salty. Hoping they step up the food quality. All and all below average."}
{"text":"Disclaimer: my family and I are recreational eaters, so we've tried just about everything on earth.  We ordered a 6-meal pack with the following to get a taste of the full spectrum of dish types: --Peppercorn Steak --Chicken Parmesan --Sausage & Green Chile Frittata --Quinoa Porridge --Chicken with Asparagus Risotto --Paleo Beef Chili  PROS: --Beautiful website that's easy to manage without help --Convenient and reliable shipping --Stupid-proof reheating instructions --Nice packaging/labeling  CONS: --Of that list the only one we actually enjoyed was the sausage and green chile frittata.  Every other dish ranged from disgusting to mediocre. --There is so much packing material.  Even though it's recyclable I can't help but feel it's a huge waste of money that could be put towards making the food better. --Spices were nowhere near balanced.      *For the love of Pete, add some salt to these recipes    *The paleo chili is so thick and over-spiced you could have cut it in half with water and it would still have been a pretty powerful stew.      *The other dishes just had no flavor whatsoever. --Everything was way overcooked.    *Chicken grill marks had an excessively burnt/carbon taste that destroyed the whole dish    *All the chicken dishes were dry/stringy    *All the proteins were huge slabs and were a pain to cut while in the tray    *Every rice and pasta dish was just a hair away from turning into mush    *Vegetables were flavorless and overcooked/mushy  VERDICT:  Don't be fooled by the gorgeous packaging and website.  The food (which is really the only thing that matters in the end) is unacceptable and is not worth the wait or expense.  I'd rather double up on LeanCuisines at my local grocer, it would taste better and be cheaper and I get gas points.  Sorry Freshly :("}
{"text":"I was recently given a few of these meals from my sister and they tasted delicious!!! Easy, convenient and filling! However, I was disappointed to find out my Denver omelette was worse than having a Big Mac.    I think, personally, this would be great for one or two emergency meals a week."}
{"text":"Great food for meal delivery. Everything is tasty and their carbon print is low. Love that you can recycle everything."}
{"text":"I am a big Freshly fan. Zero prep, just throw it in the microwave. Healthy, lower calorie options available and saves me from cooking. If you want $20 bucks off, here is a referral  https://refer.freshly.com/s/Chelsie37"}
{"text":"so I read a bunch of the reviews before trying freshly out, and did read a couple that scared me a bit about getting sick from the food. but, I decided to try it anyway (maybe it was a fluke). lo and behold, I received my first box last night. I was a little nervous of the idea of shipping a box of cooked meals overnight. when I received the food, it felt somewhat like a cold room temperature. I had the chicken risotto first. after I finished the meal, I did start to have a slight allergic reaction (sometimes food that's processed with soy and corn trigger a skin allergy where I get itchy). that happened with my meal last night. however, the worst part was this morning - I literally had pretty terrible diarrhea right when I got to work at 8:30...and I'm 99% sure it was attributed to the freshly meal I had. maybe it was an allergic reaction to the food, or maybe it was a cooked meal being shipped overnight in less than ideal conditions, but whatever it was, I'm not taking the risk to have another. the good thing is that freshly is refunding me the cost of the meals, but it is rather disappointing since I was hoping this could be a good meal service to use."}
{"text":"Freshly meals are meant for the microwave.  So they are microwave dinners you are ordering.  It does seem the ingredients are all for the most part paleo accepted so thats a great thing.  Didn't realize it was a subscription service and they charged my card without warning for the next meals of shipments.  When I asked to cancel the meals and receive a refund, they refused.  Not cool."}
{"text":"This is the worst home meal service I have tried! I used a promo code and received 6 meals for $36. Even that is too high of a price for this food. I actually threw away the last few meals because the first ones were so inedible.  If I want a microwave meal, I am better off sticking to the grocery store!"}
{"text":"I tried the promotion for my first order. It was great and convenient and quick. I was really busy the week I got these so it was perfect, it saved a lot of time.   However, I will probably unsubscribe because 10 dollars for a microwave meal is too much. If it was 7 bucks I would stay probably all year."}
{"text":"I can barely give this business a 1 star. I was attempting to send my 85 year old grandmother a birthday present and my experience was horrendous to say the least. I put in the correct zip code and was told that it would be delivered on the 23rd. My grandmother said she never got it though. I called the company and spoke to customer service to ask what happened and they read to me the incorrect zip code saying I input it wrong. I then found my confirmation email with the correct zip code I gave. I then asked if I could change my zip code and they said they don't deliver to that one. My question is why didn't they tell me that when I put in the zip code? Overall my grandmother and I were terribly displeased with the experience."}
{"text":"I have been ordering meals for about six months on and off. The meals taste fresh just not a ton of flavor. So you may need to add some salt. Not bad meals though. Don't agree with the 1 or 2 star ratings. It's average to a little above average and easy and convenient."}
{"text":"I'm a very active person; I've been bodybuilding for ~8 years now and one of my biggest struggles is maintaining a clean, healthy diet while also getting enough calories.  I did a BUNCH of research on the competition; Fitzee, Sunfare, Factor 75 and a few others. The biggest issue I had was the shipping cost. I finally was about to give up then I finally just decided to google 'meal preparation service' and to my surprise Freshly popped right up, located in Scottsdale, AZ. I live in Phoenix, AZ so this was convenient! (shipping is very cheap or even free being in the same state)  I've been with them only two weeks and I'm beyond satisfied. The packaging is very well thought out. I am on the 12 meals a week plan and it come in a large box with several dry ice packets. Also knowing that the item is basically shipped/received a day later ensures that the food is fresh.  Now the food-- the biggest thing for me was quality and they say that their food is high quality, no processed ingredients or GMO, etc. What impressed me most was how good the food actually is! While they basically look like TV dinners, the quality is incredibly high; the vegetables are fresh and delicious and the food is good-- you can tell these are chef prepared and not mass produced. I can't say I've had better 'pre-prepared' food before. They are similar to Trader Joes 'quick meals,' but much better quality and likely healthier. For instance, I'm picky about pork chops, but am REALLY impressed with the quality of the pork chops w/ Mustard Sauce. The fact that you can get a nice tender pork chop from a refrigerated meal that you throw in the microwave shows they know what they're doing.  Being someone that tracks all food intake, it's very easy to go online and look up the nutritional value and catalog it; I know EXACTLY how much carbohydrates/protein/calories/fat I'm getting a day so losing weight as never been easier! (However one of my few complaints-- they don't have the nutrition information 'on' the package, you have to go online and look it up, sort of a bizarre inconvenience)   The price is fair; $129 for 12 meals which comes out to $10.75 a meal-- while this is a bit steep, certainly more than what it would cost to prepare my own food, it's a luxury I'm willing to pay for, not to mention it eliminates virtually all need to go shopping. The price is also comparable if I were to eat out for lunch and dinner every day. I was probably spending $100 a week on food regardless and this takes away ALL that work. I have a healthy lunch/dinner 6 days a week without lifting a finger! Freshly was also cheaper than any competitor I found and considering they ship out of the same state it was a no-brainer.  The ONLY other complaint is it doesn't seem like they vary their menu often. (mind you I've only been with them 2 weeks, maybe they switch it up every month) I also don't like mushrooms which eliminates about 4 or 5 dishes, so something to keep in mind if you're a picky eater like me. I however don't mind having the same 4-5 dishes a week, especially when they are good!"}
{"text":"We decided to try Freshly after testing Blue Apron. It's turns out that we're too lazy and/or busy to actually cook our food. So I was hoping that fully cooked delivery meals would save us both time and money.  Freshly is super convenient. The food shows up once a week. It's packed in a really nice, insulated box with recyclable insulation that can survive a couple hours on the porch in Phoenix heat. The price per meal is super affordable. Cool beans.  BUT the food just doesn't taste that good  The meals are loaded with sodium, and, somehow, they still taste like nothing. Certain dishes are better than others (we found that the chicken dishes were the best meat dishes; all of the steak meals came out like rubber), but overall I just can't live my life eating this stuff. It's not the time-saving solution I was hoping for."}
{"text":"Freshly is amazing. Great price, value, delicious food and choices!!!! Super easy and for me that and great taste is what I am looking for!"}
{"text":"I have been subscribing to Freshly for a couple of months. I have not tried any of the breakfast because I really don't like to spend dollars at breakfast every day and I'm very basic or over the top on breakfast. My big concern was lunch. I get a per diem every day for lunch. So it was very easy to go out everyday for an hour lunch break. Spend $10 or more plus tip or think your saving money on fast food. My concern was I noticed a huge Spike in my blood sugars because I test them 4 time a day.   I started with the 4 meals per week and it was delivered on time and packaged very professional. Also was included was a starters kit to let me know everything is recyclable and if your into saving our environment that's another topic. I enjoyed the reading material and still keep it around if I can get anyone else interested because you can earn free meals if you do. The meals were fine only a couple I keep in rotation for every other week. You don't want to eat the same meal over and over like every one does from time to time. And I have skipped a week Thanksgiving time. That's a big plus you can schedule when you want.  Deliveries  I prefer to have Wednesday but it you decide I think every one would love Monday but its because of logistics of course. Maybe some day it will happen. But for this I'm ok with being my delivery day. I also like Saturday delivery but during football season I was never home so. The reason I make this point if you look at when your meal arrive look for the  USE BY DATE. Very important because you want to make sure you eat that meal before that date. It's NOT like it will go BAD and I have eaten more than a few meals before the USE BY DATE. Why I make this point because you want to eat it for the best taste and fresh don't be lazy and pick a couple of days after like me. I think you have 5 maybe 4 days after the deliver date before the best by date kicks in. And you can freeze it if you have to. But what's the point in that???  Meals I like that they have changed from the standard 2 minutes and Done. Your packaging tells you if you want to microwave the in package or put your meal on a plate. And now that changes the old standard 2 minutes and done. Every meal is different on cook time and I'm fine with that. I'm a big fan of this it just goes to show you they are always changing or looking for better tasting meals. I always try the new menu choice when it changes only one was a disaster but hey I tried it. I would write it down but I think it will go into the vault soon as a failure recipe. My advice is to try everything in rotation once but as I say that there was couple I stayed away from and it's because it's something a little to unique for my taste buds.    FYI My blood sugars are back to normal after my standard 2 hours and check. And I think that is wonderful. Happy Eating"}
{"text":"I so wanted this to work. It is so convenient and gluten free. The sign up and delivery were great.  The only problem is disposing of the large amount of special packaging.    My husband and I like basic healthy American food, but these dishes were on par with frozen dinners that are actually less expensive. The vegetables always reminded us of the canned veggies we had as children. The other problem is the extremely limited choices.  It really doesn't live up to the Fresh name. I really wish it had!"}
{"text":"Just got my order that was half priced, $30 for 6 meals. I think that is high enough and would never pay $10 per meal. Especially after tasting them. Tried the pork sausage with pasta and peppers. It looked impressive but was very bland and the sausage dry. Like I've never had such a dry sausage.  The pasta was gluten free, all the meals are, and these were made of red lentils I believe. Tasted like mush, didn't eat more than a couple. Red, green and yellow bell peppers were the best part. Had sun dried tomatoes and I didn't know that until I ate some. Don't like sun dried tomatoes at all, disappointed I didn't know they were in there. Clearly on the inredient list but I missed it.  Tuscan chicken soup was hearty, bland and bland. Not sure why there was no flavor but I was disappointed. Plus there are over 700 calories so this was a downer. Still have 4 more meals to try, not hopeful about the taste.  Forgot to take pictures of the soup. Whoops. Food arrived as expected with a tracking number. Dry ice and a few ice packs made the food pretty frozen. Not just a light frost but solidish. At least it wasn't spoiled but the website says it's not made to be frozen."}
{"text":"I wish I would have tried Freshly earlier! I am a first time mom of a 6 month old little boy. I returned back to work full time about a month ago and Freshly has been a life saver!  I don't have the energy to cook at all. When I first started back to work I would just stop and get fast food or something quick like junky snacks to keep me going throughout the day but that was not helping get the baby weight off!! Now I can just pop one of these into the microwave and I am good to go.They're packaged nicely and are easy to take to work for lunch too.  I have only tried the entrees and not the breakfast but so far I've really liked the majority of what I've tried. The steak peppercorn is my favorite.  Some of the meals are higher in fat but it's not excessive and if you track correctly you can lose weight with these. I've had at least 1 meal a day and while using myfitnesspal I've been within my calorie/fat/sodium/protein goals A lot of the meals are lower in sugar and are gluten free too.   Overall, the meals I've had feel hearty and healthy and I am very happy! I am now doing 12 meals a week for $108/week or $9/meal. For what you get I think it's great, especially being in the bay area. I can't go out and get a meal like this for that price. The only reason for 4 stars is because the plastic film on the tray is hard to peel off and I think there could be some more food options to choose from each week."}
{"text":"Freshly has been a total lifesaver for me. I work full time and go to school full time so I barely have time to breath. I hated meal prepping because it was so time consuming and I would end up eating the same boring food everyday. How much grilled chicken and salad can you eat? I was so disgusted with how boring my diet had become and I would end up just caving and buying fast food and other unhealthy crap. Also, I hated spending half my day off just cooking chicken breast and chopping vegetables. My day off is the only chance I have to basically sleep and relax. I signed up for Freshly because the meals looked good and they are mostly pretty healthy. I have had my subscription for about a month now and I have not had any meals that I didn't like. It is convenient because I bring 2 of them to work each day. One for lunch and then I eat one for dinner right before school. My only option before was hitting up the school cafeteria and getting a burger and fries.  This service has been amazing and I don't think I could survive without Freshly anymore. I don't have to cook, grocery shop or clean dishes anymore. I can just eat healthy meals that taste good without thinking about it anymore. This gives me more time to focus on school instead of worrying about what I am going to eat for lunch the next week. The meals are quite filling because they are pretty generous with the protein portion which I appreciate because I am a big guy so I need a hefty meal to feel satisfied. The price is a little bit high, but the trade off is that I don't go out to eat anymore since I don't need to. I signed up for the 12 meals a week plan so I have my lunch and dinner for the whole week.  My only suggestion to Freshly would be to find a way to reduce the price a little bit. I think if you could do 12 meals for $99.99 it would be better and also if they did healthy little desserts for like $10 extra a week or something that would be cool. I'm thinking like healthy protein balls or chia seed puddings and stuff. Also, a side note, the ancho turkey chili is AMAZING. Best chili I've ever freaking had!  It is sad about the negative reviews people post about the subscription model. You guys are not very smart if you didn't read and understand that its a weekly plan. They send you email reminders to pick your meals or skip the week if you need to. You have to understand they have a business to run and have to appropriately allocate labor and product to be prepared so they have no choice but to have a deadline for each week's meals. If you are a busy college student like me and are finding yourself hitting the drive-thru too often then I highly recommend Freshly. I love these guys and I hope they never get rid of that Turkey Chili. And no, I'm not being paid to post this review (I wish I was), I just feel that this service has benefited me tremendously and am so happy I discovered it."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been receiving Freshly deliveries for about 9 months. We LOVE it. It's great food - with a nice variety of menu items. It's a subscription plan that is just so easy to pause for the weeks we are away. In the good news department I recently hired a nutritionist as I was looking to lose weight and was curious what she'd have to say about Freshly. She wasn't familiar with their foods but after she checked out the nutrition contents she came back with a ringing endorsement. Tastes great and healthy too. Nice combination.  It's like having my own restaurant quality meals delivered right to my home."}
{"text":"I'm updating my review and adding a star mainly for excellent customer service which I really appreciate.  The other reason for the star is that since my initial review I did have one meal that I liked a lot and that was the baked vegetable penne.  I'm looking forward to trying the dishes that are arriving soon and will update further on those taste-wise.  I want to add that I have a lot of dietary restrictions which make my choices on Freshly quite limited.  To those with less restrictions, there are many more meals to try and my guess is a higher chance of finding meals to fit your tastes!"}
{"text":"Started out with the Flex 6 and recently upgraded to Flex 9 because the food portions are just right. Seriously, the hardest part about eating healthy is not really the cost, it's getting the portion size just right and I have to say that after eating a Freshly meal, I'm never hungry. I love the different choices of healthy carbs, and the food doesn't taste too salty or spicy, but just right. I really like the steak with green beans, and am starting to experiment with different things I wish they would add an easy option to upgrade; as it stands, I had to cancel my Flex 6 and the add the Flex 9, but there should be something to click on when you want to upgrade to make it easy."}
{"text":"Food is delicious. My favorites are the buffalo chicken and cauliflower mash, cod cakes, and turkey chili. I do wish you could customize meals because the cod cakes are amazing but the potatoes don't cook well in the microwave.  Packaging is all recyclable which is great.  I didn't realize how much packaging there would be though (insulation and 2-3 big ice packs that are recyclable). Meals run at about $10/meal which is more expensive than cooking at home but cheaper than eating out. Food is low calories and delicious, but does have a high sodium content.   You have the option to microwave your food in a plate or in the tray it comes in and tastes like a fresh cooked meal!  Breakfast is not worth it outside of the berry porridge.    Best food delivery system I've ever used."}
{"text":"I have been subscribing for only 2 weeks (6/$60). But the meals are good enough. It is a bit expensive, but it is healthy (gluten free, low carb, high protein, high fiber, etc.) and very fast (around 3 minutes). Most importantly, some of the meal actually taste really good, while others are decent - way better than fast food.  I would actually give it something like 4.5 stars because of the cost, but seeing how it has really low reputation undeservedly, I thought 5 is appropriate."}
{"text":"1) Food was SUBPAR, mushy, and lacking flavor. Did not stay fresh by the 3rd day. Don't trust that expiration date.  2) I am a recycling advocate but the recycling process for this packaging was the biggest pain in my arse.   3) Customer Service thumbs down. Missed the skip deadline by just a few hours, wrote them right away (same day of deadline) and they told me they couldn't help me. Right! Somehow I doubt they were cooking my meals between when I wrote them and when they responded. It's clear my food hadn't been prepared yet or shipped. Money-grubbing. No sense of accommodation. Cancelled immediately afterward.  Would not recommend this service.  I'm sure they'll respond to this justifying their practice as they have with all the other reviews -- Your copied and pasted response is not going to change my mind about my experience."}
{"text":"We ordered the trial of 6 meals for $39, which included the following:  - Burgandy glazed steak with Brussel Sprouts & Sweet Potato cakes This was a tough, well-done cut of steak that had little flavor; Brussel Sprouts  were fair but the Sweet Potato Cakes were dried out and tough  Penny Bolognese - Tasty pasta with a meat sauce that was well received.   Grilled Flat Iron Steak with Potato Hash & Creamed Spinach A tasteless cut of tough meat with diced potatoes; the creamed spinach was  fair at best.  Southwest chicken Bowl Overly spicy and hot; not great for Southerner's taste buds. Chicken was a tad dry   We discarded the following:  Roasted Balsamic Chicken With Smashed Red Potatoes  Baked Penne Marinara with Sauteed Zucchini and Spinach  I received an email that we were scheduled a number of meals we did not order; I was informed that this is a subscription service and you would automatically receive meals. This was after I had responded to suspend the meals. I subsequently canceled the subscription.  Some meals contained sodium content up to 900+ mg. Those of us on a sodium restricted diet have to pay close attention to the list of ingredients.  We were excited to see a service like this advertised but will rely on locally prepared known quality in the future.Your review helps others learn about great local businesses.  Please don't review this business if you received a freebie for writing this review, or if you're connected in any way to the owner or employees."}
{"text":"God send! I'm definitely health conscious and don't have time to cook. Price point is good, taste is good and most of all it's FRESH AND THE FOOD HAS PHENOMENAL MACRONUTRIENTS!"}
{"text":"Loved all the dinner choices we made. The food was fresh, well seasoned, lots of variety. It was wonderful to have 4 dinners and 1 lunch that I didn't have to make. Only drawback is that I used a Living Social coupon and only bought one. The $99 is a little high for us. However if I can find any coupon offer, I will jump on it."}
{"text":"Definitely would not recommend if you are trying to lose weight, want to eat clean, care about the environment, or don't like feeling bloated. Decided to give Freshly a try after receiving countless emails about a discounted rate with a subscription. The price point was appealing, and since I knew the upcoming weekends would be busy (when I normally meal prep), I thought I would finally give it a try. I signed up for the flex12 meal plan, which included 12 meals per week. This would be enough for my husband and I to go through. We picked out a variety of meals (mostly chicken), and eagerly awaited our first delivery. My first meal, Morrocan Chicken was pretty good, however the plastic film covering the container is incredibly difficult to peel back. The meal had a good amount of flavor, left me full, but also left me incredibly bloated. The next few days I tried out a few more meals including: Steak Peppercorn (not a fan), Chicken Risotto (Disgustingly fatty), Chicken Fajita (probably my favorite) and Southwest Chicken Bowl (this was okay, but way too filling for me).   The portion sized are not for everyone. As a young woman who wants to maintain my weight, the macros don't fit. The majority of the meals have over 25g Fat and over 40g Carbs. Plus the sodium is comparable to eating Fast food. I felt bloated every day I ate one of these meals.  For what it claims to be - fresh, healthy,  and convenient, I feel slightly misled. Is does not taste fresh; just look at all of the random ingredients on the back. It is not \"healthy\" to most peoples standards, unless you want to eat something that sounds healthy but the macro nutrients are comparable to eating fast food. It is somewhat convenient but sacrifices the environment with the amount of packaging used to deliver and store the meals.   I would only recommend if you are in DESPERATE need of food and use the coupon."}
{"text":"Most of the meals are delicious. I like not having to do any prep, instead just microwaving them. They're healthy and are a good portion size."}
{"text":"I just ordered 12 meals, as my chef is on vacation in a week. So, I will let you know if I like the food soon."}
{"text":"I am very disappointed with these meals and feel like it doesn't live up at all to its hype. I've tried quite a few meal subscription plans and opted to try Freshly to save time without suffering the quality of taste... but found that the food was super bland and comparable to cafeteria food. For example, we tried the Steak Peppercorn with \"Sautéed\" Carrots and Green Beans... and the steak came out dry and well-done, while the veggies tasted like it came out of a can (very soggy in texture and no salt, pepper or flavoring at all).   I had high hopes for Freshly and don't believe it's worth the price. The so-called \"chef-cooked\" meals are just glorified TV dinners."}
{"text":"I will have to concur with most of the latest reviews.  Freshly is very deceiving when you think your trying out their meal service you are actually signing up for a SUBSCRIPTION.  I ended up with 6 glorified TV dinners. After I tried them there was no way I would have ordered any of them again.  When I got a email saying that my NEXT delivery was a WEEK later (with the exact same food that I didn't like the week prior) I informed them that I was out if town for work and they wouldn't budge.  They wouldn't postpone, cancel or even change the horrible selections to something even more horrible.  Now I will have 6 glorified TV dinners rotting in my front door while I'm away.  I wanted to cancel the order but they gave me some story about it being sent to production.  How can it be fresh it you cook 3 days prior to shipping me?  I will steer everyone I know away from Freshly.  Bad customer service!!!!"}
{"text":"Terms and conditions are confusing, even after I reviewed them to determine how I got duped.  I responded to a Face Book ad the try their service out for half what they normally charge for 6 meals, so I agreed to do this.  Turns out that it is NOT just a trial program, although the ad on FB implied that that was the offer, it is a service program that you sign up for.  So they billed me for the second week of the delivery service even BEFORE the first weeks meal was delivered. But did not send me that receipt until AFTER they had billed, and would not let me recoup as, they claim, the food has already been ordered and the charge had already gone onto my credit card.    So maybe this is good for people who don't want to think about cooking or the quality of their food, but the food we tried was marginal at best."}
{"text":"I found a coupon online and tried out their service about two years ago I think. I liked the simplicity of FRESH food without having to cook it myself. I love to cook but I get busy and fast food is so unhealthy all the time so I wanted to try something different. These dishes are delicious and easy to prepare and I take them to work for lunch and use them for dinners. I wish they would let us choose the main course and sides as I loved their meatloaf meal until they substituted the mashed potatoes for cauliflower. Please give us more options and the freedom to assemble the meat and sides. I usually order every few months and it is easy to skip weeks at a time or you can simply cancel your orders altogether. If the delivery has a problem the staff is very responsive to emails and they make it right."}
{"text":"The food is okay, not bad. Reminds me of a good tv dinner. My review may be biased as I just ended a subscription with an awesome meal prep service. I won't name them since that would be so rude lol. They were about two times the amount of freshly, but I definitely see why. You get what you pay for. I am looking for a healthy, fresh, flavorful meal plan...I didn't find it here."}
{"text":"This is the most \"meh\" I've felt about food in a very long time. I tried my subscription for the first time today and will be cancelling after my experience thus far. I started with the porridge for breakfast. Although I really loved the texture, the flavor was very blan. I didn't even eat 1/2 of it because it was just that boring. My taste buds were lulled to sleep and went limp. I broke off a corner of chocolate muffin and was disappointed but not discouraged. The grainy texture was edible, but I didn't enjoy the flavor so the muffin went into the trash with the majority of the boring porridge. I was excited give my taste buds a treat and tried the buffalo chicken for lunch. Once again I am underwhelmed with the taste. The chicken tastes like it is processed and it's appearance looks processed as well (see photo.) The mashed cauliflower has decent flavor but should have a more \"whipped\" and less dense consistency.  I promise I'm not a flavor snob. I also am quite certain my taste buds aren't asking for too much! Outside of the easy heating instructions and ease of using the Freshly app for ordering, this venture has been a complete bust. Guess I'll hit the vending machine for something to eat for lunch as I won't be finishing my 2nd Freshly meal of the day (sad face).  **Update 5/2/18. The app is very user friendly and the customer service agents are very competent. I had no problems cancelling my subscription and received a very welcome message regarding my Yelp review. Kudos to the customer service team. If only the recipes were as great!"}
{"text":"I cancelled my first subscription a while back because I was annoyed by the packaging and the recipes were lacking flavour sometimes. Plus I got bored.   They had a promotion to start a new subscription at the discount, so I decided to give it a try, plus I noticed that I gained weight again. Got my first box and I decided to review this service again.   1. Packaging is now recyclable. Which makes it so much easier to dispose of!  2. Spices are on point. Everything tastes good. Yes, some veggies are not that good after microwaving them, but I know which ones and no longer order them. 3. Back to portion control.  4. Eating healthy is easy again.   Thank you for having me back!"}
{"text":"Last Chance Freshly. I wish I could tell you more about what the meals taste like, but I have not been getting them. The service might be great if you need no intervention from customer support. I guess. idk. They are nice, but so could not resolve a simple issue. I started my freshly order when I moved to new state-Ga. I made a simple request to see if my meals could be delivered for the upcoming week to my previous state of residence- TX- since I had to go back to move more items last minute notice. I said if they couldn't no biggie. Someone at my new home could freeze them or eat them for me. I told them it was just for that one week, all other meals to the original address as normal. They stated they couldn't change it in that short of notice. No problem. I updated my address for the following week back to my original home address as they advised, the same time I updated my meals. The meals went to Texas anyway?? I was told I updated it one location instead off another. There is only one location to update it (using a mobile  device-tablet) and when you do, it asks if you want this change for this order or all upcoming. Even if I didn't select to change the address back for all upcoming orders, it should have changed for that week. I did all this in response to the email they send that says you have so many hours/days to update the following weeks order. And I did it well before the deadline. So if nothing else, that week's order should have been going where I corrected it to go. Furthermore, if you say you can't adjust the address, WHY is the address adjusted??  I said if it can't be done for that week, its fine, just keep it. I'm baffled. All this on top of the fact that they kept emailing saying the meals weren't gonna be able to be delivered in time, but not to worry because the meals can last two days on the truck and 12 hrs outside. That means its not on a refrigerated truck. Gee, I feel so much better in knowing. Thanks. I'm also trying Christophe's in Atlanta for the first time this week. If the meals are better and actually come with minimal incident I'm telling all my friends I recommended to you this past week to ditch freshly for Christophe's. Better menu anyway. And they did offered  a refund. But, I don't want a refund. I want to eat.  *Extremely Aggravated and Hangry*"}
{"text":"I just started using freshly for the past two weeks...both orders arrived on time and were nicely packed and kept cold. Every meal I have tried has been delicious. The meals are simple and tasty, and even healthy! I calculated that I would spend just as much money at the grocery store as I would with freshly except I don't have to cook or have a bunch of items spoil before I can use them. Very happy! I truly don't understand why they have any negative reviews"}
{"text":"Excellent Customer Service.  Delicious gourmet food. All fresh with great ingredients. To answer to people complaining about: Not Enough Rosemary. For me personally, it is more than I would like of rosemary, but I would never bash a chef for it. Everyone's perception of spices is different. To the person who complained about food going bad in 5 days. Maybe you should stick to Campbell. It lasts for 5 years. To people who complain about portion size: this is what a portion should be. It is not a restaurant portion you plan on taking a to-go box after you finish your meal. We are too spoiled to appreciate good things these days."}
{"text":"I'm extremely conscious of keeping refined sugar out of my meals, and minimizing dairy and gluten as best as I can. I watch sodium levels and review the protein and healthy fat levels. Overall, I'm very pleased with Freshly's nutritional values. I'm also enjoying very tasty and healthy meals, not to mention that I just plain feel better. The full nutritional and balanced ingredients make a difference. The bonus is having more time and energy to focus on what matters. Also, I don't make a lot of money, so my food budget is tight, a challenge for a health-conscious eater. But, I've crunched the numbers, and Freshly is worth it. You are free to use my code to try it out: friend6392x8ba60c6850366b   They let you skip weeks or stop at anytime."}
{"text":"Freshly food was so inedible not even my dog would eat it! My four meals arrived and the protein and sides are not kept separated so it gets all jumbled together in shipping and looks like upchuck when you open it. The food all had a weird tainted taste and something gave me diarrhea. Stay far, far away from Freshly."}
{"text":"My customer experience was super. Easy to order, beautiful website, clear communication. I LOVE that they use low-carb, high-quality ingredients. The company practices social and environmental responsibility which is awesome. And you can't beat the convenience; I'm a single parent with a demanding full-time job, so I like the idea of my fridge being stocked with healthy, ready-made meals.   The taste, however, is inconsistent. There were some wonderful dishes (flat iron steak and maple quinoa porridge) and some not-so-great dishes (chicken rustica and garlic/herb shrimp). I don't have a particularly discerning palate; I'll eat almost anything. I just felt that there was a lack of flavor and some weird texture issues in about 50% of the meals.   Compared to any other microwave meal, the taste is far superior.  Compared to the competition (Blue Apron in this case), the quality is inferior. I liked everything I ever ordered from Blue Apron, but they ship raw ingredients that you have to prepare by hand, which is a pain. Freshly ships meals in easy-to-heat containers that take 2 minutes to prepare (plus an extra minute or so to get the plastic wrap off, that stuff CLINGS!).  At $10 per very small portion, I'm on the fence about whether I see value for the cost. I recognize that you don't have to re-order what you don't like, but I want to know that I can count on the food I'm purchasing to be consistently tasty. I'll probably order one more round then decide if it's worth continuing.  I'd recommend that Freshly continue improving and expanding on its recipes, and consider offering larger portion sizes for families. Clearly they listen to customer feedback, and I'm sure they'll take mine into account as they keep optimizing the customer experience."}
{"text":"This is a long one...  I know that a referral and a good review is the best way to thank someone in the customer service industry. I know how much a good review means, especially after being threatened at work by the same lady multiple times that I HAD to give her a refund for the mistake she ordered on her sandwich or she would just \"write a terrible review\" about us.  I'd heard about Freshly for months on Michael Rosenbaum's podcast, and when I finally landed a job that paid more money I was really excited to try it. Well, I tried it and I LOVE IT (I'm literally eating their \"Thanksgiving Turkey with Quinoa Stuffing\" as I write this. Okay, now to the part that compelled me to refer Freshly to you...  After work today, I realized my payment for this week's meals didn't go through. I checked my bank account. No wonder, rent drained it. I thought I'd made enough in tips today to pay it but it was a slow day and I was a few bucks short. So I got onto Freshly live chat to see if maybe I could push the delivery date back a few days or split the payment onto two cards (p.s. I know it sounds like this must be a giant payment but it was only $59. My rent is just a lot and I really didn't make great tips today.). Live chat responded immediately with a lovely human being ready to help. The best part was that this chat was totally unscripted unlike other live chats.  While we were trying to figure out options for how to make the delivery work for me this week, I explained how much I was enjoying Freshly: How much I love the food; how I love not having to cook or swing by McDonalds when I get home so late from work that it's the only thing open; how much I love not spending up to $100 a week on crap fast food and groceries that I'm not even eating; how much I love that the food isn't even frozen, I just have to keep it in my fridge and heat it up for a couple minutes in the microwave; how much I love that none of their food has gluten, and you can let them know your dietary preferences; etc, etc, etc.  We talked about how I was embarrassed that I couldn't afford it after rent and a bad day at work. The lady (who I found out later was also named Jamie!!!) was awesome! She said she felt like I was describing her life and not to be embarrassed about rent. After chatting about this stuff for a bit, she told me she had great news! She was able to get me an in-store credit for this week's food. Completely on the house, just because I loved Freshly so much and they want me to continue having the best experience possible with them. I pretty much cried with gratitude..  I want Freshly to know how much it meant to me that they cared enough about me as a customer to help me out this week. I want them to know how big of a difference it makes to my bank account by getting that in-store credit for the week. It was the best customer service experience of my life. Imagine a world where all companies rewarded your love of their product instead of giving you free stuff because they are afraid you'll leave a bad yelp review. THANK YOU, Jamie, and THANK YOU, Freshly for your incredible food, service, and genuine kindness and generosity.  Give em' a try guys! And DEFINITELY try the \"Chicken Risotto\" and the \"Shrimp and Andouille Paella\".  Update: Just finished licking the plate. It's that good."}
{"text":"Edited: I changed my review from a three to a four. They contacted me and refunded me for the food I had to throw out which was very kind and I always appreciate a company that stands behind their products. A couple of months after leaving my first review, I missed the convenience and delicious food, so I signed back up. Unfortunately, my first delivery was marked as delivered by FedEx though it was not (not Freshly's fault and they were quick to rectify, just annoying in general). The second week came fine but again the timing doesn't work with having fresh meals through the week (see original review below), so I've been taking the meals and putting them in the freezer for times when I can't/don't have time to cook. I don't think it will end up working for regular lunches for me, but it is nice to have healthy, delicious meals handy when I need them. Overall, definitely worth a try and while I will likely go off and on subscription (you can also \"skip a week\" if you just need a week or two off), I am happy to have the option of a company that prepares delicious, quality food and offers excellent customer service.   Original: First of all, the food is spot on delicious. I am SO impressed with the quality, it is the perfect size, and great if you are watching calories (for example, a generous slice of meatloaf, cauliflower mash, and peas and onions lands at just 420 calories). Every single meal was tasty. And by tasty, I mean, could have been a takeout from a restaurant kind of tasty.The price is reasonable for what you get, and in the end I probably save money just by not eating out for lunch all the time and I KNOW I'm eating much healthier.  The downside? I want to use them for lunches at work but the delivery options just aren't good for this. For example, the shipment of six meals I received a couple of days ago, on Friday November 3, expire on Tuesday November 7, and there aren't any better delivery options. I just had to throw out three meals from last week because they had expired by several days and I couldn't get to them in time. That's thirty bucks down the drain. Unfortunately, I just had to cancel my subscription for this reason. Bummer, because I thought I had finally landed on a perfect solution for easy, delicious, healthy lunches.  If you decide you would like to try it out, I recommend the chicken livorno and the shepherd's pie. SO GOOD and my two favorites. The buffalo chicken is good but if you're like me and want a little more heat, be prepared to dress it up a bit with some Frank's hot sauce and while you're at it throw on some blue cheese crumbles. The meatloaf is also good when you're wanting a little comfort food without the calories."}
{"text":"Decided to give Freshly a try.  Signed up for a 6 meal subscription and on the very first delivery the food arrived two days late.  I received an email from them the day I was expecting the shipment only to be told that the delivery was delayed.  Food was finally delivered two days later and the meals had an expiration date of 2 days later.  It was a complete bust on many fronts.  An unreliable delivery service for meals and expired food defeats the whole purpose of the convenience behind this."}
{"text":"Freshly customer service is really good. They actually put customers first. The food is great as well. As airline employee with a lot of travel. The variety and quality of food is super. Thanks for a great experience!"}
{"text":"Guys, you get fresh food that is healthy and you don't have to prep, cook or clean. The online interface is easy to use on my phone, tablet, and computer. I have to add extra salt, pepper, hot sauce, and lemon but I understand they are making these meals with the idea that users who want more can always add more. It takes 15 seconds to season to my liking and doesn't really add any significant time or cost to my meal. Food arrives well packed and very cold.  My only gripe is that I wish they used coconut oil instead of canola. I think that would make it absolute perfection in my book, but if that's the worst thing I have to say, they are doing an excellent job.  I wish I found these sooner. I lost 5 pounds the first week without really trying. A+."}
{"text":"I thought that these foods would be more fresh and healthy. Unfortunately the amount of sodium in some of these dishes are way too high for me.  It was a struggle to eat some of these precooked meals. The flavors were definitely a swing and miss for me. I cannot recommend this company, and I will be looking elsewhere for a healthier and more tasty option."}
{"text":"This is one of the best \"MEAL TO HOME\" companies EVER!!!!!  Today and every other day, it seems like media offers us \"great organic\" or, \"easy to cook prepared meals\".  As far as I know, there is only 1 company that delivers the goods. For less than $10 a meal, you don't need to prep. Don't need to boil and never have a mess to clean up.  I have cancer. 15 years now. When ever asked at chemo (when and if), what is my secret Is... I allways says rest 1st and diet 2nd.  These prepared meals from Freshly.com deliverthat. Not full of SOY or other cheap fillers. Just real fresh food, delivered to your home, pre cooked and never frozen!  I don't eat them like everyday. Some days I want a stupid thing like pizza. If I don't eat that day's meal, I freeze it and eat it another day.  If you know of anyone in your life that needs excellent nutrition for a low cost, check this out!"}
{"text":"Let's be honest here and review this company and food for what it is.  It is a super convenient option for those of us that work long hours, want better food options than McDonald's, but don't have the time or energy to cook at home.  Can I buy a $4 frozen meal at the store, well sure I can, but that is not what I want.  I want something fresher, healthier, and a better portion.  Freshly accomplishes that. Every meal is gluten free, high protein, low carb, and all natural.  If you want restaurant quality meals for $5, good luck to you.  For the convenience and price, these meals are quick and tasty.  Had the flat iron steak meal last night, personally I couldn't finish it all, and the steak was super tender, which surprised me considering we heat it up in the microwave.  I'm excited to try the other meals received.  My husband loved it too, and while he could probably eat more, we are looking to lose weight and have portion control.  I would say the ONLY thing I've noticed was that the meals have high sodium content, but that is expected with convenience meals.   For what this service provides-I love it.  I have not had any customer service issues, but will update if I ever do."}
{"text":"Amazing! This service is my dream come true. I've been ordering from Freshly for 3 weeks now and I absolutely love it. The dishes are so good they're the same or better than many restaurants. I used to order Blue Apron and Hello Fresh, but I just couldn't find the time to cook 3-4 times a week. I love that it's soooo convenient, yet prepared freshly (hah!). All the dishes I've had so far (~10) are delicious (actually can't pick out one I dislike, maybe the Southwest Veggie bowl if I had to pick one), and makes my body feel amazing afterwards. I also love that good nutritional knowledge went into the recipes so they are low in artificial sugar and other bad for you things, as explained on the packaging of each meal. I think if I continue to eat 2 freshly a day with a small snack, I will be able to stay under 1200cal/week, which would allow me to eat healthy and loose 1lb a week. Perfect!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like Freshly for a number of reason but my primary reason for trying Freshly was for my 88yr old mother whom we have been trying to get out of the kitchen due to safety risks.  I thought if I could find her quality, nutritious prepared dishes she can just warm-up, she could spend more time playing Bingo rather than banging pots-n-pans together to put a meal together.   My mother is 88 and eats fairly healthy and has no health issues or diet restrictions at all so after doing my research on these Prepared meal providers, I settled for Freshly because they were one of the few if not only that offer already prepared dishes unlike some of them that send you all the ingredients and you put it together, that would defeat the purpose of what my intentions were.   Freshly delivered on everything they offer and we never had any problem with their service, food quality or anything.  This is week 4 that we have had deliveries of meals under the 6 meals a week subscription which I have been ordering her 2 breakfast and 4 dinner meals.  When the meals arrive, I go over and unpack them for her because the deliver box is too heavy for her to lift. I turn each one over and arrange them by the \"Best when used by date\" with the most recent on top and the older ones at the bottom.   The trend that I have noticed has been that 4 out of the 6 meals have a best when used by date on the same day and the other 2 soon after or before.  This is an issue because my 88yr old mother doesn't eat that much and has been eating half at lunch and half at dinner because she cannot consume the entire portion in one sitting.   All-in-all, I don't recommend this service for seniors because of 2 reasons.  The best before dates are too close together (4 on the same day is a lot) and the portions are too big for most seniors her age.  Outside of what my personal experience has been, Freshly does a great job, they just don't work for my situation so I am going to cancel my subscription and look for something more local who can better meet our needs."}
{"text":"I wasn' t too sure if I would like it because it comes cook but decided to try it out because it was $39.99. When the box came it was very simply put it away and heat when wanting to eat. We enjoyed the food nothing to fancy but it did the job. Freshly is made easy for people like me who have kids and are in college."}
{"text":"Do not subscribe!  I signed up for their promotion of 2 weeks for $39 per week.  There was snow the second week and the meals did not get delivered.  They delivered my second meal the third week and charged $59.99 to my credit card, but subsequently sent a message saying I would get a credit but it may take a couple of months before it would appear on my statement.  It's been 3 months and they never issued the credit, so I contacted them today and they said I waited too long to contact them about my credit and all they could offer was half off a future delivery!  Now I've had to dispute the charge with my cc company.  Also, food was mediocre at best."}
{"text":"I've been using Freshly for about 2 months now. For the most part is is a great value and the meals are really good with fresh organic ingredients. Unlike other meal services, the meals are already prepared and ready to eat. You just pop them in the oven or microwave.  I currently use the 4 meals per week plan at $49.99/week with free shipping. Only one meal was bad out out of the many I have eaten. Not bad at all. I will keep using Freshly, but hope they keep updating their meal plans with different dinners from time to time. All in all a great company with really good food and worth the cost per week. The best part is you can skip a week or two if you are out of town or if you just want a break."}
{"text":"Found this on Living Social . Received it in 4 days along with instructions on how to take care of it.(refrigerate, not freeze) The food arrived when they promised, everything was there,  packages were intact.Two days later, I got an email saying that if I didn't make any changes (as in cancelling or skipping a week) that my next order would be billed to my credit card in 3 days. I like that there doesn't seem to be any surprises with this company. I also like that I can skip a week which gives me time to actually try the food before deciding to stay with the same meals,  pick new ones or cancel.   I am impressed with this company. The meals are all tasty and interesting. Two minutes in the microwave and they are ready to eat. They weigh between 10 and 14 ounces and are very filling. (update-We didn't like the sweet potato hash or fries)   Customer service is excellent. Food is creative, tasty and filling. Our only concerns are while doing the math comparing how much it would cost to cook my own or go out to eat, (paying for food, gas and tip) how cost effective is this plan. Without a coupon it is $10.75 per meal.  And be aware while reading the nutritional values since there are a serving and a half in each package so divide accordingly for nutritional values.  THIS IS MY GO-TO PLACE FOR MEAL DELIVERIES!                                           * * *Update* * * Freshly is the fourth food delivery program that I have tried and my favorite. Personal Trainer Foods was also a meat and vegetable only plan and was my second favorite. They were a little cheaper but the food was unimaginative and in separate bags so a plate was always needed. The other was a plan in which I had to actually throw away some of the foods because of flavor and texture. Handpick was good but I had to prepare the meals myself with their ingredients.                                           * * *Update 7/15/2015* * * I tried the 4 day plan again as a diet plan instead of a meal plan this time. No added food and eating only their breakfast, (which were very tasty too) lunch and dinners. I didn't get hungry between meals, clean ups were a breeze and I lost 4 pounds in 4 days."}
{"text":"So very  disappointing our very first delivery was left at our door we live in Arizona it's extremely hot in Arizona when we discovered it had been left at our door all of the contents were very hot the meat was hot everything looked absolutely horrible hopefully the cancellation process won't be a bad experience as well"}
{"text":"... so many bad reviews ....   I normally do not give bad reviews. But I feel it should be a caution to anyone using this service. Be aware that the policy for cancellation is not a very good one. I signed up through a promotion that was going on and it was not made very clear that I was actually signing up for a subscription. I feel this is very sneaky.   \"Be very careful with this one, it is very difficult to discontinue without incurring substantial charges.    I should have read other customer reviews on this firm before I entrusted them with my credit card info. Please do not make the same mistake that I did.\" - a fellow Yelper  Also, the food is very salty."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like Freshly due to the convenience of having pre-cooked \"healthy\" food delivered at your doorstep, but the taste and value just isn't there. After a few times eating the same meals, you just get kind of tired of it and at over $10/meal, you just would rather go eat at a fast food joint. Here are the meals I tried and my scores:  Grilled Flat Iron Steak: 4- tender and juicy, steak is somewhat slim but it was enough for me.   Baked Penne Marinara: 3 - a little bland, but a generous portion.   Chimichurri Salmon: 2.5 - to me, there's something wrong with eating a precooked salmon and microwaving it later. It's dry and doesn't taste fresh.   Grilled herb chicken: 1 - I do not recommend. It was bland, boring and I threw most of it away.   Garlic & Herb Shrimp: 2 - the shrimp is really small and the flavor wasn't that great. It looks better than it tastes.  Peruvian style stuffed peppers: 2 - I wasn't a big fan of this one either. I didn't like the taste and I only ate half of one pepper. The package comes with 2.   Sweet & Spicy chicken: 3 - the flavor wasn't bad but the chicken was small!   Overall, convenient but pricey. I cancelled my weekly delivery and don't plan to sign up again. I'd rather eat out or make my own paleo/gluten free meals."}
{"text":"These meals are delicious.  Not sure why the 3 star ratings.  We love them. There have been a few that we were not real fond of, but that could have happened in a restaurant.  Not everyone likes the same type of foods.   They are filling & 1000 times better than a store bought TV dinner.  Read the ingredients. We stay away from anything with certain spices or real spicy. Everything is shown on the page for each dish.~~~They are packed well when they arrive in a frozen type foam lining the sides & top & bottom. Always very cold when they arrive.  Not meant to be frozen, but can be. We prefer them not frozen as the veggies are better that way. ~~~Give them a try.  For the $39 introductory price, you can't go wrong. Customer Service is extremely responsive."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. My meals were apparently tnrown on the porch sideways and ruined. Sent email complaint and awaiting response. The food I received looked disgusting due to their carelessnessnesd. Never again."}
{"text":"How does Freshly possibly have a 3 star rating?!   Honest to God, Freshly has changed my life. I'm a busy professional with a family, which means I workout at 4:30a, work 11hrs, then spend remaining time with my wife and kids before bed; little time for anything else. Now I can have an amazingly fresh and healthy meal first thing in the morning, and then another great meal at lunch, all with no effort on my part? That's a game changer.  No stopping work to run and get take-out. No late nights out grocery shopping or meal prepping. Seriously, it's improved every other facet of my life by freeing up precious time while also ensuring my nutrition is healthy. Oh, and they taste terrific, just a small bonus right there :)  But seriously, it's worth every penny. They honestly taste amazing, they show up on time, and they haven't made a mistake in over a year of having them. Plus, they keep things fresh (heh;) by constantly changing up the menu. I guess you could say I'm a true believer!"}
{"text":"Love the convenience.  This is so much better than meal prepping. I thought the food was great. Added a little salt, pepper, and garlic but that's just my taste.  Haven't tried any breakfast options. I've been freezing a lot of my meals so they don't go bad. Overall I am very pleased with freshly and highly recommend it.  I've already got another $40 off for my friend signing up.  Also I think that it's a very good price."}
{"text":"Almost everything I've tried thus far, is pretty much tasteless...had to cancel my subscription..."}
{"text":"These people are undependable and unreliable. My experience has been that they don't care about their customers. They care little about the fact that people rely on their meals to arrive every week. Rather than rescheduling your delivery date, they opt to just cancel your delivery for holiday weeks like July 4th and Thanksgiving, etc. I would certainly look elsewhere is weekly meals are a necessity for you. Sure, they give you advanced notice which necessitates that you log onto their website for said notification -  God forbid that you be too busy to stay in constant contact. Then, they send you an email that arrives too late to reschedule your delivery date. Nice move guys!! I SUGGEST YOU TRY SOMEONE ELSE FOR DEPENDABLE, RELIABLE SERVICE."}
{"text":"I must say first of all I really want to like this company. They have the right idea! It just totally misses the mark.  I have tried the turkey Shepard's pie, and the turkey dinner with Brussels sprouts, and the chicken parmigiana. The three meals did one good thing for me by taking me back to my childhood when I was forced to eat this kind of food in my school's cafeteria. Everyday!!!  BTW I want to taste the flavors of the food instead of sodium. The strangest part is that the name of your company \"Freshly\" is s contradiction to what I feel we are getting. I do believe that the food is fresh, but how in the world did you make it so taste like a frozen TV dinner without ever freezing it is really disturbing to me!!  Honestly, I have had better meals on an airplane.  Come on Freshly, you can do this!! Stop being a Keurig and start being a Nespresso!!"}
{"text":"I got my first order on Tuesday this week (I decided to try it since they had a $50 off promotion).  I cancelled the subscription on Wednesday due to the following reasons (that I have already sent to them):  1. Every single meal has grapeseed oil and my son is allergic to grapeseed oil, so I have to make a separate meal for him anyway.  It's not necessary to use grapeseed oil for all meals, and others may be allergic as well.  There should be some choices that use safer oils like canola or vegetable oil. 2. The meals are packaged in a way that they look like frozen entrees/TV dinners.  That has turned me and my husband off even though it says it's fresh.  Different packaging would help. 3. So far, the meals are okay, nothing spectacular.  Some have a lot of flavor and others are very bland and definitely not worth the full $11 price. 4. Some containers have the plastic wrap so strongly glued to the box that I can't peel it off, I have to cut it with scissors or a knife.  This is fine, except it makes it difficult at work and when I'm in a hurry. 5. 2 minutes is not enough time to heat all of the products. When I heated chicken dishes such as Chicken Rustica or Chicken Livorno or even the Grilled Iron Steak, for 2 minutes, the meat was cold on the inside.  And I have a very powerful microwave.  All in all, I would love to try this again once the above issues have been resolved.  It's great for full-time working mothers, although on the expensive side."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this company but the food was very disappointing. The \"slow cooked beef chili\" had ZERO flavor (might as well have come from a can), and the \"braised rosemary pork\" was also bland... with no hint of rosemary oddly enough. Honestly, they could improve everything dramatically by just adding herbs and spices. The problem is there is no flavor, no complexity - no pop.  Yes, the idea is good and the marketing savvy... also the website and customer service seem well-managed. But the bottom line is - it's food. Food has to taste good. Unless they integrate good recipes, they'll never survive."}
{"text":"This is long overdue, but here it is, finally.   I don't cook much and do a lot of take out. So it made sense to try out these meal services that seems to be all the rage nowadays for busy/lazy people.   I used a 50% off coupon, $35 for 6 meals. I went for 2 breakfasts, 1 lunch and 3 dinners.   Placing an order was easy. Went online, placed the order on a Monday for Saturday delivery. FedEx shipping info was sent by email. Food started its journey to me on Thursday and delivered by end of day on Saturday as promised.   Items were well packaged and remained cold but not frozen. Portions appeared substantial. I'm hopeful about the taste. Since this is a subscription service, I can't imagine having to send so much styrofoam, plastic bag and ice packs to landfills every week if I continued the service.  The meals rate on a scale from glorified TV dinner to day old leftovers to take-out. Overall, just on basis of the ridiculous waste and garbage generated by the packaging alone, I'd opt not to order again."}
{"text":"We just got our first set of meals this weekend. Right off the bat, I was impressed with the eco friendly package.  We tried our first meals last night. I had pork carnitas, hubby had peppercorn steak. Both meals were excellent. Tonight we had penne with sausage. Again, excellent. Prep is super fast. Add a salad, and dinner is ready in 10 minutes!!"}
{"text":"Bought the groupon, and then the second week for regular price-6 meals in a week. I liked the food, especially the Salmon and Cod meals. Super easy to order, easier to prepare. I recommend freshly to anyone that wants to have healthy options to eating fast food on the go-or anyone with food sensitivities."}
{"text":"The food tastes great (and is healthy!) and love that the meals are pre-cooked so that I don't have to worry about cooking or a mess afterwards. It really does make a difference if you cook it on a plate rather than the container that they come in. And shipping cost is included, unlike some other food meal delivery services out there. It's also nice getting 6 individual meals rather than 3 meals that feed 2 people, since I live alone. And can't forget to mention, the customer service is OUTSTANDING! I had a problem with the actual delivering company (whether it be USPS, FedEx, or UPS) not delivering my food on time and Freshly refunded my order and gave me credit for my next order, despite it not even being their fault. Very impressed by everything about the company and highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Pretty the same the picture online, and very delicious taste. Nice package. The price was not bad since it was on sale , and they even have steak too"}
{"text":"I really enjoy these meals, and the fact that I can sort them by calorie count when selecting my meals for the week has been really helpful in my weight loss journey. The problem for me is that today is the second time in just two months that I haven't received the delivery on the specified date. When I contact Freshly, in both instances I was told the food would arrive too late to be considered safe to eat and I should discard the delivery. My money gets refunded (in 3-5 days) and extra money is credited to my account, but this hardly makes up for the poor delivery service. This is going to be a crazy busy week for me and I will have no time to prep meals...and now I'm without the meals from Freshly. I also have to be wasteful and discard the meals. So, while I've been really pleased with the taste and quality of the meals, I'm rethinking continuing with Freshly. If I'm depending on them for meals for the week, and they don't get delivered, that's just too much of an inconvenience."}
{"text":"I have mixed feeling about Freshly. Some of their options are delicious, others, not so much. The turkey dinner was gross, but the steak with mashed red potatoes was so tender and wonderful. Overall, the price is too much for what you get so I cancelled."}
{"text":"Amazing !  Best is the steak peppercorn and the pastas.  Always fresh, tastes great downside is the price but it is worth it to not have to cook!"}
{"text":"** Updated review 8/17 After approximately 18 months I've decided to cancel my subscription. I love the meals and customer service has been fantastic with promptly  crediting my account each time my meals arrived days late or not at all. Unfortunately, OnTrac is the only shipper Freshly uses for my area and they suck. If your shipper is FedEx go for it!  **************************************  Today my third week delivery is due, it's current 9:00pm and order is not here yet. Last week it arrived after 10:00pm and woke up my household and barking dog. I'm hoping I'll be able to request only FedEx delivery for future orders, if not I'll need to cancel my subscription. I'm not able to leave the package  outside over night due to living in the country with deer, coyotes, squirrels, possums & other critters.  The food is very good and packaged well. I could probably eat bigger portions but my reasons for ordering is portion control, low carb, quality food and variety. Freshly fits the bill! Hopefully, shipping issue can be resolved and I'll be a long time customer."}
{"text":"I have ordered Freshly for about 3 weeks now and I have to say that I am extremely satisfied. In the past I have tried both Nutrisystem and BistroMD and they aren't nearly as good as Freshly in terms of the quality of food. I purchase the 12 meal delivery for all of my lunches and dinners so I can't give you any input on the breakfast meals but I can say that all of the lunches and dinners are pretty darn good. I figure there is no point to buying breakfasts because they are just too easy to prepare on my own.  I have seen some reviewers talk about how they had some pieces of fat in their meat and I have experienced that as well, but it isn't the case will all of the meat dishes all of the time. This sort of thing is bound to happen but there is still plenty of food to eat. Also I saw some mention of the meals having too much pepper. There is a dish of Pepper steak where they use whole peppers in the sauce which I happen to really like.  The greatest part of Freshly (at least for me) is that I don't have to cook, or shop for food and clean up the kitchen, and deal with tupperware containers. When I am sitting down eating a Freshly meal I think to myself how much time and effort it would take me to make a similar meal and it's so worth it! It's worth it to spend approx 10 dollars a meal and have more time to live my life.  Tip: If your ordering the 12 meal program (6 days lunch/Dinner) and you want to make your meals last 7 days a week. Skip one day (make it a cheat day) and every time your order comes in you will have an extra day.  I highly recommend Freshly!"}
{"text":"**Update**  they have offered to refund half what I paid so upping my review to 3 stars instead of one.  Since I couldn't return the meals outright I did end up eating them.  Overall the food was good tasting.  The steak did taste good as well as several other dishes.  There wasn't anything that was bad tasting so they're doing a good job on making their meals taste good.      Original review:  I really was hoping this would be a great experience but unfortunately it is not.  I just received my order today for the first time and the portion sizes are A LOT smaller than the portion sizes on their website.  When I called Freshly customer service, the guy said that it's not posted on their website but he said portion sizes vary because they outsource from several different places, and that they go by weight.  The problem is if they go by total weight, they can add more potatoes and beans and less steak and claim it's the same weight, even though their picture on the website shows different proportions.  A couple examples out of the 9 meals I ordered are the meatloaf and the steak.  Both portions were 1/3 the size of the website picture.  What I got even when you hold a fork up to the tray to compare scale like the website has a fork to compare scale.  I am highly disappointed and cancelled my service with the customer service rep only 10 minutes after opening the box, even before I tried a single meal.  I wish I could just send the 9 meals back as I feel it's false advertising and they don't state on their website that portion sizes vary.   You will only find that out if you call customer service.  I feel cheated, like this is false advertising not disclosing that to new customers.  Like I said, I sincerely want to just send the 9 meals back to them unopened and ask for a refund.  I'm very disappointed."}
{"text":"My husband and I are both personal trainers and we're trying out meal prep services because we have specific nutrition goals and no time to cook. I was pleasantly surprised when we got our first delivery. Everything is delicious!! Whenever we cook our meals at work, everyone comments on how good it smells. It fits in easily to our day because they are fairly reasonable with calories and super high in protein. I've been recommending Freshly to all my clients. It's also nice that you can skip weeks at a time if you are going on a vacation. Thumbs up for Freshly!"}
{"text":"Allow me to get straight to the point....  After having my first meal today (pork carnitas - which I've read is one of the better meals) I was going to score Freshly at 3.5/5 for what it is. However, after having spent the last 20 minutes in the bathroom with an upset stomach as a result of my first meal I am inclined to change the score to 2/5.   Taste: 3/5 - For what it is - a precooked meal in a box - not bad at all, could use some pepper.  Convenience: 2/5 - I don't understand the logic behind having 3 days to eat 6 dinners. Further, if I only have 3 days to eat 6 meals I'd much rather it come on Monday vs. Thursday when I'm entering the weekend and have time to prepare a meal.   How my stomach feels: 1/5 - None of the ingredients in the meal were foreign to my diet.   Price: 3/5 - Took advantage of the $40 off sale. approx. $6.60 per dinner isn't bad. But I doubt I would pay the full price of approx. $10/meal   Logistic: 2/5 - I didn't like the fact that I have literally 24hrs to place my order for next weeks delivery. What if I like a meal from this week and want to reorder it? (I suppose convenience also fits into this category).  I paid for it so I will try another meal tonight. Wish my body luck!"}
{"text":"TERRIBLE FOOD and HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE... Unethical company.. I ordered 6 items on a trial subscription. They got the order wrong and 3 of the 6 fish dishes were inedible. Fish smelled so bad we ended up throwing them away. The other 3 were bland and like any frozen food you can get at a supermarket, at 4x the cost.  Within 24 hours of receiving the first shipment, before I even had a chance to taste the food, I was charged $62 for the second shipment. They were also supposed to send an email notifying me of upcoming charges but I never received it. Immediately went online to cancel my subscription and contacted the company.   Told the rep how bad the food was, not receiving an email notification of the charge, and that I do not want to continue the service. The rep rudely said \"you do realize we are a subscription based company\" and that they will not refund the 2nd shipment because I 'should've' received an email. I asked to speak to a manager to which she said \"fine, but the manager is not going to refund your money either.\" After a 10 minute hold for the manager, she came back and said they're having internet problems so she is not able to transfer the call. Could this be why I never received the email from them??? If the manager ever calls back and doesn't correct the situation, I will be disputing the charge with my cc company.   ======== Update:  1 1/2 day later - received a call from a supervisor. She actually stated that she also did not receive email notification of charges from the company when she first signed up for subscription... but that the problem had been resolved... obviously not. Bottom line, she refused any refund. Spoke to Toby, cust svc manager who was rude and arrogant. He also said he is not going to do anything about the problem... he's not going to issue a refund and that's that.... and that there's no one above him that I would be able to speak to. Let's see how long this company stays in business.   Will be contacting the state consumer protection and BBB. May contact the health department because obviously they're not handling fish properly."}
{"text":"Five stars for customer service alone... I have used the service for a few months now and they are SUPER on top of communication, whether I had a question or there was a problem (only once, the food went bad bc the box got delayed, due to FedEx, not Freshly, and they credited my account right away when I alerted them).  I always felt like there was a real, friendly person there, even though we were communicating via email.  The food is very tasty and consistent, and you choose all your meals.  I feel secure that everything they make is absolutely gluten-free (not all meal delivery services can say that, even if they offer gluten-free options).  I'm a fan of this company!"}
{"text":"The food was alright for the $49 promo price but not for $99! I could go out to eat everyday for that price! More importantly, their subscription system sucks. I skipped the second week since we had only just received the food and then I was out of town camping the next weekend and got back just after the 5pm Sunday deadline. I was already charged for the next week and while I could still change the meals for another day, they refused to cancel the week's shipment because I missed the deadline by one hour. They claimed it was because the food was already purchased but then how is it I could still change meals? They even told me they sent two emails saying the deadline was Saturday when they really sent one saying it was Sunday. And you can't completely cancel your subscription, only pause it! It's the same system as loot crate or a food coop, except with either of those, if you miss the deadline, you're only out $50/month rather than $100/week. Plus, you get a lot more from those services than this one."}
{"text":"I did the promotion.  Figured I would give it a try.  I've been using other food delivery services but only ones where you have to prepare the meal.  Compared to those, this service is really not good.  The portions are small and the last meal I just ate seemed like something from my high school cafeteria.  Like the mystery meat we all have experienced.  And, like others, I did not realize I needed to cancel/skip my next delivery until it was too late.  I received my first order on a Saturday and as of Sunday night they had charged me again for the next week and also giving me the same meals.  I didn't even get a chance to try them.  I would not have ordered the second week's worth.  The only reason I give them 2 stars is because the chili was actually quite delicious.  The rest, bland and meh. Stouffers lasagna is better.   If they improved the food, I could see where this service would be useful.  Esp. for old people and people totally on the go."}
{"text":"BEWARE!!!! DO NOT subscribe to this food delivery service.  The quality is terrible and the meals are not appetizing at all.  The customer service is the worst I have ever seen. They will not and would not do anything to accomodate you if you need to change anything.   If you need pre-made food go to your local provider for these services.  Buy local and organic! This company is the worst.  Don't waste your time and money. You will be dissapointed!!"}
{"text":"I've been chronically ill for a while now and so I decided to try this company which makes it easier to just pop some freshly chef made food into my microwave and eat. No cooking, no washing pots and pans. I had read the reviews which were mainly good.   I tried the 6 meals for $39.00 plan and when it arrived it was in a nicely insulated cold box, everything was icy cold so I was not worried about the quality or safety of the meals.   I ordered:   Sicilian Chicken Parmesan Meatloaf w/ Cauliflower Mash Chicken Fajitas w/ roasted corn (no tortillas) Breakfast platter of eggs, potato hash, and a sausage patty Denver Omelet with cheese BLT Omelet with cheese  I thoroughly enjoyed each meal although I am not a fan of uncured pork, it tastes too gamey for me so that made the omelets not really edible for my taste. The bacon and the ham were baked into the omelet so I could not pick it out and there was not much cheese inside at all. The omelets do not come with sides, a little veggie would be nice.   They use greek yogurt in a lot of their sauces, in the cauliflower mash and in the roasted corn and I'm not a huge fan of yogurt but again, just personal preference.   I canceled my subscription simply because there aren't yet enough vegetarian options on the menu, I only saw one and it was a penne pasta, that is something not hard to make on my own even when I am ill. If they ever offer a lot more vegetarian options and switch to a cured bacon I'll try it again.   If those things don't matter to you, you will likely find the dishes fast and fresh and very easy to make. I would recommend this to a friend with fewer food issues.  I will definitely keep checking back weekly to see if they add new items and more vegetarian fare, even though I'm not a vegetarian I like to opt for those non meat items especially for food delivery."}
{"text":"I am now on my second week of orders and I love the food its freshly prepared . I've seen other reviews about the size of the box vs the sizes of the meals I think both are just fine. I have even given the link to a few friends who have also now joined . Plus as a bonus they give you free meals when people do sign up which is awesome .. This weeks meals were FREE ! The food is amazing and works wonderfully for busy people and people with allergies . Highly recommend this company to all."}
{"text":"Tried this for our dinners this week... Terrible ! We compared it to airplane food.  Their food is not fresh. I was so unhappy !  We have ordered tons of food subscriptions and this is the worst ! We cancelled .  Total wast of $$ !"}
{"text":"I used this service for a very unique reason.  I had 2 friends in different states who both \"just lost their husbands.\"  In deciding what I could do to help them while they were so down, knowing they won't feel like cooking just for themselves;  I decided to send each of them meals from Freshky.com for a few weeks.  First and foremost both of these friends raved about the \"quality and freshness of the meals received.\"  For me, setting up the two accounts and organizing different meal variety for each week for both friends was \"very easy to do\" - just be careful because if you don't switch out the meals yourself for each week, the system will default to your latest order.  Anyway, it was easy to skip weeks, change up the meals, and cancel once I felt my friends had some time to adjust a little better from their losses.   Prices are reasonable, with high quality fresh ready made meals delivered to their doors, this was a good choice and I am thankful for their services."}
{"text":"I have been using Freshly since the beginning of 2018. I have lost over 15 pounds in just over a month. I receive 9 meals from Freshly weekly and while their have been a couple meals that are so so, all the others have been great and filling. My weekly faves are the meatloaf, sausage and peppers, and steak peppercorn."}
{"text":"My first meal order was delivered this morning! So I just ate a BLT omelette from freshly. The smell of it cooking in the microwave was mouthwatering and the  taste eating it was heavenly delicious! I can't wait to try dinner! So far I am extremely satisfied! It was chock-full of goodness! I could never make one like that."}
{"text":"Stay away if you are accustomed to eating healthy!   I weight lift 4 times a week and was hoping Freshly could provide clean post-workout meals to make sure I meet my protein and calorie needs. I was disappointed.  Freshly covers their meat and vegetables in extremely thick sauces and marinades. Everything tastes \"heavy\" and thick. Which is sad because the chicken is of high quality and would be great without the sauce. I actually rinsed it in the sink and ate it plain :/ As someone who generally only eats fresh store-bought produce/meats with minimal sauces and ingredients, almost all of the Freshly meals tasted unhealthy.   It reminds me of Fresh and Easy.... which I used to love but after eating extremely clean for the last 2 years, now tastes like nothing but sodium and sugar to me. In all honesty, Freshly meals would probably taste \"healthy\" to most modern Americans  The steak had potential but had an unacceptable amount of fat for over a $10 a meal. Ended up giving 1/3 of it to my dog."}
{"text":"First: I got 3 meals...2 days later another 6! Had to throw out good food for room. I didn't order 2nd box...just wanted to try 1st. And too soon for it to come automatically. Food: Overall just plain bad. I really was looking forward to this service because I'm disabled, not suppose to cook (on oxygen) but a brief synopsis of what I have tried: Turkey with quinoa: thin stringy slices (2) of turkey on top of quinoa dressing. I like quinoa, but this had an unusual aftertaste...not pleasant. Flat ugly meal, not at all appetizing. Peppercorn steak: Nuked great, but suppose to stir potatoes halfway. Problem: steak on top of potatoes...have to pick up steak, stir potatoes and scoot them to one side. No separate compartment. I was really happy with steak (about medium) until I got to thicker center...too chewy and texture like tough liver. Carrots/green beans too tough/rubbery to eat. Shrimp scampi: WT*? Lots of water?wine? no taste, small shrimp and small almost pearl rice. Tried garlic and butter, but it was past saving. What's with all the watery liquid? Should have said to peel back or not used so much liquid.  I have 1 more steak dinner and a chicken masala? left from second order. Frankly, to be blunt I wish I'd thrown those out and kept my food. I'm not even tempted to try the chicken, but I will give steak one more chance because I threw out good food for these little entrée boxes. Biggest disappointment. Way overpriced for amount of product or quality. Customer service was good...initially he credited me with 2 both weeks, but then charged me for one of the weeks.  Pro: One meal was the breakfast of scrambled eggs, sausage. It was good, but c'mon, can't throw us a biscuit in there? I didn't want to cook a whole can of them!   I know this is a harsh review. But I've tried Blue Apron, Marley & Co. Hello Fresh and even Plated, which I gave most all away because my lack of desire to cook. I set high unattainable goals, at times. And the amount of food in 3 of those were worth the money. Marley & Co. recipes I ordered (I should have believed the recipe pictures)...too time consuming and not appetizing to me. Regretted buying them. I read this is part of Marley & Co...I can easily believe it. I'm sticking with my limited home cooking for about $2.00 for 3 meals."}
{"text":"Tis is a great service, items arrive beautifully packaged in the delivery box. I was quite impressed after comparing to blue apron.  The food taste great, and it is as easy as warming up in the microwave for 2 minutes. No clean up, no cooking no mess. I wish they had more options as they only change one item per week, I can see myself getting tired of it, but hey, if I can feed my family with natural ingredients and preservatives as easy as I am able to do so with Freshly, then hey.. its great in my book!"}
{"text":"I simply can't understand the bad reviews. The WEBSITE is so simple to use. I did make a mistake when trying to change my # of meals but a quick call to the SUPER HELPFUL customer service department and they fixed me right up. There is a good mix of meals for my whole family! My 8 year old loves the meatballs/pasta, husband loves all of them he's tried & I love the \"healthy\" side options. Helps out for dinners on those \"late night\" football practices. These are WAY BETTER than those frozen freezer meals. All of the items have been seasoned to our satisfaction and I really have no complaints. It isn't THEIR FAULT if you forget to choose your meals/cancel subscription."}
{"text":"Super yummy! Love how they package their food!! Would highly recommend ! They have a buffalo chicken that is great! They have sausage that is good! They have penna pasta that is bomb! Everything is so yummy!"}
{"text":"Steak Peppercorn and Buffalo chicken with caulifliwer mash are good. Much better than tv dinners and lower in salt. I decided my cash could be better spent at the supermarket though. I can get a big bag of frozen chicken breasts and pop in the air fryer along and buy a bag of frozen veggies to microwave for the cost one Freshly meal. Food for a week if I  choose.   I have found the customer service to be very responsive."}
{"text":"Every meal I have had has been excellent.  Whoever says they are like tv dinners are crazy.  Quality food.  Have had my subscription for a month and love it.  Favorites are the peppercorn steak, chicken with rice pilaf, and homestyle meatloaf.  Portions are perfect."}
{"text":"A+ for customer service.  Other meal delivery services take note.  Boxes arrive with six big pieces of styrofoam lining the cardboard shipping box and a couple of ice packs inside.  Much less wasteful than the Pilates-sized mats seen in other boxes.  You open the box to see stacks of TV dinner looking meals and heavy card stock explaining the program.  Onto the food.  It's on the healthier side, and they say that the ingredients are high quality, no processed anything, all that good stuff.  Preparation is very easy (just pop in the microwave for a couple minutes) and the food is well cooked, not soggy, definitely not in the same league as frozen TV dinners.  Not as tasty as a piece of chicken that you would bake in the oven, but I don't think anyone expects that.  Overall the meals are simple and portions are much smaller than their cook-at-home meal delivery service counterparts.  $11 per heat-up meal for one person is probably not in most people's budgets.  Trader Joe's refrigerated meals are about $8 each and contain about 3x the amount of food (and are tastier, but I bet they contain processed everything and much more fat).  I'll note that when I tried to double up on items they were replaced with other items.  I really wanted two chicken parms in one box since this is the dish that my husband and I fight over, but instead they sent another chicken dish.  When they run out of meals they will send a note saying \"we ran out of X so here's Y instead\" but they did not send a note explaining that we are not allowed to double up, so maybe this was a packing error?  I'll pass on you, Freshly, but I am astonished at some of your other reviews on Yelp and others' low opinion of you when doing a Google search.  You aren't bad, just not for me."}
{"text":"I've tried my share of food delivery services, so when Freshly had a promotion on Facebook I decided to give them a try. Someone below compared this to food served on an airplane, and I think that's accurate if a bit forgiving. Oily, poorly flavored, overcooked. You'd be doing yourself a favor by purchasing canned or frozen foods from a more reputable source. Competitors at the same price range in my area are of such a better quality that it would be silly to compare. That there are reviews claiming their food is 'delicious' seems highly suspect to me, but I suppose taste is subjective.   Further, you will be given precisely one day to cancel your subscription after delivery. Freshly will not offer you a confirmation code to keep for your records. When I was concerned that something was amiss with my cancelation (they sent an email asking if I wanted to adjust my meals), I was told there was no record I had stopped the service and that I should be pleased that they could cancel the next. That was five days before the delivery date. For the first time ever, I had to contact my bank to intercede on my behalf.   TLDR: I would not recommend the food or the customer service."}
{"text":"I have seen many meal thing offers and used a few. After a good promotion 6 meals for $39 Delivered We decided to try Freshly.  It took a little over 2 weeks to get our first order.  Once you sign up they schedule you for a weekly delivery with options to skip the week or change your meals easily.  The food itself was well beyond my expectations both in serving size and taste.  Really great flavors and quality ingredients.  Outside of the promotion my price for 6 meals is $59.  This is about average and I feel that Freshly gives you a bit more and is better on the taste.   The packaging is great and all recyclable.    I would recommend to sure try this meal service.  Really great!"}
{"text":"All of my 6 meals in my most recent delivery had the same expiration date which was 3 days after the delivery. Just like throwing money in the trash can."}
{"text":"My customer experience with this company was terrible and it only lasted 48 hours. As a customer care professional, I was shocked at the response to my customer support inquiry after my first delivery. I had only tasted one meal after about 48 hours and was notified that I was already 5 hours too late in editing my meal options or pausing my delivery for my second week's delivery.  I was charged for a full second week, was not offered to reschedule and was flat out denied a any refund for something that I have not even received and isn't even close to being shipped out. So disappointing, especially at a time when I still paid to try them out while other competitors are offering free trials with much better customer support and follow-up.  Needless to say, this experience left a bad taste in my mouth. I wouldn't recommend Freshly, and it's unfortunate that I was not allowed ample time to really evaluate the product before being charged a second time.  I will repeat the following tip (previously mentioned by another reviewer): \"TIP: After placing your first order, immediately put a hold on all additional weeks until you try and decide if you want to continue. Freshly one requires NINETY-SIX hours (four whole days) notice in order to change or cancel any service, which is barely enough time to even eat what they ship before another one is on it's way.\""}
{"text":"Most of the dishes that I do order weekly for my husband are delicious, of course we had some that really were not tasty so we do not order them. The Meat loaf dish  Meat balls  and Herb chicken are delicious. The Pork and Chili Turkey were not good, The Chili Turkey even got him sick, bu he loves the food. Megan from Freshly customer service  had reached out  to me,  they do take it very seriously , I assume my husband had kind of allergy to the Chilli Turkey we  did receive  a full credit for the full week, so it seems like their concerned about customer health is very important to them. My husband loves their food and we continue to be a loyal customer."}
{"text":"I got sick from the few meals I did eat. It was my first time using the service. I'm giving 2 stars instead of 1 because the online chat was helpful, Alex was nice and helped me get a refund and to cancel the next box that was ordered."}
{"text":"So last week my Freshly went to a Tucson zip code (I live in Scottsdale). I guess my auto fill in Google must have filled in with my old Tucson zip even though it pulled my Scottsdale street address/City. I went in and updated my zip code and double checked it was good before delivery.  When I saw my delivery was again sent to Tucson this week, I sent them a chat. Apparently, there are two different places to change your address on the website. That seems like a pretty poor user experience. How would I know I need to change it in two different places?  This experience has kind of soured me on Freshly for now. The whole point of it for me is to save time. The last two weeks it's been more of a headache than a time saver."}
{"text":"Why would I want to take delivery of my work lunches at the end of the week? Customer service told me to freeze them? Only Thursday, Friday, Saturday delivery options? According to reviews, this seems to be a common complaint. Glad to hear the feedback is resonating with Freshly..."}
{"text":"**Update** Adding a star since they reached out to fix the issue. Still can't give it more than 3 stars since the food didn't blow me away and is a bit pricey for what it is.    Original review:  I liked Freshly for a few weeks, but ended up canceling due to bad customer service.   Pros: -Very convenient for when I don't have time to cook -Healthier than a frozen meal from the grocery store -Some of the meals were decent (Steak Peppercorn and Sweet & Sour Chicken were my favorites)  Cons -Most of the meals I tried were just okay -Price seems pretty high at $10/meal -Portion size is MUCH smaller than pictured on the website. Fine for me, but not enough food for my husband.  Customer service was really terrible and ultimately what made me cancel. I had updated my account to skip a few weeks since I'll be out of town, but it turns out this didn't save to my account so they sent me another box and charged me. When I reached out they said there was nothing they could do."}
{"text":"if you like eating handfuls of pepper it's not that bad i guess. i was really teetering between rating this a 2 or a 1. the reason why i decided on a 1 was because giving it a 2 means that it's not absolutely all bad....which i'm sorry to say it is. The food is marketed as being healthy fresh eating. There is nothing healthy about it. some of the items have over 700 calories. The food sounds like it should be delicious but everything has MASSIVE amounts of pepper on it. I don't know if it's because the food is lacking flavor or something and they decided that massive amounts of pepper was a good idea, but there is WAY to much pepper on every dish i had. i could go into the details of how some of the dishes resemble baby food, but will leave it with this....if you want to eat the same type of food. buy a 99 cent frozen meal, pour a bunch of pepper on it and boom...pretty much the same thing."}
{"text":"I have been a prepared foodie for several food companies.  I like healthy, no GMO's, additives, etc and Freshly has met all the criteria plus they are priced exceptionally well.  The food is VERY tasty; even the salmon.  Having lived in the Pacific Northwest, I am very picky about my salmon; most tastes fishy.  Only very fresh salmon does not.  Theirs exceeded my expectations!!  Recommend highly!!"}
{"text":"The first subscription arrived on time. Food tasted okay, I wouldn't say something great. I realized I could probably cook the same type if not better meals at home. But anyways, the whole idea of having Freshly is to cut down time on cooking when you're having busy weeks. The second delivery on the day before Thanksgiving never showed up, they emailed me it would be delivered the next day. Nothing, no emails and I understand it's holiday, so why commit something you know you can't deliver? I am cancelling my subscription and will probably check out other options for ad hoc needs."}
{"text":"I LOVE Freshly! When I started my subscription I got the 6 meals a week plan, and after the first week I upgraded to the 12 meals a week. This gives my husband and I dinner M-Th and my work lunches M-Th. My husband works very long hours and I work full time and go to school, so coming home at the end of each day and cooking dinner is sometimes fairly daunting and we end up eating less-healthy than we'd like. Freshly makes it a quick 3 minutes in the microwave for a delicious, perfectly portioned healthy meal. We have yet to try a meal we didn't like and the pork carnitas is our absolute favorite. I anticipate keeping my subscription for the foreseeable future!"}
{"text":"I'm not buying these one star review folks! I've been ordering Freshly for almost a year, and sure sometimes you may get a meal that's not quite up to snuff, but this fantastic company ALWAYS makes it right. Think very fresh, never frozen, TV dinners, sounds strange right? If you go to the grocery store and buy a Stoffers individual meal it will run you around five bucks, for five bucks more you get a fresh complete meal delivered to your home! No driving to the store, no shopping, no cooking, no hassle.   Now about the food, I've pretty much tried most of the meals, and with the exception of one meal all of them have been truly fantastic. One time I received chicken risotto and it had a burnt taste. I contacted customer service and they immediately gave me credit towards a free meal. If you're busy and you really don't have time to drive to the store, shop, cook, and serve then this is a dream come true."}
{"text":"I've been ordering Freshly on and off for the last eight months or so and I absolutely LOVE this service. I haven't had a meal I didn't enjoy. You get to pick each meal that is delivered to you and can cancel, skip, and go back to your subscription any time you'd like. They almost ALWAYS have a deal going on where you get 20 dollars off your purchase. At 40 dollars for 6 meals you're paying around 6.50 for a complete and satisfying meal. I love that my food is always fresh and I know I'm eating healthy. My body hasn't had any negative reactions to the food and I always feel good after every meal. I LOVE their meatballs with spaghetti squash and the buffalo chicken with loaded cauliflower. Thanks Freshly!"}
{"text":"Saw a coupon on FB and gave it a whirl. Boy do I regret it.  Barely have the energy to rap out this review. Started feeling funny with the shrimp plate at lunch.  A lot of hiccups and tummy rumbling.  The chicken marsala is tearing me up nauseous sweating gassy and worse. Sorry freshly not very fresh after all. Awful product and I want a refund.   Definitely a learning experience. The concept is DOA. Get your fresh food from a kitchen at a trusted restaurant or store where the human element is there serving it to you. Delivery is definitely the point of failure for Freshly.  Sorry about it but people need to know what kind of risk they are taking with this service. I'm sorry for the entrepreneurs and investors responsible for Freshly. Guys this model isn't going to work.. unless your marketing team can convince people it's okay to get sick.  Freshly: A service so scary it inspired me to create a Yelp account just to warn everyone."}
{"text":"I had 3 deliveries from Freshly.  The food was good but the customer service lacks greatly.  I went on a 3 week vacation and returned yesterday. Prior to us leaving I put my weekly orders on hold.  They did not ship the food but they still charged my bank account.  I called customer service and was given one excuse after another. First they told me that I didn't put a hold on my deliveries.  I did.... and I printed it out so that I would have proof.  They even charged my bank account the $59.99 twice in one day. Then they told me they already credited the charges to me - they did not.  So how does that happen when the orders were put on hold?  Still waiting for a credit back to my bank account for their error.  I would NOT use their service again - not because the food was not good - only because of how they handled this situation."}
{"text":"Freshly is great for busy people who want to eat healthier. The portion sizes are huge for one person, but maybe it's just all my years of eating crappy food which makes me think \"damn, I still have more vegetables to eat?\" I've liked everything except the berry porridge, which had a weird texture for me. Choosing meals for the week is easy, ingredient lists are comprehensive so I can check for allergens, portions are good, and shipping is reliable. Although, OnTrac never tells me when the delivery arrives. For roughly $7 a meal, it's a great alternative for eating lunch out (which gets pricey in a downtown office)!"}
{"text":"Food is good if a little overpriced but they use Fed-Ex for delivery and will not consider using another delivery service that does not support the NRA."}
{"text":"Best meals: baked veggie penne and turkey chili. I thoroughly enjoy this meal delivery service. I take a few for lunch at work and use a few for back-up dinner options for my 5 year old daughter. I do wish they'd drop their price a bit, but so far 3 of my co-workers have subscribed (since food smells and looks delicios), giving me FREE meals."}
{"text":"very inexpensive and excellent meals! very impressed and well worth it! Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Worst company ever :(. I joined and signed up for the first order. I got an email from FedEx that it was delivered. I go downstairs and I see nothing. I called and they didn't know what happened. They said that they would follow up but no guarantee that they would contact me WTF?  At this point, I wanted to cancel my subscription and I was given a link so I did that. Now, this week I get an email from FedEx that I have an order delivered. I called to let them know what happened but I still get charged. I am told again that yes the subscription is canceled. I guess they wanted their money so they purposely make another delivery.  Stay away form this company fraud is writen all over them."}
{"text":"I had been eyeballing Freshly for quite a while when I decided to show the service to my boyfriend. We looked it over together and we both decided to sign up and try it out. We figured worst case scenario is the food is hideous, cancel, and move on with life. BEST case scenario would be that we love it, and say goodbye to constantly trying to figure out what to do for dinner, shop, spend the $40 on ONE night's meal, cook, clean, etc.   Good news people, it was best case scenario. I got delivery scheduled for Friday and had it delivered to my work rather than let it sit outside my apartment. It came in about an 18 pound box, really nicely packaged and with ice packets in the box keeping everything cold.   I did not actually try one of my meals until Monday. I ordered (2) steak peppercorns (I love steak), chicken pilaf, beef chili, southwest chicken bowl, and the chicken pilaf. I have to say I was genuinely impressed with all the meals with exception of the chili. There wasn't really anything wrong with it, just wasn't my cup of tea. The other meals, however, were great! I was impressed with the quality of the proteins, sauces, and fresh sides. I would also like to comment on the portion sizes. I have not been able to finish one full meal, they completely fill me up!  I have to say I feel great about this decision. I no longer have to come up with dinner or lunch ideas, I am provided with healthy and very filling options, and it keeps me from eating a bunch of fast food options out of convenience needs."}
{"text":"There are several innovations that have changed my life in the last few years such as Amazon, Uber, AirBnB-and now Freshly!  I literally don't cook anymore, which makes me very happy.  I have more time for things I'd rather be doing. Plus, the meals taste way better than what I made myself.  I like all kinds of food, but tend to be a stickler for quality.  Fast food and TV dinners aren't happening with me.  But this stuff is good!"}
{"text":"I ordered freshly was very excited about my order. I have them specific delivery instructions to buzz me and place on my front door.The first delivery my box was left on side of my the inside of my building. The second time it was left outside and just stolen. I'm still waiting for my refund. I will not order again. Food was ok wish delivery service was better."}
{"text":"The service is worthless when the food expires within a day or two of arrival.  My roommate gets these and has been sharing them with me and will be cancelling (if she hasn't already).  Your best option is to hopefully be home when the meals arrive, freeze them immediately, then, depending on which meal you ordered, hopefully all the different parts of the meal it heat up from frozen equally after you add on another minute or two to the time listed on the label.  In saying that, bonus star for the meals being decently tasty from normal refrigeration right after they arrive. You can make much better tasting food for half the price at home, but if you're like my roommate and don't have time, this probably comes in handy.  This would be a much better idea if done with local stations in major cities and delivery routes every 3-4 days like a milk man."}
{"text":"We signed up to the sample ($40), figuring we could cancel if we didn't like it. Meals arrived Saturday. Tried them Saturday night and Sunday. Meals were marginal for our tastes. Tried to cancel on Monday.... too late. We're getting another shipment probably this Saturday of food we don't like for $60. I recommend if you sign up, immediately pause or cancel since you won't have enough time to decide if you like the groceries. The vegis are okay, but all the meat and fish products we have had are tasteless or taste bad or are tough or chewy (in a bad way). Trader Joe's frozen meals, if you pick the right ones, are a better deal. I would recommend to freshly that meal number 2 be two weeks after meal number one and weekly thereafter. You might keep a few more customers."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE freshly!!  Honestly, I am shocked at all of the poor reviews (seriously, ignore those complainers)- you're receiving a refrigerated meal through the mail that you microwave, of course it's not going to taste 5-star restaurant fresh, but honestly, it's pretty damn close!  Aside from the turkey (I advise not starting with that one), my husband and I have loved all of the meals we've tried.  His favorite is the pork carnitas, and my staples are the buffalo chicken and the chicken parm.  They're both under 500 calories and under 20 carbs (great for a low carb, calorie diet).  I wish they'd offer more low carb dishes for around 400 calories though. Most of the time the chicken is juicy, although sometimes you will get a dry piece here and there (oh well).  The mashed cauliflower is AMAZING and healthy - it's a win, win!  I wish I could order this in bulk... I would serve it on the reg for dinner. The peppercorn steak was surprisingly good and juicy - again, you just microwaved a steak, so not the best steak you've ever consumed, but wonderful considering you prepped for under 5 minutes... and you're getting to eat guilt free steak. My husband and I both work crazy hours and want to avoid going out to eat for lunch and meal prepping lunches - $10 for lunch isn't ideal, but it's cheaper and healthier than going out.  We both eat three per week for lunch.  If we don't use one before the expiration date, we throw it in the freezer for the weekend or following week.  If you crave simple, healthy and tasty meals, and you don't mind shelling out $10 each, this is the service for you!  Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to love Freshly and gave it a good three month run but am pretty sure I'll be cancelling in the next few weeks. It still would serve a purpose for some people, so I'll layout some PROS and CONS.  PROS:  - Very convenient and truly solves the after work dinner insanity problem, particularly for families with young kids. 3ish minutes in the microwave and you're done. We started subscribing after my husband and I went back to work after maternity and paternity leave with our second kid. It was incredibly helpful during the first couple months with a new baby and struggling to adjust with going back to work full time. For scenarios like this, I would for sure recommend Freshly as a temporary solution to get your through a hectic time period.  - Again, so much easier than any of the subscription 'make it yourself' meal box services like Hello Fresh, Plated, Blue Apron, etc. - Better taste wise than many frozen meals.  - Reasonable calories for a meal, would be great if you were trying to lose weight.  - Our toddler actually ate many of the meals without much fuss. (He and I would split a meal and my husband would eat a full meal, portions are good.) - Only had one issue with delivery (wrong meal arrived) and customer service promptly gave us a credit on the next shipment.  CONS: - Small selection of meals and it seems like many meals we like aren't available all the time.  - In an average sample of 5 meal options, I'd say 2 were great, 2 were just OK and 1 we would throw out because it would be plain old gross. That's a decent ratio but at the end of the day we were snacking heavily after the mediocre meals and having to find a replacement (hello boxed mac and cheese) for the really gross meals we paid $10 each for, I just don't see the long term value in the service. They let you rate meals online and I've never once got a customer service response after giving meals 1 star. Would be nice if they acknowledged duds and gave you some credits for future meals.  - Delivery is only available on Saturday, and meals go bad on Wednesday. Since we wanted these to solve our dinner after work problem, that meant no flexibility for Mon-Wed meals, and we still had to cook or find other options for Thursday and Friday. Sunday or Monday delivery would be much preferred.   - It sort of assumes everyone is gluten free. I like gluten. Gimme that gluten. Please let me have some real pasta instead of rice pasta. :)"}
{"text":"DO NOT subscribe to this food delivery service. The quality is terrible and the meals are bland. The customer service is also terrible. They just repeat the same scripted responses and do not answer legitimate questions.   Also, be aware that the policy for cancellation is bad. I signed up through a promotion and it was not clear that I was actually signing up for a subscription. I feel this is very sneaky.   They billed me for the second week of the delivery service even BEFORE the first weeks meal was delivered. But did not send me that receipt until AFTER they billed my credit card.They would not let me cancel the the order because they said the food has already been prepared even though it was 3 days before it was to be shipped."}
{"text":"Real let down. Believed the hype and ordered  what is basically flavorless bland refrigerated TV dinners. Also you only have 3 days to consume everything. Blue Apron might be a lot more work but definitely more tasty and fresher so Freshly should call themselves Blandly or maybe Old TV dinnerly but it's definitely not freshly. If you hype up something mediocre enough I guess enough people will believe it and follow the bandwagon.  Total waste of money hopefully can get our money back and can get Stouffer's instead.  Update: tried the beef stew and it was decent and better than the prior rubber Turkey meal so upped it one star."}
{"text":"Received order today of six meals. Generously portioned and tastes very fresh. Reason I did not give five stars is due to sodium content. Avg meal has about +700mg of sodium. That is just too high. Looking for long term meals plan that is also healthy. Unfortunately, I will have to cancel my subscription. If they can make these meals with half the sodium I'll get back on. I reached out to freshly will see what they say."}
{"text":"Horrible cancellation policy, allow you to skip weeks just so that you will forget , refuse to give money back , food is not that good Wouldn't recommend"}
{"text":"I ate the three bean turkey chili. I got as sick as a dog from it. Been in agony all day. Had the subscription for about 4 weeks now but will surely cancel. Wayyy too risky for me. I appreciate Freshly reaching out to me and inquiring on my situation.  They gave me a full refund and launched a diligent investigation into what happened. That meant a lot and I can understand how sometimes these situations can occur in the food service industry."}
{"text":"I am hooked! I am a student, have a full time job and a side gig I am trying to turn into more.   At first I was worried with the price..... but they offered me an intro for 2 weeks for $39.99 -- Smart move Freshly, very smart!  I am an accountant so my number crunching brain had to break it down for my cost, here is my analysis:   1. Time spent hunting for creative, healthy and easy meals:           Time cost = $67.50 2. Going to the store to buy groceries:          Time cost: $45 3. Wine I will have to buy after fighting crowds of annoying people:         Cost: $15 4. Prepping food and cooking for a whole week:           Time cost $90  Opportunity cost:  $217.50 + $50 groceries for 1 = $267.50 per week.   Freshly breakdown:  15  min to select or change meals:            Time cost $11.25  Opportunity Cost:  $11.25 + $59.99 food = $71.24   I am saving $196.26 a week.........  $10,205 a year!!!   And the flavor, I personally could not cook this well.  I expected much less quality than what I got. This beef stew tastes like my grandma cooked it all day.    LOOOVE how I can sort the meals by dietary needs, BLESSING!  The portion sizes are great for me as I am trying to loose the desk job/ study weight.  When I get to the point of wanting to build more muscles, I will go for the higher cal- higher protein selections.   I have looked into many meal services, but they never lived up to my dietary needs.   I  honestly do not even know how I stumbled up on it, but I have recommended it to everyone I know."}
{"text":"I am surprised at the number of individuals who have rated Freshly fewer than three stars. It is one of the most reliable pre-prepped delivery dinner services I've tried, thus far. There are two-week discount promos new customers can use to try it out. (It's how I've gotten started.) I have tried a couple of other companies, and Freshly's food has a better taste, in my opinion. It is convenient for people who have a full schedule but would still like to be mindful of their calorie-intake-- without having to track it constantly."}
{"text":"I was so disappointed after receiving my first delivery bc of lack of customer service. The food was ok and I looked forward to finding my favorites over the next few weeks though there was a payment issue with my old address on my card and contacting customer service 4-5 days before a Saturday shipment was not enough time to allow for \"maximum freshness\" and blah blah blah. I was unconvinced as to why they needed more than a 4-5 day window to reactivity my weekly subscription. Are these measles prepared that far in advance? If so perhaps I am glad that I canceled! After reaching out to customer service three times they were unwilling to accommodate so I took that as a sign and canceled (though they were very helpful on providing specific cancelation instructions after not addressing my concern and trying to keep me as a customer! - one star for that. Heh.)"}
