{"text":"This is a great place for meeting up. They have a good selection of pastry and cakes and make decent drinks. The food choice is also good.

The seating is comfortable and the service is good. There is lots of seating space and PLUGS almost everywhere (YOU DON'T GET THIS VERY OFTEN IN OTHER COFFEE SHOPS).

Some have complained about parking being only 30 minutes and though the sign says that, I personally have not had a problem so far. 

The wifi speed is better than many places I've been to and I like the atmosphere overall. Also, its a great place for reading a newspaper or even studying but the music level may be slightly high for that purpose. 

THANK YOU JAVA JOES OWNERS :)"}
{"text":"great atmosphere, great coffee, tea, pastries, cookies, sandwiches. There used to close at 11 pm. Now they close at 10:30 and they start reminding the customers at 10 : \"we're closing down in 30 min, we're closing down in 15 min, make sure you finish your coffee by 10:30\" If you have no choice but meeting your friends at nights, you probably want to go somewhere you can stay for a bit longer."}
{"text":"Java Joe's is a very disappointing place. First the owner Miltos is a pervert he will literally check you out young or old and is always flirting with the employees. I know this if first hand cause im a former employee he is a rude man, disrespectful, arrogant and perverted."}
{"text":"I'm a supporter of small businesses but the rudeness of the owner (Asian middle age man) made me vow to never come back here again. I'm a regular customer and usually buy lunch at 1ish. Owner came up to me today and asked if I was going to buy anything here otherwise leave. I have never encountered such rude and offensive behavior before. I'm definitely never coming back here nor should anyone who feels obligated to buy something immediately when they walk in."}
{"text":"The best around in its class. Friendly owners and staff. More seats than other coffee shops. Quieter with more room between tables than Tim's or Starbucks. Food is fresh not to my knowledge previously frozen. WiFi is popular."}
{"text":"Peice of shit. 
I'm passing through Markham, running errands for my clients, and I need some coffee.
enter Java Joes; and the red flags go up as soon as I notice that stupid cashiers' attitude...but, the lady server seems nice. 
I order a grilled vegetable sandwich with lettuce and cheese :l only. I should have watched her carefully. Firstly the shit-head cashier tried to switch breads on me,
then my sandwich was served with lots of tomatoes and some old smelly roasted eggplant, un heated and a peice of wilted lettuce. No cheese. What the Fuck. Six Dollars. I'm going to lodge a complaint with public health and the Markham Mayors office."}
{"text":"This place is horrible. Went to do some studying here with a friend one evening. There were only two or three plugs in the whole place and the wifi wasn't even working. When we told the staff, they were not the least bit interested in helping us. The coffee was ok but a bit overpriced. When I wanted to order some food, they told me they already closed the food bar (even though it was more than an hour before close). 

Oh and it seems like the place is a teenage hangout. There was a table of about 7 obnoxious teenagers yelling and laughing at the top of their lungs the whole time. 

Won't be back."}
{"text":"Not a bad place for a quick bite or coffee, but it's literally got to be quick, as parking is limited to 30 minutes! Like anyone can be in and out with friends in 30 min.

They do, however, have pretty decent food, smoothies, and coffee, although it can be inconsistent. Had a really good coffee here one time, but not so great another time. Sometimes salads were amazing, another time the lettuce was soggy already.

Staff are all quite nice and quick, but the format of the counter and register is odd, as you would need to walk all the way in to get an order in and pay as you walk out. In theory it works, but get confusing for those when they walk in. 

With all that in mind, id you are in the area and prefer something else over subway, then this could be a feasible option."}
{"text":"Think of it as Second cup 2.0 with better coffee flavors and lunch items. Free WiFi, password is their phone number (hint: look for the sticker on their windows / walls). Booths are nice and spacey but there is nowhere to plug in. You probably won't need to though because of a 30 minutes parking limit which is unreasonable."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is good for meet ups and working. A bit expensive for coffee that is meh. Not the best customer service."}
{"text":"Nice Joe.  

This is the biggest Java Joes I have patronized.  Unlike the smaller takeout specialities in downtown, this Java Joe is all about lounging, relaxing, coffee chats, reading book, wasting time.  You've got the vibe.  The store is big.  The tables are well spread out.  Some chairs could be more comfortable.  I can't remember for sure if there are sofas or not.  There are a few televisions hung on wall.  This Joe is popular.  There were many customers having their coffee break in this Saturday afternoon.  

We lined up to order and take our food to a table ourselves, so there wasn't much waiting services to speak of.  The ladies behind the counters were super nice and polite, though.  The coffee was average.  It was served in paper cup, which I didn't mind.  We didn't try the food.

We sat way past an hour.  No one talked to us.  Our car was not ticketed."}
{"text":"Java joes is one of those places that you can expect to actually work and get stuff done because it's relatively quiet and seats are easy to find. 

However, their coffee isnt consistent. One time it's good and another time it's burnt. I wasn't a fan of their chocolate chip cookie due to it's crumbly texture and lack of chocolate chips. (I like a lot of chocolate chips okay??! Don't judge)

I'm always happy to chat with the cheerful ladies behind the counter and their service is efficient and personable. I will always have a special attachment to this place because I used to practically live here during exam period while in high school. Java joes, get a handle on that burnt coffee!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars overall.

Coffee is pretty good over multiple visits. Lattes are okay but very inconsistent. Food is pretty good.. They have a good variety of baked goods, soup, salad, sandwiches. I love their moist banana bread!

Parking really isn't a big deal. They have tons of parking in the plaza lot and underground. You don't have to park right outside the door. 

Service is friendly, prices are average as with other cafes"}
{"text":"The owner is, simply put, an asshole. He is a middle aged asian male who makes customers feel very uncomfortable. As soon as you walk into the coffee shop, you better buy something or he is going to come to your table and either ask you to leave, or my personal favorite: \"Are you waiting for a friend\" He has a harsh tone to his voice to go with a fake smile to let you know to pay up or leave. I'm all in favor of supporting small businesses, but the lack of foresight and narrow mind of this owner has officially made me never want to come here again. It's a dam shame, because I actually liked the ambience there."}
{"text":"Had a sandwich here. Not good. Stale bread and just overall not a good sandwich. The service was excellent which is the only reason I gave a two star instead of a one star."}
{"text":"When I saw those 30 minute parking spots in front of Java Joe's.. and then I hardly find any electric outlets inside the store too.. I know I would not have like this Java Joe's as much.

This place remind me of a Second Cup... though it might have more food options... but the set up is kind of uninviting. 

Jewellery and Accessories on sale in a glass display case? In a coffee shop?

The last draw is when the barista frowned when I ordered an Americano ($1.95)... thinking why I don't just order a brewed coffee...

My drink is not bad...

A lot of seniors hang around here as the Thornhill Seniors Centre is just around the corner. So if that's your scene with TV showing CP24... you will enjoy your experience at Java Joe's.

Free Wifi just ask for the password.

BTW, Thornhill Library just around the corner if all you need is some internet time or just to chill... they have electric outlets everywhere! :)"}
