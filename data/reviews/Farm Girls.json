{"text":"I love farm girls!! I also love this food truck! See what I did there?

Really though, Farm Girls is the bomb. If it wasn't for an overly healthy sense of adventure, when I roll up at a multi-truck event, I'd be tempted to not even give other trucks a chance. I'd see that adorable pink checkered truck side and I'd just go!

This isn't food that mamma used to make, but it's the food that mamma should have made. Delicious flavourful cheese, plenty of truffle flavour, these unidentifiable crunchy things and bacon pieces as thick as they are wide. I can't stop thinking about those unidentifiable crunchy things and wishing I had some way of identifying them.

I also tried there raspberry rosemary lemonade float with raspberry rosemary sorbet. Yet again, no way mamma ever made this for me, but why the heck not ma? This was great!

The prices are usually up there in comparison to the other trucks, but  Farm Girls really works hard for your dollar and is worth it. Some trucks seem like they're expensive because of the current novelty of eating from a truck, with Farm Girls, it only seems like you're paying for incredible food.

Can't wait to see you again, Farm Girls!"}
{"text":"There are a few food trucks that have been avoiding my work area since they opened and this annoyed me.  Farm Girls has been one of them.  Until today.

I walked the 2 blocks to where it was parked after viewing their location and menu online.  They have mac & cheese.....SOLD! A short but sweet menu includes their very unique version of mac & cheese made with truffle and butternut squash with a bacon, pumpkin seed and crispy onion crust.  Also included are pork, goat cheese and herb meatloaf sliders, a garden salad (listed on the truck as the \"Garden Glory Bowl\".  Guess which immature pervert was giggling at that?) and a braised beef shepherd's pie.  All are $10 or less or a sampling of all 4 for $12.  Go big or go home, so I went for the Sampler.

The mac & cheese received first tasting.  The experiment of mixed flavours paid off.  It's fantastic.  Just slightly below my favourite of all time.  I wanted to dance on top of their truck with glee, but doubt they would have let me.

The slider that was included was well-rounded in flavour and not dry at all like you run into with many meatloaves.  I was inclined to do a slutty grind dance against their truck.  Once again, doubt they would have let me.

The shepherd's pie was a delicious try with juicy meat and great taste coming from the yam mash.  You don't even want to know what I had in mind to celebrate this one.

I'll be the first one to admit I love fruits and veggies, but for some reason I never feel they are complete alone without a dead animal on top.  The salad was close though and very fresh with a terrific dressing.

The farm girls (and guy) pulled off a terrific lunch that I would feel comfortable going back for again and again.  I'm glad they finally decided to acknowledge my manly awesomeness and stop closer to work.  Well played, Farm Girls.  Well played indeed."}
