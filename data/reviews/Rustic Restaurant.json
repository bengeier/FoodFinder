{"text":"I stopped in my hometown as a weary traveller, and left wondering why I'd never eaten at The Rustic. Their sizable veggie omelette hit the spot, with enough leftover to take home. But the hash browns stole the show, crispy on the outside & smooth on the inside. The servers were prompt & let me eat my breakfast in peace. I look forward to passing through here again!"}
{"text":"Another place that's only open because of old people because they can't read about the human rights violations, seriously it's dirtier then politics."}
{"text":"My favorite burger of all time! The Riegelsberger! Anytime I am home I make sure to stop in for one. We've been going here as a family for as long as I can remember. Always a wonderful experience and we've always loved our food!"}
{"text":"Love their breakfast! Servers on Saturday mornings are excellent. It's a casual, relaxed place.  You must try the omelets."}
{"text":"I really like this place, but my wife isn't a huge fan. I love the comfort food and the close table atmosphere. Nothing fancy- just good, simple food."}
{"text":"Love Rustic!  Their fish sandwich and fries are great.  The pork sandwich is so-so, but I have lived in Texas for many years, and have learned to love Texas BBQ.  Shared onion rings with a cousin, and the onion rings were very good.  The decor is just as I remembered in the '50s and '60s, and I mean that as a compliment.    Wait staff has been very friendly every time I have visited.   Whenever I go back home, my first request is to go to Rustic!"}
{"text":"Well, the Rustic ....hmmmm ...  Well .....what to say?  Good home-cookin'  Reasonable prices.  Hearty portions.  Oh yeah ....and LOTS of Golden Buckeye cards.   As in LOTS.     I've always been told ....if you want good hearty home-cookin' portions ...look for long-haul truckers and senior citizens.  I was, easily, the youngest person in the room at lunch today ....by thirty years."}
{"text":"Been going here for years--seriously the best place!!! Breakfast is off the hook. The pancakes are phenomenal, and the omelettes. I love getting the specials whenever they have some kind of skillet. Usually there's a long wait on Saturday mornings but it's worth it. We are there every Saturday morning!!"}
{"text":"The Rustic has become my favorite place to go to get a great burger.  I have been a patron of this gem for years. It's small and family owned and the prices are reasonable.   There are new burger joints popping up on every corner and, I have tried them all. I keep coming back to the Rustic.  The service is always great."}
{"text":"The food not only has become overpriced, but, the chicken they use is nasty, the service is iffy, the table clothes are filthy(esp on the sides, salt & pepper shakers sticky). Got a salad & they a la Carte'd me on everything, cost almost $15 for a grilled chicken salad.  I'd rather spend about the same amount & go to Joe's Deli. Atleast I know my food will b more then worth the price &&&& Aweome!!"}
{"text":"Great place for lunch! Fast service and very tasty food. It's a nice atmosphere, diner-like feel with reasonable prices."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years- my favorite is the reiglesburger and I come here to get it every time I'm in town.  Chocolate malts are also excellent. Service is friendly and efficient.    The burgers are just so good I cant even think of all the words to say how delicious they are. Eat the reigleburger! You won't be sorry."}
{"text":"My family and I have passed over this little Cleveland diner for years but we've always known about it since I was a kid or maybe not since they were younger either.  Last night we finally lifted the veil and decided to enjoy one of their signature burgers and each of us tried one of their fried sides like fries, shrooms, and zucchini too.  I was fairly impressed for a diner style burger and I am definitely planning on returning to try one of their other sandwiches or one of their specials.  I was also impressed with the down home rustic country atmosphere living up to its namesake.  For being in business for nearly 70 years, Rustic must be doing something right."}
{"text":"Place is fantastic.   Great food, consistent and always hot and fresh.   Reigelsburger is excellent.   Shakes are good too.    Great waitresses.   Attentive and quick.  Really nice place."}
{"text":"Cannot wait to go back again! It has a cozy cabin like feel with great service, food, and prices. My daughter loved their mashed potatoes, I loved their golden fries and tuna melt, and my husband had the best Philly ever! We had a party of 6 and were in and out in less than an hour to catch a movie."}
{"text":"After all the great comments I really wanted to love this place...but unfortunately it fell in the very average range for me.  Recently I popped in here for a quick lunch before shopping across the street at the mall, and wanted to give one of their famous burgers a try.  I didn't want to go too big, so I settled on the grilled cheeseburger platter which included a burger, fries and a side of cole slaw.  The patty on the burger was served super thin and on a grilled bun. They added sauteed (canned, I'm pretty sure) mushrooms, which I did not ask for but ate anyways as I do not believe in wasting food.  The flavor was that of an average diner-style burger from a flattop grill.  The shoestring fries on the side were crisp and hot and I did enjoy them.  The cole slaw had an unusual taste, maybe from sweet pickles instead of dill?  In any case, i'm not a fan of sweet cole slaw but that is style more than anything.  Service was friendly and prompt, but in the end the meal was neither good nor bad...just right down the middle.  I have heard that they are also known for their breakfasts, so maybe that warrants another visit?"}
{"text":"Get along, little doggies. That's what I hear in my head when I step into the Rustic. This log cabin inspired time warp is easily missed as you cruise down Center Ridge along the Rocky River / Fairview border. In fact, I bet you're thinking to yourself \"I've never noticed this place!\" It's on the north side of the street and the sign on the building reminds me of a lasso.   The dining area is on large room, so I imagine on a busy Saturday afternoon with families the space can get quite loud. The style of service and food can most easily be described as \"diner\" or \"greasy spoon.\" There were several restaurants like this in my hometown, and I always feel nostalgic when I stumble upon one in the Cleve. I can't imagine a lot has changed about The Rustic in the past few decades.   As far as food goes, I had a burger, which was tasty and simple."}
{"text":"i LOVE this place!!!! The reigelsburger with cheese is the bomb!! I've traveled a lot and this is one of my favorite burgers in the USA!! Breakfast is good as well and cheap! Try it, you will NOT be disappointed:)"}
{"text":"Oh the Rustic. We stopped here for breakfast. It is simple home style food. The d√©cor was \"rustic\" themed through and through from the curtains to the chairs. I felt like I had stepped into the \"Bonanza\" era. Service was casual but quick.   I ordered two scrambled eggs with hash browns and cinnamon toast. The cinnamon toast was just like my Aunt used to make with white bread, butter and a good thick layer of cinnamon sugar. None of this fancy stuff but absolutely delicious. My husband ordered the breakfast sandwich. Our order came up fast! Our bill was $12 with coffee and a soft drink. You can't beat that."}
{"text":"The Rustic's been a staple in Rocky River for fifty years, and if you don't like what they have to offer, well, they'll get by without you.  They take only cash, and serve from a fairly limited diner-style menu to devoted clientele.  But you can get a genuine burger and fries for $5.00.    The food?  Honestly, it's okay.  It's dirt-cheap, and pretty decent for what it is, but it's definitely dinery.  The bread is Wonder bread, and the gravy is canned, and the turkey they use in their hot open sandwiches is scooped out of a tin somewhere.  But hey!  It's a diner, what did you expect?  And it is where all the locals eat, so it's an experience worth having just for the people-watching.  And should you come early, there's a lot of people to watch; they serve efficiently here, so don't expect a long chat afterwards.  On the plus side, you'll be seated within a few minutes."}
{"text":"I really want to give more stars, but I just can't. The food was great. And totally worth four or five stars. The service was from Dante's inferno. Not sure which level of hell our waitress, Missy came from but I'm sure it included rude staff. I ordered eggs, once over light. They were scrambled. Not one time did anyone ask how things were. They were good. I ate the eggs since she never bothered to check on us. Someone else refilled our coffee. Even when I paid, I was never asked how things were. Rude.  I chose to sit at a table that was accessible for my mom who has had foot surgery. We got treated to eyefuls of old men's wedgies while talking to the wait staff. I'd go back but only if I never had that waitress again.  The food was cheap and good but the service really needs to step up. Just be pleasant!"}
{"text":"Rustic, oh my dear sweet Rustic.  Back when I was a teenager you were my very own version of The Max from Saved By The Bell - but minus the neon colored decorations.  Cheap, delicious hamburgers!  You've been dishing them out since the Kennedy Administration.  Your portions are generous, and you offer a great family dining experience.  You also offer the Peanutburger.  An interesting concoction of hamburgers and peanuts.  It took me many years before I warmed up to it, and it may have even been a dare that made me order it the first time but now I understand.  I really do!  Thank you for all the years of grub."}
{"text":"Not many veg options, but the breaded mushrooms and onion rings are my favorites.  The grilled cheese isn't bad either.  Mostly I like this place because we ate here a lot as a kid, and I love the interior.  Very cozy."}
{"text":"Spectacular breakfast and unbeatable prices. Waaaaaay better than any breakfast chains. So clean you'd think you're eating at home! Wait staff is awesome too. Highly recommend for sure."}
{"text":"It was okay - I've had better and worse. My main complaint is I found several hairs in my food. Wouldn't really want to go back."}
{"text":"Good for a big burger and fries, but not so hot for other items.  I ordered a special about a month ago, it was beef stew.  The meat was so spongy and fatty I could barely eat it.  Also, it was served on a flat plate which seems inappropriate for a stew type of meal.  I did not complain to wait staff until after my two guests finished their meals (both hamburgers, both pretty good they indicated.)  I will still go to the Rustic for burgers but no more specials for me."}
{"text":"Great family restaurant! Limited menu, but always has excelent specials. Prices are reasonable, service is outstanding. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Really great comfort food. They also have pretty decent salads with mesclun greens and feta. I really enjoyed the wrap I got too"}
{"text":"Old family diner atmosphere here. Went on a Friday evening, lot of younger families. Prices were very reasonable, got a roast beef sandwich and fries for $6.95. It was almost comparable to the same at Applebee's. Restaurant is small, so servers are fast and personable. Very large dessert section as well, which I declined on. If your looking for a quick, cheap bite to eat while running errands, this is a perfect place to stop and grab a bite. Now if your looking to take that special someone out, I would shy away from this family oriented atmosphere."}
{"text":"Altho Mark A. believes that I as a man of a certain age should enjoy the Rustic on one of my few and limited outings I am here to say I do not. I respect that this place is one of the few buildings on Center Ridge Road that did not succumb to the bulldozers of suburban monotony. Nonetheless, I find the architecture and decor tacky and the roadhouse menu beyond the scope of the kitchen. Every few years I decide to give the Rustic a retry. Today it was filled with office type women. A few men sat alone here and there. I had a Reiglesburger and regretted I had not gone across the street to Five Guys. Sad when a national chain outshines a local. Actually Rustic Restaurant can be thought of as a chain of one with food and decor appropriate to a chain. Since I put this in writing It can serve to remind me not to come here again. I wonder if Mark's grandmother knows how disrespectfully he describes her."}
{"text":"I've been in Rocky River for years and this has been my first time here. Very welcoming atmosphere. They're super solo diner-friendly and I didn't feel rushed or out of place. I got the River Special and corner need hash. The scrambled eggs were a but hard for my taste but everything else was awesome.   Tip: They don't make pancakes or French toast after 11 a.m."}
{"text":"Used to eat here all the time as a kid.  My mom suggested it recently when I was craving a really good burger.  Had their gourmet burger with hash browns and we split the onion rings.  Awesome!!  I can't wait to go back.  They've come a long way since 25 years ago when we ate here as a kid.  They have a big variety of daily specials and the prices have gone up.  I was shocked to see a Lake Erie perch special on the board for $19.95?!?  But still, the gourmet burger is $8.79 and definitely comparable to all the other gourmet burger places that have cropped up on the West side in the last few years.  I get cravings for that burger and can't wait to go back.  My mom loves this place, and the crowd is for the most part, older folks.   who cares!  The Rustic has good food and great customer service.  If you're in the area, definitely stop in!"}
{"text":"Disgusting old food. Workers not well trained food was bad place is old.  What else do u have to say. My son started eating his food and through up in his plate.  Never going back."}
{"text":"Stopped in for breakfast around 10:45am, breakfast is only served until 11am FYI. Waited about 10 minutes before a waitress came by. When she did bring us our waters, she threw the straws at us...Something was off about her, it was BAD SERVICE. When I did order, she didn't even look at me.  Food was blah, toast was burnt, I'd give it average, but the service knocked it down. I almost feel like this place only caters to their regulars.   Not impressed."}
{"text":"I feel so young!   This seems like a restaurant you come to once, then you come back every week. There are so many people that are just sitting around, drinking coffee and talking. A lot of people know each other too.   This place feels like a good ol' dinner. Kinda outdated... But that adds to the appeal.   I ordered eggs, bacon, home fries and switched the toast out for some fresh fruit.  Total is $6. Not bad.   The food itself was The fruit was fresh. Cantaloupe, grapes, honey dew and pine The hash browns were great. Super crunchy on the outside. I got my eggs over easy... They were a little under, but still good.   Overall it is a cute little place. I love people watching all the different people. And I may have been listening to the older women behind me talking about their new boyfriends ;)"}
{"text":"pretty good. If you're wondering what a \"Peanut Burger\" is, it's a plain burger with peanuts on it. yep."}
{"text":"Best burgers around! You walk in, expecting a poor diner experience -- but trust me once you bite into that delicious burger it all makes sense. I'm pretty sure I had a choir of angels behind me singing the Hallelujah Chorus while I was eating.  I'm dreaming about the next time I am able to come back.  Until next time, dear lovely Rustics."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick lunch, glad I did!  I ordered the RIEGELSBERGER, it is very very tasty!  I would recommend it. The onion rings were also quite delicious.   Fast, friendly service."}
{"text":"I've been eating at this Rocky River institution for 30 years, although never once by choice. It's my grandmother's favorite restaurant so whenever I'm back in town visiting we end up coming here to eat dinner between the hours of 2:30 and 4:00pm. A large portion of the clientele seems to be in the same boat as my grandma - they don't get out too much anymore and just want to to eat somewhere familiar, not one of those newfangled Applebee's or Chili's where they play that loud rock and roll music and ask if you want to Funsize your OnionBlast XtremeRings.  No, at the Rustic you get the same thing you got 50 years ago. Diner-quality food in a building that looks like a log cabin and smells a little bit like a nursing home. While the food quality is better than it was a few years ago, it's certainly nothing I'd ever seek out on my own."}
{"text":"Every time i come home for the holidays i make sure to get the Riegelsburger, one of the best burgers i have ever had. The only burger that comes close is an INnOut on the West Coast.  MMMMM."}
{"text":"This is one of those nostalgic restaurants from my childhood and happy early adult years. I used to go here with my beloved Grandma every week after grocery shopping for years. Sadly, after her passing in 2007 I stopped going because it was just too painful.   Today my husband met me for lunch here and I swear it was like traveling back in time. I half expected to see my Grandma walk through the door in her cream trench coat, large sunglasses and brown leather gloves, smelling of Kools and complaining of the cold.   I ordered my old favorite, a tuna melt, and my husband got the Gourmet burger with cheddar and we tried something new also, the breaded mushrooms.   As soon as the food arrived I was elated. It looked exactly as I remember it and it tasted the same as well. It was perfection. The bread was toasted and buttery and the tuna inside was cool and lovely. The breaded mushrooms were so good I told my husband I was glad we came here in my 3rd trimester and not my 1st, otherwise he would be running to Rustic's nightly for breaded mushrooms. They could easily become an addiction.   The decor is rustic, as some other people have mentioned. It looks like a log cabin inside with some fake greenery. It has that old school feel that I love, like back in the 80's, with the dark wood everything (think Bearden's before it got the white-wash interior) I love sitting in the pseudo-cabin watching the wind blow the snow around outside.   He was really happy we went and said we should lunch there again more often and I fully agree. I was pleasantly surprised that nothing had changed!"}
{"text":"been going here for what seems like forever .. maybe because it has been that long .. seriously? .. hands down .. the BEST hash browns .. EVER! .. they will change your life!"}
{"text":"best burger in cle. enjoy the cheesy delicious reiglesburger and Cajun fries. I don't know what any of the other food tastes like, 25 years and every time I eat here I get the same thing."}
{"text":"Okay, I'm biased on this one because I love my greasy diner food (unfortunately). And to put greasy diner food in an ambiant, cozy little cabin atmosphere plopped down at a bustling rocky river intersection was fascinating to me. It's solid diner food, we had a very sweet waitress, cheap prices, and the inside is actually pretty cool!"}
{"text":"This place is your very typical diner. We came in not knowing what to expect, but having heard good things. You walk in and seat yourself. We were greeted immediately by our server, who was very friendly and helpful throughout our experience here.   Their menu has your very typical diner food- burgers, sandwiches, etc. and they also seemed to have a ton of specials. Everyone enjoyed their meals and the price was definitely not bad. For 5 of us, I believe it was about $40.   This is definitely a good place to go when you're in the mood for a quick meal with a relaxing atmosphere and when you just want some comfort food!"}
{"text":"Three stars for the food, extra star for the service and atmosphere.   We've only ever been here for breakfast. Usually Sean and I will go out for breakfast on Friday mornings when I get off from working overnight. The Rustic is one of our traditional spots for this for a few reasons.   Mostly, I like the Rustic because it reminds me of the hometown diners in northern Wisconsin where I grew up. Nothing fancy, a little rough around the edges, but with good standard comfort food and great service. Also, you see a little slice of society (at least RR society) here I think. You'll see little old couples, young couples, dads taking their 2-year-old for breakfast, and people meeting up with friends for what seems like their weekly get-together.  Just a nice little community diner.   We've had several of the breakfast combos - usually I go with the River Special or the Canadian. All have been well-prepared - you'll have your eggs cooked correctly here, I promise you. Bacon is good, Canadian bacon good also.   The coffee pretty weak but your cup is never empty and the waitresses are always quick and friendly - no apathetic teenagers serving here. These ladies are professionals.   A couple things could definitely be better about the food - the hash browns aren't the greatest in my opinion, and the hot sauce is Tabasco. Bummer on both counts.   Overall, a nice, cheap little old-school spot to change it up once in awhile."}
{"text":"My sister and I went to Rustic for lunch yesterday. It was our first time ever eating there, in spite of living on the west side since 1978. I think we never stopped in before, because of the outside of the building. It's not terribly appealing. It doesn't look like a dump at all, it just looks plain, I guess. Well the inside is a very pleasant surprise. The decor is home-y and rustic without looking old or tired. We both had burgers and agreed that they were very, very good. I guess as I have always seen the parking lot full, we should've eaten here sooner. We just didn't, but I'm sure we will return. I'm not quite ready to give it 4 stars yet, but I will update after I have tried more of the menu."}
{"text":"I've been going to this restaurant since I was a kid.  This place is delicious-nothing ever changes! The burgers are still as good as ever.  I love it."}
{"text":"Time of Visit - 2pm Friday. I think it's important to note that in all my reviews. It can make a big difference in many establishments.   The Rustic:  As another Yelp reviewer stated, the d√©cor isn't \"bad\", it's just plain in a \"rustic\" sort of way. Most of the people there were over 50. Now, onto the food:  We had been across the street at the shopping plaza and asked about the Rustic, as we'd never visited. We were told the burgers were great. Well, we weren't that hungry and their \"famous Reigelberger\" was $5.99 so we each got one. Fries were extra, and we got those too. Bacon, mushrooms and cheese... cost extra, but we got those too. As other reviewers have mentioned, the patties were *thin* - I mean think of those frozen, pre-formed, in-bulk 70/30 \"beef\" things you get at GFS, Costco, Sam's etc. -- Well, for this reason, our food came out quickly. Ordering that thin of a burger medium rare is pretty pointless - they'd have to sear it and put it on the bun. It was too thin to even be pink in the middle. Worst of all, there was no taste to the meat at all. The bacon, naturally salty, was the only thing I could taste. I had to wonder if because of all the seniors, they hold back on the seasonings. Anyway, I ate half the tasteless sandwich, and took the rest home, chopped up in a box for the stray cat. The fries, meh, they were fries you know?  I will say however that the menu lists a \"gourmet\" burger which was of bigger weight, so maybe that's the burger other Yelp reviewers have enjoyed more, I don't know. Our drink refills were prompt, waitress was friendly enough. Desert was not offered. We wouldn't have ordered it, but it's nice to have a \"Can I get you anything else?\"  Their menu did include other items which I thought were pretty expensive given the location and ambiance. $12 for a 2 piece cod dinner? So we probably won't go back. We don't get to Rocky River often, and this definitely didn't impress."}
{"text":"In all my years of living in the area, I never ventured out to Rustic until recently. I've heard they have a great breakfast, but since it was 6pm and they weren't serving it at that hour, I had to get dinner (darn. early bird gets the worm.). Luckily, I wasn't disappointed.  Now, I will agree with many other reviewers that the decor is dated and there are a lot of white-haird clientele, however, I'm there for the food, not a romantic date, so I could care less.  My dinner companion and I both ordered the chicken paprikash and we both thought it was excellent. The noodles were homemade and the portion sizes were pretty decent. Sauce was also very tasty.  Here's my only thing- it comes with either applesauce or coleslaw, both seemingly not homemade. For the price you pay, which was a little high, the Rustic needs to step up their game. The coleslaw was basically what your lazy mother would make for a backyard bbq - bagged stuff with jarred stuff poured over it and mixed. Not that there's anything wrong with that, but for a restaurant, well, you get it.   Also, I agree with others on the service. It wasn't bad, but it was abrupt? I mean, it wasn't unfriendly, but it also wasn't friendly.   Regardless, I will definitely go back for a quick and delicious meal."}
{"text":"Consistency is a good thing.  And the Rustic is consistent. This was my go-to lunch place when I worked in Rocky River for 20+  years and I still find myself coming back.   The food is always consistently good, the staff consistently friendly and service is consistently efficient.   You seat yourself, but never seems hard to find a table. Once seated, someone immediately acknowledges you. The menu is diner type food with about 10 daily specials listed on a chalkboard on the wall. One of my favorites is the chicken paprikash which is usually available on Fridays.   Service is quick, but you don't feel rushed and staff are always smiling. You always feel welcomed here."}
